### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Stanford wrestling started the
weekend on a disappointing note
by losing to an impressive Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo squad Fri
day but redeemed itself Saturday
with six place-winners and an
overall third place at the All-Cali
fornia Invitational.
The Cal Poly meet started slow
ly for the Cardinal, with the first
three matches going to the Mus
tangs. At 118 pounds, Stanford
freshman Rudy Ruiz lost 8-4 to Cal
Poly senior Tyson Rondeau, while
Cardinal sophomore Zach Zim
merer fell to senior Gail Miller 7-2.
Junior Robert Hatta kept his
match close until he got what

grappler.
At 142 pounds, junior Beau
Weiner served up a crowd-pleaser

by defeating his opponent in over

match. Although Weiner jumped
out to an early lead, he was unable
to keep his scrappy opponent from
fighting back to a 5-5 tie at the end
of regulation. However, Weiner
responded quickly in overtime by
taking down his opponent to earn
the 7-5 victory.
Stanford sophomore B.J.
Sanchez lost to junior Mustang
Craig Welk 7-2. Junior Jason Glad
den lost a heartbreaker in over
time 2-1, and Cardinal sophomore
Tim Kendall's aggressive and
scrappy style was not enough to
overcome his larger and more
experienced opponent. Kendall,
who normally wrestles at 177
pounds, moved up a weight to 190
to replace the injured senior Brian
Vaniman.
