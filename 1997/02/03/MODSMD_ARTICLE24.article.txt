# Women's hoops crushes Weenies

### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
No matter which side of the
court you're coaching from, a 51-
point blowout is a 51-point
blowout — just ask Marianne
Stanley.
Last March 2, she stood on the
other bench leading the Cardinal
as Stanford gave California its
worst loss ever, an 87-36 embar
rassment at Maples Pavilion. On
Friday night, the homecoming
ended a little after the 7,391 fans
in Maples gave the first-year Cal
head coach a thunderous stand
ing ovation as the third-ranked
Cardinal (21-1, 9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) ran the Bears (6-12,
2-7) out of the building 95-44.
The Cardinal got a tremen
dous boost from the return of
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard,
who looked in top form, taking a
pass from senior guard Jamila
Wideman and muscling inside for

the first points of the contest.
Senior forward Kate Starbird
had, according to Stanley, an
invisible 23 points in only 24 min
utes of play to lead the team for
the ninth straight game, which
ties a 17-year-old school record.
Junior center Olympia Scott
pounded inside at will with 19
points and nine rebounds in 27
minutes of play. But more impor
tantly, there was no going
through the motions for the Car
dinal on this night, as everyone
contributed to the Bears' swift
demise.
"It was really, really nice to see
[junior] Paula [McNamee],
(freshman guards] Milena [Flo
res] and Christina [Batastini] go
in and not have the game deterio
rate," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "In fact, I
thought they did some really nice
things."
It was close for maybe two pos
sessions as the only hotly contest
ed matchup was in the middle,
where Scott and sophomore cen
ter Jennie Leander were battling
each other. With 7:25 to go, Stan
ford's junior center had 13 of
Stanford's 35 points while Lean
der hit four of her first five shots
for nine points. Still, Stanford led
by 14, and it only got worse. The
Bears went scoreless for several
minutes as Starbird was scorch
ing the nets and finding her
teammates, dishing out five first
half assists. Nygaard was on tar
get from the field both inside and
from the perimeter, scoring an
effective nine points and grabbing
four rebounds.
"I was just so excited, I didn't
feel like I had knees," Nygaard
said.
Cal seemed to grow discour
aged by the situation as it shot
several errant outside shots on
their way to a miserable 36.7 field
goal percentage and a 49-26 half
time deficit.
"I thought we played a good
first half," Stanley said. "We were
aggressive, but we faltered a little
bit in the Becond half. We had a
lot of trouble distributing the
ball, and Stanford played really
hard, as they typically do."
Faltered does not seem to
begin to describe it. As Van-
Derveer slowly pulled her
starters at different stretches of
the game, the deficit got worse.

When Starbird exited, it was 62-
30. By the time senior guard
Charmin Smith sat down for the
evening, it was 80-38 with 5:44 to
go. Nygaard only shot once and
grabbed two rebounds in the sec
ond half before she, too, took a
seat.

"Once we got up 40, I just
thought I'm not going to put her
in and have someone trip her and
hurt her big toe or something like
that," VanDerveer said.
For a while, Cal was even
threatening to score less than last
year's 36 points, turning the ball
over in its first five possessions
and staying at 30 for most of the
second half. Only a brief flurry by
the Bears in the final five min
utes allowed them to reach 40 for
the game, but their 44 points
marked the fewest allowed by the
Cardinal since the last Stanford-
Cal matchup. For the game, the
Bears shot 33.9 percent from the
floor and got only one assist in
the entire second half.
The final 15 minutes served as
a stage for the likes of Flores,
McNamee, Batastini and sopho
more center Chandra Benton to
prove themselves as ready con
tributors down the stretch. Flo
res and Batastini ran the floor
effectively while McNamee and
Benton teamed up to score 11
points and grab three rebounds.
"I honestly think that will help
us as much as anything else,"
VanDerveer said. "They are gain
ing confidence, and I'm gaining
confidence in them."
Their confident play will cer
tainly be needed as Stanford lost
the services of junior forward

write for sports

Naomi Mulitauaopele for a
month. Thursday's MRI exam
revealed a torn meniscus in her
right knee that required arthro
scopic surgery on Saturday. It was
similar to Nygaard's injury, and
Mulitauaopele should return by
the start of the NCAA tourna
ment.

the game, but their 44 points
marked the fewest allowed by the
Cardinal since the last Stanford-
Cal matchup. For the game, the
Bears shot 33.9 percent from the
floor and got only one assist in
the entire second half.
The final 15 minutes served as
a stage for the likes of Flores,
McNamee, Batastini and sopho
more center Chandra Benton to
prove themselves as ready con
tributors down the stretch. Flo
res and Batastini ran the floor
effectively while McNamee and
Benton teamed up to score 11
points and grab three rebounds.
"I honestly think that will help
us as much as anything else,"
VanDerveer said. "They are gain
ing confidence, and I'm gaining
confidence in them."
Their confident play will cer
tainly be needed as Stanford lost
the services of junior forward

No matter which side of the
court you're coaching from, a 51-
point blowout is a 51-point
blowout — just ask Marianne
Stanley.
Last March 2, she stood on the
other bench leading the Cardinal
as Stanford gave California its
worst loss ever, an 87-36 embar
rassment at Maples Pavilion. On
Friday night, the homecoming
ended a little after the 7,391 fans
in Maples gave the first-year Cal
head coach a thunderous stand
ing ovation as the third-ranked
Cardinal (21-1, 9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) ran the Bears (6-12,
2-7) out of the building 95-44.
The Cardinal got a tremen
dous boost from the return of
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard,
who looked in top form, taking a
pass from senior guard Jamila
Wideman and muscling inside for

the first points of the contest.
Senior forward Kate Starbird
had, according to Stanley, an
invisible 23 points in only 24 min
utes of play to lead the team for
the ninth straight game, which
ties a 17-year-old school record.
Junior center Olympia Scott
pounded inside at will with 19
points and nine rebounds in 27
minutes of play. But more impor
tantly, there was no going
through the motions for the Car
dinal on this night, as everyone
contributed to the Bears' swift
demise.
"It was really, really nice to see
[junior] Paula [McNamee],
(freshman guards] Milena [Flo
res] and Christina [Batastini] go
in and not have the game deterio
rate," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "In fact, I
thought they did some really nice
things."
It was close for maybe two pos
sessions as the only hotly contest
ed matchup was in the middle,
where Scott and sophomore cen
ter Jennie Leander were battling
each other. With 7:25 to go, Stan
ford's junior center had 13 of
Stanford's 35 points while Lean
der hit four of her first five shots
for nine points. Still, Stanford led
by 14, and it only got worse. The
Bears went scoreless for several
minutes as Starbird was scorch
ing the nets and finding her
teammates, dishing out five first
half assists. Nygaard was on tar
get from the field both inside and
from the perimeter, scoring an
effective nine points and grabbing
four rebounds.
"I was just so excited, I didn't
feel like I had knees," Nygaard
said.
Cal seemed to grow discour
aged by the situation as it shot
several errant outside shots on
their way to a miserable 36.7 field
goal percentage and a 49-26 half
time deficit.
"I thought we played a good
first half," Stanley said. "We were
aggressive, but we faltered a little
bit in the Becond half. We had a
lot of trouble distributing the
ball, and Stanford played really
hard, as they typically do."
Faltered does not seem to
begin to describe it. As Van-
Derveer slowly pulled her
starters at different stretches of
the game, the deficit got worse.

When Starbird exited, it was 62-
30. By the time senior guard
Charmin Smith sat down for the
evening, it was 80-38 with 5:44 to
go. Nygaard only shot once and
grabbed two rebounds in the sec
ond half before she, too, took a
seat.

"Once we got up 40, I just
thought I'm not going to put her
in and have someone trip her and
hurt her big toe or something like
that," VanDerveer said.
For a while, Cal was even
threatening to score less than last
year's 36 points, turning the ball
over in its first five possessions
and staying at 30 for most of the
second half. Only a brief flurry by
the Bears in the final five min
utes allowed them to reach 40 for
the game, but their 44 points
marked the fewest allowed by the
Cardinal since the last Stanford-
Cal matchup. For the game, the
Bears shot 33.9 percent from the
floor and got only one assist in
the entire second half.
The final 15 minutes served as
a stage for the likes of Flores,
McNamee, Batastini and sopho
more center Chandra Benton to
prove themselves as ready con
tributors down the stretch. Flo
res and Batastini ran the floor
effectively while McNamee and
Benton teamed up to score 11
points and grab three rebounds.
"I honestly think that will help
us as much as anything else,"
VanDerveer said. "They are gain
ing confidence, and I'm gaining
confidence in them."
Their confident play will cer
tainly be needed as Stanford lost
