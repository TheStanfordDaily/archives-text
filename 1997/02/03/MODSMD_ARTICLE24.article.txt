# Women's hoops crushes Weenies

No matter which side of the
court you're coaching from, a 51-
point blowout is a 51-point
blowout â€” just ask Marianne
Stanley.
Last March 2, she stood on the
other bench leading the Cardinal
as Stanford gave California its
worst loss ever, an 87-36 embar
rassment at Maples Pavilion. On
Friday night, the homecoming
ended a little after the 7,391 fans
in Maples gave the first-year Cal
head coach a thunderous stand
ing ovation as the third-ranked
Cardinal (21-1, 9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) ran the Bears (6-12,
2-7) out of the building 95-44.
The Cardinal got a tremen
dous boost from the return of
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard,
who looked in top form, taking a
pass from senior guard Jamila
Wideman and muscling inside for

the first points of the contest.
Senior forward Kate Starbird
had, according to Stanley, an
invisible 23 points in only 24 min
utes of play to lead the team for
the ninth straight game, which
ties a 17-year-old school record.
Junior center Olympia Scott
pounded inside at will with 19
points and nine rebounds in 27
minutes of play. But more impor
tantly, there was no going
through the motions for the Car
dinal on this night, as everyone
contributed to the Bears' swift
demise.
"It was really, really nice to see
[junior] Paula [McNamee],
(freshman guards] Milena [Flo
res] and Christina [Batastini] go
in and not have the game deterio
rate," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "In fact, I
thought they did some really nice
things."
