## 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
Friday's game between the
No. 3 Stanford women's basket
ball team and archrival Califor
nia was one of the most antici
pated games of the Cardinal's
season thus far.
It was played up ail week as
Cal head coach Marianne Stan
ley's return to Maples Pavilion
for the first time since she held
the position of Cardinal co-inter
im head coach last season. It was
also junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard's first game back since
suffering a tear to her meniscus
that required arthroscopic
surgery on her knee and side
lined her for three weeks.
Most fans even expected it to
it wa? Stan
ford won 95-44), but what was
not anticipated was the out
standing post matchup between

Stanford junior Olympia Scott
and Cal sophomore Jennie Lean
der throughout the first half.
The packed house at Maples
was on its feet to welcome Stan
ley with a standing ovation dur
ing the announcement of the
starting lineups, but according to
both coaches and as far as the
score indicates, that's as warm as
Stanley's homecoming ever got.
"Some of you guys make it
sound like it was going to be a
lovefest and all that kind of
crap, - ' Stanley said. "Geez, once
the ball gets tossed up all that's
out the window; we play. Good
teams do that, that's what
they're supposed to do. I don't
like playing friends any more
than [Stanford head coach] Tara
[VanDerveer] does.
"I've jSnt-Trrr own team now 1
have a real special fondness for a
lot of people here, but my home is
in Berkeley. It was nice being back
here. I was excited and just jazzed
about coming back over here. I
knew it would be a great crowd. As
a player this is what you live for."
Stanford jumped on the Bears
from the start with a quick basket
from Nygaard that ignited the sell
out crowd of 7,391, which included
Olympic gold medalist and former
Stanford standout Jennifer Azzi.
Nygaard seemed as though she
hadn't missed a beat during her
three-week absence from the court,
going 4 of 5 in the first half with
nine points and four rebounds. The
forward only saw eight minutes of
playing time in the second half,
taking one shot and adding two
more rebounds to her game totals.
Stanford was up 49-26 at the
break thanks to excellent shooting
(48.6 percent from the field, 50 per
cent from three-point land and
87.5 percent from the charity
stripe). Cal, on the other hand, was
a meager 36.7 percent from the

field and 37.5 and 50 percent from
three-point range and the free
throw line, respectively.
In fact about the only thing of
interest, besides senior forward
Kate Starbird's invisible 23-point
performance for the game, was the
break down in the paint for the
first 20 minutes of play. Scott and
Leander matched it up shot for
shot and rebound for rebound in
the first period and entered the
locker room with almost identical
numbers.
Scott, who is the Card's second
leading scorer with 16 points per
game and the leading rebounder
with 7.6 boards per contest, got off
to a great start, shooting 6 of 9
from the field and 3 of 3 from the
charity stripe for 15 first-half
points. Scott also grabbed seven
rebounds before the break.
"Look at what Olvmpia did,"
Stanley said. "She just tore us up
inside; she had her way with us.
That's playing your butt ofT in the
post."
1 zander was equally impressive
in the paint. The 6-foot-3 sopho
more, who is Cal's second-leading
scorer (10.9) and leading rebound
er (8.9), led all Golden Bear scorers

with 19 points. In the first half she
was 6-of-9 from the field with 13
points and three rebounds.
The matchup was so close in the
first half that only Scott's 3-of-3
performance from the line distin
guished her from who
made Cal's only free throw of the
game in the first half. In fact, only
the score arid a late-game fade by
Leander prevented this battle from
heating up in the second half.
With the tremendous lead, Scott
only saw nine minutes of action in
the second half and made two of
her five shots while pulling two
more rebounds. Leander mean
while connected on 3 of 6 in the
second and grabbed four more
boards Both players finished the
game with 19 points in the lopsided
Cardinal victory
"Not at all," VanDerveer said
when asked if she felt bad about
beating Stanley so handily. "We
work even- day in the gym with our
own team, and if they're shooting
badly I like to think it's because
[our team] was playing great
defense. It wouldn't matter if my
mother was sitting on the other
bench, we're going to come out and
play hard."
