### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
A heartbreaker, an earth
shaker and a frustrating wake
up call — all in one weekend?
The top-ranked Stanford
baseball team (3-2) traveled to
No. 12 Cal State-Fullerton (2-2)
this weekend for a three-game
series, perhaps better referred to
as a three-day roller-coaster
ride.
On Friday night, the Cardinal
battled back from a three-run
deficit, only to lose 6-5 in the
bottom of the ninth inning. Sat
urday evening saw the Stanford
offense take control in a convinc
ing 15-5 victory. In yesterday's
rubber game, the Fullerton
Titans did a 180-degree shift
from the night before, beating
Stanford 9-5 and winning the
series.
Despite losing the series
opener, the Cardinal gave an
encouraging come-from-behind
effort.
"We did come back on a night
when we weren't swinging the
bats," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "They gave us a lot of
opportunities; we didn't get any
really big hits."
After sophomore reliever
Tony Cogan pitched out of a jam
in the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford kept the momentum
and tied the game in the top of
the ninth.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer
walked with one out and the fol
lowing batter, senior first base
man Luke Quaccia, was hit by a
pitch. The pinch-runners, fresh
men Stephen Chan and Edmund
Muth, advanced 90 feet on a wild
pitch, and sophomore shortstop
Josh Hochgesang drove in the
tying run on a sacrifice fly to left
field. The Card left the bases
loaded, as it was unable to push
the go ahead run across the
plate.
In the bottom half of the
ninth inning, it was Fullerton's
leader, preseason All-American
C.J. Ankrum, who came through
under pressure. With a runner
on second base, Ankrum and
Cogan battled back and forth for
eight pitches. After fouling off
three offerings and working the
count full, Ankrum came
through with a game-winning
single to right field.
"Tony pitched extremely

well," Marquess said. "He
pitched to Ankrum very well;
C.J. is a very good hitter. They
came up with the big hit and we
didn't."
Charged from the heartbreak
ing loss the night before, the
Cardinal gave a spectacular
offensive show in game two Sat
urday. Stanford compiled 16 hits
for 15 runs, with 13 coming in
the first four innings.
Junior right fielder Joe Kil
burg led the offensive attack
with five RBIs, going 4 for 6 with
a home run, two doubles and a
single. Junior shortstop Jay
Pecci added two RBIs on three
hits, including a home run.
"Normally [Pecci and Kil
burg) are not going to hit for
power, but this is a hitter's ball
park," Marquess said. "We
swung the bats very well and
scored a lot of runs early."
Stanford came in with a bang,
scoring eight runs in the first
two innings. Five more runs

were added in the following two
innings, and the Cardinal tacked
on two more in the ninth.
Starter Jeff Austin, a sopho
more, had a solid outing, allow
ing five runs while striking out
five Titans. Junior Adam Harris
did a beautiful job closing out
the final two innings, allowing
no runs and only three hits.
Saturday "we showed we are
capable of doing some things,
and some of our younger players
will only get better as we go
along," Marquess said.
It was one of Stanford's rook
ies who provided much of the
offense in Sunday's 9-5 loss.
Freshman designated hitter
John Gall put on a hitting clinic,
going 5 for 5 with four singles
and blasting his second home
run of the season. Gall also had
two RBIs and scored two of the
Card's five runs.
Sophomore second baseman
and leadoff hitter Tony Schrager
did his job. reaching base four

times on three hits. Stanford
was unable to capitalize on many
scoring opportunities, leaving 12
runners on base in nine innings
of play.
The highly touted Cardinal
pitching staff did not play up to
expectations yesterday, allowing
eight earned runs and hitting
three batters. The defense's
four errors didn't help the
effort, in the frustrating loss in
which the balls just didn't seem
to fall the right way for the
Card. The score remained close
through the first four innings,
but Fullerton broke the game
open with a four-run fifth
inning.
After Fullerton pitcher Scott
Hild allowed Stanford five runs
in the first five innings, the
Titan bullpen shut down the
Cardinal offense, holding them
scoreless through the final four
innings of the game.

A heartbreaker, an earth
shaker and a frustrating wake
up call — all in one weekend?
The top-ranked Stanford
baseball team (3-2) traveled to
No. 12 Cal State-Fullerton (2-2)
this weekend for a three-game
series, perhaps better referred to
as a three-day roller-coaster
ride.
On Friday night, the Cardinal
battled back from a three-run
deficit, only to lose 6-5 in the
bottom of the ninth inning. Sat
urday evening saw the Stanford
offense take control in a convinc
ing 15-5 victory. In yesterday's
rubber game, the Fullerton
Titans did a 180-degree shift
from the night before, beating
Stanford 9-5 and winning the
series.
Despite losing the series
opener, the Cardinal gave an
encouraging come-from-behind
effort.
"We did come back on a night
when we weren't swinging the
bats," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "They gave us a lot of
opportunities; we didn't get any
really big hits."
After sophomore reliever
Tony Cogan pitched out of a jam
in the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford kept the momentum
and tied the game in the top of
the ninth.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer
walked with one out and the fol
lowing batter, senior first base
man Luke Quaccia, was hit by a
pitch. The pinch-runners, fresh
men Stephen Chan and Edmund
Muth, advanced 90 feet on a wild
pitch, and sophomore shortstop
Josh Hochgesang drove in the
tying run on a sacrifice fly to left
field. The Card left the bases
loaded, as it was unable to push
the go ahead run across the
plate.
In the bottom half of the
ninth inning, it was Fullerton's
leader, preseason All-American
C.J. Ankrum, who came through
under pressure. With a runner
on second base, Ankrum and
Cogan battled back and forth for
eight pitches. After fouling off
three offerings and working the
count full, Ankrum came
through with a game-winning
single to right field.
"Tony pitched extremely

well," Marquess said. "He
pitched to Ankrum very well;
C.J. is a very good hitter. They
came up with the big hit and we
didn't."
Charged from the heartbreak
ing loss the night before, the
Cardinal gave a spectacular
offensive show in game two Sat
urday. Stanford compiled 16 hits
for 15 runs, with 13 coming in
the first four innings.
Junior right fielder Joe Kil
burg led the offensive attack
with five RBIs, going 4 for 6 with
a home run, two doubles and a
single. Junior shortstop Jay
Pecci added two RBIs on three
hits, including a home run.
"Normally [Pecci and Kil
burg) are not going to hit for
power, but this is a hitter's ball
park," Marquess said. "We
swung the bats very well and
scored a lot of runs early."
Stanford came in with a bang,
scoring eight runs in the first
two innings. Five more runs

were added in the following two
innings, and the Cardinal tacked
on two more in the ninth.
Starter Jeff Austin, a sopho
more, had a solid outing, allow
ing five runs while striking out
five Titans. Junior Adam Harris
did a beautiful job closing out
the final two innings, allowing
no runs and only three hits.
Saturday "we showed we are
capable of doing some things,
and some of our younger players
will only get better as we go
along," Marquess said.
It was one of Stanford's rook
ies who provided much of the
offense in Sunday's 9-5 loss.
Freshman designated hitter
John Gall put on a hitting clinic,
going 5 for 5 with four singles
and blasting his second home
run of the season. Gall also had
two RBIs and scored two of the
Card's five runs.
Sophomore second baseman
and leadoff hitter Tony Schrager
did his job. reaching base four

times on three hits. Stanford
was unable to capitalize on many
scoring opportunities, leaving 12
runners on base in nine innings
of play.
The highly touted Cardinal
pitching staff did not play up to
expectations yesterday, allowing
eight earned runs and hitting
three batters. The defense's
four errors didn't help the
effort, in the frustrating loss in
which the balls just didn't seem
to fall the right way for the
Card. The score remained close
through the first four innings,
but Fullerton broke the game
open with a four-run fifth
inning.
After Fullerton pitcher Scott
Hild allowed Stanford five runs
in the first five innings, the
Titan bullpen shut down the
Cardinal offense, holding them
scoreless through the final four
innings of the game.
