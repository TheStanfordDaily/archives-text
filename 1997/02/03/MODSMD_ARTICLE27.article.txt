Revved for revenge and red hot for
redemption, the Stanford women's swim
ming team beat the fourth-ranked USC
Women of Troy 176-124 at the last home
meet of the season Saturday.
It was a very satisfying win for the top
ranked Cardinal, who avenged last year's
defeat to USC. It was Stanford's only loss
in its last 61 dual meets. The undefeated
Cardinal also outscored the lOth-ranked
Bruins 180.5-112.5 at deGuerre Pool on
Friday.
At the UCLA meet, junior Cardinal
swimmer Amy Oberhelman swept the 500-
and 1,000-yard distance freestyle events.
Junior Evi-Lynn Byer cleaned both the 200
backstroke and 200 butterfly, posting her
seasonal best in the latter with a time of 2
minutes, 3.42 seconds.
The cold and gloomy weather did not
stop the Cardinal team from having fun at
the meet. Swimmers Gabrielle Rose,
Catherine Fox and Sarah Anderson
crooned a Frank Sinatra rendition of
"Happy Birthday" to coach Richard Quick
who turned both blush and 54 on Friday.
Pumped and prepped to crush Troy,
many Cardinal swimmers posted their sea
sonal bests at the USC dual meet.
"We knew [USC] was going to be a hard
meet, so we were real excited and motivated
to swim hard and fast," said Fox, a fresh
man.
Fox, who holds eight NCAA qualifying
times, swam a seasonal best of 53.89 in
the 100-yard backstroke, breaking 1994
Stanford graduate Lea Loveless' pool
record.

In the 50-yard free, Fox dolphin-kicked
for more than a lap underwater and easily
cruised to first place (22.92).
Troy swimmer Kristine Quance, ranked
first in the country in the 400 individual
medley, broke the pool record by about five
seconds, surpassing Stanford's Janel Jor
gensen (Class of' 93).
Junior Elin Austevoll set the tone for a
Cardinal victory early in the meet when
she defeated USC's Quance in the 100-
yard breaststroke. Austevoll's winning
time of 1:02.89, her fastest this season,
made a "big difference to team morale,"
Quick said.
Austevoll, who has consistently dropped
her time in the 200-yard breaststroke at
her last three meets, also posted her sea
sonal best in the event (2:14.52).
The second turnaround of the meet
came in the 100 free where the Cardinal
clinched the four top spots. Senior sprinter
Claudia Franco claimed first-place honors
with a time of 50.88, her lowest mark this
season.
Stanford's A team, which consists of
four Olympians who each represented a dif
ferent country, dropped a hundredth of a
second in the 400 medley relay (3:41.32) for
another seasonal top finish. The medley
team currently ranks first in the event in
intercollegiate swimming.
At the UCLA meet, sophomore Carissa
Zenorini placed third in the one-meter div
ing event (162.45) and second in the three
meter diving event (183.50).
USC's German Olympian Dorte Lindner
won both the one-meter and three-meter
events on Saturday. Senior Megan Gardner
and Zenorini placed second and third in
both events, respectively.
