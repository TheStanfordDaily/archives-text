# ASSU judiciary nominees see council as a 'watchdog'
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Three nominees for the newly created ASSU Con
stitutional Council may clear the final obstacle to
their confirmation at tomorrow's ASSU Senate
meeting.
The students, nominated by ASSU President Bill
Shen, must be approved by two-thirds of the senate.
They will exert judicial review over the actions of the
president and senate.
Sophomores Katherine Wray and Robert Windom
are among the nominees, and both anticipate an Im
provement in way student government functions
when the council finally convenes.
Windom said it will be "the watchdog on campus."
"It's not going to cover things like cheating on
tests, but it will take a look at the problems within
the ASSU," he said.
Hypothetically, he suggested, if the ASSU spoke
in favor of a particular political candidate on behalf of
Stanford students, that action would warrant the
council's scrutiny.
Wray cited instances in the ASSU's past that
would have warranted the council's intervention.
She described an instance when former ASSU
senate chair and current council nominee Nawwar
Kasrawi discounted the results of a senate vote with
which he personally disagreed.
"It was declared an unofficial vote because the
people who voted weren't wearing their ASSU sweat
shirts at the time," Wray said. "It stated in the old
Constitution that senators were required to wear the
sweatshirts, but before then that rule had never been
invoked. The Constitutional Council would be re
sponsible for looking at cases like that and deciding
what the intent of the Constitution would rule in
that situation."
She said that although outdated and irrelevant
rules like the sweatshirt provision have been elimi
nated in the new constitution, there remains a need
for judicial oversight.
Windom and Wray are considering studying polit
ical science and going to law school. Both candidates
became interested in the position through public ad
vertisements earlier this year.
Shen has extensively praised his nominees' skills.

Windom "will bring a great deal to the council,"
Shen said. "He is very analytical and has an excellent
understanding of our constitution."
Wray "is a dynamo," he added. "She is just incred
ible."

The Daily will profile the other two nominees, junior
Ben Decker and doctoral student Nawwar Kasrawi.
