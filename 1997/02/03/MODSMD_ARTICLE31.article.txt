# Peace Corps takes first S. Africa trip
## Stanford alum among 34 volunteers hoping to ease effects of apartheid 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Ronald Wietecha will be a long way from Palo
Alto when he joins 33 other Peace Corps volun
teers on an unprecedented service trip to South
Africa in February.
Wietecha, who graduated from Stanford in
1993 and received his master's in 1994, hopes to
"make a difference in the lives of a few people,
even if it can't erase the effects of apartheid."
Selected to participate in the first Peace
Corps partnership with South Africa, Wietecha
will volunteer for two years as a school and com
munity development advisor, helping to empow
er teachers in the most rural areas of the North
ern Province.
An agreement made between Nelson Man
dela and President Clinton in October 1994 es
tablished a deal between the two nations to co
operate in rebuilding a democratic, nonracial so
ciety. The Peace Corps is one of the groups which
has been mobilized to aid the effort in the former

homelands of South Africa, the land to which
much of the native black population was forcibly
relocated during apartheid.
The first step to restoring the communities
will begin with revamping the dire conditions of
the educational system.
"The mostly black townships were governed
under an official polity of neglect," Weitecha
said. "Teachers in the schools were never for
mally trained. They learned on the job or recalled
the teachers they once had. The system being
used is similar to the British and European
model, formal and based on drill-and-kill memo
rization."
Though lack of funding for the schools cannot
be changed only through Peace Corps work, vol
unteers like Wietecha hope to guide teachers to
develop more efficient teaching strategies and
use what resources they do have to the fullest.
Strategies common to American schools, such as
cooperative and team learning exercises, will be
part of the new curriculum implemented in
schools.

Wietecha has concentrated on the field of ed
ucation since graduation. He applied the mas
ter's in education he earned through the Stan
ford Teacher Education Program to teach
physics and chemistry in Fremont and later
Burlingame High School. But after two years in
the classroom, Wietecha said he realized he en
joys "working more with the teachers who are
teaching kids."
Hesitant to work in a corporate environ
ment, Wietecha found the outlet when he re
called that his mother had once served in the
Peace Corps.
After a long application process which began
last spring, Wietecha was notified that he would
be part of a historic transition in international
relations as a member of the Peace Corps. To Wi
etecha, the honor of the selection seems to be
outweighed by the task ahead of him. But, he
says, "My philosophy is that learningand change
occur at the individual level. I'll be happy if when
I leave, someone says, 'You know that Ameri
can? I'm glad he came.' "
