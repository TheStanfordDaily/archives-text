# Park withdraws nomination to Constitutional Council
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
In an e-mail message to ASSU President Bill
Shen on Thursday, Eugene Park withdrew from
confirmation proceedings for the ASSU Constitu
tional Council.
Park, a junior and editor of the Chaparral, cited
time constraints as his reason from dropping out.
He was scheduled to be interviewed by the senate's
Administration and Rules Committee this evening.
His nomination would have then moved to the sen
ate floor — possibly as early as tomorrow.
"This quarter is a very tough quarter for me and
as the nomination process was closing in, I decided
that I didn't have the time," Park said.
Park was one of five people nominated to sit on
the judicial panel that interprets the ASSU Consti
tution. Council members are nominated by the
president and approved by the senate and serve
until graduation or resignation.
Park also indicated he lacked a clear under
standing of the position when he accepted the nom
ination.
"I found out about the job and I didn't exactly
know what it entailed because I didn't get my hands
on a copy of the constitution," Park said." But when
we met — the five nominees — and discussed what
the constitutional council would be, I became more
and more uninterested in the posi
tion," Park said.
When Park finally read the con
stitution, he said he discovered the
council's primary business would be
deciphering textual contradictions
and would not delve into matters of
weighty philosophy — Park's major.
"The decisions only require a lit
tle insight," he said. "You just need
an understanding of the constitu
tion."
Shen greeted the news with
mixed feelings.
"Obviously I was disappointed.
Eugene was qualified in every re
spect," Shen said. "But I have to re
spect his decision."
It remains unclear how Park's
withdrawal will affect the senate's
deliberations or the progress toward
seating a council.

According to the constitution,
only four members need to be pre
sent in order to consider an issue.
If, however, the senate rejects
one of Shen's nominees, it would
prevent the council from convening
until another member could be se
lected, interviewed and approved —
a process which has taken four
months thus far.
Two of Shen's appointees pose
potential problems for the timely
seating of the council.
Former Senate Chair Nawwar
Kasrawi, a doctoral student in elec
trical engineering, has many detrac
tors in the senate and faces an uphill
battle to win confirmation.
Junior Ben Decker has yet to be
interviewed by the committee and
has been challenged on his close as
sociation with Shen.
The senate will meet tomorrow
to consider winter quarter general
fee appropriations and is unlikely to
definitively resolve the issue at that
time.
