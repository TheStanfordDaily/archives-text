The Association of American Law Schools has
named Law Prof. Deborah Rhode as its new presi
dent.
"I am very excited about Deborah's presidency,"
said association Executive Director Carl Monk. "She
brings to this position a rare combination of thought
fulness about the legal profession and enthusiasm for
improving legal education." Rhode has spent several
years working for the association, including three years
on its executive committee.
Rhode already has plans on how to use her position
to improve the legal process. She said she wants to ad
dress problems both with the teaching of legal ethics
and the uneven distribution of legal services.
"Most universities compress the teaching of legal
ethics into a single course," Rhode said. "As students
tend to focus more on gaining employment, these
courses are often taught to empty seats and empty
minds." Rhode said she would like to see legal ethics be
come an integral part of the entire legal education

process.
Rhode would also like to help increase the distribu
tion of legal services. She said she thinks universities
can make a difference through programs such as
mandatory pro bono work.
"Stanford ranks favorable in both these areas
when compared to other institutions, but we still
could use a lot of work," Rhode said. She added that
Stanford helps to distribute legal services in East Palo
Alto, and the Law School offers good legal ethics
courses, but she said she doesn't feel people fully uti
lize these programs.
Rhode hopes her new position will help her imple
ment her ideas by giving her a captive audience of more
than 7,000 legal educators from 160 different schools.
She is, however, going to reduce her workload at Stan
ford in order to meet the increased demands.
Rhode plans to teach half-time next year and hopes
to continue teaching some courses throughout her
term. She said she feels the Law School has a well-sup
ported staff and the University is very accommodat
ing in allowing flexible teaching schedules.
