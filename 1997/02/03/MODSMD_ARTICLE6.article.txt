# Post office plagued by inconsistent delivery
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The inconsistency of mail delivery time to
boxes at the Stanford post office was apparent in
a recent experiment conducted by The Daily.
Various members of The Daily's staff asked
parents or friends from around the country to
mail letters and packages to their Stanford mail
boxes.
Some mail, both first-class and priority mail,
arrived well within three mailing days — the time
for delivery as advertised on signs at the post of
fice. Both a letter and a priority package arrived in
only one day from Sacramento.
A priority package from IjOS Angeles and a let
ter from Los Alamos, N.M., arrived in only two
days, and priority packages arrived in three days
from Austin, Texas; Allentown, Ga.; Cincinnati,
Ohio; and Los Alamos. A letter also arrived from
Austin, Texas, in three days.
However, the bulk of the mail timed during the
study took four days or more — longer than the
posted time. Letters from Portland, Ore., Provo,
Utah and Millburn, N.J. arrived in
four days, as did priority mailings
from Provo; Portland, Ore.; and
Portland, Maine.
First-class letters from Allen -
town, Pa., and Portland, Maine,
took five mailing days. One letter,
from Wellfleet, Mass., took seven
mailing days to arrive.
"The only thing consistent
about the post office is that they
are consistently inconsistent," said
ASSU President Bill Shen.
Some mail that was sent as a
part of the experiment has not ar
rived. A letter from Cincinnati —
mailed at the same time as the pri
ority package that arrived in three
days — has not yet arrived. All
items were mailed on Jan. 21.
ASSU Senator Emily Andrus,
who has had several meetings with

Jim Ruiz, the Stanford post office
station manager, said the results
do not surprise her at all, as she has
heard a number of complaints
from students about the inconsis
tent mail delivery time.
"I am really not surprised, but
having done the research, I have a
new understanding of what is going
on," Andrus said. "Really, [the slow
delivery time] is not something the
post office can control."
Shen emphasized that the mail
delivery problems must be solved.
"It is time for the University,
the post office, and the students to
sit down and find a reliable, de
pendable solution to the post of
fice's delivery problems," Shen
said. "It needs to happen now.
"I am a bit surprised that we're
not hearing more about an aggres
sive attempt from the University
and the Stanford Management Co.
on locking in an new lease. What
more do the respective parties
need?"
