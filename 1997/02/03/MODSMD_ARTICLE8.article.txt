## Events aim to promote positive image, self-esteem 
### Erika Check 
Body Image Awareness Week kicked off last night,
beginning a series of discussions and workshops
aimed at celebrating "our bodies and those who have
learned to appreciate them," according to Coordinat
ing Committee member Antonia Welch, a freshman.
Fellow committee member Stacie Carney, a senior
explained the goal of t he week is not only to focus on
eating disorders but also to "shift body image from a
negative to a positive aspect of our lives."
With that in mind, members of the Women's Col
lective's Body Image, Food and Self-Esteem Group
have planned a broad range of events, including
dance movement and yoga workshops tonight and a
panel discussion tomorrow night by professionals in
the field of self-image and body awareness.
Group discussions tomorrow and Wednesday will
give students a chance to talk about their own per
spectives on body image. The week concludes Thurs
day with a performance by members of the Women's
Performance Collective, Jam Pac'd and Los Decanos.
Admission for all events is free.
Carney said the discussions and presentations
have been organized to make students realize they
are not alone if they are having trouble with body
image problems such as eating disorders. She called
Body Image Awareness Week an opportunity for
everyone to realize that "almost all of us deal with
body image in some way."
Senior Karen Felzer, who is also a member of the
Coordinating Committee, agreed. "A lot of people
have self-doubt," she said. She hopes students will
help students arrive at an "understanding that other

people are dealing with the same issues they are."
According to committee member Amy
Wertheimer, a sophomore, the week includes a vari
ety of approaches that attempt to make students
think about both mental and physical issues related
to body awareness. She was inspired to create the
dance and yoga workshops after she took an aerobics
class taught by Stanford aerobics instructor Kate
Coughlin. She said Coughlin made her realize that
what counts is "not just how your body looks but what
you can do with it."
While body image problems are not unique to
Stanford, Welch thinks students may have special
difficulty dealing with these problems. "We go to a
school which emphasizes separation into categories
â€” academic, physical and emotional," she said, "but
those all come together in one person." She said she
hopes Body Image Awareness Week will help stu
dents "reunite the mind and body instead of separat
ing and objectifying them."
Wertheimer said college students also have
unique problems with body image because most lit
erature on the topic focuses on adolescents. "We are
not adolescents anymore," she explained. "We need
to treat people as adults who think about these
things in an adult way."
Welch also emphasized the positive nature of the
week, which ends with a performance exhibition on a
note of "joyful triumph" instead of pessimism.
Felzer cited the ASSU, Counseling and Psycho
logical Science, and Serra House as sponsors. She
thanked Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds, whom she characterized as "extremely sup
portive" in helping the group plan the week.
