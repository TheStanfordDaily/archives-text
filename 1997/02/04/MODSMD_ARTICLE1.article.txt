## Children tour Farm after fire guts school 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Students from the fire-ravaged Green Oaks Ele
mentary School visited the Stanford campus yester
day while part of their school was being rebuilt.
A fire destroyed eight classrooms and forced
the evacuation of 350 children on Jan. 13. Divided
according to grade level, students are either tem
porarily attending nearby schools or taking field
trips. Stanford was on the list of trip sites which
include the Natural Academy of Science, the
Steinhart Aquarium and the Coyote Park and
Museum.
Arriving on campus by bus, a fourth-grade class
and a special education class took a two-hour walk,
visiting some of Stanford's most popular attrac
tions. Using the tour as a learning experience, stu
dents used their map-reading skills in order to find
their way around, said Nina Maiden, a special edu
cation teacher.
The tour included visits to Luke Lagunita,
Tresidder Union and Memorial Church, but the trip
to the top of Hoover Tower seemed to be everyone's
favorite. "I was scared to go up there," said Alexis
Wortham, a student.
After eating sack lunches in the Okada lounge,
children were given the opportunity to play soccer
and Frisbee with Stanford students and a few were
taken to the track, said Eileen Lai, Green Oaks pro
ject coordinator.
The outpouring of help after the fire's aftermath
has been incredible, Lai said. "So many people have
come together and donated money for field trips,"
she added. Northface, a company which produces
school bags, donated backpacks for the kids who lost
their belongings in the fire.
Members of several public service groups such
as Ravenswood Tutoring Program, Public Service
Scholars Program and Stanford In Government,
led students on the campus tour. Kappa Sigma
