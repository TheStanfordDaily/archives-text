BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Police
chased student demonstrators down streets,
through stores and into university buildings
yesterday, beating them and dragging some
away in a second day of violence against anti
government protesters.
Opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic
avoided a larger, jnore dangerous confronta
tion yesterday afternoon by moving tens of
thousands of people away from a police cor
don.
Yesterday evening, smaller groups of
protesters met at different points across the
city for their noisy evening marches. Isolated
beatings and arrests were reported.
In Washington yesterday, the United
States accused Milosevic of unleashing
"goons" on pro-democracy demonstrators,
saying the brutality would only worsen Ser

bia's political crisis.
"It is strange to see still in Central Europe
. . . that there are authoritarian figures who
deploy these security goons to beat up
democrats," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said, urging restraint.
An off-duty American embassy Marine
guard was and beaten by the riot
police, Burns said. •
The violence has increased since Sunday,
but it is unclear whether force is how Milose
vic ultimately plans to end the protests, which
have been held daily for 76 days. His tactics
have varied, including silent tolerance, legal
maneuvering and force.
Late Sunday and early yesterday, police
beat protesters at a Belgrade bridge, fired tear
gas and sprayed water cannons. About 80 peo
ple were injured; police reported 18 arrests.

The protests began when Milosevic refused
to recognize the opposition's victories in
municipal elections Nov. 17, but they have
swelled into wider demands for democratic
reforms.
Leaders of the movement gained new sup
port yesterday from prominent actors and the
Serbian OrthodoxXhurch, but Milosevic indi-.
cated his tough lin£ would continue.
"All those who think that they can achieve
terrorist goals with terrorist acts should draw
a clear conclusion that our state will not let
Serbia become a testing range for terrorism,"
he said.
Milosevic was addressing his top security
officials after what the state-run Tanjug news
agency said was an anti-terrorist operation in
Serbia's southern Kosovo province. It said 66
people were rounded up.
