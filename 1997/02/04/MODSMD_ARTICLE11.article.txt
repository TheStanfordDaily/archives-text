VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) - An ex
convict surrendered yesterday to
face charges he masterminded a
series of bombings to thwart a
drug trial that could have put him
behind bars for 25 years to life.
Kevin Lee Robinson, 29, was
taken into custody in a "negotiated
surrender," said Vallejo Police
Chief Robert Nichelini at a hastily
called news conference.
"We have arrested the No. 1
suspect in this matter, Kevin
Robinson," said Nichelini at
around 2:30 p.m. "He was arrested
five minutes ago in a negotiated
surrender."
"We're quite happy," he added.
"We're happy to have him off the
streets."
Nichelini said police met Robin
son on the street at a prearranged
location and brought him back to
the Vallejo police station for ques
tioning. Nichelini said he was to be
transferred to a jail in nearby Fair
field later in the day.
"None of this makes any sense,"
he said. "But desperate people do
desperate things."
Robinson, whose name first
surfaced Sunday, allegedly hired
several men to disrupt the Solano
County court system by planting
bombs in a bid to postpone a "third
strike" trial on cocaine charges
that could have sent him to prison
for 25 years to life. The trial would
have begun yesterday.
"Apparently his thought pro
cess was this would somehow stop
the trial," Nichelini said earlier.
Police Lt. Ron Jackson said the
men were hired "for drugs or
money" to cany out the bombings.
Some 75 police detectives and fed
eral agents were involved in the
hunt for the bombers, he said.
He said police received 175 tele
phone tips in the case.
Three men, including two
brothers, were arrested on Sun
day. Alftfth man, yeC unidenti
fied, remained at large yesterday.
Nichelini said the case was
solved in part by those tips from
the public.
"People talk," he said. "People
(like us) get together and we talk
about our new cars and 1 guess
when criminals get together, they
talk about their new dynamite."
Federal agents, who confiscated
more than 500 pounds of stolen
dynamite Sunday, were confident

the bombings that destroyed three
bank teller machines and blasted a
crater in the side of a courthouse
wall in Vallejo last week were over.
They are still searching for anoth
er cache of explosives, possibly up
to 100 pounds.
Nobody was hurt in the bomb
ings.
Francis Ernestberg, 40, was
arrested in a residential neighbor
hood in Vallejo early Sunday.
Oston Osotonu, 24, was taken into
custody at a nearby motel Sunday
afternoon, authorities said.
The three face felony conspira
cy, burglary and explosive device
charges, with a maximum sen
tence of 160 years in prison.
Dan Russo, an attorney repre
senting Robinson in the drug case,
did not return several rails to his
office requesting comment. It was
not clear if he would also represent
Robinson in the bombing case.
Police also arrested Osotonu's
brother Ivan, who was charged
only with possession of explosives.
Ernestberg "was the one with
the construction background relat
ed to the dynamite," Jackson said.
Both Ernestberg and Oston
Osotonu had police records, he
added.
Mike Morrissey of the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms bureau in
San Francisco said the break in the
case came in part from a trace put
on dynamite found at the county
library Jan. 25.
The dynamite was tracked to its
legal owner, a construction compa
ny in the Bay Area Jackson said
Ernestberg had worked for the
construction company from which
the dynamite was stolen.
"It was misappropriated," Mor
rissey said. That in turn led to
Ernestberg, but police refused to
discuss the connection further.
Just prior to the arrests, inves
tigators found 61 sticks of wired
dynamite in the trunk of a car
parked outside a Vallejo apartment
complex early Sunday morning,
police Sgt. Dave Johnson said.
Investigators speculated that
the bomb was intended for a sec
ond effort at the county library,
where some police evidence is
stored in the basement, Jackson
said. However, he said evidence in
the drug case against Robinson
had already been moved to the
courthouse.
