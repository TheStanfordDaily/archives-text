# No to death penalty
## Lawyers' group seeks moratorium on the punishment 
### 
SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Com
plaining of unfairness, the Amer
ican Bar Association urged a
nationwide moratorium on the
death penalty yesterday despite
opposition from its own president
and the Clinton administration.
The ABA's House of Dele
gates, which makes policy for the
nation's largest group of lawyers,
voted 280-119.
Leaders of the 370,000-lawyer
organization were told that cur
rent death-penalty systems are
marred by unfairness and racial
injustice.
Richmond, Va., lawyer Robert
Gray told his colleagues, "As rep
rehensible as a capital crime is, it
is equally unacceptable to admin
ister the ultimate punishment in
a racially discriminatory way."
Another supporter, Washing
ton lawyer Estelle Rogers, said
the organization was not taking a
position on the death penalty
itself. Instead, she said, "We're
calling on every jurisdiction .. .
to clean up its act."
Neither the federal govern
ment nor any state has in place a

system of capital punishment
that meets the ABA's standard of
fairness, she said.
"This tells the nation that the
death penalty, as it is now admin
istered, is systematically unfair,"
added New York lawyer Ron
Tabak, an architect of the mea
sure.
The resolution was approved
following a 45-minute debate
during which a high-ranking
Clinton administration lawyer
and the ABA's current president
urged defeat of the measure.
Deputy Attorney General
Jamie Gorelick voiced concern
that the resolution, which
becomes the focus of ABA lobby
ing efforts in Congress and state
legislatures, would affect pending
cases involving domestic terror
ism.
The government has decided
to seek the death penalty for two
men accused in the bombing of
an Oklahoma City federal build
ing and is considering doing so in
the Unabomber case.
ABA President Lee Cooper, a
Birmingham, Ala., lawyer,

accused the resolution's backers
of having a secret agenda.
"What you really have here is
an up-or-down vote on the death
penalty," he said. "Folks, bring it
in the front door. Don't come in
the back door."
Cooper urged the ABA's lead
ers "not to get out of step with
the White House, the Justice
Department, the nation and our
membership."
But Boston lawyer John
Curtin, a former ABA president,
said there was an "appalling
risk" of executing innocent peo
ple. In a booming voice, he
declared: "Why should we be in
front? Because it is the right
thing to do."
Former Attorney General
Benjamin Civiletti agreed. "If we
do not stand up for the assurance
of basic rights . . . who will?" he
asked.
A report that accompanied the
resolution contended that a
moratorium was needed because
"efforts to forge a fair capital
punishment jurisprudence have
failed."
