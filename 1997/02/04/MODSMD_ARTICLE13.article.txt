WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton praised
Peruvian leader Alberto Fujimori yesterday for "skill
fully walking a fine line" in handling Peru's hostage
crisis even as Fujimori worried about how it might
end.
"Because they are terrorists ... it's almost unpre
dictable," Fujimori said after his White House meeting
to discuss the 7-week-old standoff. 'We don't know.
We cannot predict."
Bolstered by U.S. support, Fujimori pledged to
make no concessions to the captors holding 72 inter
national hostages at the Japanese Embassy in Lima.
Rebel leader Nestor Cerpa, meanwhile, chastised
Fujimori for hinting over the weekend that the guer
rillas were willing to give up their goal.
"It is absolutely false that we have renounced our
demand for the liberation of our prisoners, a point that
must be addressed in eventual conversations" with the
government, Cerpa said, speaking by radio from the
diplomatic compound.
No matter what, Fujimori said, he would never give
in to demands from the rebels, who have been seeking
the liberation of several hundred jailed comrades. Giv
ing in, he said, would set a bad precedent for other
nations.
"This is important, not only to Peru but to Ameri
ca and the world," Fujimori said during an hour-long
news conference. "This kind of crime cannot be accept
ed. All terrorists in the world must know they cannot
have any concessions.
"In English, I will say, Its out of the question."
During a hastily scheduled 20-minute Oval Office
meeting Clinton urged Fujimori to seek a peaceful
solution without bowing to terrorism, White House

officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger also
attended.
White House spokesman David Johnson said Clin
ton wanted to meet Fujimori to tell him he had "set
exactly the right tone" in handling the crisis.
Clinton told Fujimori "that he thought he was skill -
fully walking a veiy fine line — and that is between
resolving this crisis peacefully without giving into ter
rorism," Johnson said. "He told him it was a hard line
to walk, but it was the right one."
The meeting, agreed to only on Sunday, ran
counter to U.S. concerns last week that Clinton's
direct involvement in the crisis would increase the
value of the 72 hostages. No Americans are being held.
Fujimori told reporters he was pleased by his White
House reception because Clinton "pledged his contin
ued exceptional support."
Over the weekend, Fujimori also talked with Cana
dian officials, who had arranged a meeting in Toronto
between the Peruvian president and Japanese Prime
Minister Rvutaro Hashimoto. Fujimori won Japanese
praise for promising not to provoke the guerrillas, who
have been holding hostages in the Japanese ambas
sador's residence in Lima since Dec. 17.
Previously, Hashimoto had questioned recent
Peruvian security force maneuvers around the ambas
sador's residence. In one incident, commandos made
obscene gestures at the compound, drawing rebel gun
fire.
About 20 Tupac Amaru rebels seized the compound
in a raid on a gala cocktail party of more than 500
guests, including some Americans. They released all
but 72 hostages.
