High approval ratings for Clinton
NEW YORK (AP) — Six in 10 Americans approve
of President Clinton's job performance, unchanged
since the election and a much more positive assess
ment than the public gives Congress, according to a
poll released yesterday.
The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found Congress
with 36 percent job approval, compared with Clin
ton's 60 percent. Despite all the ethical questions
that have been raised about Clinton's fund-raising,
twice as many people view him favorably as unfavor
ably, the poll said.
A majority had more confidence in Clinton than
the Republicans in Congress to handle welfare, but
the two sides were rated about even on taxes, and
Clinton had only a slight advantage over his GOP
foes on the economy and foreign affairs.
In general, 48 percent want Clinton to have more
influence over the nation's direction and 39 percent

want the Republicans to take the lead. Nine percent
suggest the two sides share influence equally; the
rest are undecided.
Gallup said it interviewed 1,056 adults by phone
Friday through Sunday. Results have a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Judge denies mistrial request
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) The judge in the
O.J. Simpson case denied another defense mistrial
request yesterday, dismissing fears that a juror poi
soned the panel against Simpson before she was
removed for misconduct.
The juror, who had been the only black on the
panel, was removed Friday for failing to disclose that
her daughter works for the district attorney's office
that unsuccessfully prosecuted Simpson on murder
charges.
Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki rejected

the written request, as he had an earlier spoken
request Friday, saying he remedied the problem by
appointing an alternate and ordering the panel to
start deliberating anew.
The reconstituted panel, which deliberated five
hours Friday, spent another six hours in delibera
tions yesterday before recessing for the night.
Also rejected by the judge was defense attorney
Robert Baker's request to question the jurors to find
out what 6'2-vear-old Rosemary Caraway told them
before she was bounced. Fujisaki said Baker could
question the jurors after they reach a verdict.
Baker said research over the weekend showed
Caraway had scratched out on her jury questionnaire
an answer that would have divulged her daughter's
ties to the prosecutor's office.
Asked if anybody close to her had legal training,
she began an answer regarding a relative but crossed
it out, he said, adding that the scratched-out words
were "District Attorney's Office."

On a question in which she was asked if any close
friends or relatives were employed by the attorney
general or the district attorney, Baker said Caraway
checked "no."
Apple to reorganize, lay off 3,000
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Apple Computer Inc.,
struggling to stanch the flow of red ink, is expected to
lay off up to 3,000 employees and shed unprofitable
businesses in its latest reorganization.
The troubled personal computer company likely
will announce its plans before its annual sharehold
ers' meeting later this week, industry observers pre
dicted yesterday.
Apple, which revamped its operations last year,
decided to do so again last month after losing $120
million on falling sales in the October-December
quarter — usually the strongest period for personal
computer companies.
