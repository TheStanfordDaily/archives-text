ASSU should not allow
Kasrawi to take position
on Constitutional Council

WHEN THE ASSU Senate
votes on whether to
approve nominations to
the ASSU's Constitutional Council,
as it will for one student tonight, it
must carefully consider to whom it
is awarding such vast power.
A body created by the new ASSU
Constitution, the council would be
responsible for interpreting possi
ble violations of the constitution
and its bylaws — a weighty task
and one that requires council
members to have both a good
understanding of the document
and an impartial mind.
The candidates nominated by
ASSU President Bill Shen have
varying experience with the judicia
ry process and the ASSU. Some
aspire to be lawyers; others have a
long-standing history of involve
ment with student government.
The senate's Administration and
Rules Committee must be com
mended for its extensive research
into the candidates' qualifications.
Based on that, the senate now is
charged with determining whether
those qualifications are sufficient.
Even without doing any home
work, however, there is one candi
date who stands out as a bad choice.
Nawwar Kasrawi's long history
with the ASSU is one filled with
constitutional violations, question
able ethics and a general lack of
maturity. So extensive are his past
problems that when asked to
describe a potential situation that
might come before the council,
nominee Katherine VVray unknow
ingly referred to her fellow candi
date's actions.
Wray cited an incident two years
ago when Kasrawi — now a doctor
al student in electrical engineering
— was senate chair. After an initia
tive he favored failed by only a few
votes, Kasrawi disqualified two

senators because they were not
wearing the required senate uni
form, a gray sweatshirt reading,
"I'm an ASSU senator, silly." The
vote was then taken again, and the
resolution passed.
Although the rule requiring
sweatshirts to be worn during meet
ings had been amended to the
ASSU Constitution, Kasrawi's act
reflected the first time it had ever
been enforced. Then-ASSU Senator
Steve Russell told The Daily at the
time that Kasrawi's 1994 action
was"the most colossal abuse of sen
ate power in recent senate history."
Another senator serving at the
time accused Kasrawi of "selective
enforcement of the constitution
when it's convenient."
And that's not where it ends.
In his first year at Stanford, Kas
rawi sent an illegal e-mail to 2,000
people plugging himself and several
other senate candidates, which tied
up campus computer resources and
violated both ASSU election bylaws
and Stanford comuting policies. He
eventually withdrew from the race.
Kasrawi's nomination, too. is
circumspect.
During a brief hiatus from his
time at Stanford, Kasrawi worked
in Arizona, leaving his Jeep Chero
kee with Shen — who made good
use of it during his campaigns last
year, first for Council of Presidents
and later for ASSU president.
Furthermore, Kasrawi was
among the most vociferous oppo
nents of the new constitution when
it was passed last year. One must
then question how great his com
mitment can be to protecting its
integrity and ensuring compliance
with its provisions.
The creation of a judiciary
branch of the ASSU is an impor
tant step toward checking the
power of the senate and the presi
dent. Especially with a new consti
tution, many interpretations could
easily be drowned in infighting and
political maneuvering. There is lit
tle hope for rational and unbiased
decisions without a Constitutional
Council consisting of rational and
unbiased members.
