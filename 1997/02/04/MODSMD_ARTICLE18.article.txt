## An open letter to Stanford students 
### 
Gerhard Casper

I HAVE RECEIVED
an identical letter
from 711 students
asking for"the option of
giving to the Socially
Responsible Endowment
Fund." The letter states:
"Stanford has the
responsibility to listen to
students . . . who are
now calling for the

establishment of a fund which invests
only in companies supporting human
rights, sound environmental policies and
fair employment practices."
Administrators, faculty and staff,
indeed, have a responsibility to listen to
students. Likewise, students — and espe
cially students' elected representatives —
have a responsibility to seek information
and understanding before acting.
I have been clear and forthright about
my views with ASSU President Bill Shen
and Vice President Nick Thompson, who
are promoting this fund, and in my most
recent open meeting with students. I take
this opportunity to reach more students.
First and foremost, the Stanford Fund,
including the Senior Class Gift, has noth
ing to do with endowment or investment
policy. Stanford Fund money is not endow
ment; it is raised, held temporarily and
then spent. For what? Undergraduate
needs. Last year, 60 percent — $3.1 million
— went to scholarships. So, if there are stu
dents who believe that financial aid does
not matter, they can hamper the Stanford

Fund. If there are students who want to
forfeit matching funds offered by parents
and the Bing Challenge, the way to do it is
to not participate in the Senior Class Gift.
Second, let us be specific. References to
"the University" or "the administration"
are so vague as to lose all meaning. The
responsibility for setting investment poli
cies lies primarily with the Board of
Trustees, which has a Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility chaired by
Trustee Roger Clay.
A recent handout headlined "Support
the Socially Responsible Investment Fund"
states that "Without even looking at the
proposal, the University rejected" the idea
Compare that with the opening of the writ
ten reply Clay previously had sent to Shen
and Thompson: "We would like to com
mend you and other students who partici
pated in developing and presenting this
concept. We recognize the considerable
time spent in researching the proposal and
appreciate the revisions that were made in
response to many of the concerns
raised... . After taking into consideration
the concerns which still remain ... we have
concluded that we cannot support the
development of such a fund."
Clay went on to detail six reasons why
the committee came to that conclusion.
Space permits me to deal with just one of
those reasons: The proposal links the
University's fund-raising needs to mak
ing political statements.
The form letter I quoted in my opening
paragraph lists three very abstractly stated

causes. I agree with the causes, but who
will make the judgments about what fur
thers those causes and which companies
investing in what countries should be tar
geted in what way? What should be our pri
orities? What should the trade-ofTs be? As
concerns human rights, for instance,
should the University choose between
"freedom of choice" and"the right to life"?
Permit me to conclude with an impor
tant point — a point opposed by those who
want to leverage universities for their own
purposes. I stated it at my inauguration
and believe it belongs to the bedrock princi
ples that must guide universities.
Members of a university community
must not shy away from the social and polit
ical issues of their time. Service to the pub
lic is their freedom, indeed their obligation.
A university's freedom and obligation
are to provide a forum for the most search
ing and candid discussion of public issues.
But as one of the century's foremost First
Amendment scholars, the late Harry Kal
ven, said, a university "cannot take collec
tive action on the issues of the day without
endangering the conditions for its existence
and effectiveness. There is no mechanism
by which it can reach a collective position
without inhibiting that full freedom of dis
sent on which it thrives." This viewpoint
arises "not out of a lack of courage nor out
of indifference and insensitivity. It arises
out of respect for free inquiry and the obli
gation to cherish a diversity of viewpoints."
