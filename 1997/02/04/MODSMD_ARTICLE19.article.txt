VA doctors' removal does not involve 'academic freedom 9

I AM WRITING in response to the
recent letter from Dr. Brant Wene
grat concerning working conditions
in the Palo Alto VA Medical Center and
raising issue of "academic freedom." The
matters in dispute are important, but
they are complicated by circumstances
peculiar to academic medicine which
may not be self-evident to readers from
other parts of the University.
In the aftermath of World War 11, tht
leadership of the Veterans Administra
tion, facing the challenge of providing
medical care to huge numbers of return
ing veterans, issued a policy memoran
dum that called for fostering the close
affiliations of VA hospitals with aca
demic medical centers.
The policy was contained in a
remarkably sparse document that did
not attempt to spell out elaborate
details of the desired relationships but
rather placed great faith in the good
intentions and common sense of the
VA and academic leaders who would
implement affiliation agreements at
the level of the individual institutions.
The affiliation policy offered to VA hos
pitals the prospect of securing the ser
vices of a superior cadre of physicians,
as well as medical students, residents,
fellows and an academic environment
of education and research.
For Stanford's freshly transplanted
School of Medicine, the proximity of the
newly opened Palo Alto VA Medical Cen
ter afforded both institutions an oppor
tunity to avail themselves of the affilia
tion policy and over the ensuing decades
the symbiotic relationship between the

two institutions flourished. The VA Cen
ter became recognized as one of the best
in the entire VA system; the affiliation
has been truly a win-win situation.
The rapid emergence of managed
care, with its unalloyed focus on costs
and unwillingness to share in the sup
port of the public goods of biomedical
education and research, is forcing
major changes in the governance, orga
nization and operations of academic
medical centers, and particularly in the
teaching hospitals and the physician
practices of the faculty.
These changes are disrupting long
established and comfortable faculty
patterns of behavior across the coun
try, and neither the VA medical centers
nor the VA-based faculty can be
immune from them. It is plain that a
large fraction of the costs of clinical
teaching and research have in recent
decades come to be heavily subsidized
by clinical revenues; and the intense
squeeze on those revenues will contin
ue to force discomfiting revisions in the
lifestyles and perquisites of all clinical
faculty as medical academe is restruc
tured and refinanced.
In recent years, the VA health system
has faced severe pressure on billets and
budgets, and that has only been exacer
bated by the perturbations in the health
care marketplace. The system itself has
undergone a major reorganization, and
all of its activities are under scrutiny
including affiliation agreements to
ensure that their provisions are conso
nant with the changing times.
Stanford is fortunate that because

construction funding was secured sev
eral years ago to replace the Loma Pri
eta earthquake-damaged main VA hos
pital with a modern new facility, and
because of the foresight exhibited by
the Center's leadership in responding
to the health care environment, the
Palo Alto VA Medical Center will sur
vive as a major regional facility and aca
demic partner of Stanford's medical
"school. These responses have and will
continue to require some changes in
patterns of faculty activity, but they
have been supported by most VA-based
faculty, who recognize the value of the
institution and the importance of its
repositioning efforts to their own long
term academic self-interest.
The "disgraceful events" described
in Wenegrat's letter involved the
attempt by three Stanford faculty, each
of who held an administrative position
in the VA Medical Center, to under
mine the authority of the Medical Cen
ter director and the chief of staff
because of the faculty members' oppo
sition to the operational changes tak
ing place within the institution.
As then-dean of the Medical School, I
was fully informed of what was going on
at the VA, both strategically and tacti
cally, and supported the efforts of VA
management for the reasons sketched
above. The dean's office made consider
able efforts to try quietly to resolve the
dispute and finally hosted a lengthy
meeting with the combatants, during
which each of the faculty was invited to
his air his dissatisfactions. After closely
listening to their presentations, I con-

cluded that their complaints were not
supportable; after several hours of
attempts to identify common ground
proved futile, I reluctantly realized that
reconciliation was not possible.
The VA management was entirely
within its prerogatives to dismiss the
faculty from their VA administrative
posts and had the authority to do so
whether the dean's office agreed or not.
The individuals' Stanford faculty
appointments were not affected or
abridged by this action in any way, nor
were their seniority rights as physicians
within the VA system.
Administrative appointments of facul
ty are not entitlements, whether at
Stanford or in the VA and to equate the
loss of administrative position with
infringement of academic freedom is to
put on the very concept of academic free
dom a construction that is strained and
insupportable. The complaint filed by
the faculty within the VA grievance sys
tem about their removal from their VA
administrative posts was unsuccessful.
An attempt to file a grievance over
the same issue under the University's
faculty grievance policy was correctly
denied by the provost and the president
on the grounds that the University
lacked jurisdiction in this matter. It is
unfortunate that a course of costly liti
gation now is being pursued, which will
distract the attention of faculty and
administrators at a time when their
energy might better be focused on
ensuring the survival of the institution.
