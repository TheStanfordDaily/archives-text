The ASSU took a step back from the controversial
ROTC issue yesterday when Deputy Senate Chair
Joe Freund withdrew a bill that would have invited
the military training program back to campus.
According to Freund, the issue is too divisive and
tense to be voted on by the senate. A vote on the bill
was originally scheduled for tonight.
"The situation is very delicate," Freund said.
"Any stand by the ASSU at this point would incense
students."
Freund became the sponsor of the bill after ASSU
Senator Bruce Gibney, who authored the bill, with
drew his sponsorship earlier in the evening.
Gibney also recommended the bill be dropped.
"I've become aware of information that makes it
clear that for the sake of ROTC, it is prudent to drop
the issue," Gibney said.
Gibney, who is a staff writer for The Stanford Re
view, was criticized by detractors for his personal
opinions on the issue, which he has written about in
Review articles.
According to Benjamin Lawrance, a doctoral stu
dent in history who is affiliated with the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center, Gibney "has
personal issues that clash with what he is trying to
effect."
Controversy over bringing ROTC to campus cen
tered on the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy
regarding gays in the military. According to detrac
tors, military policy conflicts with the University's
anti-discriminatory policy, which states that Stan
ford will not discriminate in the administration of
scholarship or loan programs on the basis of sexual
orientation.
"I have said a lot of things about the gay commu
nity, and maybe I went too far," Gibney said. "I don't
want to see personal issues involved. This is not me
versus gays."
According to Freund, Gibney "did not want the
[ROTC] issue clouded by his personal issues."
Freund said he has no plans to rewrite the bill or
present the bill to the Senate at any time in the near
future. He said that he might consider addressing the
issue "once there is less tension regarding the issue."
According to law student David Bradfute, ROTC
presence on campus would be a flagrant violation of
the University's policy.
"The problem with ROTC is that only straight

people can do it," Bradfute said. "If you look at the
policy and read it, ROTC is not okay. The question is,
should Stanford participate in discriminating
against its own students? Once Stanford starts vio
lating its antidiscriminatory policy, where do you
stop?"
According to Lawrance, the ROTC presence
would "exacerbate homophobia on campus."
"I'm glad they dropped it," Lawrance said. "An or
ganization that actively discriminates against gays
in scholarships and recruiting should not be allowed
