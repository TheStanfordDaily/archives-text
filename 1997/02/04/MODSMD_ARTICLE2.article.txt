# ROTC bill withdrawn
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The ASSU took a step back from the controversial
ROTC issue yesterday when Deputy Senate Chair
Joe Freund withdrew a bill that would have invited
the military training program back to campus.
According to Freund, the issue is too divisive and
tense to be voted on by the senate. A vote on the bill
was originally scheduled for tonight.
"The situation is very delicate," Freund said.
"Any stand by the ASSU at this point would incense
students."
Freund became the sponsor of the bill after ASSU
Senator Bruce Gibney, who authored the bill, with
drew his sponsorship earlier in the evening.
Gibney also recommended the bill be dropped.
"I've become aware of information that makes it
clear that for the sake of ROTC, it is prudent to drop
the issue," Gibney said.
Gibney, who is a staff writer for The Stanford Re
view, was criticized by detractors for his personal
opinions on the issue, which he has written about in
Review articles.
According to Benjamin Lawrance, a doctoral stu
dent in history who is affiliated with the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center, Gibney "has
personal issues that clash with what he is trying to
effect."
Controversy over bringing ROTC to campus cen
tered on the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy
regarding gays in the military. According to detrac
tors, military policy conflicts with the University's
anti-discriminatory policy, which states that Stan
ford will not discriminate in the administration of
scholarship or loan programs on the basis of sexual
orientation.
"I have said a lot of things about the gay commu
nity, and maybe I went too far," Gibney said. "I don't
want to see personal issues involved. This is not me
versus gays."
According to Freund, Gibney "did not want the
[ROTC] issue clouded by his personal issues."
Freund said he has no plans to rewrite the bill or
present the bill to the Senate at any time in the near
future. He said that he might consider addressing the
issue "once there is less tension regarding the issue."
According to law student David Bradfute, ROTC
presence on campus would be a flagrant violation of
the University's policy.
"The problem with ROTC is that only straight

people can do it," Bradfute said. "If you look at the
policy and read it, ROTC is not okay. The question is,
should Stanford participate in discriminating
against its own students? Once Stanford starts vio
lating its antidiscriminatory policy, where do you
stop?"
According to Lawrance, the ROTC presence
would "exacerbate homophobia on campus."
"I'm glad they dropped it," Lawrance said. "An or
ganization that actively discriminates against gays
in scholarships and recruiting should not be allowed
on campus. The University
should continue in its program to
ensure equal treatment of every
individual regardless of sexual
preference."
Lawrance said he does not
think ROTC should be allowed on
campus until "the ban on homo
sexuals in the armed forces is
completely lifted."
Proponents of the bill argued
that students who need the schol
arships to finance their education
are being punished unfairly.
"ROTC is a noble program. Be
tween 70 and 90 students are in
volved in the ROTC, and they
should not be penalized for a poli
cy that they have no control over,"
said ASSU President Bill Shen.

"The issue should be taken up
with the Department of Defense."
Junior Sean Hazlett, who par
ticipates in the Army ROTC pro
gram at Santa Clara University,
said it is difficult to work the
ROTC program into his class
schedule at Stanford.
"Without this scholarship I
wouldn't be at Stanford," Hazlett
said. He receives scholarship
money covering 80 percent of his
tuition from the program.
According to Hazlett, students
involved in ROTC who attend
Santa Clara benefit from having
the program on their campus be
cause they are awarded two to
three units of credit each quarter,
they have no commute time and
the program attempts to work
around their schedules.
"A greater injustice is being
done by keeping ROTC off cam
pus," Gibney said. "It is unfair

that students have to travel and
get up extra early in order to get
this financial aid."
Students participating in the
ROTC currently must travel to
UC-Berkeley, Santa Clara or San
Jose State University.
ASSU Senator Fern
Mechlowitz, who ran on the plat
form of returning ROTC to cam
pus, left last Tuesday's senate
meeting, preventing the bill from
coming to the floor. Without quo
rum, the senate could not vote on
the bill.
"My leaving had nothing to do
with my stance on the bill,"
Mechlowitz said. "It just was not
ready to come to floor. No one was
ready to vote on the issue.
"I don't think that we know all
the implications. We have to con
sider all of the communities that
would be affected by the bill,"
Mechlowitz said.
