# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Political posturing shouldn't be well endowed 
### 
There has been much talk
recently among our campus's
more liberal activists about the
concept of socially responsible investing.
The prime movers and shakers behind
the idea have been two longtime SEAS
activists — ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson and senior Kelly Naylor, who
also holds some sort of position with the
ASSU, albeit somewhat nebulously
defined. With their guidance, the student
government's executive branch has
placed its full — if, alas, not necessarily
formidable — lobbying power behind a
plan to get the University to invest its
endowment in companies which do nice
things like protect the environment and
refrain from exploiting child labor and do
not support brutal dictatorships.
I, for one, think it is bad when com
panies destroy the environment, exploit
child labor and support brutal dictator
ships. I am also someone who refuses to
support companies whose business
practices I disagree with, even on the
most trivial matters: When the Coffee
House refused to allow me a second cup
for my coffee (so it wasn't too hot to
hold), I would purchase nothing from
them for a number of weeks. Along that
same line, I would not invest my own
money in a company which, it seems
clear, is behaving badly.

At the same time, I am very glad that
the University's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility rejected Nick
and Kelly's proposal for a socially
responsible endowment.
Yes, I would like the University's
funds to be invested in companies that I
think do good things. And that was the
gist of the original socially responsible
endowment fund proposal: that the Uni
versity should set up a separate pool of
money to be invested in exemplary com
panies — an all Ben & Jerry's portfolio,
perhaps? — to which students and
alumni with ideals like mine could
donate their money.
But the problem with the proposal —
and why it was bad for liberal ideals —
was that, I am quite sure, many of the
University's donors would like their
money to be used in ways they, too, see
fit. Unfortunately, many of those donors
hold rather conservative viewpoints and,
furthermore, they donate a hell of a lot
more money than do people like me.
Had the University agreed to set up a
socially responsible fund just to placate
potential donors like myself and thus set
a precedent of heeding donors' political
demands, all for my meager 25 or 50
bucks, how could it have refused a
demand similar in nature but inverted in
ideoloev from someone who gives thou

sands or, better yet, millions?
In 1991, a prominent Yale University
alumnus donated $20 million to his alma
mater, to help it fund a program in West
ern civilization. Although some segments
of that University's community objected
to an expansion of Western-culture stud
ies, preferring instead greater emphasis
on more multicultural viewpoints, Yale
intended to create the new program.
Administrative mismanagement,
though, had delayed the program's start
for years, and in 1995 the donor began to
get restless. When he demanded that he
been granted the right to approve all fac
ulty appointments to "his" program, Yale
returned his $20 million.
If a similar incident occurred at a
Stanford which had agreed to the plan
for a socially responsible investment
fund, would the University have had
the standing to refuse the donor's
demand for review of faculty? If Stan
ford will change its investment policies
to receive my money, why should it not
change its academic policies to take an
alumnus's money?
And it is not inconceivable that Stan
ford alumni will attempt to advance
agendas considerably to the right of the
one underlying the socially responsible
investment movement. David Packard,
among the University's most generous

benefactors, served as deputy defense
secretary in the Nixon administration
had he attached political caveats to his
donations, I doubt they would have been
particularly leftist. Furthermore, the dis
gruntled Yale donor, it is worth noting,
was Lee Bass, the brother and former
business partner of Robert Bass, the
chairman of Stanford's Board of
Trustees.
After the SCIR — a Board of Trustees
committee charged with setting policy on
investment responsibility — rejected the
socially responsible endowment proposal,
the ASSU moved to its fallback position.
The plan is now to create, independent of
Stanford's investments, a socially
responsible fund to be held in trust for
the University. The idea is that those of
us who cannot bear to have our dona
tions being used for evil by companies in
which the University holds stock can give
instead to the Socially Responsible
Endowment fund.
It would seem that this is the perfect
solution. Stanford has not been forced to
set a precedent of kowtowing to donor's
political demands, and concerned stu
dents and alumni have a way to give
Stanford money with it being used to
fund "irresponsible" companies. Sadlv,
though, that noble-sounding effort is
nothing more than blackmail.

The fact is that no donations to the
Stanford Fund — and that includes those
made as part of the Senior Class Gift —
ever enter Stanford's endowment, the
pool of money which is invested, be it
responsibly or irresponsibly. Choosing to
give money to the Socially Responsible
Endowment is not a new way to avoid
having one's money used to support
"bad" causes; Stanford Fund donations
are never invested in "bad" companies.
And money donated to the Socially
Responsible Endowment would only be
given to Stanford once the University's
investment policies change.
Giving to the Socially Responsible
Endowment is simply encouraging an
attempt to blackmail the University into
changing its investment policies to con
form to political pressures — even if you
accept, as I do, that these are political
pressures for "good." The problem is that
once such a precedent it set, it seems cer
tain that other donors will apply political
pressure for "evil."
