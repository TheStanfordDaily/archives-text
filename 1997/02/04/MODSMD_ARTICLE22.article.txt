## Ahead of the Pack Track rocks Reno 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
Ask any member of Stan
ford's track and field team, and
he or she will tell you that the
meet was small and low-key and
that no one expected too much.
Nevertheless, those Cardinal
athletes who participated in the
Wolf Pack Invitational had a
solid performance in their sec
ond outing of the season.
Saturday's indoor event at
Nevada drew 17 mostly regional
schools, such as California, UC-
Davis, Eastern Washington,
Sacramento State and Fresno
State. Other competitors includ
ed Oklahoma, Baylor and Texas-
El Paso. Not only was the num
ber of schools limited but also
the size of the teams; Stanford
sent a squad of only about 18
athletes to Reno.
In men's competition, senior
sprinter Jimmie Johnson was a
provisional qualifier for the
NCAA Championships in the
200-meter dash with a time of
21.29 seconds. Despite finishing
first in the second of six heats,

Johnson fell to third overall, los
ing to Obadele Thompson of
UTEP, who set a field house
record with a time of 20.95 sec
onds.
"I wasn't completely satisfied;
there was a little bit more
there," Johnson said. "This
week was to just get the legs
rolling again."
In other results, sophomore
thrower Marc Mazzoni placed
fifth in the shot put with a
throw of 50 feet, 1 1/4 inches.
Two Cardinal were also in the
top eight in the 35-pound weight
throw, as Mazzoni placed third
with a throw of 56-1/2 and
freshman Mark Ganek finished
eighth with a throw of 48-1 1/4.
Freshman vaulter Toby Steven
son came in fifth in the men's
pole vault with a vault of 16-10
3/4.
The Cardinal women's results
were impressive as well. Sopho
