### Esther Pan Staff writer 
They might call it the Big
Freeze, but it was California
that got frozen out by the Stan
ford ice hockey team last week
end. Stanford won both times in
the two-game series with the
Weenies, winning back the
esteemed trophy — The Skate —
and securing a place in the
national tournament.
Stanford lost to Cal in their
last meeting and came into the
match looking for revenge. In
the first game, played in the new
Cal arena Thursday night, the
first two periods were very close.
A charged Cal team, playing
before an emotional home
crowd, made sure Stanford had
its hands full for the entire
match.
Despite missing a couple of
players due to illness, the Stan
ford team jumped to an early 3-1
lead, which was then lost when
Cal tied it up in a scoring (lurry.
"They really outshot us in the
beginning," said goalie junior
Sami Jo Small, who sat out the
match while teammate sopho
more Nick Flores guarded the

goal. "If Nick hadn't played real
ly well to keep us in the game,
we would've been down by a lot
more."
Coach Ernie Ferrari agreed.
"The Cal team was excited and
emotional, playing in front of
their home crowd," he said. "It
was difficult for us to get the
ship going, but we weathered
that storm and were able to
come back in the third period."
In the third period, Stanford
threw an offensive zone play, a
new strategy introduced by Fer
rari last week, which offers bet
ter control of the puck and gen
erates more scoring opportuni
ties. Stanford then scored the
two goals that decided the game.
"We started taking it to
them," Small said. "We definite
ly did expect to win, so it felt
good to pull it out."
The momentum of the first
game carried over into the second
game of the series, which was
played on home ice in Redwood
City on Friday night. A vocal
capacity crowd witnessed an 8-1
rout of the Weenies. Missing two

qualified in a slight skirmish at
the end of the first match — the
Cal team was steamrolled by
Stanford, who used the offensive
zone even more effectively than
in the first game.
"We outshot Cal by 22-4 in
the second game," Ferrari said.
"There wasn't much they could
do to slow us down." Stanford
was confident with the new
offense and used very physical
play to dominate the match.
"As a goalie, it was great,"

Small said. "I got hardly any
shots, so I could just sit and
watch the game."
Ferrari praised his team's
cooperation for the wins.
"It was a real team effort," he
said. "I can think of a positive
contribution from every player
on the team; everyone got a
chance to play, and they all con
tributed to the wins."
With Cal out of the way, the
Stanford ice hockey team looks
ahead to a homestand against
UCLA this weekend, Friday and
Saturday nights in Redwood
City. Two weeks later the Pac-8
tournament begins, and then it's
on to nationals.
