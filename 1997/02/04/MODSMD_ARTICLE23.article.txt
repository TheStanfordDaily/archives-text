They might call it the Big
Freeze, but it was California
that got frozen out by the Stan
ford ice hockey team last week
end. Stanford won both times in
the two-game series with the
Weenies, winning back the
esteemed trophy — The Skate —
and securing a place in the
national tournament.
Stanford lost to Cal in their
last meeting and came into the
match looking for revenge. In
the first game, played in the new
Cal arena Thursday night, the
first two periods were very close.

threw an offensive zone play, a
new strategy introduced by Fer
rari last week, which offers bet

ties. Stanford then scored the
two goals that decided the game.
"We started taking it to
them," Small said. "We definite
ly did expect to win, so it felt
good to pull it out."
The momentum of the first
game carried over into the second
game of the series, which was
played on home ice in Redwood
City on Friday night. A vocal
