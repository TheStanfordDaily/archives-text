# Volleyball sweeps past San Diegos in MPSF openers
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Last weekend, the Stanford men's volleyball
team stormed into the San Diego area, once again
asserting that it is the nation's top collegiate vol
leyball team. Stanford came away from the week
end with two dominant victories, defeating UC-
San Diego on Friday in three games 15-11, 15-5,
15-6 and then thumping San Diego State on Sun
day 15-5, 15-9, 15-10.
In Friday's match against the Tritons of UC-
San Diego, Stanford got off to a slow start, trail
ing 8-6 in the opening game. After calling a time
out, the team promptly got back into the game,
tying it at 8-8, then leading 11-9.
UC-San Diego closed to within 12-11, but the
Cardinal shut the door, winning the next three
points and sealing a game-one victory. After
allowing the Tritons to remain in game one as a
result of seven hitting errors and generally poor
service return, the Cardinal dispatched of UC-
San Diego with ease in the next two games.
In games two and three, Stanford's service
receive was far better. The team totaled only
three hitting errors for the two games, taking
complete control.
Senior Mike Lambert once again led the Cardi
nal in kills with 15, while fellow seniors Matt
Fuerbringer and Mike Hoefer contributed 12 and
11, respectively. Of these three, Hoefer was the
most dominant, with 11 kills in only 16 attempts
and no errors, compiling an outstanding .688 hit
ting percentage. He added seven block assists to
these totals for a good all-around match.
In addition to strong offensive performances
by Fuerbringer, Hoefer and Lambert, the Cardi
nal played very solid defense. The team held Eric
Mia, UC-San Diego's top hitter, to a .143 hitting
percentage and kept the team to a very slim .110.
"The match really turned for us when our ser
vice-receive improved," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "They never got it going offensively, so all
we had to do was play solid defense and we knew
that we would win. The score of the second two
games is reflective of what happens when a good
team eliminates mistakes."
On Sunday afternoon, the Cardinal took its act
across town to face San Diego State. Unlike its
match against UC-San Diego, where the team
struggled early, it got off to a very fast start
against the Aztecs. After trailing 1-0, the team
rode the jump serve of freshman outside hitter
Andy Whitt to gain a 5-1 lead. They never looked
back in the game or, for that matter, in the
match.
After disposing of the Aztecs in rapid fashion
in game one, the Cardinal attack sputtered
briefly in game two. After trailing 6-2 early, Stan
ford put on a defensive show, stringing together
20 straight sideouts and gaining the lead at 9-6.
From there, it was not long until the Cardinal
closed out the second game.
Game three, like game two, was somewhat of a
defensive struggle. Although the Cardinal never
trailed, San Diego State threatened late in the
game, closing to 11-9 and leading the Stanford
coaches to call a timeout. After the timeout,
Stanford closed out the match, conceding just
