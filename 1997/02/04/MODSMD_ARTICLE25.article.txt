## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
In its home season opener today, the
Stanford tennis teams will take on Fresno
State at 1:30 p.m. The competition takes
place on Stadium Dedication Day.
Coming off their win against the Lobos
of New Mexico Jan. 18, the No. 1 men s
team is excited to open the season at
home against No. 12 Fresno State.
"They are always a good team," said
head coach Dick Gould, in his 31st season
with the Cardinal. "We expect a good

match for the home opener. We opened
the season last year against Fresno State,
and they gave us a bit of a scare."
Although they pulled out the win with
a 5-2 score against Fresno State last sea
son, the Cardinal began the match with
three straight losses in doubles. Return
ing players for Fresno State this year
include Fredrik Giers, ranked 61st in the
nation, as well as the doubles duo of Giers
and Kelly Gullett, ranked 16th in the
nation.
However, with three starting players
who captured the NCAA Championship

title last spring returning, the top-ranked
Cardinal appears ready for the challenge.
"We have a great team this year,"
Gould said. "Although we lost, three
tough competitors in our graduating
seniors, JefT Salzenstein, Ricky Becker
and Jim Thomas, we have enthusiasm
and depth in our new team."
The Cardinal is indeed a young team
this year, as five out of the 12 players on
the roster are freshmen.
"1 cannot wait to play my first match
at home for Stanford," said fresh
man Mike Bryan. "I have been
dreaming about playing for Stan
ford my whole life." Bryan will
play singles as well as team up
with his twin brother, Bob, in dou
bles.
The team is young, but Gould
believes that the enthusiasm of
the younger players combined
with the leadership and energy of
the older players should make for
a strong season.
"Although we have a young
team, we also have great leader
ship in [senior] Grant Elliott, who
knows what it is like to win the
championship and to lose the
championship by an inch. [Junior]
Paul Goldstein and [sophomore]
Ryan Wolters provide college expe
rience and leadership as well."
