# Women shaky in Arizona
## Wildcats, Beavers edge Cardinal gymnasts 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's gymnastics
team returned home after a tight Friday
meet against some of the top teams in
the nation. The Stanford squad finished
a close third after No. 6 Arizona and No.
8 Oregon State, followed by George
Washington.
The meet was the first time this sea
son that the Card took on more than one
team; this meant less time for the team
to prepare mentally and required the
Cardinal gymnasts to concentrate hard
er on their routines, as the meet rotated
faster with several teams performing
simultaneously.
Although the squad easily won the
vault, matching the Stanford record set
last week (49.325), it experienced some
difficulty getting the team engine going
for the night. The task of starting the
meet with the difficult balance beam in
front of a full Arizona home crowd
proved to be burdensome for the Cardi
nal.
The meet "was probably about 75-per
cent good," said coach Lisa Izzi. "We had
problems on the beam again, and we had
to count a fall on the bars."
The overall team score of 192.825 fell
short of the 193-point barrier the squad
surpassed two weeks ago. Izzi said this
was disappointing for the squad, which
has consistently been improving its per
formance with each meet.
Difficulties on the beam apparatus
have forced the talented squad to fall
short of victories over the nation's best
teams this season, and they again kept
the Card from taking home a win. At the
Arizona meet, weak performances on the
beam put pressure on the Card for the
remaining three events and made it
impossible for the squad to catch up with
Arizona and Oregon State.

Junior Christie Jones was first up on
the beam. After the talented team veter
an nailed a 9.725, freshman Tara La
Morte followed suit with a consistent
routine, earning a 9.4.
Then the disaster occurred — the
next three Cardinal gymnasts, perhaps
in the mounting pressure to cover for
each other's performance, all fell off the
four-inch beam.
Last up was junior co-captain Keri
Monahan. Her near-perfect routine,
which earned a high score of 9.725, was
not enough to float the team boat, how
ever. The Stanford team marked a disap
pointing 46.75 on the apparatus, while
Arizona took the lead with a score of
49.325.
Despite the misfortune on the beam,
the squad picked up momentum and
managed to show the crowd what it is
capable of with individual displays oi
high-level skill on the vault and floor
exercise.
Monahan achieved a second-place fin
ish in the all-around category with out
standing routines on all four events,
which earned her a score of 39.25, just
short of Arizona's Heidi Hornbeek, who
scored 39.45. Sophomore Tracey Kohl
put on strong performances throughout
the night, earning 9.75 on the vault and
9.8 on the floor exercise.
"Skillwise, talentwise, we're capable
of being just as good or better," Izzi said.
"It's just a matter of hitting those rou
tines that day.
"I think they were distracted by out
come. They really needed to focus on
actual skills they were performing.
We're going to do that. It's just a matter
of really buckling down — I know we'll
do better."
Although Izzi said she was not happy
with the results, she commented that
the team did bring home a pre
cious learning experience from
the meet.
"The best thing that came out
of the meet is that we learned
the need to work on mental
approach," Izzi said.
Izzi said the older team mem
bers especially felt the lack of
mental preparation as a team
this season.
They agreed that each gym
nast needs to work on learning
how to really focus on what she
is doing and not letting the per
son performing before put pres
sure her.
The team also attained the
valuable arena experience for
the Pacific 10 Conference later
on in the season. The Stanford
squad will likely face both Ari
zona and Oregon State for a Pac
-10 rematch in Arizona next
month.
Upon returning to campus,
the co-captains called a team
meeting yesterday morning to
make sure the gymnasts were in
the right mindset for the remain
der of the season and back on
track for practice this week.
"We talked about what we
needed to do to pull the season
together," Murakami said.
"What happened shouldn't have
happened, and it shouldn't hap
pen again."
