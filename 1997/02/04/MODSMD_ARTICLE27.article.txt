# Pitching hopes to regroup against the Golden Eagles

Two weekends into a season defined so
far by lofty scoring totals and a pitching
staff looking a little ragged at the edges.
Stanford baseball (3-2) is rethinking its
preseason assumptions.
Coming into the season, the Card
brought with it a proven pitching staff, one
of the best in the nation. The offense, how
ever, was less certain, making run produc
tion one of the biggest question marks of
the top-ranked team.
However, scoring runs is no longer the
question, and pitching is no longer the
obvious answer.
"We certainly are swinging the bat
well," said pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"Hut we can pitch better than we have
been."
Today's game against Division II Cal
State-Los Angeles is a chance to prove it.
Since the beginning of the season, the
offense has been providing the answers. In
their first showcase of the season, the
offense made the St. Mary's Gaels look like
Happy Acres Preschool's team masquerad
ing in college uniforms. After cleaning the
Gaels out 18-6 on opening day, the Card
came back a day later to post a crisp 10-0
victory.
Then, even while dropping two of three
to the Titans, Stanford's offense was far
from docile, scoring 25 runs in three days.
After watching Friday's game slip through
its fingers 6-5, the Card came back Satur
day to drown the Titans 15-5 with three
home runs and 16 hits before dropping

Sunday's game 9-5.
The only missing link last weekend was
the pitching. The game got out of hand for
the Cardinal when the Titans were able to
post big innings on the board. Until Cal
State-Fullerton scored four in the bottom
of the fifth Sunday, Stanford was keeping
pace.
"The thing that killed us was a couple of
four-run innings," Dunton said.
Dunton also offers another explanation
for the downfall of pitching.
"Throughout the games, our guys threw
too many pitches. We need to be more effi
cient," he said. "Defensive mistakes, like
the ones we made on Sunday, aren't help
ful either."
Despite the bumpy road, faith in the
pitching staff hasn't been destroyed â€” just
depressed.
"We were a little disappointed," Dunton
said. "We played beneath our abilities and
expectations."
The Golden Eagles will give the Card
another chance. Junior right-handed
curveballer Adam Harris, who threw two
scoreless innings of relief during Satur
day's game, will be granted the starting job.
Dunton believes that the pitching will be
indicative of the team's chances in today's
matchup.
"Usually, a team's success revolves
around the success of the pitcher. The
game against L.A. will be no different," he
said. "Usually Los Angeles is a pretty good
team. It won't be a cake walk."
Head coach Mark Marquess boasts a 7-0
career record against the Golden Eagles,
who finished 15-17 last year.
