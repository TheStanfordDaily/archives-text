# Rugby squashes Bay Area archrivals

Both the men's and women's rugby
teams posted big wins this weekend with a
32-0 shutout of UC-Santa Cruz by the
women and 22-10 defeat of St. Mary's by
the men.
By outrunning UC-Santa Cruz and con
trolling the tempo of the game, the women
were able to dominate the Banana Slugs in
the victory last Saturday.
Senior Keiko Suda led the team at the
flyer position and helped control the pace of
the match for the Cardinal.
"The Stanford women's team doesn't
have much size, so therefore they cannot
actually counter the opposition," said head
coach Franck Boivert. "They've got to make
up by playing faster, trying to move the ball
away from their big people and therefore
going around the strength of their opposi
tion."
Keeping the Slugs off balance was the
key to the one-sided victory. Quick offense
and aggressive defense kept Santa Cruz on
guard and allowed Stanford to control the
direction of the game.
"This weekend we were able to keep the
defense and the offense on their heels for
the whole game, which is just the result of
us putting pressure on them the whole
time," Suda said. "I think that everything
came together for us. Our ball handling was
really good; our defense was really good and
our intensity was very high. It was more of
a team effort than any one individual play
er having a great game."

The men also won their weekend match,
traveling to St. Mary's and coming out with
a solid 22-10 victory in Moraga. Aggressive
defensive stops helped to keep the Gaels
under control and gave the Cardinal good
positioning on offense.
Sophomore Don Donester led the team
by scoring two tries for 10 points and by
attacking assertively on the other side of
the ball.
"I think we made some pretty big strides
in the game," said senior captain Joe Clay
ton. "We started out the first 20 minutes
just playing defense on the goal line, and
we've been making an effort just to base our
play on strong defense and turning that
into offense.
"In defense, as long as we move forward,
go get them, I think that it turns it into an
offensive. The key is not to wait for them
but to go get them. If we can do that then
we're going to end up getting the ball."
The team has been able to rely on
strong defense because of the size of its
players, but that may soon change. Senior
Jason White, who also played football for
the Cardinal, has been drafted into the
World League of American Football and
will no longer participate on the Cardinal
team. His loss means that the Cardinal
will lose its biggest player and must start
to rely on a faster-paced game instead of
physical strength.
"Since [White] was our biggest man,
we're probably going to have to change our
strategy and play the same style the women
are going to have to play by being much fit
ter and playing faster," Boivert said.
