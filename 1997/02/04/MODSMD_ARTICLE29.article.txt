Add synchronized swimming
to the list of sports that Stanford
teams dominate. The women's
synchronized swimming team
continued its form from last
year, winning in its first meet of
the season. The Cardinal
trounced California and St.
Mary's in commanding fashion
on Sunday in Berkeley.
Stanford's point total of 100
more than tripled the amount of
its competitors as Cal scored
30.5 and St. Mary's just 9. In
fact, Stanford claimed the top
two spots in the duet and trio
competitions and four out of the
top five places in the figure com
petition.
"It's always nice to start off
with a win," said coach Vickey
Weir. "But even more impor
tant is the chance it gives the
swimmers to measure their
progress against their capabili
ties and goals. [The] meet gives
us a good measuring point to
work from."
Olympic gold medalist
Heather Pease made an instant

impact for Stanford, placing first
in the solo, duet, trio and figure
competition. The freshmar
partnered with senior Bridgel
Finn in the duet competition for
a score of 89.733, and senior Les
ley Riddervold and sophomore
Vanessa Shaw in the trio event
to tally 85.133.
The team of Riddervold and
Shaw placed second in the duet
competition with an 86.733.
Freshman Julie Enos, senior
Amy Markezick and sophomore
Catherine Chen claimed second
in the trio event with a total
score of 83.067.
"Many of our swimmers have
a distinct advantage because
we've competed in events long
before college," said Riddervold,
who had competed for 12 years
prior to entering Stanford.
"Many of Cal's swimmers didn't
pick up the sport competitively
until college. Therefore, the
meet was more of an opportuni
ty to measure our own
progress."
The Cardinal heads to Min
nesota this weekend in hopes of
repeating its performance.
