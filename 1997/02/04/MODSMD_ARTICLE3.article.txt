# ROTC return unlikely, University officials say
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Twenty-eight years have passed since the Fac
ulty Senate voted to discontinue credit for mili
tary training and education at Stanford, and Uni
versity officials don't think ROTC will return
anytime soon.
An ASSU senate bill, introduced by senator
Bruce Gibney and subsequently withdrawn yes
terday, sought to end the University's official ob
jection to ROTC on campus. That objection
began in 1969 during a period of intense campus
opposition to the Vietnam War.
"We argued that Stanford should not be in
volved in any way in what we considered to be an
amoral war," said English Prof. Rob Rebholz,
who was involved in the 1969 debate.
Even in peacetime, University administrators
see no reason to reopen the debate, because the
military has expressed no formal interest in re
turning to campus.
"I don't understand why this is an issue at the
present time," said University Registrar Roger
Printup, a University liaison with the military.
"If they had wanted to come back, I think they
would have asked, and they haven't asked."
Printup believes that cutbacks
in the Department of Defense bud
get are a large deterrent to a possi
ble Stanford unit. In particular,
the armed forces are trying to
eliminate duplications of services,
he said. ROTC programs already
exist at UC Berkeley (Navy /Ma
rine), Santa Clara (Army) and San
Jose State University (Air Force).
Director of University Commu

nications Terry Shepard agreed.
"They haven't really expressed
any major interest in coming
back," he said.
Although no Pentagon officials
could be reached for comment on
the issue, the commander of the
UC-Berkeley ROTC unit said he
was both surprised and "very
pleased" to hear that the ASSU
bill was being considered.
"We've been gone from Stan
ford for a long time," Capt.
Nathan Beason said, "and frankly
I'm surprised that this issue has
come up."

Beason declined to speculate on
the possibility of an ROTC unit at
Stanford, saying that he is unsure
of possible changes to the national
program. "We're more focused on
the numbers of people that we're
bringing into the program" at al
ready-established sites, he said.
Almost 25 years after the mili
tary left Stanford, a new push is
being made to return the ROTC
program to campus. Currently,
ROTC gives scholarships for Stan
ford students who train at other
Bay Area schools.
In 1969, the Faculty Senate

voted to end its practice of granti
ng academic credit to ROTC stu
dents for military education and
training. The decision was the be
ginning of the end for the on-cam
pus relationship between the
school and ROTC, as the last mili
tary training program left campus
in 1973.
The decision to drop ROTC was
made on the basis of two factors,
Rebholz said. One objection was to
the bestowing of faculty status
upon military officers who taught
ROTC courses, an issue to which
Rebholz would still object if the

program were reinstated.
The second issue, which Reb
holz called the more divisive of the
two, was the protest by many stu
dents and faculty members of the
Vietnam War.
Rebholz continues to object to
ROTC, but for a different, albeit
political, reason. "I don't think
Stanford should allow any organi
zation on campus that will not
allow gays, lesbians or bisexuals to
serve in that organization," he
said, criticizing the U.S. military's
policy on homosexuals in its
ranks.
