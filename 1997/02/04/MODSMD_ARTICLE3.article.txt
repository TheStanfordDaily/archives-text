# ROTC return unlikely, University officials say

Twenty-eight years have passed since the Fac
ulty Senate voted to discontinue credit for mili
tary training and education at Stanford, and Uni
versity officials don't think ROTC will return
anytime soon.
An ASSU senate bill, introduced by senator
Bruce Gibney and subsequently withdrawn yes
terday, sought to end the University's official ob
jection to ROTC on campus. That objection
began in 1969 during a period of intense campus
opposition to the Vietnam War.
"We argued that Stanford should not be in
volved in any way in what we considered to be an
amoral war," said English Prof. Rob Rebholz,
who was involved in the 1969 debate.
Even in peacetime, University administrators
see no reason to reopen the debate, because the
military has expressed no formal interest in re
turning to campus.
"I don't understand why this is an issue at the
present time," said University Registrar Roger
Printup, a University liaison with the military.
"If they had wanted to come back, I think they
would have asked, and they haven't asked."
