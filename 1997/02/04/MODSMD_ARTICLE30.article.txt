# Lawsuit dismissed before going to trial

### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A year-old lawsuit filed against
Stanford by a former campus police
officer apparently has come to a
close with a judgment in favor of the
University.
The case, as originally fded in
November 1995, alleged that James
Fitzhenry was wrongfully termi
nated, that Stanford Police Chief
Marv Herrington was negligent in
Fitzhenry's training and that
Fitzhenry's civil rights were violat
ed when he was denied the pension
status of a public employee.
By granting a summary judg
ment motion, the U.S. District
Court in San Jose ruled on Jan. 21
that the case could be judged based
on papers already fded without an
actual trial.
The court concurred with Stan
ford's motion that the one remain
ing contention in Fitzhenry's law
suit was not supported by the evi
dence.
Fitzhenry was a police officer at
Stanford from 1987 to 1994.
According to Fitzhenry's origi
nal suit, his firing stemmed from
his testimony and subsequent ha
rassment when he supported a fel
low officer accused of theft during a
police search in 1992.
The issue of the pension was the
only one remaining unresolved. Ac
cording to Stanford's motion for
summary judgment, Fitzhenry vol
untarily dismissed the other two
claims in October.

According to the same motion,
the substance of the pension claim
was that since Fitzhenry, like all
Stanford police officers, was depu
tized by the Santa Clara County
sheriff, he was therefore a public
employee covered by the Public Em
ployee Retirement System.
Stanford's denial of that cover
age, according to Fitzhenry's con
tention, violated his civil rights.
Although Stanford police offi
cers are deputized by the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, they are em
ployees of the University, and their
benefits are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement with the
Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Associa
tion, according to Susan Hoerger,
one of the attorneys representing
the University.
As a University employee, the
motion contends, Fitzhenry was
fired by Stanford and not the state.
Stanford's motion argued that
Fitzhenry "must submit evidence
that the state ... deprived him of
his property interest in PERS bene
fits. ... Plaintiff has failed to show
any evidence that the state is re
sponsible for such actions."
Hoerger said that "as far as
[Stanford isj concerned, this is a
judgment for the University, and
that ends it."
She declined to comment on
whether Fitzhenry had the right to
appeal and would exercise that
right.
Neither Fitzhenry nor his attor
ney, Seth Kelsey, could be reached
for comment.
