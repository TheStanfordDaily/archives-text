After months of data collection and deliberation,
the Graduate School of Business will introduce a
more consistent core curriculum better suited to
the demands of today's business world, Dean Mike
Spence announced last week.
In the current core, first-year MBA students take
12 courses designed to provide a common body of
knowledge in areas such as accounting, marketing,
finance and organizational behavior.
The new core curriculum will enhance the inte
gration of courses, bring a greater focus on interna
tional aspects of business and improve standardiza
tion of content among different sections of the same
course.
Spence chose the new core over the status quo
and two other alternatives developed by a faculty
review committee.
"I think it's a core that makes good sense,"

Spence said. It starts with courses in the major dis
ciplines and functional areas and progresses to im
plementation of the principles learned in those
classes, he said.
There will be a course that explicitly deals with
global issues, and other courses will better incorpo
rate international topics as well, he said.
"The world's changing very fast. In particular, it
is becoming more international," Spence said.
The new system will also feature greater stan
dardization of course content among the different
sections into which first-vear students are divided.
Students expressed dissatisfaction in the past about
the variations in content across sections.
To realize these goals, the Business School will
appoint a faculty director, who preferably will teach
in the core and create a staff assistant position.
Spence's choice did not catch the faculty off
guard. "There was not really much surprise," said
