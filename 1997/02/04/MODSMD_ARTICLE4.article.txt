# GSB alters core curriculum
## 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
After months of data collection and deliberation,
the Graduate School of Business will introduce a
more consistent core curriculum better suited to
the demands of today's business world, Dean Mike
Spence announced last week.
In the current core, first-year MBA students take
12 courses designed to provide a common body of
knowledge in areas such as accounting, marketing,
finance and organizational behavior.
The new core curriculum will enhance the inte
gration of courses, bring a greater focus on interna
tional aspects of business and improve standardiza
tion of content among different sections of the same
course.
Spence chose the new core over the status quo
and two other alternatives developed by a faculty
review committee.
"I think it's a core that makes good sense,"

Spence said. It starts with courses in the major dis
ciplines and functional areas and progresses to im
plementation of the principles learned in those
classes, he said.
There will be a course that explicitly deals with
global issues, and other courses will better incorpo
rate international topics as well, he said.
"The world's changing very fast. In particular, it
is becoming more international," Spence said.
The new system will also feature greater stan
dardization of course content among the different
sections into which first-vear students are divided.
Students expressed dissatisfaction in the past about
the variations in content across sections.
To realize these goals, the Business School will
appoint a faculty director, who preferably will teach
in the core and create a staff assistant position.
Spence's choice did not catch the faculty off
guard. "There was not really much surprise," said
Business Prof. Margaret Neale,
because the dean had been ac
tively seeking input from every
one.
While praising the plan over
all, Business Prof. Charles Hol
loway said ultimately, "The
strengths depend on what the
faculty and dean are up to imple
menting."
The Business School will not
implement the new curriculum
all at once, according to Spence.
"I think parts of it we can do fair
ly quickly," he said, because they
are similar to elements in the
current system.
Spence formed the review
committee last April to solicit
feedback from the school's facul
ty, students and alumni and to
survey other business schools.
The group presented its four pro
posals in December.
"I think there were pros and
cons to every option," Spence
said. Besides the status quo, the
other options included a flexible
core offering students greater
freedom in class selection and
another plan similar to the one
chosen.
While the status quo received
minor support and the flexible
core even less, there was a lot of
support for the other two propos
als, according to Spence.
"I thought this one was the
most challenging," he said. While
Spence acknowledged "every
one's slightly daunted by
change," he added, "this is Stan
ford and we ought to take a shot
at it."
