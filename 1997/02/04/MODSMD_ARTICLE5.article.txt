# STS search yields list of possibilities
## Edinburgh professor first choice 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The search for a new director of
the Program in Science, Technolo
gy and Society is one step closer to
completion: The School of Human
ities and Sciences has compiled a
list of possibilities and contacted its
first choice.
Stephen Haber, the school's as
sociate dean for social sciences, said
his office produced the list based on
recommendations from the depart
ments of Sociology, Economics and
Political Science. The first candi
date, he said, is Donald Mackenzie,
a professor of the sociology of sci
ence at the University of Edin
burgh in Scotland.
Mackenzie's name appeared on
the lists of recommendations sub
mitted by both the Sociology and
the Political Science departments,
Haber said.
He stressed that the University
"has not yet made an offer to Prof.
Mackenzie" but said he had spoken
Mackenzie would visit Stanford

early next quarter to speak with the
administration, members of the So
ciology Departments and other pro
grams, as well as some of the stu
dents active in STS.
Early last quarter, the school an
nounced it would carry out a search
for a tenured faculty member who
would serve as a part-time director
for the program. Before that deci
sion, the University planned to dis
continue the program.
If he is given an offer and if he ac
cepts, Mackenzie will become a
tenured professor of sociology and
part-time head of STS. Haber said
his current discipline, sociology of
science, had "a high degree of over
lap" with the STS program.
If he accepts an offer, Haber said
it was "too soon to see exactly
when" Mackenzie would begin
teaching at Stanford.
"I'd like this to move along
quickly [but] it's too early to say
whether he would be here in the
fall."
Should Mackenzie not be offered
the position or not accept it, Haber
said the school would simply move
down the list.
Haber said he was "very encour
aged" that Mackenzie was interest
ed enough in the idea to visit Stan
ford.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Scott Sagan chaired a departmental
committee that came up with a list
of names including Mackenzie's.
"Donald Mackenzie is one of
the leading scholars in Europe
today . . . studying advanced tech
nologies and the way in which
they are created and used, espe
cially in a government context,"
Sagan said.
Mackenzie's most famous work

is a book called "Inventing Accura
cy," printed in 1990, which discuss
es the development of the guidance
systems of intercontinental ballis
tic missiles, Sagan said.
Sagan also called Mackenzie "a
clear writer and a profound
thinker."
Sophomore Tony Engel, an STS
rrnyor who is active in the move
ment to preserve the program, wel
comed the steps taken by the selec
tion committee.
Identifying a front-runner is
"very positive; we're really looking
forward to meeting him," he said.
Accordingto senior Michael Put
nam, an STS major, students in the
program had offered the search
committee a list of 20 names they
felt should merit consideration.
That list, which included Macken
zie's name, was "based mostly on
conversations with faculty."
