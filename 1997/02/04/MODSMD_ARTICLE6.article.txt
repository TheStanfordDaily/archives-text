# Olympics united world, divide city

Before the Olympic redevelop
ment, Atlanta business leaders saw
the downtown area as vacant, bro
ken sidewalks and dilapidated
buildings — an embarrassment to
their city.
Homeless people saw those
streets as the place where they lived.
These diverging views over this
shared space show the ambivalence
and anticipation in Atlanta prior to
the Olympic Games, said Solomon
Green, who graduated from Stan
ford last year. The Olympics, often
touted as a meeting place for the
world, may also divide those within
the city by class and ethnicity.
In his honors thesis, Green
began to untangle this hydra's
snare. He examined the effects of
the preparation for the Atlanta
Olympics on urban poverty.
"The Olympics holds such an
ideological weight. It can be a posi
tive, uplifting force," Green said
"But we need to examine it critical
ly, both to see where it is valuable
and where it fails.

His research found that the Her
culean preparation for the Games
had a devastating effect on the
homeless and marginally housed
population.
"I wasn't looking for villains or
heroes," Green said. "My research
was about individuals — how differ
ent people viewed the same event, in
the same city, in the same space."
Built on 60 acres of downtown
land, Olympic Centennial Park is at
the symbolic heart of the dispute.
Sitting m the shadow of the CNN
and Coca-Cola buildings, the park
lies on the fault line between the
booming business district and the
low-income inner city.
As the Games approached, the
area became a prime target for rede
velopment, Green said.
The park displaced many of the
estimated 15,000 to 20,000 home
less in Atlanta, Green said. Ironical
ly, the problem was further com
pounded by the construction of
housing.
"The gentrification of the neigh
borhood has squeezed out low-in

In the wake of the Olympics, low-income areas of Atlanta were devel
oped into Olympic Village housing and Centennial Park, displacing
many of the city's homeless residents.
