# Olympics united world, divide city
## 
### Vanessa Hua Editorial staff 
Before the Olympic redevelop
ment, Atlanta business leaders saw
the downtown area as vacant, bro
ken sidewalks and dilapidated
buildings — an embarrassment to
their city.
Homeless people saw those
streets as the place where they lived.
These diverging views over this
shared space show the ambivalence
and anticipation in Atlanta prior to
the Olympic Games, said Solomon
Green, who graduated from Stan
ford last year. The Olympics, often
touted as a meeting place for the
world, may also divide those within
the city by class and ethnicity.
In his honors thesis, Green
began to untangle this hydra's
snare. He examined the effects of
the preparation for the Atlanta
Olympics on urban poverty.
"The Olympics holds such an
ideological weight. It can be a posi
tive, uplifting force," Green said
"But we need to examine it critical
ly, both to see where it is valuable
and where it fails.

His research found that the Her
culean preparation for the Games
had a devastating effect on the
homeless and marginally housed
population.
"I wasn't looking for villains or
heroes," Green said. "My research
was about individuals — how differ
ent people viewed the same event, in
the same city, in the same space."
Built on 60 acres of downtown
land, Olympic Centennial Park is at
the symbolic heart of the dispute.
Sitting m the shadow of the CNN
and Coca-Cola buildings, the park
lies on the fault line between the
booming business district and the
low-income inner city.
As the Games approached, the
area became a prime target for rede
velopment, Green said.
The park displaced many of the
estimated 15,000 to 20,000 home
less in Atlanta, Green said. Ironical
ly, the problem was further com
pounded by the construction of
housing.
"The gentrification of the neigh
borhood has squeezed out low-in

In the wake of the Olympics, low-income areas of Atlanta were devel

many of the city's homeless residents.
come residents," Green said. "Sever
al housing projects were razed to
make room for Olympic village,
which was converted into Georgia
Tech dorms after the Games. Now,
there are fewer housing units avail
able."
Thus, the homeless shelters in
outlying suburbs have swelled be
yond capacity, Green said. And the
homeless are forced to move again.
"It's a diaspora of the poor,"
Green said. "The informal spaces
where they used to live are being
taken away. There's no place left to
go."
Security sweeps kept the home
less away from the public eye dur
ing the Games. Instead of fully
working toward solving the prob
lem, the city hid the homeless away,
Green said.
Cities bid for the Olympics, in
part, because they view the event
as a economic development tool.
The event generates construction,
international investment and a
world-class reputation Green
said.
However, the price of prestige is
high. Green questioned the true
worth of such economic growth,
which is fueled by low-paid labor.
"These mega events are not sus
tainable," Green said. "They inflate
the job market by providing short
term jobs in construction or hospi
tality."
The positions were also racially
charged, breaking down ethnic
lines. Predominantly African-
American males are forced into
these jobs, Green said.
"In some cases, workers were

paid below minimum wage," Green
said. "The jobs promoted dependen
cy and exploitation."
Presently, the International
Olympic Committee takes a hands
ofT approach with each host city,
Green said. Unfortunately, this
means each city starts from scratch,
relearning the lessons of the past.
Indeed, the ultimate expert of
the Games may not be the athletes
or the coaches. Rather, only the cor
porate sponsors consistently em
blazon their colors and cash along
side the Olympic rings.
"I talked to someone from Coca-
Cola who said that only corporate
sponsors were there year after
year," Green said. "They are the
backbone of the Games."
Green said he believes that in
creasing dialogue between host
cities is vital toward creat ing a truly
inclusive Olympics.
"The Olympics can be such a
positive force, for promoting com
munication and reducing poverty,"
Green said. "Information should
also be shared among community
groups to match need with the re
sources."
Green has a lot of experience in
these issues of urban poverty and
community empowerment. In the
summer of 1994, he became in
volved in activism while working
with the San Francisco branch of
the Empty the Shelters. In conjunc
tion with the Tenderloin Housing
Clinic, Green monitored tenant liv
ing conditions.
"I was witness to them," Green
said. "So I lobbied for local initia
tives and tenant rights."
By talking to other branches of
the activist group, Green became
aware of the problems in Atlanta.
That fall, Green felt frustrated
that his coursework did not seem to

apply to his interest in public ser
vice.
"It was difficult coming back.
Classes in urban planning and rede
velopment seemed so theoretical,"
Green said. "The connections
weren't being made with my sum
mer experiences."
Therefore, Green looked for
ways to integrate his interests, aca
demic and activist. He found the so
lution in the Public Service Schol
ars program, a group of students
who combine service learning with
writing an honors thesis.
"With my thesis, I had the space
to tackle both issues, to see how
they how they are related," Green
said. "Without that experience, I
would have left dissatisfied with my
academics."
His thesis, "Olympia Was Not a
City: Poverty, Planning and the Re
structuring of Urban Space in
Olympic Atlanta," received a 1996
Firestone award, which goes to the
top 10 percent of honors theses in
the natural and social sciences, said
Laura Selznick, director of the
URO.
Currently, Green continues his
public service in the John Gardner
fellowship, a accelerated 10-month
public service program. He is a
member of the Welfare Task Force,
which is part of the San Francisco's
Mayor's Office.
"Welfare — as we have known in
the latter part of the 20th century
— is being dismantled. Over the
next few years, many people will be
losing benefits such as SSI and
AFDC," Green said. "San Francisco
wants to maintain and improve
housing in the face of reduced re
sources."
Surely, dedicated public service
workers such as Green are part of
that solution.

said. "So I lobbied for local initia
tives and tenant rights."
By talking to other branches of
the activist group, Green became
aware of the problems in Atlanta.
That fall, Green felt frustrated
that his coursework did not seem to

apply to his interest in public ser
vice.
"It was difficult coming back.
Classes in urban planning and rede
velopment seemed so theoretical,"
Green said. "The connections
weren't being made with my sum
mer experiences."
Therefore, Green looked for
ways to integrate his interests, aca
demic and activist. He found the so
lution in the Public Service Schol
ars program, a group of students
who combine service learning with
writing an honors thesis.
"With my thesis, I had the space
to tackle both issues, to see how
they how they are related," Green
said. "Without that experience, I
would have left dissatisfied with my
academics."
His thesis, "Olympia Was Not a
City: Poverty, Planning and the Re
structuring of Urban Space in
Olympic Atlanta," received a 1996
Firestone award, which goes to the
top 10 percent of honors theses in
the natural and social sciences, said
Laura Selznick, director of the
URO.
Currently, Green continues his
public service in the John Gardner
fellowship, a accelerated 10-month
public service program. He is a
member of the Welfare Task Force,
which is part of the San Francisco's
Mayor's Office.
"Welfare — as we have known in
the latter part of the 20th century
— is being dismantled. Over the
next few years, many people will be
losing benefits such as SSI and
AFDC," Green said. "San Francisco
wants to maintain and improve
housing in the face of reduced re
sources."
Surely, dedicated public service
workers such as Green are part of
that solution.
