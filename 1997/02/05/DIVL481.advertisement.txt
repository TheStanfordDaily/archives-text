For at least a millennium there have been debates in the European tradition
about realities, rationalities, truths, objectivities, etc. There are also long
standing debates about the accumulated human strategies for making
knowledge: empiricisms, solipcisms, relativisms, positivisms, and so on.
Similarly, these issues have been explored for millennia in other intellectual
traditions, such as those in west, south, and east Asia. Historians understand
that every one of these key words has a distinctive and significant history.
They now know that these debates were also about institutions, economics,
status, and politics, not easily separable from the intellectual positions about
ways of knowing.
The current manifestation of these debates in the United States and Great
E3ritain under the name of 'science wars' is no exception. What is the
institutional political economy of the American science wars'? A fifty-year
long funding ecology that supported the stunning expansion of American
academic disciplinary research fields has ended, along with the cold war. All
who benefited from that ecology [both those in power' and the opposition']
are now under duress. The science wars are about who really knows what,
about whose way of knowing is the best strategy for making sense in these
unstable times, about whose work must survive and whose might be
eliminated when there is not enough to go around.
