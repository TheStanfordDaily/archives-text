## Jury finds Simpson liable Former football star to pay hefty civil penalties 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - A civil jury
found O.J. Simpson liable yesterday for the slash
ing deaths of his ex-wife and her friend, a moral
victory for grieving relatives who felt the football
great got away with murder.
The jury ordered him to pay $8.5 million in com
pensatory damages and will return tomorrow to
hear arguments on whether to award millions
more in punitive damages.
As the verdict was read, Simpson remained
stoic, staring straight ahead.
Across the courtroom, a whoop of joy went up
from the relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman.
"Yes!" screamed sister Kim Goldman, in con
trast to the way she sobbed openly when Simpson
was acquitted of murder 16 months ago.
As the jury was polled and it became apparent it
was unanimous, Fred and Patti Goldman raised
their arms in exultation.
Sharon Rufo, Goldman's estranged natural moth
er, who was a plaintiff, fell into the arms of
Dominique Brown, Ms. Simpson's sister, and sobbed
silently throughout the reading of the verdicts.
The mostly white panel, forced to start delibera
tions anew last Friday after a juror was removed for
misconduct, snatched away some of the vindication
Simpson claimed when he was acquitted of murder
by a mostly black jury in 1995.
This civil jury, using the lesser standard of "pre
ponderance of evidence" rather than "beyond a rea
sonable doubt," was unanimous on all counts in
blaming Simpson for the June 12, 1994, slayings.
The $8.5 million represented the value of Gold
man's funeral and the loss of Goldman's compan

ionship to his parents. Ms. Simpson's family did not
seek compensatory damages.
The jury's findings of malice and oppression trig
gered the second phase to determine punitive dam
ages — money assessed to punish Simpson.
Already, the plaintiffs' attorneys have asked for
and received Simpson's latest financial records in
preparation for a punitive phase.
Christopher Darden, a prosecutor in Simpson's
criminal trial, told CNBC: "We said all along that
O.J Simpson committed these crimes and all we
asked . . . was our day in court. A fair hearing. A fair
hearing on the issues. And I believe that we've done
that, that that's been accomplished."
The jury reached the verdict after 17 hours of
deliberations over three days — more than five
times as long as the criminal jury deliberated.
The wrongful death case brought by the vic
tims' families was an abbreviated version of the
criminal trial — 41 days of testimony rather than
133 — but with key rulings that took away the
cameras and racial fireworks and with the addi
tion of startling new evidence.
Most incriminating for Simpson were 31 photos
of him wearing the same style Bruno Magli shoes
that left bloody footprints at the crime scene.
Plaintiffs in the civil trial moved quickly
through the dreary detail of blood drops and DNA
evidence, hitting hard on a possible motive — a
history of spousal abuse.
And as the trial drew to a close, plaintiff attor
neys took direct aim at Simpson's character, angri
ly portraying him as a coward trying to "deny the
undeniable." Said attorney Daniel Petrocelli:
"There's a killer in this courtroom."
