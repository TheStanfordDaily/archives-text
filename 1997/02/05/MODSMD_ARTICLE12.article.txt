# Clinton stresses education
## Also calls for finance reform in address to Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sum
moned by President Clinton to
"seize the days and the century,"
Republican lawmakers are trying
to turn the challenge back on the
Democratic White House to show
the way to a balanced federal bud
get with tax relief.
"Words are nice. We're wait
ing for the deeds," Senate Major
ity Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said last night after Clinton's
State of the Union address before
a packed House chamber and a
nationally televised audience. "Is
this truly the end of big govern
ment as we know it or will we find
dozens of new Washington
spending programs in the presi
dent's budget?"
And despite bows all around to
the ideal of cooperation, there was
ample evidence that partisanship
was alive and well.
Lott scheduled the opening of
Senate debate for today on a con
stitutional amendment to balance
the budget — a key Republican pri
ority that Clinton argued against
Tuesday night as "unnecessary
and unwise" and a potential threat
to Social Security.
For his part, the re-elected
president opened his remarks
with a none-too-subtle message
that the political tables were
turned from two years ago, when
the GOP unquestionably was
ascendant. "I think I should start
by saying, 'Thanks for inviting
me back,' " he declared to the
delight of Democrats.
Clinton received a president's
customary standing ovation as he
entered the House chamber. But
this was a night unlike any other,
and even his audience's attention
was split between the speech and
word that a verdict was imminent
in the O.J. Simpson wrongful
death case in California.
"What's the O.J. verdict?" Sen.
Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asked a
group of reporters as he left the
hall following Clinton's 60-
minute speech during which the
president urged Congress to com
plete work on three items of
"unfinished business," including
balancing the budget, reopening
the new welfare law to restore
benefits to legal immigrants and
enacting campaign finance
reform by July 4.
He outlined steps that would
boost education spending by 20
percent, to $51 billion for fiscal
1998, including tax breaks for col
lege. Americans, he said, must
have "the best education in the
world." To build public support for
his proposal, Clinton arranged a

trip today to Georgia, the first in
what the White House would be a
series of appearances.
He said the 1998 budget he
will send to Congress tomorrow
would "balance the budget and
provide middle class tax relief to
pay for education and health
care, to help raise a child, to buy
and sell a home."
He noted that there were just
over 1,000 days remaining until
2000, and added, "let us seize the
days and the century."
For their formal response,
Republicans turned to Rep. J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, the only
black GOP member of Congress.
"The strength of America is not
in Washington," Watts said. "The
strength of America is at home,
in lives well lived in the land of
faith and family."
But for all the party's effort to

showcase Watts, it is the response
of Lott and other GOP leaders that
will matter most in the months
ahead, beginning with Clinton's
and his return trip to the Capitol
next week to meet with congres
sional leaders privately.
"I am very pleased that Presi
dent Clinton has so heartily
endorsed the Republican agen
da," said Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the House GOP whip.
"The president has proven time
and again that he can talk the
talk. The question tonight is: Can
he walk the walk?"
Said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-
N.M., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee: "It just seems
like there was an awful lot of gov
ernment in this speech. We're
going to have to evaluate that
carefully. He can't possibly get
everything he wants."
