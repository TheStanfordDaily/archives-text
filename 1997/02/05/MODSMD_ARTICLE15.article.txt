The University must
ensure academic tone
of public service minor

A GROUP OF students affili
ated with the ASSU's "Uni
versity for Students" cam
paign have been working to create
a public service minor. It's unclear,
as of now, exactly what the propo
nents of the measure envision, but
it is imperative that whatever
form such a minor takes, it be aca
demically grounded and used to
supplement curriculum.
Within the broad context of the
University's mission, it does not
seem appropriate to create a pro
gram granting students a minor
for merely volunteering in the
community without considering
academic problems related to the
fieldwork.
Most students agree that volun
teer work is essential to a full
understanding of a field of study
and that this type of experience
supplements what they're learn
ing on the Farm. It makes sense to
integrate real-world experience
into class work.
The students calling for the
establishment of a public service
minor are basically asking for
recognition of their hard work. The
University does not have a respon
sibility or an obligation to include
work experience on transcripts;
after all, that's what resumes are
for. But any work that has a direct
connection to a student's academic
program should be listed. This
work experience is likely to be as
educational as any class.
While the concept of a public
service minor sounds innovative,
it is very similar to programs in,
among others places, the Urban
Studies Program and the History
Department. Both currently offer
units for fieldwork and have an
academic focus. Often, colloquia
and independent research oppor

tunities also integrate academic
study of urban problems with com
munity fleldwork into a defined
and clearly academic context.
For example, Urban Studies 194
allows urban studies majors to
work in a community organization
and, after writing a paper based on
their work, receive five units. But
Urban Studies 194 is open only to
students majoring in the program.
Students who wish to minor in
urban studies do not receive units
for public service work.
The Urban Studies Program
currently offers its majors three
different areas of concentration,
including one on community orga
nizations. That concentration,
which focuses on community insti
tutions and social science research
methods, currently has about 14
declared majors.
For urban studies minors, how
ever, there is no equivalent option.
Minors must chose to concentrate
either in urban planning or archi
tecture and urban design. Neither
of these concentrations incorpo
rates public service work.
It seems that the foundation
exists for an effective program for
students who wish to minor in
public service without necessarily
creating a whole new minor. As of
right now, only one student is
minoring in urban studies. It
seems then that with relatively
little disturbance to those in the
program, the minor could be
restructured to include a public
service element.
Students should work with the
Urban Studies Program to develop
a new minor that will allow for
public service credit, while at the
same time exploring academic
issues.
A public service minor is an idea
with merit, as long as it's done in
an context appropriate to an aca
demic institution. Students should
only be compensated with units
for community activity as long as
it's part of a course integrating
hands-on community work into a
larger academic backdrop.
