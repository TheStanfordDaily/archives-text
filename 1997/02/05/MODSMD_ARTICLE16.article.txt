Cyprus consul general responds to Turkish students

THE TURKISH STUDENT Associ
ation, according to Esin
Terzioglu's Wednesday letter,
claims the views I conveyed during my
recent talk at Stanford "are not all rep
resentative of the truth." I note that
they did not challenge my statements
about Turkey's dismal human rights
record in both Turkey and Cyprus. Fur
thermore they say nothing about the 90-
percent inflation rate and the 30-percent
unemployment in the occupied territo
ries in contrast to the flourishing econo
my of free Cyprus.
Turkey invaded and dismembered
Cyprus in 1974, although as a guaran
tor power, together with Greece and
the United Kingdom, Turkey had
vowed to uphold Cyprus's territorial
integrity. That Turkey had "the right
to intervene unilaterally" appears to be
absurd since U.N. Security Council
Resolution 353 adopted on the first day
of the invasion speaks of the withdraw
al of all military personnel without
delay. The claim that Turkey invaded
Cyprus "to protect the safety of the

Turkish-Cypriot community" is ludi
crous since no incidents of bloodshed
took place during the seven years pre
ceding the invasion.
As to the 1,619 persons missing,
there were five Americans whose fates
were never investigated or ascertained.
The number of missing consists of both
military personnel and civilians, includ
ing women and children, some of whom
were known to be alive and in the cus
tody of the Turkish army, both in
Cyprus and in Turkey, immediately
after the cessation of the hostilities.
As to Turkey being "the only truly
secular, Muslim-majority country," why
is it that the teaching of religion is com
pulsory in schools? The rise in Islamic
fundamentalism in Turkey is a fact. And
anybody who wants to see Turkey
remain secular should address the rea
sons for the change we are witnessing.
My remarks referred to concerns
which have appeared in such prestigious
newspapers as The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal about
alliances and agreements that Necmet

tin Erbakan, the prime minister of
Turkey and leader of the fundamental
ist Refah party, is making that are in
opposition to the true interests of the
United States. Time and again the gov
ernment of the United States has
relayed its concerns to the course
Erbakan has charted.
After some 24 U.N. resolutions, which
were never enforced and which Turkey
ignored with impunity, the Turkish Stu
dents Association Executive Committee
comes up with what is an acceptable res
olution to the Cyprus problem "uniting
the two sides in a bizonal federal system
as agreed in the 1977 agreements." The
government of Cyprus has accepted a
solution based on the 1977 and 1979
agreements, the latter calling among oth
ers for the total demilitarization of
Cyprus and the restoration of Human
Rights for all the citizens.
If Turkey is concerned about the wel
fare of the Turkish Cypriot community
why does it object to Cyprus' total demil
itarization unless it interferes with its
expansionist plans in the region? After

22 years of negotiations an agreement
eludes us. Who is to engage in "good
willed" negotiations? The victim or the
aggressor?
The Turkish Cypriots today are the
greater victims of the 1974 Turkish
invasion and continuing occupation of
37 percent of Cyprus. Their population
on the island has dwindled from 18 per
cent in 1974 to 9 percent through emi
gration, after the paradise created for
them in the occupied territories by the
importation from Turkey of some 88,000
settlers and propped up by an army of
occupation of 35,000.
Accession of Cyprus into the Euro
pean Union will be the best guarantee
for the protection of human rights for all
its citizens. Having just read the U.S.
State Department's human rights report
on Turkey, it is fair to conclude that for
Turkey to become a member of the Euro
pean Union it has to drastically improve
its human rights record and change its
orientation to a European one.
