# University's obligations extend beyond campus
## 
### 
As a university student and as the
child and dependent of a university
employee, it would be convenient for me
to believe that universities have no
moral and social obligations beside the
objective pursuit of knowledge. It is easy
to buy into the logic that a university is
a morally privileged entity; I suspect it
is even easier to buy into this faulty

logic when you are in a position to be
held responsible for a university's
morality, as University President Ger
hard Casper is.
And yet the most cursory analysis
shows us that this kind of thinking can
take us strange places indeed. Since the
University "cannot take collective action
on the issues of the day," I wonder if it
would be acceptable, if not for the
inconvenient matter of legality, for
Stanford to employ child labor â€” as a
means of preserving freedom of dissent,
a respect for free inquiry and so on. And

yet even as I imagine this seemingly
absurd and clearly reprehensible sce
nario, it occurs to me that Stanford Uni
versity already does profit from child
labor, albeit child labor employed by
companies we invest in.
By its very nature, Stanford can
never abstain from taking collective
action on social issues. In maintaining
affirmative action in admissions and
hiring, even as it is abolished across the
state, Stanford makes a bold statement
on a very contentious issue. Even the
present debate about ROTC forces

Stanford to make a moral judgment,
between respecting the rights of homo
sexual students and making it possible
for other students to afford a Stanford
education. There is a real world outside
the ivory tower, and we cannot choose
to ignore it.
Like it or not, President Casper, the
mission to establish a "searching and
candid discussion of public issues" does
not render us too important to live by
the conclusions we draw.
