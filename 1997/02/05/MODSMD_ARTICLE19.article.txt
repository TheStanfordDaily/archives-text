## Bret J. Logue Casper misguided on investment issue 
### 
MANY students
believe that the
University
should invest responsi
bly. Even the trustees
have a Special Commit
tee on Investment
Responsibility. In fact,
the only sincere opposi
tion has come from

those who think any
type of corporate investment is irrespon
sible. Why then does our University,
which claims to be a locus of enlightened
thought, act counter to what is nearly
unanimously agreed upon to be the cor
rect, moral position?
The initial response by University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper was to say that
Stanford invests responsibly already. In
support of his claim he cites the figure that
48 percent of the companies invested in are
responsible (that's $1 billion of the $3.5-
billion endowment). This still leaves 71
percent of the money invested irresponsi
bly. And it is the amount of money, not the
number of companies, that counts most.
As argument against responsible
investment, Casper has said, quoting a
First Amendment scholar, that a universi
ty "cannot take collective action on the
issues of the day without endangering the
conditions for its existence and effective
ness." What the president fails to admit,
however, is that there are times when
maintaining some banal ideal of intellectu
al authenticity results in the oppression of

innocents. Further quoting that scholar,
Casper said his viewpoint comes "not out
of a lack of courage nor out of indifference
and insensitivity."
Never, however, has a university presi
dent made a statement showing a greater
"lack of courage," a greater "indifference,"
a greater "insensitivity" to the needs of
oppressed peoples. My viewpoint arises out
of a respect for the needs of those not well
pampered by the comforts of intellectual
life and "free inquiry." Casper's arises out
of ivory-tower ignorance.
Counter to Casper's ideal, members of
the administration have suggested that
investment in irresponsible companies
could be used to persuade these companies
to change their harmful policies; therefore,
by this logic, divestment is potentially a
bad thing. If these two positions appear to
you to be contradictory — not wanting to
be political but willing to attempt political
influence — you are right. Such a contra
diction makes one suspicious that any
attempt to involve the University in the act
of influencing a corporation might be met
with strong opposition.
This is exactly what happened last year
when students tried to get the University to
divest from Texaco. They found that
regardless of how much work they did, their
efforts rarely, if ever, resulted in any action
on the part of the University. Meanwhile,
Stanford goes on with its investments, con
tent that people believe some due process
exists, and merrily collect blood money from
the coffers of dangerous corporations.

The only possible solution is to create
standards for responsible investment.
Opposing this idea, Casper claims that
choices of responsibility are impossible to
make and therefore add undue burden to
the process of investment. However, the
University could very easily adopt the
standards proposed by the Domini Social
Index or, if they wished, create their own.
A list of companies could then be used by
the Stanford Management Co. to make
decisions about investments.
Let's take the most extreme position
counter to the "Don't ask, don't sell" poli
cy that Casper supports. What about cre
ating a special committee to propose
changes to the internal policies of certain
irresponsible corporations? The trustees
could theft use their fiscal influence for the
betterment of humanity.
University investment responsibility is'
not an issue limited only to Stanford. A
national network of students cuuld be cre
ated to coordinate the collective power of
university wealth to influence companies
by investing with the intent to influence.
This maintains the power of influence but
recognizes the necessity for responsibility.
The future of investment begins with
this campaign. The idea of investment
responsibility has long ago matured, and it
is time for Stanford University to catch up
with the present.
