## State mentoring initiative attracts students, faculty 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A few Stanford students and
faculty are joining others through
out the state in finding ways to
give back to the community — not
with money but with time.
Eight members of the Stanford
community have joined Gov. Pete
Wilson, former Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart, East Palo Alto police
officers and many others to volun
teer as mentors under the gover
nor's California Mentor Initiative.
The initiative aims to reduce alco
hol and drug use, teen pregnancy,
educational failure and gang vio
lence among the state's youth by
recruiting and training 250,000
mentors to reach 1 million at-risk
youth within the next four years.
"The mentor program is im
mensely successful," said Marian
Bergeson, Wilson's newly elected

child development and education
secretary. "It'c a program that
shows a great deal of cooperation
and concern from various commit
tees and individuals."
Bergeson, the governor's top
educational adviser and a member
of the state cabinet, met with
school administrators and men
tors at the 49ers Academy in East
Palo Alto in a roundtable discus
sion about the mentoring program
there.
"Government doesn't really
make the difference — it's the peo
ple that do," she said at the discus
sion, adding that she hopes the
program at the 49ers Academy
will be emulated throughout the
state.
Junior Eric Demmitt explained
that the program is helping him
satisfy a human biology intern
ship for his major. "It's a good op
portunity to get away from the
hustle and bustle of Stanford life
to spend time with a kid, hear
what's going on in his life and see
how different it is from yours,"
said Demmitt, who volunteers as
a mentor at the 49ers Academy.
The academy is currently
working in collaboration with
New Perspectives East Palo Alto,
a statewide nonprofit organiza
tion that works in close coopera
tion with the Ravenswood School
District to supply mentors and
other services for East Palo Alto
youth.
The program "offers tutoring
and mentoring combined, be
cause those are where I've found
the focus and needs of the kids,"
said Tracy Krueger, mentor coor
dinator of the New Perspectives
agency.
"I think it's fun because you

get to learn things that other
schools don't teach or refuse to
teach," said eighth-grader Tyson
Washington, Demmitt's
"mentee" at the 49ers Academy.
Washington said what he likes
most about Demmitt is the fact
that "he's funny, he likes to do a
lot of things and he helps me a lot
with homework."
William Donoghue, a post-doc
toral teaching fellow in the Eng
lish Department, said the pro
gram provides a "big brother con
text" for youth, encouraging
them "to stay out of trouble and to
take a positive attitude toward
knowledge."
"This is really an awful situa
tion — west side of [Highway] 101
being this self-satisfied shangri-la
of perks over here, while east of
101 is a whole lot of desperation,"
he said. "My view is, share a bit of
the privilege.
"If you don't have money, you
can always spare a little bit of time
— put something back into the
community and into a part of the
community that needs it,"

Donoghue added.
Krueger said the program is a
"collaborative effort" among vari
ous groups in the community in
cluding schools, the Boy's and
Girl's Club and the East Palo Alto
Police Department.
"Mentoring is much more than
just tutoring," said Lea Smith, a
visiting scholar in the School uf
Education who mentors two stu
dents.
"You have the opportunity to
grow as well as to help someone
else enlarge their sense of reali
ty," she said.
The mentors spend one hour a
week in training and about two
hours throughout the week with
their mentees, encouraging them,
helping them in academics and
spending time in recreational ac
tivities.
Junior Youssef Tanagho, an
other mentor at the 49ers Acade
my, also said he became involved
in the program through his in
ternship in human biology.
"It's a simple idea but it's a
good one," he said.
