# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## The 						alarm clock: an unrelenting weapon of terror 
### 
QUESTION: Why did the boy throw
the alarm clock out the window?
Answer: Because it wouldn't shut up.
"Brrrrzzzgggggzzz!!!" Being an alarm
clock must be the most thankless job in
the world. Not only are you always on
call, but it is your job to make sure that
any blissful, peaceful slumber is inter
rupted by a horrific combination of nois
es designed to scare psychopathic mani
acs into quick submission. Kind of like
country music.
" Brrrrzzzgggggzzz!!!"
As a typical college student with a
sleep debt large enough to finance a small
country, it is easy to see how the alarm
clock has become my nemesis. It is unre
lenting, unforgiving and so damn annoy
ing. Most people don't know this, but the
alarm clock was designed during World
War II as a torture device. It was dropped
behind enemy lines from huge hot air
balloons with the hope that the Germans
would lose so much sleep they would just
give back Poland as long as the Allies
would agree to let them take a nap.
Alarm clocks, no matter how much we

hate them, obviously serve some sort of a
purpose, or else why would we have
them? (Don't try using the same logic on
tonsils.) Without alarm clocks, we
wouldn't get up until noon. We would
miss all our morning classes. Without
alarm clocks, we would miss the sun ris
ing and the birds singing. Not to mention
that we would all miss out on drinking
massive amounts of coffee just to stay
awake. Now that I think about it, maybe
alarm clocks are just an evil ploy used by
the coffee industry to keep us hooked on
those beans. But I digress.
My favorite thing about alarm clocks
is the snooze button. It's as if the alarm
clock is saying "just kidding, Jeremy, go
back to sleep... . Sorry to bother you."
What kind of sissy alarm clock is this,
anyway? It tries to scare me out of bed
with a satanic, shrill "brrzzggzzz!!!" with
roughly the volume of an air raid siren,
but then it has a button the size of Wis
consin right smack dab in the middle just
in case I'm "not in the mood" to get up. I
wish professors had snooze buttons:
"Just kidding, Jeremy, hand that paper

in later. .. . Sorry to bother you."
One thing that I don't understand
about the snooze button is the fact that
there is no industry standard proclaim
ing precisely how long a "snooze" should
be. I called the U.S. Bureau of Weights
and Measures in Washington, and they
told me that they have yet to make an
official ruling on the matter. An informal
poll of my housemates, however, con
cludes that a snooze can currently last
anywhere from four to 15 minutes,
depending on the alarm. Personally, I
feel that four minutes would define more
of a "nod" than a snooze, while 15 min
utes would actually be a "slumber." As
far as I'm concerned, only snoozes lasting
around nine minutes should qualify offi
cially as a "snooze." Write your senator
today.
Of course, snooze buttons have their
downside. Many people I know have
become hooked on "the snooze." They
deny any reliance on "the button," but
they know that they just can't wake up in
the morning without one more snooze.
"Give me one more snooze!" they cry. "I

just need my fix." Then they rob a conve
nience store. It really is a very sad, sad,
familiar tale. This addiction to snooze
affects one out of every 10 Stanford stu
dents, and then it affects their room
mates. If you know someone suffering
from snooze-dependence, I recommend
an intervention similar to that after
school special where all those kids (and
their really cool science teacher) went to
that girl's house and told her that they
loved her and that if she didn't quit doing
drugs they wouldn't be her friends any
more.
If that doesn't work, tell her in your
best Marlon Brando imitation, "I'll give
you an offer you can't re-snooze." Then
leave a horse's head in her bed. That'll
get 'er.
My roommate never snoozes. He does
this by putting his alarm clock clear
across the room. Every morning, he
stumbles out of bed and tumbles towards
the sound of children dying, then fum
bles with the buttons until it stops. At
this point, however, the alarm is off. If he
were to get back into bed, he would pro

ceed to sleep until a reasonable hour. So
as a public service to him I try to leave as
many books, clothes and shards of bro
ken glass between his alarm clock and his
bed so be doesn't even consider making
the journey back.
Life, I've determined, is just the jock
eying for power between a man and his
alarm clock. I find myself taking naps in
the middle of the day, hoping my alarm
clock doesn't notice. And sometimes it
doesn't. But then I'll make it stop shriek
ing in the morning, just to hear it again
nine minutes later. Sometimes I try to
trick it by setting the clock ahead. But,
alas, I can never win. Life, as we know it,
has become the constant struggle of good
vs. evil, love vs. hate and sleep vs. that
ungodly sound emanating from iny clock
radio every morning.
