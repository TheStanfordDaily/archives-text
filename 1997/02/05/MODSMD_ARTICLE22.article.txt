The African and Afro-American Studies
Program has rescinded its invitation to
Leonard Jeffries, an African American studies
scholar who had been invited to speak in the
program's ongoing "Black Issues in Higher Ed
ucation" lecture series.
Jeffries, a professor in the Black Studies De
partment at the City College of New York, had
verbally agreed to appear. However, according
to African and Afro-American Studies Chair
Morris Graves, Jeffries did not submit a letter
of agreement on time regarding the terms of
his speaking engagement.
According to Graves, response to Jeffries'
initial invitation was divided. "Some people
were extremely excited about the idea . . . and
some put forth reservations." However, he said
both sides "were represented in the conversa
tion about his scholarship and personal histo

ry.
Clayborne Carson, a history professor who
teaches in the African and Afro-American Stud
ies Program, said Graves initially extended the
invitation without consulting the department.
Carson said "there wasn't very much support"
among faculty for Jeffries' proposed speech, and
the invitation was rescinded after Graves met
with department faculty to discuss the subject.
"It was felt among the black faculty that

there was not enough redeeming pedagological
value" to merit an invitation, said Psychology
Prof. Claude Steele. Both the late submission
of the letter of agreement and the informal dis
cussion of the black faculty contributed to the
withdrawal of Jeffries' invitation, he added.
Opposition to Jeffries stems from a speech
he gave in 1991, in which he made several anti-
Semitic remarks, including an assertion that
Jews financed the slave trade. Excerpts from
the speech were published in the New York
Post, and Jeffries was removed from his posi
tion as chair of the Black Studies Department
at the City College of New York.
Jeffries sued the department, claiming that
his dismissal violated his First Amendment
right of free speech. A federal judge ruled in his
favor, but the Supreme Court overturned that
decision, claiming that Jeffries' remarks con
stituted a "reasonable disruption" to universi
ty operations.
While there was no organized opposition to
Jeffries speaking at Stanford, members of
groups such as the Center for Studies in Race
and Ethnicity said they were disturbed by Jef
fries' invitation.
According to History Prof. George Fredrick
son, the co-director of the research institute at
the center, the center "did not as an organiza
tion have a role in the decision to rescind the
invitation." Headded, however, thatthecenter

"did play a role in bringing together interested
parties to discuss the question."
Fredrickson explained that the opposition
to Jeffries questioned whether "giving [Jef
fries] a platform was worth the hostility that
he might cause between groups at Stanford."
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein said he
was "very pleased" to hear that Jeffries will not
speak at the University. Zipperstein called Jef
fries a "well-known and vociferous dema
gogue," questioned Jeffries' academic creden
tials and said he "would have been surprised" if
Jeffries had spoken at Stanford.
Carson claimed that he personally had no
problem with a controversial figure speaking
at Stanford, as long as the figure had some
other "scholarly, intellectual or political im
portance." However, he said that Jeffries' "sig
nificance as a scholar didn't justify inviting
him" to speak.
Jeffries is "one of those people whose impor
tance comes entirely from the fact that he's
controversial," Carson added.
Joseph White, a psychology professor emer
itus at UC-Irvine, has accepted the program's
invitation to speak in place of Jeffries. He was
the second choice for the April date on which
Jeffries was scheduled.
White is the "father of black psychology,"
Graves said. "He is well-respected in the field
and has been around a long time."
