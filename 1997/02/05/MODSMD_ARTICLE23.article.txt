## 'Molehills' discovered on the sun's surface Stanford researchers hope to construct a 3-D model of star detailing new information

Most people tend to take the
sun for granted despite its
importance in everyday life. Two
Stanford scientists, however, do
not.
Physics Prof. Philip Scherrer
and Research Associate Richard
Bogart are working with astro
physics researchers from numer
ous universities and the Nation
al Aeronautics and Space
Administration to analyze data
collected from a satellite
launched in December 1995.
The satellite, called the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory,
allowed the team to make a
unique discovery: The sun has
"bumps" on it which are about a
half-mile high and five times as
wide as the diameter of the
Earth.
In particular, one instrument
aboard the satellite delivered the
observations which led up to the
discovery.
The Michelson Doppler
Imager is capable of taking mea
surements of rotational velocity,
brightness and magnetic field
strength. The instrument con
sists of a series of filters, mirrors
and polarizers which eliminate
unneeded wavelengths of light to
create a more specific measure
ment.
In addition, the polarizers
allow the detection of frequency
splitting caused by the sun's
magnetic field. The picture of

the sun which results after fil
tering and polarization is fed
into a detector, where the data is
converted into electronic form
and beamed back to Earth.
This instrument is so sensi
tive that it can detect a spot the
size of a quarter placed on the
surface of the moon. Because the
satellite — known as SOHO — is

1 million miles out in space, it
can obtain detailed and accurate
measurements without interfer
ence from Earth's atmosphere,
which scatters the sun's energy.
These recently discovered
"bumps" on the surface of the
sun are not a complete surprise,
however. Astrophysicists have
known about other similar phe

nomena, such as granulation
and supergranulation, for as
long as 30 years.
A granulation is a surface dis
turbance that is about 1,000
kilometers wide and exists for
about 10 minutes. A supergran
ulation is 10 times larger and
lasts for about 10 hours.
The most recent discovery,

however, is of unprecedented
size. The "molehills" that Scher
rer and Bogart helped to discov
er are much larger than super
granulations. More important,
they last as long as 27 days, the
period of a solar rotation.
Based on the data from SOHO
and previous knowledge, astro
physicists have concluded that

the process of ultra-hot nuclear
fusion that powers the sun
occurs at the core of the star.
Energy radiates outward
from the core about 70 percent
of the way to the sun's surface.
The other 30 percent of the jour
ney is taken through a mass of
convection currents.
At the surface of the sun
there are sunspots, which are
areas of relatively low tempera
ture and high magnetic field
density.
The sun has an 11-year cycle
of increasing and decreasing
activity. SOHO was launched
during the most inactive portion
of the cycle.
In the future, Scherrer and
Bogart hope to construct a 3-D
model of the sun that illustrates
features such as the recently dis
covered solar bumps, granules
and supergranules.
Astrophysicists are also seek
ing to understand and predict
the eruption of solar flares,
which can pose problems for
Earth. A recent solar flare, in
fact, knocked out one of AT&T's
Telstar satellites.
In the next few years, Scher
rer and Bogart may be negotiat
ing the type of funding that will
be extended to the SOHO project
so that they can study most of an
11-year solar cycle.
In the meantime, SOHO con
tinues to function. It has enough
fuel to stay in orbit another 117
years.
