A responsive joystick

For computer game fanatics, a new technology pio
neered by a Stanford graduate promises to make play
ing the games a truly moving experience. A joystick
developed by Immersion, a new company launched by
Louis Rosenberg, Class of 1991, jolts and jumps
according to what happens on the computer screen.
For example, compressing a "spring" within the

game and then releasing it causes the joystick to
snap rapidly back against the hand. Already, some companies such
as Electronic Arts Inc. have encoded commands for the new joy
stick in their games. Dean Chang, Class of 1991, Immersion's
company engineer, hopes to persuade more companies to follow
suit.
Zach Meston, a computer game fan from San Marcos, Calif.,
told The Wall Street Journal that "there are a lot of gimmicky con
trollers out there, but this is one of the few that really adds to the
game-playing experience."
The technology involved, called "force feedback," was first
developed for use in military flight simulators. Although Immer
sion picked up the technology less than two years ago, the joystick
can already be seen on store shelves. CH products, a small compa
ny based in Vista, Calif., now sells a joystick based on Immersion's
technology for about $180.

New study for chronic depression

Depressed? Chronically depressed? Well, things
may soon get better. Bristol-Myers Squibb, a large
pharmaceutical company, recently launched an
unprecedented $20-million study of a new drug
designed to treat chronic depression.
The study involves 660 subjects and 12 research
institutions, including Stanford's School of Medicine,
in clinical testing of the drug Serzone.

Dr. Darlene Jody, senior medical director of Medical Opera
tions / Central Nervous Systems at Bristol-Myers Squibb, said in a
statement that "this is an exciting research project which is of great
interest to the scientific, medical and mental health care provider
communities because it will advance understanding about optimiz
ing treatment for chronic depression."
Over three years, doctors like Stanford's Alan Schatzberg, a
professor of psychiatry, will compare the effects of Serzone with a
form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavior therapy for
chronic depression. By October 1999, when the study is scheduled
to be completed, the researchers hope to have enough data to
determine the best therapy for patients suffering from chronic
depression.

Examining high-dose chemotherapy

For women with advanced ovarian cancer, the
options often seem bleak. However, choosing among
those options may be easier after a proposed study by
the National Cancer Institute which will determine the
comparative effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy
as opposed to conventional chemotherapy.
Currently, high-dose chemotherapy is riskier and

more expensive than conventional treatment, while
its benefits compared to the conventional treatment have not been
established.
The high-dose procedure costs $80,000 to $150,000, compared
with $15,000 to $40,000 for conventional procedures. The study
should clarify whether or not high-dose chemotherapy is worth
the risk and money.
Each year, ovarian cancer kills close to 15,000 women; 26,700
new cases are diagnosed annually.
The study will take place at medical centers around the coun
try, and preliminary results should be available in 2003. Radiation
Oncology Prof. J. Martin Brown at Stanford's School of Medicine
warns that high-dose chemotherapy, although effective at times,
may disappoint those seeking a major breakthrough.
"It's a very high-tech approach," he said. "1 think this is a small
step forward. It's not going to be a nuyor breakthrough, but it's an
improvement."
