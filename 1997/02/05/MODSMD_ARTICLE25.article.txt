# Predicting sleep apnea made easier
## 
### Elizabeth Springer 
Have you ever been awakened
by a loud, snoring roommate?
Certainly it's unpleasant for you,
but your roommate might not be
doing too well, either. Severe
snoring can be a sign of an
underlying sleep-related breath
ing disorder.
Clete Kushida, a staff physi
cian and senior research associ
ate, and his associates at Stan
ford's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
Research Center are investigat
ing a particular type of sleep
breathing disorder known as
obstructive sleep apnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea is
characterized by snoring, observ
able breathing pauses during
sleep and excessive daytime
sleepiness.
At Stanford's sleep center, a
diagnosis of obstructive sleep
apnea is typically confirmed by
an overnight sleep study, or
polysomnogram, in which elec
trodes record brain waves, respi
ration, muscle and eye move
ments and cardiac parameters,
as well as the blood-oxygen con
tent.
The name of the disorder
comes from its characteristic
breathing pauses, or apneas. In a
sufferer, decreases in airflow

known as hypopneas generally
last at least 10 seconds and occur
more than five times per hour of
sleep.
The potential health conse
quences of obstructive sleep
apnea include high blood pres
sure, heart attacks, cardiac
arrhythmia and strokes.
Potential treatment options
include weight loss, dental
devices, a specialized nasal air
pump and a surgery that corrects
abnormalities in the upper air
way that cause collapse during
sleep.
Kushida and his colleagues
have recently developed a model
that predicts obstructive sleep
apnea based on measurements
of the oral cavity, body mass and
neck circumference.
The procedure they have pio
neered takes less than five min
utes to perform.
In ongoing investigations,
Kushida is attempting to identi
fy the cranio-facial features
that predispose a person to
obstructive sleep apnea and
determine if those features are
hereditary.
The search for the gene asso
ciated with these cranio-facial
abnormalities is now underway
in families with a history of
obstructive sleep apnea.
