Q, How can there be so much
• water in rain clouds ?
A # When you're out on the
• Oval, sitting underneath
the bright, blue sky, on occasion
you might look up and see a few
big and fluffy clouds floating on
by.
Now, most people, when they
see the clouds will think, "Hey
— that looks like a dog," or,
"Hey — that looks like Estelle
Getty's haircut on 'Golden
Girls,' " but rarely does anyone
think, "hey — that looks like a
lot of water. I wonder how it all
stays up there?"
Most people know that liquid
water is denser than air. When
you have water and you have air,
the water goes down and the air
goes up. That's why rain falls.

So how does the water get up
there in the first place? And
when does it decide to fall?
When you were young, your
teachers probably told you that
water evaporated into the sky
and formed clouds and then fell
back down as rain. They proba
bly also put it to music and had
many bright and colorful visual
aids.
Well, it is true that water
evaporates, but it isn't quite
that simple.
The water molecules don't
just head straight up into the
sky and spontaneously decide
they're tired and want to fall
back down again. No, there are
laws of nature that actually gov
ern their behavior.
When water evaporates, it
becomes water vapor, which
essentially dissolves in air, just
like sugar dissolves in water.
When the water vapor dissolves
in air, you can't see it anymore,
just like sugar in water.
To be able to see the water, it
has to condense into its liquid
form — steam is actually water
vapor that has condensed to
form a fine mist of liquid water.
More water vapor can dissolve in
warm air, just like hot water dis
solves sugar better than cold
water.
Clouds are usually formed
when warm, humid air rises
upward, expands and cools. The
temperature decreases until it
reaches the dew point of the air

— the temperature at which the
solubility of water in the air
mass equals the amount of water
that is dissolved in it.
When this happens, no more
water can be dissolved in the air,
and if it gets any colder, some of
the water will have to condense
out.
You may have seen the ana
logue of this with sugar and
water if you've ever made rock
candy by dissolving sugar in hot
water and then letting the water
cool.
When the water cools enough,
the sugar comes out of solution
and forms sugar crystals. In the
sky, when the air cools down suf
ficiently, the water comes out of
solution and forms clouds.
The clouds are made up of
tiny water droplets supported by
upward currents of air. In order
for rain to fall, the droplets have
to become large enough to break

through the rising air currents. *
Just condensing out of the air
is not enough to get the clouds to
rain — the water drops have to
grow larger by either bumping
into a lot of other water drops or
being seeded by ice
formed at the tops of the clouds.-
Cloud seeding is nothing more
than adding chemicals to clouds
to promote the formation of
large water drops.
Still, it looks like the clouds
couldn't possibly hold that much
water.
Well, it turns out that most of
the water in the atmosphere is
not in the form of clouds, but in
the form of water vapor. This
means that even though there is
a lot of water up there in the
atmosphere, you can't see most
of it.
But at least you can still see
"Golden Girls" reruns on cable
late at night.
