## Tennis dedicates Taube Men take every set over Fresno State 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team (3-0) proved that it deserves
every bit of its No. 1 ranking yes
terday after ousting 13th-ranked
Fresno State (2-1) 7-0 on Stadi
um Dedication Day at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.
"In my 31 years coaching at
Stanford, this is one of the best
starts to a season I have ever
seen," said head coach Dick Gould.
"This was an awesome display of
tennis for this early in the season."

Such a steamrolling began in
the doubles when the Cardinal
soundly beat the Bulldogs across
the board. Stanford sophomore
Ryan Wolters and junior Paul
Goldstein crushed Kelly Gullett
and P.J. Dormire 8-1. Cardinal
freshmen twins Bob and Mike
Bryan defeated Fredric Giers
and Andy Scorteanu by the same
score.
"I felt like we were on and off
the court," said Bob Bryan. "We
were just really excited and
pumped up."
Bryan's brother agreed.

"For our first match at home,
it went better than expected,"
said Mike Bryan.
Rounding out the doubles,
the senior-freshman duo of
Grant Elliott and Geoff Abrams
beat the Bulldogs' A.J. De Leon
and Robert Lindstedt 8-2.
Elliott's experience combined
with the young talent of Abrams
proved too much for Fresno
State.
"Our freshmen bring so much
to this team," Elliott said. "They

are so excited and have so much
energy, it pumps everyone up.
Geoff carried me the whole way
in doubles."
Such flawless playing so early
in the season was perhaps most
evident at the No. 1 singles spot,
featuring 23rd-ranked Ryan
Wolters of Stanford against
13th-ranked Fredric Giers.
Last year Wolters suffered a
three-set loss to Giers 6-4, 4-6,
6-4. But with a year of experi
ence and a national champi
onship under his belt, Wolters
breezed past Giers yesterday 6-
4, 6-1.

"We have not beat a team that
highly ranked that badly in some
time," Gould said. "The guys
played aggressive tennis today."
Goldstein beat Scorteanu in
similar fashion 6-3, 6-3. Bob and
Mike Bryan turned in impressive
wins as well, beating Lindstedt
6-1, 6-1 and Gullett 6-3, 6-2.
"We were a little nervous
going into to the match, because
they are a highly ranked team,"
said Bob Bryan. "But it is good
to get a little uneasy because
then we get really fired up."
Finishing off the Bulldogs,
Elliott defeated Eni Ghidirmac
6-4, 6-4 and Abrams beat
Dormire 6-1, 6-2.
"We still have stuff to work
on," Gould said. "But this is def
initely a strong home opener for

the season. The tempo of the
matches were good. We were in
control."
The Cardinal hopes to pro
duce equally impressive results
beginning tomorrow, when team
members will travel to the Rolex
Individual Championships in
Dallas, which continue through
Sunday.
Bob Bryan qualified for the
singles draw after winning the
Northern State regional. The
Bryan brothers will compete in
the doubles draw as well.
Wolters and Goldstein will travel
as alternates.
The Cardinal will be back on
the Farm for its next dual
matches Feb. 14 and 15, when it
takes on San Diego State and
Washington, respectively.
