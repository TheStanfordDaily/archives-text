The second-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (5-0) took
care of business by easily sweeping
past No. 34 Fresno State (2-2) 9-0
yesterday.
The Bulldogs proved to be no
match for the Cardinal, who did
not drop a set all afternoon.
In singles, Stanford senior co
captain Katie Schlukebir rebound
ed from a rough weekend in Ari
zona by smashing Fresno State's
Dora Djilianova 6-2, 6-2.
Senior Ail-American Sandra De
Silva easily handled Kara
Warkentin 6-2, 6-3, while junior
Julie Scott handled Shana Pete 6-
0, 6-2. Freshman Teryn Ashley
made quick work of Laura
Townsend, bageling the hapless
Bulldog 6-0, 6-0. At the No. 6 slot,
freshman Jennifer Heiser topped
Terje Pallo 6-1,6-2.

"I think everybody played well
and got down to business to do the
job," Scott said.
The closest Fresno State came
to the Card occurred at the No. 3
singles spot, where junior Ail-
American Ania Bleszynski won her
first set against Liz Marupi 6-3
before squeezing out a hard-fought
7-5 second-set victory.
In the doubles competition,
Ashley and Schlukebir teamed up
to defeat Dijlianova and
Warkentin 8-3. Cardinal senior
Emily Burt teamed with freshman
Jennifer Heiser to take care of
Fresno State's Marupi and
Town send.
Junior Heidi Stalla and
Bleszynski joined forces to chal
lenge the Bulldogs' Pallo and
Pete, earning an 8-5 victory for
the Card.
"I think we all played really well
and efficiently," Stalla said. "It
wasn't the usual lineup but I think

everybody came together. I think
we will continue to play well and
get better. It is fun to be out there
because it is such a strong team."
The match served as a good
tune-up for the Rolex National
Intercollegiate Indoor Tennis
Championships, which will take
place in Dallas. The event will start
tomorrow and run through the
weekend.
"It was good to get some match
practice today," Scott said. "I think
that will give us confidence for the
Rolex. I think we are where we
want to be right now. We don't
want to be peaking now; we want
to be playing our best tennis in
May."
Stanford will be well repre
sented in the tournament, as five
of the 32 players there will be
wearing cardinal and white.
Schlukebir, Bleszynski, Scott,
Ashley and De Silva will play for
Stanford.
