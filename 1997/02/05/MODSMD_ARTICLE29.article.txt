# Sluggers shoot down feisty Golden Eagles

### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
After a tough weekend series against No.
11 Cal State-Fullerton, a single game against
â™¦nediocre Division II Cal State-Los Angeles
f2-6) may have seemed a little anticlimactic.
But the Stanford baseball team (4-2) was
able to shed its apathetic shell and hand the
Golden Eagles a 7-5 loss at Sunken Diamond
yesterday.
Sophomore second baseman Tony
Schrager admitted that enthusiasm was diffi
cult to get back after the exciting weekend
series.
"It's tough to get up for a game after you've
just gotten back from a long series down
south," Schrager said. "That's probably why
we came out a little flat."
Starting pitching was especially depleted
after last weekend's games. Stanford's three
starters, junior Kyle Peterson and sopho
mores Chad Hutchinson and Jeff Austin, were
all unavailable after starting games against
the Titans.
"We were a little short-handed, pitching
wise," said Cardinal head coach Mark Mar

quess. "But we did well."
Junior right-hander Adam Harris, usually
counted on for relief duties, took over at the
helm for the Card and slogged through five
innings of mediocre ball in his first career
start. Dueling with him on the mound was
Los Angeles right-hander Jeff Verplancke,
who pitched against every Stanford batter. He
was slapped with his second loss.
The Golden Eagles jumped out in front
early when second baseman Uriel Casillas
smacked a one-out solo home run in the first.
Harris was able to answer back, though, and
retire the rest of the batters to end the top of
the first.
After holding Stanford down in the bottom
of the first, Los Angeles didn't make a sound
in the top of the second. By then, it was Stan
ford's turn, and with senior first baseman
Luke Quaccia at first on an error, senior left
fielder Chris Clark swatted a long ball over
the fence in center field to give Stanford the
lead.
Clark "has been really producing for us,"
Marquess said. "He's becoming very valuable
offensively."
However, the Cardinal's 2-1 lead wouldn't

last for long. In the top of the third, with the
bases loaded and one out, the Golden Eagles
were threatening to break the game open.
Harris was able to induce Los Angeles first
baseman Jay Gibbons to ground out to sec
ond, however, bringing in a run but setting up
a two-out situation that could have gotten the
Cardinal out of the inning.
But the next batter, junior Jesse Joyce, had
a different idea. He bounced a grounder swift
ly past the dives of sophomore third baseman
Josh Hochgesang and junior shortstop Jay
Pecci, sending two runners home and running
the score to 4-2 in favor of the Golden Eagles.
Harris was able to get the next batter to lift a
high fly ball to right to get out of the inning.
The Cardinal got one of the runs back in
the bottom of the third on a smack to deep
left by sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut
that was barely caught. But the deep fly
allowed Pecci to streak home, making the
score 4-3.
Two innings later, the Card was able to add
two more on a slew of hits to take a tenuous 5-
4 lead.
