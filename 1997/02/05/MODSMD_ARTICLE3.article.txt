# Theater in the works for shopping center

Stanford public relations offi
cials are polling local residents to
see if there is sufficient support for
its proposal to add a movie theater
to the Stanford Shopping Center.
"In general, the responses have
been very positive," said Larry
Horton, director of Government
and Community Relations. "We
have been asked by many people to
add the theater."
According to Horton, polling
the community is standard prac

"We are simply trying to see how
the local community feels about
this issue."
The new proposition follows in
the wake of the recent announce
ment by Landmark Theater Corp.,
a Los Angeles-based chain which
owns several theaters in the local
area, that it would be closing the
two-screen Palo Alto Square The
atre on Feb. 17 because its lease is
expiring.
"There has been a real decline

in the last few years of film offer
ings in Palo Alto," Horton ex
plained. After the closing of the
Palo Alto Square Theatre, there
will only be two movie theaters left
in Palo Alto â€” the two-screen
Aquarius Cinemas, also owned by
Landmark, and the Stanford The
atre on University Avenue.
Of these two, only Aquarius
Cinemas shows recent theatrical
releases.
Horton said the new theater
would most likely be owned by
Landmark, which shows mainly
"serious and foreign films." The
new theater would resemble the
soon-to-be closed Palo Alto Square
Theatre in terms of the type of
movies offered.
He claimed that these kinds of
films "fit in quite well in the uni
versity theaters" and cited the ex
ample of a recently opened Land
mark theater near MIT which has
been doing very good business.
