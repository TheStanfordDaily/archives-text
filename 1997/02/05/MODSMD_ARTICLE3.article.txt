# Theater in the works for shopping center

Stanford public relations offi
cials are polling local residents to
see if there is sufficient support for
its proposal to add a movie theater
to the Stanford Shopping Center.
"In general, the responses have
been very positive," said Larry
Horton, director of Government
and Community Relations. "We
have been asked by many people to
add the theater."
According to Horton, polling
the community is standard prac
tice in Stanford public relations.
"We are simply trying to see how
the local community feels about
this issue."
The new proposition follows in
the wake of the recent announce
ment by Landmark Theater Corp.,
a Los Angeles-based chain which
owns several theaters in the local
area, that it would be closing the
two-screen Palo Alto Square The
atre on Feb. 17 because its lease is
expiring.
"There has been a real decline

in the last few years of film offer
ings in Palo Alto," Horton ex
plained. After the closing of the
Palo Alto Square Theatre, there
will only be two movie theaters left
in Palo Alto â€” the two-screen
Aquarius Cinemas, also owned by
Landmark, and the Stanford The
atre on University Avenue.
Of these two, only Aquarius
Cinemas shows recent theatrical
releases.
Horton said the new theater
would most likely be owned by
Landmark, which shows mainly
"serious and foreign films." The
new theater would resemble the
soon-to-be closed Palo Alto Square
Theatre in terms of the type of
movies offered.
He claimed that these kinds of
films "fit in quite well in the uni
versity theaters" and cited the ex
ample of a recently opened Land
mark theater near MIT which has
been doing very good business.
When asked when the theater
might go into development, Hor
ton emphasized that the addition is
"only possible if the Sand Hill pro
ject is allowed to proceed according
to plan." Without the additional
space provided by the project, it
would be impossible to construct
the theater.
The Sand Hill project is a con
troversial, $341-million plan to ex
pand the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, construct apartments, build
senior housing and extend Sand
Hill Road to intersect with El
Camino Real, while expanding the
street to four lanes in order to pro
vide for the increased traffic flow.
Some residents of Palo Alto and

Menlo Park have opposed the pro
ject, citing possible environmental
repercussions, as well as the addi
tional traffic, which they believe
will overload the already congested
streets.
However, during a recent town
council meeting held Jan. 27, there
was general support for the Sand
Hill project among the Palo Alto
residents present.
Horton said he believes the pro
posed theater will only heighten
this support for the Sand Hill pro
ject from both local residents and
students because of the general
lack of movie theaters in the area
and the convenient location of the
new theater. He fondly recalled the
days when Palo Alto had several
different theaters and expressed a
strong desire to keep the film com
munity alive in the city.
