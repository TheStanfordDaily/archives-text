Four years ago, Stanford
stood on the brink of gymnastics
greatness with two wins under
its belt and a stellar recruiting
class to help lead the way.
That class consisted of Jamie
Ellis, lan Bachrach and Keith
Wiley.
Ellis was the top recruit in
the nation, a five-year junior
national team member who had
already established himself as
an elite-level gymnast. Wiley
had placed third at junior
nationals, and Bachrach, who
had not intended to continue the
sport in college, quickly estab
lished himself as an All-Ameri
can after his freshman year.
As one of the best recruiting
classes that Stanford men's
gymnastics has ever seen, these
same men now stand as seniors
poised to lead the squad to a
fourth championship of the
19905.
The three gymnasts arrived

at Stanford on the same day,
before the rest of the team and
before the rest of the freshman
class. They were greeted by their
head coach Sadao Hamada and
whisked away to Portola Valley,
where they were thrown into a
new environment with no car
and no one to keep them compa
ny but each other
"That was our initiation as
adults." Ellis said. They trained
for three days in isolation, and
that experience has; stayed with
them throughout their time at
Stanford
That was their "warming up
process," one of many stages in
Hamada's grand plan In time,
the gymnasts have learned the
wisdom m their coach's ways.
Soon the freshmen joined the
ranks of the defending back-to
back national championship
team, including such tout *d
stars as Jair Lynch, Josh St< n,
Mark Booth and Jing-Wei Liang.
That vear the men's gymnas-
tics team placed second in the
NCAA finals. And the Class of '97
had to step up and take the lead.
"About the second year on, they
had to step up and lead the team,"
Hamada said. "Josh Stein was
there, but he could not do it alone."
In 1995 the team stepped up to

take the national title.
"We were in second place after
the first day of competition. I was
really nervous, but after the first
event, we had a fall, and after that
it was amazing. People hit the best
routines of their life," Wiley said.
"As of yet, the most exciting and
rewarding accomplishment was
winning our national title our
sophomore year."
Last year the Cardinal placed
third, but five team members made

the All-America team, including
each of this year's seniors.
Wiley took second in the all
around at NCAAs, while Bachrach
placed second on the high bar, sec
ond on the vault and first on the
floor exercise. Additionally, Ellis
won the parallel bar event in the
event finals.
"They are definitely one of the
strongest classes in terms of the
quality of numbers," Hamada said.
"They have done a great job in con

tributing to the success of the
NCAA championships. The seniors
account for two-thirds of the total
scoring for the team. Both Wiley
and Ellis compete in all six events
and Bachrach in four.
"All three of them are physically
talented — from Bachrach, Wiley
and Ellis I can count on 16 routines
out of these guys and 24 routines
count. As long as I can keep those
three guys healthy, I feel very con
fident about this squad."

In addition to their physical con
tribution. the seniors are instru
mental in fostering camaraderie
and leading the team to another
national title.
"The chemistry within the team
is the best I have ever felt,"
Bachrach said.
"They are taking very good lead
ership of the team; their skill level
is so incredibly high," Hamada
said. Throughout the last three
years, the gymnasts have managed
to weather the storm with few
injuries.
Ellis has undergone shoulder
surgery twice but has not missed
any significant team competition
thereof. Ellis is currently recover
ing from surgery but continues to
compete for the team.
"I just want to go out giving 100
percent and make these last four
months the best — the opportunity
is there to succeed," Ellis said.
The chances for success will
increase as the gymnasts become
more adapted to the new scoring
rules.
"I think this year is a little bit
unique because people are still
adjusting to the new rules,"
Bachrach said.
Nonetheless, the team never
loses sight of its ultimate goal, win
ning the national championship.
"It's obvious that our goal is to
win the national title and maxi
mize our team effort in a healthy
way," Bachrach said.
And the Cardinal seems poised
to do so under the leadership of its
three All-American seniors.
