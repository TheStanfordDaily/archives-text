# NBA should require Rodman to seek help
## 
### 
Dennis Rodman will return
â€” that is the word from
NBA commissioner David
Stern, who reinstated Rodman
yesterday. The strange but talent
ed Chicago Bulls forward will be
available to play against the Char
lotte Hornets on the Tuesday fol
lowing the All-Star break.
I hope that Rodman chooses to
take the time to perform some self
evaluation because the league cer
tainly is not going to force him to.
Stern announced that he will
not require Rodman to undergo
therapy, something that was ini
tially stipulated in his suspension
for kicking a cameraman.
Rodman earned an 11-game
suspension from the league on
Jan. 15 for kicking cameraman
Eugene Amos. Amos was hospital
ized and eventually settled out of
court with Rodman.
Stern commented that "the
league needs Dennis, appreciates
Dennis.''
I am not sure what "needs"
Stern was referring to, but judg
ing from reactions stemming
from Rodman's seemingly ran
dom act of violence, most people
don't think Rodman's behavior

is one of those needs.
Stern refused to make Rodmar
undergo counseling because some
complained that it attacked hit
dignity. Well, what about the diK

nity of Amos and Ted Bernhardt, a
referee whom Rodman headbutted
last season 9 Doesn't Stern care
about the dignity of the league's
other referees, whom Dennis
trashed in front of the media dur
ing a profanity filled tirade Dec. 8?
As if Rodman cares about his
dignity anyway. Making your head
look like a snow cone and tattooing
and piercing every conceivable part
of your body does not exactly reek
of dignity.
Stern says that the NBA needs


Ben
Hur
the Dennis Rodman we know
today, but I guess therein lies the
tragedy. I grew up in Detroit, and I
grew up loving both the Pistons
and Rodman. Back then, Rodman
provided a spark off the bench,
playing with an intensity and a fer
vor that was incredibly refreshing.
Dennis didn't score very much
in those days (some things never
change), so on those occasions
when he did make a basket, he
pumped his fists wildly into the air
as he ran back down the court.
Everybody in the crowd pumped
their fists with him. Dennis
worked harder than anyone on the

court, playing great defense and
grabbing countless rebounds, so
when he was able to put one in for
two points, we all cheered him on.
But although Dennis was loved in
Motown, he received few advertise
ments and little national exposure.
Now, Dennis is a nationwide
cult hero of sorts. He was one of
the nation's leading entertainers
in 1996 and even came out with an
autobiography. He also has picked
up a disdain for league rules and a
disrespect for just about everybody
he runs into.
By succumbing to Rodman's
wish to avoid therapy and thereby
ignoring what had been a prerequi
site for Rodman's return, Stern
made it quite obvious that Dennis'
"dignity" is more important than
the dignity of people whom he has

attacked and to those whom he will
attack in the future.
Forcing Dennis to see a thera
pist is something the league must
do in order to protect its other
employees. Believing that Rodman
will suddenly change his ways
after this incident is simply wish
ful thinking. I am sure that Stern
and the league office assumed the
worst of Rodman's antics was past
them after he received a six-game
suspension for head-butting Bern
hardt. They were wrong.
If the league needs and appreci
ates Dennis so much, they should
make every effort to keep this rag
ing Bull under control. Therapy
will not guarantee that Dennis will
change his ways, but Rodman's
own promises to change haven't
exactly worked either.
