# NBA should require Rodman to seek help
## 
### 
Dennis Rodman will return
â€” that is the word from
NBA commissioner David
Stern, who reinstated Rodman
yesterday. The strange but talent
ed Chicago Bulls forward will be
available to play against the Char
lotte Hornets on the Tuesday fol
lowing the All-Star break.
I hope that Rodman chooses to
take the time to perform some self
evaluation because the league cer
tainly is not going to force him to.
Stern announced that he will
not require Rodman to undergo
therapy, something that was ini
tially stipulated in his suspension
for kicking a cameraman.
Rodman earned an 11-game
suspension from the league on
Jan. 15 for kicking cameraman
Eugene Amos. Amos was hospital
ized and eventually settled out of
court with Rodman.
Stern commented that "the
league needs Dennis, appreciates
Dennis.''
I am not sure what "needs"
Stern was referring to, but judg
ing from reactions stemming
from Rodman's seemingly ran
dom act of violence, most people
don't think Rodman's behavior

is one of those needs.
Stern refused to make Rodmar
undergo counseling because some
complained that it attacked hit
dignity. Well, what about the diK

nity of Amos and Ted Bernhardt, a
referee whom Rodman headbutted
last season 9 Doesn't Stern care
about the dignity of the league's
other referees, whom Dennis
trashed in front of the media dur
ing a profanity filled tirade Dec. 8?
As if Rodman cares about his
dignity anyway. Making your head
look like a snow cone and tattooing
and piercing every conceivable part
of your body does not exactly reek
of dignity.
Stern says that the NBA needs
