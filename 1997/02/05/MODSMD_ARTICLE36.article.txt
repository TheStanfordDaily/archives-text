Students are celebrating Black Liberation Month
through a variety of events during February, each
highlighting the theme, "A Celebration of Our Living
Heritage."
"This is a celebration, and people can learn some
thing from it," said sophomore Marc Mitchell, one of
the Black Liberation Month student coordinators. "If
they want to experience it, the events are there for
them."
The month is meant to provide a forum for ac
knowledging past contributions of African Americans,
as well as showcasing recent developments in culture
and academics, Mitchell said.
The planning committee stressed that "African
Americans have shined as powerful contributors to
their communities and dedicated leaders championing
the needs and issues of the community" on the nation
al, state, local and neighborhood levels.
"It is time that we as African-American people not
only acknowledge this but also begin to celebrate it,"
Mitchell said.
"This month, there are events virtually every day,"
he said. "The talent showcased covers the whole spec
trum."

He added the recognition of the importance of the
African American living heritage is a means of honor
ing academic, political, spiritual and community excel
lence.
Black Liberation Month at Stanford was founded in
1972 by a group of Roble students. At the time, it was
connected to Negro History Week, which was founded
by African-American historian Carter Woodson in
1926. The purpose of these events was to emphasize
community building and to provide information about
the history and heritage of African Americans.
Other events on the calendar for the liberation
month include the "Diaspora Get Down" on Friday, as
well as a Coffee House Poetry Night and a Gospel Ex
travaganza next week. The Avoda Dance Ensemble
will perform "Let My People Go" on Feb. 26, a retelling
of the Exodus story from a Jewish and African-Ameri
can perspective.
Mitchell said the committee has "worked diligently
to provide a wealth of cultural experiences and intel
lectual programs for the entire Stanford community."
He said he was particularly excited about the "Dias
pora Get Down."
"There will be different samples of traditional cui
sine and performances by a variety of acts on campus,
including the gospel choir, Jam Pac'd, Bhangra, Ku
umba and poetry readings," Mitchell said.
