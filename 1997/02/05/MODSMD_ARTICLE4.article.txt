# ASSU judicial council nominee is confirmed
## Second candidate withdraws name from consideration 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The first of ASSU President Bill Shen's constitu
tional council nominees was confirmed last night, only
minutes after another nominee withdrew himself from
consideration.
Shortly after Shen announced that junior Ben Deck
er had pulled his name out of consideration for a seat on
the council, the senate unanimously confirmed sopho
more Katherine Wray as the first member of the body
charged with overseeing the constitutionality of senate
actions.
Wray said she is excited to begin work on the council
but added that she hopes she will see few potential con
stitutional violations come out of the senate.
"I hope that I won't have much of a job," she said,
"but if I do, I hope to do it as fairly and justly as possi
ble."
Decker cited timing reasons for his withdrawal from
senate consideration. "When I applied for a position on
the council, I thought the entire selection and confir
mation process would move a lot quicker," he said.
Decker said he is interested in being a "student ad
vocate" at the present time, rather than an impartial
member of the council. He refused to confirm specula
tion that he is preparing to run for ASSU president in
the spring but did hint at future plans.
"There are things in the future that I thought would
not be compatible with the council,"he said.
The remainder of the meeting was divided on a wide
range of topics.
Senator Bruce Gibney opened the meeting with a se

ries of remarks concerning the relationship between
Stanford and the Reserve Officer Training Corps.
The meeting ended with the senate passing a resolu
tion in support of Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta's appeal of the decision by the deans in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
to deny him tenure.
Much of the evening was spent
debating a line item in the proposed
winter quarter budget of the Com
munity Service Board. In the final
draft of the budget, brought before
the senate last night, the Appropri
ations Committee recommended to
deny a funding request by the
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity for its
Casino Night, held last Saturday.

In its report on the budget, the
committee recommended that no
funds be granted for Casino Night
in accordance with the Community
Service Board's policy, which pro
hibits giving money to fund-raising
events.
ASSU Senator Henry Wu, who
also served as chair of Casino Night,
proposed an amendment to the bud
get to grant the fraternity $893, the
amount recommended to the Ap
propriations Committee by the
Community Service Board. He al
leged the fraternity was not told of
the "no fund-raiser" policy until
late in the application process, when

the funds for Casino Night had al
ready been spent.
The issue led to a lengthy debate
on the senate floor. Shen sided with
Wu and the Sig Eps. "I'm just em
barrassed that once again our
process screwed up," he said.
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock
disagreed. "The [Community Ser
vice] Board did not make a mis
take," she said.
The amendment failed, but the
line item quarrel did not end there.
Over the next hour, several motions
were made in regards to the spend
ing measure. The bill was first di
vided into two parts, one which in

cluded only the Sig Eps item and an
other that included the rest of the
budget.
The main bill passed, but the
senate ran in circles over the second
measure. After attempts to table
and amend the bill — including a
proposal by senator Harris Shapiro
to grant $887, the original Sig Eps
request minus a $6 request for en
velopes — came up short, the senate
failed to come to a final decision on
what to do with the bill.
The senate finally postponed the
issue after a vote to approve the orig
inal line item, which would grant no
funds to the Sig Eps, failed as well.
