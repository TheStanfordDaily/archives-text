A new agreement between the University and
military officials may pave the way for a ROTC de
tachment from Santa Clara University to use
Stanford facilities, although the University would
not be gaining its own ROTC unit, according to
University Registrar Roger Printup.
Under the new agreement, which is pending ap
proval by Army officials, ROTC instructors from
Santa Clara would have the opportunity to utilize
Stanford facilities, provided they are available.
"If there is sufficient interest on the part of
Stanford students," Santa Clara ROTC courses
could be taught at Stanford, Printup said.
