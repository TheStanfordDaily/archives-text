# Agreement may allow ROTC use of University facilities

### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
A new agreement between the University and
military officials may pave the way for a ROTC de
tachment from Santa Clara University to use
Stanford facilities, although the University would
not be gaining its own ROTC unit, according to
University Registrar Roger Printup.
Under the new agreement, which is pending ap
proval by Army officials, ROTC instructors from
Santa Clara would have the opportunity to utilize
Stanford facilities, provided they are available.
"If there is sufficient interest on the part of
Stanford students," Santa Clara ROTC courses
could be taught at Stanford, Printup said.
He stressed the agreement does
not create a ROTC unit at Stan
ford, nor does it give ROTC in
structors University faculty sta
tus. In addition, ROTC courses
would continued to be offered only
through Santa Clara. He said it is
uncertain at this time whether or
not Santa Clara credit could be
transferred to Stanford.
ROTC courses are also offered

at UC-Berkeley (Navy / Marine)
and San Jose State University (Air
Force).
Printup's comments came in
light of statements made by ASSU
Senator Bruce Gibney at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting in
explanation of his withdrawal of a
bill from senate consideration that
would have urged the University
to end its objection to ROTC.
Printup said earlier this week
that if ROTC wanted to return to
campus, the military "would have
asked, and they haven't asked."
Gibney called that statement

"either an inconsistency, an omis
sion or a lie."
That statement, coupled with
an article in yesterday's Stanford
Review that ran under the head
line "Deal in works for ROTC re
turn," drew Printup's ire. The ar
ticle reported that the Army and
the University were close to an
agreement that would have cross
enrollment ROTC classes taught
at Stanford as soon as spring quar
ter.
Cross-enrollment allows stu
dents to take ROTC courses at a dif
ferent university than the one in

which they are currently registered.
Printup refuted what he saw as
an implication that Stanford will
be establishing its own ROTC
unit. He noted the difference be
tween the University hosting an
adjoining program and creating its
own.
"Moving ROTC back on campus
means providing space [for ROTC
functions], making those courses
part of the curriculum, acknowl
edging that the leaders of that pro
gram are part of the faculty," and
that is not in the new agreement,
he said.
