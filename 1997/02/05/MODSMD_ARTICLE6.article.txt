Speaking to a captive audience last night in
Memorial Auditorium, award-winning author and
poet Maya Angelou said, "it was a great delight to be

themselves as rainbows in the clouds."
A feature of Black Liberation Month — a tradi

"Young men and women, you're in an institution
so famous, so highly regarded for its resources, for
its output. Use it to find African-American poetry,"
she said.

poems, she said, "people without romance risk being

colors as caramel and chocolate, Angelou reminded
the audience that African-American poetry high
lights black beauty.
"African-American poetry has been there and
will be there, thanks to the young people writing it
today," Angelou said. "Poetry is supposed to make
