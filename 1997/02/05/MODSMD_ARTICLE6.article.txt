# Angelou speaks of 'beauty's rainbows'
## Author recites poetry, song in speech to sold-out crowd 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Speaking to a captive audience last night in
Memorial Auditorium, award-winning author and
poet Maya Angelou said, "it was a great delight to be
.. . speaking to young men and women who see
themselves as rainbows in the clouds."
A feature of Black Liberation Month — a tradi
tion founded by a group of Roble students in the
early 1970s — Angelou's speech marks the 25th an
niversary of the month-long celebration.
Angelou said she was glad to be able to celebrate
Black Liberation Month. Despite the growing recog
nition the celebration receives, however, Angelou
said she is also looking forward to a future "when we
don't have this celebration at all."
Angelou addressed the audience first with a song,
and she continued to alternate between poetry and
speech throughout the remainder of the evening,
citing some of her favorite writers and acting out
some of the poems she recited.
Reminding the audience that "we have always
had rainbows in the clouds," Angelou encouraged
students to go to the library to read African-Ameri
can poetry.
"Young men and women, you're in an institution
so famous, so highly regarded for its resources, for
its output. Use it to find African-American poetry,"
she said.
Angelou emphasized that romantic poetry moti
vates people to stay alive. Citing lines from different
poems, she said, "people without romance risk being
crass, brass, superficial and indeed cruel."
Referring to "beauty's rainbow" as a mix of such
colors as caramel and chocolate, Angelou reminded
the audience that African-American poetry high
lights black beauty.
"African-American poetry has been there and
will be there, thanks to the young people writing it
today," Angelou said. "Poetry is supposed to make
you see how lovable you are; it is supposed to make

you laugh."
In addition to encouraging stu
dents to read African-American
poetry, Angelou urged the audi
ence to have courage.
"Courage is the most important
virtue of all because you can't have
any other virtue without it," An
gelou said. "Courage is like a mus
cle. You develop it little by little. I
don't think you're born with it,
just like you're not born knowing
how to throw a football."
Angelou reminded the audience
that "we all have been paid for" by
our ancestors who courageously
sacrificed something when they
came to this country.
"Our ancestors have paid for
us. It is wise and imperative that
we remember that," she said. "You
have something important to do.
Have enough courage to find out
who you are and who you have to
pay for."
One can demonstrate courage,
Angelou said, by not allowing
racial pejoratives to be spoken.
She said nobody should use the
word "nigger" because it was orig
inally used like "poison." Even
though people now use it lightly,
Angelou warned against over
looking the connotations of the
word.

"Pouring poison into Bavarian
crystal doesn't make it not poi
son," she commented.
Angelou ended her speech by
reminding the audience that
people are fundamentally the
same.
"We all want a good job; we all
want to get paid more than we're
worth; we all want safe streets; we
all want to be loved; we all want a
good place to party on Saturday
night," Angelou said. "There's re
ally no mystique."
She encouraged listeners to
enjoy Black Liberation Month and
work until the time when "our
country won't need to have it —
when black history will be a part of
American history.
"In dying, we should each be
able to say, 'In my conscious life, I
have tried to defend the right of
human beings, starting with my
self,' " Angelou said.
Sophomore Emily Johnson said
she was impressed by Angelou's
delivery. "It was amazing. I was re
ally touched by her warmth and
humor. I thought she had a lot of
meaningful things to say which
she made accessible to the audi
ence," she said.
Angelou has received nomina
tions for the National Book
Award, the Pulitzer Prize for poet
ry and the Tony Award. The talk
was sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. She holds more
than 30 honorary degrees.
