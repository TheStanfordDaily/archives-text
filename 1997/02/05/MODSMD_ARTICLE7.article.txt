# Overseas scholars relate experience abroad

Students who have just returned from a
quarter overseas are happy to settle on the Farm
again. Although most enjoyed their experiences
abroad, many are eager to reunite with friends
and dive back into extracurricular activities.
"I have so much more energy about Stanford
now. [Being overseasl has given me a different
perspective, and I appreciate [Stanford] more,"
said junior Kristine Surla, who was in the Paris
program.
Still, some students miss the cobblestone
streets that are hundreds of years older than
those that line the Quad.
Said junior Andy Pelletier, who spent last

quarter in Florence: "I miss being a Florentine,
walking past so many incredible sights on the
way to class in a 2,000-year old city."
"After one quarter in Florence, I don't feel
like I've had the complete Italian experience,"
he said. Pelletier, who is studying economics
and computer science, said he hopes to work in
Milan this summer with an American invest
ment bank or consulting firm.
"It's good to be back though. I get to see all
my pals," Pelletier said. "But the work is no
ticeably more intense" than it was in Flo
rence.
While not terribly demanding, the academics
in Italy serve their purpose, Pelletier said. "You
can take advantage of the location and language
but you still have a lot of time to explore Italy

and soak up the Italian culture, including a bot
tle or two of vino rosso " Pelletier said.
Many students agree that the lack of a drink
ing age and the convenience of train travel adds
to the recreational possibilities overseas.
"Most people here spend the weekends on
campus, whereas in Europe, every weekend
you're in a different country," Surla said.
"Here, people get lazy about going into San
Francisco."
While many Europeans and Stanford stu
dents alike party well into the morning, the
metro system in Paris stops running at mid
night. Disco-hopping students were forced to
choose between taking an expensive taxi ride
