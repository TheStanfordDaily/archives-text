# Overseas scholars relate experience abroad
## 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
Students who have just returned from a
quarter overseas are happy to settle on the Farm
again. Although most enjoyed their experiences
abroad, many are eager to reunite with friends
and dive back into extracurricular activities.
"I have so much more energy about Stanford
now. [Being overseasl has given me a different
perspective, and I appreciate [Stanford] more,"
said junior Kristine Surla, who was in the Paris
program.
Still, some students miss the cobblestone
streets that are hundreds of years older than
those that line the Quad.
Said junior Andy Pelletier, who spent last

quarter in Florence: "I miss being a Florentine,
walking past so many incredible sights on the
way to class in a 2,000-year old city."
"After one quarter in Florence, I don't feel
like I've had the complete Italian experience,"
he said. Pelletier, who is studying economics
and computer science, said he hopes to work in
Milan this summer with an American invest
ment bank or consulting firm.
"It's good to be back though. I get to see all
my pals," Pelletier said. "But the work is no
ticeably more intense" than it was in Flo
rence.
While not terribly demanding, the academics
in Italy serve their purpose, Pelletier said. "You
can take advantage of the location and language
but you still have a lot of time to explore Italy

and soak up the Italian culture, including a bot
tle or two of vino rosso " Pelletier said.
Many students agree that the lack of a drink
ing age and the convenience of train travel adds
to the recreational possibilities overseas.
"Most people here spend the weekends on
campus, whereas in Europe, every weekend
you're in a different country," Surla said.
"Here, people get lazy about going into San
Francisco."
While many Europeans and Stanford stu
dents alike party well into the morning, the
metro system in Paris stops running at mid
night. Disco-hopping students were forced to
choose between taking an expensive taxi ride
home or staying out all night until
the first metro starts running
again at 5 a. m., Surla said.
"I didn't live in postcard Paris,"
said Surla, who tried not to walk
back home alone late at night.
Surla said she was glad to live in
the real Paris, where tourists were
not to be seen.
Using those surroundings,
Surla, an American studies major,
examined the built environment
and building structures in connec
tion with the social reality of her
neighborhood.
In addition to research, Surla
also volunteered with underprivi
leged youth and taught English in
the outskirts of Paris.
Junior Lindsay Picard also par
ticipated in public service an in
ternship program sponsored by
Boston University. She chose to go
to Paris through another universi
ty because the Stanford program
did not cater to her interest in be
coming a doctor.
Picard said working at a chil
dren's hospital for two months
provided good interaction with
French people. Through this expe
rience, she acquired a local per
spective of French culture.
While most students enjoy
learning about different cultures,
not all memories are picture per
fect .
Junior Johnny Reding's re
counted a tragic case of culture
clash when his French family en
trusted their family cat, Rocky, in
his care for the weekend. Reding
was studying on the terrace one
afternoon when he heard Rocky
scratching at the sliding doors.
"Rocky was peering through
the glass at me, saying 'Let me out.
Let me out.' So I let Rocky out,
thinking it was OK," said Reding.
The next thing he heard, Red
ing said, was the sound of finger
nails scratching a chalkboard. He
turned to see Rocky sliding down
the slanted slate roof, plummeting
seven floors.
"Since I didn't know the cus
toms of the country [when some
thing died], I kept the body on the
terrace with ice for a night," Red
ing said. Even worse, Reding said
he had not yet mastered the subtle
voice inflections when speaking
French to connote his sorrow to
his family. When the family re
turned, Reding said they cried for
hours.
"I guess I broke the foreign ex
change student rule No. 1: Don't
kill beloved family pet," Reding
said. "At least I didn't burn down

the apartment."
Unlike Reding, students at Ox
ford do not have to leap the lan
guage barrier. Even so, at Oxford
was overwhelming, according to
junior Kim Axelrod. The work was
intense, and the quarter was short,
she said.
Axelrod said the Oxford campus
is more academically focused than
most other overseas campuses.
She noted that not having to learn
a foreign language facilitated acad
emic research. Indeed, many stu
dents used their time overseas to
start their research for an honors
thesis.
Axelrod, an English major, lived
with 53 other students in the Stan
ford house. She said living in the
Stanford house was very similar to
a dorm, complete with Residential
Education-type programming.
At 4 p.m. every day, students
would go downstairs for tea, cour
tesy of the house mother. As the
president of the Stanford house,
Axelrod ran regular house meet
ings and organized a Halloween
progressive.
"The house was convenient be
cause you never had to leave it, but
we sometimes felt like caged ani
mals," said Axelrod, who now lives
off-campus.
By the end of the quarter, "I
was anxious to get back to my ac
tivities and my friends and to
have my privacy again," said Axel
rod, who is now the publisher of
Haver, a new magazine devoted to
bringing Jewish issues to the
campus.
One of the highlights of study
ing in Oxford, Axelrod said, was
the tutorial offered to every stu
dent. Axelrod took a tutorial in cre
ative writing and wrote seven
short stories in seven weeks. The
fiction writing class at Stanford re
quires two stories for the whole
quarter.
"Having one-on-one education
al experience is so different from
taking a class here," Axelrod said.
Axelrod said that Stanford stu
dents in Palo Alto spend a lot more
time in class and sections, while in
Oxford, students spent most of
their time involved in individual
reading and writing outside of
class time. Axelrod took 16 units
last quarter, spending only five
hours in classes that met once a
week.
While she did travel almost
every weekend, Axelrod said there
is a trade-off between full immer
sion into English university life
and traveling.
"You have to decide if your pur
pose is to experience England's
general country culture versus the
university culture," she said. "It
was very easy to meet acquain

tances but to make real English
friends, you had to commit your
self to being in town."
In comparison, students in the
Moscow program had fewer travel
opportunities because of the dis
tance between cities, said junior
Eric Jackson. Most of the 13 stu
dents on the program had little
Russian language background, but
took a three-week intensive lan
guage course at the beginning of
their stay in Moscow, he said.
"The living conditions in
Moscow were hard," Jackson said.
"Starting in October, Moscow is a
pretty dark city with all the cloud
cover. No wonder there's so much
vodka consumption."
Despite the numbing effects of
vodka and the nine McDonald's in
Moscow, the food was far from ap
petizing, Jackson said. "It almost
made you crave dining service.
And I was never able to find tortilla
chips."
Ironically, "there was a lot of
variety [in retail]," Jackson said,
"much more than I had expected.
The goods are definitely there for
purchase, but I don't know how
many Russians can actually afford
it."
What Russians can afford —
and value most — are private rela
tionships.
"In public, Muscovites walk
around sullen and forlorn," Jack
son said. "But if a Russian invites
you to their house, you will have a
good time. They'll roll out the best
bread they possibly can and the
vodka will never stop flowing,
even in the worst of economic
times."
"It's just great coming back to
Stanford and seeing how friendly
people are — always laughing,
hugging people, just enjoying
themselves in public. It's nice,"
Jackson noted. "There's definitely
much more love of life expressed in
public by people here at Stanford."
Many students agreed that
studying overseas allowed them to
take a re-energizing break from
Stanford.
"I'm trying to ease back into
Stanford life without going crazy
in the transition," said Surla, who
will be leaving for Washington in
the spring. "I want to catch up
with people, get work done and fig
ure out my life."
Pelletier encouraged all stu
dents to submit applications for an
overseas program next year.
"Everyone should study over
seas because it gives you a perspec
tive you couldn't otherwise get on
your own country and culture,"
Pelletier said. "Seeing America
through different eyes gives you a
complete understanding of our
selves."
