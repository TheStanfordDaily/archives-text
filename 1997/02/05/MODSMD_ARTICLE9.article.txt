# Haas, CPPC to host public service fair
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
There is hope yet for students discouraged by
the constant corporate advertisements and re
sume-pushing career fairs in White Plaza.
The Public Service Career and Internship
Fair tomorrow will give students an opportunity
to talk with representatives from 70 community
and government organizations about their expe
riences outside of the corporate world.
The fair will give students "more of a sense of
possibility that they can do whatever they want,"
said Anne Greenblatt, career counselor in public
service at the Career Planning and Placement
Center. "You can find summer internships, re
search and work after graduation in the commu
nity and public policy end of service and get paid
for it."
Unlike the fall career fair, the range of orga
nizations will appeal to more student interests.
Organizations include the CIA, Teach for Amer
ica, the Alzheimer's Association, the Asian Law
Alliance and the U.S. Peace Corps.
"Many students don't realize that they can
make a living in the public and community ser
vice sector," said senior Daniela Kim, a Haas
Center peer adviser who is working with the

CPPC to organize the fair.
Stanford alumnus Donnovan Somera, who
has traveled that uncharted territory beyond the
corporate world and succeeded, said he urges
students to follow their passion.
Somera has had a string of 10 or 15 jobs —
ranging from running his own business to being
a disc jockey — before landing the one he loves
now.
"You get a sense of loss if you don't find a job
right after graduation," the 1990 graduate said.
"But it can actually be a great opportunity to ex
plore internships and jobs outside the corporate
world."
Somera warned against pursuing certain ca
reers because they were simply "the next logical
step." While Somera now loves to get up in the
morning to act as director of the Aids Prevention
Program at the Mid-Peninsula YWCA, he admit
ted there was pressure for him to follow the
crowd climbing the corporate or professional lad
der.
"If you're in the corporate world or medicine
is what you love, then go for it," Somera said. For
those who are not sure, he warned that "onceyou
are doing residency at a hospital or working long
hours at a corporate firm, it's very hard to
change careers.

"The prestige only goes so far, so you need to
know why you are doing it,"he added.
Working for a nonprofit organization entails
using a variety of skills, Somera added. "A lot of
private jobs are so specific that they begin to lose
meaning because you stop using your brain," he
said, "whereas in many public service careers
you do everything from writing grants to sched
uling to performing your actual job."
Although Greenblatt admitted the salaries in
the public sector are about three-quarters of
what they are in the private sector, Kim encour
ages students to think about the benefits. "By
doing something for the community, you often
receive more than you can give," she said.
Kim welcomes students to drop by the public
service fair from noon to 4 p.m. at Tresidder
Union even if they do not think they have an in
terest.
"Whether it becomes your main line of work
or just a hobby, everyone should at least think
about community or public service sometime in
their lives," she said.
Organizations at the fair will be grouped in
the following areas: arts, media and museums;
government; international; education; health;
social and political action; environment; and
human services.
