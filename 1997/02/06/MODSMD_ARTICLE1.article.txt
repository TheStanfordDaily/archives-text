# Econ prof urges CPI restructure

A miscalculation of 1 percent may
not seem like much, but when it
comes to government spending and
taxes, 1 percent can add up to billions
of dollars.
Such is the case with the Con
sumer Price Index, the government
statistic which takes a selected group
of goods and services and calculates
their yearly price rise.
Last December, after almost two

years of research, the Consumer Price Index Commis
sion, chaired by Stanford Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin, delivered its findings to Congress. They could
1 lave a dramatic effect on t he govern ment spending, the
national debt and the economy overall.
According to Boskin and his colleagues on the com
mission, who include the Economics Department
chairs from Harvard and Northwestern universities,
"theCPI now overstates the true rate of inflation by 1.1
percent."
In addition, they recommended solutions and for
mulas on how to improve the accuracy of the index. In
flation was calculated by the CPI to be at 3.3 percent for
1996.
Boskin saw two major faults in how the index was
calculated. One was that it did not take people's buying
habits properly into account.
Specifically, the current method did not take into ac
cou nt consu mors' tendency to substitute as some goods
become costlier, Boskin said.
"People buy hamburger if chicken is too expensive,
or golden apples if red delicious ones are too expensive,"
said Boskin. "Also people will wait for sales or go to dis
count outlets to get lower prices. These savings are not
reflected in the index," he added.
Additionally, Boskin said, the index does not dis
criminate between those price changes due to inflation
and those due to technological improvements.
"Cellular phones won't be incorporated into the CPI
until 1998. The cost savings of such innovations like
