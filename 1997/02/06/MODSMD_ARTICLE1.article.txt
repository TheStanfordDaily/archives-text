# Econ prof urges CPI restructure

### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
A miscalculation of 1 percent may
not seem like much, but when it
comes to government spending and
taxes, 1 percent can add up to billions
of dollars.
Such is the case with the Con
sumer Price Index, the government
statistic which takes a selected group
of goods and services and calculates
their yearly price rise.
Last December, after almost two

years of research, the Consumer Price Index Commis
sion, chaired by Stanford Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin, delivered its findings to Congress. They could
1 lave a dramatic effect on t he govern ment spending, the
national debt and the economy overall.
According to Boskin and his colleagues on the com
mission, who include the Economics Department
chairs from Harvard and Northwestern universities,
"theCPI now overstates the true rate of inflation by 1.1
percent."
In addition, they recommended solutions and for
mulas on how to improve the accuracy of the index. In
flation was calculated by the CPI to be at 3.3 percent for
1996.
Boskin saw two major faults in how the index was
calculated. One was that it did not take people's buying
habits properly into account.
Specifically, the current method did not take into ac
cou nt consu mors' tendency to substitute as some goods
become costlier, Boskin said.
"People buy hamburger if chicken is too expensive,
or golden apples if red delicious ones are too expensive,"
said Boskin. "Also people will wait for sales or go to dis
count outlets to get lower prices. These savings are not
reflected in the index," he added.
Additionally, Boskin said, the index does not dis
criminate between those price changes due to inflation
and those due to technological improvements.
"Cellular phones won't be incorporated into the CPI
until 1998. The cost savings of such innovations like


Boskin
those phones bring to the economy
in terms of keeping inflation down
are not fully reflected, and there is
considerable lag in the index," said
Boskin.
But this is one mistake many peo
ple will not want to see corrected. As
it turns out, the CPI, which takes a
sample of regularly used goods and
services and calculates their yearly
price rise, is used to base cost-of-liv
ing adjustments for federal entitle
ment programs such as Social Secu
rity, Medicare and Medicaid.
With real inflation, calculated by
Boskin to be around 1.7 percent

rather than the current 3.2 percent,
running well below the current ad
justments, recipients of these pro
grams would receive slightly less
money in benefits over time so long
as inflation stays at low levels.
The index is also used to adjust
federal income tax rates, so any re
alignment in the index which shows
a slower rate of inflation would trig
ger a rise in taxes.
Since Boskin delivered his find
ings to Congress, they have gener
ated a political furor over the impli
cations they could have on the
economy.
"Right now I and the other mem
bers of the commission are busy dis
seminating and educating members
of Congress and policy makers,"
Boskins said. "But I expect a lot of

demagoguery as both parties jockey
for position and try to get each other
to take the first step."
"My best guess is that some ad
justment is going to happen at the
end of the fiscal year," he added.
The readjustment would poten
tially not only increase taxes and
lower benefits but could lower bud
get deficits substantially over the
next 10 years.
According to the commission's
findings, overall deficit reduction
achieved by changing the methods
and weights in the index could
amount to as much as $202.4 billion
dollars and an overall debt savings of
more than $1 trillion by 2008 if the
recommendations are put into place.
In the past month, Federal Re
serve Chairman Alan Greenspan
agreed with the findings, going fur
ther by suggesting an independent
commission set the CPI rather
than an agency or Congress. Cur
rently, the Bureau of Labor Statis
tics calculates the CPI on a month
ly basis.
At Stanford professors familiar
with the issued concurred with
Boskin's fmdings.
"The purpose of the adjustment
is not to cut entitlements but to
keep them where they are in real
terms," said Economics Depart
ment Chair David Starrett. "The
CPI overstates the impact of infla
tion and the purchasing power of
entitlements goes up automatically
every year."
Asst. Economics Prof. Thomas
Nechyba, an expert on public fi
nance, agreed.
"I think the findings of the com
mission are quite sound, and his es
timates on the magnitude [of the
error in the CPI) are relatively con
servative," he said.
However, interest groups and
lobbyists, as well as politicians
mindful of their constituencies, will
try to shape any chances in their
favor, Starrett noted.
"Entitlements are a political hot
potato no one wants to touch. ... I
doubt much of substance will hap
pen until we get closer to the real
budget crunch as the demographics
of the baby boom [start to strain the
entitlements system] and as a soci
ety we will not be able to afford to
pay for all these entitlements out of
public money," he said.
"At some point the CPI will be
changed," said Political Science
Prof. David Brady. "Since it does in
flate the real costs, it would be nice
to see Congress adjust the index by
itself."
