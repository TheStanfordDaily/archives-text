Financial giants to merge
NEW YORK (APj — Morgan Stanley, the
button-down investment bank that traces its
roots to financier J.P. Morgan, announced yes
terday that it is merging with onetime Sears
subsidiary Dean Witter in a $l f >-billion deal that
would create the world's biggest securities firm.
The odd-couple pairing between an old
money firm that caters to corporations and
wealthy investors and another that peddles its
investments through retail outlets underscores
the new attraction of individual investors.
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. is a powerhouse
in mergers and in underwriting securities. Dean
Witter Discover & Co. is strong in the retail bro
kerage business, selling stocks, bonds and such
to the public.
The stock-swap merger would create the
world's biggest securities firm by surpassing
Merrill Lynch, which built itself into a leader in
underwriting as well as retail brokerages.
Wall Street appeared enamored with the
deal. Morgan Stanley shares shot up more than
13 percent yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, where Dean Witter rose more than 5
percent.
Banks to pay Holocaust victims
GENEVA (AP) — Hoping to quell growing
international criticism over alleged collusion
with the Nazis in World War 11, Switzerland's
"Big Three" banking giants announced yester
day they will create a $71-million fund for Holo
caust victims and their families.
Eighteen months of controversy have threat
ened to tarnish the image of Swiss banks and
has put them at risk of international boycotts.
Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and
the Union Bank of Switzerland said the fund
was meant as a humanitarian gesture. They
encouraged the government, central bank and
others to contribute additional money and help
decide how the fund will operate.
The fund will be opened later this month at
the Swiss National Bank, said Union Bank of
Switzerland spokeswoman Gertrud Erismann.
The banks' action was greeted favorably by
Jewish groups around the world, which have
claimed that as much as $7 billion from Jewish
depositors remains in World War 11-era bank
accounts.
'College Terrace Rapist' freed
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Serial rapist Melvin
Carter was released from custody at San Fran
cisco airport yesterday, and he immediately left
California for an unknown destination, prison
officials said.
"He boarded a plane at 12:50 a.m. this morn
ing at San Francisco. It was an eastbound flight
with several stops. He did not tell us where he
would land," said Department of Corrections
spokeswoman Rati Corsaut.
She said officers transported Carter, known
as the Bay Area's "College Terrace Rapist" in
the late 19705, from a remote prison work camp
near Alturas to the airport on Tuesday and
watched him board a flight leaving the state.
A research engineer from Livermore, Calif.,
Carter, now 52, was convicted of 23 crimes
against a dozen women, including multiple
rapes and burglaries. But at his sentencing in
1982, he confessed to more than 100 rapes.
According to court documents, he said he
assaulted an average of one woman a month for
10 years, often by invading their homes at night
and attacking them at knifepoint.
The "College Terrace Rapist" label came
from a community near Stanford University
where Carter committed several rapes. Other
Carter rapes occurred near the U-C Berkeley
and in Havward.
