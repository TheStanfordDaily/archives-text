# Successful Simpson appeal unlikely
## Legal analysts expect verdict to stand despite judge's controversial actions 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -
The judge at O.J. Simpson's civil trial
gave him plenty of ammunition for a
possible appeal. But will a higher
court dare to overturn the verdict?
Not likely, say the experts.
"I would be surprised by an appel
late court reversal in this case because
of the O.J. factor," said Loyola Uni
versity Law School Dean Laurie Lev
enson.
"You would need two judges on
appeal to say, 'I vote for 0.J.,' and
those are judges that will have to face
re-election," she said.
Simpson's lawyers haven't said
whether they will appeal, but legal
pundits have seen a wealth of errors
on the part of Superior Court Judge
Hiroshi Fujisaki that could be
grounds for reversal.
Virtually all of his most controver
sial rulings went against the defense:
Allowing testimony about a failed
lie-detector test and a call from
"Nicole" to a battered-women's shel

ter. Alleged jury misconduct. A ban on
testimony by Mark Fuhrman, the for
mer detective the defense accused of a
racist plot to frame Simpson. Allow
ing an undated letter from Nicole
Brown Simpson accusing her ex-hus
band of beating her.
Even the size of the jury's compen
satory damage award of $8.5 million
to the family of Ronald Goldman
could be grounds for appeal.
"This case is likely to be before the
courts for years to come," Lance Ito,
the judge at Simpson's murder trial,
told the Pasadena Star-News.
One obstacle for Simpson: The
Goldman and Brown families can
start seizing his bank accounts and
auctioning off his property even dur
ing the appeals process unless Simp
son posts a bond equal to 150 percent
of the verdict.
Worse, even those who feel the law
is on Simpson's side at the appeals
stage don't give him much chance of
success.

"If this were Jones vs. Smith, it
would be terrific grounds for a rever
sal," said Harvard Law professor and
appellate specialist Alan Dershowitz,
who worked for Simpson at his mur
der trial. "But in this case the names
of the parties mean more than the
legal issues."
Of all the errors, the experts said
the most egregious was the admis
sion of testimony about an unau
thenticated phone call to a battered
women's shelter from a woman
named Nicole. The woman com
plained that her famous husband
was stalking her.
Fujisaki tried to correct the error
by telling the jury later not to assume
the call came from Ms. Simpson and
not to accept it for the truth of what
was said.
In a similar move, he first allowed
testimony — inadmissible in criminal
court — that Simpson took and
flunked a lie detector test, then told
the iurv not to consider it.

Levenson said instructingjurors to
forget such testimony "is like telling
them to forget the big purple elephant
in the jury box. It's impossible."
The defense wanted to introduce
testimony from Fuhrman that blew
open the criminal trial. But Fujisaki
accepted the plaintiffs' argument that
the defense was calling him only to
discredit him — an impermissible rea
son to call a witness.
"Keeping out the Fuhrman evi
dence changed the dynamics of the
trial," Levenson said. "It was a lot
easier to put the LAPD on trial with
Fuhrman as the poster boy."
Some of the rulings by Fujisaki
during and before trial clearly consti
tuted "gross" legal error, said Peter
Arenella, a law professor at the Uni
versity of California at Los Angeles.
But he said an appeals court may
find them to be "harmless error"
because the weight of evidence
against Simpson supported the jury's
