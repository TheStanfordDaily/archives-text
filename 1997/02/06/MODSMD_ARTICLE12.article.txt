# Stroke kills ambassador Pamela Harriman, 76
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Her charm and savvy
dazzled men of power and gave a magic
touch to soirees on both sides of the
Atlantic. A wealthy socialite with keen
political instincts, she became a respected

diplomat.
Pamela Harriman, the
U.S. ambassador to
France, died yesterday,
two days after suffering a
stroke. She was 76.
Leaders remembered
her as an important
behind-the-scenes player
in U.S. politics and in
diplomacy.
"She loved France, and

she was such a great lady that she knew
spontaneously how to improve relations, to
solve the problems," said French President
Jacques Chirac.
Chirac said he would posthumously
award Harriman his nation's highest
award, a Legion of Honor medal, on Satur
day.
Donald Bandler, the deputy chief of mis
sion, announced Harriman's death at
American Hospital outside Paris as
embassy staffers stood by in tears. Bandler
is now the interim charge d'affaires at the
embassy, where the American flag flew at
half-staff.
President Clinton, whose 1992 election
victory was due in no small part to Harri
man's fund raising and political acumen,
called her "one of the most unusual and
gifted people I ever met."
"She was a source of judgment and
inspiration to me," he said.
The United State's ambassador to
France since May 1993, Harriman was the
lightning rod for often testy relations with
Paris over trade, culture, NATO restruc
turing, Bosnia, the Middle East and CIA
spying inside France.
"It was very difficult to negotiate with
her because she ardently defended U.S.
positions — but did so with such charm,

class and desire for harmony," former
French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy
said.
With charm and a brilliant smile, Harri
man succeeded easily in a Paris political
court fully aware she had Clinton's ear.
Her job, as she saw it, was to "maneu
ver small things that help in the large pic
ture."
"You can change outcomes without
appearing to have surfaced," she once said.
There were some catty remarks about
payback when Clinton named Harriman
ambassador after she co-chaired the 1992
Clinton-Gore campaign.
Unauthorized biographies portrayed
her as a social climber who married her
way to the top and had affairs with Frank
Sinatra, Italian industrialist Gianni Agnel
li, journalist Edward R. Murrow and
French banker-winemaker Elie de Roth
schild.
Harriman refused to comment on the
biographies: "It's a waste of their time and
mine," she said.
Born March 20, 1920, in Farnborough.
England, to Britain's 11th Lord Digby, sht
was married to Winston Churchill's sor
Randolph, "Sound of Music" producei
Leland Hayward and, finally, former New
York governor and U.S. ambassadoi
Averell Harriman.
In a November interview with The Asso
ciated Press, Harriman confirmed that she
would leave her post soon; aides said il
would be in early to mid-1997.
Harriman had been in intensive care
since suffering a cerebral hemorrhage after
her usual swim at the Ritz Hotel on Mon
day night.
She will be buried at Arden Estate, her
third husband's estate north of New York
City, the embassy said.
She is survived by her son, Winston
Spencer Churchill. Her funeral will be in
Washington after a memorial service in
France. No dates for the funeral or the ser
vice were released.
