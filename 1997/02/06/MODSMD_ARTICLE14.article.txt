New CIV program will
benefit freshmen, but
only with faculty support

LAST WEEK, the committee
charged with examining the
Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program released its recommenda
tions to overhaul the starting point
of every Stanford undergraduate's
career. Principal among those
changes is the elimination of a con
tiguous three-quarter program.
Instead, the new Ciy which begins
next year for some Stanford fresh
men, will introduce an intensive
first quarter of literature review fol
lowed by a two-quarter sequence
organized along a thematic line.
As a foundation class for fresh
men, CIV has had a remarkable
influence over the student body. It is
an introduction to academic life on
the Farm â€” an introduction to how
to write a college-style paper, how to
participate in section and how to
read a text. Additionally, it allows
for one-on-one interaction between
undergraduates and their postdoc
toral teaching assistants. Most of
the revisions to the program sup
port this understanding.
Many people feared the systemat
ic destruction of the year-long pro
gram in favor of programs that
relied on individualized material,
such as the new freshman seminars.
But the new CIV will retain a broad
survey of literature, tied together
thematically, in its curriculum.
The recommendation to upgrade
the status of the section leaders to
three-year, term-limited assistant
professors demonstrates the CIV
Review and Design Committee's
commitment to quality undergrad
uate instruction. One-on-one con
tact with professors is one of the
strengths of the current program.
One of the most pressing con
cerns of the current CIV program is
the breakneck speed with which
texts are handled. The review com

mittee has potentially solved this
problem with an in-depth introduc
tion. The first quarter will be spent
intensively studying only two or
three texts, which will help students
understand works that are univer
sally held as essential to an under
graduate education.
After the first quarter is complet
ed, students then move on to a two
quarter thematic course of their
choosing. This mimics the current
CIV program, in which the courses
explore European history, myth and
modernity or Europe and the Amer
icas. Additions may include courses
focused on revolutions or on love.
The main student argument for
changing the current CIV program
is the overwhelming amount of
material forced into three quar
ters. It is imperative that the two
quarter thematic sequence not try
to cover the same amount of mate
rial as before because what could
not fit into three quarters certainly
will not squeeze into two. Consid
ering the difficulty professors have
now with course management, this
downsizing should be the top prior
ity during development of the the
matic sections.
However, it is reasonable to
expect that CIV professors may be
less than thrilled about redesigning
their curricula when they have been
continually excluded from provid
ing input to the overhaul process.
Students have been afforded a gen
erous role in ClV's restructuring,
yet many of those who must actual
ly teach the CIV courses have said
they felt, for the most past, left out
and ignored. Their inclusion is
essential to a smooth transition pro
cess and to an effective establish
ment of the new program.
This effort must begin soon as
the revised CIV program will be
gradually phased-in beginning next
year. During this trial run, which
will hopefully solve any problems
with the new CIY faculty input
must be acknowledged and heeded
to help improve upon the promising
changes made to one of the founda
tions of a Stanford education.
