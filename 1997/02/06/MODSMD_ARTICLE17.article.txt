COMPLAIN, com
plain, complain.
That's how two
female Citadel cadets
have responded to
harassment by fellow
officers. According to a
recent New York Times
article, the women
"complained" of beating,

death threats and systematic assault; they
"complained" that a fellow officer poured
nail polish remover on the clothes they
were wearing and set them afire; they
"complained" of being struck on the head
with a rifle.
The cadets, Kim Messer and Jeanie
Mentavlos, join a long tradition of female
complainers, including (but certainly not
limited to) Anita Hill, Paula Corbin
Jones, the 51 women who recently
brought charges of rape and sexual
assault against officers at the Army Ordi
nance Center in Aberdeen, Md., the
7,000 women who have called a new
Army advice line to report criminal
harassment and the 15,000 women who
filed sexual harassment "complaints"
with the Equal Opportunity and Employ
ment Commission in 1996 alone.
In reading newspaper accounts of
harassment charges such as these, I am
consistently amazed at the use of the word
"complain." While one does not usually
"complain of burglary" or "complain of

murder," sexual harassment cases are
nearly always referred to as complaints.
The word is loaded with negative connota
tions. Complainers are whiners. Complain
ers are weak. Complainers just want atten
tion. Complainers should just suck it up.
And when it comes to women in the mili
tary, female complainers are not only a
nuisance, they also can't make good
cadets, soldiers or officers.
The word complaint also has uses in
medical terminology — a patient is some
times said to "complain" of stomach pain
or headaches. The medical meaning colors
the word in such a way as to suggest that
women who allege harassment have some
sort of disease. In a recent harassment
case at the Mountain View Police Depart
ment, this association was made explicit.
The city's police chief allegedly responded
to a senior officer's charges of sexual
harassment by referring to her as "the
same kind of woman who suffers from
'Battered Women's Syndrome.' "
"Battered Women's Syndrome," we
must assume, is the same disease that
harassed women have — one in which
they make exaggerated claims to elicit
attention and sympathy, to seek revenge
or simply out of a pathological compulsion
to complain.
Whether or not cadets Mentavlos and
Messer were indeed harassed beyond what
would be considered normal military stan
dards, it's pretty clear to me that they

deserve the right to bring charges without
being stereotyped as complainers. By
reporting what happened to them, these
women and the thousands of others who
file harassment charges each year are any
thing but weak and whiny. They are the
ones who have been brave enough to come
forward. Risking their credibility, their jobs
and sometimes their safety, they are fight
ing for the right to (gasp!) be treated with
respect and fairness.
I can relate. As a public feminist, I am
always aware of the risk of being regarded
as a complainer. The conventional wisdom
suggests that feminists, like women who
file sexual harrasment charges, complain
too much. Feminists can't take a joke >
Feminists are overly sensitive. Feminists
can't get attention any other way.
These stereotypes cr'eep into my life in
a million little ways. And I am aware that
this column could in itself be seen as
another tiresome feminist complaint. So
let me be clear: To be a feminist is to rec
ognize injustice and to work for positive
change in society. It is to endow women
with the confidence to voice their concerns
and opinions fearlessly. It is to defend
equality and freedom. Isn't that what our
police and armed forces are supposed to
do, too?
