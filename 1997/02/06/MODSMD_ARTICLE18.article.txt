Universities are designed to benefit all of society

UNDER THE HEADLINE "A Uni
versity for Students," fliers from
the ASSU president's office
recently announced a campaign based on
four "general principles." I should like to
comment on these points one by one.
"1) Universities were created for stu
dents." Of course they were, and Stan
ford is second to none in its thorough re
examination of how it is serving under
graduate students. We also have just
begun a major effort to raise endowment
for graduate student fellowships. Many
members of the faculty, the administra
tion and I have devoted much of the last
five years to an effort to get it right —
including discussing these issues with
students over countless hours.
So, the first "general principle" is cor
rect. It is not, however, complete. Uni
versities were, above all, created for the
search to know, the search for truth. As
I said in 1992 to the then-entering class:
"I am sometimes asked these days
whether teaching will be one of my pri
orities as president. Of course it will. As

will be research. The question is well
meant, but ill conceived. In the best uni
versities — and you are at one of the
best universities in the world — teach
ing, learning and research are all equally
important elements of the all-embracing
search to know. . . . Your search to know
and our search to know are interdepen
dent: It is our task to inform and chal
lenge you, and it is your task to question
and challenge us and to seek out oppor
tunities to do research with us so that
the search to know may go on."
"2) Universities are fundamentally
different than for-profit businesses."
Indeed they are. An institution that sub
sidizes both students and research, and
that can balance its books only because
of donations from alumni and friends,
hardly meets the most rudimentary
expectations concerning profit maxi
mization.
While universities are different from
for-profit entities, they are not exempted
from worries about such matters as rev
enues, expenses and investment perfor

mance. For example, Stanford, itself,
provides more than $33 million per year
in nonathletic undergraduate scholar
ships, one-third of it from endowment
income. Stanford's endowment perfor
mance is of great significance for our
ability to help students.
"3) Universities should not just pro
vide a private benefit, they also need to
work for the public welfare and be aware
of their social impact." For whom are
universities providing a private benefit?
I think of education as a public good, but
if students consider this a wrongful "pri
vate benefit," then Stanford should close
its doors. Is research a "private benefit"?
Remember that it not only is an integral
part of a university education but also
supplies incalculable public good — and
of a kind that almost no one else would
provide, because creation of knowledge
and open publication of findings are not
easily reconciled with bottom lines.
Is fund raising and investment a "pri
vate benefit"? Their object is to support
the public good of teaching and research

and to help restrain tuition increases
and deal with government cutbacks.
"4) Based on these principles, univer
sities today must work to re-create
themselves for the benefit of both stu
dents and society."
In preserving, creating and transmit
ting knowledge, in the search for truth,
universities already exist precisely for
the benefit of students and society. The
university is one of the most noble forms
of public service I know.
One of the great university reformers
of the early 19th century observed that
the idea of disciplined intellectual activi
ties, embodied in universities, is the
most valuable element of "moral cul
ture" — an indisputable public benefit.
Universities are by no means perfect.
But I believe the synthesis that follows
from Stanford's combination of teaching
and research is the most fertile source of
innovation and benefit for undergraduate
students, graduate students and society.
