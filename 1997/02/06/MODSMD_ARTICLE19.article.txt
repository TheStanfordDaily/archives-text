# Grad students need a little more respect
## 
### 
Last Friday's article on the lack of
structure in the graduate community
was excellent and accurately summed up
what I think most graduate students feel
but may not say. What's even more
depressing is that everyone just seems to
accept the fact that that's the way grad

nate student life has to be.
That's bull. I mean, we're paying over
$30,000 a year. . . . The least we can do is
get our money's worth. I think the root
of the graduate student plight lies in
graduate housing because this is the
environment where it should be, but
isn't, the easiest to make friends. The
"on-campus" graduate residences are
totally isolated from the heart of campus.
I've talked to some undergraduates, who
have no idea where or what "EV" is.

The isolation wouldn't be so had if
there were a common social area where
graduate students could go to hangout,
study and meet others without needing
to walk the mile to the Coffee House. Of
course, the Coffee House is fine, but
after a long day it would be nice to just
walk to a central lounge not too far from
your doorstep. It's the simple daiiy plea
sures of socializing that ultimately make
graduate students happy or sad, not the
one time pleasures of the Big Game, as

Dean of Students Marc Wais patroniz
ingly offers in the article.
Remember, it's the little, daily things
that make or break people's happiness,
and I think if graduate students had a
more pleasant social environment to
come home to at the end of the day,
more people would view graduate school
as something to enjoy rather than sur
vive.
