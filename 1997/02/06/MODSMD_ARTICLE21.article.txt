"I believe that the cause of these stu
dents — this generation — wi11... prove to
be right. Why? Because youth has a way of
being uncontaminated by the manipulation
of politics and youth knows the truth."
— Muhamed Sacirbey,
foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
National Press Club,
Washington, July 1995
IRONICALLY, UNIVERSITY Presi
dent Gerhard Casper refused to meet
Sacirbey when he was Bosnian
ambassador to the United Nations and
visited Stanford in May 1993 at the
height of the Bosnian genocide. Why?
To quote Casper in Tuesday's Daily
(indeed he was actually quoting some
one else), "A university cannot take col
lective action on the issues of the day
without endangering the conditions for
its existence and effectiveness. There is
no mechanism by which it can reach a
collective position without inhibiting
that full freedom of dissent on which it
thrives."
It can be weakly argued that in 1993
Casper was not aware of the tragedy's

extent (far too many of us weren't), but
the president had another chance, which
he also missed.
By January 1994, things had
changed in the former Yugoslavia. It
had become clear that Serbian national
ist forces had killed hundreds of thou
sands of people, and many publicly
called for arming the Bosnian Muslims
in the name of self-defense. In this con
text, the Stanford chapter of Students
Against Genocide invited the Bosnian
ambassador to the United States, Sven
Alkalj, to speak on campus.
I was a freshman at the time, and I
vaguely remember the event, which I
regrettably did not attend. Being rela
tively ignorant, I wondered who Alkalj
was, and why there was no formal Uni
versity presence at the event. Certainly,
if any other country's ambassador to the
United States made an appearance on
campus, University officials would role
out a huge welcome mat. But this was
clearly not the case.
Education graduate student Brad
Blitz, one of the organizers of the event,
told me he discussed Alkalj and Bosnia

with Casper one afternoon in January
1994.
Blitz recalled that Casper refused to
take a stand as university president. "I
believe that Dr. Casper the individual
agrees with me, but that is not
enough," he said.
Any university president should be
cautious with public statements (Casper
is very aware of this), but there are clear
ly issues which matter. In these cases,
Casper should not be afraid to speak up.
Perhaps University investment policy
is too sensitive an issue, but it is certain
ly no less controversial than Prop. 209.
In recent months, Casper took a strong
position defending the University's use
of affirmative action but only after UC-
Berkeley's Chancellor Chang Lin Tien
and countless other university heads
throughout the state gave him the neces
sary political cover to do so.
And of course, that was an issue
which had absolutely no effect on Stan
ford's admissions policies; private uni
versities are not affected by the measure
and no one important around here seems
eager to completely scrap affirmative

action, anyway. In short, it was a rela
tively safe issue.
Still, affirmative action and responsi
ble investment are not nearly as signifi
cant as genocide. Justifying his decision
not to get involved in Alkalj's visit,
Casper told Blitz, there might come a
moment when he would have to put aside
his principles as university president and
follow his own conscience.
If the Bosnian genocide wasn't an
appropriate moment, what would be?
Blitz and another Stanford student,
Sheri Eink, wrote two chapters in
Thomas Cushman and Stjepan Mestro
vic's "This Time We Knew," a chronicle
of the Bosnian genocide which illustrates
the vast amount of information available
at the time and how important public
officials stood by silently. A section of
Eink's chapter is titled, "Academia's
Apathy," and it describes behavior far
more objectionable than Casper's.
Do not take my word for this. Blitz
wrote a letter to The Daily on Jan. 28,
1994, detailing his encounter with
Casper. Eink refers to the letter in Cush
man and Mestrovic's book.

The point is, Stanford is not the "ivory
tower" that so many of us decry. Adminis
trators, faculty members and students do
venture outside the Campus Drive loop.
Many of us came to Stanford because we
knew it would prepare us for life after col
lege, and some don't wait for graduation
to get involved. These people should be
commended, not slapped back down.
Sadly, Casper's comments in Tues
day's Daily regarding socially responsible
investments and the ASSU s "University
for Students" campaign demonstrate the
same kind of faulty logic he employed
regarding Bosnia three years ago.
President Casper, faculty and alumni:
The students of this university are
among its most precious assets. You
would all be much better served by giving
us a seat at the dinner table than by casu
ally dismissing us.
