## Basketball readies for key Pac-10 tilts with Troy Surprising Trojan men look for upset 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
It's been the trend of late that
Stanford teams have embarked
on their annual Los Angeles road
trip counting on at least one vic
tory. With USC falling on lean
times the past few years following
the departure of players like
Harold Miner and Robert Pack —
who helped lead the Trojans to
back-to-back NCAA tournament
appearances in the early '90s —
Cardinal fans have come to
expect nothing less than a victory
when Stanford makes its annual
pilgrimage to USC.
UCLA, now that's a different
story. Stanford would be lucky —
or so goes conventional wisdom
— to walk away from Westwood
with anything but a decisive
defeat to the perennial power
house Bruins.
But that was then; this is now.
When No. 16 Stanford meets
USC tonight at 7:30 in the front
end of a two-game trip that also
takes the Cardinal to UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion for a nationally
televised game on Saturday, a dif
ferent Trojan team will be on dis
play than in recent years.
Midway through the Pacific
10 Conference schedule, USC is
suddenly a major player in the
hunt for the conference title.
Coming off a road sweep of the
Oregon schools last weekend,
the Trojans (11-7) are 6-3 in Pac
-10 play — equaling the number
of conference victories they post
ed in the last two years combined
— and tied for second place in
the conference with Stanford
(13-4, 6-3), California and Ari
zona, just one game behind first
place UCLA.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery says he's not surprised.
"I really, in many ways, feared

the Bears.
them more than UCLA," he said.
"I don't think they're as talented,
but I do think that they cause peo
ple some problems. They are ath
letic, and they do have depth. And
they take people out of their
game."
If these Trojans look different
from past USC teams, it's because
they are. All but three scholarship
players on the 1996-97 roster did
not play for team last year. That
includes two starters — guards
Rodrick Rhodes, a transfer from
Kentucky, and Elias Ayuso, who
played at junior college in New
Mexico last season — as well as
key reserves Cary Williams, Ken
Sims and Anthony White, all
junior-college transfers.
The Cardinal was able to hold
off USC in a hard-fought 85-70
victory at Maples Pavilion on Jan.
11, but this time the venue is the
Los Angeles Sports Arena, where
the Trojans dealt Stanford an 84-
80 upset loss last season. And this

season, the Cardinal has been a
different team on the road, where
it is 2-3, than at home (4-0). Case
in point: Stanford is shooting 52
percent at Maples Pavilion but
just 39 percent away from home.
"We don't play with as much
confidence on the road, like most
young kids," Montgomery said,
"but maybe that could be more
simply explained by saying the
other team is playing with more
confidence. Familiarity, the feel
ing that you're going to be suc
cessful, having a couple of shots
go in for you early, having the
crowd pick you up when you
make a mistake — all those
things have always played into
this thing."
If tonight's game is going to be
tough, then Saturday's show
down at UCLA could be murder.
As if the Bruins don't have
enough incentive to win, with the
second-place Cardinal nipping at
their heels in the conference
standings, they will also be play
ing to erase the memory of last
month's 48-point blowout loss at
Maples — UCLA's worst defeat in
school history.

"Since that time, they have
played extremely well," Mont
gomery said. "I think everybody
has listened a little bit more to
ihead coach Steve Lavin] and
they've gotten together, because
it really pointed up that maybe
what they were doing wasn't
going to work for them. So it's
made them a better basketball
team.
"And sure, they're going to be
very excited about undoing what
happened here."
Add it all up, and it could be the
Cardinal's toughest road trip of
the season — not to mention one
of its most important. Two wins
would put Stanford in first place,
while two losses could easily drop
the Cardinal as low as sixth.
Nonetheless, insists Mont
gomery, there's "no such thing"
as a pivotal road trip.
"Obviously, if we can win a
game or two, it would be huge, but
there's too many games left to
play," Montgomery said. "We're a
game out of first, we're a game
out of sixth. UCI.A, who's in first
place, is two games out of sixth.
So it's still very bunched up."
