## Basketball readies for key Pac-10 tilts with Troy Surprising Trojan men look for upset 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
It's been the trend of late that
Stanford teams have embarked
on their annual Los Angeles road
trip counting on at least one vic
tory. With USC falling on lean
times the past few years following
the departure of players like
Harold Miner and Robert Pack —
who helped lead the Trojans to
back-to-back NCAA tournament
appearances in the early '90s —
Cardinal fans have come to
expect nothing less than a victory
when Stanford makes its annual
pilgrimage to USC.
UCLA, now that's a different
story. Stanford would be lucky —
or so goes conventional wisdom
— to walk away from Westwood
with anything but a decisive
defeat to the perennial power
house Bruins.
But that was then; this is now.
When No. 16 Stanford meets
USC tonight at 7:30 in the front
end of a two-game trip that also
takes the Cardinal to UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion for a nationally
televised game on Saturday, a dif
ferent Trojan team will be on dis
play than in recent years.
Midway through the Pacific
10 Conference schedule, USC is
suddenly a major player in the
hunt for the conference title.
Coming off a road sweep of the
Oregon schools last weekend,
the Trojans (11-7) are 6-3 in Pac
-10 play — equaling the number
of conference victories they post
ed in the last two years combined
— and tied for second place in
the conference with Stanford
(13-4, 6-3), California and Ari
zona, just one game behind first
place UCLA.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery says he's not surprised.
