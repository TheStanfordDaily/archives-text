# USC, No. 3 Stanford women battle for top spot at Maples
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The sequel may not be as
good as the original, but this
much is certain â€” tonight's
game in Maples Pavilion
between Stanford and USC will
be a battle for first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Last month in Los Angeles,
USC (14-4, 8-1) came within a
Tina Thompson miss at the
buzzer of upsetting the third
ranked Cardinal (21-1, 9-0). Led
by senior forward Kate Star
bird's phenomenal 40 points and
a layup by senior guard
Charmin Smith with nine sec
onds to go, Stanford escaped
from the Lyon Center with a 77-
76 win.
"This is a very big game for
us," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "USC is in
second place by one game and
one point, and I'm sure they
don't like it."
With the first half of confer
ence play in the books, both
teams begin the stretch run of
the season with this intriguing
7:30 p.m. rematch of Pac-10
powers. Not only is first place at
stake tonight, but there is also
the battle between Starbird and
Thompson, the two all-time
leading active scorers in the Pac
-10. The Trojan senior forward is
four points away from 2,000
while Starbird goes into tonight
with 1,946 points. Both carried
their respective teams in last
month's game, as Thompson led
her squad with 25 points.
"This is why our team prac
tices, to have games like this,"
VanDerveer said. "Playing at
home in front of 7,000 fans and
playing for the championship,
this is great."
USC will be hard-pressed to
duplicate its performance, espe
cially with the scene shifting to
Maples, where the Cardinal
have not dropped a conference

game since the 1990-91 season
and have not lost to anyone at
home since Starbird's freshman
year. Still, the Trojans (the only
other team to win the confer
ence outright besides Stanford
this decade) pose a serious
threat to the Cardinal as it has
rolled to an 8-1 Pac-10 mark.
The Women of Troy are com
ing off a sweep of the Oregon
schools, as they held off Oregon
State 85-72 Friday night and
edged Oregon 73-65 Sunday
afternoon. Thompson has led
the way, averaging 22.3 points
per game and more than 11
rebounds per game, both tops in
the Pac-10. Senior center
Michelle Campbell leads the
league in blocks and is also in
double figures at 11.9 points per
game, adding a second threat
down low.
"I think they're a legitimate
top-25 team, VanDerveer said
"They've got a lot of talent on
their team. They've got a good
inside game, good outside game,
and they rebound well. They've
had an excellent year."
Since its visit to Southern
California, Stanford has had to
battle injuries. Prior to the USC
game, the Cardinal lost the ser
vices of junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard for three weeks, and
senior guard Jamila Wideman
was hobbled with an ankle
injury for five games, including
the game against the Women of
Troy.
Wideman is almost back to
full strength, and Nygaard just
returned to the lineup last week,
but now junior forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele is out with a
month-long knee injury.
However, if last Friday's
game against California is any
indication, there will certainly
be no dropoff for the biggest
home game of the season Junior
center Olvmpia Scott has been a
