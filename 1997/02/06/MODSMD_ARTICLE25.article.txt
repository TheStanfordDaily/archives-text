# Men to scrum with Broncos
## Tritons come to Maloney in women's match 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Both men's and women's rugby teams
head out to Maloney Field this Saturday
for home matches beginning at 1 p.m.
The men face Santa Clara in their final
match before entering league play Feb. 15.
The second-ranked Cardinal has been very
successful all season, thanks in part to its
size.
But as it enters league competition, the
team has to change its playing style in
order to compensate for the loss of senior
Jason White, one of Stanford's largest
players. White was drafted into the World
League of American Football and will no
longer play for Stanford rugby.

The men should take note of their
female counterparts, who have successful
ly overcome their small size by setting the
tempo of the game and not allowing their
opponents to become too aggressive.
The team "has to work a little bit more
on their pace," said head coach Franck
Boivert. "They showed that they were fit
ter than their opposition [in a 22-10 victo
ry over St. Mary's on Saturdayl so there
fore they've got to use this fitness by
putting more pace into their game.
"It will be very simple things like ball
handling and alignment and getting posi
tioned a little bit faster" that will help the
team improve, Boivert said.
The women seek to continue
improving upon the strategy
they have used throughout most
of this season when they face
UC-San Diego on Saturday.
Their lack of size has forced
the women to utilize their quick
er speed against larger oppo
nents. On offense the women
have learned to avoid their
adversaries by trying to get
around them, while on defense
the team pressures the ball,
keeping other squads from
becoming too aggressive. Con

trolling the tempo of the game
may be the only way to make up
for their small physical stature.
It can also be the deciding factor
in a match, as Stanford demon
strated last weekend in a 35-0
rout of UC-Santa Cruz.
"This weekend we were able
to keep the defense and the
offense on their heels almost
whole game, which is just a
result of us putting pressure on
them the whole time," said
senior Keiko Suda. "That was
one of the reasons we were so
successful against Santa Cruz. I
think we just need to continue to
work on our ball handling and
our control when we have
turnovers."
