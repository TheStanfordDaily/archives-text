# Wily wrestlers to chase Roadrunners
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Coming off a weekend of
mixed results, Stanford
wrestling looks to reassert itself
as it meets two tough Pacific 10
Conference rivals this weekend,
Cal State-Bakersfield and Cal
State-Fullerton. Although both
squads should challenge the
Cardinal, Stanford will also
have to contend with numerous
nagging injuries to several
starters.
"We haven't been wrestling as
well as we should be, and this
weekend will give us an opportu
nity to rebound and test our
selves against solid Pacific 10
competition," said sophomore
Tim Kendall.
On Saturday, the wrestlers
travel to Bakersfield to take on
the Roadrunners. Ranked 13th
nationally and coming off an
impressive third-place finish in
the NCAAs and a Pac-10 cham
pionship last season, Cal State
liakersfield will certainly chal
lenge the Cardinal at each
weight class despite losing two
AU-Americans from last year.
Three Roadrunner wrestlers
are currently ranked in the top
five in the nation in their class.
At 1*26 pounds, Coby Wright,
who last year placed fourth in
NCAAs and won at Pac-lOs, is
ranked No. 3. At 142 pounds,
Jason Ramstedder is ranked No.
5, and heavyweight Steve Neale
is ranked No. 2. Neale, described
by Stanford coach Chris Horpel
as "one of the best wrestlers in
the nation," took fourth place
last year in NCAAs and is expect
ed to finish near the top again
this year.

UC-Davis earlier this season.
Warren McPhersen, a sopho
more, will wrestle at 142 pounds
against Ramstedder, who beat
McPhersen by only one point
earlier this season. Fellow sopho
more Zach Zimmerer will hit the
mat at 126 pounds, and senior
Chris Serjak will likely compete
in the heavyweight spot.
"Though our team is pretty
wounded at this point, I think we
should match up well against
Bakersfield," Horpel said. "They
will definitely be a real challenge
for us."
Stanford's injured list includes
senior Brian Vaniman at 190
pounds with a broken wrist,
junior Jason Gladden at 177
pounds with a sprained shoulder,
junior Robert Hatta at 134
pounds with a sprained ankle and
sophomore Beau Weiner at 142
pounds with neck problems.
Because junior Scott Chapman
at 167 pounds has been unable to
practice this week due to shoul

der problems, he may not wrestle
this weekend. Senior Chris Ser
jak is currently sick but should
recover in time for this weekend's
action.
"Many wrestlers have had
tremendous individual perfor
mances this season, but as a team
we haven't been able to coincide
such performances to give a team
effort that represents what we're
capable of," McPhersen said. "We
just hope that everything will fall
into place before Pac-lOs roll
around."
Sunday the Card travels to Cal
State-Fullerton to take on the
Titans. Although a healthy Stan
ford team would be favored
against Fullerton, the match will
likely be very close as a result of
the numerous injuries to Cardinal
grapplers.
If Chapman wrestles, it will be
a rematch of last weekend's All-
California meet, where he split
matches with Fullerton's Jason
Webster. At 150 pounds, sopho
more B.J. Sanchez hopes to follow
up his first-place finish last week
end with another impressive per
formance.
