# Wily wrestlers to chase Roadrunners

### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Coming off a weekend of
mixed results, Stanford
wrestling looks to reassert itself
as it meets two tough Pacific 10
Conference rivals this weekend,
Cal State-Bakersfield and Cal
State-Fullerton. Although both
squads should challenge the
Cardinal, Stanford will also
have to contend with numerous
nagging injuries to several
starters.
"We haven't been wrestling as
well as we should be, and this
weekend will give us an opportu
nity to rebound and test our
selves against solid Pacific 10
competition," said sophomore
Tim Kendall.
On Saturday, the wrestlers
travel to Bakersfield to take on
the Roadrunners. Ranked 13th
nationally and coming off an
impressive third-place finish in
the NCAAs and a Pac-10 cham
pionship last season, Cal State
liakersfield will certainly chal
lenge the Cardinal at each
weight class despite losing two
AU-Americans from last year.
Three Roadrunner wrestlers
are currently ranked in the top
five in the nation in their class.
At 1*26 pounds, Coby Wright,
who last year placed fourth in
NCAAs and won at Pac-lOs, is
ranked No. 3. At 142 pounds,
Jason Ramstedder is ranked No.
5, and heavyweight Steve Neale
is ranked No. 2. Neale, described
by Stanford coach Chris Horpel
as "one of the best wrestlers in
the nation," took fourth place
last year in NCAAs and is expect
ed to finish near the top again
this year.
