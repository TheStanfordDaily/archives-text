The women's gymnastics
team will face off against No. 10
Arizona State and UC Santa
Barbara tomorrow night at the
Burnham Pavilion with a new
mindset.
Ranked 11th in the nation,
the Cardinal squad has faced one
top-notch team after another
this season, and the Wildcats are
no exception.
Sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami said Stanford will no
doubt face some tough competi
tion from the Arizona team.
Having narrowly missed going to
the NCAA National Champi
onships last year, the Wildcats
are "really hungry for it this sea
son," Murakami said.
Coach Lisa Izzi was careful to
note that Santa Barbara has
been on the rise in recent years
and cannot be taken lightly
either.
"We can't pretend they aren't
going to be challenging," Izzi
said. "We don't want them to
creep up and get us."
Although the Stanford gym
nasts have impressed their audi
ences with outstanding individu
al performances throughout the
season, they have fallen short of
team victories. Falls, shaky
landings, and several minor mis
takes have haunted the team
and continuously kept the tal
ented squad from notching a
win.
After three falls on the beam
and a slip off the bars event
dropped the Card to third place
in a tight meet at Arizona last
weekend, the team decided it
was time to sit down and figure
something out.
In"the meets so far, we've
been beating ourselves,"
Murakami said. "We need to just
relax. If someone falls, there's
no reason to flip out — the next
person will pick it up. The only
chain reaction we want is to feed
off of each other's success."

Izzi said that in order to gain
consistency on the core of the
routines the team members were
having problems with, they
started working intensively on
the psychological approach,
devoting time and energy to
mental training.
In order to reach the deep
state of relaxation necessary to
remain in control for the beam
apparatus, the squad set aside
30 minutes of team practice
every day for mental exercises.
In addition, each gymnast
worked on image training on
their own outside the gym.
According to Izzi, the mental
training has gotton positive
feedback in the gymnasium. The
team is looking more confident
as each gymnast chose two skills
out of her beam routine, imag
ined it five times in her head,
physically performed the routine
in practice, and then each one
went over her routines with Izzi,
discussing what the distractions
might have been, she said.
This kind of training has
helped team members to focus
on each move rather than think
ing of results while performing
the beam, Murakami added.
"We've been talking a lot
about the team," Murakami
said. "We motivated to fix all the
little things and told ourselves
that we can't have these falls,
that we can't keep bombing
events."
Junior Misty Moore, who this
year plays the role of undergrad
uate team assistant after a back
injury forced her to retire last
season, believes the mental
approach will definitely help the
squad achieve team consistency,
on the beam in particular.
"Ninety percent (of the beam
routine! is mental, and they've
been doing great in practice"
this week, Moore said. "The
team is on its way uphill now.
The meet will mainly come down
to who is more consistent, who
hits more."
Junior co-captain Keri Mona

han, who came in second in the all
around category last week in Ari
zona, said the team has had strong
practices this week and is well pre
pared to challenge itself tomorrow.

"We're feeling pretty good,"
Monahan said. "Having under
gone mental preparation and
training really hard numbers,
we feel more confident."
