The third of ASSU president Bill
Shen's nominees for the constitutional
council is one of the ASSU's elder states
men. Nawwar Kasrawi's involvement
with the ASSU began in 1991 and has in
cluded a term as the chair of its senate.
Kasrawi wants the post, he said, be
cause he has "the skills and background to
help the association on this body."

Shen said there were "few people on
this campus who know more about the
ASSU and the constitution than Nawwar
Kasrawi."
Applying for the post represents a con
siderable change of mind for Kasrawi,
who originally opposed "Constitution 96"
and its judicial branch provision when
they were proposed last year.
On further consideration, Kasrawi
said, he concluded that the council was "a
valuable body" given the "inherent con

flict of interest of the senate judging it
self."
While he now completely approves of
the council, Kasrawi interprets the stu
dent vote as calling for a council with a
clearly limited role.
"I think what people wanted was a
body that could review [other branches of
the ASSUI when complaints are
brought," he said.
