The third of ASSU president Bill
Shen's nominees for the constitutional
council is one of the ASSU's elder states
men. Nawwar Kasrawi's involvement
with the ASSU began in 1991 and has in
cluded a term as the chair of its senate.
Kasrawi wants the post, he said, be
cause he has "the skills and background to
help the association on this body."

Shen said there were "few people on
this campus who know more about the
ASSU and the constitution than Nawwar
Kasrawi."
Applying for the post represents a con
siderable change of mind for Kasrawi,
who originally opposed "Constitution 96"
and its judicial branch provision when
they were proposed last year.
On further consideration, Kasrawi
said, he concluded that the council was "a
valuable body" given the "inherent con

flict of interest of the senate judging it
self."
While he now completely approves of
the council, Kasrawi interprets the stu
dent vote as calling for a council with a
clearly limited role.
"I think what people wanted was a
body that could review [other branches of
the ASSUI when complaints are
brought," he said.
For Kasrawi, this mandate does
not mean that the unelected body
will have jurisdiction over every as
pect of the ASSU's actions. He noted
that the constitution gives the coun
cil the authority to ride only issues
pertaining to the constitution and
not issues concerning interpreta
tions of the ASSU's bylaws.
Issues where he sees the council
as potentially active include the
Bone-Overdeck Amendment,
which prohibits the ASSU from
making statements on external is
sues that do not affect at least one
Stanford student.
Kasrawi also thought special-fee
issues would likely come before the
council, noting that the constitu
tion was "particularly verbose" on
that point.
While he sees a seat on the con
stitutional council as a limited
rather than an activist job, that is
not the approach he brought to his
previous ASSU positions, including
the chair of the senate in the 1994-
95 school year
"Throughout my term as senate
chair, we did things; we were very
activist," Kasrawi said.
He said his most important
achievement was in the area of fund
raising. When the Stanford Fund
was first created, the University
placed restrictions on fund raising

by student groups.
According to Kasrawi, adverse
reaction from student groups and
the senate caused the University to
eventually provide the current
mechanism whereby student
groups can raise money by having
their members work for the Stan
ford Fund.
Kasrawi also referred to his
work on special-fee reform. During
his term as senate chair, Kasrawi
backed legislation known as the
Balanced Funding Deal, which, he
said had two essential points: sepa
rate fees for graduates and under
graduates and abolition of fee re
funds.
The legislation passed the senate
but was defeated in a subsequent
student referendum. The proposal
that was finally enacted, Common
Sense Fee Reform, did separate the
constituencies but did not abolish
refunds.
"However much | the Balanced
Funding Deal) might have been
controversial, I think it laid the
stage lor fee reform as something
that had to be done."
If indeed it was controversial,
that would not make it a unique ex
perience for Kasrawi. His nomina
tion to the council has been ques
tioned, in part because of his associ
ation with Shen and implications of
favoritism.
Shen called Kasrawi "a trusted
friend," but said he had applied and
gone through the same process as all
the other nominees. Kasrawi con

firmed this and called the nomina
tions process "very good and very
open."
Given Kasrawi's close friendship
with Shen and his history in the
ASSU, Shen acknowledged Kas
rawi's nomination would face oppo
sition. Shen said current senate
chair Don Aingworth had "mount
ed a campaign" against Kasrawi.
Aingworth admitted that he
would attempt to block Kasrawi's
nomination but insisted he had had
no such intentions prior to a series
of personal attacks Kasrawi made
on him at Tuesday's ASSU meet
ing.
Prior to Tuesday night, Aing
worth said, his only objection to the
nomination was that Kaswari
would not promise to cease writing
legislation if confirmed.
Aingworth said Kasrawi's "very
unprofessional" outburst "solidi
fied my opinion against him," and
he would not chair the senate while
it was considering Kasrawi's nomi
nation because of the excessive ani
mosity between them.
He added that while he had not
researched other senators' opin
ions, he thought Kasrawi's nomina
tion might have a problem due to
lack of support from graduate sena
tors.
Both Shen and Kasrawi remain
veiy optimistic about the prospects
of nomination.
"I'll go to the mat for Nawwar,"
Shen said. He added that the debate
on Kaswari was "movingaway from

whether Nawwar will make a good
council member and becoming
something ugly."
Shen admitted he had expected
these problems when he nominated
Kasrawi.
"A little controversy is helpful,
and Nawwar's bringing it," Shen
said. The contentious atmosphere
comes not only from his current as
sociation with Shen but also his his
tory in the ASSU.
Kaswari withdrew from his first
election for the senate in 1991 after
a mass campaign e-mail he had sent
to more than 2,000 students at
tracted considerable criticism.
The senate's action action on the
Balanced Funding Deal also drew
then-chair Kasrawi into a fight
when he disqualified two graduate
senators from voting.
The senators were barred when
Kasrawi invoked the seldom-ob
served rule that in order to vote,
senators had to wear a special
sweatshirt that identified them as
senators. The senators were op
posed to the motion and had they
voted it would not have passed.
"I'm not someone who pursues
controversy," Kasrawi insisted.
He admitted that he regretted
the sweateshirt incident, but noted
that a vote to overrule his decision
had failed at the time, as had a vote
to unseat him, the latter by a 19-1
margin.
He said that interpreting his ac
tion as defying the will of the senate
was "a gross misrepresentation."

a mass campaign e-mail he had sent
to more than 2,000 students at
tracted considerable criticism.
The senate's action action on the
Balanced Funding Deal also drew
then-chair Kasrawi into a fight
when he disqualified two graduate
senators from voting.
The senators were barred when
Kasrawi invoked the seldom-ob
served rule that in order to vote,
senators had to wear a special
sweatshirt that identified them as
senators. The senators were op
posed to the motion and had they
voted it would not have passed.
"I'm not someone who pursues
controversy," Kasrawi insisted.
He admitted that he regretted
the sweateshirt incident, but noted
that a vote to overrule his decision
had failed at the time, as had a vote
to unseat him, the latter by a 19-1
margin.
He said that interpreting his ac
tion as defying the will of the senate
was "a gross misrepresentation."
