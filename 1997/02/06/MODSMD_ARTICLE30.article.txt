# New rules for Stanford Fund volunteers
## 
### Kori Wen Contributing writer 
Due to incidents of alcohol consumption, dis
respect to managers on duty and general negli
gence of duties, the Student Group Partnership
division of the Student Fund has implemented
new guidelines for conduct during work shifts.
These rules include the prohibition of food,
beverages, outside work and pets in the office,
taking away a group's bonus if a member is ab
sent from a scheduled shift, dismissing workers
who make excessive noise or disrespect the facil
ity or manager on duty, according to an e-mail
sent to the student groups.
"The partnership was established in an effort
to provide student groups with an opportunity
to raise funds for their group activities," said
Brooke Eittreim, coordinator of the Stanford
Fund.
Except for the student managers, the part
nership does not pay students. Instead, in re
turn for working shifts, students receive fees

that go towards their organization.
"The partnership was also established ab
sent of major rules and regulations. We've pro
vided a 'rule-free' program," Eittreim contin
ued.
"Apparently, to our error, we assumed stu
dents working through the Partnership would
be able to participate as responsible, respectful
and ethical adults. We were wrong, and several
incidents have forced us to formalize a list of reg
ulations which will be enforced," she said.
According to the e-mail, the original lack of
rules had many negative consequences. For
one, food spills reportedly ruined important
donor letters. In addition, participants occa
sionally exhibited rude behavior toward the
managers and mistreated the trailers in which
they worked.
Senior Mina Pak, a student manager at the
fund, said, "The trailers we use to write letters
in are donated, and it would be a shame if they
were taken away because of a few people's ac
tions."

Brian Perronne, director of young alumni
and student development, described an occur
rence of two students bringing beer to a shift.
When confronted, they responded that there
were no rules against alcohol.
Perronne said, "It's not our intention to be $
place of rules," but given such abuse of the
Honor Code, he, too, saw no other alternative.
Many students reacted positively to the deci
sion to enforce rules. Sophomore Ann Karash, a
former fund employee said, "The office lacked
order when I worked there — it was almost imr
possible to get fired. I think the new guidelines
will provide more structure to the system."
Junior Julie Johnson, an active participant
in the partnership said, "I think the rules are ba
sically common sense."
In response to why she believes the rules were
implemented, Johnson replied, "My guess is that
each one of those rules have been broken at some
time. I think some group just had a lot of fun and
didn't do a good job. I hope that people see the sit
uation now and are a little bit more careful."
