# Panel considers controversial ethics of the Genome Project

At a panel discussion last night, Stanford scientists,
along with colleagues from across the world, talked
about looking for"the Holy Grail of human genetics," a
complete map of the genetic blueprint of a human being.
This search is the mission of the Human Genome
Project, which is partially based at Stanford. While it
could mean a revolution in medical knowledge, it also
brings hundreds of ethical questions that humanity
will have to face.
The scientists and private-sector biotechnology rep
resentatives discussed these complicated issues as part
of a presentation organized by Stanford In Govern
ment's Campus Awareness Committee.
"This is like the Industrial Revolution for biology,"
declared Roy Whitfield, president of Incyte Pharma
ceuticals, "and it will create an equal number of ethical
dilemmas."
At present the largest and most controversial issue
is that of access to genetic information by insurance
companies.
In many cases tests are developed years before any
sort of treatment will be available, which means that
people who test positive may be denied forms of insur
ance, according to Chuck Ludlam, the vice president of
government relations for the Biotechnology Industry
Organization.
"People should not be afraid to take a test," he said.

Ludlam also explained how he and his committee re
cently lobbied to get the Health Insurance Portability
Bill, which prevents health care discrimination based
on genetic information, passed by Congress.
The panelists also discussed the problem of increas
ing drug prices. Ludlam said if the government insti
tuted some form of price control, all research in new
drugs, genetic or otherwise, would end.
Calling genetic biotechnology "the biggest money
losing industry in the history of any human economy,"
Ludlam defended the right of drug companies to recoup
that loss.
Another important issue is how genetic therapy will
affect human society. David Cox, director of the
Human Genome Project at Stanford, pointed out that
it will never be possible to eliminate genetic disease in
the human population because of mutations and other
effects.
All emphasized that many of the problems are not
just with genetics but in the general lack of control of
medical records.
'There is a law against finding out what you rent at
Blockbuster [Video] but not against going and looking
in your medical records," said Cox.
They also stressed that despite the fact that it will
not be long before scientists have mapped all 3 million
of the individual chemical pairings that make up the
100,000 genes in the human genome, there is still a
long way to go before scientists can say exactly what
those genes do.
