# Students call off endowment plan
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
Citing significant progress in negotiations
with University officials, students collecting
money for a socially responsible endowment
halted the collection of donations yesterday.
However, the matter has raised lingering
questions in many students' minds about
how responsive the administration is to stu
dent initiatives.
The impetus for forming the fund came
from student concern about Stanford invest
ments in companies that are not socially and
environmentally responsible. In recent
weeks about 1,000 signatures and $1,000
have been collected in an effort to display
student interest in the creation of such a
fund.
"We've accomplished something very im
portant; it's time to move on," said junior
Brian Babcock, who organized the campaign.
He added that the administration has
"made a reasonable response" to the groups'
demands. He cited the University's willing
ness to consider a resubmitted proposal for

such a fund and recent discussion of placing
the head of the student / faculty Advising
Panel on Investment Responsibility on the
board of the Board of Trustees' Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility.
According to an ASSU statement, placing
the head of the advisory panel on the SCIR
would enable student views to be more effec
tively communicated to the SCIR, which has
no student members.
The leaders who proposed the endowment
have, with the cooperation of the ASSU,
shifted the emphasis of their campaign.
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson said,
"We' ve accomplished as much good as we can
with social responsibility at the moment, so
we are now turning to the issue of student
representation: the way that [the adminis
tration] and the trustees deal with the stu
dent body."
Sophomore Ann Hummel, who was
involved in the campaign, emphasized the
need to address the administration's failure
to listen to students.
She said the creation of the fund
became "as much a question of the
credibility of the students them
selves" as it was about social re
sponsibility. Sophomore Cathy
Rion, another fund organizer,
echoed this sentiment saying, "The
general problem of student repre
sentation wasn't dealt with at all.
University President Gerhard
Casper's response showed the Uni
versity has a long way to go."
To address this issue, ASSU
leaders will be scheduling a series
of "Cookies and Tea" events open

to the entire student body to ex
press the views of student groups
to the administration. A twist on
Casper's "Tea and Cookies"
events, "Cookies and Tea" would
give "student groups a chance to
explain how we feel to the admin
istration," said Thompson.
Along with the fund, event orga
nizers suggested possible discus
sion topics including sorority hous
ing, Chicano Studies, creation of a
public service minor, increasing
the accessibility of campus facili
ties to the disabled and other stu
dent concerns.
Thompson said he hopes the
first "Cookies and Tea" will be held
within the next few weeks and is
currently confirming a date for the

event.
In the meantime, those involved
with the fund stress that they have
not given up. As Babcock said, "Ide
ally we would have liked the cre
ation of a separate fund, but that
may be something happening down
the road."
He emphasized that the "good
faith effort" on the part of the Uni
versity offers the chance for contin
ued discussion with the trustees
and administration on these is
sues.
Nonetheless, organizers of the
fund will be contacting everyone
who donated to the fund and ask
ing whether their donations could
be given to the Stanford Fund,
Thompson said.
