# Students call off endowment plan
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
Citing significant progress in negotiations
with University officials, students collecting
money for a socially responsible endowment
halted the collection of donations yesterday.
However, the matter has raised lingering
questions in many students' minds about
how responsive the administration is to stu
dent initiatives.
The impetus for forming the fund came
from student concern about Stanford invest
ments in companies that are not socially and
environmentally responsible. In recent
weeks about 1,000 signatures and $1,000
have been collected in an effort to display
student interest in the creation of such a
fund.
"We've accomplished something very im
portant; it's time to move on," said junior
Brian Babcock, who organized the campaign.
He added that the administration has
"made a reasonable response" to the groups'
demands. He cited the University's willing
ness to consider a resubmitted proposal for

such a fund and recent discussion of placing
the head of the student / faculty Advising
Panel on Investment Responsibility on the
board of the Board of Trustees' Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility.
According to an ASSU statement, placing
the head of the advisory panel on the SCIR
would enable student views to be more effec
tively communicated to the SCIR, which has
no student members.
The leaders who proposed the endowment
have, with the cooperation of the ASSU,
shifted the emphasis of their campaign.
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson said,
"We' ve accomplished as much good as we can
with social responsibility at the moment, so
we are now turning to the issue of student
representation: the way that [the adminis
tration] and the trustees deal with the stu
dent body."
Sophomore Ann Hummel, who was
involved in the campaign, emphasized the
need to address the administration's failure
to listen to students.
