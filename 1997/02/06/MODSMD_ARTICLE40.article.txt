# Lorca's dreamland exposed
## 
### Patrick Enright 
Imagine arriving at your dorm room in the fall and dis
covering that your two new roommates are Luis Bunuel,
who would later direct the famous surrealist film "Un
Chien Andalou," and Salvador I)a 11who would become
perhaps the most famous surrealist painter in the world.
Does the situation seem a bit daunting?
It's what faced Federico Garcia Lorca when he arrived at
the student residences in Madrid in 1919. Arguably the
greatest Spanish author of the 20th century, he would go
on to write 12 major plays with a variety of themes,

ranging from historical fiction to psychological
drama.

One of Lorca's most complex psychological
works is "Asi Que Pasen Cinco Anos" ("Once
Five Years Pass"), a "mystery play about time,

written in prose and verse," now presented by
the Underworld Opera Company at the

Mountain View Center for the Performing
Arts.

The production is a bilingual operatic
adaptation of Lorca's play, with an orig
inal score composed by Thomas S.
Dean and David Barrows.

Act I begins with an old and a
young man, standing on opposite
sides of the circular stage, facing
away from each other. As the stage

begins to rotate slowly, they start to
sing a dialogue about time and
memory.
Gradually, the audience comes
to realize that the old man ("Vieio"

in Spanish) is merely an aspect of
the young man's ("Joven" in Span
ish) psyche and that Joven's fear of
aging and death is personified by
Viejo. The following scenes of the

production depict Joven's rejection
hy his fiancee and his eventual de
scent into madness.

Dean, the composer and director
of "Asi," said he chose a play hy Lorca
because the author "affects me on a
subconscious level." Converting this
kind of deeply psychological drama
into a working opera was not easy. As
Barrow, the musical director and com

poser, explained, "This is definitely our

most ambitious project."
Part of the show's success comes from its
effective combination of Spanish and English
in a way that makes it accessible to all viewers,

The characters sing almost exclusively in Span
ish, while the spoken dialogue is in English.

"We weren't really happy with the translation, so
we set it in Spanish as much as we could," Dean said.
At the same time, Barrows added, "we wanted to
reach the English-speaking audience."

As the plot unfolds, we find out that Joven, played by Jo
Vincent Parks, has asked his 15-year-old fiancee, Novia, to
wait five years before they marry.
Viejo, played by Richard Mix, empathizes with Joven's
concerns about the decaying effects of time but applauds
his decision to wait on his marriage. Joven says he needs to
distance himself from Novia to "focus her in [his] heart."
Meanwhile, the youthful aspects of his psyche enter into
the scene in the forms of Amigo 1 (lan Kirk) and Amigo 2

in hybrid play-opera
(Denise Fraga). They try to convince him to seize the pre
sent, to live in the now, arguing with Viejo.
"The past is past," says Viejo.
"Yes," says Amigo I, "but it is passing right now."
In Act 11, J oven returns five years later to meet his fi
ancee, played by
Heat h e r

M i c h e Ie
Meyer, only to
find that she no longer loves him. She has fallen in love with
a virile football player and finds Joven oppressively atten
tive.
The loss of his idealized love throws Joven into depres

sion, and with the sinister figures of the harlequin, played
by Cynthia laylor, and the clown taunting him, he de
scends into insanity.
The music is excellent, providing the perfect hack
ground for Lorca's emotionally laden words. As Joven and
Viejo talk of an approaching storm, for example, we hear a
rumble in the distance, gradually growing closer and
heightening the tension.
The most striking aria of the opera is the harlequin s
solo about time and dreams, in which a gypsy-like vocal
melody is beautifully counterbalanced by a macabre and
tense orchestral piece.

Among the artistic strengths of the show is a di
alogue between a dead hoy and a dead cat as they
come alive in the landscape of the young man's

disturbed mind. The two bizarre characters are
represented by large cloth puppets with papi
er-mache heads, manipulated by puppeteers
dressed completely in black.

Their voices are provided backstage
by Cynthia Taylor and Denise Fraga as
they sing a melancholy duet about their
own premature deaths. The orchestra
alternates between free Latin jazz and
the kind of nostalgic 1940s swinti

typical of Woody Allen films.
The music evokes an incongru
ously joyful mood, a poignant
complement to their discussion of
death.

The overall effect is engross
ing; the viewer is forced to make
the effort of visually separating
the puppets from the puppeteers
as they float and fly around the
stage and almost into the audi
ence.

Both cat and boy are finally
pulled to their inevitable doom
by a huge styrofoam hand, mak
ing the strangeness of the scene
even more pronounced. Yet

somehow the physical grotesque
ness perfectly underscores the un
canny mood of this scene, making
it work.
Overall, Korea's play is a fascinat-

ing chronicle of an individual's inter
nal struggle, and this adaptation suc
cessfully brings his vision to life.
It is a pessimistic view of the world, in

which time is the final arbiter and in which,
as the harlequin remarks, "Only the wind re
mains."
