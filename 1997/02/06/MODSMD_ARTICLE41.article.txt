# WOULD YOU TRUST THE LOGIC OF A HALF-SIZED THERMOCAPSULARY DEHOUSING ASSISTER?!

### Laura Shin 
If you didn't see the 20th anniversary "Star Wars: Special Edition" rerelease this past weekend,
were you stuck in a trash compactor or something?
Maybe you were one of the 10 people in La Maison who didn't take advantage of the 30
tickets purchased for the house (with 41 residents total). Or maybe you live in Twain, where demand
was greater than supply, and you couldn't get a ticket.
Or maybe you're one of those that has never seen Chewbacca when he roars, never heard Darth
Vader's asthmatic respiratory system and never wanted to tell Luke to shut up when he whines.
"I figure if you haven't seen 'Star Wars,' at this point, you're making an effort not to see it," said ju
nior Adam Susman.
Indeed, the pervasiveness of this movie is the reason that freshman Jon Stemmle has seen the
movie about 20 times, even though he claims not to be a "Star Wars" fanatic. He doesn't "conscious
ly seek it out," he said. "It's always just playing at friends' houses."
At the other extreme is freshman Al Ponce, who trooped along with 55 Stanford Band members
to see the movie that, as Susman said, "defines our generation." Ponce sees "Star Wars" every chance
he gets. "Every time it's on TV I watch it,"he said.
But this weekend the Force was with Ponce and other Stanford students even more, well, force
fully than is possible on television or even in the original film, for that matter. The Force came to
them with the best in computer graphics and digitized sound.
The Force was even omnipotent enough to bring in cash for some of them.
Senior Dan Arai went to wait in line for seats six hours in advance of the show, and another view
er who wanted his spot in line offered him $20 for it. When he and the rest of the Haus Mitteleuropa
moviegoers actually were in the theater, three people in the row behind them received $100 in ex
change for their seats.
Is this financially frivolous frenzy over a galaxy far, far away ridiculous? Perhaps.

But as senior Matt Schnitz put it: "It's a culture thing."
And that statement encapsulates the reason for Arai's willingness to wait six hours for good seats. "I'm not a big 'Star Wars' fan," Arai said. "But I'm a big fan of
opening night."
Senior Jon Logan, who worked at Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects company George Lucas created specifically to realize "Star Wars," has even more
to say about the film's cultural significance.
"It's a cultural icon that refuses to die," he said. Logan is writing a research paper on a topic related to "Star Wars," and said that Lucas "refuses to let it be an
anachronism."
By updating the film so that its special effects reflect the best technology available 20 years after the original filming, Lucas ensures that it will always "remain in
its time" and "will continue to compete with other films | rather than | being surpassed by things like 'Jurassic Park,' " according to Logan.
Lucas, in a speech that Logan attended, said, Films are never finished. They're just abandoned.' Due to budget, time and technological constraints, a filmmaker
is never quite content with the final product, because it usually does not embody all that the film-maker envisioned for the film.
Accordingly, Lucas has felt dissatisfied with Star Wars for 20 years because he did not have the wherewithal to make it exactly as he wished. Hence the "Special
Edition."
Logan expects this re-release of the first of the intelligent blockbusters" to have as large an influence on the children who are viewing it now for the first time as
it did on "our generation."
1 hat may well be true. Susman observed that most of his fellow filmgoers on Friday were younger than he and his friends — excluding parents, of course. "I think
a lot of the audience was not alive when it first came out," he said.
Logan believes that for children today, Star Wars will have a greater impact than movies like "Independence Day," which have flimsy plots and consist only of
special effects. Star Wars was the first overblown special effects movie, but Logan thinks that subsequent Flollywood special effects films have been lacking in
content.
Susman expressed the same sentiment. As an English major, he appreciates the fact that "it's the only modern version of the hero cycle today." Susman said that
in the first movie, Luke Skywalker accomplishes physical feats and gains maturity, whereas in "Empire Strikes Back," he fights himself as much as he fights outside

forces and undergoes "spiritual development."
He described Skywalker as "what a man should be — funny, brave, cool. . . and (he should| have a big animal to hang
out with all the time."
Aside from character development, Logan noted "Star Wars" is a landmark itself, describing it as "the first completely
new world completed on film successfully." Since Lucas had the go-ahead to make all three parts of the trilogy, the series
epitomizes "a filmmaker's passion — for the first and last time — [to work) free of the studio's grubby hands."
Today, although sequels do further the storyline and have the potential to be made into trilogies, Logan said they are
often produced only for profit in the wake of the first movie's success.
Not only does Logan believe "Star Wars" has the distinction of being the only completely imagined world depicted on
the big screen, but he also is certain that it is the first movie epic to be reissued "cleaner, clearer and better," frame-by-frame.
But the average audience member may be unaware of the meticulous process used to spiff up this cinematic saber.
Reactions of Stanford students who have seen the movie are mostly responses to the storyline or childhood reminis
cences of the first time they became acquainted with droids.
Junior Erin Thompson, social manager of the Band, recalled that in second grade she played the part of R2We2 in a tal
ent show skit titled "Return of the Jerks." Luke Skydiver, Princess Laze-around and Han Sandwich rounded out the cast of
characters.
Susman spoke with reverence of the Force. It was apparently with him in the form of a rental video when a policeman
pulled him over for speeding a few years ago. When the policeman asked to see Susman's identification, Susman replied,
"You don't need to see my ID," a line taken from the "Star Wars" scene in which Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi first enter Mos
Eisley and are accosted by guards of the Empire.
The policeman's "huh?" hyper-sped into comprehension when Susman continued, "I'm not the droid you're looking
for." Eyeing the video on the seat next to Susman, the officer smiled and said, "Aw, get out of here."
Not only does love for "Star Wars" soften differences between people, but it also inspires people to attempt what is al
most unthinkable. When Logan was 12 years old, he phoned Industrial Light and Magic and asked if they had internships.

Although he was "crushed" then to learn that interns had to be of college age, he has since been able
to live out that dream.
Last summer he worked at ILM, but even within the company information about the trilogy's re
release was top-secret. Only those working on it knew about the changes being made because, as
Logan speculated, Lucas "wanted to make as explosive a debut as he could."
Indeed, the concept of reworking an entire movie is quintessentially post-modern, according to
Logan. Although filmmakers now have the option of taking something from the past and bringing it
into the present because of advances in technology, this is the first large-scale undertaking of such
technological improvement.
Logan cites a recent commercial of Fred Astaire dancing with a Dustbuster in his hand as an ex
ample of what computer graphics now enable filmmakers to do. Dead people can pitch products and
act in movies; witness President John F. Kennedy's performance in "Forrest Gump."
Just as technology allows the past to enter our present, our past viewings of the movie color our
experience of the present. "Since we knew Luke and Leia were brother and sister, the whole roman
tic thing in the first movie just takes on a whole new light," said senior Andy Leming.
Although re-viewing "Star Wars" on the big screen is a revision of the viewing experience, it is
more importantly a symbol of the wide influence it has had in the lives of everyone growing up in the
past 20 years.
Band member Stemmle told of a friend who flew down to Los Angeles Thursday morning to see
the movie's opening in Newport Beach "because they have a huge screen down there."
And truly, most students' main reason for seeing it is to have the "big screen" experience — to ex
perience it as big as it has actually figured in most of their lives.

If you didn't see the 20th anniversary "Star Wars: Special Edition" rerelease this past weekend,
were you stuck in a trash compactor or something?
Maybe you were one of the 10 people in La Maison who didn't take advantage of the 30
tickets purchased for the house (with 41 residents total). Or maybe you live in Twain, where demand
was greater than supply, and you couldn't get a ticket.
Or maybe you're one of those that has never seen Chewbacca when he roars, never heard Darth
Vader's asthmatic respiratory system and never wanted to tell Luke to shut up when he whines.
"I figure if you haven't seen 'Star Wars,' at this point, you're making an effort not to see it," said ju
nior Adam Susman.
Indeed, the pervasiveness of this movie is the reason that freshman Jon Stemmle has seen the
movie about 20 times, even though he claims not to be a "Star Wars" fanatic. He doesn't "conscious
ly seek it out," he said. "It's always just playing at friends' houses."
At the other extreme is freshman Al Ponce, who trooped along with 55 Stanford Band members
to see the movie that, as Susman said, "defines our generation." Ponce sees "Star Wars" every chance
he gets. "Every time it's on TV I watch it,"he said.
But this weekend the Force was with Ponce and other Stanford students even more, well, force
fully than is possible on television or even in the original film, for that matter. The Force came to
them with the best in computer graphics and digitized sound.
The Force was even omnipotent enough to bring in cash for some of them.
Senior Dan Arai went to wait in line for seats six hours in advance of the show, and another view
er who wanted his spot in line offered him $20 for it. When he and the rest of the Haus Mitteleuropa
moviegoers actually were in the theater, three people in the row behind them received $100 in ex
change for their seats.
Is this financially frivolous frenzy over a galaxy far, far away ridiculous? Perhaps.

But as senior Matt Schnitz put it: "It's a culture thing."
And that statement encapsulates the reason for Arai's willingness to wait six hours for good seats. "I'm not a big 'Star Wars' fan," Arai said. "But I'm a big fan of
opening night."
Senior Jon Logan, who worked at Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects company George Lucas created specifically to realize "Star Wars," has even more
to say about the film's cultural significance.
"It's a cultural icon that refuses to die," he said. Logan is writing a research paper on a topic related to "Star Wars," and said that Lucas "refuses to let it be an
anachronism."
By updating the film so that its special effects reflect the best technology available 20 years after the original filming, Lucas ensures that it will always "remain in
its time" and "will continue to compete with other films | rather than | being surpassed by things like 'Jurassic Park,' " according to Logan.
Lucas, in a speech that Logan attended, said, Films are never finished. They're just abandoned.' Due to budget, time and technological constraints, a filmmaker
is never quite content with the final product, because it usually does not embody all that the film-maker envisioned for the film.
Accordingly, Lucas has felt dissatisfied with Star Wars for 20 years because he did not have the wherewithal to make it exactly as he wished. Hence the "Special
Edition."
Logan expects this re-release of the first of the intelligent blockbusters" to have as large an influence on the children who are viewing it now for the first time as
it did on "our generation."
1 hat may well be true. Susman observed that most of his fellow filmgoers on Friday were younger than he and his friends — excluding parents, of course. "I think
a lot of the audience was not alive when it first came out," he said.
Logan believes that for children today, Star Wars will have a greater impact than movies like "Independence Day," which have flimsy plots and consist only of
special effects. Star Wars was the first overblown special effects movie, but Logan thinks that subsequent Flollywood special effects films have been lacking in
content.
Susman expressed the same sentiment. As an English major, he appreciates the fact that "it's the only modern version of the hero cycle today." Susman said that
in the first movie, Luke Skywalker accomplishes physical feats and gains maturity, whereas in "Empire Strikes Back," he fights himself as much as he fights outside

forces and undergoes "spiritual development."
He described Skywalker as "what a man should be — funny, brave, cool. . . and (he should| have a big animal to hang
out with all the time."
Aside from character development, Logan noted "Star Wars" is a landmark itself, describing it as "the first completely
new world completed on film successfully." Since Lucas had the go-ahead to make all three parts of the trilogy, the series
epitomizes "a filmmaker's passion — for the first and last time — [to work) free of the studio's grubby hands."
Today, although sequels do further the storyline and have the potential to be made into trilogies, Logan said they are
often produced only for profit in the wake of the first movie's success.
Not only does Logan believe "Star Wars" has the distinction of being the only completely imagined world depicted on
the big screen, but he also is certain that it is the first movie epic to be reissued "cleaner, clearer and better," frame-by-frame.
But the average audience member may be unaware of the meticulous process used to spiff up this cinematic saber.
Reactions of Stanford students who have seen the movie are mostly responses to the storyline or childhood reminis
cences of the first time they became acquainted with droids.
Junior Erin Thompson, social manager of the Band, recalled that in second grade she played the part of R2We2 in a tal
ent show skit titled "Return of the Jerks." Luke Skydiver, Princess Laze-around and Han Sandwich rounded out the cast of
characters.
Susman spoke with reverence of the Force. It was apparently with him in the form of a rental video when a policeman
pulled him over for speeding a few years ago. When the policeman asked to see Susman's identification, Susman replied,
"You don't need to see my ID," a line taken from the "Star Wars" scene in which Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi first enter Mos
Eisley and are accosted by guards of the Empire.
The policeman's "huh?" hyper-sped into comprehension when Susman continued, "I'm not the droid you're looking
for." Eyeing the video on the seat next to Susman, the officer smiled and said, "Aw, get out of here."
Not only does love for "Star Wars" soften differences between people, but it also inspires people to attempt what is al
most unthinkable. When Logan was 12 years old, he phoned Industrial Light and Magic and asked if they had internships.

Although he was "crushed" then to learn that interns had to be of college age, he has since been able
to live out that dream.
Last summer he worked at ILM, but even within the company information about the trilogy's re
release was top-secret. Only those working on it knew about the changes being made because, as
Logan speculated, Lucas "wanted to make as explosive a debut as he could."
Indeed, the concept of reworking an entire movie is quintessentially post-modern, according to
Logan. Although filmmakers now have the option of taking something from the past and bringing it
into the present because of advances in technology, this is the first large-scale undertaking of such
technological improvement.
Logan cites a recent commercial of Fred Astaire dancing with a Dustbuster in his hand as an ex
ample of what computer graphics now enable filmmakers to do. Dead people can pitch products and
act in movies; witness President John F. Kennedy's performance in "Forrest Gump."
Just as technology allows the past to enter our present, our past viewings of the movie color our
experience of the present. "Since we knew Luke and Leia were brother and sister, the whole roman
tic thing in the first movie just takes on a whole new light," said senior Andy Leming.
Although re-viewing "Star Wars" on the big screen is a revision of the viewing experience, it is
more importantly a symbol of the wide influence it has had in the lives of everyone growing up in the
past 20 years.
Band member Stemmle told of a friend who flew down to Los Angeles Thursday morning to see
the movie's opening in Newport Beach "because they have a huge screen down there."

perience it as big as it has actually figured in most of their lives.
