## Built To Spill "Perfect From Now On" 
### 
Will someone please explain to me why a
person with such excellent pop instincts like
Doug Martsch would keep such strange mu
sical company?
After parting ways with Scattle-via-Idaho
grunge / power-popsters Treepeople in
1993, Martsch formed Built To Spill with a
revolving lineup of conspirators based most
ly on whoever happened to be around at the
time. BTS' first album, "Ultimate Alterna
tive Wavers" (C/Z Records), was a gloriously
sprawling mess of distorted guitars and
goofy noise spasms.
A kinder, gentler Built To Spill appeared
on their 1994 release "There's Nothing
Wrong With Love" (Up Records). BTS' new
clean, jangly pop sound was the perfect com
plement to Martsch's unique high-pitched
yelp. Capturing all the glee and wonder of
childhood, "There's Nothing Wrong With
Love" quickly became a favorite in the Pacif
ic Northwest's indie-pop scene.
Martsch's collaboration with damaged
psychedelic grunge outfit Caustic Resin re
sulted in the aptly titled album, "Built To
Spill Caustic Resin" (Up Records) in 1995.
On it, Martsch had begun to break away
from short, bouncy pop songs, returning to
the slower, thicker jams that marked "Ulti
mate Alternative Wavers."
Built To Spill's latest release, "Perfect

From Now On" (Warner Bros. Records),
continues where the 1995 album left off.
"Perfect" features only songs, but it's more
than 50 minutes in length.
Martsch, while still writing pretty
melodies, allows Caustic Resin guitarist
Brett Netson to expand his spacy guitar
squall. It gives BTS' music an epic, shimmery
quality, but it also runs the risk of being real
ly boring.
Most of the songs on "Perfect" are slow
and languorous, letting the guitars set the
pace with mixed results ("Randy Describes
Eternity" seems just that, while the orches
tral "Velvet Walt/." is 8 1/2 minutes of pure
dreaminess).
Ex-Spinanes drummer Scott Plouf's tal
ents don't go entirely wasted, however;
"Made-Up Dreams" and "Untrustable / Part
2 (about someone else)" lurch and sway
beautifully, and "Stop The Show" slowly
builds to a fever pitch that jumps right into a
classic BTS bounce.
"Perfect From Now On" is a bit of a mis
leading title, since Built To Spill takes its time
letting the songs unwind, trying lots of dif
ferent things along the way. It's easy to get
impatient with the pace of the album, espe
cially for fans of "There's Nothing Wrong
With Love," hut Martsch manages to keep
things interesting with slowly morphinggui

tar lines and lots ol changes. Perhaps some
day Martsch will take this album's title to
heart and write the perfect pop record that

"There's Nothing Wrong With Love" proved
was in him.

Built To Spill is perfect from now on: Just cut along the dotted line.
