# Fine Young Cannibals
## "The Finest" 
### 
1997 would seem like an odd year for a greatest hits album from the
Fine Young Cannibals, considering that the group only put out two real al
bums, both in the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the group has just released
"The Finest," a summary of its career.
Emerging from the break-up of a ska band, the English Beat, former
members Andy Cox and David Steele recruited singer Roland Gift to com
plete the trio. Despite its lack of longevity, the group's output is still strong
enough to support a greatest hits album.
The group's techno-pop sound easily stretched beyond the limitsof that
genre. From the rock and roll drive of "Don't Look Back" to the Motown
swing of "Good Thing," the Fine Young Cannibals clearly understood the
history of pop music, using technology more as a flavor than a style.
"The Finest" does an admirable job of displaying the full range of the
group's roots. Naturally, the group's hits, "She Drives Me Crazy" and
"Good Thing" sound as powerful as ever, but the album's strengths lies in
its hidden treasures. Every song packs a great hook.
The pop jazz of "Johnny Come Home," the playful soul of "Tell Me
What" and the modern funk of "I'm Not The Man 1 Used To Be" are all
testaments to the group's ability to succeed by varying the aural texture of
their music. Moreover, although the Fine Young Cannibals pick and
choose from multiple genres, their devotion is always sincere; the music
never suffers.
While the instrumental ability of the group never demands much at
tention, Gift's singing is itself a curiosity. Distinctly aware of his own lack
of range, as well as the quite simply weird timbre of his voice, Gift has
somehow become a great bad singer.
On tracks such as "Blue" and "Ever Fallen In Love," Gift's vocals blur
together to the point that they serve as rhythmic counterpoint to the
music itself.
One of the most imaginative groups of the '80s, the Fine Young Canni
bals are well-represented by "The Finest," a diverse and tuneful record of
its brief existence.
