# Skank Down Under
## a
						compilation 
### 
Many people probably think of Australia in terms
of Foster's beer commercials or the "Crocodile
Dundee" movies: "real" men and large crocodiles.
Moon Ska Records has decided to provide another
perspective. To that end, the New York-based ska label
recently released "Skank Down Under," a collection of
songs from what they term "Australia's and New
Zealand's best ska bands."
Consisting of two songs each by seven different
bands, this compilation showcases a variety of differ
ent styles of ska, from The Porkers' aggressively surf
punky "Catboard" to Idle Hands Collective's slower,
more traditional "Coffee & Cream." The latter track is
by far the best song on the album, combining melod
ic vocal harmonies with a catchy horn line. Coinci
dentally, Idle Hands Collective also provides the worst
track, "1 Can't Explain," a long-winded and musically
repetitive love song.
Having released a full-length album ("Grunt!") on
Moon Ska in 1995, The Porkers are not exactly new
comers to the ska world. However, while their alco
hol-drenched, surf-ska style was amusing on
"Grunt!" their two contributions to this compilation
("Catboard" and "1 Can't Get Laid in the USA") are
full of infantile sexuality and blatant Beach Boys
ripoffs.
All is not lost, however, since bands like Dr. Raju,
Loin Groin, Skazoo and Skapa turn in solid, albeit not
particularly impressive performances. Dr. Raju's
"There Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" is remi
niscent of 1950s Bill Haley rock, and Skazoo's "Crazy
People" is a manic commentary on modern society.
Both Loin Groin's "Help Yourself" and Skapa's "You
Know" are mildly catchy tunes, although formulaic.
The Offbeats turn in the least interesting overall

performance of the album with "Suit" and "When
The Party's Over," two uninspired and dark-sounding
tracks which recall The Specials' "Ghost Town" but
without the nifty sirens.
On the whole, this compilation is unsatisfying —
the outstanding songs are outstanding primarily be
cause they are juxtaposed with rather mediocre ones.
One leaves with the impression that if this is the best
Australia and New Zealand have to offer, perhaps they
should stick to beer and crocodiles.
