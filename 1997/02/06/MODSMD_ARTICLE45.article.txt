# Special Edition
## The 						Soundtrack 
### 
Star Wars: A New Hope
"Star Wars" was bred for the big screen,
and anyone who didn't see this cinema classic
last weekend may be a complete loser.
Yet underneath the allure, the excite
ment and all of the new friends you met at
the theater is a collection of humble ditties
that defined a generation. "Star Wars: A
New Hope" brings the electricity back,
recreating the genesis of a modern musical
renaissance.
Instead of heading to the silver screen
last Friday night, I decided to take some
select invitees to my secret pad under
neath Hoover. It's an abandoned nuclear
bomb shelter, long forgotten after the
(lold War.
Unfortunately, the $24,000 VCR that was
sitting around chewed up the tape before the
opening credits were over. So now the pres
sure was really on: Could my soundtrack
alone recreate the excitement of this 20-year
old classic?
After all, "Star Wars: A New 1 lope" is a col
lectors' item, a limited edition double-CD set
that resurrects the magic of John Williams and
the London Symphony Orchestra from 1977.
Digitally remastered and reworked, the

soundtrack blasts with a frenzy that is barely
believable for something created in the 19705.
In addition to the original Oscar-winning
film score, this new soundtrack includes pre
viously unreleased orchestral music. The ef
fect is that the soundtrack parallels the action
of the movie more closely, providing listeners
with a richer audio experience. New tracks
include "The Moisture Farm," which accom
panies the sand crawlers' return to the house
of Owen and Beru Lars, "Tales of a Jedi
Knight" and a series of takes on the main
theme.
Die-hards may also enjoy the quirky ex
pansions and reworkings that have been
added to accommodate "Star Wars: Special
Edition." Han Solo's encounter with Jabba the
Hutt, for example, is accompanied by
changes in "Millennium Falcon."
Strangely, our aural experience was ac
companied by some violent shaking, and 1
think 1 heard sirens and screaming upstairs.
Perhaps the stereo system was just too good.
And the d00r... barricaded for some reason
after our listening.
It seems as though everyone has heard
about this soundtrack thing going on in
"the shelter" because some very important
Cabinet members have recently moved in.

And the funniest thing is that they refuse to
leave, curiously stashing food and con
stantly making calls to the Pentagon. Oh
well, perhaps stupendous music can drive
even the most rational souls to craziness!

For now, I'll continue to enjoy this power
ful musical statement of yester-decade, a
way for me to escape life's little, unexpected
stresses.
