Star Wars: Special Edition
A long time ago — well, 20 years ago to be precise — people
walked out of movie theaters completely mind-boggled, bear
ing visions of X-wing fighters, lightsabers and droids. They had

just seen "Star Wars," a film of epic proportions that became a
box-office smash and gained a massive cult following.
While "Star Wars: Special Edition" doesn't exactly have that
effect today, it certainly satisfies the hunger for the big screen
that fans have been building up since the movie's re-release in

the 1980s. With a few more special effects thrown in, thi«> new
version can size up to recent blockbusters like "Jurassic Park
and "Independence Day."
Just what makes this "Special Edition" so great? Well, people
are sure to be impressed by the new scenes, which include com
puter-generated dewbacks and womprats wandering around
Tatooine, a completely revitalized Mos Kisley spaceport and
some enhanced shots of spaceships.
Some of the best scenes are retouched versions of the old
ones. 1 was amazed to see how well the monstrous new creatures
blend into the background as l.uke Skywalker and Obi-Wan
Kenobi talk to the storm troopers in Mos Eisley. The improved
explosions of Alderaan and the Death Star are also excellent.
Viewers will also enjoy the scenes added from the "director s
cut" of the original film. These include the computer-en
hanced scene with Jabba the Hutt and Boba Fett that everyone's
been talking about. I was glad to see a scene with Lukes old
friend, Biggs, which fits in smoothly and aids character devel
opment.
Perhaps the best part of the "Special Edition" experience is
seeing audiences react to the movie just as they did 20 years ago.
You hear laughter when R2D2 is electrocuted and when a
stormtrooper bangs his head on a door. Women cheer when
Princess Leia announces that she's taking charge over I fan Solo,
lust seeing people coming to a movie dressed like a Jedi or a Sith
Lord is a trip.
Let me finish with some advice for "Star Wars" fans of all le\
els: If you're a "Star Wars" super-freak who can translate the
lawa language, look out for Dash Rendar's Outrider in Mos Lis
ley. If you're a casual fan like myself, just watch the movie about
a dozen times for old times' sake.
And if you've never seen "Star Wars" before and are wonder
ing who the hell Darth Vader is, you'd better get yourself over to
aTHX-equipped theater soon. You're missing a triumph in film
history.
