## Some Mother's Son 
### 
It's a good thing this is February. If this film had come out around Mother's Day, there's
no doubt that mothers everywhere would be reminded of the pain rather than the joys of
motherhood.
"Some Mother's Son" recounts the true, late-70s story of Northern Ireland mother
Kathleen Quigley (Helen Mirren) in her physical and emotional struggle to deal with the
imprisonment of her son, Gerard, a member of the Irish Republican Army.
The trouble starts when Kathleen lets Gerard borrow her car to "buy shoes." Her only
request is that he give her a ride to the Catholic school where she is a teacher. When a near
by bombing of British soldiers shuts the school down for the day, she has no idea that Ger
ard used her car to drive the bombers to the site.
When he and his "comrade" Frank Higgins are arrested, Gerard shoots a British guard
and is convicted for attempted murder. Kathleen insists that Gerard cooperate with the
British legal system by accepting legal representation and a plea bargain to reduce his sen
tence. But Gerard follows his IRA comrades in refusing counsel, proclaiming that he is not
a criminal but a prisoner of war.
As Gerard and the other convicted IRA members resist their criminal status by refusing

to cut their hair or wear prison uniforms, Kathleen resists the pleas of Frank's mother,
Annie, to cooperate with the IRA. Refusing to be used to promote violence, Kathleen tries
to convince Annie of the senseless violence that has become part of their daily lives.
But when one of the members goes on a hunger strike, Kathleen is forced to choose be
tween accepting the rules that treat her son like a terrorist and attempting to gain his rights
in the most peaceful way possible. She must learn to deal with the militant heads of both
the British government in Northern Ireland and the IRA.
Kathleen is a paragon of motherhood — loving, good-natured and intelligent. From
the moment we first see her, Mirren (PBS's "Prime Suspect" and"The Madness of King
George") plays Kathleen with gentle strength. She simultaneously points out Kathleen's
imperfections as a citizen in a troubled nation as well as her personal struggle to help her
son.
With Mirren in the lead, "Some Mother's Son" is a compassionate but never self-pity
ing look at the destruction and havoc that greed, power and stubbornness have wreaked
in the lives of families in Northern Ireland.
