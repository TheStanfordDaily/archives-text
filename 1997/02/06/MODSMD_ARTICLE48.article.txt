If you can shift your attention away from your
microwave popcorn for long enough, you might
discover that what's on the screen can actually sat
isfy your appetite in various ways. Check out these
videos in which food is more than a cinematic in
gredient, but a metaphor for love and death.

Meals in "Babette's Feast" are a guaranteed
method to bring together family and friends. Win
ner of an Academy Award for best foreign film in
1987, this Danish-French film is a gentle, absorbing
tale set in the 1800s about two elderly sisters who
have just about given up their chances for love. Enter
Babette, a political refugee from Paris, who has more
tricks up her sleeve than just astounding recipes.
"Eat Drink Man Woman" (1994), Ang Lee's film
about the relationships between a master chef and
his three daughters, elevates food beyond the role

of physical sustenance. Set in urban present-day Taipei,
few of the values in the Chu household are traditional,
save for the status of food as the embodiment of comfort,
imprisonment and love. "Eat Drink Man Woman" — four
essentials in a relationship as delicately balanced as ying
and yang — requires a warning: Do not watch on an
empty stomach.

"I ike Water for Chocolate" (1993), a film by Alphon
so Aran, is based on the delicious novel by Laura Esquiv
el. A young woman named Tita is forbidden to marry her
lover because her mother wants her to take care of the
household. In a sensual form of revenge, Tita transmits
all her repression and sexual energy into cooking. Her

dishes, including
fowl with rose
petal sauce, literal
ly cause people to
swoon.

Food can be a surefire source of humor, as in the Japan
ese film "Tampopo" (1986). The central plot involves a
pair of truck drivers who help a widow restore her noodle
shop through uncovering the secrets of the perfect broth
and three-minute noodles. But there are also side plots in
this film that are essentially comedy sketches; the best in
volves a gangster and his moll. Watch for raw eggs and
oysters as food fetishes.
"Delicatessen" (1991) is a wildly bizarre film by French
directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. The setting is
a post-apocalyptic world where meat-eaters reign and
subversive vegetarians (a.k.a. "Troglodistes") live under
ground. Amid visual gags galore, a mysterious ex-circus
performer comes to live in a boarding house above a
butcher's shop. He and the butcher's shy daughter become
attracted to one another, much to the displeasure of her
cleaver-wielding father.
And finally, the film that takes the cake when it comes to

lust and gluttony: "The
Cook, the Thief, His Wife,
and Her Lover" (1989), a
typically horrific and vi
sually lush film by Peter
Greenaway. Every night,
the crude Thief and his
wife dine in a French
restaurant called Spica's.
Abetted by the Cook, the
Wife slips off in the mid
dle of dinner to consort
with her lover, a mild,
balding bookseller. For a
man who loves food as
much as the Thief, his
wife plans a kind of re
venge that is guaranteed
to make his (and your)
stomach turn.
