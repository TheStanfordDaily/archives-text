## Smack in the Bookstore 
### Nkomo Morris 
I am not a "Star Wars" fan. I don't know one
"Star Wars" movie from another, and I refuse
to sit through them. But even I was excited to
find out about the release of the new, remas
tered, fancy-schmancy version of the old trilo
gy. Not excited enough to go wait on line to see
it, but excited enough. I don't watch much tele
vision, so the first I heard of the re-release was
on the second floor of the Bookstore.
Surrounded aurally by the soundtrack for
"Trainspotting" and visually by Stanford and
Clinique paraphernalia, I was just about to
begin a tirade about the rampant capitalism
of the Bookstore when 1 noticed a section
dedicated to "Star Wars."
Little "Star Wars" dangly things were

hanging off of a television screen playing the
movie over and over, and the television was
flanked on all sides with little figurines of
Darth Vader, R21)2 and C3PO. Then the real
ization hit me. The shameless product en
dorsement isn't about the products. It's
about self-renewal and mental growth. Pret
ty addictive stuff.
Obsessing about "Star Wars" is like doing
heroin or trying really hard to have clear skin.
Once you've started, its hard to stop. Clearly,
someone in Bookstore management has
been hooked.
I'm not surprised. The "Star Wars" trilogy
was specifically created to be a life-changing
movie. George Lucas wrote the film with the

help of Joseph Campbell, a world lore histo
rian. Campbell had a theory that all myths
follow a general plot line. It's pretty simple.
Life is boring. Then something bad comes
up, and the future hero gets called upon to
right the wrong.
However, the hero does not take the op
portunity to right the wrong. Either he
doesn't feel up to the challenge or he just
doesn't want to bother. Then the hero either
realizes that he must take the challenge, or
others force the hero to take the challenge.
Aided by a supernatural power that a kind
old woman, dwarf or god teaches the hero to
use, the hero trains to do battle. There are tri
als and tribulations. The hero seems to die.

Hut no! He arises, a little scathed, wins the
battle and moves to another realm of con
sciousness. Credits roll.
Sound familiar? It should, jesus, Mo
hammed, Buddha and Renton from
"Trainspotting" also went through it. And
Indiana Jones. They're all pretty popular. I
sense a pattern.
The Bookstore is our old woman, troll and
god. It leads us toward "Star Wars," Clinique
and "Trainspotting" so we can battle the
rough world. I bet that if Somebody did a re
mastered version of the Bible, we would have
a display dedicated to it in the Bookstore.
It's a wonderful place to be. And each time
1 leave, I feel like I have completed a journey.
