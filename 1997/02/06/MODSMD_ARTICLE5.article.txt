# Early decision complete
## Regular decisions applicants by more than 500 
### David Gamage 
The admissions office has finalized all of
its early decision acceptances for the Class
of 2001.
Stanford offered admission to a total of
607 early decision applicants this year, an
increase of 8 percent over the 563 applicants
accepted last year from the early decision
pool. With more students admitted under
the early decision process, the Admissions
Office accepts "the competition among the
regular decision applicants to be especially
keen," Dean of Admission and Financial
Aids James Montoya said.
Stanford has also seen an increased num
ber of regular deadline applicants to 16,880
from last year's 16,359. Montoya his office
"was surprised by the increased number of
applicants. With the current trend toward
more students applying by early decision at
selective institutions, the expectation was
that Stanford would receive fewer appli
cants."
While exact statistics are not yet avail
able, Montoya speculated that the number
of applicants to selective East Coast institu
tions may have declined this year. If true,
these statistics could indicate a tend toward
more students seeking admission to Stan
ford over its Eastern competitors.
Stanford admitted 18 percent of its early

decision applicants this
year, compared to its 16-
percent general acceptance
rate. While these figures
might indicate a preference
toward high school stu
dents who apply for early
decision, Montoya said the
difference "is not very dra
matic. "
In a pamphlet mailed to

high schools, the Admissions Office explains
its official position, saying, "It is hard to
measure whether that difference is a result
of stronger applicants applying early or the
slight preference given to very strong appli
cants who are ready to commit to Stanford."
Stanford often refuses admission to can
didates unless they have a good chance of
being admitted in the regular decision
process," Montoya said This is in contrast
to other selective universities.
" Harvard defers a majority of its early de
cision candidates," Montoya said.
Stanford deferred 15 percent of its early
decision applicant- this year, and Montoya
said the Admissions Office "would like to
deny more in the future, in order to raise the
percentage of deferrals who are offered ac
ceptance in the regular decision process."
