# Dancing, history and heritage: Zoot Suit Week at Zapata
## 
### Rito Trevino Contributing writer 
For the last four days, the
residents of Casa Zapata in
Stern Hall have been breaking
away from the mad struggles of
Stanford's midterm season and
immersing themselves 50 years
in the past.
The Chicano / Latino theme
dorm has been celebrating Zoot
Suit Week, a series of events em
phasizing cultural awareness
which culminate in a party and
dance on Saturday evening.
Zoot Suit Week is a study of
Pachuquismo, an urban subcul
ture which developed in the
southwestern United States
during the late 1930s and early
19405. The Pachucos were sec
ond or third generation Chi
canos who found themselves
caught between their Mexican
heritage and their predomi
nantly-Anglo environment.
"This is an historical era
which is largely left unspoken
for," said Valentina del Olmo,
the Zapata head academic asso
ciate, who has done extensive
research on the Pachucos.
History has often portrayed
the Pachucos negatively, stereo
typing them as violent hood
lums and gangsters. However,

they are also regarded as the
first Chicanos to find an identi
ty by rejecting both American
and Mexican standards and by
taking on their traditions.
Pachucos were easily identified
by their zoot suits, which were
loose-fitting mockeries of the
American business suit.
The events at Zapata are a
channel through which the his
tory of the zoot suit era can be
exposed.
On Monday, Zapata held a
screening of "Zoot Suit," a
filmed production of the play by
Luis Valdez, a founder of Cali
fornia's Teatro Campesino. The
play gives an account of the
Sleepy Lagoon Murder Trial of
1942, in which Chicanos were
arrested on the basis of their
ethnicity and clothing.
Last night in Zapata Dining
Hall, "Zoot Suit" was presented
in another dramatic form, a
staged reading. It was directed
by Alma Martinez, a second
year drama doctoral student,
who starred in the original per
formance of the play as well as
the movie. She hopes the play
will help found a tradition of
Chicano theater on campus.

Residents of Casa Zapata perform a staged reading of Luis Valdez's play, "Zoot Suit," last night as part of their week-long zoot suit cele
bration of Pachuco history. VIVIS, a professional actress, played the character Hank.
'•luded Stanford students, alum
ni, and faculty. Among them was
l.uis Fraga, an associate profes
or of political science, who read
the part of the mythical charac
ter El Pachuco.
"This is a wonderful opportu
nity to relive history," Fraga
said.
The educational aspect of
Zoot Suit Week continues with a
lecture by History Prof. A 1 Ca
marillo. Tonight in Zapata
lounge, he will provide pictorial
and historical background of the
Pachuquismo era.
Of course, the week would not
bo complete without a chance to
experience the zoot suit period
itself. Thus, much of the week is
spent preparing for Saturday's
dance.
"We present a unique form of
learning in that students not
only get to think about a subject
but physically express it," said
del Olmo.
During the week, students at
tend salsa, cumbia, swing and
inambo dance lessons and learn
the basic styling of the zoot suit
era, including dress, make-up,
hair and the famous Pachuco
stance.
The party itself is like no
other on campus. As Vanessa
Delgado, a Zapata ethnic theme
associate, and the head organiz
er of the event, describes it,
"When you enter that dining
hall, you completely leave Stan
ford and step into another time."
Surprisingly the "time

change" is created not by a
clever amount of decoration, but
the presence of the Pachuco atti
tude — the mannerisms, the
speech and most importantly,
the "drapes."
About three-fourths of the
people at the party are dressed in
the Pachuco style; the men wear
hats with feathers, baggy pants,
suspenders and long chains, and
the women wear flowered dress
es and skirts. One or two people
even come in full-blown zoot
suits.
The highlight of the dance is
Dr. Loco's Rocking Jalaperio
Band, a professional group
which specializes in the Big
Band music which characterized
the zoot suit era.
The band got its start at Stan
ford 12 years ago during the first
Zoot Suit Week.
The week is part of the legacy
of Chicano education left by the
late Jose Burciaga, a longtime
resident fellow of Zapata. He
created the event through an as
sociation with Luis Valdez and
the Teatro Campesino. In its
25th year of existence, Casa Zap
ata plans to continue Burciaga's
traditions.
In Valdez's play, El Pachuco
delivers a famous line: "It was
the secret fantasy of every vato
living in the Pachucada to put on
the zoot suit and play the myth."
This week, the Stanford com
munity has been invited to do
the same.
The zoot suit party and dance
will be held at 10 p.m. Saturday
in Stern Dining Hall. Semifor
mal dress, preferably in the
Pachuco style, is recommended.
Admission will be free.
