# Dancing, history and heritage: Zoot Suit Week at Zapata
## 
### Rito Trevino Contributing writer 
For the last four days, the
residents of Casa Zapata in
Stern Hall have been breaking
away from the mad struggles of
Stanford's midterm season and
immersing themselves 50 years
in the past.
The Chicano / Latino theme
dorm has been celebrating Zoot
Suit Week, a series of events em
phasizing cultural awareness
which culminate in a party and
dance on Saturday evening.
Zoot Suit Week is a study of
Pachuquismo, an urban subcul
ture which developed in the
southwestern United States
during the late 1930s and early
19405. The Pachucos were sec
ond or third generation Chi
canos who found themselves
caught between their Mexican
heritage and their predomi
nantly-Anglo environment.
"This is an historical era
which is largely left unspoken
for," said Valentina del Olmo,
the Zapata head academic asso
ciate, who has done extensive
research on the Pachucos.
History has often portrayed
the Pachucos negatively, stereo
typing them as violent hood
lums and gangsters. However,

they are also regarded as the
first Chicanos to find an identi
ty by rejecting both American
and Mexican standards and by
taking on their traditions.
Pachucos were easily identified
by their zoot suits, which were
loose-fitting mockeries of the
American business suit.
The events at Zapata are a
channel through which the his
tory of the zoot suit era can be
exposed.
On Monday, Zapata held a
screening of "Zoot Suit," a
filmed production of the play by
Luis Valdez, a founder of Cali
fornia's Teatro Campesino. The
play gives an account of the
Sleepy Lagoon Murder Trial of
1942, in which Chicanos were
arrested on the basis of their
ethnicity and clothing.
Last night in Zapata Dining
Hall, "Zoot Suit" was presented
in another dramatic form, a
staged reading. It was directed
by Alma Martinez, a second
year drama doctoral student,
who starred in the original per
formance of the play as well as
the movie. She hopes the play
will help found a tradition of
Chicano theater on campus.
