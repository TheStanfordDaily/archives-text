um. We also request that only people remain in line. Inflatable dolls do not count as people, nor do water bison.
Both are acceptable as companions but not as substitutes.
2 Committee members will check the line roster occasionally. They will also explode occasionally. If you ask
why this happens we'll kill you.
3. Sometimes the committee mcmbeis will ask you to get on ali fours and lick the concrete. You will do this
immediately, and you will enjoy it.
4. Anyone who is the Ayatollah Khomeini will be asked to leave.
5. If you sleep you run the risk of having your nostrils stuck together with crazy glue arid your naked feet
placed m a bucket of cold vomit. The Viennese Ball committee cannot accept responsibility for such events,
although they do find it funny.
6. If anybody comes up to you and screams "You LOVE Mother Vienna, don't you private?" you will say.
"Sir. yes sir. I love her w ith all my heart" and boisterously sing all nine verses of the Austrian national anthem,
marching as you do so.
7. Exact change only. Checks will only be accepted if they've been blessed by the pope.
S. Any conversations w ith other members of the line will be strictly monitored. Any discussion of Marx. toes,
pain. God. monkey bladders, cell division or bubbling mud will not be tolerated.
9. When you will get to the ball you will discover that you can't dance, your rented tuxedo doesn't fit. you
don't like your date and your date doesn't like you. You w ill w ish you'd just stayed at home and drank gin or.
failing that, perfume. This is the way life is and if you don't like it go jump off a cliff or something, I don't
care.
