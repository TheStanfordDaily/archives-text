Back by popular demand (really), classics
are debuting lliis week in their new home,
Diversions. We don't know about you,
but we think this is almost a.s exciting as
when "Mad About You" was moved to
Tuesday. To lay down the ground rules:
We accept any shortish message or com
mentary, especially it it's filled with smut,
anxiety or incoherence. We do not charge
a fee. We do not censor unless you really
test us. We do not use last names unless
the people are public figures. All you have
to do is e-mail your pretty little snippets
to by midnight on the
Tuesday before the I-riday you want the
classified to run. And if in doubt, remem
ber: It's not that you don't understand
them; it's that they don't make sense.
Pheen, I can't wait until you're here. I just
know it's going to be a real ratfuck. Love,
Cud
There are only seven days left before
Valentine's. F.ghh.
To life, to life, sadomasochism!
Other phobias: 1) that when your car is
parallel to a bus, the bus will switch lanes
and smash you 2) that in your absence,
your draw group sits around talking
about how much they hate you 3) con
versely, that in your absence, your draw
group doesn't even notice you're gone 4)
that just because one of Tori Spelling's
nostrils caved in, the other one will, to*).

posse: I miss you guys, and I think the late
night shift at Denny's misses me. Let's do
something soon, you overworked bad-
Gaydar: Do you believe in it? H-mail your
thoughts to diversionsfi'daily. (No
Review writers, please.)
Happy (slightly late) birthday to the won
der twins of Alpha Sig!
If Nick Thompson invited you on a date
and you ordered Pepsi to drink, would
that be a faux pas or would it be OK now?
Bill Shen ist ein Langwcilcr. Was fur cin
Arschloch. F.r ist paranoid. Hr ist

Dear Thorvin: I want you bad. XOXO,
your secret admirer
Personal insecurity: Is it annoying or
endearing? H-mail your thoughts to
divcrsions(®daily.
And on a related note greasy hair: does
it give women a certain I have-more
meaningful-things to-do-than shower
mystique, or is it just nasty? H-mail your
thoughts to divcrsionsC'i'daily.
Imagine that.
Mother D.: It's now official. (Phew.)
My latest obsession is with radio ads that
are meant to sound like deejays banter
ing. I realize these are nothing new, but is
it my imagination or have they escalated
in recent months? They now include the
"static" of people calling in to the "dee
jay" and verbal "flubs" the "deejay"
makes. This manipulation is both fasci
nating and infuriating. My two favorite
ads are for Alamo rental cars and for
Pov/erbars.
Sometimes I wonder who feels more
alientcd and lonely — the clerk at the
Cliniquc counter or me?
Classic's: Are they just a big embarrassing
waste of space and should we cut our loss

thoughts to divcrsinns("'daily.
Are you chemically
