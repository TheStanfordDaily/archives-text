# EV residents concerned about Terrace rapist

After perfecting the dosage of chloroform on
his German shepherd, "College Terrace Rapist"
Melvin Carter moved onto women.
Carter, convicted for 23 of the 100 rapes he
admitted to, was released Wednesday after serv
ing a 15-year sentence in addition to parole. Cur
rently, Carter's whereabouts are unknown. He
was last seen boarding a plane at the San Fran
cisco International Airport.
"The department of corrections put him on a
plane and are not saying where he's being de
posited," Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Neimeyer
said. "He'sfree."
The San Jose Mercury News quoted Santa
Clara County Department of Corrections
spokeswoman Kati Corsaut as saying, "The
flight was headed east and making several stops,
none of which are in California."
However, the uncertainty of Carter's where
abouts is making some Escondido Village resi
dents — many of whom live just a street away
from several of his attacks — somewhat anxious.
"It's definitely made me nervous," doctoral
student Carol Ann Caronnasaid. "You thinkyou
are safe in Palo A1t0.... It's a nice area. It has be
come clear to me that rapes can occur any

where."
Another resident who wished to remain
anonymous even plans to alter her regular
schedule.
"I usually take the garbage out at night," she
said. "I won't do that anymore."
She also expressed a mistrust for the justice
system in general.
"I would hate to be discriminatory against
people that have served their time, but the first
issue is safety," she said. "With the parole sys
tem, there are always people who slip through
the cracks."
Brett Wells, a doctoral student and an Escon
dido resident, said it is no consolation that Carter
is headed east.
"I'm sure there are others on planes headed
west; it balances out," Wells said, adding he is
concerned for his female friends.
Neimeyer said if Carter were to return to the
Palo Alto area, he has five days to report to the
local police department where he resides, who
would then notify the neighborhood.
While serving parole at a work camp in Al
turas, Calif., Carter faced the daily threats of
angry townspeople after they learned he was
there.
"The women were carrying rifles and shot
guns in their cars and said they would shoot him

on sight if they saw him," Neimeyer said.
As a representative of the Sexual Habitual Of
fenders Program, Neimeyer attended a training
seminar where a case study on Carter was pre
sented by the FBI.
"In his early college days, he started out as a
peeper-prowler. Then he started stealing
women's lingerie and finally started breaking
into rooms for lingerie," Neimeyer said. "He pro
gressed into groping and grabbing females on the
street."
After he was apprehended, Carter admitted to
losing interest in the rapes.
"All the experts figured his next step was to
kill someone," Neimeyer said. "He is really a
frightening person."
Neimeyer added, however, that while he en
courages people to take precautions, he does not
believe people should be extraordinarily paranoid.
"We have a level of security now that we feel is
adequate," he said.
Because SURE Escort only has walking es
corts available now due to temporary vehicle
problems, the number of calls are down. Howev
er, employee Anup Arora, a senior, believes this
decrease in call ins is only temporary.
"As word starts getting around [about
Carter's release], people will be calling more," he
said.
