# Students win national product design contest

Last weekend, four Stanford
students won the 1997 Society of
Hispanic Professional Engineers
(SPHE) Design Contest, which
aims to stimulate creative intellect
in engineering and science and to
promote diversity in the corporate
world.
Forty-two Stanford students
from the Chicano / Latino Engi
neers and Scientists student group
went to Philadelphia for the SHPE
National Technical Career Confer
ence to take part in workshops and
learn more about internships.
During the conference, the
group was pleased to learn that
four of its members had won the
competition for their "Booster
Caddy System," a set of easy-to-use
jumper cables. The winners were
seniors Juan Flo res and Erica Vela,
sophomore Antonio Garcia and
graduate student Oscar Madrigal.
The idea for the project arose
after the group conducted a survey
and found that many people were
afraid of being shocked while
jump-starting their cars. The
group then came up with a set of
"smart cables," which cannot be
connected incorrectly.
The mechanical design elimi
nates the need for red / black color
codes by adding lamps at the end of
the cables that glow when they are
connected properly.

According to Vela, who was in
charge of the group's marketing
strategy, they advertised the case
as "The Booster Caddy. It's your
pal. It knows what to do even when
you don't."
"We are very, very excited.
Stanford has never won this
award. It's an honor to know we're
the best among our people," Vela
said.
Garcia echoed Vela's senti
ment: "I was kind of in shock for
three days. I'm just getting over
it."
Noe Lozano, associate dean of
student affairs and director of en
gineering diversity programs, said
the caddy was distinguished from
the other 10 finalist projects be
cause it was innovative, easy to
manufacture mid affordable.
Lozano also said one of the main
reasons the students won was be
cause of their extraordinary pre
sentation of the product. "They
were a balanced team, and they
used their talents well. In the real
world, your technical expertise
means nothing if you can't market
well," he said.
"I'm definitely going to enter
the competition next year," said
Garcia.
As group, the four students will
receive a $3,000 award, a Pentium
personal computer and a Hewlett-
Packard printer for the use of their
engineering organization.
