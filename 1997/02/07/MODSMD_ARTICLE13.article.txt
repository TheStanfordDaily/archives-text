Simpson's assets disputed
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — O.J. Simpson is far from
broke — he has a $15.7 million fortune and the prospect of mak
ing millions more off autographs and collectibles, plaintiffs'
experts testified yesterday.
But Simpson's attorney countered that the football great is $9.3
million in debt, most of it because of the huge compensatory dam
ages he was ordered to pay Tuesday.
"He has no wealth," attorney Robert Baker said. "To say he could
make 5 cents selling sports memorabilia is total speculation."
The same jury that found Simpson liable in the June 12, 1994,
slashing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and
ordered him to pay $8.5 million in compensation returned to hear
arguments on how much he should pay as punishment.
Plaintiffs called forensic accountant Neill Freeman and Mark
Roesler, a celebrity licensing expert, in an attempt to establish
Simpson's worth.
Freeman said Simpson gained $'2.8 million "by virtue of the
murders," including close to $1 million on his jailhouse book, "I
Want to Tell You;" $303,000 from his video; $434,000 from pictures
of his homecoming after his acquittal; and $75,300 from post
release interviews.
The largest income after his arrest, Freeman said, was from the
sale of autographs and memorabilia for $1,013,900.
Israel mourns crash victims
JERUSALEM (AP) — Schoolchildren wept, flags flew at half
staff and radio announcers intoned the names of the dead yesterday
as Israel mourned the 73 soldiers killed in a crash of two helicopters
en route to Lebanon.
Israel's chief rabbis called a day of fasting and prayer, and schools
across the country held special memorial services to mourn the vic
tims of Tuesday night's crash. Restaurants, pubs and other places of
entertainment were closed.
"Seventy-three boys who will not return," read the front-page
headline in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. Below the words, the vic
tims' photographs were arranged in 10 rows.
Israel TV said a preliminary investigation showed that one heli
copter hit the tail of the other in what was most likely pilot error.
The two helicopters were flying in tight formation, possibly with
their lights turned ofTas they approached Lebanese territory, before
they collided in what was Israel's worst military air disaster.
15-year-old arrested in clinic bombings
TULSA, Okla. (AP) — Federal agents arrested a 15-year-old boy
yesterday on charges he bombed and shot up an abortion clinic in a
series of attacks that started on New Year's Day.
The boy, whose name was not released, faces charges of using an
explosive device and a firearm to damage a building, U.S. Attorney
Steve Lewis said.
Lewis gave no motive for the attacks at the Reproductive Services
clinic in Tulsa.
KOTV-TV and radio station KRMG reported that hand
grenades and other weapons were discovered in the youngster's
house in suburban Bixby, Okla. Authorities wouldn't comment on
any evidence found.
The clinic was firebombed on New Year's Day, then hit with two
unidentified explosive devices on Jan. 19. Most recently, someone
broke in and shot up medical equipment on Sunday. No one was
injured in any of the attacks.
