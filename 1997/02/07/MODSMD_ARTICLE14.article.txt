# Clinton releases $1.69-trillion budget
## Republicans claim the plan is flawed but are willing to bargain 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton shipped Congress a
$1.69 trillion budget for 1998 yes
terday, saying it would erase
deficits by 2002 and for 20 years
beyond. Republicans scoffed that
the plan was brimming with cost
ly new programs and phantom
savings but said they were ready
to bargain.
Positioning himself for months
of negotiations, the president said
his plan would protect "the bal
ance of our values" with lower
taxes and with billions of extra
dollars for education and expand
ed health coverage for children.
He said it would produce a $17
billion surplus in 2002, a first for
federal ledgers since 1969, and
keep the budget balanced for
more than two decades if the
economy cooperated.
"This is not going to be a one
time thing," he said.
About two-thirds of Clinton's
$388 billion in budget savings
would occur in 2001 and 2002
after he leaves the White House,
cuts Republicans said might
never occur. And they said Clin
ton's $17 billion surplus for 2002
would become a $40 billion
shortfall using the less optimistic
economic projections of the non
partisan Congressional Budget
Office.
Still, determined to create a
positive atmosphere for talks,
Republicans shunned combative
ness as best they could and
praised Clinton for agreeing that
the budget must be balanced and
taxes cut.
"We have to work together,"
Senate Whip Don Nickles, R-
Okla., said in an interview.
"Hopefully this time we'll keep
our rhetoric a little cooler."
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., for whom a quick
agreement would be a political
prize, even predicted an early
deal.
"We will come up with a bud
get hopefully within six weeks or
so that is supported by the admin
istration and the Congress," Lott
told reporters.
Even so, GOP lawmakers
found a lot to dislike — and said
so.

They complained that Clinton
proposed too many initiatives and
sidestepped needed long-term
changes in the growing benefits of
programs such as Medicare. The
president's $98 billion in tax cuts
through 2002 — mostly for col
lege students and families with
children — are about half what
Republicans want.
"The administration has
embarked on a journey to
Shangri-La, a mythical place
where spending goes up . . . and
where budgets magically balance
with a wave of the hand," said
House Whip Tom DeLay, R-
Texas, in one of the day's most
negative reviews.
"It is in need of some very seri
ous repairs," said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M. But he added,
"I'm not dumping on it. This is a
very good starting point."
Adhering to his new low profile
adopted since his reprimand and

$300,000 penalty by the House
last month, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., declined to com
ment on Clinton's package.
For his savings, Clinton relies
chiefly on carving $100 billion
from Medicare over the next five
years, mainly from hospitals,
health maintenance organiza
tions and doctors. Republicans
have sought steeper savings and
want inducements for beneficia
ries to switch to less expensive
managed care.
Defense would roughly be
frozen near its current $260 bil
lion a year, and hundreds of
domestic programs would be
trimmed. Republicans agree
many domestic programs should
be pruned but want military
spending increased, in part to
start constructing anti-missile
defenses.
Clinton would also raise taxes
by $76 billion through 2002,
mostly on corporations and

investors and by reviving an
expired 10 percent tax on airline
tickets. Many Republicans want
to cut some corporate subsidies
for activities such as road build
ing for loggers, but they are reluc
tant to boost revenues other than
by renewing the airline ticket tax.
Clinton's proposed $98 billion
tax cut was criticized as inade
quate by key Republicans in
Congress yesterday. But all sides
do agree on several areas of sav
ings for taxpayers, such as a capi
tal-gains tax cut for home sales
and expanded IRA coverage.
The centerpiece is the "Middle
Class Bill of Rights," an $87.6
billion package of cuts that Clin
ton promised during the cam
paign. It includes a tax credit up
to $500 per child under age 13, a
$1,500 tax credit that can be
claimed during each of two sepa
rate years of college and a possi
ble $10,000 deduction for educa
tion expenses.
