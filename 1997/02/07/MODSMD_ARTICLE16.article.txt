### 
Casper deserves credit
for keeping lines of
communication open

HE'S NEARLY 60 years old,
he's got a full head of gray
hair and he speaks with a
thick German accent. He's usually
seen sporting a suit and tie and
heard discussing mundane topics
like the federal government's
research policies and whether rich
alumni will feel particularly gener
ous this year. And yet still he man
ages to appear in Big Game Gaieties
every fall, occasionally reads a bed
time story to a dormful of under
graduates and, apparently, turned
up in Serra last December to join its
residents for Hanukkah latkes.
In other words — and it may be
surprising that this page would say
so — University President Gerhard
Casper is a pretty good guy.
That's why it's so distressing to
witness the ongoing assault he's
been facing. In recent weeks he's
been attacked in the pages of the
two largest student publications
(this one and The Stanford Review),
on countless topics at his "Tea and
Cookies" (although it could be
argued that's exactly what a "Tea
and Cookies" is for) and by the lead
ers of the ASSU.
First, to address The Review's
Casper-bashing: No one has ever
accused that newspaper of good
taste, and it certainly has the right
both to disagree with Casper's
statements and policies and to do so
vociferously. But to run an adver
tisement featuring a photo of
Casper with the text, "Our Fiihrer
says: I love this paper," is well
beyond the bounds of propriety. It is
unfair to compare any president of
any university — or anyone at all —
to Adolf Hitler, and it is cruel to
liken a man born in Germany and
who spent the first eight years of his
life living under the Nazi regime to
the instigator of the Holocaust.

Moving on to the less sensational
and arguably more accurate recent
Casper-bashing: It is to be expected
that students will accuse their Uni
versity's administrators of an
unwillingness to acknowledge and
respect their concerns. It is also to
be expected that Casper, as the
physical embodiment of the amor
phous but nonetheless much-hated
"administration," is the one who
will be expected to answer for the
alleged evils committed by that
administration.
In the last year he has recognized
that reality and demonstrated a real
willingness to face a wide range of
student complaints. Casper has
been holding quarterly "Tea and
Cookies" sessions wherein students
may question him on any topic. He
has also started holding biweekly
office hours during which students
with appointments may stop by his
office for a chat.
All of which is basically unneces
sary. He is, essentially, the CEO of a
$1.4-billion company — Stanford,
Inc., if you will. He oversees not just
the seven academic schools but also
Stanford's myriad other enterprises
including — but not limited to — a
leading medical center, a federally
supported linear accelerator center
and a management company con
trolling thousands of acres of Penin
sula real estate and more than $3
billion in investments.
Yet the issues presented to
Casper are often out of his domain.
Take three brought up at last
week's "Tea and Cookies." Whether
sororities should be housed is deter
mined by the Office of Student
Activities (which oversees Greek
life) and Housing and Dining Ser
vices. Whether the endowment is
responsibly invested is determined
by the Board of Trustees. And
whether Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta gets tenure is, at this
point, determined by the provost.
What is admirable is that Casper
nonetheless spends the time to lis
ten to these complaints.
In other words, all we are saying
is give prez a chance.
