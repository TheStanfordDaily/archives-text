## Black community continues its struggle

THE LAST Wed
nesday of this
month — Feb.
26 — will mark the
30th anniversary of
Stanford's Black Stu
dent Union.
On that date in
1967, the BSU was
founded when a black

student by the name of Ron Miller (with
the assistance of five others) compiled a
list of all Stanford's black students and
called a meeting. He hoped this meeting
would provide an opportunity for black
students to build unity and maintain a
connection to the national Black Liber
ation Movement.
It's been 30 years and much has
changed.
There are now more black students
on this campus than the 150 in 1967. In
the past three decades there has also
been a noticeable increase in the num
ber of black faculty at Stanford.
The old Western Civilization require
ment for all undergraduates was over
hauled and became the Cultures, Ideas
and Values Program, in part to incorpo
rate valuable minority contributions.
Students can now choose to major in
African and Afro-American Studies.
The Black Community Services Cen
ter now exists to address the unique
needs of black students. The University
has also hired a significant number of
black staff members to fill administra

tive positions. The BSU has been at the
forefront of all of these changes.
It's been 30 years and much remains
the same.
The recent controversy over affirma
tive action and the declining collegiate
opportunities available to students of
color are causes for concern.
Appointment of new black faculty
members is no longer substantially ris
ing, and Stanford still does not have a
full-time, black, female senior profes
sor. The future of CIV is somewhat
uncertain with the changes that have
been proposed by the CIV Review and
Design Committee.
The African and Afro-American
Studies Program is searching for a per
manent director and is unable to hire
professors independent of other depart
ments. Some campus publications still
have no problem disparaging people of
color. The BSU will certainly be
involved in effecting change in these
and other areas for the next 30 years.
In the tradition of those who came
before us, the BSU continues to strive
for unity and a strong connection with
the black community both on a a local
level and on a global one. It is important
that those on campus not lose sight of
the fact that we are part of a larger com
munity.
The BSU plays a significant role in
uplifting the community both on and
off Stanford's campus. Annual events
such as our Kwanzaa Celebration, the

Soul Food Dinner and Malcolm X Week
bring the community together in cele
bration of black culture and achieve
ment.
It is also our mission to nurture the
next generation of black college stu
dents through efforts such as our out
reach to Eastside College Preparatory
High School, the first of its kind in East
Palo Alto. The BSU works with stu
dents at that school to encourage cul
tural pride, instill political awareness
and promote academic achievement. We
are looking to expand our efforts,
through BSU College Day during spring
quarter, to students in other nearby
areas as well.
In short, much has been done, but an
even greater amount of work lies ahead.
"Justice and Hope," a history of the
BSU, is in the process of being reprint
ed to commemorate our upcoming
anniversary.
We should not lose sight of the quote
that appears on the inside cover: "Carry
it on. Make it stronger. Always remem
ber."
We must resist the temptation to be
complacent, to focus solely on classes;
we must continue to strive for positive
change.
