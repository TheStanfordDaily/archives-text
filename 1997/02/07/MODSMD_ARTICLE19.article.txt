*Rampage 9 against Stanford post office was unfair

THE FRONT PAGE of Monday's
Daily depressed me almost to
the point of tears. It depressed
me because it contained one of the
most intellectually dishonest articles I
have ever read in The Daily and also
because it was done in poor taste.
I am talking about the rampage
against the poor post office and the
unbelievable nonsense that was said
and printed in that article. I just hope
that your unfounded attack has not
damaged the post office and its position
in our community — as I, for one,
would really hate to be post office-less.
First, it seems that the main thrust
of the argument was that the post
office is slow. Slow is a relative term,
and if the average American cannot
wait to have a decent human lunch and
has to eat a fast-food burger, then
chances are he also cannot wait for too
long for his mail. The fact of the mat
ter is that the prevailing attitude of
"rush, rush, rush" has not left us (or
taught us) patience: We want every
thing now.
Next on the list are those idiotic

polls. Since when has The Daily decid
ed to play the National Enquirer? Who
knows if those packages and letters
were sent on Fridays, on Saturdays or
on weekends? Or if there were holidays
in between? And who really knows if
any other post offices would have been
any faster in delivering them to other
spots?
ASSU President Bill Shen was quot
ed as saying: "This confirms every
thing we already knew about the post
office. None of it is a shock. It is good
evidence." Which brings me to the next
point: Who is this Bill Shen guy who
has so many great words of wisdom?
He speaks with such authority that
you'd imagine he has earned several
doctorates in "postal studies." His
gems included slanders such as, "Get
ting Christmas cards on Valentine's
Day — for most people that is really
perplexing." What kind of nonsense is
this? How many people does Shen
know who have actually experienced
such an event? I cannot imagine even
one. But that, I suppose, could be due
to my lack of imagination or simply

because Shen's sense of wit and
metaphor is way above and over my
head and just too "perplexing."
Last but not least, has anyone ever
worked behind those desks? Has any
one ever witnessed the post office staff
just hanging out and having a merry
old time while we waited for our mail
to arrive? I don't think so. Shen is wor
ried about losing our ZIP code; I'm
worried about losing the many good
hearted individuals who work so hard
for us every day. We are so accustomed
to e-mail, fast food and other sorts of
instant gratification that we even want
our letters and packages to function in
the same manner. It's more a symptom
of our times and lack of patience than
of the post office being slow.
I have also had problems with the
speed of mail delivery — but nothing so
serious so as to create a tempest about
it. I regularly correspond with people
overseas; sometimes I get a letter every
day and sometimes I get three letters
on Monday and none until Thursday.
But you have to realize that no one at
the post office is out to get you or me,

nor do they want the worst for us.
They do the best they can. We cannot
be spoiled brats and whine; we just
have to be patient.
Everyone has this problem with
their local post office, all over the U.S.
and all over the world. It's a global
problem and not a local one. The sim
ple fact of the matter is that the mail is
run by human beings. Not by
machines, not by computers and not by
robots. You cannot expect them to be
superhuman. You just have to be
patient.
Einstein was once asked to explain
relativity. "If you burn your finger for
a second on a hot stove it will seem like
eternity, but if you sit on the ocean
side with a beautiful woman for eterni
ty it will seem like a second," he
answered. "That is relativity."
Slowness is only relative. If the
Stanford post office seems to be slow, it
just could be that we are being impa
tient. Let's not run around blaming
them for our own faults.
