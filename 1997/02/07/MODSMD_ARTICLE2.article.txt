# MedWorld named in top 100 Web sites
## Students design award-winning page

Stylized globes float leisurely
on a World Wide Web site~sprin
kled liberally with Java. A fish
bowl, a drama mask and a short
stack of antiquated books sit
next to the blue-green orb; each
linked to a separate part of the
site.
Although this may seem like
an abstract combination of ob
jects, the flashy illustrations add
interest and appeal to Stanford
MedWorld's award-winning Web
site.
MedWorld isn't just loaded
with nifty graphics; it has also
been covered with honors. In the
March 1997 issue of Net Maga
zine, hitting the news stands
today, the Web site is named one
of the Top 100 Sites of All Time.
The highly touted page was also
ranked as one of the top five
health-related sites on the Web.
The awards are not surprising,
though, as the comprehensive and
easy to use page links to many ar
ticles, research tools and other
medical sites, as well as the Stan
ford Doctalk radio show.
MedWorld is funded by the
Stanford Medical Alumni Associa
tion and the School of Medicine
but is a completely student-run
project that provides health edu
cation for students, patients and
medical professionals.
In its first year of operation,
the page logged over 1 million
hits; a hit is recorded each time
somebody goes to the site. Any
one interested in taking a peek
can fire up their browser and go
to http://medworld.stanford.edu.
The page was created by med

ical students Larry Chu and
Bryan Chan with the purpose of
capitalizing on the Internet's abil
ity to facilitate the communica
tion and exchange of medical in
formation across vast temporal
and geographical barriers.
"The MedWorld project is
about making resources a reali
ty. Our goal is to experiment, in
novate and explore the best pos
sible ways to use the Internet
and the Web to broaden perspec
tives, enrich lives and ultimately
to make better physicians and
more informed patients," said
Chu.
Net Magazine is a 2-year-old
Internet publication. Pat Joseph,
the reporter who headed the Top
100 project, said the sites are
judged mainly on three cate
gories: content, aesthetics and
techno-sawy.
Mary Hoppin of Imagine Pub
lishing, the company that puts out
Net Magazine, said "after review
ing thousands of Web sites ... we
determined [MedWorld] to be one
of the best in the country and ac
tually one of the best in the
world."
Along with the Top 100 honors,
MedWorld has been inundated
with other praise. The site was re
cently named USA Today's Hot
Site of the day. It was also chosen
as among the top 5 percent of all
Web sites by Point Com Commu
nications.
Excite Corporation, an Inter
net search engine, proclaimed the
site "a winner" that is "sure to be
come the yardstick by which other
similar efforts are measured," or
as USA Today called it, "Med-
World is medical cool."
