## Fifth in the conference Stanford edged out by Trojans 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - Stanford
dug itself a hole here last night
that it couldn't crawl out of.
The No. 16 Cardinal men (13-5,
6-4 Pacific 10 Conference) played
some of their worst basketball of
the season in the first half —
falling behind by as many as 14
points — battled back in the sec
ond half to make it a ball game,
then fumbled away their chance
for victory in the game's final
moments, losing to USC (12-7, 7-
3) 84-81. And in the process, the
Cardinal squandered a golden
opportunity to move to the top of
the Pac-10 standings created by
California's 71-68 upset of first
place UCLA.
Down 83-81 with 8.4 seconds
remaining in the game, Stanford
had a chance to tie or take the lead.
But sophomore center Tim Young,
after gathering in a long-distance
inbounds pass from freshman for
ward Mark Madsen, fumbled away
the ball and was then called for a
foul on USC guard Stais Boseman
in the ensuing scramble.
Boseman missed the second of
his two free throws, giving the Car
dinal one last chance to tie the
score and send the game to over
time, but a last-gasp three-point
attempt at the buzzer by senior
point guard Brevin Knight was too
long.
"We had our chances at the end,
but once again we failed to con
vert," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "All we needed was
one stop and one play. [All we
needed was] anybody to make a
three-point shot, and I think we
would've won the game.
"We absolutely weren't ready to
play. We actually played pretty
well in the second half —

turnovers way down, better job on
the boards — but crucial plays
hurt us. Failing to rebound the ball
on a missed free throw, failing to
rebound the ball on a missed shot.
They made a lot of key plays down
the stretch, and we didn't make
very many."
As a result, USC, not Stanford,
moves into a four-way tie atop the
conference standings. The Trojans
now share the Pac-10 lead with
Cal, UCLA and Arizona, while the
Cardinal drops down to fifth place.
The 84-81 loss marks the second
straight year Stanford has fallen to
USC the at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena (last year's score was 84-
80).
In the end, Stanford's first-half
funk was too much to overcome.
The Trojans came out in a smoth
ering full-court press and harassed
the Cardinal into a string of
turnovers, turning several of them
into transition baskets. That
helped the Trojans build a 24-10
lead and created a wave of momen
tum that Stanford had to battle for
the remainder of the game.
It didn't help matters that the
Cardinal couldn't find the bottom
of the net. Stanford shot just 34
percent from the floor in the first
half, including a dismal l-for-7
effort from Young. USC, mean
while, was burning up the nets at a
55-percent clip.
"We missed a lot of easy shots
early on," Montgomery said, and
that "dug ourselves a hole."
USC led 43-36 at the half, but it
could have been worse for Stan
ford had it not been for the play of
sophomore guard Arthur Lee, who
tallied 17 first-half points en route
to a career-high 26. With the Tro
jans ahead 43-31, Lee converted a
three-point play that cut the lead
