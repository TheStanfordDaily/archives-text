# Men's volleyball takes talent south
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team hits the road once again this
weekend, this time for a real test of
the Cardinal's strength.
USC, whom the team plays
tonight at 7, and Long Beach
State, the Card's opponent tomor
row afternoon, both rank among
the country's top volleyball teams.
Both are coming off very strong
performances in their last match
es.
The Trojans have been some
what of an enigma in past years.
This year appeal's to be no differ
ent. As in the past, the highly tal
ented Trojans have been wildly
inconsistent, playing poorly one
night, then playing as well as any
body in the country the following
day.
Their performance in the
NCAA Preview Tournament in
Columbus, Ohio, is a perfect exam
ple of this. Last Friday, they lost in
five games to an Ohio State team
that Stanford beat relatively easi
ly. On Saturday, the Trojans
crushed the Dons of Indiana-Pur
due-Fort Wayne, a team that real
ly tested Stanford, in three games.
The Stanford coaches watched
both performances, so they know
how good the Trojans can be as
well as how poorly they can play.
"USC is a very dangerous team;
they're hot and cold," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "They lost to
OSU, then beat IPFW, lost to Long
Beach State but just beat Brigham
Young, the No. 2 team in the coun
try. When they are hot, they can
beat anybody. We have to be really
ready."
Although inconsistent, USC
will have two major advantages:
the outstanding play of senior mid
dle blocker Eric Seiffert and the
fact that the game will be played

within the friendly confines of
North Gym. Seiffert, the Trojan's
top player, leads the country in hit
ting percentage at .585 and is 12th
in kills, averaging 5.71 kills per
game. North Gym, the other major
factor Stanford will have to con
tend with, is a visiting team's
worst nightmare.
"North is the smallest and most
intimate gym we'll play in," Nieves
said. "It will be packed. It has ter
rible acoustics, a low ceiling, bad
lighting, everything you'd want in
a home court."
"Playing in North Gym may
give us some home court advan
tage," said USC head coach Pat
Powers.
While Stanford will have to con
tend with shoebox-like playing
conditions tonight, they will have
an entirely different experience
when they travel to Long Beach
State to play in the 10,000-seat
Pyramid. While the Pyramid
should be mostly empty, the 49ers
may present a real challenge for
the Cardinal.
Long Beach, coming off a victo
ry against USC last week, is
ranked eighth in the country. The
49ers are keyed by junior outside
hitter Geoffrey Cryst and two
freshmen â€” 6-foot-8 outside hitter
Ed Ratledge and setter Chris Seif
fert, brother of Eric. This trio will
look to stop the Cardinal's unbeat
en streak.
"Geoff Cryst is one of the top
players in the league," said 49ers
head coach Ray Ratelle. "He is the
hardest hitter I've ever coached
and will have to carry a heavy load
against Stanford if we're going to
have a shot."
Unlike USC, Long Beach has
been very consistent year in and
year out, always a factor in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. This year, the team may be
Stanford's toughest competition
within the Pacific Division of the
MPSF. A win over the 49ers in
Long Beach would give Stanford a
great start toward the division
title.
"Both these teams are really
tough teams," said Nieves. "Going

2-0 on this road trip would be great
for any team."
Although the Cardinal coach
es and players know they are in
for a tough weekend, they
remain the favorite in every
one's mind.
"It's no secret, Stanford's the
most talented team," Powers said.
"They have all the weapons; Mike
Lambert's back, and Andy Whitt's
playing great too. We'll have to
play the best match we can to have
a -h jt."
