# Cardinal destroys Women of Troy
## Women extend lead in Pac-10 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Junior forward Vanessa Nygaard and senior
point guard Jamila Wideman are two invaluable
members of the third-ranked Stanford women's
basketball team. But if last night's game in Maples
Pavilion were used as a gauge, their value could be
set at about 33 points.
A month removed from a 77-76 clifThanger with
USC, Nygaard and Wideman made the difference in
the biggest game of the Pacific 10 Conference sea
son, combining for 40 points to help the Cardinal
(22-1, 10-0 Pac-10) trounce the Trojans (14-5, 8-2)
by a resounding 103-69 margin at Maples Pavilion.
Nygaard's 16 points (all in the first half) and Wide
man's season-high 24 points offset a low-key 14-
point performance by senior Kate Starbird. The vic
tory opens up a practically insurmountable two
game lead in the Pac-10.
"Basketball is a team game and other people
stepped up," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Offensively, I thought we had a much
more balanced attack, which I'm more comfortable
with."
With first place on the line, both teams came out
with the same intensity that personified last
month's meeting in Los Angeles. Nygaard got
things going by nailing a three-pointer from the top
of the key and then finding junior center Olympia
Scott down low for the layup. Another three by
Nygaard opened up the advantage to 18-10 nine
minutes into the game. With USC rightfully keying
on Starbird after the scorchings it has suffered at
her hands, it was Nygaard getting the open looks
and taking full advantage, making six field goals
and grabbing four rebounds.
"I know that Kate traditionally goes off on this
team," Nygaard said. "She told me before the game
that they would probably guard her tonight so it
was my turn."
The Women of Troy countered with the play of
sophomore Kristin Clark and All-America candi
date Tina Thompson. Despite Stanford's best dou
ble-teaming efforts, the senior forward was still able
to muscle her way to 14 first-half points, putting
her over 2,000 for her career. Unfortunately for
USC, senior center Michelle Campbell could not get
into the flow of the game, committing two fouls and
turning the ball over twice in the first six minutes of
the game. Still, USC was able to pull to within 29-
25 with eight minutes to go on a Thompson three
pointer.
At this point, the Cardinal hit a crossroads. Was
it going to let a team come into its own house and
make itself comfortable, or was it going to be a rude
host and blow another Pac-10 pretender out of the
building? Starbird decided to take the latter route
by igniting a critical run with a turnaround jumper.
The star guard, who up to that point had only two
points, added six more points in the Cardinal's 17-8
run to close the first half. Nygaard contributed a
nine-foot jumper in the key for her 16th point, and
W 7 ideman put an exclamation point on the run with
a driving layup around a befuddled defender at the
horn to give Stanford a 46-33 halftime lead.
