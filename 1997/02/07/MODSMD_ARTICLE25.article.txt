# Cardinal destroys Women of Troy
## Women extend lead in Pac-10 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Junior forward Vanessa Nygaard and senior
point guard Jamila Wideman are two invaluable
members of the third-ranked Stanford women's
basketball team. But if last night's game in Maples
Pavilion were used as a gauge, their value could be
set at about 33 points.
A month removed from a 77-76 clifThanger with
USC, Nygaard and Wideman made the difference in
the biggest game of the Pacific 10 Conference sea
son, combining for 40 points to help the Cardinal
(22-1, 10-0 Pac-10) trounce the Trojans (14-5, 8-2)
by a resounding 103-69 margin at Maples Pavilion.
Nygaard's 16 points (all in the first half) and Wide
man's season-high 24 points offset a low-key 14-
point performance by senior Kate Starbird. The vic
tory opens up a practically insurmountable two
game lead in the Pac-10.
"Basketball is a team game and other people
stepped up," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Offensively, I thought we had a much
more balanced attack, which I'm more comfortable
with."
With first place on the line, both teams came out
with the same intensity that personified last
month's meeting in Los Angeles. Nygaard got
things going by nailing a three-pointer from the top
of the key and then finding junior center Olympia
Scott down low for the layup. Another three by
Nygaard opened up the advantage to 18-10 nine
minutes into the game. With USC rightfully keying
on Starbird after the scorchings it has suffered at
her hands, it was Nygaard getting the open looks
and taking full advantage, making six field goals
and grabbing four rebounds.
"I know that Kate traditionally goes off on this
team," Nygaard said. "She told me before the game
that they would probably guard her tonight so it
was my turn."
The Women of Troy countered with the play of
sophomore Kristin Clark and All-America candi
date Tina Thompson. Despite Stanford's best dou
ble-teaming efforts, the senior forward was still able
to muscle her way to 14 first-half points, putting
her over 2,000 for her career. Unfortunately for
USC, senior center Michelle Campbell could not get
into the flow of the game, committing two fouls and
turning the ball over twice in the first six minutes of
the game. Still, USC was able to pull to within 29-
25 with eight minutes to go on a Thompson three
pointer.
At this point, the Cardinal hit a crossroads. Was
it going to let a team come into its own house and
make itself comfortable, or was it going to be a rude
host and blow another Pac-10 pretender out of the
building? Starbird decided to take the latter route
by igniting a critical run with a turnaround jumper.
The star guard, who up to that point had only two
points, added six more points in the Cardinal's 17-8
run to close the first half. Nygaard contributed a
nine-foot jumper in the key for her 16th point, and
W 7 ideman put an exclamation point on the run with
a driving layup around a befuddled defender at the
horn to give Stanford a 46-33 halftime lead.

Senior point guard Jamila Wideman fights for the rebound against USC's senior
center Michelle Campbell in the Cardinal's victory last night. Wideman led the Stan
ford scoring attack with 24 points.
The senior point guard was just
warming up.
Taking a page out of Starbird's
book, Wideman took the game by
the throat and made the next eight
minutes her personal stage while
simultaneously turning the game
into a runaway. It started with a
driving layup two minutes into the
second half. The senior guard
repeatedly broke down her defend
er, wreaking havoc in the paint.
Yet another driving layin extended
the lead to 63-44 with 14:32 to go,
forcing a Trojan timeout.
It only delayed the Wideman
barrage, as she scored on a 12-foot
er and then took a sweet lead pass
from Nygaard for yet another
layup and a 74-49 lead. She capped
oft her 17-point spurt with two free
throws at the 9:38 mark. Wideman

made seven free throws during
that stretch and finished 12-of-14
from the line, making more free
throws than the entire USC team
combined.
"It was a great run," Wideman
said. "I think that was the moment
where probably our team condi
tioning kicked in."
Scott took advantage of Camp
bell's foul trouble by scoring 11
second-half points, and junior for
ward Heather Owen came off the
bench to join the five starters in
double figures with 11 points.
"Olympia got going in the sec
ond half; Heather got going in the
second half. Charm in gave us some
offense," VanDerveer said. "I think
different people really stepped up
which is good."
Owen's 16-footer from the left
corner made it 94-64 with 2:28 to
go, by which time VanDerveer had
cleared the bench. The only ques
tion remaining was whether the
Cardinal would break the 100-

point barrier, and junior forward
Paula McNamee did the honors
with under a minute to go, hitting
a short jumper from the left base
line for the ridiculous 101-67 lead.
"I think regardless of the score
tonight, they're a top-25 team,"
VanDerveer said. "I think they've
got a lot of basketball left in them
this season."
The Cardinal's 33 free throws
made were a school record, passing
the 31 made four previous times.
The Cardinal will square off
against UCLA (10-9, 4-6) tomor
row night at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
UCLA destroyed California in
Berkeley last night 82-56.

was my turn."
The Women of Troy countered with the play of
sophomore Kristin Clark and All-America candi
date Tina Thompson. Despite Stanford's best dou
ble-teaming efforts, the senior forward was still able
to muscle her way to 14 first-half points, putting
her over 2,000 for her career. Unfortunately for
USC, senior center Michelle Campbell could not get
into the flow of the game, committing two fouls and
turning the ball over twice in the first six minutes of
the game. Still, USC was able to pull to within 29-
25 with eight minutes to go on a Thompson three
pointer.
At this point, the Cardinal hit a crossroads. Was
it going to let a team come into its own house and
make itself comfortable, or was it going to be a rude
host and blow another Pac-10 pretender out of the
building? Starbird decided to take the latter route
by igniting a critical run with a turnaround jumper.
The star guard, who up to that point had only two
points, added six more points in the Cardinal's 17-8
run to close the first half. Nygaard contributed a
nine-foot jumper in the key for her 16th point, and
W 7 ideman put an exclamation point on the run with
a driving layup around a befuddled defender at the
horn to give Stanford a 46-33 halftime lead.

Senior point guard Jamila Wideman fights for the rebound against USC's senior
center Michelle Campbell in the Cardinal's victory last night. Wideman led the Stan
ford scoring attack with 24 points.
The senior point guard was just
warming up.
Taking a page out of Starbird's
book, Wideman took the game by
the throat and made the next eight
minutes her personal stage while
simultaneously turning the game
into a runaway. It started with a
driving layup two minutes into the
second half. The senior guard
repeatedly broke down her defend
er, wreaking havoc in the paint.
Yet another driving layin extended
the lead to 63-44 with 14:32 to go,
forcing a Trojan timeout.
It only delayed the Wideman
barrage, as she scored on a 12-foot
er and then took a sweet lead pass
from Nygaard for yet another
layup and a 74-49 lead. She capped
oft her 17-point spurt with two free
throws at the 9:38 mark. Wideman

made seven free throws during
that stretch and finished 12-of-14
from the line, making more free
throws than the entire USC team
combined.
"It was a great run," Wideman
said. "I think that was the moment
where probably our team condi
tioning kicked in."
Scott took advantage of Camp
bell's foul trouble by scoring 11
second-half points, and junior for
ward Heather Owen came off the
bench to join the five starters in
double figures with 11 points.
"Olympia got going in the sec
ond half; Heather got going in the
second half. Charm in gave us some
offense," VanDerveer said. "I think
different people really stepped up
which is good."
Owen's 16-footer from the left
corner made it 94-64 with 2:28 to
go, by which time VanDerveer had
cleared the bench. The only ques
tion remaining was whether the
Cardinal would break the 100-

point barrier, and junior forward
Paula McNamee did the honors
with under a minute to go, hitting
a short jumper from the left base
line for the ridiculous 101-67 lead.
"I think regardless of the score
tonight, they're a top-25 team,"
VanDerveer said. "I think they've
got a lot of basketball left in them
this season."
The Cardinal's 33 free throws
made were a school record, passing
the 31 made four previous times.
The Cardinal will square off
against UCLA (10-9, 4-6) tomor
row night at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
UCLA destroyed California in
Berkeley last night 82-56.

Junior forward Vanessa Nygaard and senior
point guard Jamila Wideman are two invaluable
members of the third-ranked Stanford women's
basketball team. But if last night's game in Maples
Pavilion were used as a gauge, their value could be
set at about 33 points.
A month removed from a 77-76 clifThanger with
USC, Nygaard and Wideman made the difference in
the biggest game of the Pacific 10 Conference sea
son, combining for 40 points to help the Cardinal
(22-1, 10-0 Pac-10) trounce the Trojans (14-5, 8-2)
by a resounding 103-69 margin at Maples Pavilion.
Nygaard's 16 points (all in the first half) and Wide
man's season-high 24 points offset a low-key 14-
point performance by senior Kate Starbird. The vic
tory opens up a practically insurmountable two
game lead in the Pac-10.
"Basketball is a team game and other people
stepped up," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Offensively, I thought we had a much
more balanced attack, which I'm more comfortable
with."
With first place on the line, both teams came out
with the same intensity that personified last
month's meeting in Los Angeles. Nygaard got
things going by nailing a three-pointer from the top
of the key and then finding junior center Olympia
Scott down low for the layup. Another three by
Nygaard opened up the advantage to 18-10 nine
minutes into the game. With USC rightfully keying
on Starbird after the scorchings it has suffered at
her hands, it was Nygaard getting the open looks
and taking full advantage, making six field goals
and grabbing four rebounds.
"I know that Kate traditionally goes off on this
team," Nygaard said. "She told me before the game
that they would probably guard her tonight so it
was my turn."
The Women of Troy countered with the play of
sophomore Kristin Clark and All-America candi
date Tina Thompson. Despite Stanford's best dou
ble-teaming efforts, the senior forward was still able
to muscle her way to 14 first-half points, putting
her over 2,000 for her career. Unfortunately for

the game. Still, USC was able to pull to within 29-
25 with eight minutes to go on a Thompson three
pointer.
