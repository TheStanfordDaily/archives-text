# Depth of team crucial to 34-point win
## 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
If you had told USC head coach Fred
Williams yesterday that his squad would be
able to hold Stanford's Kate Starbird to just
14 points and four assists, he would probably
have felt good about the Women of Troy's
chances for a win.
The senior guard has made a living out of
punishing USC (14-5, 8-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), and in her last three contests against
the Women of Troy, Starbird has scorched

USC for a combined 113 points (a school
record 44 on Jan. 13, 1996, 29 on Feb. 9,
1996, and 40 last Jan. 12). In fact it was
almost Starbird's 40-point performance alone
that helped lift the Cardinal (22-1, 10-0 Pac
-10) to its closest win of the season last month
â€” a one-point 77-76 conference win.
"We'd planned on staying with Starbird,"
Williams said. "We tried a box-and-one there
at the beginning to make some other players
step up, and [junior forward Vanessa]
Nygaard hit some shots from the outside
right away. We just wanted to make [Star

birdj work and make some other players step
up."
The Women of Troy may have accom
plished their mission of holding Starbird and
even prevented her from leading the team in
scoring for a record 10th straight game. But
they couldn't stop the Stanford barrage as the
third-ranked team in the country proved to
USC and anyone else with doubts that it is
not a one-player team.
"SC would have to come in with Kate Star-
bird as the marked person so to
speak," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "But we're not a
one-person team. I'm actually hap
pier when she doesn't have 40. I'm
more comfortable with six people
in double figures.
"They have a really athletic
team, and they put somebody right
on her and really worked hard to
deny her the ball. They really
keyed on her, but I think basket
ball is a team game and other peo
ple stepped up. Offensively, I
thought we had a much more bal
anced attack."
The 103-69 shellacking the Car
dinal posted against USC was with
out a doubt Stanford's most bal
anced attack of the season. The
Card placed six players in double
figures in scoring, including all five
starters. In fact, only freshman
point guard Milena Flores played
more than five minutes without
posting double figures. But that's
probably because Flores only took
one shot in the game, finishing
with two points, three rebounds
and four assists.
One big difference this time
around was the presence of senior
point guard Jamila Wideman and
Nygaard. The duo sat out the first
USC game because of injury but
more than made up for the previ
ous absence last night.
Nygaard heated things up for
the Cardinal in the first half going
6-for-9 from the field with a game
high 16 points for that period to
pace Stanford to a 13-point lead at
the break. Nygaard put up five of
Stanford's first seven points to

quickly draw the Women of Troy
out of their box-and-one defense
designed to stop Starbird, and from
that point on USC had to make do
by mixing up player-to-player
defense with zone coverage.
"In the first half, obviously if I
were USC, I'd put somebody right
on Kate Starbird," Wideman said.
"They really concentrated on her. I
think in the first half we didn't do
as good a job of recognizing that
and taking advantage of some
other options in our offense."
It was Wideman who picked up
where Nygaard left off in the sec
ond period. The senior guard
posted her second-best career per
formance with 19 second-half
points to finish the game with a
season-high 24. Wideman took
control of the game just 2 min
utes, 13 seconds into the half and
went on a scoring tear that
amounted to 17 points in eight
minutes, which included four
driving layups and seven of eight
free throws.
Wideman's shooting paced the
Cardinal, which totaled 55 percent
from the field and 84.6 from the
charity stripe.
Wideman got plenty of help
from her cohorts as the Cardinal
broke the 100-point mark for the
second time this season. Junior
center Olympia Scott was the
second-leading scorer for Stan
ford with 17 points to go along
with her game-high eight
rebounds, and junior forward
Heather Owen complemented
Scott's performance in the paint
with 11 points and seven boards
while senior guard Charmin
Smith added 10 points to round
out the double-figure scoring as
the Card pulled away with a 34-
point victory.
