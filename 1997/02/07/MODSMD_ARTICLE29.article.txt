# Top-ranked men and women swimmers face tough teams
## Texas, SMU host women 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Three-quarters of the way
into the season, the undefeated
Stanford women's swimming
team (6-0 overall, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) is feeling confident
and rested for this weekend's
dual meets in Texas.
The Stanford swimmers play
as hard as they train — they gig
gled at each other's antics dur
ing an afternoon swim practice
earlier this week. One team
mate made silly faces as she
posed as a Greek goddess in the
sun. Another sang a Disney
tune from"The Little Mer
maid" about what she would
give "to live life out of these
waters."
But when the Cardinal swim

ranked Texas Longhorns, top
ranked Stanford will turn into a
no-nonsense, nylon-suited team.
SMU, which finished second
in last year's national champi
onships to the Cardinal, will look
to four top swimmers to rack up
crucial first-place points in the
breaststroke, butterfly and
sprint freestyle events.
A Cardinal win will depend on
the overall performance, not just
first-place finishes.
"I think we have the quality
depth to beat SMU, but it's sure
not a slam dunk," said head
coach Richard Quick.

man and freshman Courtney
Lischke will add such "quality
depth" in the distance freestyle
events. The Stanford team also
hopes to garner significant
points in the 400 individual
medley event with sophomores
Alison Fealey and Kari Edwards,
its IM powerhouse team.
One of the most closely
matched races will be the 100-
yard backstroke between Stan

ford's freshman Catherine Fox
and SMU's Lia Oberstar, ranked
first and second in the nation,
respectively.
Fox, who currently holds the
fastest time with a 53.89, broke
Stanford's pool record at her last
meet.
The match between Stan
ford's senior sprinter Claudia
Franco and SMU's Slovakian
Olympian Martina Moravcova in
the 50- and 100-yard freestyle
races will also prove to be close.
The two friends and rivals
have a five-year history of trying
to out-swim each other at inter
national meets like the Euro
pean and World Championships.
At the 1996 NCAA Champi
onships, Moravcova topped
Franco in the 100 free prelimi
naries but lost to the Stanford
senior in the finals. Franco won
the event in a career-best 49.04.
Currently, Moravcova ranks
fourth in the nation in the 100
freestyle to Franco's llth-place
time.
Franco said she is not focusing
on her seasonal dual meet times,
which can be mercurial. But in
the same breath she said, "I'm
going to try to not psych myself
out when I see" Moravcova.
