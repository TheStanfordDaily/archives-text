# H&S defends tenure procedures
## Students question commitment to minorities and women 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
As the continuing controver
sy over the denial of tenure to
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akliil
Gupta reveals, minority tenure
remains a sensitive issue. While
officials at the School of Hu
manities and Sciences express
confidence in the tenure review
process, some students see the
Gupta issue as a symptom of
the University's lackofcommit
ment to diversifying the faculty.

According to senior Aly Remtulla, the work of
faculty women and minorities often "challenges
the structure of academia." Many established

academics do not feel that this work is legitimate,
resulting in "tensions between the 'old school'
and the 'new school,' " he said.
Some believe these tensions may stand be
tween the University and"the cutting edge" aca
demic programs.
"The University feels that it wants to have a
ground-breaking program like [Comparative
Studies in Race and EthnicityJ, but it has trouble
with what that entails," said anthropology grad
uate student Miriam Ticktin.
Both Remtulla and Ticktin are involved in stu
dent organizations in support of Gupta, who was
denied tenure by the deans in the school despite
unanimous support from the Anthropology De
partment.
According to Ticktin, Gupta "is leading the
field in mainstream anthropology, but, in addi

tion to that, he does important interdisciplinary
work that makes his projects all the more com
pelling The deans of the school are hesitant to
show commitment to Gupta's work, she said.
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven disagrees. The University is
"quite receptive" to new ideas, and many acade
mics with revolutionary approaches to their
fields have received tenure, he said.
The tenure process
According to Senior Assoc. Provost Kathryn
Gillam, the procedure for receiving tenure offers
protections to applicants whose areas of research
are controversial.
Faculty members are "counseled throughout


Shoven
their career about the quality of
their work," so concerns brought up
during the tenure review should not
be surprising, she said.
Also, according to the Humani
ties and Sciences Tenure Paper, a
candidate for tenure can suggest
the names of possible outside ref
erees, who will be asked to review
the candidate's teaching and
scholarship.
The tenure paper was first writ
ten in 1985. It outlines "procedures
and criteria for appointment, reap
pointment and promotion" in the
school.
According to Gillam, the deci
sions reached in the tenure review
process must be supported by evi
dence gathered through a variety
of methods. The process "guards
against a priori bias against a can
didate and his research area," she
said.
If a candidate for tenure re
ceives the support of his or her de
partment, the case is reviewed by
the school's Advisory Committee
on Appointments and Promotions.
"I rely heavily on [the commit
tee]," said Shoven. An "extremely
distinguished but also diverse set
of scholars" serves on this presti
gious and hard-working commit
tee, he added.
According to the tenure paper,
the committee consists of six senior
faculty members. Each of the
school's three clusters — the hu
manities, social sciences and natur
al sciences — provides two mem
bers.
"No single individual could be
confident" of making the right de
cision, so "I'm getting some of the
best people to give advice," Shoven
said.
The committee makes a recom
mendation to Shoven and the asso
ciate deans, who are not bound to
act on it. If a candidate for tenure
receives the deans' approval, the
case makes its way to the provost
and then to the advisory board for
final confirmation.
According to the tenure paper,
faculty members who are denied
tenure at any stage of the process
are entitled to the grievance proce
dures outlined in the Faculty
Handbook.
"New wave" tenure
Controversy over tenure for mi
nority faculty members transcends

the walls of the University. "Shat
tering the Silences," a recent PBS
documentary, addresses the plight
of academics who come from di
verse backgrounds.
A public showing of the docu
mentary on campus is in the works,
Ticktin said.
According to the documentary,
a "new wave" of minority faculty is
"bringing new concerns and new
ideas" to universities. Often these
minorities challenge traditional ed
ucation and offer an insider per
spective of ethnic studies.
The documentary highlights
leading minority members in acad
emia and explores some of the diffi
culties they have to face. Across all
disciplines, 90 percent of profes
sors are white, aiiu ininorities are
often clustered, in ethnic studies
departments, it argues.
At Stanford, affirmative action
policies focus mainly on appoint
ments and recruitment, according
to the tenure paper. The Universi
ty has no explicit goals or timeta
bles when it awards tenure.
The tenure review process is
"gender-blind" and "culture
blind," said Jane Hawthorne, staff
associate for faculty affairs at the
school.
"We do not even require that the
candidates identify race or gen
der," she added.
According to Gillam, the Uni
versity does not issue statistical
breakdowns of tenure candidates
by race or gender, largely because
these numbers may be deceptive.
The issue is tricky because some
of the faculty who are not likely to
receive tenure never choose to be
come candidates, she said.
Hawthorne also noted a great
deal of power in the tenure review
process rests with the department
in which a candidate works. The
school does not require the depart
ments to promote set numbers of
women and minorities to tenure.
Shoven suggested that his re
view of assistant professors hired
in the 1980s reveals that women
actually had a slightly better
chance of securing tenure than
men.
However, the school's officials
acknowledge the need to make the
procedures as inclusive as possible.
Shoven said he is "not satisfied
with the representation of women
and minorities," especially at the
full professor level.
According to the tenure paper,
searches for new faculty should
"actively seek affirmative action
candidates."
