# H&S defends tenure procedures
## Students question commitment to minorities and women 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
As the continuing controver
sy over the denial of tenure to
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akliil
Gupta reveals, minority tenure
remains a sensitive issue. While
officials at the School of Hu
manities and Sciences express
confidence in the tenure review
process, some students see the
Gupta issue as a symptom of
the University's lackofcommit
ment to diversifying the faculty.

According to senior Aly Remtulla, the work of
faculty women and minorities often "challenges
the structure of academia." Many established

academics do not feel that this work is legitimate,
resulting in "tensions between the 'old school'
and the 'new school,' " he said.
Some believe these tensions may stand be
tween the University and"the cutting edge" aca
demic programs.
"The University feels that it wants to have a
ground-breaking program like [Comparative
Studies in Race and EthnicityJ, but it has trouble
with what that entails," said anthropology grad
uate student Miriam Ticktin.
Both Remtulla and Ticktin are involved in stu
dent organizations in support of Gupta, who was
denied tenure by the deans in the school despite
unanimous support from the Anthropology De
partment.
According to Ticktin, Gupta "is leading the
field in mainstream anthropology, but, in addi

tion to that, he does important interdisciplinary
work that makes his projects all the more com
pelling The deans of the school are hesitant to
show commitment to Gupta's work, she said.
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven disagrees. The University is
"quite receptive" to new ideas, and many acade
mics with revolutionary approaches to their
fields have received tenure, he said.
The tenure process
According to Senior Assoc. Provost Kathryn
Gillam, the procedure for receiving tenure offers
protections to applicants whose areas of research
are controversial.
Faculty members are "counseled throughout
