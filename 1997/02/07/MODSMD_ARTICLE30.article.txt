# Men vie for Bell, then on to UCSB

There is a bell up for grabs at deGuerre Pool.
With only three dual meets left to go before the
Pacific 10 Conference championships and not much
more before the NCAA championships, the Stanford
men's swim team hosts the USC Trojans in a dual
meet today at 1 p.m.
Similar to the Axe in football's Big Game, the
Stanford and USC swimming programs vie for rights
to hold "The Bell" for the year. The trophy bell is
given the winning team of the annual dual meet.
The Trojans, who finished seventh at last year's
NCAA Championship meet, have been ranked any
where from fifth to eighth in the polls this season and
will undoubtedly be ready to take on the Cardinal.
USC's most potent weapon comes in the form of a
butterflier, senior JefT Julian, who scored 29 points
for the Trojans at last year's championships. He is
one of the string of butterfliers, including Michigan's
Tom Malchow and California's Dominic Galic, who
have come to the Farm and battled Stanford's fly
specialist, sophomore Matt Pierce. Julian's strength
in fly, as well as the middle-distance freestyle events
and relays, makes his performance a pivotal factor in
how the Trojans will match up with the Cardinal.
