# Men vie for Bell, then on to UCSB

There is a bell up for grabs at deGuerre Pool.
With only three dual meets left to go before the
Pacific 10 Conference championships and not much
more before the NCAA championships, the Stanford
men's swim team hosts the USC Trojans in a dual
meet today at 1 p.m.
Similar to the Axe in football's Big Game, the
Stanford and USC swimming programs vie for rights
to hold "The Bell" for the year. The trophy bell is
given the winning team of the annual dual meet.
The Trojans, who finished seventh at last year's
NCAA Championship meet, have been ranked any
where from fifth to eighth in the polls this season and
will undoubtedly be ready to take on the Cardinal.
USC's most potent weapon comes in the form of a
butterflier, senior JefT Julian, who scored 29 points
for the Trojans at last year's championships. He is
one of the string of butterfliers, including Michigan's
Tom Malchow and California's Dominic Galic, who
have come to the Farm and battled Stanford's fly
specialist, sophomore Matt Pierce. Julian's strength
in fly, as well as the middle-distance freestyle events
and relays, makes his performance a pivotal factor in
how the Trojans will match up with the Cardinal.
USC also has two new additions
to its roster. Sophomore Bela
Szabados, who transferred from
Florida Atlantic, was the NCAA
champion in the 200 freestyle and
will be a force in that event today at
deGuerre. Freshman Sam Stoval
was the top-ranked high school
senior recruit last year in the 100
butterfly and could help the Tro
jans' medley relay
Also to watch from USC is the
previously unheralded Lenny
Krayzelburg, a Ukrainian sopho
more backstroker. Suffering from
the flu at last year's NCAA cham
pionships, Krayzelburg finished
last in the 100 backstroke and
third to last in the 200 backstroke.
But at last summer's U.S. national
championships, he won both the

100- and 200-meter backstrokes.
Stanford sophomores Dan Schultz,
Casey Ketterling and Tate Blahnik
will be gunning for Krayzelburg in
the 200 back today.
With all of USC's up-front tal
ent, Stanford will once again be
relying on its depth points to win
the relays and overcome the Tro
jans in team scoring.
The Stanford men will be back
in the waters of deGuerre tomor
row at noon, swimming against the
UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos.
"We want to be the kind of team
that wins from the beginning,"
Pierce said. "We can't be a team
that waits to be threatened. We
have to come out strong early
against UC-Santa Barbara."
Santa Barbara carries far less
talent and depth than the Trojans,
but the Stanford team, as practice
for the three-day championship
meets, will be looking to come back
and swim fast in the second day.
