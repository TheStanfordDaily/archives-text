# Men's gymnasts seek to close gap to Cal
## A 						healthy team will help keep big picture in sight 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
After a three-week hiatus and
a solid interim practice schedule,
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team will emerge regrouped,
reformed and recuperated.
Stanford faces California and
San Jose State tonight at 7 p.m.
The same group of Bay Area
teams competed during the
Spartan Open last month.
Cal defeated Stanford by
nearly 10 points, posting a
228.15 compared to Stanford's
218.65. But that was with sever
al injuries and only one week of
practice following winter break.
"To me this is really the first
meet of the year. We've all been
in the gym, and now we've had
three or four weeks of practice
together — this is truly the
beginning," said senior co-cap
tain Jamie Ellis. Ellis is recover
ing from shoulder surgery but
still competed in the season
opener and will compete in the
all-around this weekend.
Most of the gymnasts who sat
out during the Spartan Open
will compete tonight, including
two for the first time ever for
Stanford. Freshman Craig Nes
bitt is slated to perform on the
parallel bars and rings, while
redshirt freshman David Ludlow
will compete on the high bar.
Sophomore Scott Finklestein
hurt his back earlier this week
but still plans on contributing to
the Cardinal effort. Only red
shirt sophomore Jeremy Her
man will stay on the bench due
to injury.
Cal is the team to beat this
year with two returning stars in
senior David Kruse and junior
Josh Birckelbaw and the addi
tion of two Ukrainian Olympic
team members. Cal edged out
Stanford for a second place fin
ish at the NCAA Championships
last year.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
plans to close the gap a little bit
each time and ultimately hopes
to emerge on top when the debris
settles.
"I am looking at around 224
points — about six points better
than three weeks ago," said head
coach Sadao Hamada, quantify
ing his expectations for the
meet.

Unlike many other sports
teams, the approach taken by
the men's gymnastics team
directly reflects the emphasis on
the big picture espoused by
Hamada. The team is unencum
bered by current rankings or
win-loss record.
Conversely, the Cardinal
keeps its eye on the prize and
works towards peaking at the
NCAA finals. Every step along
the way is only a training ground
for the final test.
"As each guy gets more expe
rienced and a little bit healthier,
I want make sure we beat them
by NCAAs," Hamada said.
To further these goals, Hama
da added three more competi
tions to the team's schedule pre
cisely to provide more experience
to the previously injured and
newer team members.
In addition to health and
experience, the ultimate test is
skill. "For the last two weeks, we
basically have tried to increase
our difficulty, and we are about
90 percent there on difficulty to
get the score we need to win
NCAA Championships," Hama
da said.
The Card is solid on two
events — floor and vault. Paral
lel bars are a bit weak, and high
bar also comes up short, Hama
da said. However, the biggest
concern for Stanford is rings.
In general, the Stanford
squad lacks strength, the main
requisite of a good rings perfor
mance. Unlike the other events,
the rings skills cannot simply be
taught in a few weeks; they
require strength, and as Hama
da said, "Strength development
takes a long time."
To combat that, many gym
nasts have started a program of
individualized strength exercises
which won't show immediate
results. Most of the Cardinal
gymnasts will draw upon a move
called the Maltese for their
required strength element. This
entails swinging into a horizon
tal position at the level of the
rings and holding it for full point
credit. Optimally, these skills
will be perfected by NCAAs in
April.
Until then, the Cardinal must
work on improving at each junc
ture, and tonight's competition
will continue the challenge.
