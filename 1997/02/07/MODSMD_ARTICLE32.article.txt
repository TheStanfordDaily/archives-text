# Card battles Fresno State at Sunken
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
If the Stanford baseball team
(4-2) is looking for incentives in
this weekend's series against
Fresno State (2-2), it doesn't
have to search very far.
First of all, early jockeying for
postseason position is always
important. Then there's the
prospect of playing against an
ace pitcher with an Olympic
bronze medal. Finally, there's
good old revenge for Stanford's
loss last year at the hands of the
Bulldogs.
This weekend's series, begin
ning tonight at 7 p.m. at Sunken
Diamond, will offer all three.
Victory in this early series
could be important to the Card's
postseason chances, said head
coach Mark Marquess.
"These early series are impor
tant because oftentimes, postsea
son standing is determined by
the team's success in head-to
head matchups against good
teams," he said. "Fresno is a solid
team. It is important to post a
couple of victories against them."

There is some great
pitching in this
league. We've got to
get used to it.'

The wins definitely won't
come as easily as they did during
the Card's last homestand
against a hapless St. Mary's
team two weekends ago. Fresno
is predicted to win the Western
Athletic Conference and has
already produced in the clutch,
winning two games of a three
game series against No. 11 Long
Beach State to open the season.
They lost to Big West Conference
foe Pacific on Tuesday.
The club is anchored by ace
Jeff Weaver, a sophomore, who
will be starting on the mound

against the Cardinal tonight.
Weaver, a preseason Ail-Ameri
can, posted a 12-5 record and
2.51 ERA last year with 12 com
plete games. Last summer, he
saw action as a setup man for the
U.S. Olympic team, pitching his
way to a 1-1 record and 3.14 ERA
while earning a bronze medal.
But the Stanford players
aren't worried. In fact, they even
sound glad.
"It's good for us to be playing
against him, a good test for our
offense," said junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer. "There is some great
pitching in this league. We've got
to get used to it."
"It's exciting to be playing
against him," said junior pitcher
Kyle Peterson, slated to start
today's game opposite Weaver
"But there's an added incentive,
too, because Fresno knocked me
around a little last year when 1
pitched against them. I have to
make up for that."
The Bulldogs are equally
threatening on the offensive
side, thanks to catcher Giuseppe
Chiaramonte. In four games so
far this season, he is batting
.500 with three home runs, eight
RBIs and a 1.143 slugging per
centage.
Weaver and Chiaramonte,
however, can't claim all of the
spotlight. Fresno can attribute
much of its success to depth and
experience on the mound, which
should 112 actor into success
against the explosive Cardinal
offense.
But Schaeffer think.-, the Cardi
nal can overcome these obstacles.
"We're looking forward to the
series. We played solidly against
L.A. la 7-5 victory on Tuesday],
but we still haven't played our
best. Fresno's a good team, but
we can beat them," he said.
"We'll do better in these
games," Marquess said. "We
haven't pitched as well as we
can."
Sophomores Jeff Austin and
Chad Hutchinson will start
tomorrow's and Sunday's games
for Stanford, both at 1 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
