## "Don't go messing with movies we love" 
### 
A lot has been said and writ
ten in the last few weeks about
the nation's love affair with
"Star Wars." Just as audiences
filled theaters in droves on the
special edition's opening night,
so did journalists fill their
columns with movie-related com
mentary. Everyone, it seems, has
an angle on "Star Wars."
Everyone, that is, except me.
This is not a "Star Wars" column.
I am instead focusing on is the
whole idea that modern technol
ogy could "change" such a classic
movie. Scenes have been added,
explosions touched up. sound
improved, all of which undoubt
edly add to the movie. My ques
tion is this: If modern technology
can improve one of the (if not
the) great movies of our time,
what wonders can it work for
really bad movies of the past?
Imagine what 1997 special
effects could do for, say, "Teen
Wolf." This was a movie that I
greatly enjoyed as a kid, but
when I watch it now can barely
stand it for five minutes. Perhaps
that's because it's easier to relate
to a plot built on the premise
that a high school student can
only play basketball well when
he is a werewolf when you're 7
years old. Or perhaps . . . Michael
J. Eox's wolf costume was just
not very believable.
No special effect in the world

can help a plot like "Teen Wolf,"
but I could definitely see an
improvement in Fox's wolf
appearance. Instead of just grow
ing a big coat of obviously fake
fur — even tackier than Michael
Jackson's werewolf costume in
the "Thriller" video — comput
ers could meld Fox's image with
that of a real wolf to create an
accurate depiction of what he
might look like as a werewolf.
With a few more effect tweaks
and an entire plot overhaul, we
could be looking at another big
money maker when this special
edition hits the screens.
A similar situation could exist
with two of my favorite Andrew
McCarthy movies, "Mannequin"
and "Weekend at Bernie's."
Again, visual effects are all that
stand between these films and
the rank "classic." McCarthy is a
proven master actor, especially
when dealing with inanimate
objects like store dummies or
dead guys. His lifeless co-stars,
though, are a different story.
In "Mannequin," McCarthy's
love interest frequently changes
from a dummy to a live person.
The transition scenes, though,
are lacking. Never do we see the
actual process of human / man
nequin metamorphosis, a prob
lem easily remedied by some
fancy digital footwork.
Bernie is a trickier case, main

ly because it is almost impossible
for any computer to add life to a
dead guy. So we won't try.
Instead, it's best to try to make
Bernie appear more realistic, i.e.,
more dead. Of course, this means
visually altering Bernie through
out the movie to subtly show
gradual decomposition. With the
dead guy finally correctly playing
his part, McCarthy's star acting
is finally given a chance to shine.
One important point: Tech
nology does not help all movies.
Specifically, I am talking about
"Godzilla vs. Mothra" here. The
same computers that made the
dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park"
appear lifelike could conceivably
cause the people in "Godzilla" to
move their mouths in time with
the soundtrack, effectively ruin
ing the "cheese factor" of the
movies and with it, of course,
any incentive at all to sit
through the film.
The possibilities of this new
movie frontier are endless. Think
of all the great re-releases that
would result from simply redoing
all of Molly Ringwold's films.
Technology could reach back to
the early days of film. Armed
with today's computer tools, Ted
Turner might even be able to
make a decent colorization of
"Casablanca."
On second thought, some
things are better left alone.
