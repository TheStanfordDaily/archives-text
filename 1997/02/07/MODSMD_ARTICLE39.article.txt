# Chemistry team links cells to computer chips

Under the supervision of Chemistry Prof.
Steven Boxer, research associate Nick Ulman
and chemistry graduate student Jay Groves
have found a way to attach a living cell to a com
puter chip by means of a synthetic, microscopic
membrane.
"The interesting aspect of connecting cells to
chips," said Ulman, "is that it's a good way of
looking at living things."
Groves said he believes the immediate impli
cation of this laboratory breakthrough is that
"by controlling membranes with devices, we can
study how a cell membrane works and eventual
ly, why cells organize as they do."
Ulman said, "The [new] surface gives us one
more bit of control" where previously there was
no means of controlling cells to study them.
In the field of immunology, the work presents
the possibility of studying the basis of autoim
mune diseases — impaired interaction between

two cells. With the new technique, scientists can
conduct experiments on cell recognition in order
to understand what exactly causes disease, as
well as assess the performance of cells presently
functioning.
Because the synthetic membrane can be at
tached to thousands of cells, parallel experi
ments can be conducted simultaneously. With
leukemia, for example, doctors looking to sepa
rate and target cancerous cells for chemotherapy
will be able to perform numerous experiments
and get answers within seconds. Currently the
same procedure requires considerably more time
and money.
Groves is wary of those who connect the dis
covery to bionics, a type of experimentation on
living organisms that conjures up science-fiction
images. Groves said this was distinct from his re
search. "The key is that we will no longer need to
use whole organisms to conduct experiments.
... We can eliminate the pain response."
Groves began experimenting with lipid bilay
ers in 1994 and found that by applying electrical

fields to membrane patches, he could manipu
late the concentration of certain types of pro
teins attached to the membranes. He repeatedly
cut into samples of the membrane with tweezers
to see how it flowed into structures similar to cell
walls.
In 1995, when Boxer brought Groves and
Ulman together, they formulated the idea to use
microfabrication techniques to make smaller
membrane corrals.
The researchers combined Groves' discover
ies about membranes to create a synthetic mem
brane that would attach to silicon chip surfaces
via electrical stimulation.
Looking towards the future, Groves said, "We
hope to utilize electrical fields more, to increase
what can be accomplished. We want to bring [our
discovery] into biological areas in order to study
life."
"An important part is that this kind of thing
can happen more easily at Stanford [than other
schools], given the facilities and equipment,"
said Ulman.
