And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are writ
ten on the subway walls and tenement halls."
— Simon and Garfunkel, "The Sounds of Silence"
In a similar vein, the bathroom stalls in many build
ings at Stanford are filled with words that are interest
ing, if not necessarily prophetic. Virtually every Stanford
student and faculty member has read the various graffiti
in the bathrooms, and a fair amount have probably con
tributed to it.
According to Hans Scheelke, the Stanford paint shop
supervisor, there is not as much graffiti at Stanford now
as there has been in the past. Scheelke has been with the
University for 40 years and has seen his share of the graf
fiti.
"In the 19705, when we dealt with the Vietnam War,
there was a lot more," Scheelke said. "There was more
political stuff."
Despite this sort of graffiti rut, The Daily recently
took a tour of the bathroom graffiti hot spots on campus.
We found that, in some bathrooms, the graffiti is far from
pleasant and intellectual. However, in others, debates
rage on about wide-ranging issues from abortion to con-

In some men's bathrooms around
campus, there is a phenomenon
called grout graffiti, written in the
grout above the urinals.

traceptives to morality. Often, the
graffiti is just plain silly.
The great debates
The women's bathroom in the
Lane History Corner basement
has lent itself to great debates
over the years. A debate rages for
a while, only to be washed off,
when another starts.
One such debate was on contra
ceptives and morality. The cata
lyst for the debate was a sticker
promoting the use of contracep
tives and a comment made by one
person. The debate went on and
deteriorated into silliness from
there.
"Clean up your morals."
"'What do contraceptives have
to do with morals — contraceptive
use is not a good / bad issue."
"You clean up yours because as
it is clearly stated in the Christian
Bible, NO ONE, except Jesus, is
without sin."
"Isn't there a 'thou shalt not
judge' statement? "
"Thank you."
"Spare me your holier than
thou crap until all of you so called
Christians can stop judg
ing. . . .Love God for yourself, not
me."
"I love (safe) SEX!"
"Clean up your morals."
"Sweep."
"Don t do graffiti."
"Sex is moral."
"Morality is antiquated."
"No, but prudery is."
"Dial 1 (900) MIX-A-LOT and
shake that healthy butt."
"I need sex sooo badly — bring
me a condom."
Other debates actually address
more than one issue at once. One
series that occurs in the women's
bathroom on the first floor of the
School of Education is special in
that it never really makes sense.
"I hate girls."
"I hate you all!"
"I hate seafood."
"Don't you hate guys ? "
"They're idiots — (but so
cute!)"
"No one should be shot and
killed — be nice!"
"Jealous mothers should be
shot and killed."
"You will forgive her, in time.
But for now, don't let her stop
you."
"May the force be with you."
Surprisingly, that last line was
written well before the recent re
lease of "Star Wars."
Politics
While the Vietnam War is over,
politics still finds its way into
bathroom graffiti.
Back in the women's bathroom
in the Lane History Corner base
ment, there is a brief — and obvi
ously older — discussion about Is
raeli politics.
"What should be done about Is

rael and Palestine ?"
"Precisely what Rabin and
Peres are doing — slow move
ments and resolution."
One must wonder what Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Ne
tanyahu would think should he
accidentally wander into that re
stroom.
Meanwhile, in the Communi
cation / Sociology Department's
second floor men's bathroom, a
series of people — or one frequent
visitor to that particular restroom
— voiced their opinions on tax.
"Tax Bill Gates."
"Tax Phil Gramm."
"Tax the rich. . ."
"Tax the predators."
"Tax sociologists opposing
tax."
"Fuck Newt."
Not to be outdone, the women
in the School of Education's bath
room suggested to restroom
users, "if you don't have a life,
sign here."
There are two names on the
list: Ross Perot and Pete Wilson.
What are they doing in a
women's restroom, anyway?
The artsy
There is also a great amount of
art, poetry and discussion on is
sues of art.
Not surprisingly, most of this
graffiti is in the Art Department.
The first floor men's bathroom is
home to a printable limerick, by
Shem the Penman (whoever that
is), to which many Stanford stu
dents can relate.
A Cleanly Limerick
There once was a man we '11 call
John
With studies intolerably long
He went for a swim
And threw the towel in
And bam! All his worries were
gone.
In the same bathroom, there is
also a lengthy dialogue on the
place of art in society.
"I question the value of storing
art in a museum. It should be all
around us in everyday life, not
stored all together in some build
ing. "
"It should penetrate our lives
and not be stored away like dead
relics."
"People have trouble telling
art apart from reality — that's
why they have to have it cordoned
off"
There is even a comment about
bathroom graffiti in this bath
room: "Why is the best toilet graf
fiti in the art building?"
The best? Who rates bathroom
graffiti?
About the Farm
Stanford University itself is
also a big topic in the bathroom
discussions.
Some comments, again, make
no sense. In the men's bathroom
on the third floor of Old Union, it
is written "It takes a lot of marble
toilet stalls to be No. 1 in the
West!"
Others make a little more

sense. Back in the first floor
men's room in the Art Depart
ment, someone informs pottygo
ers, "I met a guy last week that
claimed to have gotten a Bin
high school but I didn't believe
him."
Finally, in the same restroom,
someone tackles on a topic close to
home for every Stanford student:
tuition.
(An arrow pointing to the toilet
paper)
Stanford Diplomas
$120,000
(take one)
Deposit payment in basin and
flush.
Just plain silliness
For those bored with life on the
toilet, someone — again, in the
Art Department's first floor
men's room — provided a game of
toilet tennis.
It goes like this: on the stall
partition to your left, it says "toi
let tennis — see right."
On the right, it says "toilet ten
nis — see left."
Someone else wrote, "What is
toilet tennis?" under the words on
the right partition. He must not
get it.
In the Lane History Corner
basement women's room, some
one apparently has a lizard fixa
tion. In response to a comment of
"God love," a lizard lover wrote
"Iguana love." Along with this is
a drawing of an alleged iguana

and the comment "very bad draw
ing."
Meanwhile, male would-be
graffiti artists in the Psychology
Department have the unique op
portunity to partake in guilt-free
graffiti.
Above the urinals, there are
chalkboards.
This leads an interesting ques
tion: why?
When asked, Harry Bahlman,
the Psychology Department facil
ities manager, replied, "No com
ment."
This sounds like a little too
much like a psychology experi
ment to me. If it is indeed an ex
periment, they are getting some
odd results.
On one of the chalkboards, an
undersea scene looking like some
thing out of "The Little Mermaid"
was intricately drawn.
The essentials
Not all graffiti is creative or
cute; some of it reveals the deep
est human needs. In the outside
women's bathroom at Meyer Li
brary, one such expression is
scrawled on the mirror in perma
nent ink for all to see:
"We need toilet paper."

article. In other words, she was
the one that went into the women's
bathrooms and took notes for
Jimmy. For this bizarre act, he
thanks her.
