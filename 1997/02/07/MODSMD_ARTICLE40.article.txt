# Drilled holes in stalls becoming a problem
##

Not all of the grafitti on Stan
ford's bathroom walls discusses
issues so innocent as seafood.
Many of the men's rooms
around campus are home to
pornographic drawings. Also,
some men's restrooms — par
ticularly in the Lane History
Corner and in the basement of
the Art Department — have nu
merous sexually explicit mes
sages that read like personals
ads. Some of them also have
times and dates in which men
could supposedly meet each
other.
Men's bathrooms in the Art
Department, the Lane Histoiy
Corner, Meyer Library and the
Braun Music Center have an
other problem: peep holes
drilled in the metal partitions
between the stalls.
The holes are an increasing
problem, said a carpentry shop
official. According to his esti
mates, between four and eight
stalls a year have to be replaced

or have the holes filled as a re
sult of the hole drillers.
"I have no idea who is doing
this," he said. "It takes a lot of
effort to make a hole in steel like
that. I wonder how they aren't
getting caught."
The holes tend to appear in
the same stalls as the explicit
graffiti.
Linda Ward, the project man
ager of American Building
Maintenance, the outside con
tractor that does janitorial ser
vices at Stanford, said the bath
room graffiti is not a major
problem. However, a fairly large
number of hours are spent
cleaning the graffiti off of the
walls.
"I have a really serious bath
room [graffiti problem] in Jor
dan Hall," she said. "It will take
probably at least two hours to
get the graffiti out of that one."
She said the graffiti problem is
especially bad in the Quad build
ings.
"I wish all the bathrooms had
chalkboards (like the psycholo
gy department)," she said.
