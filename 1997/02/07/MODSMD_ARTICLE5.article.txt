The last stage of the rehabilitation of the
Quad is expected to be finished by the sum
mer of 1998, according to a historic preserva
tion firm selected to complete the project.
The firm, Carey & Co. Inc., plans to reha
bilitate and seismically upgrade Building
250, which currently houses the Asian Lan
guages Department. Building 250 is the last
remaining unreinforced building on the
Quad.

The firm has previously worked on sever
al projects in the multimillion-dollar retro
fitting of the Quad that has been going on
since several University buildings sustained
severe damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake.
This last stage of the project will cost $2
million and cover several aspects of recon
struction, including strengthening the build
ing's masonry and complying with a number
of regulations involving handicapped access.
According to Nancy Goldenberg, the pro
ject's director, the configuration of the build

ing will be left the same but several structural
changes — such as making the ground floor
and restrooms fully accessible— will be made.
Goldenberg added the firm will comply
with Stanford's interior design guidelines in
order to make the building "a little more his
toric."
"What is driving the project is the seismic
upgrade," she said. "The architectural work is
driven by that."
According to Otto Awakumovitz, the
seismic engineer for the project, the project
will attempt to make the building's masonry

walls stronger.
"They are two-foot-thick walls with no re
inforcement," he said. "In a strong earth
quake, these types of buildings perform poor
ly."
Awakumovitz will oversee a number of
techniques to strengthen the building, includ
ing spraying the brick walls with concrete, a
method known as "shotcrete." In addition,
the floors and roofs will be secured with ply
wood sheathing and steel anchorages, and the
masonry columns will be replaced with con
crete columns, according to Awakumovitz.
