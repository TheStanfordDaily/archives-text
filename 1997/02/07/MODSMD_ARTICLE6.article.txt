# Fac Sen meets
## Conflict of interest policy discussed 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A report considered at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting en
dorsed current University policy on
several conflict-of-interest issues
after a strongly worded faculty pe
tition suggested inquiry into the
matter.
The senate's Committee on Re
search had received a request from
the senate to consider the conflict
of interest concerns. The request
began as a petition circulated
among faculty by Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Bruce Lusignan.
In the petition, which was
signed by 69 faculty members,
Lusignan charged that "the rights
of tenured faculty are being regu
larly abided bv_ administrators who
derive mqjor of their
personal wealth from corporate
board memberships and from co
ventures in companies using Stan
ford's intellectual properties."
Lusignan went on to list three
major areas of grievance. The first
was outside income of administra
tors.
At present, principal investiga
tors of projects that receive funding
from government agencies face
limits on the amount of income
they can receive from any corpora
tion doing business with that
agency. The petition urged that se
nior administrators and deans be
required to conform to those same
limits.
Another concern was faculty
who raise outside funds for their
work. Calling such fund-raising "an
important mechanism ensuring
open, objective inquiry of tenured
faculty," the petition urged that fac
ulty who solicit such gifts be left in
exclusive control of the money, free
from University interference.
The third contention in the peti
tion was that the University's prac
tices concerning the sharing of in
tellectual property with private en
terprises are "ineffective, nonpro
tective, costly, unfair, legally ques
tionable and internationally irre
sponsible."
According to the report deliv
ered at the meeting, the committee
"found that the issues raised by
[the petition] are covered by exist
ing policy and that there is no need
to change the current policies on
conflict of commitment and inter
est, on gifts or on intellectual prop
erty."
Dean of Research and Graduate
Policy Charles Kruger, who is also
a member of the committee, elabo
rated on this finding. He said the
current policy embodied the two es
sential elements in the situation:
"trust in the integrity of the facul
ty" and a "clear, promulgated poli
cy" that is understood by faculty.
Lusignan made a speech reply
ing to the committee, in which he
said the report did not address the
issue of limiting the outside income
of administrators.
He also pointed out the circum
stances under which conflicts of in
terest might occur that were not
addressed by the present regula
tions.
Some main areas where the re
port said conflicts tended to arise
were when University officers sat
on corporate boards, when the Uni
versity held equity in a corporation
and when a private concern was
using intellectual property of the
University.
"I would submit that while the
(current policy) procedures appear
adequate when these three circum
stances occur independently of one
another, the process is completely
inadequate when all three coin
cide," Lusignan said.
After a short reply by Applied
Physics Prof. Robert Byer, the floor
was opened for discussion, but al
though there were faculty present
who had signed the petition, no one
made any comment, to the evident
surprise of the senate's chair, Phi
losophy Prof. Michael Bratman.
Speaking after the meeting,
Kruger saw this silence as indicat
ing the faculty was happy with mat
ters as they are.
"It seems like every person in
the room but one was satisfied with
our policy," he said, presumably re

ferring to Lusignan.
Lusignan saw it differently and
thought that faculty members
faced with his concerns and the
committee report would give the
matter further consideration and
bring it up at a later meeting.
"The senate couldn't take this as
the end of the issue," he said.
Also on the agenda was a mea
sure to change the criteria for
awarding University distinction.
Currently, graduating seniors
whose letter grade indicator puts
them in the top fifth of the graduat
ing class and the top fifth of those
graduating in their major have it
noted on their diplomas and tran
scripts that they graduated with
distinction.
At the recommendation of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, the senate unan
imously approved an adjustment of
the criteria. Beginning with the
Class of 1998, students in the top
15 percent of the graduating class
will be eligible, if endorsed by their
department.
Students whose letter grade in
dicator does not place them in the
top 15 percent will be eligible, as
they are now, for University Dis
tinction at the recommendation of
their department.
The senate also heard Clinical
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. Laraine
Zappert deliver a report on the im
plementation of the new sexual ha
rassment guidelines.
