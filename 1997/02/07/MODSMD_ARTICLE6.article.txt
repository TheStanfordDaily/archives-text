# Fac Sen meets
## Conflict of interest policy discussed 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A report considered at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting en
dorsed current University policy on
several conflict-of-interest issues
after a strongly worded faculty pe
tition suggested inquiry into the
matter.
The senate's Committee on Re
search had received a request from
the senate to consider the conflict
of interest concerns. The request
began as a petition circulated
among faculty by Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Bruce Lusignan.
In the petition, which was
signed by 69 faculty members,
Lusignan charged that "the rights
of tenured faculty are being regu
larly abided bv_ administrators who
derive mqjor of their
personal wealth from corporate
board memberships and from co
ventures in companies using Stan
ford's intellectual properties."
Lusignan went on to list three
major areas of grievance. The first
was outside income of administra
tors.
At present, principal investiga
tors of projects that receive funding
from government agencies face
limits on the amount of income
they can receive from any corpora
tion doing business with that
agency. The petition urged that se
nior administrators and deans be
required to conform to those same
limits.
Another concern was faculty
who raise outside funds for their
work. Calling such fund-raising "an
important mechanism ensuring
open, objective inquiry of tenured
faculty," the petition urged that fac
ulty who solicit such gifts be left in
exclusive control of the money, free
from University interference.
The third contention in the peti
tion was that the University's prac
tices concerning the sharing of in
tellectual property with private en
terprises are "ineffective, nonpro
tective, costly, unfair, legally ques
tionable and internationally irre
sponsible."
According to the report deliv
ered at the meeting, the committee
"found that the issues raised by
[the petition] are covered by exist
ing policy and that there is no need
to change the current policies on
conflict of commitment and inter
est, on gifts or on intellectual prop
erty."
Dean of Research and Graduate
Policy Charles Kruger, who is also
a member of the committee, elabo
rated on this finding. He said the
current policy embodied the two es
sential elements in the situation:
"trust in the integrity of the facul
ty" and a "clear, promulgated poli
cy" that is understood by faculty.
Lusignan made a speech reply
ing to the committee, in which he
said the report did not address the
issue of limiting the outside income
of administrators.
