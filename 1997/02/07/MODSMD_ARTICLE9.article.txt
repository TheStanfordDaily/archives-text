# Proposed CIV may begin to phase in next year
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
The CIV Review and Design Committee will
issue a proposal to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies next week which would per
mit some of next year's freshmen to try out an
entirely new Cull* • ■ Ideas and Values Pro
gram.
According to English Prof. Robert Polhe
mus, chair of the committee, the committee will
recommend a "trial run" of a revised CIV pro
gram which will begin next fall and continue for
three years.
However, some faculty fear that this "trial
run" of the revised CIV program will result in
the slow death of the currently existing cur
riculum.
The new program will operate in a one quar
ter-two quarter sequence — the first quarter
"Introduction to the Humanities" course will
be followed by a two-quarter sequence similar
to current CIV tracks. The program will exam
ine fewer texts, change the number of weekly
lectures from three to two and reduce section
size.
According to Polhemus, the committee will
incorporate existing features of CIV into the
new program, which will be open to a limited
number of students.
"We will preserve what works in CIV," Polhe
mus said. "This is not the phasing out of CIV. We

are trying to improve CIV, not get rid of it."
Polhemus said, however, that the one quar
ter-two quarter system is definite, pending ap
proval by the Faculty Senate and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies. Any existing
CIV tracks will have to change to fit this format,
he added.
"We're sure of what should be happening in
the first quarter. It would be advantageous for
tracks to adapt to two-quarters," Polhemus
said. "Existing tracks will be brought into har
mony with the two-quarter system."
Polhemus said reducing CIV tracks to two
quarters will make them easier to staff.
However, History Prof. Paul Seaver, who
has chaired CIV for the last eight years, said it
will be impossible for existing CIV tracks to
adapt to the new format.
"There is no easy adaptation to two quar
ters. There is an element of optimism there.
You can't ask people to go back to the drawing
board and revise what they've been teaching for
years," Seaver said.
Seaver said both he and History Prof. Car
olyn Lougee Chapell sent letters to the com
mittee requesting it recommend a pilot pro
gram for the new CIV program. According to
Seaver, the Committee ignored their recom
mendations for a pilot and instead are recom
mending that the current program be phased
out completely.
The current draft of the committee's pro

posal "used language of transition that made it
clear that they are not using our advice,"
Seaver said. "In our proposal we grandfathered
in the old tracks with the assumption that they
would be modified. The new proposal recom
mends that they be scrapped," Seaver said.
"It is something of a disaster... . the delegit
imized CIV program will limp along for two
years," Seaver said. "This will be terribly hard
on students and faculty. I can't imagine any fac
ulty member being willing to work under these
conditions."
According to Suzanne Greenberg, the pro
gram coordinator for Structured Liberal Edu
cation, a "perception of inequality" would sur
round the faculty teaching the current CIV
course and the students enrolled in the pro
gram.
Lougee Chapell gave notice of her resigna
tion from the CIV program last week.
The recommendation is a "strange out
come" for a process that was originally intend
ed to simply review the CIV program, Seaver
said.
"The Faculty Senate asked the committee to
review the program, not to scrap the present
program," Seaver said.
"I don't see a problem with a change in the
curriculum," Polhemus said. "We had three
choices: to maintain the status quo, to abolish
the requirement or to reform the program. We
are choosing the third alternative."
