# Women in ROTC see it as 'progressive'
## Stanford students tell about their experiences in the military and the value they have found

In recent weeks, the potential
"return" of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps to campus has
sparked heated debate. Stanford
students say, however, that the
military is not just a conservative
institution entrenched in the pa
triarchal belief system of a bygone
era. Stanford ROTC is a part of
that progressive influx of chang
ing attitudes.
Both men and women in Stan-

"It is actually a very fair envi
ronment. It is the only one where
women get the same amount of
money as their male counterparts,

Although there is still heated
controversy about women's role in
the military, both Wallace and
Bernabe are confident that there is
impending change.

way," Bernabe said. "There are so
many competent women in the mili
tary. Military policies will change for
the better, but there is a chain of
command and bureaucracy in
volved."
Stanford's involvement with
ROTC could help change policies
and perceptions of a mixed-gender
military, Bernabe said.
"Education and intellectual expe
riences at Stanford can open peo
ple's minds," Bernabe said. "Stan
ford offers an open environment —
it could see to it that future leaders in
the military do not have single
minded backgrounds as other insti
tutions do."
Bernabe added, "Women in the
military only help the sensitivity and
understanding of women's issues.
They redly do change things, but
the change might be slow,"
Senior Brent Alexander, a former
Navy ROTC battalion commanding

officer, noted that women in the mil
itary posed a huge paradigm shift for
those that have been a part of the
military doctrine for many years.
"The problem will be solved gen
erationally," Alexander said.
The diversity of this generation
bodes well for the future of the mili
tary training. Wallace said she
thinks the presence of women is
changing the face of the military.
"There's always going to be situ
ations that arise because we are a
gender species, but those conflicts
can be minimized," Alexander said.
"There are women in my battalion
that have impressed me and have
changes my preconceptions about
women."
The opportunities available for
both men and women, reflect this
change. Wallace s;iid ROTC directs
its Stanford midshipmen in a wide
range of duties from formal drills,
physical training, academic briefin
gs and community service.
Each summer is dedicated to one
mont h of select service in a different
warfare community. This past sum
mer, Widlace "cruised" a month in

the sea surrounding Okinawa,
Japan, shadowing a female enlisted
officer to learn and understand
naval tactics.
Bernabe's summer training pro
gram gave her the opportunity to fly
a SH6OC King helicopter and to
drive the USS Curtis Wilbur de
stroyer, one of the newest ships in
the Navy.
"We do some incredible things
with our battalion," Bernabe said. "I
am going to take away a sense of ac
complishment that a lot of people
will not get to experience."
Alexander said, "ROTC offers a
unique officer training environment
which infuses both military and
leadership training with normal col
lege life."
Senior Jason Trichel said, "For
Stanford ROTC students, there is a
distinct split between college and
military life. This is not accidental."
ROTC allows the military to take
advantage of the open-mindedness
of college students to balance and
complement "by-the-book-think
ing" and strict trainingof traditional
militaiy institutions, Trichel said.
