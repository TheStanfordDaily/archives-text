## Congress solves conflict by naming Arteaga president 
### 
QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — In a deal
worked out with Ecuador's powerful mil
itary, that country's congress named the
vice president to the top executive post
yesterday, ending a crisis that threw this
small Andean nation into chaos.
Lawmakers selected Rosalia Arteaga,
40, as Ecuador's president yesterday to
replace deposed chief executive AbdaJa
Bucaram. Congress ousted Bucaram on
Thursday for "mental incapacity," and his
refusal to step down sparked a crisis in
which three people claimed the presidency.
Congressional leaders and military
commanders worked out an agreement
early yesterday that puts Arteaga "tem
porarily" in power until congress amends
the constitution to clarify who succeeds a
deposed president.

At that point, Arteaga would return to
being vice president and Eabian Alarcon,
congress' original pick for chief execu
tive, would become interim president.
Elections would be held within a year
and the winner would begin a four-year
term in August 1998.
Arteaga's selection as president is a
rarity in Latin America, which has seen
only two female presidents before her —
Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua and
Isabel Peron in Argentina.
"She is an ambitious woman,"
Bucaram said after learning of congress'
decision.
The unanimous vote in congress
brought relief to Ecuadoreans, who
watched street protests against Bucaram
become increasingly violent and culmi

nate in a nationwide 48-hour strike last
week. People had feared the military
might intervene.
Police yesterday removed the barbed
wire that had kept protesters away from
the government palace, and families
again wandered through the area,
enjoying a quiet day in Quito's colonial
center.
Bucaram continued to insist he was
the constitutionally elected president
but conceded that he had lost power to
"conspirators" supported by the
armed forces.
"What is being formed in congress is a
civilian dictatorship," he said in his
stronghold of Guayaquil, where he flew
Friday night afler barricading himself in
the national palace for three days.
