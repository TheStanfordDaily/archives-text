ROTC's discriminatoiy
policies should preclude
its presence on campus

IN 1973, AMID the turmoil and
horror of the Vietnam War, the
Faculty Senate voted to sever
Stanford's ties with the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps by dismiss
ing the military education program
from campus. The senate's objec
tion to the bestowing of faculty sta
tus upon the military officers who
taught ROTC courses was one
cause for the removal, yet another
more divisive issue ultimately drove
the program away: students and
faculty members' protests that
Stanford should not be involved in
any way in what many considered
an amoral war.
Last week, an attempt to return
ROTC to campus was thwarted
when ASSU Senator Joe Freund
withdrew a bill that would have
encouraged inviting the program
to Stanford. Some people thought
enough time had passed to give
ROTC — which awards financial
aid to students in exchange for mil
itary service — a second chance.
But although the times and cir
cumstances have changed since the
program's removal, ROTC, as the
senate indirectly confirmed, still
does not deserve to be on campus.
But the issue now isn't war; it's
discrimination.
Simply put, ROTC, like all other
military programs, openly discrimi
nates against gays, lesbians and
bisexuals. If you admit to being a
member of one of these groups, you
are not granted admission to the
program and cannot benefit from
the tuition scholarships and leader
ship training ROTC offers to het
erosexuals. If you are a member of
these groups and want to partici
pate in ROTC, the military's cur
rent policy of "don't ask, don't tell"
effectively means "don't get in,
don't get anv money."

Even if one thinks this perver
sion of democratic values is some
how fair, ROTC's discriminatory
stance violates the University's own
guidelines. According to Stanford
policy, the University will not dis
criminate in the admission of its
students or in the administration of
scholarship or loan programs on the
basis of sexual orientation. The
University could not, with a
straight face or a solid conscience,
accept ROTC back without being
hypocritical to its own ideals.
Yet some people ask why ROTC
participants program should be
punished for a discriminatory policy
they cannot control. After all, with
no ROTC facilities on campus, par
ticipants must drive to other Bay
Area schools like UC-Berkeley,
Santa Clara University and San
Jose State early in the morning to
attend ROTC classes. Stanford stu
dents, unlike their ROTC counter
parts in other schools, do not
receive academic credit for partici
pation, and Stanford, unlike other
schools, doesn't try to position
classes around the ROTC students'
schedules.
However, even if ROTC was
allowed on campus, it is unclear
whether academic credit, which was
disallowed in 1969, would be given
to the students or whether any
attempt would be made to schedule
classes according to a very few stu
dents' agendas.
Nevertheless, the issue here
should not be one concerning the
ROTC participants' convenience,
but, as the Vietnam War protesters
claimed in their day, one concerning
right and wrong. And ROTC dis
criminatory policy is wrong. This is
not to say that ROTC participants'
are automatically homophobes; in
fact, Stanford participants, upon
entering the armed forces as offi
cers, would probably help to bring
fairness to the military's ranks. Yet
the presence of ROTC on campus
now would not support justice.
Rather, it would promote a policy of
gross inequality — a policy no one
at this University should tolerate.
