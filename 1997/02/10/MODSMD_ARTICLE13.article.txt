Kasrawi is ideal candidate for Constitutional Council

I'M NOT CLEAR on what standard
The Daily is using for determining
one's qualifications to sit on the newly
formed ASSU Constitutional Council.
But whatever criteria it does subscribe to
must be wrong given its unwarranted
attack on Nawwar Kasrawi's nomination
to serve on the council.
As an author of the constitution that
created this council, I have some idea of
what the council's responsibilities were
designed to be. The model we chose
reflects our belief that the members of
the council should have an understand
ing of the constitution and experience
and knowledge of its history.
The Daily obviously agrees with us
that council members should have a
"good understanding of the document
and an impartial mind." Yet while
attacking Kasrawi's qualifications, the
Feb. 3 editorial at the same time con
cedes that Kasrawi, perhaps better than
the other nominees, meets this standard.
Furthermore, The Daily has not done its
homework. While I understand that The

Daily is run by undergraduates, few of
whom remember Kasrawi's term as sen
ate chair, I would think that the editorial
board could at least get its facts right.
The editorial claims Kasrawi's history
with the ASSU is one filled with consti
tutional violations, then cites an incident
in which Kasrawi strictly adhered to the
constitution's text despite strong pres
sures from many senators who sought its
violation. The Daily claims that this
occasion, known as "The Sweatshirt Inci
dent," marked the first time the provi
sion had ever been enforced. However, it
ignores the fact that it was also the first
time any senator had made a motion call
ing for its enforcement.
While the decision was controversial,
Kasrawi stuck to the constitution despite
objections from senators like Steve Rus
sell, who called the act a "colossal abuse
of power." Despite the comments from
bitter senators who found themselves on
the losing side of the vote (a vote which, I
may add, was retaken at the next senate
meeting, given the controversial nature

of the events), the facts of the story point
the other way.
With regard to the e-mail incident,
again Kasrawi violated no constitutional
or bylaw provision. He was not disquali
fied but withdrew after he realized the
unexpected problems his message had
caused. Second, Kasrawi's opposition to
certain constitutional provisions should
certainly not bar him from membership
on the council. Rather, his valuable
knowledge of the document and experi
ence interpreting it as senate chair make
him uniquely qualified.
Finally, The Daily points to Kasrawi's
association with ASSU President Bill
Shen and the favors he has done for Bill
over the years. I find The Daily's ethical
conscience amusing, and I wonder which
members of its editorial staff have also
done similar favors for Bill or for past
ASSU executives, blurring their ethical
obligations to an unbiased reporting. Not
that I am casting stones back at The
Daily â€” instead I think it is taking this
much too seriously. This is only student

government; there's nothing wrong with
friendships built along the way.
The Daily's implication that Kasrawi
will not be able to serve as a rational and
unbiased member of the council is
absurd. The council, if it is ever put into
place, will be in dire need of constitution
al expertise. Kasrawi is a one of a hand
ful of students left on campus who have
a strong understanding of the document,
both pre- and post-amendment, its spirit
and the intent of those who added to it
along the way.
Thus, Kasrawi's "long history with
the ASSU" which The Daily derides is in
fact his greatest strength. Whatever
vendetta The Daily has against Kasrawi
should be put aside. Although I'm sure
The Daily's editorial board would much
rather decide these questions and contro
versies, people like Kasrawi are inherent
ly much more qualified.
