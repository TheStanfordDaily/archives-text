# Listening to students is part of Casper's job
## 
### 
The first argument in The Daily's
Friday editorial, that University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper is "a good guy," is
certainly true. The second, that he is
paying considerable attention to student
concerns and keeps lines of communica
tion open, is debatable.
However, The Daily's third argu
ment, that Casper shouldn't need to
pay attention to students because he is
merely the CEO of a $1 billion-plus cor
poration, is one of the most short-sight
ed statements I have ever seen in our
dominant campus publication. Casper
and I do not agree on everything, but I
have no doubt that we could find com
mon ground in opposing The Daily's

statement that listening to students is
"basically unnecessary" for a university
president.
Universities are fundamentally dif
ferent from corporations and one
important distinction is that their lead
ers must be much more than just good
at managing money and public rela
tions. They must also, through their
own actions and through the universi
ties that they build, be able to inspire
and encourage a younger generation to
become productive members of society.
This can only be accomplished if they
have vision and if they fundamentally
care about students and are willing to
listen to our ideas, concerns and issues.
I am discouraged that The Daily's
editorial board thinks otherwise.
