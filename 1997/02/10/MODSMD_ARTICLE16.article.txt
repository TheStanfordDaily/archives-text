UNIVERSITY
President Ger
hard Casper has
a tough job. The organi
zation he's responsible
for is huge and bureau
cratic, and it's composed
of a lot of really smart
people who have very
definite opinions. They

all want to tell him how to do his job. It's a
wonder he can get anything done at all.
Yet Casper has managed to tame sever
al major institutional problems in just a
few years on the job — the budget deficit
and public relations nightmare that fol
lowed the indirect cost fiasco, the lack of
alumni support and the enrollment rate of
top-quality student applicants, for
starters. As would any leader of such a
large organization, I'm sure Casper would
credit many of these successes to the ongo
ing support and competence of a commit
ted provost, faculty and staff.
The ASSU's business office — identi
fied under the banner of Stanford Student
Enterprises — has faced similar institu
tional challenges over the same period.
Granted, our balance sheet talks about
millions instead of billions. We've had to
negotiate mergers of student publications
instead of hospitals. We try to iron out
expansion projects with Tresidder Union
management instead of the Palo Alto Plan
ning Commission. The magnitude of prob

lems, in real-world terms, is clearly not in
the same ballpark.
But since the University's own budget
cuts eliminated any financial contribution
to the operations of the ASSU, Stanford
Student Enterprises has been responsible
for recreating more than 50 percent of our
annual operating revenue. The only way to
do that has been to aggressively expand
our service activities — The Stanford
Store, Sunday Flicks, Lecture Notes and
the Stanford Directory, among others.
To bring in talent to manage this expan
sion, we've had to target recruiting pro
grams at business-interested freshmen as
soon as they hit campus and place them in
positions of real responsibility at the out
set. Since the summer, we've employed
more than 175 students, making SSE one
of the largest employers on campus.
To maintain the professionalism of our
services, we've set organization-wide stan
dards for the quality of our services and
made promotion from within the organiza
tion a primary goal.
And to fulfill our educational mission
and ensure the long-term viability of SSE,
our members have had to take responsibil
ity for training the next generation and use
some of their clout as alumni to recognize
the unparalleled business experience that
student managers at SSE develop.
These sort of organizational leadership
issues haven't been addressed comprehen
sively in the past, but our programs are

seeing results. The student members of
SSE are starting to recognize the complex
ity of trying to accomplish something in a
bureaucracy. They're learning why dealing
well with new information and new people
is fundamental to any successful venture.
And they're learning the value of team
work and a personal commitment to edu
cation. It's a mission we're veiy proud of.
SSE also faces two organizational chal
lenges Casper is probably very grateful he
doesn't have: First, eveiy member of our
staff changes jobs every nine months, and
none but the rarest few has more than
three years experience with the organiza
tion. As well, almost every member of the
organization has a full-time job already —
as a student. From an administration and
management standpoint, SSHI could bene
fit tremendously from the kind of stability
and educational value that real mentor
relationships with University faculty and
staff members can bring.
SSE is seeking faculty and staff mem
bers of the Graduate School of Business or
other University departments with busi
ness experience who would enjoy serving
as mentors for a $6-million educational
student-run nonprofit organization. Hir
ing for student staff runs year-round.
Recruiting for student managers begins
late winter quarter.

John Hall is financial manager of the
ASSU.
