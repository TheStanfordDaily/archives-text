# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Third-grade love wasn't all that great anyway 
### 
Believe me, the last thing i
wanted to find myself writing
about this week was Valentine's
Day. We all know that Valentine's Day is
a silly day which, like all holidays ending
in"Day," was actually invented by Hall
mark to jack up its post-Yuletide profits,
given that Presidents' Day and Ground
hog Day weren't cutting the care
enough-to-send-the-very-best mustard.
As a result, many of us have pledged
not to recognize this most unholy of holi
days. One friend of mine wears only black
clothes and a nasty scowl to protest what
he sees as a day that discriminates
against single people. This really pisses
off his girlfriend.
Others choose, fairly or unfairly, to
channel their frustrations into disdain for
the opposite sex. Another friend of mine,
at another school not unlike our own, is
constantly complaining that his universe
is populated by cold, uncaring women who
are "concerned only with their careers."
Fortunately, I don't share his pessimism.
I remain convinced that any casual dating
relationship in college could very well

develop into something more, into a deep
er commitment that could eventually lead
to wedding bells and a happy, wonderful
life together. And if that happens, she
damn well better be able to support me.
In general, I try to make the best of
Valentine's Day. I haven't shied away
from celebrating it the same way millions
of other Americans do. In fact, I look for
ward to it. Every year, I stock up on beer
and pretzels and chips and then I invite all
the guys over and we order a pizza. Okay,
so maybe that's the Super Bowl, but
they're veiy similar insofar as both events
happen every winter and each is a lot more
fun for the ones who score more often.
But for all you perennial losers out
there in the "AFC of Love," don't lose
heart. Valentine's Day can also be a cele
bration of singularity, and all the options
and opportunity inherent in that condi
tion. In fact, another friend of mine — I
have a lot of friends — recently confided
in me that she enjoyed Valentine's Day
more in moments of singleness. "Dating
somebody, Valentine's just means a lot of
stress and planning," she said, her physi

cal movement noticeably hindered by the
heavy ball-and-chain locked to her ankle.
"When you're single, there's always the
anticipation that some chickenshit
you've had your eye on will have an
excuse to come forward."
What she said made a lot of sense and
made me think back to grade school and
all the candy hearts and perforated
sheets of valentines. 1 mean, third-grade
Valentine's parties were the perfect cover
from under which "chickenshits" could
emerge, as social norms and Mrs. Brock
meyer demanded that we give valentines
to everyone in class anyway.
Giving out valentines raised impor
tant questions. Who gets which valen
tine? Is it okay to send one of the "Be My
Valentine!" ones to so-and-so? Would
they understand that it's a rhetorical
request or would they misinterpret it?
And as a third-grader, am I sure I know
what "rhetorical" means? How about
"rhapsodical?"
And then there was the issue of
whether or not to make certain overtures
toward that certain someone, that person

with whom you most, most wanted to . . .
"go out."
In my case, that was Lisa Weinstein.
Please understand, Lisa was attractive.
She was sensible and she generally com
ported herself very well for a third-grad
er. Hut I have to admit I was drawn to
her because of one thing and one thing
only: She had one blue eye and one brown
eye. Okay, I guess that's two things, but
the point is my love was real because I
had a well thought out reason for my
feelings, which was more than I could say
for most of the pint-sized paramours
pairing up around me.
Remember, this was still at the very
dawn of the "going out" movement, at
least in my school. "Going out," of
course, didn't involve going anywhere,
but merely meant that two individuals
entered into a binding and unbreakable
contract when one of them, generally the
female, would etch "[name] Vs [name of
betrothed!" on her notebook, where i(
would remain, sometimes for weeks,
until it was scratched out and replaced
with the name of a guy who sat at a dif

ferent cluster of desks altogether. In this
same space, she may even record the con
tracts of other friends. This process could
continue until even the spine of her note
book was covered with current and
expired couplings. In thousands of years,
archaeologists will discover an ancient
Trapper Keeper and mistake it for the
matrilineal register of an entire village.
As for Lisa, I was too chickenshit to do
anything about it. If I had, maybe I
wouldn't be single this Valentine's Day.
Maybe I would still be together with Lisa,
staring deeply into her blue / brown eyes
and seriously questioning the wisdom of
maintaining a 14-year relationship with
someone I met in the third grade.
