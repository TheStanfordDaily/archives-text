Geology Prof. Emeritus Benjamin Page, well
known for his research on Californian mountain
ranges and the geology of the Bay Area, died Jan. 31
in Palo Alto. He was 85.
Page, a 1933 Stanford graduate, spent most of his
teaching and research career at Stanford. He also
served as chair of the Geology Department.
Page was nationally and internationally known for
his research on the Sierra Nevada and mountain
ranges that are formed by sea-floor spreading. He did
research in various foreign countries as well as the
United States and published extensively in leading
professional journals.
"He was a critical scientist who would demand ev
idence without demeaning the person," said Emeri
tus Geology Prof. Emeritus George Thompson, a
long-time colleague. "He was warm and friendly."
In recent years, Page specialized in the geology of
the Bay Area and the Stanford campus.
"His drive to learn more about the geology of the
Bay Area was centered on making field observations
in newly excavated trenches, mapping surface geolo
gy at different scales and incorporating the never
ending stream of geophysical information into his
scheme of California geology," Geology Prof. Emeri
tus Robert Coleman said.
"His scientific work helped us understand and
cope with the geologic hazards related to earth

quakes, landslides, flooding and (the) environment of
the Bay Area."
Page worked on numerous projects around the
Stanford campus, including chronicling its geological
history and helping to find a secure foundation on
which to build the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
"He made a point of visiting every major construc
tion site to look at the rocks," said Geology Prof. Jim
Ingle. "He compiled a very good geological map of the
campus."
Page also led students on field trips to important
geological sites on campus.
"His knowledge of the campus geology has become
legendary," said Coleman.
Colleagues remembered Page's expertise and per
sonality equally vividly.
"He was a wonderful and remarkable person,"
said Ingle. "He had a phenomenal drive and was con
tinually active up to the day he died."
"Ben contributed his geological knowledge to all
seminars and scientific meetings he attended with
humor but with an authority and wisdom only a few
could question," said Coleman.
His ties to the University were all-encompassing:
His mother and father both attended Stanford as un
dergraduates, as did his wife, Virginia Ingrim Page.
His son, daughter and grandson, also attended the
University.
A memorial service will be held at Memorial
Church at 1 p.m. on Friday.
