# CS department utilizes videotaped instruction

Technology is eliminating the need for live
instruction in the classroom. Although the
option of viewing lectures on videotape has
been around for more than 25 years, inven
tions such as two-way video, the Internet and
broadcast television are making this phenom
enon increasingly widespread.
In a class employing the Broadcast Tu
tored Videotape Instruction (BTVI) method,
small groups of students view tapes of the
course at their own pace and are led by a
teaching assistant who may work with them
on problem sets or facilitate discussion.
Reaction to the increase in video lectures
has been mixed.
One benefit of BTVI is that more courses
can be offered to the students enrolled in
summer quarter.
For example, the computer science depart
ment will offer four courses — CSI2I, CSI43,
CSI93D, and CS24OA — to students during
the summer quarter that would otherwise not
be available, said Claire Stager, the adminis

trator for the educational affairs division of
computer science.
According to Stager, the absence of faculty
members during the summer is the reason
the department uses videotapes of lectures
from previous quarters.
Some students argue that even with a
teaching assistant, videotapes cannot com
pare to live instruction. Resident computer
coordinator Matt Blythe said, "You don't get
as much out of the experience. People tend to
tune things out when watching television, so
it would be harder to concentrate as well."
Another RCC, Erik Chen, said that "many
would find it too informal."
Stager said live instruction would be the
preferable way to teach a class, but students
have repeatedly said they would prefer BTVI
over not taking the class at all. This system is
used during the summer on a very occasional
basis and is not extended into the regular
school year, she added.
