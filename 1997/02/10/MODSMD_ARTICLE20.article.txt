LOS ANGELES — Stanford
knew it had its work cut out before
embarking on a recently concluded
stretch that took it to California,
USC and UCLA for a trio of gruel
ing road games. Now the 18th
ranked Cardinal has its work cut
out for the rest of the season.
With Saturday's 87-68 loss to
UCLA, Stanford's third straight,
the Cardinal is suddenly tied with
Washington for fifth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference and fighting
for its NCAA tournament life.
With the home stretch just ahead,

that received a 109-61 spanking
last month at Maples Pavilion, got

and an aggressive effort on
defense. They out-rebounded the
Cardinal 36-28, shot a scorching
58 percent (to Stanford's 39 per
cent) and had six players score in
double figures, led by forward
Charles O'Bannon, who racked up
23 points and 12 rebounds, both
game highs.
"That was a good UCLA team
we played," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I don't
