## Women dominate, men falter against the Bruins Men stumble at Pauley 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Stanford
knew it had its work cut out before
embarking on a recently concluded
stretch that took it to California,
USC and UCLA for a trio of gruel
ing road games. Now the 18th
ranked Cardinal has its work cut
out for the rest of the season.
With Saturday's 87-68 loss to
UCLA, Stanford's third straight,
the Cardinal is suddenly tied with
Washington for fifth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference and fighting
for its NCAA tournament life.
With the home stretch just ahead,
Stanford must finish with a flour
ish if it hopes to gain the favor of
the NCAA selection committee.
The Cardinal certainly didn't
win points with its performance
Saturday afternoon before a sell
out crowd of 12,378 at UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion. Stanford (13-6, 6-
5 Pac-10), plagued by inconsistent
shooting for the third game in a
row, couldn't keep pace with a
UCIjV team playing some of its
best team basketball of the season,
and the result was a 19-point loss.
The Bruins (13-7, 8-3), looking
like a different team from the one
that received a 109-61 spanking
last month at Maples Pavilion, got
good ball movement on offense
and an aggressive effort on
defense. They out-rebounded the
Cardinal 36-28, shot a scorching
58 percent (to Stanford's 39 per
cent) and had six players score in
double figures, led by forward
Charles O'Bannon, who racked up
23 points and 12 rebounds, both
game highs.
"That was a good UCLA team
we played," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I don't

know that I've seen them play any
better than that at any point in
time during the season.
"It's tough to win on the road —
it's tough to win anywhere —
when you're shooting 30 percent.
We pretty much got outplayed
today."
Perhaps most impressive was
UCLA's defensive effort. Having
scrapped the loose zone that
allowed the Cardinal to rain three
pointers in its earlier win, the Bru
ins slowed Stanford with a full
court press and forced the Cardinal
into a season-high 20 turnovers.
It wasn't working at the outset,
though. Stanford came out with
the hot hand, as a pair of treys
from sophomores Kris Weems and
Arthur Lee helped the Cardinal to
a 10-2 lead, evoking memories of
the 17-1 run that ignited the
blowout in Maples. But the Brums
responded with a 10-point burst
that put them ahead 12-10, and
UCLA trailed again only once.
By halftime the Bruins had
pushed the lead to seven. A 10-0
second-half run — punctuated by
a Jelani McCoy slam dunk on a 3-
on-1 fast break — gave UCLA a

17-point lead and took the wind
of out of Stanford's sails. From
that point on, the Cardinal got no
closer than 10.
"Every time we got in a situa
tion where we were [down by] 11 or
nine, we would make a mistake, or
they'd bury a shot, or we'd put
them on the line," Montgomery
said, "Then it just seemed to take
the momentum away from us."
Brevin Knight was again a vic
tim of tiying to do too much him
self, as the senior point guard was
pressured into nine turnovers, to
just five assists. It didn't help that
the Cardinal shot under 40 percent
for the third game in a row and
fifth time in seven games.
"We've got to get some confi
dence back," Montgomery said.
"The great elixir is shots going
down for you. When shots don't go
down, it puts a lot of pressure on
the seams of your basketball
team."
Sophomore Tim Young also had
a tough outing for the third game
in a row, as UCLA limited the 7-
foot-1 center to just three points on
l-of-7 shooting.
"He's struggling," Mont
gomery said. "For us to win, Tim
Young's got to play well. The
whole team knows that, he knows
that, and he will.
"We've either got to be stronger

inside, or we've got to be better
shooting the ball from the perime
ter, or we've got to defend better —
[we've] got to find something to
hang our hat on. Right now we
don't really have anything that I
can say we were doing exceptional
ly well."
Stanford can at least take solace
in the fact that five of its seven
remaining Pac-10 games are at
home, beginning with Thursday
night's matchup against Oregon.
Of those seven, the Cardinal won
six last season, with the lone loss at
Washington, 74-71.
"You can't get too down because
this is the most competitive,
wildest, wackiest Pac-10 Confer
ence in over a decade," said UCLA
coach Steve Lavin. "This race is
going to come down to the last
weekend of the season. Seven
teams have a chance for the post
season tournament; seven teams
have an opportunity for a Pac-10
championship, and that's what
makes it so exciting.
"I don't even think that (Stan
ford isl really playing poor basket
ball right now; it's just they've hit a
rough stretch where they've lost
some tough games and some close
games, and that's what makes this
league unbelievable this year. It's
not like the past, where you have
two or three teams that go 16-2,

15-3, 14-4 and then the bottom
seven. Now you've just got 10 com
petitive teams."

know that I've seen them play any
better than that at any point in
time during the season.
"It's tough to win on the road —
it's tough to win anywhere —
when you're shooting 30 percent.
We pretty much got outplayed
today."
Perhaps most impressive was
UCLA's defensive effort. Having
scrapped the loose zone that
allowed the Cardinal to rain three
pointers in its earlier win, the Bru
ins slowed Stanford with a full
court press and forced the Cardinal
into a season-high 20 turnovers.
It wasn't working at the outset,
though. Stanford came out with
the hot hand, as a pair of treys
from sophomores Kris Weems and
Arthur Lee helped the Cardinal to
a 10-2 lead, evoking memories of
the 17-1 run that ignited the
blowout in Maples. But the Brums
responded with a 10-point burst
that put them ahead 12-10, and
UCLA trailed again only once.
By halftime the Bruins had
pushed the lead to seven. A 10-0
second-half run — punctuated by
a Jelani McCoy slam dunk on a 3-
on-1 fast break — gave UCLA a

17-point lead and took the wind
of out of Stanford's sails. From
that point on, the Cardinal got no
closer than 10.
"Every time we got in a situa
tion where we were [down by] 11 or
nine, we would make a mistake, or
they'd bury a shot, or we'd put
them on the line," Montgomery
said, "Then it just seemed to take
the momentum away from us."
Brevin Knight was again a vic
tim of tiying to do too much him
self, as the senior point guard was
pressured into nine turnovers, to
just five assists. It didn't help that
the Cardinal shot under 40 percent
for the third game in a row and
fifth time in seven games.
"We've got to get some confi
dence back," Montgomery said.
"The great elixir is shots going
down for you. When shots don't go
down, it puts a lot of pressure on
the seams of your basketball
team."
Sophomore Tim Young also had
a tough outing for the third game
in a row, as UCLA limited the 7-
foot-1 center to just three points on
l-of-7 shooting.
"He's struggling," Mont
gomery said. "For us to win, Tim
Young's got to play well. The
whole team knows that, he knows
that, and he will.
"We've either got to be stronger

inside, or we've got to be better
shooting the ball from the perime
ter, or we've got to defend better —
[we've] got to find something to
hang our hat on. Right now we
don't really have anything that I
can say we were doing exceptional
ly well."
Stanford can at least take solace
in the fact that five of its seven
remaining Pac-10 games are at
home, beginning with Thursday
night's matchup against Oregon.
Of those seven, the Cardinal won
six last season, with the lone loss at
Washington, 74-71.
"You can't get too down because
this is the most competitive,
wildest, wackiest Pac-10 Confer
ence in over a decade," said UCLA
coach Steve Lavin. "This race is
going to come down to the last
weekend of the season. Seven
teams have a chance for the post
season tournament; seven teams
have an opportunity for a Pac-10
championship, and that's what
makes it so exciting.
"I don't even think that (Stan
ford isl really playing poor basket
ball right now; it's just they've hit a
rough stretch where they've lost
some tough games and some close
games, and that's what makes this
league unbelievable this year. It's
not like the past, where you have
two or three teams that go 16-2,

15-3, 14-4 and then the bottom
seven. Now you've just got 10 com
petitive teams."

LOS ANGELES — Stanford
knew it had its work cut out before
embarking on a recently concluded
stretch that took it to California,
USC and UCLA for a trio of gruel
ing road games. Now the 18th
ranked Cardinal has its work cut
out for the rest of the season.
With Saturday's 87-68 loss to
UCLA, Stanford's third straight,
the Cardinal is suddenly tied with
Washington for fifth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference and fighting
for its NCAA tournament life.
With the home stretch just ahead,
Stanford must finish with a flour
ish if it hopes to gain the favor of
the NCAA selection committee.
The Cardinal certainly didn't
win points with its performance
Saturday afternoon before a sell
out crowd of 12,378 at UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion. Stanford (13-6, 6-
5 Pac-10), plagued by inconsistent
shooting for the third game in a
row, couldn't keep pace with a
UCIjV team playing some of its
best team basketball of the season,
and the result was a 19-point loss.
The Bruins (13-7, 8-3), looking
like a different team from the one
that received a 109-61 spanking
last month at Maples Pavilion, got
good ball movement on offense
and an aggressive effort on
defense. They out-rebounded the
Cardinal 36-28, shot a scorching
58 percent (to Stanford's 39 per
cent) and had six players score in
double figures, led by forward
Charles O'Bannon, who racked up
23 points and 12 rebounds, both
game highs.
"That was a good UCLA team
we played," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I don't
