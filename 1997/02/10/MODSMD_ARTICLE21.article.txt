# No. 1 spikers fall
## Cardinal loses at USC, beats 49ers in three games 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The weekend was a true mix of good and bad for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team. In splitting this Southern Califor
nia road trip, the team (5-1) pushed its record to 3-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Friday's match against
USC was the low point for the team in the young season, while
Saturday's match, when the team played well, was quite a
high.
Facing a tough USC squad and playing in the hallowed halls
of North Gym, possibly the toughest gym the Cardinal will
play in this year, Stanford dropped its first match of the sea
son. The game scores, 5-15, 15-8, 15-8, 15-13, are very indica
tive of the way in which the match was played. Stanford came
out very strong in game one, quickly moving out to a big lead
and cruising to a easy victory. After game one, it appeared that
the evening's play would provide yet another romp by the Car
dinal juggernaut. However, the tone of the match changed
drastically.
Right from the start of game two, the Trojans (4-3, 3-1

MPSF) asserted themselves. Stanford failed to respond to the
increased intensity of USC, resulting in the Trojans' easy vic
tory in game two. The third game followed essentially the same
pattern, as Stanford again struggled while USC took advan
tage of error-laden play by the Cardinal, cruising to another
easy win. While Stanford put up more of a fight in game four,
it was too little too late. Once the USC machine got rolling, the
team's confidence grew, and it was able to withstand a late
Cardinal rally to prevail.
The Cardinal's loss to USC was a combination of solid play
by the Trojans and sloppy play by Stanford. While USC did not
play spectacularly, it made far fewer mistakes than the Cardi
nal. Stanford, on the other hand, played quite poorly, particu
larly in its service game. Unlike past matches, the strong jump
serving that the Cardinal offense has come to rely on started to
falter.
The usual abundance of aces was replaced by a heap of
errors (29) in Stanford's service game. The result of the Cardi
nal's subpar serving was that USC gained many free sideouts,
preventing Stanford from ever
really getting on track.
"Although USC played pretty
well, we really hurt ourselves
with our service game," said
assistant coach John Kosty. "In
the past, we look to have one or
two errors for every ace; this time
our number of aces was not
enough to overcome the great
number of hitting errors."
While the match against USC
showed what can happen if Stan

ford is off its game, the match
against Long Beach (7-2, 2-2
MPSF) was proof of just how good
Stanford can be. After serving vir
tually cost it the match against
USC, the Cardinal abandoned its
riskier jump serves in favor of
more cautious floaters. This
change proved to be the real differ
ence in the match, as the Cardinal
coasted to a relatively easy victory,
15-7, 15-11, 15-11 in the Pyramid.
While easy, the match was not
without its tense moments. Since
the 49ers refused to let the Cardi
nal pull away early, trading the
lead until the middle of every
game, Stanford had to draw on

reserve players to turn the tide in
all three games. Junior outside
hitter Tad Hoffman came into
game two at a critical juncture
and right away made a stuff block
to give the Cardinal its 13th point
and shift the momentum to its
side. In addition to Hoffman,
sophomore setter Jeremy Bart
and junior setter Tyler Neal, both
defensive specialists, really
sparked the Cardinal, contribut
ing crucial digs in all three games.
"It was a really good team
effort," Kosty said. "We hit .429
as a team, and really spread our
offense around. Our bench also
gave us a huge boost."
