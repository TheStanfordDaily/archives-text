# No. 1 spikers fall
## Cardinal loses at USC, beats 49ers in three games 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The weekend was a true mix of good and bad for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team. In splitting this Southern Califor
nia road trip, the team (5-1) pushed its record to 3-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Friday's match against
USC was the low point for the team in the young season, while
Saturday's match, when the team played well, was quite a
high.
Facing a tough USC squad and playing in the hallowed halls

and cruising to a easy victory. After game one, it appeared that
the evening's play would provide yet another romp by the Car

Right from the start of game two, the Trojans (4-3, 3-1

MPSF) asserted themselves. Stanford failed to respond to the
increased intensity of USC, resulting in the Trojans' easy vic

pattern, as Stanford again struggled while USC took advan

easy win. While Stanford put up more of a fight in game four,
it was too little too late. Once the USC machine got rolling, the
team's confidence grew, and it was able to withstand a late
Cardinal rally to prevail.
The Cardinal's loss to USC was a combination of solid play
by the Trojans and sloppy play by Stanford. While USC did not
play spectacularly, it made far fewer mistakes than the Cardi
nal. Stanford, on the other hand, played quite poorly, particu
larly in its service game. Unlike past matches, the strong jump
serving that the Cardinal offense has come to rely on started to
falter.
The usual abundance of aces was replaced by a heap of
errors (29) in Stanford's service game. The result of the Cardi
nal's subpar serving was that USC gained many free sideouts,
