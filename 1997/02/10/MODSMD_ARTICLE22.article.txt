# Gymnasts finish 2nd in tri-meet
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team (2-6) stepped it up
a notch last Friday.
The squad produced a seasonal record of 195.325 — a score
even last year's skilled team, which placed ninth in the NCAA
Championships, was not able to mark until the end of the sea
son. The score placed the Cardinal gymnasts a close second
behind No. 10 Arizona State and ahead of the UC-Santa Bar
bara Gauchos by more than five points.
Although the team members this year have set school
records on the vault and enjoyed several individual all-around
victories, team inconsistency has forced them to struggle
through the first half of the season.
With this latest triumph, however, the gymnasts agree that
the Stanford squad is now finally set to go.

"Our energy went up from event to event," said freshman
Tara LaMarte, who electrified the crowd with a 9.8 perfor
mance on the floor. "For the first time, we got the crowd total
ly into our routines. The energy we had on the floor exercise is
something we've never experienced before."
The excitement among the home crowd surged with every
exceptional Stanford routine; as the Cardinal rotated from one
event to the next, the crowd rose to its feet and rode on the
Cardinal wave with the talented gymnasts.
On the vault, junior co-captain Keri Monahan, who was
crowned the all-around category queen with a total of 39.425
points, set the team off to a strong start with a 9.9 perfor
mance.
No Cardinal scored lower than a 9.7 on the apparatus, and
Stanford took the event title with an amazing 49.150

sa Fontaine shined throughout
the night, waiving the Card's next
challenge on the bars with an out
standing 9.875.
The squad finally proved its
power and potential on the next
event, the difficult balance beam,
which has kept the Card from
many team victories this season.
All six gymnasts looked confi
dent and stayed on the four-inch
apparatus, an accomplishment
the Card has not been able to
achieve all season.
"We've been having lots of
mental training all week, and it
showed tonight," assistant coach
Robert Shawler said. "We finally
did what we were supposed to do."
After several frustrating meets
in which the Cardinal was forced
to contend with results that did
not reflect its smooth perfor
mances in practice, the squad
decided last week that it needed to
upgrade its overall confidence
level to increase team consistency.
Throughout the week, the
gymnasts underwent intense psy
chological training, spending the
last portion of their daily four
hour practice on a series mental
exercises and on image training
outside the gym.
Its consistent team perfor
mance on the beam proved the
squad's psychological approach
has paid off. Even in the tri-meet,
where the contestants had to deal
with blaring floor music and a big
ger crowd, it would have taken a
7.0-magnitude earthquake to dis
tract the Cardinal from its 9.6 and
9.7 performances.
"I don't have a clue what was
playing when I was performing,"
said sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami, who finished third in
the all-around with 39.125 total
points. "If you're confident
enough, you can block everything
out. The mental training definite
ly helped us stay focused."
The mounting energy the Caru
possessed going into its last event
overtook the Sun Devils' vivacity
and zeal on the vault; the Arizona
State team suffered a series of
falls while the Stanford gymnasts

dominated the floor exercise.
Monahan, scoring an amazing
9.95, sent out ripples of excite
ment together with Murakami
and sophomore Tracey Kohl's 9.9
routines. Sophomore Katie Fitz
patrick's sophisticated perfor
mance further rocked the thrilled
crowd.
Team members and coaches of
the two visiting teams matched
Stanford's enthusiasm and agreed
that the meet was a huge success.
"We had a lot of fun here,"
Gauchos freshman Dawn
Taniguchi said. "The big crowd
was very exciting."
"We really enjoyed ourselves,"
said Gauchos coach Randy Lane.
"Stanford is a great team, and I
am happy and pleased with our
performance against them."
Arizona State head coach
John Spini said that his team's
victory was especially sweet after
the last-minute Cardinal-Sun
Devil struggle.

"I thought [Stanford] nearly
took us at the end, when we were
having problems on the vault and
[Stanford] was rocking on the
floor," Spini said. "I was really
happy with our performance; I was
also very impressed with Stanford
and really happy to see the gym
nastics program here so strong."
Murakami said the team will
only get stronger.
"It was much better but not
even our fullest potential,"
Murakami said. "We weren't as
solid, confident and fluid as we
could be. All we have to do is to get
the look — the confidence — con
sistently, and we're set to go."
Head coach Lisa Izzi sees this
meet as step one of a successful
postseason run.
"This was a really good confi
dence booster for us, and we real
ly needed it," Izzi said. "The girls
really connected as a team, felt
each other's determination and
support."
