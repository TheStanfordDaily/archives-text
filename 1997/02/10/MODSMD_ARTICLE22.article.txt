# Gymnasts finish 2nd in tri-meet

The Stanford women's gymnastics team (2-6) stepped it up
a notch last Friday.
The squad produced a seasonal record of 195.325 â€” a score
even last year's skilled team, which placed ninth in the NCAA
Championships, was not able to mark until the end of the sea
son. The score placed the Cardinal gymnasts a close second
behind No. 10 Arizona State and ahead of the UC-Santa Bar
bara Gauchos by more than five points.
Although the team members this year have set school
records on the vault and enjoyed several individual all-around
victories, team inconsistency has forced them to struggle
through the first half of the season.
With this latest triumph, however, the gymnasts agree that
the Stanford squad is now finally set to go.

"Our energy went up from event to event," said freshman
Tara LaMarte, who electrified the crowd with a 9.8 perfor
mance on the floor. "For the first time, we got the crowd total
ly into our routines. The energy we had on the floor exercise is
something we've never experienced before."
The excitement among the home crowd surged with every
exceptional Stanford routine; as the Cardinal rotated from one
event to the next, the crowd rose to its feet and rode on the
Cardinal wave with the talented gymnasts.
On the vault, junior co-captain Keri Monahan, who was
crowned the all-around category queen with a total of 39.425
points, set the team off to a strong start with a 9.9 perfor
mance.
No Cardinal scored lower than a 9.7 on the apparatus, and
Stanford took the event title with an amazing 49.150
