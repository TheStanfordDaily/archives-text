# Women continue Pac-10 dominance in basketball
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
On a night that saw the elec
tronic scoreboard go on the fritz,
the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team kept ticking like fine
clockwork.
The Cardinal (23-1, 11-0 Pacific
10 Conference), clearly starting to
tune up for tournament play,
methodically embarrassed and
humiliated UCLA (10-10, 4-7) on
Saturday night 98-68 before a sell
out crowd of 7,391.
Senior guard Kate Starbird,
coming off a quiet 14-point game
against USC, returned to her perch
atop the scoring list, pacing Stan
ford with 29 points. Junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard (13 points,
11 rebounds) and senior point
guard Jamila Wideman (16 points,

10 assists, one off her career high)
posted double-doubles for Stanford
as it ran away with its 44th
straight home win.
"I didn't feel like we shot that
well, actually," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Different people stepped up. I
though it was a really big night
for Heather (Owen) and Charmin
(Smith) helping us out. Kate did
her usual, not that I take it fur
granted. I don't think it was that
great a game for Kate, by her
standards."
From the outset, it was painful
ly obvious that the Bruins missed
the services of sophomore point
guard Erica Gomez. UCLA shot a
sizzling 64 percent from the floor
in the first half, but it made only
nine field goals. Meanwhile, Stan
ford nailed more shots (16) than
the Bruins attempted (14) in those
first 20 minutes. After UCLA
pulled to within a point 3 1/2 min
utes into the game on two Maylana
Martin free throws, what little
offense it had vanished for a
stretch of more than five minutes.
Seven turnovers were committed
by the Bruins in that stretch. The
Cardinal took full advantage,
stretching the score to 21-9 on a
Starbird layup.
The game turned into a run
away from there, as UCLA contin
ued to play in a fog, making sever
al unforced errors to the tune of 20
first-half turnovers and a 45-27
halftime deficit.
"I think we're easily 20 points
better with Erica Gomez," said
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier.
"I don't think she's necessarily
going to score for us, but she's a

leader and she gives other players
the confidence that they need."
The second half began with the
scoreboards blanking out, making
public address announcer Steve
Frost earn his money. It did not
make much difference for either
team, as Stanford continued
demoralizing the Bruins.
"I don't think [the broken
scoreboard] fazed us one bit," Star
bird said. "If it was a closer game at
that point, it would have been a lot
tougher on us."
Three driving layups by Wide
man in the first five minutes of the
half made it 55-38. A three by
senior guard Charmin Smith
added to the 13-1 run that made
the score 68-39 with 12:45 to go in
the game. While UCLA had only
14 turnovers in the second half, it
had four people foul out.
Also, the Bruins were getting
killed on the offensive glass,
grabbing only five rebounds.
Late in the second half, the score
board came back on, but only to
illuminate the slaughter on the
court.
