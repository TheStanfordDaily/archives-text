# Women hoopsters suffer no letdown
## 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
As the season enters its home
stretch, the nation's best begin
to rise to the top, separating
themselves from the masses and
elevating their performances in
preparation for the tournament.
And if this weekend's games
against the Los Angeles schools
are any indication, that's just
what the Stanford women's bas
ketball team (23-1, 11-0 Pacific
10 Conference) is doing.
The Cardinal displayed its

most dominating basketball of
the season this weekend as it
extended its home-game win
ning streak, currently the
longest active streak in women's
Division I basketball, to 44 (top
10 all time), its home-game con
ference consecutive wins to 54
and its Pac-10 streak to 38.
More importantly, Stanford
put together two solid perfor
mances and avoided any form of
a letdown in the second of a two
game weekend series. Numerous
times this season the Card has put
together a convincing performance
in its first game before displaying
lapses in play or a lack of focus in
its second (the loss to Old Domin
ion, Oregon State's second-half
run, the Massachusetts win fol
lowed by a close victory over unim
pressive San Francisco).
But after cruising to a win over
USC (15-5, 9-2) Thursday 103-69,
Stanford was relentless against the
Bruins (10-10, 4-7) Saturday, win
ning 98-68 without any signs of
letdown.
Not only is the Cardinal coming
together as a team, but the individ
ual performances of several play
ers have risen to another level as
well. Most notable is the play of
senior point guard Jamila Wide
man. Coming into the week Wide
man was averaging 6.3 points per
game, dutifully carrying out her
point guard duties of distributing

the ball for a team-leading 4.6
assists per contest.
Wideman's performance all sea
son has been definitive of a true
point guard but has occasionally
allowed opponents to collapse
around other players â€” especially
in the weeks following a sprained
ankle that led to her decreased
mobility. But Wideman's play
against the Los Angeles schools
seems to indicate that the ankle is
perfectly fine.
Wideman followed her season
high 24 points against the Women
of Troy with a 16-point exhibition
against the Bruins Saturday. The
mobility is back, and Wideman is
taking it to the hole more fiercely
than she has all season. Only one
of Wideman's five field goals came
from the outside (a three-pointer
two minutes into the game); the
other four were a result of Wide
man breaking down her defender
and putting the rock in the bucket,
twice drawing the foul and com
pleting the three-point play.
Wideman's penetration got her
to the line a total of six times,

where she hit all but one and
earned her second career double
double as she posted 10 assists to
go along with her 16 points. Wide
man also got four steals as she and
the Cardinal's tenacious defense
forced the Bruins into a whopping
34 turnovers, a season-high for
Cardinal opponents.
"Our team really stayed with
things," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "UCIA has a really t<d
ented, young team. But at this
point with our team, with our
experience and with our crowd,
and playing the kind of defense we
did forcing them into a lot of
turnovers, our defense was really
strong and we got some good tran
sition opportunities. Different peo
ple stepped up."
Finding a different person to
step up has become a strong suit
for the Cardinal. Senior guard
Kate Starbird "does her usual" as
VanDerveer says, but with the
injury situations Stanford has
faced this season, different players
have had to adjust and change
their roles.
