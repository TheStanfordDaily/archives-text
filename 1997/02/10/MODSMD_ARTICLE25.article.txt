Despite scoring 20 runs over three
games in this weekend's series againsi
Fresno State, the Stanford baseball tean
may have found the secret to success in it;
starting pitching.
"If our pitchers stay at this level, we'l
never lose another series. The pitching
couldn't have been better," said junioi
catcher Jon Schaeffer, who contributed tt
yesterday's 14-2 drubbing of the Bulldogs
with two home runs. He alluded to a stall
that allowed only four runs over three
games to Fresno State, leading the team to
wins in two of the three contests.
The stafT pitched a poorer series last
weekend at Cal State-Fullerton, where
Stanford gave up 20 runs to the Titans in
just three games, but they were able to
rebound against Bulldogs.
"I am as happy today as I was disap
pointed afler the Fullerton series," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "I don't think
we could ask for a better effort than we got
this weekend."
In Friday night's 6-1 victory, junior
Kyle Peterson started opposite Fresno's
sophomore ace Jeff Weaver, a bronze
medal winning Olympian and preseason
All-American.
"It was exciting going against Weaver; it
made me more psyched." Peterson said.
"But in the end, you have to concentrate on
the batters."
Concentrate he did, pitching all nine
innings and dealing the Bulldogs 17 strike
outs, the most by a Cardinal pitcher in sev
eral seasons.
"It just felt good," Peterson said. "All
three pitches — the fastball, the curve and
the changeup — were falling where 1 want
ed them to."
Behind Peterson's stellar performance,
the Cardinal offense didn't have much
work to do. The team was able to get to

Weaver for a run in the first and another in
the second and cruise the rest of the way to
a 6-1 win.
"Friday night was Peterson's best per
formance as a pitcher," Marquess said. "It
really looked like two of college baseball's
best pitchers going head to head."
Despite the success of the hurlers this
weekend, the only game the Cardinal lost
was a bona fide pitcher's duel. Both teams
were held scoreless in Saturday's matchup
until the ninth, when the Bulldogs were
able to ride one hit to a win, 1-0.
Sophomore pitcher Jeff Austin had little
trouble cutting through Bulldog hitters.
Through the first eight innings, the only
time Austin was seriously threatened was in
the third But with the ninth came trouble.
Austin started the inning by inducing
Bulldog senior Derek Feramisco to ground
to second. But then up stepped the
formidable junior catcher Giuseppe Chiara
monte, who was batting .500 with 3 home
runs, 8 RBIs and a 1.143 slugging percent
age in four games before the series. He took
Austin's first offering and smacked it over
the left-field fence for a home run, breaking
the tie and putting the Bulldogs ahead 1-0.
Austin's next pitch received no better
treatment: Bulldog first baseman Derrick
Levingston homered it off of the scoreboard
in center.
But before Levingston had time to finish
his home run trot, the umpires had gath
ered at the mound. After a few moments of
heated discussion with Fresno head coach
Bob Bennett, they signaled Levingston's
home run void. Amid jeers and boos from
the visitor's side of the stands, the umpires
called Levingston to the plate once again,
saying that time had been called by first
base umpire Bob Eustes before Austin had
thrown the pitch.
Austin didn't get .mother chance against
Levingston. Marquess signaled to the
