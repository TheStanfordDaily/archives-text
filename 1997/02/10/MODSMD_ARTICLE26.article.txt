# Swimmers nipped by USC, bounce back to take Gauchos

### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swim team split
its two meets against USC and UC-Santa
Barbara at deGuerre Pool last weekend.
On Friday, a well-prepared Trojan
team handed Stanford its first dual meet
loss of the season 124.5-116.5.
The rich swimming tradition at Stan
ford and USC has made the annual dual
meet something of a spectacle each year.
USC's victory allowed them to be the
keepers of the Bell, the trophy awarded
to the winners of each season's meeting,
for this year.
"This meet is such a big rivalry," said
junior co-captain Tom Wilkens. "As cap
tain, handing the Bell over to the USC

captains was definitely one of the low
points of my career."
After Stanford won the 400-yard med
ley relay, senior Kevin Radvany won the
first individual event of the meet, the
1,000-yard freestyle, in 9:10.42 over
USC's former Pacific 10 Conference
champion Kent Johnson, who touched
second in 9:12.67.
The next event, however, brought
USC's first victory, as defending NCAA
champion Bela Szabados swam a 1:38.78
to win the 200 freestyle. However, Stan
ford sophomores Dod Wales and Justin
Ewers took second and third behind
Szabados and minimized the point swing
in USC's favor.
Things still looked good for
the Cardinal after the 50
freestyle, as Sabir Muhammad
stroked to a victory in 20.78. The
Stanford junior was backed up by
his teammate, junior Jed Crowe,
who tied USC's Lenny Krayzel
burg for second place in 20.87.
Touching in 21.13 for fourth
place was Claypool, to secure a
10-point swing in the event for
Stanford.
The next event brought victo
ry again for Stanford as senior
Matt Thomson outpaced USC's
Brad Francis 1:51.78 to 1:52.38
in the 200 individual medley.
The momentum changed after
the IM, though, as USC senior
Jeff Julian swam a personal sea
son-best by more than two sec
onds to win the 200 butterfly
over Stanford's Matt Pierce, and
then USC's sprinters Szabados
and Lance McPherson went 1-2
in the 100 freestyle (45.36 and
46.07). Stanford's top finishers
in the 100 free were Wales and
freshman Glenn Counts, who
touched third and fourth in 46.13
and 46.28 seconds, respectively.
The 200-yard backstroke fea
tured USC's summer national
champion Lenny Krayzelburg,
who won in 1:45.81.
Stanford hoped to mitigate the
damage in the 500 freestyle, in
which Radvany and sophomore
Matt O'Mara have been swim
ming well as season. But again

the rested USC team spoiled the
day for the Cardinal, taking first,
second and third places. Julian
won his second event of the day
in 4:29.00, and teammates David
Mecca and Johnson were second
and third (4:31.46 and 4:31.50).
Stanford had seen its early
lead slip away, and with two
events left, the Cardinal found
itself down 18 points, 102.5-84.5.
The meet was still winnable, but
Stanford needed to finish 1-2-3 in
the 200 breaststroke and also
take first and second in the 400
free relay.
The 200 breaststrokers for the
Cardinal almost kept the hope
alive, as Wilkens took first in
2:02.82 and was followed by
sophomore Blake Holden in
2:04.34. In the race for the cru
cial third place spot, USC's Chris
Mylan and Grzegorz Dolniak
overtook Stanford freshman
Steve Ronson to secure the meet
victory for the Trojans and ren
der the 400 free relay, which
Stanford won, inconsequential.
The Cardinal kept the USC
loss in perspective, knowing that
it will be ready for the champi
onship season next month.
"We lost a few key matchups
against USC, and it turned out to
be only an eight point victory for
them," Ewers said. "We don't feel
this meet shows the way things
will turn out at the end of the sea
son, but as far as bragging rights
and pride go, it is a tough loss."
The Cardinal swimmers were
back in the water the next day
against UC-Santa Barbara. '1 he
Gauchos came to deGuerre for

Stanford's last home dual meet
of the season, and the last time
the Stanford seniors swam in
front of the deGuerre crowd.
The Stanford victory over the
perennial whipping boy Gauchos
had highlights that kept it excit
ing for the crowd at deGuerre. In
his last meet in deGuerre Pool,
Stanford senior Jon Lischke
capped his career with a win in
the 1,000 free, stroking his way
to a 9:31.30.
"I was pleased with my race,
and it was exciting to have the
crowd behind me as I finished my
final home meet with a win and a
seasonal best time," Lischke
said.
Another highlight of the meet
included a first-place tie between
Blake Holden and Andre Salles
Cuhna in the 100 breaststroke.
Holden and Salles Cuhna fin
ished the race in 57.78, while
freshman Steve Ronson finished
third in 59.32.
Stanford was pleased with its
win over UCSB despite the disap
pointment of the USC loss.
"We had just finished a tough
week of training and the rested
Trojans caught us by surprise,"
Lischke said. "It was encourag
ing that the we were able to put
our fatigue behind us and pull
together to swim a strong meet
against Santa Barbara."
The Cardinal now turns its
focus toward final preparation
for the end of the season. The
men's final dual meet at Califor
nia precedes the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Long Beach and the
NCAAs in Minneapolis.
