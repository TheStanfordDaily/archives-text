# Swimmers nipped by USC, bounce back to take Gauchos

The Stanford men's swim team split
its two meets against USC and UC-Santa
Barbara at deGuerre Pool last weekend.
On Friday, a well-prepared Trojan
team handed Stanford its first dual meet
loss of the season 124.5-116.5.
The rich swimming tradition at Stan
ford and USC has made the annual dual
meet something of a spectacle each year.
USC's victory allowed them to be the
keepers of the Bell, the trophy awarded
to the winners of each season's meeting,
for this year.
"This meet is such a big rivalry," said
junior co-captain Tom Wilkens. "As cap
tain, handing the Bell over to the USC

captains was definitely one of the low
points of my career."
After Stanford won the 400-yard med
ley relay, senior Kevin Radvany won the
first individual event of the meet, the
1,000-yard freestyle, in 9:10.42 over
USC's former Pacific 10 Conference
champion Kent Johnson, who touched
second in 9:12.67.
The next event, however, brought
USC's first victory, as defending NCAA
champion Bela Szabados swam a 1:38.78
to win the 200 freestyle. However, Stan
ford sophomores Dod Wales and Justin
Ewers took second and third behind
Szabados and minimized the point swing
in USC's favor.
