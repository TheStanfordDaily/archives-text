# Top-ranked women swimmers squeeze by SMU, crush Texas
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
The Stanford's women swimming team (7-0, 4-0
Pacific 10 Conference) faced two spectrums of compe
tition in Austin, Texas, this past weekend — one chal
lenging, one not so challenging.
The undefeated Cardinal edged the Southern
Methodist Mustangs by its narrowest winning margin
this season, 200-172, meanwhile whopping the Texas
Longhorns by a significant margin, 260.5-111.5.
The second-ranked Mustangs caught the Cardinal
off-guard when it led by eight points after the first day
of the double dual meet. SMU shook the Cardinal's
confidence when its top swimmers swept first-place
honors in six of the eight swimming events Friday.
"We were totally fired up in the beginning but our
energy got kind of zapped throughout the [first day of
the J meet," said senior Sarah Anderson.
The Cardinal may have won the first Friday event,
the 200-yard freestyle relay, but it was SMU that stole
the show in the last event of the day. In the 400 med
ley relay, SMU's team bumped the Cardinal medley
squad from its first-place national ranking. Stanford's
A team, which consists of Olympians who each repre
sented a different country, posted its fastest time in
the event this season (3:41.31) but still fell short of
SMU's 3:40.39 finish.
The turning point for the Cardinal came on the sec
ond day of the meet. In the 200 medley, the Stanford
A team itched for revenge when it faced the same
SMU medley team that had beaten the Card Friday.

According to co-captain Anderson, senior sprinter
Claudia Franco's amazing freestyle finish helped
boost the lagging Cardinal spirit, leading Stanford to a
winning time of 1:42.15, two-tenths of a second faster
than its Mustang opponents.
"We're a driven group. When we looked across the
pool and saw a red SMU cap, we didn't let them beat
us," said Anderson, who made an NCAA qualifying
time in the 500 freestyle.
On Saturday, sophomore Kari Edwards stepped up
to win the 400-yard rM and also made qualifying
NCAA marks with a seasonal best of 4:17.26.
Junior Elin Austevoll won the 200 breaststroke
(2:13.48), beating out SMU's 6-foot-4 Katie McClel
land by a hundredth of a second.
Junior Michelle Collins, who recovered from shoul
der surgery last year, also posted a significant swim in
the 100 butterfly and 200 butterfly with two fourth
place finishes.
The SMU and Texas diving squads proved to be the
Cardinal's toughest competition this season. Despite
losing the one- and three-meter events, senior diver
Megan Gardner, last season's Pac-10 diver of the year,
clinched the 10-meter platform event.
Gardner stood backwards on the platform and
mentally pictured a perfect 10 dive before leaping and
spinning forward to nail her most difficult dive. It was
only the second time Gardner performed an inward
three and a half with a 3.2 degree of difficulty in com
petition.
"Of course I didn't get a perfect score, but it felt
really good to hit that particular dive," she said.
