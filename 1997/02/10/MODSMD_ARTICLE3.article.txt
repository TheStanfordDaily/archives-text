### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Institute for International Studies in
augurated the new European Forum at Stan
ford Friday with a speech by Werner Hoyer,
undersecretary of state in the German Foreign
Office.
With an emphasis on research and teaching
related to Europe, the forum seeks to encour
age the faculty and students to study European
issues. Its major research areas will include in
ternational political economy, international
security and conflict resolution and global en
vironment.
The forum will take over several functions
of Stanford's Center for European Studies,
which closed at the end of last year.
"The notion is to get a better focus," said
Food Research Prof. Timothy Josling, who
convened the forum with Law Prof. Thomas

Heller. Issues addressed by the forum's speak
ers and other activities will be more closely re
lated to research done on campus, he said.
Stressing the importance of research coop
eration, the forum will facilitate the interac
tion of scholarship on European issues with
other institute research groups and Stanford
programs.
"We believe that we can create a more pro
ductive educational context by grounding sem
inars, workshops and classes in ongoing re
search associations and incorporating teaching
into more structured academic programs,"
said the forum's organizers in a statement.
The forum was jump-started with Hoyer's
talk on Friday. A member of Bundestag, the
German parliament, since 1987 and a minister
of state in the Foreign Office since 1994, Hoyer
is an active participant in the European Union
