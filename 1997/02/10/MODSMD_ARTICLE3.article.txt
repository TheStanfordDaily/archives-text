## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Institute for International Studies in
augurated the new European Forum at Stan
ford Friday with a speech by Werner Hoyer,
undersecretary of state in the German Foreign
Office.
With an emphasis on research and teaching
related to Europe, the forum seeks to encour
age the faculty and students to study European
issues. Its major research areas will include in
ternational political economy, international
security and conflict resolution and global en
vironment.
The forum will take over several functions
of Stanford's Center for European Studies,
which closed at the end of last year.
"The notion is to get a better focus," said
Food Research Prof. Timothy Josling, who
convened the forum with Law Prof. Thomas

Heller. Issues addressed by the forum's speak
ers and other activities will be more closely re
lated to research done on campus, he said.
Stressing the importance of research coop
eration, the forum will facilitate the interac
tion of scholarship on European issues with
other institute research groups and Stanford
programs.
"We believe that we can create a more pro
ductive educational context by grounding sem
inars, workshops and classes in ongoing re
search associations and incorporating teaching
into more structured academic programs,"
said the forum's organizers in a statement.
The forum was jump-started with Hoyer's
talk on Friday. A member of Bundestag, the
German parliament, since 1987 and a minister
of state in the Foreign Office since 1994, Hoyer
is an active participant in the European Union
negotiations. He is responsible for
U.S.-The European Union relations
in the German government.
Hoyer attended last week's State
of the Union address and praised
President Clinton for including in
ternational issues that are not popu
lar in the United States.
In his talk titled, "Europe and
America: Partnership for the 21st
Century," Hoyer discussed the state
of modern Germany as well as some
of the problems facing Europe and
the global community in the new
world order.
Hoyer said Germans are enjoying
relative prosperity, despite distress
ing unemployment. Furthermore,
all nine of the nation's neighbors are
now "its friends."
According to Hoyer, Germans
would prefer to downplay their na
tion's role in Europe and become "a

big Switzerland." However, he sug
gested that such wishes are unreal
istic in light of the need for Euro
pean cooperation and the impor
tance of the deutschmark.
Hoyer also stressed the impor
tance of cooperation between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the European Union. NATO
generals, who quickly "adjusted to
new challenges throughout the
world," have little knowledge of Eu
ropean integration, he said.
A policy of placing the European
Union into the NATO context
would clarify Europe's relationship
with the United States, Hoyer said.
Even the continent's neutral na
tions have shown that they "shed
their reservations" about NATO by
joining the western states in peace
keeping in Bosnia, he added.
A frequent participant in inter
governmental the European Union
talks, Hoyer offered insight into
some of the structural problems fac
ing the union.
According to Hoyer, the principle

of "one man, one vote" would re
quire that more populous countries
have a larger role in the governance
of the European Union. However,
small nations are anxious about
being left out of the decision-making
process.
"We have not just an institu
tional question but a question of
democratic legitimacy," Hoyer ex
plained.
Decisions about structural ad
justments, as well as decisions about
common security policy and inter
nal justice, ought to be made before
the European Union expands to in
clude the states of Eastern Europe,
he said.
Hoyer predicted "growing even
bigger without making these seri
ous provisions would be a serious
mistake."
He said Europeans continue to
expect the highest standard of liv
ing, but the ability of the continent
to "put [its] act together" by the end
of the century may determine the le
gitimacy of this expectation.
