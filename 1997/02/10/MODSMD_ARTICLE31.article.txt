Organized to discuss the issue of access to
health care in America, the 11th annual Stanford
Health Policy Forum took place Saturday at
Fairchild Auditorium.
The forum, titled "Standing at the Gates of
Health Care: Who Shall Pass?," was organized by
medical students of the Stanford Health Policy
Forum. The all-day conference drew about 200
people, evenly split among medical and public
health students, physicians and the general public.
Among the schools represented at the forum were
San Jose State University, UC-San Francisco and
UC-Berkeley.
"We're trying to highlight current issues to
stimulate discussions," said medical student
Sharon Dhanowa, one of the organizers.
Past forums have dealt with other local and na
tional health care topics such as ethical issues,
AIDS and national health care reform and have
featured prominent speakers such as former Sur
geon General C. Everett Koop.
Participants at Saturday's conference were en
thusiastic about the day's topic and the issues it
raised. "This is an exciting and relevant topic, and
it's great to see medical students out here," said Lau
rence Baker, assistant professor in health research
and policy and moderator of the panel discussion.
The event opened with welcoming remarks by
Elliot Wolfe, associate dean of the Stanford School
of Medicine. Two morning keynote addresses were
delivered; Jack Lewin, executive vice

president and CEO of the California Medical Asso
ciation, spoke first on "The Adolescence of Man
aged Care."
Lewin was followed by E. Richard Brown, direc
tor of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research
and professor of Community Health Sciences and
Services, who spoke on the topic of "Health Policy,
the Market and Access to Health Care."
After the keynote addresses, workshop sessions
were held, focusing on topics ranging from
Medicare reform to the government's role in fu
ture health care reform.
Molly Coye, executive vice president for strate
gic development at the Health Desk Corp. deliv
ered the afternoon keynote address on "The Fu
ture of Health Care Access."
The forum concluded with a panel discussion
and closing remarks.
Organizers of the conference considered it a suc
cess. "We're very pleased with the turnout and the
discussion stimulated by this conference," said
Dhanowa.
Attendants concurred with the organizers'
opinion.
"It's interesting. It touches on a lot of pertinent
and pressing issues, and it reminds me of the over
whelming task that needs to be accomplished,"
said Julie Cantor, a researcher in medical ethics at
UCSF and a Stanford graduate. "The workshops
were a good primer; they outlined the issues and
the challenges ahead.
"There weren't any big answers to the issues,
but it was good that they were brought up," she
said.
