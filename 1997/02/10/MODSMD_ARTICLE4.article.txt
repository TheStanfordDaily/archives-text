of the military.
"I am a part of something out
side of Stanford which gives me a
different perspective of how things
run in the world," said sophomore
Josephine Bernabe. "This is a good
experience with quality people."
In contrast to the business
world, the military already offers
financial equality for women.

A few weeks after the administration's decision not
to grant tenure to Akhil Gupta, his case has generated
not only student protest on campus but also a letter
writing campaign by scholars nationwide.
According to junior Aly Remtulla, who is active in
Undergraduates for the Tenure of Akhil Gupta, more
than 100 letters to the administration in support of
Gupta have come in from outside scholars at universi
ties such as Columbia University, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Chicago.
Gupta has substantial support from the Anthropol
ogy Department of the University of Chicago, where
five senior faculty, including the department head,
signed a letter to Stanford University President Ger

and other University officials.
According to Chicago Anthropology Prof. John Co
maroff, a former department chair, the focus of the
"strongly worded" letter was the "extreme upset" that
professors felt at the denial, given the high quality of
Gupta's work. Comaroff said Gupta's work would
make "a strong case for tenure anywhere in the world."
Michael Watts, director of UC-Berkeley's Institute
for International Studies, agreed, calling Gupta "the
central figure in a relatively new and important field."
Both Watts and Comaroff added that Gupta's work
is widely taught, and both said they had recently used
his material in class.
Watts explained that much of Gupta's work deals

plying them to empirical problems â€” in Gupta's case,
problems of development in India.
Chicago Anthropology Prof. Arjun Appadurai, an
other signer of that department's letter, agreed that
linking theory to real-world development problems is
"somethingGupta does unusually creatively and well."
Appadurai, Comaroff and Watts all characterized
the news of Gupta's rejection as "a shock."
"I simply could not possibly understand how some
one of his abilities could not be given tenure," Watts
said.
This shock was all the greater in manv cases because
