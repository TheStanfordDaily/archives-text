# Worried applicants
## State affirmative action policies raise concern among minorities 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Although recent statewide
changes in affirmative action poli
cies apply only to public institu
tions, students, parents and staff
have expressed concern that Stan
ford may be indirectly affected bv
the measures.
Despite a record number of ap
plicants, the percentage of "under
represented" minority applicants
to the nine University of California
campuses has dropped significant
ly this year, according to reports
from UC officials last week.
According to the San Francisco
Examiner, applications from
African Americans fell by 9.9 per
cent, Native Americans by 23.4
percent and Chicano / Latinos by
8.7 percent this year.
At the same time, the number of
Asian-American and white appli
cants rose by 6.2 percent and 5.2
percent, respectively.
These changes came in the wake
of the UC Board of Regents 1995
vote to eliminate racial preferences
and the November passage of
Proposition 209, which bans affir
mative action instate programs.
The affirmative action changes
will directly affect students apply
ing to enter the UC system in 1998.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano, said the new poli
cies in public education have
caused concern among parents of
minority applicants to Stanford.
"In the past, [parent! calls were
more often about why the tuition is
so high or about [financial aid), but
now they're more concerned with
whether their son or daughter will
actually have a fair chance of com
ing to Stanford if they are from a
minority group," she said.
Morales said many parents do
not realize that affirmative action
changes apply only to public insti
tutions. Stanford's open admis
sions policy does not take financial
status or ethnicity into account,
she added.

"I think [the misperceptions]
probably would discourage some
minority students from applying,"
she said.
But according to Dean of Under
graduate Admission and Financial
Aids James Montoya, applications
to Stanford from African-Ameri
can, Chicano / Latino and Native
American students — the three
ethnic groups included in Stan
ford's affirmative action plan — in
creased by roughly 2 percent over
last year.
Citing University President
Gerhard Casper's statement on af
firmative action in October, Mon
toya emphasized the University's
"commitment to enrolling a di
verse undergraduate student body

based on enrich
ing the education
al environment
for all students,
and based on
being faithful to
our mission to ed
ucate leaders for a
diverse and com
plex society."
Montoya said
Casper's state-

ment "sent strong messages to the
public . . . about our institutional
values. Perhaps this is why we
haven't experienced a decline in ap
plicants this year from minority
students.
"Proposition 209 will not im
pact our admissions process in any
way," Montoya said.
"What's important always for
students to understand is that the
focus of our evaluation of an appli
cant is to look at his or her individ
ual circumstances, and that is
across all ethnic lines," he said.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, UC officials are uncer
tain whether the drop in minority
applicants to UC schools is a reac
tion to affirmative action policies.
However, some UC officials said
the regents' vote may have sent a


Montoya
message to potential applicants
that the UC schools no longer wish
to be an inclusive institution.
Denni Woodward, director of
the American Indian and Alaska
Native Program Office, said the
changes in affirmative action
have caused confusion among
prospective applicants who "won
der if it was a sweeping ruling that
was going to affect Stanford.
"I'd like to hope that once it's
clarified [that the changes don't
apply to the University], that
won't affect the interest in Stan
ford," she said.
Woodward expressed concern,
however, that such rollbacks in
affirmative action might influ
ence applicants' personal state

ments.
"I'm hoping it doesn't discour
age people from talking [in their
personal statements] about the
full range of experiences they can
bring to this campus . . . [and]
ethnically and culturally specific
experiences . . . because that's
part of who you are," she said.
"If people assume that Califor
nia schools are no longer seeking
to meet affirmative action goals . .
. then they wouldn't know that
Stanford is still very much com
mitted to affirmative action and
diversity," she added.
Montoya also said the changes
in affirmative action policies
would require Stanford to empha
size its commitment to ethnic di
versity.
"I believe that high school stu
dents . . . will be watching this
year's admissions process very,
very closely, particularly at the

UC campuses.
"I don't underestimate the
added responsibility it puts on
Stanford to intelligently and
thoughtfully discuss issues of di
versity and to help all students —
but at this time particularly mi
nority students — understand the
special role they play by enriching
the academic community with
their presence," he said.
Tina Gridiron, assistant direc
tor of the Black Community Ser
vices Center, said while the
changes in affirmative action
would not directly affect Stanford
applicants, some students ex
pressed concerned about the pos
sible perception of California na
tionwide as an exclusive state.
"Given that we have not com
pleted a full cycle after the ballot
was passed, we don't know if
there will be indirect conse
quences," she said.
