## State affirmative action policies raise concern among minorities 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Although recent statewide
changes in affirmative action poli
cies apply only to public institu
tions, students, parents and staff
have expressed concern that Stan
ford may be indirectly affected bv
the measures.
Despite a record number of ap
plicants, the percentage of "under
represented" minority applicants
to the nine University of California
campuses has dropped significant
ly this year, according to reports
from UC officials last week.
According to the San Francisco
Examiner, applications from
African Americans fell by 9.9 per
cent, Native Americans by 23.4
percent and Chicano / Latinos by
8.7 percent this year.
At the same time, the number of
Asian-American and white appli
cants rose by 6.2 percent and 5.2
percent, respectively.
These changes came in the wake
of the UC Board of Regents 1995
vote to eliminate racial preferences
and the November passage of
Proposition 209, which bans affir
mative action instate programs.
The affirmative action changes
will directly affect students apply
ing to enter the UC system in 1998.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano, said the new poli
cies in public education have
caused concern among parents of
minority applicants to Stanford.
"In the past, [parent! calls were
more often about why the tuition is
so high or about [financial aid), but
now they're more concerned with
whether their son or daughter will
actually have a fair chance of com
ing to Stanford if they are from a
minority group," she said.
Morales said many parents do
not realize that affirmative action
changes apply only to public insti
tutions. Stanford's open admis
sions policy does not take financial
status or ethnicity into account,
she added.

"I think [the misperceptions]
probably would discourage some
minority students from applying,"
she said.
But according to Dean of Under
graduate Admission and Financial
Aids James Montoya, applications
to Stanford from African-Ameri
can, Chicano / Latino and Native
American students — the three
ethnic groups included in Stan
ford's affirmative action plan — in
creased by roughly 2 percent over
last year.
Citing University President
Gerhard Casper's statement on af
firmative action in October, Mon
toya emphasized the University's
"commitment to enrolling a di
verse undergraduate student body

based on enrich
ing the education
al environment
for all students,
and based on
being faithful to
our mission to ed
ucate leaders for a
diverse and com
plex society."
Montoya said
Casper's state-

ment "sent strong messages to the
public . . . about our institutional
values. Perhaps this is why we
haven't experienced a decline in ap
plicants this year from minority
students.
"Proposition 209 will not im
pact our admissions process in any
way," Montoya said.
"What's important always for
students to understand is that the
focus of our evaluation of an appli
cant is to look at his or her individ
ual circumstances, and that is
across all ethnic lines," he said.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, UC officials are uncer
tain whether the drop in minority
applicants to UC schools is a reac
tion to affirmative action policies.
However, some UC officials said
the regents' vote may have sent a
