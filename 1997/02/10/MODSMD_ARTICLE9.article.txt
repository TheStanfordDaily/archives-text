Clinton stumps for schools
WASHINGTON (AP) — In what
amounts to a pre-emptive political strike,
President Clinton is taking the education
policies he unveiled before Congress last
week to statehouses around the country.
Clinton hopes the appearances will win
over state lawmakers to help him prevail
against critics in Congress who complain
his program is too expensive and would rob
parents and educators of control.
The president begins his trek today in
Annapolis, Md., with a short visit to the
Maryland General Assembly. In the visit of
a few hours, he intends to deliver a speech
before legislators and chat with Democrat
ic Gov. Parris Glendening.
The White House says the trips are
designed to allow Clinton to discuss the

role states will play in shaping a transfor
mation in public education.
Haagen-Dazs goes diet
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Mmm - Haa
gen-Dazs ice cream is now low in fat.
After three years of development, the
world's leading maker of superpremium
ice cream will introduce Haagen-Dazs Low
Fat tomorrow — that's Fat Tuesday — at
a celebration in Tampa, Fla., one of the
country's top 10 ice cream markets.
The slimmed-down versions of vanilla,
chocolate, strawberry and coffee fudge are
already in Haagen-Dazs shops and will be
in grocery stores nationwide in April.
The new stuff has fewer than 3 grams
of fat per serving, about 80 percent less
than the company's regular ice cream.
