SZSH WEDNESDAY
Ecumenical Service
February 12,1997, Noon
Memorial Church
Various representatives from Stanford Community
Centers and Departments will come together for an
ecumenical Christian worship in which we will
acknowledge realities of brokenness in ourselves,
the communities of which we are a part, and our
world. The service will focus on prayer for healing,
forgiveness and strength to change. Representatives
from Ethnic Community Cemers, the Medical
Center, SLAC, ASSU, the Women's Center, the
Sexual Assault Response Team and many of the
campus Christian ministries are expected to
participate, and to share specific statements
regarding wounds, sins, limits and faults within
various Stanford communities. The paper on which
these statements are written will then be ritually
burned as a symbolic statement of our commitment
to healing and change.
Any one from the Stanford com muni ty
of any religious/spiritual/philosophical orientation
is invited to attend.
