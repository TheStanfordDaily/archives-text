Mitchell Madison Group
Global Consulting
On October 1, 1994, the twenty-five founders of Mitchell Madison Group established a new global
management consulting firm.
We are looking for a number of exceptionally talented individuals to help us create one of the most
prestigious management consulting firms in the world.
As a Business Analyst in our firm, you would be involved in all aspects of client service and practice
development. Over time you would develop a robust set of traditional problem solving and management
skills, while simultaneously facing the challenges associated with the establishment and global expansion of
a professional services firm of the highest stature.
We particularly encourage multilingual candidates, and individuals having non-traditional academic or
professional credentials to discuss career opportunities with us.
Irrespective of your role, much of your learning will occur within the context of continuous change.
Individuals seeking the types of experiences provided within an already well-established generalist firm
could find our environment too unstructured.
Please fax your resume no later than Thursday, February 13th to:
Attn: Trisha Iglesias
(212) 372-9008
We will be calling to schedule interview appointments on
February 13th and 14th.
Interviews will take place at the Stanford park Hotel on
Tuesday, February 18th.
