# Food, folks and fun
## Trustees dine in student residences 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
"Captains of industry" got a taste for college
life and dorm food when members of the Board of
Trustees ate dinner at student residences yester
day.
After a full day of meetings, trustees Denise
and Douglas Brown conversed with a
small group of residents from Castaho, the public
policy theme dorm.
O'Leary and Brown questioned students
about the University's housing policy. Changing
residences every year may lead to a "nomadic ex
istence" that undermines students' affinity for
members of their own class, Brown said.
However, Stanford realities may make long
term residences difficult to manage. Assoc. Polit
ical Science Prof. Luis Fraga, Castano's resident
fellow, pointed out that there is a wide disparity in
the quality of housing in different parts of the

University because residences were not all built
at the same time.
Senior Anne Brooks also suggested that
spending a quarter away from campus are popu
lar with Stanford students, making permanent
living arrangements less realistic.
Attempting to learn from the trustees' experi
ences, Brooks, who is in the middle ofajob search,
asked how they decided what to do after college.
Brown said he made "a contract with Uncle
Sam" and served in the army until graduate
school. He urged students who are not restricted
by large loans or other commitments to "try
something new."
Brown completed his undergraduate work in
history in 1959 and then returned to earn an
MBA. He now serves as president and chief exec
utive officer of Talbot Financial Services in Albu
querque, N.M.
"My father basically told me I was going to
work," said O'Leary, who studied industrial engi

neeringat Stanford. She is a former general part
ner in a Menlo Park venture capital company.
O'Leary urged undergraduates to "get off the
trade school track" because "there is a lot more
out there."
"It is such a great time in your lives to be able
to do something unusual," she said.
Trustees visited 12 undergraduate residences,
including each of the four ethnic theme dorms.
As the trustees proceeded to dinner, their ta
bles overflowed with Manzanita residents eager
to share their concerns and opinions.
O'Leary eagerly surveyed the students about
their pleasant surprises and disappointments in
Stanford life.
Sophomore Samantha Collins remembered
how happy she was to attend an Orientation re
ception for transfers, hosted by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper. "Basis for personal inter-
action" is crucial at a school the size
of Stanford, she said.
While all students praised resi
dential education, disappointments
ranged from administrative bureau
cracy and the quarter system to
roommate arrangements and un
dergraduate advising.
Senior Katarina Milicevic
praised her current advisers as
"guiding angels from heaven" but
mentioned that poor advice caused
her to make several mistakes in her
freshman and sophomore years.
Meanwhile, sophomore Bryan
Huang, a premedical student until
last Thursday, said he had to rely on
friends and advising associates for
help because his designated advisor
was not familiar with the courses he

needed.
A comment about perceived cor
ruption in the ASSU governing bod
ies drew enthusiastic agreement
from students.
O'Leary called student govern
ment leaders "a bunch of budding
politicos fighting for airtime."
Chuckles around the table revealed
that she was preaching to the con
verted.
Students also questioned
O'Leary about the role of the board.
Its focus is to find out "whether the
management is doing its job," she
said.
"It's tough in an organization as
complex as this to ever get a handle
on it," O'Leary added.
Although the bulk of the
trustees' work takes place in com
mittees, the full board is scheduled
to set the University's tuition
today.
A custodian of the University's

endowment and properties, the
board sets the annual budget and
oversees the investment *und.
O'Leary, who serves on the
board's Committee on the Medical
Center, described the merger be
tween UC-San Francisco Medical
Center and Stanford Health Ser
vices as a "really important step."
"Do you want to have lunch or be
lunch?" she asked, referring to the
increasingly competitive health care
industry.
As the trustees rushed off to yet
another event, Manzanita Dining
received compliments. "The food is
a lot better than what they used to
serve over at Wilbur," said O'Leary,
who lived in Cedro as an undergrad
uate.
The food here is still better than
Wilbur, the students responded in
unison.
Apparently, some things never
change.
