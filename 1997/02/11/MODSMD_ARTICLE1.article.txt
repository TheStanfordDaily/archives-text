# Food, folks and fun
## Trustees dine in student residences 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
"Captains of industry" got a taste for college
life and dorm food when members of the Board of
Trustees ate dinner at student residences yester
day.
After a full day of meetings, trustees Denise
and Douglas Brown conversed with a
small group of residents from Castaho, the public
policy theme dorm.
O'Leary and Brown questioned students
about the University's housing policy. Changing
residences every year may lead to a "nomadic ex
istence" that undermines students' affinity for
members of their own class, Brown said.
However, Stanford realities may make long
term residences difficult to manage. Assoc. Polit
ical Science Prof. Luis Fraga, Castano's resident
fellow, pointed out that there is a wide disparity in
the quality of housing in different parts of the

University because residences were not all built
at the same time.
Senior Anne Brooks also suggested that
spending a quarter away from campus are popu
lar with Stanford students, making permanent
living arrangements less realistic.
Attempting to learn from the trustees' experi
ences, Brooks, who is in the middle ofajob search,
asked how they decided what to do after college.
Brown said he made "a contract with Uncle
Sam" and served in the army until graduate
school. He urged students who are not restricted
by large loans or other commitments to "try
something new."
Brown completed his undergraduate work in
history in 1959 and then returned to earn an
MBA. He now serves as president and chief exec
utive officer of Talbot Financial Services in Albu
querque, N.M.
"My father basically told me I was going to
work," said O'Leary, who studied industrial engi

neeringat Stanford. She is a former general part
ner in a Menlo Park venture capital company.
O'Leary urged undergraduates to "get off the
trade school track" because "there is a lot more
out there."
"It is such a great time in your lives to be able
to do something unusual," she said.
Trustees visited 12 undergraduate residences,
including each of the four ethnic theme dorms.
As the trustees proceeded to dinner, their ta
bles overflowed with Manzanita residents eager
to share their concerns and opinions.
O'Leary eagerly surveyed the students about
their pleasant surprises and disappointments in
Stanford life.
Sophomore Samantha Collins remembered
how happy she was to attend an Orientation re
