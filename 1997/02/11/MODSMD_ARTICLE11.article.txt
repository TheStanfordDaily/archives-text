## Army suspends top soldier Reprimand results from sexual misconduct charges 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army suspended its
top-ranking enlisted soldier yesterday after the
woman who accused him of sexual misconduct pub
licly complained of a "different system of justice" for
the service's upper tier.
In explaining its decision, the Army said publicity
about the allegations against Sergeant Major of the
Army Gene C. McKinney made it difficult for him to
perform his job.
Meanwhile, a military official said the Army has
begun investigating a second case involving McKin
ney and a female sailor. The woman reported an alle
gation of harassment by McKinney to her supervi
sor, who then reported it to the Army, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"We don't know if there's anything to it. It's
being investigated," said the military source.
The Army, asked about the report, had no com
ment.
On Sunday, Army Secretary Togo West had
argued the case for letting McKinney continue in his
duties, although West said the issue was not fully
settled.
Yesterday, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis
Reimer issued a statement saying McKinney — his
senior enlisted adviser — had been assigned to the
Military District of Washington "pending resolution
of the allegations."
The step was taken one day after the accusing
woman, retired Sgt. Maj. Brenda Hoster, and two
senators said in television interviews that McKinney
should be suspended until the charges against him
are resolved.
Hoster, who had worked on McKinney's staff, last
week publicly accused him of having asked her for
sex, grabbed her and kissed her in a hotel room in
Hawaii last April during a business trip. McKinney
denied the accusation.
The two senators, Republicans Olympia J. Snowe
of Maine and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said it
was not enough that the Army had removed McKin
ney from a panel that is reviewing the Army's poli
cies against sexual harassment. They said it was
unjust that Army drill sergeants were suspended

immediately after they were accused of sexual mis
conduct but that McKinney was allowed to stay on.
"Certainly, everybody should be treated the
same," Snowe said. "If they're facing charges, they
should be placed under suspension."
In her television appearance Sunday, Hoster com
plained about what she said was the Army's unequal
treatment of McKinney and the drill sergeants at
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
"It seems like people in a higher position and at a
different level are exempt from those kinds of things
because the sergeant major of the Army is still per
forming his duties," Ms. Hoster said. "I don't under
stand why he gets a different system of justice."
In his announcement yesterday, Reimer said the
decision to suspend McKinney was taken "in the best
interest of the individual and the institution because
continued public attention made it increasingly diffi
cult for McKinney to fulfill his responsibilities."
At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry
declined to comment on the McKinney case. He said
President Clinton was "fully supportive" of the
Army's stated policy of zero tolerance toward sexual
harassment.
McKinney, the first black man to serve in the
influential post, has been the senior enlisted adviser
to the chief of staff of the Army since June 30, 1995.
The post is considered one of the most prestigious
in the service, since it represents the vast majority of
all soldiers at the highest levels of the Army. Only 10
men have held the job, which is considered one for a
role model.
The McKinney case has shaken the Army, coming
on the heels of a series of rape and harassment alle
gations that emerged last fall at Aberdeen Proving
Ground.
"The Army is aggressively taking all necessary
measures to eliminate sexual harassment and
improve the Army's ability to work effectively as a
team, in a manner compatible with traditional val
ues, equal opportunity and mutual lespect," Reimer
said.
The McKinney case is being investigated by the
Armv's Criminal Investigation Command.
