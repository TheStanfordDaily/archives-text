# McDougal repudiates testimony in private discussions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - His powder
blue suit and bald head conspicuous on
Capitol Hill, former Whitewater partner
James McDougal once appeared uninvit
ed to condemn President Clinton's
accusers as "gutless wonders" and
"moral cowards."
For years, he branded as liars those
who suggested that he or his former busi
ness partners, the Clintons, did anything
wrong. He threatened to sue a Republi
can congressman for "slanderous
attacks."
But now back in his Arkansas trailer
home, where he awaits a prison sentence
on Whitewater convictions, McDougal

has turned on the president.
As a cooperating v/itness, McDougal
apparently has recanted in private dis
cussions with prosecutors his own testi
mony from his criminal trial last year
and has tried to implicate Clinton in an
illegal loan.
If so, that would also impugn the trial
testimony Clinton provided to back up
his old friend.
What's more, in an interview with The
New Yorker magazine, McDougal aired
another allegation this week â€” that the
president had an affair with McDougal's
wife back in the 1980s. Susan McDougal,
now divorced, has denied the affair and

suggests her husband is lying to gain
leniency from prosecutors.
McDougal's re-emergence is unwel
come for a Clinton White House that is
busy trying to fend off criticism of his
party's fund-raising tactics.
But the legal significance of McDou
gal's cooperation with Whitewater inde
pendent counsel Kenneth Starr's investi
gation remains unclear.
How credible is the word of the
eccentric Arkansan, slowed by physical
illness and taking medication for
depression, whose ex-wife has accused
him of lying?
Testimony from McDougal against

either of the Clintons or anyone else
would probably have little value, says for
mer Republican U.S. Attorney Joseph
diGenova, who once ran an independent
counsel probe like Starr's.
But diGenova says McDougal might
turn over new documents, suggest fresh
witnesses or help investigators learn the
significance of documents already in
their possession.
"It really boils down to what is there
to corroborate what McDougal is now
saying," diGenova said. "When some
one's story changes, juries naturally have
a problem with that."
After unleashing a new round of

Whitewater speculation, McDougaJ was
coy with the cameras yesterday He
appeared briefly outside his trailer in
Arkadelphia, Ark., wearing a bright
green windbreaker, to tell reporters, "All
I have today is no comment."
The president's people refused to give
any of McDougal's new allegations a
response. David Kendall, Clinton's per
sonal attorney on Whitewater, said, "I
don't have any comment at all."
White House press secretary Mike
McCurry would say only that Clinton's
testimony in the Whitewater trial is a
matter of public record and"the presi
dent stands bv that testimony."
