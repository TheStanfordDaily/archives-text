# Simpson ordered to pay $25 million
## Punitive damages more than two times plantiffs' request 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - A
jury yesterday heaped $25 million in
punitive damages on O.J. Simpson for
the slayings of his ex-wife and her
friend, saddling him with more than
twice the debt even his pursuers say he
can pay.
The judgment is on top of $8.5 mil
lion in compensatory damages awarded
last week when the jury repudiated
Simpson's murder acquittal and found
him liable in the 1994 slashing deaths of
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman.
"Finding O.J. Simpson liable of the
murders and acting with oppression
and malice was one of the easiest deci
sions I have ever had to make," said
juror No. 11, a white woman in her 30s
who wasn't identified by name in a
news conference.
Jure. No. 266, a theater stage man
ager in her 40s, said she simply didn't
believe Simpson's testimony. "Every
thing as it related to the evidence — the
shoes, the hitting, where the gloves
were, the sweatsuit."
As for Simpson's claim he was
framed, juror No. 186, a white man in
his 20s, said: "There's just no way any
one could have planted all that evi
dence. It doesn't make sense . . . there's
no way."
The mostly white jury, contrasted by

the media with the mostly black jury
that acquitted Simpson of murder, said
race had nothing to do with its decision.
"We went by all the evidence and it
had nothing to do with the color of Mr.
Simpson's skin," said juror No. 400, a
white woman in her 60s.
"Anybody who comments on some
thing like that, without knowing what
we went through as far as what infor
mation we go through, are being essen
tially a racist themselves," said the
white man in his 20s.
Unlike the liability verdict, the deci
sion on punitive damages was not unan
imous. The only person with black
ancestry on the jury, a Jamaican-born
man who is half-Asian, was one vote
against punitive damages. He was
joined by one other juror who said she
voted against the amounts she felt were
a little high.
The only black in the jury box — an
alternate who didn't participate in
deliberations but did join the news con
ference — said she felt Simpson got a
raw deal.
"I felt sorry for the families, but I
felt they should still seek other people,"
said juror No. 295, who is in her 40s and
works for a medical company. "One per
son couldn't have done this by himself."
Simpson wasn't in court yesterday.
He hasn't been in court since the Feb. 4

verdict, though he has been seen play
ing golf.
The courtroom was hushed and
there were none of the outbursts that
marked last week's verdict. Fred Gold
man, the victim's father who had cham
pioned the civil court battle against
Simpson, sat silently wiping his brow.
His wife, Patti, and daughter, Kim,
showed little emotion.
Ms. Simpson's estate, whose benefi
ciaries include her two children now liv
ing with Simpson, was allotted $12.5 mil
lion of the punitive damages. Goldman's
father got another $12.5 million, while
his mother, Sharon Rufo, did not ask for
punitive damages. The long-divorced par
ents will split the $8.5 million in compen
satory damages for the loss of their son's
love and companionship.
"The money is not the issue," Gold
man said afterward, "it's making cer
tain that the man who murdered my
son and Nicole is held responsible —
that's happened."
"This was for justice," said Kim
Goldman. "We always knew the truth
would come out."
Added Goldman's attorney, Daniel
Petrocelli: "I thought it was important
to stand up to Mr. Simpson in front of
the jury, to call him a killer, to treat him
like a killer so the jury could call him a
killer."
