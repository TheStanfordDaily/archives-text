Air Force suspends training flights
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force suspended
all training flights over the Gulf of Mexico and the
East Coast yesterday after two new reports of close
encounters between F-IGs and commercial aircraft
over New Mexico and Texas.
Both of the close encounters occurred on Friday,
Air Force officials said.
The latest reports bring to four the number of
incidents that occurred over a three-day period last
week between the highly maneuverable fighter jets
and passenger airliners.
Air Force officials were at a loss to explain why
the rash of incidents had occurred, but the publicity
has focused attention on a situation of which most
people are probably unaware — that such so-called
deviations from assigned flight plans occur often —

more than 1,200 times last year.
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration
and the National Transportation Safety Board have
all four incidents under investigation.
The two new cases are in addition to incidents off
the coast of Maryland on Friday and off New Jersey
on Wednesday.
liate Friday, Air Force Chief of Staff Ronald Fogle
man suspended all training missions along the East
Coast and extended that ban on Monday to include
the Gulf of Mexico.
Croat gunmen fire on Muslims
MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Croat
gunmen fired yesterday on about 200 Muslims
visiting a cemetery on a religious holiday, killing
one person, wounding many and jeopardizing a

key element of the peace.
The attack was one of the worst outbreaks of vio
lence in Bosnia since the 1995 Dayton agreement.
The mayor of Muslim east Mostar, Safet Orucevic,
was beaten; the city's Islamic leader, Seid Smajkic,
sustained a minor gunshot wound.
"I heard noise and then shots. I felt something hit
me in the head," said Dina 45, who was
struck by a stone. "I turned around and I saw bodies
on the street brought down bv bullets '
Mostar, the scene of Croat-Muslim battles during
the war, is essential to the peace. If Croats and Mus
lims, who are federation partners, cannot cooperate
in the southwestern city they share, there is little
chance for institutions that also include Serbs.
An international presence has been unable to
reduce the hostility in Mostar, the scene of Croat-
Muslim battles during the war

Parcells to coach Jets
NEW YORK (AP) — Bill Parcells will take over as
coach of the New York Jets immediately under a deal
brokered yesterday by NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue.
New England will get New York's first-round
draft pick in 1999, the Jets' second-round pick in
1998 and their third- and fourth-round picks this
year. In addition, the Jets will make a $300,000 con
tribution to the Patriots' charitable foundation.
New England had insisted that the price for Par
cells would be the Jets' No. 1 pick this year — the top
pick in the NFL draft. New York had the worst record
in the NFL last season, going 1-15.
"'There were wide differences on how this would
have to be resolved," Tagliabue said. "But ultimate
ly, we got it resolved."
