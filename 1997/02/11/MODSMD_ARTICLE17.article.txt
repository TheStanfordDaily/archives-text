For students seeking
responsible investment,
SRE has let them down
JUST WEEKS AFTER a stu
dent-run Socially Responsible
Endowment fund was creat
ed, it has fallen apart. Junior
Brian Babcock, who organized the
campaign, claimed the movement
had "accomplished something very
important; it's time to move on."
But it is not clear that something
important was accomplished, and
moreover, this is not the time to
move on.
The Socially Responsible
Endowment fund was created
because students felt they could
not, in good conscience, donate
their money to a University which
does not invest its money in a
socially responsible manner. A pro
posal for the University to create
such a fund had been submitted by
a group of students and rejected by
the Board of Trustees' Special
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, the body that determines
Stanford's investment policies.
In soliciting donations for the
SRE fund, student activists that
the the independent fund would
hold all contributions in a portfolio
directed by a socially responsible
investment firm. Once the Univer
sity agreed to certain demands
articulated by the SRE fund's pro
ponents, they argued, the princi
pal and interest of the separate
endowment would be turned over
to the Stanford Fund.
The University has not met the
stated criteria for the fund's disso
lution, but those leading the
ASSU's "University for Students"
campaign have nonetheless decid
ed that a few compromises offered
by the University are sufficient
grounds for a change of heart.
Babcock and others have
declared their fight a small victory.
"We've accomplished as much

good as we can with social respon
sibility at the moment," ASSU
Vice President Nick Thompson
said. They collected 1,000 signa
tures in support of their cause and
$1,000 in donations, but these stu
dent activists are now ready to
move on to more practical goals.
All of which is well and good
when the activists are gambling
their own energies and money. But
once a pledge is made to a group of
donors, they assume some obliga
tion to follow through on their
promises rather than simply use
the money collected as another
bargaining chip. SRE's propo
nents have essentially acknowl
edged as much: They will not turn
over their fund's assets until all
donors have been contacted to
make sure they agree with this
change of plans.
The demagogic manipulation of
the students willing to out their
money where their mouths are
and support the SRE fund is not
surprising, however. Welcome to
the next installment of "Issue of
the Week."
The new goal, after socially
responsible investment, is achiev
ing greater student input. The old
goal, before socially responsible
investment, was a reform of U.S.
News & World Report's college
rankings.
The leaders of the SRE move
ment have betrayed those 1,000 sig
natories and the fund's many con
tributors and, more importantly,
the cause of socially responsible
investment. Even if they continue
their fight on less a controversial
topic like student involvement, they
still have damaged their credibility.
Such a legitimate issue as responsi
ble investment is being treated as a
game, and that is a disservice to the
students and this university.
It's unlikely the a halt of SRE
related efforts will influence the
Board of Trustees to adopt more
progressive investment policies;
instead, it once again proves that
students can be pacified with
small gestures.
