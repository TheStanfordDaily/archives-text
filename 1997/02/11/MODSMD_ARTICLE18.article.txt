'University for Students 9 challenges us to improve

IN HIS LETTER to the editor last
Thursday, University President Ger
hard Casper essentially agreed with
all four of the ASSU "Universities for Stu
dents" principles, albeit with significant
qualifications. That's great — it shows
that this dialogue is going somewhere.
Casper has a point — this is a great
university, and it does a lot of things
right. This does not imply, however, that
the University's policies should go
unquestioned or are beyond improve
ment.
By way of clarification, the principles
are meant to do three things: First, they
serve as an agreed-upon guiding philoso
phy for the different projects and cam
paigns coming out of the ASSU Presi
dent's Office; second, we hope they'll help
lead to more dialogue on campus about
University policy and the purpose of edu
cation; third, and most important, the
principles are meant to be a challenge to
the University to improve. Here are a few
specific comments on each one:
(1) "Universities were created for stu
dents." We applaud Casper's efforts in
creating freshman seminars and raising

funds for graduate fellowships, as well as
for meeting with students at "Tea and
Cookies" and his office hours. Programs
like Honors College, Sophomore College
and Undergraduate Research Opportuni
ties are great examples of how Stanford
serves students well. But there are still
many areas where student needs and con
cerns are neglected.
Take University support of interdisci
plinary programs, for instance. If 25 per
cent of undergraduates receive degrees in
interdisciplinary programs and these pro
grams consistently rate as some of the
best majors at Stanford, then why aren't
they better supported? It doesn't make
sense. Interdisciplinary programs at
Stanford are like the oak outside the
ASSU office that blew over last week —
they have very shallow roots and can top
ple with the next storm. Similarly, stu
dent groups are simply not adequately
supported — there is no space provided
for student groups except for at the Haas
Center for Public Service, and Stanford
still has no student union.
(2) "Universities are fundamentally
different than for-profit businesses." On

the positive side, this school does an
amazing job of subsidizing education and
research, not the least thing being need
blind admissions.
But at the same time, we see initia
tives and structures coming to Stanford
straight from the corporate world — con
solidation, outsourcing, streamlining,
downsizing — that can often conflict
directly with the educational mission or
culture of Stanford. The current struc
ture of the Board of Trustees, for exam
ple, is better suited to a company than a
university, with no student representa
tion and without any sort of democratic
election of trustees.
In addition, there often seems to be
more of a concern with the University's
public image than with the underlying
reality on campus. Casper made a bold
statement with his letter to U.S. News &
World Report Editor Jim Fallows, criti
cizing that magazine's rankings. He
argued that the rankings emphasize sub
jective, changing criteria and cannot cap
ture the quality of a university. But Stan
ford, along with other universities in the
Forget U.S. News Coalition, needs to

back that belief with strong action, with
holding data from the magazine until it
reforms.
(3) "Universities should not just pro
vide a private benefit. They also need to
work for the public welfare and be aware
of their social impact." Jane Stanford
argued this point in the Founding Grant,
saying that "while instruction must be
such as will qualify the students for per
sonal success and direct usefulness in life,
they should understand that it is offered
in the hope and trust that they will there
by be of greater service to the public."
In his letter, Casper made no mention
of the second side of this picture — edu
cation for public service rather than just
education as a public good. Examples of
how the University can strengthen its
commitment to this founding principle
include instituting a public service minor
and strengthening support for service
learning in the University.
In short, if we agree in principle, why
don't we agree in practice?
