# Taking military money is disguised hypocrisy
## 
### 
The issue of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps at Stanford is not really
one of discrimination but of money. The
University is perfectly happy to take mil

lions of dollars from the Department of
Defense for research grants and the
ROTC students' tuition. If, as Susan
Owen's Feb. 3 letter claims, the military
does violate University antidiscrimina
tion policy, then the administration
should categorically refuse all of this
money. Many people at Stanford, per
haps even Owen herself as part of the

Geophysics Department, benefit finan
cially from Defense Department funding.
The only people who suffer under
the current ban on ROTC are the hard
working women and men who could
not afford to come to Stanford without
their ROTC scholarships. Owen seems
to feel that allowing what in her view is
a discriminatory program hack on cam

pus is "blatant hypocrisy." However,
the current University policy is blatant
hypocrisy by, on the one hand, accept
ing money from the military hut on thi
other, denying its students the oppor
tunity for an on-campus ROTC pro
gram.
