# Roped in Freshman Kelly Holian is just a hop, skip and a jump away from game
## 
### Jessica Lan 
Anyone who thinks jumping
rope is for little girls at recess
has never seen freshman Kelly
Holian at work. Most little girls
can't fly three feet above the
ground with their hands
wrapped around their leg while
whipping a rope under their feet.
Who would think that this pe
tite, unassuming freshman is a
jump-roping demon?
"It's kind of hard, because a
lot of people just think you just
jump normally, and you have to
explain to them that it's not [like
that]," Holian said. "But most
people here have been very inter
ested in it."
Holian competes with her
team, the Coronado Speed Spin
ners, in the United States Ama
teur Jump Rope Federation.
Competitions are divided into
several different categories, in
cluding speed competition, team
competitions, double dutch,
pairs, individual competition
and single rope.
"The ultimate goal of the fed
eration is to bring jump roping
into the Olympics," Holian said.
"We're working toward the 2004
summer games."
Holian's two main focuses in
competition were pairs and sin
gle rope. In pairs, two jumpers
perform a routine simultaneous
ly, sometimes interacting with
each other. Currently, Holian
competes mainly in single rope
competition since there is no
team for her to practice with at
Stanford.
"So far, I haven't met anyone
at Stanford who jumps," Holian
said.
Individual competitions con
sist of several events, similar to a
gymnastics format. In single
rope, a jumper performs a chore
ographed routine.
The types of tricks in single
rope mainly involve two differ
ent elements: "crossing" and
"double unders." In a normal
cross, the jumper has her arms
crossed one over the other in a

straitjacket-like position. A dou
ble under is performed by rotat
ing the rope twice around while
the jumper is in the air.
In all events except for speed
competition, jumpers are judged
on the execution and difficulty of
tricks, as well as the artistic qual
ities of the routine, Holian said.
Deductions are made for mis
takes in routines, but given the
difficulty of the tricks, jumpers
are not generally expected to
perform perfect routines, Holian
said.
Even Holian's nationally
ranked team is not immune to
glitches while performing. Dur
ing one demonstration, her team
was supposed to slide out on
their knees with knee pads on.
"We hadn't tested [the slide]
on the floor we were performing
on, and one of my friends basi
cally did a face plant," said Ho
lian.
Deductions in competitions
are not the only reasons to avoid
mistakes. Because Holian uses a
plastic rope — the kind you al
ways have nightmares about
after gym class — and not a fab
ric cord, she is often left with
bruises and welts that she says
"last for weeks" if she makes a
mistake.
Even with these mishaps, Ho
lian has been victorious. In past
competitions, Holian earned
ninth place in the world with her
pairs partner and a third rank
while competing with more ex
perienced teams.
She also won second place
with her performance in the sin
gle rope competition at the Ju
nior Olympics in 1995, the first
year jump roping was included
at the event.
Holian hasn't always been a
whirling dervish. She didn't
even think of competing with a
team until she was recruited in
seventh grade by a family friend.
"It was just a favor to a
friend," Holian said.
