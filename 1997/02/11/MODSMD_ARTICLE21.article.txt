## Finding a solution 'outside the box' 
### 
Richard Zare

UNIVERSITIES
are traditionally
organized into
departments, and this
organization is more
than some quaint aca
demic custom.
A department pro
vides a home for schol
ars having similar inter-

ests. It keeps the truth and determines
the future directions of a field. A depart
ment is also the natural teaching unit,
particularly at the undergraduate level.
Indeed, to be a faculty member in a uni
versity and not a member of some depart
ment is usually to be a marginalized uni
versity citizen — lost, homeless and like
ly alienated.
I can attest to this fact from some per
sonal experience. In the late 1960s I was
on the faculty of the University of Col
orado as an assistant professor with an
untenured position supported equally by
the physics and chemistry departments.
It was a most disagreeable situation in
which I received twice as many commit
tee assignments, but each department
regarded me as the spy from the other
department.
To compound matters, my labs were
located in a wonderful research institute
called then the Joint Institute for Labo
ratory Astrophysics, a joint enterprise
between the University of Colorado and

the National Bureau of Standards which
is now known as NIST. When it came
time for a tenure decision, it was not
clear which department, if either, really
felt I was one of theirs.
Yet it is easy to recognize that some of
the most interesting intellectual chal
lenges we confront today occur at the
boundaries of disciplines or cut across two
or more disciplines. We need multidisci
plinary efforts to tackle these very tough
but important problems. Too often,
thinking restricted along departmental
lines is thinking limited to separate, dis
tinct boxes when the solution can only be
found by thinking "outside the box."
When you examine the support struc
tures available for such multidisciplinary
efforts, you are going to be sadly disap
pointed. Precious little real incentives
exist for multidisciplinary work. Fre
quently, the reward system in academia
flows through the departments, and
those engaged in research or teaching
that cuts across departments are consid
ered to be in danger of having strayed too
far from the fold.
The situation regarding external sup
port is not appreciably better. Once again
many government funding agencies are
organized around disciplines in spite of
the enormous amount of comment heard
how funding agencies encourage multi
disciplinary work.
There seems to be as big a challenge to

universities as there is to government
funding agencies to create appropriate
incentives for multidisciplinary efforts.
Too much of what we have today is some
crazy patchwork of ad hoc hocus pocus
when it comes to interdisciplinary pro
grams.
Not all research needs to be multidis
ciplinary, of course — not by any means.
But the paradox is how to allow such to
flourish while preserving the strength of
our departments. Only the existence of
healthy disciplines makes possible mean
ingful multidisciplinary studies. We can
not let the strength of our departments
diminish while we seek new cooperative
models.
Fortunately, Stanford is blessed with
low barriers between departments so fac-j|
ulty and students alike can easily move to
where they perceive the greatest intellec
tual challenges lie.
Compared to most modern universities,
this situation is the happy exception rather
than the rule. The cooperation between
departments is an aspect of the University
we need to nurture and to treasure.
This cooperation is real, and it does
make us especially agile in exploring new
intellectual horizons. It is a distinct part
of Stanford that contributes to the great
ness of this university.
