# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## ROTC lessons from Vietnam, parents and Sac State 
### 
IT WAS TWO weeks ago tonight that
the right honorable Senator Bruce
Cannon Gibney first brought a reso
lution before the ASSU Senate that, if
passed, would have requested that the
University invite the Pentagon's Reserve
Officers' Training Corps program back
onto the Stanford campus.
Gibney's measure was never acted on;
that night's meeting lost quorum —
quite unintentionally, of course — before
a vote could be taken, and then the bill
was withdrawn prior to the next meeting.
One was given the impression that
some sort of secret dealings between top
military brass and ASSU folks prompted
the bill's withdrawal. "I've become aware
of information," Gibney told The Daily in
his best conspiratorial tone, "that makes
it clear that for the sake of ROTC, it is
prudent to drop the issue."
ASSU Deputy Senate Chair Joe Fre
und, who formally removed the bill from
consideration, used even more opaque
phrasing in an e-mail to the senate list.
"Please trust me that any action on this
bill would be unwise at this point in
time," he wrote.
So what was the big secret? We don't
know for sure, but the front page of last
week's Stanford Review may have let the
cat out of the bag. "Deal in Works for

ROTC Return," proclaimed the headline,
and it seemed Gibney's concern was that,
for some strange reason, an ASSU Sen
ate resolution encouraging a ROTC
return to campus might in fact have hin
dered ROTC's imminent return to cam
pus.
What no one has mentioned — and yet
what was certainly known by parties
with the ASSU — is that Stanford no
longer has much of a choice as to whether
ROTC returns to campus.
ROTC left Stanford more than 20
years ago, and the reasons for the pro
gram's departure were twofold: Universi
ty officials objected to awarding academ
ic units for coursework supervised not by
Stanford-appointed professors but by
Pentagon-appointed ones, and both stu
dents and faculty felt uncomfortable sup
porting a military establishment con
ducting what they viewed as an unjust
war.
I'm glad they did it. As the son of par
ents who spent their free time in college
marching on the White House to protest
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, I've been
conditioned to view the military nega
tively. When I turned 18 and was obliged
to send in my selective service card, my
mother assured me that should the need
ever arise, she'd be happy to give me a lift

to the Canadian border. Whether it's fair
or not, I take a certain amount of pride in
attending a school that doesn't welcome
the armed forces.
But the fact is, Stanford could not have
done the same today, thanks to language
sponsored by Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon,
a conservative Republican from upstate
New York, and inserted into the bill
appropriating funds for Defense Depart
ment operations in fiscal year 199(5.
The United States Code - the law of
the land — was amended to state: "No
funds appropriated or otherwise avail
able to the Department of Defense may
be obligated by contract or by grant
(including a grant of funds to be available
for student aid) to any institution of
higher education that, as determined by
the Secretary of Defense, has an anti-
ROTC policy." It goes on to clarify that
an "anti-ROTC policy" is one which "pro
hibits, or in effect prevents, the Secretary
of Defense from maintaining or estab
lishing a unit of the Senior Reserve Offi
cer Training Corps at that institution."
The question then becomes whether
Stanford has policies specifically banning
ROTC from establishing a unit here. If
the University's 1969 decision to stop
awarding academic credit for ROTC's
directly led to the program's departure,

then I guess Stanford is "anti-ROTC"
(which, although a bad thing to the Pen
tagon, is certainly not to me). If, on the
other hand, ROTC left simply because
the pressure was too great, Stanford's
choosing not to award units does not con
stitute an "anti-ROTC" policy.
But still, so what? Big deal if Stan
ford's is deemed "anti-ROTC." Some of
us will certainly wear that distinction as
a badge of honor. Well, the problem is
that the University received, in the 1995-
1996 fiscal year, $48.2 million in Defense
research grants and contracts. That's 35
percent of the University's revenues.
And, sadly, it appears the government
is not afraid to use that leverage.
The president of Sacramento State, for
example, expelled ROTC from that uni
versity's campus in April 1994 because
the military program violates the school's
policies by discriminating against gay, les
bian and bisexual students. Under pres
sure from the Pentagon, he reversed his
decision last month.
"I believe our decision to assure all
students equal rights was the right one,"
the Sacramento State president said
after his about-face. But on a visit to
Washington, the president learned that
$13 million in research money would be
lost, along with $37 million in financial

aid for his students.
The military hierarchy has never beer
known for its willingness to allow — let
alone encourage — principled dissent.
Nor, unfortunately, have the Republicans
who ushered Rep. Solomon's amendment
through the House of Representatives.
And with those same Republicans still in
charge, it's unlikely that Solomon's pro-
ROTC regulations will change.
Stanford lawyers believe the Universi
ty's policies do not fali under the classifi
cation of anti-ROTC, and thus far the
Defense Department has not suggested
otherwise. Furthermore, in a time of
shrinking defense funds, it is unlikely the
Pentagon is looking to expand its ROTC
program.
Let's hope it stays that way. I'd hate to
see Stanford forced to make a choice
between nearly $50 million in research
funding and its policies barring anti-gay
discrimination. I have a funny feeling
which side would win.
