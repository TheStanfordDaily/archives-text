### Lindsay Amstutz 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis squad enjoyed continued
success this past weekend at the
Rolex National Indoor Champi
onships in Dallas. Juniors Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott came
away with the women's doubles
championship, while senior Katie
Schlukebir advanced to the
women's singles championship
match before losing 7-5, 6-2 to
Karin Miller of Duke.
Bleszynski and Scott defeated
Karen O'Sullivan and Luanne
Spades of Duke 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to
clinch the title. The champi
onship duo was not originally
scheduled to participate in the
doubles tournament, but injuries
to players on other teams afford
ed them a unique opportunity.
With both Bleszynski and Scott
already at the tournament for the
singles competition, they were
invited to participate.
"They are a new team, so this

was a great experience," said
head coach Frank Brennan.
"They didn't know they were
going to play until the night
before, and so when we found
out, we thought, 'Gee, that would
be fun.' "
After not being considered in
the original field, the surprise dou
bles team advanced to the champi
onship with solid play. Without
having given much thought to
winning the tournament, the
championship notion did not enter

their heads until after a big victo
ry in the semifinals.
To advance, they upset last
year's defending NCAA doubles
champions, Dawn Buth and
Stephanie Nickitas of Florida.
The Gator pair entered the tour
nament with a daunting 37-1
record and a solid No. 1 ranking,
but the Cardinal dismantled
them 6-1, 6-2.
In the women's singles compe
tition, Schlukebir advanced to the
championship with impressive
wins over Southern Methodist's
Patricia Zerdan, 6-2, 6-2 and
Florida's Amanda Basica, 6-1, 6-
0. No. 6 Schlukebir then upset
top seed Agnes Muzamel of Mis
sissippi 6-3, 6-0 to advance to the
final.
"Katie had some good solid
wins. She won easy and loves
playing indoors," Brennan said.
Stanford sent a total of five
representatives to the singles
tournament. In addition to
Schlukebir, Bleszynski and Scott
also participated in the singles
competition. Senior Sandra De
Silva had a big first-round win
against the No. 3 seed Marianne
Vallin of UNLV, 6-3, 6-4, before
falling in the second round.
Freshman Teryn Ashley gained
experience from her first visit to
the tournament as she rounded
out the Stanford delegation.
Bleszynski and Scott fell to
eventual champion Miller in the
first and second rounds, respec
tively.
"We knew her game pretty
well," Brennan said. "It always
helps to watch a player go up
against one of your girls. But
she's a smart and impressive
player."
The familiarity and advice of
teammates did not prove
enough to pull out a win over

freshman Miller.
But with an impressive show
ing, the tournament proved to be
an incredible success for the
Stanford women's team, who
will no doubt build on this strong
performance.
"It's really good for Stanford
to do so well. It's a great way to
start off the season, in terms of
confidence," Scott said.
Players were invited to the
Rolex National Indoor Tourna
ment if they won their Rolex
regional tournament or based on
their individual record. Addition
al wild-card and at-large bids
were also given out. The meet
serves as the third of four legs of
the Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation Collegiate Grand Slam.
Schlukebir traveled to Michi
gan this week, where she is par
ticipating in the Midland pro
tournament. Originally from
Michigan, she was granted a local
wild card. Given her adeptness at
playing indoors and with confi
dence from this past weekend,
she should have a strong outing.
For the Stanford team, the
conclusion of the Rolex tourna
ment marks the transition from
a more individual focus to a more
team-oriented emphasis as the
Cardinal gears up for the NCAA
tournament in May.
The Stanford women will
return to their home courts
when they take on Pacific tomor
row at 1:30 p.m.
