# Kribel wins in Mexico, Ray also shines
## Men's golf finishes close fourth in International Intercollegiate 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
Breaking out of a cloud that darkened the entire fall schedule, the
Stanford men's golf team kicked off the second half of its season with
new life, storming across the border to take fourth place at last week
end's International Intercollegiate in Monterey, Mexico.
Led by sophomore All-American Joel Kribel's tournament-winning
performance, the Cardinal took a big step toward respectability, post
ing its best finish of the season, only two strokes out of second place.
"This was definitely our best golf of the year," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "I definitely saw a lot of improvement, not only in specific
areas of our game, but in our overall play.
"It's the same old thing, but we just redly practiced hard and things
just worked out."
Tied for fifth after two rounds, Kribel took charge Saturday, scoring
a round-low 69 and leapfrogging into a tie for the top spot at 4-under
par with Colorado's John Douma. Senior teammate Conrad Ray joined
Kribel in the top five, finishing two strokes back in fourth place at 214.
Ray overcame first-day jitters to round out play with consecutive
below-par scores.

"I was especially pleased with Conrad this weekend," Goodwin said.
"After three years, things are really starting to come together for him.
He's really put in the work, and it's all starting to show. He should real
ly become a force for this team in the next few tournaments."
Continuing to impress with his precocity, freshman Dusty Brett fin
ished 23rd on the strength of a first-round 71. Firmly established in the
No. 3 spot on the squad, Brett has raised more than a few eyebrows in
his short career.
"He doesn't surprise me because we knew he was real talented,"
Goodwin said. "We're really lucky to have landed a player like him.
"I'm certain that he's going to be a really good player for us for years
to come."
Rounding out the Cardinal effort were juniors Eri Crum and Jake
Foe, who struggled with inconsistency and difficult course conditions.
With the exception of Crum's l-over 73 on the first day, neither was
able to settle into his game.
Despite the difficulties at the Nos. 4 and 5 spots, Goodwin's outlook
for the near future remained bright.
"This team reminds me so much of some of my better teams in their
chemistry," Goodwin said. "I
think this weekend was really
indicative of how that chemistry
can really pull them along.
However, such optimism has
been rare in this post-Tiger Woods
season. Last summer's loss of the
nation's best collegian to the pro
fessional ranks has definitely
made winning more problematic
for Goodwin and his squad.
Adding turbulence to the tran
sition was the sheer difficulty of
Stanford's fall schedule. Tourna
ments such as the Ping / Golfweek
College Preview back in October
pitted a relatively inexperienced
team against the nation's very
best programs.
"We just got shelled and shel
lacked," Goodwin said. "Week in
and week out, we were going up
against the top 25 or 30 teams in
the country.
"This weekend's field was pret
ty good but not quite on the caliber
of some of the ones we faced earli
er this year."
While Stanford's practice time
has been limited due to wet weath
er, the team was not necessarily
lacking in preparation. Unable to
play complete rounds, the team
spent an inordinate amount of
time working on its driving and
greens play.
"With our course underwater
for most of the time, we pretty
much concentrated on our short
games, and consequently, our
chipping and putting were pretty
strong," Goodwin said.
However, any praise from the
coach comes with cautious quali
fiers. The Cardinal's postseason
chances are still largely to be
determined.
"This weekend's meet really
doesn't say much about how
we'll do against our district
rivals," Goodwin said. "We have
a lot of Pac-10 play coming up
and we need to do really well
against teams at about our level
if we want to qualify for
NCAAs."
