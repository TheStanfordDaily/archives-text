anot her weekend of mixed results
by losing 39-6 to the No. 16 Cal
State-Bakersfield Roadru nners on
Saturday and defeating the Cal
State-Fullerton Titans 34-11 on
Sunday. Though the scores indi
cate that both matches were lop
sided, Stanford was competitive in
several of the matches against
Bakersfield.
The Koadrunners bounced
back from a three-meet losing
streak to win all of its matches
against the injured Cardinal.
Junior Scott Chapman, ranked
No. 11 in the nation and No. 2in
the Pacific 10 Conference, was
pinned by freshman Lionel Halsey
on a controversial call. The pin
occurred near the end of the first
period when Chapman became
caught in an unorthodox position.
"Chapman just got in a really
weird position," said coach Chris
Horpel. "During a flurry of
attempted takedowns, Chapman
ended up on his back, his opponent
pounced on the opportunity, and
the referee made a quick call."

up a weight class from his usual
150 pounds, seemed to have his
match under control but fell
behind late in the match and was
unable to make up the points in
time, losing 9-5 to Andy Varner.
"I felt we could have done better
against Bakersfield," Horpel said.
"However, the team responded
very well against Fullerton to end
the weekend on a good note, with
everyone wrestling well across the
board."

Rebounding from the disap
pointing loss to the Roadrun
ners, Stanford won five of its
eight matches including pins at
126 and 142 pounds. Sophomore
Zach Zimmerer pinned Tommy
Montoya 3 minutes, 58 seconds
into his match and sophomore
Warren McPherson pinned Hiro
ki Okazaki for the first pin of his
college career.
"A lot of the guys who haven't
been wrestling on a consistent
basis this season have really
stepped up to fill the void creat
ed by all of the injuries,"
McPherson said. "The guys are
giving great individual perfor

mances to compensate for the
injuries."
Chapman, wrestling up a
weight at 177 pounds, solidly
defeated his Titan opponent, 16-5.
At 158 pounds, Sanchez got a 14-9
decision over Fullerton's Steve
Duran and junior Jeff Grant
defeated Jason Webster 7-3 at 167
pounds.
"Even though a lot of guys are
hurt, the team is still sticking
together," Zimmerer said. "Despite
practicing without our captains
last week, we were able to keep our
morale and focus."
As the regular season action
comes to an end this weekend in

Stanford's last dual meet, the Car
dinal begins intense preparation
for the Pac-10 Championships in
three weeks, which determine
team and individual standing in
the Pac-10 and NCAA qualifica
tion. Wrestlers who place in the top
four in their weight class at Pac
10s to qualify for a trip to the
NCAA Championships.
"Our performance at the Pac
10s will ultimately boil down to
how injury-free we are," Horpel
said. "At this point we have about
three or four wrestlers who are
capable of giving an NCAA qualify
ing performance if they're healthy
and on."
