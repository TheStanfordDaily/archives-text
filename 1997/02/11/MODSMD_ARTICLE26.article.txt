anot her weekend of mixed results
by losing 39-6 to the No. 16 Cal
State-Bakersfield Roadru nners on
Saturday and defeating the Cal
State-Fullerton Titans 34-11 on
Sunday. Though the scores indi
cate that both matches were lop
sided, Stanford was competitive in
several of the matches against
Bakersfield.
The Koadrunners bounced
back from a three-meet losing
streak to win all of its matches
against the injured Cardinal.
Junior Scott Chapman, ranked
No. 11 in the nation and No. 2in
the Pacific 10 Conference, was
pinned by freshman Lionel Halsey
on a controversial call. The pin
occurred near the end of the first
period when Chapman became
caught in an unorthodox position.
"Chapman just got in a really
weird position," said coach Chris
Horpel. "During a flurry of
attempted takedowns, Chapman
ended up on his back, his opponent
pounced on the opportunity, and
the referee made a quick call."
