Freshman Bob Bryan led a Stanford men's
tennis contingent in Dallas, winning the conso
lation singles championship at the Rolex
National Indoor Championship over the week
end.
Bryan, who defeated Doug Root of Duke 6-4,
6-3 in the consolation final, was disappointed
with his loss to Miami freshman Mike Russell,
whom he has beaten before.
"He was ranked No. 2 last year and I was
ranked No. 1," Bryan said. "That was a tough
loss."
Yet Bryan came back to have a outstanding
tournament, taking out two players ranked in
the nation's top 15.
"It was good to go out and play a tourna
ment," Bryan said. "I had a couple of really
good wins."
Indeed he did. On his way to beating Root,
Bryan defeated New Mexico's Pepe Cabellero 6-
4, 6-4, Kentucky's Ludde
Sundin 6-4, 6-2 and South Car
olina's Keith Brill in a tight
match, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5). Sundin is
ranked fifth in the country; Brill
is ranked 14th.
Junior All-American Paul
Goldstein also made the trip to
Dallas, playing in the singles
draw as well. Goldstein defeated
Root 6-1, 6-3 in the first round
and Johan Landsberg of Missis
sippi in the second round 6-4, 6-
4 before losing a grueling match

to Fred Niemeyer of Middle Ten
nessee State, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6).
"I was happy with my play,"
Goldstein said. He received a
wild card to play in the Rolex
right before the tournament
began.
"I was really excited to get
out there and play in the tourna
ment."
In the doubles draw, it was
the freshman duo of Bob Bryan
and brother Mike Bryan. The
twins cruised past Claes Westin
and John James of South Alaba
ma 6-4, 7-5 and pulled out a
tight match against Middle Ten
nessee State's Anthony DeLuise
and Niemeyer 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. But

they eventually fell in the fourth
round to the No. 4 seeds, Sven
Koehler and Dmitry Muzyka of
Duke, 6-3, 6-3.
"We were surprised how well
we did," Bob Bryan said. "With
Mike just recovering from his
injury and all, he is playing real
ly well."
The twins will play in the
doubles of the Sybase Open
today at San Jose Arena, along
with teammate Ryan Wolters,
who is a part of the open singles
draw.
Action starts at 10 a.m., and
Wolters is in the third match of
play while the Bryans are in the
fifth.
