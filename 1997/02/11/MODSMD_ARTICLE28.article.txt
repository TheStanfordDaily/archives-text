## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
Sophomore All-American Ryan Wolters
will take on unseeded Daniel Nestor in the
first round of the Sybase Tournament in
the San Jose Arena today. Wolters received
a wild-card bid to play in the ATP tour
event. He is the only amateur in the tour
nament.
Other members of the singles draw
include defending champion and top-ranked
Pete Sampras, Michael Chang, MaliVai
Washington and Andre Agassi.
"Ryan is playing the best I have ever seen
him play," said junior teammate Paul Gold
stein. "I think we can expect a victory
tomorrow."
Wolters received much atten
tion last year when he faced
Andre Agassi in the first round
of the Sybase Tournament. A
native of San Jose, Wolters
received a standing ovation last
year as he left a crowd of enthu
siastic fans after his 6-2, 6-2 loss
to Agassi.
Should Wolters win in the
first round, he will face the win
ner of the No. 7 seed Greg Rued
ski-Andrei Pavel match. Wolters
is in the same half of the brack
et as Chang and Agassi.
In the doubles draw of the
tournament, Stanford freshman
twins Bob and Mike Bryan will
take on Mark Knowles and
Daniel Nestor.
The Bryans just returned
from the Rolex Intercollegiate
tournament Sunday where they
lost a grueling three-set match
in fourth round to the No. 4
seed.
"We are playing well right
now," Bob Bryan said. "It is
great to see Mike playing so well
since he is coming off the
injury."
Matches will be played all day
beginning at 10 a.m.
