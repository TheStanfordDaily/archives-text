# Men's gymnasts close gap
## 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team worked out a few more kinks
this weekend against California
and San Jose State at San Jose,
posting a 220.65,6.5 points behind
Cal's 227.15. The Spartans trailed
both at 201.55.
The Cardinal score, although a
full two points higher than its
opening meet three weeks ago, did
not fulfill the expectations of head
coach Sadao Hamada.
Hamada placed a goal of 224, an
average of 9.3 on each event, for
the meet, but the performance of
the Stanford squad failed to meet
the target. The team succeeded,
however, at closing the gap
between itself and Cal from 10
points at the last competition to
only 6.5 points at last weekend's
meet.
Additionally, senior Keith
Wiley continued to perform well,
posting a composite score of 55.7
in the all-around and finishing sec
ond to Cal's David Kruse. Wiley
racked up the top score on both
the pommel horse (9.55) and vault
(9.65). Other individual highlights
included senior lan Bachrach's
first-place score on the high bar at
9.65 and his third-place finish on
the floor exercise at 9.55.
Two Cardinal gymnasts saw
action for the first time during this
weekend's meet — redshirt fresh
man David Ludlow and freshman
Craig Nesbitt. Ludlow hit all of his
major skills as did Nesbitt, and

now the gymnasts only need to
work on polishing their routines.
Stanford is still rebuilding a
team that has been troubled by
injuries, which have left gaps in
the lineup and an overall weaker
team to compete in the opener.
Sophomore Scott Finkelstein
sustained a back injury early last
week but still competed for the
Cardinal, scoring a 9.45 on pom
mel horse and 9.1 on the parallel
bars.

reach our g0a1... but
I was happy that no
body was injured and
we had a complete
lineup on each event.'

"My back feels fine after getting
a lot of therapy [last] week, but
having not worked out, my
endurance was not there and
therefore I had trouble keeping my
energy high towards the end of the
routines," he said.
Stanford can count as a bless
ing that no injuries occurred or
were further aggravated at the
weekend's match.

goal, Sadao's goal, of the 224
