# Redirection of gifts criticized
## University defends current policy 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Even after consideration by a
Faculty Senate committee, some
faculty continue to question the
University's power to redirect gift
funds solicited by faculty members
for their own work.
The committee's inquiry was
the result of a letter circulated by
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan, which charged
that University officials misuse
their power to redirect funds
raised by faculty members. The
letter was signed by 69 faculty
members.
According to Lusignan, the
main problem with current Uni
versity practice is that faculty who
raise money are subject to the ad
ministration redirecting the funds
to other projects without consult
ing the faculty member, some
times due to donor interference.
The Committee on Research's
report endorsed current Universi
ty policy on the matter.
Applied Physics Prof. Robert
Byer, who chaired the committee,
minimized the importance of the
University's ability to redirect gift
funds.
"As far as I know, I have never
seen gift funds redirected outside
of the area for which they were do
nated," he said.

The funds are administered
through the Office of Develop
ment. Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford added that he did
not know of instances where gift
funds had been redirected into a
different area over the objections
of the faculty member involved
"We simply don't do things that
way," Ford said.
According to Byer, only about 5
percent of faculty have had gifts
they solicited redirected. The most
common reason for this, he added,
is that the funds are used to cover
extra expenditures in previous, re
lated projects.
The committee's report stress
es that the University is not con
tractually obliged to direct solicit
ed gifts to any specific project.
However, Byer stressed, the
University's first priority in deal
ing with such gifts is to "meet the
terms of the gifts and the wishes of
the donor."
Therefore, he said, every effort
is made to include donors in the
process of determining any redi
rection of funds, since it is not in
the University's interest to have
donors unsure of the final destina
tion of their money.
Lusignan said, however, that
the concerns of the donor should
not be allowed Drecedence over the
