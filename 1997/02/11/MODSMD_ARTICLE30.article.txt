Preparing to enter league com
petition on Saturday when they
host Chico State, the men's rugby
team scored an impressive 32-6
win over Santa Clara last Satur
day.
The men have been working on
a faster-paced game in order to
decrease their dependency upon
size. To compete against the
nation's top teams, they will be
forced to pick up the pace of their
game and try to control the
tempo.
ljast weekend's match helped
the team figure out exactly what
kinks it has to work out in prepa
ration for next weekend.
"After looking at Saturday's
game, we played all right," said
senior captain Joe Clayton. "We
had a lot of scoring opportunities,

but our ball control and retention
really wasn't up to par and it kept
us from capitalizing on a lot of
those.
"We really have to take better
care of the ball. That's going to be
a big factor in determining how
we do in league play as well as
playoffs."
Senior Joel Drescher had a
strong outing for the Cardinal,
scoring two tries for 10 points
But despite strong victories
throughout the pre-league com
petition, the men realize they
still have to be able to refine
their basic skills in order to
compete with upper-echelon
teams.
The women's match against
the UC-San Diego Tritons sched

low-key scrimmage against a Bay
Area club team.
