# Double sweep as softball opens season with 2-2 mark
## Cardinal wins clash with the Titans but Cal State-Northridge takes two 
### Ryan Chavez 
In only its third year as a varsity sport,
Stanford softball gained a measure of
respect this weekend by starting its sea
son in strong fashion. The Cardinal lost
two close games against 13th-ranked Cal
State-Northridge, 6-2, 3-2, but rebound
ed quickly by winning both of its games
Sunday against 12th-ranked Cal State-
Fullerton, 14-1, 11-6.
The start of Stanford's grueling sched
ule was against Northridge in a two game
series. Sophomore Becky Blevins (1-1)
gave a strong pitching performance in the
first game, only to come up a tad short.
"We didn't hit well or get the breaks
against Northridge, yet we could have
and should have won," said sophomore
pitcher / left fielder Marcy Crouch.
Crouch (1-1) pitched the second game
against the Matadors, which the team
lost by another slim margin.
"I think we were a bit jittery, a bit ner
vous," Blevins said. "We wanted to gain
some respect. We don't get much respect
right now, being unranked. But we
showed that we can compete and beat
nationally ranked teams."
In its second series of the weekend
against Fullerton, the squad showed that
Stanford can beat a nationally ranked
team convincingly.
Crouch started the Cardinal in the
right direction in Sunday's doubleheader,
hitting a first-inning grand slam off
Donna Coombes (0-1) in the first game,
and Stanford never looked back, going on
to win 11-6 behind adecent performance

on the mound from Blevins at the Titan
Softball Complex.
"Crouch's grand slam gave a big boost
to the team," said senior third baseman
Amanda Renteria. "We saw that it was
possible to hit strongly against 12th
ranked Fullerton." Renteria had three
hits in the series against the Titans.
In the second game, Crouch showed
that she could give great pitching perfor
mances as well as hit grand slams, going
seven strong innings and holding the
Titans to only one run.
Stanford used five Titan errors to gen
erate four unearned runs, and by scoring
seven runs in the sixth off the Cal State-
Fullerton bullpen, farced the game to be
called by the mercy rule prior to the sev
enth inning. Every Cardinal in the start
ing lineup scored except No. 9 hitter and
left fielder Dawn Kobata.
Jana Oetgen (0-1) picked up the loss
for the Titans, while Crouch earned the
victory.
Sophomore designated hitter Michelle
Acosta led the strong offensive perfor
mance in the second game against Fuller
ton, with three hits in five at bats. Sever
al of the players credited the improved
hitting from last year to the addition of
new head coach John Rittman.
"We're really excited," Crouch said.
"Our coach has really helped improve all
of our hitting. We saw that what he's
teaching us is really going to work."
The Cardinal will travel to St. Mary's
tomorrow afternoon and finally open its
new on-campus facility at home against
Pacific on Saturday.
