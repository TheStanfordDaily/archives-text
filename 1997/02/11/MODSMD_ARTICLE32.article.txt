### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
It's early in the season and
nobody is saying anything yet, but
based on its explosive performance
this past weekend, the Stanford
track and field team is turning
some heads and showing a lot of
promise.
"We don't put a lot of emphasis
on indoor track, yet I think we had
one of the most successful meets
last weekend that we've had since
I've been here," said track and field
director Vin I^ananna.
At the Cannon IV Invitational
in Indianapolis, the team fielded
only a small squad of 15 athletes
yet managed to turn out some
strong performances in all areas,
producing eight provisional quali
fiers for the NCAA Champi
onships.
The meet featured mostly Mid
west and East Coast schools such
as Arkansas, Villanova, George
town and Purdue.
In men's long distance, junior
distance runner Jon Weldon was a
national qualifier in the 3,000
meters with a time of 8 minutes,
8.47 seconds. Senior distance run
ner Rob Reeder and sophomore
distance runner Jason Balkman
also qualified for the NCAAs with
times of 14:03.66 and 14:11.91 in
the 5,000 meters respectively.
"It was an incredibly exciting
meet for me," Reeder said after
beating his personal best by 19 sec

onds. "I was quite surprised. I usu
ally don't expect to run well this
early."
Not to be outdone, the men's
distance medley relay team of
junior Jason Lunn, senior Jimmie
Johnson, freshman Michael Stem
ber and senior J.J. White also qual-

ing performance at the Bill Cosby

event drew mostly regional schools
such as Texas, Washington, Fresno
State and Cal State-Northridge,
the well-sized squad of 30 from
Stanford faced plenty of competi
tion.
Sophomore heptathlete Tracye
Lawyer started oft the run of Car
dinal successes by winning the high
jump at 5-9 3/4 and by being a pro
visional qualifier for the NCAA
Championships.
"I felt good, it was fun, and it
tied a personal indoor best for me,"

All around, the team is extreme

Lananna said. "Hopefully, this can
be used as a springboard to an even
hotter outdoor season.
