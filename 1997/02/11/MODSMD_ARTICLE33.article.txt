## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Stanford students will be able to watch fellow stu
dents sharing secrets of love when SCBN's Love-
Links airs for the first time Thursday evening.
The Stanford equivalent of the "Dating Game,"
"Love-Links" features a group of bachelors and bach
elorettes answering questions from a contestant of
the opposite sex.
A revival of a show done eight years ago at Stan
ford, "Love-Links" is an attempt to spice up the dating
scene at Stanford, Executive Producer Salvador Pani
agua, a senior.
"We see ourselves as crusaders for the social ills of
Stanford's dating scene," Paniagua said.
Paniagua said he decided to produce the show after
a former executive producer suggested the idea. Pani
agua contacted a few friends and distributed fliers
publicizing the idea.
Freshman Ayse Inan, the show's assistant produc
er, said she was eager to become involved with the pro
duction of the show when she saw the advertisement.
"I love dating games. I saw the flier and expressed
interest to Salvador," Inan said. "Since we've started,
I have been involved in marketing and advertising.
We're trying to get restaurants to give us meals with
which we can award our winners."
Love-Links features eight contestants and two co
hosts, all of whom are undergraduate students. The
participants learned of the show by word of mouth or
through fliers around campus.
Contestant Yves Zinggeler, a junior, said he
thought the idea "sounded fun.
"It beats doing a physical chemistry problem set,"
Zinggeler said.
Another contestant, junior Karen Bewley, said she

thought the idea of a dating game at Stanford sound
ed fun as well.
Senior Juan Neria said he decided to participate in
the show because he "likes to live scandalously.
"This show is going to be big," Neria said. "People
will start watching; the word's on the street."
And that's exactly what producers Paniagua and
Inan hope happens.
"We really want to get Stanford pysched about
"Love-Links". We want Stanford to trust it as a good
show, and we want the community to trust it too,"
Inan said.
Inan, who thinks "Love-Links" provides students
with a unique opportunity to express themselves, said
she thinks the show is well-suited for Stanford stu
dents.
"Stanford students are witty and intellectual.
"Love-Links" is the perfect setting to combine good
intellect and a willingness to have fun," Inan said.
Junior Armen Panossian said he thinks "Love-
Links" will help bring dating back to Stanford.
"The dating scene could use a lot of help here. It's
not the students' fault; the professors need to relax on
the problems sets and give extra credit to students
who date," Panossian said.
Despite this widespread skeptical outlook on Stan
ford's dating scene, Neria said he thinks people date
enough at Stanford.
"I think the dating scene is happening," Neria said.
"It's a myth that people don't date."
"Love-Links," which will air every Thursday at
8:30 p.m. for the next four weeks, will be promoting
the show today in White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m.
Producers will be distributing fliers and interviewing
contestant hopefuls.
"We want people to know — hey, this show exists.
It's an exciting, dynamic show," Inan said.
