Students in search of the perfect Valen
tine's Day gift for a female friend will be re
lieved to learn of the latest gift-giving craze:
boyfriend-in-a-box.
Forget the chocolates, roses and perfume.
What single girls really want is a prepackaged
soulmate. At $15.95, the boyfriend-in-a-box
kit comes complete with a photo of your typi
cal good-looking guy, a sheet listing his vital
statistics, three "While You Were Out" mes
sages — for all the times he called when you
were out, a greeting card signed by him and of
course, a handy owner's manual.

Women can choose from six picture per
fect guys: Doctor Dave, Firefighter Frank,
Musical Miles, Athletic Al, Corporate Craig,
or Cowboy Clint.
The novelty item is being sold by the flo
ral boutique Bella Fiore outside of Tresidder
Union until Friday and has already attract
ed the eye of many a passerby. Sophomore
Lisa Talma was caught buying two kits, one
for her mother and one for her roommate.
" I 've never seen anything like it," she bub
bled. "I want my mom to have a boyfriend,
and while I'm at it, I might as well get one for
my roommate, too." After pondering which
of the six men to choose for her mother, Lisa

decided on Athletic Al, saying, "We don't
need a smart one this time."
Cathy Hamilton, the brains behind
boyfriend-in-a-box, got the idea when, surf
ing the Internet, she came across the popular
Romance Connection chat rooms.
"I couldn't believe how many people were
using the Internet to fmd Mr. or Ms. Right,"
Hamilton said. "As I was eavesdropping on
all these singles trying to make a love connec
tion online, I thought, 'There must be an eas
ier way!' Then it hit me — boyfriend-in-a
-box!"
Hamilton set out to develop a prototype
and pitched the idea to Hallmark Cards in

Kansas City, Mo. While the company was en
thusiastic about the concept, the two couldn 't
agree on certain aspects of development.
Hamilton decided to work independently and
enlisted the help of George Coakley of San
Jose, the marketing consultant who engi
neered the success of the pet rock so famous
in the 19705.
Caterina Gaither, the salesperson work
ing at the Tresidder stand said men as well as
women are receptive to the boyfriend in-a
box idea. However, one dubious male stu
dent, when asked if he would consider buying
the gift for a female friend, promptly replied,
"I don't think so."
