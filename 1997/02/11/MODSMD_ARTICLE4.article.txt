# ASSU to vote on council nominees
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will vote
tonight on the nomination of
Nawwar Kasrawi to the Constitu
tional Council, an action which al
ready has fueled a heated debate
over his character
Kasrawi's proponents have
lauded his extensive political back
ground. Last month ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen named Kasrawi one
of five initial nominees to the
newly-formed council.
Senate Chair Don Aingworth
heads the opposition to the nomi
nation, alleging a series of consti
tutional violations throughout
Kasrawi's senate career.
"I think my chances are very
good of being confirmed," said
Kasrawi, a doctoral student in
electrical engineering. "I hope that
the debate is about whether 1 will
be a good candidate to be on the
Constitutional Council and that
people will not resort to personal
attacks."
A meeting of the senate's Ad
ministration and Rules Commit
tee last night offered a preview of
the full senate debate. The com
mittee took a neutral stance on
Kasrawi's endorsement, instead
choosing to report Kasrawi to be
"highly qualified" for a position on
the council. At least one commit
tee member expressed "strong
reservations" toward the nomi
nee's character.
In the course of committee dis
cussion on whether to recommend
Kasrawi, Aingworth squared off
with graduate senator Alane Mur

dock, an outspoken Kasrawi sup
porter.
Anigworth ardently opposed
the nomination, accompanying his
verbal arguments with 25 pages of
newspaper clippings regarding
Kasrawi's previous actions with
the senate. His sentiments, how
ever, were not enough to convince
the committee to negatively en
dorse Kasrawi.
Committee member Mallory
Roberts said he supported recom-

mending Kasrawi
but with mixed
feelings. "He is
the only candidate
we have who is
super-qualified."
he said, though he
feared that Kas
rawi could try to
take control over |
the council."I
have a feel in e he

would try to be a 'chief justice' of
the council if given the chance."
Shen said last night that the full
senate debate will proceed similar
ly "If it goes like the process has
gone so far, it's going to be shame
fully personal and void of any dis
cussion on qualifications or
morals," he said. "I'm hoping for
more substantial discussion, but I
just don't anticipate it."
Graduate senator Doug Natel
son, who is still undecided on how
he will vote on the nomination,
said he hope's the debate will not
get out of hand.
"A lot of people on both sides of
the issue have a lot of difficulty


Kasrawi
keeping their objectivity when it
comes to Nawwar and the Constitu
tional Council,"he said. "I hope that
(Senate Deputy Chair) Joe Freund
will have the sense to see when [de
batel has ceased to be productive."
Freund will presumably preside

over the debate because Aing
worth has said he will not serve as
chair during the discussion of Kas
rawi's nomination.
The senate will also vote
tonight on the nomination of
Robert Windom to the council.
Like Kasrawi, Windom drew nei
ther a vote of confidence nor a con â€¢
demnation from the committee.
Roberts said Windom is "quali
fied but adequate."

In other senate news, Shen
plans to formally propose a consti
tutional amendment that would
cut the number of ASSU senators
that students could vote for from
15 to five. He originally announced
plans for such a bill during last
month's State of the Association
address. The number of senators
would remain at 30.
The senate will convene tonight
at 7 in Law School 190.
