# Halfway through its first year, Science Core receives good reviews

With the opening of new Science Core
laboratories last Wednesday, the faculty
and students of the core welcome the pro
gram inaugural year with enthusiasm.
They recognize, however, that the core
still needs work.
Kelly Beck, the laboratory and scientif
ic coordinator for the core, said that the
first year was a "mixed bag, where some
things go entirely like a first year course."
She said she is looking at ways to help the

professors teach more effectively, espe
cially in using the new laboratories, where
she will help coordinate and supervise.
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, the
program's director said the labs will help
provide a unique experience for many of
the freshmen in the core as "most stu
dents do not have lab experience in their
first year here."
David Botstein, the chairman of the
Genetics Department in the School of
Medicine and one of the faculty involved
in the core, also felt that the first year is
mainly a time to gain experience. "We're

just getting started. Everyone's learning
how to do this. It's a little too early to see,
but we are doing things well," he said.
Informally known as sci-core, the core
strives to introduce essential ideas of sci
ence to students whose interests lie pri
marily within the fields of humanities and
social sciences. It fulfills the natural sci
ences, applied science and technology and
mathematics requirement (area *2) of the
newly implemented general education re
quirement system.
Students can choose one of three avail
able tracks that focus on either geology,

physics or biology. Each track attempts to
cover the same basic principles but from
different angles and perspectives.
Because of its scope, the core is an in
terdisciplinary program with faculty hail
ing from departments ranging from
mathematics to psychology to geophysics.
Osgood said, "There has been tremen
dous faculty enthusiasm and devotion to
the program." He said since this is the
first year of the program, nobody really
knew what to expect: "About 80 percent of
the students are freshmen, all with varied
backgrounds."

Students said they felt that there was
room for improvement within the pro
gram, but recognized that the core is still
in its first year.
Freshman Huiwen Kong is taking the
core because it fulfills the GER with one
sequence of courses rather than several
separate ones.
"If you're not going to be a techie, why
do all that extra work?" Kong said.
She also said she liked the small class
size and accessible professors. On the
downside, she said the curricu
lum is so "wide-spread" that she's
not really sure "what the focus
is."
The staff of the core program
holds weekly evaluative meet
ings, where issues such as struc
tures, arrangements and possible
improvements are discussed.

Osgood hopes the core, which
currently has funding for three
years, will become bigger and
more varied in the coming years
and continue even beyond that. "I
think we're onto something here.
We'll learn a lot as we go on, and
be informed by our experience."
"The real issue is that science
has a bad name among non-scien
tists," Botstein said, "and the
[student] evaluations lead us to
be encouraged [the core has] the
students' attention."
