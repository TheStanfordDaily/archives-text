Despite reports to the contrary, officials at
U.S. News & World Report said they are in no
rush to revamp the rating formula that the
magazine uses in its annual college ranking
issue.
An article printed yesterday in the San Jose
Mercury News reported that the magazine had
adopted a "key suggestion" made by the Forget
U.S. News Coalition, a student organization
formed last October by ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson.

The newspaper said the magazine's planned
changes would make it easier for high school
students to use data to craft personalized rank
ings. These revisions in the ranking system
were to take place between now and the start of
the next school year.
U.S. News Assoc. Editor J.J. Thompson,
who has a key role in producing the rankings,
said she was unaware of the Mercury News ar
ticle and denied any changes in the college
guide's ranking formula. She also commented
that the magazine has neither released any offi
cial statements nor reached any final decisions
on the matter.

"Someone's speaking out of turn," Nick
Thompson said.
J.J. Thompson said the magazine Ls "consid
ering looking into the matter," but noted that it
is not something that has been dealt with or
fully discussed.
"We met with Nick last December, and we've
got a lot of things under consideration," J.J.
Thompson said. She also added that the college
guide has spent the last month finishing up a
guide to graduate schools.
