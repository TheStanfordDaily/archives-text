# Reports mixed on school rankings
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Despite reports to the contrary, officials at
U.S. News & World Report said they are in no
rush to revamp the rating formula that the
magazine uses in its annual college ranking
issue.
An article printed yesterday in the San Jose
Mercury News reported that the magazine had
adopted a "key suggestion" made by the Forget
U.S. News Coalition, a student organization
formed last October by ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson.

The newspaper said the magazine's planned
changes would make it easier for high school
students to use data to craft personalized rank
ings. These revisions in the ranking system
were to take place between now and the start of
the next school year.
U.S. News Assoc. Editor J.J. Thompson,
who has a key role in producing the rankings,
said she was unaware of the Mercury News ar
ticle and denied any changes in the college
guide's ranking formula. She also commented
that the magazine has neither released any offi
cial statements nor reached any final decisions
on the matter.

"Someone's speaking out of turn," Nick
Thompson said.
J.J. Thompson said the magazine Ls "consid
ering looking into the matter," but noted that it
is not something that has been dealt with or
fully discussed.
"We met with Nick last December, and we've
got a lot of things under consideration," J.J.
Thompson said. She also added that the college
guide has spent the last month finishing up a
guide to graduate schools.
Supporters of Nick Thompson's group, who
hail from more than 70 universities,
said they felt that the changes men
tioned in the article were not the
major revisions for which they had
hoped.
The Mercury News reported
that U.S. News would break down
the 18 categories used for its rating
formula and separate them into
charts each featuring 50 schools.
According to the newspaper, this

separation would cut down the im
pact the overall ranking has on its
student readers.
ASSU Deputy Senate Chair Joe
Freund, a member of Nick Thomp
son's group, said these changes are
marginal and do not eliminate the
magazine's "hierarchical and ordi
nal" ranking system.
"It's basically shifting around the
weight of certain categories," Fre
und said. "Until they realize it's not
right to rank the wide-ranging col
leges under one formula, we are not
going to stop pushing."
Nick Thompson said he thinks

U.S. News is close to making a
major change in their college rating
system. He attributed this suspi
cion to the growing nationwide crit
icism the influential and controver
sial rating system has been receiv
ing.
"They're getting hammered," he
said. "They have to do something
about it. They know they are getting
smoked."
According to Thompson, the crit
ical thing to do now is to stop schools
from sending data to the magazine
to be ranked under their system.
Each year U.S. News asks col

leges to release a variety of specific
information, such as the number of
courses offered with a classroom size
of fewer than nine students and the
average SAT score for the incoming
freshman class.
Without this crucial information
from schools, the magazine is unable
to report its findings and analyze col
leges under its formula.
Thompson said his group is aim
ing to shatter the impression that
college administrators support the
magazine's ranking system by per
suading them to stop sending the
data.

This year's statistics are due back
to U.S. News in about two weeks,
and the matter was brought up with
Stanford's Board of Trustees during
meetings earlier this week, Thomp
son said.
University President Gerhard
Casper will have a significant impact
on the matter should he choose not
to release the information.
"Casper knows it's not morally
the right thing to do," Thompson
said. "Over the past few weeks, our
group has been talking it over with
various people and writing letters to
administrators."

According to Thompson, 15 to 20
private schools are close to reaching
the decision not to release the infor
mation.
The action to stop U.S. News
from using its current ranking sys
tem has become a heated national
issue, and Thompson said the move
ment will only continue to grow
rapidly until something is done.
Administrators at Amherst Col
lege in Massachusetts, which
Thompson's group has not yet con
tacted, are also reviewing a proposal
by a student group to reject U.S.
News' questionnaire.
