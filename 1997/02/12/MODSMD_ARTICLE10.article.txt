MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. (AP) - A low-level
volcano watch was in force near the resort town of
Mammoth Lakes, Calif., yesterday after a magni
tude-4.5 earthquake jolted the Eastern Sierra.
The U.S. Geological Survey issued a C status of
"strong unrest" in the volcanic region. The watch
will expire tomorrow.
The last eruption in the area was 250 years ago
in the nearby Mono Lake region.
The earthquake at 3:26 p.m. Monday was 5.5
miles deep. About 30 aftershocks followed within
two hours, but the largest was magnitude-2.6, said
David Hill, who is in charge of Mammoth geological
monitoring for the agency.
No damage or injuries were reported.
The quake was centered 1 1/2 miles outside the
Long Valley caldera, an 18-mile-by-9-mile elliptical
depression formed by an ancient volcanic eruption
The caldera has been under close watch since
four magnitude-6.0 quakes shook the area in 1980.
The C status is the third highest of five levels of

alert. The strongest level is an A status, indicating
that an eruption is likely within hours to days.
Eight miles away, the quake caused little con
cern in Mammoth Lakes, a skiing, fishing and out
doors resort gearing up for its big Presidents' Day
tourist period. The town of 5,000 can swell to
25,000 on winter weekends.
There were more than a few jokes about
"Dante's Peak," the newly released disaster film
about a volcano that obliterates a Pacific Northwest
town.
"We laughed about it last night," said Pam Mur
phy, spokeswoman for Mammoth Mountain Ski
Area. "1 said, 'Hollywood's getting darn good.'"
About 4,000 people were on the slopes at Mam
moth Mountain Ski Area when the temblor struck
and they probably never felt it, Murphy said.
"I don't feel that the volcanic situation here is a
big deal," she said. "We all feel very safe here.
Should anything decide to happen, we're all going
to have a lot of warning."
