University should
re-examine illogical
policies on lending

THE QUARTER IS hitting its
halfway point now, and that
means most undergraduates
are studying hard in preparation
for their midterm examinations. If
you're not knee-deep in lecture
notes, you're probably researching
a mid-quarter essay or, if you're
very ambitious, you're spending
time in the library, getting started
on term-paper research. Those
graduate students who aren't fac
ing the same tasks are instead
buried, as always, in their research.
When students are busy with
their work, few think twice about
the typical four-week library loan
period. That's usually long
enough to finish reading the
parts you need; at worst, it only
means one renewal.
And Stanford students who grow
particularly attached to their books
— whether graduate students or
undergraduates — can choose to
renew repeatedly, providing that no
other person has recalled the book.
But while four weeks is the
standard loan time for students at
most libraries across campus,
there is no such standard time for
faculty and staff.
Take, for example, Green
Library. Its loan period for most
students: four weeks; for students
writing a dissertation: one quarter;
for faculty and staff: one year.
The argument can be made that
the circulation across all 23
libraries at Stanford varies to
such a great degree that policy
should be library-specific, but it is
hard to imagine that Medical
School faculty who use Lane
Library would need less time with
their books than faculty checking
out books from Green.
Particularly intriguing is that
those classified as staff receive the

same generous loan privileges as
faculty, even though many do not
share the faculty's research
demands.
The library system needs to re
examine its lending policies with
an eye toward standardizing the
loan periods at the various
libraries and also toward clarify
ing the rights afforded to those
designated as "staff."
The "staff" identification is a
nebulous tag. A student attending
another college but working as a
secretary is considered a staff
member. Not only does this person
receive all the library privileges of
a Stanford student, even though
he or she attends another school,
he or she receives the greater
rights afforded to faculty mem
bers. That means, in this example,
that the non-Stanford student can
check out books from Green —
perhaps for his or her own classes
— for up to a year.
Yet those of us paying the Uni
versity roughly $30,000 annually
get the same book for only four
weeks.
At the same time, a postdoctor
al fellow doing extensive research
with a tenured faculty member is
considered "staff" — research
which, conceivably, will result in a
book co-authored by the two. That
postdoctoral fellow clearly should
be entitled to the same privileges
as faculty; still, he or she receives
the same classification as the
part-time secretary.
The potential for abuse of Stan
ford's libraries — something that
will affect students' and faculty
members' ability to do their
research — must be stopped. Stu
dents and faculty brought here to
learn should be guaranteed the
best access to library materials.
The University's libraries
needs uniform policy applied to
all libraries for the loan of books
to students, staff and faculty.
And they also need a clearer dis
tinction between the various
types of people currently lumped
together as "staff."
