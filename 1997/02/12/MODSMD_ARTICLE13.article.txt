Casper should be held accountable on sorority housing

Like nick Thompson and The
Daily's editorial board, I too think
University President Gerhard
Casper is a nice guy. As a member of an
a cappella group, I sang at a party at his
home before the 1995 Big Game and was
charmed by his generosity and spirit.
And there's no denying that I laughed
uproariously with the rest of the audi
ence upon witnessing his version of the
Macarena in this year's Gaieties.
But as much as I genuinely like
Casper, I heartily disagree with The
Daily's assessment that "the issues pre
sented to Casper are often out of his
domain." In Friday's editorial, The Daily
cited sorority housing, the denial of
tenure to Akhil Gupta and the creation
of a socially responsible endowment
fund as examples of issues that fall out
side of Casper's immediate control. I do
not claim expertise on the Gupta situa
tion nor on the endowment fund propos
al, and consequently I will not address
them. Yet as far as sorority housing is

concerned, The Daily got it all wrong.
In my attempts to attain equal access
to housing for women, I have conducted
substantial research. Although I recognize
that the information I have collected is far
from complete, I have come to a few
notable conclusions that justify the sorori
ty community's recent criticism of Casper.
First of all, where fraternal housing is
concerned, I can locate no written docu
ment outlining the University's policy,
and in closed-door meetings with two
separate administrators, the validity of
this statement was not disputed. In
other words, administrators have
acknowledged that the "grandfather"
policy implemented in the mid-1980s by
then-Dean of Students Jim Lyons is not
a formal document.
Yet every administrator I know denies
having the authority to allow women
access to sorority housing. Thus, I ask,
whose responsibility is it? Given the Uni
versity's inability to produce a formal doc
ument and its refusal to designate which

administrator or office can change the pol
icy, I think it is perfectly appropriate to
ask the University's president to explain
Stanford's policy on fraternal housing.
Moreover, The Daily was wrong to
claim Housing and Dining Services and
the Office of Student Activities are the
bodies responsible for deciding whether
or not sororities can be housed. True, as
the University has not explicitly named
who is authorized to change the policy, it
is reasonable to expect that those two
offices would be actively involved in any
change of policy. Still, although Housing
and Dining Services and the Office of
Student Activities clearly have authority
over the allocation of housing facilities
and Greek life, respectively, I sense that
any decision about sorority housing
must involve other parties such as Resi
dential Education, as well.
Therefore, I suspect upon next week's
release of the Greek Affairs Task Force's
report, Mary Edmonds, the vice provost
and dean for student affairs, will be the

one to make and announce a decision in
consultation with her supervisors. It is
worth noting that according to the Uni
versity's own flow charts of administra
tive hierarchy, Edmonds has two clear
supervisors: Provost Condoleezza Rice
and President Casper. Hence, again, I
assert that approaching Casper on this
issue is justifiable.
Although I disagree wholeheartedly
with The Daily that Casper should not
be held accountable for the fraternal
housing issue, I concede that many of us
have perhaps been too harsh in our cri
tiques of him. While Casper has been
less accessible than some of us would
like, he has made sincere attempts to
communicate with concerned students.
That having been said, President
Casper, I look forward to a constructive,
open dialogue with you when we meet
during your Feb. 27 office hours.
