THE STANFORD
Introductory
Studies program
that University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper
announced last May is
the culmination of a
three-year set of respons
es to a comprehensive
study of undergraduate
education at Stanford.

As direct results of this reappraisal, in
just the last two years we have seen the
introduction of the new Science Core for
humanities and social science majors, new
foreign language requirements, a renewed
focus on writing in the general curriculum
and in the major, the introduction of
minors, a restructuring of the General
Education Requirements, the revitaliza
tion of general and departmental advising
under the leadership of a new director of
undergraduate advising, the expansion of
sophomore seminars and dialogues and
the creation of Sophomore College.
These dramatic initiatives represent
Stanford's central and enduring commit
ment to outstanding undergraduate edu
cation. Our intention now is to build
upon these successes by integrating
them into the coherent curricular pro
gram of Stanford Introductory Studies
and to add a new set of seminars
designed especially for freshmen.
The foremost feature I would empha
size concerning these new freshman sem

inars is that they will provide students
with opportunities for high-quality
undergraduate education in the form of
small, inquiry-based, learning environ
ments. The seminars will help create a
sense of intellectual excitement and set a
standard of critical inquiry among stu
dents at the crucial beginning point of
their college careers.
The freshman seminars are intended
1) to intensify the intellectual experience
of the first year; 2) to introduce students
to the variety and richness of the aca
demic topics, methods and issues that are
at t he core of current scholarly research;
and 3) to enhance opportunities for the
development of mentoring relationships
between freshmen and faculty.
The core of the program will be about
100 separate courses of 16 students each,
offered thiloughout the year in a variety
of humanities, social science, natural sci
ence and engineering disciplines. While a
number of seminars will be offered begin
ning next fall quarter, the remainder are
scheduled to be phased in during the fol
lowing two years.
Whether conceived as entirely new
courses or as faculty-led complements to
existing large courses, the seminars will
share the form of bringing students into
close contact with faculty members who
are passionate about scholarship and
new knowledge and the intent of engag
ing students in the process of articulating
the issues, questions and problems at the

heart of a particular area of study.
Faculty will share with students the
excitement that motivates their own
scholarship and research and engage
students in the methodologies that drive
their quest for knowledge. Typically, in
their roles as scholars, faculty share
their thoughts with one another, test out
their ideas, write and rethink as they
explore the key questions of their subject
areas. The freshman seminars will fol
low these same principles of critical
inquiry: thinking, discussing, writing,
rethinking and rewriting.
Faculty will be asked to design their
seminars in such a way as to help stu
dents understand why the particular
research questions that occupy them as
scholars are germane to understanding
the structure, procedures a,nd culture of
their discipline and to exemplify what it
means to engage one's mind in the pro
cess of producing and understanding
new knowledge.
In the past several years, Stanford has
taken consequential steps to guarantee
that undergraduate education is as impor
tant a part of its mission as is the research
conducted by faculty. The freshman semi
nars are a furthering of these steps and
offer an effective and reasonable connec
tion between the two aspects of the Stan
ford teaching and research culture.

Ramon Saldivar is the vice provost for
undergraduate education.
