# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Chivalry: injury prevention as well as 'codespeak' 
### 
OK, IT'S THE '90s, right? It's actu
ally almost the double-zero-ies
(the "naught-ies"?), and any
socially conscious heterosexual male has
by now become aware of the slow, albeit
consistent unraveling of any behavior
that is perceived as treating women dif
ferently than men. So here's my question:
How come it is still acceptable for a man
to open the door for a woman? Is it sexist?
What about the Chivalry Paradox?
Boy, am I gonna get letters for this
one. Let's start from the beginning:
The word "chivalry" comes from the
Latin root of "chivalrus" which roughly
means "make the man do it." For years,
menial tasks (from the root word "men")
were delegated to whomever was deemed
"most manly." For thousands of years,
however, chivalry failed to pick up much
momentum due to the fact that the only
truly chivalrous things to do were exceed
ingly dangerous, e.g., killing fire-breath
ing dragons and dueling evil-doers to the
death. Then suddenly, with the invention
of the door, chivalry was brought back
into the limelight.

The door led to many improvements
in society, such as the doorknob, the
doorjamb, the doorbell, The Doors, open
door policies, Dorothy and Toto and
Doris Day. But the door is known mostly
for its ability to keep both freezing
weather and prowlers outside of the
home. It's also a nifty thing to knock on.
And a great place to hang wreathes.
With the door, came The Momentous
Decision of the Door. It stated that "any
man, acting in the most chivalrous of
manners, shall always open the door for
any woman that doth approacheth." And
since then, like lemmings, every man
worthy of his testosterone has plunged
off the proverbial cliff of door-opening.
Ever since The Momentous Decision, we
have braved rain, sleet, hail, fire and
brimstone to open the door for any
female within a 10-mile radius.
But it's nearing the end of the '90s,
and the times they are a-different. Social
rules are in limbo. Social norms are in
flux. Stanford has a gender requirement.
And all this has led to a new wave of
uncertainty for couples as they approach

a door. And seeing that the recent Lewis
ton-Queenston Study of American Door
time Behavior has shown that Americans
open an average of 36 doors a day, there
are a total of roughly 7.8 billion moments
of doorstep uncertainty that face our
nation daily.
The general confusion comes from the
fact that some women think that if a man
opens the door for her, he is "continuing
the vicious and malevolent cycle of
female oppression and subjugation of
women that the male gender has despot
ically imposed upon women for centuries,
contributing to the mass injustices con
sistently committed against the child
bearing sex." On the other hand, some
women think that having the door
opened for them is "kinda sweet." I'm
sure there must be some happy medium
somewhere between "despotic oppres
sion" and "kinda sweet."
Personally, I like opening the door for
women. It's certainly much easier than
slaying fire-breathing dragons, it's a gener
ally nice thing to do, and most of all, it's an
incredibly convenient social convention.

Imagine a world where we didn't have
this convention, and no one knew who
would reach for the door first. Think how
many head-to-head collisions there
would be on doorsteps all across America.
With men opening doors, life is much
safer for all mankind and womankind. So
if there are any doubters out there, don't
consider chivalry to be a form of subjuga
tion. Just consider it as a good way of
avoiding massive head wounds.
Chivalry as a social convention makes a
lot of sense to me. Except the part in the
movies where men throw their coats over
mud puddles so women don't have to walk
through them and get their shoes dirty.
That doesn't make sense to me. (I mean,
why can't those women just walk around
the puddles? Don't they know how diffi
cult it is to get mud stains out of suede?)
Of course, if you see some schmo actu
ally throwing his coat down over a mud
puddle for a woman, the couple in ques
tion is obviously on a first date. And
every rule of chivalry must be followed
on first dates. Men actually show up
with flowers. They wear something other

than jeans. They floss. In addition, they
open every door humanly possible. The
door to the house. The car door â€” get
ting in and getting out. The restaurant
door. In addition, they pull chairs out
from under tables. They hold up coats as
their dates wriggle their way in. They
drop women off at the restaurant door
and then park the car.
I can speak for all men right now by
saying that we are not usually this nice.
But, hey, it's convention. It's the code
speak that our society has evolved for a
man to say, "I think you're kinda spe
cial." And, in a way, by allowing a man to
do these things, a woman is responding
by saying, "You ain't so bad yourself." It
might be a little primitive, but sometimes
it's kind of nice.

Jeremy Desman, a senior majoring in
public policy, thinks it's rather weird, tc

end of every column.
