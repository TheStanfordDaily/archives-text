## Researchers develop Intelligent Observer robot Robot autonomously collects visual data and adapts to environment

In"The Empire Strikes Back,"
the Empire sends out thousands
of probe droids all across the
galaxy to find the Rebels.
These probe droids may seem
like science fiction, but at the
Stanford Robotics Laboratory,
Computer Science Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe and his team of
researchers have been working
on developing an "intelligent"
robot that can gather, collect
and transmit data in complex
environments, similar to the
probe droids featured in "Star
Wars."
The Stanford Robotics Labo
ratory was opened in the mid
-1960s as an extension of the
Stanford Hand-Eye Project,
itself an outgrowth of the Uni
versity's Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory.
Most of the research conduct
ed in the lab is aimed at making
robots more autonomous and
self-sufficient.
Latombe's team has devel
oped a robot that can intelligent
ly gather visual data from its
surrounding environment and
create a virtual world accessible
over the Internet.
"The Intelligent Observer's

primary mission is to gather
visual information and to be
smart about it — not just to
have a couple of fixed cameras to
extract information," said post
doctoral fellow Steve LaValle, a
research affiliate.
The research team is primari-

invisible'

ly focused on solving three main
problems with these robots:
environmental model building,
target finding and target track
ing.
In order for the robot to move
around effectively in its environ
ment, it must be able to con
struct a reliable model of its sur
roundings and keep track of its
own location.

The robot does this by scan
ning the contours of its environ
ment with a laser. It then fuses
all of its data together to con
struct a virtual 3-D representa
tion of its environment. The
robot then adds texture to this
representation.
"The next problem is finding
a target to track," LaValle
explained. "You want to make
sure that you move the robot
around in a systematic way so
that it can find it."
The final step is actually
tracking the target once it has
been found. Latombe's group
has developed algorithms to
track predictable and partially
predictable targets.
A target's predictability is
measured by how much informa
tion the Intelligent Observer
knows in advance about the tar
get, such as the target's maxi
mum speed or rate of accelera
tion.
This technology being devel
oped by Latombe and his team
has many potential applications
in the real world.
Medical surgeons could use
these observers to record and
project video displays of the area
of tissue being operated on. If an
obstacle obstructs the robot's

view, it will intelligently maneu
ver around the obstruction to
keep the tissue in sight.
"We want the observer to be
something that you don't have
to control," LaValle said. "It's
just magically doing some work
for you. It's behind the scenes
and gathering the information
that you need. We would like it
to be transparent or invisible."
According to David Lin, a doc
toral student, the Intelligent
Observer could also help camer
amen track athletes at a sport
ing event, find and rescue
trapped or lost cave explorers
and help baby-sit kids by track
ing them and alerting the baby
sitter if one wanders beyond a
certain point.
Assoc. Computer Science
Prof. Yoav Shohain, director of
the robotics laboratory, empha
sized the importance of develop
ing this technology.
"Our world is getting very
complicated, and the key to
being able to use this technology
usefully as it gets more complex
is to relegate more autonomy to
robots," he said.
"We want to increase the
degree of automation and intelli
gence on the part of the
machines."
