Examining mildly abnormal Pap test results

A new study launched by the National Cancer
Institute should help resolve a serious controversy
doctors currently face over diagnosing mildly abnor
mal Pap tests.
Every year, millions of women undergo Pap tests
— the routine screening exam for cervical cancer.
The test often uncovers mildly abnormal cells lining
the cervix, which can either return to normal over

time or lead to more substantial problems like cancer.
Doctors typically ask for a colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix
when these mild abnormalities are found in two consecutive Pap
tests taken within a few months.
However, such procedures may be unnecessary. Kent Nowels,
associate professor of pathology and director of cytopathology at
the Stanford Medical Center, said many cases resolve themselves
without treatment.
According to Dr. Diane Solomon, one of the NCI study's project
officers, "We may be overtreating these mild abnormalities in
many cases. The new trial will determine whether physicians can
safely take an approach that is less aggressive. If so, millions of
women could avoid colposcopy and biopsy each year. "
Nowels added that these unnecessary procedures "can defeat
the purpose of an inexpensive screening test." Furthermore, he
said the study "could be extremely helpful in determining how
aggressive we should be" in diagnosing and treating women who
display abnormal Pap test results.
I)ru£ cocktail restores immunity

A recent study completed by the National Insti
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases may provide
new hope for HIV-infected patients. Preliminary
results of the study indicate that a three-drug "cock
tail" designed to combat HIV can significantly
restore immunity in infected patients.
By taking a combination of the drugs known as
AZT, 3TC and ritonavir, patients experienced

decreased blood plasma levels of HIV, increased T-cell counts,
decreased risk of opportunistic infections and decreased short
term mortality.
Dr. Michael Lederman, protocol chair of the study and director
of the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit at the University Hospital of
Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University, said in a state
ment, "The significance of this study is that it will give us real
clues to how the immune response recovers after therapy."
David Katzenstein, assistant professor of infectious disease at
Stanford's School of Medicine, does research on HIV 7 and agrees
that "over a 1- to 2-year period, drug cocktails are much more
effective than standard drug treatments." However, he added, the
drug cocktail is not the ultimate answer to the epidemic, but sim
ply "part of the process."
' Until that answer is found, these new drug cocktails will help
extend the lives of patients with HIV and AIDS.
