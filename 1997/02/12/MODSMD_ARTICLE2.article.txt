# Student campaign debated at forum
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Students met with faculty and
representatives from the Presi
dent and Provost's Offices in an
open forum last night to discuss is
sues raised by the ASSU's current
"University for Students" cam
paign.
The panelists included Assis
tant to University President
Jacqueline Wender, Asst. Provost
Anne Fletcher, Haas Center
Nadinne Cruz, English Depart
ment Chair Ron Rebholz, Stanford
Review Editor in Chief Emeritus
Jeff Giesea and ASSU Special Pro
grams Director Michael Putnam.
Panelists disagreed over both
the broad general principles of the
campaign — that universities were
created for students and should
benefit both students and the larg
er society — and the campaign's
specifics.
Freshman Kumar Narayanan,
an ASSU intern who moderated
the forum, began by asking pan
elists if they agreed with the state
ment that "Stanford was a univer
sity for students and society."
All panelists answered yes, but
argued over the true meaning of
this statement and the principles
of the campaign.
"This question is the same as
asking, 'Are you for mom and apple
pie,' " Cruz said. "Everyone would
agree with this concept."
Giesea added his view on the
subject. "I appreciate the cam

paign, but it is misguided," he said.
"The university is for the pursuit
of truth. There are spill-over bene
fits for students and society."
Wender argued that the cam
paign is "flawed" in that it refers to
the broad concept of a "universi
ty," which she said does not exist as
one homogenous entity.
"There is no such thing as 'the
university,' " Wender said. "It is
made up of faculty, deans, the Of
fice of the President and the lead
ership of students."
According to Wender, the cam
paign should attempt to address is
sues individually.
"Because the ASSU represents
all students on campus, it is critical
that it fairly addresses student is
sues," Wender said. "It is flawed in
its attempt to speak too broadly."
"I question the issues that are
being chosen for this campaign,"
Fletcher added.
Panelists also disagreed as to
how the University should fulfill
its responsibility toward students
and society. Specific programs pro
posed by the campaign, such as the
progressive endowment fund, pub
lic service minor and renewed sup
port for interdisciplinary pro
grams were also debated.
According to Fletcher, individ
ual students have the responsibili
ty to decide how they want to con
tribute to society.
"Personal choice is involved in
what students decide to do here,'

Assistant to the President Jacqueline Wender argues that teaching,
learning and research should be treated as equal within a university.
She spoke at last night's "University for Students" forum, sponsored
by the ASSU and the Office of the President.
