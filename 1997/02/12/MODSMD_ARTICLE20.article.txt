# Scientists study gold deposit formation

"Dante's Peak" exploded in
theaters across the country last
weekend, depicting massive vol
canic destruction. At the same
time, scientists in the Depart
ment of Geological and Environ
mental Sciences were busy con
tinuing their research on the for
mation of ore deposits from
magma underneath volcanoes.
Magma, or molten rock, con
sists of a mixture of elements
including, among other things,
silicon, potassium, water, gold
and copper.
As magma cools, minerals
such as feldspar and quartz
begin to form. The residual com
pounds that do not crystallize
into granite-forming minerals
become supersaturated and a
water-rich fluid separates off
from the magma much like the
separation of oil and vinegar.
These water-rich solutions,
called ore fluids, begin to flow
upward, away from the magma,
through cracks and fissures in
the earth. As these fluids cool,
they form mineral veins in rocks,
collectively called porphyry
deposits.
Geological and Environmen
tal Sciences Prof. Marco Einaudi
and his research team are study
ing how the magmas and fluids
that form porphyry deposits
evolve over time. The research is
focused on the question of how
ore fluids from the porphyry
travel upward to form shallower
gold-rich deposits called epither
mal deposits.
"The big question for us is
how these two deposit types are
related," doctoral student
Patrick Redmond explained.
Active volcanoes throughout
the world are underlain by cool
ing magmas. Geologists sample
the gasses evolving from these
volcanoes.
"The more we study the vol
canic emissions consisting of
gases and particulates, the more
we find out that volcanoes aren't
just spewing out sulfur dioxide
and water vapor," Einaudi said.
"They also emit metals, and if
you calculate the amount of
metal that we think is coming
out during the lifetime of a typi
cal volcano, they are roughly
equivalent to a world class ore

body of copper and gold."
The link between the por
phyry deposits and the forma
tion of shallower epithermal gold
deposits is particularly difficult
to establish because they are sel
dom found together in ancient
volcanic systems.
Porphyry deposits are usually
found 2 to 3 kilometers below
the Earth's surface whereas
epithermal gold deposits form
less than 1 kilometer below the
earth's surface. This means
many gold deposits that once
overlaid porphyry deposits have
already been eroded away
because of their close proximity
to the surface.
There are only five places in
the world where these two sys
tems have been found located
next to each other. Einaudi and
his team are currently studying
one of these sites, located in the
Potrerillos district of northern
Chile.

It is still possible, however, to
argue that these two systems are
completely separate items and
that they just happened to turn
up together by chance.
One way to establish whether
these two systems are the same
is to date the rocks. If they
formed from separate systems,
they would have been formed at
different times.
"If you date the rocks and find
that they are the exact same age,
then it is good evidence that they
formed from the same system,"
Redmond said.
Einaudi's team uses argon
dating because it can accurately
date rocks as old as 3.6 billion
years. Carbon dating, on the
other hand, can only accurately
date rocks up to 50,000 years old
By examining the mineral
veins present in rocks near the
porphyry system, Einaudi's
team can also determine the
composition of the ore fluid

being generated from the magma
and how it has changed over
time. This will help them under
stand how these ore fluids actu
ally form gold deposits.
Once the process of ore
deposit formation is understood,
Einaudi hopes to he able to pre
dict gold deposit formation.
"Our research develops mod
els that the mineral exploration
industry can apply toward look
ing for new mineral deposits,"
said doctoral student Kurt
Friehauf.
Although it's possible to
extract gold without ever having
to know how the gold got there,
"from the scientific point of
view, we would like to establish
how the gold got into the rocks
and to be able to predict the loca
tion of gold deposits." Redmond
said.
This will allow mining compa
nies to look for ore deposits more
intelligently and efficiently.
