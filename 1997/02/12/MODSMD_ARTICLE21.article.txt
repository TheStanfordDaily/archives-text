Q, How do the automatic gates
, around campus work r

A.lf you've ever set foot on
• Stanford's campus, you've
probably seen these gates all
over the place — they look like
toll booths, with the exception
that only the privileged few who
have special access cards can
open them.
If you don't have a card, you
can't drive onto the main cam
pus because of those little flimsy
plastic arms that are apparently
robust enough to keep your
2,000-pound car from getting
through.
To a driver intent on illegally
entering onto the main campus,
say, to take a driving tour of the
Main Quad, these gates provide a

significant barrier. But if you
ever somehow "accidentally" find
yourself in a car on the inside of
a gate, you may have noticed that
it's not nearly as hard to get out.
Whenever a large vehicle
approaches the gate from the
inside, it pops open and then
shuts again after the vehicle has
made its way out.
As a bicyclist, you may have
also ridden through one of these
gates at some point and seen it
jump hesitantly, as if it weren't
sure whether you're a car or not.
Given these two facts, most
people jump to the conclusion
that the gates are hooked up to
pressure plates. If you look at the
ground inside of these gates, you

will find that there is a large sec
tion that has been cut, where
something has obviously been
buried underneath the pavement.
The problem with the pres
sure plate theory, however, is
that even with five people stand
ing on the inside, the gate will
not open. However, many a
lighter golf cart has passed
through without any trouble.
So what's going on? Under
neath the pavement is the same
technology used in drive
through restaurants and traffic
intersections — a large, inverted
metal detector.
The metal detector is essen
tially a coil of wire, buried under
ground and wired in a circuit

called an LC circuit. An alternat
ing current passes through the
circuit at a frequency dependent
on a certain characteristic of the
coil called its inductance.
The inductance of the coil
determines how the wire loop
creates a magnetic field based on
the current passing through it.
As the inductance changes, so
does the frequency of the alter
nating current.
One way to change the induc
tance of the coil is to place a
large metal plate over it, such as
a car. The magnetic field gener
ated by the coil interacts with
the car, changing its induc
tance, which can then be detect
ed by a change of frequency in

the LC circuit.
A metal plate is not the only
way to a fleet the inductance of the
coil. Any object which can mutu
ally induct with the coil will work.
For instance, another inductor, or
coil of wire, will work. An exten
sion cord, coiled and plugged into
itself provides a perfect inductor
to set off the pate.
I tried this the other night
with three of my friends.
Although we couldn't set off the
gate by weight, when we tossed
the extension cord onto the
plate, the gate popped open,
which we found hilarious.
When we tried it at Jack in
the Box at 3 a.m., they weren't
nearly as amused.
