## Tuneup Netters face UOP 
### Lindsay Amstutz 
The highly favored No. 2 Stan
ford women's tennis team (4-0)
will take on Pacific today at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium at 1:30
p.m., in what will serve as a key
tuneup for the weekend.
While Pacific doesn't have
much of a chance of pulling off an
upset, its team is considered one of
the best in Northern California,
behind Stanford and Cal.
"They're a nice team for us to
play. We're looking for a good com
petitive match to get us going,"
said head coach Frank Brennan.
The Pacific matchup will be a
"good workout to get ready for the
weekend."
A highly anticipated match
against UNLV on Friday will
prove a test for the Cardinal. Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference con
test against Oregon should also
provide Stanford with a challenge.
With the Rolex National Indoor
Tournament and individual
events behind them, today's game
will offer the players an opportuni
ty to focus on playing together as
they head into team competition.
"It'll be fun having everyone
back and playing together out
there," Brennan said.
Freshman Anne Kremer will
step into tho No. 1 position for the
matchup against Pacific. Slu>
moved into the top spot after bat
tling back from injuries and looks
forward to a strong showing in the
match today.
"I'm excited to watch her play
now that she's finally healthy,"
Brennan said.
After winning the doubles
championship at the Rolex tour
nament this past weekend, juniors
Ania Bleszynski and .Julie Scott
will enter in the No. 2 and No. 3
singles spots. The pair will also
team up as the No. 1 doubles seed
for the Cardinal.
FYeshmen Tervn Ashley, Jen
Heiser and junior Heidi Stalla will
fill in at the fourth, fifth and sixth
positions for Stanford. Senior
Emily Burt will team up with
Heiser in the doubles competition.
The Cardinal will be without
senior Katie Schlukebir, who is in
Michigan playing in a Midland
professional tournament. The
match will therefore allow the
Cardinal to add to its team depth
by allowing some of the non
starters to gain some valuable
experience.
Even without Schlukebir, the
confident Cardinal should have lit
tle trouble with the Tigers. Look
ing forward to a supportive home
crowd, the Stanford women hope
to continue their winning routine.
