The Stanford baseball team (7-3) was on fire yester
day at Sunken Diamond as it beat the Nevada Wolf
Pack (4-3) 15-3.
The Cardinal offense combined for a season-high 17
hits, while the pitching staff allowed only three hits
through the whole game.
"I am very pleased," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "We were really swinging the bat well."
"We came out ready to play," said junior Joe Kil
burg, who went 3-for-4 with four RBIs to lead Stan
ford's offense.
"It feels real good to come out and do what you are

runs scored.
The Card used a five-run third inning to put the
Wolf Pack away. With Kilburg on first after drawing a

the plate. Senior left fielder Chris Clark then smashed
a ground ball that deflected off third baseman Andy
Dominique's glove and ended up in left field. This drove
in two runs, bumping the score to 5-2. Clark then stole
second, and Nevada catcher Corky Miller overthrew
the base, allowing Gerut to score. The inning was
capped off with sophomore Josh Hochgesang's RBI sin

The Card never let up, adding two more runs in the
fourth, four in the seventh, and tacked on two in its last
frame at bat.
Sophomore pitcher Brent Hoard gave an impressive
performance in his first career start for the Cardinal.
