# Baseball shells the Wolfpack with 17 hits

### Jen Splansky Contributing writer 
The Stanford baseball team (7-3) was on fire yester
day at Sunken Diamond as it beat the Nevada Wolf
Pack (4-3) 15-3.
The Cardinal offense combined for a season-high 17
hits, while the pitching staff allowed only three hits
through the whole game.
"I am very pleased," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "We were really swinging the bat well."
"We came out ready to play," said junior Joe Kil
burg, who went 3-for-4 with four RBIs to lead Stan
ford's offense.
"It feels real good to come out and do what you are
trying to do," Kilburg said. "The work is paying off."
In the first inning, junior designated hitter Jon
Schaeffer hit his third home run in as many at bats,
and his fourth of the season. Schaeffer had a nearly
flawless outing, going 3-for-3 with two RBIs and two
runs scored.
The Card used a five-run third inning to put the
Wolf Pack away. With Kilburg on first after drawing a
walk, freshman first baseman John Gall hit r. stand-up
double to put runners on the corners. After Schaeffer
was hit bv a pitch, loading the bases, sophomore center
fielder Jody Gerut drew a walk, forcing a run to cross
the plate. Senior left fielder Chris Clark then smashed
a ground ball that deflected off third baseman Andy
Dominique's glove and ended up in left field. This drove
in two runs, bumping the score to 5-2. Clark then stole
second, and Nevada catcher Corky Miller overthrew
the base, allowing Gerut to score. The inning was
capped off with sophomore Josh Hochgesang's RBI sin
gle up the middle.
The Card never let up, adding two more runs in the
fourth, four in the seventh, and tacked on two in its last
frame at bat.
Sophomore pitcher Brent Hoard gave an impressive
performance in his first career start for the Cardinal.
The southpaw allowed only two hits through five
innings, while striking out six.
"I focused on the whole game instead of just an

inning," Hoard said. "They were
pretty close to the scouting report."
Junior lefty Josh Koons pitched
a nearly flawless final four innings,
gaining the save for Stanford by
allowing the Wolf Pack only one hit.
The Cardinal suffered a blow,
however, with an injury to second
baseman and leadoff hitter Tony
Schrager. The sophomore appeared
to hurt his ankle by hitting first
base awkwardly during the sixth
inning.
"This will hurt us greatly," Mar
quess said. "It is a real blow to us."
With the injury, Kilburg moved
from right field to second base.
""This is a definite hindrance to
the team," Kilburg said. "I hope I
will be able to fill his shoes, but for
now it is really tough."
Kilburg certainly did his duty
at second base today, ending the
game with a beautiful diving
backhand on a ground ball up the
middle.

kind to Stanford stars yester
