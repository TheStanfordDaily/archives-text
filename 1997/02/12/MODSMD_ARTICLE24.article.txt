# Synchro dominates Minnesota Invite
## 
### Scott Judd 
Powered by a dynamic mix
of senior leadership and
young talent, the undefeated
synchronized swimming team
will host its first home meet of
the year Saturday in the Stan
ford Invitational at deGuerre
Pool. The meet begins at 1
p.m.
The Cardinal, who is cur
rently ranked second in the
nation, looks to continue the
early-season dominance that
was most recently evident in
Sunday's triumph at the Min
nesota Invitational.
With a point total of 81 at
the meet, Stanford swam cir
cles around host Minnesota,
whose total of 61.5 placed

them a distant second. Car
leton and lowa, who rounded
out the competition, lagged
even further behind with
scores of 33 and 28, respec
tively. Those lopsided totals
belie the extent of Stanford's
dominance; the Cardinal
swept all the routine events,
including five of the top six
spots in figures competition.
Although Olympic gold
medalist Heather Pease did
not travel to Minnesota with
the team, her absence was
effortlessly filled by freshman
sensation Julie Enos. A veter
an of the synchronized swim
ming national team, Enos
dominated the invitational by
capturing first-place finishes in
the figures, duet, trio and team
competitions.
Enos scored 56.589 in figures,
placing her .49 points ahead of
Cardinal sophomore Catherine
Chen. Enos and Chen later
paired up to claim the duet
championship with a 86.267
total. Senior Amy Markezick,
who placed third in figures,
joined Enos and Chen in seizing
the trio competition as they
swam away with a score of
82.267. Enos also aided in Stan
ford's team competition victory,
where the Cardinal's score of
84.033 was nearly 13 points
above second-place Minnesota's
71.467.
"Julie swims extremely well.
None of us were surprised by
her performance," said senior

Co-captain Maia Young, who
completed Stanford's sweep by
conquering the solo event with
an 81.133 tally. "Julie's a very
strong, very talented swimmer.
Sunday was just another day in
the pool for her."
After this Saturday's invita
tional at deGuerre, the Cardinal
hopes to increase its win streak
by next traveling to a Sunday
meet in Arizona. However,
Young stressed that the team is
focused on achieving a more
long-term goal — avenging last
year's loss to Ohio State at the
NCAA Championships next
month.
"The (Minnesota) meet pro
vided us with good experience,"
Young said. "It's the start of the
season, and we're still trying to
get comfortable with being in
front of the judges and swim
ming in an indoor pool. We're
glad about how we swam, but we
are looking toward nationals as
our main competition."
