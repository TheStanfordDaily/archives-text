# Fencers vanquish Columbia
## 
### James Greene 
With shaved heads and dyed-red hair, the third
ranked Stanford fencing team traveled to North
Carolina last weekend to compete with attitude. The
fencers' look and performance served as a quick
reminder to the schools competing that the Cardinal
was out for victory.
Led by head coach Zoran Tulum, a two-time
Olympic coach, the team finished second behind No.
2 Notre Dame and ahead of fifth-ranked Columbia.
"We belong to the cream of the crop," Tulum
said, pleased with the Card's performance.
The Columbia defeat was especially satisfying, as
last weekend was the first time that Stanford has
ever defeated the New York school in overall compe
tition.
The Stanford team left its mark by winning twu
of the tournament's five events. With sophomores
Sean McClain, a member of the U.S Olympic team
and Alden Clarke, one of the top 10 fencers in the
country, the Cardinal was undefeated in both the
men's foil and men's epee competition Notre Dame
swept the other three events, winning the men's
saber, women's foil and women's epee. The other
schools — Duke, North Carolina, Columbia and Air
Force — were left out in the cold.
According to Tulum, the team achieved its two
goals for the tournament. Stanford established itself

as a fencing power in a sport traditionally dominat
ed by Eastern schools, and it soundly defeated its
lone West Coast rival, Air Force.
The young team offered several stellar individual
performances. The six men of the foil and epee
teams each won an average of 15 nine-minute bouts,
and few lost more than once. However, it was fresh
man Monique de Bruin, Stanford's standout female
fencer, that turned in the most impressive perfor
mance of the day. She won 20 straight bouts with
out a single loss. She was undefeated, and even
Zorro would have met his match.
However, it was not individual performances
that won the tournament. All members of the team
performed well, from the nationally ranked fencers
to the five members of the team that began fencing
in a physical education class a mere six months
ago.
"We have such a huge variety of talent, but we die
very, very well," said senior Mary Barsanti, th<
women's team captain.
Despite the weekend's success, the Cardinal wil
not rest on its laurels The team plans to spend tht
next weeks correcting problems that surfaced ir
North Carolina, in order to prepare for the Westerr
Regional tournament at the beginning of next
month. If all goes according to plan, the team will
win with ease.
"We will clean up everything," Tulum said.
