# Jogging at Stanford
## Why run when you can dance? 
### 
Everyone does it. Jogs, that
is. Every time I drive on
campus, I have a hard time
dodging all of the joggers in their
sneakers and T-shirts. For some
reason, all of the joggers are really
fond of running on Campus Drive.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
doesn't traveling on foot allow
more mobility within the confines
of the campus?
Bikers must learn where the
steps are, people with golf carts
have to watch out for steps and
trees, and drivers, unfortunately,
have to confine themselves to the
road. But foot travelers can basi
cally go anywhere they choose
They can climb Mount Rushmore,
they can trek to the top of Half
dome — they don't have to all be
jogging on Campus Drive during
rush hour. And those headphones
prevent them from hearing you
honk for them to hurry up and
cross already.
I find it interesting that these
joggers don't run into each other
as they are jogging. What happens
when a pack of cross country run
ners happens to be coming straight
at you, and you look up from your
panting and sweating to realize
that the mob will soon overtake
you? Is there jogging etiquette?
1 confess. I thought about being
a jogger once. I mean one of those
biker short-clad joggers, maybe
with a matching sports bra and, of
course, the Walkman. It is the ulti
mate California image — toned, in
shape and trendy. Then I realized
that it was so much easier to drive
from point A to point Band also so
much less strenuous. I suppose I
could wear a cute workout outfit to
power walk, but somehow it just
doesn't have the same image. The
whole power walk strut with the

arms swinging, while practical
effective and low impact, tends tc
remind me of the mall-walkers we
had in my hometown in Texas whc
would go the mall after church or
Sunday in their dresses and sneak
ers to "work out," and catch up or
the latest sales, in the cool air con
ditioning.
Also, I find that exercise suc
ceeds only in creating a bigger
appetite, thus counteracting the

benefits. Right? OK. so I'm
stretching it. But I do think that
there are much niotv fun ;uid effec
tive ways of exercising without
running around with no destina
tion with dozens o( other people
that are going no place in particu
lar as well.
For example, sports are both
physically demanding and enjoy
able It doesn't seem like exercise
when the goal is to destroy the
other team. Exercise is just so
much more fun when aggression
and anger are integral parts Plus,
you don't have to 1m" part of any
sports team to plav a pickup game
of basketball, football or frisbee.
Dancing also is another form of
exercise that just doesn't seem like
it until you stop and realize that
you are sweating and out <>i breath.
If you think about it, dancing is
