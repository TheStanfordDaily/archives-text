# Hockey beats Bruins twice, prepares for postseason play
## 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
The Stanford ice hockey
team continued its winning
ways last weekend with two
consecutive victories over
UCLA. Playing on home ice in
Redwood City, the Cardinal
beat the Bruins 5-0 Friday
night, and 6-3 in Saturday
night's game.
Stanford coach Ernie Ferrari
called the wins "good games for
us as we try and prepare for the
postseason." Friday's effort, in
front of a small crowd, was "a
very well-played game for both
teams.
"We worked hard to polish
our game as much as we could,"
said Ferrari. "UCLA played
well defensively — we outshot
them by a lot, but we weren't
scoring early on."
Stanford held a 2-0 lead at
the end of the second period.
Ferrari attributed the score to
a good defensive effort by
UCLA's goaltender. But under
the constant barrage of Stan
ford shots, by the third period
the floodgates opened up, and
Stanford scored three more
goals to win the game easily.
Saturday night's game had
no effect on Stanford's ranking
for the upcoming Pacific 8 Con
ference and national tourna
ments; as a result, it was a no
pressure situation in which the
team could just go out and
enjoy playing hockey. Many
players who don't usually see
playing time were inserted;
during one power play, five
defensemen were on the ice.
The focus was not so much on
running plays as on having fun.
"It was a fun game," Ferrari
said. "We took a lot of shots on
them, and we enjoyed it."
Up next for the Stanford
team is the Pac-8 tournament,
which will be played at USC
Feb. 22 and 23. Stanford will
meet the host team for its first
match, in what Ferrari expects
to be a good contest.
"USC is a good team that

has improved a lot since last
year and is coming on strong in
the second half of the season,"
he said. "It should be a good
match." Key for Stanford will
be the execution of plays like
the offensive zone against its
toughest opponent in the Pac-8.
Stanford has a good track
record, though, having beaten
the Trojans all three times the
two squads have met this year.
At nationals, the Cardinal
can look forward to tough com
petition from teams like Penn
State, Ohio State and Michigan
State. The tournament, held in
St. Louis in early March, will
showcase the best four teams
from each region of the country.
Stanford has already secured

one of the Western Region's
spots.
Ferrari sees the national
tournament as "a great oppor
tunity for us, a great chance to
learn and grow." Because the
Stanford team is very young
this year, with several key
freshmen playing significant
roles, "there is a lot of potential
— we could do really well, but
we can't make any mistakes,"
he said.
A key factor will be the
young Stanford team's lack of
experience in major tourna
ments. However, Ferrari
believes the team can do well if
it can overcome that obstacle.
"We have a chance to win it
all," Ferrari said.
