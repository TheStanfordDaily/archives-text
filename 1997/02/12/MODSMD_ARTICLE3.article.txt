Wall Street brings to mind images of men in three
piece suits carrying briefcases, making multimillion
dollar transactions just by picking up the phone. Here
at Stanford, members of the Charles Blyth Fund also
have an opportunity to jump into the fast-paced stock
market.
Created in 1978, the Charles Blyth Fund is an en
tirely student-run organization for those with an in
terest in the financial world. The original $75,000 en
dowment came from an anonymous associate of Blyth,
who received his MBA from the Graduate School of
Business.
Students in the fund gain real-life experience by ac
tually investing the stock market.
"At a meeting someone might propose a stock or an -
other, and then we'll consider it, adjourn and do re
search and meet again and vote on it," said Co-presi
dent Van Quach, a senior.
Stocks include AETNA, United Health Care,
Landry's Sea Food and Boyd's Wheels, said sophomore
Mark Brewton, the fund secretary.
Typically in a meeting, Brewton said, they "run
through a portfolio, which is usually six to 10 stocks,"
Brewton said. Members also discuss general economic
news and talk about how the market is doing.
Currently, the group has about 120 members, eight
of whom serve on the board of directors. The other
seven to 10 are associate members and visitors, Quach
said. There are three levels of membership: visitor, as
sociate member and member.
Visitors are just that â€” people who attend meet
ings but otherwise have no other responsibilities. After
a month, they may apply to become associate mem
bers, Brewton said.
At the second level, associate members make pre
sentations and suggest stocks but do not have voting
privileges. After a quarter, an associate member may
then apply to become a member of the board of direc
tors, Brewton said.
