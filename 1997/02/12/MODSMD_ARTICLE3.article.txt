# Group supports stock investing

Wall Street brings to mind images of men in three
piece suits carrying briefcases, making multimillion
dollar transactions just by picking up the phone. Here
at Stanford, members of the Charles Blyth Fund also
have an opportunity to jump into the fast-paced stock
market.
Created in 1978, the Charles Blyth Fund is an en
tirely student-run organization for those with an in
terest in the financial world. The original $75,000 en
dowment came from an anonymous associate of Blyth,
who received his MBA from the Graduate School of
Business.
Students in the fund gain real-life experience by ac
tually investing the stock market.
"At a meeting someone might propose a stock or an -
other, and then we'll consider it, adjourn and do re
search and meet again and vote on it," said Co-presi
dent Van Quach, a senior.
Stocks include AETNA, United Health Care,
Landry's Sea Food and Boyd's Wheels, said sophomore
Mark Brewton, the fund secretary.
Typically in a meeting, Brewton said, they "run
through a portfolio, which is usually six to 10 stocks,"
Brewton said. Members also discuss general economic
news and talk about how the market is doing.
Currently, the group has about 120 members, eight
of whom serve on the board of directors. The other
seven to 10 are associate members and visitors, Quach
said. There are three levels of membership: visitor, as
sociate member and member.
Visitors are just that â€” people who attend meet
ings but otherwise have no other responsibilities. After
a month, they may apply to become associate mem
bers, Brewton said.
At the second level, associate members make pre
sentations and suggest stocks but do not have voting
privileges. After a quarter, an associate member may
then apply to become a member of the board of direc
tors, Brewton said.
Directors hold the power of vot
ing on the stocks in which the fund
will invest, Brewton said. The
board of directors also votes on ap
plications for membership at each
level.
However, "everybody, all under
graduates, are welcome to attend
meetings," said Quach. "Although
meetings may seem intimidating or
high-brow, they provide a lot train
ing for individuals."
Making money is not the only
benefit members reap from their
investment.
"We want to give undergradu
ates a unique experience in invest
ing, but also making friendships,"
Quach said. "Blyth Fund members

can make friends for life."
Quach explained that financial
performance has typically been sec
ondary to learning experience as a
goal of thefund.
"Moreover, the turnover of
management makes it difficult to
maintain a consistent style,"
Quach said.
Even with through those
changes, the fund has been guided
by spending policies.
According to Quach, 25 percent
of the money is reinvested. Another
25 percent goes back to the Stan
ford community in the form of
scholarships in Blyth's name.
"Over the three years that I've
been with the fund, we've given
anywhere from about $650 to over
$1,000," Quach said. "Over the 20
years, it really does add up."
The remaining 50 percent is
then used as an expense account for

members of the fund, Quach said.
"Our goal is to give anyone with
the desire to learn a chance. We
want to give undergraduates a
unique experience in investing,"
Quach said. "I think it is one of the
best experiences you can have at
Stanford. Blyth investors do phe
nomenally well in the job market."
Notable alumni include Joe
Lemont, current chief executive of
ficer of Trilogy and former presi
dent of the fund.
"There's a certain corporate
awareness of the Blyth Fund.
We're developing a certain respect
among alumni," Said Brewton.
Brewton said the future goals of
the fund include "continuing and
strengthening our relationship
with Wall Street firms, in the broad
sense, not necessarily in New York
and increasing awareness of the
fund on campus."
