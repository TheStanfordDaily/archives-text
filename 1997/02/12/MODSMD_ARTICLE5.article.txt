# 4% tuition hike OK'd
## Next year's tuition bill will be more than $21,000 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees approved
a tuition increase of 4 percent yes
terday — the same as last year's in
crease, which was the lowest in
three decades.
"We do want to continue to at
tract all segments of society and not
price ourselves out," said Robert
Bass, the board's chairman.
Annual tuition will rise from
$20,490 to $21,300, while the room
and board will increase by 3 percent,
from $7,337 to $7,557.
Together, the cost of tuition,
room and board for 1997-98 was set
at $28,857, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over the current total bill.
According to Bass, it is "not un
reasonable to project" that future
increases will remain consistent
with this year's figures.
"Obviously, we are concerned
with the level of tuition," Bass said,
adding that the board has tried to
keep tuition increases consistent
with growth in family income
Law student David Bradfute, a
representative on the board's Com

mittee on Academic Policy, Plan
ning and Management, said the
Provost's Office has been "very re
sponsible" in asking for the tuition
increase, which "pretty much
matches the increase in median
family income."
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price
Index revealed a 3-percent climb in
prices between February 1996 and
Januaiy 1997.
Prior to the 4-percent increase
last year, tuition climbed by 5.5 per
cent in 1995, 7.5 percent in 1993 and
9.5 percent in 1992.
Reductions in administrative
costs have allowed the University to
"constrain the increase" in fees,
Bass said
He added that there is little about
the University's budget "that is dis
cretionary, except adding professor
ial positions."
According to Bass, there is no dis
cussion of eliminating need-based fi
nancial aid

things to cut," he said, noting that
containing costs is "an ongoing
struggle."
Bass also pointed out that univer
sities are "by their nature very labor
intensive places," so improvements
in productivity result in increasing
value, not decreasing costs.
He also predicted that the de
mand for raises and the salaries of
the people at the top of academic dis
ciplines will not go down.
"The trustees had a tough deci
sion to make," said ASSU President
Bill Shen. "It's extremely fair, al
though obviously disappointing."
However, Shen expressed con
cern that the pattern of tuition in
creases will "slowly squeeze out
some middle-class students" in the
long term.
"If this trend continues, we are
basically reserving Stanford educa
tion for the truly privileged," he said.
According to Bradfute, the future

tuition changes are difficult to pre
dict because they will "depend on
what the federal government does
with respect to research funding,"
on stock market returns and on gifts
to the University.
The market has been generous
with returns on the University's en
dowment, Bass said, although he

warned that Stanford "cannot count
on continuing" that trend.
He added that thanks to hard
work and generous alumni, gifts to
Stanford surpassed those of Har
vard University's last year. Current
gifts are running "substantially
ahead" of those collected at the same
time last year.
