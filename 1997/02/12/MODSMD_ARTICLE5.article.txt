### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees approved
a tuition increase of 4 percent yes
terday — the same as last year's in
crease, which was the lowest in
three decades.
"We do want to continue to at
tract all segments of society and not
price ourselves out," said Robert
Bass, the board's chairman.
Annual tuition will rise from
$20,490 to $21,300, while the room
and board will increase by 3 percent,
from $7,337 to $7,557.
Together, the cost of tuition,
room and board for 1997-98 was set
at $28,857, an overall increase of 3.7
percent over the current total bill.
According to Bass, it is "not un
reasonable to project" that future
increases will remain consistent
with this year's figures.
"Obviously, we are concerned
with the level of tuition," Bass said,
adding that the board has tried to
keep tuition increases consistent
with growth in family income
Law student David Bradfute, a
representative on the board's Com

mittee on Academic Policy, Plan
ning and Management, said the
Provost's Office has been "very re
sponsible" in asking for the tuition
increase, which "pretty much
matches the increase in median
family income."
According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price
Index revealed a 3-percent climb in
prices between February 1996 and
Januaiy 1997.
Prior to the 4-percent increase
last year, tuition climbed by 5.5 per
cent in 1995, 7.5 percent in 1993 and
9.5 percent in 1992.
Reductions in administrative
costs have allowed the University to
"constrain the increase" in fees,
Bass said
He added that there is little about
the University's budget "that is dis
cretionary, except adding professor
ial positions."
According to Bass, there is no dis
cussion of eliminating need-based fi
nancial aid
"We have really gotten through
the low-hantrinir fruit, the easv
