# ASSU confirms second judicial council nominee
## Senate approves former chair Kasrawi in 12-6 vote 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night on
ASSU President Bill Shen's recommenda
tions to appoint doctoral student Nawwar
Kasrawi to its Constitutional Council.
Kasrawi and sophomore Robert Win
dom were nominated for two of the four re
maining slots on the newly formed council,
which will oversee the proper enforcement
of the ASSU Constitution.
After a long debate, Kasrawi was ap
proved by a vote of 12-6. ASSU Vice Presi
dent Nick Thompson's vote was required
to achieve the necessary two-thirds major
ity.
The discussion of Kasrawi's appoint
ment began with a motion to extend the
floor time for senators beyond the two
minute maximum. For the first time this
year, such as motion was not approved.
Senate Chair Don Aingworth opened the
discussion stating, "Tonight I feel a bit like
Mark Antony, for I'm not here to bury
Nawwar nor am I here to praise him. We
are both the dinosaurs around here, and we
both have great respect for the constitution
and bylaws and all that is involved with the
ASSU."
He added that he and Kasrawi had two
different approaches to interpreting the
constitution. "I am an idealist, and he is a
pragmatist. When there is an ambiguity, I
stay close to the text. He tends to make de
cisions in that ambiguous realm .... He
hasn't broken the constitution, but he has
taken ambiguity and interpreted it to his
side."
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson echoed

Aingworth's concern, stating he did not
think that justices should have a mission.
ASSU Senator Howard Loo emphasized
that without a mechanism for removing a
justice from office, he could not vote for
Kasrawi in light of "his past partisan
stands."
Kasrawi, who served as ASSU senate
chair two years ago. was granted floor time
and assured the senate that he would use
his discretion should he be asked to consid
er legislation that he had either written or
was consulted about during his tenure in
the senate He also said he "had no interest
in being [the council's] chief justice."
ASSU Senator Harris Shapiro, who ab
stained from voting on Kasrawi, explained
his action saying, "I feel that [Kasrawi] is
very highly qualified and had more than
the requisite knowledge of the constitution
in both interpretation and practice, but I
had serious concerns about his impartiality
in applying this.
"I couldn't vote no because he was qual
ified, but I couldn't vote yes because there
may never be a provision for removing a
justice from office," he added.
The confirmation vote on sophomore
Robert Windom was tabled after the ASSU
members who interviewed Windom shared
mixed views on his candidacy.
Several senators cited that he seemed
to waffle during the interview and was
somewhat reluctant to take positions on
issues.
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock spoke
in Windom's defense, stating the "inter
view was rocky, and what [she] interpret-
