You're tired of towing the party line. You're looking for
some excitement in your life. You crave action. You want a
challenge. You want it? You got it. The Advanced Dungeons &
Dragons* Game is all that and more. It's you and a group of
friends playing characters, like warriors, wizards, and thieves, as
you explore and adventure your way through some of the wildest
worlds in fantasy and science fiction. It's learning how to work
together toward a common goal, solving problems creatively, and
walking around in someone else's shoes for a while. It's playing a
game where you control the action. You want to climb that tree, go
for it. You want to arm wrestle an ore, knock yourself out. It's
your call. There's no finish line to cross, no script to follow. The
only limit is that of your own imagination. So join the party with
the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Game from TSR.
It's Your Party. BTOB
