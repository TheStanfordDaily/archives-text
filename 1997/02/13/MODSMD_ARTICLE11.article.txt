Study finds cellular dangers
BOSTON (AP) â€” Talking on a cellular phone
behind the wheel is about as risky as driving close
to legally drunk, a study found.
Using a car phone while driving quadruples the
risk of an accident, Canadian researchers report
ed in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine. And making a call with a hands-free
model is just as dangerous.
The study is the first to measure the car phone
hazard.
While the fourfold chance of getting into an
accident is about the same as the increased risk
involved in driving with a blood-alcohol level
right at the legal limit, the researchers noted
that callers' extra risk drops back to normal as
soon as they hang up while near-drunk drivers
may be a menace for hours.
