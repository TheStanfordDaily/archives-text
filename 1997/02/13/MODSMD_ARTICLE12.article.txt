# American prepares for strike
## If airline faces pilot walkout, Clinton may intervene 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” American Airlines, brac
ing for a pilots' strike, is canceling tomorrow night
overseas flights, a spokesman said yesterday. Nego
tiations continued, a mediator said, but "slowly and
with increasing difficulty."
The White House said a strike would have major
economic consequences for the nation but stopped
short of saying President Clinton would try to step
in. The federal mediator said even the suggestion of
presidential intervention was hurting the talks.
The airline pilots' union has set a Friday mid
night strike deadline, and American was preparing
by making sure its planes weren't overseas if the
pilots walked out.
The union says it would prefer Clinton stay out of
the dispute over pay and job security. The airline
has been asking for administration involvement.
Clinton, asked about the situation, said, "This
issue has huge implications for our country and in

particular for specific parts of our country."
And aides said he had ordered staff members to
study the potential economic impact of a strike, a
possible step toward intervention.
But Clinton also said the negotiators should
"make maximum use of the mediation board pro
cess" rather than waiting for any outside effort.
"That is what ought to be done today, and that's all
I have to say about it today."
Airline and union negotiators met through the
day. But Ken Hipp, chairman of the National Medi
ation Board, said, "It is going slowly and with
increasing difficulty."
As for the sudden discussion of possible White
House intervention, he said, "It makes it much
more difficult to get an agreement at the table."
Grounding the nation's largest domestic airline
could result in layoffs of as many as 90,000 workers
and disrupt travel plans of many more Americans.
