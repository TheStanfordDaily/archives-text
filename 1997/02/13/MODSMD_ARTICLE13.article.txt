Trustees uphold tuition
promise but must ensure
small increases in future

LIKE DEATH AND taxes, a
hike in the cost of Stanford
tuition is a dreaded
inevitability. So although no one
enjoys the swift kick in the wallet
the University's Board of Trustees
delivers this time of the year, some
praise is nevertheless in order for
the board's restraint in hiking the
financial burden for the upcoming
school year.
For the 1997-98 academic year,
tuition will be a whopping $21,300
— an increase of 4 percent from
this year. Although this figure is at
once staggering, it very easily
could have been worse.
Upholding the promise it made
after the hefty tuition increases of
the early 19905, the board voted to
keep the rise in costs to less than 2
percent above inflation, as it did
this school year. But the board
could have, if it so chose, raised
tuition to 5 percent and still have
kept its promise. Students and
their families have the right to
complain about the added costs,
but they must also be thankful
that the board did not raise tuition
at levels like 1992's 9.5 percent.
The moderate increases for next
year are level with this year's fig
ures due to the continuing trend of
administrative streamlining, cost
efficiency maneuvers and a sizable
return on the University's endow
ment. And a record level of alumni
donations, which even surpassed
the venerable Harvard University
last year, helped convince the
board to keep tuition at bay.
Although students must give
thanks to such financial boosters,
they must also acknowledge that
such economic performances will
not last year after year. A reces
sion, a further cut in federal fund
ing, another Quad-busting earth

quake all could put the present
prosperity of the University in
danger. And even without a catas
trophic loss in revenue, Stanford
cannot forever depend on record
setting alumni gifts and a favor
able stock market to maintain a
reasonable increase in tuition.
According to Robert Bass, the
board's chairman, Stanford "can
not count on continuing" the
trend of peak financial perfor
mance.
Without outside help, students
must wonder what would happen
to the cost of tuition. University
President Gerhard Casper often
reminds students that tuition cov
ers barely half of the cost of a
Stanford education. Hence, to
finance each undergraduate's four
(or more) years at the University,
tuition — which has increased
$7,000 in seven years — could spi
ral even higher.
The board must strive to ensure
that such a situation will not
occur. Although Stanford will still
receive more than enough applica
tions to fill its freshman class, the
University will not get as diverse
an applicant pool as it desires
because students unable to afford
the rising costs of a Stanford edu
cation might choose not to apply.
Middle-class families, who are too
well off to qualify for federally
funded financial aid but too poor
to dig up over $120,000, might
direct their sons and daughters to
different campuses. In order to
maintain the University policy of
need-blind admission, which guar
antees the best-qualified students
admission regardless of financial
status, the board must seriously
determine how high tuition can
really go.
The board should be commend
ed for keeping tuition increases
consistent with growth in family
income. But it also needs to
remember that there will come a
time when tutition becomes unre
alistic for average families and
even the smallest increase in costs
will be beyond their means.
