## Unraveling the myths of leadership 
###

Annually 450
student organi
zations register
with the University,
170 students serve as
resident assistants and
225 students serve as
advising associates.
Other students serve
as teaching assistants,

perform community service, compete in
varsity athletics, conduct research and
run small businesses.
When asked to comment on their
roles as leaders, many hesitate to see
themselves as such. Asked to compose a
list of leaders, a short list is readily gen
erated: Martin Luther King, Ronald
Reagan, Mother Teresa. . . . Then
silence fills the room as students strug
gle to add others.
An interesting contradiction is evi
dent. While hundreds of students fulfill
campus leadership roles, many struggle
to see themselves or others as leaders.
This may be no surprise.
Societal ills can seem insurmount
able. Polls find that politicians, lawyers
and journalists have fallen in societal
respect. Why the dissonance? Perhaps
common assumptions limit our views
about leadership. Now is the time to
dispel some common leadership myths.
Once a leader, always a leader. Have
you seen individuals so comfortable

with themselves as leaders that when
ever the opportunity arises, they jump
to the lead? Experienced leaders are
important to group work but may not
be effective if the task differs from their
previous experience.
Would you want the person who
excels at leading a rafting trip to facili
tate an emotionally charged dorm dis
cussion, tutor you in computer science
or recruit six dormitory intramural
teams? Probably not. We all have lead
ership qualities that serve as strengths
and in certain circumstances even as
liabilities.
Delegation is key. Student leaders
frequently comment: "I want to learn
how to delegate — I'm doing too much,
while others are doing nothing!" Sound
familiar? Inspiration, not delegation, is
the key to effective leadership.
1 admit that inspiration is a difficult
quality to define — much less practice
— yet it is crucial to a leader's effective
ness. Inspiration stems from a passion
ate caring for your mission, so much so
that others want to help. Love of what
you do, linked to a shared vision, can
imbue even mundane grunt work with
importance.
The ends justify the means. Leaders
are sometimes judged by what they
actually achieve, as if accomplishment
dictates success. In this framework
leaders have clear visions of certain end

products they want to produce. And it is
true that successfully meeting the goals
of the organization does signify a type
of success.
But this success may be short-lived if
group members are dissatisfied with
the process of getting to the "end." Poor
morale, high turnover and even sabo
tage can be negative by-products of a
leader who is too focused on the end
result and ignores the quality of the
journey.
If not a leader, then a follower. Tra
ditional notions of leadership assume
that those at the top are responsible for
the organization; other people with the
group are expected to follow the course
charted from above.
Yet how many people see themselves
as followers? Followership provides lit
tle opportunity for autonomy, creativity
and impact.
Groups that actively engage their
members in defining and holding com
monly shared visions don't treat their
members as followers but as important
group participants. When leadership is
shared, all a group's members share a
vision for their organization and can
readily act in its support.
