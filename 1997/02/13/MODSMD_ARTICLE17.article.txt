ROTC breeds community leaders, not homophobes

THE RESERVE OFFICERS' Train
ing Corps is about camaraderie,
dedication, personal excellence and
facing challenges. We are fueled by a
desire to be well-rounded college students
but also committed to our decision to be
commissioned officers upon graduating
from Stanford. As a midshipman, I do not
subscribe to discrimination, homorl.obia
or amoral warfare.
Recently, Daily articles about ROTC
have been written from an outsider's per
spective. All too often the human aspect
of the program has been overshadowed
by policy disputes and preconceived
notions about the military and the people
involved in it. I would like to clue readers

in as to what ROTC is really about.
ROTC prepares young people to be
responsible leaders in tomorrow's mili
tary and, ultimately, in society. I repre
sent the future of this nation's defense
— which is as critical in peacetime as it
is during times of war.
Students on an ROTC scholarship
receive tuition, books and a $150 stipend
in exchange for a commitment to serve
four years of active duty and four years
in the reserves. I also commit one month
per summer to active duty training.
At first glance, one's motives to par
ticipate in ROTC may be regarded as
purely financial. However, many Stan
ford ROTC students are not drawn to

ROTC for its cash value. They are
drawn to an organization and extracur
ricular activity that promotes leadership
training, community service, physical
fitness and equal opportunities.
ROTC is not a breeding ground for
homophobes nor is the Department of
Defense some powerful think tank that
strategically attempts to oppress people
that are different. It must operate with
in the parameters of society in the inter
est of achieving its mission of defending
the United States.
In my opinion the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy is progressive. And it is
important to have military officers with
Stanford educations to present progres

sive, open-minded ideas in both military
and civilian decision-making.
Whether official or not, there is a
ROTC presence on campus. There are
freshmen running in the foothills, drill
teams and color guards practicing and
students wearing uniforms to class once
a week. I appreciate how many of my
dormmates and peers have continually
expressed interest in and supported my
ROTC endeavors. It's time for the Uni
versity to step up and acknowledge what
our uniforms represent just as it values
the funds it receives from the Defense
Department.
