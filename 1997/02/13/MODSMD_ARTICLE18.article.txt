# Students had success in sending investment message to trustees
## 
### 
Unfortunately, I wasn't completely sur
prised by Tuesday's Daily editorial since
the paper seems to have formed the habit
of attacking individuals from its anony
mous editorial box. Recent victims include
Nawwar Kasrawi, Bill Shen, Nick Thomp
son and Brian Babcock, all of whom have
offered constructive alternatives to the sta
tus quo of our institution while The Daily

has rewarded their efforts with unwar
ranted personal assaults.
However, not only was the format inap
propriate, the content concerning the
Socially Responsible Endowment Fund
was inaccurate. When the Board of
Trustees prematurely rejected the propos
al for such a fund after two years of relat
ed discussion, students recognized that all
avenues toward progress within the insti
tution had been finally blocked. Respond
ing accordingly, they took the issue out of
the system and into White Plaza.
The socially responsible endowment
fund, in connection with the ASSU's
"University for Students" campaign, has
been far more successful than the edito

rial indicates. In the short span of six
days, 1,000 future alumni signed peti
tions in a strong demonstration of
widespread student support. The cam
paign delivered a message through the
voice of students that the trustees will
certainly have in mind when they recon
sider a modified version of the original
proposal. In addition, the chair of the
Advisory Panel on Investment Responsi
bility is going to serve on the Special
Committee on Investment Responsibili
ty. This is a significant achievement —
from what I understand, the APIR
couldn't even get the SCIR on a confer
ence call last year.
With a leap of good faith that admin

istrators will act forthrightiy, students
met them halfway and stopped the cam
paign before positions hardened and the
opportunity for effective negotiation
passed. The most important point The
Daily missed, however, is that student
activists and organizers do have an obli
gation to act responsibly. This does not
include strategies that call for students
to hold out and holler until they have
accomplished nothing but making them
selves hoarse. I believe we should all
expect more from ourselves — students,
administrators and editorial board
members alike.
