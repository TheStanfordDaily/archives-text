# Gov't aid changes' effect on Stanford will be small
## Financial Aids Office says students will pay same

Both President Clinton and Califor
nia Gov. Pete Wilson have emphasized
education as a primary issue in their
budgets for 1998 and have proposed dra
matic increases in financial aid to college
students. However, students at Stanford
may only feel the effects of these increas
es indirectly or not at all.
Among Clinton's proposals are a
$10,000 tax deduction or a $1,500 tax
credit for parents paying for college, a 20-
percent increase in need-based Pell
Grants and a cut from 4 percent to 2 per
cent in the fees borrowers pay for their
federal student loans.

Wilson's "Continued Commitment to
Higher Education" proposes increasing
the Cal Grant A and B programs, state
supported need-based aid, by $15.8 mil

would go toward increasing the maxi

$9,105.
Increases in Pell Grants and Cal
Grants, which are fundamental in pro
viding financial aid money for low-in
come students, will have no direct affect
on individual students at Stanford, ad
ministrators say.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya said
individual students will not see any extra
money from increases to the govern-

ment grant programs
because Stanford's poli

tributions based solely
on an estimate of how
much a family can pay.
Therefore, Montoya
said, the total amount of
financial aid a student I
receives at Stanford is
fixed, and the changes

will only result in a change in the pro
portions the University and the govern
ment each pay.
"Since our policy is to fully meet the
demonstrated need of enrolled under-
