# Gov't aid changes' effect on Stanford will be small
## Financial Aids Office says students will pay same 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Both President Clinton and Califor
nia Gov. Pete Wilson have emphasized
education as a primary issue in their
budgets for 1998 and have proposed dra
matic increases in financial aid to college
students. However, students at Stanford
may only feel the effects of these increas
es indirectly or not at all.
Among Clinton's proposals are a
$10,000 tax deduction or a $1,500 tax
credit for parents paying for college, a 20-
percent increase in need-based Pell
Grants and a cut from 4 percent to 2 per
cent in the fees borrowers pay for their
federal student loans.

Wilson's "Continued Commitment to
Higher Education" proposes increasing
the Cal Grant A and B programs, state
supported need-based aid, by $15.8 mil
lion. About $10 million of this money
would go toward increasing the maxi
mum possible award from $7,164 to
$9,105.
Increases in Pell Grants and Cal
Grants, which are fundamental in pro
viding financial aid money for low-in
come students, will have no direct affect
on individual students at Stanford, ad
ministrators say.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya said
individual students will not see any extra
money from increases to the govern-

ment grant programs
because Stanford's poli
cy is to fix student con
tributions based solely
on an estimate of how
much a family can pay.
Therefore, Montoya
said, the total amount of
financial aid a student I
receives at Stanford is
fixed, and the changes

will only result in a change in the pro
portions the University and the govern
ment each pay.
"Since our policy is to fully meet the
demonstrated need of enrolled under-


Montoya
graduates at Stanford, Stanford
students will not be noticeably im
pacted. Students enrolling at col
leges or universities that do not
meet full need will benefit most,"
Montoya said.
"Students will see no dollar dif
ference," Director of Student
Awards Cynthia Rife said.
However, the increase in grants
means Stanford will not have to
spend as much of its scholarship
money to fill the gap left between
grants and student need, Rife said.
Rife explained that financial
aid packages at Stanford have
three components â€” federal and
state grants, loans and work study
money earned by students, and
money that Stanford contributes.
"If more money [from state and
federal government] is available,
we may be able to reduce the loan
and job portion of the financial aid
package," Rife said.
According to Rife, the increase
in funding may also allow Stan
ford to give scholarships to more
students.
Critics of Clinton's program as
sert that it will have the greatest
benefits for middle-class students,
who would attend college anyway,
rather than lower-income fami
lies. The $43 million that will be
lost from tax revenues as a result
of these tax breaks could be used
to increase grant money, critics
add.

According to Montoya, lower
income families have historically
been neglected by federal policy.
"Broadening choice for the
middle class has moved us away
from creating opportunities for
prospective college students com
ing from low-income families,"
Montoya said.
Rife said the tax aspect of Clin
ton's program will primarily help
middle-class students at Stanford,
and that Clinton was compelled to
make the tax breaks the center
piece of his program for political
reasons.
"The Republicans want a tax
break for the middle class. Clinton
is trying to get support for educa
tion in a way that he knows can be
approved," Rife said.
"Upper to middle-class families
often need financial help to pay ed
ucational costs," Rife said. She
added that the tax deduction and
credits will benefit some upper
middle class families who "feel
that they are being missed" in the
current financial aid process.
Rife said all students on finan
cial aid will benefit from the cut in
the fee and interest rates for stu
dent loans. According to Rife, vir
tually all students on financial aid
have to take out loans. The fees for
originating these loans are usually
not more than a few hundred dol
lars, Rife added.
Rife and Montoya agreed that
the increase in federal and state
grants may encourage low-income
students, who might be intimidat
ed by the cost of private universi
ties, to apply to Stanford.

"Students don't always know
our policy of meeting all need,"
Montoya said. "A lot of private
schools do not do this.
"I do believe that the media
hype regarding an increase I in Cal
grants] will serve private colleges
and universities," he said.
Of the Class of 2001,43 percent
receive financial aid. Twenty-one
percent of these students are from
families with an annual income of
less than $30,000.
According to Dan Edwards, a
spokesman for Wilson, the Cal
Grant increase will encourage stu
dents to choose private universi
ties. This, in turn, will alleviate
overcrowding in public universi
ties in the future.
"Private universities are histor
ically not utilized as much as pub
lic universities. The $ 10 million for
private universities will alleviate
pressure on public universities
down the road," Edwards said.
Edwards added that underuti
lization is not a problem for Stan
ford, as admissions to the Universi
ty are highly competitive, and stu
dents are turned away each year.
According to Rife, Clinton's
program is not perfect. The tax de
ductions and credits in Clinton's
budget will complicate the finan
cial aid process and possibly raise
administration expenses, she said.
"The ideal would be to increase
Pell Grants and programs that we
already have," Rife said. "It is im
portant to not complicate the fi
nancial aid process any more than
it is already." This extra complexi
ty, she said, makes administering

financial aid more expensive and
drains on University resources.
For example, to receive the
$1,500 tax credit, students may be
required to maintain a B average
in college. According to Rife, en
forcing this stipulation would be
"an incredible administrative bur
den." The process would be com
plicated even further by the fact
that Stanford does not give grade
point averages, Rife added.
Rife explained that under this
program, students could lose their
scholarships and not be able to
complete their education if their
grade point averages dip below 3.5
for just one quarter.
"This would be almost criminal
at a place like Stanford," Rife said.
Rife defended Clinton's tax pro
posals from a popular criticism
that universities may raise their
tuition because the raise might be
covered by federal money.
"That is a big myth that is out
there," Rife said. "That would not
happen at Stanford.
"Higher education is very grate
ful and excited by these propos
als," she said. "We haven't seen a
president so overtly supportive of
education in a long time."
Although this legislation could
go into effect by next September, it
is more likely that next year's
freshman class will not see any re
sults from these proposals.
According to Edwards, the pro
posal is pending but details are
"still being worked out."
"It will be a long process for the
legislation to go through," Rife
said.
