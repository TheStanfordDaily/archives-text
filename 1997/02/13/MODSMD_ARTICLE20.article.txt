# Rachel Kolman Marshak: I'm a jelly doughnut
## My life as a CIV student: reforming the unreformable 
### 
THE LOWEST POINT of my tortur
ous CIV experience came In winter
quarter during a review session for
the final. I had dragged myself away from
studying, hoping to pick up a few hints
about the exam. The room was moderately
full, and two of the section leaders were
there to answer questions.
The first query was about some aspect
of Descartes' philosophy.
"Oh, I can't answer that question. That
may be covered on the final," the teaching
assistant said. "We can only answer ques
tions that concern material that definitely
will not be on the final."
I was shocked. Who had ever heard of a
review session that didn't cover material
for the final exam. But this was the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values Program, and I
should have known better.
Recently, the talk of reforms have
raised the hope that CIV will indeed
improve and become a class about great
ideas instead of just great books (or in
some cases, not so great books).
Unfortunately, although it's almost
impossible to believe, CIV is going to get
worse.
The proposed reforms not only fail to
address the fundamental problems of CIV,
but they exacerbate the structural defects
of the program. I cannot speak specifically
for all CIV programs because I only was in

one — the philosophy track. But it is hard
to believe that philosophy CIV is much dif
ferent from the rest of the tracks. In fact,
in The Daily's recent poll, it was one of the
higher-rated programs, so some must be
even more terrible.
So why did I hate CIV? First, to be
blunt, the teaching sucked. Fall quarter, I
had a professor who had 10 minutes of
material for a 50-minute lecture. The rest
of the time he repeated himself. But he
was popular because sometimes he told
good jokes. Nothing too interesting was
said winter quarter either.
Spring quarter? Well, I don't remem
ber much about it; by then I had stopped
going to lecture (along with about two
thirds of the other students), deeming it a
waste of my time.
There were also problems with the mate
rial. Basically, we were reading the great
works of philosophy in chronological order
with a few random women and non-Western
writers thrown in. There were no common
themes, no method of progression (other
than time) and, in some cases, no rationale
for why the work had been chosen.
Additionally, the formal structure of
the class was flawed. We had 100 minutes
of lecture to 180 minutes of discussion.
There just wasn't that much to talk about
in section. Maybe because there were no
themes, no theories or frameworks to view

the works in.
And the worst thing was I couldn't get
out of it. Normally, if the professor sucks
or the reading is bad, I don't take the class.
But with CIV, there is no choice. Even
changing TAs is hard.
It's not necessary for an introductory
class to be so awful. Fall quarter of that
year, I also took Political Science 35, an
introduction to international relations the
ory. The lectures were packed with materi
al. The professor typed up the charts he
projected on the overhead so they were
easily readable. We read more texts than in
CIV but because the class was arranged
around common themes, I didn't feel like I
rushed through any of them. Section was
lively because it only met once a week.
But the proposed CIV reforms don't fix
any of these problems and, in some case,
make them worse.
Take the new first quarter class, "Intro
duction to the Humanities." In no way is
the problem of teaching quality addressed.
It is unlikely that the new class will make
the average level of teaching skill rise. The
TAs, instead of being graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows, will now be
quasi-assistant professors. They are quasi
in the sense that Stanford does not feel
they are good enough to get tenure.
The plan also suggests that only three
to five works will be examined all quarter.

That's a recipe for boredom. In high
school AP English, I discussed books to
death. After three weeks of examining
"The Metamorphosis" from every logical
aspect, I was ready to burn a book I had
once enjoyed.
The problem is not that too many works
are read, but rather that the lack of com
mon themes makes it difficult to process
and integrate material. Structure the cur
riculum right and there will be no problem.
In terms of formal structure, class size
will be 500, up from the 250 or so in my
CIV track. This is not an improvement. A
preponderance of data shows that the
smaller the class size, the higher the stu
dent satisfaction. Sections are reduced by 4
or 5 people. But what students really want
is more interaction with tenured profes
sors, not marginally smaller sections.
As for the suggestion that there should
be more discussion time and less lecture
time, maybe the CIV committee should go
to a philosophy CIV section. After they
hear the silence, they will understand the
error of this provision.
Worse, some problems with CIV are
not addressed at all. There is no change in
the informal structure of CIV. Most
importantly, no greater choice is allowed
participants in selecting tracks or profes
sors. Students still have to choose sight
unseen. Thus, it seems to me, the pro

posed reforms, at best, are a slight down
grade over the status quo and, at worst, a
disaster.
As for the second and third quarters,
there seems to be no change. In fact, the
classes might even become worse because
there will be less time to cover the mate
rial. No professor likes to cut the scope of
his class; he just fits more readings into
less time. An a result, I assume that the
readings will be even more random and
disconnected.
Is CIV worthless? Besides being a meal
ticket for marginal humanities depart
ments, CIV gives us the chance to read
great books. These books have influenced
how our world has developed and can be
quite stimulating. It is not the works
themselves that are bad but the organiza
tion of CIV that is flawed.
But unless CIV is completely re-engi
neered to address these specific defects, I
think it should be abolished. CIV made me
hate academics, and that is the worst thing
a class can do.
