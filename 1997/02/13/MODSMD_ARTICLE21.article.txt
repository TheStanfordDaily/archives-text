## Revenge? Men play Beavers 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Mike Montgomery will tell you
he doesn't pay attention to rank
ings. It's probably better for the
Cardinal men's basketball head
coach that he doesn't. Maybe then
he won't be asked to explain why
Stanford, at No. 22, is still ranked
ahead of both UCLA and USC in
the Associated Press and USA
Today / CNN polls released earlier
this week.
For anyone with a short memo
ry, those are the two teams that
handed the Cardinal a pair of
resounding defeats last weekend in
Los Angeles, sending Stanford
home with a three-game losing
streak and its tail between its legs.
They're also the two teams tied for
first place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence — a full two games ahead of
the fifth-place Cardinal.
Stanford (13-6 overall, 6-5 Pac
-10) certainly isn't playing much
like a ranked team. The Cardinal
has shot less than 33 percent the
past three games and is still strug
gling to find consistency heading
into tonight's 7:30 game vs. Ore
gon State (6-14, 2-9) at Maples
Pavilion.
The team is "just a little out of
synch right now," Montgomery
said. "Everything's just a little bit
harder than it needs to be. But
again, it's not [so] broken that [it]
can't be fixed."
And after all, rankings don't
matter much, as Montgomery will
also tell you. What does matter is
whether your team makes the 64-
team field for the NCAA Tourna
ment. And at this rate, those
prospects are anything but bright.
In most years, 11 conference
wins would put a team in good
shape. But this year that might not
be a smart bet, with five Pac-10
teams — USC, UCLA, Arizona,
California and Stanford — playing
top-25-caliber basketball. Those
teams are probably jockeying for
four slots, the number of tourna
ment berths historically awarded
to the Pac-10. And Stanford, with
no quality non-conference wins to
speak of, is already at a disadvan
tage.
That means the Cardinal will
probably have to win six of its
seven remaining conference games
in order to qualify, including a pair
of road games at the Washington
schools and a match with No. 11
Arizona.
Of course, the last thing Stan
ford needs now is to get caught
looking ahead. Tonight the focus
must be on Oregon State — the
same team that caught the Cardi
nal napping in an 86-77 win at
Corvallis on Jan. 18.
"I can't imagine the guys not
being a little bit angry with Oregon
State," Montgomery said, with the
Beavers "having beat us up there
and how badly we felt and what
that cost us at that point in the
season. We should be prepared to
come out and play hard."
Montgomery tried to inject
some life into the Cardinal offense
against UCLA by inserting sopho
more guard Art Lee in the starting
lineup in place of senior Rich Jack
son. Whether any further lineup
changes are in store tonight
remains to be seen.
"I think Rich became a victim of
some of the other people not being
able to do their jobs," Montgomery
said. "If the ball's going inside to
[center Tim Young] and Tim's not
scoring and [shooting guard Kris
Weems] is not getting clean looks,
you don't feel like Rich is going to
jump up and shoot it in every time
— that's never been his job. So now
you have three or four places on the
floor that are not scoring. Well,
that's not going to work."
Lee, who put up a career-high 26
points in a sparkling performance
at USC last Thursday, has helped
pick up the offensive slack, averag
ing 17 points over the last three
games. But the extra offense hasn't
proven to be a panacea. The Cardi

nal continues to make careless
turnovers, part of the growing
pains that come with a team using
eight underclassman in an 11-man
rotation.
"I told [the team on Monday]
that there's no way that Brevin
turns the ball over nine times,
almost regardless of the circum
stances," Montgomery said, allud
ing to point guard Brevin Knight's
career-high nine turnovers against
UCLA. "He's too good. Yet he's
being forced to try to make plays
that maybe he's not comfortable
with, and he's being forced to make
plays too often."
If there's one factor working in

favor of the Cardinal, it's the fact
that five of its remaining seven
Pac-10 games are at home, where
Stanford has won six straight and
21 of its last 22. Even so, home
court advantage won't do much for
a team not playing good basketball.
"Corey Benjamin jumped up
and shot some very difficult shots
against us," Montgomery said of
the Oregon State freshman who
poured in 26 points during the
teams' first meeting. "Now we're
going to have to do something
about that — there's nothing that
says he's not going to do that again
just because he's playing here vs.
there. There are no guarantees."
