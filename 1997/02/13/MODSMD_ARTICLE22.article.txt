# Stanford women's tennis shuts out Pacific
## 
### Lindsay Amstutz Contributing writer 
Confident and relaxed, the No. 2 Stanford
women's tennis team (6-0) destroyed Pacific
9-0 yesterday at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
The match against the overwhelmed
Tigers provided a good warmup for the Car
dinal; the players were clearly already look
ing ahead to tomorrow's match against
UNLV. Still, there are benefits to any compe
tition.
"Any time you get the team out there
against an opponent, it's good," said head
coach Frank Brennan.
Coming off individual tournaments,
today's game against UOP reunited the Car
dinal and kicked off the team-focused portion
of the season.
Senior Sandra De Silva led the Cardinal in
the No. 1 spot with a convincing win over
UOP's Bente Grina 6-1, 6-0. De Silva stepped
in for freshman Anne Kremer, who was orig
inally slated to play No. 1. Kremer was still

getting over a slight stomach pull and used
the break to rest up for tomorrow's highly
anticipated match against UNLV.
Junior Ania Bleszynski had a convincing
win over UOP's Mari Maattanen 6-1, 6-0.
The relentless dominance of the Cardinal
continued as junior Julie Scott and freshman
Teryn Ashley each won 6-0, 6-0. Freshman
Jen Heiser won 7-5, 6-1, and junior Heidi
Stalla checked in with a 6-1, 6-0 win.
Brennan had predicted a 9-0 win the day
before but was still a little taken aback by his
team's performance.
"Today was pretty overwhelming all the
way through," Brennan said. "Everyone gets
an A for the day."
Bleszynski and Scott continued their win
ning ways in the No. 1 doubles match. After
winning the Rolex National Intercollegiate
Indoor Championships this past weekend,
yesterday's game presented little challenge
as they smashed UOP's Grina and Maatanen
8-3.

Junior Ail-American Ania Bleszynski lunges for the ball in last week's match vs.
Fresno State. Bleszynski won in two straight sets, 6-1, 6-0, against Pacific's Mari
Maattanen yesterday.
"Coming back from the tourna
ment, it was kind of a letdown. But
we played well enough to win,"
Scott said.
Heiser and senior Emily Burt
teamed up for a 8-4 win in the No.
2 doubles position. Stalla and Ash

ley formed the third pair and won
8-3. After her matches had fin
ished, Scott joined the crowd and
admired her teammates.
"Everyone is playing well and
getting the job done," Scott said.
A big match against UNLV
awaits the Cardinal tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. at Stanford. The Las
Vegas team features Marianne
Vallin, currently ranked No. 4 in
the country. This won't be the first

time Stanford has encountered
Vallin; De Silva played against her
last weekend in the Rolex tourna
ment, winning 6-3, 6-4. De Silva
will most likely see a rematch
tomorrow.
On Saturday, Stanford takes on
Oregon. Not expected to pose
much of a threat, the Beavers like
ly will be torn apart by the Cardi
nal. But the match against UNLV
promises to be more difficult.
