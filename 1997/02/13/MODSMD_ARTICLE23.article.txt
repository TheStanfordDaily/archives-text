# Nygaard comes back in style

### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
On the Stanford women's basketball trip to Hawaii
during Thanksgiving, Vanessa Nygaard found herself in
a predicament.
One of her two older brothers was getting married,
and the junior forward needed a dress. So she turned to
teammates Jamila Wideman and Chandra Benton, and
the trio embarked on a shopping mission with hilarious
results.
But hilarity is nothing new where Nygaard is con
cerned. Whether she's singing into a salami she won at a
Laser game or giving an interview that runs more like a
comedy hour than 60 minutes, Nygaard is nothing if not
entertaining.
Turn the conversation to basketball and her team's
lofty hopes and aspirations for the 1996-97 season, how
ever, and Nygaard is all business.
In fact, Nygaard feels her entire team is getting
down to business as the season nears its close and the
Cardinal continues its quest for the national title. For
her part Nygaard, who was called "Kareem" by junior
high teammates because of the goggles she wore, is con
tributing a third-best 12.3 points per game and a team
leading (tied with junior center Olympia Scott) 7.5
rebounds per contest in addition to coming back from
arthroscopic knee surgery performed Jan. 14. In her
three games back from the injury (Nygaard was side
lined for just five games) she has scored a combined 36
points and pulled 24 total boards.
Unfortunately, the knee problem was not
Nygaard's first bout with injury. She entered Stanford
in fall 1993 as a promising pail of the recruiting class
that includes this season's four seniors.
The 6-foot-1 forward from Carlsbad, Calif., was a
high school All-American who set school records at
Carlsbad High in career scoring and rebounding. She
also was considered by many to be a potential starter as
a true freshman, but her first season was brought to a
halt before it ever got started when she tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in her right knee in an exhibition game
and sat out the season with a medical redshirt.
"It was devastating, absolutely devastating,"
Nygaard said of the season-ending injury. "In the long
run I think it's one of the things that's helped me the
most because it gives me so much perspective on what I
do. I think the way I play, I put myself out there to get
injured a lot of times. But I'm getting injured playing
basketball so what can I say? That's what I love to do,
