# Nygaard comes back in style
## 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
On the Stanford women's basketball trip to Hawaii
during Thanksgiving, Vanessa Nygaard found herself in
a predicament.
One of her two older brothers was getting married,
and the junior forward needed a dress. So she turned to
teammates Jamila Wideman and Chandra Benton, and
the trio embarked on a shopping mission with hilarious
results.
But hilarity is nothing new where Nygaard is con
cerned. Whether she's singing into a salami she won at a
Laser game or giving an interview that runs more like a
comedy hour than 60 minutes, Nygaard is nothing if not
entertaining.
Turn the conversation to basketball and her team's
lofty hopes and aspirations for the 1996-97 season, how
ever, and Nygaard is all business.
In fact, Nygaard feels her entire team is getting
down to business as the season nears its close and the
Cardinal continues its quest for the national title. For
her part Nygaard, who was called "Kareem" by junior
high teammates because of the goggles she wore, is con
tributing a third-best 12.3 points per game and a team
leading (tied with junior center Olympia Scott) 7.5
rebounds per contest in addition to coming back from
arthroscopic knee surgery performed Jan. 14. In her
three games back from the injury (Nygaard was side
lined for just five games) she has scored a combined 36
points and pulled 24 total boards.
Unfortunately, the knee problem was not
Nygaard's first bout with injury. She entered Stanford
in fall 1993 as a promising pail of the recruiting class
that includes this season's four seniors.
The 6-foot-1 forward from Carlsbad, Calif., was a
high school All-American who set school records at
Carlsbad High in career scoring and rebounding. She
also was considered by many to be a potential starter as
a true freshman, but her first season was brought to a
halt before it ever got started when she tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in her right knee in an exhibition game
and sat out the season with a medical redshirt.
"It was devastating, absolutely devastating,"
Nygaard said of the season-ending injury. "In the long
run I think it's one of the things that's helped me the
most because it gives me so much perspective on what I
do. I think the way I play, I put myself out there to get
injured a lot of times. But I'm getting injured playing
basketball so what can I say? That's what I love to do,

and if that's how I'm going to get
injured, I don't really care."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
might not approve of that senti
ment, but she does agree with
Nygaard when it comes to the
effects of the injury.
Any injury is hard, VanDerveer
said. "With Vanessa, I think she
didn't see what she could be in the
beginning. She's more mature
[now]; she can fight through
things."
After playing a reserve role as a
redshirt freshman in the 1994-95
season, Nygaard finally came into
her own as a sophomore. Under
the guidance of interim head
coaches Amy Tucker and Mari
anne Stanley, Nygaard entered the
starting lineup and had a record
breaking year from behind the arc.
After connecting only nine
three-pointers in 254 minutes of
play as a redshirt freshman,
Nygaard almost quadrupled her
playing time and buried 75 treys in
193 attempts last year, eclipsing
Molly Goodenbour's 3-year-old
Stanford standards.
"There are so many great mem
ories," Nygaard said of her career
so far at Stanford. "Even last year
with Amy and Marianne — just
being successful with that team
and how we really had to pull
together. Amy Tucker has always
been very helpful to me."
Nygaard has established herself
as one of the emotional leaders of
the team, offering an endless sup

ply of energy and enthusiasm that
has become trademark Nygaard.
But it also became reason for con
troversy early this year when the
press pegged VanDerveer's return
as the end of Nygaard's fun.
"I've always been like that,
where when I'm playing people
just think I'm crazy, but I'm just
out there trying my hardest,"
Nygaard said. "People sometimes
think I'm being outrageous or
whatever, but that's actually gen
uine. Sometimes people say, 'You
really play with your heart on your
sleeve,' and I take that as a great
compliment."
VanDerveer's "stickler for the
rules" mentality was not intended
to hide Nygaard's enthusiastic
intensity, but it was supposed to
bring an end to or at least tone
down Nygaard's on-court celebra
tions. And now it would seem the
two have found a happy medium
between dancing with the dollies
and playing it straight.
"I want people to focus on
Vanessa's play," VanDerveer said.
"She's too good of a player; she's
not a cheerleader. I love her enthu
siastic play. I think there are cer
tain times when we need enthusi
asm, but what I would call exces
sive celebration is demeaning to
opponents."
Nygaard has definitely done her
part to be noticed for her play, as
well as to energize her teammates,
and so far the results have been
near-perfect. Stanford currently is
ranked third in the nation with a
23-1 record (11-0, Pacific 10 Con
ference), and many believe this is
the year for the Card. And what a
year it would be for Nygaard — her

last with classmates Tara Harring
ton, Charmin Smith, Kate Star
bird and Jamila Wideman.
"It feels like I'm graduating; it's
really weird," Nygaard said. "It's
really scary to think this is the last
time we're playing [each team],
and we're kind of about making
that last great impression."
Nygaard has never had trouble
making lasting impressions. She
tells the story of the Hawaiian
shopping spree like this:
An unsuccessful look through
the dresses at Macy's led the group
to the "teeny-bopper," section
where they discovered a wide array
of unusual dresses including every
thing from outfits that looked like
couches to, well, just about any
thing. As a joke, Wideman and
Benton convinced Nygaard to try
on a few, and they soon discovered
a leopard-skin dress among the
bunch that wasn't half bad.
"We weren't going to get any of
them," Nygaard said. "But then
there was this leopard-skin one,
and I was like, 'Yeah, this'll shock
them.' I'm trying to shock my par
ents. What was I thinking, right?
"So I bought it. I didn't have
any shoes, but it was on the beach
so I figured I could just walk in
there. So I show up, and my mom's
shocked, but then she's wearing
the same print — to my brother's
wedding. I was like, 'Oh God, my
family's crazy.' "
Crazy or not, the Cardinal will
likely take all the intensity and
energy it can get from Nygaard.
And if the team does make it all the
way to that national title, everyone
knows who'll be dressed for the
occasion.
