# Women hope to win despite injuries
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Tonight the Stanford women's bas
ketball team is looking to avoid becom
ing "Catastrophe in Corvallis III."
The third-ranked Cardinal (23-1, 11-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) head to Oregon
State for a conference showdown with
the Beavers (10-10, 4-7). Having seen

football and men's basketball falter this
year at Oregon State, Stanford hopes to
put an end to such hijinks and get one
step closer to putting away its eighth
Pac-10 title.
The two squads already squared off
last month, with Stanford jumping out
to a 27-point lead before seeing Oregon
State go on a 26-7 run to close the gap.
The Cardinal finally managed to pull

away for a 72-54 win at the Maples Pavil
ion game. Senior forward Kate Starbird
led the team with 28 points as junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard and senior point
guard Jamila Wideman sat out the game
with injuries.
Stanford head coach Tar a VanDerveer
said tonight's match should be helped by
the return of a few key players. "We
didn't have Vanessa or Jamila [in
the first game], so I hope it does
make a big difference," she said.
With seven games remaining in
the regular season, the Cardinal is
putting together some of its best
basketball of the season. The
women have put away their last
three opponents by an average of
38.3 points, including a 34-point
destruction of second-place USC.
Some of this can be attributed to
Nygaard's return. She has aver
aged 12 points and eight rebounds
in those three games, including 11
last Saturday against UCIA.
Wideman has taken a more
offensive role, scoring 24 and 16
points in the last two games, while
continuing to rack up solid assist
numbers. Unfortunately, injuries
remain a persistent problem.
Junior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele continues to recover
from her injury, and junior for
ward Heather Owen broke her fin
ger during Tuesday's practice.
Both will not make the road trip.
"This is going to be a real chal

lenge for our team — again," Van-
Derveer said. "It just seems like
the day before we go on the road,
we always have something.... It's
the weirdest thing, and I don't
know if I have an answer for it."
The latest iryury comes at a
time when some pressure has
come off Starbird as she gets closer
to becoming the school's all-time
leading scorer. Throughout most
of the conference season, Van-
Derveer has been vocal about
Stanford's over-reliance on Star
bird — she led the team in scoring
in every single conference game
until last week, when Nygaard and
Wideman broke through with big
games. Some predict Starbird will
harbor the load again, but on the
road trip to Washington where
three starters sat out, people like
Owen, sophomore center Chandra
Benton and freshman guard Mile
na Flores stepped up with clutch
performances.
"This is where our depth is
going to be really key," VanDerveer
said. "It's going to be really impor
tant we have different people step
up, which we did when we went to
Washington, and now we'll have to
do again when we go to Oregon."
Oregon State has been on the
other end of the spectrum, to say

the least. A year removed from 19-
9 record and a tournament appear
ance, the Beavers have fallen to 4-
7 in the Pac-10. Last weekend,
OSU dealt Washington State a 67-
60 defeat while falling to Washing
ton 72-68 in Seattle.
Having lost all-time leading
scorer and rebounder Tanja Kostic
and three other starters, the
Beavers have had to field a team
with little substance beyond senior
center Tina Lelas. is averag
ing 16.1 points and more than 10
rebounds per game. Junior for
ward Kris Walsh complements
Lelas, averaging 11.6 points and
six rebounds a game.
"We've played them before and
I thought they played really well,"
VanDerveer said. "I think they'll
definitely be excited to play us."
With all the injuries the Cardi
nal have had to endure, it brings
memories of her Olympic team.
"We had this kind of situation
last year with the Olympic team
where every time we went to do
something, somebody would get a
concussion," VanDerveer said.
"We had two people get a concus
sion before we went to China, and
someone sprained her ankle. So
it's really similar to this year, but
last year turned out OK."
