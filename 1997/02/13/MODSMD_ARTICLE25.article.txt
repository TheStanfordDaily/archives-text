## 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
In its final home match of the season
and last dual meet before the Pac-10
championships in early March, Stanford
meets two wrestling powers tomorrow
night at Burnham Pavilion. The Cardi
nal (4-7) meets the Division 11, eighth

ranked Mankato State Mavericks (13-5)
at 5:30 p.m. and the Brigham Young
Cougars (8-6-1) immediately after.
The Mavericks are led by their three
nationally ranked wrestlers: 126-pound
junior Mark Schutze (24-8), ranked
eighth; 167-pound senior Steve
Friedrichs (25-6), also ranked eighth;
and 190-pound sophomore Ross Johnson

(22-7), ranked third.
Mankato State's 118-pound junior
Jason Zitzman (23-8) and 142-pound
sophomore Troy Szydel (16-4) are tough
competitors and should challenge Stan
ford freshman Rudy Ruiz at 118 pounds
and sophomore Warren McPherson at
142 pounds.
"Mankato State has a very similar

team to ours," said Stanford coach Chris
Horpel. "We're are definitely capable of
beating them, but it'll depend on how we
match up with them because they are
strong where we are strong."
The premiere match-up of the night
will most likely be at 167-pounds where
Stanford junior Scott Chapman
(30-6), ranked ninth nationally,
meets the Maverick's Friedrichs.
Although Mankato State and
BYU are not in the Pac-10, both
teams will give the Cardinal a
chance to measure its progress
thus far this season. Some of the
wrestlers also may meet again at
the NCAA championships.
"We'd like to see things come
together this weekend," McPher
son said. "We're still just seeing

glimpses of what we're capable of.
We know we can put together a
consistently solid performance at
every weight and we'd like to do
that this weekend."
BYU is coached by Mark
Schultz, an early Horpel product.
Horpel coached Schultz at Palo
Alto High School and later joined
Horpel as an assistant coach. Dur
ing his time at Stanford, Schultz
won an Olympic gold medal and
two world championships.
The Cougars are led by 126-
pound junior John Kelly (9-4) and
158-pound sophomore Rangi
Smart (22-4).
"If we wrestle well, we can beat

both BYU and Mankato State,"
Chapman said.
Although injuries still plague
the Card, only three starters are
currently missing from the lineup.
Senior Brian Vaniman recently
had his cast removed, junior
Robert Hatta is doubtful for this
weekend, and junior Jason Glad
den is most likely out for the sea
son.
Wrestling in place of Hatta will
be sophomore Frank Ruiz, sopho
more Shane Cross will take Glad
den's place and freshman Tim
Kendall will wrestle at 190 pounds
for Vaniman, although Kendall
must weigh in at 177 pounds.
