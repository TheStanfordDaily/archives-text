# Cardinal tennis competes at home
## Men lose at Sybase tourney 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
hopes to keep raking in the victories when it
takes on San Diego State and Washington
tomorrow and Saturday at home.
The Cardinal has once again proven to be the
type of team that wins consistently. After four
dual matches this season, the Cardinal has
drubbed its competitors.
So far this season, in dual match play
against Hawaii, No. 22 New Mexico and No. 13
Fresno State, the Cardinal has not dropped a
single set. All six starters for the Cardinal are
ranked in the top 30 in the region, which
includes other national tennis dynasties like
No. 2 UCLA, No. 6 Pepperdine, No. 17 Arizona
and No. 21 USC.
This weekend could prove to be another cake
walk for the young and talented Cardinal.
"We have been playing well so far," said
assistant coach John Whitlinger. "But we'd bet
ter be ready. We do need to get past San Diego
State before we can start thinking about our
[Pacific 10 Conference] rival Washington."
Washington is ranked 41st in the nation
right now, but according to Whitlinger, it has
several talented players. Leading the way for
the Huskies is Nick Williams, who beat the Car
dinal's Ail-American sophomore Ryan Wolters
in the Rolex Regionals this fall.
"Matt Anger, head coach at Washington, is
putting a good program together up there,"
Whitlinger said. "This should be a good match,
but it will also help us get ready for Louisville
next week."
The Cardinal travels to Louisville a week
from today for the National Team Indoors,
where it will take on No. 18 Kentucky. Stanford
is seeded first, ahead of UCLA and Georgia.
"It will be a really important tournament for
us because it can establish us early in the season
as a top team." Whitlinger said.
Earlier this week, three members of the Stan
ford men's tennis team competed in the Sybase
Open professional tournament, leaving with few
fond memories.
Most disappointed was Wolters, who lost to
Canada's Daniel Nestor 6-0,6-1 in the first round.
The San Francisco Chronicle yesterday
screamed, "Stay in School Message Served," with
an article saying, Wolters "tested his ability to
play tennis on the professional level yesterday and
discovered — much to his horror — that he is far
from being ready."
"I did not think that was very nice," a disap
pointed Wolters said. "Playing against the pros is
definitely a huge step up."
"It was a really disappointing tournament for
Rvan," assistant coach John Whitlinger said. "He
did not play as well as he has been (playing). How
ever, Nestor played a great match, and he did not
miss many balls."
Wolters hoped to fair better against Nestor.
Last year in the same tournament, he took four
games from Andre Agassi, one of the top players
in the world. Nestor is ranked 109.
"I definitely felt like I have been playing well,"
Wolters said. "But I got out there, and I just could
not get into a rhythm. I just could not seem to
play well against his style of game."
In the doubles portion of the open, freshman
twins Bob and Mike Bryan did not fare much bet
ter. Playing against Mark Knowles of the
Bahamas and Nestor, the twins fell 6-1, 6-2.
"Knowles and Nestor are an excellent dou
bles team, ranked No. 3 in the world,"
Whitlinger said. "The twins were OK out there,
but Nestor and Knowles are just the better
team. This was a nice learning experience for
the guys. 1 hope they can look back from this
tournament and learn something, even though
it can be really frustrating."
