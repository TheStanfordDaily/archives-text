# Men's rugby to tackle Chico, women take it to Claremont
## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
After remaining undefeated in
the preseason this quarter, the
men's rugby team will try to
carry its momentum to Satur
day's game against Chico State.
Although the Cardinal haven't
lost in 1997, team members still
have learned from the shortcom
ings of their victories. In order to
succeed in the league and eventu
ally the playoffs, the team will
have to dictate the tempo of the
match, as well as step up the
speed of play.
"One of our strengths is our
ability to recycle the ball, to keep
possession," said senior Joel
Drescher. "If we can do that and
remain on offense for a better
part of the game, then we should
be able to dictate both the tempo
and the outcome."
Drescher recently returned
to action and will compete in
this weekend's match after sit
ting out several games due to a
hand injury.
Along with game strategy, the
team also needs to focus on exe
cuting basic skills. Minor mis
takes could cost a game as the
opponents become more difficult.
"I think our passes need to be
a lot sharper, and I think we need
to tackle harder," Drescher said.
"Our veterans need to step up
and kind of show the way for
some of our younger guys."
While the men play at home,
the women's rugby team will
travel to Southern California to
take on Claremont on Saw~- Jn y
The women have had a successful
preseason, using the techniques
that their male counterparts are
working to employ.
"I think we're really aiming to
get our first team players to play
together, to play a competitive
game and to bring in all of the
skills we've learned so far this
year," said sophomore flanker
Lara Strauss.
The team, whose match last
Saturday was canceled, has had
extra time to work on ball control
and defensive realignment.

On Feb. 1, the women were
able to dominate the UC-Santa
Cruz Banana Slugs by constantly
attacking the ball while on

defense. They also kept the
tempo in their favor by avoiding
the Santa Cruz defense while
running the ball down the field.
