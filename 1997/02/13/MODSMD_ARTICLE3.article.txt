# Sex assault line gets more calls
## Cowell says awareness has increased 
### Kelly Vaughan Contributing writer 
The number of calls to the Cam
pus Sexual Assault Response and
Recovery Team has steadily in
creased since team's establish
ment in 1991, according to Alejan
dro Martinez, director for Counsel
ing and Psychological Services at
Cowell Student Health Service.
Martinez attributed this in
crease to greater student aware
ness of and willingness to talk
about sexual harassment and as
sault.
"A lot more attention has been
given to this area by the University
and the media and through stu
dentefforts.... Those efforts com
bined together have made a differ
ence," Martinez said. He pointed to
a 1993 survey on sexual assault
and harassment at Stanford that
showed a narrowing gap between
the number of incidents that take
place and the number that are re
ported.
More than half of students who
have been involved in an assault
have talked to somebody, Martinez

said. He credited the increased
willingness to report assault to the
University's efforts to coordinate a
response that leaves final decisions
to students.
Martinez also said that students
feel comfortable about talking to
team counselors because the team
"is one of only three places in the
University where we can provide
that confidentiality." The other
two are the Help Center for staff
and faculty and the Office of Reli
gious Life.
"If a student is not feeling right
about an event" or feels "either
confusion about what happened
... or emotional distress," that is
the time to call the team, Martinez
said.
"The majority ofincidents con
tinue to involve people who know
each other," he said. In these cases,
"it is not easy to label something
strictly as a rape." He said students
who are uncertain about an inci
dent should call the team to talk
about what happened and decide
how to respond.
Martinez said alcohol continues
to play a significant role in these in
cidents, although there are excep
tions. He suggested the buddy sys
tem as a way of protecting oneself
and one's friends at parties, both
for those at risk of assault and for
those who may need someone to
"help them set some boundaries
and some containment" of their
own behavior. He also said people
should "try to be as clear as they
can with their feelings."
The team is available 24 hours a
day. The staff tries to connect the

individual who calls with one of
their licensed mental health pro
fessionals, Martinez said. Among
the team counselors are two fe
male psychiatrists and a woman
clinical social worker, as well as
male psychologists and coun
selors, he said. "Everyone on the
staff has obtained additional train
ing ... for sexual assault," Mar
tinez said.
As part of the University, the
team is "in a very good position to
coordinate other responses," to
sexual assault, he said. For exam
ple, the staff can assist students in
changing housing and academic
situations and can connect stu
dents with spiritual advisers.
