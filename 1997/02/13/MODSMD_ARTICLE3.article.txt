# Sex assault line gets more calls
## Cowell says awareness has increased 
### Kelly Vaughan Contributing writer 
The number of calls to the Cam
pus Sexual Assault Response and
Recovery Team has steadily in
creased since team's establish
ment in 1991, according to Alejan
dro Martinez, director for Counsel
ing and Psychological Services at
Cowell Student Health Service.
Martinez attributed this in
crease to greater student aware
ness of and willingness to talk
about sexual harassment and as
sault.
"A lot more attention has been
given to this area by the University
and the media and through stu
dentefforts.... Those efforts com
bined together have made a differ
ence," Martinez said. He pointed to
a 1993 survey on sexual assault
and harassment at Stanford that
showed a narrowing gap between
the number of incidents that take
place and the number that are re
ported.
More than half of students who
have been involved in an assault
have talked to somebody, Martinez

said. He credited the increased
willingness to report assault to the
University's efforts to coordinate a
response that leaves final decisions
to students.
Martinez also said that students
feel comfortable about talking to
team counselors because the team
"is one of only three places in the
University where we can provide
that confidentiality." The other
two are the Help Center for staff
and faculty and the Office of Reli
gious Life.
"If a student is not feeling right
about an event" or feels "either
confusion about what happened
... or emotional distress," that is
the time to call the team, Martinez
said.
"The majority ofincidents con
tinue to involve people who know
each other," he said. In these cases,
"it is not easy to label something
strictly as a rape." He said students
who are uncertain about an inci
dent should call the team to talk
about what happened and decide
how to respond.
