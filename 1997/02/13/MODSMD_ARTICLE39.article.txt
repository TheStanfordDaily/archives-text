## Stomp 
### 
A lone sweeper greets the audience and
spontaneously discovers cadence amid the
swirling stage dust. Push and pull. Tap tap.
Swish swish. Onomatopoeias fail to ade
quately describe the percussionist cre
ations of Stomp.
The eight-person troupe's innovative
cleaning style redefines the role of com
mon household cleaning supplies. The
usual images of the laborious chores asso
ciated with trash cans, brooms, dustpans
and industrial-size sinks are replaced by
stimulating rhythmic experiences that ap
peal to the car and entertain the eye with
constant motion.
Percussion genius dominates the pro
duction. The performers elicit musical
masterpieces from what seem to be mun
dane household products. Incipient
rhythms arise from the innocent tappings
of rubber hoses and the flickering of Zippo
lighters.
The magnitude of Stomps success testi
fies to the strength of the performers. Per
formers strap sinks filled with water to
their shoulders, bind large trash cans to
their feet and hang from a scaffolding —
all for the purpose of entertainment. Each
number seems to outdo its predecessor,
and the physical duress required for the ex
ecution of such a show never fails to im
press. Audience members are left awe
struck by the display of pure human abili
ty manifested in each piece.

The show incorporates visual comedy into
the program as well, augmenting the variety
that already pervades the performance. Snif
fling and throat-clearing get weaved into
symphonies with the crinkling of newspa

pers. Tools that normally produce a 2-year
old's cacophonous pots-and-pans creation in
the kitchen become sweet rhythms that hail
from South American bebop. All of these el
ements ultimately produce an inimitably

unique theater experience.
The show has no speaking parts; in the
spirit of the rest of the show, the performers
communicate with the audience solely
through body language. The lone sweeper

leads the audience in a "clappingsession" and
provides a taste of the difficulty of generating
a rapid rhythm.
Luke Creswell created Stomp six years ago
while pounding on overturned garbage cans.
It was first introduced to the public in 1991 at
the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland. Original
ly an eight-person British ensemble, the per
cussion group expanded after experiencing
success in New York's Orpheum Theatre. It
went on to win both Obie and Drama Desk
awards for "most unique theatre experience."
Since then, Stomp has made numerous
television appearances on shows ranging
from the Academy Awards to "The Late Show
with David Letterman."
Now, a pool of 35 Stomp performers (split
into four troupes) is playing in San Francis
co, New York and Minneapolis. U.S. casts
have debuted in Chile, Brazil, Hawaii and
Korea.
The music of Stomp has also been fea
tured on the "Tank Ciirl" soundtrack and in
commercials for Coca-Cola and Target. A
feature film project is currently in the works.
