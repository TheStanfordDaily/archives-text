# New student group advocates veganism
## Education and support are priorities 
### Travis Brandon 
A new student group is working
to educate the campus about the
health benefits of veganism and to
promote general awareness of the
philosophy behind it.
According to freshman Susan
Pasnick, financial manager of the
recently formed Stanford Vegan
Society, the goals of the group in
clude supplying information about
animal rights and providing a sup

discuss their difficulties and frus

about them."
However, sophomore Melissa
Janiak, the founder of the group,
admitted that there has been some
negative feedback, particularly
about the issue of calcium require
ments that the fliers raise.
The society also does dorm pre
sentations at the request of resi
dent assistants. Janiak described a
recent presentation at Yost as "a
real success" and expressed an ea
gerness to do more in the future.
"People respond to these pre
sentations because a lot don't
know the details of the problems
with eating meat," she said. "Also,
there is a lot of confusion about
what it means to be a vegan."
"We are not belligerent about it

one meal a day. We just want peo
