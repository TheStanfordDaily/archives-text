# New student group advocates veganism
## Education and support are priorities 
### Travis Brandon 
A new student group is working
to educate the campus about the
health benefits of veganism and to
promote general awareness of the
philosophy behind it.
According to freshman Susan
Pasnick, financial manager of the
recently formed Stanford Vegan
Society, the goals of the group in
clude supplying information about
animal rights and providing a sup
port group where members can
discuss their difficulties and frus
trations with obtaining proper nu
trition in the current Stanford din
ing system.
Vegans, like vegetarians, do not
consume meat or meat products.
However, they take it a step fur
ther and also avoid eating animal
products, including eggs and dairy
foods.
Currently, the society's main
project is a series of bathroom stall
fliers containing different aspects
of the case for veganism. Their lat
est flier around campus concerns
the health problems associated
with eating meat. In the next few
weeks, the group plans to put up
fliers about environmental and an
imal rights issues.
"In general, there has been a
very positive response to the

fliers," Pasnick said. "We've re
ceived a bunch of e-mail from peo
ple interested in the health bene
fits."
Chaddus Bruce, a freshman
member of the group, said the ap
peal of the fliers is their factual na
ture. "We document our sources
well and just present the facts as
they are, so that people will get in
terested in the ideas and think
about them."
However, sophomore Melissa
Janiak, the founder of the group,
admitted that there has been some
negative feedback, particularly
about the issue of calcium require
ments that the fliers raise.
The society also does dorm pre
sentations at the request of resi
dent assistants. Janiak described a
recent presentation at Yost as "a
real success" and expressed an ea
gerness to do more in the future.
"People respond to these pre
sentations because a lot don't
know the details of the problems
with eating meat," she said. "Also,
there is a lot of confusion about
what it means to be a vegan."
"We are not belligerent about it
at all," Bruce said. "A person can
help simply by not eating meat at
one meal a day. We just want peo
pie to do what they can and really
think about the issues."
Pasnick claimed that after the
Yost presentation, several people
declared an interest in becoming
vegetarian, vegan or just cutting
down their meat intake.
Future projects include the invi
tation of guest speakers, the setup
of an information booth at the
Earth Day festival on campus and
work with Housing and Dining
Services to promote the "Great
American Meat-Out" on March 14.
"We would also like to have a
table in White Plaza and show
movies, but we need more mem
bers and more funding," said Jani
ak.
In general, all the members

agree that Stanford is a "pretty
good" environment for vegans,
because there is always a salad
bar and at least one vegan option.
However, they said they feel that
there needs to be more awareness
of veganism in Dining Services.
The society advocates clear la
beling of vegan entrees as well as
more information about the in
gredients of Dining Services food.
Also, the group said they would
like Dining Services to educate
hashers about the food that they
serve and vegan requirements.
Many problems would be
solved by "a greater awareness of
what it means to be vegan," said
Janiak. "For instance, a vegan
can't eat butter, but he can eat
margarine."
Pasnick and Bruce also said
they felt that soy milk — a vegan
staple — should be offered in the
dining halls.
