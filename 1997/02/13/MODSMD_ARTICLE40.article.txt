## Jazz at the Coffee House 
### 
February at the Coffee House promises to be more ex
citing than the enigma machine. This month, Stanford
combos, including His Boy Elroy and Surplus Quartet,
are playing jazz variations, with Drue Kataoka's paint
ings of jazz musicians as a fitting background. Tomor
row, Entre Parenthesis (Los Bugs) presents its special
valentine in the form of an Andean-jazz-diasporic funk
synthesis experience.

"We're not a professional
band," said Andean multi-in
strumentalist Claud io
Duran, a doctoral student.
"We play to keep doing some
thing — one could call it a
parenthesis in each of our
lives, for most of our time is
spent in academic endeavors.
Entre Parenthesis (Los Bugs)
keeps our imaginations fed
and serves as a test ground for
ideas we've toyed with for a
long time."
A Chilean emigre, Duran
has performed, taught and
recorded Latin American
music — especially Andean
music — since age 14. Skilled
in a number of Andean flutes,

as well as the Venezuelan cuatro and the Colombian
tiple, Duran has enjoyed a long musical career.
In the 19705, he performed with traditional folk
groups in Chile. More recently, he participated in
Amnesty International's concerts with Jackson Browne
and played with Pete Seeger and Sting.
Entre Parenthesis (Los Bugs) is a chance for Duran
and the other band members to synthesize their varied
musical backgrounds, which range from classical to
funk-rock. Binding them all is the Chilean background
shared by four of the five members.
A Latin American flavor pervades the whole of their
oeuvre. Entre Parenthesis (Los Bugs) performs in Span
ish and Aimara, using both traditional and electronic in
struments.
"It's a relationship of respect," Duran explained.
"One wants to render music in its most pristine form
and yet add layers of complexity."
This sort of deep-text thoughtfulness comes natural
ly to Duran, a doctoral candidate in modern thought
and literature. His dissertation uses poems and music to
explore the plight of Chilean exiles in the Bay Area, as
well as the larger issues of citizenship and diaspora.
"The Andean world and its music has metamor
phosed in a way that's very resistant, that still manages to
percolate even after colonialization," said Duran.
