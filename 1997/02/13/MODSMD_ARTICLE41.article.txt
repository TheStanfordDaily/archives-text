## Braces FOR Beck 
### 
For those who temporarily forgot about
Beck after his 1993 smash single, "Loser,"
a reintroduction may be in order. No, the
experimental L.A. icon hasn't reinvented
himself in the wake of his defining teen-age an
them, nor has he decided to refine his image.
Four years and three albums later, Beck has re
vealed an entire musical philosophy, one that
transcends beyond buzz

phrases like "one-hit
wonder" and "sopho
more slump."
For born-again Beck
fans, this means that his
latest album, "Odelay"
(DGC / Geffen / Bong
Load), carries itself like a
proud debut, lust as the
Beastie Boys evolved be
yond "License to III,"
Beck's latest release
charismatically eludes
his once-confining
slacker image. Critics
agree: "Odelay" received
rave reviews after its re
lease last summer in
cluding three Grammy
nominations, an MTV
video award and plat
inum sales.
Beck, who performs
at Memorial Auditori
um Saturday night, may
have plans to utterly dis
mantle Stanford's con
ceptions of a normal
rock concert. His com
plicated musicality has
sent shockwaves into
pop's psyche, disturbing
the already scattered ter
rain of new music by ir
reverently cross-polli
nating different genres
and moods.
Beck's vision for the
quintessential public
performance is yet to be
defined, leaving the
Beck "experience" total
ly unpredictable and ut
terly confusing. Known
to take his audiences on
divergent journeys,
Beck's concerts range
from the ultra-mellow
seductive trance to high
e nergy ca 11 -a nd - response
participation. Don't besui

prised if the dazzling Beck Hansen (his real
name) makes you chant old Vidal Sassoon ads
or, better yet, invites you to share his spotlight
on stage momentarily.
As for categories, Beck may just have that
special charisma necessary to be dubbed a pio
neer. His style is best defined as "modern retro,"
an oxymoron as confusing as hip-hop played to
backwoods folk, techno mixed with blues and
Schubert dancing to grind-core — all of which
can be found on "Odciay."
For Beck, retro music alone lacks some orig
inality: "This need to goof on something we did

ten years ago is something I would really like to
move away from," Beck told Spin magazine,
after recently being awarded the magazine's
"Artist of the Year" accolade. "That's why I was
initially attracted to folk music and ultimately
hip-hop."
With a lyrical style that has been compared
to Hob Dylan's free associations, Beck's energy

doesn't stray far from his original passion with
folk. Several songs on his new album, including
"Ramshackle" and "Hotwax," contain a dis
tinctly grassroots feel.
Yet the allure of "Odelay" lies in its sophisti
cated combinations of apples and oranges, its
mischievous questioning of music's peculiar
rules and reverences. Funk beats feel complete
ly comfortable next to acoustic riffing, just as
'60s keyboards dance harmoniously with hip
hop beats.
For Beck, this adventurous chemistry dates
back to his time in New York (in the early

1980s), a virtual petri dish of musical epipha
nies for the soon-to-be star. While seeking to
define his musical style, Beck realized that genre

and lyrics need not correspond
and recognized the infinite
possibilities that lay in appro
priating different musical tra
ditions.
From this atmosphere of
bold invention came the mate
rials for "Mellow Gold,"
(DGC / Geffen / Bong Load)
including "Loser." At the time
he wrote "Loser," Beck had not
been signed by Geffen Records,
and the single received no pro-

motion at all.
Yet several months after its release, the song
was being played on radio stations across the
country. Its catchy chorus, cleverly alternated
with its Spanish translation, captured young au
diences: "I'm a loser, baby / So why don't you
kill me?"
After the excitement over "Loser" calmed
down a bit, Beck continued to

tinker with his knack for in
venting catchy sounds and slo
gans. And after his period in
New York, Beck's musical in
novation seemed to laugh at
everyone else's seemingly
pointless orthodoxies. The re
sults may have crystallized on
"Odelay," which combines
acoustic guitar and campfire
songs with futuristic am
biance.

Perhaps most pecu
liar about "Odelay"
•
is Beck's choice of
producer. The
album is helmed by
the Dust Brothers,
a duo responsible

for placing Los Ange
les on the map with tracks for
stars like Tone Loc, Young MC
and the Beastie Boys.
Similarities to recent Beastie
albums "111 Communication"
and "Check Your Head
abound, yet Beck deftly blends
his homespun folksy influence
into the Dust Brothers' seem
ingly incongruous palette. The
result is a progressive futurism;
a modern opus that doesn't
disappoint.
Beck, who is weaving the
West Coast on the February
leg of his tour, may just decide
to combine a few more ex
tremities come Saturday night.
Perhaps Beck is just as curious
as his audience to figure out
what results at this upcoming
Mem Aud rendezvous. In such
a bizarre atmosphere, a sur
prise can only be predictable,
and anything predictable
comes as a surprise.
