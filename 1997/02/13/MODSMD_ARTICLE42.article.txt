# Waiting For Bodrov
## Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov's journey with 'Prisoner of the Mountains' 
### 
Night has fallen. The mountain village, your home during these past
seven months, breathes in sleepy sounds — murmurs of the days ac

tivities laid to rest, played in strange harmony against the rumblings of

shady night business. Out of the darkness comes the figure of a man who

is stout, muscular, definitely bigger than you. You recognize him as one

of the professional wrestlers hired as your bodyguards. But tonight

he is inebriated, and as you reconsider asking him the cause of his

insomnia, he gives you this proposition: pay him and his cowork

ers $50,000 more or else you re not going home.

It was in this way that Russian director Sergei Bodrov t
found himself in a situation similar to that of the Russian c

hostages in his film, "Prisoner of the Mountains."
Apparently, the bodyguards had found out that one
of Bodrov's stars, 12-year-old Susanna Mekhralieva,
was being paid more than they were. Having been
raised in a culture as unacquainted with women's lib as
with running water, they were, needless to say, insulted.
Fortunately for Bodrov, his personal hostage experi
ence came to a peaceful end after two days of negotiations
and a couple of thousand dollars — and not without
some humor.
"I wasn't scared," Bodrov said. "It was the end of the
movie, and I was tired. [I thought], 'We're hostages now,
but maybe I can take two days off.' "
This combination of dry wit and intrepidity brought
Bodrov from a career as a satirist to one as a screenwriter
and then yet another one as a serious filmmaker who
chose the Republic of Dagestan, neighbor of war-torn
Chechnya, as the setting for his latest picture. Although he

"/ want to be human, and I want to be human with my audience" -

doesn't deny that recent fighting in Chechnya as it strug
gled for independence from Russia lends both a legitima
cy and timeliness to the story, Bodrov makes it clear that
the film focuses on the enduring themes of human nature
and relationships.

"Prisoner of the Mountains," is

about two Russian soldiers on a

mountain patrol who are

taken hostage by Cau

casian villagers. It is

based on Leo Tolstoy's

novella, "Prisoner of

the Caucasus," a fa

vorite story from

Bodrov's child
hood. But Tol
stoy's pro-Russ
ian / anti-Cau
casian slant on
the story — Tol
stoy was a Russ
ian soldier — is
conspicuously
absent from this
modern version.

"I wasn't inter

ested in making a

political film," Bo

uiov said. "All those po

litical films are interesting

today, |but] tomorrow

they're like old newspapers. [This film | is
about people and relationships."
This film is also about stopping the

mindless dictum of kill-or-be-killed. A
pacifist, Bodrov said, "I think it's so stu
pid and unfortunate (that] people can't
sometimes find a common language.
They don't even want to share. They
don't want to hear another person.
They don't want to understand other
people."
Or simply, he said, "It's easier to kill a
man than to love him."

But Bodrov's disappointment in hu- 1
mankind is countered by an optimism in '
the intrinsic goodness of human nature,
which he believes he sees in people he
knows. In the film, a similar dynamic be
tween the opposing forces of rage and
compassion is both poignant and sobering-

TyreailsTic.
"I want to be human, and 1 want to he human

with my audience," Bodrov said. "I want to tell re
ally good stories — strong stories, emotional
[ones]."

Bodrovs desire to tell a good story is still his pri
mary motivation for making movies, although his recent
life in America — he now splits his time between a

house in Venice Beach, Calif., and Moscow — has

taught him to cater more to his audience. The

pressures of U.S. marketability, however, do not

discourage him. They challenge him to make

movies which are attractive by virtue of their
quality.

Despite this belief, Bodrov is as pes
simistic as the next person when it comes to

things like changing the world. As the pop
ularity of "Prisoner of the Mountains" es
calated in Russia last year, Yeltsin was pur
ported to have pushed for peace between
Russia and Chechnya after seeing it. Al
though Bodrov acknowledges the connec
tion, he did not have this effect in mind.

It'ssonaive, you know, (tothink] 'Oh,

I will make a movie, and the president will

change his mind.' No. No way. You just want

to make a good movie. And you are thinking

ahout yourself, you know? You like what you

are doing or [ you don't 1. It's interesting for you or
not."
The principal players, including the famous Russ

ian actor Oleg Menshikov and Bodrov's son, Sergei Jr., also
deliver impressive performances as the two Russian sol

diers who are taken

hostage. Sergei Jr. does well
in his debut performance even according to his father, who
was initially reluctant to audition him.
Many locals who were cast in the film were also first
time actors, including young Susanna Mekhralieva, who
plays the perspicacious daughter of one of the hostage
takers. Bodrov was fortunate to discover her on his first
day at a local school.
"I knew as soon as she turned her head and I savs those
eyes," he said. "She learned quickly. By the end, she was
able to take direction like an experienced actress.'
As someone who once interviewed more than 2,(MM)
boys before finding the right one tor a part, Bodrov know s
that hard work pays off.
"I work a lot with non-professionals because it you're
lucky and find the right people, they're brilliant. l he\ re
so natural," he said.
Indeed, "Prisoner of the Mountains" is brilliant. It won
the Public Prize at the 1W6 Cannes Film festival and got
excellent reviews at other festivals, including the Sun
dance. Obviously, in the eyes of the rest of the world,
Sergei Bodrov's hard work has paid oft.
