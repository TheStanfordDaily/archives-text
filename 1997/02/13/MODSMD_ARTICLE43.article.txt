# Critics, women and why he hates Hemingway
## Intermission talks to John Irving 
### 
The world of the John Irving fan:
The reading list for your Eng
lish class would be "The World Ac
cording to Garp" (1978), "The Hotel
New Hampshire (1981), "The Cider
House Rules" (1985), "A Prayer for
Owen Meany" (1989, "A Son of the
Circus" (1994) and "Trying to Save
Piggy Sneed" (1996),
John Irving would be your pro
fessor, and you'd be in line for an easy
A — as long as you didn't skim the
reading. Which of course you wouldn't
because if you were a true Irving fan,
you would read every word.
In response to Intermission's ques
tions, Irving talked about fans, crit
ics, authors he hates, authors he
loves, Dutch cops and women.

Intermission: At the age of 53, do you think you're still developing as a writer? How do you keep your
writing fresh?
John Irving: The problem with interviewing a novelist is that most of the questions, invariably, are
concerned with the presumed effect of the novelist on readers and / or critics; I'm quite sure that the
novelist is a poor judge of that.
In my case, I simply don't think about it. I am interested in storytelling, in the craft of it, in the nar
rative choices, in the development of character. If I were a graphic artist, everyone would understand,
I think, that what I do best and like most to do is simply draw, that the subjects keep changing, or (to
a degree) stay the same, but that it is the drawing itself that interests me.
Well, it is the writing itself that interests me... the process, the revisions, the shaping of the whole,
the structure of the story, beginning with such basic carpentry as the decision to tell a story in the first
person or in the third-person voice.
Hence, do I think I am still developing as a writer, and how do I keep my writing fresh? Well, these
aren't issues. I write every day... if only to look at a sentence and then change it in some small way.
It's always "fresh" for me.
And there are so many ways to tell a story: For example, I have written my last three novels ("The
Cider House Rules," "A Prayer for Owen Meany" and "A Son of the Circus") from the most compli
cated narrative position I could conceive. Not beginning at the beginning, for example, having almost
as much flashback as a forward-moving story and with sizable amounts of flashforwarding, too.
I enjoyed that, but after three novels I find myself wanting to go back to a simpler narrative line, a
more linear narrative, a chronological story — you see, the w«yyou tell a story is what makes the
process fresh for the storyteller.
I: What advice would you give an aspiring writer?
JI: That's an easy one. The only advice I have for aspiring writers is to read a lot when you're young,
because if you do get to be a writer, and you're the real thing, you won't have any time to read as you
get older... You'll always be writing!
Nowadays I read about two books a year, although I probably start more than 100 or 150. This is
not an exaggeration.
I: In an essay on Charles Pickens that appears in "Piggy Sneed,"you write that critical appreciation is
often withdrawn from writers who have too many readers. Why does that happen, and does it matter?
JI: Well, so what? Of course it's true, but does it matter? Not much. Writers with huge readerships
don't need critical affection. I would rather have readers than good reviews; even so, the majority of
my reviews are good, so I'm doubly lucky.
And I don't complain about the bad ones. A "good" bad review, one in which the reviewer declares
his or her hatred for all your work (not just the book in question) is especially gratifying, for one can
not inspire love, have readers in 35 languages and not inspire envy and loathing, too.
You must understand that the critic sees himself as a necessary part of the literary process; at least,
he wants to be necessary to the process of a book finding a reader. He wants to be the middleman, the
certified approver.
But in the case of a popular author, an author whose books will be bought by the thousands, re
gardless of the reviews (or even the lack thereof), the reviewer feels rightly that he has been passed
over. Such an author mainlinesan audience —he goes right to the reader without the need of the crit
ic's approval. This is not appreciated by the critic.
Also, critics are not readers... at least not to the extent that many readers are fans. Critics deplore
fans. And a popular author doesn't merely have readers — he has fans.
It's a pity that critics are credited with being close readers, which they are not. It is not their malice
that I dislike, but their laziness is unforgivable. A loving reader reads every word. No negative re
viewer can possibly do that, and the mistakes of misreading are more angering to me than to discover
that the reviewer hates me.
As I've said, that kind of hatred can be gratifying, but not errors.... I mean the common er

rors that come from skimming a book, of hasty reading. I used to teach freshman English, after
all. Most of the negative reviews I read (I don't mean only of my b00k5...) would receive a fail
ing grade in any freshman English class I ever taught, and I was a popular teacher in part because
I was an easy grader.
I: Why do you think your work inspires such passion in your fans? Especially female fans?
J.1.: I don't know. You can't generalize. Especially in my case because I have different audiences in
different countries, and different generations of my readers are fans of different books.
For example, I read over and over again (in the press in this country) that "Carp" is the most pop
ular among my readers and the book I'm best known for. That is true only of a generation of Amen
can readers, especially men between their late 40s and late 60s.
College students today, if they read me, tend to have read either "The Cider House Rules" or "A
Prayer for Owen Meany." In high schools, "Owen Meany" is taught more than any other of my nov
els; in colleges, "Cider House" is the most taught, "Owen Meany" second — and "Carp" a distant
third.
More than half of my income as a writer comes from translations. Prior to the success of "A Son of
the Circus" in Europe, both "Cider House" and "Owen Meany" were far more widely read than
"Carp." In Europe, "The Hotel New Hampshire" was far better received than "Garp."
I can't and don't analyze this. I'm just grateful to have so many readers, and it's especially gratify
ing that so many of them are young. It encourages me that there are so many readers who make de
mands on themselves as readers because my books are not easy to read; they arc long and at times cir
cuitous investments of energy and time. My critics may "skim" my books; my readers don't — they
read every word, and that's not easy.
As for the women readers, it's not me they're interested in; it's the woman characters: Jenny in "Garp,"
Franny in "Hotel New Hampshire," Candy and Melony in "Cider House," Hester and the mother and
the grandmother in "Owen Meany," Nancy in "A Son of the Circus." They're good characters.
That I am popular has to do with my characters. I think my readers like my books because the char
acters become real to them. This is a simple aim of the 19th-century novel, which remains (in my
view) the model of the form. I've known a number of women who've fallen into adultery, but I feel 1
never knew one as well as I knew Emma Bovary.
I: You originally submitted the short story "Hrennhar's Rant," which appears in "Piggy Sneed," to Play
boy magazine under a female pseudonym. What made you think you could write a convincing story from
a woman's point of view?
J.1.: I thought: Any writer who's any good can write a story from anyone's point of view, surely.
And nowadays, of course, we are burdened by this form of political correctness called "cultural ap
propriation." You know about this? That's when a Native American or a Hindi from Bombay gets
angry because someone has "appropriated" his "culture"—meaning that I write a book about a Parsi
from Bombay, but I'm not an actual Indian of any kind. Meaning that William Styron wasn't sup
posed to write "The Confessions of Nat Turner."

There was a review of "Cider House" that said as much: that Dr. Larch, being an obstetrician and
gynecologist, should have been a woman and that /should not have written a book on the subject be
cause it was a woman's subject.
Well, spare me. Cultures can't be appropriated. Not in literature. George Eliot failed to convince
Dickens that she was a man but Dickens wasn't offended by this; rather, he complimented her on how
womanly a sensibility "he" had. Very clever.
My ninth novel ("A Widow for One Year") will be the first with a woman as my main character. It
was never that Dr. Daruwalla (in "A Son of the Circus") was Indian-born that bothered me nor was
that especially difficult. It was that he wasa doctor... now that was difficult. That required some cau
tion. But I had written about doctors before, so I knew it was merely a matter of research and having
the right readers (expert readers) looking over my shoulder.
In the case of "A Son of the Circus," there was some grumbling of the cultural appropriation kind,
yet my only reviews from Indian writers were most favorable, and the majority of fan letters for that
book were from Indians like Dr. Daruwalla — "Indians but not Indians," Indians not living in India
(and not at all comfortable when they return to India).

Of all my novels, "A Son of the Cir
cus" is the one that got the most letters
from readers saying, in effect, "I am
Dr. Paruwalla." Which was the point
about him ... that he was common,
that his foreignness was growing or
dinary. I never got very many letters
from people saying "I am Homer
Wells." Or "I am T.S. Garp."

"Novels (at least mine) aren't ideas; they're sto
ries, they're characters. If my ideas mattered to
me, I wouldn't write novels, I'm not an intellectu
al; I'm a carpenter — I build stories/

I: Is it harder for you to create a con
vincing female character than a male character?
J.1.: No. It is different but not harder. It may in some ways be easier. Characters at some distance
from me — not at all the same as me — are easier for me than characters with whom I share many
things.
My point of view regarding Vietnam, for example. It is neither Owen's point of view nor Johnny
Wheelwright's. I needed to make their reactions "typical" in ways that weren't mine. As for my per
sonal point-of-view character in "Owen Meany," the grandmother is my mouthpiece.
I don't find it essential (or even meaningful) to have a personal mouthpiece or spokesman among
my characters: It's easier to create characters with views different from your own, even opposite to
your own, than to rely on your own opinions as the essential traits ot your characters.
Novels (at least mine) aren't ideas. They're stories; they're characters. If my ideas mattered to me,
I wouldn't write novels. I'm not an intellectual; I'm a carpenter — I build stories.

I: At this point in your career, do you have trouble getting honest feedback on your work?
J.L: Honest feedback? No, I don't have trouble getting that. I have some old friends who treat m<
with appropriate disrespect.
In cases like "Cider House" and "A Son of the Circus ," where there was so much medical detail anc
foreign material... well, then in addition to editors 1 was hearing feedback ofa specific kind, too —
mean from doctors, from Indians.
With novels the length of mine, novels that cannot be read in a single sitting and may in all likeli
hood be read over several weeks, even months, it is essential to have tresh readers reading a manuscrip
for the first time... telling you that they missed this or that detail, or that this or that detail was un
necessary.
That kind of reading, a good first reader, is essential to me. I spend five or six years with a book,
know everythingin it, but therefore I don't know how clear (or too clear) some details are for the read
er encountering these details for the first time. If I wrote 125-page novels, I wouldn't need any outsid
readers.
/: Some writers say you should only write about wluit you've experienced or what you know. Wluit is your rc
sponse to this?

J.I.: Well, if I had no imagi
nation at all, I'd probably be saying
the same thing. If I couldn't imag
ine the life in an orphanage in
Maine before I was born, it I
couldn't imagine the dilemma of
an unadoptable orphan being
taught obstetrical and gynecologi

cal procedures, including abortion, if
I couldn't imagine the loneliness of an Indian-born orthopedist living in (Canada and dreaming about
the Indian circus
Well, if I couldn't imagine those things or other things beyond the narrow experience of my own
personal life, I think I would choose not to write novels at all.
I detest novels that are blandly fictionalized accounts ot the writer's life (from the time of their last
book to the time of their next). Autobiographical fiction is ruining fiction. I have nothing against au
tobiography; 1 enjoy reading straight autobiographies. But a novel, as Hardy said, should be a better
story than one might find every day in the newspaper.
The last three years I've been spending a lot of time with a Dutch cop; I 've been listening to how
he would go about investigating a very particular kind of murder in the red-light district in Amster
dam ... This is a fictional murder. I've invented the murder, including the victim, the witness and the
murderer; the Dutch policeman has provided me with the real detail ot how he would proceed with
the "evidence" I have created for him.
What would these "writers" you're telling me about have me do? Stay in Vermont and write about
a writer watching the snow tall or teaching his youngest son how to ski? Boy, that would be interest
ing!
I say to these writers: (.let an imagination or get another line of work. I suppose Flaubert should have writ
ten about Charles Bovarv instead of Emma? I'm glad he "imagined" Emma— She's much more interesting
than Charles.
I: What five American works of fiction written after 1975 would you recommend to a friend?
J.I.: Frankly, 1 would rather give him five 19th-century novels, and I'd suggest he forget about
American literature altogether. I was never an American literature fan. I hate Hemingway, 1 think
Faulkner is tedious and Fitzgerald is greatly overrated. I like Melville and Hawthorne.
As for contemporaries, there is no more original writer alive than Kurt Vonnegut. I like Robert
Stone. Peter Matthiessen. Craig Nova. Ron Hansen. Gail Godwin. But particularly Ron Hansen's
"Mariette in Ecstasy," and before it his "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."
Craig Nova's "The Good Son," "Trombone," "The Book of Dreams" and his forthcoming "The Uni
versal Donor" (the last isn't published until June, I think). Those two writers alone have more than
five books published since 1975 that are well worth reading!
As for short stories (you said "fiction," not just novels), Andre Dubus is a wonderful short story
writer, as is the Canadian Alice Munro (I think she's t he best short story writer alive, or at least as good
as William Trevor, who is also excellent).
Moving into Canada, Robertson Davies was a wonderful novelist, both the Trollope and I Sickens
of Canada; I like Margaret Atwood too. And Michael Ondaatje. Across the Atlantic, Julian Barnes is
very good. Salman Rushdie is very good. And that the German novelist Gunter Grass hasn't been
given the Nobel certainly diminishes the Nobel from any seriousness, not that they already haven't
diminished their "seriousness" by never giving the Nobel to (.raham Greene.
Well, even as little as I read, I don't find that 1975 is some magical cutoff date to good reading
There's lots of good reading around I just don't have the time.
