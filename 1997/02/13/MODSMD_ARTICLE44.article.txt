## Wesley Willis "Feel The Power" 
### 
For those of you who haven't heard of
Wesley Willis: Picture a 320-pound, home
less schizophrenic using a cheap keyboard
to write tunes with brilliant titles like
"Shoot Me In The Ass," "The Chickencow"
and"I Whupped Batman's Ass." If this
image doesn't at least make you smirk, stop
reading now.
Ignoring, for a moment, the question of
whether it's reprehensible to laugh at some
one with a mental disorder, Willis' new
album, "Feel The Power," is a monumental
accomplishment, with 24 almost identical
songs (all pre-programmed into his key
board), differing only in their lyrical com
plexity.
Here's a brief summary of a Willis song:
brief intro, four-line verse, chorus (four
repetitions of the song title), verse, chorus,
two-minute bridge in which nothing hap
pens, verse, chorus and the sentence "Rock
over London; rock on Chicago," followed
by some commercial catch-phrase (e.g.,
"Budweiser: It's the king of beers").
Given this, one might ask, "What possi
ble motivation could anyone have for lis
tening to even one such song, much less a
whole album like this?" The answer is sim
ple: Wesley's lyrics can be side-splittingly
funny.
Take the song "Ice Cube," for instance,

in which Wesley sings, "You arc a gangsta
rap artist; you are a good gangsta rapper;
you can really rap like a magic kiss; you can
really whup a camel's ass." Or then there's
the song "Snoop Doggy Dogg," where he
sings, "You are a gangsta rapper; you are a
gangsta rap artist; you can really rap like a
magic kiss; you can really whup a zebra's
ass."
Thematically, Wesley tends to focus on
people he likes ("Jello Biafra," "Jason Dum
meldinger," "Melissa Dragich"), rock and
roll ("Alice in Chains," "Flay that Rock and
Roll," "Rock and Roll Power"), getting shot
("Shoot Me in the Ass," "Shoot Me Down")
and buses ("Fit Throwing Hell Ride,"
"Freak Out Hell Bus," "Hell Me on the
Bus").
His penchant for certain phrases like
"rock me like a magic kiss," "the jam session
was awesome" and "you can really whup a
camel's / horse's / leopard's ass" is ex
tremely entertaining, and the fact that he
can't keep a tune makes his attempts at
singing a riot. Once you've listened to this
album, you will probably never listen to the
whole thing again, because the first 30 sec
onds and the last 10 seconds are the only
worthwhile parts of his songs.
Overall, this album is musically abysmal,
painfully repetitive and redeemed only by

Wesley's (unintentional?) comedic genius.
Returning to the question of morality: is It
evil to laugh at Wesley Willis? I would defi

nitely say yes. I'll take the "Freak Out Hell
Bus" straight down.
