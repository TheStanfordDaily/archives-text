## "Snowman" 
### 
I don't quite understand this band, hut
I kind of like it anyway.
To say the sound is something new
would be a flat-out lie, but there's some
thing about the lyrics that gives them a
They-Might-Be-Giants-on-crack feel.
Musically there's kind of a mix. At times
you think you're listening to Bush; at
times it's Offspring. And sometimes there
are even hints of Smashing Pumpkins
guitar riffs.
Basically this is your typical heavy
guitar and drums rock band, with vocal
ist Tom Barnes pounding out the angst
ridden lyrics in true '90s style. The lyrics
are few, the annoyance is high and the
number of simple chords is plenty —
and for some reason I still like the album.
Perhaps it's because they throw in non
sensical lyrics like "then 1 remembered
what the old man said/'oh my head! oh
my head!' /it made me laugh out
loud/and then 1 took my clothes off and
jumped out" and "turtle dove your eyes,
your eyes are peaches/turtle dove you
know how I love peaches."
Maybe it's the fact that Barnes likes to
yell out those lyrics as loudly as he can and
in the most angry, annoyed, fed-up with
the world tone that he can. Or maybe it's
just that Boutros Boutros-Ghali is in one
of the songs, "Killer Willow."
In the album's first song, "Ballerina,"

Barnes asks such thought-provoking
questions as, "Have you ever had an ante
lope steak?" and "What's up with your
freckles?" The song itself oscillates be
tween passive vocals with a steady drum
beat and yelling with rough guitar
chords.
"Man Club" describes the disturbed
thoughts of an adolescent in high school
dealing with the enigma of women — an
enigma that has recently entered his life.
Again, quite the angst-filled song.
The band seems to have had trouble
coming up with a solid melody for "Trou
ble." They just break out into loud noise
whenever they can't go any further with
the lyrics or guitar parts.
Basically there's not much to say about
this band, other than they're not really all
that original outside of their lyrics and
even those are a meaningless jumble of
what could very likely be drug-induced
thoughts.
Still, a few gems are hidden in there,
and although there's very little innovative
musical talent evident here, most of the
album is pretty fun to listen to. Many of
the songs are catchy and up-beat, al
though a few are rather dark, and of
course, there are always the fantastic
lyrics. "She called me a maggot and sat on
my lap well." Hmm....
