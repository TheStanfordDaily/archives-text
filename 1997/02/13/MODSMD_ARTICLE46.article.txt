## "Too Many Days Without Thinking" 
### 
It's a pleasure to hear a rock band that has
not only a unique sound but also original sensi
bilities about its music and its art. You might be
tempted to drop the San Francisco-based band
Swell into the "art rock" genre, but that
wouldn't do justice to the cohesive musicality
infused throughout its soon-to-be-released
fourth album, "Too Many Days Without
Drinking."
This guitar, bass and drums trio establishes
strong, rhythmic grooves that lay the founda
tion for the fluidly mesmerizing guitar and har
monized vocals that are central elements of the
album. Tracks on "Too Many Days Without
Drinking" range from subtly melodious melan
choly to complex, psychedelia. Even with the
reverberations of Annie Lennox-inspired
indie-pop, folk rock and ambient buried in
their music, Swell has still managed to produce
a rock album of conceptual unity.
Swell's attempt to generate a multifaceted re
sponse to their music is aided by the contrast of
satisfyingly rocking instrumentation with
evocative, sincere lyrics. "1 want to take you
down /and find out /what is on your mind,"
sings guitarist David Freel in "Bridgette, You
Love Me," articulating the emotional forces that
drive the album.
Swell is telling us what is on its members'
minds — the love and despair of their lives —
but there is also a verbalized desire that the ex
ploratory experience of interaction between the
album and the listener be somehow understood
another way, beyond the world of the listener's
ego. Only then does the album begin to take on

form as an entity that has its own emotions and
experiences to relate, and it is the precision and
accuracy with which Swell has crafted the
album that brings me to label it art.
With the track "Fuck Even Flow," Swell con
sciously rejects the repetitious formula that can
lead even an indie-rock cult band to main
stream success. Judging from the fact that this is
the band's fourth album in six years, I'd say it
has won its point — a band that makes its music
into art may not become arena megastars, but
there will always be enough supportive people
who think that sort of artistic integrity is — I
