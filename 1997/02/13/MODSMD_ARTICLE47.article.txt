# The 						1-4-5's
## "Rock Invasion" 
### 
Having trouble finding a summer job?
Why not start a band with three of your
friends and play some low-fidelity dork
garage pop? I.ucky for you, The 1-4-s's in
clude instructions on how to start your own
rock band in their liner notes.
Unassuming University of Texas college
students by day, the four band members
don crash helmets and musical instruments
and are instantaneously transformed into
"Major Trouble," "Death Blow," "Lady Ace"
and "Crazy Guy," a.k.a. The 1-4-s's. Thus
transformed, they're ready to rip through
songs with "titles" like "Rock Vigilantes,"
"Rock Invasion," "Can't Stop the Rock" and
"Rock, Rock, Rock." But just because they
approach the music with a silly attitude,
don't label them a joke band. On the con
trary, they play some real gems: mostly
short, rapid-fire bursts of super-fuzzed,
trashed-out rock blasts.
Sprinkled with rewed-up covers such as
"That Ain't No Rock" (originally "409" by
the Beach Boys) and "Rock in the City"
(originally "My Baby Does the Hanky
Panky" by Tommy James and the Shon
dells), the album is full of songs sure to get
any rock party hopping, especially "Big
Rock," with its dance instructions: "Take
one step forward and four steps back / have
fun with your buddies and don't look back /
Do the 1-4-5!"
Most songs on the album don't rely on

lyrics for their kick, and when they do
it's just for silliness. But don't let this
stop you from joining in; "Rock 'n' Roll
Music" with its muddy, slightly blues
tinged guitars and its unintelligible
lyrics — "In a trash can of beer" is all
that can be understood — is a definite
foot-stompin' sing-along. In fact, the
formula for most songs on the album
seems to be a crisp guitar lead over a
background of fuzzed-out guitars,
drums, hiss and feedback, featuring
drowned male and female vocals.
Another hit sure to get your party
shakin' is "Rock Vigilantes" — The 1 -4-
s's theme song — with its call and re
sponse refrain "Who are these
guys? / We're The 1-4-s's!!"
And not to be missed is "Rock, Rock,
Rock" — an ode to that marvel of auto
motive engineering, the El Camino: "It
doesn't go very fast, but it's built really
tough / It's got a back like a truck,
where you can put lots of stuff. . . Take
her out on the road and push it up to
45."
So if the job hunt still has you
stumped, take your cue from The 1-4-
s's: put on your crash helmet, pick up
your guitar and start playing some
fuzzed-out 10-fi rockers at the next party
you can find.
