# The 						Neville Brothers
## "The Very Best of The Neville Brothers" 
### 
It's really a shame that nearly the only na
tional exposure this venerable New Orleans
group has received is via Aaron's schmaltzy
ballads with Linda Rondstandt. When 1 tell
my friends The Neville Brothers are one of
the two or three finest American bands to
have graced the last quarter of this century,
the responses typically range from blank
looks to hooting derision.
In this 16 track sampler (a real explo
ration of this band and its various offshoots
would easily fill a boxed set), I have my rebut
tal. It's a perfect album.
I'd like to tell you what the Neville Broth
ers "sound" like, but that varies wildly from
song to song. The best answer would be that
they are synthesists of almost every influen
tial form of black music in the pre-rap era:
gospel, soul, funk and reggae all get filtered
through their idiosyncratic bayou sensibility.
The result is instantly danceable, quite often
spiritual and charmingly strange in its
voodoo/bad -ass dialect.
That last aspect is represented on the
two cuts taken from their cult-classic alter
ego "Wild Tchoupitoulas" project (they
claim to be descendants of a now defunct
Louisiana Indian tribe of the same name).
The songs are about — among other things

— drinking panther Mood, wearing feather
headdresses and swimming through swamps,
and they're all set to an insinuating funk. Don't
worry if you don't get it; only New Orleans na
tives do. I'lay them a couple of times and you'll
be singing along.
The rest of the CD is on more familiar ground:
some Motown ballads sung by Aaron (who, in the
right musical context, is a dead ringer for Smok\
Robinson), some reggae, some straight-ahead
rock. They're all wonderful.
The song I find myself coming back to,
though, is the closing track, a live medley of
"Amazing Grace/Down By the Riverside/Amen '
It opens with a loud and energetic crowd clap
ping in time, ready to dance. Something strange
happens, though. Aaron, accompanied only b\ a
distant organ chord, begins to sing that most
simple of hymns, "Amazing Grace." The crowd
instantly hushes. The club is transformed into a
cathedral. And then, having built to a goose pirn
pie crescendo, the band rips into the gospel stan
dard "Down By the Riverside," which they trans
form into a warm blues shuffle.
With their stubborn refusal to follow musical
fads, the Neville Brothers have created a body ot
music that belies its age; it could be 30 years old or
recorded yesterday. Play it loud.

To the naked eye, it appears that the Neville Bros.' style hasn't changed in many,
many years.
