## Prisoner of the Mountains 
### 
Two weeks ago, Phillip W.I). Martin pondered inaNew York
Times piece whether a movie has ever changed the course of
history. After quoting various accredited naysayers, Martin
notes that Sergei Bodrov, the Russian director of "Prisoner of
the Mountains," believes his film factored into Boris Yeltsin's
decision to remove Russian troops from the Republic of Chech
nya.
Such a contention does not seem entirely unlikely, for Bo
drov's movie compellingly and gently points out the absurdities
of war.
Bodrov's portrayal ofVanya (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) and Sacha
(Oleg Menshikov), the two likable protagonists, cultivates an
audience respect and tenderness for these two Russian soldiers
who have been taken captive by a villager, Abdoul-Mourat
(Djemal Sikharulid/.e).
Abdoul — a stoic and laconic yet not unfeeling man —
intends to use his human booty as bargaining chips in ne
gotiations with the Russian military, which has imprisoned
his son. He mistakenly assumes that the military values its
soldiers — Vanya and Sacha — as much as he values his
son.
Unfortunately, it doesn't. Likewise, in the beginning, the two
soldiers don't have any great love for each other. However, dur
ing the weeks that they are chained to each other, a deep, mutu
al affection emerges.
For instance, Sacha, in his characteristically waggish man
ner, tells Vanya that the villagers will cut his balls off. Vanya
naively believes him but tries not to show his fear. Sacha then
asks him if he's had sex yet. Vanya musters up a "yes" which is
obviously a lie. A smirking Sacha sighs in relief: lucky that
Vanya's had sex before they steal the jewels.
The fondness between these two extends to their mute guard

Hasan. Just when the affinity between guard and prisoners be
gins to build, Sacha and his sidekick find out that Hasan cannot
speak because Russian soldiers cut off his tongue.
It then becomes apparent that in different circumstances,
Sacha and Vanya might have been those very soldiers to silence
Hasan forever.
Even more significant is the fact that the soldiers pun
ished Hasan because he loved to sing. The prevalence of
music — from folk to rock, from sorrowful to military — in

this film underscores
the importance of
music to the Russian
people.
For instance, in
an afternoon of drunken
silliness, Vanya and
Sacha sing patriotic sol
diers' songs near the edge
of a cliff. Their songs
promise glory to the sol
dier and proclaim the
importance of the na
tion's cause.
In one of the
film's most poignant
moments, sobs over
come Sacha's robust
voice. While the jingois
tic soldier's song contin
ues at full volume, the
camera focuses on
Sacha's shaking body and
tearful face.

Using just such a potent mixture of humor and emotion, Bo
drov's "Prisoner of the Mountains" effectively illuminates the
needless pain that civil war causes.
One exchange between prisoner and guard sums up the
movie perfectly. "You are a good man Hasan," says Sacha. "Why
don't you let us go?"
The mute man smiles but shakes his head no. The audience
laughs; of course it's not that easy.
