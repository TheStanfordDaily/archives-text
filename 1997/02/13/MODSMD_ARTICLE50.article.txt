# Everyone Says I Love You
## 
### 
Every time a new Woody Allen (lick is released, it seems no one knows the title — they just
say," Have you seen The New Woody Allen Movie?" This isn't really a problem, because he's usu

ally playing the same angst-filled, neurotic mensch who searches un
successfully for love in New York. In "Everyone Says I Love You," the
mensch is back, hut this time he's singing and dancing in a musical
that is nothing short of exuberant.
It seems hard to imagine Woody Allen having this much fun, but
"Everyone Says" is side-splitting hysterical — filled with 1930s-style
numbers and singing movie stars.
Allen does a fabulous job of simultaneously celebrating and ridi
culing the movie musical — the kind of world where characters
shamelessly burst into song mid-sentence. A doctor in a hospital be
gins warbling "Makin' Whoopee" and the next thing you know, pa
tients are throwing off crutches to tap dance, nurses are waltzing
with IV drips and women in labor are capering around atopgurneys.
By not telling the actors that they were going to have to sing until
after they signed on, Allen has clearly gone after a less-than-profes

sional sound here — gimmicky, but it definitely has its moments, such as hearing Tim Roth
as a menacing killer, launch into the syrupy "If I Had You." The singing is surprisingly good;

the only real cringer is the unfortunate Julia Roberts. (Drew Barrymore had her apparently
embarrassing voice dubbed over).

Alan Alda is absolutely hysterical as the patriarch of this
yodeling brood, and he and Goldie Hawn play off each other in
grand comedic style.
Allen connects the lives and events of the characters to
gether through his narrator, Djuna, played by Natasha Lyonne.
Lyonne doesn't seem entirely comfortable on screen but serves to
explain the romantic exploits of her family. She begins her story
with, "We're not the kind of family you find in a musical comedy.
For one thing, we've got dough." (I suppose she never checked out
that gargantuan mansion the Von Trapp kids paraded around in.)
The best thing about "Everyone Says" is the whimsical feel
Allen brings to the songs. A graceful Goldie floats above the Seine,
an awkward Edward Norton shuffles away amid a chorus of expert
tap dancers and a collection of frolicking ghosts proclaims, "Enjoy
Yourself! It's Later than You Think." Allen's neuroses are alive and

well in this film, but he's having a grand time. Hannah and her sisters would be so jealous.
