"La Cercmonie," based on the Ruth Rendell novel, "A Judgment
in Stone," is a seamless, stylish suspense thriller starring Jacqueline
Bisset, Sandrine Bonnaireand Isabelle Huppert.
The film, in French with English subtitles, is set in Brittany,
France. I-ovely, chic Catherine Lelievre (Bisset) hires a woman
named Sophie (Bonnaire) to serve as her maid. En route to the
Lelievres' isolated country estate, Catherine and Sophie encounter
Jeanne (Huppert), the local postmistress, who befriends Sophie.
Jeanne and Sophie arc a study in contrasts — Jeanne is gregari
ous, nosy and insolent, while Sophie is indifferent and secretive.
What they have in common, however, is their resentment of the
bourgeoisie personified by the Lelievre family. As the intimacy be
tween Sophie and Jeanne increases, we wonder to what lengths (or
depths) Sophie is willing to be led by Jeanne's increasingly wild be
havior — as well as whether the friendship between the women bor
ders on the psychotic.

The members of the Lelievre family — which includes Catherine s
husband, Georges (Jean Pierre Cassel), their adolescent son, Gilles,
and her stepdaughter, Melinda — are also peculiar. In one scene they
all sit down in formal attire to watch an opera... on television.
Under the direction of Claude Chabrol, the French master of the
psychological thriller, the tension in the film builds slowly and grace
fully. Part of Chabrol's art is tantalizing the audience; many of the
questions he raises are left only partially answered. Another is his
ability to make small events resonate while muting potentially ex
plosive ones. For instance, in the scene where Sophie and Jeanne
trade dark secrets in their pasts, Chabrol emphasizes the deepening
of their relationship rather than the lurid secrets themselves.
Complex and beautifully crafted, "Li Ceremonie" does not
shout. Instead, it smirks, daring the audience to piece together the
parts of its crazy quilt.
