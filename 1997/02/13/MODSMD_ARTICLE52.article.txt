Quirky. Predictable. Forgettable.
"Hotel de Love," the new romantic come
dy by Australian writer / director Craig
Rosenberg, attempts to amuse audiences
with its frantic pace and love-struck charac
ters. But the only thing this film succeeds in
doing is subjecting you to 96 minutes of
inane romantic pursuits.
The film follows a love triangle and a slew
of other romantic entanglements through
the halls of a sleazy yet .amusing little love
shack. Although it may sound engaging, the
plot is actually quite simplistic and cliched.
The outcome is predictable, and aside from
a few memorable laughs, the film's impact
ends with the credits.
Two fraternal twins, Rick and Stephen
Dunne, fall in love with young beauty Melis
sa Morrison (Saffron Burrows) at a high

school summer party. The suave, handsome
Rick (Aden Young) steals Melissa's heart be
fore his shy and passive brother, Stephen
(Simon Bossell), has the chance to approach
her. Rick and Melissa spend the summer to
gether while Stephen assumes the painful
role of Melissa's best friend, all the while
longing to reveal his true feelings to her.
Ten years later, at the kinky Hotel de
Love, the three are reunited and the compe
tition to win Melissa's heart resumes. Now,
however, there's another player — Melissa's
fiance, Norman. Rick, Stephen and Norman
spend most of the film in a hotel full of ro
mantic lunatics, conjuring up a plan that
will make Melissa fall in love with them.
The acting is marginal. Bossell (Stephen),
takes his boyish insecurities and neurotic
outbursts beyond the comedic tone of the

film and into the world of overacting. His
pathetic attempt at slapstick places him
below the rest of the cast. Burrows (Melissa),
who is best known to American audiences
for her performance in "Circle of Friends,"
gives a sufficient performance along with
her co-star Young (Rick). The two deliver
their lines with clarity and direction but
don't take many risks. The most impressive
dynamic surfaces whenever Ray Barrett and
Julia Blake (Mr. and Mrs. Dunne, the twins'
parents) are on screen. Their roles are small
but engaging, and the couple brings a sense
of compassion to the film.
"Hotel de Love" is not in the same class as
a Ritz-Carlton. In fact, it's not even in the
same class as a Hilton. It's more on par with
the Palo Alto Super 8.
