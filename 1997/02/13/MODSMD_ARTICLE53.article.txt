# Sling Blade
## 
### 
Having trouble sleeping? Valium pre
scription just run out? "Sling Blade" is an al
ternative downer you might want to try. This
bizarre film, written and directed by Billy
Bob Thornton, explores the intricate rela
tionship among justice, religion and preju
dice in the South. Thornton, who also stars in
the film, adds his grotesque sense of humor
to this combination.
Twenty-five years after murdering his
mother and her lover, Karl Childers (Thorn
ton) emerges from an asylum for the crimi
nally insane. In "Rain Man"-like fashion, he
fixes a mean small engine and is hired as a
mechanic's assistant in his small hometown.
Karl immediately befriends young Frank
Wheat ley (Lucas Black) who has experienced
the suicide of his father, intense loneliness as
an only child and the abuse of his mother,
Linda (Natalie Canerday), by her overbear
ing boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight
Yoakam) — all in the span of 10 years.
The plot thickens as Doyle becomes in
creasingly violent with Frank, Linda and
Linda's best friend, Vaughan Cunningham

(John Ritter), who is gay and thus a prime
target for Doyle's rage. Thornton's critical
question of where to draw the line between
right and wrong develops as Karl tries to rec
oncile his growing hostility towards Doyle

with his strict religious upbringing and the
moral reformation he gained in confine
ment.
Although "Sling Blade" boasts a provoca
tive slant on the above-mentioned themes, it

lacks ingenuity in character de
velopment. Thornton throws to
gether a typical bunch of melo
dramatic parts: the mentally dis
abled, the fate-stricken child, the
battered woman, the abusive
boyfriend, the token gay man.
Thornton fails to connect this
hodge-podge of characters into
any real network of relation
ships. (Come on Billy Bob, why
would any gay man in his right
mind flee familial disapproval in
St. Louis only to settle in the
heart of the Bible Belt?)
The whole aura of "Sling
Blade" is haunting, especially
with the expert contribution of
Daniel Lanois' original score.
Unfortunately it seems that
Thornton's attempt to dive deep

into the American psyche in "Sling Blade"
fails to assess the shallowness of the film's
characters.
