## Here's to a very gay Valentine 
### 
The following are a few short re
views of some of the more memorable
queer love stories of late. There are
plenty to choose from, although the
recent 1 iollywood rush to play gay has
a longer history elsewhere. In this col-

umn I ask you to look beyond the Hol
lywood heterosexism to the vibrant,
honest and uncompromising interna
tional queer cinema of the 19905.
Andre Techino s latest, "Les Voleurs"
(" I hieves," 1996), stars the inimitable
Catherine Deneuve and the currently
indispensable Dan Auteil. "Les
Voleurs" is the story of two brothers,
one a cop, the other a crook, whose ha-

tred runs so deep that they constantly
plot against each other. The cop (Auteuil) is
banging an arrogant but delinquent misfit
(Laurence Cote), who is simultaneously hav
ing a lesbian affair with none other than the
queen of French cinema and international
lesbian icon herself, Deneuve.
The spiraling tale uses a complex series of
flashbacks and narrator voice-overs. Here is
true passion and romance between women,

and it shines gloriously against the vacant and
callous love of the other characters.
"Beautiful Thing" (19%) is without a
doubt the most exciting film about gay love in
years. Jonathon Harvey's tale of two high
school neighbors who fall in love meshes the

desperate world of a working-class London
housing project with the many manifestations
of homophobia young gay men encounter.
It is an unusual film in that it features few
overblown cliches of gaydoni and concen
trates on the depth of understanding between
the boys. Very quickly they realize there is
nothing at all wrong or abnormal about their
feelings for each other. The strength and com
mitment they garner brings forth warmth
and understanding from family and friends.
Finally, we have an uncompromisingly posi
tive film about young gay love.
A sexual journey for grownups, "When
Night Is Falling" (1995), stars Pascale
Bussieres as Camille, a teacher at a Christian
college who is engaged to Martin (Henry Cz
erny). Camille falls apart and is comforted in
a launderette by Petra (Rachael Crawford), a
beautiful circus performer with enormous

eyes. The women accidentally switch their
laundry bags, prompting Camille to seek out
the circus tent and deliver the goods to Petra.
Camille enters a thrilling, unknown world
when she crosses that portal to the circus.
When Petra invites Camille to her trailer, she

says, "I'd love to see you in the moon -
light with your head thrown back
and your body on tire." Camille
freezes and leaves. What follows is a

struggle —
not only between het
erosexuality and ho
mosexuality but be
tween obligation and
fulfillment, conven
tion and experiment.
When Martin learns
that his fiancee has
strayed, Camille tells
him simply, "She an
swered a wordless
question in me."
In Gregg Araki's
startlingly brash and
morbid film, "The
Living End" (1992),
two previously un
connected guys, both
diagnosed with HIV,
cross paths. One is

driving furiously up the freeway and the other
is hitchhiking. They don't exactly fall in love.
Instead, their immediate lust and totally un
nerving situation binds them together. This is
a gripping foray into one of the most awkward
dynamics of gay love and longing — the post-
AIDS gay identity. The two try their luck on a
long drive north, and together hate everything
and everyone they come across.
