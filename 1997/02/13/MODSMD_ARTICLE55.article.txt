## Clammy hands and unstable elements 
### Laura Shin 
Eric Wiedlund.
Valentine's Day always conjures up that
name for me. Eric Wiedlund is the boy who
sat next to me in high school chemistry and
accelerated physics — not on purpose, mind
you. My chem and physics teachers (Bill and
Ernie) had no imaginations and seated us al
phabetically.
S for Shin, W for Wiedlund. As destiny
would have it, each year there was just the
right number of people alphabetically in be
tween so that Eric and I were seated next to
each other, like mercury and gold or sulfur
and chlorine on the periodic table.
Kismet, romantics might muse.
The Murphy's Law of alphabetization is
my theory.
On Valentine's Day my junior year (a year
and a half after Eric and I first sat next to each
other), I received a card in the mail. The
handwriting on the envelope looked familiar,

but as I studied it, I couldn't figure out whose
garish, cursive words those could be.
Intrigued, I opened the envelope. I admit
that, then, romance for me was like a uni
corn — pure myth. So the near absence of
romantic interludes in my past exponential
ly magnified my excitement. It's all relative,
no? (Einstein is so applicable to matters of
love.)
As you've probably guessed (and if you
haven't, you need coffee), the card was from
the boy who had been grading my chem and
physics homework.
A brief physical description is necessary.
Eric was skinny, quiet, greasy-haired and
four-eyed (or six, depending on how you
count — he had large bifocals). He had said
barely a few words to me — ever.
The card cover, textured like old photos of
my parents in the seventies, displayed a large
red heart against a black background. The

"poem" (if it can even be called that) on the
inside was equally tacky.
The message, short and awkward, blurted:
"Hello Laura. Do you like movies? If so,
would you like to go to a movie with me? Sin
cerely, Eric Wiedlund."
What was the force behind this? Einstein
once said, "Gravity cannot be held responsi
ble for people falling in love," so at least I
could rule that out.
Even more importantly, how was I going to
react (aside from according to Newton's Law)?
The day after 1 got the card, I played it cool
in physics — pretended no clammy-hand
written card had arrived in the mail for me.
The second day, though, I had to deal with it.
And here it gets ugly.
Dear reader (for some reason, 1 feel pecu
liarly British right now), please withhold
your judgment.
I turned to the scrawny, brainy boy —

hoping he would not be like an unstable ele
ment (chlorine) frenzied to bond to me
(sodium) for my extra electron — and said,
"Eric, thank you so much for the card you
sent me."
Now talk about guilt. At this point, he —
definitely not a noble gas — immediately
turned away from me to rummage through
his bookbag, muttering, "I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry."
I also began apologizing, "I'm sorry, but I
don't think I'll have time to go to a movie."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..
Pathetic, right?
Well, that's the story of the only amorous
ly intended Valentine's Day card I've ever re
ceived.
I still feel guilty about refusing his invita
tion. So I hope wherever you are, Eric Wied
lund, you have a good Valentine's Day. Same
to you, "dear reader."
