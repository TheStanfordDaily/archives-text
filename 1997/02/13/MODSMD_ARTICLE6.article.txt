# Parking room to increase for bikes
## 
### Sheenie Am bardar 
Stanford staff and students who
are used to getting around by bike
can look forward to new and im
proved bike parking facilities this
year. Through the 1997 Bicycle Fa
cilities Plan, $1.2 million is being
channeled towards upgrading the
existing bicycle infrastructure.
Two hundred bike storage en
closures will be built, along with
400 secured bike spaces, new bike
lanes on two streets and outdoor
racks with capacity for 2,000 bikes.
Bicycle Program Manager John
Ciccarelli said that the bike storage
concept is a move away from the
past. "In previous years we focused
on the basics: racks and travel
ways. Now we've learned that the
single biggest obstacle to bike com
muting is theft, so this year we're
building our first secure bike enclo
sures."
The bike enclosures, designed
by the Palo Alto architecture firm
of Cody .Anderson Wasney, will
consist of stairwell closets, free
standing sheds and large cages in
car parking garages.
Designated cyclists will be
charged about $3 a month to use
the facilities, which will go up near
Terman Engineering, Stanford
Hospital, the Beckrnan Center, the
Jordan Quad modulars, Encina
Commons, Ginzton Lab, Polya
Hall, Mayer Cancer Biology Re
search Lab and the Gravity Probe B
Modular.
Ciccarelli said he has gotten a
positive response from the Stan
ford community regarding the en
closure idea. He received numer
ous letters and petitions from de
partment chairs and lab managers
at Beckman requesting the imple
mentation of the proposed addi
tions.
Ciccarelli said the premises
around Beckman and the Medical
Center are particularly susceptible
to bike theft.
The secured bike parking
spaces will be built at the new grad
uate housing developments in
Manzanita Park and Governor's
Corner and will consist of racks in
locked areas.
There will also be a re-striping

of bike lanes on Campus Drive be
tween Serra Street and Palm Drive
and an addition of an uphill-only
bike lane on Lomita Drive across
from Kingscote Gardens.
The 2,000 bicycle rack spaces
being added on campus and near
the Medical Center have several in
teresting features.
"We've designed a new rack
that holds the bike upright and
makes it easy to lock your frame
and wheel to it," said Ciccarelli.
"The new racks also have a ther
moplastic coating, the same mater
ial used for golf balls."
Ciccarelli said the improved fa
cilities are likely to have a palpable
effect on a large portion of the
Stanford population. He noted
that nearly 100 percent of the
7,000 undergraduates on campus
walk or bike to class, and more
than 20 percent of staff and faculty
ride their bikes to work daily.
