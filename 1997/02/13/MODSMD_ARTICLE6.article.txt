# Parking room to increase for bikes
## 
### Sheenie Am bardar 
Stanford staff and students who
are used to getting around by bike
can look forward to new and im
proved bike parking facilities this
year. Through the 1997 Bicycle Fa
cilities Plan, $1.2 million is being
channeled towards upgrading the
existing bicycle infrastructure.
Two hundred bike storage en
closures will be built, along with
400 secured bike spaces, new bike
lanes on two streets and outdoor
racks with capacity for 2,000 bikes.
Bicycle Program Manager John
Ciccarelli said that the bike storage
concept is a move away from the
past. "In previous years we focused
on the basics: racks and travel
ways. Now we've learned that the
single biggest obstacle to bike com
muting is theft, so this year we're
building our first secure bike enclo
sures."
The bike enclosures, designed
by the Palo Alto architecture firm
of Cody .Anderson Wasney, will
consist of stairwell closets, free
standing sheds and large cages in
car parking garages.
Designated cyclists will be
charged about $3 a month to use
the facilities, which will go up near
Terman Engineering, Stanford
Hospital, the Beckrnan Center, the
Jordan Quad modulars, Encina
Commons, Ginzton Lab, Polya
Hall, Mayer Cancer Biology Re
search Lab and the Gravity Probe B
Modular.
