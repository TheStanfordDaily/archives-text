# Fasting, spirituality and community
## Campus Muslims celebrate holy month 
### Julia Beeson 
For the Muslim community at Stanford and
beyond, last Friday marked the end of Ra
madan, the month of abstention from dawn
until dusk from food, drink and sexual from re
lations.
In observance of Ramadan, campus Muslim
students and community members gathered
every evening to pray and eat dinner together.
"For me and many Muslims, it [ Ramadan] is
like the oasis in the middle of the desert. It
gives me my fuel to make it through another
year," said Ali Asadullah, Class of 1993. "I am
able to concentrate more on my faith and focus
on the important things in life."
Islam is one of the fastest growing religions
in this country and around the world, with an
estimated 6 million Muslims in United States
and some 1.2 billion worldwide, according to
the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Founded by the prophet Mohammed in the
7th century, Islam emphasizes uncompromis
ing monotheism and strict adherence to cer
tain religious practices. "Having been aware of

Muslim practice, I knew Islam's stance on
things like drinking and drugs and sex, and
morality in general," Asadullah said. "It
seemed like the cure to my — and societies
ills."
Muslims practice the Five Pillars of Islam:
to recite the profession of faith at least once in
one's lifetime; to observe the five daily public
and collective prayers; to pay the zaAa/(purifi
cation) tax for the support of the poor; to fast
from daybreak to sunset during the entirety of
the month of Ramadan; and to perform — if
physically and financially possible — the hajj,
or pilgrimage, to the holy city of Mecca.
Although there are many striking cultural
and religious differences within the Islamic
world, all followers are bound by a common
faith and a sense of belonging to a single com
munity.
In celebration of Ramadan, sophomore
Frank Primus participated in the fast, which
also allowed him to spend time with other Mus
lims on campus and make new friends.
"Through Ramadan, I have had the oppor
tunity to meet and spend time with people that

I otherwise wouldn't have known," Primus
said.
The most important and fundamental reli
gious concept of Islam is that of the shari 'ah, or
the law, which embraces the total way of life as
explicitly or implicitly commanded by God.
Islam "puts you in a frame of mind in which
you have clarity of vision," Asadullah said.
"The good and the bad become much more ap
parent."
Freshman Emily Card was attracted to
Islam because of the morals she shared with
Muslim doctrine. Before converting to Islam,
Card did not adhere to any specific faith, but
she was impressed by the support and cama
raderie of the Muslim community.
"Here I had finally found a religion which
included the morals I upheld, which served as
an all-encompassing guide and which logically
and spiritually seemed to make sense," Card
said.
Card has found Stanford to be "extremely
conducive" to the practice of her Muslim faith.
"The Muslim brothers and sis
ters at Stanford have supported
and taught me in many ways,"
Card said. "As far as the Univer
sity is concerned, the adminis
tration is supportive of Islamic
society events.
Primus agreed. "Out of most
of the other schools that I consid
ered going to, I am happy to say
that Stanford was the best choice
on a lot of grounds, one being its
Islamic community.
However, Card is critical of
the University because of the
lack of Islamic studies classes.
"It seems to me that a well
rounded student should have the
opportunity to learn about one of
the world's largest faiths," Card
said.
Jamila Saudi, who received
her doctorate from Stanford and
currently works as an office coor
dinator in Florence Moore Hall,
has learned much from her faith.
Ramadan was "a spiritual train
ing program," she said.

Raised as a Christian, Saudi
said, "I was never quite comfort
able with the way that Chris
tianity was introduced to the
African slaves. ... I found that
Islam clarified things for me.
Islam is an African religion, one
that my ancestors was probably
practicing before they were en
slaved."
Saudi said Islam is an exten
sion of her Christianity, one
whose ideas and principles fit
comfortably with her personali
ty. While she believes that Stan
ford is not necessarily open to the
practice of her Muslim faith, she
also feels that it is not obstruc
tive either.
"Most people here are not fa
miliar with Islam, and many are
hostile towards it," Saudi said. "I
feel that they have been taught
by the media that Islam is some
thing to fear."
Though misunderstanding re
mains, campus change has
begun.
"Stanford has been aiming to
ward multiculturalism and ac
ceptance of varying peoples
faiths and creeds in recent
years," Asadullah said.
