# Fasting, spirituality and community
## Campus Muslims celebrate holy month 
### Julia Beeson 
For the Muslim community at Stanford and
beyond, last Friday marked the end of Ra
madan, the month of abstention from dawn
until dusk from food, drink and sexual from re
lations.
In observance of Ramadan, campus Muslim
students and community members gathered
every evening to pray and eat dinner together.
"For me and many Muslims, it [ Ramadan] is
like the oasis in the middle of the desert. It
gives me my fuel to make it through another
year," said Ali Asadullah, Class of 1993. "I am
able to concentrate more on my faith and focus
on the important things in life."
Islam is one of the fastest growing religions
in this country and around the world, with an
estimated 6 million Muslims in United States
and some 1.2 billion worldwide, according to
the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Founded by the prophet Mohammed in the
7th century, Islam emphasizes uncompromis
ing monotheism and strict adherence to cer
tain religious practices. "Having been aware of

Muslim practice, I knew Islam's stance on
things like drinking and drugs and sex, and
morality in general," Asadullah said. "It
seemed like the cure to my — and societies
ills."
Muslims practice the Five Pillars of Islam:
to recite the profession of faith at least once in
one's lifetime; to observe the five daily public
and collective prayers; to pay the zaAa/(purifi
cation) tax for the support of the poor; to fast
from daybreak to sunset during the entirety of
the month of Ramadan; and to perform — if
physically and financially possible — the hajj,
or pilgrimage, to the holy city of Mecca.
Although there are many striking cultural
and religious differences within the Islamic
world, all followers are bound by a common
faith and a sense of belonging to a single com
munity.
In celebration of Ramadan, sophomore
Frank Primus participated in the fast, which
also allowed him to spend time with other Mus
lims on campus and make new friends.
"Through Ramadan, I have had the oppor
tunity to meet and spend time with people that

I otherwise wouldn't have known," Primus
said.
The most important and fundamental reli
gious concept of Islam is that of the shari 'ah, or
the law, which embraces the total way of life as
explicitly or implicitly commanded by God.
Islam "puts you in a frame of mind in which
you have clarity of vision," Asadullah said.
"The good and the bad become much more ap
parent."
Freshman Emily Card was attracted to
Islam because of the morals she shared with
Muslim doctrine. Before converting to Islam,
Card did not adhere to any specific faith, but
she was impressed by the support and cama
raderie of the Muslim community.
"Here I had finally found a religion which
included the morals I upheld, which served as
an all-encompassing guide and which logically
and spiritually seemed to make sense," Card
said.
Card has found Stanford to be "extremely
conducive" to the practice of her Muslim faith.
