# Changes made at Webb Ranch
## Many say although housing has improved, lack of workers' rights is still a problem 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Although living and working conditions
at Webb Ranch have improved in recent
years, changes still need to be made, accord
ing to both the Service Employees Interna
tional Union and several Stanford profes
sors.
"Migrant workers continue to work in
poverty on Stanford land," said Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley, who in 1989 was
part of a drive to petition then-University
President Donald Kennedy to involve the
University in the issue. "Stanford labor poli
cies have never been terribly enlightened."
Webb Ranch is a Universitv-owned, 237-

acre vegetable and berry farm located on
Alpine Road near Interstate 280. Since 1922,
the land has been leased to the Webb Family
by the Stanford Management Co.
In the late 1980s and early 19905, allega
tions surfaced that poor working and living
conditions existed at the site.
In response to these allegations, trailers
from the Stanford campus were relocated to
the site in 1994, and the wages for workers
was raised.
Today, living and working conditions
seem to have improved, according to Tom
Hubbard, the manager of Webb Ranch.
"The housing was redone and is inspected

annually," Hubbard said.
Yet following a contract in 1990
and a renegotiation of the contract
in 1996, workers still do not receive
any insurance benefits (such as
dental insurance) and are worried
about the prospects of small planti
ng seasons — times in which work
ers are often laid-off.
Despite the renegotiated 3-year
contract adopted in the fall of last
year, some people are still question
ing whether the troubling issues at
the ranch have been fully resolved.
"There is a double standard,"
said Manley, referring to the fact

that workers who are associated
with Stanford are paid well below
the Stanford minimum wage. "They
are treated as second-class citizens
and paid second-rate wages."
The policy of Kennedy's admin
istration, like the current policy
under University President Ger
hard Casper, was one of neutrality.
Because the University considers
itself neither a landlord nor an over
seer of activities on the ranch, it has
chosen to remain nonpartisan on
affairs at the site.
"It was an issue between the
union and the Webbs, not the ad
ministration," said English Prof.
Ron Rebholz, who has been highly
active in the issue. However, he be
lieves the University should have
interfered on behalf of the workers.

Manley lambasted the Universi
ty's neutral policy as demonstrat
ing a "horrible, amoral indiffer
ence" toward the plight of the Webb
Ranch workers. Rebholz added that
the University behaved "complete
ly irresponsibly."
In 1991, prompted by both
union and student protest, a con
tract between the union and the
Webb Ranch administration was
negotiated. The contract contained
provisions for better working con
ditions and agreed to the purchase
of eight trailer buildings from the
University to replace the dilapidat
ed housing where the workers lived.
After months of arbitration, the
workers moved into the new trail
ers in 1994.
"Things seem to have im

proved," said Leonie Batkin of the
Stanford Management Company.
The 1996 contract successfully
called for a guarantee of a 40-hour
per week working schedule during
planting season and a 9.5 percent
increase in wages to $5.71.
"There was some improvement,
but it was not terrific," said Rosa
Escomida, a member of the employ
ees union. "There is still some dis
content" among the workers.
Escomida also lamented the lack
of student involvement in the is
sues. "There isn't the same level of
passion and commitment, particu
larly from the Latino community"
at Stanford, she said.
Manley echoed these senti
ments. "Very few care about the
issue," he said.
