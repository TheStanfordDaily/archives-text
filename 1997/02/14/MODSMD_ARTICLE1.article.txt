# Changes made at Webb Ranch
## Many say although housing has improved, lack of workers' rights is still a problem 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Although living and working conditions
at Webb Ranch have improved in recent
years, changes still need to be made, accord
ing to both the Service Employees Interna
tional Union and several Stanford profes
sors.
"Migrant workers continue to work in
poverty on Stanford land," said Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley, who in 1989 was
part of a drive to petition then-University
President Donald Kennedy to involve the
University in the issue. "Stanford labor poli
cies have never been terribly enlightened."
Webb Ranch is a Universitv-owned, 237-

acre vegetable and berry farm located on
Alpine Road near Interstate 280. Since 1922,
the land has been leased to the Webb Family
by the Stanford Management Co.
In the late 1980s and early 19905, allega
tions surfaced that poor working and living
conditions existed at the site.
In response to these allegations, trailers
from the Stanford campus were relocated to
the site in 1994, and the wages for workers
was raised.
Today, living and working conditions
seem to have improved, according to Tom
Hubbard, the manager of Webb Ranch.
"The housing was redone and is inspected
