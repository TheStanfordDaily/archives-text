## N. Korean defects Waits in S. Korea's Beijing consulate 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — China, North
Korea and South Korea maneu
vered frantically yesterday trying
to decide what to do about a high
ranking North Korean — a former
tutor to the country's leader —
who defected to South Korea.
South Korea pressed China to
let them whisk Hwang Jang Yop
immediately out of the country
and find out everything he knows
about North Korea's secretive
government.
North Koreans refused to
believe the defection, insisting
Hwang must have been kidnapped,
and tried to get past Chinese police
protecting the consulate v/here
Hwang asked for asylum.
Chinese officials pleaded for
calm and wondered how they were
going to get out of the explosive
incident between the North, a
long-time ally, and the South, an
important new trading partner.
But there was no way to avoid
the question — Beijing must
decide whether to turn the 72-
year-old party stalwart back to
North Korea or agree to Seoul's
request to let Hwang fulfill his
wish to go to South Korea.
By late yesterday, however, no
negotiations on the issue had
begun, a South Korean official
said.
Hwang, a Central Committee
member of the ruling Workers'
Party and confidant of North
Korean leader Kim Jong 11,
walked into the South Korean
consulate in Beijing and asked for
asylum Wednesday.
"After a long period of agoniz
ing deliberation" Hwang said he
decided to defect to help reconcile
the two Korea rivals and to discuss
with Seoul how "to save our
nation from misery," according to
a statement released by the South
Korean government.
In his three-page statement,
Hwang said his "family and oth
ers will think me crazy," but
added: "Is it the action of sane

people to call each other enemies
and talk of turning the other into
a sea of fire?"
The statement added: "Can we
call people sane when they talk of
having built a utopia for the
workers and the farmers when
the workers and farmers are
starving?"
Two years of floods have devas
tated North Korea's food supply.
This week, the U.N. World Food
Program issued an appeal for
110,000 tons of emergency food aid
for North Korea.
After being challenged by
North Koreans yesterday, Chinese
police widened the security zone
around the South Korean con
sulate, fearing the defector would
be kidnapped.
Up to 10 North Koreans had
tried to enter the building
Wednesday night and others tried
to chase South Korean diplomats
driving home.
Earlier, North Korean officials
expressed disbelief at the news.
"He's a secretary in the Central
Committee. He's worked his
whole life for our country. Now
he's given everything up. That's
why I say it's not possible. I don't
believe it," said one who gave his
Chinese name, Zhao Riqing.
North Korea urged China to
take "appropriate measures" and
threatened unspecified retaliation
if Hwang had been kidnapped.
South Korea responded by putting
its entire 650,000-member mili
tary on higher alert.
Hwang was traveling home
through Beijing from a North
Korean-sponsored international
seminar in Japan when he defected
with Kim Duk Hong, 59, identified
as the president of a North Korean
trading firm in Beijing.
Under a 1978 treaty, China is
required to return any North
Koreans found without visas or
other valid travel documents, but
that presumably would not apply
to Hwang or Kim.
