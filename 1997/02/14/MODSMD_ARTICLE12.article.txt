# Airline rejects offer from pilots
## Clinton says he will not intervene in American's labor- dispute 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
American Airlines rejected a
compromise offer from its
pilots' union yesterday as a hol
iday-weekend strike deadline
approached. The company's
chief executive urged President
Clinton to intervene to avoid a
walkout at the nation's largest
airline.
Testifying on Capitol Hill
yesterday, American Airlines
President Robert Crandall said
Clinton should exercise his
emergency powers to prevent
pilots from striking at 12:01
a.m. tomorrow. Mayors and
some members of Congress
from areas that would be partic
ularly affected also have asked
the president to step in.
Clinton, at a news conference
yesterday afternoon, gave no
indication whether he would
exercise emergency powers to
prevent pilots from striking.
Clinton urged both sides to
"reach out to one another" and
settle their differences.
Although negotiations are
scheduled to continue, both
sides are preparing for a walk
out. The airline canceled most
overseas flights so aircraft
would not be stranded, and the
board of the Allied Pilots Associ
ation planned a teleconference
at the strike deadline.
At this time, American has
canceled tomorrow's flights to
Japan, Central and South Ameri
ca and most of Europe.
At the White House, the
Transportation Department sent
Clinton a report projecting the
strike would cost up to $200 mil
lion each day and could strand
up to 40,000 passengers.
"We hope that that analysis
of economic damage won't need
to be a useful document," said

White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.
Hopes for a settlement rose
early yesterday, when the union
offered to have its pilots accept
lower pay scales for operating
jets on regional routes as long as
the company accepted its other
demands.
But American's parent com
pany says it doesn't want Amer
ican pilots to fly the new jets
that have been proposed for
regional routes. AMR wants its
American Eagle subsidiary, with
lower-paid pilots from another
union, to fly the commuter jets.
"In reality, those jets are going
to be operated as American Eagle
or they are not going to be oper
ated," spokesman A 1 Comeaux
said. "There are costs involved
beyond pilot costs. We have to be
competitive."
American mechanics, flight
attendants and other workers
all have higher salary ranges
than their counterparts at
American Eagle, a conglomerate
of four separate small airlines
funneling $1 billion in traffic to
American Airlines.
The average American Airlines
pilot makes $120,000 a year. The
average American Eagle pilot less
than half as much.
The union wants 3 percent pay
increases each August for the
next three years and a 2 percent
raise on Aug. 31, 2000.
The pilots also want stock
options to buy 7.25 million shares
at below-market cost and they
want to phase out over four years
a lower pay and pension scale for
newly hired pilots that has been
in place since 1983.
The company is offering a 6
percent raise over the life of the
contract and options for three
million shares of stock.
