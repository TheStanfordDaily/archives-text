It's a boy!
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The King of Pop has
an heir.
Michael Jackson became a father early yes
terday when his wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson,
gave birth to a boy.
The whirling dervish of pop music was in the
delivery room for the arrival of the Glove Child —
whose name, weight and length weren't revealed.
Elizabeth Taylor, the child's godmother, had
planned to be there. But she came down with
the flu and couldn't participate, a source told
The Associated Press.
A hospital source confirmed the birth. Rowe
delivered without complications, the source
said, adding: "Everyone's OK and healthy. - '
Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said the Jack
sons, with their newborn, left the hospital at
about 8 a.m., destination unknown.
Tuneup for Hubble Telescope
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - Two
spacewalking astronauts swapped science
instruments on the Hubble Space I elescope
early today, completing the most critical job of
the observatory's billion-mile tuneup.
Steven Smith, perched on the end of space
shuttle Discovery's crane, removed a 7-foot-long
box from Hubble containing a spectrograph.
With partner Mark Lee guiding him, Smith
gently slid in a more powerful instrument that
will search for black holes and study new stars.
The next step for Lee and Smith was to
replace one of Hubble's cameras with an
advanced model that will peer into the infrared
fringes of the universe.
Lee was surprised when the yellow-painted
coating from shuttle handrails rubbed off on his
pressurized gloves. "I wouldn't try to get some
on you," he told Smith.
So eager were Lee and Smith to get started on
their six- to seven-hour spacewalk out in the open
cargo bay that they suited up more than an hour
early yesterday night. But their plans were foiled
when one of Hubbies two solar panels suddenly
flapped back and forth.
As Lee and Smith waited in the depressuriz
ing airlock that leads from the cabin into the
vacuum of space, Hubbies right solar panel
moved from a horizontal position 90 degrees
into a vertical position, then halfway back to
horizontal, all in five seconds.
There appeared to be no damage to either of
the 40-foot, power-generating solar wings, and
both appeared to be steady, the astronauts said.
Is back seat cooler for kids?
WASHINGTON (AP) - Chrysler Corp.
launched a campaign yesterday to convince 30
million kids "it's cool to ride in the back seat" —
away from fast-deploying air bags.
In a video sent to every elementary school in
the nation, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton
dons a pair of dark sunglasses to tell children:
"The back is where it's at."
Air bags deploying at up to 200 mph have saved
more than 1,600 lives, the government estimates.
They also have been blamed for the deaths of 36
children and 20 adults in lower-speed accidents.
