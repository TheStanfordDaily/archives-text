# Family planning funds released by House
## Money will not be withheld from foreign groups that endorse abortion 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In the first
abortion-related confrontation of the
new Congress, the House approved
without abortion restrictions the
release of funds for overseas family
planning programs.
Yesterday's 220-209 vote was a vic
tory for family planning advocates in
their longtime struggle against anti
abortion forces demanding that family
planning aid be denied to groups
involved in abortion-related activities.
After arguments that family plan
ning helps prevent abortions, 44 most
ly moderate Republicans joined 175

Democrats and an independent in vot
ing for the release of $385 million
March 1. The last Congress froze the
money until July 1.
"By giving women the access to
health services they so desperately
need during their childbearing years,
we will help prevent thousands of
maternal deaths," said Rep. Susan
Molinari, a New York Republican.
The decision was hailed by family
planning groups. "The House has lis
tened to the voices of the three-quar
ters of Americans who support the use
of foreign assistance funds for volun

tary family planning in poor coun
tries," said Victoria Markell of Popula
tion Action International.
Foes of abortion had another bill
on the floor yesterday afternoon that
also would release the family plan
ning money but tie it to restoration of
the so-called Mexico City policy in
force during the Reagan and Bush
administrations but revoked by Pres
ident Clinton.
That bill, sponsored by anti-abor
tion champion Rep. Chris Smith, R-
N.J., had almost no chance of success
in the Senate if passed bv the House.

I he Senate is expected to approve
quickly the nonrestrictive bill.
Going beyond a 1973 law barring
direct U.S. funding of abortions over
seas, the Mexico City policy forbids
money from going to family planning
groups that perform or promote
abortions abroad.
Smith contended that without the
Mexico City language, the administra
tion will pour "hundreds of millions of
U.S. taxpayer dollars into organizations
that have made the toppling of pro-life
laws and policies in developing coun
tries their mission and explicit goal."
