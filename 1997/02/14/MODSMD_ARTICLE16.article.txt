# Cases compromised?
## FBI lab errors will affect prosecutions, even in high-profile cases like Unabom 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Justice Department has advised
50 prosecutors, half in state and
local governments, that FBI lab
problems could affect their cases.
And that figure might grow.
Deputy Attorney General Jamie
Gorelick said yesterday.
"In each of the cases . . . there
could be an issue raised by
defense counsel," Gorelick told a
news conference.
"We're just going to have to
see how each court reacts to each
separate fact pattern that's pre
sented" before anyone can say
whet her lab errors will harm the
prosecutions.
But a lawyer for the whistle
blower who first made allega
tions about lab errors said Gore
lick was minimizing the problem
"The figure of 50 is consider
ably understated. We believe
when finished it will be well over
1,000 cases," said Stephen Kohn,
attorney for FBI scientist-agent
Frederic Whitehurst.
Whitehurst, who triggered an
investigation of the lab by the
Justice inspector general, has
charged that parts of the lab are
contaminated, that supervisors
lack adequate scientific training
and that lab reports and testimo
ny have been biased in favor of
prosecutors.
A still-secret draft report by
the inspector general supports
some but not all of his charges,
officials have said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
Gorelick herself suggested the
number of affected prosecutions
could grow after work is complet-

Ed on the dratt report.
"We have, over the course of
this investigation, informed
about 50 prosecutors, about half
of them state or local prosecu
tors, of issues relating to their
cases that they should consider
with regard to their disclosure
obligations," Gorelick said.
"Ongoing review might increase
that number."
Prosecutors are required to
disclose to defense attorneys any
evidence that might clear their
clients.
Three FBI supervisors have
been transferred out of the lab as
a result of the draft report.
Whitehurst was suspended
with pay after refusing to cooper
ate with a separate inquiry into
leaks of his allegations.
Federal prosecutors preparing
for the trial of Timothy McVeigh
for the 1995 Oklahoma City fed
eral building bombing have
replaced one of the transferred
lab supervisors, Dave Williams,
with another expert witness
from the lab as a result of the
draft report.
Earlier this week, federal
prosecutors in Seattle dropped
one count of possessing a
destructive device against a
member of the separatist Free
man group after an FBI lab tech
nician testified that a detonator
had been mistakenly listed in an
FBI report as part of the appara
tus.
The technician testified the
device actually had no detonator
or fuse and was unlikely to deto
nate.
