Courses taught by video
to provide more options
for summer quarter

Earlier this week, it
was reported that the Com
puter Science Department
will begin offering summer cours
es taught entirely by videotape.
Stanford's summer quarter —
quite intentionally not a special
"summer session" but rather a
"quarter" theoretically equal to
those of the regular school year —
is notoriously lacking in course
choices. It's a cyclical process:
Not many students enroll for the
summer, few classes are offered
because few students are
enrolled, and then few students
enroll because few classes are
offered.
The Computer Science Depart
ment is attempting to counteract
that trend by offering "re-runs" of
school-year courses during the
summer to those students inter
ested in taking them. Although the
professor will not be involved in
teaching — in fact, may not even
be on campus — a teaching assis
tant will be available to grade
assignments, answer questions
and take care of other issues that
arise.
It's a good plan, but one that
may well set a dangerous prece
dent.
Students need to take a certain
number of units to complete a
Stanford degree, and they also
need a certain number to fulfill the
requirements of a major. In some
cases, the only times a student can
complete some of those units is
during the summer. Furthermore,
a student may be interested in tak
ing a specific course but unable to
work the time it meets into his or
her schedule during any given
quarter. If some classes are being
videotaped already, it seems
almost cruel not to allow a student

to watch those videotapes for aca
demic credit — particularly if the
student needs the units or is gen
uinely interested in the class but
can only make time for it over the
summer.
And watching the class on tele
vision, while obviously not quite
the same as watching a good lec
turer in person, is not necessarily
a bad thing. Certainly there are
already many students who during
fall, winter and spring quarters
opt not to leave their dormitories
and instead watch SITN-televised
classes from the comfort of their
own beds.
But there is one important dis
tinction between watching a class
live on SITN and watching a class
on tape. Students who prefer the
bathrobe-clad pleasures of watch
ing a class from their dormitory
rooms always have the option of
attending a lecture in person, if
they so desire. More important,
those students can visit the profes
sor during office hours if necessary
and otherwise take individual
advantage of the professor's exper
tise. Students taking summertime,
via-videotape classes will not have
those luxuries.
There is no question that direct
interaction between students and
faculty is beneficial for all; hence
the pride in a low student-faculty
ratio. And while many students
don't take advantage of the oppor
tunity to interact with their pro
fessors, that the opportunity is
there is nonetheless important.
For just more than $20,000 annu
ally (and that's just tuition) stu
dents are entitled to be able to
interact with their instructors.
That's why a move toward
videotaped classes is cause for con
cern. Providing such instruction
merely to augment traditional
options is a worthwhile effort. But
it does not seem impossible that in
the not-too-distant future, as a
cost-cutting measure, some classes
will be offered only on tape. If that
time does come, it will be a sad day
for Stanford.
