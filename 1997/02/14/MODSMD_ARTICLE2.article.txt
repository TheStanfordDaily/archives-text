# Stanford attracts Merit Scholars
## 
### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
Stanford ranked fourth nationally in
attracting freshman National Merit
scholars last year, with 184 enrolling in
the Class of 2000, according to a report
published in the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
The three universities with higher
rankings were Harvard University, the
University of Texas-Austin and Rice
University.
Among schools that attract merit
scholars without offering any merit
based financial scholarships, Stanford

ranked second nationally.
Assoc. Director of Admissions John
Keider said it was only natural that
Stanford would attract so many Nation
al Merit scholars. "Stanford's general
reputation of academic excellence is ap
pealing to exceptional, curious and in
telligent students."
However, Reider pointed out that
since the awards are announced after
application deadlines, Stanford does not
actively recruit National Merit scholars.
The University does mail admission in
formation to National Merit semi final
ists, from which the final pool of award
winners eventually is selected.

Reider emphasized that being a Na
tional Merit semi finalist, which is based
on scores from the Preliminary Scholas
tic Achievement Test, is not as impor
tant as other factors such as essays and
scores on the Scholastic Achievement
Test.
"National Merit scholars are very
common in the application process,"
Reider said. "In my years of working
here, we have never considered a candi
date's PSAT scores. We are much more
interested in other things. For instance,
the SAT is a more difficult and revealing
test, and we give it more weight."
Elaine Detweiler, public infor
mation director for the National
Merit Scholarship Corp., which
controls the awards, also said
Stanford is very attractive to Na
tional Merit scholars. "Stanford
is a nationally renowned academ
ic institution and has much to
offer to intelligent, motivated
students."
She said, however, that the
Co. objects to the rankings pub
lished annually in the chronicle.
"These rankings are based on
data presented in our annual re
port, but the purpose of our orga
nization is not to rank schools,"
she said.
Detweiler said the purpose of
the organization is "to identify
and honor academically capable
students and to encourage them
to pursue a rigorous academic ca
reer."

Rankings such as those pre
sented in the chronicle are not
useful to students in selecting a
college, Detweiler said, because
"choosing a school is a very per
sonal thing, and each person has
to choose what's right for them.
The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion rankings would not be useful
for a student making this deci
sion."
The corporation, based in
Evanston, 111., is a not-for-profit
organization that runs the annu
al academic competition. The
PSAT / National Merit Scholar
ship qualifying test is given every
fall to more than 1 million high
school juniors. About 50,000 of
these students are honored for
their achievements and an addi
tional 15,000 go on to compete
for the actual 6,900 Merit Schol
arship awards, presented during
the spring.
The awards are presented on
the basis of academic achieve
ment, extracurricular activities,
school recommendations and es
says written by the students.
