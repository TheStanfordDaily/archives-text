## Veganism for a healthier body and planet

VEGANISM IS ris
ing at an alarm
ing rate in Ameri
ca. It's time to take action
and mobilize the forces.
Fortunately, veganism is
not a compulsion that
undermines family val
ues. On the contrary,
veganism embodies a

social and political awareness that would
make any mother proud. It's time to take
action, yes, but not to halt the spread of
this increasingly popular lifestyle. It's time
to look at the philosophy behind veganism
and see what it has to offer.
I have been a vegan (pronounced vee
gun) for two years. Prior to that, I was a
vegetarian. What's the difference? Vegetar
ians avoid animal flesh, while vegans avoid
all animal products including eggs and
dairy products. The most common ques
tion I get is, simply: Why? Let me focus on
the three main reasons for going vegan:
health, the environment and animal rights.
Some students turn to vegetarianism
during their college years due to the appeal
of dining-hall meat. While this is a legiti
mate concern, there are many components
of all animal products that we should feel
"sketchy" at best about swallowing. How
about fat and cholesterol? Coronary heart
disease is the leading killer in the United
States, often a result of clogged arteries.
The vegan diet avoids cholesterol responsi

ble for the clogging. Further, in consuming
animal products we ingest traces of hor
mones, antibiotics and pesticides contained
within. Is it any wonder that the American
Cancer Society has recommended severe
cutbacks in our consumption of meat?
High levels of calcium and protein are
also thought to be essential to good health.
But most Americans take in an excess of
their bodies' daily protein needs. Vegans
who consume sufficient calories with a
balanced diet virtually guarantee them
selves adequate protein intake. Consum
ing a non-vegetarian diet can have detri
mental effects on calcium levels as well,
due to calcium's interaction with animal
proteins. In fact, vegetarian and vegan
women are at a significantly lower risk of
developing osteoporosis than meat-eaters.
Eating lower on the food chain con
serves land, energy and water resources.
For instance 80 percent of our country's
corn goes to feed livestock despite the
fact that it takes the energy equivalent to
one gallon of gasoline to produce one
pound of beef, not to mention the '2,500
gallons of water vs. the scant 29 required
to raise one pound of potatoes. Rain
forests are cleared for pasture land, top
soil is lost to livestock-linked erosion and
factory farms are the No. 1 source of non
point pollution in the United States.
There are also animal rights concerns
associated with the all livestock produc
tion. Male laying-chickens are killed.

Male dairy calves are raised for veal. Bat
tery hens are debeaked without anesthe
sia and crammed into wire floor cages
without enough room to sit down.
Despite the tremendous logical rea
sons in favor of veganism, it took me
awhile to make the switch. The reason
rests in the sad fact that the nutrition
industry is just as political as any. I was
indoctrinated with the four food groups
in kindergarten. I turn on the television
and see dairy and beef industry commer
cials even though evidence and common
sense suggests that the benefits of their
products are overrated.
I see significant parallels to the tobac
co industry — which is under fire for
being deceptive about the negative health
consequences of its products. For exam
ple, in the 1970s studies found causal
links between breast cancer and the con
sumption of meat. Yet 25 years later few
people know that vegetarians are 3.8
times less likely to develop breast cancer.
The benefits of veganism extend far
beyond what I have noted, but I want to
emphasize that veganism, at its heart, is
about thinking — thinking about what is
involved in bringing food to your plate. It
is a conscious exercise of my power as a
consumer not to support an industry
that I find appalling.
