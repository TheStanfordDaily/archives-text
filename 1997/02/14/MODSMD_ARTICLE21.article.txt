Urban studies welcomes public service-based learning

THE DAILY'S FEB. 5 editorial
encouraged students interested in a
public service minor to "work with
the Urban Studies Program to develop a
new minor that will allow for public ser
vice credit, while at the same time explor
ing academic issues." As the director of
the Program on Urban Studies, I welcome
the opportunity to work collaboratively
with students seeking academic credit for
public service-based learning.
Having expressed my interest in col
laboration, allow me to clarify some of
the reasons why we do not currently
have an option for a minor that includes
public service-based learning. In launch
ing our option on community organiza
tion within the urban studies major, we
were concerned about how well we could
implement the requirement for Urban
Studies 194, a course in which students
earn units for community service-based

learning. Urban Studies 194 is a required
course in the community organization
option, and it is carefully integrated into
a broader set of academic requirements,
what your editorial referred to as "a larg
er academic backdrop."
In designing Urban Studies 194, the
Program on Urban Studies worked very
closely with the Haas Center for Public
Service. Our main concerns in imple
menting Urban Studies 194 centered on
the following:
(1) How would students prepare them
selves for using a community service
internship as a learning experience that is
on a par with learning that takes place in
more traditional academic courses?
(2) How would the program link stu
dents with internship opportunities in
community service organizations and
monitor the academic quality of the
internships?

After a few years of learning by trial
and error, the program has developed a
system in which students take two
courses, Public Policy 179 A and 1798, to
help them identify a suitable internship
and to structure the community service
based learning experience so that it is
academically meaningful. Standards of
academic quality are maintained by
requiring each student in Urban Studies
194 to have an academic advisor who
sets the requirements for a term paper
and readings which are a part of the
internship experience.
Both the Urban Studies Program and
the Haas Center have worked to ensure
the academic credibility of Urban Stud
ies 194, and the resources available for
that task have been adequate for the
modest numbers of students now in the
community organization option. We
have learned, however, that implement

ing Urban Studies 194 requires a sub
stantial commitment on the parts of
both Urban Studies and the Haas Cen
ter, and it is not clear we would have the
resources to maintain the academic
quality of the course if a large number of
students were involved.
The points you raised in your editori
al about an Urban Studies minor that
features community organization are
points that have been deliberated at
length by the faculty-student Committee
on Urban Studies. Our discussions of
the Urban Studies minor will continue.
If students interested in a public ser
vice minor would like to attend a meet
ing of the Urban Studies Committee
later this quarter, they should contact
the program office in Building 60.
