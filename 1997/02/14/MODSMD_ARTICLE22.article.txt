# Student claims forum coverage wan partisan

In regard to The Daily's coverage of
Tuesday night's ASSU-sponsored forum
and in particular to my brief quotation
therein, I can only respond to the article
with dismay at what I perceive to be an
encroachment of journalistic devices. I am
keenly aware that no piece of journalism,
however scrupulous, can be unmarred by
certain biases, but the article made little
attempt to cover the forum in a circum
spect manner and revealed the slightest
hues of yellow journalism.
The most glaring prejudice in the arti
cle is the conspicuous absence of com
ments from Michael Putnam, ASSIJ direc
tor of special projects, even though he was
the most prepared and ebullient of all the
panelists; my hunch is that the decision
not to present Put nam's angle is yet
another manifestation of The Daily's
overt opposition to the ASSU campaign.

It is also remarkable that the article
chose to repeat the one brief snippet of neg
ativity with which I regarded the forum;
namely, that "the forum was an alarmingly
cursory treatment of these issues."
That's true. I am afraid that Tuesday
night's forum may have served the same
beguiling function as Casper's "Tea and
Cookies" â€” as ruses which give the stu
dents the false security of administrative
intimacy when in fact little occurs beyond
these brief administrative concessions.
Flut what did not get reported was my
great enthusiasm for Tuesday's forum,
whose organizers went to great lengths to
provide a diverse ensemble of viewpoints;
this objective approach is especially valu
able in light of the last few weeks of gross
ly partisan and acrimonious reporting
within The Daily in respect to the ASSU's
campaign, reportage which has convinced
me that this publication may not be able
to provide a forum for the liberal discus
sion which these topics deserve.
