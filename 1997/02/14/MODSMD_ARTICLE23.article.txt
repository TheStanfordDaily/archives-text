# Recent ROTC column was a 'slap in the face'
## 
### 
I read Jesse Oxfeld's Tuesday column
on ROTC with shock, disappointment and
disgust. Even more so, I am ashamed that
an educated Stanford student who is self
proclaimed as "to the left" could espouse
such insulting garbage.
I agree that the Solomon amendment
to the 1996 Defense appropriations bill
(restricting federal dollars from universi
ties that have an anti-ROTC policy) was
ill-conceived. However, Oxfeld took the
argument to a pitiful low.
The last thing the hard-working mem
bers of our armed forces need to hear
from a limousine liberal like Oxfeld is that
they aren't welcome. To me they nren't
just welcome, they are a necessity. And I
thank them for their dedication not only
to our country, but to you and me. I don't
know what sort of fantasy land Oxfeld
lives in, but the last time I checked the

world wasn't entirely peaceful and nation
al security still mattered.
The ugliest part of Oxfeld's column
was its unwarranted slap in the face to
our nation's veterans. I hope Oxfeld's
claim that he would head for the Canadi
an border during a national emergency
was a bad joke. If it wasn't, I think he
should think about leaving early.
As someone who considers himself also
"to the left," I want to apologize on behalf
of Oxfeld's overblown ego. He has single
handedly misrepresented a population
that is truly grateful to the brave Ameri
cans who are committed to defending our
national interests.
