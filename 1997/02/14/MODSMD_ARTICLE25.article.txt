## Men's hoops skins Beavers; women escape with win Dismal shooting, injuries plague team in ugly win

CORVALLIS - What is it
about playing at Oregon State?
The third-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team (24-1,
12-0 Pacific 10 Conference) went
into the Cardinal's little shop of
horrors and played arguably its
most listless game of the season
before 1,441 in Gill Coliseum. The
team pulled away with a lackluster
79-67 victory over the Beavers
(10-11,4-8).
On the positive side, senior for
ward Kate Starbird surpassed the
hallowed 2,000-point barrier as
she led the Cardinal with 27
points. Junior center Olympia
Scott made the most out of her
minutes, outclassing Beaver coun
terpart Kris Walsh with 23 points
and 11 rebounds.
"We never really got going on
the things we like to do," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Oregon State did a good
job in slowing the tempo and tak
ing away a lot of our transition.
We had a good lead, but we just
didn't build on it."
Indeed, the game started slowly
and only got slower. The Beavers
forced Stanford into a halfcourt
game and was very effective at
doing so. With only one real viable
option down low and an off-night
for the perimeter game, the Cardi
nal was not able to get any sort of
a substantial lead. In fact, OSU
was able to catch Stanford at 21 on
a layup by senior center Tina
with 8 minutes, 12 seconds to go in
the first half. From there it turned
into the Scott and Starbird show,
as the two players alternated bas
kets for a 36-33 lead.
Among those was the milestone
basket at the 5:11 mark — played
out as Starbird scoring like she so
often does, calmly swishing a 12-
foot baseline jumper off an
inbounds pass from junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard.
There were few clean baskets
beyond that as Stanford shot an
abysmal 32 percent from the field,
including 1-of-ll from three-point
land, to stagger to a 35-27 halftime
lead. Oregon State was not exactly
flawless, either, committing 17
turnovers. They were kept in the
game by junior guard Nicole McAl

lister, who had 10 points, includ
ing two threes.
"I think it was a very mediocre
effort," said senior point guard
Jamila Wideman. "You can't come
out and shoot 35 percent from the
field in the first half."
Stanford opened the second
half with an 11-4 run in the first
five minutes to go up 46-31. It
looked like the Cardinal were on
the way until they almost shot
themselves out of it. Stanford
would never shake out of its shoot
ing doldrums as the Beavers made
several ragged runs in the final 11
minutes of the game. It was 50-42
before Starbird temporarily
restored order with two treys and a
layup.
"Kate had some very big bas
kets for us," VanDerveer said.
"She hit some big threes."
A layup by junior forward Seli
na Scoble made it 65-59 with less
than five minutes to go, but Scott
was left alone down low and then
she nailed two big free throws,
which was becoming something of
a rarity. Not only was the Cardinal
struggling from the floor, but it
also missed 11 of 18 from the char
ity stripe up to that point. Stanford
snapped out of it in time to hit
eight straight, six by Wideman,
and nail down the victory.
With the Cardinal shooting 35
percent from the floor for the
game (their worst shooting night
since the USF game in December),
it was obvious that Stanford
missed the services of junior for
wards Naomi Mulitauaopele and
Heather Owen. However, Van-
Derveer saw more to the problems
than just injuries.
"I think we really have to evalu
ate our halfcourt game," Van-
Derveer said. "We were really suc
cessful with Omi and Heather in
there. We need more than Olympia
on that block. Dealing with the
injury situation is hard. But I just
would describe it as a game with
out energy. It was one of those
games where people were kind of
going through the motions. That's
how I felt in watching it."
