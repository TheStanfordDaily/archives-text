CORVALLIS - What is it
about playing at Oregon State?
The third-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team (24-1,
12-0 Pacific 10 Conference) went
into the Cardinal's little shop of
horrors and played arguably its
most listless game of the season
before 1,441 in Gill Coliseum. The
team pulled away with a lackluster
79-67 victory over the Beavers
(10-11,4-8).
On the positive side, senior for
ward Kate Starbird surpassed the
hallowed 2,000-point barrier as
she led the Cardinal with 27
points. Junior center Olympia
Scott made the most out of her
minutes, outclassing Beaver coun
terpart Kris Walsh with 23 points
and 11 rebounds.
"We never really got going on
the things we like to do," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Oregon State did a good
job in slowing the tempo and tak
ing away a lot of our transition.
We had a good lead, but we just
didn't build on it."
Indeed, the game started slowly
and only got slower. The Beavers
forced Stanford into a halfcourt
game and was very effective at
doing so. With only one real viable
option down low and an off-night
for the perimeter game, the Cardi
nal was not able to get any sort of
a substantial lead. In fact, OSU
was able to catch Stanford at 21 on
a layup by senior center Tina
with 8 minutes, 12 seconds to go in
the first half. From there it turned
into the Scott and Starbird show,
as the two players alternated bas
kets for a 36-33 lead.
Among those was the milestone
basket at the 5:11 mark — played
out as Starbird scoring like she so
often does, calmly swishing a 12-
foot baseline jumper off an
inbounds pass from junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard.
There were few clean baskets
beyond that as Stanford shot an
abysmal 32 percent from the field,
including 1-of-ll from three-point
land, to stagger to a 35-27 halftime
lead. Oregon State was not exactly
flawless, either, committing 17
turnovers. They were kept in the
game by junior guard Nicole McAl
