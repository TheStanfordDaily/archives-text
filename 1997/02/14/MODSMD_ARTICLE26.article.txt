# Team avoids repeat of upset in Corvallis
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
There would be no high-flying Corey
Benjamin dunks on this night, no public
address announcer yelling, "Beavers win!
Beavers win!" with the game still in
progress, no ecstatic Oregon State fans
storming the court at game's end.
Well, OK — maybe one high-flying Corey
Benjamin dunk. But aside from that, last
night's Stanford-Oregon State game at
Maples Pavilion bore little, if any resem
blance to the Beavers' 86-77 upset win last
month in Corvallis. Shrugging off a sluggish
first-half start, No. 22 Stanford used a 28-6
run at the start of the second-half to blow
the game open and then cruised to a 87-54
victory before a announced crowd of 5,882.
"We watched the tape (of last month's
game) again today," said sophomore guard
Kris Weems. "Seeing it the second or third
time, it was pretty embarrassing — just to
see guys jumping up and shooting in your
face and pretty much just dominating you
on the court, without us having any emo
tion or any fire. So it was definitely payback
time."
Weems appears to have recovered from a
shooting slump that has plagued him for

much of the conference season, finishing
with a game-hjgh 17 points, including 3-of-4
from three-point range. But this was a total
team victory, with the Stanford bench con
tributing 43 points and 27 rebounds. As a
team the Cardinal out-rebounded Oregon
State 43-23 and limited the Beavers to 39-
percent shooting.
"I knew Stanford would be on a mis
sion," said Oregon State Coach Eddie
Payne. "In the second half, Stanford really
took it to us. They manhandled us, pushed
us, beat us — just physically moved us
around too much. A 20-rebound differential
points to that.
"There's not a whole lot to ask about the
game. They just kicked our fannies."
Benjamin, the hot-shot freshman who
rang up 26 points in the Beavers' upset win
over the Cardinal on Jan. 18, had a jaw
dropping alley-oop jam to highlight an oth
erwise uneventful first half. Both teams
looked sluggish early, shooting a combined
37 percent in the first half. Oregon State
still led 18-17 with 5:18 remaining in the
half, but Stanford closed out the half with a
10-3 spurt to go ahead 29-21 heading into
the locker room.
The Cardinal built on that
momentum at the start of the sec
ond half, opening with a 28-6 run
that obliterated any and all hopes
of a Beaver upset. By the time
sophomore Mark Seaton threw
down one of his trademark two
handed dunks with 8:28 remaining
— he would have two more by
night's end — the game's outcome
was a foregone conclusion.
Other second-half highlights
included a three-pointer by junior
forward Pete Van Elswyck, the
first of his career, and a jawing
match between mild-mannered
sophomore Tim Young and Oregon
State's Terrill Woods (6-foot-6,
280) that led to a double technical
foul.
Young, who has been struggling
of late, had another quiet night,
totaling just two points and one
rebound while being limited to 13
minutes of action.
"His back's bothering him. He's
hurting a little bit both physically

and mentally," Montgomery said.
"We were going to try to rest him
as much as we could. It's a little bit
of an adjustment for him, rather
than being the focal point, and I
think probably that helped us.
Rather than throwing the ball to
Tim and expecting something to
happen, once we didn't have that,
guys were moving and [passing the
ball]."
More than anything, Stanford
needed this victory to gets its confi
dence back following a three-game
losing streak that dropped the Car
dinal to 6-5 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play, two games back of first
place UCLA and USC. With the
win, Stanford improves to 7-5 in
conference play (14-6 overall)
heading into tomorrow night's
7:30 game against Oregon (14-7, 5-
7 Pac-10). Last-place Oregon State,
meanwhile, drops to 2-10 (6-15
overall).
"This was a game we needed
at this point in time," Mont
gomery said, "and so we'll see if
we can build on this a little bit,
get a little bit more confidence,
and feel like we can get back in
this thing."
