# Team avoids repeat of upset in Corvallis
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
There would be no high-flying Corey
Benjamin dunks on this night, no public
address announcer yelling, "Beavers win!
Beavers win!" with the game still in
progress, no ecstatic Oregon State fans
storming the court at game's end.
Well, OK — maybe one high-flying Corey
Benjamin dunk. But aside from that, last
night's Stanford-Oregon State game at
Maples Pavilion bore little, if any resem
blance to the Beavers' 86-77 upset win last
month in Corvallis. Shrugging off a sluggish
first-half start, No. 22 Stanford used a 28-6
run at the start of the second-half to blow
the game open and then cruised to a 87-54
victory before a announced crowd of 5,882.
"We watched the tape (of last month's
game) again today," said sophomore guard
Kris Weems. "Seeing it the second or third
time, it was pretty embarrassing — just to
see guys jumping up and shooting in your
face and pretty much just dominating you
on the court, without us having any emo
tion or any fire. So it was definitely payback
time."
Weems appears to have recovered from a
shooting slump that has plagued him for

much of the conference season, finishing
with a game-hjgh 17 points, including 3-of-4
from three-point range. But this was a total
team victory, with the Stanford bench con
tributing 43 points and 27 rebounds. As a
team the Cardinal out-rebounded Oregon
State 43-23 and limited the Beavers to 39-
percent shooting.
"I knew Stanford would be on a mis
sion," said Oregon State Coach Eddie
Payne. "In the second half, Stanford really
took it to us. They manhandled us, pushed
us, beat us — just physically moved us
around too much. A 20-rebound differential
points to that.
"There's not a whole lot to ask about the
game. They just kicked our fannies."
Benjamin, the hot-shot freshman who
rang up 26 points in the Beavers' upset win
over the Cardinal on Jan. 18, had a jaw
dropping alley-oop jam to highlight an oth
erwise uneventful first half. Both teams
looked sluggish early, shooting a combined
37 percent in the first half. Oregon State
still led 18-17 with 5:18 remaining in the
half, but Stanford closed out the half with a
10-3 spurt to go ahead 29-21 heading into
the locker room.
