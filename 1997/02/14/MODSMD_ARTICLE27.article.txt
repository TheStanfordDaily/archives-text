# Surprising bench key as reserves carry Card
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The ailing 22nd-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team (14-6 overall, 7-5
Pacific 10 Conference), losers of three in
a row entering last night's contest
against Oregon State, found tonic from a
very unexpected source.
It didn't exactly come from All-Ameri
can senior point guard Brevin Knight,
who still did put together a routinely
dominating 10-point, 11-assist perfor
mance. Nor did sophomore center Tim
Young, logging just 13 minutes of play
ing time due to a bothersome back, sup
ply the cure for the Cardinal's recent
woes.
Instead, this roundball elixir of vitali
ty, which propelled Stanford to an
impressive 87-54 victory, came from per
haps the least likely of sources: the Car
dinal bench. It took Stanford nearly an
entire half to right what was quickly
becoming a sinking ship, but head coach
Mike Montgomery found the answer, or
answers as the case may be, sitting right
next to him on the sideline.
"There was a little bit of the residual
from not playing as well, but we got
tremendous contribution off the bench,'
Montgomery said. "We brought ir
(senior forward] Rich Jackson, and he
gave us some energy, got a board and gol
us a loose ball. [Junior forward] Pete Var
Elswyk got off the bench, came in and got

some rebounds. |Freshman guard] David
Moseley came in and made a play. And
that's all we needed to do."
While it may be premature to define a
play as a turning point in the season,
Moseley's shot late in the first half was
at the very least a turning point in the
ball game. Ahead by only two points with
2:10 left in the first half, Stanford found
itself mired in mediocrity, trailing for
most of the opening period and unable to
mount much of an offense.
Moseley found himself open behind
the three-point arc and sunk the trey,
while at the same time drawing the foul
from Beaver guard Ron Grady. After
sinking the ensuing free throw, Moseley
not only put Stanford up for good but
invigorated the Cardinal and showed the
starters how it was done.
"Our bench guys are the explanation"
for the first-half turnaround, Knight ,
said "We weren't out there hustling We *
weren't knocking down shots, and then
our bench guys came in and just put
forth maximum effort showing us that if
we did the same, we would get the same
results as they did. So the second half,
our starters came out and worked hard
right from the beginning to build up the
lead, and then the game went as it went."
Before the 58-point second-half out
burst, Stanford showed little but lethar
gy in the first half, totaling an anemic 29
points and converting a paltry
36.7 percent of its field goals, the
Cardinal bench provided kept
the offense going with 18 points
and 7-of-13 shooting from the
floor. For the entire game, the
reserves scored 43 points, just
falling short of the starters'

offensive output of 44 points.
Sophomore center Mark
Seaton led all backups with 10
points and six rebounds followed
by Moseley's nine points. Jackson
also scored nine points to go along
with five boards. Van Elswyk,
who also chipped in with five car
oms and five points, played a key
role early in the contest battling
for loose balls and sparking his
Cardinal teammates.
"Van Elswyk, early on, was

going after the ball with aggres
siveness and trying to get the
ball and keeping the ball alive
and allowing other people to get
it and creating some opportuni
ties for us," Montgomery said.
"Rich Jackson went in and got
some rebounds, same thing."
With much pressure these
days put on Knight to carry the
team and with Young struggling
both mentally and physically,
the Cardinal bench's perfor

mance was welcome relief for
team searching for more
options.
"I thought they were playing
well," Montgomery said. "That's
part of my responsibility — to
give some other guys a chance if
certain guys are not playing real
well and making plays. Maybe
get a different look. Maybe the
ball's being moved more. Maybe
you get more active. It was guys
just playing hard."
