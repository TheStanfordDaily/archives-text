# Battle with Brigham Young
## Spikers clash with Cougars 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team faces what
may be its toughest match of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation schedule tonight

in Provo, Utah.
The Cougars of Brigham Young,
Stanford's competition, have been
highly touted as one of the nation's
top volleyball teams. And they have
proven through strong play that the
ranking is more than hype.
BYU enters the match with a 5-1
overall record (3-1 in the MPSF) and
a No. 3 ranking nationally. Knowing
this, the Cardinal — which has an
identical record but retains its top
rank despite losing last week to USC

BYU is one of the
few teams in the
country who ...
has a real shot at
the NCAA title'
— Ruben Nieves

— knows it will need to have its best
match of the season to escape with a victory.
"BYU is a great team," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We saw how good they can be when
they won the Santa Barbara tournament before the

season started. They crushed a great Hawaii team in
three games and are one of the few teams in the
country who, along with us, have a real shot at the
NCAA title."
The Cougars, much like Stanford, lead with dom
inating front-court play by mid

die blockers and outside hitters.
Foremost amongst these players
is sophomore middle blocker
Ryan Millar, who was widely
praised last year and won MPSF
freshman of the year honors. In
addition to Millar, sophomore
outside hitter Ozzie Antonetti
may be looking to cause trouble
for the Cardinal.
Millar will be "a real chal
lenge" for senior outside hitter
Mike Lambert, said Nieves. "He

is one of the players in the league
who is competing against Mike for league player of
the year as well as national player of the year.
"Antonetti is also a great
player," Nieves added. "He came
to Burnham Pavilion last year
and had a great match against
us."
Millar and Antonetti, who
combined for 29 kills while hit
ting over .500 in BYU's last
match against Loyola Mary
mount, are a formidable two
some. But BYU may be without
its other top player, outside hitter
Steve Hinds. The absence of
Hinds, who has hit .400 over
three matches this year, should
make it somewhat easier for the
Cardinal to focus on Millar and
Antonetti.
"Even though we won't know
until game time whether Hinds
will play or not, there are rumors
he is out for the year," said
Nieves. "We have been preparing
for BYU as though he will not
play. He will be a real loss to
them, much like Brian Moore was
to us. I do believe they have the
talent at outside hitter to fill the
hole his loss creates, but whoever
steps in will have to respond
well."
Even if the Cardinal do not
have to contend with Hinds'
ferocious play, the team will be
forced to deal with yet another
difficult home-court environ
ment. In BYU's only home con
ference match of the season, a
three-game trouncing of the
Rainbows of Hawaii, 4,669 rabid
Cougar supporters showed up.
Only in volleyball-crazy Hawaii,
where the Rainbows are the
biggest show in town, do more
people show up to watch colle
giate volleyball.
"It will be a great atmosphere to
play in," said Nieves. "We're going
to have to be ready to deal with a
great team and a really loud, hos
tile, big crowd. They know that
they may move to No. 1 if they beat
us. It should be a great match."
