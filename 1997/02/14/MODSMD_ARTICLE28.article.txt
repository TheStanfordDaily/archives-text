# Battle with Brigham Young
## Spikers clash with Cougars 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team faces what
may be its toughest match of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation schedule tonight

in Provo, Utah.
The Cougars of Brigham Young,
Stanford's competition, have been
highly touted as one of the nation's
top volleyball teams. And they have
proven through strong play that the
ranking is more than hype.
BYU enters the match with a 5-1
overall record (3-1 in the MPSF) and
a No. 3 ranking nationally. Knowing
this, the Cardinal — which has an
identical record but retains its top
rank despite losing last week to USC

BYU is one of the
few teams in the
country who ...
has a real shot at
the NCAA title'
— Ruben Nieves

— knows it will need to have its best
match of the season to escape with a victory.
"BYU is a great team," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We saw how good they can be when
they won the Santa Barbara tournament before the

season started. They crushed a great Hawaii team in
three games and are one of the few teams in the
country who, along with us, have a real shot at the
NCAA title."
The Cougars, much like Stanford, lead with dom
inating front-court play by mid

die blockers and outside hitters.
Foremost amongst these players
is sophomore middle blocker
Ryan Millar, who was widely
praised last year and won MPSF
freshman of the year honors. In
addition to Millar, sophomore
outside hitter Ozzie Antonetti
may be looking to cause trouble
for the Cardinal.
Millar will be "a real chal
lenge" for senior outside hitter
Mike Lambert, said Nieves. "He

is one of the players in the league
who is competing against Mike for league player of
the year as well as national player of the year.
