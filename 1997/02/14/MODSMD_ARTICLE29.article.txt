The softball team continued its excellent play wit h
two impressive wins, 8-0, 7-1, against St. Mary s on
Wednesday.
Dominating pitching performances by sophomores
Becky Blevins and Marcy Crouch gave the squad two
victories, as well as momentum for this weekend's
series at Stanford against Pacific and second-ranked
UCIA
A no-hitter thrown by Blevins highlighted the
team's first game against St. Mary's. Blevm struck out
four and allowed only four batters to reach base, three
of them on walks. . ,
"Becky's l)een doing a great job," said Blevins'
teammate, sophomore designated hitter Michelle
Acosta. "Her work ethic is amazing, and it is really
paying off."
The squad's offensive performance consisted of a
solid team effort, with seven players getting at least
one hit. Senior third baseman Amanda Renteria went
three for four, and Acosta and sophomore center field
er Kelly Yablonski had two hits each. Junior left field
er Dawn Kobata recorded Stanford's only extra base

hit of the game, a double.
The Cardinal's domination led to the game being
called afler sue innings due to the mercy rule.
In the second game, Crouch limited the Gaels to
one run and two hits. Despite a little inconsistency,
she was overpowering, recording six strikeouts and six
walks.
The offensive shellacking that the team handed to
Cal State-Fullerton last weekend and St. Man 'sin the
first game continued into the second half of the dou
bleheader, as the team scored seven runs on nine hits,
highlighted by four consecutive doubles in the second
inning.
"Two back-to-back doubles was exciting, and it was
a great spark," Acosta said.
Kobata continued her exceptional hitting, record
ing another double and going three for four in the
game. Kobata has been on fire recently, hatting .625
during the team's first six games.
Acosta also had a strong outing at the plate, goinp
two for three. After six games, she is hitting .400
Seven Stanford players have averages above .300.
The game was called by the umpire after six
innings because of darkness. Because five innings
had already been played and Stanford was so far
ahead, however, the Cardinal was awarded the
victory.
With junior pitcher Jessica Schulman injured, the
Cardinal's pitching staff has consisted of a two-per
son rotation between Blevin and Crouch. The two
hurlers are definitely rising to the occasion, each hav
ing thrown three complete games en route to identi
cal 2-1 records. Their ERAs have been equally
impressive, with Crouch at 2.47 and Blevins at 2.58.
The team will be helped by a home-field advan
tage, as Softball inaugurates its new field. All home
games had previously been played in a location more
than 30 minutes away.
