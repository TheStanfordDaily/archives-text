After leading the Stanford Cardinal to
a national championship this year, junior
volleyball star Kristin Folkl will return to
the third-ranked Stanford basketball
team, The Daily learned late last night.
"I told [Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer] I will be in the gym on Sunday,"
Folkl said in a phone interview last night.
The 6-foot-2 St. Louis native joins the
team as a redshirt sophomore forward for
the final five regular season games and as
many as six postseason contests.
She is no stranger to the tutelage of
VanDerveer. Folkl played basketball and
volleyball as a freshman, garnering hon
ors in both sports. She was an All-Ameri
can and national freshman of the year for
the Cardinal spikers in 1994, a team that
went all the way.
As a forward, she averaged 9.5 points
and a team-high 5.5 rebounds per game in
24 appearances while shooting 56.2 per
cent from the floor, sixth-best in Stanford
history. The basketball team returned to
the Final Four for the first time in three
years, and she had a phenomenal NCAA
tournament, raising her averages to 16.0
points and 8.4 rebounds, both best on the
squad. Folkl capped off that season by
earning a spot on the Pacific 10 Confer
ence all-freshman team.
After taking a year off to play on the
U.S. Olympic volleyball team as the first
alternate, Folkl announced last October
that she was going to focus solely on her
volleyball duties and studies. Neverthe
less, she was named in several publica
tions as a preseason basketball All-Amer
ican.
As the 1996-97 basketball season has

progressed, the highly regarded Cardinal
basketball team has accumulated in
juries, most notably with post players.
Junior forwards Naomi Mulitauaopele,
Heather Owen and Vanessa Nygaard
have missed significant amounts of the
season.
The problem hit its boiling point prior
to the team leaving Wednesday for this
weekend's games against the Oregon
schools, when Owen broke her right
pinkie and did not make the trip, leaving
junior center Olympia Scott as the only
viable post option. According to Folkl,
VanDerveer tried to phone her twice, but
she was not available on both occasions.
But this was not the first time they had
been in contact.
"I had always kept the communication
lines open," Folkl said. "But coming back
was never seriously discussed."
Folkl finally touched base with Van-
Derveer yesterday morning in Eugene
and the issue of returning was laid out to
her.
"They called me and said, 'You know
the situation,' " Folkl said. "It's just me
lending a hand for the team. My role is
I'm here because they need another body,
and it would be beneficial to have me on
the team to grab a rebound here and there
and work the players hard in practice."
The final details were ironed out late
last night with VanDerveer, Folkl said.
But the two-sport star said she was also
willing to come back for other reasons.
"If I didn't miss basketball, the desire
wouldn't be there," Folkl said.
However, she also cautions that she
has not played organized basketball since
April 1995 outside of pickup and intra-
