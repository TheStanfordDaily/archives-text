### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's gym
nastics team is headed to Berke
ley for a dual meet against the
Bears tonight.
Coach Lisa Izzi said she sus
pects California will present its
best lineup, as it has in the past
when faced with the Cardinal.
"I know how good they are
from last year, and I know
they've got some good fresh
men," Izzi said. "We have to real
ly bo psyched; we have to really
want it."
The Stanford team last year
defeated California at both the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
Regionals but suffered a loss in a
dual match held on the Bears'
home court.
This year's Stanford team,
which has consistently improved
with each meet, is as ready as
ever to meet the Bears' challenge,
however. According to sopho
more co-captain Amy Murakami,
the Bears don't stand a chance
with the Card.
"We expect good competition
from them, and they are a good
team," Murakami said. "But
they're going to lose — we really
want to beat the Weenies. We're
going to win the dual meet this
time."
In high spirits after setting a
team seasonal record of 195.38
points at last weekend's meet,
the Cardinal promise to give the
Bears a formidable challenge.
Sophomore Tracey Kohl, who
scored an amazing 9.9 and 9.85
on the floor last weekend, was
careful to note that the Stanford
gymnasts remain focused on
improving specific points and ful
filling larger goals.

full potential. Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick, whose
polished performance on the floor swept the crowd
off its feet last weekend, said the squad needs to focus
on overcoming some weak points that have surfaced.
"We need to work on cleaning up form," Fitz
patrick said. "We need to be sticking the landings
more — we need to keep our progress going."
Fitzpatrick added that the Card lost a full point in
the last meet by taking steps on landings. If the gym
nasts can improve this, they may break last week's
record.
The Cardinal lineup will undergo some changes
for the meet tonight.
Freshman Tara LaMarte, who Izzi said has shown
consistent determination and performance in the
gym, will take Kohl's place on the bars.
Freshman rookie Fontaine — out with an
injured ankle — returns for the floor exercise compe
tition.
Fontaine's participation on the floor means the
Card will have three gymnasts competing in the all
around category; Fontaine will join co-captains
junior Keri Monahan and Murakami on their quest
to sweep the Bears by conquering all event titles.
According to Izzi, although the crowd at Berkeley
may be somewhat rowdy, nothing should disturb the
Stanford team too much.
"I am pretty sure of our ability to stay focused no
matter what environment," Izzi said.
