The Cardinal women's gym
nastics team is headed to Berke
ley for a dual meet against the
Bears tonight.
Coach Lisa Izzi said she sus

best lineup, as it has in the past
when faced with the Cardinal.
"I know how good they are
from last year, and I know
they've got some good fresh
men," Izzi said. "We have to real

want it."
The Stanford team last year
defeated California at both the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
Regionals but suffered a loss in a
dual match held on the Bears'
home court.
This year's Stanford team,
which has consistently improved
with each meet, is as ready as
ever to meet the Bears' challenge,
however. According to sopho
more co-captain Amy Murakami,
the Bears don't stand a chance
with the Card.
"We expect good competition
from them, and they are a good
team," Murakami said. "But
they're going to lose — we really
want to beat the Weenies. We're
going to win the dual meet this
time."
In high spirits after setting a
team seasonal record of 195.38
points at last weekend's meet,
the Cardinal promise to give the
Bears a formidable challenge.
Sophomore Tracey Kohl, who
scored an amazing 9.9 and 9.85
on the floor last weekend, was

gymnasts remain focused on
improving specific points and ful
filling larger goals.
