# Swimming ends with Cal
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's swim
ming and diving team travels to
Berkeley today to take on the
Golden Bears of California in its
final tuneup before the Pacific 10
Conference championships in two
weeks.
The squad is fresh off impres
sive victories last weekend in
Austin, Texas, over second-ranked
Southern Methodist and seventh
ranked Texas. Those dual meets,
according to Cardinal head coach
Richard Quick, gave the squad the
confidence it needs to win its
sixth-straight NCAA champi
onship this March in Indianapolis.
"The second day of that two
day meet was the best I have ever
felt about a team during the dual
meet season," Quick said of the
Texas trip. "On the first day we
couldn't get win an event because
we were coming off our most
intense week of training and we
were tired.
"But we had a team meeting
and talked things over and on Sat
urday, this team came out and
competed as well as any team in
the dual-meet season that I have
ever been associated with."
On that second dav, manv of

the Stanford swimmers posted
career or season-best times, and
the Cardinal overcame a seven
point deficit to beat SMU 200-172.
The Mustangs, who finished sec
ond to Stanford last year at the
NCAA championships, were well
prepared for the Cardinal, but
Stanford's depth was too much for
them to handle.
The Mustangs "really got ready
for the meet," Quick said, "but the
best part about it for us is that
Catherine Fox didn't win an event
in the meet. So when you talk
about what it takes to win, you
talk about total team effort
throughout your lineup, and
that's what we got."
Fox, a freshman who won two
gold medals in the Atlanta Games
this past summer, had led the Car
dinal in every meet this season.
She currently is ranked first in the
nation in the 100-yard freestyle
and the 100-yard backstroke.
According to Quick, depth is what
will decide this year's national
championships.
"I think there will be a real bat
tle for the number of first places
that schools win," he said. "But I
think the NCAAs are going to be
won in the bottom one-third of the
teams, and I feel fabulous at both
ends for our team."

In addition to the swimmers'
improvements, the Cardinal
divers have shown they will make
some noise at the NCAA champi
onships, too. In Austin last week
end, senior Megan Gardner won
the platform event, beating Texas'
Laura Wilkinson, who just weeks
earlier beat defending champion
Becky Ruehl of Cincinnati.
All of that spells trouble for the
Golden Hears. Cal, while one of
the most improved teams in the
nation, still has a way to go before
it can compete with Stanford.
The squad is anchored by
Marylyn Chiang and Elli Overton,
the only two Bears who rank in
the top 25 in any event. Cal is
stronger this year in relays, too,
ranking in the top 25 in all fivo
events. The relay teams' times,
however, are still significantly
slower than those posted by Stan
ford squad.
Because the meet should be an
easy win for the Cardinal, the
team will continue to work on
establishing its depth in prepara
tion for postseason competition.
"I'll be looking for development
in each swimmer's third-best
event," Quick said. "One of the
things that will help us win the
NCAAs is if people each have
three very good events."
