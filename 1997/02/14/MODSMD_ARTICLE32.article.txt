# Baseball to brawl with Santa Clara
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
This weekend's victim will be
. . . the Santa Clara Broncos.
Well, perhaps the outcome of
the Cardinal baseball team's
series this weekend is still
unknown. What is certain, how
ever, is that the No. 3 Cardinal
(7-3) has outscored its oppo
nents 95-37 on the season and
29-4 in the last two games. This
reflects a well-rounded team â€”
one with excellent pitching,
solid defense and productive
offense.
The Broncos (2-3) are certain
ly not going to let Stanford bully
them around in this year's Sili
con Valley baseball rivalry. Last
year's West Coast Conference
Champions, thety have already
beaten No. 15 University of
Florida on the road this season.
Santa Clara is now ready to beat
the Card.
Stanford is "a good team, but
we would like to think we are
competitive," Santa Clara head
coach John Oldham said. "We
would like to win the series."
The Broncos strength is a
solid, veteran pitching staff,
headed by senior Jeff Perry (9-4,
3.04 ERA in 1996).
"Our pitching has been con
sistent," said Oldham. "We need
our hitters and defense to step
up."
Seniors Mike Frank and Jeff
Frankel, both 1996 All West
Coast Conference selections, key
the Bronco offense. But the self
proclaimed inconsistent defense
is feeling the loss of the West
Coast Conference most valuable
player, shortstop Ross Par

menter, who graduated last year.
"They are a solid team with a
veteran pitching staff," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess.
As Santa Clara's strength is
in its pitching, Stanford needs to
contain the Bronco offense in
this potentially low-scoring
series. The trio of senior Kyle
Peterson, and sophomores Jeff
Austin and Chad Hutchinson is
scheduled for duty.
"We need to pitch well and not
give up a lot of runs," Marquess
said.
Leading the Stanford offense
are juniors Jon Schaeffer and
Joe Kilburg. Schaeffer has four
home runs and 14 RBIs on the
season, and Kilburg is hitting
.474 with 14 RBIs. Strong out
ings fi*om seniors Luke Quaccia
and Chris Clark and sophomore
Jody Gerut are also key for the
Cardinal.
"The older players with expe
rience always need to play well in
these situations," said Mar
quess.
Sophomore second baseman
and leadoff hitter Tony Schrager
is sidelined with a severely
sprained ankle. Kilburg will
move from right field to second
base, opening an outfield posi
tion.
"We will play one of the fresh
man in the outfield," Marquess
said. "It will force us to see some
other guys play at different posi
tions."
The series opener and closer
will be at Sunken Diamond at 1
p.m. tomorrow and Monday.
Sunday's game is at 1 p.m. at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadi
um.
