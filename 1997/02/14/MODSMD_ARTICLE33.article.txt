# Golfers tame course and take title

### Yi Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team opened its NCAA season
strong, shooting a 53-over-par to
win the Regional Challenge yes
terday.
After a three-month break, the
Cardinal came off rusty at the
outset, finding itself in third place
after the first round. However,
the squad recovered to tie for first
after the second round. On the
final day, Stanford undercut the
UCIJ\. Bruins by two strokes to
win the tournament.
Senior co-captain Andrea Bax
ter, who tied for fourth with a
nine over par, was one of two
golfers who managed an even-par
round during the three-round

tournament, held in Palos
Verdes, Calif.
Fellow senior and co-captain
Mvairi McKay led the Card, tying
for second and scoring a seven
over-par after three rounds.
Freshman Julie Dunn followed,
tying for 16th at 17-over-par.
Rounding out the team score with
a 23-over-par was freshman Jae
Jean Ro. Only the top four play
ers' scores from each team were
used to tally the results.
While the team is accustomed
to playing hilly courses like its
own, the Palos Verdes Golf
Course proved to be particularly
challenging.
"Those hills were unbelievable.
It was like walking up to the
[Stanford] Dish with a golf bag,"
McKay said.

The hilly design of the course
tried the team's endurance but
did not snuff its confidence. In a
sport where mental stamina can
greatly affect one's performance,
the team has been emphasizing
psychological preparation during
practice.
"Some people were really
struggling, but we were well pre
pared. We got each other going
during the course," McKay said.
With its coastal views and tree
filled vistas, the undulating shape
of the course challenged the team
to come up with a variety of accu
rate shots for each hole.
The course's elevated greens
also added to the level of playing
difficulty. Golfers said they were
unable to see the flags, which
made aiming difficult.

The greens revealed to be espe
cially tricky because of its small
surface area and deceptive breaks,
or slopes. The downhill, uphill
and sidehill sloping made it diffi
cult to determine the speed of the
green as well, McKay said.
Despite such challenges, the
Cardinal team produced a strong
putting performance, giving it the
advantage it needed to outrank
the other 17 teams.
"We were kind of shaky at
first, but we putted well because
we've been working hard on our
short game," Baxter said.
Because the Stanford golf
course has been flooded for a con
siderable portion of this quarter,
the Cardinal team has focused on
its putting and chipping near the
driving range.
