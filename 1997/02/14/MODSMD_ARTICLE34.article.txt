# Women trek to San Diego
## Polo opens play 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The days of reckoning are final
ly upon the women's water polo
team as it opens its season this
weekend at San Diego. After begin
ning practice in October the third
seeded Cardinal will finally begin
its second season as a varsity sport
against the No. 6 seed, UC-Davis,
tonight at 7.
The squad will play tomorrow
afternoon, too, first at 1:45 p.m.
against No. 7 UC-San Diego and
again at 6:45 p.m. against No. 2
San Diego State. The toughest
challenge of these three games will
be San Diego State.
"How we play against San Diego
State is crucial. We were even with
them at the end of last year," said
assistant coach Cory Olcott.
But this is not to say Stanford
should be looked on as an under
dog as it returns three sophomore
All-Americans in standout goal
keeper Heather Crary, co-captain
Lindsay Tarn and Lindsay Welsh,
who led all Cardinal in scoring last
year as well. In addition to this
sophomore trio, co-captain Alice
Cathcart and Olivia White, both
seniors, add leadership and experi
ence to the team.
"If you compare where we were
last year at this time and where we

are this year, we are way ahead of
the game," Welsh said.
But Stanford goes even deeper
than just these veterans, as head
coach Ben Quittner added one of
the top recruiting classes in the
nation to the team this year. Three
freshmen, Suze Gardner, Ellen
Estes and Elissa Keszler, have
earned starting positions and are
expected to be pivotal in the team's
success.
"We play a lot better together
then we did last year," Tam said.
"The freshman are really talented
but also good team players. We
connect."
The tournament should be the
perfect barometer to measure the
Cardinal's abilities as it brings
together the top teams in the
nation. Top-seeded UCLA will be
there and with them come last
year's national player of the year,
Coralie Simmons, and the goal
keeper for the women's national
team, Nicolle Pain.
Fourth-seeded California, USC
and UC-Santa Barbara round out
the field of teams that Stanford
has the possibility of facing in the
semifinals and finals. Depending
on the outcome of their first three
games, the Cardinal will have a
chance play at 11 a.m. or 12:15
p.m. in the semifinals and at 5:15
p.m. in the final on Sunday.
