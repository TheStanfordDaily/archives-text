FEBRUARY 14, 1997 (WEEK ONE)

INTRODUCTIONS

Nick: It's only been a week and we're already having problems. The
house wanted to buy Doritos and Pepsi for a housewarming party, and
naturally I had to oppose that on moral grounds. I thought about all
those oppressed little Burmanese people and I had to hold back my
tears. It got really tense. I felt like it was me v. them. Someone
suggested getting Fritos instead, but that just caused bigger problems.
I.for one, will not go anywhere near those greasy little monsters. Later
that same day I caught Jane throwing a can into the regular garbage
instead of the recycling bin and that made me feel pain. I just had to
go to my room and compose another song in which I could express the
fact that I'm an anguished, tortured soul.
