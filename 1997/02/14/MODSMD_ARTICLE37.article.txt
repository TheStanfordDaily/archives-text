# VICTORIAN VALENTINES
## 
### 
Rochester, my love.
How can I possibly express
my love for you? Suffice it to say
that when I think of you. i
immediately feel the urge to cut
my wrists to swallow kerosene,
to scream your name on the
peninsula and hear the winds
echo it hack. Oh that I were I
dead so I could feel the weight
of your hotly oppressing my
breast'
Jane K.

Susan,
I know deep in my heart
that nothing can keep us apart,
not even that restraining order
you got or the new lock in your
apartment. I long for the day
we'll be together again But
there's no mountain high
enough, no security system
tough enough, to continue this
so unnatural separation. I live
for the day we'll watch the stars
together again, and I know
you'll be waiting for me with all
the lights on and the revolver
loaded.

I )ear Flannery,
I just had
to tell you I have a crush on
you. Of course, you're no
stranger to this sort of atten
tion. You. with your bulging
eyes, your ghostly pallor, your
enormous ears and your
mechanical leg! You are pure
poetry. Just to think about you
drives me wild with passion
Torture me no longer with your
mixed signals I can stand no
more.
A Displaced Lover
