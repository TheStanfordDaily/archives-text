# TAs may shoulder too much of teaching role

Are students shortchanged by the prepon
derance of teaching assistants at Stanford?
This is one of the questions that a major
review launched last spring hopes to answer
In an effort to grasp the status, effective
ness and quality of TAs, last May the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment formed the Subcommittee for Evalua
tion and Improvement of Teaching. The sub
committee plans to gather data, analyze the
data and report its findings to the Academic-
Senate.
The year-long review was initiated in re
sponse to a suggestion made by graduate stu
dent Doug Natelson, who discovered such a
review had not taken place at Stanford for
nine years and decided to bring the matter to
the attention of the ASSU Senate meeting
last February.
The presence of teaching assistants,
whether the class is an introductory econom
ics course with over 200 students or a small
graduate-level seminar in engineering, is typ
ical of a Stanford classroom. For some stu
dents, this reality seems unfortunate.

Sophomore Joseph Pawson said he would
have loved it if Prof. John Taylor had run sec
tions for his Elementary Economics class.
"It would have been great to be taught by
the professor who wrote the book for the
class himself," Pawson said.
While students like Pawson argue that
professors should not depend so heavily on
their TAs and should allow students more di
rect interaction with their instructors, con
trasting views suggest
that TAs play a crucial part in a student's
learning experience. Either way, TAs are
necessary to aid in teaching many under
graduate courses, according to Natelson.
The school of Humanities and Sciences
decided last year to increase the typical sec
tion size by two students, Natelson said.
Natelson added that he was uncomfort
able with the fact that no campus wide re
views are conducted to make major decisions
such as this one concerning both TAs and
students.
Although Natelson said a section for
which he was the TA was "not unmanagable
ly large." some undergraduate classes are
