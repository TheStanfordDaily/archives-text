# TAs may shoulder too much of teaching role
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Are students shortchanged by the prepon
derance of teaching assistants at Stanford?
This is one of the questions that a major
review launched last spring hopes to answer
In an effort to grasp the status, effective
ness and quality of TAs, last May the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment formed the Subcommittee for Evalua
tion and Improvement of Teaching. The sub
committee plans to gather data, analyze the
data and report its findings to the Academic-
Senate.
The year-long review was initiated in re
sponse to a suggestion made by graduate stu
dent Doug Natelson, who discovered such a
review had not taken place at Stanford for
nine years and decided to bring the matter to
the attention of the ASSU Senate meeting
last February.
The presence of teaching assistants,
whether the class is an introductory econom
ics course with over 200 students or a small
graduate-level seminar in engineering, is typ
ical of a Stanford classroom. For some stu
dents, this reality seems unfortunate.

Sophomore Joseph Pawson said he would
have loved it if Prof. John Taylor had run sec
tions for his Elementary Economics class.
"It would have been great to be taught by
the professor who wrote the book for the
class himself," Pawson said.
While students like Pawson argue that
professors should not depend so heavily on
their TAs and should allow students more di
rect interaction with their instructors, con
trasting views suggest
that TAs play a crucial part in a student's
learning experience. Either way, TAs are
necessary to aid in teaching many under
graduate courses, according to Natelson.
The school of Humanities and Sciences
decided last year to increase the typical sec
tion size by two students, Natelson said.
Natelson added that he was uncomfort
able with the fact that no campus wide re
views are conducted to make major decisions
such as this one concerning both TAs and
students.
Although Natelson said a section for
which he was the TA was "not unmanagable
ly large." some undergraduate classes are
large enough that students can
complete the class without once
speaking to the professor.
Sophomore Kim Coffey took
Math 43 first quarter freshman
year and said she found the large
class size intimidating, the profes
sor inaccessible and the TAs hard
to communicate with. According to
Coffey, most of the TAs did not
speak English fluently. •
"My TA had difficulty explain
ing things," Coffey said. "He could
speak in math terms, but because

he had a hard time communicating,
section would drag on."
Other students had different ex
periences with TAs. Junior Alex
Cowan, a transfer student from
UC-Santa Barbara, said his TAs in
International Politics last quarter
and Chinese Politics this quarter
have been a significant help in ad
justing to academics at Stanford.
"My TAs have been great,"
Cowan said. "They not only en
hanced the professor's teaching
but also helped me with my re
search I was doing on the side — my
TA's specialty ended up being more
related to what I was doing than
the class."
The subcommittee aims to in

vestigate both viewpoints, accord
ing to committee chairman and
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian. Cur
rently, the subcommittee is gather
ing statistics such as the amount of
actual instruction done by the TAs
in various departments. Because
schools at Stanford have not col
lected data on TAs for almost a
decade, little information is avail
able.
"I believe it is rather a lengthy
project to do, if you want to do it
right," Yearian said.
Yearian said he has one TA help
ing him out in Physics 121, an
upper-level class of over 30 stu
dents.
According to Yearian, his TA —

who runs section and grades papers
and homework assignments — is
"given a considerable amount of
autonomy." Yearian added that he
determines the final grades him
self, in conjunction with the TA.
"This is because he knows some
of the students better than I do,"
Yearian said.
In the Physics Department, all
TAs are evaluated twice with the
department's own review forms by
t he students, once halfway through
t he quarter and once at the end. Ac
cording to Yearian, the forms used
in his department are in part blue
prints of the newly revised evalua
tion forms of the department of
Humanities and Sciences.

Five TAs assisted Psychology
Prof. Claude Steele's Introduction
to Social Psychology course last
quarter. Steele said the TAs had "a
fair amount of responsibility" in
the undergraduate class of over 200
students and especially in the sec
tions.
Steele commented that it is im
portant that the TAs are thorough
ly reviewed, given their integral
role in Stanford education.
In the department of Engineer
ing Economic Systems and Opera
tional Research, course assistants
replace TAs in every class.
According to Chair of Engineering
Economic Systems and Opera
tional Research James Sweeney,

CAs are different from TAs in that
they merely help design exams and
tutor students outside of class and
section time.
Sweeney, who is in charge of al
location of CAs for all courses,
added that all classes and section
are run by faculty.
"The CAs provide enriching
one-to-one activities with individ
ual students, and we think of them
as just absolutely invaluable," he
said.
Sweeney also said although
there are certain definitions of TAs
and CAs designated by the Univer
sity, the important issue is to pro
vide for their variation according to
class, size and level.
