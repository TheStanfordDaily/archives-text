### Erika Check 
Former Stanford Political Sci
ence Prof. A 1 de Grazia is unveiling
a World Wide Web site today which
should fill even the bitterest Stan
ford hearts with visions of true,
Hallmark-style love.
De Grazia's site contains the
world's largest collection of World
War II love letters, written be
tween de Grazia and his future
wife, Jill Oppenheim, while he was
serving in the United States Army
between 1942 and 1945.
According to de Grazia's Web
site, located at http://www.graz
ian-archive.com, the "alpha and
omega of the letters is love." Yatin
Thakore, who works with an Inter
net publishing company helping de
Grazia maintain the site, said the
letters tell a "romantic kind of real
life saga." He also said the letters
should appeal to "lots of folks
around the world because they
document everyday feelings that a
lot of people can identify with."
De Grazia said although the let
ters were written just between he
and his wife, he has "always
thought they were worth convey
ing to a wider public" because the
collection is "not only the largest,
but the best" of its kind. He also
called his wife "one of the greatest
writers ever to hit the American
scene."
De Grazia, who taught at Stan
ford between 1952 and 1957, also
said the letters were important be
cause they give "a very good, well
rounded picture of American cul
ture 50 years ago" and called the

collection "a mirror of the
[wartime] period that can be com
pared with America today."
He said his wife's letters were
particularly revealing because she
had "just about every home front
experience one could have." Her
stories range from working in local
Chicago politics and a wartime fac
tory to marrying an enlisted sol
dier to raising a child on her own.
De Grazia himself was involved
in campaigns in North Africa and
Europe and was present at the
opening of the Dachau death camp
and the liberation of Rome. He said
the collection is a "great repository
of human knowledge" which
would interest historians and liter
ary scholars alike because of its
historical content.
In addition to this, the letters
have particular human interest be
cause they were written by "two
intelligent, thinking people who
express their thoughts very well in
written words," Thakore said.
The Web site is opening today,
Valentine's Day, not only because
of the collection's relevance to
love and lovers, but also because
this this date is close to the an
niversary of de Grazia's enlist
ment in the Army and to the date
of the first letter of the collection.
The site already contains the
first two months of letters. Thako
re said de Grazia plans to update
the site every week by adding new
letters in their original sequence.
The collection of letters is part of a
larger site which contains some of
de Grazia's philosophical, literary
and historical work.
