Yahoo! brings no word of a contribu
tion to Stanford, but nonetheless such
gift has been given.
Yahoo! creators David Filo and
Jerry Yang recently donated a $2
million sum to the School of Engi
neering.
The gift, which came from their
own funds rather than from
Yahoo's, established a new profes

chair, which will focus on the inte

technology and entrepreneurship.
At 28 and 30 respectively, Eilo
and Yang are the youngest donors
ever to have endowed a chair at the
University. Having both attended
Stanford as undergraduates, the
men subsequently received mas
ter's in electrical engineering in
1990 here as well. Their donation

was spurred by a wish to give back
to the University.
"Stanford was an integral part of
the creation of Yahoo! Through the
endowment of a professorship,
David and I felt that we can give
back to the University by providing
a long-term resource to advance lev
els of teaching and research," Yang
said.
Laura Breyfogle, external rela
tions spokesperson for the Engi
neering School commented on the
gift and the givers: "Jerry and Dave
are just great guys. I've worked
with a lot of donors and what struck
me about them was their underly
ing desire to do something good for
Stanford. Their gift was very phil
anthropic and generous."
While working on doctorates at
the campus Computer Systems
Laboratory in 1994, Eilo and Yang
