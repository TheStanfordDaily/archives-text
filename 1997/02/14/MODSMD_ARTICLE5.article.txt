Yahoo! brings no word of a contribu
tion to Stanford, but nonetheless such
gift has been given.
Yahoo! creators David Filo and
Jerry Yang recently donated a $2
million sum to the School of Engi
neering.
The gift, which came from their
own funds rather than from
Yahoo's, established a new profes
sorial chair, the Yahoo! Founders
chair, which will focus on the inte
gration of information systems
technology and entrepreneurship.
At 28 and 30 respectively, Eilo
and Yang are the youngest donors
ever to have endowed a chair at the
University. Having both attended
Stanford as undergraduates, the
men subsequently received mas
ter's in electrical engineering in
1990 here as well. Their donation

was spurred by a wish to give back
to the University.
"Stanford was an integral part of
the creation of Yahoo! Through the
endowment of a professorship,
David and I felt that we can give
back to the University by providing
a long-term resource to advance lev
els of teaching and research," Yang
said.
Laura Breyfogle, external rela
tions spokesperson for the Engi
neering School commented on the
gift and the givers: "Jerry and Dave
are just great guys. I've worked
with a lot of donors and what struck
me about them was their underly
ing desire to do something good for
Stanford. Their gift was very phil
anthropic and generous."
While working on doctorates at
the campus Computer Systems
Laboratory in 1994, Eilo and Yang
began compiling a list of World
Wide Web sites that they consid
ered useful or interesting.
They converted the guide to a
searchable database capable of
helping thousands of computer
users. Before long, the immensely
popular site grew much larger and
became the Internet's inaugural
search engine.
According to Yang, the now-fa
mous engine started as just a

hobby. "We were grad students at
the time, trying to get our theses
done," he said. "We had the advan
tage of an interesting name and
were pretty fortunate to be in the
right place at the right time."
After less than a year of opera
tion, traffic to the site began to
overwhelm the University's com
puter system. In response,
Netscape Communications
founder and president, Marc An
dreessen offered to house the pro
ject at his company's site in Moun
tain View in early 1995.
What started as a pastime for

the two graduate students soon be
came the benchmark against
which all future search engines
would be measured.
The comprehensive Web site
now records more than 20 million
page views a day and assists mil
lions of netizens in maneuvering
their way around the Web.
The site has been deemed so use
ful that both Netscape's Navigator
and Microsoft's Internet Explorer,
the world's two most popular
browsers, have links to it.
In the three years that it has ex
isted, Yahoo! has expanded so that

it now offers "content areas" for
stock quotes, business informa
tion, news, interactive maps, yel
low pages, weather forecasts and
sports scores.
It also has My Yahoo!, a person
al Web page that dispatches cus
tomized information to the user.
Yang believes that this service of
the Internet will expand quickly
and soon be an integral part of its
function.
"We think delivering informa
tion on a personalized basis will be
very important in the future,"
Yang said.
