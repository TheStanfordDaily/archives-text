In the course of a shocking investigation,
The Daily has learned that, contrary to pop
ular belief, romance does indeed flourish at
Stanford. Here in celebration of the cheesi
est holiday of the year, three pairs of sweet
hearts talk about how they got together de
spite the myth.
Couple No. 1
Who they are: Alex Alviar, a senior from
Houston and Janet Bucher, a senior from
Bonners Ferry, Idaho.
How they met: Freshman year they both
lived in Gavilan on opposite ends of the hall.
When they first kissed: Three days after
school started. "I was scared and shy. He
was aggressive," said Janet. After the kiss "1
was sunk," she said. Even so, they hacked
off. According to Janet, "We're a very hesi
tant couple."

How they got over their hesitation: They
went home for winter break and had time to
think over their relationship. When they
came back. Alex, who had dated a lot in high
school, felt ready to make a commitment.
Janet, who had not dated much in high
school, "felt comfortable saying, 'I'm willing
to take a chance with you,' " according to
Alex.
Why they liked eaeh other: "Her sincerity,"
Alex said. "There's nothing about her that's
artificial or pretentious. I really respect
that. And I was very attracted to her."
"He was flirtatious; he was fun to play
with," Janet said. "We had goofy water
fights and shaving cream fights."
How they communicate: "We're always look
ing at each other," Janet said. Alex said he
reads lips because he's "almost as deaf as
you can get."
Janet is so accustomed to his lip reading
that "if someone looks awav when I'm talk
ing to them, I stop talking because if Alex

isn't looking at me, he's not listening to
me."
What the future holds: He wants to go into
consulting or financial analysis. She wants
to work in an animal clinic. "We'll live to
gether, hopefully around here," Alex said.
Hou they 've stayed together for three years:
"We constantly question and re-evaluate
our relationship and our commitment to the
relationship," Alex said. "We're not a cutesy
couple, but we are a very happy couple, and
we've come a long way together."
Couple No. 2
Who They Are: Katie Beattie, a senior from
San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and Doug Mac-
Donald, a senior from Shaver Lake, Calif.
Why it will he hard for Doug to top today
what he did for Katie's birthday: "He wrote
a poem," said Katie. "He gave me wind
chimes and said how the chimes were our se-
cret language."
How they met: They've been part
of the same group of friends since
freshman year. "I've been
friends with all these guys for a
long time. I always got teased
and picked on," Katie said.
"Doug always took me seriously.
He always listened."
Why he was drawn to her: "She
has a unique characteristic in
that she knows how to enjoy her
self and make other people enjoy
themselves," Doug said.
When they became close: Last
summer, when they both stayed
in the area.
Katie said, "We did a lot of the
things you're too busy to do dur
ing the school year — we went
water-skiing, we went wine-tast
ing in Sonoma and we went on a
lot of road trips."
How they finally became a couple:
By late August, it was clear to
both of them that they were in
terested in each other, but Katie
was "worried about changing the
dynamic of our whole group" of
friends.
After school started, they
were unsure of where things
stood and dated other people.
But they kept running into each
other on campus, which Katie
thought was fate.
Then, on a long drive with
members of her sorority, she said
she "went to sleep for an hour,
and when I woke up, I was on
Douglas Avenue. It was a sign."
What they've done since heeding
the sign: "The first time we went
out to dinner, my car broke
down, so we biked into Palo
Alto," said Doug. "It turned out
to be one of the coolest things
we'd ever done." They've also
gone to see "The Nutcracker,"
gone horseback riding on Doug's
family ranch and had a snow pic
nic.
What they're doing to celebrate
Valentine's Day: "We have tick
ets to see 'Phantom of the
Opera,"' Katie said. "And he
gave me a bracelet three weeks
early. He'd had it since Christ
mas and couldn't wait any
longer."
Couple No. 3
Who they are: Patrick Unemori, a
senior from Maui, Hawaii and

Orien Richmond, a junior from
Santa Cruz, Calif.
What was working against them-.
The fact that Orien had never
kissed anyone. "I thought kiss
ing was going to be disgusting,"
Orien said.
"I thought tongues touching
each other would be gross and
nasty. Our first kiss dispelled my
doubts."
How they met: Last October, a
group of their mutual friends
went out for dinner in San Fran
cisco.
Why their first impressions were
wrong: "I thought 'Hmmm,
cute,'" Patrick said. But "I
thought he's probably a player,
probably arrogant and probably
already in a relationship."
"I assumed Patrick was
straight" because he came to din
ner with a female friend, Orien
said.
How they expressed their interest
in each other: A week of e-mail
ing. "I was printing out his e
mail and showing it to all my
friends, analyzing it," said Orien.
What drew them to each other:
"Talking was the biggest thing to
me," Patrick said. "We had real
ly good conversations."
"We kind of clicked on those
basic things immediately —
trust, monogamy," said Orien.
How things took off: Two weeks
after meeting, they were watch
ing TV in Orien's dorm. "We
were sitting so close, and I was so
tortured," Patrick said. "I
thought, 'Here we go again.
Nothing's going to happen. This
night is going to pass.' "
"I leaned into him and
thought, 'If he leans back into
me, I'm going to do something
bold.' I was like, 'Is it OK if I put
my arm around you?' " Orien
told Patrick it was OK. Inside,
said Patrick, "I was doing cart
wheels."
How they've kept the romance
alive: For Halloween, they went
to the Castro dressed as Bert and
Ernie. For their one month an
niversary, Patrick awakened
Orien at 4 a.m. and whisked him
to the Rodin Sculpture Garden
for music, wine and the sunrise.
Next on the couple's agenda is
the Viennese Ball.
What Orien would tell students
who haven't yet found their
Valentine: "There's definitely
someone out there for you. Prob
ably on campus, definitely some
where out in the world."
