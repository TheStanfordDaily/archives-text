The Daily has learned that, contrary to pop
ular belief, romance does indeed flourish at

hearts talk about how they got together de

Houston and Janet Bucher, a senior from
Bonners Ferry, Idaho.
How they met: Freshman year they both
lived in Gavilan on opposite ends of the hall.
When they first kissed: Three days after
school started. "I was scared and shy. He
was aggressive," said Janet. After the kiss "1
was sunk," she said. Even so, they hacked
off. According to Janet, "We're a very hesi

school, felt ready to make a commitment.
Janet, who had not dated much in high
school, "felt comfortable saying, 'I'm willing

Alex.
Why they liked eaeh other: "Her sincerity,"

Hou they 've stayed together for three years:
