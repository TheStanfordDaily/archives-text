# Dinshaw discusses LGB issues in history

### Alex Tung Contributing writer 
Humanities Center Senior Fellow Carolyn
Dinshaw spoke to an audience of about 40 in the
Humanities Center Annex yesterday.
Dinshaw's speech, which addressed Con
gressional spending and the "need to construct
a queer history to provide models of possibili
ty," was part of the Stanford Lesbian / Gay / Bi
sexual Studies lecture series.
Dinshaw, an associate professor of English
at UC-Berkeley, is one of the leading feminist
scholars and critics in medieval literature. She
is also author of "Chaucer's Sexual Poetics"
and editor of GLQ: A Journal of Gay and Les
bian Studies.
Her speech, titled "Queer Histories:
Margery Kempe, Robert Gluck and the 104 th
Congress" started with a discussion of books
with queer themes and then moved on to ad
dress Congress' recent attempts to cut spend
ing through the elimination of the National En

dowment for Humanities. The endowment is a
program which supports many lesbian, gay and
bisexual literary and artistic projects.
Dinshaw cited many examples where mem
bers of Congress have deemed a waste of funds.
Among these was funding for a database index
of Gregorian chants, a conversation kit which
"allows Americans to talk to each other," ac
cording to one congressman, and a trip for 24
college professors to travel outside of the coun
try to discuss sex and gender issues in medieval
works.
Claiming that the foreclosure of these kinds
of programs was a "resistance to the concepts of
the engagement of relations across time," Din
shaw said this elimination promotes an "Amer
ican modernity whose history is short and san
itized."
Dinshaw contended Congress's claims that
it is attacking the endowment only because it is
less important than other projects in need of
funding. According to her, Congress is inten
tionally delivering the message that the endow

ment is a waste of money in any fiscal climate.
"The endowment's budget is only drops in the
federal bucket," she said.
She described these actions as leading to a
"Fourth of July historianism" and supported
moving towards a more inclusive one.
Discussing the idea of a "touch of queer,"
Dinshaw did not limit the concept to homosex
uality or bisexuality.
"Queerness is just that relation of disjunc
tiveness," she said, "that feeling of being left
out."
Dinshaw compared Margery Kempe's life
story — a confused Christian coping with queer
desires — with the story told in a by Robert
Gliick's novel, "Margery Kempe," which details
the attempts of a modern gay man to find unity
for his own life in Kempe's example.
In the question-and-answer session follow
ing the speech, Dinshaw said that she was not
tryingto create a "queer continuum" but hoped
that "queers and humanities scholars can come
together" at the moment of need.
