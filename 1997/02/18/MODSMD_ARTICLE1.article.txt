Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky filed a lawsuit last
month against New Age guru Deepak Chopra and a
number of publishing corporations for copyright in
fringement and unfair competition.
According to Sapolsky, there are at least seven ex
amples in Chopra's 1993 bestseller, "Ageless Body,
Timeless Mind," which are strikingly similar to his
chapter titled, "Neuroendocrinology of the Stress Re
sponse" in the 1992 book "Behavioral Endocrinology."
Chopra's book already has sold more than 1 million
copies and has reaped an estimated $1 million in prof
its, according to court documents.
"They deceptively portray the work of Sapolsky as
though it is the work of Chopra by failing to give that at
tribution anywhere in the book, and after notice from
Sapolsky for more than one year they fail to correct that
lack of attribution and to explain how it is that they
used the same words," said Jack Russo, a Palo Alto in
tellectual property lawyer representing Sapolsky in the
case.
According to the suit, filed with the U.S. District
Court in San Jose on Jan. 24, Sapolsky first learned of
the alleged plagiarism through one of his postdoctoral
fellows, Laura Macintosh, who brought the striking
similarities to his attention in July 1995.
A few days later, Sapolsky found articles in The New
York Times and The Washington Post concerning al
leged copying by Chopra, in the same work, of excerpts
from Dan Georgakas's book entitled "The Methuselah
Factors," according to Sapolsky's statement.
"Though I have made repeated attempts to resolve
this matter without litigation, negotiations ended in
December 1996 when defendant Chopra, Random
House and related companies required that I [give false
statements]," Sapolsky said in the legal declaration.
Sapolsky testified he is often told he copied Chopra's
work.
Carla DiMare, legal counsel for Chopra, said Sapol
sky's lawsuit is an attempt to get money out of Chopra
and other defendants.
"It's our position that Sapolsky is tiying to black
mail Chopra, and that this is a completely meritless
lawsuit," she said.
"Chopra did not plagiarize anything of Sapolsky's,
and Sapolsky has provided no proof that it is his origi
nal work," DiMare added.
