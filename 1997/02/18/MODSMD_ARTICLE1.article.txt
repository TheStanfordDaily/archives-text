Biology Prof. Robert Sapolsky filed a lawsuit last
month against New Age guru Deepak Chopra and a
number of publishing corporations for copyright in
fringement and unfair competition.
According to Sapolsky, there are at least seven ex
amples in Chopra's 1993 bestseller, "Ageless Body,
Timeless Mind," which are strikingly similar to his
chapter titled, "Neuroendocrinology of the Stress Re
sponse" in the 1992 book "Behavioral Endocrinology."
Chopra's book already has sold more than 1 million
copies and has reaped an estimated $1 million in prof
its, according to court documents.
"They deceptively portray the work of Sapolsky as
though it is the work of Chopra by failing to give that at
tribution anywhere in the book, and after notice from
Sapolsky for more than one year they fail to correct that
lack of attribution and to explain how it is that they
used the same words," said Jack Russo, a Palo Alto in
tellectual property lawyer representing Sapolsky in the
case.
According to the suit, filed with the U.S. District
Court in San Jose on Jan. 24, Sapolsky first learned of
the alleged plagiarism through one of his postdoctoral
fellows, Laura Macintosh, who brought the striking
similarities to his attention in July 1995.
A few days later, Sapolsky found articles in The New
York Times and The Washington Post concerning al
leged copying by Chopra, in the same work, of excerpts
from Dan Georgakas's book entitled "The Methuselah
Factors," according to Sapolsky's statement.
"Though I have made repeated attempts to resolve
this matter without litigation, negotiations ended in
December 1996 when defendant Chopra, Random
House and related companies required that I [give false
statements]," Sapolsky said in the legal declaration.
Sapolsky testified he is often told he copied Chopra's
work.
Carla DiMare, legal counsel for Chopra, said Sapol
sky's lawsuit is an attempt to get money out of Chopra
and other defendants.
"It's our position that Sapolsky is tiying to black
mail Chopra, and that this is a completely meritless
lawsuit," she said.
"Chopra did not plagiarize anything of Sapolsky's,
and Sapolsky has provided no proof that it is his origi
nal work," DiMare added.
According to DiMare, the book
"Behavioral Endocrinology" was
originally copyrighted to MIT Press
in 1992. Sapolsky, DiMare said, ob
tained copyright to the book in 1995
and "immediately proceeded to no
tify Chopra's attorney" [asking for
money].

But according to Russo, the en
tire book — a compilation of several
scholars' works — was originally
copyrighted to MIT Press, but the
copyright protects each of the au
thors' individual rights.
"The law is that when the entire
book is registered for copyright, it
protects the copyright on the entire
book as well as on the chapters," he
said.
Sapolsky obtained a confirma
tion in September 1995 from the

MIT Press of the copyright to his
work, according to Russo.
Russo also said Chopra recently
changed his defense.
"Chopra is arguing that he 'fair
ly used' — that's an admission that
he copied," Russo said. "You don't
commercially exploit someone
else's work."
The Fair Use Doctrine allows for
fairly quoting or paraphrasing
works for educational or newswor
thy purposes and attributing these

phrases, according to Russo.
"Their story had previously been
that it was his original research. The
new slant seems to be, 'OK, I copied
it, but I am entitled protection under
the Fair Use Doctrine,' " he said.
A hearing is scheduled on March
14, when a judge will decide
whether to forbid Chopra, Random
House and several bookstore chains
from selling the book as well as
audio tapes and other materials
based on it.
