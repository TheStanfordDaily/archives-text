Whitewater prosecutor to resign
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a surprising devel
opment, Pepperdine University said yesterday that
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr will step
down from the probe to join the school this sum
mer, raising questions about whether his investiga
tion of the Clinton White House is at an end.
The Whitewater investigation, which Starr has
led for the past 2 1/2 years, is at a critical juncture
with prosecutors weighing the evidence involving
the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Starr and the Whitewater prosecutor's office
were silent after the announcement by Pepper
dine, located in Malibu, Calif.
Starr will decide what, if any, action to take
against the Clintons, and"he will have ample time
to consider all matters," said a lawyer familiar
with the Whitewater probe

Zaire bombs rebel-held towns
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Government forces
bombed three rebel-held towns in eastern Zaire
yesterday and vowed to intensify the attacks, which
witnesses said killed at least six people. It was the
sharpest escalation yet in the five-month war.
The towns of Bukavu, Walikale and Shabunda
were bombed, said Defense Ministry spokesman
Leon Kalima. He gave no casualty figures but
urged civilians to leave rebel-held areas.
"These bombardments will continue and inten
sify," Kalima said.
Aid workers said six people were killed and at
least 20 wounded in Bukavu.
"These numbers could grow," said Brenda Bar
ton, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Pro
gram, based in Nairobi, Kenya. "There's a panic in
the town," and many people are fleeing, she said.
