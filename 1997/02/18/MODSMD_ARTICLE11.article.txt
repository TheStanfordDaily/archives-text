# Albright successful in France
## Impresses French leaders on first trip as secretary of state 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” Speaking some French and even a
little Russian, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
smoothed over some of the bumps in recent U.S.
relations with France yesterday.
Albright pleased the French by inviting President
Jacques Chirac "to put his shoulder to the wheel" in
Arab-Israeli peacemaking. She also succeeded with
out ruffling French feathers in sidetracking a pro
posal for a five-power summit to allay Russian con
cerns over NATO's projected expansion eastward.
"We've had some ups and downs, why not have
an up period?" a pleased French Prime Minister
Alain Juppe told Albright at the end of their meet
ing.
And Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, who
like Juppe has had some rough times with the first
Clinton administration, was velvet smooth during a
joint news conference with Albright at the Quai
d'Orsay. "We did everything to dispel the impres

sion there are clouds in the relationship," he said.
"Our relationship is very solid and positive,"
Albright said.
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said the United States and France had found com
mon ground on urging reforms in Zaire and wanting
neighboring countries to steer clear of a rebellion in
the eastern part of the African county.
Only a year ago, the French were grumbling that
then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip
to Africa was an election ploy. French officials sug
gested they had a special expertise that the United
States should respect.
On the main business at hand, forging a united
approach on NATO's absorption beginning this
summer of Central and Eastern European coun
tries, Albright declared triumphantly: "We are on
the road to Madrid." The meeting will be held in
July in Madrid
