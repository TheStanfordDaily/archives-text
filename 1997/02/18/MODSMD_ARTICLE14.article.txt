## Editorial Mentoring with Pete 
### 
New statewide initiative
must complement other
existing social programs
GOV. PETE WILSON
appears to be reaching out
to the state's underprivi
leged youth with his new Califor
nia Mentor Initiative, a program
that calls for recruiting and train
ing 250,000 mentors within the
next four years. Indeed, Wilson's
commitment to help at-risk chil
dren seems to run deep: Last
month he said he wants to serve as
a mentor himself.
The idea behind the initiative —
reaching at-risk youth through
mentors — is a good one and one
which is already embraced by Stan
ford students. Training and
recruiting mentors, sending them
out into communities could be a
great thing but only if implemented
in addition to existing educational
and social service programs and as
a part of a greater effort to improve
conditions in which the children
being mentored live.
Stanford students have long
played an active role as mentors in
communities surrounding the cam
pus, most notably in East Palo Alto.
After a fire destroyed a large
part of Green Oaks Elementary
School last month, a group of Stan
ford students helped clean up the
school and since have done what
they can to make things easier for
students and teachers there.
Because the fire ruined eight of the
school's classrooms, students have
been taking field trips and attend
ing other nearby elementary
schools. When a fourth-grade class
visited Stanford last month, again
students pitched in, showing the
fourth-graders around campus.
On a regular basis, the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service offers a num
ber of programs that send Stanford
students into East Palo Alto as
tutors and mentors.

The Upward Bound program is
a particularly effective way for stu
dents from Stanford to serve as
mentors to East Palo Alto high
school students. Through the pro
gram, Stanford students work with
high schoolers whose parents did
not attend college, helping with the
college application process and
encouraging the youths to apply
In addition, a handful of mem
bers of the Stanford community
have joined Wilson's initiative and
are serving as mentors through it.
Clearly, there is huge potential for
more Stanford community mem
bers to get involved as mentors.
Currently, $11.6 million is allo
cated annually for the mentoring
program, and Wilson's new budget
calls for nearly double that amount.
The concern that comes along
with the potential benefits of Wil
son's new mentor initiative is that
over time he will ultimately use it
against the same youth he says he
designed it to help. Unfortunately,
the hypocrisy of the program is
inescapable.
Democrats around the state,
however, have denounced Wilson's
initiative saying that it is meaning
less unless Wilson simultaneously
makes an effort to improve the con
ditions which plague the at-risk
youth he wants to help. And they're
right for being skeptical. One can
only wonder when Wilson will start
trying to cut back other social ser
vice programs to save money, now
with the political cover of having
increased funding for mentoring.
The hypocrisy of the initiative is
most obvious when thinking of Wil
son serving as a mentor. Perhaps
he'll be able to schedule some time
for his mentees between meetings
on eliminating affirmative action
and strategy sessions for cutting
social services.
The California Mentor Initiative
has good intentions. But intentions
are only intentions, and it is tough
to imagine many at-risk children
embracing this latest of Wilson's
plans while so many others exacer
bate their hardships.
