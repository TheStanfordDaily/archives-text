Human side or not, military still discriminates

NEXT YEAR, BRIGITTE Wallace
(whose Thursday letter to The
Daily defended the Reserve Offi
cers' Training Corps program) will be
graduating from Stanford and starting
a career as a Naval officer. During her
years of service, she will undoubtedly
work with many gay and lesbian
sailors; some may see her as a progres
sive and tolerant person and trust her
enough to share their secret with her.
With the nature of naval operations,
she will likely spend much time away
from home. There will be years when
she spends more time with her ship
mates than with her own significant
other or spouse or children.
She may find herself someday serving
on an Administrative Discharge Board,
appointed by her commanding officer to
recommend whether a sailor should be
discharged for homosexuality. The sailor
before her will not be a complete
stranger but someone from her own
command. She may have shared the joy
of seeing this sailor's first child learn to
walk and the sadness of seeing the event
only in a photograph. The respondent
(as someone brought before an Adminis
trative Discharge Board is called) could
be a trouble maker, constantly called

before the commanding officer for this
or that infraction but probably not.
More than likely, she will find a
model sailor, a hard worker who stays
out of trouble, who joined the Navy for
the educational benefits and for the
opportunity to serve our country —
much like her own reasons for studying
on a ROTC scholarship. He or she could
be a yeoman who once saved Wallace
embarrassment by finding errors in a
piece of official correspondence or
maybe a rescue swimmer who once
saved a friend of hers or maybe a main
tenance technician who once prevented
a fatal mishap or maybe just a sailor
who did his or her job, keeping a low
profile, not opening up much to other
members of the command.
And how did this sailor come to face
the board? Perhaps the sailor let slip
that her date was named Carla, not
Carl, in earshot of a chief petty officer
whose attitude is "homosexuals — not
in my Navy!" Or perhaps he was turned
in by an angry ex-lover who took
revenge by sending a letter to the skip
per. Or maybe he or she was fingered
during the investigation of a gay or les
bian shipmate coerced into naming
other homosexuals by threats of prose

cution for sodomy and implied promises
of lenient treatment.
After hearing the government's accu
sations, not limited by courtroom rules
of evidence since this is an administra
tive proceeding rather than a trial by
court-martial, and after the respon
dent's defense, Wallace will then deliber
ate with the other board members. She
may decide to recommend retention in
the Navy, on grounds that the respon
dent has proved lack of intent to commit
homosexual acts even if the respondent
presented no such evidence — there has
been at least one case where this hap
pened. More likely, the majority of the
board will recommend a discharge. An
administrative discharge ends the
sailor's Naval service and takes away
any veteran's retirement benefits. It can
make finding a new job difficult.
By serving in the U.S. armed forces,
Wallace has reason to be proud. But she
is also part of an organization that tol
erates and even mandates discrimina
tion based on sexual orientation. While
racial and ethnic jokes are out, a little
humor with homophobic stereotypes
and slurs rates a chuckle.
Wallace asked readers of The Daily to
consider the human aspects of the

ROTC program. Its only right that we
ask her to consider the human aspects of
the "don't ask, don't tell" policy —
which she defends as progressive.
Promising military careers are still
abruptly ended when homosexuals are
discovered; discharges for homosexuality
are more numerous under the new poli
cy than under the old.
The military's criminal investigative
agencies still conduct investigations into
the sexual orientation of military per
sonnel, solely to discover and discharge
gays and lesbians. Successful military
women can still find themselves suspect
ed of being lesbians because of their very
success, for being in good physical condi
tion, for doing their duties aggressively
and for spurning unwanted advances
from male colleagues.
Progressive open minded junior offi
cers such as Wallace may eventually
change the military's opposition to
allowing gays and lesbians to serve open
ly. But until that happens, she will be
required to enforce a policy that would
constitute illegal discrimination if adopt
ed by any other employer in California
or many other states.
