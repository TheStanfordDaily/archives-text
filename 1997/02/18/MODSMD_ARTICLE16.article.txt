# Public service minor would give students expanded education
## 
### 
As a coordinator of the ASSU group
developing the public service minor, I
would like to clarify several points raised
in The Daily's Feb. 5 editorial.
First, The Daily asserts that the cur
rent proposal would only grant stu
dents credit for service work. In fact,
the proposal also suggests a compre
hensive program which will allow stu
dents to engage in experience-based

learning, combining theory and prac
tice. Following the form of other aca
demic minor programs, the public ser
vice minor will have a core curriculum
of three classes with an additional
three classes determined by the stu
dent's focus. The proposal also includes
a long-term internship project with a
reflective component to allow students
to discuss their experiences. In addi
tion, the program will include a cap
stone piece in the form of an honors
thesis or other synthesis of the aca
demic and service experience through
the minor.
Second, while we appreciate the sug
gestion of incorporating the minor into

the Urban Studies Program, these are
two separate but not mutually exclu
sive programs. The more fundamental
issue here is resources. This proposal
draws on existing Stanford resources
and models of interdisciplinary pro
grams; however, these same programs
are already overstressed by sheci' popu
larity and lack of structural support by
the current university system. The
public service minor will take faculty
time, an internship coordinator, staff
support and a home in the university
structure; it must have this support in
order for students to benefit from the
program.
Last week, more than 30 students

attended a discussion focused on creat
ing such a program. What impressed
me most was the sincere commitment
of those who attended to service-learn
ing as part of their Stanford academic
experience. A program combining rig
orous academic study with engaged
community participation allows stu
dents to extend their education beyond
the walls and boundaries of this insti
tution, a sentiment clearly valued by
the students that attended the discus
sion.
A public service minor is one pathway
for this vision.
