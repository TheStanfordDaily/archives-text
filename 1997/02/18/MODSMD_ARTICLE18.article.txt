## The 						simple pleasures of life

{ mHE MEANING of life, I think, is
happiness," said the Dalai Lama
.X.from the podium in Memorial
Church amid a sea of students and
framed by sunlight streaming through
the very denominational stained glass.
Two years later, these few simple
words filled my mind as I entered the
Gesshin-in Temple in Kyoto, Japan.
Evicted from my apartment after many
months of introspection and self-imposed
solitude, I figured that I could use a little
guidance, and it wasn't going to come
from one of Japan's famous 2,000 yen
per night sexually focused, love-hotels.
I entered the temple on a Sunday
morning. Within the wooden fence of the
Buddhist sanctuary, the silence was bro
ken only by the soft crackle of a burning
mosquito-repellent ring. I walked
through the grounds searching for a wel
come, but I found no one.
There were a few bare rooms, separat
ed only by a shoji rice-paper screen,
clearly meant for weary wanderers like
myself. I accidentally brushed a way
ward futon and watched two cockroach
es skitter away. The outside environs
were in disrepair with branches strewn
about and fence posts in need of mend
ing. I passed a small shrine and proceed
ed into another entryway. There I saw
shelves upon shelves overflowing with
children's tricycles.
Just then a short, balding man walked

in, dressed in a white T-shirt and the
Japanese equivalent of underoos, carry
ing a fire-engine-red three-wheeler under
his arm.
Shocked by this sudden intrusion into
the strange world I had found, I forgot
my sense for Japanese manners and def
erence.
"What are these for?" I struggled in
broken Japanese.
"They are my hobby. I build them," he
replied in equally tentative English.
He war at least 60 years old and
Japanese but with blue eyes and blinding
white hair. I found out later that he had
been born albino. He told me that he was
the temple's head monk. He built and
maintained the tricycles for the local chil
dren and for himself. He had been doing
this for 40 years.
For the next two weeks, I spent every
possible minute I could with the monk. I
never knew his name, and the majority
of our interactions centered around us
drinking Sapporo and cheap sake
together. I showed him pictures of the
places I had traveled, and he modeled
his many tricycles for me. He spoke of
junkyard wrecks, which he soldered,
painted and re-created into beautiful,
functional vehicles.
His favorites were a completely
restored gleaming plastic Big Wheel and
a brilliant blue classic with a tiny horn,
ribbons on the handlebars and a step in

the back for a passenger. My favorite was
a mini Harley, red-yellow flames creeping
down the side, which ran on a two-horse
power gas engine.
I woke up my last morning in the tem
ple at 6 a.m. to see him driving his fire
starter around the temple grounds, dodg
ing the branches and laughing loud
enough to drown out the engine. When I
walked out the door with my backpack to
return to America, he was kneeling in
front of his temple's altar, performing his
daily prayer routine giving thanks for his
happiness.
A couple days ago, I heard enviro-busi
ness advocate Paul Hawken speak about
his quest for "simplicity without reduc
tion." Maybe that's the answer. Perhaps,
my hectic, diverse lifestyle should be no
more than a temporary means to discov
er the simple pleasures to which I can
dedicate my life.
Although I remain skeptical about
whether I could achieve true happiness
while remaining celibate, I found a man
who was both content and passionate
about his life. And from my experience,
that is a rare combination.
