# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Reporters and politicos: a match made in heaven 
### 
AS I'M SURE you will recall, loyal
readers, in this space one week ago
I wrote a column about the Pen
tagon's Reserve Officers' Training Corps
program and the federal regulations gov
erning what happens to those institutions
choosing not to house an ROTC unit. My
ultimate point — and whether I argued it
clearly or effectively is certainly debatable
— was that those rules are lamentable.
Under Congressional mandates, if Stan
ford stands up for its principles — in this
case that anti-gay discrimination, includ
ing that practiced by the Defense Depart
ment, will not be tolerated — it is con
ceivable the University could be forced to
give up $48.2 million in revenues.
Included in that column were a few
asides that were at least anti-military
tone if not outright anti-ROTC. While I
never intended to criticize Stanford's
ROTC-ers as individuals — in fact I
admire their willingness to make such an
extraordinary commitment to defending
our national interests — some obviously
took my column as a direct affront to
those students, as well as to the men and
women currently in uniform and to all of
our nation's veterans.
Chief among those who were deeply
offended was our crusading ASSU presi
dent, Bill Shen. In a letter printed in Fri
day's Daily, he let the world know that he
had read my column with "shock, disap
pointment and disgust." I am a "limou
sine liberal," he pointed out, and he gen
erously apologized on behalf of my

"overblown ego."
Some told me they thought that Bill
had been a bit harsh on me. But in fairness
to our president, I sit on an editorial board
which in the last two weeks has lambasted
his administration for seizing upon an
ever-changing "Issue of the Week," has
argued that there is no reason for Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper to pay any
attention to his office's campaign for
socially responsible investment and has
vilified one of his nominees for the ASSU's
Constitutional Council because, among
other reasons, Bill has often borrowed the
nominee's car. When I was one of The
Daily's news editors earlier this year, I
pushed a series of articles on Bill's wanton
spending habits with ASSU money.
It is expected that all journalists con
stantly endeavor to catch elected officials
screwing up, and it is equally expected that
elected officials accordingly have nothing
but contempt for journalists. Conventional
wisdom has it that such is the case in
national politics and media, and what's
printed in The Daily gives the distinct
impression that things are not different
here. "Boy, you sure made a new enemy
today," one friend commented after read
ing Shen's Friday letter.
The reality, however, is quite the oppo
site. Bill is one of my closest friends at
Stanford, and in fact most — if not all — of
us who run The Daily are on very good
terms with this frequent subject of our
coverage and criticisms.
The fact is that nearly all of us pick

friends based upon common interests — if
we didn't we'd soon run out of things to
talk about. When you consider that there
are probably a dozen of us on campus who
actually bother to worry about and closely
follow ASSU politics — and who are con
fused enough to want to do so — it is
inevitable that we'll end up as friends.
And thing aren't that different on a
national scale. Maybe Stanford, with its
fewer-than-20 campus-politics aficionados,
operates on a smaller scale than Washing
ton, but the nation's capital is still a fairly
insular community. The number may be in
the hundreds, hut there, like here,
reporters and politicians end up as friends
because they share a passionate interest. It
would be presumptuous to compare Daily
reporters to professional journalists, and
even more so to compare ASSU politicos to
real-world politicians, but I've never
claimed not to be presumptuous.
Most of us are conditioned to view the
relationship between journalists and
politicians through an "All the President's
Men" lens. There is no question that
Woodward and Bernstein — and in fact
nearly all of the reporters covering the
White House at the time — had a tremen
dous antipathy toward Nixon and his staff.
And the Nixonites, for their part, were
even more contemptuous of the reporters.
But the Nixon White House was one of
the least press-friendly in history, and
more often than not reporters and their
politician subjects share a great deal of
camaraderie. In the wake of Watergate

and the success of "All the President's
Men," journalism turned from a tradition
ally blue-collar trade to an newly white
collar profession. Reporters became
equals to the politicians they covered and,
increasingly, they became friends.
I worked at ABC News this summer,
and it was common knowledge there that
the man who was in charge of "Special
Events" — that is, the guy who ran cover
age of the conventions and of election
night — was buddies with George
Stephanopoulos.
Bob Cohn, the editor of Stanford Mag
azine and formerly Newsweek's White
House correspondent, allowed that dur
ing his time covering the president he
became friendly with spokesperson Dee
Dee Myers. Furthermore, he said, two
close friends worked in the White House,
although both friendships began before
the two started working for Clinton.
Today, not only are politicians and
reporters friends, in many cases they are
the same people. David Gergen hops back
and forth between U.S. News and World
Report and the White House. The New
York Times' William Safire, one of Ameri
ca's most influential columnists, got his
start at the Nixon White House, along with
Diane Sawyer. Stephanopoulos left the
White House last month to become an on
air commentator for ABC News.
T1 mdard argument against such
behavio - both the jumping between
political ufe and journalism and the close
relationships between reporters and public

officials — is that coverage becomes dis
torted, even if unintentionally, based upon
personal entanglements. No one can truly
believe that Stephanopoulos will break any
Clinton-scandal stories for his new net
work home, but in fairness no one at ABC
expects him to do so. But it does become
uncomfortable, as Cohn pointed out, to
write none-too-flattering things about
friendly figures, let alone friends.
Yes, it may be uncomfortable, but still,
regardless of what friendships have devel
oped, people go into journalism because
they believe in telling the truth and expos
ing wrongdoing. The Stephanopouloses of
the world notwithstanding, the Bob
Cohns will suck it up, offend their friends,
and report the truth.
In other words, I might be friends
with Bill, but I still hold him to tough
standards in the paper. That's what jour
nalists do. And Bill might be friends with
me, but he'll still write letters attacking
my columns for his own political gain.
That's what politicians do.
Jesse Oxfeld, a junior majoring in com
munication, remains firmly convinced
that President Shen gets worse coverage
from this paper than he would if none of
us were friends with him. After all, every
one gives their friends a hard time; we
just happen to have a daily newspaper at
our disposal to do it with.

inevitable that we'll end up as friends.
And thing aren't that different on a
national scale. Maybe Stanford, with its
fewer-than-20 campus-politics aficionados,
operates on a smaller scale than Washing
ton, but the nation's capital is still a fairly
insular community. The number may be in
the hundreds, hut there, like here,
reporters and politicians end up as friends
because they share a passionate interest. It
would be presumptuous to compare Daily
reporters to professional journalists, and
even more so to compare ASSU politicos to
real-world politicians, but I've never
claimed not to be presumptuous.
Most of us are conditioned to view the
relationship between journalists and
politicians through an "All the President's
Men" lens. There is no question that
Woodward and Bernstein — and in fact
nearly all of the reporters covering the
White House at the time — had a tremen
dous antipathy toward Nixon and his staff.
And the Nixonites, for their part, were
even more contemptuous of the reporters.
But the Nixon White House was one of
the least press-friendly in history, and
more often than not reporters and their
politician subjects share a great deal of
camaraderie. In the wake of Watergate

and the success of "All the President's
Men," journalism turned from a tradition
ally blue-collar trade to an newly white
collar profession. Reporters became
equals to the politicians they covered and,
increasingly, they became friends.
I worked at ABC News this summer,
and it was common knowledge there that
the man who was in charge of "Special
Events" — that is, the guy who ran cover
age of the conventions and of election
night — was buddies with George
Stephanopoulos.
Bob Cohn, the editor of Stanford Mag
azine and formerly Newsweek's White
House correspondent, allowed that dur
ing his time covering the president he
became friendly with spokesperson Dee
Dee Myers. Furthermore, he said, two
close friends worked in the White House,
although both friendships began before
the two started working for Clinton.
Today, not only are politicians and
reporters friends, in many cases they are
the same people. David Gergen hops back
and forth between U.S. News and World
Report and the White House. The New
York Times' William Safire, one of Ameri
ca's most influential columnists, got his
start at the Nixon White House, along with
Diane Sawyer. Stephanopoulos left the
White House last month to become an on
air commentator for ABC News.
T1 mdard argument against such
behavio - both the jumping between
political ufe and journalism and the close
relationships between reporters and public

officials — is that coverage becomes dis
torted, even if unintentionally, based upon
personal entanglements. No one can truly
believe that Stephanopoulos will break any
Clinton-scandal stories for his new net
work home, but in fairness no one at ABC
expects him to do so. But it does become
uncomfortable, as Cohn pointed out, to
write none-too-flattering things about
friendly figures, let alone friends.
Yes, it may be uncomfortable, but still,
regardless of what friendships have devel
oped, people go into journalism because
they believe in telling the truth and expos
ing wrongdoing. The Stephanopouloses of
the world notwithstanding, the Bob
Cohns will suck it up, offend their friends,
and report the truth.
In other words, I might be friends
with Bill, but I still hold him to tough
standards in the paper. That's what jour
nalists do. And Bill might be friends with
me, but he'll still write letters attacking
my columns for his own political gain.
That's what politicians do.
Jesse Oxfeld, a junior majoring in com
munication, remains firmly convinced
that President Shen gets worse coverage
from this paper than he would if none of
us were friends with him. After all, every
one gives their friends a hard time; we
just happen to have a daily newspaper at
our disposal to do it with.
