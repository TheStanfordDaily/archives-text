## Comeback win Cardinal women rally to beat Ducks 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Oregon
had the Stanford Cardinal in the
grave ready for burial, but the
Ducks lost the shovel.
The third-ranked Cardinal
(25-1, 13-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), depleted and playing in
McArthur Court (one of the
most hostile arenas in the
league), rallied from a seven
point deficit midway through
the second half to pull out a
gutsy 69-66 win over an Oregon
team (16-6, 9-4) that has now
lost to Stanford 20 straight
times.
Junior center Olympia Scott
played a disciplined game, stay
ing out of foul trouble and post
ing 13 points and grabbing
seven rebounds, many of those
on the offensive end in the final
minutes of the contest. Senior
forward Kate Starbird scored 30
points, including a long three
pointer from the right wing with
the shot clock winding down
that gave the Cardinal a 66-60
lead with 2 minutes, 16 seconds
to go in the game.
"I just think this was a major
gut check for our team," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "You learned a lot
about how much character they
have and how hard they play."
All week long, the talk in Ore
gon was about this being the
year of the Duck. Oregon head
coach Jody Runge talked about
having to beat Stanford "on a
consistent basis" to go to the
next level. Never mind the
Ducks have not beaten the Card
once since freshman guard
Christina Batastini was in the
third grade.
Nevertheless, if there was
ever a time to knock off the Car
dinal, it was in this nationally
televised game. The Ducks knew
it, the 6,106 fans that packed
The Pit knew it, and Stanford
knew it. With no Heather Owen,
no Naomi Mulitauaopele (both
were injured and did not make
the trip) and only Scott down
low, there was no margin for
error.
"It was really hard," Scott
said. "The focus was on me stay
ing out of foul trouble, and it
was hard because other people
got into foul trouble, which
made it detrimental to the game
plan."
It became really detrimental
when Oregon led 27-19 at the
12:34 mark. Freshman center
Jenny Mowe was wreaking
havoc down low, scoring six
points in a little over a minute
while drawing sophomore center
Chandra Benton's third foul in
only her third minute of play.
Still trailing 34-27 four min
utes before halftime, Stanford
went on a 9-0 run. Scott took
Mowe to the hole for a layup and
then Starbird nailed her team's
only three of the first half with
2:44 left. Now within two, junior
forward Paula McNamee made
two big plays down low that
shifted the momentum and gave
the Cardinal a 36-34 halftime
lead. First she drew Mowe's sec
ond foul and hit both free
throws, and the next time down,
she skied for a tip-in bucket with
46 seconds to go.
"I thought Paula really
helped us," VanDerveer said of
McNamee, who finished with
career highs of eight points and

seven rebounds in 15 minutes of
action. "She went in, she
rebounded, she hit her free
throws and made some really
nice plays for us."
Stanford may have had the
lead, but it also had foul trouble
to contend with. Along with
Benton's three, Scott already
had two fouls. This did not bode
well, especially with Mowe scor
ing nine points in 10 minutes of
play and the officials going into
their usual fog in the second
half.
It started with Mowe some
how getting her third foul at the
top of the key five minutes into
it. Then Oregon got into fine
flopping form, drawing more
phantom calls than a seance on
Halloween. On successive pos
sessions, Starbird and junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard drew
their second and third fouls,
respectively, on weak acting jobs
by sophomore Duck guard Lisa
Bowyer.
Because most of these fouls
occurred before Stanford could
formulate a shot, Oregon was
able to rally for a 50-43 advan
tage with 11:33 to go. The Car
dinal chipped away at the lead
and Starbird had a chance to
give her team a 51-50 lead and
also put herself in second place
on Stanford's all-time scoring
list — but missed a driving
layup.
Oregon responded with a
three-pointer by senior point
guard Cindie Edamura for a 53-
49 lead with 8:34 to go. A lesser
team could have folded, especial
ly with McNamee, Nygaard and
Benton sitting with four fouls,
but the resilient Cardinal erased
Oregon's lead and battled ahead.
The team "wasn't going to
just say, 'Oh we don't have Omi,
or we don't have Heather,"'
VanDerveer said. "They're here
to play, and I respect them. I'm
really happy for this team and
how they dug in."
Scott hit two free throws
after Mowe's fourth foul, fol
lowed by a Starbird three from
the right wing. After the Ducks
threw the ball away on their
end, Starbird was on the line for
two free throws. She swished
the first one, but the second one
was off target. McNamee once
again beat everyone to the ball
and nudged it in for a 57-53
lead. What did Oregon have to
do to break through against the
Cardinal?
Certainly not what Runge did
in the final moments of the
game. After the Ducks took the
lead and senior point guard
Jamila Wideman tied it up at 59-
59 on a driving layup, the Ore
gon head coach decided to call a
timeout with four minutes left.
Considering there was a media
timeout coming up at the next
dead ball and it was a grueling
game, timeouts were of the
essence.
"I just wanted to make sure
everybody was clear on the plan
was on different defenses,"
Runge said. "They were switch
ing defenses, and I just wanted
to make sure they were ready for
it."
It did not help. Mowe fouled
out 33 seconds later after reach
ing in on Nygaard, who knocked
in a layup to give Stanford the
lead for good. After getting off to
a fast start before halftime,
Mowe did not shoot once,
missed three free throws and
turned the ball over four times
in the second half while failing
miserably to exploit Stanford's
foul trouble down low.
With the score 63-60 two min
utes later, the Cardinal took it
down the court but was bogged
down offensively, prompting a
timeout by VanDerveer with 3.6
seconds on the shot clock. With
little time, Stanford went for a
double screen that sprang Star
bird free as she curled toward the
inbounder on the right wing. Ore
gon never had a chance as the
senior forward buried it for a six
point lead.
"I think you saw why Kate is
an Ail-American with that shot
she hit," VanDerveer said.
"She's real tough."
After cutting it to 67-62, Ore
gon put no pressure on any of
Stanford's ball handlers, allow
ing Stanford to run down the
clock to well under a minute.
The Ducks also looked lost on
the offensive end as a wild 25-
footer missed badly and was
rebounded by Starbird, who was
fouled with 18 seconds left. Her
two free throws made it 69-62
and forced Runge to swallow
another loss to Stanford.
"I don't know quite what to
say about that," Runge said of
her strategy. "I just get real
tired of people not having the
idea that we can beat Stanford."

' While Oregon pouted, the
Cardinal believed it gained
invaluable experience for the
NCAA tournament in having to
play a close game against a
tough team on the road.
"We have to learn how to stay
composed and run our plays,"
Scott said. "In the end, Starbird
hit a big three, but we ran the
play; we ran the screen, got her
open and she hit it. It was a
good experience because it's
similar to the postseason. It's
more mental than physical."

EUGENE, Ore. — Oregon
had the Stanford Cardinal in the
grave ready for burial, but the
Ducks lost the shovel.
The third-ranked Cardinal
(25-1, 13-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), depleted and playing in
McArthur Court (one of the
most hostile arenas in the
league), rallied from a seven
point deficit midway through
the second half to pull out a
gutsy 69-66 win over an Oregon
team (16-6, 9-4) that has now
lost to Stanford 20 straight
times.
Junior center Olympia Scott
played a disciplined game, stay
ing out of foul trouble and post
ing 13 points and grabbing
seven rebounds, many of those
on the offensive end in the final
minutes of the contest. Senior
forward Kate Starbird scored 30
points, including a long three
pointer from the right wing with
the shot clock winding down
that gave the Cardinal a 66-60
lead with 2 minutes, 16 seconds
to go in the game.
"I just think this was a major
gut check for our team," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "You learned a lot
about how much character they
have and how hard they play."
All week long, the talk in Ore
gon was about this being the
year of the Duck. Oregon head
coach Jody Runge talked about
having to beat Stanford "on a
consistent basis" to go to the
next level. Never mind the
Ducks have not beaten the Card
once since freshman guard
Christina Batastini was in the
third grade.
Nevertheless, if there was
ever a time to knock off the Car
dinal, it was in this nationally
televised game. The Ducks knew
it, the 6,106 fans that packed
The Pit knew it, and Stanford
knew it. With no Heather Owen,
no Naomi Mulitauaopele (both
were injured and did not make
the trip) and only Scott down
low, there was no margin for
error.
"It was really hard," Scott
said. "The focus was on me stay
ing out of foul trouble, and it
was hard because other people
got into foul trouble, which
made it detrimental to the game
plan."
It became really detrimental
when Oregon led 27-19 at the
12:34 mark. Freshman center
Jenny Mowe was wreaking
havoc down low, scoring six
points in a little over a minute
while drawing sophomore center
Chandra Benton's third foul in
only her third minute of play.
Still trailing 34-27 four min
utes before halftime, Stanford
went on a 9-0 run. Scott took
Mowe to the hole for a layup and
then Starbird nailed her team's
only three of the first half with
2:44 left. Now within two, junior
forward Paula McNamee made
two big plays down low that
shifted the momentum and gave
the Cardinal a 36-34 halftime
lead. First she drew Mowe's sec
ond foul and hit both free
throws, and the next time down,
she skied for a tip-in bucket with
46 seconds to go.
"I thought Paula really
helped us," VanDerveer said of
McNamee, who finished with
career highs of eight points and

seven rebounds in 15 minutes of
action. "She went in, she
rebounded, she hit her free
throws and made some really
nice plays for us."
Stanford may have had the
lead, but it also had foul trouble
to contend with. Along with
Benton's three, Scott already
had two fouls. This did not bode
well, especially with Mowe scor
ing nine points in 10 minutes of
play and the officials going into
their usual fog in the second
half.
It started with Mowe some
how getting her third foul at the
top of the key five minutes into
it. Then Oregon got into fine
flopping form, drawing more
phantom calls than a seance on
Halloween. On successive pos
sessions, Starbird and junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard drew
their second and third fouls,
respectively, on weak acting jobs
by sophomore Duck guard Lisa
Bowyer.
Because most of these fouls
occurred before Stanford could
formulate a shot, Oregon was
able to rally for a 50-43 advan
tage with 11:33 to go. The Car
dinal chipped away at the lead
and Starbird had a chance to
give her team a 51-50 lead and
also put herself in second place
on Stanford's all-time scoring
list — but missed a driving
layup.
Oregon responded with a
three-pointer by senior point
guard Cindie Edamura for a 53-
49 lead with 8:34 to go. A lesser
team could have folded, especial
ly with McNamee, Nygaard and
Benton sitting with four fouls,
but the resilient Cardinal erased
Oregon's lead and battled ahead.
The team "wasn't going to
just say, 'Oh we don't have Omi,
or we don't have Heather,"'
VanDerveer said. "They're here
to play, and I respect them. I'm
really happy for this team and
how they dug in."
Scott hit two free throws
after Mowe's fourth foul, fol
lowed by a Starbird three from
the right wing. After the Ducks
threw the ball away on their
end, Starbird was on the line for
two free throws. She swished
the first one, but the second one
was off target. McNamee once
again beat everyone to the ball
and nudged it in for a 57-53
lead. What did Oregon have to
do to break through against the
Cardinal?
Certainly not what Runge did
in the final moments of the
game. After the Ducks took the
lead and senior point guard
Jamila Wideman tied it up at 59-
59 on a driving layup, the Ore
gon head coach decided to call a
timeout with four minutes left.
Considering there was a media
timeout coming up at the next
dead ball and it was a grueling
game, timeouts were of the
essence.
"I just wanted to make sure
everybody was clear on the plan
was on different defenses,"
Runge said. "They were switch
ing defenses, and I just wanted
to make sure they were ready for
it."
It did not help. Mowe fouled
out 33 seconds later after reach
ing in on Nygaard, who knocked
in a layup to give Stanford the
lead for good. After getting off to
a fast start before halftime,
Mowe did not shoot once,
missed three free throws and
turned the ball over four times
in the second half while failing
miserably to exploit Stanford's
foul trouble down low.
With the score 63-60 two min
utes later, the Cardinal took it
down the court but was bogged
down offensively, prompting a
timeout by VanDerveer with 3.6
seconds on the shot clock. With
little time, Stanford went for a
double screen that sprang Star
bird free as she curled toward the
inbounder on the right wing. Ore
gon never had a chance as the
senior forward buried it for a six
point lead.
"I think you saw why Kate is
an Ail-American with that shot
she hit," VanDerveer said.
"She's real tough."
After cutting it to 67-62, Ore
gon put no pressure on any of
Stanford's ball handlers, allow
ing Stanford to run down the
clock to well under a minute.
The Ducks also looked lost on
the offensive end as a wild 25-
footer missed badly and was
rebounded by Starbird, who was
fouled with 18 seconds left. Her
two free throws made it 69-62
and forced Runge to swallow
another loss to Stanford.
"I don't know quite what to
say about that," Runge said of
her strategy. "I just get real
tired of people not having the
idea that we can beat Stanford."

' While Oregon pouted, the

open and she hit it. It was a
good experience because it's
