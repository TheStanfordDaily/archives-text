# Men's basketball silences Ducks
## Three-guard lineup plays instrumental role in win 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
The 20th-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team (15-6, 8-5
Pacific 10 Conference) continued
to enjoy some fine home cooking
Saturday night, recording an 83-
61 victory over Oregon (14-8, 5-
8) within the friendly confines of
Maples Pavilion.
"At home, there's definitely a
comfort zone," said sophomore
guard Arthur Lee. "When you
get down, you're feeling a little
down on yourself, but the crowd
is always there to pick you up."
The Cardinal didn't find itself
down too much against the
Ducks, however, jumping out to
a 24-8 lead with 10 minutes, 24
seconds to go in the first half and
never looking back. The strong
start was fueled by tough defense
and the hot outside shooting of
Stanford's relatively new three
guard starting lineup.
"It was keyed by pretty good
defense basically," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "I
thought we played really hard.
"We felt like we needed to play
smaller because of the way they
were pressuring with their
perimeter people. We were able
to get some penetration and drop
the ball off some. That's pretty
much why we went and stayed
with three guards, to get pene
tration and ball movement."
Lee, All-American senior
Brevin Knight and sophomore
Kris Weems formed the Cardinal
backcourt triumvirate and bomb
squad that shot the lights out in
the first half. The three com
bined for 30 of Stanford's 39
first-half points. Lee started out
on fire, draining jump shot after
jump shot at the outset of the
game, scoring 13 of his 15 points
in the opening period.
"I'm feeling more comfort
able" with the three-guard setup,
Lee said. "As long as I'm out
there, I have no problems shoot
ing the ball. It's working fine, so
I have no problems with it."
Not to be outdone, Weems
also let loose with a barrage of
long balls, converting on 3-of-6
from behind the arc for the game.
He helped key the first-half run
by scoring seven straight points

to give Stanford the commanding
24-8 lead. Weems, like Lee, fin
ished with 15 points.
"They were a little bit harder
to guard with Arthur Lee," said
Oregon head coach Jerry Green.
"He was making some shots for
them, and it makes them more
balanced on the perimeter. All
three of their perimeter people
really shot the ball well."
As for Knight, Brevin was
simply being Brevin. Knight, the
elder statesman and mentor of
the newly formed guard corps,
placed himself in elite company
Saturday night with his 16-point,
eight-assist performance which
made him the only Pac-10 player
besides current NBA All-Star
Gary Payton to record more than
1,500 points and 700 assists.
"Brevin is just a great pene
trator and pitch man," Green
said. "It all starts with Knight
and that great penetration. I'm
glad Brevin's graduating, by the
way."
The Ducks were able to cut
the lead to 10 points by halftime
but were never able to get any
closer. Sophomore forward Peter
Sauer had a big second half with
14 points to finish the game with
16 points and 10 rebounds.
Freshman Mark Madsen also
chipped in with 10 boards, step
ping in nicely on the inside for
sophomore center Tim Young,
who once again saw limited play
ing time due to a sore back.
"I thought Madsen had a pret
ty good ball game," Montgomery
said. "He's able to compete phys
ically in there where Tim is real
ly hurting right now and just
can't get much done. He's very
good on the boards and good
defensively. He does give us a
physical presence inside."
Madsen's work was well
appreciated by Cardinal fans in
what turned out to be a rough
and-tumble basketball game.
Stanford managed to dominate
physically on the glass,
rebounding Oregon 43-33 as well
as containing most of the Ducks'
scorers. Combine that with a
scorching 61.5 field-goal percent
age in the second half, and the
Ducks simply had no chance.

Sophomore guard Kris Weems launches a three-pointer in Stan
ford's 83-61 romp over Oregon. Weems hit 3-of-6 three-point
attempts in the game.
"This was as rough of a basket
ball game as [I've seen] in the 28
years I've ever been associated with
[the sport]," Green said. Stanford
"shot the ball exceptionally well
and rebounded it well. I thought
they beat us in every way — just an
old fashioned rear-ending."
The only Duck to get on track
was point guard Kenya Wilkins
who had a game-high 24 points but
only two assists. No other Oregon
player had more than eight points,
including three-point bomber
Jamal Lawrence, who had 29
points in the two teams' meeting
earlier this year.
"Wilkins hurt us, but I think he
shot the ball a little more than they
would have liked — too much in
their scheme of things," Mont
gomery said. "We felt like
[Lawrence] was the key, with him
having 29 [earlier this year]. I chal
lenged Kris and I think he did a
*great job not giving Lawrence
*Tnany good looks."
The two wins give new life to a
Cardinal team that looked shell
shocked after losing three in a row
on the road prior to the homes
tand. But Stanford now has to take
its show back on the road against
Washington State and Washington
and see if it can translate the suc
cess at home to wins on the road.
"We're not dead yet," Mont
gomery said. "We needed two
wins this week and we got them.
These two wins were obviously
critical. Coming off three losses
you never know where you stand

mentally or physically."
"We just have to look at it as no
matter where we play basketball,
we just have to play basketball,"
Lee said. "Be it the road or [home],
we just have to remember that bas
ketball is basketball no matter
where it is. As long as we put the
ball through the hoop and play
good defense, we can beat anybody.
That's the mindset we have to take
with us. We've had our wake-up
call. We don't need any more."

The 20th-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team (15-6, 8-5
Pacific 10 Conference) continued
to enjoy some fine home cooking
Saturday night, recording an 83-
61 victory over Oregon (14-8, 5-
8) within the friendly confines of
Maples Pavilion.
"At home, there's definitely a
comfort zone," said sophomore
guard Arthur Lee. "When you
get down, you're feeling a little
down on yourself, but the crowd
is always there to pick you up."
The Cardinal didn't find itself
down too much against the
Ducks, however, jumping out to
a 24-8 lead with 10 minutes, 24
seconds to go in the first half and
never looking back. The strong
start was fueled by tough defense
and the hot outside shooting of
Stanford's relatively new three
guard starting lineup.
"It was keyed by pretty good
defense basically," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "I
thought we played really hard.
"We felt like we needed to play
smaller because of the way they
were pressuring with their
perimeter people. We were able
to get some penetration and drop
the ball off some. That's pretty
much why we went and stayed
with three guards, to get pene
tration and ball movement."
Lee, All-American senior
Brevin Knight and sophomore
Kris Weems formed the Cardinal
backcourt triumvirate and bomb
squad that shot the lights out in
the first half. The three com
bined for 30 of Stanford's 39
first-half points. Lee started out
on fire, draining jump shot after
jump shot at the outset of the
game, scoring 13 of his 15 points
in the opening period.
"I'm feeling more comfort
able" with the three-guard setup,
Lee said. "As long as I'm out
there, I have no problems shoot
ing the ball. It's working fine, so
I have no problems with it."
Not to be outdone, Weems
also let loose with a barrage of
long balls, converting on 3-of-6
from behind the arc for the game.
He helped key the first-half run
by scoring seven straight points

to give Stanford the commanding
24-8 lead. Weems, like Lee, fin
ished with 15 points.
"They were a little bit harder
to guard with Arthur Lee," said
Oregon head coach Jerry Green.
"He was making some shots for
them, and it makes them more
balanced on the perimeter. All
three of their perimeter people
really shot the ball well."
As for Knight, Brevin was
simply being Brevin. Knight, the
elder statesman and mentor of
the newly formed guard corps,
placed himself in elite company
Saturday night with his 16-point,
eight-assist performance which
made him the only Pac-10 player
besides current NBA All-Star
Gary Payton to record more than
1,500 points and 700 assists.
"Brevin is just a great pene
trator and pitch man," Green
said. "It all starts with Knight
and that great penetration. I'm
glad Brevin's graduating, by the
way."
The Ducks were able to cut
the lead to 10 points by halftime
but were never able to get any
closer. Sophomore forward Peter
Sauer had a big second half with
14 points to finish the game with
16 points and 10 rebounds.
Freshman Mark Madsen also
chipped in with 10 boards, step
ping in nicely on the inside for
sophomore center Tim Young,
who once again saw limited play
ing time due to a sore back.
"I thought Madsen had a pret
ty good ball game," Montgomery
said. "He's able to compete phys
ically in there where Tim is real
ly hurting right now and just
can't get much done. He's very
good on the boards and good
defensively. He does give us a
physical presence inside."
Madsen's work was well
appreciated by Cardinal fans in
what turned out to be a rough
and-tumble basketball game.
Stanford managed to dominate
physically on the glass,
rebounding Oregon 43-33 as well
as containing most of the Ducks'
scorers. Combine that with a
scorching 61.5 field-goal percent
age in the second half, and the
Ducks simply had no chance.

Sophomore guard Kris Weems launches a three-pointer in Stan
ford's 83-61 romp over Oregon. Weems hit 3-of-6 three-point
attempts in the game.
"This was as rough of a basket
ball game as [I've seen] in the 28
years I've ever been associated with
[the sport]," Green said. Stanford
"shot the ball exceptionally well
and rebounded it well. I thought
they beat us in every way — just an
old fashioned rear-ending."
The only Duck to get on track
was point guard Kenya Wilkins
who had a game-high 24 points but
only two assists. No other Oregon
player had more than eight points,
including three-point bomber
Jamal Lawrence, who had 29
points in the two teams' meeting
earlier this year.
"Wilkins hurt us, but I think he
shot the ball a little more than they
would have liked — too much in
their scheme of things," Mont
gomery said. "We felt like
[Lawrence] was the key, with him
having 29 [earlier this year]. I chal
lenged Kris and I think he did a
*great job not giving Lawrence
*Tnany good looks."
The two wins give new life to a
Cardinal team that looked shell
shocked after losing three in a row
on the road prior to the homes
tand. But Stanford now has to take
its show back on the road against
Washington State and Washington
and see if it can translate the suc
cess at home to wins on the road.
"We're not dead yet," Mont
gomery said. "We needed two
wins this week and we got them.
These two wins were obviously
critical. Coming off three losses
you never know where you stand

mentally or physically."
"We just have to look at it as no
matter where we play basketball,
we just have to play basketball,"
Lee said. "Be it the road or [home],
we just have to remember that bas
ketball is basketball no matter
where it is. As long as we put the
ball through the hoop and play
good defense, we can beat anybody.
That's the mindset we have to take
with us. We've had our wake-up
call. We don't need any more."
