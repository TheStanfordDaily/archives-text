# Reliance on perimeter shooting is troubling
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Don't be fooled by the Cardi
nal's 83-61 victory over the Ore
gon Ducks on Saturday — this
team could still be in some seri
ous trouble. With redshirt
sophomore center Tim Young
continuing to be hampered by
back pain, and freshman Mark
Madsen and junior Pete Van
Elswyk continuing to struggle
on the offensive end of the floor,
Stanford has become a team
that simply lives by the jump
shot and dies by the jump shot.
"There's no question that we
set this thing up to be a little
more inside-oriented," said Car
dinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "But with Tim out, we
are not going to be able to go
inside as much, so we are just
going to have to adjust."
That adjustment took the

form of a three-guard starting
lineup Saturday, with senior
point guard Brevin Knight and
sophomores Kris Weems and
Arthur Lee posing the outside
threat for the Cardinal.
On Saturday, the trio deliv
ered. The three shot a combined
18-for-37 from the field, includ
ing 7-of-17 from behind the
three-point line, and accounted
for 46 of Stanford's 83 points.
"They shot the ball very well
from the outside," said Oregon
head coach Jerry Green. "They
are a little harder to guard with
Arthur Lee in there. With Lee
making shots they are more bal
anced on the perimeter, and I
think that was the difference."
It certainly isn't terrible to
place such a burden on Knight,
Weems and Lee, but Stanford
has shown this year that if the
shots are not falling, the team
isn't going to win. More specifi

cally, if the guards are not at or
near the 50-percent mark from
the floor, the Cardinal will lose.
In fact. Stanford is 6-0 when
shooting over 50 percent but
just 8-6 when under that mark.
With no offensive inside game to
rely on. the pressure has mount
ed for the guards.
"We've been in a slump in
terms of our big men scoring,"
said Lee, who finished with 15
points against the Ducks. "We
knew that we had to compensate
for the inside troubles with the
outside game, and the past two
games it has been for
us."
With the insertion of Lee into
the starting lineup, the team has
had to adjust to a different style
of play that has involved more
running and certainly more out
side shooting.
"We have been working to
have more games when we are

shooting well than not," Lee
said. "We have been working
after practice on our shots so we
can make the adjustments in the
game.
"What we have to realize is
that when the shots aren't going
down, we need to play good
defense, get loose balls, and get
offensive and defensive
rebounds."
It is important to note that
Madsen and Van Elswyk also
have shown improvement in the
last few games. The reserve duo
accounted for 12 rebounds Sat
urday as well as two blocks each
— all of which will be needed for
the Cardinal shooters to get
open looks in the future.
"Madsen's making progress,"
Montgomery said. "He's still not
very polished offensively, but
he's very good on the boards;
he's very good defensively and he
gives a physical presence on the
inside."
With the improvement of the
big men, Montgomery said Stan
ford's guards will also need to play
wiser to win.
"I think we have to be smarter
with our shot selection," Mont

gomery said. "It's just a learning
process, and I think we are doing a
better job."
Stanford will be on the road
this week, where the squad has
shot an abysmal 39 percent from
the floor. The Cardinal has his
torically struggled on the Wash
ington road trip and needs at
least a split to have a chance at a
decent seed in the NCAA tourna
ment.
Otherwise, the Cardinal may
indeed die by the jump shot.
