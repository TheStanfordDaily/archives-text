The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball
team suffered an agonizing road loss at the
hands of the No. 2 Brigham Young Cougars
Friday night. The Cardinal, coming off of a
very strong victory over the 49ers of Long
Beach State, had high hopes for Friday,
and, at least early on, it appeared that these
hopes might be realized, as Stanford
stormed to take an early lead in the match,
capturing the first game over the Cougars
15-13.
"We got off to a really good start in the
match and, overall, played well in game
one," said head coach Ruben Nieves. "We
served well and sided out pretty consistently
also."
After letting game one slip away, the
Cougars would not be denied in the next two
games. Buoyed by the support of 4,784 rabid
fans at the Smith Field House, the team
asserted itself, clawing its way back into the
match and leveling thing√ü with a 15-11 vic
tory in game two.

In game three, it appeared as though the
wheels had fallen off the Cardinal train, as
the Cougars trounced Stanford 15-4, thor
oughly beating the Cardinal in every aspect
of the game. Poor serving on Stanford's part,
combined with outstanding blocking and dig
ging of the part of the Cougars allowed BYU
the lopsided victory in game three.
After two consecutive losses, the Cardinal
regrouped and came out onto the court for
game four with renewed determination.
Despite improved play by Stanford, the
Cougars appeared to have the match sewn
up, as they ran out to a 14-10 lead. After
yielding this lead, the Stanford defense took
over, yielding just two points to the Cougars
over the next 16 rotations in a remarkable
display of sideouts. This outstanding defen
sive effort allowed the Cardinal to capture a
critical victory in the game 17-16, extending
the match to a fifth and final game.
By NCAA rules, the format of the fifth
game changes from regular scoring to rally
scoring, meaning that whoever wins a rally,
regardless of whether that team is
serving or not. captures the point.
This format makes for unpre
dictable games, as the final game
against the Cougars proved to be.
Stanford started strong, lead
ing 2-0. After falling behind early,
BYU countered, taking the lead at
8-6. Stanford got a sideout to
close the gap to 8-7, then fresh
man outside hitter Andy Witt
served two straight points, allow
ing Stanford to go up 9-8. After
taking a timeout, BYU regrouped,
and a big stuff block by Cougar
sophomore Ryan Millar on Stan
ford senior outside hitter Matt
Fucrbringer tied the match. On
match point, the game was decid
ed bv a Stanford error, as senior

middle blocker Matt Hoefer hit a
set into the net, sealing the victo
ry for the Cougars.
Two major factors figured into
the close loss: Stanford's poor
serving and the superior blocking
of BYU. Over the course of the
match, the Cardinal put up 11
aces yet suffered 32 service
errors. By contrast, the Cougars
only had 20 service errors. But in
what may be the most telling
statistic of the match, the small
er, quicker Cougars stifled Stan
ford's big, physical front row,
recording 29 blocks to the Cardi
nal's nine. While these two stats
alone do not tell the entire story,
they do tell a lot.
"We did not play that well,"
Nieves said. "We served strong,
with the aces, but we can't have
as many errors as we did. I don't
feel that we are firing on all cylin
ders yet."
