# Conference home opener
## Volleyball sets up for big game 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford campus is in for a treat when the
Cardinal men's volleyball team opens its home
conference season against the Gauchos of UC-
Santa Barbara tonight at 7 in Burn ham Pavilion.
Two things about this match give it added mean
ing for the Cardinal: Stanford badly needs a win,
and it is looking to avenge last year's loss to Santa
Barbara which eliminated Stanford from the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament,
preventing the Cardinal from advancing tc the
NCAA Final Four.
After Friday's tough five-game loss to BYU,
Stanford needs to get back to its winning ways
tonight in order to keep from falling too far behind
the leading teams in the MPSF. After suffering a
loss to division rival USC, the Car
dinal simply cannot afford slipping
too far behind the Trojans, who, as
of late, have been playing very good
volleyball. This match is as close to
a must-win match as any this early
in the season.
While Stanford will be looking
for a win, the Gauchos do not fig
ure to let the Cardinal roll over
them. As they proved last year,
when they lost in the final round of
the MPSF tournament, missing
the Final Four by just that one
match, Santa Barbara is a very
good volleyball team.
The Gauchos have proven last
year's play was no fluke, already
this year having beaten Hawaii and
UCLA, two of the top teams in the
country, on the road. Based on this
impressive road record, as well as
their first-place ranking in their
division, Stanford knows it must be
ready.
"They're a really stiff chal

lenge," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "This should be a really
hard fought match. They beat us
last year in the tournament, so our
guys are looking to get back at
them. They were the one other
team in the country last year that
had a legitimate chance at receiv
ing the at-large bid to the NCAA
Championship."
The Cauchos will look to seniors
Donme Harris, an outside hitter,
and Rob Treahy, a middle blocker,
for leadership. Both Harris and
Treahy were central figures on last
year's team. Harris has been
among the NCAA leaders in kills
per game all year and will look to
continue putting up impressive
offensive numbers in tonight's
match. In addition, both Treahy
and Harris are among the NCAA
leaders in blocks per game, just
behind Stanford's senior Matt
Hoefer, the national leader in this
category.
"Harris and Treahy are real key
players for Santa Barbara," said
Nieves. Both are veteran players
and are good leaders. How they
play is critical."
