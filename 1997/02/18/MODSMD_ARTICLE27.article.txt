# Mavericks fall, Cougars tie
## Wrestlers put in consistent effort 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
Before this weekend the
wrestling team had only seen
glimpses of excellent wrestling.
Each match seemed to produce
several good performances, but
the overall team performance
was not what it could have been.
On Friday, Stanford, in its final
regular-season dual meet,
changed all that by turning in
two fine performances against
solid competition.
The Card handily defeated
the No. 8 (in Division II) Manka
to State Mavericks 26-15 before
battling to a tie against the
Brigham Young Cougars 19-19.
These solid performances have
given the Cardinal the confi
dence and momentum it needs
going into the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships on March
2-3 at Arizona State.
Against the Mavericks, fresh
man Zach Zimmerer started
things off for the Card with a pin
at 126 pounds. At 142 pounds,
freshman Warren McPherson
followed with a commanding
major decision victory over
junior Troy Szydel 19-11.
Sophomore 150-pounder B.J.
Sanchez pinned sophomore
Kelly Block 2 minutes, 9 seconds
into the match, and junior 158-
pounder Jeff Grant edged out
sophomore Beau Lucier 4-2.
Ninth-ranked junior Scott
Chapman continued to wrestle
well by dominating his opponent
en route to a 14-5 major decision
victory over senior Steve
Friedrichs. Heavyweight senior

Chris Serjak was also a victor for
Stanford by winning a tight one
against freshman Ryan Tettke
6-5.
"I feel good about the dual
meet because of the team's
effort," said Stanford coach
Chris Horpel. "The guys wres
tled with a lot of heart. Though
there were some technical
errors, I have to be somewhat
happy about such a solid effort."
Against BYU, the Card start
ed out slowly, losing its first
three matches. At 134 pounds,
sophomore Frank Ruiz lost a
heartbreaker in sudden-death
overtime. Opting for the bottom
position in the 30-second over
time session, Ruiz was almost
able to escape, which would have
given him the match, but his
opponent held on to earn the vic
tory.
"I guess it's best that we tied
BYU," Horpel said. "Since I took
BYU coach Mark Schultz's
nephew and niece to the match,
it is probably for the best that
nobody lost."
At 142 pounds, McPherson
turned in a dramatic perfor
mance by winning his match 3-2
with a takedown as time expired.
Sanchez continued his strong
evening of wrestling by defeat
ing senior Greg Schroeder 14-5.
At 167 pounds, BYU forfeited to
Chapman, opting to take on
sophomore Shane Cross instead.
Cross came through in the
clutch by beating freshman
Jason Johnson 3-1.

Friday. The Cardinal defeated Mankato State 25-16 and tied
BYU 19-19.
Tim Kendall turned in a perfor
mance described by Hopel as the
"match of his life." Kendall, again
wrestling up a weight from his
usual 177 pounds, worked his way
to a 7-3 victory over freshman
Brandon Ruiz.
"We did it finally," McPhersen

said. "We have been looking for a
solid team performance and this
weekend we accomplished just
that. We did all we could to end the
dual meet season on a positive
note."
The Cardinal now have 12 days
to prepare for the Pac-10 champi
onships. Practices will intensify,
and challenge matches will take
place at three or four weight class
es to decide who will wrestle at the
Pac-lOs.
