# Baseball wins two nailbiters vs. Broncos
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
Warning: Anyone with a heart condition is
strongly advised against boarding this roller
coaster.
This warning should have been given to the
players, coaches and fans alike who witnessed
this nail-biting baseball series. The Cardinal
and the Santa Clara Broncos fought to the last
out in all three games this weekend, making
for a phenomenal series.
The fourth-ranked Stanford team won the
series, improving to 9-4, while the Broncos fell
to 3-5.
On Saturday it was senior left fielder Chris
Clark's heroic home run with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning that broke a tie to
give Stanford a 9-8 victory over the Broncos at
Sunken Diamond.
On Sunday the Broncos' Todd Hughes pro
duced the game-winning pinch-hit in his first
career at bat, giving Santa Clara a 6-5 win in
the bottom of the 10th inning at Buck Shaw
Stadium.
And, in the third game of the series yester
day, freshman right fielder Edmund Muth
drilled a two-run homer in the bottom of the
eighth inning that broke a 6-6 tie,earning the
Card a come-from-behind 8-6 victory in its
next-to-last at bat.
"These are real good games," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We came back
very well, and that was a good sign."
After the first two Stanford batters in the
ninth were retired in game one, the stage was
set for Clark. With two outs and a full count,
Clark drilled his third home run of the season
to left-center field, giving Stanford the
thrilling victory.
"Chris has produced for us," Marquess said
on KZSU. "He has been a key player for us."
Game one was not quite the pitcher's duel
that was anticipated, as it included six lead
changes, six doubles and four home runs.
Sophomore closer Tony Cogan (1-1) picked up
the win after finishing for junior starter Kyle
Peterson while Vince Boyanich (0-1) was sad
dled with the loss. After his spectacular 17-
strikeout performance the weekend before
against Fresno State, Peterson struck out
eight Broncos but allowed four doubles and
one home run.
The Cardinal offense scored four runs in a
big fourth inning. Junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer led off with a line-drive single and was fol
lowed by senior first baseman Luke Quaccia's
first home run of the season. Clark then beat
out an infield single and was advanced by
junior Jay Pecci's single. Junior Joe Kliburg's
single loaded the bases, and Clark scored on a
wild pitch. With two outs, Muth laid down and
beat out a perfect bunt, scoring Pecci from
third.
Sunday's heroic come-from-behind victory
belonged to Santa Clara. In game two, the
Card got out to an early 3-0 lead in the first
inning. Kilburg led off the game with a stand
up double, and Muth followed with a walk.
Freshman designated hitter John Gall bunted
and reached on a Bronco error, loading the
bases. Kilburg scored on a single by SchaefTer,
and Muth scored on a wild pitch by Bronco

starter Mike Crudale. Gall was driven in on a
sacrifice fly by Quaccia.
Sophomore Jody Gerut added a home run
and Gall had two doubles, but the Stanford
offense wasn't able to capitalize as it left 11
runners on base.
Santa Clara tied the game with three runs
in the second, and the teams exchanged runs
until the game was sent into extra innings
with the score tied 5-5.
The Card was held scoreless in the top of
the 10th, but the Broncos scored on a two-out
base hit by Hughes. Junior lefty Josh Koons
(1-1), finishing up for sophomore starter Jeff
Austin, suffered the loss for Stanford.
"I think in some ways we played a little bet
ter" Sunday than Saturday, Marquess said.
"The difference was Sunday we just couldn't
get a big hit and they did."
In another nail-biter, yesterday's big hit
came from Muth in the bottom of the eighth
inning.
In game three, with one out and a runner
on first, Kilburg hit a typical infield double
play ball. Kilburg hustled down the line and
avoided being doubled up, keeping the inning
alive. Muth followed with the biggest hit of
his Cardinal career, blasting a bomb over the
400-foot marker on the right-center field
fence.
"The inning stayed alive because of Joe's
hustle," Muth said. "We were hitting balls real

well that weren't falling, and it was good that
we came through when it mattered."
Muth's home run oil Mike McDonald (0-1)
was one of the Cardinal's 11 hits. The offense
also produced five doubles throughout the
game, including Quaccia's two-out, three-run
double in the first inning.
Sophomore starting pitcher Chad
Hutchinson got off to a rocky start, allowing
three runs on two homer c in the first inning.
He settled down and allowed only one more
earned run through the sixth inning. After
pitching just two days before, Cogan (2-1)
replaced Hutchinson in the sixth inning and
pitched three flawless innings, earning the
win.
"It is my job to pitch back-to-back games,"
Cogan said. "I like it that way."
"Our relief did really well this weekend,
and Cogan did a great job," Marquess said.
"Our starters did not pitch as well as they are
capable of; they need to do better."
The Card will take on the UC-Davis Aggies
today at 2 p.m. in Davis. The Aggies are a
perennial Divison II powerhouse.
"It is important for us," Schaeffer said.
"We are playing well and hope to get another
win."
The probable starter for Stanford is either
sophomore Brent Hoard (1-1) or junior Adam
Harris (0-0). Stanford leads the series with
Davis 20-3.

Sam Mankiewicz — Daily
Senior left fielder Chris Clark swings at the ball in Saturday's 9-8 win against the Broncos.
Clark scored the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Warning: Anyone with a heart condition is
strongly advised against boarding this roller
coaster.
This warning should have been given to the
players, coaches and fans alike who witnessed
this nail-biting baseball series. The Cardinal
and the Santa Clara Broncos fought to the last
out in all three games this weekend, making
for a phenomenal series.
The fourth-ranked Stanford team won the
series, improving to 9-4, while the Broncos fell
to 3-5.
On Saturday it was senior left fielder Chris
Clark's heroic home run with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth inning that broke a tie to
give Stanford a 9-8 victory over the Broncos at
Sunken Diamond.
On Sunday the Broncos' Todd Hughes pro
duced the game-winning pinch-hit in his first
career at bat, giving Santa Clara a 6-5 win in
the bottom of the 10th inning at Buck Shaw
Stadium.
And, in the third game of the series yester
day, freshman right fielder Edmund Muth
drilled a two-run homer in the bottom of the
eighth inning that broke a 6-6 tie,earning the
Card a come-from-behind 8-6 victory in its
next-to-last at bat.
"These are real good games," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We came back
very well, and that was a good sign."
After the first two Stanford batters in the
ninth were retired in game one, the stage was
set for Clark. With two outs and a full count,
Clark drilled his third home run of the season
to left-center field, giving Stanford the
thrilling victory.
"Chris has produced for us," Marquess said
on KZSU. "He has been a key player for us."
Game one was not quite the pitcher's duel
that was anticipated, as it included six lead
changes, six doubles and four home runs.
Sophomore closer Tony Cogan (1-1) picked up
the win after finishing for junior starter Kyle
Peterson while Vince Boyanich (0-1) was sad
dled with the loss. After his spectacular 17-
strikeout performance the weekend before
against Fresno State, Peterson struck out
eight Broncos but allowed four doubles and
one home run.
The Cardinal offense scored four runs in a
big fourth inning. Junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer led off with a line-drive single and was fol
lowed by senior first baseman Luke Quaccia's
first home run of the season. Clark then beat
out an infield single and was advanced by
junior Jay Pecci's single. Junior Joe Kliburg's
single loaded the bases, and Clark scored on a
wild pitch. With two outs, Muth laid down and
beat out a perfect bunt, scoring Pecci from
third.
Sunday's heroic come-from-behind victory
belonged to Santa Clara. In game two, the
Card got out to an early 3-0 lead in the first
inning. Kilburg led off the game with a stand
up double, and Muth followed with a walk.
Freshman designated hitter John Gall bunted
and reached on a Bronco error, loading the
bases. Kilburg scored on a single by SchaefTer,
and Muth scored on a wild pitch by Bronco

starter Mike Crudale. Gall was driven in on a
sacrifice fly by Quaccia.
Sophomore Jody Gerut added a home run
and Gall had two doubles, but the Stanford
offense wasn't able to capitalize as it left 11
runners on base.
Santa Clara tied the game with three runs
in the second, and the teams exchanged runs
until the game was sent into extra innings
with the score tied 5-5.
The Card was held scoreless in the top of
the 10th, but the Broncos scored on a two-out
base hit by Hughes. Junior lefty Josh Koons
(1-1), finishing up for sophomore starter Jeff
Austin, suffered the loss for Stanford.
"I think in some ways we played a little bet
ter" Sunday than Saturday, Marquess said.
"The difference was Sunday we just couldn't
get a big hit and they did."
In another nail-biter, yesterday's big hit
came from Muth in the bottom of the eighth
inning.
In game three, with one out and a runner
on first, Kilburg hit a typical infield double
play ball. Kilburg hustled down the line and
avoided being doubled up, keeping the inning
alive. Muth followed with the biggest hit of
his Cardinal career, blasting a bomb over the
400-foot marker on the right-center field
fence.
"The inning stayed alive because of Joe's
hustle," Muth said. "We were hitting balls real

well that weren't falling, and it was good that
we came through when it mattered."
Muth's home run oil Mike McDonald (0-1)
was one of the Cardinal's 11 hits. The offense
also produced five doubles throughout the
game, including Quaccia's two-out, three-run
double in the first inning.
Sophomore starting pitcher Chad
Hutchinson got off to a rocky start, allowing
three runs on two homer c in the first inning.
He settled down and allowed only one more
earned run through the sixth inning. After
pitching just two days before, Cogan (2-1)
replaced Hutchinson in the sixth inning and
pitched three flawless innings, earning the
win.
"It is my job to pitch back-to-back games,"
Cogan said. "I like it that way."
"Our relief did really well this weekend,
and Cogan did a great job," Marquess said.
"Our starters did not pitch as well as they are
capable of; they need to do better."
The Card will take on the UC-Davis Aggies
today at 2 p.m. in Davis. The Aggies are a
perennial Divison II powerhouse.
"It is important for us," Schaeffer said.
"We are playing well and hope to get another
win."
The probable starter for Stanford is either
sophomore Brent Hoard (1-1) or junior Adam
Harris (0-0). Stanford leads the series with
Davis 20-3.
