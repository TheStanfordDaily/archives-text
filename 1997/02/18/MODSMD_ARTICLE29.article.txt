# Women's gymnastics dominates the Bears
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The women's gymnastics
team returned home with a big
victory over California on Fri
day, taking individual titles on
two events and defeating the
Bears on all four.
The Card took the team title
with a total of 194.15, the high
est score set by a visiting team
on the Bears turf this season.
Cal finished 1.3 points behind
with 192.85.
In the all-around category,
freshman Larissa Fontaine and
co-captains Amy Murakami and
Keri Monahan, placed first, sec
ond and third respectively.
"Even individually, as well as
a team, we dominated the meet,"
Fontaine said. "We competed
with a lot of confidence and
showed our routines as best as
we could." Fontaine, who had
been kept from competing on the
floor for the past three meets
due to an injured ankle, now
counts two all-around titles.
This all-out win is especially
sweet for the Stanford squad,
which last year experienced a
loss to the Bears in a dual meet
after four members of the Card
fell off the beam. This year's
squad was more than ready to
face the Bears' challenge.

"It's not good to go into a
meet focusing on beating the
other team, but it felt really good
to beat Cal," Monahan said.
Murakami said that although
the all-around triumphs of the
three Stanford gymnasts are
nice, it was the Cardinal squad's
overall performance that was
truly satisfying.
On the difficult beam, Mona
han and Fontaine's score of 9.85
together with Murakami's 9.825
performance boosted the Card to
a total of 48.975 points — the
highest mark Stanford has
received on the apparatus in two
years.
The beam event established
the Stanford team as both physi
cally talented and mentally capa
ble as the gymnasts executed
strong and consistent routines
in front of the hundreds of roar
ing Bears' fans led by its march
ing band, complete with drums,
trumpets and horns.
"I was really happy with the
way we remained pulled together
despite starting off I the beaml
with a fall," Murakami said.
Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick,
who displayed a strong 9.725
performance on the beam, said
the beam routine is "90 percent
mental," and Murakami con
curred.
"Everyone looked really confi
dent on the beam," Murakami

said. "We wanted to beat them;
even more, we didn't want to
beat ourselves."
The roaring Cal crowd was
not the only distraction the Card
had to ignore.
Throughout the night, gym
nasts were forced to stay in high
spirits although the low scores
did not reflect their high-level
routines.
Bears coach Meredith King
said the judging process was
"just too ridiculous."
"The scoring sucked," King
said. "After we screamed at (the
judges], it got a little better, but
I'm not happy about it at all."
The Card, a team ranked sec
ond in the nation on the vault
apparatus, was forced to accept a
total score of 48.075 on the
vault, more than a full point
lower than what it has consis
tently received all season.
The judges "were being mean,
especially on the vault,"
Murakami said. She added that
performances which would gen
erally have received 9.9s were
receiving marks as low as 9.4.
Murakami stuck both of her
landings on her vault yet tallied
only a pedestrian 9.525 for the
event.
Stanford coach Lisa Izzi said
she was "really disappointed in
the judging but was pleased with
the Card's vaulting, which was

just as good" as it has been in the
previous meets.
Izzi added that what was
important was how the Cardinal
gymnasts remained in control
under the circumstances.
"We didn't let it affect us,"
Izzi said.
Monahan also added she was
happy with the way the team
members focused on its perfor
mance and did not let the judg
ing get to them.
"The scoring is pretty much
out of our hands," Monahan
said. "But it can't take away
from our performance and from
what we were trying to do."
Despite the questionable
judging, gymnasts on both teams
agree that the meet was a suc
cess.
"I had a great time," Cal
freshman Jenny Kang said.
"Stanford was a good, solid
team."
King said the Bears suffered
three major injuries recently and
have been forced to compete
with inexperienced members of
the squad in the past few meets.
King also said that she was
pleased with her team's overall
performance, despite the unfor
tunate scoring.
"Stanford looked great," King
said. "I thought they were
underscored on the vault, but
they are a good team."
