Amid smiles and inflated con
doms, members of Volunteers for
Increasing the Visibility of AIDS cel
ebrated National Condom Day on
Friday by handing out the contra
ceptives to passers-by in White
Plaza.
This was the first major event
put on by the group, a new
AIDS / HIV awareness organiza
tion created last quarter. On Friday,
members werejoined by representa
tives from the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center advocating the slo
gan, "If you can't cover your rocket,
keep it in your pocket."

The organization hopes to be the
main resource and focal point for
AIDS-related issues on campus.
"The group was started because
there hasn't been an AIDS aware
ness group which was not connected
to a class," said Benjamin Morgan, a
member of the new group and a co
ordinator of student projects for
Cowell Student Health Center.
Members of Project Save, a simi
lar organization run as part of a psy
chology class last year, discontinued
the program after the class ended,
Morgan said.
A joint effort of Cowell and the
Haas Center for Public Service, the
new group is still trying to formalize
its constitution with the Office of

Student Activities, but it has many
plans for the future.
It wants to organize training
with AIDS Resources Information
Services for members to run dorm
outreach programs. In addition, the
group has a Writing and Critical
Thinking community service class
working on an AIDS / HIV resource
guide and a Worl Wide Web page.
"We were really excited because
there was such a huge student in
terest in the group," said member
Karen Wang, who also serves as a
Haas Center HIV / AIDS coordina
tor.

major events until Friday.
"One of our goals [with the Na
tional Condom Day project] was to
try and get things started and orga
nized," said Wang.
In addition to an AIDS Aware
ness Week campaign, the group
plans to lobby state officials in

Sacramento for further AIDS re
search funding on June 2, AIDS
Lobby Day.
The group is also planning a
"friend-raiser" in conjunction with
the National AIDS Memorial
Grove, which is dedicated to victims
of AIDS. The fund-raiser would in
clude performances by several a
capella groups on campus.
The next event for the group will
be its second AIDS / HIV round
table dinner discussion on Feb. 27
at the Haas Center.
