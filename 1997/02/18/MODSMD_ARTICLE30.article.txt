# Synchronized swimming defeats Cal in only home meet
## No. 2 women try new tricks in 108-41.5 victory 
### Scott Judd 
Even if synchronized swimming
weren't such an elegant sport,
watching Stanford trounce Cali
fornia in Saturday's dual meet
would have still been a beautiful
sight.
In its only home meet of the
year, the No. 2 women's synchro
nized swimming team demonstrat
ed why the Cardinal is a strong
contender for this year's NCAA
Championship. It seemed as if
Stanford was giving swimming
lessons to its across-the-Bay rivals,
dominating Cal in a crushing 108-
41.5 victory. The polished Cardinal
squad swept all events, including
the top eight spots in figures com
petition.
"Swimming at home was defi
nitely a big motivation," said assis
tant coach Andy Maisel. "We've
got a really strong team, and this
gave us a chance to compete in
front of roommates, dormmates,
professors and friends."
The victory was particularly
sweet for junior transfer Heather
Pease, who captured the figures,
solo, duet and trio competitions in
her first home meet for Stanford.
Pease, a gold medalist at last year's
Olympics, paired with senior Brid

get Finn to score a dominating
94.133 in the duet competition.
The two were joined by sophomore
Vanessa Shaw in conquering the
trio event, as the triad's energetic
routine swam away with a 91.400
tally.
"It was really nice to have
friends out there cheering for us,"
Pease said. "Everyone on the team
has been working really hard on
improving their routines, and
we're really pleased with the way
we swam."

'They lived on the
edge and went for
the more challenging
routine. It was fun for
the audience, and it
was fun for all of us'
— Andy Maisel

While Pease racked up the most
impressive individual statistics,
the meet's highlight came during
Stanford's team competition.
Instead of opting for a safe open

ing, the eight-member squad
began its daring routine by emerg
ing from the water and throwing
Finn high into the air for a spec
tacular dive that awed the home
crowd. It was the meet's defining
moment, a bold move that the
swimmers executed with flair and
precision.
"The team decided to add the
throw in just this week," Maisel
said. "They lived on the edge and
went for the more challenging rou
tine. It was fun for the audience,
and it was fun for all of us."
With this dominant victory, the
Cardinal continues to build
momentum toward a rematch with
archrival Ohio State at the NCAA
Championships next month. The
next step in Stanford's quest for a
national title will be at the NCAA
Regionals in Seattle on March 1.
Head coach Vickey Weir, who has
coached Stanford's team for the
last 18 years, stressed the need for
discipline and team unity if they
are to topple Ohio State.
"Every meet provides just that
much more competitive experience
for the swimmers," Weir said. "If
they continue to meld together
into a team in spirit, as well as in
the water, they stand a great
chance of achieving their goals."
