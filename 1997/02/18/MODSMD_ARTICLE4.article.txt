# Bird's eye view
## 
### Jeanette Perez 
In third grade, while most kids were playing
Nintendo games, John Weller was snapping a pho
tograph of a blackbird that appeared in Colorado
Outdoors magazine.
Weller, a senior, has been taking nature pho
tographs since the age of 9. His works have been
showcased in many different magazines, calendars
and ten different galleries.
His lens is most often focused on birds. "Birds
are what I am most fond of photographing. I like
the idea of flying," Weller said.
After earning his pilot's license last year, Weller
has been able to get a bird's eye view of his sub
jects.
Weller's search for birds of a different feather
have taken him around the country. "My car has
been in 46 out of 50 states," he said.
Before Weller transferred to Stanford last year,
he took a year off and traveled everywhere in the

country that his camera would take him.
Weller spent a month in the woods of Haines,
Alaska, during the winter. There, he pho
tographed eagles in the day and the northern
lights during the 16-hour or 17-hour nights.
However, Weller doesn't just find a pretty site
and press a button.
"A lot of photography is research," Weller said.
"Every trip I take I'll read 10 to 15 sources on the
species I'm going to photograph to learn how the
animal reacts to different situations."
Despite his planning, sometimes the animals
come to him. Once while taking pictures along a
river in Alaska, he was followed by a grizzly bear
that left 16-inch footprints. Another time in the
Florida Everglades, he suddenly saw an alligator
the length of his canoe.
"It was a little scary, but once I was able to slow
ly back far enough away from the gator, I got some

Weller had published. He was 9 years old at the time.
really good pictures," Weller
said."
Even in times of danger, his
first thoughts are always to get
the photo.
Because each region brings a
new surprise, Weller cannot pick
a favorite part or place.
"I realized that every place was
beautiful and had its own things
to share," Weller said. "I couldn't
find a favorite because I had good
experiences throughout the trip."
Weller attributes his love of
beauty and photography to his
parents. As a child he went on
many trips throughout the world
with his parents.
"My parents are the ones who
started me into photography and
seeing beauty. They are very
aware of their surroundings and
realize how great it is to be alive,"
Weller said. "We are always find
ing beauty in situations and
places you wouldn't think it
would be."
Weller said he also received in
spiration for his cross-country
trip from "Travels with Charley,"
by John Steinbeck. The autobiog
raphy details Steinbeck's trip
around the country with his dog,

Charley.
Like Steinbeck, Weller wants
to experience America and its
beauty. Instead of taking his dog,
Weller took his camera.
"The reason I take pictures is
to show people my experience. It's
my way of writing and expressing
what I see," Weller said.
Currently, Weller, an econom
ics major, takes pictures on the
side to fund his education and his
hobby of flying.
Weller sells most of his prints
in galleries in Colorado, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota. More than
250 copies of his print featuring a
loon have been sold, he said.
Weller is in the process of de
ciding where hp wants to go with
his talent.
He joked, "I can either do what
my heart says and become a starv
ing artist now, or do what my ad
visor says and become an econo
mist now and become a well-en
dowed artist later.
"Photography is what I love to
do, so I don't know if I want to
make it what I have to do," Weller
said.
For now, Weller is going to con
tinue with his love and see what
travels lie ahead.
"I think oflifeasatrip," Weller
said. "Every place has something
to offer, it's just up to the traveler
to find it."
