# Bird's eye view

In third grade, while most kids were playing
Nintendo games, John Weller was snapping a pho
tograph of a blackbird that appeared in Colorado
Outdoors magazine.
Weller, a senior, has been taking nature pho
tographs since the age of 9. His works have been
showcased in many different magazines, calendars
and ten different galleries.
His lens is most often focused on birds. "Birds
are what I am most fond of photographing. I like
the idea of flying," Weller said.
After earning his pilot's license last year, Weller
has been able to get a bird's eye view of his sub
jects.
Weller's search for birds of a different feather
have taken him around the country. "My car has
been in 46 out of 50 states," he said.
Before Weller transferred to Stanford last year,
he took a year off and traveled everywhere in the

country that his camera would take him.
Weller spent a month in the woods of Haines,
Alaska, during the winter. There, he pho
tographed eagles in the day and the northern
lights during the 16-hour or 17-hour nights.
However, Weller doesn't just find a pretty site
and press a button.
"A lot of photography is research," Weller said.
"Every trip I take I'll read 10 to 15 sources on the
species I'm going to photograph to learn how the
animal reacts to different situations."
Despite his planning, sometimes the animals
come to him. Once while taking pictures along a
river in Alaska, he was followed by a grizzly bear
that left 16-inch footprints. Another time in the
Florida Everglades, he suddenly saw an alligator
the length of his canoe.
"It was a little scary, but once I was able to slow
ly back far enough away from the gator, I got some

Weller had published. He was 9 years old at the time.
