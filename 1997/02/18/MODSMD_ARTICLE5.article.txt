# Casa Burciaga?
## Zapata residents may choose to rename dorm after former RFs 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Members of the Stanford com
munity will vote tonight on a move
to rename Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano / Latino theme dorm, in
honor of two beloved former resi
dent fellows.
The dorm would be renamed
Casa Burciaga in honor of Cecilia
and Tony Burciaga, who were res
ident fellows for nine years until
1994. Tony Burciaga died of can
cer in October.
Tonight's meeting will be open
to all community members: After
discussion, current residents and
community members will vote on
the motion. The meeting will be
held at 8 p.m. in the Zapata
lounge, already called the Burcia
ga Lounge
The dorm's staff will hold a
vote among current Zapata resi
dents later this week.
The vote will be structured in
such a way that the collective vote
of the current residents of Zapata
will have twice as much weight as
the collective vote of the rest of the
community.
Freshman Adriana Ibarra, one
of Zapata's dorm presidents, said

they consider "whoever feels they
would be affected" to be eligible to
vote.
The idea of honoring the Burci
agas in this fashion first came up
in meetings of the dorm staff earli
er this year, according to senior
Linda Prieto, a resident assistant
in Zapata.
According to Asst. English
Prof. Lora Romero, Zapata's cur
rent RF, the dorm staff will con
sult Zapata's alumni in the event
of a 'yes' vote. If the alumni are re
ceptive, she added, then the next
step will be to approach the ad
ministration.
"1 am honored, humbled and
surprised " by the idea of renaming
the house, Cecilia Burciaga said.
She said she is very touched by the
continuing support from former
Zapata residents since her hus
band's death.
In addition to being resident
fellows, Cecilia was am assistant
dean of students until her position
waseliminated in 1994. Tony Bur
ciaga is remembered as the
painter of several murals that still
decorate Zapata and its dining
area.
Students from that period
fondly remember the sense of fam
ily the Burciagas created in Zapata
and in the greater Chicano / Lati
no community.
Burciaga said she received
more than 400 letters of condo
lence and support from former
rociriPTif c
"The fact that [Tony] is re
membered in this way is wonder
ful for me," Burciaga added.
She suggested, however, that
the move might displease some ad
ministrators, given the circum
stances under which the Burcia

gas left Stanford.
The University maintains Ce
cilia Burciaga's layoff was due to
budget cuts. At the time she was
the University's highest-ranking
Chicana administrator.
The layoff was one of the issues
that precipitated a three-day
hunger strike that year, when four
students fasted and demanded in
part that Cecilia Burciaga be rein
stated to some high-level adminis
trative post.
Burciaga said she remembered
her layoff as a "very bitter and
very cruel" incident. She also said
she suspected Provost Condoleez
za Rice and Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds, the two officials most di
rectly responsible for her layoff,

would not wish to revive memories
of that period.
Edmonds declined to comment
on the matter but did say that she
is not sure her office will have any
say in the decision and suggested
that the Office of Residential Edu
cation was more likely to be close
ly involved.
According to a University
memo on naming policies and pro
cedures, a renaming such as this
will have to obtain the sponsor
ship of the provost and the ap
proval of the University Cabinet.
The memo also says that build
ings should be named after faculty
or staff members only if they have
been retired for more than ten
years.
Burciaga said that to her, the

process of having the name
changed might end up being more
important than the result "if it be
comes a tangible thing for stu
dents to reach for."
Romero said that beyond ob
taining guidelines from Residen
tial Education, Zapata residents
were waiting for the vote and the
opinion of the alumni before mov
ing on to sounding out the admin
istration.
"At the moment," Romero said,
"we want to make sure this is
something that has the will of all
[the people involved] behind it."
This year will mark the 25th an
niversary of Casa Zapata, which is
named after Emiliano Zapata, a
Mexican revolutionary who fought
a guerrilla war in the 1910s.
