# Casa Burciaga?
## Zapata residents may choose to rename dorm after former RFs 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Members of the Stanford com
munity will vote tonight on a move
to rename Casa Zapata, the Chi
cano / Latino theme dorm, in
honor of two beloved former resi
dent fellows.
The dorm would be renamed
Casa Burciaga in honor of Cecilia
and Tony Burciaga, who were res
ident fellows for nine years until
1994. Tony Burciaga died of can
cer in October.
Tonight's meeting will be open
to all community members: After
discussion, current residents and
community members will vote on
the motion. The meeting will be
held at 8 p.m. in the Zapata
lounge, already called the Burcia
ga Lounge
The dorm's staff will hold a
vote among current Zapata resi
dents later this week.
The vote will be structured in
such a way that the collective vote
of the current residents of Zapata
will have twice as much weight as
the collective vote of the rest of the
community.
Freshman Adriana Ibarra, one
of Zapata's dorm presidents, said

they consider "whoever feels they
would be affected" to be eligible to
vote.
The idea of honoring the Burci
agas in this fashion first came up
in meetings of the dorm staff earli
er this year, according to senior
Linda Prieto, a resident assistant
in Zapata.
According to Asst. English
Prof. Lora Romero, Zapata's cur
rent RF, the dorm staff will con
sult Zapata's alumni in the event
of a 'yes' vote. If the alumni are re
ceptive, she added, then the next
step will be to approach the ad
ministration.
"1 am honored, humbled and
surprised " by the idea of renaming
the house, Cecilia Burciaga said.
She said she is very touched by the
continuing support from former
Zapata residents since her hus
band's death.
In addition to being resident
fellows, Cecilia was am assistant
dean of students until her position
waseliminated in 1994. Tony Bur
ciaga is remembered as the
painter of several murals that still
decorate Zapata and its dining
area.
