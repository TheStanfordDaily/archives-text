# Nakatani discusses three sons' deaths
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
In a moving presentation, A 1
and Jane Nakatani recounted the
lessons they learned after the
deaths of their children for Kim
ball residents last night.
"We have lost our three sons,"
A 1 Nakatani said. "Two to AIDS
and one to violence."
Their second oldest son was
killed during an argument follow
ing an incidental traffic accident.
Two Chicano men opened a car
door into the side Greg Nakatani's
pickup truck. When Nakatani
used a racial slur during the ensu
ing verbal altercation, a gun was
drawn and fired six times — one
round hit Greg in the heart.
Glenn and Guy, the couple's el
dest and youngest sons, both gay,
died of AIDS related complica
tions.
Guy Nakatani had lived a very
public life after being diagnosed. A
frequent speaker at San Jose-area
high schools, he was graphically
up-front about the physical hard
ships surrounding his illness —
diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, weekly
retinal injections to preserve his
sight and the plastic tube in his
chest allowing him to take medica

tion directly into his coronary
artery.
Guy's parents, however, while
not shying away from the details
of their sons' illness, sought to
draw attention to the emotional
issues that make it difficult for
young people to face hardship and
avoid at-risk situations.
"We are killing our young peo
ple," A 1 Nakatani said.
Children are confronted with a


Al Nakatani
"cloud of denigration" from the
earliest age, he said. A blanket of in
tolerance plagues the development
of young people, reinforced by the
taunts of their peers and parents.
"My sons died spiritually long
before they became infected," he
said.
Community, society, even par

ents, according to A 1 Nakatani, are
guilty of "demeaning, devaluing
and dismissing individuals based
upon who or what they are."
When asked how they handled
their son's coming out, the
Nakatanis admitted they "did not
handle it as well as we should or
could have."
"I was a hysterical, homopho
bic mom and just about ran him
out of the house," Jane Nakatani
said.
But, rtl Nakatani said, that

event helped him come to terms
with his fear and dislike of gays.
"Until you go through the
process of [facing your own ha
tred], you are not going to be able
to make significant changes," he
said.
Beyond delivering their warn
ing to future parents and future
grandparents, the couple said they
hoped that they could encourage
Asian Americans to be more open
with each other and with their
communities.

"What we are doing is totally
alien to our culture," A 1 Nakatani
said. "To publicly discuss shame,
embarrassment and dishonor is
not how Asian Americans are
taught to behave."
"I am here, however, to dispel
the myth surrounding Asian
Americans — to lift the cloak of
shame."
The Nakatani family's story
was published earlier this year by
Conari Press in "Honor Thy Chil
dren" by Molly Fumia.
