# Nakatani discusses three sons' deaths

### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
In a moving presentation, A 1
and Jane Nakatani recounted the
lessons they learned after the
deaths of their children for Kim
ball residents last night.
"We have lost our three sons,"
A 1 Nakatani said. "Two to AIDS
and one to violence."
Their second oldest son was
killed during an argument follow
ing an incidental traffic accident.
Two Chicano men opened a car
door into the side Greg Nakatani's
pickup truck. When Nakatani
used a racial slur during the ensu
ing verbal altercation, a gun was
drawn and fired six times — one
round hit Greg in the heart.
Glenn and Guy, the couple's el
dest and youngest sons, both gay,
died of AIDS related complica
tions.
Guy Nakatani had lived a very
public life after being diagnosed. A
frequent speaker at San Jose-area
high schools, he was graphically
up-front about the physical hard
ships surrounding his illness —
diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, weekly
retinal injections to preserve his
sight and the plastic tube in his
chest allowing him to take medica

tion directly into his coronary
artery.
Guy's parents, however, while
not shying away from the details
of their sons' illness, sought to
draw attention to the emotional
issues that make it difficult for
young people to face hardship and
avoid at-risk situations.
"We are killing our young peo
ple," A 1 Nakatani said.
