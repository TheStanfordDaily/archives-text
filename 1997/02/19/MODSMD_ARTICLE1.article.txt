# USHC appoints Van Etten CEO

### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Peter Van Etten, chief executive
officer of Stanford Health Services,
has been appointed to the same posi
tion in UCSF / Stanford Health
Care, the corporation resulting from
the merger of SHS and the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center.
Last Thursday, USHC's board
announced that William Kerr, direc
tor of UCSF Medical Center, would
become CEO. Kerr, however, decid
ed on Friday to reverse his accep
tance and instead become chief oper
ating officer, leaving the higher posi
tion to Van Etten.
According to a USHC statement,
Kerr changed his mind because he
felt himself most suited to the day
to-day operational work of a chief op
erating officer.
Kerr and Van Etten were both
previously under consideration for
the post, said Isaac Stein, chair of the
USHC board.
"When we went through the
analysis," Stein explained, "we real
ized that we had two world-class can
didates."
He added that he is extremely
pleased to have kept both Van Etten
and Kerr as officers of USHC. Kerr's
change of heart, he said, came as a
surprise but not a disappointment.
"It would obviously have been
simpler for everyone if 1 Kerr's deci

sion] had happened before the an
nouncement, but it still produced a
great result," Stein said.
Van Etten said he was looking
forward to teaming up with Kerr.
"We have worked very closely
during the last year-and-a-half," he
said. "I think we complement each
other."
Van Etten said that before hear
ing about Kerr's change of mind, he
had not decided whether to remain
with USHC in another capacity.
He went on to say that his new job
at USHC would differ substantially
from his current position. His pri
mary goals will be to create "a new
role in the marketplace for academic
medicine" and "an organization that
can more effectively make a case to
the public as to why we are unique."
Those concerns, Van Etten said,
have been part of his job at SHS, but
he added that as separate institu
tions, UCSF and SHS had to concen
trate on differentiating themselves
from each other.
As a combination, he added, they
will be more able to gain market
share by distinguishing the kind of
complex care available at an academ
ic hospital from that which is avail
able at a community hospital.
Both appointments will become
effective on March 1. Van Etten said
he will step down as head of SHS at
that point. He added that he hopes
USHC will be fully operational this
July, as originally planned.
An interim SHS head had not yet
been chosen.
Van Etten became the head of
SHS when it was first formed in
1995. Kerr, who was not available
for comment, has been director of
UCSF Medical Center for the past
19 years.
