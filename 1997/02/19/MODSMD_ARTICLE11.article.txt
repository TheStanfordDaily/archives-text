## Successful defection? N. Korea may let official leave 
### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” A rare pub
lic comment by North Korea's
leader, who declared yesterday
that his country has no need for
cowards, became the strongest
signal yet that a high-ranking
official may be allowed to defect
to South Korea.
China, meanwhile, said it
wants a quick resolution to the
crisis that started when Hwang
Jang Yop walked into the South
Korean consulate in Beijing to
become the highest-ranking
official to defect from the
North.
Hwang's defection has height
ened tension on the Korean
Peninsula and clouded Western
efforts to nudge open North
Korea's tightly closed society.
Hwang is a former tutor of
North Korean leader Kim Jong
11, who issued a statement yester
day that was read on North Kore
an radio: "As the revolutionary
song says, 'Cowards, if you want
to go, then go away. We will
defend the red flag of revolution
to the end.' "
The broadcast, monitored in
Tokyo, made no mention of
Hwang but came just one day
after North Korea indicated it
might accept Hwang's defection.
Kim, who turned 55 on Sun
day, rarely comments on current
events, aside from addresses to
the North Korean military.
North Korea said Monday that
if Hwang "sought asylum, it
means that he is a renegade, and
he is dismissed." It said it has
asked China to investigate

Hwang's "disappearance."
South Korea took the com
ments to mean that the North
might assent to Hwang's defec
tion if convinced that he fled will
ingly. The North previously had
claimed Hwang, 73, had been kid
napped.
South Korean Foreign Minis
ter Yoo Chong-na said his gov
ernment would investigate the
apparent "big change in North
Korea's position."
He added: "If it wants, North
Korea can participate in a process
to confirm his intention to
defect."
Hwang was a member of the
North's major decision-making
body, the Central Committee,
and the South could learn much
from his familiarity with the
secretive workings of the North's
government.
China is caught in an uncom
fortable position, between its
longtime communist ally, North
Korea, and an important trading
partner, South Korea.
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang told reporters
yesterday that China hoped the
crisis would be resolved "as soon
as possible."
Tang did not say how talks on
Hwang's case were progressing.
A South Korean Embassy
spokesman, Chang Moon Ik, said
negotiations had made progress
but declined to say when a solu
tion might be reached.
"China is consulting with our
side and I believe with North
Korea," he said.
