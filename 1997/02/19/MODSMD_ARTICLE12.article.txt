ACLU to 'out' lawmakers
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Outraging
members of the state Legislature, the
head of the American Civil Liberties
Union in the Dakotas is threatening to
expose gay lawmakers who vote to ban
homosexual marriages.
"If they're going to be hypocritical,
then they need to have that hypocrisy
exposed," Keith Elston, who is himself
gay, said yesterday.
He made the threat to "out" lawmak
ers he believes are gay in a column last
week in a weekly arts and entertainment
guide published in Grand Forks.
The legislation at issue would deny
recognition of same-sex marriages per
formed in other states and explicitly
define a marriage as a union between a
man and a woman.
"He is absolutely off the wall," said
Senate Majority Leader Gary Nelson, a
Republican. "I'm going to support my
people when they start suing him, if he's
idiotic enough to do anything about it."
Republican Sen. Wayne Stenehjem said
it was "repulsive" for the ACLU, which
emphasizes privacy rights, to threaten to
expose homosexual lawmakers.
The national ACLU is "behind me 100
percent," Elston said. Calls to the organi
zation's New York headquarters were
not immediately returned.
Fewer doctors to be trained
NEW YORK (AP) — In the medical
world equivalent of agricultural subsi
dies that pay farmers to hold down pro
duction, the federal government is giving
$400 million to 41 New York hospitals to
train fewer doctors.
The Health Care Financing Adminis
tration, part of the Department of Health
and Human Services, will pay the money
over the next six years. During that period,

the hospitals will train 2,000 fewer medical
residents, a decrease of about 20 percent.
"Until now Medicare has been giving
hospitals an incentive to hire more resi
dents," Bruce Vladeck, administrator of
the Health Care Financing Administra
tion, said in a statement Monday. "We
need to change that."
"There's a feeling in the country that
more physicians are being produced than
are needed, looking at long-term projec
tions," said Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of
Columbia University's School of Public
Health.
The Medicare system pays teaching
hospitals an average of $87,000 for every
resident they train. Under the new sys
tem, participating hospitals will get some
of that money for every residency slot
they leave vacant, but the amount will
decrease each year for six years. By the
seventh year, the subsidy will be gone.
Many of the medical students shut out
from residencies will be from abroad,
Rosenfield predicted.
Jury to decide duPont case
MEDIA, Pa. (AP) — A defense attor
ney urged jurors yesterday to find multi
millionaire John E. du Pont innocent by
reason of insanity of murdering an
Olympic wrestler, saying they have an
obligation to help him get better.
"You have been an eyewitness to
insanity," Thomas Bergstrom said dur
ing his closing argument.
The prosecution contends du Pont
was not insane but was in a jealous rage
when he killed David Schultz, and should
be convicted of murder and jailed for life.
After prosecutors' closing arguments,
the case was expected to go to the jury
sometime during the afternoon.
Du Pont, 58, is charged killing
Schultz, 36, a gold medalist at the 1984
Olympics.
