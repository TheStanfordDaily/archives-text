# NATO deal with Russia proposed
## Secretary of state will discuss plan with Yeltsin today in Moscow 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
Trying to ease concerns in
Moscow, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright proposed
yesterday that NATO form a
joint military brigade with Rus
sia for peacekeeping operations
in Europe.
Based on successful coopera
tion in implementing the Dayton
peace accords in Bosnia,
Albright said Russian and
NATO troops could also train
together under the concept she
presented to allied foreign min
isters in Brussels.
She will take the idea to
Moscow tomorrow for meetings
with President Boris Yeltsin,
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Pri
makov and other Kremlin offi
cials who take a skeptical and
also anxious view of NATO's
planned expansion to Russia's
western border by 1999.
Albright, who is also working
with the allies on a charter link
ing Russia to NATO, said in a
speech, "We will be steadfast in
offering Russia our respect, our
friendship and an appropriate
partnership."
"We cannot realize our
shared vision of a united, secure
and democratic Europe without
Russia," she said.
With the 16-nation NATO
primed to offer membership at a
summit in July to former Soviet
allies — most likely Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary —

the United States, France and
other allies are searching for
ways to allay Russia's anxieties.
As a result, NATO is increas
ingly finding ways to link Russia
more tightly to the Western
alliance, while denying it mem
bership. Albright explained that
"we are trying to include Russia
as much as possible," but the
allies also want to avoid giving
Moscow a veto over military
actions that membership would
provide.
In such instances, she said,
"we will act as the alliance" —
without Russia's approval.
Albright also called for a
meeting in the spring with
prospective new NATO mem
bers "to give every ally a chance
for direct discussion" before the
July summit in Madrid, Spain.
Former Russia Foreign Min
ister Andrei Kozyrev, among
others, opposes NATO's spread
eastward, warning it could
humiliate Russia and strength
en the hand of neo-fascists
already in conflict with reform
ers in Moscow.
A growing number of former
American diplomats and private
analysts have questioned the
wisdom of the expansion.
And in Congress, there are
questions about the cost of
expansion.
Albright said the administra
tion will provide a report. She
declined to estimate the cost.
