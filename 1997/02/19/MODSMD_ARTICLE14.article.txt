# End not near for Whitewater probe
## Prosecutor says investigation will continue despite his departure 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr said yesterday
the criminal investigation of President
and Mrs. Clinton "is going to go on for
some time." The 3-year probe will likely
proceed under yet another independent
counsel.
Starr said any perception that the
investigation will end soon is flawed.
"I think that is a wrong, it is erroneous
and it is a very dangerous thought," Starr
said outside his office in Little Rock, Ark.

"We are very far along in this investi
gation, and it would be very wrong, very
wrong, very misguided, for anyone to
make any judgment with respect to the
future of this investigation," he said.
He said the probe "is going to go on for
some time" and that a three-member
panel of federal appeals court judges
would name his replacement. He said he
would recommend someone if asked by
the court.
"We've made very substantial

progress, and we re very much in the
investigative and evaluative stage,"
Starr said, seeking to dampen specula
tion that his impending departure ruled
out the possibility of action against the
Clintons.
Earlier, in an interview the day after
the surprise announcement of his depar
ture, Starr noted that some potential wit
nesses have not yet come forward.
"The sooner we get the truth, 1 think
the better for evervone," he said.
