Alumni giving provides
essential support for the
University's mission

The importance of alumni
donations to the University
is obvious to most students
nearly as soon as they arrive on
campus. Professorships are named
for generous benefactors and
buildings are known by the last
names of their donors. It can be
years before the University has
the funds available to take care of
general earthquake repairs, but
when a computer magnate donates
money for a new building,
Gates / Hewlett / Packard Hall is
ready to go in virtually no time.
Sizable donations, it seems, are
the mother's milk of University
finances.
This is why it was so heartening
to hear last week that David Yang
and Jerry Filo would be endowing
a new professorship in the School
of Engineering. The recent gradu
ates, co-creators of the Internet's
first search engine, Yahoo!, donat
ed $2 million to establish a new
professorial chair focusing on the
integration of information sys
tems technology and
entrepreneurship — the areas the
pair consider integral to Yahoo's
success.
Filo and Yang created the popu
lar Yahoo! search engine — which
had one of Nasdaq's most success
ful initial public offerings in April
— in their spare time while pursu
ing doctorates at Stanford four
years ago. Each is now worth
roughly $150 million.
The Yahoo! system, which led
the wave of Internet search engines
that soon produced competitors
like Infoseek and AltaVista, was
originally housed within Stanford's
own computer system. When traffic
became too heavy, it relocated off
campus and into a partnership with
Netscape Communications Corp.

The Web site has since become a
leader in the Internet-frenzied
business sector due to its early start
on the competition and its several
offspring search engines including
regional and thematic concentra
tions.
Filo and Yang's gift is an especial
ly significant gesture considering
their young ages. The two are 28
and 30, respectively, and members
of a generation of young million
aires not known for its philan
thropy.
In the last year, two of Stan
ford's most important donors have
passed away. Gerald Cantor con
tributed much of the University's
impressive sculpture collection,
and David Packard made contribu
tions rivaling in value those of the
Stanfords themselves.
Filo and Yang, while not yet at the
Packard level of giving, have shaken
the conventional wisdom that those
in a new wealthy generation do not
contribute as did their predecessors.
It is not the responsibility of
successful alumni to give back to
their university. But if these alum
ni benefited from their experience
at Stanford, they should help
ensure that others have the same
opportunities.
The Yahoo! founders are, in
many respects, at the forefront of
their generation and their industry,
having already landed a seemingly
permanent spot in Internet history.
They have donated this sum of
money in part to recognize Stan
ford's positive influence on each of
their professional careers and to
help other graduate and undergrad
uate students experience the same.
More important, they are set
ting a precedent for increased
alumni giving from more recent
graduates, who have an imposing
tradition of donation to live up to.
Hopefully, successful young
alumni — and even those just
slightly younger than the Hewlett
and Packard age bracket — will
see Filo and Yang's donation and
realize that they, too, have ought
to be giving back to Stanford.
