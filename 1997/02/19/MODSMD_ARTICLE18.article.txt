Stanford must not withhold data to reform U.S. News

AS AN INSTITUTION that should
be committed to open inquiry,
Stanford has no business organiz
ing an information boycott of U.S. News
& World Report, no matter how repug
nant or misleading students may find its
rankings — as I do.
As a practical matter, boycotts rarely
work. American medical schools tried
and failed with U.S. News years ago.
Paradoxically, controversy keeps the
magazine's name in the news and helps
build circulation.
Instead of censorship students should
consider taking the initiative in getting
better information more widely available
at lower cost via their own independent
sties on the World Wide Web. For
starters, those might include:
All accreditation reports: Federal law
requires this information be available on

demand for any current or prospective
student at all institutions — public and
private — receiving federal student aid
funds. Few students are aware of this
law, let alone willing to spend the time
needed to ferret out the facts.
As an institution deeply committed to
peer review in such critical areas as
research and faculty appointments,
Stanford should routinely provide full
reports on the outcome of peer review
for its academic programs. Any official
responses from Stanford to the various
accrediting bodies — as well as their
rejoinder — also should be public. So far
that's never happened.
Senior surveys: These provide a Con
sumer Reports-type perspective on Stan
ford by those who have spent four years
here. While most graduating seniors
have a strongly positive view of their

education experience, especially overseas
study, they remain highly critical of aca
demic advising in the freshman and
sophomore years.
Student evaluations of teaching:
Besides being controversial with the fac
ulty, this information could be prema
ture for prospective students. But the
data's already compiled and could be
helpful for some in putting together
their own programs.
Annotated guide to additional infor
mation: This could cover a wide range:
brochures available from the Admissions
Office, student publications' subscrip
tion information, extracurricular organi
zations, student profiles, alumni club
contacts and books summarizing sys
tematic research on Stanford undergrad
uate education, such as those by Prof.
Herant Katchadourian.

At Stanford and elsewhere, most
administrators and many faculty are
reluctant to publish accreditation
reports, student surveys and teacher
evaluations because some of this infor
mation inevitably will be unscientific or
— God forbid — negative. They underes
timate the public's hunger for candor
and their institution's capacity for
improvement.
The overall objective should be to
make more student-oriented informa
tion available to those planning to invest
four years and more than $100,000 on
higher education. The success of U.S.
News and countless other commercial
guides points to the prolonged reluc
tance of many colleges to treat prospec
tive students with honesty and respect.
