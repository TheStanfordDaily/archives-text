# Delivery by U.S. Postal Service rarely meets expectations of users

B.A. Ebrahimian'B Feb. 9 letter criti
cizing The Daily for being unfair to the
Stanford post office was itself rather
unfair. I am writing to defend the origi
nal story and the people behind it.
It is true today's generation of Ameri
cans are "rush, rush, rush," as Ebrahimi
an wrote. Compared to the American
colonists in the days of the Pony Express,
of course we have become too impatient.
But this is a fast-paced nation of busy
people — we take the drive-thru at fast
food restaurants, fly across the country in
just hours and instantly send e-mail with
a click of the mouse.

Business, family and social lives have
accelerated, and the change is unstop
pable and irreversible. And the U.S.
Postal Service, on a nationwide basis,
has been able to keep up with that.
Two-day priority mail and express
overnight service were created to satisfy
today's faster pace of life. Regular first
class mail is advertised to take only a
few days. Americans, including Stanford
students, depend on the post office's
timely service.
"If the Stanford post office seems to
be slow, it just could be that we are
being impatient," Ebrahimian wrote. It's
not always a matter of impatience. I per
sonally have experienced genuine prob
lems resulting from slow postal deliver
ies here in the 94309 ZIP code. Just
before November's elections, an acquain
tance in Oregon sent me a small package
of Reform Party bumper stickers, pins
and pamphlets for me to distribute at

Ross Perot's Memorial Auditorium
speech. She sent the package by priority
mail, a service that is supposed to deliver
your parcel in two days, and sent it over
a week before the event. I did not receive
it until a few days after Perot spoke.
A dorm mate recently noticed that she
had not received a credit card bill yet.
Stores stopped accepting her credit card
because it was being denied by their
computers. After much hassle and calls
to her credit card company, she found
out that her card was denied because she
hadn't paid her bill — which was mailed
to her long before but had not yet been
delivered to her post office box.
Another consideration for a college
campus post office is care-packages.
Many parents send warm clothing,
much-needed old textbooks and favorite
foods from home. And for those away
from home for the first time at a big
university, birthday and holiday cards

with pictures from familiar places and
people mean more than any e-mail.
These are all things that are very time
sensitive, and parents shouldn't have to
pay the enormous overnight rates to
ensure reasonable delivery speed. Many
friends of mine have noted that small
packages from parents take several
weeks to arrive.
"We cannot be spoiled brats and
whine; we just have to be patient,"
Ebrahimian concluded. Yes, there are
many catalogues and junk mail and
some letters that could wait. But there
are many other things that Stanford stu
dents rely on receiving fairly quickly. We
are willing to wait a few days to receive
bills from Visa or cookies from Mom.
But a few weeks, or even months?
Patience or not, in this past-faced
world, that may be too long to wait.
