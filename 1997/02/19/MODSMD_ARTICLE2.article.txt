Stanford overseas campuses
accepted more than 250 studeato
for fall quarter 1997, the Overseas
Studies Program office an
nounced yesterday afternoon.
Accepted students were noti
fied by e-mail yesterday, although
the information was originally
scheduled to be released Friday.
The number of acceptances in
creased at the Moscow, Florence
and Paris centers, according to
Overseas Studies Asst. Director
Pam McNaughton. "Many of
these increases are in response to
the increased demand for posi
tions," she said.
Stanford in Moscow, the
newest overseas program,
achieved full capacity for the first
time, accepting 25 students. The
Oxford and Paris campuses ac
cepted 53 students each, Santiago
accepted 40, Berlin and Florence
accepted 35 and the Stanford Cen

ter for Technology and Innovation
in Kyoto accepted 10.
More than 325 students ap
plied Jast month for the 251 spots
at overseas campuses, an increase
of about 10 percent since last year,
according to Overseas Studies Di
rector Russell Berman, a German
professor.
"Ever greater numbers of un
dergraduates are seeking opportu
nities to expand the international
component of their education,"
Berman said in a press release. "I
think it reflects a growing student
interest in international affairs."
McNaughton ascribed the in
creased student interest to im
provements in the advising pro
gram. "We now have a more com
prehensive program which bene
fits both students and advisers.
There is more awareness of over
seas opportunities, and people
know how to get advice about
them," she said.
Daniel Turchin, a sophomore
accepted to the Oxford program,
praised the visibility and accessi
bility of Overseas Studies person
nel. "I think the increase in appli
cations had a lot to do with them
letting the students know what's
out there. They were very accom
modating to my needs," he said.
Although initially anxious
about the competitiveness of the
Oxford program, Turchin said he
decided to apply for a number of
reasons. "I wanted to change my
perspective on the world, and I
also wanted to be able to pursue
my major," he said.
According to McNaughton, the
opportunity to go overseas often
prompts students to explore their
own interests while learning
about another culture.

"For some students, the Over
seas Studies Program provides an
opportunity to make decisions
within their major," she said. "For
others, it can spark a change in di
rection."
McNaughton said future im
provements to the Overseas Stud
ies Program will be designed to
better integrate the students'
coursework with their life experi
ences in other countries.
"We will also try to integrate
more language learning opportu
nities into the program to help
students learn the language of
their campus better," she added.
Berman said he would like to
see improvements made on the
Stanford campus as well.
"Studying abroad is a primary
component of the Stanford educa
tion, and I'm delighted that stu
dents are so interested in overseas
studies offers," he said, "but the
real question is how the home
campus's curriculum can respond
directly to this interest."
