## Twice the victim in Palo Alto 
### 
THE PALO ALTO City Council is
currently debating a controver
sial ordinance that would ban sit
ting or lying down on downtown streets
between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m.
While the city council maintains that
the bill is intended to ensure that down
town shoppers don't trip over things or
people on the sidewalk, Police Chief
Chris Durgin has admitted that there
are no known cases of "anyone tripping
over anyone."
Most people are convinced that the
ordinance is really aimed at getting rid
of the city's homeless population from
downtown.
The "sit-lie" ordinance, as it's called,
is an assault on homeless people and a
violation of their constitutional rights.
Similar proposals around the country
have tried to ban panhandling and
sleeping in public with mixed results —
most courts have found that these are
constitutionally protected rights.
The kicker of this proposal — and
what bothers me most — is that if
charged with sitting or sleeping on the
sidewalk, violators would be issued a
fine. If they can't pay the fine, the
police could kick them out of town.
Out of sight, out of mind — an inter
esting strategy for dealing with home
lessness, to say the least.
It's a Band-Aid solution to a tough
problem — sort of like cleaning your

room by shoving all your junk and dirty
laundry into a closet. The laundry just
continues to pile up in that closet, get
ting stinkier and stinkier.
Similarly, our nation's solution to
social problems, over and over again, is
to simply shove them out of sight. Solv
ing the homeless problem means
addressing the underlying causes —
alcohol and drug abuse, mental illness,
child and spousal abuse, a lack of jobs or
an inability to perform them. Whether
it's a jail, a homeless shelter or even an
old-folks home, our society seems to
think that it can pack away its collective
dirty laundry and pretend it never
existed.
We live on ione of the most affluent
and beautiful campuses in the nation.
Whenever I go home I am literally sur
prised to see elderly people, poor people,
even ugly people simply because there
aren't that many around Stanford.
Living here, it's easy to forget that
social problems aren't simply chapters
in your sociology book or concepts for a
paper.
Most community service happens off
campus, far away from our protected
little paradise — in fact, when the Stan
ford Homelessness Action Coalition,
the student group dedicated to serving
the area's homeless people, put in a
request to have a meal for the homeless
on campus, their request was promptly

rejected. What? Poor people at Stan
ford?!
I am well aware of the reasons not to
allow homeless people on Stanford's
campus or in the downtown streets of
Palo Alto. They're noisy. They smell.
They hurt business. They're dangerous.
They're ugly. They make us uncomfort
able. They are not like us.
For my part, I'm glad for their pres
ence. I'm glad for the reminder that
everything isn't great and hunky-dory
in the world. I'm glad for the reminder
that not everyone is lucky enough to be
able to pay Stanford's tuition every
quarter or even to eat a meal every day.
I'm glad for the reminder that when our
society makes collective decisions about
things like drastically cutting welfare,
we also have a collective responsibility
to deal with the consequences. I'm glad
for the reminder that there's still a lot
of work to be done.
Anyone poor, smelly, abused, men
tally ill, drug-addicted, old or otherwise
socially unacceptable deserves our
respect, our help or at least our compas
sion — not a one-way ticket out of town.
