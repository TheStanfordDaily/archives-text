# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## The 						value of surprises: a message to professional spoilers 
### 
EVERY STORY EVER written ends
one of three ways: Someone gets
kissed, someone gets killed or the
Death Star explodes. And that's it.
Whether it's a movie, a novel or an "ABC
Trashy Movie of the Week," the scenario
is always the same. The scriptwriter
makes it to the second-to-last page and
then randomly chooses one of The Three
Endings to complete his / her masterpiece.
Now I'm not saying this is good, bad or
ugly. I'm just saying that this is the current
state of endings in America today.
Kissed / killed / explodes is the perfect
assortment of endings for any story, and I
have absolutely no problem with this. I do,
however, have a problem with that guy who
always feels that it is his job to ruin the end
ing by telling me which one it is going to be.
For simplicity's sake, let's call him Joe.
You've met Joe, right? He's the guy who
refers to jokes by their punch lines. "Hey,
Jeremy," he says at dinner, "have you
heard the one about the nun with the spear
in her head?" I take a bite of spaghetti.
"No, Joe," I reply, "I haven't."

Joe gets excited. "What's black and
white and red all over and can't go
through a revolving door?" I twirl my
spaghetti around my fork.
"I don't know, Joe. What?"
"A nun with a spear in her head."
Joe is also the guy who laughs out loud
at his e-mail in the cluster and will finish
conversations by following you into the
bathroom. But most importantly, Joe will
tell you the ending of any movie that you
ever planned on watching. "Hey, Joe," I
say, closing the stall door, "have you ever
seen the movie 'Enter Movie Title
Here'?"
"You mean the one where the cop gets
killed in the end?"
"I wouldn't know, Joe, I've never seen
it before. Have you ever seen 'Enter Movie
Title Here Part Two'?"
"The one where they kiss in the rain at
the end of the movie, but you were sure,
right up until that moment, that he was
going to leave her instead?"
You get the point. Kissed / killed /
explodes, I don't care which one it is going

to be, I just don't want to know until it
happens. I want it to be a surprise. I like
surprises. Surprises make me think of
Christmas, where you don't know that
Rudolph is going to save the day at the end
by lighting up his nose and leading Santa's
sleigh on a foggy Christmas Eve right
before Santa blows up the Death Star.
Joe is also the guy who puts ads for the
movie soundtrack on rented videotapes.
Right before the FBI warning and right
after the other "Coming Attractions,"
Joe has gotten into the habit of placing a
"trailer" of sorts for the movie sound
track of the movie that we are about to
see. And, of course, along with the sound
track, Joe puts clips from the movie that
I will be watching in, oh, about 25 sec
onds.
Why do I want to see a scene of the two
main characters kissing in the middle of a
lake, moments before the movie starts?
Chances are, the movie begins with these
two characters hating each other, and I
don't want to be watching the movie think
ing, "Yeah, but wait 'til they get to the

lake, then she'll lift the restraining order
... after they'll kiss and all, I just know it."
Why tell me what's gonna happen? It
isn't like I need to be convinced to go see
the movie; it's already in my VCR!
Joe, of course, doesn't just specialize in
movies, he is also the guy who writes
those little blurbs on the back of best
sellers. "Meet Jane Vixen and Thomas
Studley," the glossy back cover reads.
"These two high-powered lawyers find
themselves fighting for their lives after
Mayor Willingham is mysteriously shot
dead in his Hollywood palazzo. After
falling in love they decide to escape to the
Cayman Islands, and everything seems
perfect until page 649, when Thomas is
suddenly shot dead by an unexpected
assassin's bullet. You think he'll live, but
then he dies on page 684. Sucks to be
him."
Our Joe-of-all-trades also works in the
television industry, preparing promos for
the next week's episode of all of our favorite
shows. And he writes for trade magazines
telling us who is going to leave the show

next week so we can be sure that our
favorite character will be killed off (or sent
away to "recuperate"). He also writes movie
reviews, imploring us to go to see the new
hot thriller with an "unpredictable twist at
the end." And then, of course, he proceeds
to describe in terrifying detail what makes
this particular twist so unpredictable.
Joe, if you're out there, get a clue! We
don't want to know if they'll kiss in the
rain at the end! And we don't want to
know if he's going to get double-crossed
and killed in the final standoff! And Joe,
we certainly don't want to know that Luke
expertly leads the rebels to victory with
one perfectly aimed missile that starts a
chain reaction that causes the entire
Death Star to explode into a ball of flames!
So keep it a secret, would ya'?

Jeremy Desmon, a senior majoring in
public policy, actually knows Joe but
doesn't want to ruin the surprise.
