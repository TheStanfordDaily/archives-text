## Sand Hill projects to build housing on Ohlone field Archaeologists hope to minimize environmental impact of field's development 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
With the rallying cry of "Leave
it Ohlone!" a local association
called Mid-Peninsula Action for
Tomorrow has made the preserva
tion of Ohlone field, a location for
construction in Stanford's Sand
Hill Road project, the theme of its
campaign against the plan.
For Peter Drekmeier, founder
of MPACT and director of the envi
ronmental association Bay Area
Action, there are plenty of reasons
Stanford should leave Ohlone field
alone.
In addition to being the last
large open space adjacent to a nat
ural creek in the Bay Area, Drek
meier said, the field located on the
Western edge of the campus is an
archaeologically sensitive site. It
contains, in particular, artifacts
left by Native Americans from the
Ohlone nation.
The Ohlone inhabited the area
before the Spanish and the Ameri
cans, first arriving more than
3,000 years ago.
Stanford's development projects
include widening Sand Hill Road
and building housing on Ohlone
Field, in addition to an expansion
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
The environmental impact
report for the project, currently
awaiting approval from the Palo
Alto City Council, defines three
levels of archaeological sensitivity.
Level I indicates the highest con
centration of artifacts or the pres
ence of human remains.
"Stanford is not going to be
developing the area closest to the
creek, a level I sensitivity area,"
Drekmeier said. "They want to
develop level II and 111. More
importantly, if the [Sand Hill
Road] bridge is widened, it would

encroach on a level I zone."
"We think it would be beneficial
to move the housing out of Ohlone
Field," Drekmeier said.
Laura Jones, the campus
archaeologist, admitted that "peo
ple are concerned. But it's more an
emotional concern." According to
her, Stanford will minimize the
archaeological impact of the plan.
Jones conducted extensive
research on the sites of the Sand
Hill project with other archaeolo
gists between 1983 and 1989. They

used surface surveys and some
subsurface testing. Archaeological
excavations are limited because
they are destructive.
In surface surveys, five or six
people walk in parallel lines and
stop at regular intervals to take
samples of the soil surface. They
often find small artifacts, such as
fragments of stone tools, and
dietary material, such as animal
bones and shells, that have been
brought to the surface by burrow
ing animals.

Archaeologists are continuously
perfecting the methods used to sep
arate soil from artifacts. They used
to push soil through "window
screens," a tedious process. Now,
they experiment with dissolving
the soil in water, which allows
them to recover even smaller arti
fact fragments.
Archaeologists found three vil
lages in Ohlone Field, each occu
pied at a different time. All the vil
lages were located close to San
Francisquito Creek. The Ohlone

depended on the creek for food and
water. In addition, much of the
food they ate, such as acorns, had
to be leached. "The creek was cen
tral to their economy," Jones said.
The Sand Hill Road projects
locate housing in Ohlone Field
away from the creek. "Scientifical
ly, it's the area of least impact,"
Jones said.
Even if the potential impact is
minimized, it cannot be completely
eliminated.
"The housing projects are not

on top of villages," Jones said. "But
are they on top of edges of vil
lages?" According to her, the edges
are difficult to define because arti
facts diminish in frequency away
from the village center.
According to Jones, the soil
there will be removed by archaeol
ogists, not with bulldozers. The
artifacts found will be added to the
Stanford collection for future
research.
If a burial site is found, a possi
bility that Jones doesn't rule out,
the law requires that Native Amer
ican communities be consulted.
"Increasingly, they choose to
excavate themselves, for religious
reasons," Jones said. The commu
nities may then decide to rebury
the remains close to the sites where
they were found or to move them
to Jasper Ridge, Stanford's biologi
cal preserve.
If the concerns over archaeo
logical sites are being addressed
by Stanford, why then, as Drek
meier pointed out, is there no dia
log between environmental asso
ciations and the campus archaeol
ogist?
Jones offered one response. If
trees were planted, for instance,
the Ohlone sites may be disturbed
by the holes and by the tree roots.
"People want to plant trees. It is
not good for archaeological sites,"
she explained.
Sometimes, she said, the preser
vation of cultural resources and
the preservation of other resources
are in conflict.
Jones said she has good feelings
about the way Stanford deals with
cultural resources. Relationships
between Native American commu
nities and Stanford are also very
good, she said. "I know them very
well. If they're unhappy about it,
they'll tell me."
