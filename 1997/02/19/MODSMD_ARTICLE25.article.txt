QWhat do the different blood types mean'?
A. If you've watched any of the multitudi
• nous hospital emergency room drama
shows on television recently, you've no doubt
noticed that during emergencies, the doctors are
always asking for "O-negative" blood, or "O
neg," which is a much cooler and more dramatic
way of saying it.
However, if you've ever donated blood or had
a blood test of any kind, chances are your blood
type is not O-negative. So it might puzzle you
that they're always using it.
Luckily for you, this whole blood type thing
was figured out around 1900 when a man named
Karl Landsteiner first documented the different
human blood types.
See, before we knew about blood types, blood
transfusions were terribly useless because every
once in a while, the patient receiving blood
would have horrible reactions to it and doctors
couldn't figure out why. What Landsteiner did
was to divide up human blood into four different
categories according to how the different types
of blood react with each other,
Landsteiner found that human blood could be

divided into the following groups: A, B, AB and O.
These blood types represent the antigens that are
found on the surface of the red blood cells and the
antibodies found in the plasma of their blood.
An antigen is a molecule on the surface of the
red blood cell that can be identified by its corre
sponding antibody. The red blood cell is then
attacked by the antibody, and then, well, bad
things happen. In general, doctors try to avoid
having bad things happen inside their patients.
The groups that Landsteiner found are catego
rized by which antigens are found on the surface of
the red blood cells. In A and AB blood, the A-anti
gen is found on the surface of the cell. In Band AB
blood, the B-antigen is found. However, for people
with type O blood, neither antigen is present.
The types of antibodies found in the plas
ma, the liquid part of the blood is the opposite
of the blood type. If it weren't, then your
blood would be attacking itself constantly,
and that wouldn't really mesh too well with
its main goal of keeping you alive.
Type A and type O blood have B-antibodies,
while type Band type O blood have A-antibod
ies. People with AB blood do not have either A
or B antibodies.
This is why people with type AB blood are
called universal acceptors — they can receive
any type of blood because they have no antibod
ies that react to transfused red blood cells.
Type Os are called universal donors because
they have no antigens on their red blood cells
which will activate antibodies. That's why the
doctors are always shouting for type O blood.
How about the positive and negative? That
refers to another factor in the blood, called the
Rh factor, which determines whether or not the
red blood cells have the D-antigen or not.
People who are Rh-negative and receive Rh-pos
itive blood quickly develop D-antibodies (which are
not naturally found in the plasma but are easily
provoked into existence). Subsequent donations of
Rh-positive blood will cause severe reactions.
Therefore, to be on the safe side, O-negative
blood will be least likely to cause trouble in a
patient with an unknown blood type. Of course,
on television, it's not real blood. It's all just type
O ketchup.
