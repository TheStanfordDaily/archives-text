# The
						a-maize-ing uses of corn

What do drinking a Coke,
brushing your teeth, driving a
car,and reading The Daily have in
common? They're all done by Stan
ford students on a regular basis —
but more importantly, they all
involve products made from corn.
Sodas are sweetened with corn
syrup. Toothpaste contains sor
bitol, a sweetening powder pro
cessed from corn. Cars run on
fuel containing ethanol, a corn
derivative. Last, the paper fibers
of the newspaper you are reading
are held together with corn
starch.
But that's just the kernel of it. |
Corn derivatives are found in
glues, dry-cell batteries, crayons,
fireworks, molded plastics,
aspirin, soaps, kitty litter,
peanut butter, jelly, mayonnaise,
tobacco and antibiotics, just to
name a few.
"Corn," said Biology Prof. Vir
ginia Walbot, "is our most impor
tant crop."
Walbot's research involves the
expression of plant genes using
transposon mutations in maize —
another name for corn.
"It occupies about 80,000,000
acres of the country," she said, "or
about one-third of an acre per per
son. As production is about 120
bushels per acre, there is over one
ton of corn produced per person in
the U.S."
So why don't we find ourselves
up to our ears in corn?
In the United States, roughly
62 percent of all corn produced is
used as livestock feed, which
means that the scrambled eggs
you had for breakfast came from
a corn-fed chicken and the glass
of milk you drank came from a
corn-fed cow.

Only 3 percent is used for
human food, including everyone's
favorites: corn on the cob, popcorn,
corn chips, tortillas and cereals, as
well as cooking ingredients like
corn starch and corn oil.
Corn products can be derived
from all parts of an ear of corn,
often making it unrecognizable, as
in chewing gum, puddings, salad
dressing, ketchup, margarine, ice
cream, marshmallows, licorice,
beer, extracts, flavors, instant tea
and lactic acid.
Corn derivatives are also used in
cosmetics, drugs and pharmaceuti
cals, and in food and drug coatings.
Fifteen percent of the corn pro
duced is used for industrial raw
material, as in binding agents,
sandpaper, dyes, insecticides, sur
gical dressings, lubricating
agents, film emulsion, paints,
rubber tires, wallpaper, candles,
drinking straws, shoe polish,
explosives, octane enhancers,
amino acids, rust preventatives
and textiles.
Corn is important also in indus
trial processes such as paper man
ufacturing, electroplating, galva
nizing, water recovery and leather
tanning.
Corn products also help con
sumers become Earth-friendlv.
Biodegradable plastic is corn
starch-based and is used to make
trash bags, writing pens and other
disposable products.
Eco-foam, a natural loosefill
packaging material which is made
from corn starch and dissolves in
water, is a renewable alternative to
styrofoam peanuts.
The final 20 percent of corn the
United States produces is export
ed. "We are a lucky country in that
we can grow enough food to feed
ourselves and have a major export
business in food while only grow

ing plants on prime agricultural
land," Walbot said.
Current research is being done
on corn to improve crop yields.
"At the turn of the century each
plant required about one square
yard of land to grow. Now it is
down to one square foot. About
half of the improved yield results
from better genetics and about half
from agronomic practices," Walbot
explained.
"In other countries, poor land
must be used because there is not
enough production on prime land
to feed the people. By increasing
production per acre, society bene
fits by keeping other land in natu
ral reserves, in forests, in water
ways, etc. We don't have to use
every acre just for marginal food
production."
Research in genetic engineer
ing is also being done on corn.
"The major revolution of
genetic engineering is that one
gene at a time can be added to a
species," said Walbot. Whereas in
nature each organism gets two
sets of genes, one from each par
ent, in genetic engineering, a sin
gle gene from corn, wheat or bac
teria can be added to an existing
line of corn.
Adding one gene at a time has
allowed researchers to produce
corn crops that are resistant to
herbicides as well as pests such as
the bollweevil, so that fewer
crops die from routine field
sprayings, less insecticides are
necessary to protect crops and
less poison from insecticides
cloud our atmosphere.
"Of course, not every genetic
engineering story is a success,"
Walbot added. "We have to judge
the final results in terms of the
farmer, the consumer, our society
and the whole ecosystem."
