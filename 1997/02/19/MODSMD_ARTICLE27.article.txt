# Primordial Earth revealed

Donald Lowe began digging deep into
the history of our planet. He spent
two decades in Soutn Africa studying
what would have been the Earth's
crust 2.5 to 3.5 billion years ago.
According to Lowe, "It would

appear that early oceans were quite different: differ
ent chemical composition, more chemical sediments,
etc." He observed that the ancient oceans were strat
ified into two separate layers that did not mix very
well. "The surface was like today's oceans, but the
deep ocean had no oxygen and lots of iron," he said.
These peculiar oceans also took up much more room.
Less than 10 percent of today's land mass was actually
present back then, said Lowe. The rest was probably
under water. Of that relatively small amount of land,
most was made up of volcanic islands.
At that time, life on Earth consisted of nothing
more than bacteria and other microscopic beings.
Lowe and his collaborators found large amounts of
carbon in sedimentary rocks, which indicates the

existence of bacterial and microscopic organisms.
However, unlike today, when land-loving creatures
abound, most of these primordial organisms were
aquatic creatures. "No evidence shows that they
lived on the land surface," said Lowe.
