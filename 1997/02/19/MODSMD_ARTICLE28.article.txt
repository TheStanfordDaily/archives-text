# Plausible explanation for TWA 800
## 
### 
While investigators from the
National Transportation Safety
Board continue to puzzle over the
cause of the fatal explosion of TWA
Flight 800 last July, Petroleum Engi
neering Prof. Emeritus Sullivan
Marsden believes he may have the
answer.
Marsden said in a statement that

"streaming potentials," which often cause discharges
of static electricity, may have ignited jet fuel vapors in
the partially empty main fuel tank of the aircraft.
"Streaming potentials occur when a liquid con
taining charged particles such as ions is pumped
through a tube or pipe made of an electrically insu
lating material," he said.
"Pumping of jet fuel through rubber or plastic

pipes or tubes could have generated an electrostatic
potential which could supply em igniting spark."
Currently, tests are being conducted to validate, or
eliminate the spark discharge theory. CNN reported
on Friday that contrary to Marsden's theory, "a pre
liminary test by the NTSB failed to produce the kind
of static buildup in fuel lines necessary to ignite an
explosion in the plane's fuel tank."
However, CNN added that "a source at the NTSB
warns that the completed tests are just the first of a
series to determine whether a buildup of electro
static electricity could have caused the explosion
that led to the crash."
Whether or not the crash of TWA Flight 800 was
caused by a spark discharge, Marsden suggested that
precautions can be taken to minimize the chance of
static-electricity related disasters in the future. The
addition of anti-static agents to jet fuel and inspection
of O-rings and gasket seals in fuel lines could correct
any potential problems.
"1 am not saying that [a static discharge] was def
initely the reason," Marsden said. "But it is consis
tent both with the facts as I know them and the long
experience of the petroleum industry for closely relat
ed situations." â€” Rollin Hu
