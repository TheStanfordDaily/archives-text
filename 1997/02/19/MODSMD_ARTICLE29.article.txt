### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Comparative Literature and German Stud
ies Prof. Russell Berman will be honored with
the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany next month in
recognition for his contribution to promoting
and improving the teaching of the German lan
guage in the United States.
Berman is scheduled to receive the cross —
the highest decoration given by Germany — at a
ceremony at the Faculty Club on March 5.
Currently chair of the German Studies De
partment and director of the Stanford Overseas
Studies Program, Berman has been a member
of Stanford's faculty since 1979. He has taught
a number of undergraduate and graduate cours
es in various topics of German culture and liter
ature and has also lectured in the Myth and
Modernity track of the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues Program.
Known for raising interest in German stud
ies, Berman said his goals include implementing
innovative approaches to the subject's teaching.
"Teaching German in the United States
today requires a reflection on the core issues and
goals involved in learning about another cul
ture," he said. "We should be conveying to stu
dents a complex familiarity with the concerns,
values and histories of another society and

make them more reflective regarding our own
society."
Berman said he strives to accomplish this
goal by "thinking through reasons [why] as
pects of German history and culture would be of
particular interest to American students."
His efforts at trying to "maintain the study of
German as an exciting, intellectual opportunity
for students" are currently being rewarded, as
the German Studies Department at Stanford is
beginning to set the norm for other universities
across the nation.
As a high school student, Berman had the op
portunity to spend a year in Austria where he
was introduced to an entirely new culture and
language.
"This kind of deep familiarity with another
place can enrich one's life significantly. That
ought to be the goal of the language and culture
component of undergraduate education," he
said.
In order to achieve such an enrichment with
out the actual overseas experience, "the Ger
man Studies Department, as well as all foreign
language departments, must reinvent the intro
ductory course to make them as intellectually
[stimulatingl as any other course on campus,"
he added.
He also said the teaching in the German
Studies Department "should be reoriented so
that the issue isn't just grammatical inaccuracy

or rote memory but rather the understanding of
the culture through its language."
Germany has been an opponent of the Unit
ed States in two mgyor wars of the century and is
therefore an intimate part of American history,
according to Berman.
"It remains a rich and complex object for in
tellectual inquiry, and our curriculum should
open that complexity up to students," he said.
Berman also advocates the involvement of
academic counsel in undergraduate teaching.
Faculty should be involved at all levels of the
curriculum, and professors should work closely
with undergraduate students, he said.
Under his leadership, the Overseas Studies
Program has seen an increased enrollment of
students, especially in the Berlin program. More
than 500 students have studied there and have
been placed in jobs throughout the German
economy.
In addition to his numerous duties at Stan
ford, Berman has also published several books
and articles focusing on the literature and politics
of 19th and 20th-century Germany. He recently
completed a book project on German culture and
its encounter with the non-European world.
Berman is the second Stanford professor to
win the award this academic year. History Prof.
Norman Naimark was awarded the Officer's
Cross in October for his work and research in
German history.
