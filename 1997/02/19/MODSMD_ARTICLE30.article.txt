## Lambert desires a championship 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Stanford consistently upholds
its strong tradition of housing
some of the most talented ath
letes in the nation. But even
among the cream of the crop
exist standouts, and senior vol
leyball player Mike Lambert no
doubt fits in this category.
Coming off a stint in the 1996
Olympics and currently leading a
Stanford volleyball squad that is
ranked No. 1 in the country,
Lambert is widely considered to
be the most talented player ever
to don a Cardinal men's volley
ball jersey.
"Lambert is one of those ath
letes at Stanford (whom) the rest
of us have a unique and very lim
ited opportunity to watch close
up," said Stanford volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves. "And com
ing off the Olympics at the top of
his game, he is playing the best
volleyball of his Stanford career
right now."
"I love competing," Lambert
said. "Generally, I'm a mellow,
take-it-easy, Hawaii-native guy,
but there's definitely a side to me
that loves to win and hates to
lose."
Lambert's skilled and intense
playing can next be witnessed on
Cardinal turf Friday in a game
against Pacific in Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. The game will
mark the second contest in a five
match homestand that the Cardi
nal team, which has been strug
gling lately on the road, hopes
will draw large crowds that will
help turn around its record.
Despite a few close matches

ending in Cardinal opponents'
favor, when Lambert is on the
court, there appears to be little to
fear. At 6-foot-6, Lambert's
biggest strength lies in his depth
— he's good at everything.
Nieves cited spiking and blocking
as Lambert's specific strengths,
but attributes his overall success
on the volleyball court to a fully
developed game.
Olympic competition provided
Lambert with the perfect oppor
tunity to further his game. After
an extended tryout in which he
competed with 18 of the best
players in the country, Lambert
was selected as one of the 12 play
ers on the U.S. National Team
and took off last year (what
would have been his senior year
at Stanford) to train for the
Olympics.
"Walking into the Opening
Ceremonies, being surrounded
by all the great athletes — it was
very humbling — and exciting,"
Lambert said. "I remember
thinking, 'I used to be watching
these people on TV, and now I'm
here.' "
"There aren't any words to
explain seeing your sibling play
on the national team," said Lam
bert's younger sister, Debbie,
who went to Atlanta with her
parents to watch her brother in
the 1996 Games.
"In high school I remember
Mike always popping in a tape of
the Olympic team playing — he
would watch them religiously
after school," said Debbie, who is
a junior and also a Stanford vol
leyball player. "It was ironic see

ing him play on the same side of
the net as those guys he grew up
watching."
With the Olympics behind him,
Lambert has returned to Stanford
for his fourth and final volleyball
season with only one thing on his
mind: the NCAA championship for
Stanford.
"I just want to win; that's all I
can think about," Lambert said.
"This year by far is Stanford's best
chance at the NCAAs. We have a
lot of depth with the experience
from the seniors and having the
top recruit in the nation."
Lambert's role will be decisive
in whether or not the team makes
it to the championships. Not only
is he depended on for his physical
skill, Lambert is leading the team
psychologically as well.
"Since his return from the
national team, Mike's greatest
impact has been his leadership on
and off the court, in practice and
during competition," Nieves said.
"During practice, he is so vocal and
enthusiastic. Mike has taken it
upon himself to give the team an
emotional lift day in and day out."
Fellow volleyball player and
senior co-captain Matt Fuer
bringer agreed.
"Mike sets the tone in practice
and in games. If he struggles, we
struggle. This year he has realized
his role in what he has to do for the
team," he said.
"Determination to win the
championships is what Mike is all
about right now," said Fuer
bringer, who is also a close friend
and roommate of Lambert's. "Liv

ing together, our lives are revolv
ing around volleyball. If we miss
something for volleyball, it doesn't
faze us."
Fuerbringer attributes Lam
bert's intensity this year to matu
rity and the knowledge gained by
playing on the national team, as
well as the fact that it is his last
chance to lead Stanford to the
national championship.
"He definitely has an itch to win
the NCAA championship and get a
ring," said Debbie Lambert, who
has two of her own NCAA rings
earned in December 1994 and
1996 when the Cardinal women's
volleyball team conquered the
competition at the Final Four. The
Lamberts' oldest sibling, Mia, also
has a ring from her days playing
volleyball at UCLA. "I think
there's definitely a little rivalry
there," Debbie said.
Hard work and natural talent
as well as an unswerving commit
ment to volleyball have led Lam
bert to success. He began playing
volleyball in the seventh grade
when, after years of playing soccer,
his interest was sparked by Mia
picking up volleyball in high
school. Lambert started practicing
in his yard. "I'd just try to serve
the volleyball across my driveway,"
he said.
Due to the abundance of beach
es in Hawaii and a community
revolving around collegiate-level
sports such as volleyball (there are
no professional teams in Hawaii),
playing both beach and indoor vol
leyball became a lifestyle for Lam
bert.
Lambert played on Punahou
High School's team in Honolulu
for four years, where he helped
lead the team to state champi
onship titles. He also played beach

volleyball for the Outrigger Canoe
Club during this time and won a
gold medal at the Junior Olympic
beach volleyball championships,
where he was spotted by college
recruits.
After graduation from Stan
ford, Lambert, a political science
major, hopes to incorporate his
love for both types of volleyball by
playing beach volleyball during the
summer and then going overseas
from October until April to play
indoor volleyball in professional
leagues. Lambert also hopes to
compete in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
Lambert's plan is to make
enough money being a professional
athlete to eventually open a busi
ness. "I know I want to work for
myself," he said.
Despite Lambert's focus on vol
leyball, he is anything but one
dimensional. A member of Phi
Delta Theta, Lambert also plays
the guitar, enjoys cooking and
loves to read, citing Tom Robbin's
"Jitterbug Perfume," Ayn Rand's
"Fountainhead" and Joseph
Heller's "Catch-22" as some of his
favorite books.
Lambert said his father, who
works as a pilot for Hawaiian
Airlines, participates in a sym
phony, teaches music and dab
bles in photography, is the real
renaissance man in the family.
Lambert's mother, whom his
father met during the Korean
War, is a realtor.
Lambert has no regrets about
devoting so much of his time to vol
leyball.
"I have made no sacrifices,"
Lambert said. "Volleyball has
given me the opportunity to come
to a great university, to go to the
Olympics. I owe everything to it."
