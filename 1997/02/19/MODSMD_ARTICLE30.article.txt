## Lambert desires a championship 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Stanford consistently upholds
its strong tradition of housing
some of the most talented ath
letes in the nation. But even
among the cream of the crop
exist standouts, and senior vol
leyball player Mike Lambert no
doubt fits in this category.
Coming off a stint in the 1996
Olympics and currently leading a
Stanford volleyball squad that is
ranked No. 1 in the country,
Lambert is widely considered to
be the most talented player ever
to don a Cardinal men's volley
ball jersey.
"Lambert is one of those ath
letes at Stanford (whom) the rest
of us have a unique and very lim
ited opportunity to watch close
up," said Stanford volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves. "And com
ing off the Olympics at the top of
his game, he is playing the best
volleyball of his Stanford career
right now."
"I love competing," Lambert
said. "Generally, I'm a mellow,
take-it-easy, Hawaii-native guy,
but there's definitely a side to me
that loves to win and hates to
lose."
Lambert's skilled and intense
playing can next be witnessed on
Cardinal turf Friday in a game
against Pacific in Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m. The game will
mark the second contest in a five
match homestand that the Cardi
nal team, which has been strug
gling lately on the road, hopes
will draw large crowds that will
help turn around its record.
Despite a few close matches

ending in Cardinal opponents'
favor, when Lambert is on the
court, there appears to be little to
fear. At 6-foot-6, Lambert's
biggest strength lies in his depth
— he's good at everything.
Nieves cited spiking and blocking
as Lambert's specific strengths,
but attributes his overall success
on the volleyball court to a fully
developed game.
Olympic competition provided
Lambert with the perfect oppor
tunity to further his game. After
an extended tryout in which he
competed with 18 of the best
players in the country, Lambert
was selected as one of the 12 play
ers on the U.S. National Team
and took off last year (what
would have been his senior year
at Stanford) to train for the
Olympics.
"Walking into the Opening
Ceremonies, being surrounded
by all the great athletes — it was
very humbling — and exciting,"
Lambert said. "I remember
thinking, 'I used to be watching
these people on TV, and now I'm
here.' "
"There aren't any words to
explain seeing your sibling play
on the national team," said Lam
bert's younger sister, Debbie,
who went to Atlanta with her
parents to watch her brother in
the 1996 Games.
"In high school I remember
Mike always popping in a tape of
the Olympic team playing — he
would watch them religiously
after school," said Debbie, who is
a junior and also a Stanford vol
leyball player. "It was ironic see

with one goal in mind — an NCAA championship.
