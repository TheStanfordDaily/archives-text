# Spikers crush Gauchos in home MPSF opener
## Fuerbringer, Lambert lead No. 2 Cardinal to 15-13, 15-5, 15-5 romp 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Last night the Stanford men's vol
leyball team put on a real display of its
ability, thoroughly beating UC-Santa
Barbara in every aspect of the match.
The Gauchos, who had high hopes
coming in, found themselves playing
the roll of clown at the Card's home
opening party, going down without
much of a struggle in three games 15-
13, 15-5, 15-5.
"As a team this was our strongest
match of the year, but a lot of it had to
do with Santa Barbara having a real
bad night," said senior outside hitter

Matt Fuerbringer. "Even so, we
played real well."
Even though the match turned
into a blowout, it did not appear that
it would be so one-sided early on. In
the opening moments of the first
game, things looked somewhat grim
for the Cardinal (6-2, 4-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation), after
senior setter Stewart Chong
appeared to struggle early and senior
outside hitter Mike Lambert's first
offensive attempt was blocked by
Santa Barbara's front line. Perhaps it
was the fact that they had yet to play
a home match this season, but the
Stanford players appeared nervous

and the game stayed close.
As the game wore on, however,
Stanford built a lead, running away
from Santa Barbara 14-8. Just when
it appeared that the Gauchos (5-5, 5-3
MPSF) were ready to pack it in, their
resistance stiffened and they refused
to let Stanford have the final point of
the game, much to the dismay of the
463 fans who rose to their feet every
time the Cardinal got the serve in
anticipation of the game's end. Final
ly, after letting the Gauchos back into
the match at 14-13, the squad closed
out the match on a stuff block by
senior middle blocker Mike Hoefer.
"We got off to a pretty good start in

game one, but I did begin to get pretty
nervous when things began to get
close at the end," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "It was really impor
tant to win that first game."
Games two and three were never
close, both following essentially the
same pattern. In game two, Stanford
jumped out to an early 5-1 lead and
eventually led by as much as 11-3.
Toward the end of the game, Santa
Barbara made some effort to stay in
it, preventing the Cardinal from clos
ing it out quickly with a succession of
sideouts but failing to score any
points. Although they may have
been frustrated, the Stanford play
ers kept their poise and eventually
closed out the game 15-5.
Between games two and three,
in what may have been the most
dramatic moment of the match,
Santa Barbara outside hitter
Kevin Collins, obviously frustrated
by his team's ineffectiveness,
decided to blame the Stanford
fans. As he went back to serve to
begin game three, he began to com
plain to the officials about the fans
behind him, vexed by their taunts.
Stanford's Lambert quickly
smoothed over the situation, ask
ing the fans to move over to the
Stanford side of the net where they
made their opinions about Riley
and his Santa Barbara teammates
known with new fervor.
Game three saw the Cardinal
jump out to any early lead of 7-0
and eventually lead 13-3 before
closing out the game and the
match on an emphatic block by
senior setter Stewart Chong.
After the match, the spotlight
was on Fuerbringer as he was
named Stanford's player of the
match. Fuerbringer, playing on a
sprained ankle, was truly domi
nant, returning to the form that
made him an All-American last
year.
"Matt was really outstanding
tonight," Nieves said. "When he
came to the gym, he was limping so
bad that I was sure he wouldn't
play, but he said, 'It feels all right;
let me give it a go and see how it
feels. I'll let you know if it hurts.'
Obviously, it didn't bother him too
much. His two best matches of the
year have both followed ankle
sprains; maybe we need to twist it
a bit before every match."
"The ankle didn't really bother
me," Fuerbringer said. "I think
that it really loosened me up, and I
just went out and played my game.
I have had to get used to getting
fewer sets because of the way Mike
and (freshman) Andy (Witt) have
been playing. Tonight I called for
every set and made the most of the
ones that came my way."
Indeed, if Fuerbringer, who had

18 kills and hit .536, Witt, who had
11 kills and hit .529, and Lambert,
who led the Card with 19 kills, all
continue to play the way they did

last night, this trio of outside hit
ters should prove as impossible to
stop for every other team as it did
for the Gauchos.
