# Spikers crush Gauchos in home MPSF opener
## Fuerbringer, Lambert lead No. 2 Cardinal to 15-13, 15-5, 15-5 romp 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Last night the Stanford men's vol
leyball team put on a real display of its
ability, thoroughly beating UC-Santa
Barbara in every aspect of the match.
The Gauchos, who had high hopes
coming in, found themselves playing
the roll of clown at the Card's home
opening party, going down without
much of a struggle in three games 15-
13, 15-5, 15-5.
"As a team this was our strongest
match of the year, but a lot of it had to
do with Santa Barbara having a real
bad night," said senior outside hitter

Matt Fuerbringer. "Even so, we
played real well."
Even though the match turned
into a blowout, it did not appear that
it would be so one-sided early on. In
the opening moments of the first
game, things looked somewhat grim
for the Cardinal (6-2, 4-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation), after
senior setter Stewart Chong
appeared to struggle early and senior
outside hitter Mike Lambert's first
offensive attempt was blocked by
Santa Barbara's front line. Perhaps it
was the fact that they had yet to play
a home match this season, but the
Stanford players appeared nervous

and the game stayed close.
As the game wore on, however,
Stanford built a lead, running away
from Santa Barbara 14-8. Just when
it appeared that the Gauchos (5-5, 5-3
MPSF) were ready to pack it in, their
resistance stiffened and they refused
to let Stanford have the final point of
the game, much to the dismay of the
463 fans who rose to their feet every
time the Cardinal got the serve in
anticipation of the game's end. Final
ly, after letting the Gauchos back into
the match at 14-13, the squad closed
out the match on a stuff block by
senior middle blocker Mike Hoefer.
"We got off to a pretty good start in

game one, but I did begin to get pretty
nervous when things began to get
close at the end," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "It was really impor
tant to win that first game."
Games two and three were never
close, both following essentially the
same pattern. In game two, Stanford
jumped out to an early 5-1 lead and
eventually led by as much as 11-3.
Toward the end of the game, Santa
Barbara made some effort to stay in
it, preventing the Cardinal from clos
ing it out quickly with a succession of
sideouts but failing to score any
