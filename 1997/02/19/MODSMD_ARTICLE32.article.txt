Becky Blevins
While a .250 winning percentage might not demonstrate
pitching dominance, Becky Blevins' recent 1-3 won-lost
record is misleading, to say the least. Shouldering an
increased workload to compensate for the injury of another
starting pitcher, the sophomore hurler has taken the
mound for the Cardinal in four of its last six games, compil
ing a 1.74 ERA that would make even Greg Maddux envi
ous. Suffering through an excess of unearned runs and a
dearth of offensive support, Blevins has been able to
squeeze only one victory out of four outstanding starts.
That single win? A no-hitter against St. Mary's.

Kris Wecms
Sophomore shooting guard Kris Weems came out of his
slump in a big way in Stanford's home blowouts of Oregon
and Oregon State last week. Weems led Stanford in scoring
on the weekend with 32 points on 12-of-23 shooting from
the field, including 6-of-10 from long range. He was instru
mental in the Cardinal's outside game as Stanford shot 40
percent from behind the arc, continuing its record-breaking
season from the perimeter. Weems also committed just two
turnovers in 58 minutes of play as the No. 20 Cardinal
pushed its record to 15-6 and 8-5 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence heading into tomorrow's game at Washington State.
