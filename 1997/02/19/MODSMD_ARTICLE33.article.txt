# Cal drowned by women
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford women's swimming and
diving team had an easy time last weekend, destroying
the California Golden Bears by 110 points in Berkeley's
Spieker Complex on Friday. The 203-93 victory pushed
the Cardinal's dual meet record to 10-0, while Cal
dropped to 13-4.
What should be even scarier to the rest of the coun
try is not the margin of victory, but the fact that many
of Stanford's top swimmers either did not compete or
competed in just a few events.
Two-time Olympic gold-medal winner and freshman
Catherine Fox didn't make the trip due to illness, and
senior Spanish Olympian Claudia Franco only swam in
relay as the Cardinal squad won 11 of the 14 races, in
addition to capturing top honors in both diving events.
"The No. 1 objective was to win the meet, but that
didn't seem like that big of a challenge," said senior co
captain Michelle Jesperson, who finished second in the
100 free. "I think some people used the meet to experi
ment with different racing strategies and things like
that."
The Cardinal was led by freshman Jessica Tucker-
Mohl, who won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1
minute, 50.48 seconds and the 200 backstroke with a
time of 2:03.44.
"I was just excited for the times," Tucker-Mohl said.
"It's true that the meet wasn't a huge deal, but I still
felt like I was going pretty fast."
Other Cardinal winners included sophomores Chan
tal Rawn in the 100 back (56.31), Kari Edwards in the
1,000 free (10:24.90) and Elin Austevoll in the 100
breaststroke (1:04.09), junior Michelle Collins in the
200 fly (2:02.37), freshmen Jessica Powell in the 50 free
(23.85) and Gabrielle Rose in the 100 free (51.57), as
well as senior Sarah Anderson in the 500 free (4:58.24).
Cal did manage to win three
races in the meet, taking the 100
fly, the 200 breast and the 200 indi
vidual medley. Elli Overton won
the 100 fly and the 200 breast in
57.05 and 2:17.02 respectively,
while Marylyn Chiang took the 200
IM in 2:05.29.
The Cardinal divers also
cleaned up, as sophomores Caris
sa Zenorini and Gaelyn Felix
and seniors Megan Gardner and
Stefanie Forrest all placed in
either the one-meter or three
meter events. Zenorini, who has
been strong all season, placed
first in both.
"It always helps to build your
confidence when you win," Zenori
ni said, "but I know it is much
more important that I perform
well in the upcoming bigger
meets."
The bigger meets Zenorini
speaks of are the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, which
will be held Feb. 27 to March 1 in
Federal Way, Wash., and the
NCAA Championships which will
take place March 20-22 in Indi
anapolis.
The goal for the women at Pac
10s will not only be to capture the
team title, which would be the
team's ninth straight Pac-10
championship under head coach
Richard Quick, but also to post
NCAA qualifying times. The Car
dinal used Friday's meet against
Cal to strengthen its depth going
into those meets.
"For most of the team it was
preparing for Pac-lOs; it was doing
races that will help us swim fast in
two weeks," Jesperson said. "For
others, it was swimming some off
events that they normally don't get

to swim and that aspect was a little
more fun."
With such a decisive victory in
basically a tuneup meet, the Car
dinal has all the confidence it

needs heading to Washington next
week.
"We've had a very challenging
season," Tucker-Mohl said. "I
think we have shown a lot of

strength in our team â€” everyone
has come together and done really
well when we needed to. So I think
we'll be veiy confident going into
Pac-lOs."
