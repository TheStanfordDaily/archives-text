# Cal drowned by women

The top-ranked Stanford women's swimming and
diving team had an easy time last weekend, destroying
the California Golden Bears by 110 points in Berkeley's
Spieker Complex on Friday. The 203-93 victory pushed
the Cardinal's dual meet record to 10-0, while Cal
dropped to 13-4.
What should be even scarier to the rest of the coun
try is not the margin of victory, but the fact that many
of Stanford's top swimmers either did not compete or
competed in just a few events.
Two-time Olympic gold-medal winner and freshman
Catherine Fox didn't make the trip due to illness, and
senior Spanish Olympian Claudia Franco only swam in
relay as the Cardinal squad won 11 of the 14 races, in
addition to capturing top honors in both diving events.
"The No. 1 objective was to win the meet, but that
didn't seem like that big of a challenge," said senior co
captain Michelle Jesperson, who finished second in the
100 free. "I think some people used the meet to experi
ment with different racing strategies and things like
that."
The Cardinal was led by freshman Jessica Tucker-
Mohl, who won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1
minute, 50.48 seconds and the 200 backstroke with a
time of 2:03.44.
"I was just excited for the times," Tucker-Mohl said.
"It's true that the meet wasn't a huge deal, but I still
felt like I was going pretty fast."
Other Cardinal winners included sophomores Chan
tal Rawn in the 100 back (56.31), Kari Edwards in the
1,000 free (10:24.90) and Elin Austevoll in the 100
breaststroke (1:04.09), junior Michelle Collins in the
200 fly (2:02.37), freshmen Jessica Powell in the 50 free
(23.85) and Gabrielle Rose in the 100 free (51.57), as
well as senior Sarah Anderson in the 500 free (4:58.24).
