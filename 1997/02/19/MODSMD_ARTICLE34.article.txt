# Tennis sweeps UNLV, Oregon

Despite a series of nagging injuries, the Stanford
women's tennis team refuses to be slowed, steamrolling
Pacific-10 rival Oregon and nonconference foe Nevada-
Las Vegas in the Blue Chalk Cafe Kickoff Weekend at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium on Friday and Saturday.
"Generally, there wasn't too much to talk about,"
said junior Ail-American Ania Bleszynski. "We pretty
much played good tennis and won without much trou
ble."
The second-ranked Cardinal made short work of
both squads, dropping only one match in the two dual
meets to up its record to 9-0 on the season.
Stanford opened the weekend's festivities by happily
trouncing the Runnin' Rebels in a 9-0 sweep, highlight
ed by the more than triumphant return of top seed
Anne Kremer. The freshman, who has been easing back
into the lineup after a stomach pull, showed no signs of
defect, dispatching senior Marianne Vallin, the fourth
ranked singles player in the nation. Kremer would like
ly be ranked among the top players as well, but her
injury has prevented her from playing enough matches.
"It was her first match when she was really back,"
said junior All-American Julie
Scott. "For her to come off the
injury and play really big was pret
ty amazing."
The pull had previously limited
her serve and reach and neither
seemed to be hindered in her
match against Vallin.
"All around, her game was pret
ty strong," Scott said. "She was
moving really well, looking very
fast and playing very aggressive."
While UNLV's arrival had been
anticipated as an early test from a
top-40 opponent, the Cardinal
abused the Rebels as harshly as
they have lower-ranked adver
saries.
"They had some good players at
the top of their lineup, but it was
tough for them to match up with
us all the way." Bleszynski said.

Saturday's matchup turned out
even more laid back for Stanford as
it downed Oregon to stretch its
amazing Pacific 10 Conference
dual-meet unbeaten streak to 25,
two full seasons and change. The
Cardinal ran past the No. 5 Ari
zona Wildcats earlier in its confer
ence opener.
The squad won at the Nos. 1
through 5 spots in straight sets,
dropping its only match as junior
Heidi Stalla fell in a three-set bat
tle. In doubles, Stanford had even
less trouble, giving up only two
games in three matches against the
Ducks.
"They weren't one of our
strongest conference opponents, so
we were pretty confident,"
Bleszynski said. "It was pretty
much a chance for us to get ready
for Madison."
Wisconsin's capital city is the
site of the upcoming National
Team Indoors which begin tomor
row.
