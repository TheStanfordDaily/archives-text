# Men's tennis rolls on
## Aztecs, Huskies pose no threat 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
It was another day in the park
for the No. 1 Stanford men's
tennis team (5-0) last weekend,
as it breezed past both San
Diego State and Washington by
7-0 scores.
The match of the day against
San Diego State featured sopho
more Ryan Wolters and San
Diego State's Bobby Hrdina.
Hrdina, an unranked player,
gave the 23rd-ranked player in
the country a good match before
Wolters broke away, beating
Hrdina 7-6, 6-3.
"I do not think Wolters was
playing well," Hrdina said.
"Although we had some close
games, I was working a lot hard
er to hold serve. It finally got to
me."
Wolters finally appeared con
fident and in control of the
match at 3-3 in the second set,
when he broke Hrdina and then
smashed aces past him to win
the next three games and the
match.
At the No. 2 position, junior
Paul Goldstein took the Aztecs'
Eric Faulk in straight sets, 6-4,
6-2. Playing the three and four
positions were Bob and Mike
Bryan, who had little trouble
knocking off Steve Adamson and
Nguey Lay, respectively, 6-0, 6-0
and 6-2, 6-3.
Rounding out the lineup for
the Card was freshman Geoff
Abrams at the No. 5 spot, who
had little trouble with Aztec
Blake Pearson, defeating him 6-
1, 6-4.
Playing at the No. 6 spot was
junior Misha Palecek. Although
not usually a starter for Stan

ford, Palecek displayed the
depth of talent the Card has to
offer, as he breezed by San Diego
State's Doug Young 6-2, 6-3.
"I felt pretty good about my
playing today," Palecek said.
"Because I have not played a
match in so long, I felt a little
tight and nervous. But I went
out and made my shots."
Palecek had extra reason to be
nervous as he was playing an
Aztec team under the instruction
of his former coach, John Nelson.
"He knows my game, so he
could tell [Young] how to play
against me," Palecek said. "He
told him to give me moonballs
and off-pace stuff because he
knows I do not like that, but it
did not faze me."
Nothing seemed to faze the
Card this weekend, as it swept
San Diego State in the doubles
as well. At the No. 1 position was
the Wolters / Goldstein duo
pulling out a tight win over
Faulk and Adamson 9-8. At the
No. 2 position, the twins Bob
and Mike Bryan cruised past
Hrdina and Lay 8-3. In the finals
doubles match of the day, senior
captain Grant Elliott and
Abrams took Pearson and Young
8-5.
The Cardinal strutted its sim
ilar winning style Saturday
when it crushed the Huskies 7-0.
But Stanford also suffered its
first loss of a match this season
at the No. 3 doubles spot when
Elliott and Abrams fell to Nick
Quatrochi and Chad Kavmond
8-6.
"It seems like we had about
20 break points, but we could
never win any of them." said
Elliott, one of the squad's cap
tains.
In the other doubles matches
of the day, Goldstein and
Wolters teamed up at the top
spot to take Scott Moore and
Nick Williams 8-4. The Bryan
brothers crushed Mark Woolley
and Eric Drew 8-3.
"Our young guys are playing
extremely well," Elliott said.
"This is another big win for us
and once again proves how
tough they are."
In the singles, both All-Amer
icans Wolters and Goldstein had
little trouble at the one and two
positions. Wolters breezed past
Eric Drew 6-2, 6-2. Goldstein
crushed Nick Williams, who is
ranked 41st in the country, 6-1,
6-2.

"I feel like I am playing really
well right now," Goldstein said.
"It was a good win."
Both Bob and Mike Bryan
had little trouble in the singles
as well. Bob defeated Stefano
Rampazzo in the No. 3 position
6-4, 6-1, as Mike drubbed
Moore, 6-1, 6-0.
Rounding out the singles for
the Card were Abrams and
Elliott. While Abrams easily
defeated Sasha Rampazzo 6-1,
6-1, Elliott had a much closer
match, beating Rex Calaunus,
7-5, 6-3.
"There was a little struggle at
first today," said Elliott, who did
not play singles the day before
against San Diego State. "But I
finished hitting well."
Stanford will get a chance to
face other top ranked teams
when the Cardinal heads to the
National Team Indoors in
Louisville, Ky., beginning tomor
row.
