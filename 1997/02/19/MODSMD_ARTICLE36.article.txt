# Softball opens campus facility with heartbreaking losses
## 
### Ryan Chavez 
The close losses suffered by the
softball team this weekend
showed that Stanford is capable of
beating the best in the country.
Yet to do so they will need to make
fewer mistakes and take advan
tage of important scoring oppor
tunities. All four games could
have gone either way but ended
with two losses to Pacific on Sat
urday, 4-0, 3-0, and a pair of gut
wrenching defeats against second
ranked UCLA on Sunday, 1-0, 4-3
in the debut of the Stanford Soft
ball Complex.
In game one against UOP on
Saturday, the Cardinal mixed too
many walks and errors with not
enough hits. The game was tied
0-0 after five innings, with the
pitchers for both teams having a
solid game on the mound. Pacific
scored two runs in both the sixth
and seventh innings off sopho
more pitcher Becky Blevins, with
only two of them earned. That
was all Pacific needed as the
Tigers limited the Cardinal to
three hits and no runs.
In game two, the team was
again shut down at the plate, lim
ited to just five hits. The offense
was sporadic, unable to be put
anything together back-to-back or
in the same inning, with the end
result being another shutout. The
difference in this game, though,
was not the better hitting of Pacif

ic, which recorded the same num
ber of hits as Stanford, but rather
that UOP's hits were well timed.
"Pacific and UCLA really know
how to get hits at the right time,"
said senior third baseman Aman
da Renteria. "They take advan
tage of opportunities that we also
had this weekend but didn't capi
talize on."
As in game one, Cardinal
errors and walks led to unearned
runs for Pacific.
On Sunday, the doubleheader
against the Bruins further
emphasized the team's need to
limit its mistakes and convert
more of its baserunners into runs
scored to win close games against
top-ranked opponents.
In game one, both teams
shined defensively. The Cardinal
recorded three hits and the Bru
ins four, but UCLA was able to
combine a walk, sacrifice bunt
and single to score a run. That
would be enough to win, as
UCLA's pitcher Burns was able to
hold the Cardinal scoreless for its
third straight game.
In game two, the Cardinal
showed signs of life offensively.
Down one after four innings, the
team had a two-out, three-run
rally that was ignited by junior left
fielder Dawn Kobata's base hit.

Jennie Foyle, freshman catcher
Kellie Wiginton hit a clutch dou
ble to bring in three runs. At the
end of five innings the Cardinal
led 3-1.
The terrific pitching perfor
mance of Blevins this weekend
should not be overlooked. Blevins
started three of the four games
and had a 1.79 ERA for the week
end.
"Becky was pitching great, and
when something is working, you
go with it as long as it continues
to work," Renteria said. "Becky
pitched so well against UCLA in
game one that it was probably

why she started against them in
game two."
At the same time, it may have
been the exhaustive use of
Blevins that contributed to the
second loss against the Bruins on
Sunday. Holding the Bruins to
one run after five innings, and
two runs over the last 12 innings,
Blevins was unable to stop UCLA
from scoring three runs in the
sixth. Unable to end the inning,
she was relieved by sophomore
Marcy Crouch, who closed the
game.
"It is not so unusual in softball
to have a pitcher start two games
in a row," said injured junior
pitcher Jessica Schulman, who is
expected to be able to pitch some
time this weekend. "But it is a lit
tle unusual to have a pitcher do so

this early in the season. Having
only two pitchers in the rotation
this weekend sort of put a little
added pressure on us."
Sophomore shortstop Michelle
Schneider led off the bottom of
the sixth with a double for Stan
ford in an attempt to get a rally
going. Yet UCLA was able to get
out the next three batters and
strand Schneider at second.
"I really can't wait to play
UCLA again," Renteria said. "We
know we can beat them, and we'll
go into the next game against
them with a lot of confidence."
Softball next plays in the San
Diego State Classic beginning
tomorrow, and Stanford will need
to come ready to play, as they face
several tough opponents in the
tournament.
