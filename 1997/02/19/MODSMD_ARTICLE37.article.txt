After a physically, mentally
and emotionally trying series
over the weekend, the No. 4
Stanford baseball team suffered
no letdown in yesterday's 12-4
rout of the UC-Davis Aggies.
With its fourth game in as
many days, in addition to a long
bus trip to the game, the Cardi
nal (10-4) risked being caught
off guard by the Division II
Aggies (6-2), who were coming
off a six-game win streak.
"We didn't want to play down

after being tired," said sopho
more infielder Josh Hochgesang,
who blasted two home runs
while picking up four RBIs for
Stanford.
The Cardinal offense com
bined for 19 hits and 12 runs,
while the Stanford pitching staff
allowed only four runs on 10
hits. Sophomore left-handed
pitcher Brent Hoard (2-1) picked
up his second win of the season.
Hoard recorded seven strikeouts
and allowed only two runs on six
hits over six innings.
Davis scored both its runs off
Hoard in the first inning. After

retiring the first two batters,
Hoard allowed three hits in a
row before settling down.
"I got mad and it kicked me
into gear," Hoard said. After the
two runs, "I started throwing. I
had a good fastball today."
Junior lefty Josh Koons fol
lowed Hoard with two scoreless
innings of middle relief and
sophomore Cameron Newton
made his debut and closed out
the last inning of the game.
Mike Norris (0-1) lasted only
three innings, suffering the
defeat for the Aggies. Davis used
four pitchers in an attempt to

shut down the Card, but Stan
ford's offense proved unstop
pable.
In the balanced offensive
attack, freshmen Edmund Muth
and John Gall had three hits
apiece. Designated hitter Gall
drove in three runs and junior
second baseman Joe Kilburg
crossed the plate three times.
Sophomores Jody Gerut and
John Salter and freshman third
baseman Jeff Rizzo each added
two hits as well. Center fielder
