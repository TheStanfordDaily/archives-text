# Chico State, Claremont succumb to rugbys
## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Men's rugby found the perfect
time to get its game down just
right.
The Cardinal was finally able
to successfully increase the tempo
of its game in order to dominate
Chico State 46-12 in Saturday's
league opener.
This afternoon the men will
continue to develop their speed
when they face the University of
British Columbia on Maloney
Field at 4:15 p.m.
After a preseason character
ized by rough physical play due to
their large size, the men have
spent the last couple of weeks

changing their style of play in
order to accommodate for the loss
of senior Jason White, one of their
biggest players, to the World
League of American Football. The
transition into a faster-paced, ball
control-oriented game helped the
Cardinal keep the Wildcats on
their heels throughout most of
the match.
"They played with a lot of vari
ation in their game and also they
implemented their game plan
very well," said head coach
Franck Boivert.
The team will also use today's
match in order to work out some
of the technical skills on defense
that have been giving Stanford
problems. The Cardinal will have

to hit lower along an opponent's
body if they want to tackle more
effectively.
The "game against ÃœBC will be
the perfect match for us to work
on our defense, especially our
body positioning, which is too
high," Boivert said. "We've got to
get lower on the body positioning
and get much more aggressive in
body contact situations."
Also on Saturday, the women
traveled to Southern California to
take on Claremont College and
delivered a 47-0 blowout.
The women have been com
pensating for their lack of size by
attacking opponents all season
long on both sides of the ball.
"Defensively, we were consis-

tently aggressive," said junior
fullback Susie Hoffman, who also
scored a try. "We always kept
them on their heels offensively,
and we were able to break
through the lines.
"We were able to keep the
momentum going throughout
[the match] and keep them on
their heels and moving back
wards," Hoffman said.
Their speed has enabled them
to attack the ball more aggressive
ly and keep opponents from tak
ing too many chances on offense.
Offensively, the team will still
have to work on positioning and
ball control in order to make a
legitimate run when Stanford
faces more upper-echelon teams.
