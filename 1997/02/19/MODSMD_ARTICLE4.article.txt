# Voting delayed on Zapata issue
## Community members instead decide to form advisory committee 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Last night's community meet
ing, originally intended to decide
whether to ask the University ad
ministration to rename Casa Zapa
ta, ended instead with a consensus
decision to form a committee of
community members to advise on
how best to proceed.
Some of the committee's mem
bers were named on the spot and
will meet for the first time next
week. The committee will consider
the best method of honoring Cecilia
and Tony Burciaga, who were Zapa
ta's resident fellows for nine years
until 1994.
The original purpose of the meet
ing had been to obtain a yes or no
vote on whether the Chicano / Lati
no theme dorm should be renamed
Casa Burciaga. However, several
community members at the meet
ing said that they were uncomfort
able with an immediate vote.
Vanessa Alvarado, Class of '96,
said forcing an immediate vote
would be "an egregious error
against the alumni" because of the
short notice they had been given.
The issue did not lend itself to such
a quick decision, she added.
Asst. English Prof. Lora
Romero, Zapata's current RF, ex
plained that the staff s intention in
scheduling the vote was not to im
mediately reach a decision without
consulting alumni.
"We start with what's easiest (a
vote of current residents and com
munity members), and then we try
to contact the alumni. That was the
plan all along," Romero said.
In addition to the idea that the
issue was being decided too fast,
some of the crowd of more than 50
objected to the proposed voting sys
tem itself. They were displeased
that it would give the collective vote
of the house's current residents

twice as much weight as that of the
nonresidents.
There was also some question as
to whether renaming the house was
the best way to honor the Burciagas
and the history of Stanford's Chi
cano / Latino community.
Sophomore Francisco Najera
suggested that "instead of [renam
ing] one of the few things we have,
to build something new, that would
be, for me, something much more
meaningful," because of the com
munity-building effect such a pro
ject would have.
He said that the idea of a Mayan
art garden had been considered in
the past and might be a fitting
memorial to the Burciagas. Other
suggestions included naming a
classroom building in their honor or
endowing a scholarship.
Some of those present also sug
gested that the current name of the
dorm should be kept as a memorial
to the work of the community that
established the house in 1972.
Proponents of the name change
stressed that they had consulted Ce
cilia Burciaga about renaming the
building in honor of her and her
husband, who died of cancer in Oc
tober.
Senior Linda Prieto, a Zapata
resident assistant, said Burciaga
"was very supportive of the idea and
said she was honored and that Tony
would have been honored."
Prieto added that the staff had
not been sure of a positive response
when they approached Burciaga,
considering the circumstances
under which she and her husband
left Stanford.
In 1994, Cecilia Burciaga, who
was then an associate dean for stu
dent affairs and Stanford's highest
ranking Chicana administrator,
was laid off; the administration at
the time cited budget cuts.
