# Water polo third in San Diego
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team (4-1) showed the field
that it came to play last weekend
at the UC-San Diego Tourna
ment by finishing third overall
and narrowly missing a spot in
the championship match.
That spot slipped away in a
heartbreaking 7-6 loss to a
stacked UCLA squad Sunday
morning. The Cardinal fell
behind early in the game, trail
ing 4-1 in the first quarter. But
the second quarter was all Stan
ford as the Cardinal scored five
goals to the Bruins' one to give
Stanford a 6-5 lead heading into
the third quarter.
UCLA gained the lead by scor
ing twice more, but the Cardinal
was not out yet. With 30 seconds
left Stanford was able to find net
to bring the score to 7-6. But
that was the last time that Stan
ford would beat UCLA's Nicole
Pain, the keeper for the U.S.

National Team, and the Bruins
prevailed 7-6.
"We are definitely as good, if
not better (than UCLA), we just
have to come out a little better in
the first half," said sophomore
Nicole Glazer.
The squad won its three first
round games to earn a spot in
the semifinals against UCLA,
who recovered from a first
round loss to second-seeded Cal
ifornia to make it through to the
semifinals.
After winning its first game of
the preliminary round against
UC-Davis on Friday night 7-4,
Stanford moved on to trounce
the host Tritons 16-1 Saturday
morning.
Going into the tournament,
the Cardinal anticipated that its
first-round game against San
Diego State would be one of its
toughest matches. But someone
forgot to tell that to freshman
Ellen Estes, who scored a phe
nomenal six goals in the second
half to push the Cardinal past

the Aztecs in an 11-5 rout.
Because of the loss to UCLA
in the semifinals, the Cardinal
moved on to the consolation
final and again faced San Diego
State, which had lost in the
other semifinal to California.
The Stanford squad beat the
Aztecs for the second time in
two days 14-8, despite falling
behind 3-1 early in the first
half.
In the tournament champi
onship, the rankings held true as
the Bruins, seeking revenge for
their first-round upset, beat the
Golden Bears. The three top
teams before the tournament,
Stanford, Cal and UCLA, all left
San Diego with 4-1 records.
"I think that the (UCLA)
game showed that this is one of
the primer programs in the
country," said head coach Ben
Quittner. "All the top three pro
grams are about even. We have
more freshmen, and by the end
of the season I can see us being
No. 1."
