# Irving emphasizes need for imagination

### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
According to novelist John Irving, imagina
tion is crucial in the work of any good writer.
"The worst advice (Ernest) Hemingway has
given to American literature is, 'Write about
your own experiences,' " Irving said during his
reading last night in Kresge Auditorium. "If
you can't make something up, do something
else."
In his reading — which was, like Irving's
novels, marked by both humor and length —
Irving discussed the genesis of his current

novel-in-progress, read two excerpts from the
novel and answered questions.
The author of one memoir and eight novels,
including "The World According to Garp" and
"A Prayer for Owen Meany," Irving told an en
thusiastic audience of more than 350 that his
still unfinished novel is "only about 679 pages
long. It's called 'A Widow for One Year,' and on
page 679, the main character is not yet mar
ried."
Unusual circumstances precipitated his lat
est work, Irving said.
In 1994, he was invited to submit a story to
the Sunday magazine of a Munich, Germany,

newspaper. The newspaper prints an annua
fiction issue, Irving said, and all of the fictioi
which appears abides by two rules.
First, explained Irving, "You must call youi
story 'The Red and Blue Air Mattress.' That is
the title of the story. I'm not kidding. Every
story in every issue is called 'The Red and Blue
Air Mattress.' "
The second rule is that "an actual red and
blue air mattress must appear in the story, and
the significance must be such as to warrant it
as a title," Irvine said. With such intriguing
prerequisites, "who could he
refuse?" Irving asked.
On a more serious note, Irving
said, "The invitation to submit
was a way to get me going."
Already, Irving had 200 pages
of notes for the novel and had de
cided it would focus on "a woman
who would be a widow one day and
a woman who was a writer."
In the section Irving read,

which was what had been pub
lished in the Munich newspaper,
the protagonist is Ruth Cole, a
"writer of intricately plotted nov
els ... . Autobiography didn't in
terest her, especially her own."
To the delight of the audience,
Irving depicted Ruth's interaction
with her nemesis in Southamp
ton, N.Y., a righteous, hypocritical
woman named Hannah Grant.
Hannah, whose daughter is in the
same class as Ruth's son, trauma
tizes local children by showing a
video of her daughter's birth at a
birthday party, becomes an anti

pornography crusader and is ulti
mately mortified when her daugh
ter takes Hannah's vibrator into
school for show and tell.
Irving did indeed manage to
work a red and blue air mattress
into the plot by having the section
end with Ruth and Hannah at a
beach picnic. Hannah helps a young
boy deflate his air mattress, and the
buzzing sound the mattress makes
while deflating is the same sound
Hannah's vibrator made years be
fore when her daughter took it to
school. Once again, Hannah is pub
licly humiliated.

When his mother read the
piece, Irving said, her reaction
was, "Christ! Another dildo."
"I'm sensitive to her criticism,
as I have been all my life," Irving
said.
The second excerpt Irving read
was a chapter titled "The Inade
quate Lampshade."
"It sounds like one of those in
terior decorating stores you don't
want to go in or a justly neglected
book of poems," Irving joked.
Nonetheless, he argued, the chap
ter title is "not unfounded, just
unfortunate."

In the question-and-answer
session at the end of the reading,
Irving discussed the difficulty
today of having a first novel pub
lished, the doubts he has regard
ing the usefulness of creative writ
ing programs, his ambivalence
about having his books made into
movies and the problems with bor
rowing material from real life
when writing fiction.
"When you choose detail, in
vent detail, you're more responsi
ble," he said. "You have to take re
sponsibility for every detail. How
can you do that with memory?"
