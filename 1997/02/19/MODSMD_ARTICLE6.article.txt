# On the road again
## Solar car gears up for new year 
### Nathan Gillespie Contributing writer 
The compound of aging, brown huts out past the
greenhouses on Stock Farm Road looks like any
thing but a center of high-tech research. The rustic
scene is shattered only by a car, the centerpiece of
the Stanford Solar Car Project.
About 20 students spend dozens of hours a week
in this forgotten corner of campus, preparing Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley's solar car for a multistate
race in June.
The one-man vehicle looks like a stealth fighter
on wheels, eight square meters of solar cells covering
its aerodynamic body.
The car weighs only 175 pounds, is fueled solely
by the energy of the sun, has a top speed of 70 mph
and was designed and built completely by students.
It is also street legal.
"We get a lot of strange stares," said junior For
rest Deuth, describing other drivers' reactions when
they encounter the car on local roads. Deuth headed
last year's Solar Car Project and is helping this
year's group get started.
The Solar Car Project, a joint venture with stu
dents from UC-Berkeley, is preparing for Sun
rayce '97, a 10-stage, 1,230-mile race from Indi
anapolis to Colorado Springs that will take place
June 19-28.
Thejoint force will compete in a field of 40 top col
legiate solar car teams and has high hopes for anoth

er strong showing after finishing fifth in 1993 and
1995.
Last year, the Solar Car Project shipped its vehi
cle to Australia to compete in the prestigious World
Solar Challenge against a field including such cor
porate giants as Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mit
subishi, but finished a disappointing 25th after
crippling electrical problems developed early in the
race.
Aside from winning the race, the eight-year-old
Solar Car Project is dedicated to promoting alterna
tive energy and giving students an opportunity to
acquire meaningful hands-on engineering experi
ence.
"It's the most amazing learning experience," said
Deuth. "The people that come out of the Solar Car
Project don't have trouble finding jobs. They have
Stanford technology skills and hands-on experi
ence, and they have to really know how to work in
teams."
Students will spend the next several months test
ing and refining the car in preparation for Sunrayce,
working with some of the most advanced technolo
gies in alternative energy.
The car, which runs on the same amount of power
as a toaster, is currently fitted with the best solar
cells in the world, which will have to be replaced be
cause they exceed Sunrayce's efficiency regulations.
The frame is built of lightweight composites devel-

oped by the aerospace industry.
The batteries are among the
lightest and most efficient avail
able, and the car carries advanced
electronics to monitor its systems.
Such cutting-edge technolo
gies are very expensive. The Solar
Car Project, which lost its special
fee last year, spends between
$15,000 and $20,000 to attend
each race, and the car itself is
worth more than $300,000. One
of the primary tasks for project
members is getting materials do
nated — even the pizzas for last
Sunday's organizational meeting.
The goal of the Solar Car Pro
ject is not so much to make solar
cars practical because the cells

are too fragile and expensive to
feasibly put them on the outside
of millions of moving vehicles.
Instead, the project hopes to
promote the associated technolo
gies, such as composite materials
and improved batteries, that
could soon make battery-powered
electric cars into legitimate com
petitors of gasoline-powered au
tomobiles.
The solar car provides what
Deuth calls "a sexy item to show
to the public to increase aware
ness of alternative energy." He
said he hopes that kids who see
the solar car will dream of grow
ing up to drive electric cars rather
than gas-guzzling automobiles.
The Solar Car Project accepts
students of all majors who want
to "learn an incredible amount
while doing something fun," said
Deuth.
