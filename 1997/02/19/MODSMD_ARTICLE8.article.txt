# ASSU fee refunds continue to decline

Students requested about
$40,000 less special-fee money to
be refunded compared to last win
ter quarter, reflecting response to
changes in the fee process.
Students refunded $25,536.39
in special fees this quarter, up from
$18,887 fall quarter but down
from $68,379.60 in winter quarter
last year. According to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager John Hall, the
drop can be attributed to a change
in the special-fee application
process — in last April's general
election, groups were allowed the
option to request funds from only
the undergraduate or graduate
population.
"The comparison just totally
changed," he said.
Under the new system, 12 of the
22 groups that students voted to
give special fees last year requested
money from undergraduates only.
Because graduate students have
traditionally refunded the fees
much more than undergraduates,
Hall said, those 12 groups experi
enced a very low refund rate.
The five groups with the lowest
refund rate — Stanford Volunteer
Network, the Asian American Stu
dent Association, Alternative
Spring Break, Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford and
the Axe Committee — each had
200 students or fewer request re
funds. The most refunded group
that appealed only to undergradu
ates, the Black Student Union, saw
220 requests.

In contrast, the least refunded
group that applied for both gradu
ate and undergraduate funding,
ASSU Legal Counseling, had 598
refund requests. The ASSU Pro
gram Board had the highest total
with 1,056 requests.
A total of 1,369 students —
1,115 graduates and 254 under
graduates — requested fee re
funds. Undergraduate refunds to
taled $5,441.82, and graduate re
funds came to $20,094.57.
Each Stanford undergraduate
student was assessed a $29.09 fee
for winter quarter, up from $28.45
fall quarter. Graduate students
were charged $20.67 this quarter,
up from $19.86. All students were
assessed a $28.88 fee winter quar
ter last year.
This quarter, students refund
ed 8.29 percent of the fees paid to
the ASSU, a sharp decrease from
18.4 percent last year. Although
bolstered by the changed special
fee procedures, that number still
represents a continued downward
trend in refund amounts. Fee re
turn rates have risen to as high as
36 percent in past years.
Joining the Program Board at
the top of the refund scale were
Club Sports, the Stanford Band
and two other ASSU funding bod
ies, the Community Service Board
and the Publications Board.
Hall said the latter groups suf
fer because their work is not as vis
ible to the student body.
"I think the boards don't have
specific constituencies that under
stand them," he said. "That hurts
them."
