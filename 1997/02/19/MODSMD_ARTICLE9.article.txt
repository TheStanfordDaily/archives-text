# EASTFest kicks off
## Speaker series to focus on sexuality in Asia 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
The title of this year's East-
Fest theme, "Sex and Sexuality
in Asia," may entice students'
off-color curiosity, but the se
ries promises to incorporate an
intellectual perspective on the
issue.
The two-week long speaker
series began yesterday and will
culminate in a performance
night on March 1. A different
speaker will discuss a sex or
gender issue in contemporary
and traditional Asia each
evening.
Events are scheduled to take
place at 7 every night at EAST
House. Topics will range from
the portrayal of women in
anime — Japanese animation
— to the relationship between
Chinese filial piety and the
Oedipus complex.
Students can explore their
own interests in a culture dif
ferent from their own, said
Asst. History Prof. Ellen
Neskar, resident fellow of the
East Asian Studies theme
house.
While theme assistant Yee-
San Su said he thinks the topic
of sex will draw crowds, he
hopes that people will gain a
broader sense of what is going
on in Asia.
"My aim is that students will
learn something about Asia in a
comfortable environment,"
Neskar said. "We hope that the

event will be educating and en
tertaining at the same time."
"The topics expand our scope
on sex," Su said. Issues include
infertility, filial piety, Japanese
Buddhism and sexuality and
"comfort women," who were
used by the Japanese as sex
slaves during World War 11.
"The variety of topics cov
ered show that there are more
dimensions in sex and sexuality
in Asia than we are aware of,"
said junior Jennie Kim, a theme
assistant. "Our understanding
of gender is very limited
through film and media."
Kim said she hopes that the
series will dispel some of the
stereotypes people have gained
from the media in thinking
about Asian gender issues ex
clusively in terms of "concu
bines, infanticide, patriarchy
and the oppression of women."
EastFest began 14 years ago
as a one-night faculty dinner
and gradually expanded to a
one-week and now two-week
speaker series. Neskar said she
believes that EastFest has con
tributed to the growing interest
in Asian culture on campus.
The final event will feature
eight groups including the
Stanford Chinese Folk Dance
group; Hwimori, a Stanford Ko
rean drummer group; and a
performer playing an electric
koto, a long Japanese stringed
instrument. Free food from
local Asian restaurants will be
provided.
