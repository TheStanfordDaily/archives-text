Jerome Friedman
Professor Friedman is an internationally known expert in experimental high
energy and elementary particle physics. He shared the Nobel Prize with
SLAC's Richard Taylor and MlT's Henry Kendall for research on inelastic
electron scattering from protons and neutrons, which provided the first
evidence of the quark substructure of the nucleon.
