## Building safety problems continue after earthquake damage 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake contin
ues to make its effects felt on the University
community. The future of the Bridge is in
creasingly uncertain after part of its home,
which was damaged in the quake, was con
demned by the University.
The service's prospects have been threat
ened since the University deemed the house un
safe after the earthquake.
Three years ago, the administration decided

to move the peer counseling service from its
home to alternative office space, possibly in
Tresidder Union.
Volunteers at the Bridge became concerned
that the move might make it impossible to con
tinue maintaining live-in counselors.
After Bridge volunteers protested, the Uni
versity instead made minor repairs to make the
building safer. The administration also
promised to let the group stay there for 5 more
years.
At the end of fall quarter, after an inspection
of the building, the University condemned the

second floor.
"We thought we took what were appropriate
actions," Dean of Students Marc Wais said
"Our primary concern is health and safety.
"We tried to support the Bridge's overall phi
losophy of on-site, live-in counselors," Wais
added.
"The University couldn't in good conscience
let people live there," senior Mary Rahn, a live
in counselor, agreed.
