# Bridge faces housing questions
## Building safety problems continue after earthquake damage 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake contin
ues to make its effects felt on the University
community. The future of the Bridge is in
creasingly uncertain after part of its home,
which was damaged in the quake, was con
demned by the University.
The service's prospects have been threat
ened since the University deemed the house un
safe after the earthquake.
Three years ago, the administration decided

to move the peer counseling service from its
home to alternative office space, possibly in
Tresidder Union.
Volunteers at the Bridge became concerned
that the move might make it impossible to con
tinue maintaining live-in counselors.
After Bridge volunteers protested, the Uni
versity instead made minor repairs to make the
building safer. The administration also
promised to let the group stay there for 5 more
years.
At the end of fall quarter, after an inspection
of the building, the University condemned the

second floor.
"We thought we took what were appropriate
actions," Dean of Students Marc Wais said
"Our primary concern is health and safety.
"We tried to support the Bridge's overall phi
losophy of on-site, live-in counselors," Wais
added.
"The University couldn't in good conscience
let people live there," senior Mary Rahn, a live
in counselor, agreed.

has forced two counselors who
lived in separate rooms on the
upper floor to relocate to the first,
where they now share a room, and
there is no longer a separate room
for counseling.
Since one live-in counselor is
responsible for answering phone
calls every night, sharing rooms
is not an ideal situation, senior
and resident counselor Joy Chen
said. "The position is sort of like a
[Resident Assistant]," she ex
plained. "You wouldn't room two

RAs together."
The main worry of Bridge vol
unteers, however, is that the coun
seling service will have no place to
go in the future if the group even
tually loses its current building en
tirely. Live-in counselor Jack Chu,
a recent graduate, said Wais
"couldn't really tell us where we
would be."
"We realize [the Bridge] has
been on campus for 25 years and is
considered a national model of stu
dent self-help," said Wais. "We've
begun discussions on identifying
their needs and concerns for plan
ning purposes," he added.
"We got support that the Bridge
is going to exist, but we don't know

in what form," Rahn said. If the
service is simply moved to office
space, it is uncertain whether live
in counselors can remain a part of
the program, she explained.
Live-in counselors are integral
to the Bridge, Rahn said. "We do
provide a 24-hour service, which is
hard to do unless people can live
here," she explained.
Furthermore, the Bridge al
ways wants an experienced coun
selor to be available, and the resi
dent counselors usually are the
most experienced, Rahn said. "We
do a lot more of the crisis counsel
ing," she explained.
"Since we live here, we're able
to have our eye on the overall pic

ture," Chen added. Having people
with this perspective helps in deal
ing with the University, she ex
plained.
While the administration has
not actually forced the volunteers
to vacate yet, the Bridge has
formed a task force to consider pos
sibilities such as creating a peer
counseling theme dorm. "We're
trying to be proactive," Chu said.
Given the apparent atmosphere
of administrative cutbacks, the
concern over future commitment
of resources to the Bridge is war
ranted, Rahn explained.
"We rather err on the side of
being the loud squeaky wheel,"
Chen added.
