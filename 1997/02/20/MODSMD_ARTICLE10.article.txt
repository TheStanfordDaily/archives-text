# China's Deng Xiaoping dead at 92

BEIJING (AP) — Deng Xiaoping, the last
of China's Communist revolutionaries who
abandoned Mao's radical policies and pushed
the world's most populous nation into the
global community with capitalist-style
reforms, died yesterday.
Xinhua, China's official news agency, said
he was 93, although the birth date in most
records would have made him 92 when he
died.
Though Deng retired from his last official
post in 1990 and had not been seen in public
for three years, he spent much of the past
decade orchestrating Chinese politics from
behind the scenes with a loosely defined title:
"paramount leader."
While he put an end to the iron rice bowl —
lifetime jobs for all — he ruled with an iron
fist. The military suppression of the 1989
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests —
believed to have taken place on his final orders
— killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, and
put a blot on the economic progress Deng had
achieved.
He died at 9:08 p.m. (5:08 a.m. PST) of res
piratory and circulatory failure brought on by
lung infections and the Parkinson's disease
that had stricken him long ago, Xinhua News
Agency announced early today.
The first test of Deng's legacy will be
whether his handpicked successor, Commu
nist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, and
the other younger technocrats he installed in
the 1990s will weather political maneuvering
that is expected to intensify in the coming
months.
A meeting of China's national legislature
next month, the return of Hong Kong to Chi
nese rule on July 1 and a party congress to
reshuffle top posts due in the fall will provide
chances for the politically ambitious.
No one is expected to supplant Jiang, who
received a boost in claiming Deng's mantle by
being named chairman of Deng's 459-member
funeral committee.
Yet the younger aspirants lack Deng's
clout, especially with the all important mili
tary and the few remaining powerful party
elders. Successors will have to continue to
manage by building consensus among influen
tial constituencies.
The announcement of Deng's death came
about 3 a.m., when most of Beijing was sleep
ing. It took about six hours before it was
broadcast on state-run television or radio, rel
atively quickly for China: When Mao died in
1976, the announcement took two days.

China's Central Committee proclaimed
"with profound grief to the whole party, the
whole army and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country that our beloved Com

rade Deng .. . passed away," Xinhua said.
There were no signs that leaders dispatched
large numbers of troops or police posted
around the citv.
