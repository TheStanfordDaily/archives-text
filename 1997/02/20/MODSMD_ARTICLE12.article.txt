## Editorial Keeping a deadline 
### 
University committees
must give timely reports
to maintain credibility

THE UNIVERSITY sets
countless deadlines that
Stanford students are obli
gated to meet. Students who don't
meet those deadlines — be they to
register for classes, pay phone bills,
take final examinations — are held
accountable, often financially.
University administrators also
set deadlines for themselves, but if
and when they don't meet those
deadlines, nothing happens.
At her State of Student Affairs
address in October 1995, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced that her pri
mary goal for the year was to form a
committee to review the Universi
ty's alcohol policy. Also on her list of
goals, she said, was to create a task
force to evaluate the Greek system.
After Edmonds made her initial
announcement — more than a year
ago — it took months before she
actually formed either of the task
forces. It took several more months
before either of those task forces
began meeting.
Now, 16 months later, the com
mittees still have produced no tan
gible results. Edmonds set dead
lines for each task force several
times and said at the beginning of
the year that both task forces would
issue reports by the end of last quar
ter. Most recently, the Greek Affairs
report was to be released today.
Neither task force has finished
its report.
Then there's the committee eval
uating Housing and Dining Ser
vices. Provost Condoleezza Rice cre
ated that group a year ago, and at
the beginning of this school year the
committee's chair, Budget Director
Tim Warner, said he hoped to have
the report finished by the end of fall
quarter. Now, seven weeks into win
ter quarter, still nothing.

Biology Prof. Robert Simoni,
chair of the Greek Affairs Task
Force, now says the report should
be ready in two weeks — a third of
it is apparently still incomplete.
As for the Alcohol Task Force's
report, there is no end in sight.
A peculiar problem that has
plagued the Alcohol Task Force has
also proved a challenge for other
committees in the past. When the
Alcohol Task Force began meeting
again in the fall, six of eight student
members were gone — due to grad
uation and loss of interest.
Often, if an issue is of concern to
a particular group of students, a
committee is set up to deal with the
problem. However, in a setting
where most students only stay on
campus for four years, committees
that drag their collective feet for
months on end frequently lose stu
dent members to graduation.
Administrators are then left
with the task of replacing the stu
dents, and more important, they
are left with committees lacking
the students who cared most about
a given issue.
It is crucial that administrators,
who are ultimately responsible for
overseeing each committee and task
force, ensure committee members
complete their work on time and
establish a system for keeping a
constant student presence on these
committees.
Although administrators do not
punish themselves for missing
deadlines, they should be held
accountable. And although admin
istrators cannot be fined, their
penalty could ultimately be harsher
than a late fee.
If University committees expect
students to seriously consider their
reports, then the committees must
seriously consider their own work.
Tardy task forces lose more than
time; they lose credibility. And with
out students' respect and attention,
the next task force to be charged
with an important University issue
could deliver its report to students
who, like the committees them
selves, just don't have the time.
