c TTIIFTY FREE HOURS of America
W Online." Sounds like something
-L the drug dealer on the corner
might offer you on the way to school. Actu
ally, pimp would be the more appropriate
occupation. In this case, my pimp is a
national Internet provider, and he's got a
whole brothel of chat rooms full of patrons
looking for cybersex. Free cybersex. I was
wary at first but as my dad used to say
about foreign food, "Just try it. If you don't
like it you can spit it out."
I decided to take advantage of the offer,
and — so help me — I was going to squeeze
every minute out of America Online.
Now I'm not so sure I want to. After an
hour, I had been asked how horny I was
eight times, if I was "well-endowed" six
times, how long I could last seven times
and was threatened once by a guy named
MachoMan243 who claimed I was trying to
move in on his girl. "What girl?" I asked.
"UserB4s3" he said.
"Oh, that girl. I thought she was
UserB4s2, simple mistake."
At this point a guy named Superßay
entered and declared "Horny Guy!"
Superßay, meet MachoMan243. Let the
battle begin.
The whole concept of cybersex was
entirely new to me. Naturally I was taken
aback by it. However, the idea of meeting a
woman online and having cybersex with
out so much as exchanging our names
intrigued me. I swallowed my hesitation

and decided to explore this new world of
the modem-using over-amorous.
I changed chat rooms and lingered in
the background of "Tonight's the Night,"
one of the more candid places to find a
cyber-mate. After some time, I observed
the following A lot of men look like Mel
Gibson or Lorenzo Llamas, a lot of men are
under the age of 30; and, well, there are a
lot of men, period. The male-to-female
ratio reads like the odds for a horse with
three legs.
The dialogue isn't very appealing
either. A sample conversation:
Gingero932: Hi.
LovrBoyl8: Hi. You horny?
Gingero932: Um, what do you look like ?
LovrBoyl8: I'm 5'10", wavy brown
hair, sky blue eyes, 160 lbs.
Gingero932: You sound like Mel Gibson.
LovrBoyl8: Yeah, so are you horny?
Gingero932: No.
LovrBoyl8:1 am.
Gingero932: That's nice.
LovrBoyl8: I've got a big —.
It soon became clear to me that (1)
there are a lot of people out there who
can't get no satisfaction; or (2) I'm
extremely undersexed. Both are at least
partly true. The people who log onto Amer
ica Online, as well as a host of other chat
rooms and networks available today,
aren't necessarily all randy little toads
looking for some easy action. But I believe
it is the easiness and casual nature of

cybersex that inevitably makes it an activ
ity that every person might try at one time
or another. In other words, it ain't going
away. For every person who's actually hav
ing sex, there's somebody out there who's
typing with one hand.
Cybersex isn't the only way to, how
shall I put it, satisfy your interests. Surf
cybernetic waters and you'll find sites
advertising phone sex, pornography rang
ing from the sadistic to the absurd, live
video connections to strippers, and much,
much more. Welcome to the Internet:
Warehouse for the Sexually Starved. Find
ing something that suits your fancy is eas
ier than getting a beer at a frat party. And,
odds are, a lot more satisfying.
Which brings me to an interesting con
clusion: Perhaps the sexual revolution of
the '60s has its parallel in the cyber-sexual
revolution of the '90s. In a time of AIDS
and HIV, perhaps the Internet is our next
best thing to the real thing. Casual sex
might not be an option anymore, but
cybersex is — as unromantic as that might
seem to some. But watch out, after the 50
hours runs out, you gotta pay the dealer
for the next hit.
