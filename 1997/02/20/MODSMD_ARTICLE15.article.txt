'Practice-oriented 9 law profs deserve offers of tenure

WE WRITE TO address the
future of Stanford Law School
Professors William Rubenstein
and Pamela Karlan. The law school fac
ulty will be deciding, in as little as two
weeks, whether to grant permanent
positions to these two scholars. Both
have impressive backgrounds.
Rubenstein spent eight years at the
ACLU litigating groundbreaking cases in
the area of discrimination based on sex
ual orientation and HIV status before
entering academia. He has served as a
visiting professor at Harvard and Yale
universities and has written an innova
tive casebook on sexual orientation and
the law. An upcoming article in the Yale
Law Journal adds to his scholarship.
Karlan, already tenured at the Uni
versity of Virginia, has argued and won

two voting-rights cases before the U.S.
Supreme Court. She has also authored
amicus briefs in several cases, among
them Romer vs. Evans (Colorado
Amendment II) and Planned Parent
hood vs. Casey. Karlan has published
scholarly articles in the subjects of vot
ing rights and the role of professional
ethics in criminal defense work.
Both are among the most popular
professors at the law school, receiving
rave reviews and tremendous support
from students who have been fortunate
enough to take their classes. Unfortu
nately, this support goes largely unheed
ed in the appointments process. Unlike
students in other departments at Stan
ford, or in other law schools such as UC-
Berkeley and Northwestern University,
law school students have no formal voice

in the appointments process.
In recent years, the law school admin
istration has been Janus-like regarding
public interest law; one face hawking the
quality and importance of public interest
education at the Law School, the other
denying tenure to eminently qualified
and widely respected public interest
scholars and practitioners. The most
recent unfortunate loss was that of Prof.
Bill Hing, widely considered to be at the
top of the field in immigration law, at
this time last year.
Yet despite their academic qualifica
tions, professors who focus on public
interest law are often categorized as
"non-academic" and too "practice-ori
ented." It is both the students and the
law school as a whole who loses out as
professors who are excellent teachers,

practitioners and theoreticians move
on to other law schools around the
country.
We encourage the law school faculty
and Dean Paul Brest to embrace this
exceptional opportunity to strengthen
the public interest faculty and curricu
lum at the law school. An offer of tenure
should be extended to Karlan and a
tenure-track position should be offered
to Rubenstein.
