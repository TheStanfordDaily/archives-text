# Former Med School dean helped foster authoritarian culture
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Dr.
David Korn's Feb. 4 letter concerning
the Pfefferbaum controversy, which ini
tially arose at the very end of Korn's
scandal-plagued tenure as dean of the
School of Medicine. Korn's poor judg
ment helped shape the present crisis,
and readers should not be taken in by
his self-serving protestations.
Korn would like readers to think that
those faculty members who complained
to him about the performance of Associ
ate Dean Richard Mazze, a Korn
appointee, were simply resisting
changes forced on the VA Hospital by
the new realities of medical care financ
ing.
Korn claims to have paid close atten
tion to the complaints against Mazze.

However, sworn testimony by Korn
shows that he made no substantive
efforts to find the truth. He listened to
the charges and decided not to investi
gate. Apparently, the economic benefits
Korn hoped to obtain for Stanford from
the VA administration were more
important to Korn than whether Mazze
was competent in performing his
decanal duties. In a recently subpoenaed
March 23, 1995, letter to then-Dean
Korn, Alan F. Schatzberg, chairman of
the psychiatry department, reminded
Korn that, in spite of his claims to the
contrary, Korn had not "fully reviewed"
the issues raised about Mazze, and he
characterized Korn's failure to fully
investigate matters as "fraught with
potential danger."
Schatzberg's rebuke to Korn turned
out to be prophetic. Korn portrays
Mazze's subsequent actions against the
three faculty who had complained
about him as purely a VA matter, but
Korn overlooks the fact that the
charges laid against Mazze concerned
his performance as associate dean and

were voiced in the Stanford dean's
office. The depositions given to date,
together with Korn's correspondence,
leave no doubt that Korn abetted
Mazze's retaliation.
One of the grievances later filed with
Provost Condoleezza Rice was against
Korn himself. University President Ger
hard Casper and the provost refused to
accept this grievance or to investigate it.
In the Kafkaesque world of Stanford
officials, even the behavior of the Medi
cal School's dean may not be a Stanford
concern.
Finally, Korn's charge that the facul
ty who came to him were attempting to
"undermine the authority of the (VA)
Medical Center director and the chief of
staff' is ludicrous but speaks to the
authoritarian culture Korn helped fos
ter in the medical school. Honest criti
cism is interpreted as subversion, the
issues are never discussed and the crit
ics are punished and hounded. If Stan
ford administrators had been half as
concerned about faculty rights as they
were about their "authority," the cur-

rent dispute would never have arisen.
Korn decries the lawsuit I and Pfeffer
baum filed against the University. How
ever, the law is the only refuge when
authority is abused. Readers of The
Daily will know that on Jan. 28, the
Superior Court found in Pfefferbaum's
favor: Stanford administrators violated
procedures in dismissing Pfefferbaum
from his tenured position.
In a subpoenaed School of Medicine
memo, Prof. Norman Shumway, the dis
tinguished surgeon, noted that he had
recently "learned quite a bit about VA
and Stanford administrative politics . . .
and it is not very pretty." According to
Shumway, "We need a change of heart
... to make this the first-class institu
tion everyone thinks it is." Now that the
court has ruled for Pfefferbaum, the
story of events of the last several years
may soon be revealed in public. Height
ened scrutiny can help achieve change
at Stanford, just as it has in the past.
