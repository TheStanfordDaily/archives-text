"Mr. Blutarsky . . . ZERO point ZERO
ZERO. ..."
— Dean Vernon Wormer, Faber College
"Animal House" (1980)
IF YOU'VE SEEN one of my all-time
favorite movies, you may remember
this famous line spoken to John
Belushi's character, Bluto Blutarsky.
The eager dean was referring to Bluto's
grade point average and was using this
new revelation to expel him and his fel
low Delta House dirt-balls from college.
Bluto Blutarsky was about as unath
letic as they come, but if he attended col
lege in the 19905, he'd fit right in at
Texas Tech, where he could also probably
play tailback. Absurd? Consider this:
ESPN reported Monday that Texas
Tech's Ail-American junior tailback
Byron Hanspard earned a 0.00 GPA fall
semester. This means he flunked every
single one of his classes. I can't imagine
how hard that would be.
At Stanford, the student athletes I
know work harder than most non-ath
letes. They graduate — often in higher
numbers than the general student popu
lation — and, as far as I'm concerned,
they deserve every cent of the scholar
ship money they receive.
But Byron Hanspard and so many like

him are not student athletes because at
their core, they simply are not students.
In all fairness, Hanspard may have
good reasons for his dismal academic
performance, although I can't think of
any. Bluto worked long and hard to
achieve his perfect zero GPA, and even
the least bit of effort might result in a D
in one class. . ..
Hanspard made no effort to maintain
even the illusion that he's a student.
What's worse, his coach doesn't see a
problem with this.
When asked about Hanspard's GPA,
Texas Tech head coach "Spike" Dykes
seemed unconcerned. "I think what con
cerns me is if you're eligible to partici
pate, you're eligible. If you're not eligible,
you're not. To me, that's as far as it
goes." You tell 'em, coach!
Technically, Dykes is right. Under
current NCAA rules, "student" athletes
may be eligible to play even if they flunk
all of their classes. Meanwhile, until this
year it was illegal for student athletes to
have a job during the school year.
And you still think winning isn't
everything?
I don't know Hanspard, although I
can tell you he's a damn good tailback.
As a junior, he rushed for 2,084 yards
and won the Doak Walker Award, given

to the nation's top collegiate running
back. He led the Red Raiders to the
Alamo Bowl this year, where they were
crushed by lowa 27-0. Incidentally, I can
think of only one other bowl game this
year that was more lopsided. Poetic jus
tice perhaps?
Dykes and his staff knew about
Hanspard's GPA two days before the
Alamo Bowl, and they played him any
way. Predictably, the day after the lowa
drubbing, Hanspard quit school and
declared himself eligible for the NFL
draft, and he will live wealthily ever
after. Think he'll go back and get his
degree?
I can't fault Hanspard for turning pro.
He clearly has tremendous talent, and
there's a huge market for his services.
Even Stanford athletes leave school early
for the big bucks, as any Tiger will tell
you. But I'm still angry.
I'm angry because Stanford athletes
are expected to compete against "stu
dents" like Hanspard. I'm angry
because an increasing number of
experts believe that the best way to
solve this problems is to pay "students"
like Hanspard a salary while in college
(as if an opportunity to earn a free diplo
ma isn't enough). I'm angry because I
bet on Texas Tech.

But most of all, I'm angry because
when push comes to shove, Byron
Hanspard took someone else's spot in col
lege. When the coaches signed him, they
stopped recruiting someone else — some
one who might not have been a Heisman
trophy candidate, but who instead might
have gotten an education. After all, isn't
that why we're here?
Obviously, the problem isn't limited to
Texas Tech. Tom Osbourne, coach of
Nebraska's football team, decided to
start a "gentleman" who had recently
battered his girlfriend.
You may have heard the joke about
the Miami Hurricanes, where team pho
tos are from both the front and the pro
file. Closer to home, USC, UCLA, Uni
versity of Washington and Arizona State
are conference rivals who have all served
probations since 1980.
And how can I not take a shot at UC-
Berkeley's men's basketball program,
which has enrolled scholars like Shariff
Abdur- Rahim, who learned so much in
college he decided to go pro after his
freshman year, Tremain Fowlkes, who
amassed enough money while still in
school to purchase two sport-utility vehi
cles, and Jason Kidd, who finally became
eligible after taking the SAT five times.
None stayed in Berkeley beyond their

sophomore year.
Meanwhile Brevin Knight might quit
school early because he might graduate
early.
So where does this leave us? The term
"student athlete" seems to have become
an oxymoron in many places other than
Stanford. I firmly believe we get the best
combination of scholars and athletes in
the nation, but we sure haven't cornered
the market on intelligent people who like
to play sports.
I asked a friend on the football team
why Stanford runs such a successful pro
gram. His reply made more sense than
anything Spike Dykes has said on the
matter.
"When we get here, the athletics
department and coaches make it very
clear what is expected of us in the class
room. People live up to their expecta
tions." If schools like Texas Tech want
true student athletes, then they should
start recruitine students.

Jim Finsten, a senior majoring in public
policy, may never have met Byron
Hanspard, but he thinks he saw Bluto Blu
tarsky at the Taxi house the other night.
