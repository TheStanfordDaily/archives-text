## Folkl returns, Starbird chases record against Cougs

Records, returns and routs.
That's what is potentially in
store tonight for the third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball
team (25-1, 13-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) as it begins its final regu
lar-season homestand with a 7:30
game against Washington State
(8-13, 2-10) at Maples Pavilion. A
week ago, this game was little
more than a meaningless blip on
the schedule. The Cardinal would
continue to get its players healthy,
win at home and get ready for
Senior Night on Saturday.
What a difference a week
makes.
Suddenly, senior forward Kate
Starbird is only 31 points away
from passing Stanford great Val
Whiting at the top of the school's
all-time scoring list. Volleyball
star Kristin Folkl will also make
her debut as a redshirt sophomore
tonight after announcing her
return late last week, providing
some solid post help to a depleted
Cardinal frontline. And Washing
ton State? They are only suiting

up nine players for this game, and
it could be ugly.
"We had a lot happening,
huh?" said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Last week was
kind of a gut check with our team.
This week, we kind of have the
same challenge except that we are
at home and our crowd is so sup
portive that it gives our team a lit
tle extra confidence."
The two teams last met Jan. 25
in Pullman in an 84-75 Stanford
win, as Starbird scored 31 points
and senior guard Jamila Wideman
dished out seven assists.
Junior forwards Vanessa
Nygaard and Naomi Muli
tauaopele sat out that game while
Wideman was recovering from
her ankle injury suffered at
UCLA on Jan. 10. Both Nygaard
and Wideman are now fully
healthy, and VanDerveer has
unveiled her ace in the hole with
Folkl.
At this point, Foikl speiis junior
forward Heather Owen off the
bench while Owen recovers from a
broken finger. Folkl has had three
full days of practice to get
acquainted with the team, and

VanDerveer likes what she sees.
"She's more serious, and I like
that," VanDerveer said. "I see her
being more competitive, stepping
in and mixing it up. It feels really
good. There's nobody else in this
country that could have this prob
lem and deal with it in this way.
Kristin can play at the highest
level in basketball. She's just
jumped in and done everything
we've needed her to do."
Mulitauaopele continues to
recover from knee surgery. She
practiced this week but experi
enced soreness. VanDerveer said
there is really no need to push her
back this soon, and the junior for
ward will likely sit out this week
end. Junior center Olympia Scott
missed two days of practice while
getting some dental work done.
She returned last night and will be
starting tonight.
The chances to see Starbird at
Maples are running out fast. With
the record well within sight, she
will certainly give the home fans
an exciting regular-season send
off. Her point production has been
relentless and remarkable. For
the season, she is averaging 22.5

points per game, but she has
raised this a notch in conference
play, averaging 27.6 points
against Pac-10 foes. Her three
pointer late in the game against
Oregon last Saturday only solidi
fied her status as not only a great
scorer but also a clutch performer.
"I think [the record] is pretty
meaningful because of the per
centage that she shoots," Van-
Derveer said. "It's not about
someone just firing away. She's
not always our first option. Our
first option is a lot of going inside
and working for a high-percentage
shot."
Washington State is hurting to
say the least. The Cougars have
struggled in conference play,
mulling around near the bottom
in almost every major statistical
category, including rebounds and
turnover margin. Of course, this
was when they were relatively
healthy. Now, they are missing
senior forward Kristin Erickson
and sophomore guard Jen Kerns,
two of their top players off the
bench. Starting sophomore for
