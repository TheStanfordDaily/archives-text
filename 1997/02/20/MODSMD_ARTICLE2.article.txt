# Environment policy key to IIS program
## 
### Scott Peterson 
An interdisciplinary honors pro
gram in environmental science,
technology and policy is giving 11
students a unique opportunity to
learn from faculty at the Institute
for International Studies.
"The program is intended for stu
dents who have developed a strong
interdisciplinary interest in envi
ronment and public policy," said Bi
ology Prof. Donald Kennedy, one of

four members of the committee that directs the pro
gram.
According to Kennedy, the program emphasizes
the implications of students' research for conserva
tion policies. Students work in small group seminars
to analyze environmental problems. At the end, they
write individual honors theses that aim to suggest
practical solutions to environmental concerns.
"We try to encourage the students to make their
projects as relevant to public policy as they can,"
Kennedy said.
Both students and professors value the close rela
tionship pro-am participants have with their advi
sors and institute faculty.
"As a faculty participant it's been one of the most
rewarding teaching engagements I've had around
here," Kennedy said. "There's a lot of mutual sup
port and friendly criticism."
According to senior Jeff Deason, an earth systems
major in the program, "The actual interaction with
the students and the professors has been the most
rewarding part."
Deason is conducting his research on an experi
mental attempt by the Mojave Water Agency to boost
ground water levels in the Mojave Desert watershed.
"I am investigating how successful the proposed
scheme will be to improve quantity and quality of
water resources in the area," Deason explained.
Senior Ashley Simons, also an earth systems
major, has found the program helpful in anticipating
a career in research.
"It's great having the experience of actually con
ducting your own research," she said of her project
at the Hopkins Marine Station evaluating climate
shift on marine ecosystems.
"There's so much more that goes into research
than you realize — dealing with the frustrations,
learning the process and building on your back-


Kennedy
ground. The skills to evaluate
other people's research are also
really important."
Although the program centers
around environmental and public
policy issues, it attracts students
with a wide range of interests,
Kennedy said.
"The program has drawn a
preponderance of earth systems
students because they don't have
their own honors program," he
explained, "but we have also had
students from civil engineering,
biology and economics."
Students may focus their the
sis on a domestic or foreign envi
ronmental issue, Kennedy added.
He cited a student who examined
electric power deregulation in
Chile and another whose work
dealt with the Ogallala aquifer in
the Great Plains.
"Student projects always have
a scientific and analytical compo
nent, are relevant to public policy
and make some recommenda
tions for public policy," Kennedy
said.
Applications to the program
are due next quarter. An intro
ductory meeting is scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon. Interested
students should contact the insti
tute.
