# Environment policy key to IIS program

### Scott Peterson 
An interdisciplinary honors pro
gram in environmental science,
technology and policy is giving 11
students a unique opportunity to
learn from faculty at the Institute
for International Studies.
"The program is intended for stu
dents who have developed a strong
interdisciplinary interest in envi
ronment and public policy," said Bi
ology Prof. Donald Kennedy, one of

four members of the committee that directs the pro
gram.
According to Kennedy, the program emphasizes
the implications of students' research for conserva
tion policies. Students work in small group seminars
to analyze environmental problems. At the end, they
write individual honors theses that aim to suggest
practical solutions to environmental concerns.
"We try to encourage the students to make their
projects as relevant to public policy as they can,"
Kennedy said.
Both students and professors value the close rela
tionship pro-am participants have with their advi
sors and institute faculty.
"As a faculty participant it's been one of the most
rewarding teaching engagements I've had around
here," Kennedy said. "There's a lot of mutual sup
port and friendly criticism."
According to senior Jeff Deason, an earth systems
major in the program, "The actual interaction with
the students and the professors has been the most
rewarding part."
Deason is conducting his research on an experi
mental attempt by the Mojave Water Agency to boost
ground water levels in the Mojave Desert watershed.
"I am investigating how successful the proposed
scheme will be to improve quantity and quality of
water resources in the area," Deason explained.
Senior Ashley Simons, also an earth systems
major, has found the program helpful in anticipating
a career in research.
"It's great having the experience of actually con
ducting your own research," she said of her project
at the Hopkins Marine Station evaluating climate
shift on marine ecosystems.
"There's so much more that goes into research
than you realize â€” dealing with the frustrations,
learning the process and building on your back-
