# It's prime time
## Men need win in Northwest 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
For most teams, an injury to a player as talented
as Stanford's redshirt sophomore Tim Young would
sound a death knell where its championship hopes
are concerned. For the No. 20 Cardinal, it's more of
a bump in the road.
Stanford, which begins its stretch run tonight
and Saturday at the Washington schools, is deep
enough and talented enough to withstand the loss of
a healthy Young with considerable ease. With expe
rienced big men like freshman Mark Madsen, junior
Pete Van Elswyk and sophomore Mark Seaton on
the bench and the perimeter game beginning to click
again, there's no reason to panic.
Of course, that's not to say there's no pressure.
Stanford (15-6 overall, 8-5 Pacific 10 Conference),
still harboring hopes of a NCAA tournament berth
and a second-place finish in the Pac-10 — possibly
even higher — must win at least one and preferably
both of these road games to remain in the hunt. First
up is Washington State (11-13, 3-9) tonight at 7:30
on fX (STV Channel 45).
Young will probably get the start tonight, but his
playing time will be limited — as it has been the past
two games — by soreness in his back. The back
injury is not the same one that kept Young sidelined
for most of last season, but it is painful nonetheless
and a big part of the reason the 7-foot-1 sophomore
center is a combined 2-of-13 from the floor over the
past three games.
"I don't think Tim's dead yet. He's still capable of
doing the same things; he just has to get comfortable
with his back being a little bit sore," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It's not like he has a
structural problem in his back. He has a sore back
that is affecting his play because he can't get the lift
and the drive and the acceleration that he would like
to have. And you couple that with having some
tough games where balls weren't going down for him
— it has affected him a little bit.
"It's not like he is not capable of scoring 20 points
or getting 10 rebounds because he is. He can still
defend and move up and down, and he still is 7-foot.
So we're gonna ask him to do as much as he can, and
who knows? He may come out and have a big game."
Stanford will need a big game from somebody if it
hopes to reverse its recent road woes tonight at the
Cougars' Friel Court, where the Cardinal has lost
five of the last six games. This year Stanford is 2-5
on the road in the Pac-10, having last won on the
road Jan. 15 at Oregon. Since then, the Cardinal has
absorbed defeats at Oregon State, California, USC
and UCLA.
The Cougars, who were drilled by Stanford 81-61
in the teams' first meeting Jan. 25, are losers of four
straight games and eight of their last nine. Of
course, that means little when you consider the Car
dinal lost to an Oregon State team on a five-game
losing skid.
"I don't know that we're a whole lot different
than anybody else," Montgomery said. "The focus
seems to be on the last three games we played on the
road, and of course those are the three top teams in
the conference right now, and we had a chance to
win two of them. So it's not like we're going out and
just dropping dead.
"Hopefully we've learned a little bit from the past
games on the road and we've matured a little bit.
Stanford certainly looked better at home last week,
delivering 33- and 22-point thumpings of Oregon
State and Oregon, respectively.
But the Jekyll-and-Hyde routine
has persisted all season long, with
the Cardinal shooting better than
50 percent at home, but just 39
percent on the road.
Nonetheless, Stanford may
have regained some confidence
last week after having gone three
games without breaking the 40-
percent mark. Sophomore Kris
Weems has broken free of his

shooting slump, and sophomore
Arthur Lee continues to impress
while shouldering a bigger offen
sive burden in the Cardinal's new
three-guard starting lineup.
"I think they feel like they've
gotten themselves back in a posi
tion to compete for, if not the
championship, at least an NCAA
spot and getting up in the top
three in the conference," Mont
gomery said. "They did get some
confidence; the balls went down
for them. They have to feel pretty
good. Now we just have to trans
late it to the road and doing it in
another site."
