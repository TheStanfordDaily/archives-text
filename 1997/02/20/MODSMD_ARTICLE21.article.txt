# Thunderbirds roll over rugby
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
After winning its league
opener by completely control
ling the tempo of the match last
Saturday, the men's rugby
team got a taste of its own
medicine in a 31-12 loss to the
University of British Columbia
yesterday.
For most of the first half, the
Cardinal was trying to catch its
opponents. The Thunderbirds
used their faster speed to build
a 19-0 lead at the intermission.
Stanford was finally able to
pick up the pace near the end of
the half, but turnovers near the
goal and missed kicks cost the
Cardinal any scoring opportu
nities it might have had.
"I think we found that we
couldn't convert it because we
were repositioning too slow,
and also we had a couple of
turnovers that really killed us,"
said head coach Frank Boivert.
"They were very good at reposi
tioning, and maybe that's why
we took the wrong options
sometimes. Since they were so
fast at repositioning, maybe we
should have gone more along
the inside and up the middle."
The opening of the second
half was more of the same. The
Thunderbirds came out with
aggressive offense and built a
commanding 31-0 lead midway
through the period. Their
relentless defense kept the Car
dinal from getting any real
chances at scoring any tries.
The final 10 minutes of the
game were better for the Cardi
nal men. They kept attacking
and once again were able to put
British Columbia on its heels.
Stanford spent most of that
time within 20 yards of the goal
and didn't giv*. the Thunder
birds a chance to increase the
lead any more.

Senior James Deaker finally
put the men on the board a lit
tle more than halfway through
the period but then missed his
own conversion. Junior Mike
Weiner scored the men's second
try, and the successful conver
sion which followed rounded off
the scoring for the game.
"Overall, I'm quite happy.
We stayed in the game, and the
guys didn't get discouraged. We
kept fighting, and I think it was

a tremendous learning experi
ence," Boivert said. "I think
later on we adjusted [to the fast
tempo], and this is why we
came back a little bit, especially
in the second half. So it's just a
matter of that pace."
The men will continue to
work on picking up the speed of
their game next Monday, when
they host UC-Davis at 4:15
