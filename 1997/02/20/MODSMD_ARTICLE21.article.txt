# Thunderbirds roll over rugby
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
After winning its league
opener by completely control
ling the tempo of the match last
Saturday, the men's rugby
team got a taste of its own
medicine in a 31-12 loss to the
University of British Columbia
yesterday.
For most of the first half, the
Cardinal was trying to catch its
opponents. The Thunderbirds
used their faster speed to build
a 19-0 lead at the intermission.
Stanford was finally able to
pick up the pace near the end of
the half, but turnovers near the
goal and missed kicks cost the
Cardinal any scoring opportu
nities it might have had.
"I think we found that we
couldn't convert it because we
were repositioning too slow,
and also we had a couple of
turnovers that really killed us,"
said head coach Frank Boivert.
"They were very good at reposi
tioning, and maybe that's why
we took the wrong options
sometimes. Since they were so
fast at repositioning, maybe we
should have gone more along
the inside and up the middle."
The opening of the second
half was more of the same. The
Thunderbirds came out with
aggressive offense and built a
commanding 31-0 lead midway
through the period. Their
relentless defense kept the Car
dinal from getting any real
chances at scoring any tries.
The final 10 minutes of the
game were better for the Cardi
nal men. They kept attacking
and once again were able to put
British Columbia on its heels.
Stanford spent most of that
time within 20 yards of the goal
and didn't giv*. the Thunder
birds a chance to increase the
lead any more.

Senior James Deaker finally
put the men on the board a lit
tle more than halfway through
the period but then missed his
own conversion. Junior Mike
Weiner scored the men's second
try, and the successful conver
sion which followed rounded off
the scoring for the game.
"Overall, I'm quite happy.
We stayed in the game, and the
guys didn't get discouraged. We
kept fighting, and I think it was

a tremendous learning experi
ence," Boivert said. "I think
later on we adjusted [to the fast
tempo], and this is why we
came back a little bit, especially
in the second half. So it's just a
matter of that pace."
The men will continue to
work on picking up the speed of
their game next Monday, when
they host UC-Davis at 4:15

p.m. in the second league match
of the season. The second and
third teams will face Davis on
Saturday at 9 and 11 a.m.,
respectively.
The women's team will play
the University of Victoria
(British Columbia) Saturday on
Maloney Field at 1 p.m. The team
has found success when they
command the tempo of the game
and will have to continue doing
so in order to take on the larger
Vikings.
Winning will mean "control
ling the game defensive-wise,
really getting our tackles in and
being the aggressor instead of
just holding back," said junior
Jen Sandoval. "We also have to

read the field a little bit better."
The women will also have to
make sure to effectively use
their basic skills in order to pre
vent their opponents from tak
ing advantage of the size differ
ence.
"I think especially for this
weekend against the University
of Victoria, who's a lot bigger and
a lot stronger size-wise than we
are, a really big thing we need to
work on is utilizing the skills that
we have," said sophomore Lara
Strauss.
We need to focus on "getting
really, really low in tackles to
sort of compensate for the differ
ence in sizes and also sort of
pulling together in general as a
team," Strauss said. "We all have
a lot of really great skills, but
very rarely have we sort of pulled
everything together and been on
top of things."
