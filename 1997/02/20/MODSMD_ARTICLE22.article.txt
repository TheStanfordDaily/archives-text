# Softball faces grueling test

The Stanford softball season has consisted of
both convincing victories and nailbiting defeats.
Going into the San Diego State Classic this week
end, the team is at a crossroads. Can the Cardinal
(4-6) convert close games against ranked opponents
into clutch victories? The answer may determine
the team's overall season record.
The eight-team tournament will pit each of the
teams against one another in a seven-game round
robin. The field will include such strong teams as
No. 5 Michigan, No. 14 Long Beach State and No.
15 Cal State-Northridge. Stanford will begin play at
8:30 a.m. today against No. 22 Hawaii.
Going into the second day of competition, Stan
ford will take on Northridge at 3:15 p.m. Saturday's
matches will be against Arkansas at 12:15 p.m.,
Michigan at 4:45 p.m. and Sacramento State at 7
p.m. And on Sunday, the Card will face Long Beach
State at 10 a.m. and San Diego State at 12:30 p.m.
In only its fourth year as a varsity sport, the rel
atively young team is facing a monstrously difficult
schedule. Led by new head coach John Rittman, the
squad has improved tremendously on offense com
pared to last year, although its run production is
still sporadic. The team record of 4-6 is not a telling
sign of the squad's potential. Four of the losses have
come against top-25 teams, and all six setbacks were
close.
In fact, every loss has had the potential to be a
Cardinal victory. A couple fewer errors, one or two
more breaks, a well-timed hit; any of these could
have easily made Stanford's record 8-2 instead of 4-
6. One cannot control the breaks, but fewer errors
and a bit more hits are possible and likely for the
rapidly improving Cardinal.
The team's remaining schedule does not get any
easier. The Pac-10 consists of six top-10 teams, and
several other non-league games are against ranked
opponents. The reactivation of junior Jessica Schul
man to the pitching rotation should improve an
already excellent, but depleted, pitching staff. The
rotation now consists of sophomore Becky Blevins,
sophomore Marcy Crouch and Schulman.
The Card starts only one senior, Amanda Ren te
rm, at third base and one junior, Dawn Kobata, in
the outfield. With a relatively young team, Stanford
has great prospects for improvement throughout
the season and in the next few seasons.
