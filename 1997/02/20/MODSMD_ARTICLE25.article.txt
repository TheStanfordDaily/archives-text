# Netters head to Louisville

The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
takes off for Louisville to take part in the ITA
National Indoor Championships today through
Sunday.
Undefeated and untouchable so far this season,
knocking off all five teams it has faced without
dropping a point, the Card should meet up with
some more difficult competition in Kentucky.
"This is our first big match of the season so we
are really excited," said head coach Dick Gould.
"We are really looking forward to the competition."
The Card will definitely find it in Louisville. The
National Indoors invite the top 16 teams in the
nation to compete in the event. Stanford is seeded
No. 1, ahead of UCLA, Mississippi State and Geor
gia who are seeded second, third and fourth respec
tively.
The Card will look to knock off Kentucky, who it
meets in the first round of play. Gould said this will
not be an easy task.
"Kentucky has some really great players in both
Ludde Sundin and Cedric Kauffman," Gould said.
These should prove to be the toughest competi
tion the Card has faced thus far in NCAA competi
tion. Sundin, a senior, is currently ranked fifth in
the country, and Kauffman, a junior, is right
behind at sixth. The top-ranked players for the
Card are No. 17 Paul Goldstein and 23rd-ranked
Ryan Wolters.
If Stanford wins in the first round, the Card
moves on to play tomorrow at 1 p.m., against the
winner of 6th-ranked Pepperdine and 12th-ranked
Louisiana State. The winner of that quarterfinal
match plays Saturday at 4 p.m. Should the Card
make it to the finals, Stanford will play Sunday at
noon.
If the Cardinal loses, it is still guaranteed three
rounds of play in the consolation bracket. But the
tournament will definitely give the young and tal
ented Cardinal a perspective on the competition for
this upcoming season, as well as a chance to prove
its No. 1 ranking.
"We have been in the finals three of the last four
years and won a couple of them," Gould said.
It didn't happen last year, when top-seeded
Stanford was crushed by second-seeded UCLA 5-1
in the final, ending Stanford's 34-match winning
streak.
