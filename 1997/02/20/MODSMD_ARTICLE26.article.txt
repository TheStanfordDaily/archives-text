# Tennis embarks on first challenge of year
## Women travel to Madison for Indoors 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis squad looks to make a major
statement this weekend as it takes on
the top teams from around the coun
try at the Women's National Indoor
Team Tennis Championship in Madi
son, Wis.
The tournament field features
nine of the nation's top 10 teams in a
preview of what is to come in the bat
tle for the national championship
this May.
"I think Arizona got us off with
some good competition and this
would be the second opportunity to
make a statement," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "Obvi
ously, this is a little bit bigger. We
have teams from all around the coun
try that we might not have a second
chance to beat."
The Cardinal (8-0, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) was
awarded the draw's second seed
behind the top-ranked Florida
Gators, last year's NCAA and Indoor
defending champions.
Florida and Stanford have been
ranked 1-2 in collegiate women's ten
nis for the last 12 months. The
Gators defeated the Cardinal in the
finals of the NCAA Championship
last season, as well as in the finals of
the National Team Indoors. The two
teams are expected to vie for the cov
eted NCAA crown once again this
season at the NCAA tournament at
Stanford beginning May 17.
Florida, Stanford and UCLA are
making their 10th appearance at the
National Team Indoors. The Gators
have won the title four times while
the Cardinal has nabbed three wins
of its own.
Following the top two seeds are
Duke at the No. 3 seed and Pac-10
rival Arizona at No. 4.
"I think Florida, as usual, is going

to be good," Brennan said. "And I
think one of the sleepers, although
they are hardly a sleeper now that
everyone knows about them, is Duke.
They are really pretty good. Then
there are several other talented
teams after that."
The Cardinal will meet No. 21
Alabama in the first round today,
with the winner of No. 8 Pepperdine
and No. 11 Notre Dame awaiting in
the second frame. The Crimson Tide,
a squad largely made up of foreign
players, is making its first appear
ance in the tournament.
The Blue Devils and the No. 7 Bru
ins are also in the Cardinal's half of
the bracket.
Despite the expectations to reach
the final match, the Cardinal will be
coming into the tourney at less than
100 percent. Freshman Lilia Oster
loh, one of the Cardinal's top singles
and doubles competitors, is still nurs
ing a bad shoulder.
"Her shoulder is still not getting
ready yet," Brennan said. "We're not
going in there at our healthiest. It
will be interesting. We do have quite
a few injuries, so we'd like to get
through without getting any more
injured."
Despite the injuries, Brennan still
hopes to meet the Gators come Sun
day afternoon's final.
"Because we're not healthy, we're
certainly not going to be at full
strength by any means," said Bren
nan. "I don't know what the other
teams are going to be looking like
though. Everyone else could be
injured too. I'm optimistic we can
still win this thing without all our
top players, but it will be a bit
tougher.
"We'd like to win it. Over and
above that, we'd like to see what the
other teams look like, who they've
got and what our competition is going
to be. It will be a pretty good pre
view."
