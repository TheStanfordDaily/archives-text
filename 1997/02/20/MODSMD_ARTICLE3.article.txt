# Senior starts up community farm
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
With the creation of a new
community farm on University
land, The Farm will soon better
deserve its nickname.
Senior Brian Halweil, an earth
systems and biology major, has
been the driving force behind ef
forts to create the Farm's new
farm.
Halweil, who worked on a stu
dent farm for two quarters at the
UC-Davis, said he realized "Stan
ford doesn't have much to offer in
terms of practical farming."
At the beginning of fall quar
ter, Halweil began collecting sup
port for his proposal to "provide
students with an environment in
which they can learn, study and
practice farming techniques in
volved in small-scale food produc
tion."
Franklin Orr, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, signed
on as the proposed farm's sponsor
last quarter.
Orr highlighted the acadt.-u
value of the farm, describing the
project's "interests in all the envi
ronmental aspects of farming and
interplay between urban society
and farming."
According to Herb Fong, man
ager of facilities operations, the
proposed site of the farm is land
which, more than 20 years ago,
was "designated available to fac
ulty, staff and students for garden
plots. There isn't a lot of activity
out there. We have sites available
for as many as 30 or 40, but it ends
up just about as many as sue peo
ple use the site. It gets cultivated
every year, and there's water out
there."
Fong said he encouraged Hal
weil's proposal and offered sug
gestions because the site "is un
derutilized, and we can use it to
help support organizations for
students, education and research.
Because of this, we want to partic

ipate in it and cooperate with it.
"Anyone can use the land right
now, but what we really wanted
was that it would be official and
recognized as the Stanford Com
munity Farm," said Halweil.
Making the site officially the
Stanford Community Farm will
allow future development.
Halweil's proposal is ambi
tious. It outlines how the farm
could serve as a "multidiscipli
nary laboratory for the study of
agroforestry, animal husbandry,
botany, business operations, ecol
ogy, entomology, land restora
tion, landscape design, philoso
phy, rural sociology, soil science,
solar technology, sustainable
agriculture and zoology."
According to Orr, part of his
role was to "put up some money
for the land assessment process,
which has been the same kind of
process that Hewlett-Packard or
Bill Gates has to go through when
they want to build a facility on
campus."
The farm, as described by Hal
weil, en visioned as being a col
lective effort.
"When you work there." said
Halweil, "you will be able to share
in the harvest. Those who want to
volunteer can just get out there
and start working. In the near fu
ture. we will have a board on the
side of a shed where we will post
what needs to be done on a daily
basis. We'll also have a system of
farm managers to train volun
teers and make sure the farm
runs smoothly."
The farm, said Halweil, will be
"bio-intensive." All farming
methods will be organic and labor
intensive. Large-scale, mecha
nized methods will be avoided.
Compost will be used to fertil
ize the soil, said Halweil, so that
the farm "won't depend on large
amounts of external inputs,
which can be an unsustainable

process because you end up deplet
ing soil from one site to enrich an
other."
According to Halweil, fruit trees
will be provided by the Magic
Fruition Program. The fruition
program is run by Magic, Inc., a
nonprofit corporation in Palo Alto
which salvages trees from farms in
the Central Valley and distributes
them to parks, schools and commu
nity gardens. The trees, said Hal
weil, would otherwise be burned
because of price-control maneu
vers by farmers.
The farm will be a community
resource. Orr said the "produce
could be used in campus food ser
vices or perhaps even be sold to pay
expenses."
A spot is reserved for next sum
mer at the Palo Alto Farmers Mar -

ket from which the farm plans to
sell produce. Halweil predicts that
one day of sales alone would be
enough to pay for the operation of
the farm for an entire year.
The farm will also be education
al. Fong said, "I think what Brian is
doing is a worthwhile cause to help
educate people in the use of alterna
tive means of producing crops that
are low impact to the environment
and can yield very positive results."
In addition, Halweil says in his
proposal that the farm will serve as
a "community outreach tool to
work in conjunction with such
Stanford organizations as [the
Stanford Homeless Action Coali
tion and Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford] and
such non-University organiza
tions as Second Harvest Food
Bank, the Palo Alto community
farm and the East Palo Alto com
munity farm."
Beyond all of this potential,
though, Halweil said the larger

goal of the farm is to "instill an eco
logical consciousness in people and
serve as a model to other communi
ties and institutions to begin simi
lar projects. The farm can demon
strate alternative ways of living
which are a little more responsible
and less destructive."
Fong said the farm will be a
"nice change of pace from every
thing else that's on campus."
Meanwhile, Orr said, "Who knows,
maybe when my meetings get too
heavy duty I'll go work on the
farm." It sounds like a break work
ing on the farm will soon be an op
tion for all of the Stanford commu
nity, what ever kind of hectic
schedule they may have.
Planting at the farm can begin
this week. A shed, running water,
tools and seed will probably be
available by the end of next week.
