T' he story is about .is tragic as they come. I wo lovers, she an 1 thiopian sla\e and
he an Fgvptian hero, die in each others' arms, buried alive in a stone tomb. I he
story of "A id a," the current production of the San Francisco Opera,-is not the
most important part ot the show (otherwise, I would not have given the ending awav).
But first, a lew technical notes. The famous opera is playing at the Bill (iiaham
Civic Auditorium because the War.Memorial Opera House is cunenth undugoing
seismic restructuring. When one talks to employee's ot the San Francisco Opei a, it lu
comes obvious that the space is not ideally suited tin' operas. W hen one is in the audi
ence, it is even more telling, as sounds tend to lade when cast membeis turn, aiound
or are not well-positioned near the microphones. I his slight though noticeable an
noyance aside, the show can still go on. Also, the cast 1 saw on February 1 3 was not the
opening cast, so you may see different performers depending on when \ou go.
1 he main beauty of "Aida" is the music. The score was composed by Giuseppe
Verdi, who is considered by many to be the unrivaled master of opera. As soon as it
was First performed at the Cairo Opera House in 1871, "Aida" was an instant success.
The music is both triumphant and moving in its war scenes and full of sorrow and
pathos when the lovers are in anguish,
Certainly, "Celeste Aida" is one of the more beautiful arias to be found in opera.
Radames ( Walter Fraccaro) sings this tribute to his beloved, the Ethiopian slave Aida,
immediately before he is told by the King of Egypt (Daniel Sumegi) that lie w ill be the
one to lead the Egyptian troops against the Ethiopians. Meanwhile, the king s daugh
ter, Amnerrs (Eugenie tirunewald), who is alsq in realizes that
Radames loves her slave, Aida (Marquita Lister). #'-
The twist in the story is that Aida is actually thefrificesijpf 1 t&iopia and her
Amonasro (Christopher Robertson), is going to war for her sake. When Aida real
iiv.i .1,.. ic iii with tln< man who is finhtinc her father, she is torn between lo\al~ ■

tics'. She goes back and forth in an anguish-filled aria, unsure whether to choose love
of her country and her father or love lor Riidames.
Radames is in anguish as well. When lie returns triumphant over l thiopia he re
quests, because of his love for Aida, that the Ethiopian prisoners be released. The King
of Egypt concedes his wish but then grants him Amneris' hand in marriage as the re
ward for his courage in battle. And from here the story plays out to its tragic ending,
full of betrayal, death and despair —which are all ingredients that good opera should
possess. 1
In addition to the good (though not excellent) singing, oneot the most interesting
aspects of this production of "Aida" is the choreography. In many scenes there is
"opera ballet" choreographed by Donald Byrd. The set and the staging is imaginative, -
with the orchestra above the stage in an innovative use of space and the set sumptu
ous though not overbearing. The rich costumes display the diversity of I gyptian.and
Ethiopian clothing — the Egyptian headpieces, each ornately decorated and unique,
were my favorite part of the costumes.
Overall, 1 would say that "Aida" is not the'best production of the year by the San
Francisco Opera, but it certainly has its moments. The triumphal scenes are powerful
and full of original dance and strong emotion, while the t wo lovers' despair is touch
ing and distressing. The opera is a classic and should be viewed by anyone who has a
passing interest in learning about the art. ,
The San Francisco Opera is performing "Aida" through Feb. 23. Most ol the later
performances contain a different cast, but it will no doubt be as good as this one. At
