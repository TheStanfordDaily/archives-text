## MACHINAL 
### 
What would motivate a young woman to
ruthlessly murder her sleeping husband? This
is the question underlying Sophie Treadwell's
1928 play, "Machinal," which has been revived
by the American Conservatory Theater and is
presently playing at Geary Theater.
One would expect a tale of marital horror—
psychological and physical abuse at the hands

of a cruel tyrant. Instead, the answer
seems to be simply that the husband
was annoying, rather clueless and had
gruesome "fat hands." But it isn't near
ly that straightforward, and therein lies
the still-relevant message of Tread
well's brilliant and disturbing play: In a
society obsessed with the practical and
efficient, things aren't always as ratio
nal and obvious as we may want (and
perhaps need) them to be.
Treadwell based her play loosely on
the notorious 1927 murder trial of
Ruth Snyder, who (with her lover)
killed her husband and was found
guilty and executed. Treadwell attend
ed most of Snyder's trial, and after wit
nessing the judge's refusal to allow a
psychiatric exam and any discussion
of Snyder's psychological state, want
ed to recreate the psychological "evi
dence" that had been prohibited.
Treadwell alters certain details from
the Snyder trial (Snyder's husband ac
tually was abusive) to explore the gen
eral societal pressures (rather than
specifics of their relationship) that
could drive a woman to murder.
"Machinal" is a French word
meaning mechanical, automatic be
havior. Director Laird Williamson uti
lizes various theatrical techniques to
create a world — representing Ameri
can society in the '20s — that requires
automatons rather than individuals. A
massive grid of iron bars looms be
hind the play's action, a constant re
minder that beneath the trappings of
society lies a rigid system of behavior
that imprisons individuals and is im
possible for mere humans — and par
ticularly women — to alter or escape.
The simple sets with minimal props,
flooded in stark lighting, are based on
Edward Hopper's paintings and con
vey a similar sense of alienation and
detachment.
The main character is simply
named Young Woman to symbolize
her universal predicament. The audi- *
ence follows her through numerous at
tempts to survive in society, including her
marriage to her rich but repulsive boss

and then her search for means of escape from
an increasingly suffocating existence.
Treadwell wrote in the introduction to
Machinal that she wanted to tell this story by
showing the different phases of life that the
woman comes into contact with, in none of
which she finds any place, any peace. Ihe
woman is essentially soft, tender, and life
around her is essentially hard, mechanized.
Business, home, marriage, having a child,
seeking pleasure — all are difficult tor her —
mechanical, nerve nagging.

Michelle Morain tackles the difficult role of
the Young Woman wholeheartedly but not al
ways successfully. She exudes enough vulnera
bility and wonder to sustain the audience's
necessary sympathy, and she is particularly
good at the interspersed comedy which keeps
the play from sinking under the weight of its
depressing themes. But at times her voice takes

on a whiny quality that makes her seem more
like an annoying, complaining child than a
tragic victim. Surprisingly, her acting gets
more convincing as the situation grows more
intense, making potentially melodramatic
scenes moving and accessible.
The supporting acting makes up for any
lack in Morain. The Young Woman's Lover is
played by Mark Harelik, who is no Clark Gable
(who played the role in the original Broadway
production) but convincingly portrays the in
dependent, tough cowboy. He is nice enough

that you understand the Young Woman's at
traction to him but suspicious enough that
you sense long before the heroine that he may
not be the ideal she imagines.
Matt Decaro, as the unfortunate husband,
skillfully portrays a business man who may be
unbearably boring and practical (his jokes are
so dull his wife will insist she has heard them

before he even begins) but
who is basically decent. He
maintains a balance between
the insensitivity and crudeness
that makes his wife despise
him and a sincerity and harrn
lessness that complicates the
questions surrounding his
murder. This ambivalent char
acter is much more morally in
triguing than one played as a
straightforward villain.

One of the most interesting aspects of the
play is the script. Much of the dialogue is made
up of commonplace cliches and sayings, em
phasizing how even in speech (which is theo
retically a form of self-expression) people are
"programmed" with a certain vocabulary
which is spoken habitually without any real
meaning. At times cliches are literalized to il-

lustrate the absence of sincere meaning
in much of everyday conversation. At
one point the Young Woman's moth
er exclaims "you're crazy," meaning it
in the purely rhetorical .wnse, but the
Young Woman actually is going crazy
while the mother remains oblivious.
The Young Woman's dialogue
contrasts with that of the other
characters as she attempts to break
through these speech patterns and
say what she actually means. She
begs a priest reciting a prayer full of
religious rhetoric to "Pray for me a
prayer I can understand." Her ram
bling, stream-of-conscious mono
logues at first seem strange and con
voluted, but it gradually becomes
clear that hers is a more comprehen
sible language because her words
correspond with genuine human
emotions, which are not always un
derstandable or organized.
The play is surprisingly modern in
its social concerns and agendas. In
fact, some of the issues she touches
on, such as homosexuality and abor
tion, have been so debated over the
last few decades that it is eas\ to dis
miss them as standard topics in a
"progressive" and "socially con
scious" play and forget how shock
ing and disturbing they would have
been to audiences in the late 1920s
Treadwell's observation that the fe
male's role in society was generalh
limited to the "private sphere and
the responsibilities of wife and
mother accords with most modern
feminist scholars analysis ot
women's positions in the past
Treadwell wrote a provocative, las
cinating script and the \i I 's pro
duction does justice to it ihis
"Machinal" provides an intense
thought-provoking and highly en
tertaining experience that I highly
recommend. o
