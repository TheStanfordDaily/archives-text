Ijf nigfc-quality underground
party in San francisco. At
first glance, raving may seem to re
volve solely around electronic music

and psychedelic drugs.

At many parties, this is true — drugs and musit
are seen as ends in themselves. However, it's possible to

find the other parties that focus on something quite
different — a common group experience of cele
bration and focusing energies, with or without

drugs — and many Stanford students have
spent the time and effort to find them.

Raves came to the United States
from Europe in the early 19905. Since the

early raves, rave culture has spread quick
ly across the country and changed subtly.
Raves are organized most often in large

urban areas. Smaller scenes can be
found in less-populated cities, but the
largest and hippest scenes are in San
Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle
and Los Angeles.

Raves are usually held in
inner-city warehouses (although beach
and desert parties are also common
during the summer months) and can
range in size from 100 to several thou

sand people. The larger parties are called
"massives." They are well-known and

usually legal. Massives are advertised in
publications like the San Francisco Raves

calendar on the Internet, as well as through
fliers which are passed out at other parties.

At massives, all necessary permits are
purchased, security guards are hired and precau

tions are taken to limit the inevitable illegal activities

that will take place inside. Party-goers are patted down

at the door, pipes and other paraphernalia are confiscated,

opened water bottles must be thrown away before entering and

party-goers are not allowed to re-enter the party once they've left

Massives are large, expensive money-making events. As a result of this,
they attract famous DJs from around the country and sometimes other countries

However, such a large number of people makes it difficult to create a community "vibe" and
common group experience.
The process of getting to a massive is quite simple. Sometimes the actual location is
written on the flier. Other times you call the voice mail number (listed on the flier) and listen
to a message with party information, including location, time and DJ lineup.
Smaller parties are called "undergrounds." They are generally illegal in the sense that
no permits are purchased, fire codes are often violated with large numbers of guests in relative
ly small spaces and all kinds of illegal substances are bought, sold, smoked and swallowed with
out any active prohibition or prevention by the party organizers.
High-quality undergrounds, however, are generally held in safe locations with rela
tively small numbers of people, and drug sales are kept very discrete. Undergrounds are some
times advertised through fliers but are often "invite only" or "word-of-mouth" parties. The
main advantage of undergrounds is that smaller locations and more closely knit groups of peo
ple are more conducive to a community party vibe. The best undergrounds are participatory,
not consumer events.
"At a true underground," said Jon Logan, a senior and ambient music DJ, "the line be
tween the party-goers and party throwers is blurred. Raves are not rock concerts."
Because undergrounds are thrown for the purpose of creating a pleasurable group ex
perience rather than making money, underground party promoters often provide free organic
fruit, lollipops, chai (a kind of herbal tea) and water. Undergrounds also tend to have more ex
tensive decorations and ventilation systems, all to create a more serene environment for the
party-goer. However, in an underground, police intervention is a constant threat.
St) if you've decided to go to an underground instead of a massive, the process of ac
tually getting there is more complex. Assuming a raver has come across the flier to a party or has
pulled the party information off the Internet, he or she must then call the voice mail number
for the party — similar to the process for a massive. The difference is that this voice mail record
ing gives the party-goer directions to the "map point."
The map point is a location where tickets are sold, separating the financial transaction
and the party itself so that the cops will have one less reason to bust the party if they do discov

er it. (Because undergrounds are unlicensed parties, it is ilk-

gal to charge people to enter.) The personnel working the
k map point can filter out suspicious people to ensure the

safety of the rave. From the map point, the ravers are
told how to get to the party and given explicit in-
L structions on where to park.

Raves generally begin at 10 or 11 p.m. and end
after the sun has risen at 6 or 7 a.m. People arrive
at their leisure — usually before 2 a.m. Parties

start to "go off' or "peak" at around 1 a.m. Tht
dance areas at raves are often decorated wit I
black lights, lasers, computer-animated visu

als projected onto the walls, smoke, fluores
cent paintings, tie-dye wall hangings and a few
easily recognizable banners with logos thai
identify the organizers of the party. Large

speakers and bass-bins are usually placed at all
four corners of the room. A decorative altar of

some sort is usually set up in front of the
turntables to glorify the source of the overpow
ering music that guides the energy of the part\

r — theDJ.
"At a rave, the DJ is a shaman, a priest, a chan
neler of energy — he or she controls the psychic

' voyages of the dancers through the choice of hard
to-fmd music and skill in manipulating that music,

sometimes working with just a set of beats and sample
into a tapestry of mindbending music," said one con

tributor to a rave Web site. "A large part of the concept of
raves is built upon sensory overload — a barrage of audio i

and very often visual stimuli are brought together to elevate
people into an altered state of physical or psychological exis-

tence."
While some people go to raves specifically to dance, others don't dance

at all. For those who prefer to kick back all night (and for those who need a place to
rest between wild dancing sessions), "chill" areas are provided. Chill areas are usually sep
arate rooms, but in small warehouses they are often set up in a corner of the dance space.
They are decorated with mellow banners and lights. Bean bags, couches and carpeting pro
vide comfort for those who need to rest. A massage circle, and sometimes free professional

massage tables, can be found at most underground chill rooms. 1
At some parties, chill rooms are filled with the sounds of mellow electronic music
(called ambient); at others, ravers make more organic music with drums, digeridoos, flutes

and their voices. Toning sessions (group humming) and group meditation are common at

some of the underground parties. People share most everything they bring. Water flows freely.
Blowpops, fruit and marijuana make their way around the room. Everyone is invited to partake,

but no one is pressured.
While many people do rave sober, drugs have historically been an integral part of rav
ing. Like nearly all underground music movements throughout recent history — the associa
tion of heroin with jazz, psychedelics with the rock 'n' roll of the '60s and "blunts" and "40s'
with modern hip-hop — raving has come to be associated with its own group of drugs.
Rave drugs are most similar to the psychedelics of the late 19605, with an added de
signer twist. Common psychedelics ( marijuana, LSD, psilocybin and MDMA or "Ecstasy ") are
the most popular drugs at raves. Less common, but still prevalent, are modern "designer syn
thetics" like 2CB, CHB and DMT. The one common characteristic of rave drugs is their ability
to "heighten awareness" when combined with a group dance experience.
"The drugs I take at raves — if I take any at all — act as a gateway to a state of height
ened awareness," said one Stanford raver. "This state can be achieved without these chemicals,
but it's a lot easier to get there by dropping a tab of acid than meditating for an hour or so."
By far the most common drug used in the San Francisco rave scene is Ecstasy. The ef
fects of Ecstasy are described in the Third Expanded Edition of the Psychedelics Encyclopedia
as "subtle yet powerful." It reads, "MDMA provides users with a 'Time Out' during which they
can often see the possibilities and directions of their lives more clearly than under ordinary cir
cumstances. This experience has led many people to ... become more interested in spirituality
than before." Benedictine monk Brother David Steindl-Rast commented in the Encyclopedia

that "a monk spends his whole life cultivating the same awakened attitude (Ecstasy) gives you."
"I think raves provide a completely sate and utterly unique environment for people to
experience the feelings of empathy and exhilaration Ecstasy creates," said a Stanford raver.

"The experience as a whole is really one of the most incredible, overwhelming and pow
erful experiences I believe Ill ever have, right up there with being in the canyon lands."

Although many who experience Fxstasy find it pleasurable, the long-term
effects of the drue have not vet been completely determined, which makes its use

.i risk. One effect which has been discovered is damage to brain cells. Most of
the short-term danger associated with Ecstasy use includes dehydration and

overexertion; those can be controlled by drinking water and taking fre
quent dance breaks.

The Psychedelics Encyclopedia also describes Ecstasy as a
drug that "increases intimacy but in most instances tends to reduce
genital sexuality," contrary to common misconceptions. Ecstasy is J

frequently called the "hug drug." San Francisco ravers can often be
heard declaring the apho-

rism "hugs on

drugs," a catchy
alternative

to the

main-
stream

phrase "hugs,
not drugs." While

other psychedelics can be

found at San Francisco raves, Ecstasy remains the most common.

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of raving — and the one that separates it from
other scenes — is its diversity. While most raves take place in warehouses simply because of
their size, some parties occur at more interesting locations. Office buildings, delis, bank lobbies,
yacht clubs, roller rinks, boats, Tahoe cabins and even churches have seen some of San Francis
co's best undergrounds. Outdoor parties have been held on the beach, in the desert and in the
middle of the coastal redwoods.
Ravers range in age from early teens to late 50s, although the average raver is college
age. Teenagers dance and smoke joints with aging hippies, while no one seems to make an issue
out of it. Dress, too, crosses all styles. Some ravers come dressed in tie-dye shirts, others wear

fluorescent psychedelic design shirts and pants, and others simply arrive in whatever they were
wearing that day.
Music styles also vary — from ambient, trip hop, dub and breakbeat to house, progres
sive house, deep house, acid house, techno, trance, tribal and goa. While some forms of rave music
are mellower than others, the common thread is the electronic sound prevalent in all rave styles.
In general, raves are quite distinct from other social venues like bars and dance clubs.
In some ways, the difference is night and day. You don't have to be a "good" dancer to go to a
rave, because the emphasis is less on "picking up" potential dates than on having a positive
group experience. People come to raves to socialize and meet people, but hitting on others is
taboo. This fact, learned early on, discourages some from raving while encouraging others.
Raves are generally a safe place where people can feel tree to express themselves open
ly and honestly without the fear of humiliation or physical danger. If fights break out, they're
the exception to the rule. The types of intoxicants at bars and raves differ as well because alco
hol and nicotine are the primary drugs used at bars. Moreover, just as illegal drugs are frowned
on at bars and dance clubs, alcohol is scorned in the rave scene.
"At a rave, alcohol puts you out of it; psychedelics put you into it," said one Stanford
raver. This idea is shared by a large percentage of ravers, as is evidenced by a complete lack of
alcohol at raves.
San Francisco, self-proclaimed as the most liberal city in the nation, probably has a
larger hippie influence than any other rave scene, which could account for the acceptance, free
dom and diversity that many ravers say is unique to the Bay Area. The "PLUR" ideal of peace,

love, unity and respect epitomizes the San Francisco rave experience, ac

cording to DJ and parly organizer Tom Leichardt.
"Raves put together with pure intentions are very

lowerful," Leichardt said. "They are places where
everyone can be themselves. Our gatherings reflect

what many peoples have been doing for thou
sands of years: coming together to dance and
L celebrate life. Communal dance experience

is very spiritual. We are trying to put out a
message that we are all interconnected
with each other and with the earth. It is

a message quite contrary to the dom
inant culture, which exploits peo
k pie and mother Harth for profit.'

However, some feel that all
of this new-age garbled mumbo
is merely an excuse for people
to take Ecstasy and get tac-

tile, said one undergraduate
non-raver. "I've been to a
couple raves and enjoyed
the musical experience. 1
even listen to techno while
feeding my cat. But spiri
tuality can't be found at
communal freak-outs.
The acid tests failed."
The non-raving stu

dent went on to say that
the converging aspects of
tree-form music and
dance performance at
raves merited some artis
' tic value as a slice of con
temporary society.
The San Francisco
rave scene is very postmod
ern: An integral part of the
>i u .l

I scene is the overwhelming use
' of the Internet. E-mail is the
primary form of communica-

' tion between party organizer
and between ravers in general

Rave lists are established for rapid
and widespread dissemination of
rave dates, information numbers

and DJ lineups.
"The San Francisco rave

community owes its existence to a
computer called Hyperreal which serves

as the most comprehensive online rave
culture archive," said Logan, the Stanford se-

nior. "It houses the SF Raves calendar and manv
other regional calendars. Most importantly, it is

home to the SF Raves mailing list community, with a
current subscribershipot 400 wired / dedicated / opinion-

ated SF Ravers."
It you like what you've read so far, you might want to check out the Web site http://hy
perreal.com to see if the rave scene is for you. Within the raving community, you might have to
sort through a few scenes to find out the one that fits you best. But beware: According to many
ravers, raving is not for everyone. If you have a low tolerance tor drugs, hugs, techno music,
dancing in general, hot sweaty places or staying up all night, you might not enjoy a rave. On the
other hand, you never know until you try. D
