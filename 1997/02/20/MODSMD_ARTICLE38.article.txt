## Sasha and John Diaweed "Northern Exposure" 
### 
How could there be a rave issue without
a glimpse into what a few of Europe's finest
DJs have been up to recently? Sasha and
John Digweed, both highly touted for their
seamless mixing have put together a joint
effort that features 22 tracks mixed in key.
(In other words, they've made the songs
sound like they belong together).
Sasha and Digweed each have their own
successful musical careers, writing and
remixing electronic music for the labels
Deconstruction and Stress respectively.
Consistent with their own creations,
"Northern Exposure" is a compilation that
does not feature "hits" but rather a lineup
of insightful and creative, heavily layered
intelligent electronic music that not only
inspires one's groove genes but also over
flows with enough imaginative juice to fill
Lake Lagunita 100 times over.
To try to classify the music on "North
ern Exposure" as definitively house or
trance makes little sense. Many of these
songs lie in that bit of gray area between
the two genres for which language has yet
to create a defining category (perhaps it's
just as well).
Disc one, naturally a bit more mellow
than its successor, contains several tracks
from some very well respected artists in
cluding the Future Sound of London, God

Within (San Francisco's own Scott Hard
kiss), Rabbit in the Moon, a now-impossi
ble-to-find remix of William Orbit's
"Water From a Vine Leaf," Banco De Gaia
and Apollo 440 to name a few.
Disc two launches into a higher gear
with the Drum Club's uplifting "Sound
System" and the haunting acid melodies of
Castle Trancelot's "The Gloom," X Tracks'
"Plan 94 (The Voyage)" and Banco De
Gaia's "Heliopolis," which is so good it'll
make the hair on the back of your neck
crawl. (It makes mine crawl every time.)
Also included in disc two is a no-longer
available remix of Underworld's "Dark
and Long."
In addition to excellent lineups, both
discs flow as a single piece such that one
who has not previously heard these songs
gets the idea that the songs and feel of the
music are changing, but the boundaries
where one song ends and the next one be
gins are undefined. That's what makes
Sasha and Digweed so good. There is no
scratching in this compilation, only amaz
ingly stealthy and seamless mixing that
only they can provide.
Brilliant mixing and an ear for high
quality and insightful songs make "North
ern Exposure" a treasure for the electronic
music connoisseur. Like many of the fea

tured tracks themselves, this compilation
may not be around long in order to make
way for subsequent releases, as is the way
with the electronic music industry. Some
dance music stores in the City may still
have a copy or two left if you hurry.
Now, how to get to Europe. . ..
