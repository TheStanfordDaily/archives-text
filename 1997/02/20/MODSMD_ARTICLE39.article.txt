# Widespread Panic
## "Bombs and Butterflies" 
### 
If funky-country-meets-gui
tar-rock is your kind of ren
dezvous, then Widespread
Panic's latest album, "Bombs and
Butterflies," is for you. Don't
write these guys off just because
their 30-something look doesn't
jive with the college-scene appeal
— this mustachioed sextet pos
sesses exemplary musical talent
even if it does lack originality.
Let's talk vocals. John Bell pro
vides powerful yet refined front
vocals, ranging from a Chris Cor
nell rasp to a Dylanesque drawl.
F.ven so, Bell definitely manages
to maintain his own vocal identi
ty. Add John Hermann and
Michael Houser on the backups
and you have a smooth harmon
ic groove that weaves throughout
songs like "Tall Boy."

The hands focus is on their prolific guitar playing. "You Got Yours"
and "Radio Child" showcase the typical (leaning towards generic) riffs
that are a staple on this album. "Rebirtha" opens up with a funky gem
of a bass-line which is unfortunately overshadowed in most of the
other more guitar-laden songs.
The hoys manage to throw it all together in my favorite song, "Cra
dle" — maybe because they ease up on the guitars a bit and let the other
musicians strut their stuff. The focus is on the diversity of Bell's vocals
rather than a hyped-up guitar contest. Hermann contributes a tender
piano backup which sets this song apart from the harsher sound of

pure guitar.
These guys definitely have the basics down, but their motto seems
straight out of Wayne's World — "we fear change" — it seems Wide
spread Panic's style hasn't changed much from previous albums. The
everyday listener (me) gets a little tired of the same straightforward
guitar-centric format that might appeal more to the aspiring gui
tarist.
Thus, we are trapped in a catch-22 — Widespread Panic is built
around guitars, but I prefer the few songs that highlight a more diverse
sound, and, in Cump-like fashion, that's all I have to say about that.
