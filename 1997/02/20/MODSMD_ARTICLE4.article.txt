# Science fiction inspires thoughts on reality of artificial intelligence
## 
### David J. Lee 
Don't turn your back on your com
puter. Someday, "Welcome to Macin
tosh" may sound as deceptively soothing
as HAL, the murderous computer in
Stanley Kubrick's movie, "2001: A
Space Odyssey."
In "HAL's Legacy: 2001's Computer
as Dream and Reality," David Stork, the
chief scientist at the Ricoh California
Research Center and a visiting scholar
in psychology at Stanford, evaluates the
development of artificial intelligence.
Stork's inspiration for editing and
contributing to the book arose from his
aesthetic appreciation of the movie
"2001."
"I was so captured by the film," Stork
said, adding that he particularly valued
the scientific authenticity of the movie.
Indeed, "2001" is more scientifically
accurate than other popular science fic
tion movies such as "Star Wars" and
"Star Trek," Stork said.
"Smoke does not billow, and you

can't see laser beams in
outer space because
there's nothing to re
flect the light back to
your eyes," Stork said.
"Once you notice this
the movies seem very
stupid and silly."
Stork noted, "A
great work of art re
wards on many levels.

While "Star Wars" is less impressive,
"2001" becomes more impressive the
more you see it."
Because of their admiration for the
scientific truthfulness of the movie,
Stork and other contributors to the book
use "2001" as a reference point to mea
sure how far computers have come —
and how much farther they must go.
While current technology surpasses
HAL in terms of hardware, HAL is still
superior in cognitive aspects, Stork said.
Computers are not yet able to make
sophisticated plans independent of
human input, Stork said.

In the book, Murray Campbell, a de
veloper of IBM's Deep Blue chess com
puter, elaborated on this point. Deep
Blue was the first machine in history to
beat world champion Gary Kasparov in a
regulation chess match.
Campbell analyzed a 30-second scene
in which HAL beats human astronaut
Frank Poole and then compares HAL's
distinctively "human" style to that of
present-day chess computers.
"HAL appears to play chess the way
humans do. Even more importantly,
perhaps, the game reveals that HAL Ls
not simply mimicking the way humans
play; he actually understands how hu
mans think," Campbell wrote.
It is inevitable that a computer's abil
ity to reason will surpass that of a
human being, according to Campbell.
Several contributors to "HAL's Lega
cy" note that HAL exhibits more emo
tion than the astronauts in the movie.
Although future development address
this obstacle, machines that can cry or
laugh are still far off.

"We're finding out that emotion is
not just an add on or mistake but is real
ly important to intellect. Without emo
tion, cognition is incomplete," Stork
said. "People who are missing emotion
from their cognitive processes have
trouble solving problems that require
many complicated steps."
Despite the lack of feeling in comput
ers, some users react as if expecting an
emotional reaction.
Computers "don't have emotions per
se, although it is not unusual to hear
someone yelling at a computer — as if it
might feel sorry and change its behav
ior," said Rosalind Picard, an associate
professor of media technology at the

Some viewer misconceptions
arise from misleading aspects of
movies. Stork believes in the im
portance of getting the science
right in artwork because people
draw lasting conclusions from the
movies, accurate or not.
Stork cites a famous bet made by
Leland Stanford as an example of
the power of a photograph to
change public opinion.
"In the 1840s there were paint
ings of horses running very fast
with all four legs simultaneously
oft' the ground, with the two front
legs forward and the two back legs
backward," Stork said. "People
saw this painting and just took it as
fact. Then, Stanford made a bet
whether or not the horse's four
legs left the ground at the same
time."
A photographer was hired to
take a picture of a horse as it was
running. The result was that all
four legs were off the ground at the
same time, Stork said. However, re
ality was opposite to popular belief:
The front legs were pointed back
and back legs were pointed forward.
"Once people saw those pho
tographs, they thought the previ
ous painting was ridiculous," Stork
said.
Likewise, Stork hopes his book
can act as an educational tool.
"You'll never see '2001' the
same way again. You'll see the
movie so much clearer," Stork said.
"I sometimes use it for teaching be
cause the movie facilitates discus
sion and stirs interest in computer
science."
