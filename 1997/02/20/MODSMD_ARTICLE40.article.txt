# "Fire on the Mountain"
## Reggae Celebrates The Grateful Dead 
### 
The Grateful Dead were highly influ
enced by several different musical genres at
different times. These included blues, blue
grass and country in their early years as a
blues-rock band, funk and psychedelic dur
ing their maturing years in the later 1960s
and '70s and jazz and modern rock after
that. But reggae?
The only vaguely reggae songs I've heard
by the Dead are both from the 1970s — "Es
timated Prophet" and "Aiko-Aiko" (a
cover) — but it's true that on side projects
Jerry Garcia covered such reggae classics as
"Stop that Train" and "Harder They Come."
So when I saw "Fire on the Mountain: Reg
gae Celebrates The Grateful Dead," I was in
terested.
But when 1 listened to it, 1 was bothered.
This collection of Kingston and Jamaican
musicians has taken 11 beautiful songs and
massacred them. This is not an album of
old-school classic folk reggae; this is an
album of heavily synthed dub dancehall
pop reggae. Every track is fundamentally al
tered from its original Dead incarnation.
What amazes me is that the musicians
on this disc, which includes such reggae
stalwarts as Wailing Souls, "Toots" 1 libbert,
Judy Mowatt and Joe Higgs, can have over
looked the tenuous influence that reggae
had on the Grateful Dead via the blues and
country music. There is almost no explo
ration of the beat, which is what I would
have expected these reggae artists to be in
terested in. Instead, this album is a contest
to see who could most successfully change
the vocal melody into a cheesy pop line.
There are a few worthwhile tracks on this
album. Halfway through the disc, Steel
Pulse turns in a nice "Franklin's Tower,"
catching the song's upbeat spirit with syn
thesized ska, strong vocals and good horns.
Michael Rose brings soulful vocals and per
sonal emotion to the ballad "Wharf Rat." In
the liner notes he says"The songa-deal with
this lady, Pearly Baker, and I like the story
because it make you think. Today you're up
and tomorrow you're down." And San
Francisco-based Lasana Bandele takes a
more classically stripped-down approach
to the epic "Cassidy" — unique among the
artists on this album.
But in truth, most of this album is not
just boring; it's painful to listen to. Freddie
McGregor's "Eyes of the World" doesn't
begin to compare to the Grateful Dead ver
sion (especially when saxophonist Branford
Marsalis collaborated on this same song
live, on the Dead album "Without a Net").
Classics like "Casey Jones," "Touch Of
Gray," "Row Jimmy," "Uncle John's Band"
and "Fire On The Mountain" simply lack
fire and soul. And neither of the other two
tracks on the album are Dead originals. Al
most nothing went right here, and it's not
worth our time to talk about "Reggae Cele
brates the Grateful Dead" any more.
