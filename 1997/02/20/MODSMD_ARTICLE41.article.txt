# sub Urbia
## soundtrack 
### 
In Richard Linklater's new film "subUrbia," he pre
sents the suburbs of America as an endless stream ofstrip
malls, fast food joints, convenience stores and subdivi
sions that are all essentially bland and indistinguishable.
Unfortunately, that is a decent description of its
soundtrack, which features the latest alterna-rock offer
ings by such groups as Sonic Youth, the Butthole
Surfers, Skinny Puppy and Boss Hog.
Sonic Youth wrote and performed the film's sleep
inducing score, and they provide four songs to the
album, one of which is a solo effort by guitarist
Thurston Moore. "Bee-Bee's Song" is absolutely intol
erable, a nightmarish grunge lullaby that groans on
endlessly over a weak bassline. Moore's "Psychic
1 learts" is slightly better, though it is difficult to tell if its
"I hate everyone" message is sarcastic or not. The high
point of the Sonic Youth set is "Sunday," a reasonably
good pop song marred by one of the group's trademark
extended noise jams.
Sadly, Sonic Youth is not the only group cranking out
boring, guitar-heavy suicide notes. U.N.K.LE.'s song
"Berry Meditation" is a dull electronic meander, Boss
Hog's "I'm Not Like Everybody Else" ironically dis
proves its title and Skinny Puppy has the odd idea of
basing a rock song on the "X-Files" theme.
However, there are a few bright kids on this dull sub

urban block (to kill off a metaphor). Beck, who seems
unable to do wrong this year, scores again with "Feath
er in Your Cap," an aching Neil Young-esque acoustic
ballad. Its caustic chorus of "disappointment is a feath
er in your cap" is a spot-on sneer at all the dour musings
on this album.
Meanwhile, Elastica — with special guest Stephen
Malkmus of Pavement — does an excellent, romping
cover of "Unheard Music." Malkmus' famous practical
joke style of guitar playing shines, and the shared vocals
are oddly effective.
Superchunk's "Does Your Hometown Care?" is pure
grunge sugar pop — pleasing enough to listen to but for
gettable. "Human Cannonball" by the Butthole Surfers
is strong, but only on the virtue of a riff stolen from the
Feelies' "Forces at Work" and lyrics borrowed from Bob
Dylan's "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)."
In the end, the "subUrbia" soundtrack raises the
same question as the movie. What is it about America in
the 1990s that makes its teen-agers want to listen to wit
less, self-indulgent paeans to angst? The sad thing about
the album is that Gene Pitney's cheeseball '60s-era song
"Town Without Pity," which closes the soundtrack, is
more enjoyable than 90 percent of his oh-so-serious
'90s successors.
