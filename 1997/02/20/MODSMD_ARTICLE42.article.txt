# The 						Kinks
## "To the Bone" 
### 
If there ever was a group ripe for re
discovery, it would be the Kinks.
Because the British invasion of the
1960s was severely split between the ab
solutely essential (the Beatles, the Rolling
Stones, the Who) and the absolute trash
(Herman's Hermits, Gerry and the Pace
makers, etc.), the Kinks hold a unique
place in pop musical history as the only
legitimately talented invasion band that
did not become larger than life.
However, as a largely overlooked in
fluence on the current Brit-pop scene,
with a number of bands (such as Blur and
Sleeper) having adopted Ray Davies' pat
tern of story songs, the Kinks are perhaps
positioned for a revival.
Thus, the Kinks have released an un
usual compilation, a mixture of live
tracks before a small audience and most
ly acoustic studio rerecordingsofold ma
terial: "To The Bone" is a surprisingly en
gaging testament to the band's history.
Despite the rather unnatural arrange
ment of this semi-live album (the tracks
were recorded over a 2-year period), the
work is greater than the sum of its parts,
documenting the brilliant range of Ray
Davies' songwriting.
Unfortunately, the group's most
memorable hits, "You Really Got Me'

and "Lola," are both turned into rather
bored sing-a-longs. Still, the band's less
er hits, such as "Tired of Waiting" and
"All Hay and All of the Night," are given
strong, assured readings. However, the
album's true strength lies in its lesser
known treasures.
The intoxicating "Set Me Free" rocks
convincingly while the optimistic "Better
Things" is a redemptive moment. "Don't
Forget To Dance," however, gives the
album its most beautiful and cathartic
moment, as a stately ballad to the impor
tance of not letting age wear one down.
On the album's most powerful track,
"I'm Not Like Everybody Else," the Kinks
even turns a relatively obscure b-side
into a brilliant loner anthem. Indeed,
this song nicely sums up what has made
the Kinks a tragically great band. Regard
less of their popularity, the group has put
out accomplished rock for over three
decades, staying true to Ray Davies' artis
tic vision as it has evolved from lust and
anger to nostalgia and loss.
The Kinks may never have been as
popular as the Beatles, the Stones or the
Who, but they succeeded because they
were themselves — meaning they were
not like everybody else.
