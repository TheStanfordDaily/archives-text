## "Day Three of My New Life" 
### 
Straight out of Davis, Calif., comes Knap
sack, a sign that there is life in the Sacramento
Valley music scene outside of Cake. After re
leasing its debut album "Silver Sweepstakes" in
1995, which yielded a popular 120-minute sin
gle, "Cellophane," the group returned from the
road to record its latest, "Day Three of My New
Life."
The music is powered by predictable yet
adequate guitar rhythms and nice strong vo
cals, both supplied by Blair Shehan. The
singer / guitarist is really what keeps the band
moving because the bass is quiet and irrelevant
in most of the songs. Drummer Colby Manca
sola delivers an excellent cymbal performance,
but nothing he does establishes himself as a
standout percussionist.
The trio is a excellent band to listen to in a
smoky club with your friends while you're wait
ing for one of your favorite alternative groups
to take the stage. Rather than say to your
friends, "Man, I wish they'd get decent opening
bands," you'd say, "Hey, these guys are alright."
They'd put on a quality show, but of course,
you'd forget about them in a few months.
"Day Three of My New Life" has a lot of
trouble keeping a pace going through the

album. "Boxing Gloves" gets moving then
ends on a lackluster note, while the next song,
"Henry Hammers Harder," is a real winner -
the slow part isn't too slow and the chorus is
catchy — the kind of FM-radio catchy that
doesn't get dull after a few listens (strange as it
may sound).
The group really knows what it's doing on
this album, but the producer Mark Trombino
was obviously out to lunch while the boys were
in the studio. He does a good job of making
sure the songs don't all sound the same, but
time and again the group falls tlat on its face in
the middle of a number with a slow verse that
lulls the listener to sleep. Trombino should've
had the sense to say, "Look — you really need
to pick it up here."
Highlights of the album are the opener
"Thursday Side of the Street," the pounding
"Decorate the Spine" and the aggressive
"Heart Carved Tree." Both of the songs can be
played on the radio, at a party, in the car or
wherever you want to hear fast rock music that
doesn't offend the softies. Overall, Knapsack
writes decent songs and sound good, but
they're not that great, either.
