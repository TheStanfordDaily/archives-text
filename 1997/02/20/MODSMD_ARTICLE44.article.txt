## Kolya 
### 
"Kolya," the 1996 Golden Globe-winner for
best foreign film, is a charming Czech picture set
in Communist Prague in the last days before the
1989 Velvet Revolution. Director Jan Sverak of
fers us a personal view of an individual's revolu
tion that parallels major political events.
The main character in the film is Franta
Louka (Zdenek Sverak), a middle-aged cellist
who spends his days playing music for funerals
at the city crematorium and his nights playing
games with married women. Once a member of
the prestigious Prague Philharmonic, Louka is
now reduced to restoring the print on head
stones to pay for the upkeep on his mother's

house. When his young gravedigger friend (Ondrez Vetchy) offers him 40,000 kronen to
marry a Russian woman who needs Czech citizenship, Louka finds the idea of owning a Tra
bant attractive enough to quell his fears and agrees to the scheme.
I he simple scam, however, is suddenly complicated when Louka's new wife emigrates to
Germany to join her lover, leaving her 5-vear-old Russian-speaking son, Kolya (Andrej Chal
imov), behind. We've seen confirmed-bachelor-transformed-by-cute-kid stories before, but
this film avoids the saccharine tone of "Three Men and a Baby." Instead, it offers an earnest,

understated perspective that subtly charms the viewer into sympathy.
Louka's first interaction with Kolya is berating the sniffling child about Russian expan
sionism while taking off his shoes. This scene contrasts nicely with later ones in which a fraz
zled Louka calls a former paramour to come help him take care of Kolya when he is ill, or
when Louka buys five tickets to a Russian cartoon so the movie theater will play it for the lit
tle boy.
There are scenes of overwhelming tenderness when the camera lingers on the curves of
Kolya's face or his round brown eyes, and you are overwhelmed by what these tremendous
changes must look like from a five-year-old's perspective. Young Chalimov is entirely believ
able and almost unbearably adorable. In one heartbreaking scene, he tries to call up his dead
grandmother from the bathtub, using the showerhead as a phone, and gives up in tears. This
little boy's charming presence is enough to carry the film.
"Kolya" is only peripherally political. Louka's mother refuses to have Kolya in her house be
cause he speaks the language of the occupying army; Louka is interrogated by a weaselly col
laborative police agent; Russian tanks rumble through the streets at all hours. Hut the amaz
ing political transformation that became the Velvet Revolution and overthrew Communism
in the Czech Republic is secondary to the personal transformation of a crusty old bachelor by
a round-cheeked, dark-eyed, curious little boy.
"Kolya" is a warming testament to how milestones in people's personal lives can be even
more significant than the world-changing events around them.
