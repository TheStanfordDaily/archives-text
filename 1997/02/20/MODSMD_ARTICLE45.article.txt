# Dante's Peak

### 
Do you feel like it's been too long since you experienced the
wild fury of "Twister"? Do you feel nostalgic for the day you
were immersed in the special effects of "Independence Day"? If
your answer to either question is yes, you'll be glad to know that
the latest visual effects spectacular, "Dante's Peak," has explod
ed onto screens nationwide.
This disaster movie takes place in the sleepy, northern Cas
cades town of Dante's Peak. The town has just been ranked as
the second best town in the United States to live in when U.S.
(ieological Survey scientist Harry Dalton (Fierce Brosnan) ar
rives on the scene. Although he is only there for a routine inves
tigation of some seismic activity around the dormant volcano,
it doesn't take long before Dalton realizes that the town might
soon have to do battle with one of the most terrifying forces in
nature.
Harry's boss at the Geological Survey prohibits him from
warning the townspeople about the imminent danger, insisting
that rock-solid evidence be found before they risk ruining the
town financially by scaring tourists away. Rachel Wando (Linda
Hamilton), the town mayor and local coffee-shop owner, is

torn between following Dalton's advice and hoping for the best
Unfortunately, when the volcano erupts the town is unpre
pared. Chaos breaks out as people desperately try to flee town
At last the visual effects crew goes to work, showing bridges col

lapsing, buildings crumbling, rocks falling
out the sky and cars floating downriver.
While the special effects are breathtak
ing, nothing else in this movie achieves the
same effect. When it comes to the story, the
plot seems pieced together from fragments
of "Twister" (the obsessed scientists), "In
dependence Day" (the destruction) and
"Phenomenon" (the single-parent ro
mance). The characters are as uninspired
as the plot: There is the distressed single
woman with two kids, the old-fashioned
grandma, the boss who's got it all wrong,
the sleazy developer, the hero who is fight
ing to save thousands of lives against all
odds and, finally, the cute dog.
"Dante's Peak" is not a bad movie if you

haven't had enough of action movies that rely entirely on visu
al effects. But if you want to see an original story with engaging
acting, you'll have to look elsewhere.
