# Blood and Wine
## 
### 
Let me save you $7 with a terse plot synopsis: Greedy and corrupt Miami wine-mer
chant bungles diamond-smuggling deal and alienates wife, stepson and mistress. Now
watch me break it down. . . .
"Blood and Wine" is the final film in director Bob Rafelson's trilogy that began with

"Five Easy Pieces," fol
lowed by "The King of
Marvin Gardens." Aside
from Jack Nicholson's
starring role in each, 1
can't find any obvious
tie that binds the three
films.
Speaking of Jack,
his character in "Blood
and Wine," Alex Gates,
is the emblematic
Nicholson role. Macho
Alex hardly cherishes
his marriage to his wife,
Suzanne (Judy Davis)
— he works late nights
and spends long week
ends with his sexy Lati
na mistress, Gabriella
(Jennifer Lopez). When

he's not driving his red con
vertible BMW around Miami
with Gabriella, he's mocking
his stepson, Jason (Stephen
Dorff), or arranging jewelry
heists with pal and veteran
safe-cracker, Victor Spansky
(Michael Caine).
The supporting roles make
up for some of Gates' shallow
ness. A favorite scene of mine
depicts fed-up Suzanne having

her way with a baton-like object and Alex's face. This episode leaves you with a real sense
of vindication and was accompanied by ardent shouts of encouragement from theater
goers, including myself.
As lason, Dorff offers a tempering performance in light of Nicholson's one-sided,
hot-headed character. Dorff manages to explore realistically the range of emotion and
options one might have upon the discovery of a million-dollar piece of jewelry in one's
suitcase. Fortunately, the film doesn't exploit the relationship between Gabriella and
Jason, and they remain disgruntled acquaintances.
"Blood and Wine" asks the centuries-old moral question of what to do with free loot
and answers it quite realistically. 1 he film paints some interesting character sketches in
a brtathtaking sttting but tails to give its leading role any depth. If you're a dirty rotten
scoundrel in training, however, Nicholson's Alex Gates makes a great mentor.
