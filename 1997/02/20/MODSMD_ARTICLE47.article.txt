"subUrbia," the latest epic from Richard
Linklater ("Slacker," "Dazed and Confused")
asks the question that will probably puzzle so
ciologists well into the next century: Why did
so many upper and middle class white
teenagers in the 1990s decide to systematically
pursue a life of misery and ennui?
Unfortunately, but understandably, "sub-
Urbia" is unable to shed light on the issue.
The film tells the story of a group of
teenagers and 20-somethings who meet in the
parking lot of a convenience store for an awk
ward reunion with their friend Pony (played
amusingly by Jayce Bartok), who has escaped
the fictional town of Burnfield by becoming a
pretentious rock star.
Eric Bogosian's script effortlessly captures
the rhythm of teen-age speech without ever
sinking to parody. For instance, none of the
characters can finish a sentence without the use
of phrases such as "like" or "you know,"and yet
the language never sounds ridiculous. Al

though the characters are clearly a carefully se
lected group of teen-age stereotypes, almost all
are allowed to develop into full personalities.
The most compelling character is Jeff (Gio
vanni Ribisi), a smart and cynical college
dropout so consumed by his sarcasm that he
can't do anything with his life except sneer at it.
Ribisi animates the character with just the
right mix of manic energy and self-loathing.
The scene in which Jeff talks with Pony while
chewing furiously on the drawstring of his
sweatshirt is agonizing.
On the opposite end of the spectrum is Buff
(Steve Zahn), a green-haired pizza delivery
man who is basically the distilled essence of a
college fraternity. Zahn plays the character as a
displaced id, a "post-modern idiot savant"
who ultimately succeeds on the basis of sheer
force of will.
Unfortunately, the female characters don't
receive the same development. Sooze (Amie
Carey), a performance artist who longs to es

cape to New York, only occasionally rises
above ridiculousness. Bee-Bee (Diana Spy
bey), a nurse's assistant just out of rehab, is
pretty much negligible and Erica (Parker
Posey), Pony's press agent, is just plain silly.
Linklater's directing works on and off. On
one hand, he does an excellent job of capturing
the teen-agers in all of their fierce futility. As
they strut and fret in the convenience store
parking lot, the camera follows each aimless
stride, each apathetic shrug. However, his at
tempts to extend the action beyond the park
ing lot often fail, and the montages which
bookend the movie are embarrassingly blunt.
In the last 20 minutes or so, "subUrbia" be
comes almost intolerably preachy as the wise
Pakistani owner of the convenience store be
rates the teenagers for their shiftless lifestyle.
What is ultimately frustrating about the movie
is that it can't begin to answer its concluding
question: "What's wrong with you people?"
