# Fools Rush In
## 
### 
We've seen this before. The title, origi
nating from the lyrics of an Elvis tune,
"Wise men say only fools rush in, but I
can't help falling in love with you" sums up
the story of Alex Whitman (Matthew
Ferry); a wise-cracking corporate-type
from Manhattan, and Isabel Fuentes
(Salma Hayek, the sultry goddess of "Des
perado"), a beautiful Chicana cocktail
waitress.
Alex and Isabel meet and share one night
of passion, after which they both return to
their respective lives. When they run into
each other three months later, however, Is
abel is pregnant. She tells Alex the truth
with the resolution that they will go their
separate ways again. All goes according to
plan until Alex suddenly decides that Isabel
is the woman he has waited all his life for.
The movie unfolds from there with the
couple's funny, difficult, romantic attempts
at merging two very different lives.
"Fools Rush In" is the classic boy-meets

girl story, which could have taken off had
there been some sort of chemistry between
Perry and Hayek. Ferry's characteristic dry
wit rolls off his tongue, and his droll faces
and odd gestures are as funny as they are on
"Friends." But that's the problem. Ferry

can't break out of the Chandler role, so
even in "steamy" love scenes, he seems as if
he'll break into a joke at any second. Hayek,
on the other hand, oozes with sensuality in
every scene but lacks comic timing. In a
crucial moment for her character, when she

should have drawn out each word to
nify her rage, she instead rushes throug
the lines as if reciting them.
Despite these problems, some sort of be
lievability in Alex and Isabel's relationshi
could have made me root for them, but ni
such luck. For those who appreciate th
crooning voice of Chris Isaak, the song "
Wonder" from his new album, "Baja Ses
sions," sweeps through a scene, exudin
more genuine emotion than the actors eve
portray. Perry and Hayek aren't completel
to blame, though. For the most part, th
lines lack originality. 1 felt sorry for Perr
when he had to utter the classic Hollywooi
line, "I love you so much it hurts."
Overall, "Fools Rush In" still proves en
tertaining, with some definitely humorou
scenes mixed in with cute, mushy, coupl
shots. For an confirmed believer in predes
tined love, it is definitely worth seeing . .
