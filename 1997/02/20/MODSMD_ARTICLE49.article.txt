## Sex, needles and videotape 
### 
Hollywood has always had a
predilection for the dark side of
human nature, for troubled souls
and tortured psyches. This love of
the risky, the illegal and the dis
turbed has led to a lone history of

needle-packed flicks that cinema
tize heroin use and its accompany
ing trials. These films have looked
at addiction from many different
stylistic viewpoints but with a star
tling amount of honesty — they're
definitely not for the squeamish.
Newly released on video is the
Scottish import "Trainspotting,"
which brings an irreverent humor,

a popular soundtrack, Ewan Mc-
Gregor and the stylish directing of Danny
Boyle ("Shallow Grave") to the nasty issue
of heroin addiction. The early controversy
over "Trainspotting" involved criticism
that the movie made heroin sound too ap
pealing to impressionable audiences. De
spite the humor and the fact that one of
the first lines regarding the drug is: " lake
the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply
it by 1,000, and you're still nowhere near
it,"the film does not come close to paint
ing a pretty picture of life as an addict. It
thoroughly emphasizes the dark side of
heroin dependence, hitting on overdose,
betrayal, AIDS, depression, death and so

forth — not exactly a pro-smack view
point.
Gus Van Sant's 1989 flick "Drugstore
Cowboy" takes a less frenetic approach
than "Trainspotting" and moves the
junkies from contemporary Scotland to

-1970s Portland. The film centers on a cou
ple (Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch play the
absurdly attractive brand of addict) who
rob pharmacies for a living, shooting up
along the way. "Cowboy" is notable for its
strong performances and is definitely
worth checking out if you're in the mood
for a serious drama.
Another look at heroin from a couple's
viewpoint is the graphic "Sid and Nancy"
(1986), a depiction of the destructive rela
tionship between the Sex Pistols' Sid Vi
cious (played by Gary Oldman) and his
girlfriend (played by Chloe Webb). The
performances are intense and emotionally
raw, and the biographical nature of this
complex relationship is absorbing, al
though the drug abuse and violence are
fairly explicit.
A more esoteric example is the 1987
Australian release "Dogs in Space," which
features INXS singer Michael Hutchence
as head of an ensemble cast. A large group
of Melbourne teens wander in and out of
each others' lives as they dabble in punk,
sex and various drugs. This film finds a lot

of humor in its hapless, wannabe rockers,
and takes a less disapproving stance on
drug use, although ultimately finding it
tragic. It's sort of a darker, hardcore ver
sion of "Dazed and Confused."
Finally, "Rush" (1991) is the story of
two narcs (Jason Patric and Jen
nifer Jason I.eigh) who go under

cover to catch drug dealers but end up be
coming junkies themselves. The cameo of
Greg Allman as a menacing dealer makes
this film noteworthy beyond its pre
dictable plot. So, if you loved "Trainspot
ting" and you're in the mood for more, the
video store can be a drug movie heaven.
