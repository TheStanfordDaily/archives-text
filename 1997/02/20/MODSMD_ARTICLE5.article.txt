## Survey says grads are well paid and find preparation useful 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
A recent research probe conducted by the Graduate
School of Business found that the overwhelming minor
ity of alumni from its MBA program are satisfied with
their careers and in good financial health.
The median annual compensation range ef the alum
ni in the inquiry pool was $150,000 to $200,000.
Of the 4,000 graduates surveyed, 2,440 completed
and returned the questionnaire which was mailed to
graduated classes between 1965 and 1989. Janet Zich,
the Business School's associate news director said the
survey "had a fantastic return rate."
Of the respondents, nearly three-quarters found
that the MBA program prepared them exceptionally
well for their careers, while two-thirds of the respon
dents rated it as "very good" or "excellent" in terms of
preparation for their first jobs.
Only 2 percent reported that their MBA experience
was poor preparation for their first job, and 1 percent
said that it prepared them poorly for their entire ca
reers.
Zich said the Business School more or less anticipat-
Ed the results of thesurvey. "I don't
think there were any surprises in
it," she said.
In addition to listing major career
moves on the survey, graduates
were asked to provide information
about each position held, specifically
the nature of the industry, size of
the organization, ending salary and
reason for leaving. "It represents a
lot of trends," said Zich.
One trend revealed by the sur
vey is the turnover rate in the early
years of a graduate's career.
Among respondents, a quarter left
their first jobs by the end of their
second year and 40 percent by the
fifth year.
"They don't only switch jobs,
they switch industries," said Zich.
Over half the respondents changed
industries with their second job.
