"I don't smoke
don't drink
don't fuck
At least I can fucking think."
— "Out of Step"
Minor Threat, 1981
There's nothing new or revolutionary
about getting drunk. Everyone does it, from
skid row bums up through the CEOs of For
tune 500 companies. The corporations that
manufacture alcohol are some of the biggest
ones in existence, regularly donating mil
lions to politicians of every ideological
stripe. In a lot of ways, drinking is just about
one of the most conformist things you can
do.
Today's youth movements, whether they
call themselves ravers, punks or deadheads,
claim to represent freedom from society's
confining rules and regulations. It's funny,
though, how much this so-called "freedom"
ends up depending on alcohol or drugs —
substances that, for many of their users, may
end up becoming bigger prisons than the
ones they supposedly represent escape from.
When you get high, are you "freeing your
mind" or just sitting in your room staring at
the ceiling?
Straight edge, or sXe for short, began in
the early 1980s as a reaction to this ironic sit
uation. In songs like "Out of Step," early
straight edge bands like Minor Threat, SOA

and Seven Seconds espoused a form of rebel
lion that took the energy otherwise swal
lowed by alcohol and drugs and turned it to
wards making positive change in society.
Through their music they attacked the way
rebellion is used to sell booze and cigarettes,
the way that liquor is used to keep the poor
down, the way people use mind-altering
substances to make themselves feel smarter
or tougher or funnier.
Straight edge has changed a lot since those
days. Later bands like Gorilla Biscuits and
Youth Of Today made vegetarianism part of
the credo. In the hands of some of today's
bands, like Earth Crisis, sXe has even become
an intolerant pseudo-religion — rigid, vio
lent and judgmental. Unfortunately, this is
what most people think of when they hear
the phrase "straight edge."
But it's always been and still is a lot more
than that. From the very beginning, Minor
Threat singer lan MacKaye said that his deci
sion not to drink or do drugs was personal,
not a set of rules or "us vs. them." At its roots,
sXe remains this personal choice. It doesn't
matter what kind of music you like or what
political views you hold. Being straight edge
doesn't mean that you can't have friends who
drink. It doesn't mean punching people out
for smoking cigarettes. It's a personal deci
sion to make yourself aware that alcohol and
drugs are really among society's most potent
and most harmful ways of keeping us in line.
