When people find out I'm sXe (straight
edge), they always say "Wow, that's cool — 1
totally respect that."
I don't really see why.
I'm thinking, what is it about me that you
respect? It can't be my choice that you respect
— you made a different one. And you can't
think you are wrong. If you did, you wouldn't
think what you think You can't agree with me
because I make choices differently than you
do. In fact, you have to think I am stupid. If you
thought I was smart then you would expect me
to make the same choice you did, since you are
smart. Do you respect stupid people?
You're probably going to try to say other
wise, that you don't think I'm stupid, you just
respect my right to decide for myself. We've all
heard that perspective too many times —
"everyone is entided to an opinion." By think
ing that, you are denying yourself the right to
have the opinion that my opinion is wrong or
that I don't actually have any right to an opin
ion. So really, contrary to what we're all taught,
you can only think there is one right opinion
— your opinion. You can't think otherwise
and if you do, you haven't really used your
brain to think through the mind-garbage you
hear on the radio.
So because you respect me but you disagree
with my decision, you probably think I have
some deep philosophical reason. You probably

think I have some moral argument that drugs
are wrong, and gosh, you're impressed by me
sticking to it in the face of temptation. Well,
unlike you, I don't find anything important or
sacred about my body. I'm a bunch of mole
cules, and drugs would just be a few more mol
ecules. And actually, the only part oflife I think
is interesting is experience. So maybe that's
what those few more molecules would do for
me.
But then I'd be you.
Except I'm not you. I'm not some left-over
long-haired facial-hair-growing EBF hippie. I
didn't just get new Airwalk Ones from A 1
John's. I don't play guitar. I don't think the Adi
das flower is a pot leaf I don't go clubbing. I
don't find swearing impressive. I don't make
myself numb because I hate feeling so much. I
don't pretend to like you when I don't I don't
think the corporate world is evil. I don't think
I look cool sucking in.
I don't think it's a mistake for me to think
that the only reason I'm cool is my very large
pants and three striped sleeves. I don't think
I'm deep. My favorite aspect of myself is my su
perficiality. But since you steal my fashion and
insist you're cool for deeper reasons, I have to
find something else superficial to differentiate
us. So since you are not, I am sXe. Let's see you
follow me there.
You can keep your respect to yourself.
