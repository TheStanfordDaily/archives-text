Court rules on abortion clinic protesting
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court bolstered the
free-speech rights of protesters outside abortion clinics yesterday,
ruling they can confront patients on public sidewalks as long as
they stay at least 15 feet away from clinic entrances.
The court did not strip abortion clinics and patients of the con
siderable protection granted in recent years against violence and
intimidation. But the justices said a federal judge went too far in
restricting anti-abortion demonstrators in the Buffalo and
Rochester, N.Y. areas.
The judge in New York had ordered protesters to stay 15 feet
away from any clinic patient or staff member, no matter where
they were. But the justices voted 8-1 that such "floating buffer
zones" violate rights guaranteed by the Constitution's First
Amendment.
"They burden more speech than is necessary," Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
By a separate 6-3 vote, the court upheld a "fixed buffer zone"
that keeps demonstrators at least 15 feet away from clinic doors
and driveways.
The court, also by a 6-3 vote, upheld that portion of U.S. Dis
trict Judge Richard Arcara's order requiring so-called sidewalk
counselors who approach patients within the fixed buffer zones to
retreat when patients indicate a desire not to be counseled.
But no such duty to retreat exists outside the 15-foot fixed
buffer, the court said. Rehnquist's opinion discounted "any gen
eralized right to be left alone on a public street or sidewalk."
Albright to meet with Russians
LONDON (AP) — Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is tak
ing a package of conciliatory proposals to Moscow that includes a
unilateral reduction in NATO weapons ceilings.
Albright said yesterday she hopes to persuade President Boris
Yeltsin and other Kremlin leaders that spreading the military
alliance to Russia's western border over the next two years would
improve stability in Europe.
Her mission is also psychological. With former Soviet allies
likely to join NATO over the next two years, Albright is repeated
ly emphasizing American and European respect for the newly
democratic Russia and describing its apprehensions about NATO
as "old think."
After talks in Russia on today and tomorrow, Albright was due
to go on to South Korea and Japan next weekend and then to
China on Monday and Tuesday. But with China mourning the
death of Deng Xiaoping, she said she was putting her schedule on
hold until she heard from Beijing.
"It would obviously be a great advantage to the Chinese, as well
as all of us, if there were a smooth transition," Albright said of
China's change in leadership.
Albright said Deng's legacy would be a mixed one: economic
development but also the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. She also praised China for
its recent help in stemming the spread of nuclear weapons tech
nology.
