When I was little in the Midwest, we used to have tornado drills dur
ing the spring. If we were in a classroom, we were supposed to go
into the hallway and sit on the floor in a row, facing the wall, legs
crossed, head ducked, arms bent over our heads If we were outside
— at recess or in gym class — we were supposed to go into the dip
ping slope of a large hill that we sledded down in the winter. We
would run from the track to the hill and then sprawl out, our faces
mashed against the grass. We weren't allowed to talk. The world
seemed to me then an absurd and dangerous place, and I believed
that I would always be waiting for things, which, in a way, was not
wrong. When you were a kid, what things did you already know that
other people tried to talk you out of? Send your classies to diver
