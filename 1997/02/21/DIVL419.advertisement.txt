Who is Gerhard's Gay Tutor?
Zak, I'm sorry for being such a stub
born blowhard. I was wrong and you
were right. Please speak to me
because I feel so lonesome without
you. All my love, Bill
Some cliches which have recently
been borne out in my own life: 1)
The grass is always greener on the
other side. 2) Blood is thicker than
water. 3) Everything is relative.
A cliche which I still don't buy: Peo
ple are about as happy as they make
up their minds to be,
Is that a cookie in your pocket or arc
you excited to see me?
Elizabeth, you are my Valentine.
