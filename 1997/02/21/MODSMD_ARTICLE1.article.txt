## Increasing undergraduate population may prompt changes for graduates in co-ops

University Housing and Resi
dential Education officials are
considering adjusting housing sit
uations in order to provide for an
increased number of undergradu
ate students next fall.
According to Keith Guy, direc
tor of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, an additional 44 undergrad
uates will be enrolled this fall in
order to meet the undergraduate
enrollment target.
"We're doing an analysis of un
dergraduate space to set some lim
its on how many unguaranteed
students we'll be able to house,"
Guy said. "The bottom line is we
have new undergraduates coming
in, and we have a policy obligation
to.. . make sure they receive their
fair number of years of guaran
teed housing."
According to Dean of Admis
sions and Financial Aid James
Montoya, the increased number of
undergraduates will not affect the
number of freshmen admitted.
However, "it may have an im
pact on the number of transfer
students we bring in,"he said.
Montoya added that about
1,615 freshman will be admitted
this year, comparable to last
year's 1,614.
Guy said one option under con
sideration to provide increased
undergraduate housing is to re
duce the number of graduate stu
dents living in undergraduate
housing.
"It's clear that if we have grad
uate students occupying under
graduate housing and we have a
need for more undergraduate
housing, there has to be an assess
ment of how we can manage that
. .. without doing serious harm to
the [Res Ed] programs," he said.
Res Ed and student housing of
ficials met Wednesday night with
house managers and resident as
sistants from the seven coopera
tive houses in one of their periodic
council meetings to discuss hous
ing issues, including the issue of
graduate student residents in co
ops.
"Student leaders in the co-ops

were asked to evaluate the impor
tance of graduate students as a
part of their communities and to
see if there are ways that the num
ber of graduate spaces in the un
dergraduate housing can be re
duced without hurting the pro
gram," Guy said.
According to Rodger Whitney,
associate director of student hous
ing, some 34 spaces in the co-ops
— traditionally undergraduate
residences — are occupied by
graduate students.
"There has been a decline of
graduate student interest the past
few years in the 34 to 35 spaces we
allocate [to them]," Whitney said.
"So we were basically talking
about what the number is of grad
uate students in co-ops that would
meet the demands and programs
in those houses."
The changes will not affect co
terminal students unless they
have used all their years of guar
anteed housing, according to
Guy.
"I do not believe there would
be any decision made to not allow
coterms to live in undergraduate
housing as long as they have
guaranteed years left," Guy said.
"The guaranteed years is the dri
ver."
Whitney said it is likely that a
higher number of unguaranteed
students will not get housing.
"Also, some students are in stu
dent positions where they are
given a fifth year guaranteed be
cause they may have a [staff posi
tion in the house]. That's a situa
tion we're going to have to ex
plore, too," he added.
Another option is to convert
some spaces in residences into stu
dent rooms, according to Whitney.
But Whitney said moving un
dergraduates into graduate hous
ing is not an option.
"We're not considering taking
away graduate housing spaces
from graduate students," Whit-
"Escondido Village is de
signed for graduates, so we
wouldn't just take undergradu
ates and put them there."
Housing officials will meet next
week to discuss the changes to be
made.
