# Zip-zoid asteroid
## Symposium focuses on impacts of asteroids 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Stanford students have yet an
other excuse not to get up in the
morning: the threat of a campus
sized meteor smashing into the
Earth.
Last night's symposium in
Kresge Auditorium, titled "The
Threat of Cosmic Impacts," ad
dressed this danger.
Members of the panel included
Norman Sleep, a geophysics pro
fessor; David Morrison, director of
space at NASA Ames Research
Center and chair of the 1991 con
gressional study of earth-crossing
objects; and Seth Shostack, a mem
ber of the group Search for Extra-
Terrestrial Intelligence, who mod
erated the symposium.
Shostack began by stressing the
significance of asteroid impacts.
"An impact would more than
ruin this symposium â€” it would
ruin your day," Shostack said.
"This burg would no longer be part
of the greater Bay Area; it would
become part of the 'Crater Bay
Area.' "
Sleep further expounded upon
the prospect of a meteoric disaster.
"The only thing we know that
could have wiped out all or most of
life on the earth millions of years
ago were catastrophic impacts,"
Sleep said.
Sleep noted that the size of the
meteor determines its threat to the
earth's environment.
A meteor 10 to 20 kilometers in
diameter would blast enough dust

into the atmosphere to shut down
all photosynthetic activity on earth
for 25 years, allowing only non
photosynthetic organisms, such as
bacteria and viruses, to live. A cos
mic projectile 400 kilometers in di
ameter would completely boil the
entire ocean, forming an extremely
high-temperature "pressure cook
er." In this environment, only the
most sub-surface thermophilic or
ganisms would survive.
Around 16 such impacts have
hit the earth since its formation, so
some form of life has survived the
catastrophes, Sleep said.
Despite the rarity of meteoric
impacts on earth, the effects of
such events would be so severe that
meteors rank with earthquakes
and tornadoes in probability of
danger per person.
"No known natural hazard
poses as great a threat as asteroid
impacts," Morrison said.
However, unlike earthquakes
or other natural disasters, Earth
can defend itself against an aster
oid.
"In earthquakes, tectonic plates
are going to slide past each other no
matter what," Morrison said. "It's
the same with tornadoes and volca
noes. But we can protect ourselves
from impacts."
Possible methods of defense,
Morrison said, include a well
placed nuclear warhead. If explod
ed near an asteroid, such a war
head could impart enough force to
change its velocity a single cen
timeter per second, causing it to
miss Earth entirely.
