An Indian woman grieves yesterday after finding her son among the dead at a makeshift morgue
set up after a mudslide swept over the Andean villages of Pumaranra and Ccocha, some 480 kms
southeast of Lima, on Feb. 18. Nearly 50 people have been reported dead and up to 200 bodies are
still buried under mud and rocks.
