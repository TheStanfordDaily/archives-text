# Florida killing: confirms fears
## Concerned Californians forced suspect to leave state 
### 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) â€” A neighbor walked over to
Lawrence Singleton's door and saw pretty much
what Californians feared 10 years ago when they
drove Singleton out of town: There was Singleton,
his face and chest covered with blood, a naked
woman dead on the living room floor.
Singleton, 69, was arrested on murder charges
Wednesday, a decade after being released from a
California prison for raping a teen-age hitchhiker
and hacking her forearms off with an ax.
Back in California, people responded with a col
lective I-told-you-so. In Florida, officials said they
were angry that Singleton was out on their streets
but said there was little they could have done to
monitor him.
"It's a sad commentary on our criminal justice
system that a person of this notoriety who has com
mitted a crime this heinous is out on the streets,"
Lt. David Gee said.
Singleton had registered as a felon when he
moved to Tampa in 1988 and had been arrested
three times on shoplifting charges. But keeping
watch over him would have been difficult, Gee said.
Singleton was paroled in 1987 after serving near
ly 8 1/2 years of a 14-year sentence for the rape and
dismemberment. His sentence had been reduced by
good behavior and a law to relieve prison overcrowd
ing. At the time, California officials said that under
the law, they had little choice but to release him.
He retreated to his home state of Florida after
being driven from several Northern California com
munities where residents were angry and fearful
about his release. After his arrival in Florida, neigh
bors protested and a car dealer offered him $5,000 to

leave the state.
Nancy Fahden, who was a Contra Costa County,
Calif., supervisor when a mob of 500 people in the
small town of Rodeo forced Singleton to leave,
wasn't surprised by his arrest.
"It's as if someday, somewhere, I was expecting
something," Fahden said. "I don't think he should
ever have been let out of jail."
Police said 31-year-old Roxanne Hayes apparent
ly died Wednesday of stab wounds to the upper body.
She had a string of prostitution arrests, dating from
1986 through last month, but Gee said her relation
ship with Singleton was unclear.
The woman's family "is mad at the man who did
it, and the man who saw it and didn't stop it," said
11-year-old Theo Robertson, a nephew of Hayes.
"We are all broken up and crying."
Singleton was arrested after a painter who had
been doing work inside the house arrived there and
heard a commotion inside. He opened the door and
saw a naked Singleton struggling with the nude
woman, who was crying out for help.
"I think he was strangling her," the painter, Paul
Hitson told WFTS-TV. "He told her to shut up and
then hit her with his fist. I would have done some
thing, but I was scared."
Instead, the man backed away and called 911. A
sheriffs deputy went to Singleton's home with a
neighbor. When Singleton answered his door, his
chest and face were bloody. The officer saw a per
son's foot on the floor.
"They framed me the first time, but this time I
did it," Singleton said as he left a police station with
his hands cuffed behind his back.
