More study of marijuana needed
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — Sparse but promising evidence indicates
smoking marijuana may ease the suffering of some seriously ill patients,
but more study is needed before the drug's medical value is understood,
a panel of experts said yesterday.
At a news conference interrupted repeatedly by pro-marijuana
demonstrators, the experts assembled by the National Institutes of
Health spoke of intriguing hints that marijuana smoking helps some
patients with cancer, AIDS or glaucoma. But they cautioned there is lit
tle hard scientific evidence.
"For at least some [medical uses], it looks promising enough that
there should be some new controlled studies," said William T. Beaver, a
professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University School of

Medicine and the panel's chairman.
Although a final committee report is not complete, "the general mood
was that for some indications, there is a rationale for looking further
into the therapeutic effects of marijuana," Beaver said.
Yesterday's news conference was interrupted four times by ACT UP,
the AIDS activist group, and members of the Marijuana Policy Project.
In shouted accusations, the demonstrators accused the panel of using a
"stall tactic" to block marijuana research and of ignoring existing
research.
New company to peddle junk e-mail
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — It's about to get much easier for advertis
ers to send junk e-mail on the Internet.

Cyber Promotions Inc. will launch the first bulk e-mail-friendly
Internet provider in the nation on March 17. It will allow computer
users to send millions of commercial ads — also known as spam — for a
single monthly fee.
Nearly all Internet providers now prohibit customers from sending
unsolicited bulk e-mail and will cancel a person's account if they are
caught.
The new bulk e-mail friendly network begins with local dial-up num
bers in the Philadelphia area and 800 numbers for use around the coun
try. Customers will pay about $50 a month to send unlimited amounts
of mass unsolicited commercial e-mails.
Critics complain such junk e-mail costs recipients money to transmit,
store and read, unlike regular junk mail or phone sales that only use up
a recipient's time.
