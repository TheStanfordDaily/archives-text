## Editorial Combating assault 
### 
More needs to be done
to ensure that victims
report sexual assault

SINCE ITS INCEPTION in
1991, the Campus Sexual
Assault Response and Recov
ery Team has been working dili
gently to increase its presence on
campus and to raise awareness
regarding issues of sexual assault.
During the last five years, the
team has succeeded in achieving
some of its goals. Most important,
the number of calls to the response
team has been increasing steadily
since its creation.
In fact, more than half of the
students involved in some form of
sexual assault have talked to
somebody, according to Alejandro
Martinez, the director of Counsel
ing and Psychological Services at
Cowell Student Health Center.
There are several reasons to
applaud the rise in the number of
sexual assault reports. In all likeli
hood, the success of the team's
efforts can be attributed to stu
dents' increased awareness of sex
ual assault, as well as more open
discussion of sexual harassment
and assault, fostered by Residen
tial Education.
Although it is encouraging to see
awareness rising among the stu
dent population and the number of
reported incidents increasing, esti
mates still leave an astounding one
of every two sexual assaults left
unreported.
The University should not be
satisfied with that status quo in its
effort to increase awareness. If
this program is expected to do
more good — which it's well pre
pared to do — then the team and
University must advertise the lit
tle known phone number (5-9955)
more aggressively — it must be
made as familiar to students as 9-
911 and 5-SURE.
Currently, the team is one of

only three official Stanford organi
zations with which students, fac
ulty and staff can be assured confi
dentiality regarding sexual assault
and harassment. The other two
are the Help Center for University
staff and the Office of Religious
Life. Also, Res Ed prepares its res
ident assistants for all sorts of per
sonal crises, and the new emergen
cy blue-light telephones with
direct connections to 911 opera
tors are available to anyone on
campus.
But the type of one-on-one pre
pared counseling available from
the team is important because it
provides victims with professional
and individualized treatment.
Undoubtedly, the team is an
invaluable resource. It is available
24 hours a day, seven days a week
with a staff of two female psychia
trists, a female clinical social
worker, several male psychologists
and other counselors who have
received additional training in sex
ual assault.
The team provides counseling
and coordinates other responses
and referrals. "If a student is not
feeling right about an event" o::
feels "either confusion about what
happened ... or emotional dis
tress," that is the time to call the
team, according to Martinez.
The team's staff also assists stu
dents with changing housing and
academic situations and connects
them with clergy.
While these efforts have accom
plished much, the community
must not forget about the large
number of unreported incidents of
sexual assault. C-SARRT and the
other University resources have
achieved a great deal, but unfortu
nately many assault victims are
left to cope with a traumatic inci
dent without counseling.
Students and administrators
alike must continue these efforts
by increasing awareness not only
of the existence of date-rape and
other forms of sexual assault but
of the resources that are there for
the victims.
