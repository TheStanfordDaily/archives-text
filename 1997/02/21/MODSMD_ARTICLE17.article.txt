Rejection of ROTC is rejection of U.S. government

I'VE FOLLOWED THE debate over
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps
with great interest over the past few
weeks and many of the opinions written
in The Daily have sharply jogged my
memory; in 1990 and 19911 represented
the pro-ROTC position in similar debates
while an undergraduate at Harvard. And
while the debate is probably moot in
terms of concrete Defense Department
action — the military won't rush to
establish a ROTC unit here — it is cer
tainly a relevant dialogue from which
both sides can learn. It's the type of
painful, uproarious debate in which Stan
ford students should be participating.
Six years ago I defended my position
vociferously (against all the shrieks and
spit), although I was clearly uninformed
in terms of true military life and, for
that matter, the compatibility of homo
sexuality and military service. As a sup
porter of homosexual rights, this was —
and is — a very tough issue. Now having
served for more than five years as an
infantry officer in the Marines, I feel
compelled to write.
My two cents will certainly be crum
pled up and trashed by many who choose
to read on, but I hope others find some
value here. Specifically, I want to address
two opinions published in The Daily
which, like so many of the arguments I
heard six years ago, are so steeped in
cowardice, hypocrisy and a fundamental
lack of understanding concerning the
military that they beg clarification.
I knew I was back in the ivory tower
when I read Susan Owen's Feb. 3 letter
and Jesse Oxfeld's Feb. 11 column, both of
which are vehemently anti-military, let
alone ROTC. But that's not the issue. The
problem is in their obvious misconception
of the military, which is as skewed as per

haps the most right-wing military mem
ber's view of homosexuals and their
capacity for service. Owen asserts that
current ROTC students should be taught
a lesson and "sent a message" which will
cause them to eventually change policy
when they have risen sufficiently in the
ranks. This is wrong on two counts.
First, the only enduring message sent
to these dedicated students by the Univer
sity is that they are not welcome. Second,
like so many people, she believes that the
military is setting policy here. The "don't
ask / don't tell" policy was drafted by the
Clinton administration. It is simply an
order given by the American people
through the government and which the
military must follow. Like so many things
in the military, we don't get a choice in
the matter. This debate is best directed at
the ranking leader in my chain of com
mand — the president — and Congress.
Further, Owen's critique that the
military will have to be dragged kicking
and screaming "into the light" is a
supercilious fallacy. If an order came
down tomorrow allowing homosexuals to
serve openly, the military would swiftly
comply. Period. And her assertion that
the military fought against integration
in the ranks must be juxtaposed with
both society's progress at the time and
the NAACP's 1991 comment that the
military was the "best integrated organi
zation in the United States." Certainly,
once given an order, the military does its
level best to carry it out.
Oxfeld — who ends his column with
the bizarre self-description that he
"comes from a long and proud tradition
of draft-dodging" — should count his
blessings that Stanford accepted him.
He's clearly smart, but I'm quite sure
Texas A&M wouldn't embrace his cow-

ardice quite so magnanimously. Nor
would most of America, for that matter.
Like anyone who discriminates
against people because they are mem
bers of a group, Oxfeld has "been condi
tioned to view the military negatively."
One must wonder where his grandpar
ents were in 1941. At least he is honest
in his disdain for the military; it eluci
dates his innate hypocrisy. Oxfeld — and
Stanford, for that matter — is happy to
receive Defense Department funds ($5O
million a year) but takes "a certain
amount of pride in attending a school
that doesn't welcome the armed forces."
Clearly the University does welcome
the armed forces with its voracious
appetite for research dollars. So if this is
truly a moral issue, and for most of the
quoted participants it most certainly is,
then why do those students who are
totally opposed to military involvement
at Stanford not leave? They are, simply
in their attendance, giving tacit consent
to a military which feeds Stanford nearly
a third of its yearly revenues. This is the
same military which discriminates
against homosexuals, remember.
The answer, I think, is that most stu
dents who want to see the policy
changed realize that the best way to do
so is to attend Stanford or another
school that accepts Defense Department
money. The others are simply ignoring
the Defense funds which support them
and hypocritically attack ROTC mem
bers, putting selfish motives — attend
ing a top school / finding a good job —
behind flimsy curtains called "morals."
If you're willing to attend a school
which gladly consumes military funds,
you should be equally receptive to your
classmates who are willing to make the
ultimate sacrifice in defense of the Con

stitution. Oxfeld says his mother offered
him a ride to Canada in the event of a
draft. To be fair, I think I'll offer him a
ride out of town if his morals ever over
come his motives.
The anti-ROTC position has moved
from an anti-Vietnam issue to one of
"gays in the military." The centrality of
both arguments at institutions like
Stanford really bothers me and it is this:
Students here believe they are smarter
and know better than do average Ameri
cans and thus our government. This
haughty belief — essentially that aver
age people are just too stupid and homo
phobic to realize that homosexuals
deserve open, equal footing in the mili
tary and that Stanford won't accept
what America legislates — is really the
salient issue here.
So I was proud to find that the young
Americans who serve, most of whom have
no college education, are better than we
are. They are, on the whole, more dedi
cated and are willing to endure without
complaint conditions and orders at which
you and I would balk. So for those who
think homosexuality in the military is a
black and white issue — as I did — let me
assure you that until you have been one
of 30 Marines relegated to a 30-foot-by
-15-foot berthing space in the bottom of a
ship in the Persian Gulf for six months
you simply cannot make that claim.
The homosexual policy will evolve
with society, of which the military is sim
ply an extension. To reject us is to reject
the United States and our democratic
government. Don't hurt your classmates
with a policy controlled solely by the
United States as a whole and not by the
ROTC students commuting to Berkeley.
