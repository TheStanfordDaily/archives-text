## Reflections on our bubbles 
### 
THE CHILD IS having a wonderful
time. His arms and legs are covered
with a soapy film. He blows into the
wand again and marvels momentarily at
the fruits of his own prolific lungs. Then he
chases the shower of bubbles, all extremi
ties flailing in a desperate attempt to keep
every last one in captivity — alive or dead.
It is amazing the entertainment humanity
has been able to derive from bubbles.
Soap's sanitary value takes a clear back
seat to its ability to metamorphose into
transparent floating orbs.
Stanford is not the real world. As I stand
watching him, these words echo through
my mind. Three people have proclaimed
this to me in these daylight hours alone:
What am I going to do when I have to go
out into the real world.'?
I feel like nothing I do here has any con
nection to the real world.
It is so good to get off campus, into the
real world.
Of course, I sometimes feel the same
way. The daffodils that mysteriously bloom
throughout the quad during key alumni
and admit months are probably on a differ
ent calendar than in other parts of the
country. The trees lining Palm Drive were
transplanted against their will. In terms of
flora and fauna, Stanford may very well be
a cut-and-pasted version of the real world.
For all we know even the raccoons are
imported.
There is more, of course, to this feeling

of disconnectedness. We are not earning
permanent salaries. We are not settled into
permanent jobs. We are fed and housed and
relatively safe. This level of comfort may
make Stanford seem in marked contrast to
the struggles we perceive to be waiting for
us upon graduation from Happy land.
But I cannot quite partake of the belief
that some entity somewhere waved a magic
wand and created a bubble surrounding
Stanford and separating it from the real
world. What is the real world? Palo Alto?
East Palo Alto? San Francisco? And if this
is not reality, what then defines the four or
so years I seem to be spending here? A hia
tus? A vacation? A lapse? A tesseract?
Bubbles seem empty. But they are made
of the same stuff as the world surrounding
them. I refuse to accept that the people I
know are entirely unrepresentative of
humanity in general. A job at the library
may provide for spending money, but it
does not get people out of here without
debts. Eating disorders and date rape, lone
liness and depression — if our definition of
the real world is somehow related to the
level of sadness and struggle inherent in
human existence, we've got it in here, too.
There is a lot going on beneath the
swirling surface. But that surface itself is
transparent. The question is not one of vis
ibility but of how closely we choose to look.
Human beings love bubbles. They are
our comfort zones. Perhaps, then, they
are not empty at all. It is, after all, our

breath which is ultimately responsible for
their creation. We construct our own per
ceptions of reality, and we always will.
When that reality seems superficial, we
can expand beyond it, looking more deeply
into the people we know or looking beyond
the transparent film.
When a narrowly perceived reality feels
stifling, reaching beyond it is always an
option. In that Stanford is a land of trans
planted trees, it is not the real world. But in
that Stanford is a community of individu
als, it is. The real world is comprised of
human beings. The extent to which we
understand one another and to which we
understand ourselves is the extent to which
we live in the real world. What is missing in
our interactions here will not readily dis
play itself any number of years from now.
Realities can only be imposed upon us if we
refuse to question them.
We all live in bubbles of some sort. Yet
though they are comfortable, bubbles are
flimsy and ephemeral. They are no
stronger than we build them. We are not
locked into a superficial world.
But we are the ones with the wands in
our hands.
