Garnering an endowment return rate 9
percent higher than the national average,
Stanford ranked fourth nationwide for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1996.
The University experienced a favorable
26.2 percent return rate — a figure much
higher than the national average of 17.2.
The value of the University endowment
is currently $3.8 billion, up from 17 percent
last year, according to Stanford's Annual
Financial Report. The $554 million increase
was due mainly to a record high of gifts to
the University and to the increased return
rate.

However, Stanford Management Com
pany CEO Lauranee Hoagland said num
bers can be deceiving.
"3.8 billion sounds like all the money in
the world, but it supports a lot lower per
centage of the budget compared to our
peers," he said, adding that University
President Gerhard Casper has personally
been involved in increasing endowment
value.
"President Casper is trying to raise $200
million for graduate fellowships so that we
can continue to have graduate students that
we might otherwise lose because of the de
clining federal support of research,"
