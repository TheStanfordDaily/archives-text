# Endowment return level climbs to 26%
## 
### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
Garnering an endowment return rate 9
percent higher than the national average,
Stanford ranked fourth nationwide for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1996.
The University experienced a favorable
26.2 percent return rate — a figure much
higher than the national average of 17.2.
The value of the University endowment
is currently $3.8 billion, up from 17 percent
last year, according to Stanford's Annual
Financial Report. The $554 million increase
was due mainly to a record high of gifts to
the University and to the increased return
rate.

However, Stanford Management Com
pany CEO Lauranee Hoagland said num
bers can be deceiving.
"3.8 billion sounds like all the money in
the world, but it supports a lot lower per
centage of the budget compared to our
peers," he said, adding that University
President Gerhard Casper has personally
been involved in increasing endowment
value.
"President Casper is trying to raise $200
million for graduate fellowships so that we
can continue to have graduate students that
we might otherwise lose because of the de
clining federal support of research,"

Hoagland said.
Possessing a "more diversified
allocation" of funds than is typical
for other schools, Stanford's en
dowment is divided so that 30 per
cent is invested in domestic stocks,
23 percent in international stocks,
17 percent in alternative invest
ments, 16 percent in real estate eq
uity, 11 percent in domestic fixed
income and 3 percent in inflation
hedge. The first four classes, which

are equity type investments, are
given the most attention, according
to the financial report.
"The rationale is that equity type
investments have had the highest
returns ... and high exposure (is
given) to high returns," Hoagland
said. "I don't believe we have any
more risks than traditional portfo
lios" practiced by other colleges.
He added that the hope is for a 1-
percent higher return rate each
year; that would amount to a $38
million increase, according to this
year's figures.
The Stanford Management Co.
main job is "to find money man

agers who will do better than their
market," Hoagland said. "Then
we'll get strong returns."
During the last 10 years, Stan
ford has maintained a steadily in
creasing income, well exceeding the
6.25 percent of real return rate
needed to "maintain purchasing
power."
However, a fall in the market
could have devastating results, as
evidenced in past years.
"The 1970s were very difficult
for endowments. Faculty salaries
fell behind inflation," Hoagland
said. "I'm sure that all dimensions
of the University were feeling some

crunch at that period."
This year the 26.2 percent return
brought in more than $624 million,
most of which will return to the
fund for further investing. The en
dowment income that is not re
turned contributes to 12 percent of
Stanford's annual operating ex
penses and ranks as fourth among
the University's sources of funds.
For total endowment value,
Stanford placed below Harvard
University, the University of Texas
system, Yale University and
Princeton University, maintaining
a fifth-place ranking for the third
consecutive year.
