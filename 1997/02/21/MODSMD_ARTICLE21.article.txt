## Seniors' last weekend Women pummel hapless Cougars

Consider this a game a prelude
of bigger and greater things to
come.
Last night's 82-45 Stanford vic
tory over an eight-player Washing
ton State squad (8-14, 2-11 Pacific
10 Conference) was not so much
another routine win at home as it
was a tinkering session. The 5,719
fans at Maples Pavilion saw senior
forward Kate Starbird score 19
points in only 24 minutes of play,
leaving her 13 points short of the
career scoring record. Redshirt

subbed in for her two-sport team
mate Paula McNamee.
Folkl grabbed her first rebound
less than a minute later and was
able to work down low for three
first-half shots. The redshirt
sophomore finally connected when
she took a pass from Wideman on
the low block and laid it in for a 22-
