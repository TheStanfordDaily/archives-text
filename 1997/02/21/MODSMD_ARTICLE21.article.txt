## Seniors' last weekend Women pummel hapless Cougars 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Consider this a game a prelude
of bigger and greater things to
come.
Last night's 82-45 Stanford vic
tory over an eight-player Washing
ton State squad (8-14, 2-11 Pacific
10 Conference) was not so much
another routine win at home as it
was a tinkering session. The 5,719
fans at Maples Pavilion saw senior
forward Kate Starbird score 19
points in only 24 minutes of play,
leaving her 13 points short of the
career scoring record. Redshirt
sophomore Kristin Folkl returned
to a thunderous standing ovation
and posted two points and six
rebounds and three assists in 15
minutes of action for the third
ranked Cardinal (26-1, 14-0).
But most of all, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer was able to
use several different lineups, allow
ing five players to reach double fig
ures in points, includingjunior cen
ter Olympia Scott who chipped in
with 14 to go along with 11
rebounds. Senior point guard Jami
la Wideman was the sparkplug
early in the second half, helping

Stanford run to a 50-point half and
putting the game completely out of
reach.
"We have to continue to play
really well," VanDerveer said. "The
thing that I liked was just the
intensity Jamila brought for our
team defensively and especially the
second half. That to me was a real
key for this game but more so for
the big picture."
Stanford seemed to play down to
the Cougars' level early on as
turnovers and many missed shots
only gave the Cardinal a 16-6
advantage 10 minutes into the
game. Folkl finally made her long
awaited return with 8 minutes, 27
seconds to go in the half when she
subbed in for her two-sport team
mate Paula McNamee.
Folkl grabbed her first rebound
less than a minute later and was
able to work down low for three
first-half shots. The redshirt
sophomore finally connected when
she took a pass from Wideman on
the low block and laid it in for a 22-
6 lead with five minutes to go in the
half. Wideman closed the half with
her signature driving layups, drib
bling through the befuddled
Cougar defense and staking the
Cardinal to a 32-16 halftime lead.
Washington State was playing
like a befuddled squad, shooting an
atrocious 26 percent from the floor
and having almost as many
turnovers (15) as points. The sad
thing is, the Cougars were shooting
4-of-24 (a whopping 16.7 percent)
before making three field goals in a
row, including a three at the buzzer
by sophomore guard Jade Hyett.
"I thought we were playing good
defense in the first half," Van-
Derveer said. "They weren't shoot
ing well. I think people were just
... taking shots that maybe were a
little rushed, but I thought we
came out in the second half and
really played our kind of game. The
first half was a little disjointed, and
again I think it's a real credit to
people coming off the bench."
Finally seeing how dead in the
water the Cougars really were,
Stanford proceeded to run them
out of the building. A 13-2 run
capped off by a typically brilliant
Starbird layup made the score 47-
18. The senior forward knocked a
pass down and chased it the length
of the court, recovering it in front
of the Stanford bench before driv
ing the baseline and swooping in
for the score. Wideman added to
the highlight reel when she slipped
momentarily, maintained her bal

ance and the dribble, drove past her
defender and scored a spectacular
layup for a 54-26 lead with 13:11
left.
She joined Starbird on the
bench a minute later as Van-
Derveer began to empty the bench.
Freshman guard Christina Batasti
ni made the most of her time, scor
ing 13 points in 10 minutes. Fresh
man guards Milena Flores and
Melody Peterson took turns run
ning the point while Folkl began to
crash the boards more relentlessly,
providing great outlet passes to the
streaking Batastini.
"I think we're trying to make
the best of a bad situation," Van-
Derveer said. "In the meantime,
it's great to see Olympia stay out of
foul trouble and play well, Chandra
come in and do well, and I thought
Kristin did a great job for her first
game with all the hype and every
thing else. This was a nice opportu
nity to play some different people.
It was good to see Christina coming
in and scoring for us and running
the floor real well."
For the game, the Cardinal had
16 steals, including six by junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard. Red
shirt sophomore center Chandra
Benton bounced back from her
Oregon debacle to grab 10
rebounds, contributing to the dis
tinct 46-33 rebounding edge over
the small Cougar lineup. Stanford
showed last night it has the poten
tial to maintain their high level of
play regardless of who is in there.
"I think for any good team to be
great, the chemistry is the first

thing that has to be excellent,"
Wideman said. "In terms of the
way our team supports each other
and the contributions that people
make in practice, that has made it
easier to survive the injuries that
we've had. Hopefully that will
translate onto the floor with the
kind of cohesion I think we saw
spurts of tonight with all kinds of
different lineups out there."
With Washington State com
fortably out of the way, the focus
moves to Washington (13-9, 8-5),
who crushed California last night
in Harmon Gym 85-62. In their
previous meeting in Seattle, the
Huskies could not take advantage
of Stanford's ii\jury problems (the
team was down three starters),
jumping out to a nine-point lead
early before unraveling to a 90-64
defeat. The game, of course, also
marks Senior Night as Wideman,
Starbird, guard Charmin Smith
and forward Tar a Harrington play
their final regular-season game in
Maples.
The four have been a part of an
era that has seen the Cardinal
regain and maintain its rightful
place atop the conference standings
and in the Final Four (the team fin
ished second to USC their fresh
man year and returned to the Final
Four a year later). During their
years, Stanford has lost only four
conference games, all in their first
two seasons, while winning 106 out
of 119 games, a whopping .890 win
ning percentage. And through it all,
there has been the unwavering
support of the fans.
"It'll probably be pretty emo
tional" tomorrow, Starbird said.
"Maples has treated us well, and I
think even if we go on and play
more basketball, I think we always
really appreciated the fan support
we have here and I think we're def
initely going to miss it."
