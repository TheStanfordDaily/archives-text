# Folkl impresses in triumphant return
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
It had been 692 days since
she had donned a Cardinal uni
form, but redshirt sophomore
Kristin Folkl received a warm
welcome from the Maples Pavil
ion crowd of 5*719 in her season
debut as part of the third
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
The forward, who joined the
squad Monday to help cany the
burden left by a string of
injuries at the post, seemed a lit
tle shaky in her five first-half
minutes but came out strong in
the second half, grabbing
rebounds and dishing assists, as
the Card routed Washington

State 82-45.
"I thought Kristin did a great
job with it being her first game
and all the hype and everything
else," said head coach Tar a Van-
Derveer. "I want our team to
have a great year this year. [The
seniors were] one of the main
reasons why I called Kristin.
You have to have somebody to
help you on the boards and score
inside. We need our big kids
coming back, and this is giving
us a great shot."
Folkl's last appearance for
Stanford was in the national
semifinal game her freshman
year. Since then Foikl has con
centrated on volleyball. Last
season she was in San Diego train
ing with the national volleyball
team and earned a spot as the first
alternate on the Olympic squad
last summer. But the strain of
year-round competition took its
toll, and Folkl decided in October
not to play basketball this season.
Those plans changed last week
when VanDerveer came calling.
Stanford's injury situation
prompted the coach to call Folkl to
see if she would consider playing.
Folkl agreed, and the preseason
Ail-American candidate revived
her basketball career with a per
formance that included l-of-4
shooting, six rebounds and three
assists.
But perhaps more important
than any performance Folkl could
have posted is the break she pro
vided players like senior guard
Kate Starbird and junior center
Olympia Scott. Since the injury
plague began, Starbird has carried
more than her share of the load.
Starbird has played 140 minutes

more than any other player on the
season and at times been called
upon to provide most of Stanford's
offense.
Starbird and Scott are the
Card's only two players to start in
every game this year, and guards
Charmin Smith, a senior, and
Milena Flores, a freshman, are the
only other players to see time in
every contest. Three of Stanford's
regular starters have been side
lined at some point, and Scott has
played the last week under the
duress of a root canal that caused
her to miss several practices.
Currently the injury list has
claimed junior forwards Naomi
Mulitauaopele and Heather Owen,
while neither Scott nor junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard are at 100
percent.
Here'B where Folkl enters the
picture. With under nine minutes
remaining in the first half Folkl
headed toward the scorer's table
while taking off her warmup.
Instantly, the crowd began to
cheer. Folkl entered the game at
the 8 minute, 27 second mark and
inbounded the ball; the crowd
cheered. Less than 30 seconds
later Folkl blocked the shot of

junior forward Amy Saneholtz,
and the crowd cheered louder.
"I've had a lot of emotions run
ning around in my brain," Folkl
said. "It's been a pretty interesting
week. [The crowd's reaction]
makes me feel really good. The
Stanford crowd has always been
very receptive to all the players,
and I guess I'm just grateful that
they hadn't forgotten about me."
Folkl ended the half with two
points on l-of-3 shooting and had
just one board and no assists to
one turnover. But Folkl gained her
confidence in the second half,
grabbing five boards in 10 minutes
and making some of the most sen
sational passes of the game.
"It's great," senior point guard
Jamila Wideman said of having
Folkl back. "The first day of prac
tice she came back, I remember
what a lift she gave our team.
After the time she had taken off 1
was expecting a little rust.
"I don't think she missed a shot
in the practice, but what I was
really more impressed by and what
amazes me about Kristin is I think
she has a basketball brain. 1 mean
you look at the way she passes, you
look at the cuts she makes on the

floor — those kinds of talents and
skills arfc things you can't teach.
She can make the people around
her better, r.nd she also brings a
great attitude and effort and will
make a great contribution to our
team."
Wideman wasn't the only team
mate to show her support of Folkl.
During a Stanford free throw with
4:41 left to play, Mulitauaopele
and Owen managed to grab Folkl's
attention from the bench to let her
know she needed to make an
adjustment to her uniform. Folkl's
jersey was tucked in almost up to
the numbers and Mulitauaopele
and Owen signaled for Folkl to
pull it out. She obliged and after
she was properly dressed Folkl
gave a little hip-shake to her team
mates as a thank-you.
"This was my first true game in
two years so it was a little odd,"
Folkl said. "But the team's made it
really easy for me to come back in
and start playing, and just know
ing that they have confidence in
me helped me a lot. It was a little
awkward, but I was really excited
and when I was out there you
could probably tell they were giv
ing me a lot of direction."
