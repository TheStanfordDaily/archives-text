It had been 692 days since
she had donned a Cardinal uni
form, but redshirt sophomore
Kristin Folkl received a warm
welcome from the Maples Pavil
ion crowd of 5*719 in her season
debut as part of the third
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
The forward, who joined the
squad Monday to help cany the
burden left by a string of
injuries at the post, seemed a lit
tle shaky in her five first-half
minutes but came out strong in
the second half, grabbing
rebounds and dishing assists, as
the Card routed Washington

State 82-45.
"I thought Kristin did a great
job with it being her first game
and all the hype and everything
else," said head coach Tar a Van-
Derveer. "I want our team to
have a great year this year. [The
seniors were] one of the main
reasons why I called Kristin.
You have to have somebody to
help you on the boards and score
inside. We need our big kids
coming back, and this is giving
us a great shot."
Folkl's last appearance for
Stanford was in the national
semifinal game her freshman
year. Since then Foikl has con
centrated on volleyball. Last
