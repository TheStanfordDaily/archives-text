# Hoopsters snuff rally, slam door

### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. — It took five weeks to do it,
but No. 20 Stanford finally broke free of its road
demons here last night.
The Cardinal, shooting the ball better than it has
on the road all season, picked up its first road win in
over a month with a 76-63 victory over Washington
State before 5,294 fans at Friel Court. With the win,
Stanford improves to 16-6 and 9-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference and ensures itself of at least a split on this
two-game road trip, which concludes tomorrow after
noon with a 2 p.m. game at Washington (14-8, 7-6
Pac-10).
"This game was critical," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We did what we needed to do."
As long as it keeps winning, the Cardinal will con
tinue to gain ground on the conference leaders. Stan
ford has already moved a half-game ahead of No. 12
Arizona (16-7, 8-5), which suffered a 78-72 defeat at
Oregon last night, and is now tied for third place with
USC (14-9, 9-5), just one game behind second-place
California (19-6, 10-4).
The Cardinal led this one from wire to wire but
had to hold off a late charge by the Cougars (11-14,3-
10), who fought back from a 13-point second-half
deficit to shave the lead as close as three in the game's
final minutes. An Isaac Fontaine jumper with 3 min
utes, 45 seconds remaining cut the lead to 64-61 and
put the heat on Stanford.
"We had a little bit of a lead, (and] we let it get
away," Montgomery said. "We made some mental
mistakes at a point where we turned it over needless
ly, missed a couple of free throws, allowed them to get
back. Fortunately we got some plays to get us a little
bit of a lead again."
One of those plays was a Mark Madsen slam dunk
that gave Stanford a 66-61 advantage. On Washing
ton State's next possession, Madsen knocked the ball
from Carlos Daniel's hands as he went up for a mon
ster slam of his own. The ball ended up the hands of
senior point guard Brevin Knight, who was promptly
fouled by Washington State's Beau Archibald.
Knight, who finished with a team-high 23 points,
buried both free throws and then calmly drained four
more down the stretch to put the game on ice.
Washington State owed much of its second-half
comeback to the play of Fontaine, the standout senior
who is just nine points shy of breaking the Cougars'
career scoring record. The 6-foot-4 guard sliced up
the Cardinal defense for a game-high 26 points,
including 20 in the second half.
"I thought [sophomore Kris WeemsJ — despite
Isaac getting 26 — did a reasonably good job on him,"
Montgomery said. "As it turned out, that's just where
they were going virtually every time to score. At least
we made him work a little bit."
Sophomore Tim Young, nursing a sore back,
played 27 minutes and finished with 10 points and
four rebounds — modest ntfmbers, perhaps, but the
7-foot-l center's presence in the middle proved a
valuable asset in the first half. Young, drawing atten
tion from two and sometimes three defenders every
time he touched the ball, allowed Stanford to get free
on the perimeter.
Knight was a major beneficiary, drilling 6-of-8
from the floor en route to 14 first-half points. He was
a big reason Stanford was able to establish control
early. The Cardinal jumped out to a 9-0 lead and con
trolled the game throughout the first half. Washing-

a dog-eat-dog Pac-10 race, all that

Junior forward Kristin Folkl brings the ball upcourt last night at Maples
against Washington State. The game was her first in two years.
PULLMAN, Wash. — It took five weeks to do it,
but No. 20 Stanford finally broke free of its road
demons here last night.
The Cardinal, shooting the ball better than it has
on the road all season, picked up its first road win in
over a month with a 76-63 victory over Washington
State before 5,294 fans at Friel Court. With the win,
Stanford improves to 16-6 and 9-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference and ensures itself of at least a split on this
two-game road trip, which concludes tomorrow after
noon with a 2 p.m. game at Washington (14-8, 7-6
Pac-10).
"This game was critical," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We did what we needed to do."
As long as it keeps winning, the Cardinal will con
tinue to gain ground on the conference leaders. Stan
ford has already moved a half-game ahead of No. 12
Arizona (16-7, 8-5), which suffered a 78-72 defeat at
Oregon last night, and is now tied for third place with
USC (14-9, 9-5), just one game behind second-place
California (19-6, 10-4).
The Cardinal led this one from wire to wire but
had to hold off a late charge by the Cougars (11-14,3-
10), who fought back from a 13-point second-half
deficit to shave the lead as close as three in the game's
final minutes. An Isaac Fontaine jumper with 3 min
utes, 45 seconds remaining cut the lead to 64-61 and
put the heat on Stanford.
"We had a little bit of a lead, (and] we let it get
away," Montgomery said. "We made some mental
mistakes at a point where we turned it over needless
ly, missed a couple of free throws, allowed them to get
back. Fortunately we got some plays to get us a little
bit of a lead again."
One of those plays was a Mark Madsen slam dunk
that gave Stanford a 66-61 advantage. On Washing
ton State's next possession, Madsen knocked the ball
from Carlos Daniel's hands as he went up for a mon
ster slam of his own. The ball ended up the hands of
senior point guard Brevin Knight, who was promptly
fouled by Washington State's Beau Archibald.
Knight, who finished with a team-high 23 points,
buried both free throws and then calmly drained four
more down the stretch to put the game on ice.
Washington State owed much of its second-half
comeback to the play of Fontaine, the standout senior
who is just nine points shy of breaking the Cougars'
career scoring record. The 6-foot-4 guard sliced up
the Cardinal defense for a game-high 26 points,
including 20 in the second half.
"I thought [sophomore Kris WeemsJ — despite
Isaac getting 26 — did a reasonably good job on him,"
Montgomery said. "As it turned out, that's just where
they were going virtually every time to score. At least
we made him work a little bit."
Sophomore Tim Young, nursing a sore back,
played 27 minutes and finished with 10 points and
four rebounds — modest ntfmbers, perhaps, but the
7-foot-l center's presence in the middle proved a
valuable asset in the first half. Young, drawing atten
tion from two and sometimes three defenders every
time he touched the ball, allowed Stanford to get free
on the perimeter.
Knight was a major beneficiary, drilling 6-of-8
from the floor en route to 14 first-half points. He was
a big reason Stanford was able to establish control
early. The Cardinal jumped out to a 9-0 lead and con
trolled the game throughout the first half. Washing-

twice, but timely shooting kept the
Cougars at bay.
Washington State also had diffi

up eight rebounds and a career
high 13 points.
"The size hurts Washington
State inside," Montgomery said.
"Rebounding-wise, we felt like
we had to win that war and we
did."
All told, Stanford out-rebound
ed Washington State 36-25 and
outshot the Cougars, 47 percent to
40. But for a team in the middle of
a dog-eat-dog Pac-10 race, all that
really mattered on this night was
the bottom line.

"It's a road win," Montgomery
said, "it's a win we dearly needed
to have. From that standpoint we
feel pretty good."
