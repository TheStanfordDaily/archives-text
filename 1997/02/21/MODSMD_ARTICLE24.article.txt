## Men aim to ice Cal with home advantage

Patience is a virtue. Hard
work is an even greater virtue.
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team possesses both.
Burnham Pavilion will play
host to the men's gymnastics
team home opener tonight at 7.
The Cardinal will face California
for the third time this season.
Stanford entered the season
ranked third nationally, as a
result of the NCAA champi
onship meet last year. However,
Stanford quickly fell in the rank
ings after its first competition —
a lopsided defeat due to several
injured team members. In fact,
over half the team has sustained
some type of injury this season.
Just last week junior co-cap
tain Clarence Miao sprained his
ankle while working on his floor
exercise routine, resulting in a
week of inactivity and therapy.
Miao estimates himself at about
90-percent healthy and will com
pete in four events this weekend.
"I'm definitely not going to be
able to upgrade my floor and
vault because of my ankle," Miao
said.
For redshirt sophomore Jere
my Herman, a string of bad luck
culminated in a blood patch in
his back last Friday. Herman
had been trouble by a back
injury which required a corti
sone shot two weeks ago. Howev

er, the needle used for the corti
sone injection apparently nicked
the sheath surrounding his
spinal cord. Herman, leaking
spinal fluid, then received treat
ment at Stanford Hospital.
Despite these setbacks, Her
man will return to the pommel
horse for the Cardinal and has
apparently made a full recovery.
Mishaps aside, the Cardinal
team has been focusing on prac
ticing full routines and building
strength. Stanford has pegged
Cal as the team to beat this sea
son and at each competition
hopes to close the gap between
the two teams.
At the first meet of the sea
son, Cal beat Stanford by more
than 10 points, but the Card
managed to close the margin to
within seven in the second
matchup. The Card will continue
with patience and hard work to
chip away at the Bear lead,
steadily improving each step of
the way.
"I definitely see in practice
that everyone is improving. If
everything goes according to
plan we should be only four to
five points behind Cal," said
head coach Sadao Hamada.
The scoring totals consist of
the top four out of six scores in
each event for a maximum of 240
points.

Ups in floor and vault and cites
the rings as one event that
needs improvement due to the
time needed to build strength.
Tonight's meet will mark the
first time that the Cardinal
competes at home, and as a com
petition against the Card's
biggest rival, it should proved to
be an exciting event.
"It's going to be a great
meet," said sophomore Scott
Finkelstein. "I hope that Stan
ford will come out and support
us."
Each gymnast is working
hard to contribute to the overall
team effort and personal goals
reflect the unified thinking of
the team members.
"My goal for this meet is to do
well on rings because that's
where our team is lacking the
most," said senior lan
Bachrach. "It's important for
our team to show improvement
and close the gap. We kind of
want to give [Cal] a scare.
"We don't have a break from
here on out; it's an important
turning point."
The Cal gymnastics team has
a solid lineup including seniors
David Kruse and Trent Wells,
both of whom just made the
U.S. Senior Gymnastics Team.
But on the Cardinal front,
Stanford will send up four all
arounders in senior Keith Wiley,
senior Jamie Ellis, sophomore
Scott Finkelstein and freshman
Jason Katsampes. Wiley also
made the national team, out
ranking both Cal athletes.
As usual, Stanford competes
and trains with its eye on the
big prize, another NCAA cham
pionship.
"Cal is probably the best
team in the country — except
when April comes, we'll beat
them," Hamada said.
