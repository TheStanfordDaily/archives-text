# Men ready for Big Swim

### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
With about 10 days left before the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
and a month until the NCAA Champi
onships, the top-ranked Stanford
men's swimming team will round out
its dual-meet season tomorrow at No.
4 California, facing one of the
strongest Golden Bear squads in
recent years.
The Bears had a strong team in the
mid- and late '80s when the legendary-
Matt Biondi swam there, but they have
been mediocre in the years since. Cal
head coach Nort Thorton told Swim
ming World magazine that his team
has set a goal to be in a good position to
win the national championship in
three years.
Cal seems to have taken the first
step toward building its program back
up with the acquisition of a great
freshman class, as well as one more
addition that could make the biggest
difference.
In December, Cal signed New
Zealander Danyon Loader, who won a
silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly
at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and
then won two golds this past summer
in Atlanta in the 200- and 400-meter
freestyles. Aside from his versatility
and the fact that he is considered the
best in the world, Loader brings expe
rience and confidence to the Cal team.
Along with Loader, Cal has one of
the best freshman classes in the NCAA

this year, with six new swimmers who
were ranked among the top five high
school seniors in the country in their
respective events. They also have Nuk
Sirisanont, who swam in the 1996
Olympics for his native Thailand.
But Stanford has the tools to take
down Loader and his teammates in the
freestyle and butterfly events, says
assistant coach and former Stanford
swimmer Ted Knapp.
"We have the talented guys to go
1:38 (in the 200 free), and we need to
do that against Loader," Knapp said.
Sophomore Matt Pierce "is another
bright spot for us because he can beat
him in the 200 fly. But Loader defi
nitely will be the difference in the
meet. If he wins three events, we will
have a tough time."
In the 200 free, the Kiwi Olympian
will be challenged by Stanford's senior
co-captain Scott Jones and sopho
mores Justin Ewers and Dod Wales.
While Loader will be a formidable
opponent, his weaknesses are well
known by the Stanford freestyle corps.
Because Loader has competed mostly
in long-course, 50-meter pools, he is
not used to the 25-yard pools that
American collegiate swimming uses.
The half-sized course has caused Load
er some trouble in the past, as he has
been beaten in his specialty events this
year.
"Our goal is to beat him on the
turns because we've heard he has trou-
