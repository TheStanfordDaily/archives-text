# Men ready for Big Swim
## 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
With about 10 days left before the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships
and a month until the NCAA Champi
onships, the top-ranked Stanford
men's swimming team will round out
its dual-meet season tomorrow at No.
4 California, facing one of the
strongest Golden Bear squads in
recent years.
The Bears had a strong team in the
mid- and late '80s when the legendary-
Matt Biondi swam there, but they have
been mediocre in the years since. Cal
head coach Nort Thorton told Swim
ming World magazine that his team
has set a goal to be in a good position to
win the national championship in
three years.
Cal seems to have taken the first
step toward building its program back
up with the acquisition of a great
freshman class, as well as one more
addition that could make the biggest
difference.
In December, Cal signed New
Zealander Danyon Loader, who won a
silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly
at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and
then won two golds this past summer
in Atlanta in the 200- and 400-meter
freestyles. Aside from his versatility
and the fact that he is considered the
best in the world, Loader brings expe
rience and confidence to the Cal team.
Along with Loader, Cal has one of
the best freshman classes in the NCAA

this year, with six new swimmers who
were ranked among the top five high
school seniors in the country in their
respective events. They also have Nuk
Sirisanont, who swam in the 1996
Olympics for his native Thailand.
But Stanford has the tools to take
down Loader and his teammates in the
freestyle and butterfly events, says
assistant coach and former Stanford
swimmer Ted Knapp.
"We have the talented guys to go
1:38 (in the 200 free), and we need to
do that against Loader," Knapp said.
Sophomore Matt Pierce "is another
bright spot for us because he can beat
him in the 200 fly. But Loader defi
nitely will be the difference in the
meet. If he wins three events, we will
have a tough time."
In the 200 free, the Kiwi Olympian
will be challenged by Stanford's senior
co-captain Scott Jones and sopho
mores Justin Ewers and Dod Wales.
While Loader will be a formidable
opponent, his weaknesses are well
known by the Stanford freestyle corps.
Because Loader has competed mostly
in long-course, 50-meter pools, he is
not used to the 25-yard pools that
American collegiate swimming uses.
The half-sized course has caused Load
er some trouble in the past, as he has
been beaten in his specialty events this
year.
"Our goal is to beat him on the
turns because we've heard he has trou-
ble in short-course pools," Jones
said.
In the 200 butterfly, Pierce
also anticipates a close and excit
ing race with Loader. "He's got a
lot of speed, so I'll just go out
and race him," Pierce said. "I
like getting races down to the
last 50 and then seeing who's got
the heart to bring it home."
Aside from the showcase
matchups, many other of events
in the meet will be close. Sopho
more backstroker Tate Blahnik
will face his familiar rival, Bart
Sikora, in the 200 backstroke.
The Stanford sprinters —
juniors Chris Olson, Jed Crowe
and Scott Claypool, freshmen
Glenn Counts and Kurt Spencer
and Ewers, Jones and Wales —
will battle Cal standouts Bart
Kizierowski and Marcus Dicke in
the 100 freestyle, 50 freestyle
and relays. Junior Andre Salles-
Cunha, sophomore Blake Hold
en and freshman Steve Ronson
will take on Cal's breaststroke

crew of Aaron Shapley, Chris
tian Claytor and Sirisanont.
Even the diving and individu
al medleys will be tight, with
Stanford freshmen Andrew
Harper and Mark Michelin fac
ing Cal's divers on the one- and
three-meter boards, while junior
Tom Wilkens will step up
against Cal's Sikora, Sirisanont
and senior Ryan Duncan in the
IMs.
Stanford seems to have a
clear advantage in the distance
freestyle events. In the 1,650
and 500, Cardinal seniors Kevin
Radvanny and Jon Lischke,
sophomore Matt O'Mara and
freshman Steve Neebe will likely
outscore the Cal distance men.
Overall, though, this year's
Big Swim might be one of the
closest meetings between cross-
Bay rivals Stanford and Cal in
quite a while. Although the Car
dinal plans on doing its real
damage to the Cal team at Pac
10s and NCAAs, it would like to
drive away from Berkeley after
tomorrow's meet with a win and
continue to build momentum as
the postseason approaches.
