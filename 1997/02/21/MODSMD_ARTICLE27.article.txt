# Sluggers grapple with Gauchos
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
This is it. The final series before conference games
start. The last tuneup before the Pacific 10 Southern
Division schedule begins.
The No. 4 Stanford baseball team (10-4) takes on
the UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos (6-5) this weekend
at Sunken Diamond. The series begins at 7 tonight
with afternoon games Saturday and Sunday at 1
p.m.
"This is really important," said senior co-captain
Luke Quaccia. "It is our last tuneup before league,
and it would be nice to have another series win."
In a tough pre-conference schedule, Santa Bar
bara has already played four teams in the top 25. The
Gauchos scored big wins against No. 8 Arizona State
and No. 23 Cal State-Northridge but lost to No. 2
UCLA and No. 3 USC. However, Santa Barbara is
well-rested after not having played for two weeks,
while Stanford is coming off a weekend with four
games in a row.
The Gauchos have been surprised by their offen
sive success this season. Santa Barbara doesn't have
much of its offensive firepower from last year due to
the loss of six starters, but this year's Gauchos have
been able to fill their shoes.
Last year's All-Big West Conference selections
David Willis (.353, 16 home runs, 66 RBIs in 1996)
and Mike Young (.373, five homers, 38 RBIs in 1996)
lead the Gaucho attack. Sophomore David Uris (3-0)
has become the club's ace, as was verified in his vic
tory over the Sun Devils. The rest of the Santa Bar
bara arms, however, have been inconsistent.
"We thought we would have solid pitching, " said
Gaucho head coach Bob Brontsema. "The pitching is
just not up to its potential yet."
The Cardinal pitching has also had its ups and
downs recently. After the Cardinal allowed only four
runs in a three-game series against Fresno State,
Santa Clara scored 20 runs in three games last week
end. The pitching staff still boasts a 3.69 ERA, while
the ERA of Stanford's opponents is 7.60.
Often this season, when Stanford's pitching has
been on, the hitting has been off, and when the bats
have been hot, the arms have not.
"This weekend we want to put everything togeth
er," Quaccia said.
The Card has been playing well as a team lately,
with different people stepping up in every game.
Seven of the nine starters are hitting above .300,
with a team batting average of .335. Six players have
more than one home run, and seven players have
three or more doubles.
"A lot of guys are playing well," Quaccia said. "We
are getting good contributions from everyone on the
team."
Santa Barbara is expecting a tough series. The
key for the Gauchos is to pitch well and play solid
defense.
"Stanford is a great team, and we can't allow
them extra opportunities," Brontsema said. "They
are well-coached, they execute and they do what
makes you successful."
