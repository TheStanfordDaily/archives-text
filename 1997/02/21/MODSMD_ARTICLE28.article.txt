# No.12 Pacific chAlleges volleyball
## Card takes Tiger test 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
has momentum on its side coming into
tonight's 7 p.m. match against the Pacific
Tigers.
Although its winning streak is only one
match long, the Cardinal (6-2, 4-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) won with
a thorough trouncing of No. 7 UC-Santa
Barbara on Tuesday. While the team has
good reason to remain confident, it must
be wary not to overlook the Tigers.
Pacific, which comes into Burnham
Pavilion with a No. 12 ranking, also
defeated the Gauchos last week. The most
compelling fact about the Tigers (8-2, 3-2
MPSF) is that the team has only been
competing at the varsity level for five
years. In that time, Pacific's volleyball
ability has experienced a meteoric rise,
from cellar-dweller in the early years to
one of the top teams in the country.
"UOP is a strong team," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "They have
built and built steadily over the past five
years as a varsity program. Not only have
they gotten stronger year by year, but
they have gained ground on the rest of

the teams in the league and the country.
They are much closer to the top teams,
and they have put a lot of distance
between themselves and the bottom
teams."
The Tigers' rise to power is reflected in
the team's top player, 6-foot-7 senior out
side hitter Greg V.'akeham, who has
improved right along with the team. Like
the Tigers, Wakeham is a force to be reck
oned with. An All-American last year, he
led the MPSF in kills with 7.79 per game.
This year he has picked up right where he
left off, as he is the 10th best in the coun
try in this category with 5.82 kills per
game.
"Wakeham's a real strong attacker,"
Nieves said. "He really hurt us badly last
year when they came to Burnham and
beat us. He had 40 kills in the match and
really dominated. We need to come up
with and then execute a blocking scheme
to contain him."
Although in the past Wakeham has
been its lone weapon, this Pacific team
has three other top players. First among
these is freshman outside hitter Vladimir
Andric. The 6-foot-8 Croatian was one of
the top five recruits in the nation
last year and has proved he is
worthy of all accolades this year.
Currently, Andric is second on
the team in kills per game with
3.77 and third in hitting at .315.
More important, he has helped to
take a lot of the offensive load off
of Wakeham.
"Andric is the most heralded
recruit Pacific has ever landed,"

Nieves said. "By signing him last
year, they became a major player
in the recruiting wars. He is as
good as any freshman in the
country, and we have a pretty
good one ourselves "
In addition to Andric, 6-foot-4
senior outside hitter Sam Crosson
and 6-foot-2 sophomore setter
KeAlli Alexander will look to pro
pel the Tigers past Stanford.
The composition of the two
teams makes for what should be
some very compelling matchups.
Wakeham, UOP's top player, will
face off against Stanford's top

talent, senior outside hitter Mike
Lambert. Crosson, the Tigers'
other top senior outside hitter,
will face Matt Fuerbringer, also a
senior outside hitter.
Andric, the highly touted
freshman outside hitter, will
face Andy Witt, the top recruit in
the land last year and, like
Andric, an outside hitter. Final
ly, the two setters, Alexander for
Pacific and senior Stewart
Chong for the Card, who both
hail from Hawaii and faced off
often as they grew up, will
square off once again. These

four matchups should make the
match very compelling.
Although the Tigers are very
good at the setter and outside hit
ter positions, they appear to lack
the power at the middle blocker
positions that senior Matt Hoefer
and junior Keenan Whitehurst
provide the Cardinal. If these
middle blockers continue to play
as well as they have been, Stan
ford could be victorious.
"We do seem to have the
advantage in the middle," Nieves
said. "Even though our guys are
better on paper that doesn't mean

all that much. When they beat us
last year, we got badly outplayed
in the middle by two players who
were not supposed to be very
strong. This year we have to be
strong in the middle to win."
The match should give the
Cardinal an idea of whether or
not Tuesday's dominance over
Santa Barbara was just a fluke,
or if the team can sustain it for
the duration of the season. A con
vincing win over UOP would go a
long way toward legitimizing
Stanford's claim for a national
title.
