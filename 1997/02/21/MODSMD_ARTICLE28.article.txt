## Card takes Tiger test 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
has momentum on its side coming into
tonight's 7 p.m. match against the Pacific
Tigers.
Although its winning streak is only one
match long, the Cardinal (6-2, 4-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) won with
a thorough trouncing of No. 7 UC-Santa
Barbara on Tuesday. While the team has
good reason to remain confident, it must
be wary not to overlook the Tigers.
Pacific, which comes into Burnham
Pavilion with a No. 12 ranking, also
defeated the Gauchos last week. The most
compelling fact about the Tigers (8-2, 3-2
MPSF) is that the team has only been
competing at the varsity level for five
years. In that time, Pacific's volleyball
ability has experienced a meteoric rise,
from cellar-dweller in the early years to
one of the top teams in the country.
"UOP is a strong team," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "They have
built and built steadily over the past five
years as a varsity program. Not only have
they gotten stronger year by year, but
they have gained ground on the rest of

the teams in the league and the country.
They are much closer to the top teams,
and they have put a lot of distance
between themselves and the bottom
teams."
The Tigers' rise to power is reflected in
the team's top player, 6-foot-7 senior out
side hitter Greg V.'akeham, who has
improved right along with the team. Like
the Tigers, Wakeham is a force to be reck
oned with. An All-American last year, he
led the MPSF in kills with 7.79 per game.
This year he has picked up right where he
left off, as he is the 10th best in the coun
try in this category with 5.82 kills per
game.
"Wakeham's a real strong attacker,"
Nieves said. "He really hurt us badly last
year when they came to Burnham and
beat us. He had 40 kills in the match and
really dominated. We need to come up
with and then execute a blocking scheme
to contain him."
Although in the past Wakeham has
been its lone weapon, this Pacific team
has three other top players. First among
these is freshman outside hitter Vladimir
Andric. The 6-foot-8 Croatian was one of
