Stanford's track and field team is set
to press its luck this weekend in the land
of high-stakes gambling. The team
heads to Reno, Nev., for the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onships in an attempt to stake its claim
on the gold.
The team is led by a core of distance
runners who will be a force to be reck
oned with as two NCAA cross country
championships demonstrate. The Cardi
nal will be represented by 27 men and 27
women.
"It'll be a great opportunity for the
individual athletes to come together as a
team," said junior thrower Gina Heads.
"It's the first meet we have in which such
a large team is competing."
The MPSF Championship is the
indoor conference championship for a
number of schools throughout the
region. The event is a scored meet in
which the top eight finishers in each
event earn points for their respective

schools.
"Because it's a scored meet, we really
need everyone to push extra hard," said
junior field athlete Sami Jo Small. "Indi
vidual ailments need to be put aside, and
'team' needs to be on everyone's mind."
Stanford places its bets on such stars
as senior Jimmie Johnson, who has
already qualified for the NCAA indoors in
the 200-meier dash, and senior captain
Monal Chokshi, an Ail-American in cross
country.
Both men's and women's distance
medley relays Eire already ranked nation
ally as well. The throwers are led by
senior multi-eventer Katrinka Jackson,
who displays her versatility in the shot
put and the high jump. She has high
hopes this weekend.
"I really feel everything coming
together," Jackson said. "Hopefully, this
championship setting will push me to
that next level."
The entire Cardinal team hopes to
prove that they belong at that next level
in a town where anything's possible.
