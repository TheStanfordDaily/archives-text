# Stanford reacts to Deng's recent death
## 
### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
The campus had a muted reac
tion yesterday to news of the
death of Deng Xiaoping, a world
leader hailed by The New York
Times as the "architect of modern
China."
Linyong Pang, head of the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, compared the
death of Deng to that of Chairman
Mao Tse Tung, whom Deng suc
ceeded as leader.
Upon Mao's death in 1976, "the
entire nation mourned greatly. It
felt like one's own parent had died,"
Pang said. Everyone had a great
sense of loss."
"China has changed since then,"
he said. "Even though we are very
sorry that Mr. Deng has died, we
don't feel that magnitude of loss"
this time.
Knight Fellow KatherineWil
helm, former Associated Press Bei
jing Bureau Chief, agreed that peo
ple's reactions to Deng's death were
far less emotional.
Mao had cultivated a sense of im
mortality about him, she said. "The
Chinese constantly recited the slo
gan,' Mao, 10,000 years.' "

Mao also placed himself at the
"center of national effort ... Deng
was never treated in that way," she
added.
Deng's death was a surprise to
few. "Quite clearly, he was in very ill
health" in the past few years, said
History Prof. Peter Duus, a Chinese
studies scholar.
"The main thing is that he set in


Deng Xiaoping
place a group" of able leaders to suc
ceed him, he added.
Unlike Mao, Deng had retired
from all of his official posts years be
fore he died. However, he main
tained strong political influence.
More stability is anticipated in the
transition of power in present-day
China, Duus said.
Duus doubted there would be
great changes in the short term re

garding Chinese relations with
Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United
States.
"My general impression is that
.. . essentially the generation that is
going to take over has already (done
so) in a sense," he said.
The emerging Chinese leader
ship is centered around party boss
Jiang Zemin, whom Wilhelm said is
slightly more conservative than
Deng. But like Duus, Wilhelm does
not anticipate immediate signifi
cant changes in Chinese policy ei
ther.
However, events such as the

transition of Hong Kong rule to
China this summer create the op
portunity for political shifting to
take place, Wilhelm added.
According to Duus, Deng was
"a great pragmatist who succeed
ed Mao, who was a great ideo
logue. [Deng] did a great deal to
shift the country... to more prag
matic tasks such as industrializa
tion and modernization of the
economy."
There was little visible under
graduate response to Deng's death
on campus yesterday. Cindy Ng, as
sistant director of the Asian Amer

ican Activities Center, attributed
this to the fact that most under
graduates are "mainly American
born."
Compared to the 19605, there is
less of a "pro-China movement" and
a weaker motivation to "claim your
heritage."
One factor in this could also be
the "criticism that has hit China
more recently with human rights"
issues, Ngsaid.
"It will be interesting to watch
what happens (with China)," she
added, "both in the Party as well as
in the government."
