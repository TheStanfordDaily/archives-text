Vienna, Dec. 21
Last night I had a dream where I was chased by a giant rac
coon. Imt it turned out the raccoon was my mother. I wonder
what die significance of this is.
Vienna, Fd3. 1
My therapist Von Mahler and 1 feel like we've made some
progress. In the last week alone. I unearthed long-repressed
memories of being a can-can dancer in the Folies-Bergeres
and of hav ing once shared a hot dog with Sigmnnd Freud. Dur
ing a long session of hypnosis. Dr. Mahler brought back mem
ories of self-molestation, my ego on top of my superego and a
bad credit line. \X hen the session was over. I started crying
and sang "Lili Marlene" in the original German, which doctor
Mahler found fascinating since I don't know any German. Me
vaguely suggested that I may have been possessed by the spir
it of Marlene Dietrich, and 112 demanded to know for sure if that
was true so I could charge her rent and try to gel a tax deduc
tion in this fiscal year.

Berlin, Feb. 17
Spent I lie afternoon placing charades with Kafka's youngest son, Kranz, who has only one finger
and cries when you pet his head. Needless to say. the experience depressed me enormously and
was all the more anno) ing since Kafka kept mouthing "I'm gonna kill you" during the game, dis
tracting me to no end.

Ibiza, Feb. 19
Mv relationship with mv friend I l>u Roi has improved con
siderably this neck, lie still insists that I fall oil the floor
and kis> his feet whenever I meet him, hut I feel this is a
minor appeasement to subject myself to.
Gstaad, March 11
Woke nit screaming in the middle of the night. My sister
Oriana ralaeci came into my room and comforted me. Ori
ana is \i>iting from Germany to check on my increasing
paranoia, but I fear that's simply an excuse for her to get to
the local hospital and have an operation to turn herself into
a huge vagina and have a monopoly over the world's
orgasms. I have not told her about my suspicions because I
fear she will sell me on the black market if I do. and I'm
not readv to live a life as an indentured geisha girl,
although I did see a verv nice kimono at Saks the other day
that happened to be half-price.

Cornwall, April 2
Yesterday I died. Toda\ thev came to get mv body, and I insisted they leave it where it was so I
could finish mv nap. Things got very ugly and eventually they left me alone and took the dish
washer instead. There is onlv pain everywhere, which convinces me to ask. "VI hat is the point of
it all?" I pon which a large salamander fell from the ceiling and devoured me alive, head first.
