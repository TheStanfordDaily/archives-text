### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The No. 11 women's gymnas
tics team takes on UC-Santa
Barbara on hostile turf tomor
row. This will be the Card's sec
ond time this season to meet the
Gauchos' challenge.
With one of its best showings
of the season, the Cardinal
defeated the UCSB squad by
more than six points in a home
meet two weeks ago. The Cardi
nal has consistently improved its
performance and is in top condi
tion to go up against the Gau
chos.
"They are a good team, but I
don't think it will really be too
much of a problem," said sopho
more co-captain Amy Muraka
mi.
Head coach Lisa Izzi said that
the meet will be an opportunity
for the squad to experiment with
different lineups and rest some
members of the team.
That means the newer mem
bers of the squad will have a
chance to compete on more
events, and regular performers
such as co-captains Keri Mona
han and Murakami will be given
a chance to recuperate.
Izzi said both Monahan and
Murakami, who have competed

on all four events at every meet,
will still compete but will most
likely not enter the meet as all
around gymnasts.
"I don't expect to go down
there and score big," Izzi said. "I
don't see us concentrating on
win-loss; I'd like to focus on the
same things we've been working
on, such as consistency."
Murakami agreed tomorrow's
meet will be a great opportunity
for the Cardinal to advance as a
team.
Murakami said the squad
needs to start pushing its talent
ed members into the lineup, and
the meet gives the squad the
chance to accomplish this.
"We definitely need everyone
ready to get up there and consis
tently score high," Murakami
said. "We need to work on depth.
We need people to step up and fill
in spots" in the lineup.
The Cardinal gymnasts who
will see more competition time
tomorrow include freshmen
Tara LaMorte, Sarah Harding
and Annie Thananopavarn.
LaMorte is one of the rookie
forces who has executed high
scoring routines throughout the
season, in particular on the floor
exercise.
Thananopavarn also has
enjoyed success with her ener

getic floor routine and is expect
ed to put on a strong perfor
mance tomorrow.
Harding, who put on a skilled
exhibition performance on the
beam in a meet against Califor
nia last week, is also more than
ready to show the fans what she
can do.
"It felt really good to be in
front of a crowd and perform
ing," Harding said.
Harding, who has suffered
from a stress fracture in her
lower back since October, said
she would like to concentrate on
the beam and bars for the time
being.
"I want to get them consistent
enough to the point where I can
compete," she said.
Junior Christie Jones, who
competed on the vault for the
first time this season in last
week's match against California,
is another must-see tomorrow.
Last week, Jones displayed solid
skills on both the vault and beam
and gave a sophisticated exhibi
tion routine on the floor.
Jones said she is happy with
her recent routines and hopes
the Santa Barbara meet will be
her "opportunity to step up."
"Hopefully, I'll get a chance to
prove I should be in there, com
peting," she said.
