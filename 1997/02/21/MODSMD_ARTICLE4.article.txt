## Volunteers help East Palo Alto residents get online 
### Vicky Aiming Contributing writer 
Although it Lies just a few miles
away from the heart of Silicon Val
ley, East Palo Alto has not shared in
the high-tech boom that has trans
formed neighboring communities.
In 1992, after graduating with a
law degree from Stanford, Bart
Decrem founded the nonprofit or
ganization Plugged In to tap into
the resources of Silicon Valley and
help bridge that information gap.
"I was struck by how close East
Palo Alto was to Silicon Valley but
how far away it was mentally from
the information revolution,"
Decrem said, who is now executive
director of the organization.
Located among the liquor stores
of East Palo Alto's Whiskey Gulch,
Plugged In today attracts up to 200
people each week, who use its free
computers or take advantage of its
rolling program of complimentary
computer classes.
Community members of all ages
use Plugged In's services to set up e
mail accounts, type up resumes, do
homework or just drop by to surf
the Internet, according to Decrem.
Most of Plugged In's visitors
come from the local East Palo Alto
community, where fewer than one
in five homes own a computer, ac
cording to a recent Plugged In sur
vey of 300 households.
"People in East Palo Alto are
very aware that there are a lot of

things going on in the [Silicon] Val
ley, and people want to be a part of
that," said Decrem.
Plugged In — which is open to
the public 70 hours a week — offers
community members access to the
Information Superhighway.
"We actually see the Internet
making a difference to the commu
nity at a grass-roots level," said
Decrem, citing the example of a
Tongan woman who had recently
hooked up with the Bay Area Pacif
ic Islander community online.
Decrem said the Internet has

changed the nature of Plugged In's
work beyond recognition since the
organization's early days
"The Internet has created the
momentum for our organization as
a whole," he said. "It has woken
people up to the work we do."
Former students of Plugged In
designed the organization's World
Wide Web page. In June 1995,
Decrem decided to set up a teen
business that would build on the or
ganization's expertise and give local
teen-agers a chance to get involved
in a business enterprise.

For a fee of about $50 an hour,
teenagers offer Web design and
other computer services. Two years
ago these teens designed the Web
page for Cowell Student Health
Center.
"We liked the idea of usingyoung
low-income people as a boot-step
up," said Jane Meier, associate di
rector of Cowell. "It was a win-win
situation. We got great service for a
reasonable price."
The connection between Stan
ford and Plugged In continues
today. Many of its permanent staff
are former Stanford students.
Deerem said that people often
ask him why he is dedicating his life
to a nonprofit organization when he
could be earning so much more
money as a lawyer. The answer is
simply that it makes him happy.
Magda Escobar, Plugged In's re
cently appointed development di
rector, has been working for non
profit organizations ever since she
graduated from Stanford in 1992
with a degree in psychology.
"I was always interested in
working with people that didn't
have access to things I did have ac
cess to at Stanford," Escobar said.
She said she feels it is easy to hide
from the issues that affect low-in
come communities just a few miles
away from campus.
"A lot of people at Stanford live
in a bubble. It's very isolated," Es

derstand diverse communities,
fworkingat Plugged In] is a perfect
way to get life experience."
She encouraged people to visit
or volunteer at Plugged In, which
is located at 1923 University Ave.
Escobar said that a lot of times,
volunteers end up learning more
from the people they teach than
vice versa.
Many of the volunteers come

from Silicon Valley companies,
which also provide all of Plugged
In's computer equipment. Tech
nology companies like Bay Net
works, Intel, Apple Computer and
Hewlett Packard provide approxi
mately one-third of Plugged In's
budget, according to Escobar.
"So many companies embrace
our organization," said Bill Goetz, a
Silicon Valley engineer who sits on
Plugged In's Board of Directors.
"They think people in the local area
should have access to computers."
Silicon Valley has been very gen
erous in donating volunteers' time
and resources, he said.
