# Mela to celebrate South Asian life
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Stanford students will have
the chance to go somewhere
other than a fraternity party or
dorm progressive tonight
when Sanskriti — the South
Asian Students group — pre
sents Mela, an annual perfor
mance celebrating South Asian
culture.
The extravaganza, now in
its seventh year, will feature
traditional and contemporary
Indian dance, singing, food,
skits and a fashion show.

The name Mela comes from
the Hindi word for "fair."
"Its not exactly a fair but
more of a performance. It is like
a fair in that everyone is having
a good time and showing their
spirit," said Rajen Sheth, one of
Sanskriti's co-chairs.
According to Sheth, Mela
serves two purposes: to expose
Stanford students to South
Asian culture and to bring the
South Asian student commu
nity together to share their cul
tural heritage.

"Mela brings the community
together to learn about [South
Asian] culture through each
other," Sheth said.
One of the largest student pro
ductions on campus, Mela fea
tures more than 150 student
dancers.
The dance performances will
culminate with the Bhangra, a

traditional harvest dance which,
with 60 dancers, is Mela's biggest
feature.
"Its very high energy. People
really get into it," Sheth said.
According to Sheth, Mela will
incorporate American influences
on South Asian and South Asian-
American culture. - ~
The Bhangra dance will use
American hip-hop music and con
temporary popular Indian music
as well as traditional Indian
music. The skits, most of which
are humorous, will address prob

lems in what Sheth calls "bridging
the gap between two cultures.
"It hasn't been easy to be a
South Asian American," Sheth
said. "They are two very different
cultures. The Indian culture is
very strong, but growing up in
American society creates confu
sion as to which values to follow."
The performance, which has
previously been held during spring
quarter, was moved earlier in the
year to give freshmen an earlier ex
posure to the South Asian commu
nity, said Charmaine Hussain, co

producer of Mela. This way, they
will be able to maintain ties with
seniors that they meet.
"On the surface Mela is about
dancing and singing, but it
achieves a lot more," Hussain
said. "It is a chance for people to
get to know each other and builds
awareness of the South Asian cul
ture on campus."
Mela will be held in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at 7:30 tonight. Tick
ets will be available in White Plaza
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and
at the door.
