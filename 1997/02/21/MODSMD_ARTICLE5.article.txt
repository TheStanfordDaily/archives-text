# Mela to celebrate South Asian life
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Stanford students will have
the chance to go somewhere
other than a fraternity party or
dorm progressive tonight
when Sanskriti — the South
Asian Students group — pre
sents Mela, an annual perfor
mance celebrating South Asian
culture.
The extravaganza, now in
its seventh year, will feature
traditional and contemporary
Indian dance, singing, food,
skits and a fashion show.

The name Mela comes from
the Hindi word for "fair."
"Its not exactly a fair but
more of a performance. It is like
a fair in that everyone is having
a good time and showing their
spirit," said Rajen Sheth, one of
Sanskriti's co-chairs.
According to Sheth, Mela
serves two purposes: to expose
Stanford students to South
Asian culture and to bring the
South Asian student commu
nity together to share their cul
tural heritage.
