# Faculty protest changes to CIV
## 
### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
Controversy surrounds the reform of the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program as the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies consid
ers both a proposal from the CIV Design and
Review Committee and a letter of protest
signed by 22 CIV professors and teachers.
Members of the review committee met with
the undergraduate studies committee on
Wednesday to officially present and discuss the
proposed structural changes, which include
plans for a new introductory humanities course
and the dismantling of the current CIV pro
gram. The Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies has scheduled an open meeting to discuss
the proposed reforms on Wednesday.
Several faculty members have objected to
the changes proposed. CIV Director Paul
Seaver submitted a letter to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies last Friday calling for
"a genuine and full review" of the current CIV
program. Twenty-two CIV faculty signed in
agreement. In the letter, Seaver accused the re
view committee of ignoring the guidelines sug
gested by the academic senate.
According to guidelines established by the
Faculty Senate, the review committee is ad
vised to compare CIV with similar programs at
other universities, look at studies of student
opinion and study analysis conducted by an in
dependent visiting committee. Seaver claimed
in the letter that the review committee had not
followed any of these recommendations.
"I feel that the Faculty Senate asked for the
first in a series of reviews and that has not been

produced," said Marsh McCall, a classics pro
fessor who signed the letter.
Andrew Aisenberg, a lecturer for Structured
Liberal Education, also signed the letter. "The
(review committee's) proposal does not really
address substantive, intellectual issues," he
said. "There are other ways to do it which
wouldn't call for such drastic" measures."
English Prof. Robert Polhemus, head of the
CIV Design and Review Committee, main
tained that the committee's review was thor
ough. "We were faced with the question of
whether we should keep the program, junk it
entirely or reform it,"he said. "We decided to
make it better."
The most significant change proposed is
that students would take a general introducto
ry class in the fall quarter and not choose a spe
cific track until winter. The track would con
tinue through spring quarter.
The fall course would emphasize the close
reading of a few texts from different perspec
tives, according to Ramon Saldivar, vice
provost for undergraduate education.
"Classes will be team taught by professors
with different interests, such as philosophy,
history and literature," he said. "In this way,
students will really learn what it is that the hu
manities do."
Under the new program, winter and spring
quarters would function similarly to the cur
rent CIV program tracks, offering students the
opportunity to apply the "skills and tools"
learned in the introductory quarter to classes
that are more "concrete, specific and focused,"
said Saldivar.
Members of the review committee dispute

Seaver's claims that they had overstepped then
bounds.
"We did the best that we could to follow the
letter and spirit of the document," Polhemus
said.
Saldivar agreed with Polhemus, saying "As
dean I've sat on many of the [interdisciplinary
program] reviews, and I can say that they were
more thorough and more complete than any
others we've done."
Polhemus rebutted the charge that student
opinions had not been taken into account. Stu
dent responses were "a large influence" he ex
plained. "The universal criticism we get from
students is that there is too much reading."
The new program addresses this concern by de
creasing the number of books read during the
first quarter to a maximum of five.
He said that the faculty members who
signed the letter were seeking to stall progress
via legal technicalities. "I hope that people are
discussing the issues and not caught up in petty
legal matters. The people involved are no doubt
working in the students' interests, but we don't
want to stifle discussion," Polhemus said.
McCall stated that he also wanted discus
sion and acknowledged that reforms are need
ed, but said that CIV "cannot be eliminated
without being properly reviewed."
Moreover, he disagreed with the proposed
reforms on "pedagogic, structural and intellec
tual grounds."
"I think that the report is not persuasive and
that the reforms represent an intellectual
weakening. It is inconceivable that this is the
best way to greet Stanford freshmen," McCall
said.
