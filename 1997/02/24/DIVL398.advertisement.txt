Think you're on top of campus issues? Think you're funny? Think you con draw?
Then become an editorial cartoonist for The Daily.
We print an editorial cartoon on page 4 every day, and usually they're from nationwide syndicates.
But we'd like to be able to run Stanford-specific cartoons; we just need people to draw them.
Insight, wit and artistic ability are required. Business suit, fancy resume and high GPA are not.
Interested? Call David or Ryan at 725-2100 ext. 512 for more information.
