Today's birthdny:
You possess an adventurous, mystic
nature and a spontaneous train of
thought. A desire to help those in less
fortunate circumstances will guide you
through life. Expect many strange
experinces as a result.
Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
Imaginative ideas spring from
your mind. Steer clear from
those who do not appreciate
them.
Aries (March 21-April 19)
Don't let the change in weather
{4k \ deter you from your studies.
vVvy ee Pn m ' n< * y° u neo( * to
a lot done.
Taurus (April 20-May 20)
*"v Your paranoid glances over
)y° ur shoulder are unfounded
and unwarranted. No one is
watching you.
Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Don't let others rope you into
activities you wouldn't ordi
narily participate in.
Cancer (June 21-July 22)
Guard your health — you'll
need stamina later in the
week to handle all the opportu
nities in store.
Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Give up a bad habit today or at
least take steps to rid that
behavior from your daily routine.
—i* Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
V- \ You have a tendency to think
y that small crushes are out of
your league, but it's your self
deprecating attitude that keeps them
out of your reach.
-— Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
free to communicate
ideas, but avoid being over
judgmental. Friends have been
overreacting lately.
« \ Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
J Be careful of revealing a pri
vate matter — you could be
talking to the wrong person. Can your
confidante be trusted?
Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
"57'v It's time to get over that
grudge you've been holding —
before it takes over your life.
Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
v —. You've been through the
\ toughest part, so don't fall
j back into self-deception and
that "Woe is me" attitude.
Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
You could be somewhat reck
\ less this week. Curb that ten-
J dency to gossip — it'll save
you a headache.
