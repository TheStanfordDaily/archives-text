# Kate the great
## Starbird eclipses all-time school record for points scored 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
It was a page out of Stanford
history, and one that couldn't
have been written any better if
you'd hired a prize-winning au
thor to script the entire
evening.
It was Senior Night, and the
sold-out Maples Pavilion crowd
showered the four seniors with
endless applause in the
pregame ceremony honoring
them. The electricity of the
fans filled the air, and as the tip
went up to start the game be
tween the No. 3 Cardinal (27-1,
15-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
and the Washington Huskies
(13-10,8-6) the countdown was
on.
Everyone in the gym knew
this was the night, and the only
mystery left was whether or
not the historical moment
would come in the first half of
play. One fan held a sign across
from the scorer's table that
read "K-13," letting anyone
who was clueless enough not to
know that senior guard Kate
Starbird was just 13 points
away from becoming Stan
ford's all-time leading scorer.
But it's probably safe to say
that no one in the stands or on
the bench needed a reminder.
Each time Starbird sank a bas
ket the noise level rose a notch,
and fans could be spotted dou
ble-checking the point total on
their fingers.
Two and a half minutes into
the game, Starbird made her
first basket — a 10-foot jumper
in that shooting style which is
hers alone, a style that many
call ugly and no one considers
good form. But it's a style that
has been ugly for the senior
2,086 times in her Stanford ca
reer, and you can bet no one is
going to try to change it at this
point. With the Cardinal racing
away from the Huskies with a

Women's basketball forward Kate Starbird broke Stanford's all-time scoring record
this weekend with her 2078 th point.
10-2 lead the sign read "K-ll."
The emotionally charged atmo
sphere at Maples translated into
the players' performances on the
court, and Stanford jumped out to
a 26-4 lead at the 12:58 mark on a
Starbird jumper from the left cor
ner. Starbird's roommate, junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard, fueled
the Cardinal run with four three
pointers while Starbird chipped in
four points on two 16-foot jumpers.
K-7 and counting.
"Starbird is the best player in
the country," said Husky head
coach June Daugherty. "There's
no doubt about it. What she does
for the Stanford team — she just
takes the team on her back. She's
just a complete player, and if she's
not player of the year people back
East need to get their heads up."
Starbird sat down to a hefty
round of applause with 9:47 to play
in the half, and the countdown was
momentarily halted. However,
Starbird re-entered the game just
two minutes later, and the fans
quickly reassumed the Starbird
watch. At 6:43 Starbird took a pass
from freshman guard Milena Flo
res into the lane for a driving layup
— a move the Cardinal crowd has
witnessed too many times to count
in the senior's career. K-5.
Starbird looked to be set to
eclipse Val Whiting's 4-year-old
record of 2,077 career points in the
first half of the final regular season
home game of her career. With
6:09 remaining in the period she
sank another 15-foot jumper from
the left corner, and the count was
K-3. But the next six minutes
we real most a tease to Stanford
fans.
Starbird sent up a three-point
attempt from the right baseline
that looked on line and brought
most fans to their feet, but it
rimmed out and the crowd let out a
moan of disbelief. Starbird missed
another jumper and a contested
layup and looked to be heading to
the locker room three points shy of
claiming the record. But Flores got
a steal with five seconds left and
heaved it upcourt to a flashing
Starbird who laid it up and in at
the buzzer. K-l. Starbird had tied
the record and trotted off with her
teammates as one of two players as
Stanford's all-time best scorer.
It took just 1:59 in the second
half for that moment that everyone
was waiting for. Junior center
Olympia Scott created a turnover,
and what proceeded looked like an
instant replay from the reels of
Stanford game film. Starbird

picked up the steal and charged
down the court with the ball. She
split two defenders and went up
with the layup, drawing the foul.
Starbird's shot landed softly on the
rim, rolled around and fell through
the net as the rarely emotional
Starbird pumped her fist.
Maples went nuts. Four large
red signs were held up across from
the Stanford bench that read "2,"
"0," "7" and "8," and the count
down was finally over. But the
excitement was just reaching its
peak, and not a soul was sitting for
Starbird's free throw. Despite the
incredible roar from the fans, Star
bird easily completed the three
point play, and you knew immedi
ately that the down-to-earth star
was back to business as usual.
But for the fans the rest of the
game was more of a celebration
than a contest. Senior forward
Tara Harrington checked in at the
12:24 mark, and the jubilant crowd
got to see all four of its seniors for
one last time. As for Starbird, she
finished with 21 points, was award
ed the game ball and was the last
starter to check out of the game at
6:07. And yes, the fans cheered.
"I don't think 1 couid've timed it
any better," Starbird said. "It was
a great coincidence that it could be
at home on my Senior Night. It was
really a special experience. The
crowd was really amazing."

that no one in the stands or on
the bench needed a reminder.
Each time Starbird sank a bas
ket the noise level rose a notch,
and fans could be spotted dou
ble-checking the point total on
their fingers.
Two and a half minutes into
the game, Starbird made her
first basket — a 10-foot jumper
in that shooting style which is
hers alone, a style that many
call ugly and no one considers
good form. But it's a style that
has been ugly for the senior
2,086 times in her Stanford ca
reer, and you can bet no one is
going to try to change it at this
point. With the Cardinal racing
away from the Huskies with a


Laura Hester — Daily
Women's basketball forward Kate Starbird broke Stanford's all-time scoring record
this weekend with her 2078 th point.
10-2 lead the sign read "K-ll."
The emotionally charged atmo
sphere at Maples translated into
the players' performances on the
court, and Stanford jumped out to
a 26-4 lead at the 12:58 mark on a
Starbird jumper from the left cor
ner. Starbird's roommate, junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard, fueled
the Cardinal run with four three
pointers while Starbird chipped in
four points on two 16-foot jumpers.
K-7 and counting.
"Starbird is the best player in
the country," said Husky head
coach June Daugherty. "There's
no doubt about it. What she does
for the Stanford team — she just
takes the team on her back. She's
just a complete player, and if she's
not player of the year people back
East need to get their heads up."
Starbird sat down to a hefty
round of applause with 9:47 to play
in the half, and the countdown was
momentarily halted. However,
Starbird re-entered the game just
two minutes later, and the fans
quickly reassumed the Starbird
watch. At 6:43 Starbird took a pass
from freshman guard Milena Flo
res into the lane for a driving layup
— a move the Cardinal crowd has
witnessed too many times to count
in the senior's career. K-5.
Starbird looked to be set to
eclipse Val Whiting's 4-year-old
record of 2,077 career points in the
first half of the final regular season
home game of her career. With
6:09 remaining in the period she
sank another 15-foot jumper from
the left corner, and the count was
K-3. But the next six minutes
we real most a tease to Stanford
fans.
Starbird sent up a three-point
attempt from the right baseline
that looked on line and brought
most fans to their feet, but it
rimmed out and the crowd let out a
moan of disbelief. Starbird missed
another jumper and a contested
layup and looked to be heading to
the locker room three points shy of
claiming the record. But Flores got
a steal with five seconds left and
heaved it upcourt to a flashing
Starbird who laid it up and in at
the buzzer. K-l. Starbird had tied
the record and trotted off with her
teammates as one of two players as
Stanford's all-time best scorer.
It took just 1:59 in the second
half for that moment that everyone
was waiting for. Junior center
Olympia Scott created a turnover,
and what proceeded looked like an
instant replay from the reels of
Stanford game film. Starbird

picked up the steal and charged
down the court with the ball. She
split two defenders and went up
with the layup, drawing the foul.
Starbird's shot landed softly on the
rim, rolled around and fell through
the net as the rarely emotional
Starbird pumped her fist.
Maples went nuts. Four large
red signs were held up across from
the Stanford bench that read "2,"
"0," "7" and "8," and the count
down was finally over. But the
excitement was just reaching its
peak, and not a soul was sitting for
Starbird's free throw. Despite the
incredible roar from the fans, Star
bird easily completed the three
point play, and you knew immedi
ately that the down-to-earth star
was back to business as usual.
But for the fans the rest of the
game was more of a celebration
than a contest. Senior forward
Tara Harrington checked in at the
12:24 mark, and the jubilant crowd
got to see all four of its seniors for
one last time. As for Starbird, she
finished with 21 points, was award
ed the game ball and was the last
starter to check out of the game at
6:07. And yes, the fans cheered.
"I don't think 1 couid've timed it
any better," Starbird said. "It was
a great coincidence that it could be
at home on my Senior Night. It was
really a special experience. The
crowd was really amazing."

It was a page out of Stanford
history, and one that couldn't
have been written any better if
you'd hired a prize-winning au
thor to script the entire
evening.
It was Senior Night, and the
sold-out Maples Pavilion crowd
showered the four seniors with
endless applause in the
pregame ceremony honoring
them. The electricity of the
fans filled the air, and as the tip
went up to start the game be
tween the No. 3 Cardinal (27-1,
15-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
and the Washington Huskies
(13-10,8-6) the countdown was
on.
Everyone in the gym knew
this was the night, and the only
mystery left was whether or
not the historical moment
would come in the first half of
play. One fan held a sign across
from the scorer's table that
read "K-13," letting anyone
who was clueless enough not to
know that senior guard Kate
Starbird was just 13 points
away from becoming Stan
ford's all-time leading scorer.
But it's probably safe to say
that no one in the stands or on
the bench needed a reminder.
