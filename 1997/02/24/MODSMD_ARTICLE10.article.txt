NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman
fired into a crowd of tourists on the
observation deck of the Empire
State Building yesterday, killing
one person and wounding six oth
ers before fatally shooting himself
in the head.
Ah Abu Kamal, 69, died without
regaining consciousness five hours
after the shootings, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's press office
said. His passport said he was a
Palestinian from Ramallah, on
Israel's west bank, who came to
the United States on Christmas
Eve, Giuliani said.
Witnesses said dozens of people
— many of them foreign tourists
— fled in panic toward stairways
and elevators as Abu Kamal
sprayed bullets on the outdoor
deck that surrounds a large, win
dowed room on the 86th floor.
"I've never seen so much blood
in my life," said Belgian business
man Stef Nys, who said he saw the
man shoot himself and fall, his
dentures popping loose. "The most
scary part was when people started
to panic."
The man muttered something
about Egypt seconds before he
began shooting at about 5 p.m. on
the observation deck of one of the
world's best-known tourist sites,
witnesses said.
Abu Kamal used a .380-caliber
handgun which he apparently
bought in Florida at the end of

January, Giuliani said.
Police weren't sure of the signif
icance of his remarks about Egypt.
A city police terrorist task force
and FBI agents were investigating,
Giuliani said. Police Commissioner
Howard Safir said the shooter
apparently acted alone.
The other dead man was a 27-
year-old Danish musician visiting
the Empire State Building with an
American friend from Connecti
cut, who was also wounded. Giu
liani said.
The others wounded included a
French couple from Verdun,
whose 16-year-old daughter
escaped injury; a 30-year-old Swiss
man; an Argentinian man, 52; and
a man from the Bronx. One of the
wounded men was shot in the
head, while others were less seri
ously hurt.
Two children were hurt when
they were knocked from parents'
arms, and four women suffered
minor injuries in the rush to the
exit.
"I'd been out there about one
minute when I heard what I
thought to be firecrackers," said
David Robinson, a tourist from
England. "Then everyone started
panicking."
New York temperatures were in
the 40s yesterday and visibility
from the deck was 10 miles, bring
ing a large crowd of visitors to the
landmark.
