Overwhelming support
for Gupta should be
heeded in tenure review

A REMARKABLE THING
/\ happened to Asst. Anthro-
Prof. Akhil Gupta
after he was denied tenure on Jan.
6: The nation took notice.
After all, it is not every day that
faculty from some of the top uni
versities send letters of surprise
and outrage in support of an over
looked scholar. It is not everyday
that a sizeable number of students
form an organization such as the
bluntly-titled Ad Hoc Committee
for the Tenure of Akhil Gupta.
Protests coming from both inside
and outside the University praising
the quality and depth of Gupta's
teaching and scholarly work do
more than just make a case for
Gupta as a leader in cultural anthro
pology. They forcefully pose the
question: Why wasn't Gupta given
tenure? And according to the infor
mation known to the public, this
question is a difficult one to answer.
More than 100 letters support
ing Gupta have come from scholars
at institutions including Columbia
University, UC-Berkeley and the
University of Chicago. In describ
ing Gupta, whose work deals with
applying theoretical aspects of
anthropology to empirical prob
lems, Michael Watts, director of
UC-Berkeley's Institute for Inter
national Studies, called him "the
central figure in a relatively new
and important field." Chicago
Anthropology Prof. John Comaroff
said Gupta's work would make "a
strong case for tenure anywhere in
the world."
Many other letters sent to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice
admitted shock at Gupta's denial,
given that the Anthropolgy Depart
ment tenure committee unanimous
ly recommended him. Some even

feared that the denial signified hos
tility toward the diverse intellectual
trends Gupta's work represents.
Closer to home, both undergrad
uates and graduate students have
embarked on their own letter-writ
ing campaign and created a World
Wide Web page devoted to Gupta's
tenure tribulations. Impressed by
Gupta's interdisciplinary work,
which has led him to teach in such
diverse programs as modern
thought and literature and science,
technology and society, students
have publicly questioned the proce
dures and criteria used to deny
Gupta tenure.
Despite all the doubt, Stanford's
procedure for granting tenure
appears a thorough one. In Gupta's
case, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven and his four
associate deans, after consultation
with an advisory committee com
posed of senior faculty members, all
came to the final decision. Such a
strong and experienced body, one
would think, should protect against
irrational or unsupported decisions.
But the fact is that no one other
than Shoven and the other deans
knows what criteria were used to
reach the Gupta decision. And
although these criteria would most
likely reveal the cause of Gupta's
denial, it is inappropriate for the
community to call for this informa
tion. According to administration
officials, making public a tenure
committee's report is unheard of not
only at Stanford but at every univer
sity nationwide. Such a revelation
could, in fact, unduly hurt Gupta's
chances for tenure in the future.
What then should be expected
from the deans when they consider
Gupta's appeal? The committee
must strongly heed the over
whelming backing Gupta has
received from peers across the
country. A scholar whose work is
deemed revolutionary and signifi
cant must be given the utmost
attention. Without any public evi
dence to refute his claim for
tenure, every step should be taken
not to allow Gupta to slip away.
