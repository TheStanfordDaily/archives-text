Junky gym equipment doesn't help athletic reputation

AS LONGTIME MEMBERS of the
Stanford community, it has given
us great pride over the years to
admire the unprecedented successes of
Stanford athletics.
Stanford is blessed with a never-end
ing pantheon of hero-athletes and a
cadre of administrators who ably serve
them. While the Stanford community
has always had a reputation for enjoying
and participating in sports, the stellar
accomplishments of Stanford athletics
intensifies the sportsmen and women in
all of us.
It is thus especially frustrating, here
at this self-described "Champion of
Champions," to endure the sorry state of

Stanford's (non-varsity) weight room
equipment. The Arrillaga Family Sports
Center is a beautiful, state-of-the-art
complex made possible by one of Stan
ford's distinguished benefactors, builder
John Arrillaga. But after the center was
erected, the Athletics Department took a
stale-wine-in-new-bottles approach to its
new weight room, stocking the gym with
much of the same ragged equipment
that has been plaguing Stanford stu
dents for years. A visit to the weight
room in Arrillaga reveals antiquated,
imbalanced exercise bikes and Nautilus
machines that were already rusty and
frayed when we arrived at Stanford 10
years ago.

Meanwhile, across the campus at the
decrepit Roble weight room, one finds,
amid mold and decay, a rusty Universal
machine and wobbly, non-functional
exercise bikes, some with handlebars
wrapped in medical tape. Is this what
the Stanford community deserves? More
important, is this a legal liability?
Over the years, we have each visited
gyms near and far. Given Stanford's
athletic greatness and vast endowment,
does it seem right that we have discov
ered far better weight-room equipment
in such unlikely locales as a tiny rural
college in Arkansas, a public high school
in New Jersey, a Ramada Inn in Fresno
and — worst of all — UC-Berkeley?

Our proposal: The University should
devote a small percentage of its annual
budget for a one-time, thorough renova
tion of non-varsity athletic equipment. If
it would expedite the acquisition of
decent equipment, members of the Stan
ford community might even consider
paying a small quarterly membership
fee.
But as it now stands, while other
schools have weight rooms outfitted by
Cybex and Soloflex, ours will remain the
junk of Sanford & Son.
