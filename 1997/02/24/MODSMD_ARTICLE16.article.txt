## Where my heart resides 
### 
AS I WRITE this, the cable car is
clanging its way past my window,
Rice-a-Roni advertisements and
all. Two Chinese teen-agers are setting
off firecrackers in front of their house
and scurrying back inside to watch them
explode and see the old ladies carrying
their groceries jump. And one of my
roommates is coming home from the
Doo Wash Cafe, our laundromat where
they show movies all night and serve
bagels all day.
I live off campus. Far enough off cam
pus. In San Francisco. I didn't plan to
live here, exactly. I had a. year ■ of pre
ferred housing unexpecttMMy tSken away
for being a kitchen manager* So I would
have moved off campus anyway. And I
am biased; I do not like Palo Alto, have
never liked the cloyingly sterile nature
of it, the privileged stance of it which
borders on hostility.
But I was talking about San Francis
co, where two friends, both of whom had
graduated, had wanted to move. And
where a close friend, who was NYU
bound for his doctorate, had left a beau
tiful empty apartment.
I am not exactly sure how all of it
happened, but now I have a landlady
and a commute and non-University
issued furniture. (Most of it actually
comes from old hotels. I met a man in a
really expensive furniture store south of

Market, who sent me to a much cheaper
store where they get some of the furni
ture from the area hotels.)
The allure of it is unquestionable.
Some of it is Tales of the City, I admit.
We live near Macondray Lane, the basis
for Armistead Maupin's lovely Barbary
Lane stories, and more than once, I have
half-expected to run into Maryann and
Michael eating omelets at Mama's Girl
or Mrs. Madrigal shopping for merlot at
Molinari's. But more, it is a city built on
a whimsical premise — who would ever
put up a city that straddles a fault line?
And it is a romantic cit.VJioJ ju§t in the
tvay it looks when the fog is rolling in or
when the sun 1 is exploding in the dusk
but because it is filled with non-natives
who have come here for the chance to
reinvent themselves or to just be whoev
er they find that they are.
I do not think of my life as particular
ly glamorous, but I have a hard time
explaining that to anyone who lives at
Stanford. I have never claimed to be
much of an expert on anything, but sud
denly, I have been proclaimed some sort
of city guru, knower of shortcuts and
undiscovered restaurants and the like.
In fairness, all San Franciscans seem to
be having this conversation constantly.
Eavesdrop on any random couple and
they'll probably be fighting over the
fastest way to travel on city streets

(Franklin, north-south; Pine, east
west), the best used bookstore (as if I'd
tell), the best burrito (Taqueria Cancun,
Mission at 19th). Things I never think
of as terrifically interesting — where I
buy my bread, how I get to the freeway
— seem to be endlessly fascinating top
ics of conversation. It is fun to be an
expert on something, even if my exper
tise is chiefly a result of being some
where that other people are not.
,JU ib that slippage, the space between
Palo Alto and San Francisco that seems
so interesting. I think about it often,
especially when I take the 280 home and
run into the view of the skyline each
time. The ends of my commute are so
different that it's strange to think of
inhabiting both of them within the day's
course. And it's even stranger to be in
the same place I've been for three years
and to be calling somewhere else home.
There are tales of a whole other city
which have made up the bulk of my
Stanford experience. But for now and
for the foreseeable future, I am here and
I am home.
