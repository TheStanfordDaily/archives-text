# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## And now a conscience-soothing word from our sponsors 
### 
Anyone who has seen
"Schindler's List" knows it to be a
tremendous tale of the evil, as well
as the good, people can do. Although set
in the darkest period of our human histo
ry, it is a story that has the power to
uplift and inspire. Oskar Schindler was a
normal, unimpressive man who was able
to follow his conscience, without regard
for the consequences, without outside
help or support and without any concern
for his own fate or well-being.
Last night, he even did it without com
mercials.
Now, please, I'm not making light of
anything here. I'm just saying that I, for
one, was happy to see that this story was
respected in an arena where nothing is
holy. After all, we live in an age when even
the recent Chinese New Year celebration
had major corporate sponsorship. And
everybody knows that advertisers on TV
can be more audacious than others in their
attempts to champion their commodities.
These people are selfish. These are

people who have no problem whatsoever
disturbing your favorite program to
bother you with their favorite product. If
you were watching, say, "The X-Files,"
and a girl you don't know leaned over to
tell you about her not-so-fresh feeling,
you'd leave her sitting alone with Mulder
and Scully before she could say "Massen
gil." But somehow, if that girl's on TV,
it's only to be expected. These people are
shameless, too. I didn't have the chance
to see the tragic made-for-TV tale of Jon
estown when it first aired, but I'll bet
there was at least one ad for Kool-Aid.
So, naturally, you should all have
applauded last night's commercial-free
screening of this Holocaust epic —
assuming, of course, that you could over
look the fact it was brought to you by the
Ford Motor Co., the company brought to
you by Henry Ford, the man famous for
his large-scale, assembly-line mass pro
duction of anti-Semitism.
At first, this seems like a clever but
expensive idea for one sponsor. But if you

stop and think about it . . . even with
advertisers being as they are, what kind
of commercials could they really run dur
ing a gut-wrenching Holocaust drama
anyway? Certainly not the normal run
of-the-mill rubbish:
Perky-Smiley-TV-Spokesperson:
Hi! Has this ever happened to you?
Wishful washing wife: (Pulling
wineglasses out of the dishwasher.) Oh
no, honey! The guests will be here in 10
minutes and these glasses are ... SPOT
TY!
Harried hurried husband: Spotty
glasses? Shmotty glasses! I've got dish
pan hands! (He wrings his hands and
grimaces.)
Distraught daughter: (Running in,
pointing to red magic-marker dot on her
forehead.) Mom! Dad! Richie's party is
tonight and I have the world's biggest
ZIT!
Sulking son: And I've got ring
around-the-collar! Why can't we have
Stove Top like the Watsons?

Nosy neighbor: (Entering, one half
of his head is covered with Denorex, the
other with the leading name-brand. He
points to his left hemisphere.) Hey, this
side tingles!
Drunken former pro athletes:
Tastes great!
More drunken former pro ath
letes including Bubba Smith: Less
filling!
Neighbor: This side — no tingle!
Wife: Oh no! The guests will be here
in 10 minutes, my dishes are spotty, and
there are 50 drunken former pro athletes
in my kitchen! Calgon, take me away!
[Ding-dong! Rumble, rumble. Boom,
crash!]
Everybody: Hey! Kool-Aid!!
No, the old push of promoting prod
ucts as quick-fixes to everyday problems
may not have the same effect on
Schindler's audience. Against a backdrop
of Nazi atrocities, you're just not going to
make a good argument for antiseptics or
sell a lot of Sudafed.

Whatever the motivations, it's nice to
see some things left well-enough alone.
Granted, TV commercials may very well
be important in everyday life. Without
them, people wouldn't be able to run to
the kitchen or the bathroom without
missing anything, and a lot of people
would be less likely to watch the Super
Bowl. And some of the products being
pushed are valuable, making everyday
life a little more convenient or agreeable.
Nevertheless, sometimes, it's a good
idea to do things a little differently. Some
things are more important than just
what's important right now. And some
stories are important enough to be told
without interruption.

Victor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, would like to thank all the com
mercial sponsors whose support made
this column possible.
