## Women crush Huskies; men lose battle in Seattle Emotionally charged seniors lead wire-to-wire domination 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Senior forward Kate Starbird
became Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer.
Fellow seniors Jamila Wide
man, Charmin Smith and Tara
Harrington teamed up for 17
points and 11 assists in their
final regular-season game in
Maples Pavilion before a sellout
crowd of 7,391.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Kristin Folkl scored 12 points
and grabbed 10 rebounds in only
her second game back.
The Washington Huskies
never had a chance.
They were nothing more than
bit players in arguably the finest
hour Maples Pavilion has ever
hosted. Starbird finally passed
Val Whiting's record of 2,077
points on a signature acrobatic,
open-court layup with 18 min
utes, 1 second to go in the game
before finishing the contest with
21 points.
As for the game, the third
ranked Cardinal (27-1, 15-0
Pacific 10 Conference) rode the
emotion of this special evening
to run Washington (13-10, 8-6)
out of the building by a resound
ing 106-76 margin. With the
win, Stanford clinched at least a
share of its eighth Pac-10 title
and became the first team to
garner an automatic bid to next
month's NCAA tournament.
"I thought it was a really
good team effort," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It was really special to have
your four seniors introduced,
and you like to almost enjoy that
but you can't. You have to turn
around and get right into your
game."
Get into it they did, as four
Stanford players hit double fig
ures, led by junior center
Olympia Scott's 23 points.
Junior forward Vanessa Nygaard
hit four straight threes on her to
way to 17 points in the first 10
minutes of play, helping the Car
dinal race to an electrifying 24-

point lead, 30-6.
"I was very emotional before
the game because these are the
people I came in with," Nygaard
said of the four seniors. "They
were leaving me open, but it was
for the love of my teammates. I
was so glad to be out there."
With the Cardinal establish
ing such a comfortable lead, it
was simply a case of getting
Starbird her record. The
Huskies still made a valiant run,
getting within 13 at the 2:30
mark, no thanks to sophomore
guard Jamie Redd. She contin
ued her ball-hogging, gunning
style, taking ridiculous shots
and turning the ball over five
times in the first half. Sopho
more forward Amber Hall was
able to keep them in the game
with 14 points and 10 rebounds
in the opening 20 minutes.
But redshirt sophomore cen
ter Chandra Benton nailed a
short hook in the paint and then
made the fans fall out of their
chairs when she nailed a three
pointer at the top of the key that
opened it back up to a 51-33 lead
with 1:22 to go.
Adding to the Huskies' woes
was the great play of Folkl. After
a nervous two-point, six
rebound performance Thursday,
Folkl was considerably more
assertive Saturday. She consis
tently drew her defender out to
the perimeter before blowing
past them for either an easy
layup or a two-shot foul. She
had eight quick points in 11
minutes of play in the half while
also playing some center, yet
another wrinkle that opponents
will have to contend with.
The first half was capped off
in dramatic fashion as Starbird
took a sweetly placed lead pass
from freshman guard Milena
Flores for a buzzer-beating
breakaway layup that tied the
record and gave the Cardinal a
54-38 halftime lead.
The fans had to wait less
than two minutes in the second

half as Pelz forced a bad pass to
Starbird, and the player of the
year candidate was off to the
races.
With one dashing move, Star
bird would cement her place in
history and provide a moment
never to be forgotten. The fact
that Redd fouled her on the shot
was an irrelevant fact lost in the
thunderous standing ovation. It
only stopped play long enough to
recognize one of the all-time
greats as she calmly completed
the three-point play good for a
59-38 Stanford lead.
The other seniors fed off the
emotion and got into the act as
Smith stole the ensuing inbounds
pass and nailed a 19-footer. She
stole the inbounds pass again,
and it led to Wideman's driving
layup. Smith capped off this
dizzying run with a three-point
shot to bury Washington in a 66-
38 hole.
It was over.
The Huskies tried to swim
through the emotional tide and
could do little but watch their
own native daughter spearhead
their nemesis to a dominating
victory. Starbird finally sat down
with a little more than six min
utes to go and the Cardinal
ahead by 37 points. The fourth
senior, forward Tara Harring
ton, made her 101st appearance
a memorable one by taking a
pass from Smith and hitting a
long trey with 10 minutes left in
the game.
The bench got into the act as
well, as junior forward Paula
McNamee put the Cardinal over
the century mark with a short
jumper, marking the second time
she has done so this year. Fresh
man guard Christina Batastini
capped off the scoring with a
three-pointer off the inbounds
pass from fellow freshman
Melody Peterson.
But while the rookies provided
a window into the future, the
focus was on the seniors, who
leave a fine legacy for the likes of
Peterson, Batastini and Flores to
follow.
"I'm really happy for the
seniors and what they brought to
the program," VanDerveer said.
"But I don't think they're satis
fied. I think this just gives them a
taste of what we're really work
ing for."
