# Wender welcomes new responsibilities

### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
When Jacqueline Wender found a temporary
secretarial job at Stanford in the early 1980s, she
had no idea she would become the University
President's primary representative 15 years later.
But since then, she has "taken to University
administration"; she replaced Jean Fetter as the
assistant to University President Gerhard Casper
on Jan. 1.
Wender entered Stanford as an undergraduate
in 1974 intending to study political science. How
ever, after almost completing the requirements
for that degree, she switched to the Drama De
partment, from which she eventually graduated.
Working in theater production, Wender be
came the assistant prop master at the American
Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. But one
year later, "it became painfully clear" to her that
she had not found a permanent career.
Wender felt a need to start over, so she re
turned to the University, where she had occasion
ally worked as a secretary.

In 1982, she secured a perma
nent position as an assistant to
the dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
"I thought I was going to be
here for two years," she recalled.
"I've stayed here ever sinoe."
According to Wender, Univer
sity administration is "a fasci
nating place to work," and the
range of issues it covers is "re-

markable." She expressed no aspirations to
change her profession.
Wender met Casper soon after his arrival at
Stanford while she was working in the Office of
Development. They worked together on several
projects, including the reconstruction of Green Li
brary and the creation of the Science and Engi
neering Quad.
"A man with a wonderful sense of humor," a
"delightful colleague" and a "deep thinker,"
Casper "makes it easy" to work with him, Wender
said.
Due to Casper's visibility, his office must deal

with many issues, some of which can be resolved
without the president's direct participation. Ac
cording to Wender, "as much as possible will be
done without directly involving (Casper]."
"We are here to serve the University and make
it work well," she said. "I hope everyone realizes
how open this door is."
Wender stressed that individuals seeking as
sistance will find it most expedient to seek resolu
tion in places closely related to the issue in ques
tion. The President's Office is "something of the
last resort."
"Where we can be most effective is providing
assistance to those who worked up the steps and
failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion," Wender
said, adding that she may need to serve as a "di
rectory service" to those who come to the Presi
dent's Office before pursuing other channels.
liecause the breadth of topics that comes be
fore the President's Office is "enormous," so is the
range of her tasks, Wender said.
In addition, Wender has the specific duties of


Wender
meeting with campus visitors and
other individuals on Casper's be
half. Her responsibilities also in
clude working on the allocation of
presidential funds and involvement
with appointments to University
committees.
The assistant's job changed
somewhat when Wender was ap

pointed, she said.
The Ombudsperson's Office and
the Sexual Harassment Policy Of
fice will now report to Sally Dickson
in the Office of Campus Relations in
stead of to her.
Also, Stanford Events will report
jointly to Wender and Director of
University Communications Terry
Shepard, whose title will now in
clude assistant to the president.
In a general sense, Wender will
deal with internal affairs while
Shepard will work with individuals

and groups outside the University,
she explained.
The changes will give her an op
portunity to provide more support
for Casper and to focus on improv
ing the process of University com
mittee appointments, Wender said.
Due to staff reductions, nomina
tions to the committees have be
come decentralized in recent years.
According to Wender, a return to a
centralized system is unlikely, but
the lines of communication must be
clarified and strengthened.
