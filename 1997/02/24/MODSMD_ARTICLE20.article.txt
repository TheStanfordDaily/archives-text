# Women in Bruin Classic
## Golf faces grueling test 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Senior Mhairi McKay, the Cardinal's
top-seeded woman golfer, has never played
36 holes of a collegiate tournament in one
day.
She will get the chance today when the
Stanford women's golf team faces a double
whammy at the Pioneer Electronic Bruin
Classic in Los Angeles. The team will play
the third and final round tomorrow.
While men's college golf often play two
rounds in a day, it is more atypical for
women's tournaments. But with the advent
of more events and a limited number of
NCAA playing days, more sponsors are dou
bling up the number of rounds per day.
The physical demands of playing back-to
back rounds will test the Card's endurance.
"Maybe we'll be tired," McKay said.
Maybe? Playing 11 to 12 hours straight is
grueling.
While head coach Caroline O'Connor will
be on hand to drive a golf cart stocked with
revitalizing Power Bars, nothing can be
done for sore feet and sore backs from lug
ging a 30-pound golf bag, said sophomore
Michelle Sperry.

While the Card adjusts to competing two
rounds in a day, the six-member team also
faces a major setback with senior Andrea
Baxter's absence. Baxter broke her wrist in
a weekend snowboarding accident and will
be out for a majority of the season.
Without Baxter, each player will need to
step their game up a notch. O'Connor isn't
daunted by the challenge the team faces.
"This is going to be good for the players,"
she said. "Instead of relying on the two
seniors, it'll force them to knock off a stroke
or two."
While the Card has not played the
Menifee Lakes Golf Course in five years, the
dry conditions of the course will serve as an
advantage to some players.
Freshman Julie Dunn, who hails from
Las Vegas where the courses are more arid,
likes dry courses because her balls drive
longer.
With three top-10 finishes this season,
Dunn adds strength in her long game. Dunn
rips her tee drives, averaging 250 yards on
dry courses. The average distance is less
than 200 yards.
Dunn, at 5-foot-10, is arguably the
