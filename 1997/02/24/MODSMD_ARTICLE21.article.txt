# Stanford sees tourney hopes begin dimming with sixth Pac-10 loss

### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — If No. 20 Stanford is to take any
consolation from its trip to Washington this past
weekend, it is this: At least it doesn't have to do
that again.
The Cardinal (16-7, 9-6 Pacific 10 Conference),
in its final Pac-10 road trip of the season, ended
the weekend the same way it has most of its away
games this season — in defeat. Ice cold from out
side and unable to counter the inside presence of
7-foot center Todd MacCulloch, Stanford failed to
follow up on Thursday night's win over Washing
ton State and instead suffered a 75-61 beating at
the hands of Washington (15-8, 8-6) Saturday
afternoon.
If there are any reliable strengths for this Stan
ford team, they were nowhere to be found Satur
day at Hec Edmundson Pavilion:
• Brevin Knight. The All-American point guard
is normally a one-man contingency plan, creating
opportunities even when the rest of the Cardinal
is struggling, but Saturday the senior could offer
the Stanford offense no relief. The 5-foot-10
Knight suffered through one of his worst perfor
mances of the season, shooting a horrific 3-of-16
from the field for just eight points.
• Tim Young. The redshirt sophomore center
can usually be counted on for rebounds and a tow
ering defensive presence even when his offensive
game is off, but Saturday he was thoroughly dom
inated by Husky big man MacCulloch and was
benched less than three minutes into the second
half.
• Perimeter shooting. Sharp-shooting sopho
more Kris Weems, despite totaling a team-high 12
points, was mostly a non-factor, making just 5-of
-14 from the field. Sophomore Arthur Lee, who in
recent games has shown a knack for coming
through in the clutch, was also unable to deliver,
scoring just three baskets on the afternoon and
missing all five of his three-point attempts.
• Rebounding. Stanford was out-rebounded
Saturday for just the third time in Pac-10 play,
and this time it wasn't even close. 49-33.
Add it all up, and you've got the Cardinal's sec
ond-worst loss of the season.
"It was just one of those nights," Knight said.
"I just couldn't get it done."
"We got whipped pretty good," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. We pretty much
got dominated at the post and couldn't shoot it
from out. That's not a good combination."
The score was tied 31-31 at halftime, but Mac-
