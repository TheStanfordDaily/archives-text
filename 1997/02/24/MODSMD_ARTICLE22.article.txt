# Sluggers' comeback avoids sweep
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Stanford baseball's newest enemy: UC-Santa Barbara's
senior designated hitter David Willis.
Willis, with three home runs and seven RBIs, led his
Gauchos squad this weekend in taking two of three from
the fourth-ranked Cardinal (11-6). UC-Santa Barbara (8-6)
took Friday's game 6-4 and won 10-8 Saturday before blow
ing a five-run lead and losing 12-7 yesterday.
Friday night's game was all about the Gaucho cleanup
hitter. He put Santa Barbara on the scoreboard early when
he stung a pitch from junior pitcher Kyle Peterson far over
the left-field fence and just inside the foul line for a three
run dinger.
"That ball didn't look like it was going to stop," said
freshman infielder John Gall. "That ball was hit far, far,
far."
After the Cardinal tried to answer in the bottom of the
third with one run, Willis stepped to the plate again for the
Gauchos. This time, the outcome was no different as he
slapped another bomb for his fourth and fifth RBIs of the
evening, bringing the score to 5-1. A two-run home run by
senior Chris Clark brought the Cardinal to within one at 5-
4, but that was as close as the team would get.
Peterson — who dropped to 2-1 — pitched admirably
when he wasn't facing Willis. He struck out 14 and walked
only three in 8 1/3 innings of work.

"Peterson pitched well. It's a shame we couldn't get
more going offensively for him," said head coach Mark Mar
quess.
The Card failed to exact payment Saturday in the second
game against the streaking Gauchos, losing 10-8.
Santa Barbara wasted little time lighting up the score
board. In the top of the first, Willis came back for more.
This time, he smacked a two-run home run off sophomore
starter Jeff Austin.
However, the Cardinal was able to answer m the bottom
of the first. After junior second baseman Joe Kilburg's sin
gle, freshman right fielder Edmund Muth creamed the ball
to right field for a towering home run, tying the score at
two.
But the game didn't remain a tight one for long. To start
the top of the third, senior Gaucho center fielder Joe Kem
per got a hold of Austin's second offering, sending the ball
into the afternoon horizon, running the score to 3-2.
The bleeding didn't stop there. With no outs, sophomore
outfielder Brad Wright bounced a fast chopper up the mid
dle. Kilburg, ranging to his right, lunged at the ball, but it
bounced oft his wrist, and Wright safely ran through first.
Then, when junior shortstop Michael Young's grounder
found a hole between third and shortstop and rolled into
the outfield, there were runners on first and second and no
outs.
To make things worse, who
should march his 6-foot-5, 240-
pound frame to the plate but Car
dinal-killer Willis.
Austin was noticeably frazzled.
His first pitch, a strike, was
dropped by junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer and allowed the runners
to advance to second and third.
His next pitch was a wild one, but
Schaeffer pounced on the ball to
prevent the runners from advanc
ing further.
Austin, however, was able to set
tle down and concentrate. His next
pitch, taken for a strike, brought
the count to 1-2. He then induced
Willis to swing at a low and outside
pitch for strike three. One out.
The overt threat had been con
quered. But with only one out, the
Gauchos proved they didn't need
their big bopper to trample the
Cardinal.
After intentionally walking
junior outfielder Justin Balser to
load the bases, Austin nursed a
long lazy fly ball from sophomore
second baseman and former Stan
ford transfer Bryan LaCour that
allowed Wright to score. Two outs,
the score now at 4-2, and runners
on first and second.
Then things fell apart. A quick
single scored one, then a three-run

home run by senior first baseman
Brooks Morris scored three more
and put the finishing touches on a
six-run inning that made it 8-2.
The Cardinal, fighting back,
was able to tie the score at 8-8
after scoring two in the fifth and
three in the sixth. But Santa Bar
bara wasn't done and added two
more in the seventh on a LaCour
double to put the Card away 10-8.
Despite the final scores, Mar
quess stressed that the Cardinal
came close in both of the losses.
"We had opportunities. I was
pleased by the way we battled in
both the games. We really had a
chance to win all of them," he said.
In yesterday's game, that
chance was finally realized as the
Cardinal fought back to a 12-7 vic
tory over the Gauchos.
Echoing a pattern found in all
three games this weekend, Santa
Barbara got on the board first
with a three-run home run off
sophomore starter Chad Hutchin
son in the top of the second.
Hutchinson couldn't settle
down. With two outs, third base
man Justin Gemoll lined a single
into short left. After stealing sec
ond safely, he went to third on a
high fast chopper that eluded
Stanford's Jeffßizzo and put run
ners on the corners. A double past
a diving Jody Gerut and into the
gap made the score 5-0.
But the Cardinal fought back
and by the seventh had brought

First, freshmen Nick Day and
Craig Thompson walked, each on
four pitches. Then, sophomore
infielder Josh Hochgesang began
the scoring by lining a single over
second, sending Day home and
Thompson to third.
Against a fresh Gaucho pitcher,
stopper John Minton, sophomore
designated hitter John Salter tried
to halt his swing in mid-stride, but
the ball hit his bat and lofted slow
ly over the second baseman for a
single, sending another runner
home to tie the game at 7-7.
After another run had scored

rolled a grounder through the gap

two RBIs, making the score 9-7.
"The difference between our

earn the win.
"Our relievers played a great
series: Hoard, (Tony) Cogan and

"Our starters could have done bet

should march his 6-foot-5, 240-
pound frame to the plate but Car
dinal-killer Willis.
Austin was noticeably frazzled.
His first pitch, a strike, was
dropped by junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer and allowed the runners
to advance to second and third.
His next pitch was a wild one, but
Schaeffer pounced on the ball to
prevent the runners from advanc
ing further.
Austin, however, was able to set
tle down and concentrate. His next
pitch, taken for a strike, brought
the count to 1-2. He then induced
Willis to swing at a low and outside
pitch for strike three. One out.
The overt threat had been con
quered. But with only one out, the
Gauchos proved they didn't need
their big bopper to trample the
Cardinal.
After intentionally walking
junior outfielder Justin Balser to
load the bases, Austin nursed a
long lazy fly ball from sophomore
second baseman and former Stan
ford transfer Bryan LaCour that
allowed Wright to score. Two outs,
the score now at 4-2, and runners
on first and second.
Then things fell apart. A quick
single scored one, then a three-run

home run by senior first baseman
Brooks Morris scored three more
and put the finishing touches on a
six-run inning that made it 8-2.
The Cardinal, fighting back,
was able to tie the score at 8-8
after scoring two in the fifth and
three in the sixth. But Santa Bar
bara wasn't done and added two
more in the seventh on a LaCour
double to put the Card away 10-8.
Despite the final scores, Mar
quess stressed that the Cardinal
came close in both of the losses.
"We had opportunities. I was
pleased by the way we battled in
both the games. We really had a
chance to win all of them," he said.
In yesterday's game, that
chance was finally realized as the
Cardinal fought back to a 12-7 vic
tory over the Gauchos.
Echoing a pattern found in all
three games this weekend, Santa
Barbara got on the board first
with a three-run home run off
sophomore starter Chad Hutchin
son in the top of the second.
Hutchinson couldn't settle
down. With two outs, third base
man Justin Gemoll lined a single
into short left. After stealing sec
ond safely, he went to third on a
high fast chopper that eluded
Stanford's Jeffßizzo and put run

a diving Jody Gerut and into the
gap made the score 5-0.

First, freshmen Nick Day and
Craig Thompson walked, each on
four pitches. Then, sophomore
infielder Josh Hochgesang began
the scoring by lining a single over
second, sending Day home and
Thompson to third.
Against a fresh Gaucho pitcher,

single, sending another runner

Stanford baseball's newest enemy: UC-Santa Barbara's
senior designated hitter David Willis.
Willis, with three home runs and seven RBIs, led his
Gauchos squad this weekend in taking two of three from
the fourth-ranked Cardinal (11-6). UC-Santa Barbara (8-6)
took Friday's game 6-4 and won 10-8 Saturday before blow
ing a five-run lead and losing 12-7 yesterday.
Friday night's game was all about the Gaucho cleanup
hitter. He put Santa Barbara on the scoreboard early when
he stung a pitch from junior pitcher Kyle Peterson far over
the left-field fence and just inside the foul line for a three
run dinger.
"That ball didn't look like it was going to stop," said
freshman infielder John Gall. "That ball was hit far, far,
far."
After the Cardinal tried to answer in the bottom of the
third with one run, Willis stepped to the plate again for the
Gauchos. This time, the outcome was no different as he
slapped another bomb for his fourth and fifth RBIs of the
evening, bringing the score to 5-1. A two-run home run by
senior Chris Clark brought the Cardinal to within one at 5-
4, but that was as close as the team would get.
Peterson — who dropped to 2-1 — pitched admirably
when he wasn't facing Willis. He struck out 14 and walked
only three in 8 1/3 innings of work.

"Peterson pitched well. It's a shame we couldn't get
more going offensively for him," said head coach Mark Mar
quess.
The Card failed to exact payment Saturday in the second
game against the streaking Gauchos, losing 10-8.
Santa Barbara wasted little time lighting up the score
board. In the top of the first, Willis came back for more.
This time, he smacked a two-run home run off sophomore
starter Jeff Austin.
However, the Cardinal was able to answer m the bottom
of the first. After junior second baseman Joe Kilburg's sin
gle, freshman right fielder Edmund Muth creamed the ball
to right field for a towering home run, tying the score at
two.
But the game didn't remain a tight one for long. To start
the top of the third, senior Gaucho center fielder Joe Kem
per got a hold of Austin's second offering, sending the ball
into the afternoon horizon, running the score to 3-2.
The bleeding didn't stop there. With no outs, sophomore
outfielder Brad Wright bounced a fast chopper up the mid
dle. Kilburg, ranging to his right, lunged at the ball, but it
bounced oft his wrist, and Wright safely ran through first.
Then, when junior shortstop Michael Young's grounder
found a hole between third and shortstop and rolled into
the outfield, there were runners on first and second and no
outs.
To make things worse, who
should march his 6-foot-5, 240-
pound frame to the plate but Car
dinal-killer Willis.

home run by senior first baseman
Brooks Morris scored three more
and put the finishing touches on a
six-run inning that made it 8-2.
The Cardinal, fighting back,
was able to tie the score at 8-8
after scoring two in the fifth and
three in the sixth. But Santa Bar
bara wasn't done and added two
more in the seventh on a LaCour
double to put the Card away 10-8.
Despite the final scores, Mar
quess stressed that the Cardinal
came close in both of the losses.
"We had opportunities. I was
pleased by the way we battled in
both the games. We really had a
chance to win all of them," he said.
In yesterday's game, that
chance was finally realized as the
Cardinal fought back to a 12-7 vic
tory over the Gauchos.
Echoing a pattern found in all
three games this weekend, Santa
Barbara got on the board first
with a three-run home run off
sophomore starter Chad Hutchin
son in the top of the second.
Hutchinson couldn't settle
down. With two outs, third base
man Justin Gemoll lined a single
into short left. After stealing sec
ond safely, he went to third on a
high fast chopper that eluded
Stanford's Jeffßizzo and put run
ners on the corners. A double past
a diving Jody Gerut and into the
gap made the score 5-0.
But the Cardinal fought back
and by the seventh had brought

itself to within two at 7-5.
First, freshmen Nick Day and
Craig Thompson walked, each on
four pitches. Then, sophomore
infielder Josh Hochgesang began
the scoring by lining a single over
second, sending Day home and
Thompson to third.
Against a fresh Gaucho pitcher,
stopper John Minton, sophomore
designated hitter John Salter tried
to halt his swing in mid-stride, but
the ball hit his bat and lofted slow
ly over the second baseman for a
single, sending another runner
home to tie the game at 7-7.
After another run had scored
on a hard single by Kilburg, Gerut,
with runners at second and third,
rolled a grounder through the gap
between third and shortstop for
two RBIs, making the score 9-7.
"The difference between our
win, and the two losses was our
key hitting," Gall said. "The key
hits we got today really helped. We
weren't able to get them in the
first two games."
By the time the seventh ended,
Stanford was ahead 12-7. The lead
was never threatened as sopho
more reliever Brent Hoard (3-1)
pitched a scoreless final three
frames to close out the game and
earn the win.
"Our relievers played a great
series: Hoard, (Tony) Cogan and
(Josh) Koons," Marquess said.
"Our starters could have done bet
ter, though."
