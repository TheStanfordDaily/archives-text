Stanford baseball's newest enemy: UC-Santa Barbara's
senior designated hitter David Willis.
Willis, with three home runs and seven RBIs, led his
Gauchos squad this weekend in taking two of three from
the fourth-ranked Cardinal (11-6). UC-Santa Barbara (8-6)
took Friday's game 6-4 and won 10-8 Saturday before blow
ing a five-run lead and losing 12-7 yesterday.
Friday night's game was all about the Gaucho cleanup
hitter. He put Santa Barbara on the scoreboard early when
he stung a pitch from junior pitcher Kyle Peterson far over
the left-field fence and just inside the foul line for a three
run dinger.
"That ball didn't look like it was going to stop," said
freshman infielder John Gall. "That ball was hit far, far,
far."
After the Cardinal tried to answer in the bottom of the
third with one run, Willis stepped to the plate again for the
Gauchos. This time, the outcome was no different as he
slapped another bomb for his fourth and fifth RBIs of the
evening, bringing the score to 5-1. A two-run home run by
senior Chris Clark brought the Cardinal to within one at 5-
4, but that was as close as the team would get.
Peterson — who dropped to 2-1 — pitched admirably
when he wasn't facing Willis. He struck out 14 and walked
only three in 8 1/3 innings of work.

"Peterson pitched well. It's a shame we couldn't get
more going offensively for him," said head coach Mark Mar
quess.
The Card failed to exact payment Saturday in the second
game against the streaking Gauchos, losing 10-8.
Santa Barbara wasted little time lighting up the score
board. In the top of the first, Willis came back for more.
This time, he smacked a two-run home run off sophomore
starter Jeff Austin.
However, the Cardinal was able to answer m the bottom
of the first. After junior second baseman Joe Kilburg's sin
gle, freshman right fielder Edmund Muth creamed the ball
to right field for a towering home run, tying the score at
two.
But the game didn't remain a tight one for long. To start
the top of the third, senior Gaucho center fielder Joe Kem
per got a hold of Austin's second offering, sending the ball
into the afternoon horizon, running the score to 3-2.
The bleeding didn't stop there. With no outs, sophomore
outfielder Brad Wright bounced a fast chopper up the mid
dle. Kilburg, ranging to his right, lunged at the ball, but it
bounced oft his wrist, and Wright safely ran through first.
Then, when junior shortstop Michael Young's grounder
found a hole between third and shortstop and rolled into
the outfield, there were runners on first and second and no
outs.
