# Volleyball keeps Tigers at bay in ugly win
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Friday night at Burnham Pavilion, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team continued its win
ning ways at home, defeating 12th-ranked
Pacific 15-9,15-10,16-14. Although neither side
played all that well, the Cardinal got by one of
its main competitors for the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation's Pacific Division crown.
Pacific (8-3, 5-3 MPSF) came into Burnham
riding a high, having just beaten then-No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara and riding a three-match win
ning streak. In game one, the Cardinal (7-2, 5-2
MPSF) quickly showed them that a fourth
straight victory would be tough to come by.
Stanford seized control early on, marching out
to a quick lead, and, after allowing the Tigers to
hang around for a while, finally closing the
game out in convincing fashion 15-9.
In the second game, the Tigers appeared to
be ready to assert their control, getting off to a
5-1 advantage and leading 9-7 before Stanford
stormed back to tie the match at 9-9. After alter
nating points, Stanford sophomore Jeremy
Bart, a back row and serving specialist, came in.
Given the opportunity to serve, with Stanford

leading 11-10, Bart showed why head coach
Ruben Nieves brings him in to serve so often,
serving four straight points, and giving Stan
ford the game 15-10 and a 2-0 bulge in the
match.
In the third and final game, the Tigers once
again jumped out to a big early lead. Pacific led
early 5-1 and by as much as 10-3. After going
down 5-1, Stanford took out senior outside hit
ter Mike Lambert, the team's top player, and
replaced him with sophomore outside hitter
Patrick Klein. Seeing that this substitution did
little to help its chances, Stanford put l.ambert
back in the lineup at 10-3. Lambert, who had
struggled all match, led a stirring comeback. He
served to get Stanford sixth through ninth
points and generally provided leadership and
inspired play for the entire team.
However, despite Lambert's play, Stanford
found itself trailing 14-9 when senior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer stepped up to serve. Hoe
fer served very effectively, and the Card ran
off a string of five consecutive points to tie the
match at 14-14. After getting a sideout from
Pacific, senior outside hitter Matt Fuer
bringer got the 15th point on his serve, and
Lambert closed out the match, handing UOP

the loss 16-14 with his serve.
Although Stanford got a win, they did so in
unusual style. The Cardinal, perhaps the
nation's strongest hitting team, struggled, as
the Tigers held them to a slim .258 percentage,
about. 100 off of their season average. Lambert,
normally Stanford's most reliable offense, was
held to .152 hitting, and Stanford's highest hit
ter, Mike Hoefer, hit a measly .343.
Despite its poor offensive showing, Stanford
was able to get the win because it forced Pacific
to hit an even lower percentage, .080, the Cardi
nal's best defensive effort of the year. The
Tigers' top two hitters, senior outside hitter
Greg Wakeham, and freshman outside hitter
Vladimir Andric, hit minus-065 and minus
.os6, respectively, both amassing more errors
than kills.
"We didn't play all that well," Nieves said.
"Our hitting was really off tonight, but our
defense was very good. That is the real story of
the match. If Pacific had known that they would
make us hit .258, they would have been very
confident, expecting they would get a win.
"I was very pleased with how we contained

Wakeham and Andric, their big
guns. Our percentage was low
because we made a lot of errors on
our own, but Pacific still deserves
a lot of credit. They were tough to
hit against and really shut Lam
bert down in particular. It was an
ugly win, but it still is a win."
