# Rugby no match for bigger squad
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
After a season full of tiying to control the tempo and keeping
its opponents on their heels, the women's rugby team was run
all over the field by the University of Victoria in a 44-12 loss Sat
urday.
The British Columbia school easily outran and out-sized the
Cardinal. Victoria controlled the tempo and dictated the direc
tion of the game. The Vikings kept the ball away from the Car
dinal with strong blocking, then continued to protect their run
ners with quick realignment and reversals.
"We faced a very athletic and very good rugby team," said

'UC-Davis has some strong backs
so we're going to have to limit the
number of balls that they touch'
— Joe Clayton

head coach Franck Boivert. "They were much more athletic and
much stronger. The main problem was some very skilled play
ers at some key positions. They were excellent, top-class players.
"We're going to reassure them in their abilities now. They
played a much stronger team, but they hung in their tough.
They have to look at this game like a learning experience. There
is no reason for the team to be discouraged."
Junior Suzie Hoffman and freshman Karina Celaya each
scored one try for the Cardinal, which will focus more on defend
ing the ball and better realignment. Its main weakness against
the Vikings was an inability keep up with the ball and stop them
from easily moving downfield.
Also on Saturday, the men's second team defeated UC-Davis'
second squad 26-23. The third team fell to Davis 30-25.
The men's first team will face the Aggies today at 4:15 p.m.
on Maloney Field in its second league match of the season. The
men are coming off a loss against the University of British
Columbia in which Stanford was outrun, but their game strate
gy will have to be much different today.
"Pace isn't going to be that important," said senior captain
Joe Clayton. "UC-Davis has some strong backs so we're going to
have to limit the number of balls that they touch."
This will mean that the team will have to realign much faster
on offense. Against British Coulmbia, the men often drove the
ball to one side and were stuck because they were unable to
reverse their direction. If they do the same today, the Aggies
should be able to utilize their bigger size in the scrums.
They will also have to attack the ball incessantly on defense
to prevent Davis from utilizing strength downfield.
