# Men square off against Aztecs
## 
### 
A national ranking and a solid
showing in conference play don't
always translate into a high seed
come NCAA tournament selec
tion time. And that could be a
concern for Stanford, which has
no meaningful nonconference
victoriss to speak of, not to men
tion two totally meaningless vic
tories against Division II Alaska-
Anchorage (only wins against
Division I schools are considered
by the selection committee).
The good news is that the
Cardinal will get one last chance
to beef up its NCAA Tourna
ment resume tonight when it

meets San Diego State at 7:30 in
Maples Pavilion. With a con
vincing victory, Stanford hopes
to prove its prowess outside of
Pac-10 play and impress the
NCAA tournament selection
committee.
Tonight's matchup will also
serve as a tuneup for a critical
Pac-10 game against archrival
California (17-7, 10-5) Saturday
morning.
The Aztecs are 12-12 (4-10
Western Athletic Conference)
and in sixth place in Pacific Divi
sion of the WAC.
