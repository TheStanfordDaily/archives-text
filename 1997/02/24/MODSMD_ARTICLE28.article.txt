# Committee formed to encourage class communication
## 
### Alex Tung Contributing writer 
Student initiative has propelled the
formation of a new committee that aims
to strengthen class unity for upperclass
men.
One of the primary goals of the com
mittee on class identity is to provide stu
dents with opportunities to interact with
classmates. The committee — which has
yet to be named — also aims to improve
communications between student leaders
and agencies like the Stanford Fund and
the Alumni Association.
It is also considering various ways of
obtaining student input, said Dean ofStu

dents Marc Wais, one of the administra
tors on the committee. Means of achieving
this could include surveys, open forums
and focus groups.
The committee met for the first time
last Tuesday. Senior Class President
Nima Farzan, a founder, had originally
envisioned its formation as a subcommit
tee under the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion board.
In the committee's proposal, Farzan
explained, "I have heard many comments
like: 'I just don't feel a need to attend a se
nior class event... . I just don't feel a con
nection.' "
"I think a subcommittee consisting of
the student representatives to the board

as well as other, more experienced, board
members can provide the guidance and re
solve necessary to create a comprehensive
student program," Farzan wrote.
The committee will no longer be a part
of the Alumni Association board, accord
ing to Farzan, but will remain a "student
initiated steering committee under the
auspices of the class presidents" instead.
The group is especially targeting the
sophomore and junior classes, which
often have been subject to a "slump," ac
cording to Junior Class President Shan
non Waggonner, a committee member.
"Fall quarter of freshman year is really
exciting, but it kind of dies down by the
end of the year," she said. "In senior year

it starts up again, but
there's that two-year pe
riod where there's apathy
and a lack of unity."
Currently, the com
mittee includes three up
perclass presidents, a rep
resentative from the
freshman council of the
ASSU, representatives of
the Alumni Association

and a host of administrators, including
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds, Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid James Montoya and Wais. The com
mittee is working on recruiting a faculty
member to join the group.

The administration is "concerned
about the lack of class identity at Stanford
and [we] have been trying to determine
ways in which we can increase it," Ed
monds said. "Having the class presidents
involved with administrative staff to talk
about issues, concerns and ways in which
we can assist them is very positive, and I
applaud it."
Although many staff and administra
tors are involved, the committee is still
mostly student-oriented. "I am delighted
that this initiative was generated by stu
dents," Wais said. "I think it's an exciting
initiative with a lot of potential."
The committee will meet again next
quarter.
