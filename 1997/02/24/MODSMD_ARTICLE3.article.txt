# Vote on Sand Hill likely to be postponed

### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
Stanford's plans for expansion around Sand
Hill Road will most likely be postponed, accord
ing to Palo Alto City Council member Lanie
Wheeler.
Discussion about the project in the city coun
cil will "definitely not conclude in time for [the
project] to appear on the June 3 ballot. It is more
likely to appear on the November ballot,"
Wheeler said.
The proposed $342 million-dollar project —
which seeks to build new housing units, expand
the Stanford Shopping Center and widen and
extend Sand Hill Road to intersect it with El
("amino Real — has been surrounded by contro
versy, much of it stemming from Menlo Park
residents.
The residents' primary concerns involve the
question of whether new development will over

load already-crowded streets. Many are also
troubled by the impact such construction might
have on the environment.
In order for the proposal to be on the June 3
ballot, the City Council must notify the county
by March 7 on the final status of the project.
"Right now it is hard to tell what will happen
before [the city council] has any discussions
among ourselves," Wheeler said.
She added that the process will be lengthy,
beginning with the council's decision on the en
vironmental impact report and the new zoning
ordinances. In addition, Stanford must approve
the final project which emerges from the council
in order for construction to begin.
More than 300 have signed up to voice opin
ions about the project with the council. At the
last council meeting, council members raised
their own questions about the project.
After hearing public opinion and the Univer
sity's presentation, the council has "many more

questions than answers" about the logistics of
placing the measure on the ballot for the council,
Wheeler said.
University Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry Horton said, "I
think we missed an opportunity, but it is an
issue which should be handled with all due
speed. The process is very cumbersome, and we
are just working through it."
Horton was optimistic that the project will
pass whenever it is placed on the ballot. "The
project overall has very strong support in both
Palo Alto and Menlo Park," he said. He added
that the University had worked with both cities
to ensure smooth integration into the communi
ties.
This is not the first time community mem
bers have addressed the issue of expansion on
Sand Hill Road, Wheeler said. Over the past 10
years, the city of Palo Alto has pre
viously asked Stanford to make
such a proposal, but for various
reasons the proposals have not

gone to completion. "The current
project is the most complete plan
that we've gotten from the Univer
sity," she said.
The next meeting is scheduled
for Wednesday, when the council
members will begin internal dis
cussions about what course to pur
sue with the Sand Hill project.
