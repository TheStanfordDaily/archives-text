### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
A presentation, titled "Sufi Celebra
tion: In Search of Essence," brought 570
students and residents from all over the
Bay Area to Kresge Auditorium Saturday
Sponsored by the Persian Students Asso
ciation, the Sufi Celebration was present
ed by M.T.O. Shahmaghsoudi, the School
Islamic of Sufism.
Sufism is the science of the soul, ac
cording to Lynn Wilcox, who spoke at the
celebration. Wilcox is a student of Sufism
and an author of three books on the sub
ject.
Sufism has existed for over 1,400
years, Wilcox said. It teaches the healing
of the soul and helps people to get to know
themselves. The School of Sufism has
500,000 members internationally.
"The nearest term in English for Su
fism is 'gnosticism,' " said Hooman Jehab,
the evening's master of ceremonies.
According to Jehab, Sufism is a school
of thought — the cognition of truth and
reality. It is more of a spiritual mysticism
than a religion.

"The celebration's goal was meant to
introduce Sufism to people — to show a
new view of something different," said
Mina Khadem, a member of the Persit n
Student Association. Khadem's husband,
Rasool, is a graduate student in electrical
engineering and president of the Persian
Student Association.
"We wanted to provide a window to a
small branch of the Islamic religion,"
Mina Khadem said.
The two-and-a-half hour program in
cluded brief lectures by seven speakers
from the school of Sufism, poetry read
ings, a meditation exercise and tradition
al and modern Sufi music and chanting.
"The Sufi Zikr, or chanting, is famed
for its soothing and revitalizing effects,"
said Hamid Tooryani, a speaker.
In his speech, Tooryani explained that
Zikr is the gateway between the bound
aries of time and space into union with
God.
Sufi music was played throughout the
> .vening in accompaniment with the read
ings and lectures. Musicians played the
daff (a handheld sheepskin drum), setar
(a three-string instrument) and santur (a

soft forerunner of the xylophone). This
collection of traditional Persian instru
ments was supplemented with the mod
ern sounds of the violin, guitar, keyboard,
harmonica and flute.
The Shahmaghsoudi Sufi Choir pre
sented Sufi chanting in its traditional and
modern forms.
"The singing is accompanied by a mo
tion which is in harmony with the motion
of the Earth, the solar system and even
the entire Milky Way galaxy," Tooryani
said. "It is the symbol of infinity, the fig
ure eight."
A screen on each side of the stage pre
sented slides of Sufi art and architecture.
"It was a great presentation of the true
Persian culture of peace," said Afshin Od
abaee, an audience member from Sunny
vale.
At the end of the celebration, audience
members joined the speakers in a closing
prayer. The Persian Students Association
then served samples of Persian sweets
and tea.
According to Wilcox, "This is the first
[Sufi celebration] held at Stanford....
We'd like to come back again."
