Ralph Smith, professor emeritus of
electrical engineering, died of cancer last
week. According to those who worked with
him during his 30 years at Stanford, he
was a teacher who had a genuine impact on
students' lives. Friends and family say
they will remember him not only for his
academic influence but also for his com
mitment to undergraduate education.
"It was terrific to have him teaching
just when students were first getting ex
posed to engineering," said Joseph Good
man, professor of electrical engineering
and associate dean of the School of Engi
neering.
Goodman said Smith taught most of
the introductory level engineering courses
because "there were lots of people who
went into his classes not knowing whether
engineering was for them, and most came
out absolutely convinced that it was."
Smith's long history with Stanford
began during his own college years. After
earning his bachelor's degree and two
graduate degrees at UC-Berkeley, he ob
tained his doctorate from Stanford in
1945. Smith then taught at San Jose State
and worked for the Philippine Department
of Education before joining the Stanford

faculty in 1957.
When Smith retired in 1982, the Ralph
J. Smith scholarship was established to
recognize students "who demonstrate
promise in teaching" engineering.
Professor Emeritus of Mechanical En
gineering Robert Eustis credited Smith
with starting the Term an Scholars Pro
gram, which honors outstanding engi
neering students and their high school
teachers.
Smith "loved Stanford and thought the
students were the best in the world," Eu
stis said. "Everybody tried to get into
Ralph's classes."
John Linvill, professor emeritus of
electrical engineering, said another of
Smith's achievements was writing a series
of engineering textbooks that were "so
well-done and so clear" that for many
years, Smith was"the most widely read
electrical engineering author" in the Unit
ed States.
Linvill also said Smith "believed in liv
ing life the right way." He said Smith
played golf and tennis regularly and"was
one of the first members of the faculty to
... drive around in an MG convertible."
According to Louise Smith, Smith's
widow, when she and her husband used to
travel, "(Ralph) almost always met one of

his old students" no matter where they
went.
"Our last trip was to China. On our last
day in Shanghai, a young man came up to
my husband and said, 'Dr. Smith, what are
you doing here?' The young man was a pro
fessional working in Shanghai" and had
been one of Smith's students as an under
graduate. "But he still recognized my hus
band," Louise Smith said.
Goodman was one of the many students
influenced by Smith. When Goodman was
a graduate student, Smith approached
him and asked if he would like to teach a
small section of an engineering course. Al
though it was Goodman's first experience
teaching, he said that Smith "had a lot of
confidence that I could do it well. He gave
me tremendous guidance, and it really had
a lasting impact on me."
"I owe Ralph Smith a tremendous debt
for my life," Goodman said.
In addition to Louise Smith, Smith is
survived by his sons Kent of Grass Valley,
Calif, and Dan of Walnut Creek, Calif., his
daughters Nancy Anderson of Grass Val
ley, Calif, and Elaine Culverwell of Fre
mont, Calif., eight grandchildren and
three great-grandchildren.
Plans for a memorial service are pend
ing.
