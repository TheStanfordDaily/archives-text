# Socially responsible investments: debate enters third decade
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Socially responsible investing seems to
have experienced a renaissance of late on the
Farm.
Granted, this isn't the late 1980s, when
the world's attention was focused on the
racist apartheid regime in South Africa and
the U.S. companies doing business there. It's
been years since a Stanford student was ar
rested for protesting anything, let alone for
protesting something as serious as the Uni
versity's investment policies.
Still, there are signs that socially respon
sible investing is an issue again. Whether
students are protesting a Taco Bell in Tresid
der Union or demanding that the trustees
create a socially responsible endowment
fund, an increasingly large number of stu
dent activists are making their presence
heard.
As with any revival, questions arise, and
in this case there are many:
What's behind this new student move
ment? What effect, if any, will it have on the
University's current investment practices?
And perhaps most importantly, is socially re-

sponsible investing even an
issue that the University
ought to be concerned
about?
Why now?
Nearly everyone agrees
that South Africa is the
issue that put "socially re
sponsible investing" on the
map, both at Stanford and

around the world. While activists have long
raised concerns about various corporations'
environmental and ethical practices,
apartheid was the cause that unified these
activists.
"South Africa was a symbol of race rela
tions everywhere else in the world and was
also very important to the development of
Africa in general," said William Masters,
who protested against Stanford's invest
ment policies while a doctoral student in the
late 1980s.
South Africa was heavily dependent on
foreign investments, particularly from
American firms. At its height, U.S. corporate


Clay
presence in the country included
more than 250 companies with di
rect investments totaling $2 billion.
After the fall of apartheid in the
early 19905, interest in investment
responsibility at Stanford died
down.
It only resurfaced two years ago
when Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford decided it needed
a single cause to rally around.
The student group eventually de
cided to focus on investment respon
sibility, mostly because "we could
actually make a difference in the
way the University invests in corpo
rations," said ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, a three-year SEAS
member.
Though SEAS considered the
threats posed by environmentally
incorrect companies and tobacco
companies, more and more the
group's attention seemed to rest on
one issue: Burma.
Burma is a country the size of
Texas in Southeast Asia ruled by a
highly authoritarian, military
regime known as the State Law
and Order Restoration Council.
Among the SLORC's worst offens
es, activists say, are the massacre
of thousands of pro-democracy
student protesters in 1988 and the
refusal to recognize the results of
the 1990 democratic elections,
which saw the opposition party
win 85 percent of the seats in gov
ernment.
Activists were quick to compare
the human rights violations in
Burma to the South Africa situa
tion, even going so far as to call
Burma the "South Africa of the
'905."
Today, most activists admit that
comparison overstates the case a bit;
Burma has not united world opinion
in the way that South Africa did.
Still, Burma remains a visible
issue, particularly on college cam
puses. At Stanford, the ASSU Sen
ate last year passed a resolution ban
ning products of companies that do
business with Burma.
SEAS organized a protest
against a proposed Taco Bell in
Tresidder because of parent compa
ny PepsiCo's involvement in that
country. The Taco Bell never went
into Tresidder, although University
administrators claimed the decision
was based on economics not politics.
In late January PepsiCo buckled to
demands and announced it would
pull out of Burma entirely.
How does it work?
In Burma students found a cause
again. The question now was how to

go about effecting change in invest
ment policy.
The Stanford Management Co.
manages the University's $3.8 bil
lion endowment. About a dozen
company managers work with out
side fund managers to achieve the
goal of maximum return with the
least risk over time.
While day-to-day investment de
cisions are made by the manage
ment company, questions of invest
ment policy tire determined by two
primary bodies.
The first, the Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility (former
ly allied the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility), is composed of
students, faculty, staff and alumni.
The APIR reviews shareholder reso
lutions and then presents its recom
mendations to the second group, the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility. TheSCIR, which is a
subgroup of the Board of Trustees,
votes on each resolution — bearing
in mind the APIR recommenda
tions.
Linda Kimball, manager of in
vestment responsibility at the man
agement company, said the APIR
will probably be faced with about 80
social issue shareholder resolutions
this year. That's a lot to vote on, let
alone research. Typically, the APIR
has focused on a few issues; this year
Burma and tobacco have already re
ceived attention at earlier meetings.
A possible solution
According to student activists,
the current process is flawed. Be
cause of busy schedules, APIR
members never meet as regularly
as they should — the group has
only met twice this year — and
communication with the SCIR has
also been problematic, said Thomp
son, who was an APIR member last
year.
Last spring the SCIR did not vote
in time on resolutions asking UNO
CAL, Texaco and PepsiCo to review
and revise their human rights prac
tices in Burma.
This frustration with the current
system was one reason why stu
dents proposed a socially responsi
ble endowment fund last fall.
Rather than continually fighting
with trustees on a case-by-case
basis, the students wanted the Uni
versity to let donors earmark contri
butions for a separate fund that in
vests in "good" companies.
The original draft of the proposal
describes a plan to devote 70 percent
of the fund's money to large, stable
companies that pass "negative
screens." Tobacco companies and
companies with operations in
Burma probably would not pass
such a screen.
Twenty-nine percent would go to
smaller companies that pass "posi

tive screens"; companies like
Odwalla would probably be included
in that category. The remaining 1
percent would be used to invest in
high-impact loans and investments
in communities like East Palo Alto.
Thompson and the other authors
promoted the new fund as a way to
increase the percentage of alumni
who give to Stanford.
Trustees don't agree
The SCIR, after consulting with
various University administrative
offices, didn't buy the students' ar
gument for a new endowment fund.
A Jan. 6 memo to Thompson and
ASSU President Bill Shen outlined
the reasons why the SCIR could not
support the development of such a
fund.
Roger Clay, chair of the SCIR,
summed up the trustees' response:
"The proposal can do harm but we
didn't see any benefit. It may not
have done harm but we weren't con
vinced it could do good."
The trustees specified the follow
ing concerns:
• The new fund would conflict
with the University's policy of
"using a uniform fiduciary invest
ment approach which maximizes re
turn." The trustees maintain that
socially responsible funds have a
lower return rate over time.
• There is no evidence that a so
cially responsible fund would in
crease alumni giving. The Office of
Development routinely surveys
alumni and nobody has ever men
tioned socially responsible invest
ing as a reason for giving or not giv
ing.
• The proposal overlooks the fact
that endowment is already invested
in a number of socially responsible
companies. Close to $350 million of
the endowment is invested in ven
ture capital opportunities, and
about 35 percent of Stanford's pub
lic equity investments are in compa
nies that are recognized as socially
responsible.
• The new fund would politicize
the business of asking people to do
nate to the University. "How do you
determine what's socially responsi
ble and what's not?" Clay asked.
"Everyone has different criteria."
• The new fund would confuse
the central message of the Stanford
Fund's marketing strategy, as well
as the distinction between expend
able and endowment funds.
• It could be dangerous to allow
donors to dictate the financial man
agement of their endowment gifts.
Students disagree
Thompson and the other authors
of the proposal took issue with the
trustees' evaluation.

Historic highlights of investment responsibility issues at Stanford

1970-1979
• In response to a call for reform, the Stanford Board of Trustees establishes the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to advise on shareholder voting policies.
• Stanford becomes the first mqjor academic institution to adopt a statement on investment responsibility.
• Stanford, along with other academic institutions, establishes the Investor Responsibility Research Center; the
center provides objective analysis of shareholder proposals on corporate governance and social issues.
• Stanford's Board of Trustees establishes its own Special Committee on Investment Responsibility to examine
investment-related issues.
• The U.S. civil rights activist and General Motors Board of Directors member Rev. Leon Sullivan develops a Beven
point code of affirmative action and corporate responsibility for companies operating in South Africa.
1980-1989
• Stanford's student senate votes unanimously in favor of divestment of Motorola holdings; a referendum calls for the
University to "formulate a responsible investment policy."
• The Board of Trustees adopts stricter criteria for firms doing business in South Africa.
• After careful examination, Stanford divests of stock held in 10 companies doing business in South Africa.
1990-1996
• The CIR, renamed the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility, responds to the Exxon Valdez spill by
considering shareholder resolutions asking companies to report on and endorse environmental criteria refered to as
the Valdez or CERES Principles.
• The Board of Trustees calls fqr review of the tobacco issue; the SCIR meets with Philip Morris and sends letters to
tobacco producers; in 1996, the SCIR approves recommendations to vote in support of the shareholder resolution
asking tobacco companies to "donate a percentage of their profits to a third-party sponsored campaign to combat
youth smoking."
• In April 1993, the Board of Trustees approves the APIR policy recommendations for doing business in South Africa;
in April 1994, South Africa holds its first nationwide democratic elections.
1997
• The SCIR supports the APIR's recommendation to expand the representation of student and faculty members on
the panel. APIR is now comprised of two undergraduates, two graduate students, four faculty members, two alumni
and two administrative officers.
• As of Januaiy, the APIR had a possible 160 social issue shareholder resolutions to consider. This represents 79
companies held in Stanford's endowment portfolio. Current social issues before Stanford-held companies include 29
corporate governance/social, 23 tobacco, 23 equal employment opportunity, nine human rights, 12 labor rights, 38
environmental/energy/maquiladora and 26 miscellaneous.
• Shareholder tobacco resolutions for all companies have risen from 27 in 1996 to 33 in 1997, with emphasis targeting
youth anti-smoking.
• Students sponsor a proposal to establish a socially responsible endowment fund.

panies, Thompson said there is no
proof that these companies have
lower returns. Clay admitted this is
a debatable point.
Evidence from experts supports
Thompson's claim. A recent article
in Pensions & Investments, a jour
nal for investors, concluded that
"the data show there has been no
statistically significant differences
between the average returns of a so
cially screened and unscreened uni
verse during the 1987-1994 peri
od."
Kirk Hanson, a senior lecturer at
the Graduate School of Business
and two-time chair of the CIR, ex
pressed his surprise that "the
trustees would articulate what has
been a discredited idea — that to use
social criteria in investing will harm
returns."
In response to the trustees' no
evidence argument, Thompson
pointed to the 1,000 signatures
gathered in support of the endow
ment proposal in just five days. In
addition, more than 50 people do
nated to the ASSU's separate social
ly responsible fund, which was es
tablished to protest the trustees' re

jection. The ASSU fund existed less
than a week before students decided
they had received sufficient conces
sions from trustees, including the
option to resubmit their proposal.
Thompson disputed the claim
that such a fund would politicize
fund-raising. "We're talking about
accepted standards here — compa
nies that violate the United Na
tions Code of Human Rights," he
said. "No one would dispute that
these companies could not be con
sidered in any way 'socially respon
sible.' "
Finally, Thompson criticized the
trustees for only considering finan
cial return in investment decisions.
The fact that 35 percent of Stan
ford's investments are in so-called
"good" companies is just happen
stance, he said. "That doesn't mean
the University cares about social is
sues — it's just like throwing darts
at a board."
"That's not a useful criticism,"
Clay responded. "My dad told me a
long time ago, it's people's behavior
that matters, not their hearts. If
someone is beating me over the
head, I don't care why they stop."

As for not considering social is
sues in investment decisions, that's
simply not true, Clay said. Financial
return may be the primary criteria,
but the social impact of investing is
also considered, just as it was dur
ing the South Africa movement.
"Why do you think we have an SCIR
and APIR?" he said.
What next?
It seems then that the trustees
and the students are at a cross
roads. Is there a solution to be
found?
For his part, Clay says he would
need to better understand the stu
dents' concerns. The proposal did
not clearly state them, nor a solu
tion.
As for the students, they plan to
submit a new proposal in a few
weeks. Thompson said he likes the
idea of devoting a small percentage
of the current endowment, perhaps
5 percent, to be invested in socially
positive companies. This would be
in place of setting up a separate
fund, which trustees have rightly
pointed out could be easily confused
with the Stanford Fund.

one issue: Burma.
Burma is a country the size of
Texas in Southeast Asia ruled by a
highly authoritarian, military
regime known as the State Law
and Order Restoration Council.
Among the SLORC's worst offens
es, activists say, are the massacre
of thousands of pro-democracy
student protesters in 1988 and the
refusal to recognize the results of
the 1990 democratic elections,
which saw the opposition party
win 85 percent of the seats in gov
ernment.
Activists were quick to compare
the human rights violations in
Burma to the South Africa situa
tion, even going so far as to call
Burma the "South Africa of the
'905."
Today, most activists admit that
comparison overstates the case a bit;
Burma has not united world opinion
in the way that South Africa did.
Still, Burma remains a visible
issue, particularly on college cam
puses. At Stanford, the ASSU Sen
ate last year passed a resolution ban
ning products of companies that do
business with Burma.
SEAS organized a protest
against a proposed Taco Bell in
Tresidder because of parent compa
ny PepsiCo's involvement in that
country. The Taco Bell never went
into Tresidder, although University
administrators claimed the decision
was based on economics not politics.
In late January PepsiCo buckled to
demands and announced it would
pull out of Burma entirely.
How does it work?
In Burma students found a cause
again. The question now was how to

go about effecting change in invest
ment policy.
The Stanford Management Co.
manages the University's $3.8 bil
lion endowment. About a dozen
company managers work with out
side fund managers to achieve the
goal of maximum return with the
least risk over time.
While day-to-day investment de
cisions are made by the manage
ment company, questions of invest
ment policy tire determined by two
primary bodies.
The first, the Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility (former
ly allied the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility), is composed of
students, faculty, staff and alumni.
The APIR reviews shareholder reso
lutions and then presents its recom
mendations to the second group, the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility. TheSCIR, which is a
subgroup of the Board of Trustees,
votes on each resolution — bearing
in mind the APIR recommenda
tions.
Linda Kimball, manager of in
vestment responsibility at the man
agement company, said the APIR
will probably be faced with about 80
social issue shareholder resolutions
this year. That's a lot to vote on, let
alone research. Typically, the APIR
has focused on a few issues; this year
Burma and tobacco have already re
ceived attention at earlier meetings.
A possible solution
According to student activists,
the current process is flawed. Be
cause of busy schedules, APIR
members never meet as regularly
as they should — the group has
only met twice this year — and
communication with the SCIR has
also been problematic, said Thomp
son, who was an APIR member last
year.
Last spring the SCIR did not vote
in time on resolutions asking UNO
CAL, Texaco and PepsiCo to review
and revise their human rights prac
tices in Burma.
This frustration with the current
system was one reason why stu
dents proposed a socially responsi
ble endowment fund last fall.
Rather than continually fighting
with trustees on a case-by-case
basis, the students wanted the Uni
versity to let donors earmark contri
butions for a separate fund that in
vests in "good" companies.
The original draft of the proposal
describes a plan to devote 70 percent
of the fund's money to large, stable
companies that pass "negative
screens." Tobacco companies and
companies with operations in
Burma probably would not pass
such a screen.
Twenty-nine percent would go to
smaller companies that pass "posi

tive screens"; companies like
Odwalla would probably be included
in that category. The remaining 1
percent would be used to invest in
high-impact loans and investments
in communities like East Palo Alto.
Thompson and the other authors
promoted the new fund as a way to
increase the percentage of alumni
who give to Stanford.
Trustees don't agree
The SCIR, after consulting with
various University administrative
offices, didn't buy the students' ar
gument for a new endowment fund.
A Jan. 6 memo to Thompson and
ASSU President Bill Shen outlined
the reasons why the SCIR could not
support the development of such a
fund.
Roger Clay, chair of the SCIR,
summed up the trustees' response:
"The proposal can do harm but we
didn't see any benefit. It may not
have done harm but we weren't con
vinced it could do good."
The trustees specified the follow
ing concerns:
• The new fund would conflict
with the University's policy of
"using a uniform fiduciary invest
ment approach which maximizes re
turn." The trustees maintain that
socially responsible funds have a
lower return rate over time.
• There is no evidence that a so
cially responsible fund would in
crease alumni giving. The Office of
Development routinely surveys
alumni and nobody has ever men
tioned socially responsible invest
ing as a reason for giving or not giv
ing.
• The proposal overlooks the fact
that endowment is already invested
in a number of socially responsible
companies. Close to $350 million of
the endowment is invested in ven
ture capital opportunities, and
about 35 percent of Stanford's pub
lic equity investments are in compa
nies that are recognized as socially
responsible.
• The new fund would politicize
the business of asking people to do
nate to the University. "How do you
determine what's socially responsi
ble and what's not?" Clay asked.
"Everyone has different criteria."
• The new fund would confuse
the central message of the Stanford
Fund's marketing strategy, as well
as the distinction between expend
able and endowment funds.
• It could be dangerous to allow
donors to dictate the financial man
agement of their endowment gifts.
Students disagree
Thompson and the other authors
of the proposal took issue with the
trustees' evaluation.

Historic highlights of investment responsibility issues at Stanford

1970-1979
• In response to a call for reform, the Stanford Board of Trustees establishes the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to advise on shareholder voting policies.
• Stanford becomes the first mqjor academic institution to adopt a statement on investment responsibility.
• Stanford, along with other academic institutions, establishes the Investor Responsibility Research Center; the
center provides objective analysis of shareholder proposals on corporate governance and social issues.
• Stanford's Board of Trustees establishes its own Special Committee on Investment Responsibility to examine
investment-related issues.
• The U.S. civil rights activist and General Motors Board of Directors member Rev. Leon Sullivan develops a Beven
point code of affirmative action and corporate responsibility for companies operating in South Africa.
1980-1989
• Stanford's student senate votes unanimously in favor of divestment of Motorola holdings; a referendum calls for the
University to "formulate a responsible investment policy."
• The Board of Trustees adopts stricter criteria for firms doing business in South Africa.
• After careful examination, Stanford divests of stock held in 10 companies doing business in South Africa.
1990-1996
• The CIR, renamed the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility, responds to the Exxon Valdez spill by
considering shareholder resolutions asking companies to report on and endorse environmental criteria refered to as
the Valdez or CERES Principles.
• The Board of Trustees calls fqr review of the tobacco issue; the SCIR meets with Philip Morris and sends letters to
tobacco producers; in 1996, the SCIR approves recommendations to vote in support of the shareholder resolution
asking tobacco companies to "donate a percentage of their profits to a third-party sponsored campaign to combat
youth smoking."
• In April 1993, the Board of Trustees approves the APIR policy recommendations for doing business in South Africa;
in April 1994, South Africa holds its first nationwide democratic elections.
1997
• The SCIR supports the APIR's recommendation to expand the representation of student and faculty members on
the panel. APIR is now comprised of two undergraduates, two graduate students, four faculty members, two alumni
and two administrative officers.
• As of Januaiy, the APIR had a possible 160 social issue shareholder resolutions to consider. This represents 79
companies held in Stanford's endowment portfolio. Current social issues before Stanford-held companies include 29
corporate governance/social, 23 tobacco, 23 equal employment opportunity, nine human rights, 12 labor rights, 38
environmental/energy/maquiladora and 26 miscellaneous.
• Shareholder tobacco resolutions for all companies have risen from 27 in 1996 to 33 in 1997, with emphasis targeting
youth anti-smoking.
• Students sponsor a proposal to establish a socially responsible endowment fund.

panies, Thompson said there is no
proof that these companies have
lower returns. Clay admitted this is
a debatable point.
Evidence from experts supports
Thompson's claim. A recent article
in Pensions & Investments, a jour
nal for investors, concluded that
"the data show there has been no
statistically significant differences
between the average returns of a so
cially screened and unscreened uni
verse during the 1987-1994 peri
od."
Kirk Hanson, a senior lecturer at
the Graduate School of Business
and two-time chair of the CIR, ex
pressed his surprise that "the
trustees would articulate what has
been a discredited idea — that to use
social criteria in investing will harm
returns."
In response to the trustees' no
evidence argument, Thompson
pointed to the 1,000 signatures
gathered in support of the endow
ment proposal in just five days. In
addition, more than 50 people do
nated to the ASSU's separate social
ly responsible fund, which was es
tablished to protest the trustees' re

jection. The ASSU fund existed less
than a week before students decided
they had received sufficient conces
sions from trustees, including the
option to resubmit their proposal.
Thompson disputed the claim
that such a fund would politicize
fund-raising. "We're talking about
accepted standards here — compa
nies that violate the United Na
tions Code of Human Rights," he
said. "No one would dispute that
these companies could not be con
sidered in any way 'socially respon
sible.' "
Finally, Thompson criticized the
trustees for only considering finan
cial return in investment decisions.
The fact that 35 percent of Stan
ford's investments are in so-called
"good" companies is just happen
stance, he said. "That doesn't mean
the University cares about social is
sues — it's just like throwing darts
at a board."
"That's not a useful criticism,"
Clay responded. "My dad told me a
long time ago, it's people's behavior
that matters, not their hearts. If
someone is beating me over the
head, I don't care why they stop."

Katie Stokes — Daily

As for not considering social is
sues in investment decisions, that's
simply not true, Clay said. Financial
return may be the primary criteria,
but the social impact of investing is
also considered, just as it was dur
ing the South Africa movement.
"Why do you think we have an SCIR
and APIR?" he said.
What next?
It seems then that the trustees
and the students are at a cross
roads. Is there a solution to be
found?
For his part, Clay says he would
need to better understand the stu
dents' concerns. The proposal did
not clearly state them, nor a solu
tion.
As for the students, they plan to
submit a new proposal in a few
weeks. Thompson said he likes the
idea of devoting a small percentage
of the current endowment, perhaps
5 percent, to be invested in socially
positive companies. This would be
in place of setting up a separate
fund, which trustees have rightly
pointed out could be easily confused
with the Stanford Fund.
Socially responsible investing seems to
have experienced a renaissance of late on the
Farm.
Granted, this isn't the late 1980s, when
the world's attention was focused on the
racist apartheid regime in South Africa and
the U.S. companies doing business there. It's
been years since a Stanford student was ar
rested for protesting anything, let alone for
protesting something as serious as the Uni
versity's investment policies.
Still, there are signs that socially respon
sible investing is an issue again. Whether
students are protesting a Taco Bell in Tresid
der Union or demanding that the trustees
create a socially responsible endowment
fund, an increasingly large number of stu
dent activists are making their presence
heard.
As with any revival, questions arise, and
in this case there are many:
What's behind this new student move
ment? What effect, if any, will it have on the
University's current investment practices?
And perhaps most importantly, is socially re-

sponsible investing even an
issue that the University
ought to be concerned
about?
Why now?
Nearly everyone agrees
that South Africa is the
issue that put "socially re
sponsible investing" on the
map, both at Stanford and

around the world. While activists have long
raised concerns about various corporations'
environmental and ethical practices,
apartheid was the cause that unified these
activists.
"South Africa was a symbol of race rela
tions everywhere else in the world and was
also very important to the development of
Africa in general," said William Masters,
who protested against Stanford's invest
ment policies while a doctoral student in the
late 1980s.
South Africa was heavily dependent on
foreign investments, particularly from
American firms. At its height, U.S. corporate


Clay
presence in the country included
more than 250 companies with di
rect investments totaling $2 billion.
After the fall of apartheid in the
early 19905, interest in investment
responsibility at Stanford died
down.
It only resurfaced two years ago
when Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford decided it needed
a single cause to rally around.
The student group eventually de
cided to focus on investment respon
sibility, mostly because "we could
actually make a difference in the
way the University invests in corpo
rations," said ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, a three-year SEAS
member.
Though SEAS considered the
threats posed by environmentally
incorrect companies and tobacco
companies, more and more the
group's attention seemed to rest on
one issue: Burma.
Burma is a country the size of
Texas in Southeast Asia ruled by a
highly authoritarian, military
regime known as the State Law
and Order Restoration Council.

this year. That's a lot to vote on, let
alone research. Typically, the APIR
has focused on a few issues; this year
Burma and tobacco have already re
ceived attention at earlier meetings.
A possible solution
According to student activists,
the current process is flawed. Be
cause of busy schedules, APIR
members never meet as regularly
as they should — the group has
only met twice this year — and
communication with the SCIR has
also been problematic, said Thomp
son, who was an APIR member last
year.
Last spring the SCIR did not vote
in time on resolutions asking UNO
CAL, Texaco and PepsiCo to review
and revise their human rights prac
tices in Burma.
This frustration with the current
system was one reason why stu
dents proposed a socially responsi
ble endowment fund last fall.
Rather than continually fighting
with trustees on a case-by-case
basis, the students wanted the Uni
versity to let donors earmark contri
butions for a separate fund that in
vests in "good" companies.
The original draft of the proposal
describes a plan to devote 70 percent
of the fund's money to large, stable
companies that pass "negative
screens." Tobacco companies and
companies with operations in
Burma probably would not pass
such a screen.
Twenty-nine percent would go to
smaller companies that pass "posi

tive screens"; companies like
Odwalla would probably be included
in that category. The remaining 1
percent would be used to invest in
high-impact loans and investments
in communities like East Palo Alto.
Thompson and the other authors
promoted the new fund as a way to
increase the percentage of alumni
who give to Stanford.
Trustees don't agree
The SCIR, after consulting with
various University administrative
offices, didn't buy the students' ar
gument for a new endowment fund.
A Jan. 6 memo to Thompson and
ASSU President Bill Shen outlined
the reasons why the SCIR could not
support the development of such a
fund.
Roger Clay, chair of the SCIR,
summed up the trustees' response:
"The proposal can do harm but we
didn't see any benefit. It may not
have done harm but we weren't con
vinced it could do good."
The trustees specified the follow
ing concerns:
• The new fund would conflict
with the University's policy of
"using a uniform fiduciary invest
ment approach which maximizes re
turn." The trustees maintain that
socially responsible funds have a
lower return rate over time.
• There is no evidence that a so
cially responsible fund would in
crease alumni giving. The Office of
Development routinely surveys
alumni and nobody has ever men
tioned socially responsible invest
ing as a reason for giving or not giv
ing.
• The proposal overlooks the fact
that endowment is already invested
in a number of socially responsible
companies. Close to $350 million of
the endowment is invested in ven
ture capital opportunities, and
about 35 percent of Stanford's pub
lic equity investments are in compa
nies that are recognized as socially
responsible.
• The new fund would politicize
the business of asking people to do
nate to the University. "How do you
determine what's socially responsi
ble and what's not?" Clay asked.
"Everyone has different criteria."
• The new fund would confuse
the central message of the Stanford
Fund's marketing strategy, as well
as the distinction between expend
able and endowment funds.
• It could be dangerous to allow
donors to dictate the financial man
agement of their endowment gifts.
Students disagree
Thompson and the other authors
of the proposal took issue with the
trustees' evaluation.

Historic highlights of investment responsibility issues at Stanford

1970-1979
• In response to a call for reform, the Stanford Board of Trustees establishes the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to advise on shareholder voting policies.
• Stanford becomes the first mqjor academic institution to adopt a statement on investment responsibility.
• Stanford, along with other academic institutions, establishes the Investor Responsibility Research Center; the
center provides objective analysis of shareholder proposals on corporate governance and social issues.
• Stanford's Board of Trustees establishes its own Special Committee on Investment Responsibility to examine
investment-related issues.
• The U.S. civil rights activist and General Motors Board of Directors member Rev. Leon Sullivan develops a Beven
point code of affirmative action and corporate responsibility for companies operating in South Africa.
1980-1989
• Stanford's student senate votes unanimously in favor of divestment of Motorola holdings; a referendum calls for the
University to "formulate a responsible investment policy."
• The Board of Trustees adopts stricter criteria for firms doing business in South Africa.
• After careful examination, Stanford divests of stock held in 10 companies doing business in South Africa.
1990-1996
• The CIR, renamed the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility, responds to the Exxon Valdez spill by
considering shareholder resolutions asking companies to report on and endorse environmental criteria refered to as
the Valdez or CERES Principles.
• The Board of Trustees calls fqr review of the tobacco issue; the SCIR meets with Philip Morris and sends letters to
tobacco producers; in 1996, the SCIR approves recommendations to vote in support of the shareholder resolution
asking tobacco companies to "donate a percentage of their profits to a third-party sponsored campaign to combat
youth smoking."
• In April 1993, the Board of Trustees approves the APIR policy recommendations for doing business in South Africa;
in April 1994, South Africa holds its first nationwide democratic elections.
1997
• The SCIR supports the APIR's recommendation to expand the representation of student and faculty members on
the panel. APIR is now comprised of two undergraduates, two graduate students, four faculty members, two alumni
and two administrative officers.
• As of Januaiy, the APIR had a possible 160 social issue shareholder resolutions to consider. This represents 79
companies held in Stanford's endowment portfolio. Current social issues before Stanford-held companies include 29
corporate governance/social, 23 tobacco, 23 equal employment opportunity, nine human rights, 12 labor rights, 38
environmental/energy/maquiladora and 26 miscellaneous.
• Shareholder tobacco resolutions for all companies have risen from 27 in 1996 to 33 in 1997, with emphasis targeting
youth anti-smoking.
• Students sponsor a proposal to establish a socially responsible endowment fund.

panies, Thompson said there is no
proof that these companies have
lower returns. Clay admitted this is
a debatable point.
Evidence from experts supports
Thompson's claim. A recent article
in Pensions & Investments, a jour
nal for investors, concluded that
"the data show there has been no
statistically significant differences
between the average returns of a so
cially screened and unscreened uni
verse during the 1987-1994 peri
od."
Kirk Hanson, a senior lecturer at
the Graduate School of Business
and two-time chair of the CIR, ex
pressed his surprise that "the
trustees would articulate what has
been a discredited idea — that to use
social criteria in investing will harm
returns."
In response to the trustees' no
evidence argument, Thompson
pointed to the 1,000 signatures
gathered in support of the endow
ment proposal in just five days. In
addition, more than 50 people do
nated to the ASSU's separate social
ly responsible fund, which was es
tablished to protest the trustees' re

jection. The ASSU fund existed less
than a week before students decided
they had received sufficient conces
sions from trustees, including the
option to resubmit their proposal.
Thompson disputed the claim
that such a fund would politicize
fund-raising. "We're talking about
accepted standards here — compa
nies that violate the United Na
tions Code of Human Rights," he
said. "No one would dispute that
these companies could not be con
sidered in any way 'socially respon
sible.' "
Finally, Thompson criticized the
trustees for only considering finan
cial return in investment decisions.
The fact that 35 percent of Stan
ford's investments are in so-called
"good" companies is just happen
stance, he said. "That doesn't mean
the University cares about social is
sues — it's just like throwing darts
at a board."
"That's not a useful criticism,"
Clay responded. "My dad told me a
long time ago, it's people's behavior
that matters, not their hearts. If
someone is beating me over the
head, I don't care why they stop."

As for not considering social is
sues in investment decisions, that's
simply not true, Clay said. Financial
return may be the primary criteria,
but the social impact of investing is
also considered, just as it was dur
ing the South Africa movement.
"Why do you think we have an SCIR
and APIR?" he said.
What next?
It seems then that the trustees
and the students are at a cross
roads. Is there a solution to be
found?
For his part, Clay says he would
need to better understand the stu
dents' concerns. The proposal did
not clearly state them, nor a solu
tion.
As for the students, they plan to
submit a new proposal in a few
weeks. Thompson said he likes the
idea of devoting a small percentage
of the current endowment, perhaps
5 percent, to be invested in socially
positive companies. This would be
in place of setting up a separate
fund, which trustees have rightly
pointed out could be easily confused
with the Stanford Fund.
