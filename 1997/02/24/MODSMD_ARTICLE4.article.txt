# Socially responsible investments: debate enters third decade

### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Socially responsible investing seems to
have experienced a renaissance of late on the
Farm.
Granted, this isn't the late 1980s, when
the world's attention was focused on the

University's current investment practices?
And perhaps most importantly, is socially re-

sponsible investing even an
issue that the University
ought to be concerned
about?
Why now?
Nearly everyone agrees
that South Africa is the
issue that put "socially re
sponsible investing" on the
map, both at Stanford and

around the world. While activists have long
raised concerns about various corporations'
environmental and ethical practices,
apartheid was the cause that unified these
activists.
"South Africa was a symbol of race rela

also very important to the development of
Africa in general," said William Masters,
who protested against Stanford's invest
ment policies while a doctoral student in the
late 1980s.
South Africa was heavily dependent on
foreign investments, particularly from
American firms. At its height, U.S. corporate
