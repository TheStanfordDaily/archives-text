# Bickering slows search
## Search for Anthro Dept head continues 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The search for a permanent head of the
Anthropology Department continues; al
though there is some optimism, administra
tors in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences cannot confirm any definite plans.
The department has been without a per
manent chair since Prof. Renato Rosaldo
had a stroke last quarter and temporarily
stepped down. At that point, the adminis
tration intervened and Vice Provost for Fac
ulty Recruitment and Development Robert
Weisberg, a law professor, has been serving
as the temporary chair.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Stephen Haber said the school had initially
anticipated that Rosaldo would retake the

position upon his recovery. However, Rosal
do has since decided not to return to the
chair, leading the school to look within the
department for a permanent replacement.
In the meantime, the search for someone
to assume the chair temporarily was con
ducted. However, this was unsuccessful.
According to Weisberg, the small size of
the department was a major reason why no
internal appointee could be found.
Coming up with an internal solution
"was simply impossible given people's
teaching and othecJafiulty commitments,"
Weisberg said.
These include several anthropology fac
ulty members' heavy involvement in the
search for a second professor for the pro-
gram in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity.
Weisberg acknowledged other
factors, however, and some an
thropology faculty point also to a
degree of internal division in the
department as an obstacle to a per
manent solution.
"Getting a chair is not a solu
tion. [Failure to do so] is a symp
tom of a number of problems," said
Anthropology Prof. Clifford Bar
nett.
According to Barnett, the dis
pute stems from different visions
of the scope of anthropology. He
noted that anthropology is by na
ture something of a "divided disci
pline," with aspects of hard sci
ence, social science and the hu
manities.

"That kind of diversity should
be kept in the department," Bar
nett added. However, he said, some
faculty "have defined their camp
too narrowly" and sought to em
phasize their form of anthropology
over others.
Faculty members stressed,
however, that the difficulties the
department faces in finding a per
manent chair have not manifested
themselves in much of the depart
ment's basic business.
Barnett said that while "it's
hard to live with an amount of un
certainty. ... I don't think stu
dents are suffering."
"For many things, it's business
as usual," said Assoc. Anthropolo
gy Prof. John Rick. He added that
the department's teaching was
one thing that remained unaffect
ed.
"I wouldn't call [the situationj
healthy, but I wouldn't call it the
end of the world. I think it shows

that there's intellectual life,"
Rick said.
Weisberg said there was no con
nection between the internal state
of the department and the decision
to deny tenure to Asst. Anthropol
ogy Prof. Akhil Gupta.
A committee of the school's
dean and associate deans rejected
Gupta for tenure despite a unani
mous endorsement from his de
partment's tenure committee.
According to Weisberg, any link
between the University's tenure
decision and the department's
problems would be "totally im
proper," given the legal obligation
universities have to consider
tenure decisions based on the indi
vidual merits of the professor in
volved.
Although Weisberg also said he
looked forward to finding a perma
nent head soon, Haber said it was
still too early to mention any defi
nite times or possibilities.
