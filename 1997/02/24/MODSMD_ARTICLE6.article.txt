# Sci-fi stories thrive in new writing group

Sisyphus was the cruel king
of Corinth condemned for eter
nity in Hades to push a boulder
up a hill only to have it roll down
to the bottom when he almost
reaches the top.
SSFS, pronounced "Sisy
phus," is the Stanford Specula
tive Fiction Society, a new group
devoted to science fiction, fanta
sy and all aspects of speculative
fiction.
"Writing is kind of like rolling
a rock up a hill: once you're done,
you start at the bottom again,"
said co-president Daniel
Berdichevsky, a junior. "So
we're here to push rocks togeth
er."
Head president / Imperatrix
Elizabeth Lee, a senior, empha
sized the "speculative fiction"
part of the name because it not
only incorporates science fiction,
but also fantasy and related gen
res. The group encourages a
wide range of readers and writ
ers.
Creating original pieces is
just one goal of the group.
According to co-president
Patrick Weekes, a junior, goals
include having intelligent con
versations about speculative fic
tion and going to relevant events
such as conventions or Star
Wars. The society also plans to
put on at least one event
for Stanford by the end of this
quarter, possibly bringing in a
guest speaker from the specula
tive fiction industry.
For now, they are setting up a

home page and a steady work
shop schedule. Weekes ex
plained the workshop process:
The author gives all members a
copy of his or her piece. At the
next meeting, the writer re
mains silent while everyone else
discusses the story's strong and
weak aspects, along with its con
troversial points. In the end, the
writer asks questions, usually
pertaining to ideas on improving
the work.
"The main focus of the group
is on the writing and on helping
one another out," said Lee, who
first suggested forming a group.
"We have the same philoso
phy as the class," she said, refer
ring to the English 190 C Science
Fiction Writing course that the
three co-presidents took last
spring quarter. The class, in
structed by science fiction writ
ers Pat Murphy and Karen Joy
Fowler, largely inspired the for
mation of the society.
"They're both published sci
ence fiction writers with a

wicked sense of humor, and they
showed us the importance of hav
ing an open-minded group of peo
ple to talk to," Weekes said. "When
your plots involve time travel or
aliens, an open mind is important."
Some current members of the
society may soon be published writ
ers as well. A few have already writ
ten full-length novels or plays and
are in the process of submission.
This does not mean, however, that
everyone in the group is an English
major with a creative writing em
phasis.
"We kind of run all over the
board," Weekes said, pointing out

majors in science, technology and
society, human biology, drama,
English and more. Not only does
speculative fiction cater to the
members' personal taste in litera
ture, but it also plays an integral
part in some of their studies.
A human biology major, Lee's
honors thesis looks at parallels be
tween science fiction and issues
facing biology, technology and sci
ence in the real world.
"It's about understanding why
there's such a fascination with sim
ulation, reproduction and replica
tion and how these change how we
view life, what we mean by
human," she said.
Berdichevsky's principal reason
for transferring from Harvard
University to Stanford was the
compatibility between science fic

tion and his major, STS. He indi
cated that both his interests over
lap in the areas of ethics, biomedi
cine and potential problems in the
future.
Lee also emphasized how sci
ence fiction reflects the trend of
technology filtering into the biolog
ical realm.
"Science fiction helps us better
understand issues we may face in
the future, for example, the idea of
cloning," she said.
Regarding science fiction writ
ers' attitude toward the future,
Weekes said "old school science fic
tion" is more the warning type
whereas newer science fiction sees
more hope in the relationship be
tween humans and technological
science.
"It's beginning to get more opti

mistic," he said.
There is also general debate over
the definition of science fiction, the
amount of science it should in
clude, its tone and style and its dis
tinction from fantasy. The group
encouraged readers and writers of
speculative fiction to join in the dis
cussion of such issues.
Lee indicated that while writers
of speculative fiction such as
Nabokov are respected, the genre
in general deserves more recogni
tion in the academic arena.
Weekes added, "It is now start
ing to prove it has something to
offer the literary community. You
can write science fiction and still be
a great author of deep and multi
layered fiction."
The group meets on Tuesdays at
9:40 p.m. in the Xanadu lounge.
