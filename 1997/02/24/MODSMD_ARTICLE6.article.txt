Sisyphus was the cruel king
of Corinth condemned for eter
nity in Hades to push a boulder
up a hill only to have it roll down
to the bottom when he almost
reaches the top.
SSFS, pronounced "Sisy
phus," is the Stanford Specula
tive Fiction Society, a new group
devoted to science fiction, fanta
sy and all aspects of speculative
fiction.
"Writing is kind of like rolling
a rock up a hill: once you're done,
you start at the bottom again,"
said co-president Daniel
Berdichevsky, a junior. "So
we're here to push rocks togeth
er."
Head president / Imperatrix
Elizabeth Lee, a senior, empha
sized the "speculative fiction"
part of the name because it not
only incorporates science fiction,
but also fantasy and related gen
res. The group encourages a
wide range of readers and writ
ers.
Creating original pieces is
just one goal of the group.
According to co-president
Patrick Weekes, a junior, goals
include having intelligent con
versations about speculative fic
tion and going to relevant events
such as conventions or Star
Wars. The society also plans to
put on at least one event
for Stanford by the end of this
quarter, possibly bringing in a
guest speaker from the specula
tive fiction industry.
For now, they are setting up a

home page and a steady work
shop schedule. Weekes ex
plained the workshop process:
The author gives all members a
copy of his or her piece. At the
next meeting, the writer re
mains silent while everyone else
discusses the story's strong and
weak aspects, along with its con
troversial points. In the end, the
writer asks questions, usually
pertaining to ideas on improving
the work.
"The main focus of the group
is on the writing and on helping
one another out," said Lee, who
first suggested forming a group.
"We have the same philoso
phy as the class," she said, refer
ring to the English 190 C Science
Fiction Writing course that the
three co-presidents took last
spring quarter. The class, in
structed by science fiction writ
ers Pat Murphy and Karen Joy
Fowler, largely inspired the for
mation of the society.
