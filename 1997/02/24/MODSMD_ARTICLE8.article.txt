Clinton seeks to include Chile in NAFTA
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Clinton administration is count
ing on Chile's president to push Congress toward accepting his
country into a reconstructed NAFTA as the next step toward cre
ating a Western hemisphere free trade zone.
But the idea's harshest critics aren't on Capitol Hill — they're
thousands of Americans whose jobs have gone south to Mexico.
That makes the pertinent question whether Congress will lis
ten to Eduardo Frei, its Chilean guest this week, or to folks like
Gary Hefner, unemployed American.
Hefner was laid off last month after a 30-year career at a Gen
eral Electric plant in Hickory, N.C. For 40 years, the plant made
electric transformers to power America.
Last year, Hefner and 300 co-workers received notice: Con
tending the Hickory factory was no longer profitable, GE was
shutting it down and moving the work to Monterrey, Mexico.
"They put us out to pasture because we were making $15
hourly wages and they could get the work done in Mexico for 83
cents an hour," Hefner said.
Opponents of free trade have made similar charges since Pres
ident Clinton went against labor unions and many in his own
party in 1993 to push the North American Free Trade Agreement
through Congress.
With the assistance of former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan
and Bush and a healthy dose of Republican support, Clinton won
that battle against opponents who, in the phrase of Ross Perot,
warned of a "giant sucking sound" as Mexico drained high-paying
jobs from the United States.
The 1997 replay promises an even tougher fight. Opponents
have armed themselves with statistics showing swollen trade
deficits with Mexico and Canada since NAFTA's birth.
Clinton blames factors unrelated to NAFTA. He argues that
unless Congress quickly renews his authority to expand NAFTA,
the United States risks losing to European and Asian competitors
already moving into America's economic back yard.
The president hopes by 2005 to bring not only Chile but all the
democratic nations of Latin America into what would be the
world's largest free trade zone.
Frei is coming to Washington for a Wednesday meeting with
Clinton and a speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday.
Clinton travels to Mexico in April and makes his first presidential
trip to South America the next month.
Vince Foster not murdered, Starr finds
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Whitewater independent counsel Ken
neth Starr has concluded that presidential aide Vince Foster was
not murdered and there was no cover-up in his death, the Los
Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Starr's recently completed report is the third investigation of
Foster's death from a gunshot wound 3 1/2 years ago.
"It is accurate and fulsome, and I believe it will be released
shortly," an unidentified source told the paper.
"It puts the lie to that bunch of nuts out there spinning con
spiracy theories and talking about murder and cover-ups," said
the source, whose affiliation was not disclosed in the story.
A coroner and Starr's predecessor as independent counsel,
Robert B. Fiske Jr., both declared Foster's death was a suicide,
but right-wing groups have insisted President Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were involved in a cover-up.
The Los Angeles Times didn't say if Starr's report would make
a finding beyond saying Foster's death was not murder.
Yesterday, White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn
declined to comment on the paper's report.
Starr has not indicated when he might release the report.
Friday, Starr said that he would stay with the Whitewater inves
tigation, rather than leaving it on Aug. 1 to become dean of Pepper
dine University's law school, as he had previously announced.
