# More than 100 killed in India fire
## Deaths blamed on poor accommodations, 'stampede' 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — Fire swept
through a cluster of thatched-roof buildings in
eastern India where scores of worshipers had
gathered to seek the blessing of a dead Hindu
guru yesterday, killing more than 100 people,
a government official said.
Sanjeeb Hota, home secretary of the east
ern coastal state of Orissa, said 110 bodies had
been found by late yesterday and that 165 peo
ple had been injured in the fire near the city of
Baripada. More bodies were being dug up late
yesterday, officials said.
The fire tore through the group of tempo
rary structures erected for followers of Swami
Nigamananda. The flames sent panicked wor
shipers, many of them impoverished villagers,
running for exits, Press Trust of India report
ed, quoting witnesses.

Many of the victims may have died in the
stampede, the news agency said.
The fire, about 1,250 miles southeast of
New Delhi, overwhelmed Baripada, which
has only two fire trucks, and the state gov
ernment ordered doctors from larger towns
to rush to the site.
India news agencies earlier reported that at
least 200 people had been killed and 500 were
injured, 300 of them critically. United News of
India quoted local police in Baripada as saying
that 120 bodies had been retrieved.
Some of the injured were lying on the road
leading to a local hospital waiting to be treat
ed, United News reported, and the hospital
had to put some patients on its verandah after
its rooms filled up with victims.
Hota, speaking in a telephone interview

from Bhubaneshwar, the state capital, said
the search for bodies continued but that only
a few more were likely to be recovered.
Organizers had built one huge hut and sev
eral other sheds of straw walls and thatched
roofs to serve as meeting halls and temporary
shelters, Hota said. "So it all burned really
fast," he said.
When the fire started at about 3:30 p.m.,
many of the devotees were napping in the liv
ing quarters to escape the afternoon heat, said
Hota. It was unclear, however, if all the vic
tims were in one building.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately
known, though witnesses told Press Trust an
electrical short circuit was to blame, while
United News said it may have been sparked by
the explosion of a gas cylinder used for cooking.
