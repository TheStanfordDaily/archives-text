Group claims bombings
ATLANTA (AP) — The FBI received a letter
yesterday claiming responsibility for both the abor
tion clinic bombings in Atlanta last month and Fri
day's bombing at a gay and lesbian nightclub.
The letter, purportedly from a group called the
Army of God, was mailed to the Reuters news
agency Saturday and was turned over to the FBI
yesterday.
FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore would not com
ment on the authenticity of the letter. Robert
Basler, Reuters' domestic news editor in Wash
ington, D.C., described it as "handwritten, 2 1/2
pages long and unsigned."
The letter threatened "total war" against the
federal government, said abortion would not be

tolerated and promised future attacks on homo
sexuals. It also sought to set up a system so that
claims of responsibility could be confirmed after
future bombings, Reuters reported.
'Morning-after pills' deemed safe
WASHINGTON (AP) — American women who
are raped, whose birth control fails or who just
forget in the heat of the moment can use high
doses of ordinary birth control pills to prevent
pregnancy, the government said yesterday.
The Food and Drug Administration said six
brands of birth control are safe and effective
"morning-after pills," the first federal acknowl
edgment of the emergency contraception that
European women have been prescribed for years.
