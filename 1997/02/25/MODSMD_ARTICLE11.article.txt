## Secretary of State optimistic concerning future cooperation 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — Declaring that U.S. relations
with China are the key to world stability in the 21st
century, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned Chinese officials yesterday that they must
"act constructively" and improve their country's
record on human rights.
Otherwise, she said, China could face condemna
tion by the United States and its European allies.
"I said I would tell it like it is, and I told it like it
is," Albright said of exchanges she held with Presi
dent Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese officials on
the eve of a memorial service for Deng Xiaoping.
She was the only Western leader permitted to visit
Beijing during a six-day mourning period for the
paramount leader. Albright said she considered that
"an extremely good sign" that China will move
toward even greater cooperation with the United
States.

Jiang put aside a speech he was preparing for the
service to talk to Albright for 45 minutes. Prime Min
ister Li Peng gave her an hour and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen, two hours and 45 minutes.
Albright, speaking first at the U.S. Embassy and
then at a joint news conference with Qian, signaled
the Clinton administration's commitment to improv
ing relations with Beijing. But she noted differences
over human rights and a growing trade deficit — $39
billion last year up from $33 billion in 1995.
"There is no question our relations with the Chi
nese are a key to stability as we go into the 21st cen
tury," she told some 100 U.S. Embassy workers and
family members.
Albright, on her first foreign tour as secretary of
state, was received with respect by Chinese officials.
With the Beijing stop Albright concluded a nine
country, 11-day worldwide trip to Europe and Asia.
