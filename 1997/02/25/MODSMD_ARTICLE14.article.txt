Community farming
gives Stanford students
a sunny place to learn

Although Stanford's
academic rigor drew most
students here, the geograph
ic appeal of the West Coast is a not
too-distant second in creating the
University's attraction. The Bay
Area weather unquestionably
offers a tremendous advantage over
Stanford's Eastern competitors.
Aside from the constant sun
shine, the right combination of dry
and wet seasons and a fairly moder
ate temperature make Stanford
and the entire Bay Area a great
place to garden.
The "Stanford Community
Farm," recently proposed by
senior Brian Halweil, is proof that
with a little initiative the weather
is more than something to bask
in. His community farming pro
posal, which combines the aca
demic benefits of learning to cul
tivate land with a way to allow
more students to take advantage
of the Bay Area's agreeable cli
mate, is to be commended.
The idea behind the proposal is
that students involved in the farm
would use the land that was set
aside for gardening purposes by
the University more than 20 years
ago. Although anyone can use the
land now, very few of the 40 plots
are cultivated.
According to Halweil, an earth
systems and biology major, the
farm will be "bio-intensive," mean
ing that all farming methods will
be organic and labor-intensive. His
proposal outlines how the farm will
serve as a "multidisiplinary labora
tory for the study of agroforestry,
animal husbandry, botany, busi
ness operations, ecology, entomolo
gy, land restoration, landscape
design, philosophy, rural sociology,
soil science, solar technology, sus
tainable agriculture and zoology."

Such a vast application of theoreti
cal models to a practical field must
be applauded and looked on as an
example of how students can trans
fer classroom knowledge to the real
world.
Another advantage of this pro
posal is that Halweil has asked very
little of the University. Since the
farm will employ composting tech
niques, it won't depend on large
amounts of external input. A Palo
Alto environmental group, Magic,
Inc., will even provide fruit trees to
the site at no charge.
The organizers of this activity
fully intend for the farm to operate
independently â€” a spot has been
reserved at next summer's Palo
Alto Farmer's Market for produce
sales. Halweil predicts that sales
alone should eventually provide
enough revenue to pay for the oper
ation of the farm for an entire year.
Farming and gardening efforts
are rare on campus but not non
existent. For instance, students liv
ing in Escondido Village have the
option of gardening in Escondido's
community garden area.
In fact, so many students are
interested in the opportunity to
garden that there is a waiting list to
receive a plot. Perhaps now, some of
these wait-listed residents will be
able to cultivate their crops on the
community farm.
The advantage of the farm to the
remainder of the Stanford commu
nity is obvious. If a student is inter
ested in exploring bio-intensive
ways of growing his or her own
food, there is only so much that can
be done within the boundaries of
dorm or co-op living circumstances.
Having a plant here or there, or
maybe even a window box garden
probably won't suffice.
Hopefully Halweil's efforts are
only the beginning. A few of the
undergraduate residences, like Chi
Theta Chi, have embarked on their
own unique visions of community
farming. Perhaps the Stanford
Community Farm will be the cata
lyst to motivate other students to
do the same.
