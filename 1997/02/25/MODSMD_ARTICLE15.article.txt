A condemned Bridge leaves students without support

THURSDAY'S DAILY FEATURED
ail article detailing the Universi
ty's latest efforts to take over the
Bridge building. Already the two-story
structure next to the Bridge has been
torn down, and with the recent con
demning of the Bridge's second floor,
demolition of the peer counseling center
seems imminent.
I object to the University's efforts to
raze the Bridge, and I call for students to
consider the following points.
As Dean of Students Marc Wais cor
rectly notes, the Bridge is a nationally
recognized model for peer counseling
that works. The Bridge provides an
invaluable service to the student commu
nity. Not only do students in need of sup
port benefit from peer counseling at the
Bridge, but also the student counselors
themselves grow and learn in ways fun
damental to the development of the lead
ership skills Stanford so prides itself on

fostering. Admittedly I, like most stu
dents, have never sought out help at the
Bridge. However, I know many people
who have used the resources available at
the Bridge, and their response is unani
mously one of gratitude and deep satis
faction.
In addition, live-in space is essential to
the spirit and function of high-quality
peer-counseling. Moving such services to
a sterile cubicle in Tresidder Union
would certainly decrease the effective
ness of live-in service if not end it alto
gether. We must find a way to preserve
the atmosphere that has proven to be
effective.
The logical way to pursue this preser
vation is to renovate the Bridge building.
To say that the University cannot afford
such a project reeks of hypocrisy and hid
den agendas. Stanford has enough
money to rebuild the Bridge completely
if it so desired.

It is certainly a hollow excuse to argue
that the building should be torn down
because of damage sustained in the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. What building
on campus hasn't had to undergo seismic
retrofitting because of the quake? Why
shouldn't the Bridge receive the tender
and costly loving care being accorded all
of the other structures on campus? It
seems that because the Bridge building
houses two student groups instead of
administrative offices or classrooms, the
University sees an opportunity to rede
velop a chunk of prime real estate.
This brings me to my last two points.
I say "groups" because the rear of the
Bridge building is home to the Stanford
Hunger Relief Network's freezer and
refrigerator. There, some 300,000
pounds of food leftover from dining facil
ities around campus have been stored in
order to transport to hunger relief agen
cies in the local community.

Without the Bridge building's freezer
room, Spoon's food salvaging efforts and
the hundreds of mouths it feeds everyday
would be severely hurt. What more
important things than peer counseling
and food salvaging does the University
have planned for this space? Is it 15
more parking spaces? With groups all
over campus clamoring for any small
portion of office and meeting space, it
makes sense to rebuild a multipurpose
facility for the use of student groups, but
I sincerely do not believe that is the plan.
In closing, I leave you with a chal
lenge. The University is responsible for a
lot of the things people find objectionable
on this campus. The irony is that Stan
ford is our campus, our community. We,
the students, are the University. It's up
to us to take hold of the reins on some of
these issues before it's too late.
