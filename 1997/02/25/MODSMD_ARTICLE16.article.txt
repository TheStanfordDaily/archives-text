# Co-ops are last frontier for interaction between grads and undergrads
## 
### 
I am writing to voice my grave con
cern over the cavalier attitude projected
by Stanford's housing administrators in
The Daijy's Friday article on graduate
student housing in co-ops. These people
are nonchalantly proposing to close
down the last remaining venue for
equal-basis interaction between gradu
ate and undergraduate students unless
the houses' five or six resident assistants
come up with compelling reasons not to
do so.
For some reason incomprehensible to
me or to any of my undergraduate or
graduate student friends, the Stanford
administration is relentlessly and almost
imperceptibly moving to encourage, per

petuate and cast in imitation stone a
complete polarization of the Stanford
campus based on a ridiculous stereotype
of irreconcilable distinctions between
students who have a bachelor's degree
and those who do not.
We have different "needs" they say,
and after a fashion they are right. The
undergraduate experience is based on
diversity of choices and interactions,
whereas post-bachelor's education tends
to require specialization and focus. This
warrants a number of distinctions
between the way a university treats the
two, no question about that. But Stan
ford sometimes pushes these distinc
tions to inhumane extremes.
I wonder if any of the administrators
in charge of housing ever looked up the
word "college" (small "c") in a dictio
nary. The college experience is about
people coming together. Any policy deny
ing those students who wish to enjoy for
a quarter or two the chance to interact

more regularly with a different culture
or a different age group attacks the very
basis of what a university is all about.
What undergraduate has not once
wished for a few hours of uninterrupted
study time in a cloister in the basement
of the Architecture Library or the fourth
floor of Terman? What graduate student
has not had the occasional longing for a
day or two of boisterous community
(and I do not mean Miyake!) unencum
bered by a collective National Science
Foundation grant deadline?
The truth is that more frequent
interactions between Stanford's under
graduate and graduate populations
would make for a much healthier atmo
sphere. And today, following the exclu
sion of undergraduates from Crothers
Memorial Hall in 1993, and the disman
tling of the Manzanita trailer park in
1995, the co-ops are the last remaining
place in Stanford where it is still con
ceivable that a graduate student and

undergraduate student can share a
room, a water fountain, an industrial
strength stainless steel sink or a mid
night bull session.
I am writing this letter in hope of
gathering support for the idea that the
caretakers of Stanford need to afford us
students more, not fewer, chances to
have such interactions. I'm sorry, folks,
but the teaching assistant office and the
self-op eating associate dining table are
just not going to do when they become
the last places where one could even con
ceive of making friends across the gradu
ate-undergraduate divide.
And, let's face it, if Stanford wants to
be more than a Web site (albeit one with
a very high hit-rate) at the end of the
21st century, this is exactly the sort of
issue that any administrator with an
institutional survival instinct must rack
his or her brains to address.
