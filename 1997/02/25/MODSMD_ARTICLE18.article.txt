## Can't you hear the music? 
### 
MY FRIEND BRAD once said that
music is one of the three truly
good things about life. The other
two, he said at the time, were sex and gold.
Now, I suppose I must add that this was a
drug-induced revelation, and depending
on your viewpoint that may either amplify
or diminish the power of his insight. Per
sonally, I think he's brilliant.
I was lucky enough to see the traveling
production of "Stomp" a few nights ago.
At the risk of sounding like a carnival
barker, I can only describe "Stomp" as a
completely non-verbal, percussion- and
dance-oriented whirlwind of intensity.
The players, dressed like hobos and
vagrants set in a post-industrial cacopho
ny of metal, garbage and household
appliances, set out to prove that music
can be made from the most banal of
materials. With a little coordination, a
basic sense of rhythm and some desire,
they bring Zippo lighters, matchboxes
and plastic bags together to create a sym
phony. Just when you think that they've
used everything but the kitchen sink,
they bring out five kitchen sinks.
We all love music. It gives us back
ground noise for our studying, parties and
lovemaking, and in times of despair we
even gain romantic insight from the lyrics.
Yet despite the incredible pleasure we take
from it, we often allow music to occupy a
constrained, segmented part of our lives.

There are only certain times when we
allow it to be appropriate, and we let the
so-called professionals dictate the sounds
that we hear. We feel comfortable scream
ing out "Fuck you, I won't do what you tell
me!" in our cars with the windows closed
or singing sappy Billy Joel songs in the
shower, but we refrain from truly public
displays and allow our personal creativity
to cany us on the wave of our own collec
tive sound. We stare at people who whistle
on their way to class and raise eyebrows at
our peers who sing to themselves. Why?
Maybe we want music to be a private
experience. Maybe we don't like having
another person's taste inflict on our
own. Maybe we've become so concerned
with violating each other's personal
space that we can no longer share a com
mon love. Or perhaps, despite our end
less quests to demonstrate our individu
al uniqueness, we're still afraid to draw
attention to ourselves and explore the
limits of our own spontaneous creativity.
But what if that changed?
Like it or not, music is a public good. We
thankfully do not live in silence, and thus
we are surrounded by chords, beats and
chaotic noise. Birds sing, cars honk and the
wind softly blows through the grass. We
hear it, but we don't really listen.
Add in just a little bit of human coor
dination, or a consensual effort, and a
door opens to anthropogenic harmony.

The tools are all around us. We don't
need traditional instruments, we don't
need concert halls, and we don't need
pseudo-emotional a capella. Instead, we
have makeshift bongos, limitless open
amphitheaters and our own personal
ingenious melodies. Karl Marx would say
that as a community we should rise up
and reject the bourgeois corporate
paradigm. I just say we can make beauti
ful music together.
What if we no longer remained an
admiring audience and became musical
inventors? What if we hit our handlebars,
drummed on the pavement, hummed and
screamed, by ourselves and together with
strangers? What if the incessant con
struction around us became the beats,
the hum of 50-foot cranes gave us a bass
line and we provided the voice? We will
never control sound, but we may tem
porarily harness it and revel in its force.
Stand in the middle of the Quad, close
your eyes, think about sex and gold, and
listen carefully, for you may hear a new
Stanford symphony.

Rahul Young, a senior majoring in pub
lic policy, really liked "Stomp," but it
wasn't nearly as inspiring as the Bon
Jovi concert he saw in Japan.
