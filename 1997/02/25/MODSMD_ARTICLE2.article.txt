## Phone system doesn't let users switch companies

The structure of Stanford's telephone system
hampers students trying to save money on interna
tional telephone calls.
Sean Ward, a graduate student in German Studies,
found a particular telephone service that offered en
ticing rates for international calls. When he attempt
ed to switch, he was unable to.
"I see it as something a lot of foreign graduate stu
dents would benefit from,"he said.
With this service, a student would call a toll-free
number established by the switching company that
would automatically recognize the telephone number
and bill the student's account.
He investigated offers from Telegroup and Kali
back. Telegroup, an lowa telecommunications firm,
offers rates as low as 24 cents a minute to Germany,
the country Ward calls the most.
A student using such a plan could save between 49
cents and 31 cents a minute compared to Student
Communication Services' rates, depending upon the
time of day. This saves students making an hour of
calls each week to Germany about $780 a year.
Representatives from Telegroup speculated that

the reason they could not establish
an account for the student was be
cause Stanford operates on a pri
vate branch exchange system,
which consolidates a certain num
ber of phone lines into one billable
unit.
Phone companies "don't recog
nize it as a residence," said Vicki
Hallett, manager of client services
for Student Communication Ser
vices. "They recognize it as Stan
ford."

Many small companies, apart
ment complexes and college cam
puses use this method. Instead of
establishing a telephone line for
each person, phone companies al
locate a set number of available
lines. These lines are rotated
through the system depending on
demand. This, however, hinders
attempts by outside companies like
Telegroup to recognize the source
of individual phone calls. There
fore, they are unable to bill the cus
tomer.
Telegroup representatives said
they traditionally have difficulty
connecting this particular service
on college campuses.

Hallett said that unless the
campus telephone system is
changed, "there is no way they can
get it."
She said she never spoke to
Ward about this matter and pur
sued the issue with the two compa
nies to discern specifically why they
could not bill the student.
Student Communication Ser
vices plans a number of changes for
next year, one of which is the possi
ble implementation of a caller iden
tification service to campus tele
phones. With the help of Pacific
Bell and other long-distance carri
ers, it hopes to have this service
available by September.
