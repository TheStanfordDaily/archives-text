# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Have you considered Henry Ford's bigotry lately? 
### 
ON JULY 30, 1938, his 75th birth
day, Henry Ford was awarded the
Supreme Order of the German
Eagle, the Nazi government's highest
honor for a non-German. It was presented
with Hitler's congratulations.
On Nov. 9, 1938, and into the following
morning, the Nazi Party's brown-shirted
storm troopers, along with SS and
Gestapo forces, attacked Jewish homes,
places of business and synagogues. That
night — known as Kristallnacht, or the
night of broken glass — marked Ger
many's transition from anti-Semitic
repression and persecution to anti-Semitic
murder and violence; 1,000 Jews were
killed and 30,000 arrested.
On Dec. 15, 1993, Steven Spielberg's
"Schindler's List" premiered. The film,
depicting the successful effort of one profi
teering German to save more than 1,000
Jews from the Third Reich's death camps,
was the first serious, major-studio motion
picture to examine the Holocaust. It went
on to win seven Academy Awards, includ
ing best picture and best director, and has
been seen by 67 million people worldwide.
On Feb. 23, 1997, NBC broadcast
"Schindler's List" without commercial
interruptions and with the sponsorship of
the Ford Motor Company.
NBC and Ford have received uniformly

positive publicity for their partnership to
present a commercial-free "Schindler's
List." The reactions have been amusing,
for while NBC was founded by David
Sarnoff, a Jew, Ford was founded, of
course, by Henry Ford, a fierce anti-Semite.
The Order of the German Eagle was
bestowed on Ford prior to Kristallnacht,
but public awareness of Hitler's deadly
anti-Semitism would likely not have affect
ed the tycoon's willingness to accept Nazi
commendations. Ford was a man who
allegedly helped financed Hitler's Beerhall
Putsch and is rumored to have sent the
Fuhrer $50,000 each year on his birthday.
In 1918, Ford purchased The Dearborn
Independent, a weekly newspaper located
in the Detroit suburb where the Ford
Motor Co. was — and is — located. On May
22, 1920, The Independent ran "The
International Jew: The World's Problem,"
the first in a series of unsigned, front-page
screeds. For the next 91 weeks, The Inde
pendent hammered home the same anti-
Semitic arguments. Short skirts and
rolled-down stockings were the evil work
of Jewish garment dealers. Rising rents
were thanks to Jewish landlords' greed.
"The present government of Russia was
transported almost as a unit from the
East Side of New York," proving
that "the Bolshevik revolution was a care

fully groomed investment on the part of
international Jewish finance." Not only
did Jews start the Russian Revolution,
The Independent claimed, but also the
U.S. Civil War and World War I. The arti
cles stopped in January 1922 at Ford's
order — and under threat of lawsuits and
after the realization they could hurt in a
possible presidential bid.
Ford also published "The Protocols of
the Elders of Zion" and is the only Ameri
can to be mentioned in "Mein Kampf."
Isaac Charchat, a Swedish Jew who
infiltrated Nazi Party headquarters in
1925 to spy for German Zionists discovered
that "The International Jew" was a key
text for Nazi indoctrination.
"The teachings of the Nazi Party was
Henry Ford's doctrine," Charchat told
Reuters in the 1980s. "This was the text
book of the Nazi party," he said, pointing to
a collection of Ford's writings.
Yes, Ford did call off The Independent's
tirades, and yes, he did eventually retract
his overt anti-Semitism, but so what? Had
Hitler, in 1942 or 1943, pulled back the
Wehrmact, shut off the Auschwitz ovens
and said he was sorry, would that have
absolved him of his guilt? It is difficult to
believe that Ford's change of heart was
anything more than a PR gambit.
And now, more than 50 years after Ger

many's unconditional surrender and
Hitler's suicide, Ford sponsored the televi
sion broadcast of the most important movie
made about the Holocaust. Am I the only
one who sees something wrong with this?
It's not as though we're talking about a
company separate and distinct from its fas
cist founder. The Ford Motor (Jo. was pri
vately held by the Ford family until the
mid-19505, and even now the family
retains 40 percent control. Henry, bus son
and then his grandson ran the company
until 1979, and while its current chairman
and CEO is a non-Ford, William Ford 2nd
is poised to become the new head honcho
within a few years. In other words, Henry
Ford's legacy of anti-Semitism cannot be
separated from the company he created.
Incredibly, Ford spokespeople do not
even attempt to present the company's
sponsorship of "Schindler's List" as a mea
sure of atonement — albeit a small one —
for Henry's bigotry. A Ford vice president
told The New York Times the history "did
not enter at all" into the company's deci
sion. An executive with Ford's advertising
agency said the sponsorship was in no way
"an apology for or trying to offset" the
founder's rabid anti-Semitism.
Ford's sponsorship of "Schindler's List"
seems to be nothing more than a shameless
and, considering the sponsor, tasteless trrab

for an advertising boon.
It is estimated ford spends betweer $40
and $50 million annually on advertising.
During the 1996 Superbowl alone, Ford
spent $3.3 million on ad time to push its
trucks and pickups. That considered, the
estimated $1 to $5 million Ford has spent
to sponsor "Schindler's List" is an inconse
quential sum. For that money, Ford
received screen time during the broadcast,
which was seen by more than 65 million
Americans, according to NBC. (Ford ran a
60-second ad both before and after the film,
as well as the company's logo on-screen for
the two intermissions.) Furthermore,
every advertisement for the broadcast —
and NBC ran plugs during the highest
rated television programs on the air —
mentioned Ford's sponsorship.
The Ford Motor Co. has never apolo
gized for its founder's anti-Semitism. It
spent a pittance of its $4.14 billion in annu
al revenues to sponsor "Schindler's List,"
and in so doing got piles of good publicity.
For some reason, though, I still have a hard
time thanking Ford for its benevolence.
