## Monday night basketball Hoops crushes smaller Aztecs 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
If San Diego State was looking to find any
relief from its four-game losing streak, it came to
the wrong place yesterday evening.
The Aztecs, 1-6 since the team's starting cen
ter and forward were suspended last month and
playing their fourth road game in an 11-day span,
collided head on with an extremely unsympathet
ic Stanford team last night before 3,524 at Maples
Pavilion. The No. 25 Cardinal (16-7), eager to
bounce back from Saturday's 14-point loss to
Washington, showed San Diego State no mercy,
taking it early and often to the clearly outmanned
Aztecs (12-13).
The result: a 97-50 pummeling — the worst
loss in San Diego State school history — in what
amounts to little more than a tuneup for Stan
ford's Saturday morning showdown against Cali
fornia.
"When you're hurtin', you need somebody like
us to come to town and make you feel awfully
good and get you ready for the weekend," said
San Diego State head coach Fred Trenkle.
With this game behind them, the Cardinal can
now turn its full attention to the crucial three
game stretch that lies ahead. Stanford, which
faces Cal on Saturday, No. 13 Arizona on March
6, and Arizona State on March 8, cannot lose any
of its three remaining games without seriously
jeopardizing its NCAA tournament hopes.
"Now the season starts for us," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "We've put ourselves in
a position now where we have a chance, and we've
got to be ready to go."
They were more than ready on this night. The
Cardinal, dominating the Aztecs at virtually
every position on the floor, shot a scintillating 56
percent from the floor — including an eye-pop
ping 11-of-17 from three-point range, for a sea
son-high 65 percent — while holding San Diego
State to the lowest point total of any Stanford
opponent this season.
Freshman Ryan Mendez (4-of-5 three-point
ers) and sophomore Kris Weems led the offensive
parade with 14 points apiece, with freshman
David Moseley checking in at 13. But perhaps
most impressive was the play of freshman for
ward Mark Madsen, who continues to improve his
game while seeing more and more minutes due to
the limited playing time of ailing center Tim
Young.
Madsen, who finished with 12 points and seven
rebounds, has begun coming into his own in
recent weeks. The 6-foot-8 forward is averaging
11.2 points and eight rebounds over the past four
games. His dunk over San Diego State forward
Ephraim Salaam in the second half last night
helped cap a 10-0 run that stretched Stanford's
lead to 31 and put the game effectively out of
reach.
"With Madsen, we have a physical player com
ing off the bench, and I can put him at either the
four or the five," Montgomery said. "He would
have been playing probably like this in December
had he not missed seven weeks [with a stress frac
ture in his back] after two years off.
"He had no experience. Everything he had to
learn was on the go. He's helping us more and
more as we go along."
"It's coming back slowly," Madsen said. "Early
in the season it was just ridiculous — I was get
ting blocked like three or four times a game. I feel
like my leg strength is getting better. And more
than leg strength, I think it's just me learning
how to play at this level."
Meanwhile, Young showed improvement in a
10-point, nine-rebound performance. The 7-foot
-1 sophomore has seen limited action over the past
two weeks because of a sore back, but his 26 min
utes last night marked a team high.
"He seems to be feeling a little bit better and
his movement's better," Montgomery said. "We'll
have a couple more days where we can rest him a
little bit and then he's got to be ready to go. He's
got to step in and contribute."
With the victory, Stanford improves to 9-0 this
season at Maples Pavilion, where it has won 35 of
its last 38 games. But all that matters now for the
Cardinal is the next three.
"We're in a situation now where we've got
tough games, but at least they're at home," Mont
gomery said. "Mostly it's a mental thing, to get
ourselves ready to play as well as we possibly can
in the last two weeks of the season."

If San Diego State was looking to find any
relief from its four-game losing streak, it came to
the wrong place yesterday evening.
The Aztecs, 1-6 since the team's starting cen
ter and forward were suspended last month and
playing their fourth road game in an 11-day span,
collided head on with an extremely unsympathet
ic Stanford team last night before 3,524 at Maples
Pavilion. The No. 25 Cardinal (16-7), eager to
bounce back from Saturday's 14-point loss to
Washington, showed San Diego State no mercy,
taking it early and often to the clearly outmanned
Aztecs (12-13).
The result: a 97-50 pummeling — the worst
loss in San Diego State school history — in what
amounts to little more than a tuneup for Stan
ford's Saturday morning showdown against Cali
fornia.
"When you're hurtin', you need somebody like
us to come to town and make you feel awfully
good and get you ready for the weekend," said
San Diego State head coach Fred Trenkle.
With this game behind them, the Cardinal can
now turn its full attention to the crucial three
game stretch that lies ahead. Stanford, which
faces Cal on Saturday, No. 13 Arizona on March
6, and Arizona State on March 8, cannot lose any
of its three remaining games without seriously
jeopardizing its NCAA tournament hopes.
"Now the season starts for us," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "We've put ourselves in
a position now where we have a chance, and we've
got to be ready to go."
They were more than ready on this night. The
Cardinal, dominating the Aztecs at virtually
every position on the floor, shot a scintillating 56
percent from the floor — including an eye-pop
ping 11-of-17 from three-point range, for a sea
son-high 65 percent — while holding San Diego
State to the lowest point total of any Stanford
opponent this season.
Freshman Ryan Mendez (4-of-5 three-point
ers) and sophomore Kris Weems led the offensive
parade with 14 points apiece, with freshman
David Moseley checking in at 13. But perhaps
most impressive was the play of freshman for
ward Mark Madsen, who continues to improve his
game while seeing more and more minutes due to
the limited playing time of ailing center Tim
Young.
Madsen, who finished with 12 points and seven
rebounds, has begun coming into his own in
recent weeks. The 6-foot-8 forward is averaging
11.2 points and eight rebounds over the past four
games. His dunk over San Diego State forward
Ephraim Salaam in the second half last night
helped cap a 10-0 run that stretched Stanford's
lead to 31 and put the game effectively out of
reach.
"With Madsen, we have a physical player com
ing off the bench, and I can put him at either the
four or the five," Montgomery said. "He would
have been playing probably like this in December
had he not missed seven weeks [with a stress frac
ture in his back] after two years off.
"He had no experience. Everything he had to
learn was on the go. He's helping us more and
more as we go along."
"It's coming back slowly," Madsen said. "Early
in the season it was just ridiculous — I was get
ting blocked like three or four times a game. I feel
like my leg strength is getting better. And more
than leg strength, I think it's just me learning
how to play at this level."
Meanwhile, Young showed improvement in a
10-point, nine-rebound performance. The 7-foot
-1 sophomore has seen limited action over the past
two weeks because of a sore back, but his 26 min
utes last night marked a team high.
"He seems to be feeling a little bit better and
his movement's better," Montgomery said. "We'll
have a couple more days where we can rest him a
little bit and then he's got to be ready to go. He's
got to step in and contribute."
With the victory, Stanford improves to 9-0 this
season at Maples Pavilion, where it has won 35 of
its last 38 games. But all that matters now for the
Cardinal is the next three.
"We're in a situation now where we've got
tough games, but at least they're at home," Mont
gomery said. "Mostly it's a mental thing, to get
ourselves ready to play as well as we possibly can
in the last two weeks of the season."
