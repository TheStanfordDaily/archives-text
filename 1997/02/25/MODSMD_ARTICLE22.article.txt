# Softball surprises in Poway
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The unranked Stanford softball team
exceeded all realistic expectations this
weekend by placing second in the San
Diego State Invitational in Poway, which
included four nationally ranked teams.
The team picked up five wins along with
two losses to tie Long Beach State for the
tournament's best record.
The Cardinal (9-7) came out of the gates
strong, manhandling 22nd-ranked Hawaii
in its first game Thursday, winning 7-2. It
was a great response to the question on
how the Cardinal would handle its two
close losses earlier in the week to second
ranked UCLA.
The highlights of the Hawaii game
included a strong pitching performance by
sophomore pitcher Becky Blevins, who
recorded six strikeouts, and a big home
run in the sixth inning by sophomore
pinch hitter Shane Anderson. The home
run brought in two runs and delivered the
knockout blow to the Rainbows.
Game two allowed the Cardinal to taste
a little bit of sweet revenge as the Card beat
15th-ranked Cal State-Northridge 3-2. The
Matadors had beaten the squad twice earli
er in the year, both by close margins.
"The Northridge game was the high
light for me and probably for much of the
team," Blevins said. "We knew that we
should have beat them the first time we
played them and to do it this weekend gave

us a lot of satisfaction."
Game three proved to be the Marcy
Crouch show, with the sophomore's pitch
ing and offensive performance being
strong contributors to the close 4-3 victory
over Arkansas. Crouch had much better
control this weekend than in earlier season
performances, limiting herself to two base
on balls for the game.
Accompanying Crouch's improved
placement of the ball was her usual power,
emanating in five strikeouts. Crouch also
contributed to her own cause on the
mound by driving in two runs, the last of
which was the game-winner, in the sixth
inning.
The worst loss of the tournament for
the Cardinal came in game four against
fifth-ranked Michigan. The score was 6-1,
but Michigan only scored two earned runs,
with the Cardinal having a breakdown in
the fourth inning. Michigan scored four
runs on four Stanford errors in the fourth.
"There is no way we are going to beat
the fifth-ranked team in the country when
we have that many walks and errors, espe
cially in one inning. In this way the Michi
gan game may have been one of the better
lessons we learned this weekend," Blevins
said. Blevins went the distance in the loss,
striking out four and walking three.
The Cardinal actually had more hits
than the Wolverines, eight compared to
Michigan's six. It was the poor timing of
