# Men gymnasts close gap on Cal
## Stanford vaults to new heights but Bears prevail by four 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
This weekend, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team showed
what it could accomplish when it
puts its mind (and body) to it.
After weeks of hard work,
therapy and training, the Cardi
nal men raised their collective
score by more than eight points
from their last competition to
227.975 at Saturday's competi
tion against California, closing
the margin of victory to less than
five points.
Cal posted a 232.25 despite sit

ting out two of its top all
arounders, seniors David Kruse
and Trent Wells, for most of the
night's events.
Nonetheless, Stanford's
marked improvement lent validi
ty to its high expectations for the
season — a berth in the NCAA
finals and another national cham
pionship.
The Stanford squad expressed
satisfaction and amazement at
the team's performance.
"Oh my God," said junior co
captain Clarence Miao. "I can't
believe we improved by eight
points."

The Cardinal gymnasts raised
the performance level a notch in
their home opener. Senior Keith
Wiley placed second in the all
around, less then one-tenth of a
point behind Cal's Oleg Kosyak.
Wiley scored a 57.85, an average
of 9.64 on each event.
Freshman Jason Katsampes
also put in an exemplary effort in
his first meet at Stanford, racking
up a total of 56.8 in the all
around, good for third. In his last
meet, Katsampes scored a 52.3.
"Oh my God! I thought [the
meet] was so good," Katsampes
said. "I thought it was a consis
tent meet for me, but I can
improve on small misses on each
routine.
"I'm not really concerned
about the other people or other
scores; I'm just trying to do my
best out there — the best for the
team."
Both Cardinal freshmen had
impressive performances as Craig
Nesbitt contributed two solid rou
tines — a 9.0 on rings and 9.4 on
parallel bars.
Stanford had strong showings
on both the vault and pommel
horse. Both Wiley and senior lan
Bachrach tied with Kosyak for
first on the event with a 9.7.
Additionally, Wiley and junior
Jeremy Herman posted 9.675s on
the pommel horse, good enough
for second on the apparatus.
However, mistakes caused the
men to falter on the high bar,
usually a high-scoring event.
On the high bar, the Card was
forced to count its only sub-9
score with senior Jamie Ellis' 8.9.
Each event tallies the top four of
six scores.
Overall Stanford needs to
work on polish and consistency.
The meet set the momentum for
the rest of the season. The Cardi
nal will work on continuing to
improve at each competition.
"We still have some major
flaws that we need to correct,"
said senior lan Bachrach. "We
can be a lot cleaner as a team; the
crispness is not there."
