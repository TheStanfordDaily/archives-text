# Small consolation
## Men's netters fall to Wildcats, take ninth 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
squad (5-1) has until May before
the National Championships in
Southern California.
Time is what the young squad
needs, as it learned over the
weekend at the National Indoor
Championships in Louisville,
Ky., when the undefeated and
top-seeded Cardinal fell to the
No. 18 Wildcats of Kentucky in
the first round of play.
"It was obviously a big disap
pointment for us to lose in the
first round against Kentucky,
but it has happened before," said
head coach Dick Gould. "They
are a very good team who is capa
ble of beating us."
Conference rival UCLA won
the championship, defeating
Georgia in an exciting match 4-3.
On Thursday, Stanford had
its first close match of the 1997

seasons, losing to the Wildcats 4-
3. Stanford has won the indoor
championship nine times in its
history but has also lost to the
Wildcats three times in the tour
nament. The Wildcats defeated
Stanford in 1987 and 1989 as
well.
Stanford was able to grab the
doubles point against Kentucky,
with Stanford's No. 1 team of
Ryan Wolters and Paul Goldstein
beating Kentucky's Carlos Drada
and Marcus Fluitt 8-5. The No. 3
team, 30th-ranked senior Grant
Elliott and freshman Geoff
Abrams, defeated Ariel Gaitan
and Dan Spaner 8-5.
But this was not enough. The
Wildcats were too much for the
Card in the singles, winning four
of the six matches.
"The indoors was tough, and
this was a definite learning expe
rience for us," said freshman
Mike Bryan. "They definitely
exposed our weaknesses."

His brother, Bob, agreed,
pointing to the indoor play as dif
ficult for the young collegiate
players. "The courts were like
greased lightning," Bob Bryan
said.
While the Card lost to Ken
tucky, falling to the consolation
bracket of the tournament, there
were individual triumphs
nonetheless. Goldstein, current
ly ranked 17th in the nation, eas
ily ousted Kentucky junior
Ludde Sundin 6-1, 6-2. Sundin is
ranked fifth in the nation.
A bruised but resilient Cardi
nal moved into the consolation
bracket Friday where it faced No.
12 Louisiana State. Proving that
Stanford is still a great team
after a difficult loss, the Card
ousted LSU 6-1.
"They are a great team, and
we had to fight like crazy to win
that match," Gould said. Stan-
ford won all of the singles match
es against the Fighting Tigers
except at the No. 3 position,
where Mike Bryan fell to LSU's
Michel Chmela 6-2, 6-1.
In the doubles, Stanford duos
of Goldstein and Wolters and
Elliott and Abrams eked out
wins, both taking LSU 9-8.
Freshman twins Bob and Mike
Bryan fell at the No. 2 spot in the
doubles, losing 9-8.
"We lost three doubles match
es in a row," Bob Bryan said. "I
can't remember the last time
that we did that. We need to
come back and work harder."
The match of the day in sin
gles against the Tigers was
Elliott's upset over 46th-ranked
Gus Fernandez 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
"Grant did not have a good
day against Kentucky, but he
came back and played great ten
nis on Friday," Gould said of his
sole senior player and team cap
tain.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
headed to the finals of the conso
lation bracket where it took on
No. 7 Texas in another 4-3 out
come, but this time, the win went
to Stanford.
"This match could have gone
either way," Gould said. "This
was a great win because the guys
came back and pulled it out
against teams that really came
right at us."
Stanford's win against Texas
earned the Cardinal a ninth
place finish, tying with Missis
sippi State.
The Card lost the doubles
point for the first time in the
tournament against Texas,
when Bob and Mike Bryan fell to
the Longhorn's ninth-ranked
Nick and Paul Crowell 8-6.
Elliott and Abrams lost to Jack
Brasington and Eric Allen 8-5,
but they still were able to take
the Longhorns in the singles.

Only Elliott won easily, crush
ing Allen in straight sets 6-3, 6-2.
All other five players for the
Card fought three set battles or
tiebreaks.
At the Nos. 2 and 3 positions
respectively, Goldstein and Bob
Bryan won in three sets. Gold
stein defeated No. 72 Paul Mar
tin 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. Bob Bryan
came from behind to win 2-6, 6-
4, 6-2.
"The guys played extremely
tough and competitive tennis
against the Longhorns," Gould
said. "It could have gone either
way."
Wolters defeated 76th-ranked

B.J. Stearns 7-6, 6-4 while Mike
Bryan and Abrams fell to
Longhorns' No. 65 Brasington
and Mark Loughlin in tight
matches, 6-3, 7-6 and 6-3, 6-7, 7-
6, respectively.
Although the Card placed
much lower than it had hoped,
considering its top seeding, Stan
ford was not unhappy with their
performance.
"It felt good to get out there
and get two wins against strong
teams," Gould said. "We never
like to lose in the first round, but
it is not an upset in my mind, per
se. Our three freshmen got an
opportunity to see what the com

petition is like out there.
"People have to remember we
are a young team. It will take us
a little while to get everything
together."
Stanford will be back in
action today when they take on
San Jose State at home. The
match will take place at 1:30
p.m. in the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
San Jose State should be an
easy match for the Card. In fact,
Stanford is resting its top two
players in Wolters and Goldstein.
Juniors Misha Palecek had
Charles Hoeveler will receive
some match play.
