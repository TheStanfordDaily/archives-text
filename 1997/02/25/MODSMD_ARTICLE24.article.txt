# Small consolation
## Men's netters fall to Wildcats, take ninth 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
squad (5-1) has until May before
the National Championships in
Southern California.
Time is what the young squad
needs, as it learned over the
weekend at the National Indoor
Championships in Louisville,
Ky., when the undefeated and
top-seeded Cardinal fell to the
No. 18 Wildcats of Kentucky in
the first round of play.
"It was obviously a big disap
pointment for us to lose in the
first round against Kentucky,
but it has happened before," said
head coach Dick Gould. "They
are a very good team who is capa
ble of beating us."
Conference rival UCLA won
the championship, defeating
Georgia in an exciting match 4-3.
On Thursday, Stanford had
its first close match of the 1997

seasons, losing to the Wildcats 4-
3. Stanford has won the indoor
championship nine times in its
history but has also lost to the
Wildcats three times in the tour
nament. The Wildcats defeated
Stanford in 1987 and 1989 as
well.
Stanford was able to grab the
doubles point against Kentucky,
with Stanford's No. 1 team of
Ryan Wolters and Paul Goldstein
beating Kentucky's Carlos Drada
and Marcus Fluitt 8-5. The No. 3
team, 30th-ranked senior Grant
Elliott and freshman Geoff
Abrams, defeated Ariel Gaitan
and Dan Spaner 8-5.
But this was not enough. The
Wildcats were too much for the
Card in the singles, winning four
of the six matches.
"The indoors was tough, and
this was a definite learning expe
rience for us," said freshman
Mike Bryan. "They definitely
exposed our weaknesses."

His brother, Bob, agreed,
pointing to the indoor play as dif
ficult for the young collegiate
players. "The courts were like
greased lightning," Bob Bryan
said.
While the Card lost to Ken
tucky, falling to the consolation
bracket of the tournament, there
were individual triumphs
nonetheless. Goldstein, current
ly ranked 17th in the nation, eas
ily ousted Kentucky junior
Ludde Sundin 6-1, 6-2. Sundin is
ranked fifth in the nation.
A bruised but resilient Cardi
nal moved into the consolation
bracket Friday where it faced No.
12 Louisiana State. Proving that
Stanford is still a great team
after a difficult loss, the Card
ousted LSU 6-1.
"They are a great team, and
we had to fight like crazy to win
that match," Gould said. Stan-
