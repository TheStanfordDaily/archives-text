# Men win thrilling Big Swim at Cal
## 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's swimming and
diving team defeated No. 4 California 125-118 Sat
urday at the Speiker Aquatic Complex in Berkeley.
With a win in its last dual meet of the season,
Stanford's dual-meet record rounds out at 8-1
heading into the postseason.
Unlike recent years' meets against Cal. this vic
tory was not a cake walk for the Cardinal who
actually trailed the Golden Bears by two points
going into the last event, the 400-yard freestyle
relay. That was when the Stanford squad of junior
Scott Claypool, sophomore Dod Wales, freshman
Glen Counts and junior Sabir Muhammad pulled
away to overcome Cal and secure the Stanford vic
tory. The team touched in 2:57.55, an extremely
fast time in which all four swimmers split under
45 S''COfi<!s for their 100-yard legs.
The Cardinal found itself down early after its
"A" 400 medley relay team was disqualified on an
illegal exchange between junior breaststroker
Tom Wilkens and sophomore butterflier Matt
Pierce.
The questionable call gave Cal a lead but
strengthened the resolve of the Stanford team,
which turned things around in the next event
when sophomore Matt O'Mara stroked to a
15:31.40 victory in the 1,650 freestyle. O'Mara
was seconded by senior Kevin Radvany, whose
15:55.34 was five seconds ahead of Cal's top fin
isher. Senior Jon Lischke was fourth in the event
in 16:00.05.
One of the more exciting swims of the meet
came in the 200 freestyle, featuring Cal's Danyon
Loader, a double-gold medalist for his native New
Zealand in last summer's Olympics. Stanford
sophomore Dod Wales and senior Scott Jones took
the race to the Olympian, with Wales leading early
and Jones closing fast at the end. At the finish.
Wales was barely touched out by Loader, 1:38.18
to 1:38.30, while Jones finished a close third in
1:39.12.
"I wanted to have a good swim and go I:3 s "
said Wales. "I wasn't really thinking about v.st
(Loader] was going to do before the race, but < ce
1 realized I was in a position to win after about 100
yards, I started focusing on beating him."
The momentum continued to roll for Stanford
in the next two events, as juniors Claypool and
Muhammad took first and second, respectively, in
the 50 freestyle, and classmate Wilkens won yet
another 200 individual medley for the Cardinal
Cal made up ground in the diving events, as the
Golden Bears took first and second on the one
meter board and first on the three-rreter Fresh
men Mark Michelin, who placed second on the
three-meter, and Andrew Harp
er, who placed third on the one
meter, dove well for the Cardinal
on their respective boards.
After Loader's exciting victory
in the 200 freestyle, Pierce pre
pared for his showdown with the
Kiwi in the 200 butterfly, an
event in which Loader won a sil
ver medal in the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics. Loader and teammate
Dominic Galic took the race out
fast, while Pierce swam just off
the pace for the first 150 yards.
But over the last 50, it was Pierce
who pulled even and then ahead
to upset the two Cal swimmers.
"I just wanted to execute my

race plan," Pierce said. "Cal has a
lot of talented swimmers, but I
knew that if I went out there and
put my best effort in the water, I
would win the race."
The elation of Pierce's victory
was quickly dampened as Cal
took the next two events — the
200 backstroke and the 500
freestyle — in which Loader
redeemed himself with a 4:30.53
victory over Radvany's 4:33.37.
After Wilkens swam to hi 3 sec
ond victory of the meet in the 200
breaststroke, the Cardinal had
pulled to within two points of Cal.
The medley relay won in fine fash
ion to secure the meet for Stan
ford, but this was the first time in
recent memory that Stanford has
trailed the Bears going into the
last event of the dual meet.
"We had a lot of confidence

going into that relay," Wales
said. "We knew that we needed to
win it in order to win the meet,
and Sabir and Claypool were
swimming well, so we were
ready."
Stanford's win over the much
improved Cal team was a great
way to end the dual-meet season.
The victory gave the Cardinal a
boost of confidence, while help
ing Stanford recognize that Cal
will have an impact on the NCAA
Championship meet even if its
Olympian cast could not over
come the talented and deep Stan
ford team.
Stanford will head to the Pac
-10 Championships in Long Beach
next week, where the team will
meet Cal again, as well as USC —
the only team to have beaten the
Cardinal this season.
