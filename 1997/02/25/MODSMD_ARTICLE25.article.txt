The top-ranked Stanford men's swimming and
diving team defeated No. 4 California 125-118 Sat
urday at the Speiker Aquatic Complex in Berkeley.
With a win in its last dual meet of the season,
Stanford's dual-meet record rounds out at 8-1
heading into the postseason.
Unlike recent years' meets against Cal. this vic
tory was not a cake walk for the Cardinal who
actually trailed the Golden Bears by two points
going into the last event, the 400-yard freestyle
relay. That was when the Stanford squad of junior
Scott Claypool, sophomore Dod Wales, freshman
Glen Counts and junior Sabir Muhammad pulled
away to overcome Cal and secure the Stanford vic
tory. The team touched in 2:57.55, an extremely
fast time in which all four swimmers split under
45 S''COfi<!s for their 100-yard legs.
The Cardinal found itself down early after its
"A" 400 medley relay team was disqualified on an
illegal exchange between junior breaststroker
Tom Wilkens and sophomore butterflier Matt
Pierce.
The questionable call gave Cal a lead but
strengthened the resolve of the Stanford team,
which turned things around in the next event
when sophomore Matt O'Mara stroked to a
15:31.40 victory in the 1,650 freestyle. O'Mara
was seconded by senior Kevin Radvany, whose
15:55.34 was five seconds ahead of Cal's top fin
isher. Senior Jon Lischke was fourth in the event
in 16:00.05.
One of the more exciting swims of the meet
came in the 200 freestyle, featuring Cal's Danyon
Loader, a double-gold medalist for his native New
Zealand in last summer's Olympics. Stanford
sophomore Dod Wales and senior Scott Jones took
the race to the Olympian, with Wales leading early
and Jones closing fast at the end. At the finish.
Wales was barely touched out by Loader, 1:38.18
to 1:38.30, while Jones finished a close third in
1:39.12.
"I wanted to have a good swim and go I:3 s "
said Wales. "I wasn't really thinking about v.st
(Loader] was going to do before the race, but < ce
1 realized I was in a position to win after about 100
yards, I started focusing on beating him."
The momentum continued to roll for Stanford
in the next two events, as juniors Claypool and
Muhammad took first and second, respectively, in
the 50 freestyle, and classmate Wilkens won yet
another 200 individual medley for the Cardinal
Cal made up ground in the diving events, as the
Golden Bears took first and second on the one
meter board and first on the three-rreter Fresh
men Mark Michelin, who placed second on the
