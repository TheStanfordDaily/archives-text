For the third straight time in
national team competition, the No.
2 Stanford women's tennis team
left the title match in defeat as top
ranked Florida celebrated victory.
The Gators (8-0) earned their
second consecutive title at the
Women's National Indoor Team
Tennis Championship by coming
from behind for a 4-3 win over the
Cardinal (11-1) at Sunday's cham
pionship match in Madison, Wis.
After losing the doubles point,
Stanford rebounded to take three
singles matches and a 3-1 advan
tage in the title round early in sin
gles play. However, the Gators
fought back to earn the final three
singles matches, all of them in
tight three-set battles.
The Gators obtained the all
important doubles point by win
ning at the No. 1 and No. 3 posi
tions. Junior Dawn Buth and
sophomore Stephanie Nickitas,

last year's NCAA doubles champi
ons, dueled Stanford's junior All-
American duo of Ania Bleszynski
and Julie Scott and won 8-6.
Freshman Anne Kremer and
senior Emily Burt also fell prey to
the Gators' Bonnie Bleeker and
Mary Carlisle White.
Senior Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Teryn Ashley outlasted
Amanda Basica and Traci Green in
a 9-8 tie-breaker in the No. 2
match.
Down 1-0, Stanford jumped all
over Florida early in singles com
petition. Scott avenged her doubles
loss by slamming Nickitas 6-1, 6-0
in the No. 5 match. In the No. 6
position, Ashley got the best of
Bleeker once again with a 6-3, 6-2
win.
Senior Sandra De Silva built on
the Cardinal advantage by earning
another win at the No. 2 singles
spot, defeating Basica in straight
sets 6-3, 6-4.
However, Florida came back by
going 3-0 in three-set matches.

After taking the first set, Kremer
dropped the No. 3 singles match to
White, who took the final two sets
for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 triumph.
In the No. 1 match, Schlukebir
and Buth battled in a rematch of
last season's No. 2 singles clash at
the NCAA tournament. Buth won
her second straight over Schluke
bir 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
Florida clinched the dual-match
and tournament win in the No. 4
match between Bleszynski and
Gator Divya Merchant. After los
ing the first set, Bleszynski (ought
back to earn a split with a second
set win. Merchant proved to be too
much, however, as she pulled out a
6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win to give the Gators
a 4-3 victory.
Despite losing its fourth
straight to the Gators, the Cardi
nal was not at full strength
throughout the tournament.
Noticeably absent from dual
match competition all season long
