## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
For the third straight time in
national team competition, the No.
2 Stanford women's tennis team
left the title match in defeat as top
ranked Florida celebrated victory.
The Gators (8-0) earned their
second consecutive title at the
Women's National Indoor Team
Tennis Championship by coming
from behind for a 4-3 win over the
Cardinal (11-1) at Sunday's cham
pionship match in Madison, Wis.
After losing the doubles point,
Stanford rebounded to take three
singles matches and a 3-1 advan
tage in the title round early in sin
gles play. However, the Gators
fought back to earn the final three
singles matches, all of them in
tight three-set battles.
The Gators obtained the all
important doubles point by win
ning at the No. 1 and No. 3 posi
tions. Junior Dawn Buth and
sophomore Stephanie Nickitas,

last year's NCAA doubles champi
ons, dueled Stanford's junior All-
American duo of Ania Bleszynski
and Julie Scott and won 8-6.
Freshman Anne Kremer and
senior Emily Burt also fell prey to
the Gators' Bonnie Bleeker and
Mary Carlisle White.
Senior Katie Schlukebir and
freshman Teryn Ashley outlasted
Amanda Basica and Traci Green in
a 9-8 tie-breaker in the No. 2
match.
Down 1-0, Stanford jumped all
over Florida early in singles com
petition. Scott avenged her doubles
loss by slamming Nickitas 6-1, 6-0
in the No. 5 match. In the No. 6
position, Ashley got the best of
Bleeker once again with a 6-3, 6-2
win.
Senior Sandra De Silva built on
the Cardinal advantage by earning
another win at the No. 2 singles
spot, defeating Basica in straight
sets 6-3, 6-4.
However, Florida came back by
going 3-0 in three-set matches.

After taking the first set, Kremer
dropped the No. 3 singles match to
White, who took the final two sets
for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 triumph.
In the No. 1 match, Schlukebir
and Buth battled in a rematch of
last season's No. 2 singles clash at
the NCAA tournament. Buth won
her second straight over Schluke
bir 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
Florida clinched the dual-match
and tournament win in the No. 4
match between Bleszynski and
Gator Divya Merchant. After los
ing the first set, Bleszynski (ought
back to earn a split with a second
set win. Merchant proved to be too
much, however, as she pulled out a
6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win to give the Gators
a 4-3 victory.
Despite losing its fourth
straight to the Gators, the Cardi
nal was not at full strength
throughout the tournament.
Noticeably absent from dual
match competition all season long
The Cardinal hopes to have
Osterloh back in the lineup in the
next few weeks.
With or without Osterloh, the
Cardinal and the Gators continued
to establish a growing rivalry
between the nation's top two
women's tennis programs. Barring
unforeseen upsets, Florida and
Stanford should earn the No. 1 and
No. 2 seeds, respectively, for the
NCAA tournament in May at
Stanford, and the next installment
of the rivalry will likely be in the
NCAA finals.
"There definitely is a rivalry
brewing," Schlukebir said. "I've
lost to them three times in a row.
The good thing is that NCAAs are
here with our crowd, and we'll
hopefully have Lilia in the lineup
somewhere and eveiyone will be
feeling better by then."
On their way to the finals, the
Stanford squad proved it deserves
its No. 2 national ranking by bull
dozing No. 3 Duke in the semifinals
5-1. The Cardinal won the doubles
point easily as Bleszynski and Scott
rolled to an 8-2 win, and Ashley and
Schlukebir cruised as well 8-3.
The Cardinal then won in the
No. 1, No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 sin
gles matches. Schlukebir earned a

the reigning USTA 18s champion,
freshman Lilia Osterloh. In addi
tion, Kremer and De Silva were
also nursing injuries.
"Knowing that we weren't 100
percent, we can take something
from playing them close," Schluke
bir said. "We know we can beat
them. We were that close. But still,
we are not happy losing to them
again, and we know we have a lot
to work on. But it's still over two
months away. Besides, I'd rather
lose at Indoors and win at NCAAs
than win Indoors and lose
NCAAs."
The outcome may have been
different with Osterloh, a mqjor
contributor in both doubles and
singles.
"It's hard to say since we don't
know where she would play,"
Schlukebir said. "I think we would
be better with Lilia in the lineup
because we would be stronger in
the middle, but Teiyn has been
playing so well for us at No. 6 that
it's tough to say."

three-set win over Karin Miller 6-
2, 2-6, 7-6. The Cardinal senior
avenged a loss to Miller in the
Rolex National Indoor final two
weeks ago. Stanford received
straight-set wins from Scott, Ash
ley and Kremer, who clinched the
win with a 6-1, 6-3 win over
Luanne Spadea.
Duke's lone point came in the
No. 2 match, where Wendy Fix
defeated De Silva 6-4,6-3. Bleszyn
ski's No. 4 match was suspended
after the Cardinal clinched the title
appearance.
In the first two rounds, Stan
ford did not drop a match, breezing
past No. 8 Pepperdine 7-0 and No.
21 Alabama 6-0.
"Going into this weekend was a
little scary with everyone banged
up," Schlukebir said. "I was confi
dent that we could play with the
top teams with what we had but
still a little unsure because of the
injuries.
"But winning easily in the early
rounds built our confidence a lot
and crushing Duke let us know
that even with the injuries, we
were fine. We had a great three
days, and we were close to beating
Florida without running full
strength."

bir said. "We know we can beat
them. We were that close. But still,
we are not happy losing to them
again, and we know we have a lot
to work on. But it's still over two
months away. Besides, I'd rather
lose at Indoors and win at NCAAs
than win Indoors and lose
NCAAs."
The outcome may have been
different with Osterloh, a mqjor

"It's hard to say since we don't
know where she would play,"
Schlukebir said. "I think we would

playing so well for us at No. 6 that
it's tough to say."

ford did not drop a match, breezing

"Going into this weekend was a
little scary with everyone banged
up," Schlukebir said. "I was confi
dent that we could play with the
top teams with what we had but
still a little unsure because of the
injuries.
"But winning easily in the early
rounds built our confidence a lot
and crushing Duke let us know
that even with the injuries, we
were fine. We had a great three
days, and we were close to beating
Florida without running full
strength."
