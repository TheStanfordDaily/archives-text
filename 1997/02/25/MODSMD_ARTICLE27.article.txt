# They are the champions
## Hockey wins Pac-8 title 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
By winning both its matches
in Anaheim last weekend, the
Stanford ice hockey team
clinched the Pacific 8 Conference
title and gained confidence for
next week's national tourna
ment.
The Pac-8 Championship was
held at the Disney Ice Rink, next
to Disneyland, but the Cardinal
didn't see much of Mickey
Mouse. Stanford was too busy
defeating USC 4-1 Saturday, and
Oregon 3-1 in the championship
match Sunday.
Stanford's record against
USC improved to 4-0 on the year
with Saturday's win.
"USC didn't play as well as
they could have," said freshman
forward Phil Enan. "We didn't
play extremely well either, but
they weren't a very good team
that day."
Sunday's match was a much
closer contest. Stanford had a 2-0
lead for most of the game, but
Oregon scored with three min
utes left to make it 2-1. With a
minute left, Cardinal sophomore
forward Tom Terbell scored in an
open net to clinch the win for
Stanford.
"It was kind of nerve-wrack
ing," said junior goalie Sami Jo
Small. "We were expecting to
win, but the pressure was still
on."
Junior forward Eri Crum was
instrumental in the wins, filling
in the first line and sparking a
coordinated team effort.
"Eri played really well," Small
said. "The other guys clicked
around him, and the team really

seemed to come together."
Another noteworthy perfor
mance was turned in by junior
forward Evan Asano, who was
voted MVP of the tournament.
With the Pac-8 Championship
under its belt, the Card extended
its winning streak to nine games.
They're hoping to carry that
momentum into Nationals.
"We've done as well as we
could up to this point," Enan
said.
"The season hasn't been as
challenging as it could have
been," Small said. This puts
Stanford at a disadvantage
against teams from stronger
divisions, like the Northeast
schools.
"We're assuming the Eastern
teams are really good, but we
definitely have guys who could
play back east. So we will just
have to step it up and play our
best."
Nationals will be held at
Washington University in St.
Louis, starting March 5. Stan
ford's first opponent will be Rut
gers, a team that was ranked
first in the Northeast Division.
Stanford enters the tournament
ranked third in the Western
Division.
Stanford is hoping to improve
on its results from two years ago,
when the team came in third at
Nationals. This year, though,
with the competition expanded
to include 16 teams instead of
eight, the Card will have an even
tougher challenge, and the Scar
let Knights are a grueling first
round test.
But Stanford appears ready
for it. As Small said, "We have no
excuses now — this is it."
