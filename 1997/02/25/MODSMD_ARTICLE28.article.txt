# Baseball makes trek to capital in final tuneup

With a tough series against league rival
No. 3 USC on the weekend horizon, today's
matchup with Sacramento State at Hornet
Field gives the Cardinal one last chance to
get its act together after dropping two of
three to UC-Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal will try to rebound from last
weekend's disappointing series with the
Gauchos, when inconsistent offensive pro
duction and starting pitching led to two loss
es. After dropping Friday night's battle 6-4
and falling 10-8 Saturday, the Card was able
to fight back from a 7-2 deficit Sunday to
win 12-7 and prevent a sweep.
With league play opening in three days
and the formidable USC Trojans coming up
from the Southland to challenge the Cardi
nal at Sunken Diamond, last weekend's play
is no source of confidence.
"I'm just glad we won the last game," said
freshman designated hitter John Gall. "We
need some momentum going into the USC
series."
"All these series are important," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "But this one is
especially so — USC is a real tough league
opponent, and we want to go into the games
strong."
The game at Sacramento State will give
the Cardinal nine innings for last-second
tuneups.
Sacramento State (5-10) is coming off a
tough series against Cal State-Northridge,
where the team dropped all three games by a
combined score of 43-15.
In its first season as a member of the Big
West Conference (the Hornets were booted
from the Western Athletic Conference when
it expanded last year), pitching has been
spotty for the team, with no obvious ace
emerging. Its inconsistency has led to a
bloated team ERA of 7.58.
Offensively, Sacramento State is more
defined. The squad is led by shortstop Har
vey Hargrove, a junior, who has a .404 bat
ting average and nine home runs. He's
joined by four-year starter Jason Quintell,
who's batting .344 with three homers.

Together, the two make up the bulk of the
Hornets' offensive attack.
Sacramento State will be facing a relative
ly healthy Cardinal team. Stanford has lost
only one starter to injury, sophomore second
baseman Tony Schrager. Against Nevada on
Feb. 11, Schrager came up limping after
running to first base and is listed as day to
day.

To accommodate the vacancy at second
base, Marquess moved junior right fielder
Joe Kilburg to second and pulled freshman
Edmund Muth from the bench to take over
for Kilburg in right.
"The replacements have worked out; it's
been a positive thing," Marquess said. "Kil
burg has played second well and so has
Muth."
