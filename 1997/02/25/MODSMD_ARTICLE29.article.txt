### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team chalked up another
victory with an all-out win over
the UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos
on Saturday.
The Cardinal squad, which
defeated the Gauchos by more
than seven points earlier this
season, was looking at the meet
mostly as an opportunity to rest
up its all-around gymnasts as
well as a chance for the other
members to build experience,
said head coach Lisa Izzi.
Although scoring big was not
a priority for the Stanford squad,
it marked a team total of 193.15
points to Santa Barbara's 190.1
points. Freshman Larissa
Fontaine said the Friday meet
was one of the Gauchos' best.
"I think they reached their
season high [over the] weekend,"
Fontaine said.
Star all-around gymnast
Fontaine sat out the meet for the
first time this season, while co
captains junior Keri Monahan
and sophomore Amy Murakami
refrained from competing in the
beam and floor events respec
tively.
Murakami, who has competed
on all four events throughout
the season, said that being able
to sit out the burdensome floor
exercise helped alleviate the con
tinuous pressure on her back
and ankle injuries.
Sophomore Tracey Kohl, who
stepped up to compete as the all
around gymnast, took the event
title with a total of 38.825
points.
Freshman Sarah Harding
made her debut on the floor,
pleasing the crowd and judges
with a brave, fresh and energetic
routine. Younger members of the
Card made full use of the oppor
tunity to expose themselves to
several events. Freshman Ann
Thananopavarn proved her abili
ty to play a cardinal role as a

member of the Stanford squad
with skilled routines on the
vault, bars and floor.
Freshman Tara LaMorte par
ticipated on the bars, beam and
floor exercise, scoring a high of
9.65 on the floor.
The Stanford gymnasts
agreed that the meet was a big
break for all members of the Car
dinal squad.
"It was really good for the
team," Murakami said. She
added that the younger gym
nasts' enthusiasm and excite
ment boosted the team's energy

level and overall performance.
"When someone looks that
excited, it's hard for other people
not to feed off it," Murakami
said.
Junior Christie Jones said the
Santa Barbara meet elevated
team drive for the upcoming
NCAA Regionals next month.
"It worked out really well,"
Jones said. "We wanted to give
[the all-arounders] a rest, and
other [members of the squad]
totally stepped up to the chal
lenge; it was a great overall team
effort."
