# Congressman lauds free trade
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
An Arizona congressman and
Stanford alumnus explained the
virtues of free trade yesterday af
ternoon to about 50 people in
Tresidder Union.
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who re
ceived his MBA from Stanford in
1967, spoke on "America's Role in
the World Economy," focusing on
the necessity of free trade agree
ments, particularly between the
United States and Latin America.
Kolbe discussed his experiences
helping the North American Free
Trade Agreement through Con
gress.
Defending the 1993 treaty,
Kolbe said that while it is too early
to call NAFTA a success, it "is
working the way we want it to."
The volume of trade between

the United States and Mexico has
quadrupled in the last 10 years and
continues to increase, he said.
He addressed a few criticisms of
NAFTA, including that it was re
sponsible for the subsequent finan
cial crisis that led Mexico to deval
ue its currency.
Calling the crisis "only in the
most remote peripheral sense
NAFTA-related," he attributed it
instead to Mexico's over-reliance
on foreign capital and its failure to
let the peso's value fluctuate with
the markets before the crash.
When questioned, he defended
the large loans the United States
made to help Mexico relieve the cri
sis.
"I don't think very many people
know how close we came to a com
plete meltdown in world currency
