# Congressman lauds free trade
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
An Arizona congressman and
Stanford alumnus explained the
virtues of free trade yesterday af
ternoon to about 50 people in
Tresidder Union.
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who re
ceived his MBA from Stanford in
1967, spoke on "America's Role in
the World Economy," focusing on
the necessity of free trade agree
ments, particularly between the
United States and Latin America.
Kolbe discussed his experiences
helping the North American Free
Trade Agreement through Con
gress.
Defending the 1993 treaty,
Kolbe said that while it is too early
to call NAFTA a success, it "is
working the way we want it to."
The volume of trade between

the United States and Mexico has
quadrupled in the last 10 years and
continues to increase, he said.
He addressed a few criticisms of
NAFTA, including that it was re
sponsible for the subsequent finan
cial crisis that led Mexico to deval
ue its currency.
Calling the crisis "only in the
most remote peripheral sense
NAFTA-related," he attributed it
instead to Mexico's over-reliance
on foreign capital and its failure to
let the peso's value fluctuate with
the markets before the crash.
When questioned, he defended
the large loans the United States
made to help Mexico relieve the cri
sis.
"I don't think very many people
know how close we came to a com
plete meltdown in world currency
markets," Kolbe said, calling U.S.
intervention "absolutely neces
sary." He noted that Mexico has
since refinanced the debt and paid
the United States more than $600
million in interest.
Regarding claims that NAFTA
has caused a loss of U.S. jobs to
Mexico, Kolbe said the public
might misperceive the issue be
cause large plant reallocations re
ceive more news coverage than the
more numerous but smaller job
expansions caused by the growth
of U.S. exports to Mexico.
In addition to creating jobs,
Kolbe said, open markets improve
the quality of life for all con
cerned.
"If you can buy an imported car
for $3,000 less, that's the same as
a $3,000 pay raise," Kolbe said.
A critical next step from

NAFTA, Kolbe said, is a wider
agreement encompassing the en
tire American continent. He said
that an easy start on this would
be admitting Chile into NAFTA.
Kolbe estimated that if negoti
ations began today, an agreement
with Chile could be reached in
two months. He said, however,
that U.S. politics are preventing
this.
He explained that trade agree
ments have for the last 25 years
gone through Congress on a "fast
track" basis. This means that
Congress is consulted by the pres
ident during the negotiation of a
treaty but is not allowed to amend
the final version once it is present
ed.
While defending the current
mechanism, Kolbe criticized Pres
ident Clinton for trying to extend
his powers so he could include in a
fast-track treaty "extraneous"
provisions on labor and environ
mental issues.
Kolbe said Congress should not

be prevented from amending
treaties that could require changes
in domestic U.S. labor or environ
mental legislation.
This dispute, Kolbe said, con
tinues to block any broadening of
free trade in the Americas. He said
he hopes for progress soon and
cautioned that the United States is
losing much by its failure to settle
the impasse.
"Meanwhile, as we dilly-dally
on this issue, the rest of the world
is not sitting still," Kolbe said.
He noted that trading blocs are
emerging in East Asia and South
America and noted that they often
have a "regionalist" bias, imposing
high tariffs against everyone out
side the bloc.
Kolbe criticized this trend, say
ing, "These kind of regional agree
ments only propel us toward a
global trading system if they are
open."
