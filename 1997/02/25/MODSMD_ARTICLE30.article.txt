### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
Reno, the site for many past
accomplishments by the Stan
ford track and field squad, was
the place of yet another win Sat
urday. This time, however, not
only were there outstanding
individual performances but also
an excellent team effort from
both the men's and women's
sides.
The women won the meet in
Nevada with a score of 103, while
the men took second with 86
points.
The 1997 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor meet
featured entirely Western and
primarily Pacific 10 Conference
schools such as Washington,
Washington State, Arizona, Ore
gon and California.
The Cardinal women captured
the team title, easily besting Ari
zona, who came in second at 90.5.
The women's distance medley
relay team also took first place
with an NCAA provisional quali
fying time of 11 minutes, 41.94
seconds. In the individual perfor
mances, sophomore heptathelete
Tracye Lawyer qualified provi
sionally for the NCAA Champi
onships and placed first in the
high jump with a jump of 5 feet,
11 1/2 inches. Lawyer topped
that off by coming in second in
the 55-meter hurdles with a time
of 8.02 seconds.

Then, in the mile, senior dis
tance runner Monal Chokshi
placed first, set an indoor person
al record and qualified provision
ally with a time of 4:51.15.
"I was really happy about the
way I ran," Chokshi said. "It was
funny because it wasn't a typical
race for me; usually I run in the
middle of the pack and then kick
in at the end, but this time I was
running in the lead all the way."
Senior Tyra Holt continued
the great day for the Cardinal
women by winning the pole vault
with a leap of 12-0 1/2. Not only
did Holt win the vault, but she
also set a new school record.
Vaulting coach Casey Roache
said this jump "established her as
a bona fide contender to make
the World Championship team."
"It was really great and a long
time coming, especially since I
had a lot of trouble breaking that
12-foot barrier," Holt said.
To cap it off, freshman Cassie
Romuld and junior Katrinka
Jackson placed first and second
in the shot put with throws of 47-
0 and 46-8 1/2 respectively.
The Cardinal women weren't
the only group that came off sat
isfied; the men's squad also had a
strong showing by coming in sec
ond with a score of 86 to Idaho's
106.5.
Like the women's team, the
men's distance medley relay
squad had a strong finish. The
team came in second place to

Washington State with a time of
9:51.24.
Then to continue the Cardi
nal's success in the pole vault,
freshman Toby Stevenson handi
ly beat out Jussi Autio of Ari
zona, with a leap of 17-8 1/2 to
capture first place in the pole
vault and to set a Stanford indoor
school record, which previously
stood at 17-8.
The field day for the Stanford
men continued as senior Jimmie
Johnson won the 200-meter title
while qualifying provisionally for
the NCAA's and setting a person
al record with a time of 21.17.
"The first 100 was really good,
but then fatigue set in and I kind
of slowed down in the last 100,"
Johnson said. "This was my
fourth race in two days, and I also
hadn't been sleeping too well."
Then, to round off the day,
sophomore Brad Hauser and
junior Nathan Nutter placed 1-2
in the 5,000 meters with times of
14:31.68 and 14:35.93 and quali
fied provisionally for the NCAAs.
Hauser also placed third in the
3,000 meters and qualified provi
sionally with a run of 8:21.73.
According to some, the strong
performance in Saturday's meet
can be attributed to the team's
growing process.
"We had a good showing from
everyone at this meet," Chokshi
said. "We have a few meets under
our belt, and now we're starting
to roll."
