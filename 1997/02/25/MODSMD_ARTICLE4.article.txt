# SEAS petitions against U of A building plans
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
While U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe's main intention
on campus yesterday was to discuss free trade,
some student activists confronted him with a dif
ferent agenda.
Four members of Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford distributed leaflets and
collected signatures for a petition calling on the
Republican congressman to withdraw his sup
port for the University of Arizona's building
plans on Mount Graham.
The university building a series of tele
scopes on the mountain in southern Arizona, and
the leaflet charges that this is
causing environmental damage
and desecrating land sacred to the
San Carlos Apaches.
Senior David Soergel, co-coor
dinator of SEAS, called the site
"an extremely biodiverse, unique
ecosystem." He said that several
species are found only in that
area, most notably the Mount
Graham red squirrel.

Soergel added that the issue
was a longtime concern of
SEAS, both because Kolbe is a
Stanford alumnus and because
of "the fact that it's a university
that's the 'aggressor,' so to
speak."
SEAS members visited the site
several times in 1995, Soergel
said.
During the question-and-an
swer period that followed Kolbe's
speech, a SEAS member present
ed him with the petition, which
Soergel said contained 150 signa
tures. He added that SEAS began

soliciting signatures only on Sun
day night
Kolbe accepted the petition but
said it was unlikely he would
change his views, given that the
telescope project was already
nearing completion.
"The environmental consider
ations that have been given [to
the telescope project] have been
really extraordinary," Kolbe
said, adding that the red squirrel
population is at an all-time high
and that the fire protection
which came with the project may
have helped local wildlife.
