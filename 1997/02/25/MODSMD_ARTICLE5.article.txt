## Talisman to compete for a cappella national championship 
### Scott Peterson 
Talisman a cappella will compete for college
a cappella's national championship in April
following its victory last Friday in the Western
Division semifinal round at Brigham Young
University.
The group will face five other collegiate
singing groups at New York's Carnegie Hall on
April 26.
"It was an incredible experience competing
at the semifinals because all of the groups were
very different and very good," said freshman
Lanita Morgan. "We had no idea throughout
the whole competition of who would win. It

was pretty tight, and we were just hoping and
praying."
Talisman advanced to the semifinals after a
recent regional competition held at Stanford.
Both Talisman and the Fleet Street Singers
were selected as semifinalists after this con
test, which included other Stanford groups as
well as singers from UC-Berkeley and USC.
Competing against Talisman in the semifi
nals were Fleet Street and groups from BYU
and the University of Northern Colorado.
"We used the same songs in the semifinals
as we did here," said sophomore Lisa Anfield,
a soprano and the group's manager. "We also
tried to develop more performance aspects —

different arch forms and choreography."
Groups were judged on four criteria: musi
cality, originality, presentation and soloists.
Freshman Paolo Resmini said the group's
uniqueness helped spur its victory. "The
judges did a lot of their judging on originality,"
he said. "I think that category helped in the
fact that we're the only group that sings
African-American music as an a cappella
group."
Members said the group is working to pol
ish its presentation for the national competi
tion. "We're very lively and energetic on
stage," Morgan said, "but some
times the audience does like to see
a little bit of choreography."
The national championship
will be a "fun, new experience" for
Talisman, Anfield said. "Just the
experience of singing at Carnegie
Hall will be amazing," she added.
"It will be interesting to hear
other groups and fun to sing for a
big crowd."
Resmini is optimistic about
what will be Talisman's first ap
pearance at the championship. "I
think we have just as good a
chance as anybody else if not bet
ter because we're different from
everybody else," he said. "At that
level everybody's really good, and
it's a matter of who the judges like
best."
Resmini also suggested Talis
man's show in New York could
promote interest in the group's
musical style. "I think the nation
al competition will help us in pub

licizing our type of music," he
said. "It's a good opportunity."
Talisman last summer publi
cized its music to the internation
al community, singing at the At
lanta Olympic Games in July.
Group members spend 6 to
seven hours rehearsing every
week in addition to performances,
Anfield said, and their closeness is
reflected in their stage appear
ances.
"When you see the group on
stage you can see the love between
the members — it doesn't look
like music is the only thing be
tween them," Resmini explained.
"It's kind of like a family. My sec
ond family is Talisman."
Members agreed that Talis
man's strong point is, in Anfield's
words, its "group sound and ener
gy." Morgan suggested that this
may be aided by the spiritual
themes of many of the group's
songs.
"Our music is definitely like a
gift and people in the group real
ize that we're giving a gift to our
audience," Morgan said. "That's
what we're about."
