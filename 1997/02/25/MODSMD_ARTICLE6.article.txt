Undergraduate conductors take the
podium tonight at "My Spirit Sang All
Day: Choral Music from the English Tra
dition." The program draws from the
rich traditior of English choral music
and is put on jointly by the Stanford
Chamber Chorale and the University
Singers.
However, Director of Choral Studies
Stephen Sano will not be the only one to
conduct the ensembles. Seniors Akiko
Fujimoto and Kathleen Gregory will
each direct several pieces in the perfor
mance, an opportunity seldom available
to undergraduate conductors.
The path to the podium was not a

straight line for either woman.
"I thought I wanted to be a child psy
chologist," Fujimoto said. "I took all the
classes, did research at Bing Nursery
School — the whole shebang. But I real
ized then that psychology wasn't what I
wanted to pursue."
Although Fujimoto will graduate with
a double major in psychology and music,
music is her first commitment.
How did Fujimoto go from child psy
chology to conducting as her career goal?
"Well, it took me a long time to com
mit myself mentally to music," Fujimoto
replied. "A lot of encouragement came
from my teacher, Stephen Sano. He's
been very generous about giving aspiring
student conductors opportunities."
Indeed, Sano has commented on the

Music Department's commitment to un
dergraduate conductors, emphasizing
the unusual nature of undergraduate
conductors working with official Univer
sity ensembles.
Like Fujimoto, Gregory came to Stan
ford without intending to be a music
m^jor.
"Engineering was the reason I came
to Stanford," Gregory said. "Freshman
year, I was taking a lot of physics and cal
culus and ended up really disliking it."
Gregory added, "I went through an
early mid-life crisis, I guess, thinking 'If
I don't ei\joy what I'm doing now, how
can I commit to it for the rest of my life?'
At the same time, I was finding a lot of

talented people in the Music De
partment, which I wouldn't have
expected at Stanford."
Gregory, a double major in
music and history, was also pleas
antly surprised by the History De
partment.
"I'd come here thinking that
Stanford's strengths were in the
sciences," Gregory said. "But all
my professors in history and in
music have been excellent — very
committed to teaching as well as
brilliant individuals."
Both women began their musi
cal careers playing the piano. Fuji
moto took up the instrument at
age 5, picked up the trombone in
fourth grade, and started singing
the next year.
Freshman year, Fujimoto
joined the Chamber Chorale. "I
tried to continue playing the trom
bone, too, and actually played in
the jazz band for a quarter but had
to give it up when it conflicted with
Chorale."
Gregory also began with the
piano. In high school, she became
more serious about singing and
then joined the Chorale when she
came to Stanford.
"I found some incredible men
tors in the form of Steve Sano and
Greg Waits," Gregory said.
Tonight, Gregory will be lead
ing the Stanford Chamber
Chorale in Benjamin Britten's
"Five Flower Songs" as part of her
senior concentration project in
choral conducting. In the past,
Gregory has also conducted the
Stanford University Singers.
Fujimoto, assistant director of
University Singers, will be leading

the ensemble tonight in Stan
ford's Beati quorum via and Thi
man's "Go, Lovely Rose."
"It's an incredible honor to
stand on a podium and conduct
any musician," Fujimoto said. "I
hope someday I'll become a con
ductor that's worthy of having
such a responsibility."
Asked about the semantics of
conducting, Fujimoto replied:
"There definitely is a 'conductors'
language' to work from. But a lot
of conducting is internalizing the
music, for your job is to communi
cate the music through gestures.
If you don't have it in you, it won't
come through your body to the
singers."
Sometimes, conducting on a
podium can be isolating.
"There are times when it seems
like a lone battle — learning how
to conduct isn't like doing a prob
lem set with friends," Fujimoto
said. "But a conductor can't pro
duce music on her own: I need mu
sicians to conduct. I'm really there
to ensure that the composer's in
tent is expressed in the most musi
cal manner possible."
To understand what the com
poser meant, Fujimoto first reads
about the composer, learning
about the period to which he or she
belongs.
"The era that they're from tells
me a lot about what style I should
perform in," she said.
Fujimoto then goes through
the piece and, in the case of choral
music, looks at the text as well.
"Part of being a conductor is
teaching the phonetics of the
piece, which is often in Latin or
German," Fujimoto said. "Then I
find out how the chords are mov
ing and changing, looking at who's
saying what and what role the
music plays."

Gregory goes through a simi
larly painstaking process. "The
music I'm performing [tonight] is
fairly difficult. I start with an
analysis of the work, the harmon
ics and so forth. After that, I turn
to recordings of what other people
have, to hear what I hate and what
I love — I can always get some
good ideas that way.
Apart from textual study, Gre
gory finds it most helpful to prac
tice on the podium.
"The best understanding of a
piece comes when I'm learning on
the fly, standing in front of a group
and realizing that what seemed ex
plicit in the mirror has become
muddled in practice," Gregory
said.
After she graduates, Gregory
plans to take a year off and teach
music and history at a private
school in the area. After that, she
is considering law school or gradu
ate school in music.
"I've worked in a law firm in the
past, so I know what to expect
from that profession. I'm less cer
tain of what teaching will entail,
which is why I hope to work with a
choir," Gregory said. "Ultimately,
I think I'd like to teach at the col
lege level since it combines teach
ing and conducting."
Fujimoto plans to pursue con
ducting as a career.
"Right now, I'm applying to
graduate school programs in con
ducting. After that, well, if you're
not picky there's definitely a mar
ket out there for conductors," Fu
jimoto said. "Whenever there's
more than a certain number of
musicians playing, they need
someone to make decisions about
the piece."
The concert, "My Spirit Sang
All Day," will be performed
tonight at 8 in Memorial Church.

Sometimes, conducting on a
podium can be isolating.
"There are times when it seems
like a lone battle — learning how
to conduct isn't like doing a prob
lem set with friends," Fujimoto
said. "But a conductor can't pro
duce music on her own: I need mu
sicians to conduct. I'm really there
to ensure that the composer's in
tent is expressed in the most musi
cal manner possible."
To understand what the com
poser meant, Fujimoto first reads
about the composer, learning
about the period to which he or she
belongs.
"The era that they're from tells
me a lot about what style I should
perform in," she said.
Fujimoto then goes through
the piece and, in the case of choral
music, looks at the text as well.
"Part of being a conductor is
teaching the phonetics of the
piece, which is often in Latin or
German," Fujimoto said. "Then I
find out how the chords are mov
ing and changing, looking at who's
saying what and what role the
music plays."

Gregory goes through a simi
larly painstaking process. "The
music I'm performing [tonight] is
fairly difficult. I start with an
analysis of the work, the harmon
ics and so forth. After that, I turn
to recordings of what other people
have, to hear what I hate and what
I love — I can always get some
good ideas that way.
Apart from textual study, Gre
gory finds it most helpful to prac
tice on the podium.
"The best understanding of a
piece comes when I'm learning on
the fly, standing in front of a group
and realizing that what seemed ex
plicit in the mirror has become
muddled in practice," Gregory
said.
After she graduates, Gregory
plans to take a year off and teach
music and history at a private
school in the area. After that, she
is considering law school or gradu
ate school in music.
"I've worked in a law firm in the
past, so I know what to expect
from that profession. I'm less cer
tain of what teaching will entail,
which is why I hope to work with a
choir," Gregory said. "Ultimately,
I think I'd like to teach at the col
lege level since it combines teach
ing and conducting."
Fujimoto plans to pursue con
ducting as a career.
"Right now, I'm applying to
graduate school programs in con
ducting. After that, well, if you're
not picky there's definitely a mar
ket out there for conductors," Fu
jimoto said. "Whenever there's
more than a certain number of
musicians playing, they need
someone to make decisions about
the piece."
The concert, "My Spirit Sang
All Day," will be performed
tonight at 8 in Memorial Church.
