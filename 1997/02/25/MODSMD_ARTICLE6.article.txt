Undergraduate conductors take the
podium tonight at "My Spirit Sang All
Day: Choral Music from the English Tra
dition." The program draws from the
rich traditior of English choral music
and is put on jointly by the Stanford
Chamber Chorale and the University
Singers.
However, Director of Choral Studies
Stephen Sano will not be the only one to
conduct the ensembles. Seniors Akiko
Fujimoto and Kathleen Gregory will
each direct several pieces in the perfor

to undergraduate conductors.
The path to the podium was not a

"Engineering was the reason I came
to Stanford," Gregory said. "Freshman
year, I was taking a lot of physics and cal

Gregory added, "I went through an
early mid-life crisis, I guess, thinking 'If
I don't ei\joy what I'm doing now, how
can I commit to it for the rest of my life?'
