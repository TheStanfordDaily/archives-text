# New CPPC chief a 'resume builder'
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Bob Thirsk only became the
new director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center on
Jan. 2, but 30 years of experi
ence in higher education and a
love of academia has given him
ample preparation to achieve
his goal — providing the best
possible career resources for
Stanford students.
"Our organization exists for
students. My No. 1 priority is to
make sure that we never forget
that," Thirsk said. "Every stu
dent will be treated profession
ally and with accuracy."
A self-admitted "West-Coast
person," Thirsk left his position
at the University of North Car
olina-Greensboro, where he
served as director of career ser
vices for three years, to come to
Stanford. He replaced former
CPPC director Ruth Schneider,
who recently retired.
Schneider "was a highly re
spected person in the field — na
tionally, regionally and at Stan
ford," Thirsk said. "I'm follow
ing in some very big shoes."
Thirsk, who holds a master's
in school administration and a
doctorate in educational leader
ship, and associate director of
career services for nine years at
Western Washington Universi
ty, his alma mater, and director
of career services at the Univer
sity of Washington for almost 8
years.
Thirsk also served as acting

dean of stu
dents at West
ern Washing
ton and taught
graduate stu
dents at West
ern Washing
ton and North
Carolina. He is
a member of
Western Asso
ciation of Col-

leges and Employers and the
National Association of Colleges
and Employers.
According to Thirsk. his in
volvement in career planning
began as a result of his interest
in working with college stu
dents. "There is nothing more
stimulating than a University
campus," Thirsk said.
Thirsk enjoys career plan
ning in particular because it re
quires work with both employ
ers as well as faculty and stu
dents, offering a "balanced per
spective" of University and non-
University life.
As CPPC Director, Thirsk is
responsible for coordinating
CPPC activities, managing the
budget, overseeing research on
hiring and translating antici
pated needs of the job market to
students.
According to Thirsk, the pri
mary change impacting the
way career planning services
are run is the growth of tech
nology, and the Internet in par
ticular. Thirsk said it is the


Thirsk
CPPC's job to ensure that infor
mation presented is constantly
up to date.
"Our responsibility is to make
sure that students get this infor
mation as easily as possible,"
Thirsk said.
CPPC services include on-cam
pus recruiting, career fairs, an in
ternship database and "quality
counseling" on resume-writing
and career and major choices,
Thirsk explained.
Thirsk has found that Stan
ford students are "more highly
motivated and focused" and "aca
demically better" than some of
their college brethren.
However, one of Thirsk's con
cerns is that students are under a
lot of external and self-imposed
pressure, and they may miss ca
reer opportunities that offer the
most happiness.
"Stanford students are so high
ly motivated to pursue corporate

jobs that they overlook the public
sector," Thirsk said. "Non profits
can be wonderful opportunities
for Stanford students."
The CPPC tries to maintain a
balance between corporations and
nonprofit organizations by at
tempting to bring as many non
profits to campus as possible and
holding public service fairs.
Thirsk acknowledged that this is
difficult because many nonprofits
do not recruit as actively.
Thirsk also hopes that stu
dents will use the resources avail
able to them at the CPPC and not
be intimidated by the job- or in
ternship- hunting process.
"We're so friendly," Thirsk
said. "The CPPC offers lots of
ways to reduce stress, pressure
and intimidation."
Thirsk also dismissed the
"common misunderstanding"
that CPPC services are primarily
for engineering or economics stu
dents. Although business and en
gineering corporations are prima
ry recruiters on campus, coun
selors are available to help stu
dents find jobs in any field.
