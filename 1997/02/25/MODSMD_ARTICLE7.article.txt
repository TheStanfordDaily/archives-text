### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Bob Thirsk only became the
new director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center on
Jan. 2, but 30 years of experi
ence in higher education and a
love of academia has given him
ample preparation to achieve
his goal — providing the best
possible career resources for
Stanford students.
"Our organization exists for
students. My No. 1 priority is to
make sure that we never forget
that," Thirsk said. "Every stu
dent will be treated profession
ally and with accuracy."
A self-admitted "West-Coast
person," Thirsk left his position
at the University of North Car
olina-Greensboro, where he
served as director of career ser
vices for three years, to come to
Stanford. He replaced former
CPPC director Ruth Schneider,
who recently retired.
Schneider "was a highly re
spected person in the field — na
tionally, regionally and at Stan
ford," Thirsk said. "I'm follow
ing in some very big shoes."
Thirsk, who holds a master's
in school administration and a
doctorate in educational leader
ship, and associate director of
career services for nine years at
Western Washington Universi
ty, his alma mater, and director
of career services at the Univer
sity of Washington for almost 8
years.
Thirsk also served as acting

dean of stu
dents at West
ern Washing
ton and taught
graduate stu
dents at West
ern Washing
ton and North
Carolina. He is
a member of
Western Asso
ciation of Col-

leges and Employers and the
National Association of Colleges
and Employers.
According to Thirsk. his in
volvement in career planning
began as a result of his interest
in working with college stu
dents. "There is nothing more
stimulating than a University
campus," Thirsk said.
Thirsk enjoys career plan
ning in particular because it re
quires work with both employ
ers as well as faculty and stu
dents, offering a "balanced per
spective" of University and non-
University life.
As CPPC Director, Thirsk is
responsible for coordinating
CPPC activities, managing the
budget, overseeing research on
hiring and translating antici
pated needs of the job market to
students.
According to Thirsk, the pri
mary change impacting the
way career planning services
are run is the growth of tech
nology, and the Internet in par
ticular. Thirsk said it is the
