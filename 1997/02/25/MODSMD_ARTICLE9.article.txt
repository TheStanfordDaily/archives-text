FOR THE RECORD...
Jesse Oxfeld's Feb. 11 column on federal regulations regarding
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program misstated the per
centage of Stanford's revenues coming from the Department of De
fense. In fact, only 3.5 percent of the University's income comes
from the Defense Department, not 35 percent.
An article in Friday's Daily incorrectly stated that the men's
gymnastics team would have a meet that evening. In fact, the meet
was held Saturday.
