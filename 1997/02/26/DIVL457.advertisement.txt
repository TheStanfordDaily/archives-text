What is the Research Round Table?
It is a series of round table discussions between
seniors doing independent women-related research
and younger students interested in doing their own
research. Discussions will cover everything from
how to choose an advisor to managing time to
what research means to you.
The Round Table is a chance for seniors to share
the joys, discoveries, frustrations, and wisdom of
their research process with younger students. It's
also a chance to ask specific questions and get
and give advice. We want todemvstify the process
and inspire all students to engage in their own
research.
Round table discussions will be facilitated by a
faculty member or graduate student familiar
with women-related research
Anyone interested in research is welcome to
participate! Come to the kickoff reception this
Thursday.
First round table discussion:
Thursday, March 6 at 7pm
