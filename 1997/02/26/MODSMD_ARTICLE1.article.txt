# Casper asks ASSU to act responsibly
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Last night, a drawn-out and chaotic ASSU senate
meeting — which began with University President
Gerhard Casper's quarterly address — ended abrupt
lywhen Senate Chair Don Aingworth walked out.
In order to prevent a vote on a bill to redistrict
graduate senate seats, Aingworth left the meeting at
11:20 p.m., more than four hours after it began. His
departure broke quorum, and the senate was forced
to recess.
Casper began the meeting on a far different note,
making his quarterly appearance in front of the sen
ate. During a question-and-answer forum, he gave
the senate a short lecture in operations.
In particular, Casper emphasized the senate's re
sponsibility to keep its internal affairs in order. Re
sponding to ASSU President Bill Shen's question of
how Casper would act if he were the president of the
association, Casper said that he would make it a pri
ority that "the housekeeping of the ASSU be highly
professional and responsible."
Shen was pleased to hear what he called "con
structive criticism" from the University chief.
"I asked him for suggestions about changes he
would make if he were in charge of the ASSU," Shen
said. "He possesses a unique perspective on how we
function and how well we function."
"To do a good job is first of all to administer the
ASSU well by tending finances and controls," Casper
said.
He asked the senate to "apply critical reasoning to
ASSU politics.
"I think you would all be greatly helped if you had
to sit here and make real decisions," he said.
The most significant decision of the evening, how
ever, was the decision Aingworth blocked.

The proposed bill would reshuffle seats in order to
balance graduate student representation. Under the
current system, the schools of Business, Law and
Medicine have, amomg them, a total of four represen
tatives; the School of Humanities and Sciences and
the School of Education have four; and the schools of
Engineering and Earth Sciences have seven.
The new measure would create three equal dis
tricts, each with five representatives. The first dis
trict would remain the same, but earth sciences would
shift districts to be grouped with humanities and sci
ences and education. Engineering would have a dis-

trict to itself.
Aingworth, a doctoral student
in the School of Engineering, sup
ported an amendment to the mea
sure proposed by graduate senator
Diogo Rau, which would have elim
inate graduate senator districting
altogether. That amendment
failed, setting up a vote on the orig
inal bill and Aingworth's subse
quent walkout.
Earlier in the meeting, the sen
ate spent two hours in debate over
Appropriations Committee recom
mendations regarding the 1997-98
budgets of groups that plan to seek
a special fee in April's student body

elections.
That debate began with a dis
cussion of the committee's
changes to the budgets of several
potential special fee groups. Sever
al groups had applied to be placed
on the ballots of undergraduates
only, but the Appropriations Com
mittee recommended that some of
them be placed on both the under
graduate and graduate ballots.
Two groups, the Stanford Film
Society and the Stanford Concert
Network, challenged the commit
tee's decision. After hearing the
film society's appeal, committee
members offered a friendly
amendment to allow the group to
move back to the undergraduate
only designation.
After a long debate, though, the
senate voted to deny the concert

network's request. Representatives
from the group immediately con
sented to be listed on both the un
dergraduate and graduate ballots,
and that measure quickly passed.
In its actions, however, the sen
ate failed to decisively answer the
question of whether or not the Ap
propriations Committee has the
right to move a group from one
designation to another.
Constitutional Council nomi
nee Robert Windom also urged the
senate to reconsider his nomina
tion, which was tabled at the Feb.
11 meeting.
Although the bill to take Win
dom's nomination off the table
passed early in the meeting, the
nomination itself was not voted on
as the senate lost quorum before it
could be considered.
