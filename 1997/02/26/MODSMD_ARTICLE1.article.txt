# Casper asks ASSU to act responsibly

### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Last night, a drawn-out and chaotic ASSU senate
meeting — which began with University President
Gerhard Casper's quarterly address — ended abrupt
lywhen Senate Chair Don Aingworth walked out.
In order to prevent a vote on a bill to redistrict
graduate senate seats, Aingworth left the meeting at
11:20 p.m., more than four hours after it began. His
departure broke quorum, and the senate was forced

said. "He possesses a unique perspective on how we
function and how well we function."

ASSU well by tending finances and controls," Casper
said.
He asked the senate to "apply critical reasoning to
ASSU politics.
"I think you would all be greatly helped if you had
to sit here and make real decisions," he said.
The most significant decision of the evening, how
ever, was the decision Aingworth blocked.

The proposed bill would reshuffle seats in order to
balance graduate student representation. Under the
current system, the schools of Business, Law and
Medicine have, amomg them, a total of four represen
tatives; the School of Humanities and Sciences and
the School of Education have four; and the schools of
Engineering and Earth Sciences have seven.
The new measure would create three equal dis
tricts, each with five representatives. The first dis
trict would remain the same, but earth sciences would
shift districts to be grouped with humanities and sci
ences and education. Engineering would have a dis-
