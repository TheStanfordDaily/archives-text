Clinton endorsed fund-raising
WASHINGTON (AP) — In the worried days
after the Democrats' 1994 election losses, Presi
dent Clinton scrawled his personal approval on a
plan to invite big party donors into the White
House and suggested some be given overnight
stays "right away."
For the first time, internal White House memos
released yesterday placed Clinton at the front-end
planning of a Democratic fund-raising blitz that

landed some major donors a night in the Lincoln
Bedroom and eventually ensnared the party in
controversy.
"Ready to start overnights right away," the pres
ident wrote in a January 1995 note that specified
he be given the names of the party's $50,000 and
$100,000-plus donors.
The White House said that there is no evidence
that anyone was ever asked for a donation at the
executive mansion or that anyone was given a set
price for a visit.

Americans in Saudi Arabia warned
WASHINGTON (AP) — Concerned about
threats from a "well-known terrorist," the U.S.
State Department is warning the 40,000 Ameri
cans living in Saudi Arabia to maintain a low pro
file and advising them to limit their travel within
the country.
Spokesman Glyn Davies said the warning
resulted from an "accumulation of signs and sig
nals," including an interview given last week by

Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi billionaire with links
to terrorist groups.
According to Davies, Bin Laden threatened
U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia. He also
called for the Saudi government to expell all U.S.
citizens from the country.
But the White House said U.S.-Saudi relations
"are strong and will remain so." The embassy
statement said the Saudis continue to cooperate
closely with the embassy to ensure the safety of
all Americans.
