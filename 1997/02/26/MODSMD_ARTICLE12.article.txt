## Editorial Zapata or Burciaga? 
### 
Students must examine
all historical issues prior
to making name change

Residents of casa Zapa
ta met last week to consider
a proposal to change their
dorm's name to Casa Burciaga but
instead appointed an advisory
committee amid questions about
the origins of the present day
name. The residents of Casa Zapa
ta acted appropriately in so doing;
complete answers must be found
before any action is taken, and, at
this point, there are far too many
questions unanswered.
Beyond these questions, howev
er, there is still the historical impact
of the Burciaga name about which
everyone involved must be aware.
The suggestion to rename Casa
Zapata comes only months after
the death of a former resident fel
low, Tony Burciaga. But there's
more to the proposal than simply
an attempt to memorialize the
man who painted murals on the
dining-room walls and served as a
guide to the dormitory's residents
for nearly a decade.
Three years ago, political and
social unrest shook this campus
when the University proposed
funding cuts to El Centro Chi
cano, the Chicano / Latino ethnic
center, and then laid off associate
dean of student affairs Cecilia
Burciaga, in what was presented
as a budget-cutting move.
She and her husband were
asked to leave their posts as RFs
after her dismissal. They became
the center of a struggle between
the Chicano / Latino community
and the University over issues
related to resources available to
Chicano and Latino students.
The 1994 crisis, which began
with Cecilia Burciaga's dismissal,
was exacerbated when a Sunday
Flicks audience shouted racial slurs
while viewing a short film about

migrant farm workers. This encour
aged activists to stage a three-day
hunger strike, forcing the Universi
ty to deal with Chicano / Latino
issues such as a Chicano studies
program and a grape boycott. Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice set
tled the strike by signing a commit
ment to visit those issues.
With all of that hot-button his
tory, it is important to consider
the meaning behind the current
name of the Chicano / Latino
theme dorm. We know that Emil
iano Zapata was an important his
torical figure in Latin America,
but we don't know if there was a
more significant, personal mean
ing to the naming.
Those rallying to change Zapa
ta's name to Burciaga must clear
ly explain their reasoning. Will the
dorm be named for Tony or Cecil
ia Burciaga? No one has been clear
about what the name will mean
for the dorm's future residents.
Will it symbolize the struggle of
the Chicano / Latino community
here at Stanford or be a tribute to
the Burciagas?
These are the questions that the
new committee must answer
before any substantive movement
on the issue can be made. The Uni
versity still has final authority over
the renaming issue, and it would
be wise to take this process slowly
so it can be done right.
The process the students are
following involves a dorm vote
which would be weighted against a
vote of all interested Stanford
community members. If the votes
end in favor of Burciaga, then the
University will examine the issue
and make its decision.
Renaming Zapata will have an
impact beyond the Chicano commu
nity Memories of the hunger strike
still cause administrators to wince
and the success of this current
effort behind the Burciaga name
will serve as a permanent reminder
to them of that delicate period. It
must be a polite and constructive
reminder, not a negative one.
