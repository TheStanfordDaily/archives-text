Ford Motors should not be blamed for sins of its founder

JESSE OXFELD'S COLUMN in yes
terday's Daily regarding Ford's
sponsorship of "Schindler's List"
was somewhat inaccurate and overly
judgmental due to an oversimplification
of Ford (both the company and the man)
and the facts of the day.
There is no denying the fact that
Ford was a fierce anti-Semite, but his
acceptance of the Supreme Order of the
German Eagle does not equate to his
support of the Holocaust; we must
remember when judging this action that
Hitler had, in the late 19305, been
named Time magazine's "Man of the
Year" for his transformation of Ger-

many back into a world power.
In early 1938, neither Ford, nor any
one in America, knew what atrocities
were soon to come from this evil
regime. We should not judge Ford's
acceptance of the Order based only on
our history, which was still the future
in July 1938.
This fact does not, however, condone
Henry Ford's viewpoints. His bigotry is
despicable today and should have also
been considered despicable at that time.
However, Oxfeld shows an incredible
amount of naivete in stating that there
is "something wrong" with the Ford
Motor Co. sponsoring a movie about the

Holocaust because of the founder's view
points. Nothing the Ford Motor Co. does
will erase Henry Ford's sins, but that
doesn't mean the company should ignore
vital social issues.
Ford Motors is a publicly held compa
ny, of which the Ford family owns less
than 10 percent equity. Oxfeld states
that "Ford's legacy of anti-Semitism
cannot be separated from the company
he created." By his words, not only are
the sins of the father visited on the son,
but also the grandchildren, great-grand
children and everything which the
father touched. With this logic,
shouldn't we be killing off the descen-

dants of the Auschwitz guards?
Ford Motor Co. is a responsible com
pany which has a good record on civil
rights issues. The current management
of the company should not be held
responsible for the views of a small
minded man who's been dead for
decades. The company should instead be
praised for using their advertising dol
lars to collectively raise America's con
sciousness regarding a vital issue.
I'd much rather see Ford spend mil
lions on "Schindler's List" than on driv
el like "Friends."
