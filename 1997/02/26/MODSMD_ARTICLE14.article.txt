# Anthropology Dept.'s polical problems stem from deans of H&S
##

The problems of designating a chair
for the Anthropology Department stem
not from "bickering" in the department,
as The Daily's Monday headline sug
gested but from what a majority of the

department's faculty view as a crisis in
governance created by the deans of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
During the year preceding former
chair Prof. Renato Rosaldo's stroke last
fall, the school's deans appeared to
have undermined his authority and cir
cumvented the due processes of depart
mental governance. They failed to act
on the recommendations of a distin
guished visiting committee, while
embracing alternative plans that had

never been considered, much less
approved by the department as a whole.
After a group of faculty complained
during the summer of 1996, the deans
"intervened" in the department's
searches by abrogating the depart
ment's authority to define positions and
appoint search committees. Since Rosal
do's stroke, the department has been
functioning under an acting chair, Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, who was
appointed by the deans.

It is simply inaccurate to attribute
the problems of designating a chair to
factionalism — which is found in virtu
ally any academic department — or to
anthropology's small size. Quite simply,
no one in the department can under
take to head it unless and until the
school's deans commit to honoring the
due processes of the department's aca
demic governance.
