## Experiencing cowboy nights 
### 
WHEN MY FRIEND Emily asked
me to go to the Saddlerack, San
Jose's country line-dancing bar, I
thought I knew exactly what I was in for.
I imagined myself stepping into a Ten
nessee-tinged alter-reality, a bizarre mat
ing ritual: a circus of red plaid, tight jeans
and big hair. I pictured square-dancing like
we had to do in third-grade gym class only
this time the people were actually choosing
to be there. It seemed like an all-too-real
version of virtual "Hee Haw." To put it
bluntly: my own personal nightmare.
Perhaps you think I'm exaggerating.
But understand that every bone in my
bookish, black turtleneck-wearing, Woody
Allen-loving body wretched at the idea of
spending four hours dancing the Tush
Push under flashing disco lights.
"But you're from Kansas," pleaded
Emily. "You're supposed to like country
music." I patiently explained that
although I grew up within two miles of the
largest country-dancing bar in the state of
Kansas, I spent most of my adolescence
writing tortured "I don't belong here"
poetry and drowning my misplaced soul in
bottomless cups of Denny's coffee.
Besides, I thought, the last thing I
wanted to do was support some glorified
version of down-home, Bible-belt values.
In my mind, the word cowboy occupies the
same discursive area as Texas, the NRA,
the cattle industry, beauty queens and

Jerry Falwell. Men and women who utter
the words "God," "country," and "breast
enlargement" without the least bit of irony
or doubt. Pretty hefty stereotypes, I know.
Emily assured me that it's not as bad as
I think. That I'd discover my true cowgirl
heart. And that Wednesday nights were
free, after all, so I wouldn't have to feel
guilty about supporting the spread of
country music — a cause at least as repre
hensible, I thought, as investment in
Burma or maquiladora factories.
After a while, though, I started getting
attached to the idea of checking it out. I
was curious, after all. It would, I rational
ized, be a learning experience. A cross-cul
tural excursion. A chance to laugh at a
bunch of Silicon Valley-types dressed up
like cowboys. An anthropological study,
only instead of pith helmets there would be
cowboy hats. I could see it now:
"The natives of the Saddlerack tribe are
a curious group, poised to begin the night
ly ritual observance. Dancing in straight
rows, costumed in black hats, tight denim
and large boots, their movements consist
of repeated stomping, shaking and thrust
ing motions executed in homage to a pan
theon of incarnate human gods with
names like Garth Brooks and Shania
Twain. Ancestral tradition dictates that
select members of the tribe risk public
embarrassment and even painful emascu
lation by riding a mechanical bull."

Of course, once I got there and started
dancing, all my stereotypes about the Sad
dlerack melted away. The blaring Tricia
Yearwood songs didn't grate on my ears as
much as I thought they would. The cow
boys weren't all raging Rush Limbaugh
devotees. And so what if they were? It was
all part of the charm.
It's sort of the same charm, I realize,
that I feel when I go back home to Wichita.
At first I dread everything: The fact that
everyone knows each other on the flight
back. The dreary, flat Midwestern land
scape. The übiquitous pro-life billboards.
The utter lack of used CD stores and Indi
an food. To name a few.
But after a while I really begin to appre
ciate Wichita and all its subtle charms: All
the honest, real people; a slower and more
sane pace of life; the best damn Denny's
this side of the Mississippi. So what if I
can't get a latte? And so what, I thought as
I slid out onto the dance floor at the Sad
dlerack last Wednesday, if my swank cow
boy dance partner just got out of jail?
As long as he dances a mean two-step, I
can deal. At least for a few hours, anyway.

thought and literature, suggests riding the
mechanical bull drunk.
