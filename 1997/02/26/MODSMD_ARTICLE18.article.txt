# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## No thank you: rejecting those polite rejections 
### 
NO. NYET. NADA. No way, Jos6.
Hit the road, Jack. Nope. Nix. No
chance in hell. Not on your life.
N-0 spells no. Which part of "no" don't
you understand?
There a million different ways to say
no. The following excerpt from a recent
rejection letter, however, is not one of
them: "After careful review of our
staffing needs and a thorough discussion
with respective office partners, it does
not appear that we can pursue your
interest in our practice at this time. This
should not be considered an adverse com
ment on your ability." And this is just
one of many such letters.
C'mon, people, get a spine! What kind
of sissy letters are these? How come
when the corporate world decides to
reject you for some reason they just
can't say no?
The most fascinating thing about
rejection letters is that not one of them
ever flat out says "no." If you read the
letter, in fact they do want to hire me;
it's just that they can't pursue my
"interest at this time. " It's not that my

qualifications are in any way off the
mark; it's just my timing. It's too bad I
didn't apply just a little bit sooner;
maybe that would've been the right
time. Or maybe if I apply again.
Or maybe they just want to say no, but
aren't willing to shell out the 32 cents to
send me a letter that reads: "Dear Jere
my, No. Sucks to be you."
Although such a letter may seem
harsh, it might be easier to take. With
the first approach — the touchy-feely
approach — it's harder to hate those bas
tards. I mean, after all, they are not
making "an adverse comment on [my]
ability." It's just that they have no need
for my ability "at this time." If they sent
me a sucks-to-be-you letter, at least I
could hate them without feeling guilty.
Now, instead of unadulterated hate, I
have to head off to my shrink just to
have her tell me that "the firm did take a
careful review of their staffing needs,
and it just wasn't in your mutual inter
est to proceed any further."
Could you imagine if Coke or Pepsi
decided to use the corporate doublespeak,

touchy-feely approach? Instead of typing
"Sorry, Try Again" underneath the bot
tle cap, their "rejection" would read:
"After careful review of your cola
needs and a thorough calculation of the
respective probabilities, it does not
appear that we can provide you with the
jet skis or trip to San Juan at this time.
This should not be considered an adverse
comment on your contest-taking ability."
Of course, the jury is still out
whether they rejected this approach or
simply realized they couldn't fit it all
under a bottle cap.
So which approach is better? Would
we rather be coddled with a frantic flur
ry of dependent clauses and preposi
tional phrases or be told exactly what
the other person is feeling? Would we
rather be let down so easy that we for
get to be upset? How many disclaimers
can we listen to before we need some
thing to be claimed?
Picture this scenario: Your girlfriend
knocks on the door one night with a
dozen long-stem roses in her hand.
Behind her are the Mendicants singing

"Brown-Eyed Guy." A violinist strolls
down the hallway muttering in Italian. A
tuxedo-clad man wearing gloves whisks
away a white sheet revealing a silver cart
covered in shrimp cocktail and oysters
Rockefeller. Your eyes tear up as your
girlfriend gets down on one knee and
hands you a diamond ring. Then she
looks up at you and says:
"Ethan, my darling?"
"Yes, Sandra," you say to her amid the
backdrop of tuxedos and a capella singers.
"After careful review of our boyfriend
needs and a thorough discussion with
prospective alternative partners, it does
not appear that we can pursue your
interest in our companionship at this
time. This should not be considered an
adverse comment on your ability."
Who's this "we" she's talking about,
anyway? The Mendicants? And how
would they be able to make "an adverse
comment on your ability"? And if they
could, how would Sandra know anything
about it? OK, who spilled the beans?
Imagine a world where everyone spoke
like Sandra and refused to just say "no"

when that's what they meant.
McTeenagers who ask, "Do you want
fries with that?" would be barraged with
"a careful review of a customer's super
sizing needs." Cops who ask "do you
know how fast you were driving?" would
be given "a thorough discussion of
respective vehicle velocities." And think
how long Jeopardy would last if Alex Tre
bek needed to qualify everyone of his
omniscient rejections of an incorrect
answer (even if it was properly phrased
in the form of a question).
Careful review and thorough discus
sions are wonderful things, but some
times it's just better to say what you
mean, even if what you mean is "no."
Twelve-letter words are often exciting,
but sometimes they are just plain osten
tatious and disingenuous.

public policy, is looking for a company
to buy his soul.
