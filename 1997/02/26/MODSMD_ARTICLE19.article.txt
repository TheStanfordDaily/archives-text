## Mapping of entire plant genome currently underway Genetically altered plants may help solve world's resource problems 
### Akash Garg 
It may be hard to believe, but a
small, seemingly insignificant
mustard plant named Arabidop
sis thaliana may hold the solu
tion to world hunger, deforesta
tion and a host of many other
environmental and social prob
lems.
In an international effort to
complete the first mapping of an
entire genome of a higher organ
ism, plant biologists around the
world are confident that within
six years, a complete gene map of
A. thaliana will be available to
the public.
Out of the 250,000 species of
flowering plants, A. thaliana was
chosen for this project because of
its physical and genetic proper
ties.
"We mostly chose it because it
has the smallest amount of DNA
of any plant. It is also typical of
higher plants. It's a little mus
tard plant, so it's easy to grow in
the laboratory," said Prof. Chris
Somerville, director of the
Carnegie Institution's Depart
ment of Plant Biology at Stan
ford.
Stanford is one of five research
institutions around the world
responsible for the sequencing of
the plant.
All data of the sequencing so
far has been made publicly avail
able in order for the scientific
community to aid in the research.
Once mapped, researchers must
match the genes with specific
traits of the plant.
Gene research on other organ
isms has often allowed scientists

to identify and compare similar
traits between different species of
plants and animals, including
fungi and bacteria.
"When we obtain some
sequence information for a plant
gene, there's a very high proba
bility that we can actually just
look at that sequence and com
pare it to a human, mouse or fly
gene and then infer what the

function of that gene is. And
that's what the real value of this
has been. Suddenly, we are able
to piggy back on the research
being done on animals and fungi
and bacteria to learn about the
plant," said Somerville.
So far, the researchers have
been able to identify half of the A.
thaliana genes' functions. Bio
chemistry Prof. Ronald Davis is

in charge of the plant sequencing
at Stanford.
Vast amounts of data are col
lected from gene sequencing.
This tremendous undertaking
has led to the development of cut
ting edge robotics and sophisti
cated technologies to collect and
analyze the data.
"The most difficult aspect of
sequencing the genome is putting

all of the data together," said
Nancy Federspiel, a researcher in
Davis' group.
"Another reason for the plant
project is that it is much smaller
than the human, so this is still a
good test system for technologies
that are going to be used on the
human genome," Somerville said.
The complete gene map of A.
thaliana will have many positive

and far-reaching effects. For
example, it will be possible to iso
late genes that deal with disease
and temperature resistance.
Somerville's team has already
been able to genetically alter the
plant to produce a biodegradable
plastic by inserting three crucial
genes into its genome.
"We estimate around 30 to 40
percent of all the plant material
produced in agricultural products
are lost to pesticide and
pathogens. If we can learn how to
specifically engineer plants for
resistance, that will have a huge
effect on the efficiency of agricul
ture," said Somerville.
One technological break
through that may decrease defor
estation is the discovery of the
gene that is responsible for cellu
lose synthesis in trees.
According to Somerville, half
of the trees cut down for pulp and
paper are lost as byproducts. By
increasing the productivity of cel
lulose in trees, fewer trees will
have to be cut down.
"The competition for basic
resources is going to get pretty
tough in many regions of the
world. Our only hope is to
increase plant productivity. If we
were using the same wheat that
we used in 1960, we would need
to be growing an extra 800 mil
lion hectares of wheat to feed the
world," said Somerville.
With the world's population
rapidly expanding, food and
resources will become scarce.
The A. thaliana genome project
will provide invaluable informa
tion for the solution of these
problems.
