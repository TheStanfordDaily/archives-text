Important enzyme successfully synthesized

Cytochrome C oxidase, a very important protein
in the world of enzymes, has finally been synthe
sized in a lab. Although scientists have known its
general function for quite some time — it provides
the energy and heat needed to power almost all liv
ing things — no one has been able to reproduce both
its structure and its chemical reactivity.
Now a Stanford research group headed by Chem-

istry Prof. James Collman has successfully synthesized a working
model of this important protein.
Last year, X-ray crystallography revealed the structure of
cytochrome C oxidase. Since many of its specific functions are still
unclear, Collman's research group developed the enzyme model to
test the current understanding of how the enzyme works.
The enzyme can be found in the mitochondria of all animal
cells, where it performs its important processes. If the mitochon
dria are the cellular powerhouses of the cell, then cytochrome C
oxidase is the furnace within the powerhouse. It breaks up oxygen
molecules and combines them with hydrogen atoms to make
water. The energy it releases is necessary for the cell to function
properly.
In fact, this chemical reaction is so important that any disrup
tion of the process would lead to immediate death. Cyanide, for
example, is toxic to humans simply because it disrupts the reac
tivity of the cytochrome C oxidase.
The development of the model came as a direct result of Coil
man's previous research on hemoglobin. His group claims that
their cytochrome C oxidase model is just as good as the real thing.
Both molecules work by the same processes, have similar active
centers and function at the same acidity level.
Collman said in a statement that he had gained new insights
into the function of such molecules through synthesizing
cytochrome C oxidase.
Why is Collman investigating this one protein? "It is our job as
bio-inorganic chemists to unlock the secrets of these special
enzymes," he said.
Mooney calls for research on biodiversity

Biology Prof. Harold Mooney, an environmental
ist and secretary general of the International Council
of Scientific Unions, recently called on scientists to
research the effects of a loss of biodiversity on ecosys
tems of the world.
Mooney based his request on a study recently
commissioned by the council which suggested that a
significant loss of variation among living species

could lead to irreparable environmental damage.
Given the serious consequences of declining biodiversity,
Mooney suggested that scientists would do well to study the situa
tion more closely. "You'd think this would be a simple question:
Does loss of biodiversity affect the function of ecosystems? But for
some reason, until recently few scientists had focused on this
issue," Mooney said.
The study, led by Mooney, suggested that when an ecosystem
loses large amounts of its living inhabitants, the systems that nur
ture life begin to disappear.
For example, the water cycle might be disrupted, leading to a
lack of pure water, or the carbon cycle could falter, leading to cli
mate changes.
Of particular concern is the fact that attempts to reconstruct
declining ecosystems have proven to be unfruitful. Once made fi ag
ile by loss of biodiversity, the environment could never return to
normal, Mooney suggested.
"This tells us that we ought to be prudent about practices that
reduce diversity," he said. "Unless we learn how to reconstruct
ecosystems, we ought to be very careful before tearing them apart.
