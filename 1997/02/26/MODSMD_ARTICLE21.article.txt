# Molecule crucial for surviving HIV found
## 
### Nina Chinosornvatana 
Stanford researchers recently
discovered evidence linking the
molecule glutathione to surviving
HIV disease. Their findings show
that HIV-positive patients with
high levels of glutathione are more
likely to survive, particularly
patients suffering from more
advanced symptoms of the disease.
Genetics Profs. Leonard and
Leonore Herzenberg, a husband
and-wife research team at the
School of Medicine, conducted this
study in conjunction with other
Stanford researchers.
Their work was done over the
course of three years. The more
than 200 HIV-infected patients
chosen as subjects were identical
except for their glutathione levels.
As the study progressed, the
CD4 counts of many of the patients
dropped below the threshold of sur
vival. Yet 80 percent of those sub
jects with low CD4 cell counts but
adequate glutathione levels sur
vived, outliving patients with lower
glutathione levels.
CD4 is a protein that is found on
the surface of a major group of
immune system cells called T lym
phocytes, or T cells. These cells
control immune response to for
eign invaders. CD4, also called "T
-helper" cells, secrete chemical fac
tors which determine whether T
cells are able to launch an attack. It
is widely known that the HIV virus
targets this specific protein for
damage.
In a healthy adult, the CD4
count is between 800 and 1,000.

Victims of AIDS can have counts
below 200, leaving them vulnerable
to simple bacterial and fungal
infections.
The recent findings shed some
light on the biochemical aspects of
HIV.
"It's been known since 1989
that people with HIV have CD4
cells deficient in glutathione,"
Leonard Herzenberg said. "Now
we know that glutathione levels
matter to patients' survival."
Glutathione, or GSH, is a tiny
tripeptide that plays a key role in
several metabolic processes. This
molecule is present in every animal
cell, protecting them by attacking
dangerous oxygen radicals. GSH
also helps regulate the cell cycle.
The absence of this essential
molecule prevents T cells from
functioning properly. Also, a pro
tein called the tumor necrosis fac
tor is more likely to wreak havoc on
the body when GSH is not present.
This protein is a member of a group
of proteins called cytokines which
regulate the production of immune
cells. Its overexpression can initiate
a chemical cycle which leads to cell
death.
The immune systems of HIV
infected patients produce large
amounts of inflammatory
cytokines in response to the pres
ence of the virus. Certain cytokines
suppress the expression of glu
tathione. This, combined with
drugs such as acetaminophen
which deplete GSH, subverts a key
immune response.
The researchers began to search
for a direct correlation between

GSH and HIV survival after read
ing studies showing that HIV posi
tive patients have low levels of
GSH in their plasma, lung epithe
lial lining fluid, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and other blood
cells.
The recent findings also provide
a new method of tracking the pro
gression of HIV disease. Rather
than just measuring the level of
CD4 cells in blood, which is not
always reliable in predicting the
rate at which HIV disease is pro
gressing, physicians will be able to
use GSH to indicate how fast dete-

rioration occurs
in the final
stages of HIV
disease.
Because glu
tathione plays
such an impor
tant part in the
body's metabolic
processes, it is
essential to
ensure that
HIV-positive
patients have a
sufficient
amount of the
substance. A
drug called N
acetylcysteine,
or NAC, may be
one solution.
HIV damages
cell membranes
by making it
more difficult
for glutathione
to enter the cell.
NAC raises the

level of glutathione by encouraging
cells to produce glutathione from
the inside. This drug is nontoxic
and inexpensive and can be con
sumed orally. Further long-terni
studies, however, are needed far
NAC's approval.
Meanwhile, Stanford r«;
searchers urge HIV patients
use drugs containing
minophen only when necessary:
Acetaminophen is found in
Tylenol and other painkillers!
This substance, along with alcohol
and exposure to ultraviolet radia
tion, depletes glutathione levels. *

T-cells are essential for mounting an immune
response in the human body. HIV infects these
cells by binding with CD4 receptors located on
the cell surface.
