QHow do breath alcohol
I analyzers work ?
A .There are many myths
• about how to get around
breathalyzer tests by eating or
drinking certain substances or by
doing other strange and seeming
ly random things. None of these
really work, but sometimes it's
fun to see how far your friends
will go to make people think they
haven't been drinking.
It used to be that breathalyz

ers were not very accurate.
They used to be run by a reac
tion of potassium dichromate, a
very cheap oxidant, with
ethanol, the chemical name for
drinking alcohol.
The ethanol would be oxidized
by the dichromate, which would
then lose its yellow color. This
color change is what was detect
ed. The more the color changed,
the higher the reading the
instrument would return.
You could escape detection by
either lowering your breath alco
hol content or preventing this
reaction from happening, both of
which are quite difficult to do.
This method wasn't really all
that accurate and the results
could be affected by a lot of dif
ferent factors including temper
ature and other chemicals pre
sent in your breath. It's still
used in some places, but recently
a more accurate method has
taken its place.
The new method is based on
the absorption of infrared light
by molecules. This is a lot like
seeing what "color" a chemical is
using infrared light.

To us, alcohol seems to be a
clear liquid because it doesn't
absorb significant amounts of
visible light. However, like most
other chemicals, certain fre
quencies of infrared light are
absorbed by alcohol.
The absorption of infrared
light by chemicals is due to the
vibrational motion of molecules.
If you were to picture a molecule
as atoms connected together by
springs, you would be able to see
that the atoms would stretch,
bend and generally move around
with respect to each other. If
you've never taken an organic
chemistry class, you should —
even if it's just to see your pro
fessor try and demonstrate this
by dancing and waving his arms
wildly in front of the class.
The reason this is important
(not the dancing) is because each
type of vibrational motion has a
certain characteristic frequency.
When light of the same fre
quency interacts with the
molecule, the light will be
absorbed. For most of these vibra
tions the frequencies correspond
to infrared light. So by examining

the pattern of the frequencies of.-
light which are absorbed by a*!
chemical, you can determine what.;
kind of chemical you have.
In ethanol, there are two*;
vibrations that are specifically!;
targeted, the vibration of one of*
the carbon-hvdrogen bonds and.;
the vibration of the carbon-oxy-t
gen bond. These absorbencies;
are usually observed because.;
most other chemicals that you*,
would find in someone's breath •
don't absorb infrared light at the!
same frequencies. Chemicals*
which do interfere, at levels high!
enough to be detected, usually*-
cause death, for which there is a«
much easier test. I
There are smarter machines*
which can detect other sub-,
stances which might interfere'
with the measurement and com- •
pensate for their presence. Sol
really, there is no easy way to*
trick one of these analyzers.,.
Well, maybe except for walking!
around with a chicken on your •
head while eating whole garlic,
cloves and jalapeno peppers.'
Yeah, trust me, I'm the Sciencrf*
Bug. I know. . . .
