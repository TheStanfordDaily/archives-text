## Fencer uses talent, intensity to foil Stanford's opponents 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Not many potential NCAA champions quit their sports at
age 11 only to come back and dominate the national rank
ings. Freshman fencing phenom Monique de Bruin has
done both.
De Bruin, a native of Portland, Ore., started fencing at
10. Her elementary school had an afterschool fencing pro
gram to which de Bruin's parents, both of whom worked,
sent her and her siblings. She quit after a year. "I thought
it was too complicated," she said. "Plus, it wasn't very
interesting."
She changed her mind after a year and went back.
"I started doing pretty well, so that made me like it," she
said with a smile.
She fenced at her junior high and with a local fencing
club. Beginning in fifth grade, she practiced four times a
week; her hard work paid off when she started winning
regional championships, junior tournaments and finally
national tournaments.
The competitions were organized by age group, which
meant that de Bruin, who usually competed both in her own
age group and the one above it, would often win two titles at
the same tournament.
She is currently ranked at the No. 2 junior foil fencer in
America and No. 6 in the world.
Coach Zoran Tulum attributes de Bruin's success to her
extensive experience and her mental intensity.
"She has very good technique because she has fenced for
a long time and had good coaches," he said. "Most impor
tantly, she's very strong mentally. Off the strip, she's
always smiling — a nice, pleasant person who everybody
loves. When she steps on the strip, she's a fierce competitor.
That's what makes her so good."
The soft-spoken freshman left high school in the middle
of her senior year to train full-time at the Rochester Fenc
ing Center, home to America's top women's foilists. She
was 17 years old.
"That was really hard to do," she said. "It's so one
dimensional and really intense. It's hard when everything
in your life revolves around one thing — you get kind of sick
of it."
One reason de Bruin worked so hard was to prepare for
the U.S. Olympic trials, where she finished fifth. She went
to Atlanta last summer as the foil team's second alternate
and watched the fencing competition.
De Bruin had already represented the United States at

the 1994 World University Games in Fukuoka, Japan,
which she called "a lot of fun — there's not much pressure
and you can watch all the other events."
Right now, de Bruin juggles school, NCAA fencing and a
hectic travel schedule to meet the demanding requirements
of the Junior World Cup circuit.
"It's kind of a challenge to balance schoolwork and prac
tice and traveling — it's hard to figure out how to manage
your time," de Bruin said.
In one recent weekend, de Bruin flew to Italy to compete
in a World Cup tournament; she left Thursday and came
back Sunday night. "It's kind of a long trip just for the
weekend," she said, still fighting jet lag.
Junior World Cup events take place all over the world
from October to February; this year, the finals will be in the
Canary Islands. "I'm really looking forward to those," she
said with a smile.
As busy as she is, de Bruin is very glad to be in the col
lege environment. "Compared to last year, it's so much bet
ter to be doing lots of different things and meeting different
people," she said.
This is her last year of competing in juniors.
"I have to decide if I want to keep going with interna
tional competition" — which is expensive, time consuming
and demanding — "or whether I want to just fence for Stan
ford in the NCAA," she said. "Right now, I don't know —
I'm going to take it one year at a time."
De Bruin admits that it would be hard to give up some
thing she's been doing for so long but also points to the sac
rifices required to compete at such a high level.
"I already feel like I've missed out on a lot being so
focused on just one thing — like being here on the week
ends, for example," she said.
It's hard to get the college experience when you're only
at school one weekend a quarter. "It would be hard to give
it up, but it'd be nice to have some free time," she added
wistfully.
De Bruin is the cornerstone of Stanford's rising fencing
team. With athletic scholarships newly available to the
team, successful recruiting efforts by Tulum have yielded
impressive results.
The men's team is currently ranked No. 1 in the nation
and have several excellent young fencers who should vie for
the NCAA title. The women's squad is also on the rise. De
Bruin, who is undefeated (36-0) in college competition, will
almost certainly capture the Western Regional crown and
then make her bid to become the national champion next
month.
