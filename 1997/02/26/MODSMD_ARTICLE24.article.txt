# There's no place like home
## Netters make quick work of Spartans 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
Back at home on the Farm, the top-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team appears to be
itself again â€” confident and cool, crushing
any competition that dares to step into its
home at the Taube Family Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Recently back from the National Indoor
Championships on Sunday, where the top
seeded Card finished a disappointing ninth,
Stanford came home and ousted San Jose
State yesterday 7-0. The Cardinal improved
its record to 8-1 as the Spartans fell to 1-3.
"It was nice to come home and play on our
courts, in front of our home crowd," said
senior captain Grant Elliott.
While the Card's two top players, sopho

more Ryan Wolters and junior Paul Gold
stein, sat out for the day, the Card demon
strated its depth, dropping only one set all
day.
Freshmen Bob and Mike Bryan stepped up
to play the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively,
while Goldstein and Wolters looked on. The
freshmen drubbed their competition, as Bob
Bryan annihilated San Jose State's Steve
Reilly 6-1, 6-0, and Mike Bryan breezed by
the Spartans' Ryan Sellschop 6-1, 6-1.
At the third and fourth positions, the Card
had little trouble finishing off the Spartans.
Freshman Geoff Abrams took out San Jose
State's Damu Bobb 6-2, 6-2, while Elliott
defeated Tod Dissly 6-3, 6-1. Crushing his
opponent, the day was an easy one for the vet
eran and only senior on the team.
But the Card displayed its depth at the

fifth and sixth spots, where juniors Charles
Hoeveler and Misha Palecek, who do not usu
ally start for Stanford, came out with wins for
the Card. Palecek did it easily, destroying San
Jose State's Gordon Roman 6-0, 6-0.
"I felt really ready to play today, and I
came out and played well," Palecek said.
Palecek finished ofT Roman quickly but
said that it was his fan support that also
made the match a strong victory.
"It is great to have so much support from
friends who come to the match," Palecek said.
"They really motivate me."
Hoeveler had a strong day as well, coming
from behind to defeat San Jose State's Orion
Weihe 3-6, 7-6, 6-1.
In the doubles, Stanford had little trouble
as well. The freshman duo of
Bryan and Bryan stepped up to
the No. 1 position and defeated
Reilly and Dissly 8-2. The twins
appeared dominating on the
Card's home turf after three
straight doubles losses at the
National Indoors last week.
Elliott and Abrams cruised
past San Jose State's Weihe and
Bobb 8-1. The senior-freshman
duo improved its record to 5-2 on
the year. Stepping into the third
doubles position, juniors Hoevel
er and Palecek breezed by
Roman and Sellschop 8-1.
"Charles and I are playing
well together," Palecek said. "We
have not gotten much doubles
match play since the fall, so this
was good practice."
The two will compete again
when four Cardinal doubles
teams will travel to La Jolla over
the weekend to play in the Pacif
ic Coast Championships.
"It is always nice to go down
there and play before the tough
matches right before Dead
Week," Elliott said.
Stanford returns to the Farm
to take on Oregon March 4 at
1:30 p.m.
