Freshman power forward Mnrk Madsen helped the
Cardinal to two wins over its last three games, keeping
Stanford's hopes of an NCAA tournament bid alive. The
Cardinal's top inside i went 13-of-17 from the field
(a scintillating 76 percent) in three games against Wash
ington State, Washingto > and San Diego State. He was
the only Cardinal player ; n double-figure scoring each
game, with 35 total points second only to senior Brevin
Knight). The increasingly consistent Madsen also tallied
a team-high 22 rebounds in ju it 62 minutes of play over
the three-game stretch.

Senior All American Kate Starbird became Stanford's
all-time scoring leader by notching 21 points in Saturday
night's win over Washington. Starbird etched her name in
the Cardinal record book in front of an emotional Maples
Pavilion crowd anxiously awaiting her record-breaking
2,078 th point. She reached the mark early in the second
half on a driving layup that sent the fans into a frenzy. Star
bird could not have picked a better game to accomplish the
feat, as it was Senior Night and the Card's final home con
test of the regular season. Starbird was named a Pac-10
player of the week for the fourth time this season and a Nai
smith Award finalist along with senior Brevin Knight.
