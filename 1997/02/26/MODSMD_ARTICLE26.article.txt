# Baseball stings the Hornets with 18 runs at Sacramento
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Coming off a disappointing
weekend series, the Cardinal
had one last chance to regain its
confidence before league play
opens this weekend — yester
day's game at Sacramento State.
And after an 18-4 pummeling
of the Hornets, there is only one
thing the team can be thinking
— mission accomplished.
"It was a great game," said
sophomore center fielder Jody
Gerut, who turned in a 3-for-4
performance with a grand slam
and six RBIs. "Today really
showed the consistency we have
as a good team."
Gerut referred to last week
end's series with UC-Santa
Barbara, in which consistency
was lacking and the team was
plagued by an absence of clutch
hitting. The team reversed that
trend yesterday, smacking 22

hits off five Hornet pitchers.
"It was real good to get the
bats rolling," said junior second
baseman Joe Kilburg, who
turned in a 4-for-5 performance
with a homer and three runs. "It
felt good to string together some
hits, something we didn't do too
well last weekend."
Despite the abundance of
good fortune offensively for
Stanford, it was the Hornets
who jumped out in front first
with a run in the bottom of the
first.
That lead didn't last for long,
thanks to a pair of back-to-back
home runs. After Gerut reached
on a walk, sophomore infielder
Josh Hochgesang hit a long fly
to center field for a two-run
homer to tie the game at three.
One batter later, sophomore
catcher John Salter hit an oppo
site-field home run to put the
Cardinal back at the helm 4-3.
In the bottom of the inning,
however, Sacramento State was
able to get to freshman starter
Brian Fearnow for three runs. But
after junior reliever Josh Koons
took over for Fearnow, who was
making his debut, the Hornets
couldn't do any more damage at all.
And after the Cardinal began to
heat up, the end was unavoidable
for Sacramento State.
Gerut ignited Stanford's offense
in the top of the fifth when, with
the bases loaded and two outs, he
shot one far out of Hornet Field for
a grand slam, setting the stage for
the rest of the night.
"Gerut hit a grand slam, and we
really took off from there," said
freshman shortstop Eric Brunlett.
"It started us up."
"It was timely hitting like
Gerut's homer that let us win the
game," Kilburg said.
The Cardinal sealed the victory
with two more in the sixth, six in
the eighth and two in the ninth to
bring the final score to 18-4.
Meanwhile, Stanford relievers
heard nary a squeak from the Hor
net offense. After Koons no-hit
Sacramento State for three and
one-third innings, sophomore Jeff
Austin and held it silent for two
more innings each.
"The pitching was excellent,"
Bruntlett said. "They shut Sacra
mento down."
Most importantly, the victory

cleared any doubts that lingered
from the weekend.
"This win was rejuvenation for
us," Gerut said. "It was especially
important going into the USC
series."
The Cardinal opens league play
this weekend when formidable No.
3 USC makes the trip to Sunken
Diamond for a three-game series
starting Friday at 7 p.m.
