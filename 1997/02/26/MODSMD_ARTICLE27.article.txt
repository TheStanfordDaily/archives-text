# Women's polo rolls, men have rough time
## 
### Chris Clatterbuck 
After tough losses in last year's
Western Regional tournament, the
men's and women's polo teams are
striving this year to return to the
promised land of the national tour
nament.
Now, both the women's squad
(6-2,3-0 Western Regional) and the
men (5-2, 3-0) are poised to accom
plish such a feat.
When fifth-year senior Jason
Knight arrived at the Farm, he had
never ridden a horse before.
Five years later, he is the cap
tain of a men's team that has not
lost a regular season game in its
region in more than two years.
"I never like to lose," Knight
said. He has little to complain
about this year, as the men have
dominated their regional oppo
nents, outscoring them a combined
28-8.
The men's greatest strength
comes from their unity, as the
three players — Knight, senior
Adam Strom and fifth-year senior
Jeff Heeder — have ridden togeth
er for three years.
"Thev know each other," said

head coach Wes Linfoot. "Polo is a I*
game of anticipation; you cannot
wait for the ball to be hit before you %
turn." >
After three years together, they
are now able to anticipate each oth- •*
ere' actions, execute passes with *►
more precision and plav more like a %
team. Si
Similarly, the women have been V
able to recapture the teamwork
that led them to a trip to Nationals *•
in 1995. >
After taking a year off from polo, **
both fifth-year senior Ilia Christy !'
and senior Courtney Riggle have \
rejoined junior Alexa Christy. Now •*
reunited, they have resumed their *»
winning ways. '!
"This is the first year we've had
such strength and depth," Ilia *•
Christy said, referring to the play of •"
the alternates that helped carry the
team to a one-point victory over
UC-Santa Barbara, a game in •*
which she did not play.
That was the closest regional *1
game for the women, as they have
since dismantled both USC and Cal *•
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
