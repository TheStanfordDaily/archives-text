### Ben Hur Editorial staff 
The Cardinal ski team
completed its season over
the weekend at the West
ern Regional Champi
onship at Squaw Valley,
Calif.
Stanford's women
made a strong showing,

finishing third in both the slalom and
giant slalom. The men finished fourth in
the slalom.
Sierra Nevada College dominated the com
petition, sweeping both the men's and
women's slalom and giant slalom events. Nei
ther the Stanford men's or the women's
squads qualified for the national champi
onships, but sophomore Dorothy Wojtkowski
earned the right to compete in the champi
onships as an individual.
Wojtkowski's strong finish made her the
first Stanford racer to qualify for the nation
als since Ali Salomon in 1994. The National
Collegiate Ski Championships will take place
March 5-8 at Diamond Peak, Nev.
Cycling
The Stanford cycling team earned an
impressive victory at the Montebello Hill
Climb Time Trial sponsored by San Jose
State. The Cardinal men finished first in the
event with 265 points, easily surpassing sec
ond-place California, which had 206 points.

Stanford's Dario Falquier led all racers in
the A division with a time of 27 minutes, 40
seconds. The squad's performance seemed
even more impressive because the team was
able to earn points in each of its six categories.
Next week, Stanford will face first-place
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in a race that will
give the Cardinal a chance to close in on the
conference leader.
Bowling
The Stanford bowling team finished up a
busy weekend by defeating California twice
but falling once to both No. 17 Sacramento
State and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
The Card played in the final California
Intercollegiate Bowling Conference tourna
ment of the season, facing Sacramento State
in its first match Saturday. Stanford man
aged to steal only three of the 25 possible
points against the Hornets behind the
impressive bowling of Cardinal freshmen Tak
Nomura and Jacob Mishook.
The Cardinal bounced back to dismantle
Cal, picking up all 15 points against the Gold
en Bears as Stanford bowler Peter Andrew
Tenney's consistent performance led the way.
The Card then faced Cal Poly on Sunday
morning and was overwhelmed by the Mus
tangs. Stanford found solace by beating up on
Cal again, as Nomura bowled a personal-best
and season-high 225 to lead the Card. Fresh
men Ward Bullard and Parker Hume finished
off the Bears with turkeys in each of their
final frames, helping Stanford to a 15-0 win.
