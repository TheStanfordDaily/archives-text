# ROTC classes may be on campus by spring

In an agreement signed by Provost Condoleezza
Rice, the University has agreed to allow Army
ROTC courses to be taught using its facilities as
soon as next quarter.
Other items outlined in the contract call for the
listing of all military science courses in the Univer
sity catalog and the possible granting of transfer
credit to individually reviewed ROTC courses.
The agreement, which Rice signed last month,
will be finalized this week when signed by Col.
Richard H. Mackey, fourth region commander of
the U.S. Army Cadet Command. He will meet with
Rice later this week, according to Lt. Col. Robert
Reed, head of the Army ROTC at Santa Clara Uni
versity.
All other necessary signatures have been gath
ered: Reed signed on behalf of the Santa Clara bat
talion, and Santa Clara University President Paul
Pocatelli has also given his approval.
Reed said he has received fair indication that
Mackey will sign the agreement. "I suspect he will
sign it and then speak with the provost and basical
ly formalize the agreement with a meeting," he said.
"I see no reason . .. why he would not sign it."
According to Registrar Roger Printup, Universi
ty space will be allotted to Reed contingent upon its
availability.
"It's part of the agreement that we would make
that space available assuming that it was available
at the time of the request and that it was a facility
that met their needs," Printup said.
However, classes for next quarter have already
been scheduled. The Army ROTC will be left with
whatever spaces remain, Printup added.
Should Reed elect to use University space, Stan
ford would in essence be hosting a Santa Clara unit
on campus. This is distinct from Stanford having its
own ROTC unit.

Protests from the Stanford community to the
prospects of having ROTC on campus have
stemmed largely from contentions with the mili
tary's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
But Reed was careful to point out that the policy
does not preclude "known homosexuals from partic
ipating in the course."
"The commander in chief gives the ultimate
order," he said. "We do what we're ordered to do."
Reed said he will choose to request space depend
ing on student interest. "In the absence of stated in
terest, I would not plan to teach classes at Stanford
until fall quarter," he said.
Typically, "very few sign up for a program like
this the final quarter in a given year."
"However, if there is a sufficient number of stu
dents saying they would love to have a course spring
quarter . . . then I would respond appropriately,"
Reed added.
Both Printup and University Communications
Director Terry Shepard agreed that the allotment of
ROTC space was not a significant policy change on
the part of the University.
"There is no policy change at all," Shepard said.
"It has always been that they could hold such cours
es on campus if they wished."
In fact, ROTC activity on campus is not a new
concept. According to Printup, training exercises
took place at the University last spring. Other train
ing programs have made use of the athletic facilities
in the past.
In terms of courses being taught here, the ROTC
has not had "sufficient numbers of Stanford cadets
in past history to make it worth the commuting time
and the calendar time for an officer to come over
there to teach a class," Reed said.
Courses will be open to all students.
"All this agreement does is solidify what is exist
ing practice," Shepard said. "The only thing that is
