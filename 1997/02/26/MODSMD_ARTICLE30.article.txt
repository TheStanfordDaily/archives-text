# Top 16 engineering school grads win Terman awards

The School of Engineering gave out 16 Terman
Awards this year, recognizing seniors in the top 5
percent of their class based on letter grade indica
tors.
Engineering School Asst. Director Bertha Love
described one of the main benefits of the award. Re
cipients "are asked to select a high school teacher of
their choice who played a major role in their acade
mic guidance," she said.
Chosen teachers are then invited to a luncheon at
the Faculty Club scheduled for April 19. Travel and
accommodations are expense paid regardless of the
teacher's location, said Love.
"I feel very honored and fortunate to be receiving
the award," said electrical engineering major Tilden
Fang.
"I chose to invite my calculus teacher because she
gave me a lot of opportunities that I wouldn't have
had ordinarily," he said.
"In particular, there was a span of time when she
was forced to be absent," Fang said. "She asked an
other student and me to take over two of her classes
for her, including the Calculus BC class."
Benjamin Yang, a mechanical engineering major,
said he was surprised to receive the award.
"In fact, I don't necessarily feel that I deserve
such an honor, since I really didn't do anything more
than take the engineering classes for my major," he
said.
"For some reason," he added, "the Terman
Award sounds like I should have invented or won
something great to receive it. Regardless, I am hon
ored."

"I'm most pleased with the fact that I'll be able to
invite my high school physics teacher, Mrs. Matney,
to the awards ceremony," Yang said.
"She was both my AP Physics teacher and my
Academic Decathlon co-coach." he said. "This will be
the perfect way to say 'thank you' and show her that
I haven't forgotten all that she did for me — even
four years later.
"I chose to go into engineering largely because of
what I learned in two years of physics with her. It's
been a couple of years since I've seen Mrs. Matney, so
I hope she still remembers who I am and can make it
to Stanford to receive this award with me. Nothing
else would make me happier."
Computer science major Reuven Levitt had no
doubt how he earned the award.
"I knew that being a party animal would pay off in
the end," Levitt joked. If the Budweiser girls are un
available, he said, he plans to invite his old mathe
matics instructor from London.
"She changed my mind about studying and con
verted me from an F student — literally — to an A
student," Levitt said. "My being at Stanford is large
ly due to her."
Other recipients of the award include electrical
engineering majors Sean Hansen, Michael Hsieh,
Atsushi Kawamoto, Roger Han and Geoffrey
Schultz; computer science majors Denise Ho, Peter
Kim, Brian O'Connor and Matthew Schnitz; chemi
cal engineering major Dhruv Gupta, civil engineer
ing Elizabeth Nelson, industrial engineering major
Jerry Hwang and mechanical engineering major
Nathan Meezan.
The awards are named after Frederick Emmons
Terman, the school's dean in the 1940s and 50s,
often called "the father of Silicon Valley."
