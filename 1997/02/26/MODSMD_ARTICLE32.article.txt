# Hospital van adds dental care
## Service for uninsured local children giving check-ups, education 
### Sarah Jones 
Children who are medically underserved in several
local towns are beginning to receive free dental educa
tion from the staff of the Packard Children's Health
Van 11, a free mobile health care service which has al
ready been supplying medical care for more than a year.
The dental care is a joint venture between the Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's Hospital and the
Foothill College dental program. Services include flu
oride treatments, checkups, education about brush
ing and flossing, referrals and distribution of tooth
brushes and dental floss. All these are provided by
second-year dental hygiene students.
Currently, dental care is still in the preliminary
stages and is only available at one of the several loca
tions where the van stops.
"The volunteers don't actually do any dental pro
cedures," said Andrea Brant, marketing communica
tions coordinator of the hospital.
"The students teach the kids. It's like when you go
to the dentist but don't actually get any work done,"
she explained.
Children who need dental work are referred to
dentists who have volunteered their services at re
duced rates.
The Foothill College students volunteer as part of
their training. "The students take turns, and they are
able to learn to work with kids," said Maria Diamond,
Health Van 11 's director.
The van is a mobile health clinic fitted with offices

and staffed by physicians and nurses from the hospi
tal. It works in East Palo Alto, Mountain View, San
Jose, Palo Alto and Redwood City.
Immunizations, sick care and checkups are pro
vided for uninsured children ranging in age from in
fancy to 18 years. The van goes to each community
once a week and stops at easily accessible locations
such as schools and churches. Appointments are not
necessary.
"The goal of the van is to provide free health care
to those who do not have access to health care," said
Diamond.
The dental program was added because the van
staff noticed there was a need for education among
those it served. The staff tries "to put programs to
gether to meet the needs of the local communities,"
said Brant. "They could tell that there was a need
from the kids that they see."
In the van's first year of service, physicians helped
2,200 children. So far, more than 25 children have
benefited from the dental program. At this time, den
tal services are only provided at Slater School in
Mountain View, but the program will expand in
March to include the East Palo Alto location at Saint
Francis of Assisi Church.
Private donors and grants have provided the fund
ing for the van, and dental equipment is supplied by
Foothill College.
"We're very pleased," said Diamond. She said she
thinks the dental program "is a great service, and we
are very happy to be able to offer it to the community."
