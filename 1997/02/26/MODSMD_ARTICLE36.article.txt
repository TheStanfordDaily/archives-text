# Black organizations add a new spin to Greek life
## 
### Monique Richards 
ATT, A<t>A, KA*f, AKA - these
letters may all seem Greek to you,
but for members of Stanford's
African-American fraternities and
sororities, the meaning goes be
yond the symbols.
While there are many similari
ties between all the Greek letter
organizations on campus, differ
ences abound. For example, in
contrast to other Greek organiza
tions on campus, African-Ameri
can groups have remained very ac
tive at the graduate level and are
the only groups on campus that
engage in stepping, a form of
rhythmic expression.
The contributions of the four
African-American Greek letter so
cieties exemplify the develop
ments that Black Liberation
Month highlights. Alpha Kappa
Alpha Sorority Inc. and Alpha Phi
Alpha Fraternity Inc. were the
first of these organizations on
campus.
African-American fraternities
and sororities are a relatively re
cent addition to Stanford. Al
though most fraternities and
sororities have existed on campus
since the early 1900s, APhiA —
the first African-American frater
nity at the University — did not re
ceive its charter until 1978. Other
African-American fraternities and
sororities followed.
Senior Cristal Brown, presi
dent of Alpha Kappa Alpha Soror
ity Inc., explained her sorority's
arrival in 1981.
"It was not necessarily late,
compared to the establishment of
other [AKA] chapters across the
Bay," Brown said.
She added that while chapter
charters can take a long time to ob
tain, her sorority is still expand
ing. AKA has more than 100,000
members worldwide.
Brown believes the role of her
sorority is to participate in com
munity service, to foster sister
hood among its members and to
stress personal and academic ex
cellence. Many of her sisters are

leaders in other organizations on
campus, indicating their dedica
tion to service.
Since the first chapter of AKA
was founded at Howard Universi
ty in Washington, D.C. in 1908,
others have been created across
the world.
"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority
Inc. was founded by and for
African-American women to focus
on the various aspects of the
African-American female," Brown
said. She added that the AKAs also
sponsor social activities that allow
them to enjoy themselves in ways
not uncommon to their culture.
African-American fraternities
have a similar philosophy. The
first chapter of APhiA was found
ed at Cornell University in 1906.
The fraternity evolved from a so
cial studies club. Established to fill

a void of social and cultural inter
action among African-American
males on the Ivy League campus,
APhiA has grown steadily in influ
ence during the 90 years of its exis
tence.
"A number of diverse, talented
individuals have participated in
the Alpha experience through the
years," the APhiA World Wide
Web page says.
APhiA has implemented a
number of national programs
which have benefited the African-
American community as well as
the general community. Member
ship in the more than 700 under
graduate and graduate chapters of
the Alpha Phi Alphas has exceeded
125,000. The fraternity has been
interracial since 1945 and has
chapters in the Caribbean, Eu
rope, Asia and Africa.

William Copeland, a member of
APhiA, said he believes the frater
nity provides an opportunity for
the brothers to develop relation
ships with one another, to provide
programming that promotes cul
tural interaction and to partici
pate in community service.
Copeland said APhiA has a fair
admittance policy and appreciates
the focus of his fraternity on the
African-American male.
"It's been a great experience,"
Copeland said.
Regardless of ethnicity, Greek
organizations bring together indi
viduals with similar interests. The
founding of the first fraternal or
ganization, Phi Beta Kappa was
based upon this reasoning. Creat
ed in 1776 this fraternity soon be
came a scholarship honor society.
However, this trend reversed at
the turn of the century, when fra
ternities replaced literary soci
eties.
The diversity that has
emerged on college campuses
since the inception of Phi Beta
Kappa has warranted the found
ing of the different fraternities
and sororities that exist today.
Delta Sigma Theta, a public ser
vice sorority, and Kappa Alpha
Psi, a fraternity committed to
community service and on-cam
pus programming, have similar
philosophies.
A task force commissioned by
Mary Edmonds, vice provost for
student affairs, is currently con
ducting a comprehensive review of
the status and future of all frater
nities and sororities on campus.
The task force is an attempt to
identify the organizations' con
temporary relevance, Edmonds
said. She expects to have the rec
ommendations of the task force by
the end of winter quarter.
In response to the mention of
the task force, Brown, speaking
for her sisters in AKA, said, "We
know we're a relevant and viable
force."
