# Schmidt explains how U.S. schools' curriculums trail

### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
About 200 educators and parents
went to Palo Alto's Gunn High
School last night to discuss how
U.S. students measure up against
their foreign counterparts.
The panel urged educators and
political leaders to focus less on
quantitative rankings and more on
teaching format in order to improve
American education.
The principal speaker was
William Schmidt, a statistics profes
sor from Michigan State University
and co-author of one of the nation's
most recent international compara
tive studies on secondary education.
He is also head of the U.S. commit
tee on standardized testing.
Schmidt led the U.S. research for
the Third International Math and
Science Study, the latest portion of
which was released in November.
Dean Richard Shavelson of the
School of Education has been on the
study's steering committee since its
inception about six years ago.
The study quantifies how eighth
graders in the United States lag
behind students of many other na
tions in mathematics and science.
"One of the things we did in de
signing this study was to try and
make it more than the Olympics or
the horse races," Schmidt said. "We
wanted to learn something about
how we might improve education in
math and science."
Schmidt spent the majority of his
2 1/2 hour speech focusing on what
could be done to improve the sys
tem.
"The answer lies in what schools
are all about — what we teach and
how it is that we teach it," Schmidt
said.
One of the meyor problems, he
said, is that the U.S. curriculum is
"a mile wide and an inch deep."
Math and science classrooms in the
United States typically try to cover
30 topics each year. This contrasts
to the five or six topics covered in
Japanese schools.

"A lot of what is done in the class
room is determined by the text
books," Schmidt said.
He added that U.S. textbooks are
less focused than those of other na
tions.
"I can tell you — we have the
biggest textbooks in math and sci
ence of any other country in the
world," Schmidt said.
He added that American text
books are most often more than 500
pages long. Other countries use pa
perback textbooks which only have
about 200 pages and cost $30 to $40
less than their hardback American
counterparts.
Schmidt posed the idea that the
money saved could be spent on bet
ter training for teachers on the job.
He was quick to point out, how
ever, that the blame does not lie
with the teachers.
"Our teachers do exactly what
we have asked them to do. They try
to teach everything we've told them
to," Schmidt said.
With Shavelson deeply involved
in the study, students in the School
of Education are not oblivious to the
work that has been done.
"Certainly, the teachers we pre
pare at Stanford are aware of the is
sues and aware of the dilemmas,"
Shavelson said.
Another problem teachers face,
Schmidt said, is dealing with frag
mented textbooks where topics
often do not relate to one another.
"You can't expect the individual
teachers to resolve the problem of
coherence," Shavelson said.
Both Schmidt and Shavelson
agreed that when talking about edu
cation, people often get sidetracked
with peripheral issues such as uni
forms, vouchers and charter
schools.
"You can say it's the vouchers,
but if you aren't teaching the con
tent, then you're missing what the
math and science study says,"
Shavelson said.
"Those don't deal with the heart
of the matter — the curriculum and
how we teach it," Schmidt said.
