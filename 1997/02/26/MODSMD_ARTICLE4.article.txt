The Task Force on Residential Programs
and Student Housing for Undergraduates
initiated a series of town meetings last night,
giving students a chance to share their views
on issues such as the Draw and Residential
Education.
Last fall, University President Gerhard
Casper and the ASSU Senate formed the
task force in an endeavor to improve resi
dential life and the spring housing lottery.
The task force — composed of 16 members
including students, faculty and staff — will
also examine new possibilities such as
mandatory all-freshman housing.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldivar chairs the committee
and led the open forum held at Storey. Saldi
var posed ideas such as designating a group
of residences specifically for freshmen or
dormitories set aside specifically for fresh
men and sophomores.
According to senior Nima Farzan, "The

lifestyle of upperclassmen
is so different from fresh
man year. For example, all
the seniors are taking in
terviews. You build strong
bonds with people who are
going through the same
things — people in your
class."
Many agreed that stu
dents have often found

their niche by sophomore year and have less
need for prominent resident assistants in
upperclassman life. Farzan suggested the
Row house model of a single RA as an alter
native to the team of RAs assigned to each
dormitory.
In particular, the Res Ed programs —
which are often organized by dorm RAs —
were seen as beneficial to freshmen adjust
ing to coLiege but viewed as a hassle for up
perclassmen. Again, the Row house style of
having less prominent RA positions and
