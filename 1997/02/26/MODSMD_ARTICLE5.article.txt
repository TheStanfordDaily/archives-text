# Law prof speaks on diversity
## Calls Republicans, Christians underrepresented in law faculty 
### David Gamage 
'im Lindgrin, a law and sociology profes
so at Northwestern University, gave an un-
U' ual prescription for increasing faculty di
\ ersity during a Law School panel yesterday.
In light of recent controversy over issues
such as minority tenure, Lindgrin con
structed a discourse that addressed "diver
sity" under contexts that depart from the
usual categories.
"If we truly want to represent a diversi
ty of ideologies in law school faculties," he
said, "we should look toward hiring more
Christians and Republicans. If we're trying
to practice diversity hiring, traditional no
tions of affirmative action don't make
much sense."
Lindgrin was presenting the results of
his extensive empirical study of the gender,
racial and political makeup of law school
faculties. John Donohue, the chair of the
Law School's faculty appointment commit
tee, gave a response following Lindgrin's
presentation.
Lindgrin's study, the first of its kind,
looks at the proportion of Law School pro
fessors of various minority groups as com
pared to the minority group's total partici
pation in the work force. His study ranks
underrepresented minority groups by the
degree of underrepresentation.

"In order to bring faculty populations up
to parity, every American law school would
have to hire 128 more Christians, com
pared to only two more blacks," Lindgrin
said.
Female Republicans qualify as the most
underrepresented group on the study,
while traditional minorities are ranked as
being only slightly underrepresented when
compared to Christians and Republicans of
all races.
"We usually think of white males as an
overrepresented group, but it makes more
sense to think of them as white Democrats,
[because] white Republicans are actually
underrepresented," said Lindgrin.
His study says that white Democrats
form an overwhelming majority of law pro
fessors, serving to make all other groups
under-represented.
In his response, Donohue tried to ex
plain the partisan discrepancy in represen
tation.
"It may be Democrats have been more
interested in law and government as acade
mic pursuits, while Republicans have been
more drawn to business," he said.
Donohue also questioned the relevance
of citing religious minorities, saying "music,
athleticism and many other characteristics
