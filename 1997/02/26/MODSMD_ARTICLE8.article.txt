## Troops endangered Pentagon report says Army knew of possible exposure to Iraqi chemicals 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Senior Army officers fighting the
Gulf War suspected in February
1991 that an Iraqi weapons
depot contained chemical
weapons but failed to alert U.S.
troops who blew up the site less
than two weeks later, the Pen
tagon acknowledged yesterday.
The information is contained
in a still-classified document,
according to the Pentagon's
senior investigator into Gulf
War matters, Bernard Rostker.
He has asked the CIA to declas
sify the memo, but the request
has been denied because it would
disclose "sources and methods"
on how the information was
obtained, Rostker told reporters
at a Pentagon briefing.
Rostker called the briefing to
release his report into the March
1991 destruction of the Iraqi
storage site at Kamisiyah by
members of the 37th Engineer
ing Battalion. Last June, the
Pentagon announced that it had
only recently learned that U.S.
troops may have been exposed to
chemical weapons during the
destruction of the site.
However, the new report
makes clear that information
existed even before the war was
concluded on Feb. 28, 1991, that
the Army suspected chemical
weapons were at Kamisiyah.
On Capitol Hill, senators who

have been critical of the Pen
tagon's handling of unexplained
illnesses among Gulf War veter
ans said the new report adds
weight to suspicions of a govern
ment cover-up.
Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-
W.Va., said "we now know posi
tively" that the CIA informed
the Army on Feb. 23, 1991, that
there were chemical weapons at
Kamisiyah and "totally failed to
publicly come forward until late
last year." The CIA, he said, "is
every bit as implicated" as the
Defense Department.
"It is in my judgment a cover
up of major proportions, and will
lead to very serious consequen
tial actions," Rockefeller said.
Rostker said he does not
believe any cover-up occurred,
saying only that his report high
lights "missed opportunities" to
pass on information or to inves
tigate what actually happened in
the years after the war.
"There's no question that
there were leads that were not
followed," he said, although
"people (were) trying to do their
job as best they could."
The report does not clarify
whether troops actually were
exposed to sarin nerve gas, Ros
tker said, nor does it answer all
questions about what happened,
let alone why so many veterans
are sick.
