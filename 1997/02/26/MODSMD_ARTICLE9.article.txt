# Clinton to boost anti-drug funds
## $16-billion program unveiled 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres
ident Clinton outlined a mas
sive, $16-billion anti-drug strat
egy yesterday amid signs that
his administration would give
Mexico a slap on the wrist for its
government's ties to drug traf
fickers.
"We have to become angry
whenever any child — one single
child — becomes prey for drugs
and violence," Clinton said at a
morning ceremony formally
unveiling his drug-fighting bud
get, which the White House
touted as the largest in history.
It represents an $800 million
increase over the fiscal 1997
drug budget.
In his remarks, the president
did not directly address the
pressing question of Mexico's re
certification for anti-drug aid,
which must be decided by March
1. He said generally that deci
sions would be made after Secre
tary of State Madeleine Albright
returned today from her over
seas trip.
"We are committed to cooper
ating with our friends in Latin
America,"the president said.
"We want to cooperate with
them, but we want them to coop
erate with us as well."
Mexico was embarrassed earli
er this month by the arrest of its
top anti-drug official on charges

he had links to drug traffickers.
The arrest came as Clinton
administration officials were
ready to rubber stamp Mexico's
re-certification for the State
Department aid program that
assists foreign governments in
fighting drugs.
Since the scandal complicated
re-certification, White House
officials have dodged speculation
on the outcome, saying they
await Albright's recommenda
tion. She said this weekend that
the administration could fail to
certify Mexico as a cooperating
ally in the war against drugs but
then grant a waiver to permit
continued aid on grounds of U.S.
national security interests.
On the domestic front, Vice
President A 1 Gore, who joined
Clinton for the morning event,
noted that drug use among teens
has doubled over the past five
years and that one-third of new
AIDS cases are linked to intra
venous drug use. Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, the president's drug
czar, said 3.6 million Americans
are addicted to illegal drugs.
The president's anti-drug plan
relies heavily on a major, $350-
million ad campaign that would —
if the private sector antes up half
of the money — bombard young
people with anti-drug messages
during prime-time television.
