## Bad news for GOP Democratic senator's announcement is likely to kill budget amendment 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In an
all but fatal blow, Sen. Robert
Torricelli announced opposition
yesterday to the Republican
drafted balanced budget amend
ment to the Constitution. He said
the proposal could hamstring
future generations confronting a
military crisis, recession or the
need for federal construction.
"We write not for our time but
for all times," said Torricelli, D-
N.J., who has supported similar
constitutional amendments in
the past. When it comes to mak
ing a change in the 210-year-old
Constitution, he added, "good is
not good enough."
Elected to the Senate last
November, the New Jersey Demo
crat thus became the 34th Demo
crat to oppose the measure,
enough to ensure its defeat.
Republicans rushed to attack
Torricelli for breaking a campaign
promise. "He has thumbed his
nose at the people of New Jersey
once and for all," charged Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott.
At the same time, Torricelli's
decision confronted Lott with a
choice between offering conces
sions in hopes of gaining the elu
sive 67th vote in support of the
measure — or watching it go
down to the narrowest of defeats
next week and trying to pin the
blame on the Democrats.
The White House issued a state
ment in which President Clinton
said he was pleased with Torricel
li's decision. He added it was now
"time to get down to the hard work
of balancing the budget."
The proposal, a cornerstone of
the Republican congressional
agenda, would require a balanced
budget by 2002, with a three-fifths
vote of the House and Senate to
run a deficit thereafter. It cleared
the House two years ago, when the

Republican revolution was in full
flower, but fell one vote shy of pas
sage in the Senate.
Within the new Senate, where
all 55 Republicans support the
measure, it quickly became clear
that the swing votes were held by
the four newly elected Democrats.
Two of them, Max Cleland of
Georgia and Mary Landrieu of
Louisiana, announced their
reluctant support over the past
several days.
Sen. Tim Johnson of South
Dakota declared his opposition
last week, even though he, like
Torricelli, had supported a similar
amendment only two years ago.
And shortly after Torricelli's
announcement, the Republican
National Committee disclosed it
would begin airing radio commer
cials in South Dakota today saying
Johnson "broke his promise."
Landrieu's announcement on
Monday left Torricelli squarely
in the spotlight — a position
clearly welcomed by a newcomer
who has moved forcefully to
establish his presence within his
party and the Senate.
He conferred privately with
senior Democratic colleagues on
Tuesday, spoke by telephone
with Clinton, delivered a formal
maiden speech in the Senate at
dinner time and met with Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, in a room
behind a darkened chamber
immediately afterwards.
The New Jersey Democrat
voted for similar amendments
twice before, most recently in
1995 in the House when he was
preparing for his Senate candida
cy. He told reporters that he had
done so to get the attention of
Presidents Bush and Clinton at a
time when deficits were approach
ing $300 billion.
