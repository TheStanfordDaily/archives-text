# Greenspan warns of 'excessive optimism'

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan took his sharpest aim
yet at the raging bull market yes
terday, warning of "excessive
optimism" on Wall Street and
reminding investors the Fed could
launch a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
The comments roiled financial
markets, sending stock and bond
prices plunging. The Dow Jones
industrial average was off more
than 120 points in afternoon trad
ing but trimmed those losses to
close down 55.03 at 6,983.18.
In delivering his semiannual
report to Congress on monetary
policy, Greenspan used blunter
and more detailed language to
describe the central bank's wor
ries than he had in a Dec. 5 speech.
At that time, he first raised con
cerns that investors might be in the
grips of "irrational exuberance."
Markets plunged around the world,
but the impact was short-lived and
the Dow soon began setting new
records, crossing the 7,000-point
level in recent weeks.
In his new testimony,
Greenspan pointedly mentioned
that the Fed was closely monitor

ing financial markets and the
overall economy and stood ready
to raise interest rates to fight
pending price pressures.
"This is a rather blunt warning
that if the stock market continues
to roar ahead, it is threatening to
become a source of economic
instability," said Lyle Gramley,
economic consultant at the Mort
gage Bankers Association and a
former Fed board member.
American investors, especially
those saving for retirement, have
been pouring money into the stocks
, helping to fuel the rapid increases
in stock prices in recent years.
Greenspan and officials in the
Clinton administration have
begun to worry about the impact
on these investors, many of whom
are investing for the first time, if
there is a sharp and prolonged fall
in stock prices.
Many economists viewed
Greenspan's comments as the
clearest evidence yet that the cen
tral bank will start raising interest
rates, probably at its May meeting.
The Fed last changed interest
rates on Jan. 31, 1996, when it cut
its target for the rate banks charge
on overnight loans to 5.25 percent.
