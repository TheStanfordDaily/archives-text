# Hillary Clinton wins a Grammy
## 10 artists win multiple awards in music industry's yearly ceremony 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - From
the Beatles to Beck, 10 different
artists won multiple Grammys
yesterday in a ceremony that
celebrated music's diversity.
Even a "tone deaf first lady
took home a Grammy.
Multiple award winners
included the Beatles, the
Fugees, Beck, Sheryl Crow,
Eric Clapton, Kenneth "Baby
face" Edmonds, LeAnn Rimes,
Toni Braxton, Celine Dion and
Vince Gill.
In a year of no clear trends, it
was one song that proved domi
nant. The composition "Change
the World" was responsible for
four Grammys â€” for singer
Clapton, its songwriters and
producer Babyface. It also was
named record of the year.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, say
ing she was "amazed" to win for
her recording of her book on
child rearing, "It Takes a Vil
lage," picked up the prize during
the pre-telecast presentation
ceremony at Madison Square
Garden before heading back to
Washington for a state dinner.
"I was very surprised
because I didn't even know that
the Grammys were given to
tone deaf people like me," Clin
ton said, recalling an off-key
duet she recently performed on
"The Rosie O'Donnell Show."
Canadian chanteuse Dion

won the prestigious album of the
year award for the hit-packed
"Falling Into You." The same
album won for best pop album.
Music's top awards ceremony
was moved to the Garden this
year and, for the first time,
members of the public were
admitted to see the televised
portion of the 39th annual show.
With three awards last night,
the Beatles nearly doubled their
lifetime haul of Grammys. They
won for best pop performance
by a duo or group for "Free As a
Bird," the song manufactured
by the three surviving members
from a tape left behind by the
late John Lennon.
They also won two video
awards for "Free As a Bird" and
their anthology project. During
their peak in the 19605, the
Beatles won only four Grammy
awards.
Beck augured a changing of
the guard for rock music, beat
ing out veterans Bruce Spring
steen, Bryan Adams, Clapton
and John Hiatt for an award for
his surrealistic "Where It's At."
He also won for best alternative
music performance.
Braxton won best female pop
performance and best female
rhythm and blues performance
for two different songs: "Un
break My Heart" and "You're
Makin' Me High."
