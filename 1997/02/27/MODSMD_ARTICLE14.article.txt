# Clinton defends fund-raising moves

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton
defended White House fund-raising tactics as
"entirely appropriate" yesterday, asserting
there was never any illegal solicitation of
money at the executive mansion and "no price
tag on the events."
A day after the disclosure of documents
putting Clinton at the center of all-out fund
raising efforts, the president readily acknowl
edged he had hoped that White House coffees
and other meetings with potential donors
would result in contributions.
"Of course we did," the president said.
However, he said there was no fund raising at
the events themselves. Fund raising on feder
al property is illegal.
Clinton was peppered with questions about
campaign money during a joint news confer
ence with President Eduardo Frei of Chile,

who was making a state visit to the White
House. Despite substantial interest in that
visit, White House officials resigned them
selves to more intense media attention on the
president's enthusiastic efforts to bring in
campaign contributions.
The president refused to endorse biparti
san calls for an independent counsel to inves
tigate fund-raising questions. "That is a deci
sion for the attorney general to make. It
should not be a political decision," Clinton
said.
Attorney General Janet Reno, during an
appearance on Capitol Hill, said she had "not
received evidence that under the law would
justify the appointment of an independent
counsel. But as we proceed with the very com
prehensive investigation that we now have
under way, should there be a basis for the

independent counsel, I will request it."
Among hundreds of documents released
Tuesday, one memo showed that Clinton him
self endorsed rewards — including overnight
stays in the Lincoln and Queen's bedrooms —
for top donors. "Ready to start overnights
right away," Clinton wrote, instructing aides
to assemble names of donors who gave
$50,000 and $100,000.
In all, 938 guests stayed at the White
House during Clinton's first four years in
office.
"The vast majority, I think almost seven
eighths of them, are people that I had rela
tionships with that were independent of my
campaign for president in '92," Clinton said.
"But some people did come and stay with me
who helped me, and I think that's entirely
appropriate."
