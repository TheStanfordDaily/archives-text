# Baseball to honor Jackie Robinson

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Baseball dedicated its
1997 season to Jackie Robinson on yesterday
and will donate $1 million to the foundation
established in honor of the player who broke
the sport's color barrier 50 years ago.
"It was baseball's proudest moment then.
It's still baseball's proudest moment, and I
believe it will always be baseball's proudest
moment," acting commissioner Bud Selig
said. "Should it have come earlier? Certainly.
There never should have been a barrier."
At a news conference attended by Robin
son's widow, Rachel, Selig said all players and
umpires will wear "Breaking Barriers" arm
patches this season, all teams will use com
memorative balls in their home openers, and
100,000 gold and 200,000 silver commemora
tive coins will be sold by the U.S. Mint.
"The residue of racism is still with us and

the struggle is still on," Rachel Robinson said.
"We need to have a vision and we need to have
a plan."
When Robinson made his big-league debut
for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947,
he became the first black in the major leagues
since Moses Fleetwood Walker of Toledo in
the American Association in 1884.
President Clinton said Tuesday he will
attend ceremonies at Shea Stadium on April
15 to mark the anniversary and will speak
from the field during the game between the
Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets.
"The Robinson challenge was not just to
the pitcher but to society as a whole," said
National League president Len Coleman, the
chairman of the Jackie Robinson Foundation,
which funds college scholarships.
"He was my hero, my champion. He carried

my every hope and aspiration on his shoul
ders," Coleman said.
Selig said baseball will make a renewed
effort to increase minority hiring, asking each
team to establish goals and promising to mon
itor their progress.
"Jack was impatient for change and right
fully so," Rachel Robinson said. "I think he
would think we have not come far enough."
Robinson spent his career with the
Dodgers, garnering the nickname "Mr. Octo
ber" for his spectacular displays during the
end-of-season playoffs.
At the end of Robinson's rookie season in
1947, he had become National League Rookie
of the Year with 12 homers, a league-leading
29 steals, and a .297 average. In 1949, he was
selected as the N.L. Most Valuable Playe and
won the batting title with a .342 average.
