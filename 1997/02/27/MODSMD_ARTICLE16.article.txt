# Find suggests early hunting
## Newly discovered spears appear to be 400,000 years old

NEW YORK (AP) — Researchers in Germany
have unearthed 400,000-year-old wooden spears
from what appears to be an ancient lakeshore hunt
ing ground — stunning evidence that human ances
tors systematically hunted big game much earlier
than believed.
The three spears, each carved from the trunk of
a spruce tree, are 6 feet to more than 7 feet long.
They were found with more than 10,000 animal
bones, mostly from horses and many obviously
butchered.
That indicates the ancient hunters were orga
nized enough to trap horses and strong enough to
kill them by throwing spears, perhaps ambushing
herds that showed up for a drink.
"There's no question if you are hunting a group
of horses coming along a lake, you must be strong.
You have to plan it, you have to organize it," said
archaeologist Hartmut Thieme, whose crew made
the discovery.
The spears, found as researchers worked one
step ahead of an expanding coal mine, skewer the
idea that the archaic humans at that time depended
on scavenging and foraging, experts said.
"What it's telling us is these people were very
sophisticated, competent hunters," said Robin I)en
nell, a professor of prehistory at the University of
Sheffield in England. "They were perfectly capable
of long-term planning and foresight."
And "they must have been awfully strong, far
stronger than I am. Those spears are longer than I
am."
Hefore the new find, there had been some evi

dence of systematic hunting about 200,000 years
ago. The spears are twice that old. In addition, some
researchers have argued that such hunting didn't
truly begin until about 40,000 years ago.
The discoveries were reported in today's issue of
the journal Nature by Thieme, who works for the
state of Lower Saxony in Germany. He and col
leagues found the spears in 1995 near Schoeningen,
about 60 miles southeast of Hanover. Since the
Nature paper was written, his crew has come across
pieces of a fourth spear.
The spears were obviously made with care. After
chopping down an appropriate tree and stripping
off the bark and branches, the ancient hunters
carved the tip at the base of the trunk, where the
wood is hardest. •
The spears were shaped to be thickest toward
the front with a long tapering tail, like modern
javelins, which suggests they were meant for
throwing rather than jabbing.
After all that work "they're not going to throw it
at a squirrel in a dark night. These people were seri
ous about hunting," said Dennell, who wrote a
Nature commentary on the find.
The hunters were distant ancestors of Nean
derthals called archaic Homo sapiens or Homo hei
delbergensis. They hunted in a cool climate like
central Norway has today, seeking game in a land
scape of large meadows with spruce and birch trees.
Their spears were preserved over the eons
because they were waterlogged, a rare stroke of
luck, noted F. Clark Howell, emeritus professor of
paleoanthropology at UC-Berkeley.
