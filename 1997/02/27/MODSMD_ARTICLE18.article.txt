Bridge building needs
renovation to ensure
effective counseling

AFTER THE 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, the
University began the ardu
ous task of rebuilding its quake
shattered campus. Although the
drawn-out process to return Stan
ford to its former self has been
largely successful, a glaring over
sight in the reconstruction plans
may cost the campus one of its
most important services.
The Bridge, a 24-hour peer
counseling service that has helped
students sort out their problems
for the past 25 years, currently
operates out of a partially con
demned house — a result of the
devastating temblor. However
without some support from the
University — both structurally
and financially — this campus
institution will no longer be able
to do the job it once did.
The Bridge prides itself on its
around-the-clock availability to
students in need of someone to
talk to. Such a service can only be
accomplished through live-in
counselors — experienced volun
teers who reside in the Bridge
facility. They not only answer the
late-night telephone calls from
distressed students, but also act
as advisors to the less experi
enced counselors.
However, the role of the live-in
counselor is in jeopardy. At the
end of fall quarter, the second
floor of the Bridge house was con
demned, forcing the two live-in
counselors to relocate downstairs
and share a single room. Accord
ing to senior Joy Chen, a resident
counselor, this situation is far
from ideal because counselors
need their privacy to maintain the
confidentiality of their work.
Without enough space for single
rooms, it is feared that troubled

students might turn away from
the Bridge, worried that their sto
ries will be accidentally shared
with others.
This situation is potentially
tragic, but unfortunately for the
Bridge and the people it helps, the
University does not seem to agree.
Although the administration
has openly praised the Bridge's
work, it has failed to give any con
crete plans for rehousing the
counseling service. An office in
Tresidder Union was offered, but
such accommodations do not lend
themselves well to residence
based counseling. The University
needs to take a more active posi
tion regarding the Bridge because
sadly enough the Bridge does not
have the resources to take care of
itself.
As a student organization regis
tered with the Office of Student
Activities, the Bridge is prohibited
from soliciting funds from individ
ual donors; rather, it must work
through the Stanford Fund. While
this way of fund-raising can offer
some financial relief, it cannot pro
vide the $250,000 needed to reno
vate the building. In fact, all of the
Bridge's operations are funded
through the Spring Faire in White
Plaza, which the Bridge runs.
Considering the dire condition
of the Bridge's facilities, the OSA
should temporarily allow the
Bridge to actively solicit alumni
in order to raise the necessary
funding.
But moreover, because the
Bridge house is University-owned,
the University has a direct
responsibility to maintain the
quality of the facility. The Bridge
is not a classroom building or a
library, but as a building that sup
ports the activities and life of
Stanford students, it is essential.
The University must recognize
this significance and plan for its
renovation and seismic
retrofitting as it has done with
virtually every other building on
campus. The future of the coun
seling at Stanford depends on it.
