# Interest in grape boycott sinks
## Current student apathy marks strong contrast to activism last year 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Stanford's great grape debate is silently fad
ing away.
Three years ago, a ban on grapes was includ
ed in the demands of four students on a hunger
strike. Last year, following a University Grape
Policy Committee recommendation that indi
vidual residences be allowed to decide whether
or not to serve the fruit in their dining halls,
boycott votes were held across campus.
Many residence halls sponsored forums and
panel discussions on the issue, and ultimately,
students voted to ban grapes in all but two din
ing halls — Manzanita and Ricker.

This year, however, a cloud of apathy seems
to have fallen over the debate.
Several residences have not yet voted on
whether or not to boycott grapes this year, and
Residential Education is just beginning to col
lect vote tallies this week. This trend is in direct
contrast to a provision in the residential assis
tant handbook that instructs these votes to
take place no later than the end of fall quarter.
Reasons vary as to why few votes have taken
place. In Branner Hall, the issue has been con
tinually postponed due to a desire on behalf of
the dormitory's resident assistantss to first ed
ucate their residents on the issue.
The dorm staff plans to invite experts on the
issue to speak during dinner sometime next

week before a vote is taken, according to senior
Callista Chen, a Branner RA.
In East Florence Moore Hall, no vote was
taken because of a perceived lack of interest
among students. Junior Kristen Ho, an RAin
Alondra, said the grape issue was raised among
students at a fall quarter house meeting, but
"there didn't seem to be a lot of interest."
The dorm members were content to stick to
the standing policy that prohibits grapes in the
dining hall, she said. "We haven't seen enough
interest in anyone here to change it."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga
has also noticed a change in the demands for
information on the subject. A res
ident fellow who spearheaded the
original Grape Policy Committee,
Fraga said only one dorm has
asked him to speak this year in
regard to the issue, although he
declined to speculate on why that
is.

Last year, Fraga served on nu
merous panels that made presen
tations at various residences.
Supporters of the grape boycott
say they are protesting unfair
labor practices in the California
agricultural community, specifi
cally when dealing with migrant
workers. The United Farm Work
ers have been boycotting the sale
of the fruit since 1984.
Fraga said he is still willing to
speak to students about the issue.
