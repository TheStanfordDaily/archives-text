I'M SURE YOU'VE heard about
Dolly by now, the Scottish sheep
that's the first mammal to be genet
ically cloned by scientists. Not since
Babe has a farm animal caused so much
hubbub. When I first heard the news I
picked up a nearby issue of the San
Francisco Chronicle to get the details.
However, as I read the piece, my
focus was quickly drawn away from the
topic of genetic cloning to a brief blurb
about one third into the article: "The
idea of cloning is so ethically repugnant
that society may never allow people to
run off multiple, identical copies of
themselves on a kind of biological Xerox
machine, ethics experts said."
That's right, ethics experts, if you can
believe that. I've never heard of an ethics
expert before nor had I thought such a
profession existed in the first place.
The Chronicle called these experts
"ethicists." Makes sense right? Physicist.
Biologist. Ethicist. But it all seemed very
peculiar to me. The first thing that
popped into my head was that old column
from Miss Manners. She was an ethicist
in her own right, telling people how
much to tip the waiter and what to wear
to a semi-formal dinner party on the
Upper West Side. I don't think she was
ever asked her opinion on genetic cloning
though. If she was, I'm sure it might
have gone something like this:
Dear Miss Manners: I am a scientist
who has achieved the ability to clone

human beings. What should I do? Sin
cerely, Eager in Edinburgh
Dear Eager: Well, that sets my heart
a-tizzy. Imagine having a copy of Clark
Gable all to myself! Make sure you clone
someone who has a good sense of social
etiquette. He must brush his teeth and
wash his hands after every meal, be tall,
dark and handsome and always say
please and thank you. Someone like
George Hamilton, for example. As long
as there's no threat of chromosomal
damage, I say, "Cheers!"
The notion that a person can some
how achieve the title of ethicist,
enabling him or her to make subjective
judgments about science and technolo
gy, boggled my mind. How do you get
your ethicist degree in the first place?
What kind of career opportunities are
available to you after you graduate from
ethics school? Do you need an ethics
degree to sit on the House Ethics Com
mittee, and if so, does that mean we
have to fire all the Representatives who
are on the committee right now?
I bet those ethicists always win in argu
ments, too. They're the kind of people you
meet at parties who always know what to
say, which drinks you don't mix and how
long you're supposed to wait before you
call that girl whose number you just got. I
had the sudden urge to find one of these
ethicists for myself. After all, there are a
lot of things I've done in my life that I'm
not sure were ethically correct.

Like when an ex-girlfriend of mine
asked me how she looked in a ridicu
lously tight dress and I said, "Great!"
Should I have told her to take the next
size up? Should I have turned around
and run for my life? If only I had an
ethicist on hand for advice.
I also had the urge to become an ethi
cist myself. Imagine the power you'd
have whenever you got into an argu
ment: "Well, which one of us is the ethi
cist here?" I could get away with so
much. I'd just flash my degree (obvious
ly I'd carry a miniaturized copy in my
wallet) and say, "Pro-choice is the cor
rect way to think, so there." Or "I'll teH
you when I've had enough."
The truth is, you don t need an ethica"
degree to be an ethicist. Everyone has
the right to make ethical
whether or not that person is an "ethic«
expert." You may love genetic cloning
and that's fine. In the end, ethical deci-}..
sions are completely subjective, almostf
always open to criticism and never one-&
sided. But the title of "ethicist" doe®* 1
have its perks.
