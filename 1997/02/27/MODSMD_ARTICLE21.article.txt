Aspiring farmer, your dream has been answered

TWO RECENT ARTICLES about
the Stanford Community Farm
have generated a good deal of
interest. For those who are still curious,
there remains some clarification.
What does "biointensive" mean?
Biointensive is an alternative approach
to food production which stresses sus
tainability. Biointensive is one of many
techniques that falls under the larger
umbrella of agroecology (loosely defined
as an ecosystems approach to agricul
ture, emphasizing the natural interrela
tionships among soils, crops, insects,
plant diseases and other components of
agricultural systems).
Biointensive farming draws concepts
from and derives its name from biody
namic farming (which stresses sustain
ability) and French intensive farming
(which stresses high productivity per
unit of area). Biointensive rests on five
basic priniciples: deep soil preparation,

close plant spacing (as in nature), pro
duction and use of compost, synergistic
companion planting (e.g., corn and
beans) and biological pest control.
While biointensive systems tend to be
organic and tend to use labor-intensive
methods, these are by no means their
defining factors; agroecological systems
do not lend themselves to chemical
dependency and mechanization. The
farm aims to realize the numerous ben
efits of organic farming and demon
strate an accessible form of agriculture
by de-emphasizing mechanization. The
farm will be powered by sunshine. In
addition, labor-intensive does not neces
sarily imply practices that are over
whelmingly laborious — simply prac
tices which rely on human power.
Where is the farm located? The
farm site is located behind the Environ
mental Health and Safety facility, near
the intersection of Searsville Road and

Stockfarm Road on West Campus
Drive. If you can get to the tennis
courts or horse stables that face the
Suites, you can get to the bike path
that runs from Campus Drive to Sand
Hill Road. Going toward Sand Hill
Road, the site is on your right side.
Who can work at the farm? Any
one and everyone. Any member of the
community is encouraged to come out to
the site. There is a wide range of neces
sary activities, from bed preparation to
weeding, from tree planting to small
scale construction, requiring varying
degrees of physical exertion and and con
centration. If you have no farming expe
rience, we can train you. If you burn
easily, we will provide and apply the sun
tan lotion. We encourage students who
have tired of Walkman-dependent jog
ging, aerobizing and stair-mastering.
There are no stairs at the farm site.
There are only a few activities I can

think of which offer the same sort of
social, full-body workout as farming. It
is aerobic, builds strength and rejuve
nates the body, mind and spirit.
How to get involved? You can sub
scribe to the farm mailing list (commu
nity-farm@lists), by sending a message
to majordomo@lists which reads "sub
scribe community-farm." This list will
post times when groups will be at the
site, schedules for training sessions and
other helpful information. Alternatively,
you can stop by the farm. There is gen
erally someone at the site during day
light hours each day. Within the next
week, there will be a job board at the site
which outlines what needs to be done on
a daily basis. Seed, tools and other
equipment will be available at the site so
that people may work at times which are
convenient for them.
