# Taiwanese community of the present depends on acknowledging the past
## 
### 
Fifty years ago today, a widowed
vendor in Round Park, Taipei,
.'was mercilessly pistol-whipped to death
•for resisting attempts by Monopoly
!Bureau agents to confiscate her smug
gled cigarettes. Bystanders were out
•Jviged, and within hours word had
>prcad like fire across the city. The fol
lowing day, Feb. 28, 1947, crowds flood
ed the streets in protest against the cor
rupt and violent rule of the Nationalists,
■and rebellions soon erupted throughout
v l <iwan. By 6 that evening, martial law
>vns declared on the island.
This event, known as "the 228 Inci
dent," has become a symbol for a Tai
wanese identity which had been system

atically repressed during four decades of
authoritarian rule. During these 40
years, the 228 Incident disappeared into
the silent blackness of political taboo.
Since the Kuomintang Party (KMT) fled
to Taiwan during the civil war with the
Communists on mainland China, Tai
wanese people were denied a legitimate
right to their identity and history.
With the lifting of martial law in 1987
and the ensuing democratization, the
experience of the Taiwanese people was
finally acknowledged. In 1992, President
Lee Teng-hui officially admitted to the
KMT army's killing of an estimated
18,000 to 28,000 native-born Taiwanese
in the 228 Incident and during the follow
ing four decades of KMT rule on Taiwan.
Acknowledgment of the incident is a
first move toward the recognition of a
Taiwanese history and identity which
belongs to the people of Taiwan. The
significance and need for the emergence
of a strong Taiwanese identity cannot

be underestimated, for it has proven to
be a central issue for Taiwan's contin
ued social development and democrati
zation. With this understanding, Tai
wanese communities throughout the
world are gathering to commemorate
this day in order to pay respect to their
collective memories.
It is particularly important that our
generation becomes increasingly aware
of a Taiwanese history, for this is
where the Taiwanese identity finds its
roots. With political liberalization, the
space to discuss and understand this
past is being created day by day. For
people of our grandparents' or parents'
generation, it is incredible to finally be
allowed to speak honestly and openly
about their personal past.
Our generation, however, has very
few, if any, personal memories of this
Taiwanese past, nor does it have the
memory of an official, academic Tai
wanese history. The challenge for the

Taiwanese community is to hold the
delicate pieces of experiences such as
the 228 Incident in our hands and
share this among generations and with
the international community. Only by
actively creating this awareness will
Taiwan as a democratic state be able to
peacefully come together as a Tai
wanese community.
In acknowledgment of the emotional
and historical significance of the 228 Inci
dent, the Taiwan Legislature has just
declared Feb. 28 as a day for national
commemoration. Tomorrow will be the
first time in history Taiwanese people
have had the chance to come together as
a nation and openly acknowledge their
past. Out of our respect for the history
and identity of the people of Taiwan, we
will be commemorating the victims of
the 228 Incident tonight at the Asian
American Activities Center at 8.
