# Rachel Kolman Marshak: I'm a jelly doughnut
## Memories of hatred do not go gently into the night 
### 
( rpHEY NEVER TOLD us the rea
sons why it happened," Anja, my
-L. language partner, said to me in
German, the language of the Nazis.
She had been telling me about how her
former language partner, another Stan
ford student, had gone to Auschwitz the
quarter before, ending up on a train with
prostitutes and creepy-looking people.
I asked her if they learned about the
Holocaust in school. Again and again,
she said, starting in elementary school.
They had learned about it all. I got the
feeling that Anja knew more about the
Holocaust than I did.
But they never learned the reasons,
she emphasized again. She told me
about the big fuss concerning the recent
publication of Daniel Jonah Goldha
gen's book, "Hitler's Willing Execution
ers." There had been a big public debate,
with many TV programs about it. I
asked what she thought. She hadn't
read the book, she said.
At the time, Anja didn't know I was
Jewish. At least I hadn't told her. Maybe
she could tell, like the Jews for Jesus guy
who hassled me on campus last year, but
I'm not sure.

Later that night I told her. We were
talking about silverware and I couldn't
remember how to say fork or knife in Ger
man. I asked her how to say the words in
German, adding that I always forgot
because they were some of the only words
I knew in Hebrew. I'm Jewish, I said, try
ing to pass it off as an afterthought. Anja
told me the words, Gabel and Messer, and
didn't comment on the other part.
Anja is the only German I have told that
I am Jewish. Last week, an article in the
International Herald Tribune discussed
how the ghosts of World War II refused to
die. It mentioned the Swiss gold issue and
Madeleine Albright's family background.
But there's more. French critics of a
proposed immigration law have likened its
provisions to regulations about Jews in
Vichy France. The German government is
calling Scientology a totalitarian cult,
while prominent Hollywood artists are
likening the government's actions against
the Scientologists to those of the Nazis.
Everywhere, the images are invoked.
The past is not dead to me either.
Sometimes, when I sit on the bus or the
subway, I look at the older people and won
der if they were Nazis, if they would have

killed me. At some level, this is very unfair.
After all, the American concept of justice
teaches that people should be presumed
innocent. But I can't help it.
In Germany, I am also less open about
my Jewish identity. At home, I don't even
think about it if I mention that I am Jew
ish, but here, I am very aware of it. That's
why Anja is the only person I have told.
When I was in high school I spent a week
with a German family who lived on an
island in the North Sea. I brought a photo
album to give to the family, full of pictures
of my life. Some of the pictures were from
my confirmation. My German wasn't that
good and I struggled to explain what this
event was. Eventually, they figured out
that they were pictures of my confirmation.
They knew what that was. Yet what they
didn't understand was that it wasn't a
Christian confirmation but a Jewish one.
At the time, I told myself that I didn't
explain further because of my poor Ger
man skills, but there were other reasons.
To some extent, my restraint is caused
by a fear of being treated differently. For
instance, I notice the special looks my eco
nomics professor (a German) gave me
when we talked about neo-Nazi marches in

Germany or the way he seized upon a ran
dom comment I made about the National
Front in France. I haven't told him that I
am Jewish, but I think he suspects it from
statements I have made in class.
But it is also a fear of anti-Semitism
that makes me guarded about my identi
ty. Last weekend, neo-Nazis had a rally in
a train station in Berlin. It was also
recently revealed that a village outside of
Berlin paid two neo-Nazis to burn a pro
posed housing development for foreign
ers. The hatred is still there, just better
concealed.
So I am left with a dilemma â€” to never
forget but, at the same time, to move on.
My grandparents won't go to Germany,
but that seems ridiculous to me. Afler all,
as the Balkans mess shows, holding
grudges for 600 years is not a good idea.
So what do I do? I haven't quite figured
that out. Mostly, I muddle through, trying
not to rock the boat. But the one thing that
I do know is the dilemma is more real than
I imagined it to be.
Last quarter, before I left to go to
Berlin, I had a conversation with a friend
on this subject. We were sitting in one of
those interchangeable Chinese buffet

restaurants which dot downtown Wash
ington, D.C., where we both had been
interning. He questioned me about my liv
ing situation in Berlin.
"Did you ask for a Jewish family?"
Richie inquired.
"A Jewish family?" I chuckled. "No, I
asked for a non-smoking family."
"But what about... ." He didn't fin
ish. He didn't have to. I knew what he
meant. What about the Holocaust? What
if the year had been 1937 instead of
1997? I certainly would not have been
welcomed with open arms.
I didn't answer. I didn't think it was
that big of a problem. And now, three
months later, as I sit in my room in
Dahlem, a community full of houses built
by wealthy Jews who either left or were
killed by the Nazis, I think about how right
Richie was. The past is not as dead as I
once thought.
Rachel Kolman Marshall, a junior major
ing in political science, is spending this
quarter at Stanford in Berlin.
