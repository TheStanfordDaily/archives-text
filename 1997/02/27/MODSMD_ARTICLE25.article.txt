The first issue of Stanford
Masque Magazine — a campus
publication that celebrates the les
bian, gay, bisexual and transgen
dered communities at Stanford —
is due out this Friday.
An exposition of bold and explic
it prose, poetry and artwork, the
magazine will be released at the an
nual Genderfunk dance sponsored
by the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center.
"I was shocked when I came to
this campus and saw that there
was no magazine devoted to queer
issues," said sophomore Manoella
Gonzalez, the chief editor of
Masque. "Stanford University is
one of the leading centers for high
er learning in America. The artis
tic community here is incredibly
talented, yet there wasn't a forum
which specifically met the needs
and interests of a significant part
of talent — namely the queer-iden
tified and queer-allied popula
tion."
To bring her idea to fruition,
Gonzalez decided to enlist the sup
port of members of the Stanford
queer community and received an
overwhelmingly enthusiastic re
sponse.
For the past four months, she
and several other Masque editors
have been working on the first edi
tion which they believe will pave
the path for a "new paradigm" in
literary magazines. "We wanted
the first issue to send an impor
tant message about our underly
ing philosophy — that a literary
magazine can convey as much
meaning through the underlying
form, texture and function of its

visual presentation as it does
through the poetry and prose
within," said visual art editor Rene
Zermeno, a junior.
Gonzalez described the name of
the magazine as having dual con
notations. "When you see the word
"masque," you think of the word
mask. All people wear masks, no
matter where they are; different
masks for different situations. The
title of the magazine also alludes to
the Renaissance masquerades,
where people of all talents came to
perform. Masque magazine simi
larly seeks to invite students with
all talents to contribute."
The first issue of the magazine
features risque lesbian imagery
framed in bright orange colors.
The photographs inside range
from incandescent shots of Jesus
Christ to two-page spreads of bare
white buttocks.
"Our ambition is to continue to
explore this art form and the ways
it can be used to share our vision
with others," said Jessica DuLong,
a contributing writer for the mag
azine. "Masque will hopefully
grow to fill a gap inartistic expres
sion from the queer ... communi
ties."
The prose and poetry found in
the magazine is also very vivid, as
demonstrated by the following ex
cerpt from"I Am A Multicolored
Bottle" by Sassa Kitka:
"I am a multicolored bottle
formed of unknown substance,
what is contained inside i know to
be dark and acidic, it eats away at
me. i open up, raw in places, the
contrast between what is allowed
to ooze out and my own feathery
construction striking, i am living
lace."
