### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
More than two years after the
beginning of a partnership with
Cambridge University Press,
Stanford University Press is gain
ing great benefits from the
arrangement, according to Stan
ford University Press Director
Norris Pope.
"It follows the old saying that
two heads are better than one,"
said Catherine Flack, editor of
Cambridge University Press's
physical sciences division at Stan
ford. "Cambridge is a much bigger
publisher with more resources
available to us."
Under the terms of the agree
ment begun in July 1993, Cam
bridge is associated with Stanford
University Press in several ways.
Cambridge distributes Stanford's
books outside of North America
and maintains a science editorial
office on the Stanford campus. In
addition, a collaborative Stanford-
Cambridge Program was institut
ed, which publishes texts in the
hard sciences.
The agreement "has made us
far more effective throughout the
world," said Pope. "It has been
highly beneficial for our authors
who rightly expect a global audi
ence for their work."

The program has also in
creased Stanford University
Press's strength in the hard sci
ences, according to Pope.
Additionally, under a new
agreement negotiated last spring,
Cambridge University Press will
take on all distribution functions
for Stanford University Press be
ginning May 1.
The decision to outsource
Stanford University Press was
prompted by the University's de
cision to close the press's distribu
tion center on campus.
"This is a major step which will
have more impact," said Flack.
"The economics make it difficult
[for Stanford] to sustain distribu
tion and warehousing."
Pope said the move will not af
fect Stanford's traditional pub
lishing strengths in areas such as
Asian studies, literary and cultur
al theory and the humanities.
"It shouldn't affect the pub
lishing program," said Pope. "The
effects are on the staff."
Stanford University Press will
be forced to lay off 11 of its 30
workers as a result of the change.
Currently, Stanford Universi
ty Press publishes books from au
thors both inside and outside the
Stanford community and pro
duced 105 books last year, accord
ing to Pope.
