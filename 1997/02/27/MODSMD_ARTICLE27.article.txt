## Scott remains hungry for a title Pac-10's most improved player does damage in the paint 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Take a few minutes to watch the Stanford
women's basketball team, and there are several
things you'll notice. One of the first is probably
junior Olympia Scott. The team's 6-foot-2 start
ing center has a definite presence and a notable
court manner.
At sold out games she can be heard over the
roar of the crowd as she goes up for the rebound,
letting out a yell and bringing down the ball and
anything else that gets in her way. She blocks
shots with oomph, weaves through the paint with
the intensity of a locomotive and gets in the face
of any opponent dumb enough to pick up her
dribble. Watch closely on the jump ball and you'll
even spot the junior giving her opponent a quick
forearm — often right to the neck — on the way
up.
Scott's not malicious; she's just tough — men
tally, emotionally and physically. The team's
leading rebounder (7.7) and second-leading scor
er (16.4) exudes quiet confidence off the court
and loud aggressiveness on the court in a fashion
that has made her one of the leaders of the
nation's third-ranked team.
"She's a hard worker," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "She competes in practice every
day. She's really steady, very coachable. I call her
'the warrior.' [With Olympia] you've got a great
foundation mentally."
Indeed, it is just that mentality that's kept
Scott ahead of her peers on the court. Unlike
most Division I college players, Scott hasn't been
dribbling a basketball since she could walk. In
fact she only began playing organized hoops in
the ninth grade. As a result, her fundamental
skills were not up to par with the other players,
so her emotional toughness and desire to win
made up the difference.
"So much of the game is mental," Scott said.
"With anything you have to have more confi
dence than the next person. You can have all the
factors, every physical attribute, but if you're not
emotionally ready, if you're not more aggressive,
if you're not intimidating — I just had the desire
to win.
Scott said she's always been a take-charge per
son, and even as early as the sixth grade, a teach
er said she was "a leader of her class." Scott
attributes her parents with teaching those quali
ties, especially her mother, Jacqueline, whom she
describes as outgoing. Coupled with her own per
sonality, Scott developed into a natural leader on

Despite a late start in hoops, junior center Oiympia Scott is right at home on the
Maples Pavilion hardwood.
