## Scott remains hungry for a title Pac-10's most improved player does damage in the paint 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Take a few minutes to watch the Stanford
women's basketball team, and there are several
things you'll notice. One of the first is probably
junior Olympia Scott. The team's 6-foot-2 start
ing center has a definite presence and a notable
court manner.
At sold out games she can be heard over the
roar of the crowd as she goes up for the rebound,
letting out a yell and bringing down the ball and
anything else that gets in her way. She blocks
shots with oomph, weaves through the paint with
the intensity of a locomotive and gets in the face
of any opponent dumb enough to pick up her
dribble. Watch closely on the jump ball and you'll
even spot the junior giving her opponent a quick
forearm — often right to the neck — on the way
up.
Scott's not malicious; she's just tough — men
tally, emotionally and physically. The team's
leading rebounder (7.7) and second-leading scor
er (16.4) exudes quiet confidence off the court
and loud aggressiveness on the court in a fashion
that has made her one of the leaders of the
nation's third-ranked team.
"She's a hard worker," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "She competes in practice every
day. She's really steady, very coachable. I call her
'the warrior.' [With Olympia] you've got a great
foundation mentally."
Indeed, it is just that mentality that's kept
Scott ahead of her peers on the court. Unlike
most Division I college players, Scott hasn't been
dribbling a basketball since she could walk. In
fact she only began playing organized hoops in
the ninth grade. As a result, her fundamental
skills were not up to par with the other players,
so her emotional toughness and desire to win
made up the difference.
"So much of the game is mental," Scott said.
"With anything you have to have more confi
dence than the next person. You can have all the
factors, every physical attribute, but if you're not
emotionally ready, if you're not more aggressive,
if you're not intimidating — I just had the desire
to win.
Scott said she's always been a take-charge per
son, and even as early as the sixth grade, a teach
er said she was "a leader of her class." Scott
attributes her parents with teaching those quali
ties, especially her mother, Jacqueline, whom she
describes as outgoing. Coupled with her own per
sonality, Scott developed into a natural leader on

the court.
"I've been a leader on most
teams," Scott said. "I think some
people have different roles in life.
In general some people are more
nurturing, some are followers. I
tend to be more of a leader, so I
feel like as a leader of the team I
need to be an offensive threat, a
defensive threat, a rebounder, a
good passer, just everything. We
are looking as a team to improve
collectively, and that's basically

Tara's motto."
Her strong emotional founda
tion and late start in the sport
tend to explain Scott's continued
improvement here at Stanford.
Her numbers reflect that; coming
into the 1996-97 season Scott's
career field goal percentage was
under 50 percent and her free
throw mark was 62 percent. But
this year Scott has come alive,
and most consider her to be the
Pacific 10 Conference's most
improved player. Scott is shoot
ing better than 55 percent from
the field, a team best, and is up to
70 percent from the charity
stripe, not to mention leading the

team with 7.7 rebounds per game
— almost three more per contest
than last season.
"Every night Olympia is
there," VanDerveer said. "Her
consistency has been important.
She brings great energy to the
team and plays extremely hard.
She gets knucklehead fouls I call
them, but she's someone you
want in your foxhole. Whatever
she puts her mind to, look out."
Her numbers aren't all that
are high this season. Scott has
lofty expectations for herself and
her team, and as the Card gears
up for the NCAA tournament,
Scott is ever mindful of the

impact she hopes to make on her
sport.
"I'm interested in hopefully
playing for the Olympic team and
living out the prophecy of my
name," Scott said. "Especially
with the professional leagues, it's
so much deeper than just [mak
ing money]. So many qualities in
people that we call masculine are
really human qualities that we
just say, 'OK, aggressiveness is
masculine so you need to be more
demure and quiet.'
"All these things we really
take for granted and want to pre
tend aren't really sex roles in
society but they really are. It's

just an acceptance of women in
our full realm. We can be quiet
and ladylike and feminine, but at
the same time we can be aggres
sive and ready to go and mean
and have a killer instinct and be
ready to put everything on the
line too. I just want to help usher
that movement."
One movement Scott has defi
nitely been a part of is the strong
performance of Stanford's inside
game. With the numerous
injuries the Cardinal has suffered
this season, especially at the post
position, Scott has been called
upon to step up her game and
become one of the team's most

consistent players. Now with the
postseason looming on the near
horizon, Scott and company have
turned their focus on the nation
al championship.
"I really feel like we not onfy
have all the physical attributes,
we have the emotional," Scott
said. "I think we're ready. We're
constantly working to improve,
and I just think so much hard
work has gone into it I don't
think anyone on our team would
want it to be that emotionally we
weren't ready. I think we can
really win it all. I hope we do. I
really, really want to win it. I
think we're really within reach "
