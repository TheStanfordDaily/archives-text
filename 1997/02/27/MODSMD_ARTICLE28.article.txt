# He's not the man
## Montgomery should shoulder some blame 
### 
It's no big secret that the Cardi
nal men's basketball team has
had a very frustrating season
thus far. Many people predicted a
Pacific 10 Conference crown for
Stanford but instead are now
guessing whether or not the Cardi
nal will make the

tournament.
What has been a secret for the
entire year is the reason the Cardi
nal have fallen on hard times —
some have blamed the troubles on
senior point guard Brevin Knight,
who has pressed too much in his
last few games, while others have
faulted redshirt sophomore center
fim Young and his back problems
for giving the Cardinal no presence
ih the middle.
; However, one person has con
sistently escaped the criticism and
managed to shirk the responsibili
ty. He has lived off his reputation
this year and settled for mediocrity
from a potential top-10 squad. And
he has failed to make the changes
necessary to win the tight games,
especially on the road.
I speak, of course, of Mike
Montgomery, the Cardinal's head
<Joach, who over the past 10 sea
sons at Stanford has gained a repu
tation for being a great motivator
and coach — someone who gets the

most out of his players.
For a while, I thought Mont
gomery was worthy of that reputa
tion, having guided the Cardinal to
the postseason every year I have
been at Stanford. This year,
though, I became skeptical early in
the season, as Stanford had trouble
with teams like San Diego and
Seton Hall. I remained silent,
though, giving one of the "deans of
the Pac-10" the benefit of the
doubt.
However, as I watch Stanford
continue to stumble its way to the
tournament, I can remain silent no
longer — it is time for coach Mont
gomery to shoulder some of the
burden and hopefully realize,
before it is too late, what it will
take to win the last three regular
season games.
I certainly do not profess to
know everything about basketball,
but there are a few aspects of the
Cardinal's season that have com
pletely perplexed me. Thus, in no
particular order, are some of the
most frustrating choices Mont
gomery has made:
1. Montgomery has always
insisted on playing man-to-man
defense, just like the Dukes and
Indianas of the world. The only
problem is that Stanford has con
sistently shown an inability to stay
in tight man-to-man defense with
very athletic teams.
Yes, the Cardinal did beat UCLA
at home by 48 points, mainly
because Stanford couldn't miss
from three-point land. However,
without that shooting, the squad
was helpless in Pauley Pavilion.
