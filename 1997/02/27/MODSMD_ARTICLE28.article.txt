# He's not the man
## Montgomery should shoulder some blame 
### 
It's no big secret that the Cardi
nal men's basketball team has
had a very frustrating season
thus far. Many people predicted a
Pacific 10 Conference crown for
Stanford but instead are now
guessing whether or not the Cardi
nal will make the

tournament.
What has been a secret for the
entire year is the reason the Cardi
nal have fallen on hard times —
some have blamed the troubles on
senior point guard Brevin Knight,
who has pressed too much in his
last few games, while others have
faulted redshirt sophomore center
fim Young and his back problems
for giving the Cardinal no presence
ih the middle.
; However, one person has con
sistently escaped the criticism and
managed to shirk the responsibili
ty. He has lived off his reputation
this year and settled for mediocrity
from a potential top-10 squad. And
he has failed to make the changes
necessary to win the tight games,
especially on the road.
I speak, of course, of Mike
Montgomery, the Cardinal's head
<Joach, who over the past 10 sea
sons at Stanford has gained a repu
tation for being a great motivator
and coach — someone who gets the

most out of his players.
For a while, I thought Mont
gomery was worthy of that reputa
tion, having guided the Cardinal to
the postseason every year I have
been at Stanford. This year,
though, I became skeptical early in
the season, as Stanford had trouble
with teams like San Diego and
Seton Hall. I remained silent,
though, giving one of the "deans of
the Pac-10" the benefit of the
doubt.
However, as I watch Stanford
continue to stumble its way to the
tournament, I can remain silent no
longer — it is time for coach Mont
gomery to shoulder some of the
burden and hopefully realize,
before it is too late, what it will
take to win the last three regular
season games.
I certainly do not profess to
know everything about basketball,
but there are a few aspects of the
Cardinal's season that have com
pletely perplexed me. Thus, in no
particular order, are some of the
most frustrating choices Mont
gomery has made:
1. Montgomery has always
insisted on playing man-to-man
defense, just like the Dukes and
Indianas of the world. The only
problem is that Stanford has con
sistently shown an inability to stay
in tight man-to-man defense with
very athletic teams.
Yes, the Cardinal did beat UCLA
at home by 48 points, mainly
because Stanford couldn't miss
from three-point land. However,
without that shooting, the squad
was helpless in Pauley Pavilion.
The much quicker Bruins, who still

haven't demonstrated an ability to
shoot the outside shot consistently,
not only individually dominated
every one-on-one matchup, but they
killed Stanford on the boards as well
— and the Cardinal lost badly.
The other reason the man-to
man defense has handicapped the
Cardinal so badly this season
(besides the inability shown by
some players to fight" through
screens), is that it generates foul
trouble for the team. It is beyond
comprehension to me that against
Washington last weekend, with
Young ailing and Mark Madsen
and Pete Van Elswyk in foul trou
ble, Montgomery did not attempt a
zone. Instead of protecting his big
men and collapsing on Todd Mac-
Culloch, he let the Husky run
roughshod over Young, scoring 24
points and pulling down eight
rebounds.
2. I feel like Montgomery has
not handled his personnel very well
this season. First off, I think it is

clear that Madsen, if given enough
playing time, will eventually lead
the Pac-10 in rebounding. Why
then, with Young being completely
ineffective in the post, has Madsen
not gotten more playing time or
even a start over Young. I'd rather
have Madsen's rebounding skills in
the game than Young's offense,
which has been anemic of late.
Secondly, Montgomery doesn't
seem to handle players who are
slumping veiy well. Take sopho
more shooting guard Kris Weems,
for example, who for the middle
part of the season, could not biy a
bucket. While in this slump,
though, Weems continued to play
— and play poorly both on offense
and defense. Why did he continue
to play? Why did freshman forward
Ryan Mendez, one of the best
shooters the Cardinal has, sit on
the bench the whole time?
I know each coach as his own
style, but why reward bad play
with more playing time? Look at
Bob Huggins of Cincinnati, a tough
coach who never fails at an oppor
tunity to get in a player's face.
When his star, Ail-American
Danny Fortson, was playing poor
ly, Huggins took him out of the

starting lineup for a game. And the
result: Fortson has been on a tear
and ready to lead his team to Indi
anapolis.
I know certain players can be
defensive liabilities, but when your
team is shooting barely above 30
percent on the road, put some
shooters in the game. I really
wouldn't mind seeing Mark
Thompson in there, if no one else
can hit from downtown.
3. And for the purposes of this
column, my final complaint is that
Montgomery is too damn oompta
cent after lam tired of hear
ing, *Well,tFe
ing for us tonight," or "It was just
one of those nights."
Those nights may happen occa
sionally, but they shouldn't hap
pen five times in a season, when
the squad loses to Cal, Oregon
State, Washington, College of
Charleston and USC in absolutely
horrific fashion.
No, those nights happen for a
reason. They happen because the
Cardinal offense, which is solely
dependent on the three-point shot,
can't hit the broad side of the barn.
They happen because the Cardinal
team doesn't play good enough

defense to shut down somebocfy
like Carson Cunningham. They
happen becuase the coach can t
make crucual game-time decisions
that could ensure a win.
I can't remember the last time
Montgomery called a timeout in a
key situation, drew up a play and
then watched as it was executed
perfectly for the game-winning
shot.
I certainly do not fault Mont
gomery for everything, nor do I
insist the guy is a complete loss as
a coacbH am merely saying that
great coaches, like Mike KrzyzeWs
ki and Bobby KrugKl, adapt to the
situations they are presented.
They do not simply operate from a
manual and stick to it no matter
what.
The great coaches know their
personnel, know what combina
tions work, know what defenses to
call, know how to get players out of
a slump, know how to elicit that
killer instinct from their players..;
But above all, they win.
