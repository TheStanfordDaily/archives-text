# Wind drops golf to seventh place
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Eagles were nowhere in sight,
and birdies were hard to come by
for the Stanford women's golf
team.
The second-ranked Cardinal
finished seventh after playing 54
holes at the Pioneer Electronic
Bruin Classic. The team posted its
worst team score this season with
a score of 977. The three-round
tournament was held Monday and
Tuesday in Los Angeles.
The winds may have been too
much for the Cardinal and 17
other competing teams, contribut
ing to the unusually high scores.
None of the 93 players finished a
single round at or below the par
72 for the Menefee Lakes Golf
Course. Niina Laitinen, from top
finisher Tulsa, came closest with 2
over par.
"Realistically, par would have
been a 77 or 78," said head coach
Caroline O'Connor.
While the harsh weather condi
tions frustrated all players, the
Cardinal team confidence was
shot from the first round to the
finish.
"We just lost it mentally,"
O'Connor said. "We gave an over
all lackluster performance."
O'Connor plans to rebuild
swing confidence by focusing
intensively on short game. She
hopes the players' stroke averages
will return to the low 70s by the
upcoming four tournaments. The
team has won three tournaments,
including the Rolex Match Play
Championship, since fall season.
The absence of senior Andrea
Baxter, who is ranked third
nationally, also cast a damper on
team confidence. Baxter broke her
wrist in a snowboarding accident
and will be out for a good portion
of the season.
With Baxter out, sophomore
Jenny Pippin, who finished with a
score of 252, stepped up to pro
duce "significant play" in her sec
ond scoring tournament this sea
son, O'Connor said.
Stanford's top remaining play

er Mhairi McKay opened the first
round with a 76, the third lowest
score in the tournament. McKay,
who led the Cardinal with a 241,
tied for 18th place. Third-seeded
freshman Julie Dunn shot 242,
finishing one stroke behind
McKay, in 21st place. Others
include freshman Jae Jean Ro
with a score of 246 and sophomore
Michelle Sperry at 251.
The golfers played two rounds,
or 36 holes, the first day. The
increased traffic on the greens had
a noticeable effect on short play as
the spike marks of players' shoes
made the putting surfaces
rougher and more irregular dur
ing the second round.
"It was really bouncy like going
over a speed bump," Dunn said.
In addition, the 35-mph winds
dried out the course, making it
extremely difficult to read and
judge the speed of the greens. The
winds themselves overshot play
ers' putts by six or seven feet as
well.
The winds were so strong that
at one point, the ball would not
stay still for Dunn to putt.
Dunn spent 10 minutes trying
to line her ball up for a putt dur
ing the third round on the 11th
green. Finally, she let the ball roll
a few inches to the left before
shooting.
"I even had trouble just stand
ing up. I'd stand on the green and
get blown over," said Dunn, who
towers at 5-foot-10.
The cold and windy weather
also served to create inconsisten
cies in the Cardinal's game. While
turtlenecks layered with a shirt
and a sweater helped keep the
players warm, the clothing con
stricted their swing.
Despite posting mediocre
scores, Dunn said the tournament
was not a total loss.
Her parents, who drove five
hours from Las Vegas to watch
the tournament, brought Dunn a
new Trident Golf 3-wood.
"I've been looking for a good
three wood for awhile. It made me
really happy to finally get one,"
she said.
