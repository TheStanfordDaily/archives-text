# Graduate housing
## Dorm named for former president 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
The graduate residence com
plex west of Governor's Corner
will be named the Richard W.
Lyman Graduate Residences in
honor of the seventh University
president.
Lyman, the J.E. Wallace Ster
ling Professor Emeritus of the
Humanities, has been a member
of Stanford's faculty since 1958
and served as president from 1970
until 1980.
The complex's central com
mons building will be named for
Jing Lyman, Richad Lyman's wife
and founder of the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender
at Stanford.
"Dick Lyman is a remarkable
man and the most underappreci
ated president in Stanford's histo
ry," University President Ger
hard Casper said in a statement.
"Perhaps that is because he
shared the limelight with the
bright, energetic and talented
Jing."
Lyman expressed gratitude to
Casper and "his advisers" for the
honor.
"I am really very pleased, espe
cially because they recognized my
wife as well," he said. "She was an
incredible fust lady and certainly
deserves it."
The former president said
Casper had asked him some weeks
ago if he would accept the dedica
tion.
"I have a reputation for being
modest," he joked, "but not so
much that I would decline."

Lyman succeeded Kenneth
Pitzer as Stanford's president.
Pitzer's leadership proved ill
suited for the tumultuous late
19605, when civil unrest and
demonstrations prevailed on col
lege campuses; he left office after
only 19 months.
Lyman inherited a divided cam
pus, a militant student body and a
budget deficit. He, however, re
fused to balk at the task.
In his inaugural address to the
Academic Council, Lyman said
that "we must avoid any tendency
to hunch ourselves down in what
ever shelters we can find and wait
for the storm to pass." The Uni
versity, he said, "must move for
ward."
After a decade in office, Lyman
had moved Stanford well beyond


Richard Lyman
its troubled past.
In the words of one recent pub
lication from the President's Of
fice, at some point during

Lyman's presidency, "probably
while there was still a whiff of tear
gas in the air, Stanford moved into
the world class of universities."
The Lyman complex will house
single graduate students and will
be completed for occupation by
next fall. A formal dedication will
be held in October.
