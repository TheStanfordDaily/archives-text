# Softball seeks ranking with good weekend
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The soflball team hopes to ride the wave
of momentum that started last weekend at
the San Diego State Tournament, where it
placed second. The Cardinal's upcoming
games this weekend include a series at
Sacramento State tomorrow and against
Arizona State at home Sunday.
Stanford (9-8, 0-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
is looking prepared for close games this
weekend. The squad has already played

Sacramento State once, pulling out a 3-2 win
in last weekend's tournament.
"We definitely are expecting a tough game
against Sacramento," said sophomore out
fielder Kelly Yablonski. "Last time we
played against them we needed to make a
late-inning comeback to get the victory, and
this time they have the home field advan
tage."
The games against the Hornets are defi
nitely the ones that the team must win in
order to break into the top-25 rankings. For
the first time this season, the Cardinal

received votes in the USA Today poll.
"We really think that if we can have a
strong weekend performance, we can break
into the rankings," Yablonski said. "There
fore the next four games are really big."
The second doubleheader against Arizona
State will be the Cardinal's second Pac-10
series. The first series was against second
ranked UCLA, where they suffered two close
losses. In Arizona State the Cardinal are fac
ing a worthy opponent but winning the
series is a definite possibility.
The team has already beaten
three ranked teams, including
two last weekend, and Stanford
must continue to do so if it
expects to contend for the Pac-10
championship and receive a spot
in the top 25. A respectable finish
in the Pac-10 basically assures
the Cardinal of a high position
because of the strength of the
field. The conference has five
teams which are in the top 25,
four of which are in the top 10.
But offensively the team has
been erratic. In its first few
games Stanford was a run pro
ducing machine, giving ample
support for sophomore pitchers
Becky Blevins and Marcy
Crouch. But in its series against
Pacific and UCLA, the team as a
whole had a prolonged hitting
slump, being blanked in three of
the four games. The team seems
to have somewhat righted the
ship, producing at least three
runs in five of the seven games
in the San Diego State tourna
ment.
Some individually strong

offensive performances have
been produced by Crouch, who
leads the team with a .391 bat
ting average and tops the Cardi
nal in hits, runs, RBIs, doubles,
triples and home runs. Fresh
man catcher Kellie Wigington
has also shouldered much of the
offensive burden, hitting .294
with nine RBIs.
When the team is on, it seems
that the hits are usually fairly
dispersed among the players.
Even when the Cardinal is shut
down offensively, it is typically
not a complete drought in terms
of hits but rather that the hits
are not put together to produce
any run output.
The pitching duo of Blevins
(5-5, 1.79 ERA) and Crouch (4-3,
2.57) has been strong all year.
Blevins was named Pac-10 pitch
er of the week after she threw a
no-hitter against St. Mary's last
week. Strong defensive support
is key as the only game that the
team lost by more than one run
last weekend was largely due to
errors.
Overall the program has made
leaps and bounds this year and is
poised to make another stride in
the right direction this weekend
and perhaps break into the rank
ings for the first time.
