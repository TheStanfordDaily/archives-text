# Wrestlers wrap it up with Pac-10s in Tempe

### John Sullivan Staff writer 
It all comes down to the Pacif
ic 10 Championships for Stanford
wrestling. Pac-lOs determine
both team and individual final
standings and NCAA qualifiers.
The entire season until now has
been solely in preparation for
Sunday and Monday's competi
tion at Arizona State.
The Pac-10 Championships
allow only one wrestler per
weight class, so during the past
two weeks challenge matches
have taken place to determine
who will wrestle. The lineup for
the Card currently looks to be
freshman Rudy Ruiz at 118
pounds, freshman Zach Zimmer
er at 126 pounds, sophomore
Frank Ruiz at 134 pounds, sopho
more Beau Weiner at 142 pounds
and sophomore B.J. Sanchez at
150 pounds.
The Cardinal rounds out its
lineup with senior Ryan Barnes at
158 pounds, junior Scott Chap
man at 167 pounds, freshman

Tim Kendall at 177 pounds,
senior Bryan Vaniman at 190
pounds and senior Chris Serjak at
heavyweight.
"We're all very excited about
the upcoming weekend," Kendall
said. "We've started to taper, so
we're all beginning to feel the
effects of the hard training we've
put in this winter. I think we have
the ability to surprise some peo
ple at Pac-lOs this year."
Returning to the lineup after
recovering from injuries are two
of the team's captains, Barnes
and Vaniman. Although Barnes
has not wrestled since before
Christmas and is still bothered by
a pinched nerve in his lower back,
he won his two challenge matches
decisively this week and is a hope
ful NCAA qualifier. Coach Chris
Horpel said Vaniman, who just
had a cast removed for his broken
index finger, has "good condition
ing and technique but is definite
ly not 100 percent."
"Since we're a young team, the

tournament will definitely let us
show our character," Sanchez
said. "There are a lot of guys who
are right on the edge. For the
team performance, it's going to
come down to how well we can
respond in the consolation
rounds.
"We all realize this is our last
match of the season, and we will

hopefully get some NCAA quali
fiers."
Chapman remains ranked No.
9 in the nation at his weight and
is likely to be a finalist. Horpel
said other potential finalists are
Zimmerer, who has wrestled par
ticularly well of late, and Weiner,
who has been wrestling consis
tently all season.
Sanchez has performed well
all year and has shown flashes of
brilliance, and Barnes and Vani
man will also contend if they can
avoid aggravating their injuries.

"I feel like we have three to five
guys who are capable of being
finalists," Horpel said. "If we do
poorly, we will have only one or
two finalists, whereas if we do
well, we could get four or five."
In order for the Card to do well
in the team standings, several
excellent performances will be
required. Even several top-four
performances will not give the
Card a shot at the team champi
onship. Stanford would need sev
eral individual champions cou
pled with other solid individual

efforts to bring home the team
crown. X
Although Chapman is the or&
wrestler on paper that is realisti
cally expected to win his weight
class, many wrestlers have shown
the technique and intensity
required to bring home a champi
onship. However, Horpel's out*
look remains modest.
"Right now I would say my
expectations for the team are
somewhat low," Horpel said. "We
are not really in contention to win
the Pac-lOs this vear."
