It all comes down to the Pacif
ic 10 Championships for Stanford
wrestling. Pac-lOs determine
both team and individual final
standings and NCAA qualifiers.
The entire season until now has
been solely in preparation for
Sunday and Monday's competi
tion at Arizona State.
The Pac-10 Championships
allow only one wrestler per
weight class, so during the past
two weeks challenge matches
have taken place to determine

The Cardinal rounds out its
lineup with senior Ryan Barnes at
158 pounds, junior Scott Chap

Tim Kendall at 177 pounds,
senior Bryan Vaniman at 190

heavyweight.

the upcoming weekend," Kendall
said. "We've started to taper, so

effects of the hard training we've
put in this winter. I think we have
the ability to surprise some peo
ple at Pac-lOs this year."
Returning to the lineup after
recovering from injuries are two
of the team's captains, Barnes
and Vaniman. Although Barnes
has not wrestled since before
Christmas and is still bothered by
a pinched nerve in his lower back,
he won his two challenge matches
decisively this week and is a hope
ful NCAA qualifier. Coach Chris
Horpel said Vaniman, who just
had a cast removed for his broken
index finger, has "good condition
ing and technique but is definite
ly not 100 percent."
"Since we're a young team, the
