# Rugby takes No. 2 Aggies by horns
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
The men's rugby team solidified
its standing as one of the top teams
in the nation by defeating second
ranked UC-Davis at Maloney Field
on Monday.
The Cardinal spent the first
three-fourths of the game trading
the lead back and forth with
Davis. The Aggies took a 24-17
lead midway through the second
half when sophomore Stephen
Preonas recovered the ball on the
ensuing kickoff to give the No. 3
Cardinal control of the offense.
The team was able to control the
pace of the game for the rest of the
game and fought back for another
three tries.
With a little more than five min
utes left in the match, junior Dave
Warter scored the try which gave
the Cardinal a 31-24 lead, which
Stanford never relinquished.
Preonas' "recovering the ball
right from the kickofT turned the
game around," said head coach
Franck Boivert. "He also stole a lot
of balls from the opposition."
The rivalry between the two
schools has been very intense
recently. Last year Davis handed
the Cardinal a 13-5 loss in the reg
ular season, but when the two met
in the regional finals of the nation
al championship tournament,
Stanford returned the favor with a
35-18 win.
Davis' high ranking is due in
part to the fact that the Aggies are
returning 14 players from last
year's squad, while the Cardinal
only has four starters back.
Boivert also attributes the vic
tory to the team's ability to finally
execute the basic skills of the
game.
Senior captain "Joe Clayton
had a very important role,"

Boivert said. "He was not shining,
but he did a lot of obscure work
and I'm very proud of him
because in the past he was not
doing that.
"He showed by example. He did
all the nitty-gritty work that is not
flashy, things like tackling and
blocking that have to be done."
The teams fought a seesaw bat
tle throughout most of the game.
The Cardinal took a 10-3 lead on a
try by Warter midway through the
first half only to fall behind 17-10
at the intermission. The squad tied
the score at 17-17 before Davis
scored another try and successful
conversion. After that, the game
was entirely dictated by the Cardi
nal.
With the victory over the
Aggies, the Cardinal can expect to
climb a notch in the national rank
ings to No. 2. The matchup
between Stanford and top-ranked
California on March 9 will virtual
ly decide who carries the No. 1
ranking into the postseason.
The Cardinal will travel to
Humboldt State on Saturday in a
match with little national implica
tions. The Lumberjacks are
nowhere near the level of Davis
and even further from Cal. The
game will basically be used to
refine technical skills in prepara
tion for the Big Game the follow
ing weekend.
The women's match against
Navy on Saturday has been can
celed. Instead, they will face Occi
dental College at 1:15 p.m. on Mal
oney Field.
"Right now I think our team
needs to focus on being clean cut
with our decisions, smart and care
ful," said sophomore Bronwen
Trice. "We have the aggression; we
have the desire. We that portion of
the focus down.
"It's just a matter of putting

our game together and working as
a team and not being sloppy."
The team has been very suc
cessful against smaller schools but
has not been completely competi
tive against more prominent teams

like the University of Victoria. *•
The women will use this week
end's match against the Tigers ibo
perfect their basic skills so that
they can improve their overall exe
cution.
