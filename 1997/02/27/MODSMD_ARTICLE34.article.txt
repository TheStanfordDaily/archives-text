# Women to UCSB
## No. 3 polo may face Cal in tourney 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The women's water polo team
has high hopes for their tourna
ment this weekend at UC-Santa
Barbara. The Cardinal has the
opportunity to play California, and
a victory over the Golden Bears
could launch Stanford into the No.
2 ranking in the nation after only
one full season as a varsity sport.
The Cardinal's opening match
will be on Saturday against Divi
sion 111 Redlands at 12:20 p.m.
The squad's next game will be
later that afternoon against UC-
San Diego. Another Division II
school in the tournament, the Tri
tons were demolished by the Car
dinal 16-1 last weekend.
The Stanford squad hopes that
it will not only come out with two
wins from its games Saturday but
also that the games will be a good
warmup for more challenging
opponents in the later rounds.
"I am expecting easy games on
Saturday, but the games will be
tougher on Sunday," said head
coach Ben Quittner.
The Cardinal will be looking to
build on last weekend's perfor
mance in its season-opener at UC-
San Diego. Stanford finished third
in that tournament with a 4-1
record. The Cardinal is currently
ranked third ranked in the nation
behind UCLA and Cal.
UCLA has been the only team
to beat the Cardinal thus far this

season. That victory came in a
tight match that ended 7-6 in San
Diego. The Bruins went on to win
the tournament last weekend but
will not be in attendance at the
Gauchos' tournament.
Even without UCLA's presence
in Santa Barbara, it will be no cake
walk for the Card because of the
possibility of playing Cal, who lost
in the finals last weekend but
stung UCLA in the early rounds of
the San Diego tourney. The game
against Cal is where the Cardinal
is setting its sights because a victo
ry against the Golden Bears could
displace Cal in the rankings.
"If we want to move up in the
rankings we have to beat Cal,"
Quittner said.
In addition to Cal, Michigan,
UC-Davis, USC, the host Gauchos
will be in attendance along with a
number of Division 111 schools.
So far this season the Cardinal
has been relying on a pair of new
comers to find the net for the
team. Freshman Ellen Estes has
14 goals and freshman Suze Gard
ner has 10 to lead all Card in scor
ing. The squad will need some of
its veterans to step up and put the
ball away if it intends to top Cal.
Defensively the Cardinal have
been led by senior captain Alice
Cathcart, sophomore Nicole Glaz
er and junior Julia Baker.
Stanford is also hoping to get
some quality time from freshman
Alissa Keszler, who has been bat
tling illness thus far this season.
