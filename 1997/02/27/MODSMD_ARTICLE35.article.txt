# Tennis seeks fourth straight title
## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
For these talented young ten
nis players, there is often little
time to relax on the Farm.
Having just returned from five
days in Kentucky at the National
Indoor Championships and then
demolishing San Jose State on
Tuesday, the top-ranked men's
tennis team will take off again.
This time, the Cardinal
embarks upon the 108 th annual
Pacific Coast Doubles Champi
onships in La Jolla, Calif., today
through Sunday.
In the doubles tournament, as
opposed to the traditional dual
match format that the Cardinal
routinely plays, Stanford will take
its top four doubles teams to com
pete in the tournament.
"This should be a great chance
for us to focus on our doubles,"
said head coach Dick Gould. "We
need to work badly on doubles so
hopefully we can get a few good
matches in."
The tournament consists of a
variety of doubles teams, includ
ing pros, juniors and some local
players but also some of the
Card's biggest rivals. UCLA, USC
and Pepperdine will also send
teams to the tournament.
However, the Cardinal has
some outstanding doubles players
which could make for a good out
come in La Jolla. At the top of the
list is junior and All-American

Paul Goldstein, who is the two
time defending champion of the
tournament. His freshman year,
Goldstein captured the title with
teammate Scott Humphries. Last
year, Goldstein teamed up with
Jim Thomas to bring home the
title. Thomas and Goldstein, the
seventh seed last year, did not
drop a set in the entire tourna
ment, breezing past a strong Pep
perdine team of Ross Duncan and
Simon Asplin in the final to take
the title.
"It is a great honor and
achievement for Paul to have his
name on the plaque with the
many other greats who have won
the tournament," Gould said.
If history proves to be any indi
cation, Stanford could fare very
well again. The Card has won the
Pacific Coast Doubles Champi
onships three consecutive times
and clinched the title six of the
past seven years.
Goldstein will team with dou
bles partner Ryan Wolters as the
No. 1 team for the Card. Stanford
will also send its No. 2 team of
freshmen Bob and Mike Bryan,
and the senior-freshman duo of
Grant Elliott and Geoff Abrams
at No. 3.
Juniors Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek, who do not nor
mally start for the Cardinal, will
get some good match play under
their belts in La Jolla as well, fill
ing out the fourth and final posi
tion for the Card in the tourna

ment.
Last year the two competed in
the tournament together as well,
pulling off" a stunning upset when
they defeated Rice's No. 1 team in
three sets before falling to Cali

fornia in the third round.
Stanford will return to the
Farm for its next match against
Pacific 10 Conference foe Oregon;
on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. at Taubfc-
Family Tennis Stadium.
