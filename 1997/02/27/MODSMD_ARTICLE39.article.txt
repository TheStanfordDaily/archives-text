# Class to focus on rock 'n' roll history
## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
A new course will be offered next quarter:
Music 192 D: "Creative Processes in Popular
Music Recording," will focus on a selective histo
ry of rock 'n' roll and may possibly entertain en
rolled students with guest appearances by artists.
The course is a product of efforts made by
Assoc. Music Prof. Chris Chafe, the department's
chair, to make the music major a more viable op
tion for students.
Dan Levitin, the Music 192 D instructor, holds
a doctorate in cognitive science and has worked as
a producer and engineer for more than 75 musi
cal recordings. He has also worked as a musician,
a rock journalist, a music production editor and a
record producer. He has also been awarded four
gold records.
"I guess I felt like I was lucky enough to have
had this amazing experience for almost 15
years," Levitin said.
"I started out playing in bands in smoky
clubs where nobody came to hear me," he said.
"I somehow managed to get to a place in the
business working for Columbia Records where I
got to decide which musicians to sign and
record."
"I've gotten to either record or interview most
of my heroes in music. So I thought I was in a
good position to teach a class like this," he added.
The course will take an in-depth look at the

creation of popular music and critique various
musicians' abilities to capture sincerity and inti
macy in the artificial environment of the record
ing studio. Students will also explore the influ
ence of recording technology on music, Levitin
said.
The majority of class time will be spent listen
ing to music at full volume and discussing it, he
said. Homework assignments will consist of lis
tening to the music of specifically assigned musi
cians who have made important contributions to
rock music and then answering questions about
the selections.
Levitin's list of potential musicians to be cov
ered includes Stevie Wonder, Michelle Shocked,
Aimee Mann, Julia Fordham, The Carpenters,
Lindsay Buckingham, Suzanne Vega, Linda
Ronstadt, Van Halen and Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young. He will focus on eight groups or
artists chosen from his list.
Aside from analyzing these artists' music,
has tentatively arranged for some of the
performers themselves — or someone associated
with them — to come and speak about their work.
"I chose people that I know personally and
whose music I know well, because I can do a bet
ter job of teaching if I am familiar with the person
and the music," he said.
Another consideration in choosing the artists
was their ability to speak intelligently about their
own work.
"The musician must be articulate. ... They

have to know exactly what they are doing and be
able to explain it to someone else," he said.
Finally, Levitin chose artists based on their
contribution to rock music and his assessment of
their lasting impact on the industry.
"You can argue that someone like Joan Os
borne or Jewel may someday make an important
contribution, but it's too early to tell. You need
the perspective of time to evaluate impact. Some
of the musicians that are being studied probably
did their best work 10 or more years ago," he
said.
After working on 75 records, "you begin to
hear things you've never heard before. It allows
you to get inside the head of the musician who
made the record and listen to the things they are
listening for," said Levitin.
He added that he wants to teach people to lis
ten to music in the same way as the musicians
themselves.
"I have done about 150 interviews and learned
a lot by talking to musicians. I want to pass that
on to the class and get them thinking about hear
ing music in a different way," he added.
Levitin taught a similar class at Stanford
five years ago, and enrollment exceeded the
limit. Next quarter's class will be held in Camp
bell Recital Hall, which, according to Levitin, is
the biggest room with the highest quality of
sound.
Sign-ups for the class will be held on March 31;
the course is open to all students.
