# Stranded
## Some returning overseas students are placed in all-freshman dorms 
### Rito Trevino Contributing writer 
Over the past quarter, Joseph Hsieh
has been enjoying life in the close
knit, energetic environment of an

all-freshmen dorm.
The strange thing is, he's not a
freshman.
Hsieh, a junior majoring in chem-

istry, is one of three upperclassmen

who were placed into freshmen dorms
at the beginning of winter quarter. He

lives in Alondra, a dormitory on the east wing of Flo
rence Moore Hall.
"I feel right at home," Hsieh said.
Hseih spent fall quarter at Stanford's overseas pro-

gram in Oxford. When he returned, he drew too low to ob-

tain housing during the waiting list round of winter quarter as
signments.
Instead, he found himself in the walk-on round, which exists
primarily for students with unguaranteed housing. At that
point, he was offered a rather limited list of remaining housing
choices. Two of those were places that he'd lived in before, but

he wanted to try something new.

Flo Mo seemed like a

good choice to
him, so he settled
upon Alondra de
spite the fact that
he'd miss living
with his peers.
During his fresh-

man year, Hsieh didn't live in an all-freshmen dormitory, so the
experience is completely new to him. "It's strange hearing about
things like CIV all over again," he said. "It's doubly bizarre be
cause I'm even older than the dorm's staff members. ''
Nevertheless, Hsieh has blended in quite well with Alondra's
freshman residents.
"When he first got here, he made sure to introduce himself to
everyone in the hallways and at our first house meeting," said
Michelle Lee, a resident assistant at Alondra. "Everyone was ex
cited about receiving him."
Hsieh has participated in a number of house activities during
the quarter. Aside from attending house meetings, he's partici
pated alongwith the other men in his hall in the Valentine's Day
"roll-outs" — a traditional wake-up service — and has become
his hall's proud Wallyball champion.
Hsieh and a few freshmen from the dorm have also created a
group dedicated to the video game Marathon.
In time, the class barrier at Alondra has been broken. Hsieh
said he feels the freshmen have come to think of him as "the new
guy" rather than an "upperclassman in the midst." Of course,
the freshmen sometimes find it useful to consult him about
classes (particularly chemistry), past life at Stanford and his ex
periences at Oxford.
Although he spends a lot of time with his new dormmates,
Hsieh hasn't lost touch with his old friends, who are spread
across the campus. He visits them often, and they spend just as
much time coming to see him in Alondra.
"I make a lot more of an effort to see my friends," Hsieh said.
"Now our times spent together mean more."
Lee has similar feelings about living in Alondra. During her
first year at Stanford, she lived at another freshman dorm.

When ?he saw that her sophomore
year lacked the energy and the bond
ing that she'd experienced before,
she decided to return to an all-fresh
man dorm by becoming a staff mem
ber. She enjoys the comfortable at
mosphere and interaction with
younger students.
Hsieh agreed: "I'm very glad that
I chose to live here."
According to Kathleen Brans
field and Jacqueline Wilson, Stan
ford Housing Services managing
staff, upperclassmen cannot be as
signed to all-freshmen residences
during the spring housing lottery or
quarterly wait list rounds. Fresh
man residences only become an op
tion during the walk-on period.
Even then, upperclassmen are
taken through a brief interviewing
process to ensure that they will be

comfortable living with freshmen
before they sign their housing agree
ments, Wilson said.
Upperclassmen can also choose
to live in an all-freshmen dorm by
becoming a staff member or room
ing with a staff member.
The winter quarter walk-on
round is the time when housing sit
uation can become most unpre
dictable, according to Bransfield and
Wilson. Many students move in
from off-campus programs, while
some fall quarter residents do not
return. When undergraduates are
deferred to the walk-on round, they
do not lose guaranteed housing.
However, the range of available
choices is tightened.
The handful of students who ac
cepted assignments in all-freshmen
dorms for this quarter is of a compa
rable number to past years, Wilson
and Bransfield said. They represent
only a small portion of the students
who went through the winter quar
ter walk-on period.
