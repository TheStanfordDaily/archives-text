Film
FRI • 28
"Frosh"! It's better than Mr. Belvedere.
"Frosh," an acclaimed documentary
about the many and diverse (Stanford
Film Society's phrasing) experiences
of one freshman year of college (Cliff
Notes version: vomit, reinvent sexual
history, do something "really random"
involving turkey) is coming to Branner
Hall. Filmed not too long ago in our
very own Wilbur Hall, "Frosh" is at
once charming, funny and serious.
Much like a Jewish Deke but without
the Cool Water wafting 'round his
presence. Bring your parents! Admis
sion is free. The screening is at 7 p.m.
in the Branner lounge.
FRI • 28
"Fresh"! According to the single exis
tent reference to the film available on
the World Wide Web (according to an
Infoseek search), Fresh is the name of
a kid who swears a lot, deals in co
caine, gets his friends killed, kills his
own dog, plays chess brilliantly and
single-handedly metes out justice to
the local hands in his neighborhood
through sheer cunning. The movie is
set so it is isomorphic to a game of
chess. Introduction and discussion led
by Shannon Jones, resident assistant
in Ujamaa. This is part of Kimball's
celebration of Black Liberation Month.
Admission is free. The screening is at
7 p.m. in the Kimball Lounge.
TUES • 4
"A Clockwork Orange"! The adven
tures of a young man whose principal
interests are rape, ultra-violence and
Beethoven — you've always wanted to
see it on a big screen, now's your
chance. In full, tantalizing color and
mind-numbing sound, Stanley
Kubrick's groundbreaking film will
"blow your mind." Bring your parents!

Advance tickets are $4, $2 with SUID;
at the door tickets are $5, $3 with
SUID. The screening is at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
