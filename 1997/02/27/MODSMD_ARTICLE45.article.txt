With San Francisco and San lose being just about equidis
tant to the Stanford campus, there usually seems to be no par
ticular reason to go the San Jose Museum of Art — if I'm in
the mood for contemporary art-viewing, I'll take the extra 15
minutes on the freeway to get to the SI MOM A.
Alter all, it has a much more chic acronym.
But now I've discovered a reason for heading south.
Make that a do/en reasons; one for each of the 12 artists
whose work can now been seen at the SJMA as part of the Ku
reka Fellowship Awards exhibition.
The awards, which consist of a grant of $15,000 a year for
three years (with no strings attached), are given to rigorously
selected Hay Area visual artists to aid them in any aspect of

their art making.
Now, one year after they received the grant,
these artists prove that they deserve what they
received — their work is truly extraordinary.
From a viewer's perspective, it's not just the
quality of their work that makes this exhibition
so exciting but also the range and scope of art
on display, which is enough to keep even some
one with a short attention span on his toes. It

covers a variety of issues—computer technology, Chicano his
tory, hospice care, youth violence and overconsumption and
waste, to name a few. These are represented in an equally vast
variety of media —painting, drawing, photography, sculpture,
video and mixed-media installation.
Some of the most stellar pieces in the show bear the name
of one of Stanford's own — Asst. Art Prof. Enrique Chagoya.
At first glance his paintings and works on paper combine a
startling mixture of iconography: traditional Mexican sym-

bols, religious figures and American cartoons.
Talking to the artist, who is at once incredibly pa
tient and passionate in tone, it becomes clear that the
images he uses are very personally charged — many
still in his memory from his childhood in Mexico.
"I grew up with Mickey Mouse |and| Catholic
iconography," Chagoya confessed.
Hut he is very explicit about the cultural-political
weight of his images as well. The indigenous images
are artifacts of an annihilated culture, the Catholic
icons emblematic of religious conquest and cartoons
represent corporate cultural imperialism.
Ultimately, the juxtaposition of these symbols
sends a message about the interaction of dualities,
Chagoya explained.
"My work is a reaction against all the conflicts that
1 cannot escape from,"he said. "How in a country
that was created by immigration itself— how that
becomes an evil thing. [And] how spirituality be-

comes a justification for killing."
ForChagoya's mixed media piece on paper, a "book" titled
"Orbis Canibalium" ("The Friendly Cannibal Codex"), he
had the specific intent to recreate history.
"The origin of the material is based on the fact that all the
ancient books in the Americas were burned.... There was a
whole library in the kingdom of Texcoco, which was run by
King Netza," Chagoya said. But he lamented that the
Spaniards burned it all.
"So 1 decided to make my own books, my own versions of
history — history to me is an ideological invention — a story
told by those who won wars," Chagoya said. "I exercise my

own right for inventing history as well."
The result, which is one of Chagoya's favorite works, is a
poignant reclamation of the past and lives up to his vision
that "art predicts some kind of consciousness that hopefully
can be shared by other people."
Another of the artists in the show, Kathryn Spence, also
uses a reclamation of sorts to create her work. In this case, in
stead of reclaiming the past, she reclaims waste; she uses street
trash to create a flock of life-sized pigeons on the museum
floor. It's a very touching installation in that it elicits feelings
of compassion for the figures of the birds and also horror at
the thought that they are made of city grime.
The artist herself is incredibly engaging, and although she
is hesitant to speak about her work, she offers powerful in
sight into it.
She notes that while on one hand we consider pigeons
"rats with wings," it is interesting that on the other hand,
"they're the ones who've evolved to our city — they made our
environment something they're more comfortable with than

we are. 1 feel bad about the fact that they have to pick
around in our garbage because I think it's degrad
ing."
Spence also commented on her own experience
with picking around in garbage to make the piece.
"I mourn the idea that we don't get to touch
everything," she said. But she did touch the un
touchable and admitted it was gross.
An unnamed friend of the artist standing nearby
offered an interpretation of the piece: "It is the act of
urban dwellers trying to own the responsibility of
having trash by not separating yourself from it."
Another artist who investigates aspects of modern
existence is Rebecca Bollinger. In her work, she down
loads personal images from people's World Wide Web
pages and prints them on cookies and baked goods.

There seems to he a connection between family photos and
baked goods, things that used to he considered very persona]
items and have now become impersonated by technology.
Not to be missed in this exhibition are the works of the other
nine artists. Highlights include the beautiful and inspiring self
portraits by Yolanda Ixipez — which express a sort of self-explo
ration within the context of diverging cultures. Also worth not
ing are a robotic sculpture by Chico MacMurtrie which investi
gates evolution, a photographic series by Jim (io!dbcrg that doc
uments his father's experience with terminal illness, and an in
stallation by Mildred Howard connecting young black soldiers
from World War I and their violent contemporary counterparts
It's an involved experience to see such a diverse collection
of work in a single show — but it's also small enough to resist
being overwhelmed. Finally, it is a powerful selection of art
that has the ability to provoke, move and inspire.
