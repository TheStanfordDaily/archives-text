( A History of Reading," by Alberto
Z\ Manguel (Viking, $26.95) is an erudite
,/jLand enchanting meditation on books
and their readers. Manguel deftly shuttles
through strands of reading history, from the
Mesopotamian clay tablets that defined the first
use of vyriting to the CD-ROM that contains the
complete works of Shakespeare in their various
editions and adaptations.
In between, one finds biblical verses written
on hard-boiled eggs and honey cakes, an exquis
itely illustrated encyclopedia of an invented
world written in an invented language and men
tal palaces erected to facilitate the memorization
of texts.
"A History of Reading" is never a forced
march from Point A to Point Bin —in the first
three pages alone, Manguel presents a montage
of "a universal fellowship of readers," from
Paolo and Francesca to Jorge Luis Borges.
Manguel's own experiences as a reader hold the
book in focus as he reflects on the varied uses of
reading.
"Experience came to me first through
books," writes Manguel. "1 prepared myself for
encounters with ghosts, with death, with talking
animals, with battle; I made complicated plans
for travel to ad- ,

venturous is
lands on which
Sinbad would
become my
bosom friend."

Considering the privacy that a book can pro
vide, Manguel describes sitting in his father's li
brary in Buenos Aires with the "elephantine Es
pasa-Calpe Spanish encyclopedia," perusing the
entries on "masturbation," "penis," "syphilis"
and other sexually related topics. When his fa
ther makes an unexpected entrance into the
room, Manguel realizes for the first time that
"no one .. . could enter my reading space," and
pauses, struck by the implications of this discov
ery.
As the book unfolds, Manguel considers
reading from all angles, crawling underneath it
and turning it about, examining the shape of
the book, the act of being read to, the banning
of books and book thieves. Every chapter is a
mosaic of startling facts and toothsome quotes.
In "Learning to Read," Manguel describes the
achievement of literacy as "an initiation, a ritu
alized passage out of a state of dependency"
Here, he glosses a medieval Jewish ritual cele
brating a child's understanding of writing: The
Hebrew alphabet and a passage from the Scrip
tures would be written upon a slate, then read
aloud by the teacher. When the words were suc
cessfully repeated by the child, "the slate was
covered with honey and the child licked it,
thereby bodily assimilating the holy words."
A more sophisticated substantiation of lan
guage is explored in his chapter on translators.
Manguel frames the question of the translator's
role via a story of sitting at a Parisian cafe with
two books before him: the "Oeuvres poetiques"
of 16th century French poet Louise Labe and the

20th century German translation of Lab£ by
Rainer Maria Rilke.
In Manguel's estimation, Rilke's task was
"the deepening of [Labe's] poetic thought, car
rying it further than the original was prepared to
go, seeing, as it were, more in Labi's words than
Lab£ herself saw." But scholar George Steiner
criticized this trait of Rilke's, arguing that the
translator's role is not to improve on the origi
nal.
Does Labe deserve a faithful rendering of her
verse, obscure musical terminology and all?
Manguel answers this question with a gloss of
Alexander von Humboldt's idea "that each lan
guage possess an 'inner linguistic shape'. ... No
word in any given language is exactly identical to
any other language, rendering translation an
impossible task, like coining the face of the wind
or braiding a cord of sand."
Nearing the end, I began to read the book
more slowly, stretching out the final few chap
ters. 1 was delighted, then, to find that Manguel
felt similarly reluctant to finish writing the
book. As a postscript to "A History of Reading,"
Manguel placed "Endpapers," a description of a
definitive book on reading ("The History of
Reading," as he puts it) that he hasn't read "but

— Gustave Flaubert

would like to read."
In truth, this "book" is an invention on
Manguel's part. In describing the "chapters,"
Manguel sneaks in nuggets about Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's habit of reading a couple of pages of a
dictionary every morning and about the
marathon readings of Ulysses on Bloomsday. He
describes letter T of the index as yielding such
entries as "Tarzan's library, Tearing pages, Toes
(reading with), Torment by recitation, Transmi
gration of readers' souls (see Lending books)."
This magpie's nest of tidbits does more than
charm — it demonstrates Manguel's recogni
tion that no history of

reading can be com
plete.
Still, "A History
of Reading" isn't
too far off this Pla
tonic mark. Al
though Manguel
neglects to mention
the art of toe-read
ing and mentions
Tarzan's library
only once, he still
has assembled a
dazzling array of vi
gnettes and illustra
tions to delight the
devoted bookworm
and the casual read
er alike. D
