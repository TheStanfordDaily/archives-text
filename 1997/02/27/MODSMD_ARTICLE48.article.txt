\) 112 y° u are not thoroughly versed in the canon of
iJLX dramatic theater from the Renaissance, then
you've probably not heard of Moliere's 1668
play "George Dandin" and for good reason. It is a minor
three-act play in Moliere's repertoire, based on a one-act
written earlier in his career, and it does not articulate
Moliere's insight into the human condition as powerfully
as plays such as "The Would-Be Gentleman" or "Tartuffe."
This relative obscurity makes "George Dandin" an in
teresting choice for director Jean-Marie Apolistides, a
professor in the departments of drama and French and

Italian. According to
Apolistides, ho took this
opportunity to interpret
the piece in an original
manner that he hoped
would demand the audi
ence's engagement in the
title character's process
of descent from the posi
tion of solidly masculine
and respected to that of a
broken failure hinting at
suicide. Unfortunately
this production's ability
to actually challenge the
audience is not altogeth
er successful for various
reasons.
The problems with
this production lie
mainly in the way the
text's various themes in
teract with Apolistides
vision. Historically,
"George Dandin" has
been viewed as address
ing the issues of "class
relationships and
[about] women's libera
tion from traditional
marriage bonds," ac
cording to the playbill.
Very little change needs
to be made to the text to
accurately portray these
issues, and the perfor
mance does show the
tensions of both issues
well.

Into this is thrown the issue of sexuality and sexual
presence, one which barely surfaces in the original text but
that Apolistid£s' interpretation of this translation (by
Stanford Drama Prof. Carl Weber) focuses on.
"We are all more or less obliged to adapt ourselves to
our new situations and sexuality in our new circum
stances," Apolistid£s said, defending the centralization of
sexuality in an interview. "I tried to visualize the uncon
scious of the play itself.... In the beginning Dandin rep
resents traditional masculinity and at the end he is lost, in
the middle of nowhere, much like modern man. ... We
know more now about the characters than Moliere did

when he wrote ["Dandin"| because we have the work of
Freud and Marx among others."
But the presence of sexual tension onstage is done with
an overly heavy hand. George Dandin (Jordan Gelber) ini
tially comes on stage with a large metallic phallus strapped
on; Lubin (excellently portrayed by Robin Moroney) mas
turbates during a short soliloquy, providing comic enter
tainment but little serious intellectual food-for-thought.
In another of Apolistides added lines, there is gratuitous
sexual innuendo between Monsieur de Sotenville (Adam
Susman) and Madame de Sotenville (Sarah Cathcart), and

Clitandre (Nathan Harper) is clearly a courtly sexual
predator with no real desire to live out his life with An
gelique (Tanya Lukin).
Another reason this interpretation of the play runs into
trouble is because it is very difficult to play one of
Moliere's characters. They were scripted as archetypes,
quintessential symbols of a particular persona, and in
some cases the tension between the actor and his or her
role failed to flush out a realistic portrait of a believable
character.
Gelber, as Dandin, speaks in a flat monotone the entire
show, exposing his emotions only through the volume of
his voice without any subtle inflections. Similarly, his wife,

Angelique, can only articulate in a breathy blushing
whine. However, Lukin manages to create a solid charac
ter through her onstage movements and body language,
which Gelber does not explore with nearly the same
depth.
Almost all of the other major characters experience
similar difficulties with varying degrees of success. Mon
sieur and Madame de Sotenville and Lubin have excellent
stage presence and present their parts well. Claudine (loya
Martuscello), Clitandre and Colin (Jordan Harrison) all
turn in well-choreographed and well-scripted perfor
mances.

One of the most
successful aspects ol
the performance
was the use of sever
al interpretive and
well-choreographed
tableaux, segments
of music and dance
which appear spo
radically through
out the play and
provide an interest
ing and often comic
change from the
spoken scenes. Al
though a common
theatrical tool in
Moliere's era, most
modern theater has
forgotten the power
of tableaux, and per
haps it is its
anachronism that
helped the tableaux
succeed here in pre
senting facets of the
text that otherwise
may not have been
seen clearly.
I admit that I was
disturbed by some
of the textual
changes made in this
play. The perfor
mance attempted to
walk a fine line by
mixing modern lan-

guage and conceptions with a historical presentation of
the play, but the inconsistent use of those exact issues
was self-defeating. If a fully contemporary interpretation
had been presented, then this classical play would not
have suffered a weakening. The tension created by the at
tempt to create a modern interpretation and maintain a
piece with historical accuracy held the play back from
reaching its potential.
Still, I respect what this group of actors has done with
a very difficult piece, and it is good to see our peers cre
ating art that does not allow itself to be restricted by fear
of experimentation.
