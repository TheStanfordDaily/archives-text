# Lost Highway at the edge of David Lynch's horizon
## 
### 
Please don't bother asking me what Lost Highway is about because I
have only the vaguest idea. I'm also not particularly bothered by that
fact, at least not any more than I am bothered by not knowing what
a Bosch painting or a given chapter in Ulysses is about.
A linear narrative is not a prerequisite for the evocation ol an emotion
al response, and David Lynch is one of the few artists who tries to push the
limits of cinema as a medium of sound, images and possibilities. 1 hat
doesn't mean he always knows when to stop pushing. Somewhere between
the fever dream of'Eraserhead" and the ominous suburban dread of "Blue
Velvet" and the pilo.t of "Twin Peaks" is a place where Lynch gets in trou
■ ble, where he begins to irritate the audience he is trying to seduce. "Lost
Highway" is Lynch at hik best and his worst, his work as unnerving as it is
excessive.
Any attempt to describe the plot of "Lost Highway" is ultimately an ex
ercise in futility, but essentially it involves two uniquely connected story
lines. In the first, nightclub musician Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) faces a
couple of potentially threatening situations. The jealous Fred is worried
that his wife, Renee (a brunette Patricia Arquette), is cheating on him but
even more worried when someone begins leaving videotapes on his
doorstep showing someone slowly stalking them. Suddenly Renee is dead,
and Fred is on death row after being convicted of her murder. 'I hen, even
more suddenly, Fred has been replaced in his prison cell by Pete Dayton
(Balthazar Getty), a young mechanic with no memory of how he got there.
When Pete is released, he ends up mixed up with a gangster named Mr.
Eddy (Robert Loggia), Mr. Eddy's mistress, Alice (Patricia Arquette again,
now a blonde), and a spooky mystery man (Robert Blake).
There is little doubt in my mind that when he is working at the top of
his form David Lynch can turn our darkest unspoken fears into brilliant
cinema like no other living director. There are nightmare visions in Lynch
projects which can leave you shaking tor days, and there are moments dur
ing the first hour of "Lost Highway" that build and release tension with al
most unbearable skill. Long stretches of silence are punctuated by sudden ,
bursts of sound; characters drift into darkness in shots that linger long j
enough to make you start peeking through your fingers. And then there is
the hilariously creepy scene in which Blake's white-faced mystery man!
taunts Fred by making a phone call to Fred's house — which the mystery,
man himself then answers. With its eerie production design and
mounting paranoia, "Lost Highway" begins to cast a spell that will have;
viewers anxious but intrigued.

I'oo bad it takes such a short time to lose those viewers entirely. 1 he
Fred-to-Pete transformation is not a fatal error in and of itself, although
audiences used to conventional narratives may be baffled by it. I he real
Villain in the collapse of "Lost Highway" is Lynch's inability to ground the
film so that its world makes internal sense. Ihe landscape ol Liasci head
Was unquestionably surreal; "Blue Velvet, as unsettling as it was, always
focused on the horrors of the real world. Lynchs misfires, like Wild at
Heart" and the latter stages of "Twin Peaks," teased viewers with real
world horrors before launching into surreal realms which left them throw
ing up their hands (if not actually throwing up).
The mistake in "Lost Highway" isn't the outrageous character shift, but
the way the other characters in the film respond to that event as a "problem
to be solved. If "Lost Highway" is about psychosis made flesh, about psy
chological duality becoming physical duality, it falls short of pulling you
into that World because it has given you the impression that there is an "an
swer." And while you're busy giving yourself a headache trying to solve that
mystery, you aren't getting caught up in the atmosphere of the mystery it
self. ' .
"Lost Highway" contains too many individual moments of vintage
Lynch to be considered a failure. However, Lynch does seem to be repeat
ing himself as he tries to create those moments. The grimly comic vio
lence, the degraded sexuality and the languid exchanges of dialogue are all
familiar and .seem more like self-plagiarism than a characteristic style.
Loggia's gangster with the hair-trigger temper is a pale imitation of Den
nis Hopper's savage menace, in "Blue Velvet, and Lynch s
madonna / whore fixation is in full bloom both in Arquette's sly dual role
! and Pete's girlfriend, Sheila (Natasha GregsOn Wagner). Lynch often seems
I more interested in re-creating than creating, in taking the perfect 10s of his
I career and cranking them up to 11.
For its first hour, "Lost Highway" is brilliant, and there are flashes of
I that brilliance for another 75 minutes, but they don't hold together be
-1 cause there isn't a consistent tone or structure to sustain them. In a film
■ where everything seems to be in two places at once, it is fitting that "Lost
| Highway" doesn't stay in any one place long enough. LL
