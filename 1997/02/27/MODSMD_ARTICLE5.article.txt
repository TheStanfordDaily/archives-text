# From proposals to the laboratory
## Research process long but rewarding 
### Kevin Greenman 
In the debate that continues
over whether Stanford should be
more of a teaching or a research
institution,the process and im
portance of research is over
looked.
Often understanding how the
research process operates is al
most as challenging as the exper
imentation itself, given the tech
nical expertise required of today's
researcher.
The research group
The modern research group is
composed of various faculty and
students, and it combines the
skills and experience of each
member to accomplish tasks nec
essary to answer the question at
hand.
The research group is led by a
principle investigator — a faculty
member, usually a professor. The
principle investigator has overall
responsibility for the technical
and fiscal management of a spon

sored project.
Depending on the size of the
project, the principle investigator
has the assistance of postdoctoral
fellows. These researchers have
recently obtained their doctoral
degrees and take on positions
with a research group to obtain
further training in an area of spe
cialty.
Principle investigators also
use graduate students in their
laboratory. In training to become
independent researchers, these
students learn research tech
niques associated with their disci
pline. In some cases, undergradu
ates may also participate in the
laboratory; for example, a vast
majority of the 100 to 125 Stan
ford seniors majoring in biology
are involved in research pro
grams. Typically, each member
will have a task commensurate
with their experience and related
to the overall goal.
Life in the lab

One undergraduate researcher is
Adrian Keatinge-Clay, a sophomore
working in the lab of Chemical Engi
neering Prof. Chaitan Khosla. His
group is attempting to use an exist
ing bacterial system to develop a
new antibiotic.
"What we do is introduce new
molecules into ketide synthase sys
tems and generate potentially phar
maceutical active molecules which
no one has seen before," said
Keatinge-Clay.
Keatinge-Clay said much of what
he has learned was taught to him by
a postdoctoral fellow in the lab, John
Jacobsen.
"He's shown me the steps I need
to take in order to reproduce his re
sults," said Keatinge-Clay. "We look
at how can this drug be more power
ful and what kinds of alterations
might make it even stronger. .. .I'm
one of the people who helps engineer
the chemistry behind these new
molecules."
Another undergraduate doing
research is junior Yves Zinggeler.
His group, which is working in the
Medical School's Developmental Bi
ology Department, focuses on the
study of cardiogenesis — the differ
entiation of cells to become the heart
in embryos — by using the fruit fly's
genetic model.
With the direction of principle in
vestigator and Medical Prof. Matt
Scott and postdoctoral fellow
Joseph Weiss, Zinggeler participates
in many aspects of laboratory work,
from DNA analysis to taking care of
the flies used in his experiments.
"I spend a lot of time there, al
most too much time, but I think it's
worth it," Zinggeler said. "I learn
more there than I do in class."
Zinggeler also said he benefits
form the individual interaction with
his principle investigator. "I see my
principle investigator almost every
day,"he said.
In larger departments, the stu
dents have less interaction with the
principle investigator, working al
most exclusively under the supervi
sion of a postdoctoral fellow or grad
uate student. In some cases, there
are subgroups within a research
team that work-on areas of particu
lar interest related to the larger
problem.
Doctoral student Shirley Lin
works in one such subgroup in
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Robert Way
mouth's lab. Her subgroup's work
on polymers integrates with the
overall objective of her research
group.
"Everyone has a project, and
they're pursuing their little piece of
the puzzle," said Lin.
Funding
The largest obstacle to scientific
research is funding. The expense as
sociated with everything from ex
pendable lab materials to employee
salaries quickly total up to prohibi
tive amounts. For the vast majority
of researchers, the answer to this
problem comes in the form of public
or private research grants.
Unlike endeavors in world of pri
vate enterprise, most endeavors in
the world of science are undertaken
without a predictable outcome.
Rarely can researchers predict the
importance and impact of their ex
periment before it is undertaken.
For this reason, companies that
rely on scientific investigation for
their profit often must explore
many options before finally com
ing up with a marketable product.

The high price of pharmaceutical
products reflects this limitation, as
the sales of a drug must support not
only the research used to develop
the drug in question, but all the re
search used to weed out other possi
bilities. The same principle holds
true for academic research, al
though profit is not the primary ob
jective in this case. To offset the ex
penditures, researchers must rely
largely on grants from government
agencies or private institutions.
In general, the costs associated
with research include salaries, ex
pendable materials and research fa
cilities.
A fourth category of costs — indi
rect-costs — has been the source of
controversy at Stanford during the
last several years.
In 1990, the federal government
accused the University of using in
appropriate accounting procedures
to determine indirect-cost refund
rates for such items as antiques in
the president's house. The issue was
resolved in 1994 and resulted in sev
eral changes to the administration,
including the 1992 resignation of
then-University President Donald
Kennedy. Stanford now has a re
search handbook that helps clarify
what may be included in indirect
costs.
The more direct costs associated
with research go toward salaries and
expendables.
"Most of the money for a grant
will go toward the salaries of the
graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows," said Physics Prof. Bias
Cabrera. "This amounts to using 60
percent to 70 percent of the funds
for postdoctoral fellow and gradu
ate student salaries, while expend
able materials run around 5 percent
to 10 percent of the total budget."
The remainder is split between indi
rect costs and other salaries. While
these figures vary between research
projects, graduate student and
postdoctoral fellow support consis
tently consume the largest part of
the budget.
For example, in Waymouth's
lab, about $46,000 per year goes to
ward the salary, staff benefits, ma
terials and overhead costs of each
graduate student. Similarly, post
doctoral fellows cost $70,000 per
year. Also, a small amount of the
money goes toward paying for a por
tion of Waymouth's summer salary.
Most of his funding comes from the
National Science Foundation and
the Amoco Chemical.
Where the money comes from
Various government and private
organizations are charged with this
mission from various fields of em
phasis.
For natural sciences, the Nation
al Science Foundation is a large
source. Physics researchers often
apply to the Department of Energy,
while biologists rely heavily on the
National Institutes of Health for
biomedical work. The Office of
Naval Research, the Environmen
tal Protection Agency and numer
ous other agencies provide support
as well.
Private groups such as the
American Heart Association, the
American Cancer Society and vari
ous industry interest groups also
support research but often toward a
more directed goal than the govern
mental agencies.
The number of possible sources
increases the chance for funding of
many projects. "One of the
strengths in this country is that
there are more than one funding
base," said Cabrera.
However, obtaining funds for
these goals is not easy.

"There are a growing number of
high quality efforts which are not
being supported due to lack of
funds," Cabrera said. "First of all,
you identify the area you're inter
ested in working in and then the
[funding] agency. It's often very
useful to have a discussion with the
area at the National Science Foun
dation or the Department of Ener
gy that you are interested in apply
ing toward to learn what the norms
are in terms of support."
Researchers prepare a grant
proposal and submit it to meet rig
orous guidelines. The paper de
scribes the experiment, objectives
and qualifications of the research
investigator. It is not uncommon
for proposals to be rejected two or
three times before funding is
granted.
"It is not unusual for a program
to be funded at a low level compared
to what it actually costs to get the
work done," said Cabrera.
Such difficulties have not always
been the case, said Jones. When she
began research in 1977, 35 percent
to 40 percent of grant proposals
were funded in her department, she
said. That number dropped signifi
cantly to about 10 percent before re
bounding to the current level of 20
percent.
"It's harder to get funding, and
it's harder to get grants as large,"
said Jones. Researchers find it
"harder to maintain their research
programs, and we all have to spend
more time writing applications."
This is due in large part to feder
al budget cuts, said Visiting Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Patrick McDougal.
"There's a lot of pressure on
federal dollars; one of the easy tar
gets [in budget cuts] seems to be
research dollars," he said.
One other concern is the deploy
ment of those dollars, as some sci
entists argue that basic laboratory
research is being neglected to pay
for larger science tools such as su
percolliders and the space program.
Individual student stories
Many scientists cite past experi
ences as inspiration for their career
in research, such as Keatinge-Clay.
"One influence in my life was my
half-brother who was always giving
me biology or chemistry books for
Christmas presents," he said.

In particular two disciplines are
the greatest source of interest for
Keatinge-Clay. "That's the bound
ary I'm most interested in, be
tween biology and chemistry.... I
think the overlap between the
fields is growing considerably," he
said
Zinggeler found his position by
applying to numerous openings
listed on Odyssey, an online data
base of internships and job oppor
tunities. Scott's lab was the first to
offer a position to Zinggeler.
"It was kind of a luck thing the
way I got thrown into that field,"
Zinggeler said. When looking for a
job, Zinggeler's priorities were "to
learn basic science . .. like molecu
lar biology and how to clone
genes."
His view on science and its ben
efits emphasizes the importance of
problem solving.
"You can read about it in books
and take tests on it, but that's not
science," he said. "You're not actu
ally approaching a true problem. In
real science you repeat your exper
iments. You learn how to approach
a problem and attack it from an ex
perimental point of view."
Lin was similarly influenced
early in her career. Growing up
near the many colleges in Massa
chusetts, Lin had experience with
chemistry through her father, a
chemistry professor.
"I was attracted to chemistry
because the department was small
and friendly," she said. "I had
some excellent chemistry teachers
early on."
Part of the advantage Lin found
at MIT was the emphasis on un
dergraduate research. "I happened
to fall into the field of organometal
lic chemistry as an undergraduate.
I figured, 'I really like doing this.'
That's how I happened to stay in
the field of organometallic."
After graduating, Lin came to
Stanford as a graduate student in
Waymouth's group.
"Graduate school exists to do all
these things — to teach people to
do chemistry, how to do it well and
to teach people how to teach other
people how to do chemistry," she
said. "I've always felt that science
is that one place where your goal is
to search for the answer, the
truth."

ous other agencies provide support
as well.
Private groups such as the
American Heart Association, the
American Cancer Society and vari
ous industry interest groups also
support research but often toward a
more directed goal than the govern
mental agencies.
The number of possible sources
increases the chance for funding of
many projects. "One of the
strengths in this country is that
there are more than one funding
base," said Cabrera.
However, obtaining funds for
these goals is not easy.

"There are a growing number of
high quality efforts which are not
being supported due to lack of
funds," Cabrera said. "First of all,
you identify the area you're inter
ested in working in and then the
[funding] agency. It's often very
useful to have a discussion with the
area at the National Science Foun
dation or the Department of Ener
gy that you are interested in apply
ing toward to learn what the norms
are in terms of support."
Researchers prepare a grant
proposal and submit it to meet rig
orous guidelines. The paper de
scribes the experiment, objectives
and qualifications of the research
investigator. It is not uncommon
for proposals to be rejected two or
three times before funding is
granted.
"It is not unusual for a program
to be funded at a low level compared
to what it actually costs to get the
work done," said Cabrera.
Such difficulties have not always
been the case, said Jones. When she
began research in 1977, 35 percent
to 40 percent of grant proposals
were funded in her department, she
said. That number dropped signifi
cantly to about 10 percent before re
bounding to the current level of 20
percent.
"It's harder to get funding, and
it's harder to get grants as large,"
said Jones. Researchers find it
"harder to maintain their research
programs, and we all have to spend
more time writing applications."
This is due in large part to feder
al budget cuts, said Visiting Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Patrick McDougal.
"There's a lot of pressure on
federal dollars; one of the easy tar
gets [in budget cuts] seems to be
research dollars," he said.
One other concern is the deploy
ment of those dollars, as some sci
entists argue that basic laboratory
research is being neglected to pay
for larger science tools such as su
percolliders and the space program.
Individual student stories
Many scientists cite past experi
ences as inspiration for their career
in research, such as Keatinge-Clay.
"One influence in my life was my
half-brother who was always giving
me biology or chemistry books for
Christmas presents," he said.

In particular two disciplines are
the greatest source of interest for
Keatinge-Clay. "That's the bound
ary I'm most interested in, be
tween biology and chemistry.... I
think the overlap between the
fields is growing considerably," he
said
Zinggeler found his position by
applying to numerous openings
listed on Odyssey, an online data
base of internships and job oppor
tunities. Scott's lab was the first to
offer a position to Zinggeler.
"It was kind of a luck thing the
way I got thrown into that field,"
Zinggeler said. When looking for a
job, Zinggeler's priorities were "to
learn basic science . .. like molecu
lar biology and how to clone
genes."
His view on science and its ben

problem solving.
"You can read about it in books
and take tests on it, but that's not
science," he said. "You're not actu

real science you repeat your exper

a problem and attack it from an ex
perimental point of view."
Lin was similarly influenced
early in her career. Growing up
near the many colleges in Massa
chusetts, Lin had experience with
chemistry through her father, a
chemistry professor.
"I was attracted to chemistry
because the department was small
and friendly," she said. "I had
some excellent chemistry teachers

Part of the advantage Lin found
at MIT was the emphasis on un
dergraduate research. "I happened
to fall into the field of organometal
lic chemistry as an undergraduate.
I figured, 'I really like doing this.'
That's how I happened to stay in
the field of organometallic."
After graduating, Lin came to
Stanford as a graduate student in
Waymouth's group.
"Graduate school exists to do all
these things — to teach people to
do chemistry, how to do it well and
to teach people how to teach other
people how to do chemistry," she
said. "I've always felt that science

Katie Stokes — Daily
In the debate that continues
over whether Stanford should be
more of a teaching or a research
institution,the process and im
portance of research is over
looked.
Often understanding how the
research process operates is al
most as challenging as the exper
imentation itself, given the tech
nical expertise required of today's
researcher.
The research group
The modern research group is
composed of various faculty and
students, and it combines the
skills and experience of each
member to accomplish tasks nec
essary to answer the question at
hand.
The research group is led by a
principle investigator — a faculty
member, usually a professor. The
principle investigator has overall
responsibility for the technical
and fiscal management of a spon

sored project.
Depending on the size of the
project, the principle investigator
has the assistance of postdoctoral
fellows. These researchers have
recently obtained their doctoral
degrees and take on positions
with a research group to obtain
further training in an area of spe
cialty.
Principle investigators also
use graduate students in their
laboratory. In training to become
independent researchers, these
students learn research tech
niques associated with their disci
pline. In some cases, undergradu
ates may also participate in the
laboratory; for example, a vast
majority of the 100 to 125 Stan
ford seniors majoring in biology
are involved in research pro
grams. Typically, each member
will have a task commensurate
with their experience and related
to the overall goal.
Life in the lab


Shephen Cho — Daily
Senior Yves Zingqeler screens genomic drosophila in the Vir
ius Library.
One undergraduate researcher is
Adrian Keatinge-Clay, a sophomore
working in the lab of Chemical Engi
neering Prof. Chaitan Khosla. His
group is attempting to use an exist
ing bacterial system to develop a
new antibiotic.
"What we do is introduce new
molecules into ketide synthase sys
tems and generate potentially phar
maceutical active molecules which
no one has seen before," said
Keatinge-Clay.
Keatinge-Clay said much of what
he has learned was taught to him by
a postdoctoral fellow in the lab, John
Jacobsen.
"He's shown me the steps I need
to take in order to reproduce his re
sults," said Keatinge-Clay. "We look
at how can this drug be more power
ful and what kinds of alterations
might make it even stronger. .. .I'm
one of the people who helps engineer
the chemistry behind these new
molecules."
Another undergraduate doing
research is junior Yves Zinggeler.
His group, which is working in the
Medical School's Developmental Bi
ology Department, focuses on the
study of cardiogenesis — the differ
entiation of cells to become the heart
in embryos — by using the fruit fly's
genetic model.
With the direction of principle in
vestigator and Medical Prof. Matt
Scott and postdoctoral fellow
Joseph Weiss, Zinggeler participates
in many aspects of laboratory work,
from DNA analysis to taking care of
the flies used in his experiments.
"I spend a lot of time there, al
most too much time, but I think it's
worth it," Zinggeler said. "I learn
more there than I do in class."
Zinggeler also said he benefits
form the individual interaction with
his principle investigator. "I see my
principle investigator almost every
day,"he said.
In larger departments, the stu
dents have less interaction with the
principle investigator, working al
most exclusively under the supervi
sion of a postdoctoral fellow or grad
uate student. In some cases, there
are subgroups within a research
team that work-on areas of particu
lar interest related to the larger
problem.
Doctoral student Shirley Lin
works in one such subgroup in
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Robert Way
mouth's lab. Her subgroup's work
on polymers integrates with the
overall objective of her research
group.
"Everyone has a project, and
they're pursuing their little piece of
the puzzle," said Lin.
Funding
The largest obstacle to scientific
research is funding. The expense as
sociated with everything from ex
pendable lab materials to employee
salaries quickly total up to prohibi
tive amounts. For the vast majority
of researchers, the answer to this
problem comes in the form of public
or private research grants.
Unlike endeavors in world of pri
vate enterprise, most endeavors in
the world of science are undertaken
without a predictable outcome.
Rarely can researchers predict the
importance and impact of their ex
periment before it is undertaken.
For this reason, companies that
rely on scientific investigation for
their profit often must explore
many options before finally com
ing up with a marketable product.

The high price of pharmaceutical
products reflects this limitation, as
the sales of a drug must support not
only the research used to develop
the drug in question, but all the re
search used to weed out other possi
bilities. The same principle holds
true for academic research, al
though profit is not the primary ob
jective in this case. To offset the ex
penditures, researchers must rely
largely on grants from government
agencies or private institutions.
In general, the costs associated
with research include salaries, ex
pendable materials and research fa
cilities.
A fourth category of costs — indi
rect-costs — has been the source of
controversy at Stanford during the
last several years.
In 1990, the federal government
accused the University of using in
appropriate accounting procedures
to determine indirect-cost refund
rates for such items as antiques in
the president's house. The issue was
resolved in 1994 and resulted in sev
eral changes to the administration,
including the 1992 resignation of
then-University President Donald
Kennedy. Stanford now has a re
search handbook that helps clarify
what may be included in indirect
costs.
The more direct costs associated
with research go toward salaries and
expendables.
"Most of the money for a grant
will go toward the salaries of the
graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows," said Physics Prof. Bias
Cabrera. "This amounts to using 60
percent to 70 percent of the funds
for postdoctoral fellow and gradu
ate student salaries, while expend
able materials run around 5 percent
to 10 percent of the total budget."
The remainder is split between indi
rect costs and other salaries. While
these figures vary between research
projects, graduate student and
postdoctoral fellow support consis
tently consume the largest part of
the budget.
For example, in Waymouth's
lab, about $46,000 per year goes to
ward the salary, staff benefits, ma
terials and overhead costs of each
graduate student. Similarly, post
doctoral fellows cost $70,000 per
year. Also, a small amount of the
money goes toward paying for a por
tion of Waymouth's summer salary.
Most of his funding comes from the
National Science Foundation and
the Amoco Chemical.
Where the money comes from
Various government and private
organizations are charged with this
mission from various fields of em
phasis.
For natural sciences, the Nation
al Science Foundation is a large
source. Physics researchers often
apply to the Department of Energy,
while biologists rely heavily on the
National Institutes of Health for
biomedical work. The Office of
Naval Research, the Environmen
tal Protection Agency and numer
ous other agencies provide support
as well.
Private groups such as the
American Heart Association, the
American Cancer Society and vari
ous industry interest groups also
support research but often toward a
more directed goal than the govern
mental agencies.
The number of possible sources
increases the chance for funding of
many projects. "One of the
strengths in this country is that

these goals is not easy.

high quality efforts which are not

Researchers prepare a grant
proposal and submit it to meet rig
orous guidelines. The paper de
scribes the experiment, objectives
and qualifications of the research
investigator. It is not uncommon
for proposals to be rejected two or
three times before funding is
granted.
"It is not unusual for a program
