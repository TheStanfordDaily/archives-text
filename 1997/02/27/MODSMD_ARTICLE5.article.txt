# From proposals to the laboratory
## Research process long but rewarding 
### Kevin Greenman 
In the debate that continues
over whether Stanford should be
more of a teaching or a research
institution,the process and im
portance of research is over
looked.
Often understanding how the
research process operates is al
most as challenging as the exper
imentation itself, given the tech
nical expertise required of today's
researcher.
The research group
The modern research group is
composed of various faculty and
students, and it combines the
skills and experience of each
member to accomplish tasks nec
essary to answer the question at
hand.
The research group is led by a
principle investigator — a faculty
member, usually a professor. The
principle investigator has overall
responsibility for the technical
and fiscal management of a spon

sored project.
Depending on the size of the
project, the principle investigator
has the assistance of postdoctoral
fellows. These researchers have
recently obtained their doctoral
degrees and take on positions
with a research group to obtain
further training in an area of spe
cialty.
Principle investigators also
use graduate students in their
laboratory. In training to become
independent researchers, these
students learn research tech
niques associated with their disci
pline. In some cases, undergradu
ates may also participate in the
laboratory; for example, a vast
majority of the 100 to 125 Stan
ford seniors majoring in biology
are involved in research pro
grams. Typically, each member
will have a task commensurate
with their experience and related
to the overall goal.
