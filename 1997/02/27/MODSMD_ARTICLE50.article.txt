# Afro Promo
## "YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE" 'IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS YEAR, SEE THIS MOVIE!" 
### 
These lines—used in the trailers for 1950s and
1960s movies about black life — can also current
ly be applied to the film, "Afro Promo," which is a
compilation of such trailers and aptly subtitled,
"A Coming Attractions Overview of Blacks in
American Cinema from 1946-1976."
"Afro Promo" represents the achievement of
two years of late but interesting nights for Karl
Bruce Knapper, one of the film's co-curators and
the program administrator for Stanford's Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project.
He and Jenni Olson, friend and co-filmmak
er who has "curated" other such films of trailers,
have enjoyed positive reception and unantici
pated media attention for their film. For in
stance, Knapper was surprised and flattered to
see a Movieline magazine article on "Afro
Promo."
"Movieline is a magazine I read, but a maga
zine I never thought I'd be in," said Knapper, who
majored in communications at Stanford in 1983.
Variety, The San Francisco Chronicle and SF
Weekly round out the growing list of commend
ing publications.
"Afro Promo" will intrigue anyone who has
ever been part of a movie audience— n«.)t just his
torians and filmmakers.
Arranged chronologically within themes, the
film consists of 33 trailers and is more reminis
cent of an art exhibit than a documentary. In
order to work on the film, co-curators Knapper
and Olson would meet at a movie theater at mid
night — the only time a 35-mm projector was
available. After several such trailer viewings, "a
pattern |started] forming," said Knapper, and a
few themes naturally emerged.
The genres and themes covered in "Afro
Promo" range from "Africa," Sidney Poitier and
blaxploitation films, to social issue movies, music
and sports biographies and comedies.
When the trailers are played one after another,
"it really becomes clear... how blacks were mar
keted to the movie-going audience," said Knap
per.
In the 1950s and 19605, trailers commonly
used a narrator with a white-sounding voice to
urge people to watch the movie because it was im
portant for them to see what black life was like.
Often, Knapper said, the trailers portrayed blacks
as "exotic, raw, passionate, emotional."
The trailer would market the movie as "a peck
... into this furtive world that mainstream Amer
ican knew nothing about," said Knapper. These
were the trailers that used lines such as "You've
never seen anything like this before."
In the 19705, however, the narrator was less ob
viously white and used black slang "to try to
sound hip." The effect is "hysterical," laughed
Knapper.
For example, in the preview for "Cool Breeze,"
(1972) the narrator says, "Cool Breeze has got a
bunch of whitey's ice." Un-hip translation: "A
black man has stolen diamonds from a white
man."
In the 19705, films were not marketed so di
rectly to whites, nor did they instruct the audi
ence to see the film because it was about black life.

This is especially true of blaxploitation films,
which made no effort to attract a white audience.
Such movies were written, produced and directed
by blacks and lor blacks. However, they were
cheaply made and rather violent, and they ex
ploited the talents of good actors for what Knap
per called "trashy" films. For example, William
Marshall, a Shakespearean actor in Fngland, had
to resort to acting the lead for "Blacula."
Knapper says through making "Afro Promo,"
he realized how much blacks are and have been
"entertaining commodities for a white audience,"
because it displays "the kinds of roles ... that
good actors wound up having to do."
Related to this lesson is Knapper's discomfort
with certain aspects of the film history of blacks.
"The fact that plantation movies could be popu
lar is disturbing," he said. It upset him that actors
"[had] to do plantation sex films because it paid
the bills."

Although some
of the trailers can be
upsetting, Knapper
and Olson want
viewers to laugh
and enjoy them
selves. In the audi
ences who have seen
"Afro Promo" so far
— all primarily
white — "a lot of
people feel weird
about laughing or
enjoying them
selves," said Knap
per. "People feel
guilty." He sees a lot
of people "wanting
to laugh but being
afraid to" because
they don't want to
appear insensitive.
This tension or
awkwardness epito
mizes the paradoxi
cal premise of this
film — these trail
ers, suffused with
manipulative
stereotypes, were
produced in the
same era that the
United States made

great strides in black political freedom. At the
same time that Hollywood portrayed blacks as
mammies and sexual animals, the Supreme
Court outlawed segregation and Martin Luther
King Jr. led sit-ins.
Even more ironic, Knapper noted, is that Poiti
er was the "top box office draw" in the mid-19605,
a time of great racial strife.
The film's time-markers — 1946 and 1976 —
may seem arbitrary. They actually were chosen
for reasons of convenience, but they also cover a
period rich in developments in black film. The
scarcity of films produced on 35-mm film before
1946 limited Knapper's and Olson's flick-pickings

preceding that year. At the other end, copyright
laws kept trailers made after 1976 difficult to ob
tain. Thus, 1946 and 1976 became the natural
boundaries for "Afro Promo."
The two film curators are now in the process
of putting their project through the festival cir
cuit. "Afro Promo" has already been shown at
the Slumdance Film Festival (which is the alter
native to Slamdance, which is the alternative to
the Sundance Film Festival, all held simultane
ously in the same city) and the San Jose Film Fes
tival.
Future engagements include the Cleveland
Film Festival and the U.S. Film Festival in Dallas.
Knapper and Olson have also submitted "Afro
Promo" to the Film Forum in New York. After its
festival run, the two hope to introduce it to the
educational market. Plans are also in the works
for an "Afro Promo II."

But before then, Stanford students have the
opportunity to view what Knapper describes as a
"really eye-opening" film.
"It's fun, it's entertaining and it's educational,"
said Knapper. What else should one expect of a
film that gives the viewer a taste of something as
"exotic" as "Boss Nigger" — a black-cowboy-
Western-disco movie?

black man has stolen diamonds from a white
man."
In the 19705, films were not marketed so di
rectly to whites, nor did they instruct the audi
ence to see the film because it was about black life.

This is especially true of blaxploitation films,
which made no effort to attract a white audience.
Such movies were written, produced and directed
by blacks and lor blacks. However, they were
cheaply made and rather violent, and they ex
ploited the talents of good actors for what Knap
per called "trashy" films. For example, William
Marshall, a Shakespearean actor in Fngland, had
to resort to acting the lead for "Blacula."
Knapper says through making "Afro Promo,"
he realized how much blacks are and have been
"entertaining commodities for a white audience,"
because it displays "the kinds of roles ... that
good actors wound up having to do."
Related to this lesson is Knapper's discomfort
with certain aspects of the film history of blacks.
"The fact that plantation movies could be popu
lar is disturbing," he said. It upset him that actors
"[had] to do plantation sex films because it paid
the bills."

Although some
of the trailers can be
upsetting, Knapper
and Olson want
viewers to laugh
and enjoy them
selves. In the audi
ences who have seen
"Afro Promo" so far
— all primarily
white — "a lot of
people feel weird
about laughing or
enjoying them
selves," said Knap
per. "People feel
guilty." He sees a lot
of people "wanting
to laugh but being
afraid to" because
they don't want to
appear insensitive.
This tension or
awkwardness epito
mizes the paradoxi
cal premise of this
film — these trail
ers, suffused with
manipulative
stereotypes, were
produced in the
same era that the
United States made

great strides in black political freedom. At the
same time that Hollywood portrayed blacks as
mammies and sexual animals, the Supreme
Court outlawed segregation and Martin Luther
King Jr. led sit-ins.
Even more ironic, Knapper noted, is that Poiti
er was the "top box office draw" in the mid-19605,
a time of great racial strife.
The film's time-markers — 1946 and 1976 —
may seem arbitrary. They actually were chosen
for reasons of convenience, but they also cover a
period rich in developments in black film. The
scarcity of films produced on 35-mm film before
1946 limited Knapper's and Olson's flick-pickings

preceding that year. At the other end, copyright
laws kept trailers made after 1976 difficult to ob
tain. Thus, 1946 and 1976 became the natural
boundaries for "Afro Promo."
The two film curators are now in the process
of putting their project through the festival cir
cuit. "Afro Promo" has already been shown at
the Slumdance Film Festival (which is the alter
native to Slamdance, which is the alternative to
the Sundance Film Festival, all held simultane
ously in the same city) and the San Jose Film Fes
tival.
Future engagements include the Cleveland
Film Festival and the U.S. Film Festival in Dallas.
Knapper and Olson have also submitted "Afro
Promo" to the Film Forum in New York. After its
festival run, the two hope to introduce it to the
educational market. Plans are also in the works
for an "Afro Promo II."

But before then, Stanford students have the
opportunity to view what Knapper describes as a
"really eye-opening" film.
"It's fun, it's entertaining and it's educational,"
said Knapper. What else should one expect of a
film that gives the viewer a taste of something as
"exotic" as "Boss Nigger" — a black-cowboy-
Western-disco movie?
