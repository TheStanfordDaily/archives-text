# The 						15th San Francisco Asian American Film Festival
## 
### 
What do you think of when you hear the phrase "Asian-American film?" " 1 he
Joy Luck Club"? "The Wedding Banquet"? Anything else? Historically, Asian
characters in Western productions have been polarized. Women are por
trayed as exotic and foreign, while men are stereotyped as weak but crafty.
With the support of groups like the National Asian American Telecommu
nication Arts Association, Asian Americans are now defining their own portrayals for them
selves.
Spanning filmmaking from the 1930s to the 19905, the 15th annual San Francisco Inter
national Asian American Film Festival is a riotous profusion of art : humor and drama. A
showcase for North American as well as Pacific Asian film, videos and documentaries, the
festival runs the gamut from vintage silent films to modern indies.
Japanese-American actor Sessue Hayakawa will be featured in two rarely seen blasts from
the past. Cecil B. DeMille's 1931 film, "The Cheat," was initially banned in several American
states for its veiled sexuality. It was also condemned by the Japanese community for its
stereotyping of Asian males. French director Roger Lion's 1924 silent melodrama, "1 Have
Killed" ("Lai Tue"), boasts footage from the 1923 earthquake in Japan, as well as outdoor
shots of 1920s Paris. Live accompaniment will be provided by pianist Bruce Loeb.
The opening night gala, with a reception following the screening, is the showing of a re
discovered silent screen gem, "Love and Duty" (1931), directed by Bu Wancang (Richard
Poh). Starring Ruan Lingyu — known as "the Greta Garbo of China" — and Jin Yan (Ray
mond King) the film is an examination of thwarted but enduring young love in 1930s Shang
hai. Harking back to the festival's roots, the screening will be held in Chinatown. It will be
accompanied by a nine-piece orchestra performing an original score by local saxophonist
and composer John Yi.
A bountiful collection of Bay Area filmmaking includes Hiro Narita's "Isamu Noguchi:

Stone and Paper" on the artist and sculptor. "Fins
and Noodles" is the true story of a quest for good
health and good food by Arnold Iger and Paul Kwan.
Among the short films and videos are Anita Chang's
"One Hundred Eggs a Minute," Maria Luisa Men
donca and Medea Benjamin's "Islands on Fire,"
Michael Arag's "Silencio," Clifford Lui's "B" and Ra
Sek's "Get Off Your Koot!" These are featured in the
individual programs "Fate No More," "On Fire,"
"Cowgirl and the Man," "Asians from Uranus" and
"Tell It Like It Is," respectively.
The entire filmography of internationally
renowned Korean director Jang Sun Woo is being
shown at the festival, beginning with his latest

drama, "A Petal," which traces the wanderings of a 15-year-old girl after she survives the
massacre of Kwangju (the 1980 military assault on civilian protesters). The other intelligent,
haunting films to his credit are: "Age of Success," a fable of capitalism foiled; "Hwa Om
Kyung," a tale of a young boy's travels to meet his unknown mother; "The Lovers of
Woomuk-Baemi," a study on the interweaving of sex, class and will; "The Road to the Race
track," a modern look at sex that has nothing to do with racetracks; and "To You From Me"
with its themes of sexuality and unexpected transformations.
A plethora of gay and lesbian cinema from North America, Asia and Europe is premier-

ing at the festival. Canada's Deepa Mehta produced this year's closing feature, "F ire." In this
film, Indian sisters-in-law within an extended family household find solace from their tra
ditional, loveless marriages in each other's company and then fall passionately in love. St.n
ring Shabana A/.mi and Nandita Das, "Fire" is a study in traditional values clashing with
modern mores.
Other gay and lesbian film screenings include 1997 Sundance Grand Jury A ward-win no i

"Girls Like Us" by Tina DiFeli
ciantonio and Jane Wager, Nick
Deocampo's Philippine docudra
ma "Private Wars" and China's
"Comrades." "Comrades" is a
documentary by Feng Wang and
Gary Wu — a brave work consul
ering that for years China denied
the very existence of homosexu
ality within its borders.
Whether the subject is coming
of-age or coming-of-species,
there are four Asian American in
dies who are having their world

premiere at the festival.
"Shopping for Fangs" by Canadians Quentin Lee and Justin Lin is a concoction of action
thriller, comedy and melodrama. In this film, one of the lead characters, Phil (Radmar |ao
is convinced he is turning into a werewolf when he develops a hair-growth problem. Inter
woven with his adventures are the wanderings of Katherine (Jeanne Chin) as she talks to her
psychiatrist about her mysterious memory losses, shops for fulfillment and develops a
friendship with a waitress.
"Sunsets," by first-time writers and directors Michael Idemoto and Eric Nakamura, is a
minimalist but warm look at three friends spending their last summer together in the boon
docks of Watsonville, Calif.
1994 festival award-winner Rea Tajiri's 1997 contribution is titled "Strawberry Fields.
Set in the 19705, "Fields" is a feminine take on the classic American rebel story. Teen-age py
romaniac Irene (Suzy Nakamura) is recovering from the recent death of her sister and
searching for something to reconnect herself to the world. Neither her parents nor her lover,
Luke (James Sie), can help, for they, too, are caught in refusals to wrestle with their person
al demons. In the case of her parents, it is their internment experiences and in Luke's, his
own hapa parentage.
Chris Chan Lee's "Yellow" is an alternatingly dramatic and humorous day-in-the-life ol
eight high school friends on the verge of graduation. The film follows the travails of Sin Lee
and Alex as they attempt to raise the money stolen from Sin Lee's parents' store so that Sin
Lee can attending college rather than work at the store for the rest of his life. "Yellow" has
the distinction of being the first feature film by and about Korean Americans.
What is an "Asian-American film?" One that calls attention to stereotypes or transcends
them? One that highlights cultural heritage or ignores it altogether? "Sunsets"? "Strawberry
Helds"? I his year's festival entries show that there is no singular definition. D

J J unsets"
takes its
WhJP title from
the best time of day to be at the beach.
The personalities of each of the main charac
ters are aptly summarized in their reason for lov
ing the ending of the day.
Dave (Nicholas Constant) is a placid, laconic
Chicano youth who is quietly trying to get over a recent
breakup with his girlfriend. Shorn of so much self-esteem, he
holds his own with his friends, who try in their own ways to help
him recover.

Mark (Michael
Idemoto), an Asian
American, is wise before
his time. Unlike his
friends, he is destined for
college and a future in Los
Angeles at the end of the sum
mer.
Gary (josh Brand), an
angry white male, has frequent
encounters with the law and an
unstable relationship with his fa
ther and stepmother. In and out of
jail, he depends on his friends for a
place to sleep without having to run
into their parents. But at Dave's, he
finds himself blearily rubbing open
his eyes in the backseat of Dave's car
... only to see the face of Dave's fa
ther mere inches away.
Each day the three friends get to
gether, yammer pointlessly, drive
around town and generally do
their best to find something to do

in a place with little
to offer besides bowling and
burritos. They enjoy drives to the
beach, beerfests — sometimes in homes
they've broken into — and frequent acts of
vandalism.
The acting style is realistic, with inclusions of life's
often inane dialogue. Even the constant profanity is oc
casionally humorous in its childishness. Ken Kawamuri's
original score is used sparingly but effectively throughout the
film. The music lends some real humor in one scene where Dave,
in spite the impatience of his friends, mimes trumpet-playing while

an intense
saxophone
solo wails on
the soundtrack.
If you can
overlook the pro
fanity and the some
what juvenile atti
tudes toward women
and other people's per
sonal property (hey,
we're talking about 17-
year-olds here) "Sunsets"
is a touching tribute to
youthful friendship. It
isn't until they have gone
their separate ways that
each of the characters fi
nally finds the strength to
assess his own shortcom
ings, assert his individual
needs and looks toward
building a life in the real
world. H

J J unsets"
takes its
WhJP title from
the best time of day to be at the beach.
The personalities of each of the main charac
ters are aptly summarized in their reason for lov
ing the ending of the day.
Dave (Nicholas Constant) is a placid, laconic
Chicano youth who is quietly trying to get over a recent
breakup with his girlfriend. Shorn of so much self-esteem, he
holds his own with his friends, who try in their own ways to help
him recover.

Mark (Michael
Idemoto), an Asian
American, is wise before
his time. Unlike his
friends, he is destined for
college and a future in Los
Angeles at the end of the sum
mer.
Gary (josh Brand), an
angry white male, has frequent
encounters with the law and an
unstable relationship with his fa
ther and stepmother. In and out of
jail, he depends on his friends for a
place to sleep without having to run
into their parents. But at Dave's, he
finds himself blearily rubbing open
his eyes in the backseat of Dave's car
... only to see the face of Dave's fa
ther mere inches away.
Each day the three friends get to
gether, yammer pointlessly, drive
around town and generally do
their best to find something to do

in a place with little
to offer besides bowling and
burritos. They enjoy drives to the
beach, beerfests — sometimes in homes
they've broken into — and frequent acts of
vandalism.
The acting style is realistic, with inclusions of life's
often inane dialogue. Even the constant profanity is oc
casionally humorous in its childishness. Ken Kawamuri's
original score is used sparingly but effectively throughout the
film. The music lends some real humor in one scene where Dave,
in spite the impatience of his friends, mimes trumpet-playing while

an intense
saxophone
solo wails on
the soundtrack.
If you can
overlook the pro
fanity and the some
what juvenile atti
tudes toward women
and other people's per
sonal property (hey,
we're talking about 17-
year-olds here) "Sunsets"
is a touching tribute to
youthful friendship. It
isn't until they have gone
their separate ways that
each of the characters fi
nally finds the strength to
assess his own shortcom
ings, assert his individual
needs and looks toward
building a life in the real
world. H

What do you think of when you hear the phrase "Asian-American film?" " 1 he
Joy Luck Club"? "The Wedding Banquet"? Anything else? Historically, Asian
characters in Western productions have been polarized. Women are por
trayed as exotic and foreign, while men are stereotyped as weak but crafty.
With the support of groups like the National Asian American Telecommu
nication Arts Association, Asian Americans are now defining their own portrayals for them
selves.
Spanning filmmaking from the 1930s to the 19905, the 15th annual San Francisco Inter
national Asian American Film Festival is a riotous profusion of art : humor and drama. A
showcase for North American as well as Pacific Asian film, videos and documentaries, the
festival runs the gamut from vintage silent films to modern indies.
Japanese-American actor Sessue Hayakawa will be featured in two rarely seen blasts from
the past. Cecil B. DeMille's 1931 film, "The Cheat," was initially banned in several American
states for its veiled sexuality. It was also condemned by the Japanese community for its
stereotyping of Asian males. French director Roger Lion's 1924 silent melodrama, "1 Have
Killed" ("Lai Tue"), boasts footage from the 1923 earthquake in Japan, as well as outdoor
shots of 1920s Paris. Live accompaniment will be provided by pianist Bruce Loeb.
The opening night gala, with a reception following the screening, is the showing of a re
discovered silent screen gem, "Love and Duty" (1931), directed by Bu Wancang (Richard
Poh). Starring Ruan Lingyu — known as "the Greta Garbo of China" — and Jin Yan (Ray
mond King) the film is an examination of thwarted but enduring young love in 1930s Shang
hai. Harking back to the festival's roots, the screening will be held in Chinatown. It will be
accompanied by a nine-piece orchestra performing an original score by local saxophonist
and composer John Yi.
A bountiful collection of Bay Area filmmaking includes Hiro Narita's "Isamu Noguchi:

Stone and Paper" on the artist and sculptor. "Fins
and Noodles" is the true story of a quest for good
health and good food by Arnold Iger and Paul Kwan.
Among the short films and videos are Anita Chang's
"One Hundred Eggs a Minute," Maria Luisa Men
donca and Medea Benjamin's "Islands on Fire,"
Michael Arag's "Silencio," Clifford Lui's "B" and Ra
Sek's "Get Off Your Koot!" These are featured in the
individual programs "Fate No More," "On Fire,"
"Cowgirl and the Man," "Asians from Uranus" and
"Tell It Like It Is," respectively.
The entire filmography of internationally
renowned Korean director Jang Sun Woo is being
shown at the festival, beginning with his latest

drama, "A Petal," which traces the wanderings of a 15-year-old girl after she survives the
massacre of Kwangju (the 1980 military assault on civilian protesters). The other intelligent,
haunting films to his credit are: "Age of Success," a fable of capitalism foiled; "Hwa Om
