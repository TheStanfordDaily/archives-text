# "Sunsets" directors tell it like it is
## 
### 
Friends, roommates and co-directors Michael Idemo
to and Eric Nakamura spoke to Intermission from
their home in Southern California to give a candid,
behind-the-scenes glimpse of indie filmmaking.
Idemoto, who also stars in the film, grew up in Wat
sonville, Calif., which happens to be the setting for "Sun
sets." You can be sure that his hometown is making a big
hoopla over their local boy made good. Idemoto calls his
film "the black sheep of the festival" because it was made on
the lowest budget of all the showcased films and has a "bad
time slot" (Sunday, opposite another feature).
Nakamura was a former employee of Larry Flvnt (no, he
didn't do pornography) and is now the owner and publisher of
an Asian punk rock culture magazine called "Giant Robot."
Intermission: What was your previous involvement with the Na
tional Asian American American Telecommunications Associa
tion and with the San Francisco Asian American Film Festival?
Idemoto: This is my first.
Nakamura: I had a film shown in "92 or '93. It was an eight
minute super-8 film made for less than $100.1 also interned
[with NAATA],
I: You can make a film for $100?
Nakamura: (laughs) There are lots of films made for less
than that!
I: What are your thoughts about "breaking into" the media as
an Asian American?

Nakamura: I have no thoughts about it. That's a limiting
ghettoization. Why can't we be known just as filmmakers,
rather than Asian filmmakers?
I: As a minority, do you feci an obligation to portray your cul
ture in a certain light?
Nakamura: No.
1: The festival program describes "Sunsets" as "a fascinating
portrait of race in a coming-of-age film." I didn't find that to be
the case. Did I miss something?
Nakamura: No, [race] isn't an issue. That's NAATA's posi
tion. We didn't write it (the program review of "Sunsets").
/; Why were there no sympathetic female characters in the
film?
Nakamura: I don't know.... It wasn't necessary to the story.
It's just about three guy friends. It's not like we're going to
add female characters just for the sake of having them.
I: How autobiographical is the film?
Idemoto: It's not. It's inspired by life, but it's fictional.
; Are you trying to make a statement about suburban life?
Idemoto: No, it's just how I grew up.
/: How does your family feel about the film?
Idemoto: Everybody asks me that: 'How true is the story?'
My family hasn't seen it. They're hesitant but curious.
They're still proud, though.
Nakamura: You know, 1 don't think they've sat down and
seen it. I don't know if they'll like it or not.
I: Do you think first -hand experience is absolutely necessary

for writing material, or can your imagination be used in creat
ing it?
Idemoto: (vehemently) Yes, you need experience.
Nakamura: I think for your first film, yeah. You're more fa
miliar with your material, you're more honest, you know
what I mean? Until you're a good writer, it's best for starting
filmmakers to work on other people's productions.
/: If you were offered a well-paid but uncreative job in Holly
wood, would you take it?
Idemoto (laughs): Yes, I don't have a job right now.
Nakamura: If it paid really well. Money talks. ... It depends
on what I'd have to give up.
/: What are your future plans?
Idemoto: Well, it took us two years to make this. It's nn first
and last indie. It took a lot out of me and out of Eric, too. I'm
broke. I'll make more films... .This is all I want to do.
Nakamura: Maybe make another [film). And if we can,
not spend our own money. It's been really hard. We've
learned a lot of lessons on how to be efficient with our
money. Where to spend it and where to save. We did it
with the lowest possible budget. It was me and my cousin.
We didn't have a real crew. The sound mike was taped to a
stand, literally, because we couldn't find help and we
didn't pay anyone. We saved for a long time | three years]
to make this film. It's hard, but if people can keep that
focus for a long time. . . . How many people can say they
made a movie? O
