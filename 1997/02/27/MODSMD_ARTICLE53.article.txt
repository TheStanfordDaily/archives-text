The title of Cedar Walton's latest release, "Com
poser," is well deserved for a man who has com
posed some of the most popular tunes in the mod
ern jazz repertoire. Unlike jazz standards that have
been played to death, like "The Girl from Ipanema"
or "All the Things You Are," Walton's "Mosaic" and
"Bolivia" have retained their vitality after countless
performances. The nine new compositions on
"Composer" prove that Walton, with more than
three decades of composing under his belt, contin
ues to write beautiful, sophisticated music.
But let's not forget that Walton is not only an el
egant composer — he is an outstanding piano play
er. We're talking about a guy who made his name
playing with some of the fattest cats in jazz history;
if the names Art Blakey, J. I. Johnson, Sonny Rollins
and Wayne Shorter mean anything to you.
Now, after years of playing with these giants,
Walton has turned to the younger generation of
cats, featuring on this recording an impressive
backup band of "young lions" (as they're frequent
ly called) headed by the virtuosic bassist, Christian
Mcßride. Even so, I'd have to say that Walton plays
with a soulful edge that these younger players lack.
Mcßride and Co. are polished musicians but far too
polished for my taste. Playing all the right notes
doesn't necessarily mean that the playing is good,
especially in jazz, which defies any conventions of
right and wrong harmonies.
While Walton drives his solos off-road every
once in a while, not one of his young band mem
bers leaves the highway. Toward the end of the
recording 1 was praying that one of them would do
something wild, like make his horn squeak or

squawk or even flatulate by blowing too much
wind, but alas, such a delightful surprise never
happened. Don't they realize that "mainstream
jazz" is an assault on jazz music itself, which is
founded on a heritage of experimentation and in
novation?
Mcßride and Co. should stop listening to candy
jazz and start listening to Miles Davis or Duke
Ellington for that matter. They might be known as
"young lions," but the reputation doesn't help
much when their roar is but a cat's meow.
Despite these problems, I still enjoy listening
to Walton's recording for the compositions and
his own playing. Tunes like "Martha's Prize" and
"Minor Controversy" have rich harmonies hard
ly rivaled anywhere else in jazz. Something
unique about Walton's compositions is their
playful counterpoint, which creates a musical
question and answer. Usually the right hand
poses the question and the left responds subtly in
the piano's lower register. It's this kind ofdelicate
playing that makes me wish Walton would pro
duce a solo piano album.
Walton's performance with the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra next week is a great opportunity to sec
one of the great jazz composers and pianists of our
time. Besides, if it's true that all art aspires to the
condition of music, then all great music aspires to
live performance.
