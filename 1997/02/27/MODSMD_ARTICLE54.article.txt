# UPAND COMING FOLKSTER VISITS ST. MIKE'S
## 
### 
Music soothes the most savage of beasts. Lilting melodies and
tempestuous rhythms is the balm that eases Matt Nathanson's soul.
A rakish up-and-coming folk singer from Boston, he will be playing at
St. Michael's Alley in downtown Palo Alto.
With a musical style influenced by Ani DiFranco, Fiona Apple, the Indi
go Ciirls and U2, Nathanson's music is an eclectic mix of traditional grass
roots folk, with lots of energy and attitude.
"Music is always something I've wanted to do," Nathanson said. "When I
listen to music, I'm lilted to the highest place I've ever been.... It makes me bub
ble with idiocy."

In fact, his love of music is so great that he began playing guitar at the age of six.
"Acoustic music was the best way to get across what I wanted to say. There's
nothing to interfere with your words. . . . It's the most base way to communication," said
Nathanson, who went to college so he could learn more about the words that make the
lyrics.
"I majored in English and world literature at Pitzer College so I could learn how words
could be used to the best of their ability," he said. "I did it all for music and all through college I
worked in the field."
Notwithstanding Nathanson's personal love of music, people should go see him because "it's pret
ty lonely to play to no one," he said. "I have a blast most of the time I play. Hey, I would have fun going
to see me.. . . It's like an intimate get-together."
What should be especially appealing to a Stanford audience is that he "likes to make the listeners laugh and

think."
With a nose-ring inspired by the Skid Row guitar player that Nathanson feels gives him a "zany factor," he
says he does not usually enjoy stirring up controversy — although you never know.
"Perhaps I should get naked and run around this cafe, and kiss the boy at the counter," suggested Nathanson. "1 am
a big fan of sexuality, whether it be gay, lesbian or hi. I'm into it all."
After spending four years at a boarding school, his attitude is not surprising. Nathanson continued his education
after high school, even though his ambition was to play music, because his parents demanded that he go.
"My mother never went to college, so she really wanted me to go," he said. "Besides the music scene at colleges is always ex
citing."
Nathanson himself will contribute to the "lively college music scene" with his concert tomorrow night.
"Music makes me glad to be alive, to be a part of this earth, to be getting up in the morning," he said.
With that intensity of passion, Nathanson's show is bound to entertain and excite. The beast inside him will thank you.
