The hottest rap releases of late all point to
the late Tupac Shakur, a veritable pariah for
West Coast rap fans. Despite his recent death
in Las Vegas, the charismatic celebrity is at the
center of three very strong new releases.
The soundtrack to "Gridlock'd" (Death
Row / Interscope), released this week, has
been gaining the most attention. Recorded
shortly before Shakur's untimely death,
"Gridlock'd" features some very powerful
tracks by the rapper, including "Never Had a
Friend Like Me" and "Wanted Dead or Alive,"
a duet with Snoop Doggy Dogg. Tupac's per
formance as a heroine addict in the "Grid
lock'd" movie has been receiving considerable
praise.
In reverence to Shakur's influence on rap
music comes "West Coast Had Bovz II," an all
star compilation of music coordinated by No
Limit Records President Master P. Leading the
dedication is the Westside Connection, the re
cent heavyweight team of Ice Cube, Mack 10
and WC, who blasted onto the scene with
their self-aggrandizing anthem, "Bow Down."
On "Bad Boyz II,"the Westside Connec
tion leads a charge with a somewhat megalo
maniacal West Coast lyrical paradigm. Other
"Bad Boyz" include such California rap per

sonalities as Rappin' 4-Tay, M.C. Eiht, C-80,
and Master P himself, affectionately named
the Ice Cream Man.
As if Shakur's posthumous power wasn't
grand enough, his recent solo album has also
been dominating record sales. Assuming the
somewhat control-oriented moniker of
"Makaveli" on his last solo release, Shakur's
"The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory"
(Death Row / Interscope), features a throng of
un released powerplays.
While the rest of the rap community has
been looking toward Tupac, recent releases
from the New York area are also cause for cel

ebration. Entering the party with perhaps the
loudest costume is Redman, who recently
dropped "Muddy Waters" (Def Jam/RAL)
onto a comparatively polite rap community.
Redman is known for blasting the micro
phone with outlandish braggadocios, ridicu
lous postulations and seemingly unfath
omable scenarios. Hailing from Newark, N.J.,
this uncouth member of the Def Squad enjoys
splashing grape juice at white weddings,
smoking weed at final exams and bringing
home once-innocent dates way past curfew —
all themes of his songs. On "Muddy Waters,"
producer Erick Sermon has done much to

continue Redman s style of low bass, funk-era
instrumentals. Look for "Whateva Man to
lead the excitement on his latest.
Funkmaster Flex, the New York wizard ot
the turntable, has recently ignited imagina
tions with "60 Minutes of Funk: Ihe Mix
Tape Volume 11." This virtual free-for-all ot
New York rap talent is quite a rap shindig,
featuring everybody who's anybody on the
Fast Coast rap scene. Receiving the most
adulation are new tracks by Nas, Yvette
Michele, Mary J. Blige, Notorious 8.1.G. and
Foxy Brown.
Also creating ripples of influence from his
turntables is the pioneering deejay behind ( \
press Hill, l)J Muggs. His latest release, "Soul
Assassins," features input from Dr. Dre, Mobb
Deep and members of the Wu-Tang I lan.
For "Old School hip-hop tans, Rhinos
"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash,
Melle Mel and The Furious Five" is quite a
delicacy. Part of a collection Rhino re-releases
(including a mountainous box set), "Adven
tures" delves into some ot Flash's less famous
tracks and extended remixes. Special songs
include "Jesse," "Internationally Known and
"Vice," based on the Miami Vice theme song.
The result is a nostalgic rewind, an enjovable
visit to rap's humble beginnings.
And of course, vet another throwback lies
in "When We Were Kings," the soundtrack to
the film and a tribute to the once-proud box
ing heavyweight Muhammad Ali.
Upcoming releases promise to create a tastv
couple of months ahead. Heavy D, the classic
creator of dance floor energy, is poised to re
lease "Waterbed Hev" in late March. Also, stav
alert for new releases by the Alkaholiks,
(iangstarr and the Boogiemonsters.
