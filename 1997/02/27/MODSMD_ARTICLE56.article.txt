## Big Head Todd & the Monsters "Beautiful World" 
### 
Boom boom boom! Just like this classic
blues track on their new album, Big Head Todd
& the Monsters kick off the opening song, "Res

ignation Superman," all fired up. This is the
kind of song you'll want to turn up in your car
to that point just before your ears begin to hurt.

Those familiar with this Col
orado-based group will instantly
recognize Todd Park Mohr's
soulful voice and lyrics in the
new album "Beautiful World."
The album quickly progresses
into the sweet melancholy songs
about lovin' and matters of the
troubled heart with "Caroline"
and "Crazy Mary." Track six,
"Please don't tell her," sounds
reminiscent of the excellent song
"It's Alright."
For those who aren't familiar
with the group, you're probably
asking what the hell kind of name
is Big Head Todd & the Mon
sters? Does it indicate a mental
condition or perhaps an ego
problem? The answer would def
initely be no, considering the last
thing the band would want is to
become superstars. They do not
play at huge amphitheaters or
cater to MTV by recording nu
merous rock videos; rather, they
have the mellow attitude, "We're
doing this so we can go out and
play music and drive around," as
drummer Brian Nevin writes in a
press release. The band's name
was in fact derived from Todd's

influences including Lightnin' Hopkins, Albert
Collins and Eddie "Clean Head" Vinson.
Amid these legendary bluesman we find
John Lee Hooker, who makes a guest appear
ance' on "Beautiful World." The band teams up
with Hooker to "shoot you down" with an ex
cellent rendition of "Boom Boom." The band
would often cover this song in concert in their
earliest years, and "Boom Boom" displays
Todd's understanding of the blues as well as
how to improvise on the guitar like nobody's
business.
Listening closely, one will discover that
the trio has expanded by adding a key
boardist and female background vocalist.
The necessity of these additions is question
able considering that the band's most im
pressive aspect is its excellent live perfor
mances. Willi more than 1,500 concerts to
this day, the singer / guitarist, bassist and
drummer trio continue to hold audiences in
awe. For the most pari, the organ just clouds
the intricate interaction between the existing
instruments. On the other hand, the addi
tional vocalist isa nice touch, givinga gospel
like feeling on tracks such as "If you can't
slow down."
Overall, Big Head Todd's fifth album dis
plays a broad spectrum of styles, from funk to
R&B to rock with a Southern twang — a great
album that captures the varied sounds from
their past albums and adds to them. But to re
ally appreciate the talent of Todd Park Mohr,
get thee to his concerts.
