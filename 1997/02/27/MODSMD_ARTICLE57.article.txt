# Infinite Zero
## "Sampler Vi 1997" 
### 
The Infinite Zero sampler is a collection of
rare funk, rock and blues songs dating back to
the late 19605. Everything under the sun is
found on this one, including live perfor
mances, sitar, instrumental, fusion and poet
ry recital.
Pop music by Devo and Monks kicks off
the album. Both groups crank out 2 songs
powered by cheesy catchy drum beats and
synthesizers. The Devo tracks, "Through
Being Cool" and "Jerkin Back 'n' Forth" are
bouncy grooves found on the band's fourth
release, "New Traditionalists." While Devo is
the more familiar of the groups, Monks is the
more outrageous and exciting. These Monks
tunes are carried by a solid rhythm / lead
guitar, percussion, organ and, yes, an electric
banjo guaranteed to kick off any party.
Funk is brought to the sampler by James
Chance and Trouble Funk. Trouble Funk, like
the great musicians of the genre, hit you fast
with excellent vocals and a blasting horns sec
tion. "So Early in the Morning" is sustained by
improvisation and congo drums, while "Super
Grit" features a strong slap bass, more diverse
sounds and change-ups in the rhythm. James
Chance sings Brit-pop vocals while relying
heavily on guitar and a spastic saxophone.

Flipper and Gang of Four are the punk
rockers of the sampler. Flipper sounds much
like a forefather of Sonic Youth, incorporating
lots of cymbals and feedback in its sound.
Gang of Four sounds not unlike a band you'd
expect to find on the "Trainspotting" sound
track — "Ether," its single contribution to the
sampler, is drenched in psychedelic duet vocals
and trippy guitar.
The second half of the album is more laid
back than the first, featuring the blues guitar of
solo artist Mississippi Fred McDowell. His cut
on the sampler,"Highway 61," is from his 1969
album, "Live from the Mayfield Hotel." Ice
berg Slim recites poetry to a background of
slow drums, bass and electric guitar; the result
is interesting listening for about 30 seconds —
it gets dull quickly.
"Circular Temple #1," the most risque song
on the album, is performed by the Matthew
Shipp Trio. The group is composed of a pi
anist, a bassist and a drummer. Shipp's piano is
unbelievable; it is pounded, caressed, tapped
and driven into a unique realm of sound.
Alan Vega and Tom Verlaine pick up the
tempo of the sampler with "Rover" and "Mr.
Blur," respectively. Both include sound ele
ments reminiscent of Tom Petty and U2 but

put their own spin on mid-tempo guitar rock.
The sampler, like all recordings of various
artists, has its high points and low points —
but it's definitely worth listening to.
