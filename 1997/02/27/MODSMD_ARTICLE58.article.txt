# The 						Butterclub
## "Junkies and Heroes" 
### 
With its first full-length release, The
Butterclub has crafted a sensuous and
textured album of mostly acoustic
grooves. "Junkies and Heroes" is a nice
exploration of the ballad format, with
each of the seven songs on the disc of
extended length and complemented by
lyrics addressing standard serious is
sues like love and relationships. Unfor
tunately, there is no real individualiza
tion or variation to the sound of each
song — most tracks on this album
begin to resemble each other.
What The Butterclub does best is
layer the sounds of rhythmic acoustic
guitars and simple drum and bass lines
with surreal string arrangements and
country-influenced steel pedal guitar.
Into this mix is thrown gravely vocalist
Rhett O'Neil's half-sung, half-spoken
lyrics. O'Neil treats his charismatic
voice as an instrument, and it plays
nicely off of the ethereal acoustic
grooves the band supplies.
But there is nothing brilliantly orig
inal about this Miami-based band's
sound. It takes its name — and driving
musical influence — from the idea of
creating a "smooth mix" of sounds, a
fusion of genres of sorts, says frontman
O'Neil on the band's World Wide Web
site (www.peermusic.com). But the
sound was already popularized by
bands such as The Cowboy Junkies and
Leonard Cohen, both of whom wrote
more intensely gripping lyrics than
O'Neil.
What does distinguish "Junkies and
Heroes" from those predecessors is its
mostly up-tempo pace. Songs like
"Share," "Born 111," "I Ain't Anyone"
and "So Lonely" approach folk rock.
And even the mellow "Despite the
Ways" picks up slightly in the middle
before slowing as it ends.
But I got tired of hearing the same
instrumental sensibilities on each
track. There is almost no exploration
or variation of what the instruments
can do — guitars played floaty riffs and
drums set down 4/4 beats all the way
through. What disappointed me most
was the almost inexcusable, juvenile
repetition of central lyrics in the first
two songs on the album, "Share" and
"Hunger."
The honest emotion present behind
the creation of the music on this album
deserves respect. In a sense it is an ex
periment to make an album without
varied sounds, but that's just not a very
engaging idea for the listener. Howev
er, the consistent sound of this album is
the sound of The Butterclub, and in
that sense the album succeeds well.
