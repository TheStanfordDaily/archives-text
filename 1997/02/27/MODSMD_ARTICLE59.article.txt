# Veruca Salt
## "Eight Arms To Hold You" 
### 
Born and bred for post-alternative
radio, Veruca Salt doesn't have an uncom
mercial bone in its collective body. It serves
up fluffy power-chord pop with enough
teen-girl angst to sound legit. Telegenic
frontwomen Nina Gordon and Louise Post
are the type of rock stars that Sassy maga
zine tends to deify — sexy and assertive but
generally nonthreatening to the preteen
set.
Its first album, "American Thighs," had
a minor hit in "Seether," but Veruca Salt
spent most of the album wallowing in
post-pubescent depression. However,
after extensive touring, a few hair-color
changes and an amusing exercise in punk
credibility (the Steve Albini-produced
album "Blow It Out Your Ass, It's Veruca
Salt"), the band has decided it's finally
time to turn it up to 11 and rock out. The
result is a new album, "Eight Arms To
Hold You," which comes dangerously
close to establishing Veruca Salt as the
Vixen of the '90s.
Full of self-consciously glam-rock
moves, "Eight Arms" is the kind of album
that would have made a bundle if it had
been released 10 years ago, when angst was
more of a novelty than a staple of pop

music. Gordon and Post unfortunately still
miss the comfort in being sad, and their
weakness for angst turns out more bad
songs than good ones; slow tracks like
"Shutterbug" and "Earthcrosser" grind
away without much of a point. To their
credit, though, "Straight" kicks off the
album in fine furious style, and "One Last
Time" meanders around quietly before
reaching a thrilling crescendo in the cho
rus.
"Don't Make Me Prove It"and "With
David Bowie," the best songs on the
album, are prime examples of Veruca
Salt's new party-hearty attitude. But it
even takes its rock-chick image a bit too
seriously on "Awesome" and the first sin
gle "Volcano Girls," odes to the singers
that devolve into lame inside-jokery.
Aside from a few nostalgia kicks — the
intro to "Sound of the Bell" takes its wa
tery guitar sound from old Cure singles —
there's too much downtime on "Eight
Arms" for it to be worthwhile. And be
sides, nostalgia is a double-edged sword,
especially when you're trying to stage a
hair-metal revival. Most of us would pre
fer to forget that part of our lives.
