# Tours, performances to highlight weekend
## Number of visitors expected to top 1,500 in annual Parents' Weekend on the Farm 
### Grace Chen 
More than 1,500 parents have
registered for Parents' Weekend '97,
and more are expected to arrive to
morrow, increasing attendance for
the event by at least 500 from last
year.
Parents' Weekend Coordinator
Ann Guss, who also planned last
year's Parents' Weekend, has been
working vigorously since September
to prepare the program with the help
of various groups on campus.
Regarding the large turnout,
Guss said, "We had a World Wide
Web site this year, and many parents
chose to go to the Web site and regis
ter online. ... With two-thirdsofthe
parents attending (being freshman

parents], it's hard to tell why there is
such an increase this year."
She also added that the Universi
ty stressed communication with par
ents. "We hope that this is just part
of the effort of parents to participate
in their kids' education."
Parents will have the opportunity
to see firsthand what their children
do at Stanford through tours and re
ceptions and bv attending classes.
The President's Office has added
several new tours to the two-day pro
gram, including a nature walk
around the Inner Quad, a hike to the
Dish and a tour of the Gates Com
puter Science Building. Tour guides
at Gates will be showing the distance
