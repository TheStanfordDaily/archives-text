### Grace Chen 
More than 1,500 parents have
registered for Parents' Weekend '97,
and more are expected to arrive to
morrow, increasing attendance for
the event by at least 500 from last
year.
Parents' Weekend Coordinator
Ann Guss, who also planned last
year's Parents' Weekend, has been
working vigorously since September
to prepare the program with the help
of various groups on campus.
Regarding the large turnout,
Guss said, "We had a World Wide
Web site this year, and many parents
chose to go to the Web site and regis
ter online. ... With two-thirdsofthe
parents attending (being freshman

parents], it's hard to tell why there is
such an increase this year."
She also added that the Universi
ty stressed communication with par
ents. "We hope that this is just part
of the effort of parents to participate
in their kids' education."
Parents will have the opportunity
to see firsthand what their children
do at Stanford through tours and re
ceptions and bv attending classes.
The President's Office has added
several new tours to the two-day pro
gram, including a nature walk
around the Inner Quad, a hike to the
Dish and a tour of the Gates Com
puter Science Building. Tour guides
at Gates will be showing the distance
learning classroom setup in the
Hewlett-Packard Auditorium and
hope to give demonstrations in virtu
al reality and in robotics.
"We didn't expect to have such a
great response," said Peche Turner,
who is in charge of the tour at the
Gates Building. "We were expecting
about 20 parents and so far 130 have
registered."
Other new activities include a "re
ception for parents who are Stanford
alumni," and the "Parents-Meet-
Parents" reception, which will allow
visitors to meet staff from the Office
of Student Affairs and will show par
ents the work of several student per
formance groups.
Parents will also be able to see stu
dents in the arts at Memorial Audito
rium when Everyday People, Stan
ford Taiko and Ballet Folklorico per

form, following a student panel called
"Finding Your Passion," which will
showcase how four students decided
on their majors.
Parents will have the opportunity
to attend lectures with their children
or go to their own lectures. Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga, one of the
11 professors who will be speaking
on topics of current interest, has a
lecture on "Race, Rights and Oppor
tunity: Rethinking Affirmative Ac
tion."
"Some parents are positive and
others are questioning, but they're
a different sort of audience with
different experiences to bring up,"
Fraga said. "I try to get the par
ents to see issues in the way a
scholar would see them. It's a lot of
fun."
Residence halls have also planned
receptions for parents to meet the
staff and ask questions. The staff at
Roble said they hope to engage the
parents in some singing with
karaoke.
