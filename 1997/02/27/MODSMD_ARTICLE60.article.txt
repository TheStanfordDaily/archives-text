# "When We Were Kings"
## soundtrack 
### 
Muhammad Ali was much more than just
a boxer — through sheer force of will, an in
defatigable sense of pride and a healthy dose
of arrogance, he became a legend and hero.
"When We Were Kings," a recently re
leased documentary, tells the story of his gut
siest and greatest triumph, the famous "Rum
ble in the lungle" against George Foreman.
The 1974 fight, held in Zaire, was important
not just because it was a remarkable upset and
Ali's greatest victory but because Ali trans
formed the event into a defiant statement of
black power.
The soundtrack celebrates this sense of
pride and power by effectively meshing
recordings from the concert that was held
alongside the fight with modern artists such
as the Fugees, as well as quotes and crowd
chants from the event.
The Fugees, along with A Tribe (Called
Quest, Busta Rhymes and Forte, start the set
off with "Rumble in the Jungle," a seething,
angry declaration of black pride that hails
Muhammad Ali as a "ghetto messiah."
The Fugees employs its typical laconic,
cinematic style, A Tribe Called Quest is witty
and intelligent, and Busta Rhymes, as always,
is a ball of frenetic energy — something be
tween the Tasmanian devil and Randy
"Macho Man" Savage.
The real focus of the soundtrack is the con
cert that accompanied the fight, which fea
tured performances by such greats as 8.8.
King, lames Brown, the Spinners, Bill Withers

and the Jazz Crusaders.
Bill Withers starts out with a searing
blues / funk medley of "Ain't Got No Sun
shine" and "You," which transforms from a
ballad to an angry condemnation of society's
hypocrisy.
James Brown is not quite up to form, but
he still manages to be amazing. "The Pay
back" roils with menace and features an eerie
call and response between Brown and a
woman who sounds as if she is undergoing an
exorcism. His "Gonna Have a Funky Good
Time" is just that.
The highlight of the show, however, is 8.8.
King's performance, in which he demon
strates repeatedly why he is the king of the
blues guitar. "I Got Some Help I Don't Need'
is both humorous and beautiful, and his
"Sweet Sixteen" is absolutely sublime. The
guitar work is sensitive and supple, and his
voice stretches and yowls with soul.
Unfortunately the album is marred by a
few lame songs at the end. Brian McKnight
and Diane King contribute the film's listless
title track, an over-produced ballad that
sounds like a "Lion King" reject, while Zelma
Davis does a completely unnecessary remake
of "Say It Loud, I'm Black and Proud," which
turns it into soulless techno.
On the whole, "When We Were Kings" is a
great soundtrack, with an excellent set of
songs which cohere into a powerful state
ment.
