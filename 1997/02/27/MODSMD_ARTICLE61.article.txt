# Reggae Cowboys
## "Tell the Truth" 
### 
Well, I've been harping all year about how
nothing original is coming out of the music
industry nowadays (at least not in the CDs
I've been reviewing), and now, when 1 find
something that is refreshingly new, it ends up
being a huge disappointment.
The Reggae Cowboys are exactly what
they sound like, a group of reggae musicians
who play so-called "cowboy" music. When I
say "cowboy" I do not mean country — I
mean straight-up twangy, horse-riding,
home-on-the-range serious cowboy stuff.
A novel concept indeed, but I'm not sure
it's a combination that should be allowed to
exist. If you can imagine Bob Marley singing
"Rawhide," you might get a sense of what this
group is about. Then you might wonder how
and why anyone ever came up with music
like this.
Not only is the group trying to be musi
cally innovative, but it seeks to make a polit
ical statement as well. The title song, "Tell
the Truth," makes commentary on black in
volvement in the settlement of the Wild
West.
The inside cover sports pictures of real
black cowboys "Bull Doggin' " Bill Pickett
and champion roper "Deadwood Dick."
From this standpoint the album is a rather

noble effort to recognize the contributions of
blacks in the old West.
In the end, however, the Cowboys offer
little more than a novelty of musical silli
ness. With songs like "Searchin' for de Out
law," "Cowboy Riddim," and"Run U Outta
Dodge," the band tries too hard lo put you in
the mood, beating you over the head with its
blatant combination of reggae vocals with
Hollywood-inspired lyrics like "Billy rode
into Red Creek, the threat was real / He
came to face the stranger with eyes as cold as
steel."
Despite the courage it took to put some
thinglike this together, the album is musical
ly formulaic, using the same rhythm and
harmony parts for almost every song. Even
the attempt at the Eagles' hit "Hotel Califor
nia" is smashed into this mold and butchered
beyond recognition.
The album could be fun if it weren't trying
to be so righteous, but these musical outlaws
take themselves very seriously and have a just
cause in mind.
Unfortunately, the legitimacy of the cause
is lessened by the illegitimacy of the musical
talent. Sorry guys, but you're just not good
enough.
