## In Love and War All's Fair in Love and War 
### 
Words to describe Ernest Hemingway—tender, naive,
consumed by love. Somehow, director Richard Attenbor
ough's "In Love and War" convincingly portrays Heming
way as more than a brilliant, heavy drinking, gangrenous
writer. In fact, only moments of the film are dedicated to
the stereotypical Hemingway character.
Based on Hemingway's experiences with the American
Red Cross in Italy during World War I, "In Love and War"
is a simple love story with Chris O'Donnell as Hemingway
and Sandra Bullock as his nurse and lover, Agnes von
Kurowsky. The film gracefully tells the story of Heming
way's maturation from naive "kid" to tortured man.
O'Donnell handles the transition with focus and sub
tlety. He proves that he can tackle more than troubled
prep-school and Bat boys. He is as equally convincing as a
novice reporter interviewing Italian troops in the trench
es as he is as an angry drunk attempting to drown out his
pain.
O'Donnell glows in his scenes with Bullock. In an "Age
of Innocence"-like scene, Agnes counts linens as Heming
way playfully rubs her ankle. Attenborough emphasizes
their romantic chemistry as he juxtaposes images of Agnes
dancing with Hemingway against those of Agnes dancing
with an Italian doctor.
Bullock and Mackenzie Astin round out O'Donnell's
performance. Bullock is restrained as the nurse who sup
posedly changes Hemingway. Her careful fecial expres
sions, especially in a scene where Agnes slaps him for

being out of line, are a reminder that she can be more than
just the girl next door.
Astin is precious as the lovesick Henry Villard As his
Villard and Hemingway battle for Agnes' affections, he
brings life to a semi-dull role.
"In Love and War" captures the excitement and the
quest for adventure that many American boys brought
across the sea during World War I, as well as the carnage
and despair that comes with war. O'Donnell's Hemingway
admits that he went to Italy searching for something — be
that adventure or love. Although the battle scenes are brief
but grandiose, this is really a movie about how relation
ships are affected by war.
The film breaks down from time to time, though. It
hovers over the cliff of sappiness and really tests the audi
ence's suspension of disbelief as Hemingway changes from
a carefree to heavily burdened character.
There is also a problem with the feet that there is sup
posed to be an eight-year age gap between the two main
characters, making Hemingway only 19 years old. Yet Bul
lock and O'Donnell look the same age. Attenborough,
however, repeatedly has his characters discuss their age
difference and whether it is too great of a span.
On the whole, Attenborough stitches together a film
that is very much like the quilt that blankets young Hem
ingway's bed — made of love, war, friendship and both
the beauty and pain of war-torn Italy.
