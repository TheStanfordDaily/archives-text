# Absolute Power
## 
### 
"Last night, the wife of Washington
billionaire Walter Sullivan was shot to
death by two secret service agents. Since
then, it has been revealed that the presi
dent of the United States, one of Sullivan's
closest friends, was having an affair with
her. . . ."
This might have been the top story on
CNN, but in this case it's just a scene from
Clint Eastwood's latest movie, "Absolute
Power."
This terrific suspense picture starts out
at a fast pace. Notorious burglar Luther
Whitney (Eastwood) is in the middle of a
major jewelry theft at the Sullivan estate,
his first in quite some time. During the
burglary, he is unfortunate enough to
witness the murder of Mrs. Sullivan.
The man who is indirectly responsible
for the murder turns out to be President
Richmond (cheating on his wife, no less),
played by Gene Hackman. Not surpris
ingly, the murder of the woman is covered
up by the president's bodyguards and his
chief of staff.
A crucial piece of evidence that is not
removed is the knife that was used in the
struggle prior to the murder. By taking
the knife with him, Whitney becomes the
target of the President's hunt to destroy
all evidence.

The theme of "Absolute Power" re
minded me of "The Fugitive": A man
must flee because he is unable to prove his
innocence.
In "Absolute Power," Whitney's
daunting task is to convince the police
that a common thief can be innocent
while the president can be guilty.
The well-developed characterization
in the film allows the actors to really show
off their skills. Ed Harris is splendid as
Seth Frank, the detective in charge of the
murder case; he adds a touch of humor to
the whole movie based on his relation
ship with Whitney. For instance, Frank
knows that Whitney was in the house the
night of the murder, but he also realizes
that Whitney is only guilty of stealing $5
million of jewelry. Whitney plays along
by telling Frank exactly how he would
have pulled off the heist, yet he never ac
tually admits to having been at the scene
of the crime.
The mutual respect between the thief
and the cop makes for a funny and un
usual twist. The biggest twist of the
movie, however, is reserved for Rich
mond and Sullivan.
If you are not sure whether to see "Ab
solute Power," don't base your decision
on the trailers because they are not ap

pealing at all. This movie is well worth
seeing.
