# Touch
## 
### 
"Touch" is not for the religiously closed-minded. A fresh,
funny and flirtatious take on the difference between religious
ness and religiosity, the movie combines the Christ figure with
T-shirts and cut-offs, religious hypocrites with surfer rock
music.
The story centers around Juvenal (Skeet Ulrich), a young
man whose touch can heal, and the con-artists and fanatics
who attempt to market him for their own causes. There is Au
gust Murray (Tom Arnold), an ultra-conservative, sexually re
pressed fanatic who sees Juvenal as the key to propelling his
very tiny "traditionalist" movement into the national fore
front. Bill Hill (Christopher Walken), an unsuccessful evange
listic entrepreneur, tries to use Juvenal as a way to make big
bucks by selling Cod. Juvenal accepts the actions of the "Phar
isees" just as he accepts all people and circumstances — with
good humor, infinite forgiveness and nonjudgmental faith.
A former Franciscan monk in the Amazon and a current
worker at the Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Center, Juvenal de
fies the concept of saint. He falls in love with Lynn Faulkner
(Bridget Fonda), a former baton twirler in Hill's church. The
two celebrate a love that is typical of any secular couple in any
Hollywood movie.
Cute satires and light-hearted spoofs of the church, its often

self-absorbed worshipers and the exploitative mass media
abound in the movie. Hill's gaudy "Thank You Jesus" gold
necktie placard was my personal favorite.
"Touch" shies away from preachiness in ways that, whether
intentionally or not, lend ambiguity to the characters and the
story itself. The beginning of the movie builds Juvenal up into
a miracle figure through the hearsay of the other characters
and his supernatural powers. The rest of the film is spent
breaking down the stereotype. After we've been convinced that
Juvenal is just an ordinary guy with a good heart and powerful
hands, the plot becomes redundant.
There is also little character development in the entire
movie. Even Lynn, who comes to know the wonderboy as the
boy next door, never ceases in her adoration of his miracle
image. Hill and Murray remain, as they probably would in real
life, convinced of their own beliefs — which neither the screen
play nor the mellow Juvenal attempt to change.
All in all, "Touch" is a movie worthy of spending seven
bucks on, although home video would also do just as well. The
mix of quirky comedy and original plot makes the movie a lot
of fun and a lot to think about at the same time. The key words
to "Touch" are fresh and unconventional.
