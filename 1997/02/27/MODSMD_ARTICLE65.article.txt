# The 						Empire Strikes Back

### 
When the "Star Wars: Special Edition" tril
ogy made its debut at the end of January, it
caught the attention of moviegoers just as the
original edition did 20 years ago. The saga con
tinues with "The Empire Strikes Back," but it's
difficult to tell whether this movie will spark
the same interest. I've always been a bit skepti
cal about "Empire" myself; of the three "Star
Wars" movies, this one has been the least excit
ing to watch on video.
A THX sound system and a movie screen
can change all that. After watching "Empire" I
realized that this is definitely the most roman
tic of the three movies, and not just because of
the cheesy lines shared by Han Solo and
Princess I^ia.
From the Battle of Hoth to the space pursuit
in an asteroid field to the final confrontation
between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, the
movie captures its audience with its sheer
grandeur. The action is kept in check by hu
morous characters such as the whining C3PO
and Vaders bumbling Imperial officers.

The scenes on Bespin and Dagobah are
nicely enhanced with both matte paintings
and new digital effects. Your imagination will
be stirred while watching Luke's X-wing lift
magically out of a swamp or a city suspended
in the clouds, just as George Lucas intended.

One of my favorite scenes in the trilogy will
forever be the one where the light from Luke's
rising ship shines on Yoda (who sounds suspi
ciously like Grover from Sesame Street) as he
ominously says, "There is another."
It seems that the original footage has been

cleaned up dramatically; "Empire" looks very
much like a modern film. Of course, it was
made with a significantly higher budget than
"Star Wars" — it was the most expensive film
of its time when it came out in 1981.
The new scenes in "Empire" have been inte
grated much more smoothly in the picture
than in "Star Wars." They simply enhance the
setting (like the added buildings in Cloud
City), or support the plot (as in Vader's trans
portation by shuttle from Bespin to his Star
Destroyer). It may be that the new scenes are
not so noticeable because the media isn't harp
ing on us to look for them as they did with
"Star Wars." We can just sit back and enjoy the
nostalgic viewing experience.
There's something special about this film
that simply can't be appreciated until you've
seen it on the big screen. 1 admit that I enjoyed
watching it even more than the special edition
of "Star Wars." Even if you've never seen "Star
Wars" before, you shouldn't miss this one.

Too bad they didn't digitally alter Luke's face.
