## That's humor 
### 
If you're sitting around on a Fri
day night, sick of going to frat par
tics that make you cry with bore
dom and in the mood for a movie
that'll make you laugh instead,
whatever you do, don't turn to Mel

Brooks' latest films. "Life Stinks,"
"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and
"Dracula: Dead and Loving It," his
most recent three, justifiably
bombed at the box office.
Many of his earlier works, howev
er, are definitely worth renting, and
the following list can serve as an ad
mittedly incomplete guideline to
the best of Mel Brooks.
"The Producers" (1968), Brooks'

first film, starring Gene Wilder and Zero
Mostel, tells the story of a boisterous con
man (Mostel), his mousy accountant
(Wilder) and their collaboration in a get
rich-quick scheme. They raise thousands
of dollars to produce a horrible play, hop
ing that it will be a flop and close in one
night — leaving them holding the cash.
Watching the gigantic Mostel intimidate a

cowering Wilder is truly a riot.
"Blazing Saddles" (1974) is perhaps one
of Brooks' most well-known films, star
ring Clevon Little and Wilder. It tells the
story of an black sheriff (Little) who at
tempts to bring order to a small town in

the Wild West and to save the town from
the evil governor Hedley Lamarr, who in
tends to build a railroad through it. Little
has what is perhaps the best line in the
film, luring two KKK members into a trap
by asking them, "Where de white women
at?"
Brooks' parody of the Frankenstein
story, "Young Frankenstein" (1974), star
ring Teri Garr, Wilder, Madeleine Kahn
and Marty Feldman is a brilliant send-up
of the monster film genre, filled with his
trademark sexual double entendres. Garr
is wonderful as the ditzy Inga, Dr.
Frankenstein's assistant, and Marty Feld
man is hilarious as the hunchbacked Igor
(pronounced Eye-gor). Perhaps Brooks'
best.
The 1981 film "History of the World,
Part 1," starring Brooks, Gregory Mines

and Kahn, chronicles (what else?) the most
important events in the world's history, in
cluding the Spanish Inquisition and the

French Revolution.
Be prepared for
plenty of childish
humor in the vein of
"Bigg us Dickus"
from "Monty
Python's Life of
Brian."
Finally, one
shouldn't forget
"Get Smart," the
television series
Brooks helped to
produce in the mid
to late '60s. The
main character
Maxwell Smart
(Don Adams), is a
Clouseau-esque spy,
bumbling around
and somehow saving
the free world.
Although Brooks'
humor is by no
means intellectual,
if you have a pen
chant for dumb vi
sual gags and occa-

sional brilliant parodies, these films
should serve you well.
