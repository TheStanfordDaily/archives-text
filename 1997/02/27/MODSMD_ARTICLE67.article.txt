Pop quiz: Does art imitate life or life imi
tate art?
Until I was 2 years old, my grandfather
thought I was mute. However, as the story
goes, once I started talking I never stopped.
My nickname was"The Talking Machine."
Two years later, my family moved to the Unit
ed States. And my voice escaped me again.
When I recall my early-childhood self, she
always sits tucked in the corner of a couch
with a book in her lap or her eyes pasted to an
animated TV screen. Too shy to play with the
others and too weak (or so she thinks) to join
in sports — it would be a long time before my
voice came back.
When I read Maxine Hong Kingston's

"Woman Warrior," my soul resonated. In one
passage, Kingston recounts a violent taunting
of a quiet Chinese classmate. "/ looked into her
face so I could hate it close up." Kingston's re
sentment towards the girl is a lashing out
against her own struggle to achieve voice. "J
could see her tiny white teeth, baby teeth. I
wanted to grow big strong, yellow teeth."
At some point, I decided to change. Like
Kingston, I wanted to shout It was a con
scious decision to act on what I had always
wished but couldn't be — to be louder and
stronger. So, I learned to speak up and hold
my ground. Later, I began to shout.
So it might seem that art imitates life. Mix
a little social phenomenon and creative inter

pretation, and you get a poignant novel. In
this case, we've accumulated a lot of pretty
and not so pretty stuff all these years. Nice but
not necessary.
I maintain art is necessary. As a social ac
tivist and an Asian American, art plays a role
far beyond the aesthetic. Art not only cele
brates (which is not to be underrated) but
validates. Each of us in our existential hole is
acknowledged and affirmed. Take that beau
tiful moment or striking thought that passes
through your mind when there's no one to
share it with you. Multiply it by a lifetime or
so. "It takes two to make truth: One to tell it,
and the other to listen."
Reading Kingston's batde against the curse

of silence, I read my own story. My seemingly
private story taken out of my own cocooned
existence into Life with a capital L Am 1 too
hubristic to feel robbed? Hell no. Am I re
lieved, inspired and encouraged to explore
my own life more artfully? Hell yeah.
Unfortunately, there are several other
worlds of experience modern America has
kept silent too long. The lives of other ethr.ic
minorities, women, gays and lesbians, dis
abled people are also fighting for their voices.
And as we read, see, hear and touch a greater
social diversity, we will expand art — and life.
In the words of Japanese-American poet
David Mura, "Social change starts in the
imagination."
