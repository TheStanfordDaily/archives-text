Please help me...
I've been in prison 16 years for a murder no one
committed. The prosecutor knowingly used perjured
testimony from jailhouse informants to convict me.
I've lost my family, my home, and almost half my
life. I have until April 23rd to file a petition
for writ of habeas corpus in federal court or I
will die in prison for a crime I didn't commit. I
need help in the following areas:
• Internet Access
• Scanning Documents
• Some Factual Investigation
• Electronic Legal Research
• Text Database
• Web Page Design/Hosting -
If you are interested in helping to save my life, please
contact me right away at:
