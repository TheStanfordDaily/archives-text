You know what always precipitates a little introspection for me? Buying new running
shoes. What other acquisition is simultaneously so exhilarating and so fraught with error?
What other situation requires such reliance on oneself? It starts when I enter the store and
feel intimidated because, well, stores intimidate me, salespeople intimidate me and sports
intimidate me. But the real moment of truth is trying on shoes — how do you ever know

uncomfortable, maybe something else would be better. What's your frame of reference?
How can you possibly know how shoes feel to other people? You're on your own on this
one. And what with Nikes running about $70 a pop, you just don't want to make a mis
take. How do you manage this periodic obstacle? Help me! Love me! Berate me for being
frivolous and bourgeois! Send your thoughts to diversions^daily.
