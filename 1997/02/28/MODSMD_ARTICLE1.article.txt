"Lift the eyebrows. Contract the
scalp. Empty the mind. Relax the eye
balls. Tongue releases away. Allow en
ergy to release out collar bones then
out the wrists...
Kate Coughlin, a campus yoga in
structor, is directing Stanford stu

dents to balance, bend, breath, stretch
and strengthen their bodies in an at
tempt to release stress through the an
cient Indian exercise, yoga.
Extremely popular in the 1970s
along with flower power and the peace
sign, yoga has made a strong comeback
on campus. Full locust, cobra and spine
twisting are among the exotic postures

that flourish on the Farm. Various dor
mitories, the Women's Center, and off
campus businesses advertise classes
offering yoga instruction.
Last year during spring quarter the
first yoga class was offered by Cough
lin. More than 100 people signed up for
a class limited to 25 people.
Coughlin, has been at Stanford for

eight years, as an aerobics
instructor. She began teaching yoga
last year after people approached her
about starting a class. Coughlin start
ed learning yoga in 1973 from a book.
Coughlin further developed her in
terest while living in Maui, Hawaii for
a couple of years and learned from var
ious yoga gurus. Her background also
includes martial arts and movement
analysis.
All forms of yoga originate from
Patanjali's yoga — named after
the man who wrote down the poses
thousands of years ago — which con
sists of eight limbs or paths leading to
ward a release from the bondage
Karma and a rebirth that is the highest
aim for many Hindus, Buddhists and
Jainists. Coughlin teaches students
two more recent forms of yoga known
as Bikram and Iyengar.
Coughlin said hatha yoga and
pranayama, the first limb, focuses on
directing energy by way of breath in
order to reach a state of physical well
being. In order to do this, she leads the
class through a series of postures,
movements and breathing exercises
meant to calm, strengthen and stretch
the body.
But Coughlin made an important
distinction. "Yoga is not about the
poses, rather, really what you are doing
is changing the dynamics of the body
