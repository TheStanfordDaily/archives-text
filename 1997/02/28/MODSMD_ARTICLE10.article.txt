Vienna Philharmonic admits first woman
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — The Vienna Philharmonic, one
of the last male-only orchestras in the world, named a
harpist as its first female member yesterday.
The decision to admit women, effective immediately,
came after a four-hour meeting of the philharmonic's musi
cians, most of whom also form the orchestra of the famed
Vienna State opera.
Anna Lelkes, a harpist in the state opera orchestra since
1974, was named a full member of the Vienna Philharmon
ic, orchestra spokesman Wolfgang Schuster said.
Schuster said the move was based on an agreement
with Peter Wittmann, the new state secretary for the arts
in Austria.
Wittman's boss, new Chancellor Viktor Klima, had vir
tually demanded the orchestra admit women.
After Lelkes, other women will get a chance to join one of
the world's most fabled orchestra, Schuster said.
The change followed months of lobbying by prominent
foreigners, particularly women musicians in the United
States, where the philharmonic goes on tour next week. The
decision appeared aimed at defusing any protests of possible
effects on ticket sales during the U.S. tour.

'Light' cigarettes found equally dangerous
ATLANTA (AP) — Smokers who switch to low-tar
cigarettes are increasingly victims of a different type of can
cer — one that reaches deeper into the lungs, according to a
study published by the American Cancer Society.
Tobacco companies have argued that nicotine levels nat
urally drop with the lower tar in cigarette brands such as
Vantage, Merit, Carleton and True. But federal health offi
cials suggest people smoke them differently, taking more
and deeper puffs to satisfy their cravings.
"This is not good news for tobacco producers or for pub
lic health," said Dr. Fabio Levi, professor of epidemiology at
the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. "We must be
very firm about the dangers of these new types of cigarettes.
They are not so light."
The Tobacco Institute in Washington, a lobbying arm of
the industry, would not comment, and Philip Morris Inc.,
which makes Merits, referred calls about the study to the
institute.
As people have switched to "light" low-tar cigarettes,
adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer which attacks the
tiny outer branches of the lungs, has become more com
mon.
