# AIDS death rate falls by 13%
## Proportions of infected blacks and women rise, however 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) - AIDS deaths fell
13 percent in the first half of 1996, the
first significant drop since the epidem
ic began in 1981, the government said
yesterday. Officials credited better
treatment and programs.
"This is one of the first bright spots
we have seen in this epidemic," said
Christopher Portelli, executive director
of the National Lesbian and Gay
Health Association in Washington.
"But we hope it is seen as a call to arms
rather than a chance to relax and
breathe a sigh of relief."
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said about 22,000 people
died of AIDS in the first six months of
1996, down from the 24,900 deaths in
the same period a year earlier.
The CDC saw a slight drop in AIDS
deaths in the second quarter of 1995,
but researchers did not see it as signif
icant.
There was more good news yester
day: While the number of people diag
nosed with AIDS continues to grow,
the growth rate is slowing. In 1995,
about 62,200 people were diagnosed,

an increase of less than 2 percent over
the 61,200 new cases in 1994. The
growth rate from 1993 to 1994 was 5
percent.
The first signs of the drop in AIDS
deaths came in January, when New
York City reported a 30 percent drop in
AIDS deaths in 1996.
"I think this speaks to the success of
the dual approach of counseling, test
ing and treating people with HIV," said
Patricia Fleming, the CDC's chief of
HIV / AIDS reporting and analysis.
The CDC credits better treatment
for AIDS patients, including new
drugs, and better access to treatment
through state and federal programs.
What's still unclear is the impact of
a new class of drugs called protease
inhibitors. The AIDS death rate leveled
off in 1995, before those medicines
became widely available.
Not all doctors are sure that AIDS is
making an about-face, however.
"In my view, this decline is unfortu
nately only a lull," said Dr. Irvin S.Y
Chen, director of the AIDS Institute at
UCLA. "Not all patients are respond

ing as effectively as the majority of
patients. There are some patients for
whom the drugs are not effective."
And some advocates point out that
AIDS patients, as they live longer, will
need more help, not less.
A growing number of people are liv
ing with AIDS each year, the CDC said.
In June 1996, 223,000 Americans age
13 and older had the disease — a 10
percent jump from mid-1995 and a 65
percent increase over 1993.
As of December 1996, 581,429
Americans had been diagnosed with
AIDS since 1981: 488,300 men, 85,500
women and 7,629 children.
And some new trends are worrying
health officials. Blacks accounted for
more cases of AIDS than whites for the
first time in 1996 — 41 percent com
pared to 38 percent. Hispanics
accounted for 19 percent and other
races 2 percent.
Also, the proportion of women with
AIDS is still increasing. In 1996,
women made up 20 percent of new
cases. AIDS deaths have not declined
amone women or heterosexuals.
