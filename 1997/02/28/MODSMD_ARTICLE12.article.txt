# Stopping young smokers
## Tobacco buyers under 27 must show photo ID 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - It's official
tomorrow: If you're under age 27 and want
to buy cigarettes or chewing tobacco, you
have to produce a photo ID proving you're
old enough — at least 18.
The question is how will the govern
ment enforce the first wave of its crack
down on youth smoking.
Tobacco-friendly states North Carolina
and Virginia flip-flopped yesterday over
enforcement. In addition, the FDA still
hasn't hired state inspectors to audit
cigarette retailers' compliance. That
means, at least until summer, anti-tobac
co volunteers will have to blow the whistle
on offenders.
"It's going to take an army of citizens,"
said John Banzhaf of Action on Smoking
and Health, which is organizing thousands
of people to report suspected lawbreakers to
an FDA hotline. He plafcid' tt> send teens
early tomorrow to test the new law in Wash
ington, D.C., and suburban Virginia stores.
State laws already outlaw selling tobac

co to anyone under age 18. Yet government
figures show minors buy $1.6 billion in
tobacco annually, and 75 percent of teen
smokers say they've never been carded —
reports verified in states like Indiana,
which last summer discovered 41 percent
of stores selling tobacco to teens.
The FDA, in the first of sweeping new
tobacco regulations, ordered retailers to card
all customers younger than 27 to prevent
mature-looking minors from buying tobac
co. Store owners caught selling to teens face
federal fines of $250 per violation.
While cigarette makers say tomorrow's
change doesn't affect them, retailers pre
dicted longer lines as they card customers
who buy tobacco 26 million times a day.
But retiring FDA Commissioner David
Kessler, who leaves his post after a White
House tobacco ceremony tomorrow, stressed
thfciinpjrtanoe of thfMßtar repAiticm. 532
"It's really time ffr start taking serious
ly ai> a nation the tobacco products
to young people," Kessler said:
