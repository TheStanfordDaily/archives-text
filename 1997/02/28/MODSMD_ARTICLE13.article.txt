University must keep its
commitment to housing
undergrads for 4 years

Last year's senior class
was the first to be guaran
teed four years of on-campus
housing. When the Manzanita
complex was completed, adminis
trators assumed the housing crisis
for undergraduates would be over.
But now, with plans to increase the
undergraduate population next
fall, administrators must ensure
there will be enough housing space
for all undergraduates who want it.
To meet the target enrollment
for the coming academic year, an
additional 44 students will register
in September. The rise in the under
graduate population will be a result
of an increase in transfer students
rather than a larger freshman class.
The housing situation on campus is
already tight and both University
Housing and Residential Education
officials are considering ways to
adjust housing arrangements in
order to accommodate a larger
number of students.
One option being discussed is to
reduce the number of graduate stu
dents who live in undergraduate
housing. Currently, graduate stu
dents occupy 35 spaces in the coop
erative houses, which are primarily
undergraduate residences. While
many students feel that graduate
students are important to the co-op
communities, it seems unfair that
some undergraduates could poten
tially be denied housing because
the room they should be occupying
was given to a graduate student.
The University has promised
undergraduates four years of
housing and, accordingly, it simply
cannot opt to allow graduate stu
dents to take spots in co-ops unless
it is first clear that all undergradu
ates can be housed.
Graduate students are also liv
ing in other undergraduate resi

dents by serving in a variety of
house staff positions. Housing offi
cials must not forget those spots
when excess undergraduates are
seeking on-campus places to live.
In devising solutions to the antic
ipated housing shortage, officials
have also suggested the possibility
of converting space in undergradu
ate residences currently used for
other purposes into student rooms.
While it is admirable that the Uni
versity is willing to examine some
less-than-obvious options for
increasing dormitory space, this
alternative has some great draw
backs. Study rooms and lounges are
integral to dorm life on this campus,
and eliminating these spaces in an
effort to provide immediate addi
tional housing would be unwise.
Furthermore, as the University
continues to increase the size of its
transfer population, the housing
situation will continue to grow
tighter. Accepting more transfers
than housing allows is a practice
that cannot be accepted. It is simply
impractical and illogical to allow
this situation to grow out of hand.
Currently those undergradu
ates who stay at Stanford for more
than four years are not guaranteed
housing in their fifth year and
beyond, although housing is gen
erally available should the stu
dents desire it. Housing officials
say that as greater numbers of
transfer students enroll it will
become nearly impossible for fifth
year (or beyond) students to be
given University housing.
There are many valid reasons to
continue allowing graduate stu
dents in some undergraduate resi
dences. However, that practice is a
luxury which simply cannot be
afforded as undergraduate hous
ing becomes scarce. Although
those students who wish to live on
campus but cannot will always be
displeased, already only 50 percent
of graduate students live in on
campus housing. To be a graduate
student forced to live off campus is
not uncommon; for undergradu
ates it is unacceptable.
