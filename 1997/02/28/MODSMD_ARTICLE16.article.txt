## Risking rejection on purpose 
### 
"Hi. Um, I'm selling Girl Scout cookies
and I, um, I was wondering if, if you want
to buy some? They are $3 a box. I know
that's expensive. I mean ... you don't have
to buy any if you don't want to."
NEEDLESS TO SAY, I never won a
super-seller badge on my mortify
ing annual venture down Univer
sity Avenue. I usually managed to surpass
the two-box minimum only because my
father brought the sign-up sheet to work
and had his co-workers order and because
my mother wrote the check when those
co-workers forgot to pay. Twenty-six
boxes of Thin Mints, five Caramel Delites,
eight Shortbread. If our Girl Scout troop
hadn't dissolved in the fifth grade my par
ents would have needed to take out a loan.
My fear of rejection was so great I could
make no successful sales on my own.
"No." It may be one of the most potent
words in any language. It is the firstword
I learned to spell and the first one that
made me cry. As I tip-toed through my
public childhood and stomped through
my private one, "no" was the trauma of
my existence.
It must be fascinating to be an anthro
pologist; human beings are such a para
doxical species. Ask us to toss ourselves off
of cranes for the joy of bouncing up and
down on bungee cords and we do so will
ingly. Ask us to breathe from tanks for the
thrill of extended submergence in an ele
ment that would otherwise kill us and we

hardly hesitate. Ask us to alter our body
chemistries through any number of legal
or illegal means and we'll do it.
Yet ask us to audition for something,
and we can hardly breathe for the butter
flies. Ask us to open the envelope detail
ing the results of an interview, and we
break out in a sweat. Ask us to say the
words "I love you," not in response but in
initiation, and we nearly collapse. Physi
cal risk is thrilling. Rejection is terrifying.
Admittedly, my elementary-school self
was a bit of a human hyperbole. My
teachers affectionately nicknamed me
"Speak up!" and my second grade col
leagues euphemistically referred to me as
a "good listener." A large part of that
shyness has either been socialized out of
me or repressed. Yet the fear of emotion
al vulnerability, of putting myself in a
position where I may be embraced but I
may be rejected, has never disappeared.
It is woven somewhere into all of us.
It is generally easier to take risks on
another's behalf. That is how I finally
reconciled myself to cookie sales. I was
working, after all, for the Girl Scouts, not
for my own personal gain. And physical
risks instill fear, but of a different quali
ty than that of rejection. Morbid though
it may seem, equipment failure doesn't
reflect on one's personal worth.
It is difficult to take the risks that leave
our personalities vulnerable to rejection.
It would be anathema to most people to
tell a little girl, "Not only do I not want

your cookies but you are a bad salesperson
and I dislike you." But somehow, in the
back of my mind, that answer was tied up
with every "no, thank you." This is why I
rationalized the expected "no" from every
potential customer. So that they could
blame finances, tastes, anything but me.
I have not let my guard down entirely.
It is a rare confidence and a rare trust
that allows one person to extend them
selves that far. I seldom profess my love
or admit my loneliness. But the more I
share my feelings with people, the happi
er I find I am. The more vulnerable we
make ourselves, the more we are able to
connect with one another.
If someone leans on me, I will do
everything in my power not to let that
person fall. As I am the only yardstick of
human nature I feel qualified to use, I
can only assume that other people are
generally possessed of this same decency.
By not making myself vulnerable, I
could avert every "no, thank you." But in
so doing I would miss out on all those who
care enough about me to pay for a roomful
of overpriced cookies they never ordered.

Jocelyn Wiener, a sophomore majoring in
urban studies, believes that selling Girl
Scout cookies is as close as one can get to
combining physical risk with rejection.
