Acceptance of ROTC money alienates gays and lesbians

THE FACULTY SENATE should
review Stanford's policies with
respect to the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps for two reasons. First,
the administration appears to be ignor
ing a previous senate resolution on
ROTC. Second, Stanford's involvement
with ROTC constitutes discrimination
against gay and lesbian students, vio
lating University policy.
Despite the 1970 senate resolution
preventing students from receiving
credit for military training, Stanford
now awards academic credit for some
ROTC classes. It is unclear whether
the administration is properly follow
ing the direction of the senate. Howev
er, it is clear that Stanford is preferen
tially awarding academic credit and
financial aid to heterosexual students,
thereby discriminating against gay and
lesbian students.
Under the "don't ask, don't tell"
policy, the military openly discrimi
nates against gays and lesbians and

that discrimination occurs in ROTC
programs. The military's policy
includes revoking ROTC scholarships
from any student known to be gay.
Since "don't ask, don't tell" was
instituted in 1994, there has been a 42
percent increase in the numbei of ser
vice members discharged for homosex
uality, according to The New York
Times. A recent Service Members'
Legal Defense Network report found
the military is not attempting to treat
gays and lesbians fairly but instead
allowing "witch hunts, seizures of per
sonal diaries and threatening service
members with prison unless they
accuse others as gay."
Some have argued that gays and les
bians are allowed to take and receive
academic credit for ROTC courses. But
heterosexual students are paid thou
sands of dollars to attend these cours
es, while gay students are not. The pool
of students has been subjected to a dis
criminatory selection process before

Stanford University awards academic
credit. If Stanford started awarding
credit in a similar fashion along racial
lines, this practice would not just be
discriminatory; it would probably be
illegal.
Stanford has entered into agree
ments with three ROTC units at near
by universities. These agreements
result in a discriminatory allocation of
financial aid among Stanford students.
Openly gay Stanford students simply
can not receive an ROTC scholarship.
The University also has a long-term
policy of rejecting all donations for
scholarship aid that would be preferen
tially disbursed to gay students. This
policy does not just prevent a tradition
ally marginalized group from receiving
assistance; it alienates gay and lesbian
alumni. In fact, only last quarter an
effort to fund such a scholarship for
Graduate School of Business students
was met with resistance by the admin
istration. Stanford has entered into

agreements discriminating against gay
students but refuses to accept
resources to help those students.
Some people view this controversy as
an opportunity to attack the military. I
do not. The U.S. military is absolutely
essential to national security. All Amer
icans owe an extreme debt to those who
died or risked death defending our free
dom and democracy. ROTC is a noble
program producing officers with broad
liberal arts education.
I believe Stanford should assist the
U.S. military in its goals so long as that
assistance does not violate our mission
or divert resources from our academic
initiatives. The central mission of
Stanford is to educate students and
engage in scholarship. Access to educa
tion and participation in scholarship
must only be limited by an individual's
ability and effort. Anything else is an
abomination.
