# 'Subjective ethics' is a contradictory concept
## 
### 
In his column yesterday Jordan Gel
ber contends that, "In the end, ethical
decisions are completely subjective." I
disagree.
I do not know precisely what Gelber
means by "completely subjective," but I
will assume he means something like
this: Actions are not objectively ethical
or unethical. That is to say, an action
that is wrong to one person may be
right to a different person; there does
not exist outside the two people a single,
true definition of whether that action is
right or wrong. While I am not well
versed in philosophy, it seems to me
that one who holds that morality is
completely subjective runs into two

philosophical problems.
First, if all ethical decisions are com
pletely subjective, society has no objec
tive moral basis to put murderers and
rapists in jail. In addition, Gelber states
that "everyone has the right to make
ethical decisions, whether or not that
person is an 'ethics expert.' " While I
would certainly agree that everyone has
the right to make ethical decisions, the
real question is whether everyone has
the right to act upon their those ethical
decisions.
A murderer may claim that he, as
much as anyone, has the right to make
an ethical decision on whether murder
is right or wrong. If we hold that all eth
ical decisions are subjective then we
have no objective moral basis to put the
man in jail or even stop him from mur
dering again. We may choose to put him
in jail nonetheless, but we must be clear

that we have no objective moral grounds
for doing so, if we hold Gelber's posi
tion.
One who holds that all ethical deci
sions are completely subjective must
find a basis other than objective
morality by which to compel others to
refrain from evil actions. One basis
that some moral subjectivists fall back
on is that majority opinion makes
right — if a majority of a community
agrees on a policy, then they can legit
imately enforce it. I suspect that this
argument would be unconvincing to a
slave in Virginia in 1800, as it is to
me.
Second, one who holds that ethical
decisions are completely subjective finds
it very hard to live in the world without
contradicting him or herself. In his col
umn, Gelber implicitly says, "You, the
reader, shouldn't make ethical decisions

for other people." But in saying "you
shouldn't do this," Gelber is himself
making an ethical decision for us. Gelber
is "imposing his morality" on us. If all
ethical decisions are completely subjec
tive, Gelber has no grounds to say this.
After all, we can reply, "You have point
ed out that there is no objective right or
wrong."
It follows that while it may be wrong
for me to impose my ethical decisions on
others, I can legitimately claim that it is
right for me to do so. If one wishes to
maintain that morality is completely
subjective, then it is inconsistent to tell
others that they should or should not do
anything at all, but this is precisely what
Gelber does in his article.
Gelber's position is both problematic
and contradictory.
