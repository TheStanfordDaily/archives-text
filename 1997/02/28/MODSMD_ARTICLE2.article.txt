# Seniors asked to help with admissions

### Ben Hewlett 
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions called for involvement from
graduating seniors this week in its con
tinuing recruitment efforts to improve
outreach to potential Stanford stu
dents.
The Admissions Alumni Involve
ment Program has two primary goals,
according to Admission Alumni In
volvement Coordinator Holly Haley
Knapp. "The first goal is to enhance re
cruitment and enrollment of students
to Stanford, and the second is to
strengthen the connection between the
University and recent alumni," she
said.
Such use of alumni is new to Stan-

ford, Knapp said. "Up
to about two years ago,
we were not using
alumni to participate
with us in the admis
sions process," shel
said. "We really feltj
like we were missingl
the boat and not mak-|
ing use
that we had."

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya said
his office has been wary of alumni pro
grams in the past because "we didn't
want to replicate programs at other
universities that didn't work."
Stanford's program is divided into
three parts. The regional information

meetings for prospective students
allow alumni to meet with high school
seniors and their parents while the ad
missions receptions for admitted stu
dents allows interaction between
alumni and admissions.
The third and newest element of the
involvement program, "The Connec
tion," is designed to involve recent
alumni in the outreach, recruitment
and enrollment phases of the admis
sions process, Knapp explained. After
going through a training session, the
alumni "attend receptions, telephone
certain targeted prospective students
and represent Stanford at college
fairs," she said.
A total of 425 alumni volunteered
for the involvement program this year,

twice as many as signed up for admis
sions training last year, Knapp said.
Montoya lauded the involvement
program's apparent success. "I think
that those who have been involved with
this program have found it's a very
meaningful way to stay involved with
the University," he said.
Montoya stressed the importance of
the new programs to the admissions
process.
"Prospective applicants are going to
listen to recent alumni a lot more than
to those of us whom they perceive as
being older, because students today,
more than ever, need to hear what
Stanford has to offer them directly
from those who are closest to the expe
rience."
