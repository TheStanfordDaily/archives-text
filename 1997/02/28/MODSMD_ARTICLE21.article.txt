# Women's gymnasts host Chili's
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Tonight's tri-meet against No. 12 Ore
gon State and No. 19 Denver will be the
last home game for the Stanford women's
gymnastics team. The meet, set to start at
7:30 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion, is also a
key stepping stone to the NCAA Champi
onships next month and will serve as a
second chance for the Card to bring down
the Beavers.
Earlier in the season, the Stanford
gymnasts experienced a close loss to the
Oregon State team, falling about a point
short. Four weeks of focused training and
three high-scoring meets later, the Cardi

nal squad is ready to rechallenge the
tough competition.
Coach Lisa Izzi said the season is
"starting to come together" as the gym
nasts experience fewer falls, increase
team confidence and elevate to a higher
level of consistency.
"We think we're going to be putting up
a good picture," Izzi said. "It'll be a great
night of competition."
The gymnasts expect a packed house,
including 1996 Olympian Amy Chow, at
Burnham. Chow, who turned pro after
the Games and is scheduled to enroll at
Stanford next year, will be signing auto
graphs and cheering the Stanford squad
tonight.

Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick said the
meet is critical because the results will
most likely affect the event rotation at the
postseason matches.
Izzi said the meet is coming at a point
in the season in which fatigue is catching
up to the team; the squad has competed
against the nation's best on a weekly
basis, and each meet is "getting more and
more mental and the lineup increasingly
competitive."
Fitzpatrick said there are "a lot of
teammates with a lot of pain"; however,
the playing field is set for the Card.
"In a meet, you feel the adrenaline and
not the pain, she said. "We re
ready to hit."
The Stanford team will host five
all-around gymnasts at the meet —
co-captains junior Keri Monahan
and sophomore Amy Murakami,
sophomore Tracey Kohl, Fitz
patrick and freshman Larissa
Fontaine.
Freshman Sarah Harding, who
made her debut last weekend with
a strong performance on the floor,
will continue her new role as the
Card's enertry booster on the event.

Freshman Tara LaMorte and
Annie Thananopavarn will each
compete on three of the four
events.
The Cardinal fans will have a
chance to see freshman Kim Young
perform an exhibition oti the beam
tonight. Young has refrained from
competition due to injuries.
Kohl, who marked her personal
high of 9.9 on the floor at the Chili's
Invitational last year, is another
must-see along with Fitzpatrick on
the bars, Izzi said.
"Oregon [State] is definitely in
our realm; I really think we have a
good chance of taking them," Kohl
said. "We're planning on beating
Denver."
