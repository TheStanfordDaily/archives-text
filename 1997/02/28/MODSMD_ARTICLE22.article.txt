# Spikers to call two venues home

### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Tonight and tomorrow afternoon, the No. 3 Stan
ford men's volleyball team will look to continue its
dominant performance at home in two tough match

es against conference opponents. USC and Long
Beach State, the Cardinal's opponents, should offer
somewhat stiffer competition than that which Stan
ford has faced in its other home matches, against UC-
Santa Barbara and Pacific.
Tonight, the Trojans roll into Maples Pavilion at 7,
bringing with them a very dangerous volleyball team.
Although the Trojans (7-5, 5-3 MPSF) do not sport a
very impressive record or a particularly high ranking
as currently the No. 12 team in the land, they have a
number of impressive wins. USC has knocked off
both Stanford, then ranked first in the nation, and
BYU, the team that is currently on the top of the poll
having defeated Stanford in the past two weeks.
Despite these strong performances, the Trojans
are somewhat of an enigma to the rest of the volley
ball world. Unlike Stanford and the nation's other
top teams, they do not seem to play good volleyball
every time they come out for a match. In the same
week they beat BYU, they lost to UC-San Diego, an
unranked team that has only had two conference
wins in the past two years.
"USC is a really odd case," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "They can come out and play as well as any
team in the country on one night, and the next night
go out and lose to a team like San Diego. They remain
a Jekyll-and-Hyde team."
Although the play of the team has not been terri
bly consistent, senior Eric Seiffert and 6-foot-9 junior
Szilard Kovacs, both middle blockers, have been con
sistently good. Both Seiffert and Kovacs rate among
the top 15 in hitting percentage in the country. In
Stanford's first match, although the Cardinal con
tained Seiffert, Kovacs had a very strong outing.
In order to beat the Trojans, Stanford will have to
improve in three areas: blocking, serving and hitting.
When the Cardinal played USC earlier this month, it
failed to contain both middle blockers, resulting in
Kovacs' big match. Stanford also served poorly, giv
ing the Trojans far too many free sideouts on service
errors. Finally, Stanford needs its three outside hit
ters, seniors Mike Lambert and Matt Fuerbringer
and freshman Andy Witt to play better than they did
in the first match, in which all three of them strug
gled.
"We really have to have our guard up and expect
them to play as well as we know they can," Nieves
said. "We have to get on top of them early and after
that be sure that we can keep on top of them by exe
cuting."
