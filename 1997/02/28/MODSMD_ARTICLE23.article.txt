# Hoops ready for Cal
## Men hope Bears are in for rude awakening 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
If No. 25 Stanford would like any extra
incentive for its annual Maples Pavilion
grudge match against California tomorrow
morning, it need only be reminded that this
game could make or break the Cardinal's
NCAA men's basketball tournament
chances.
A win tomorrow would move fifth-place
Stanford (17-7, 9-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
even with the second-place Golden Bears
(19-7, 10-5) in the conference standings
and boost the Cardinal's tournament
prospects, pending next week's games
against the Arizona schools. With a loss,
Stanford would be left hanging by a very
thin thread.
Throw in the revenge factor — Cal gave
the Cardinal a 70-64 thumping Jan. 29 —
and the Golden Bears' loss of an injured
star, and you've got all the ingredients for
a compelling storyline.
Unfortunately, most sleep-deprived

Stanford students will be in bed when the
drama begins. Thanks to CBS (the game
will be televised regionally on Channel 5),
tipoff has been moved up to 10 a.m.
While the early starting time may not
have much of an impact on the game, the
absence of Cal's Ed Gray will. Gray, a 6-
foot-3 senior guard, led the Pac-10 in scor
ing with 24.8 points per game before break
ing his foot in the Bears' 89-87 loss at
Washington State on Saturday.
Gray underwent surgery Monday and is
out for the season. Cal head coach Ben
Braun will patch up his starting lineup
with junior forward Tony Gonzalez, who
weighs in at 6-foot-6, 250 pounds.
"The matchups really don't change that
much," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Actually, putting Gonzalez in the
starting lineup causes you other problems
than you had, say, trying to defend a Gray.
Now they've become very big and strong."
Montgomery suggested the loss of Gray
might even make the Golden Bears
more solid defensively, while not
necessarily losing a lot of offense.
"When they come down the
floor, instead of passing to Gray
and he puts a dribble down and
goes up and shoots it, it may be
passed two or three or four more
times," Montgomery said, "but
they're still going to get a shot.
It's not like they lose those
points."
But there is no question that

Gray's presence will be missed.
"The athleticism of Gray — just
jumping by and laying it over the
front of the rim — is definitely not
there," Montgomery said.
The switch from a three-guard
lineup to a two-guard look gives
Montgomery good reason to believe
Cal will try to pound it inside on the
Cardinal. The Golden Bears' bruis
ing big-man tag team of Gonzalez,
Alfred Grigsby, Michael Stewart,
Sean Marks and Kenyon Jones
owned the paint against Stanford's
Tim Young and company in the
teams' first meeting.
But the Cardinal has been get
ting much-improved play of late

from reserve big man Mark Mad
sen. In fact, there's been specula
tion the freshman forward could
make his way into the starting line
up tomorrow. Montgomery called
it a possibility but wouldn't say for
certain how the starting five would
shape up.
"I don't know what we will start
with," Montgomery said. "I really
haven't made that decision yet."
Cal won the first game by dou
ble-teaming Knight in the front
court, a gamble that paid off
because the rest of the Cardinal
offense couldn't shoot the ball
through the hole as Stanford shot
just 36 percent from the field. The

Golden Bears also pressured Stan
ford into 19 turnovers, its third
highest total of the year.
If the Cardinal puts up those
same kinds of numbers tomorrow,
it could be a long morning for Stan
ford fans and players alike. But
expect the team to be wide awake
come 10 a.m. The players know as
well as anyone how much this
game means to their season.
"You can tell the kids are ready
to play when you sit there and you
see lots of knees bouncing," Mont
gomery said. "They are responding
to the stimuli, that is, 'We've got a
game, and it's a big game.' There is
that adrenaline and nervousness
