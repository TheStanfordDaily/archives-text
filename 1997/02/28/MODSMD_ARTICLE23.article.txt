# Hoops ready for Cal
## Men hope Bears are in for rude awakening 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
If No. 25 Stanford would like any extra
incentive for its annual Maples Pavilion
grudge match against California tomorrow
morning, it need only be reminded that this
game could make or break the Cardinal's
NCAA men's basketball tournament
chances.
A win tomorrow would move fifth-place
Stanford (17-7, 9-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
even with the second-place Golden Bears
(19-7, 10-5) in the conference standings
and boost the Cardinal's tournament
prospects, pending next week's games
against the Arizona schools. With a loss,
Stanford would be left hanging by a very
thin thread.
Throw in the revenge factor — Cal gave
the Cardinal a 70-64 thumping Jan. 29 —
and the Golden Bears' loss of an injured
star, and you've got all the ingredients for
a compelling storyline.
Unfortunately, most sleep-deprived

Stanford students will be in bed when the
drama begins. Thanks to CBS (the game
will be televised regionally on Channel 5),
tipoff has been moved up to 10 a.m.
While the early starting time may not
have much of an impact on the game, the
absence of Cal's Ed Gray will. Gray, a 6-
foot-3 senior guard, led the Pac-10 in scor
ing with 24.8 points per game before break
ing his foot in the Bears' 89-87 loss at
Washington State on Saturday.
Gray underwent surgery Monday and is
out for the season. Cal head coach Ben
Braun will patch up his starting lineup
with junior forward Tony Gonzalez, who
weighs in at 6-foot-6, 250 pounds.
"The matchups really don't change that
much," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Actually, putting Gonzalez in the
starting lineup causes you other problems
than you had, say, trying to defend a Gray.
Now they've become very big and strong."
