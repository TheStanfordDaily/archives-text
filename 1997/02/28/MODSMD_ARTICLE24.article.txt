# Women to pay final respects to Harmon
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Thank goodness it is the last women's
basketball game at Harmon Gymnasium
because tonight's mismatch between the
third-ranked Cardinal (27-1, 15-0 Pacific
10 Conference) and California Golden
Bears (6-18, 2-13) offers little else.
But there is a record crowd expected to
witness this potentially ugly massacre
that will close down Harmon before its
extensive renovation. Cal will probably
continue to spiral toward its worst skid in
school history while the Cardinal will tin
ker and get healthy as it celebrates a sev
enth outright conference title and looks
toward the NCAA tournament.
"There is a sense of urgency," said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
can't explain it but I feel it. I'm really
focused on this year, and I want to try for
our seniors."
When these two teams met in Maples
Pavilion a month ago, a 95-44 Stanford
romp (and a tie for Cal's worst loss in its
history), the hype was on Golden Bear
head coach Marianne Stanley returning
to the place of her career revival. Her

team was then on a modest two-game los
ing streak, having dropped both games in
Washington the weekend before.
But now, Cal is in total freefall, losing
its 10th game in a row last Saturday to
Washington State, an 83-70 affair in Har
mon. They are two away from the school
record, set last season in Gooch Foster's
final ignominious 7-20 campaign. There
have been near-misses, such as Feb. 8
when USC sweated out a 66-63 contest at
Cal, but even those have been few and far
between.
"I thought we could compete in the
middle of the league," Stanley said. "I've
been real happy with our play, particular
ly against teams in the upper division."
Obviously, the loss of freshman guard
Paige Bowie to a wrist injury prior to the
first Stanford meeting has had an adverse
affect. Not only did Cal lose a decent ball
handler, but her 8.8 points per game cer
tainly helped ease the scoring load off the
likes of senior forward Patrycja Czepiec
and sophomore center Jennie Leander.
The two post players have been the most
consistent performers in a dispiriting sea-
