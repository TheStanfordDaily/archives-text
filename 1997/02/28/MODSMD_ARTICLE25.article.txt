# Baseball hopes to nix Trojan jinx
## Stanford opens Six-Pac tonight against nemesis USC 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
If Stanford's season so far
was a firecracker, this week
end's series against USC would
be World War 111.
When the No. 3 Trojans
arrive at Sunken Diamond today
to take on the Cardinal in the
first of three games at 7 p.m.,
they will represent the most dif
ficult test Stanford has been
handed all season.
"We'd better be ready to play
because this is the biggest series
all season," said junior second
baseman Joe Kilburg.
"This is our biggest series so

far, by far," said freshman right
fielder Edmund Muth. "This
will define where we're going in
league right from the get go."
The first game of league play
is always important. For teams
in the talent-packed Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division,
where four teams are ranked in
the top 25 nationally, league
games become even more impor
tant.
But for No. 9 Stanford U2-6),
the game carries even more
weight. USC has dominated
Stanford during the past two
seasons, winning the last nine
games against the Cardinal. The
Trojans swept Stanford in both

series last season and in one
series the year before. They've
taken eight straight at Sunken
Diamond.
"For the players that remem
ber, that's not intimidating, but
we do care," Kilburg said.
"There's a little bit of a vendetta
there. But we can't get caught
up in that. When it comes down
to it, all we can do is go out there
and play."
Stanford, coming off an 18-4
blowout of Sacramento State on
Tuesday, is riding a considerable
wave of momentum into the
game. But compare that to the

tsunami the Trojans are surfing,
and Stanford's shine starts to
fade.
USC (17-3) has won its last
nine games and risen to No. 3 in
two national collegiate baseball

polls. In last weekend's tourna
ment at Long Beach State, the
Trojans had no trouble sweeping
three teams by a combined score
of 39-7.
The Trojan offense, the biggest
question mark about the team
before the season, has been
sparked by sophomore center
fielder Greg Hanoian, who has a
.508 batting average and an eight

game hitting streak. He will come
into the game tonight smoking,
having hit safely in every one of
his last eight at bats.
Under Hanoian, the offense
has woken up and devoured oppo
nents hit by hit, having logged at
least 10 hits in each of the last six
games.
Pitching has been steady as
well. As their first and second

starters, USC has the last two
Six-Pac pitchers of the year,
senior Randy Flores and junior
Seth Etherton at the helm.
"To beat USC, we need to shut
them down in the early innings
and let our offense take it from
there," said freshman John Gall.
"Hopefully we'll be able to send a
message to the rest of the league."
"We just need to put our game

together," Kilburg said. "Some
times we've got the pitching.
Other times, we've got the hit
ting. We just have to put it togeth
er and work as a unit."
Stanford will send up junior
ace Kyle Peterson to kick off the
series tonight. Sophomores Jeff
Austin and Chad Hutchinson will
pilot the ship tomorrow and Sun
day, respectively, in 1 p.m. starts.
