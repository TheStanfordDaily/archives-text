# Baseball hopes to nix Trojan jinx
## Stanford opens Six-Pac tonight against nemesis USC 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
If Stanford's season so far
was a firecracker, this week
end's series against USC would
be World War 111.
When the No. 3 Trojans
arrive at Sunken Diamond today

first of three games at 7 p.m.,

Conference Southern Division,

games against the Cardinal. The
Trojans swept Stanford in both

series last season and in one

taken eight straight at Sunken
Diamond.

"There's a little bit of a vendetta
there. But we can't get caught
up in that. When it comes down
to it, all we can do is go out there
and play."
Stanford, coming off an 18-4
blowout of Sacramento State on
Tuesday, is riding a considerable
wave of momentum into the
game. But compare that to the
