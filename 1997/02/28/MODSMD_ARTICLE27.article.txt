# Founders' Day celebrated
## 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
What campus event was so impor
tant and so popular that the adminis
tration canceled all classes and closed
all offices for one hour on March 9,
1945?
The answer — Founders' Day —
may surprise students. Although
Founders' Day is quietly commemo
rated annually, a campus-wide cele
bration has not occurred in 20 years.
Most students have never heard of

Founders' Day, which was created by Jane and Leland
Stanford in 1891 to honor the principles on which they
had founded Stanford. Since 1977, however, the cele
bration has consisted of no more than an under-publi
cized procession from the Mausoleum to Memorial
Church.
This year, said Dean of Students Marc Wais, a sub
committee on Founders' Day has planned a day of
events that will be "a landmark event on the Universi
ty calendar."
Wais said this year's committee of students, admin
istrators and community members decided to make
Founders' Day an opportunity for everyone to "really
celebrate being at Stanford."
"This is a chance for the entire Stanford community
to come together and rally around the founders of Stan
ford and the fact that this is a great place, and we're all
part of it," Wais said.
The events planned for Founders' Day, which will
be celebrated on April 13, include the traditional pro
cession from the Mausoleum to Memorial Church. In

addition, this year the day will also include a large com
munity picnic in the Quad following the secular
church ceremony. Wais said the picnic will give stu
dents a chance to "mingle with the President, the
Provost, the Trustees" and other students. Local busi
nesses, including Jamba Juice, will donate food for the
picnic.
The ceremony in Memorial Church will feature
speeches by one undergraduate and one graduate stu
dent. The speakers will be nominated to the subcom
mittee by e-mail. Wais said the idea behind the speech
es is for students to share their visions for higher edu
cation in the 21st century.
According to Mike Martinez, sophomore class presi
dent and subcommittee member, the opportunity for
students to speak will "give them a chance to have a
part in the tradition" of Stanford.
Martinez said he hopes the celebration will remind
students of "what the Stanfords had in mind" back in
1885. "They didn't just build [Stanford] so they could
have their name on a university. They named it in
honor of their son because they wanted to help all of the
children of the world. That may sound cheesy," Mar
tinez said, "but I think it's awesome."
Other subcommittee members agreed that hope this
year's Founders' Day celebration will create a sense of
community.
Marcus Jackson, a law student who also received
his bachelor's degree from the University, said the
day has been designed to be "exciting, attractive, thor
ough and popular." He added that he hopes it gives
students "a sense of enthusiasm for being at Stan
ford."
Nominations for the student speakers can be e
mailed to asulykit@leland or selby_brian@leland.
