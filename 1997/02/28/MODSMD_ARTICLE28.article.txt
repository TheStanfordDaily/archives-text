# Synchro goes north
## Favored Card set for West Regional 
### Scott Judd 
At last, things are starting to
get interesting.
After a stellar undefeated
regular season, the women's
synchronized swimming team
will travel to Seattle to compete
in tomorrow's NCAA West
Regional Championships. The
second-ranked Cardinal, who
have crushed its early season
competitors, are confident that a
strong finish will propel Stan
ford to success in next month's
NCAA Championships.
There is good reason for such
high optimism; Stanford has
taken home the West Regional
crown every year for the past
decade, and this year's squad is
especially talented. The Cardi
nal will face four other schools,
California, St. Mary's, Arizona
and Washington, and has
already trounced the Bears and
the Gaels in earlier meets this
season. Stanford is favored to
dominate tomorrow's competi
tion and hopes to advance all 11
of its swimmers to the NCAA
Championships.
In preparing for regionals,
head coach Vickey Weir stressed
that the team has not let them
selves become overconfident.
"Our practices have been
very intense," Weir said.
"Although the level of competi
tion at regionals will be similar
to what we've seen all year, our
practices have not been lax at all.
"With every practice, we try
to be really focused and make
ourselves a better team.
Throughout the season, we have
continued to concentrate on our
team and moving forward to our
goal of winning a national cham
pionship."
To achieve this aim, the team

has concentrated its efforts on
two main areas: improving the
specific components of each rou
tine and also matching move
ments between swimmers.
Senior co-captain Maia Young, a
four-year veteran of the squad,
said Stanford has greatly
improved since its lopsided vic
tory against Cal two weeks ago.
"We've been able to take a
critical look at all of our routines
and tried to make them cleaner,
more solid," Young said. "Our
practices have really focused on
the synchronization and preci
sion of our routines."
The disciplined Cardinal
hopes that these hard practices
will pay big dividends tomorrow
and anticipates strong contribu
tions from many swimmers.
Junior transfer Heather
Pease, an Olympic gold medal
ist, should display the winning
form that has taken her to the
top of collegiate synchronized
swimming. In meets this year,
Pease has not lost an event and
should make a strong impact for
Stanford at Regionals.
Regardless of any one swim
mer's abilities, the unified Stan
ford squad has kept a strong
team focus throughout the sea
son. Weir emphasized that the
meet will not be won by individ
uals, but rather the entire team.
"To be successful in synchro
nized swimming, you have to
have a team working together so
that they can perform together
and achieve together," Weir
said. "We have a very good team
this year and are very excited
about the national champi
onships. All of our swimmers
are capable of giving really solid
performances and qualifying for
nationals, so regionals should be
a really good meet."
