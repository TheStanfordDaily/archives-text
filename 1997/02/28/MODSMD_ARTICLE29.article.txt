# Smog no problem for men gymnasts
## After big win at UCLA, squad heads to UCSB tomorrow 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
It was an eerie night the for
men's gymnastics squad.
The men traveled to UCLA last
night for a meet against four other
teams and emerged victorious.
Stanford edged out Illinois 22.45-
222.2. Despite this victory, the
night was one of triumph and tur
moil, as senior all-arounder Jamie
Ellis sustained a shoulder injury
while the rest of the team flailed in
its first two events.

The No. 9 Card took on No. 10
Illinois State, No. 24 Arizona State,
No. 22 UC-Santa Barbara and a
club team from UCLA.
The Stanford squad squared off
the night with a horrific perfor
mance on the vault. Almost every
gymnast missed his landing.
The prospects did not look after
the following event either; the Car
dinal headed to the parallel bars for
another disastrous event.
"Everything we tried we
missed," Hamada said.
Staring down the barrel of the

gun, Hamada decided to go with a
more aggressive approach and have
his gymnasts go for new, more dif
ficult tricks.
"Then we went more aggressive.
We had to throw out more stuff (to
build their score), and I figured we
had nothing to lose," he said. "So
the guys went for things that we
usually don't try."
This approach paid off for the
men, who had one more mishap
before the tide began to turn. Ellis
dislocated his shoulder in the third
event of the night — the floor exer

cise. He sustained the injury on a
tumbling pass and suffered in pain
for 10 minutes before Hamada
popped his shoulder back in place.
"I put his shoulder back in and
he is fine," Hamada said. "He will
be OK, but I have to make sure —
his ligament might be a little
stretched out." Ellis will likely not
compete in tomorrow's competition
at Santa Barbara.
The next few events were stellar
for the Cardinal, and the eerieness
of the night seemed to have passed.
Stanford rounded out the night
with season highs on both the high
bar and the still rings.
Sophomore Scott Finklestein hit
his routine with a 9.6, while fresh
man Jason Katsampes scored a 9.7.
Senior Keith Wiley also posted a
strong 9.65 on the event.
"High bar I thought was pretty
good; Scott |Finklestein] nailed a
pretty good routine," Wiley said.
Wiley refrained from perform
ing on the floor exercise due to pain
in his heel, which was aggravated
by his vault; Wiley is ranked fifth
nationally in the all-around.
On the rings, Stanford also per
formed superbly in its traditionally
weak event. Freshman Craig Nes
bitt attempted a new strength
sequence, in line with the daring
attitude change, and landed his
routine with a 9.4. Additionally,
senior lan Bachrach, who had fal
tered at last weekend's home meet,
recovered to rack up a 9.55 on rings
for the Card.
All in all, the competition was
full of highs and lows and at the
very least provided excellent prac
tice for tomorrow's meet against
some of the top schools in the
nation at Santa Barbara.
In addition to last night's com
petitors, No. 6 Oklahoma, No. 27
San Jose State, No. 2 California
and No. 16 Michigan will join the
playing field.
The competition will allow Stan
ford to gauge more of the East
Coast teams and hone its own tal
ents. The Cardinal will look to sur
prise more of its navsayers and
prove that it is trulv a contender.
