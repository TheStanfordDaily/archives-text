# Scientists consider the ethics of cloning
## 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
Announcements earlier in the
week about the successful cloning
of an adult mammal have touched
off a firestorm of debates and
raised a number of ethical and sci
entific issues.
With yesterday's release of the
complete report in the British jour
nal Nature that detailed the
cloning of a female sheep, several
Stanford professors are debating
the advantages and disadvantages
that this new technology offers.
The birth of the cloned sheep,
Dolly, marks the first time when a
mammal with identical genes has
been born through the natural
birthing process and not through
genetic engineering. The scientists
behind the breakthrough were led
by lan Wilmut at the Roslin Insti
tute in Edinburgh, Scotland.
The cloning process began when
Wilmut's team took a mammary
gland cell from an adult sheep and
fused it with an embryo cell which
had been stripped of its nucleus.
The new creation subsequently
grew into a completely new crea
ture that shared identical genes
with the donor sheep.
Wilmut has said the main pur
poses of the cloning techniques are
to serve agricultural and scientific
research rather than aid the cre
ation of human replicas.
Proponents of animal cloning
argue that possible benefits include
simplifying the jobs of breeders,

using cloned animals to help fur
ther scientific research and helping
agriculturists breed superior farm
animals.
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy
suggested that part of the hype
around the new cloning procedure
results from the media's extensive
coverage. "It's not quite as aston
ishing as people are making it out
to be," he said. However, he ac
knowledged, "It does make people
realize that not so far around the
corner are serious ethical issues."
Barbara Koenig, a senior re
search scholar at the Center for
Biomedical Ethics, said a panel at
Stanford will be formed next week
to address some of these thorny is
sues.
Cloning "is problematic, be
cause identity issues have not yet
been discussed," Koenig said. "Nor
have the legal issues. 'Jurassic
Park' is what most people know
about DNA, and there is the issue
of expectation."
Assoc. Microbiology and Im
munology Prof. Robert Siegel said
he feels it is too early to speculate
about all the possibilities of
cloning. Focusing more on prag
matic issues — such as the ways in
which cloning could help advance
knowledge in certain fields — is
more useful, he said.
"Cloning will give us additional
insight into the relationship be
tween environment and genetics,
as well as the notion of regenerat
ing organs for people who need
them," Siegel said.
"The scientific implication of
cloning on the biology of individ

ual cells is more pertinent than
dramatic discussions about more
distant issues on the horizon, es
pecially in light of the fact these re
sults have not yet been duplicat
ed," Siegel added. He pointed out
that until the results are duplicat
ed, they are subject to different in
terpretations.

According to Koenig, "It's ap
parent that the deeply troubling
issue of balancing individuality
versus the guidance is complicated
enough with a child," she said. "It
creates some really, really compli
cated issues about identical geno
types to someone functioning as a
parent."
