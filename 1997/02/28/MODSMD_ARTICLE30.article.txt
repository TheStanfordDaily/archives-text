plays host
Stan
ford is hosting
an ultimate
frisbee tourna-

ment this
weekend â€” the Stanford Invita
tional. The event will consist of 20
teams from nine states and one
from Canada.
Games take place on Saturday
and Sunday at the Roble and IM
fields from 9 a.m. until sunset,
although the main tournament
will be on the IM field.
Second seed Stanford hopes
to overtake top seed UC-Santa
Barbara, both of whom are
undefeated this year. Stanford
will likely take on the Gauchos

at the finals Sunday.
"We're fully expecting to usurp
Santa Barbara's traditional domi
nance of the collegiate circuit," said
senior captain Christian Dodge.
Other strong teams include
Colorado, Rice, the University of
British Columbia and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo. But the field also
includes such schools as UC-San
Diego, lowa, Oregon and Oregon
State.
The winning team will recieve a
trophy and a fee waiver for next
year's competition.
World League takes alumni
Two former Stanford athletes
have recently been invited to
training camps for the World
League of Football. Tackle Seth
Dittman and defensive back Kevin
Scott will made their debut at
camp Monday.
The World League of Football is

a joint venture between the NFL
and Fox. Six international teams
will play ten regular season games.
The club with the best win-loss
record after the first five weeks
will host World Bowl '97 against
the team with the best overall
record afler 10 weeks.
Dittman was allocated for the
league by the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers to the London World League
team, while Scott will go to the
Scottish Claymores.
Former Cal quarterback Dave
Barr was allocated by the 49ers to
the Scotland team as well. The
Pacific 10 Conference yielded the
second-most invites, 34. Only the
Southeastern Conference gar
nered more, 35.
Sailing to race at home
The Stanford Sailing Club will
compete in a rare home meet this
weekend in a two-day event. The

Sailing Team Race Intersectionals
take place in Redwood City at the
harbor.
The regatta begins tomorrow
and continues through Sunday.
Two new club sports
On Feb. 26, the Sport Club
Council officially granted bowling
and table tennis club sports affilia
tion.
When bowling lanes existed in
Tresidder Union, bowling had
active club-sport status. Its revival
late this year resulted in its rein
statement.
In contrast, table tennis has
only been registered at the Office
of Student Activities as a Volun
tary Student Organization since
Spring 1996.
The bowling season recently
ended, while table tennis contin
ues to compete at the intercolle
giate level.
