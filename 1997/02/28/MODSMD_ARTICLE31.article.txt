The Stanford track and field
team opens its outdoor season at
home tomorrow against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, Fresno State
and Sacramento State at the
brand new Cobb and Angell fields.
With the indoor national com
petition beginning March 8, many
athletes that have qualified for
nationals will sit out this week
end's meet. Two qualified ath
letes, however, will still compete
at Saturday's events.
Freshman sensation Toby
Stevenson, who broke the Stan
ford indoor record for pole vault
with 17 feet, 8 1/2 inches last
weekend in Reno, will see action
tomorrow along with star sopho
more Tracye Lawyer. Lawyer
took the high jump title at the
Reno-Nevada Indoors with a
jump of 5-11 1/2. Although
Lawyer is a heptathlete, she will
only compete on the high jump
and hurdles this weekend.
Nonetheless, those athletes
not headed for the indoor nation
als will use the opening meet as a
beginning to a more balanced and
more successful year.
"I think it's going to be a good
opener for our team and serve as
a starting point," said redshirt
junior and long distance runner
J.J White. "It's still early and I
think that people are in shape and
ready to compete." White will not
enter this weekend's events in
preparation for nationals.
Both the men's and women's

team will benefit from an increase
in ability in previously weak
areas.
"Our (women's) track team
used to be known for its long-dis
tance runners — the cross coun
try team — but now we are get
ting different strengths and
throwing and field events are
coming up," said redshirt sopho
more Gina Heads.
"This year our (men's) team
has all of the events covered
unlike in the past; this year we
have a lot stronger sprinters and
the all-around team is a lot
tougher," White said.
In addition to a lineup with a
few holes, the Stanford squad will
also have to overcome some
degree of physical weakness.
"Right now no one is in the
best shape they can be in so peo
ple can't expect to do their best
that they have done, but they can
still compete really well. Other
teams are also just starting their
season, and it's going boil down to
who wants to win more," said
junior Josh Gleason. "Our team is
definitely not going to be at full
strength."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
expects to pull through with a win
this weekend and gain some expe
rience along the way.
"For the throwers, now we get
to add our discus and javelin
throws; the throwers are definite
ly strong, and the distance run
ners are always strong — they are
NCAA champions," Heads said.
"We are looking forward to win
ning. I think in this meet we
should prevail."
