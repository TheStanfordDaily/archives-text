# Cal, Texas pose challenge for tennis
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After four consecutive noncon
ference dual matches last weekend,
the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team plunges headfirst into confer
ence play with a home match
against archrival California today
at 1:30 p.m. Following the confer
ence clash, the Cardinal meets No.
4 Texas at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium on Sunday.
The Cardinal (11-1, 2-0 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division)
will be looking to extend its 26-
game Pac-10 winning streak
against the 18th-ranked Golden
Bears (5-2, 1-1).
Cal, a perennial top-10 squad,
has dropped in the rankings this
season due in large part to a team
that has a combined three years of
experience in collegiate tennis. The
Bears roster has three sophomores
and seven freshmen.
"That makes me feel better,"
said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "We haven't seen too
much of them. They have a lot of
new girls, one from Ireland and
two from Canada." In contrast, the
Cardinal regularly starts three
seniors, two juniors and two fresh
men.
The lack of experience does not
necessarily translate into a lack of
talent, however. The Bears earned
a huge victory three weeks ago by
upsetting then-No. 4 Arizona on
the road in Tucson 6-3. Cal is also
riding a two-match win streak into
Palo Alto, having defeated No. 25
Miami and Florida State last week
end in Florida.
In addition, as Brennan points
out, Cal-Stanford matchups are
close no matter what the records
are.
"On paper, it looks pretty good
for us," Brennan said. "But as I

told the girls, this is Cal and its
always going to be tough. When
they're good and we're lousy, it's 5-
4. When we are good and they are
lousy, it's 5-4. It's just always a
tight one."
Stanford is coming off its first
loss of the season, a 4-3 defeat to
No. 1 Florida in the title match of
the National Team Indoors in
Madison, Wis., last weekend. The
Cardinal reached the finals by
downing No. 3 Duke, No. 8 Pep
perdine and No. 21 Alabama.
The loss on Sunday marked the
third straight to the No. 1 Gators,
and Brennan is looking to rebound
against the Golden Bears.
"I think the loss to Florida got a
little more bitter the second day
than the first day,"he said. "By
Monday, we realized that we
should have beaten them, that we
had them. Now we have to guard
against looking past Cal and past
Texas."
Cal did not attend the National
Team Indoors tournament.
"They probably chose not to go
rather than not being invited,"
Brennan said. "They are definitely
better than some of the teams
there."
Cal is led by sophomore Aman
da Augustus, who has compiled a
2-4 record while playing at the No.
1 singles position. Sophomore
Francesca La'O is 5-1 at the No. 2
spot, and freshman Claire Curran
is 6-1 playing at any of the back
four singles positions.
Augustus and La'O are ranked
No. 12 in the nation in doubles and
are 4-3 in dual-match play in the
No. 1 position.
The Cardinal will welcome back
the services of freshman Lilia
Osterloh from shoulder injury.
Osterloh, who has yet to compete
in a dual match for Stanford, will
probably be in the lineup this

weekend in doubles. In addition,
freshman Anne Kremer, who was
nursing a bad hamstring through
out last weekend's tournament, is
nearly 100 percent.
As for the fourth-ranked
Longhorns (4-1), all four of their
losses this season have come at the
hands of top-10 teams. However,
Texas is experiencing health prob
lems, including an finger injury to
No. 1 singles competitor Farley
Taylor which required surgery.
Taylor did return to action in a win
against Nebraska last weekend in
the doubles lineup.
"They have a lot of good play

ers," Brennan said. "But if they are
injured, it certainly bodes well for
us."
In addition to Taylor, who fin
ished last season ranked No. 15 in
the country, the Longhorns boast
the No. 12 singles player in the
country in Christina Moros and
the No. 27 player in Sandy Sureep
hong.
Texas is the last team to win at
Stanford, two seasons ago when
they won the NCAA Champi
onship. The Longhorns defeated
the Cardinal 5-3 two seasons ago,
and Stanford has not lost at home
since.
