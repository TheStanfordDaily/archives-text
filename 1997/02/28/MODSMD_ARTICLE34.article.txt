It's, like, hard being a Stanford student. And sometimes when
something bad happens to you, it helps to vent a little. Here,
some cool Diversions readers from Wilbur and FloMo send in
their hella-heinous stories of shame and disaster. Just be glad
it wasn't you!!
I was walking by History Corner when I saw the biggest babe
on the water polo team. I've been in a few classes with him, so
I smiled and said hi. He smiled back and greeted me by name.
Just then my maxi pad slipped out of my underwear and hit him
in the face, causing him to have a concussion. I was so embar
rassed I transferred to San Jose State!!!
When the hottest boy in Kimball asked me to the Viennese Ball,
I thought I was dreaming. I had my hair done, got a manicure
and bought a gorgeous dress. On the big night, we were
waltzing in perfect synchrony when I heard a ripping noise.
Before I could do anything, the seams had split, and the whole
dress had fallen off. Worst of all, I wasn't wearing a bra or

from Sports Illustrated:

underwear, so I was standing there totally naked! And all the
Mendicants saw it happen!!!
I was standing in line at the ATM, and the guy I've been
obsessed with for a few months was in front of me. I was just
gathering my courage to talk to him when all of a sudden I fart
ed!!! I was so mortified I leapt over the railing, jumped down to
the first floor of Tresidder and ran into the middle of White
Plaza!
I was sitting in an earth systems lecture. I was really bored, so
I decided to daydream about the boy I've been in love with
since fall quarter. Well, before I realized what was happening,
I'd had an orgasm! I was sitting in the front row, and the pro
fessor looked at me so funny after that. Now I'll never get an
A in that class!!!
Ever had a really mortifying experience at Stanford? If so,
sucks for you! We don't care so why don't you whine to your
roommate, or better yet, call The Bridge, you fucking wuss.
