# FACES IN THE CROWD
## 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch
Stanford, Calif.
Bartsch. 19. set a new world record by eating 21,364 Skittles in one hour. Follow
ing the feat, she apparently went mad and attempted to rob an on-campus conve
nience store, Tresidder Express. At one point, she allegedly threatened a cashier,
saying she would "stick the lemur where the sun don't shine." She is now being
treated in the psychiatric ward of Stanford's Medical Center.
Humphrey Dillbwatt
Kansas City, Mo.
Dillbwatt. 83. took motivation from a Nike "Just Do It" commercial while watch
ing "Gilligan's Island" and "just did it" with his wife Myrtle, 82, for the first time
in 16 years. "I just needed to do it." Mr. Dillbwatt said after the incident. His wife
has since announced plans to sue Nike for suggestive advertising.
Hank Hill
Arlen, Texas
Hill. 42. made Arlen news when he went to the bathroom for the first time in more
than a week due to constipation problems. "Aaah! Dammit, this is a personal mat
ter." said Hill, following the successful dump. "Why in Sam hill does everybody
need to know about this?" His wife, Peggy, had a different opinion. "We're so
proud of him." she said. "This may be Hank's greatest moment."
Frank Cannon
Los Angeles
Cannon, 48. managed to make it through a revolving door without needing any
help. A private investigator with a love of food. Cannon tips the scales at 378
pounds. However, his weight has not affected his karate and fighting skills, his
investigative work or his romantic pursuit of shriveled old women who like to call
him "Slim."
