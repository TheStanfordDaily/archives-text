Conceptions of Peasantry and Gender and Class and
Sexuality and Religion and Society in France,
1624-1685.

The French peasantry was
very important to France.
It has only been in recent
years, however, that its
role in the processes that
turned France from being a nation of
idiotic fatheads to a nation of fat
headed idiots has been duly recog
nized.
The first major modern work to
tackle the subject was Richard Bas
tard's "Peasantry in France." Bas
tard's thesis, which placed consider
able importance on the shifting use of
snot and phlegm in agriculture and

industry, served to undermine much previous scholarship on the topic. It is a
miserable book, which I have always hated. Heading it is about as pleasant as
eating a worm sandwich. The book might conceivably have some use as toilet
paper were it not for the fact that it is already covered with the raw sewage of
Bastard's juvenile prose. Bastard is a small man, wears glasses and quickly
bursts into tears when beaten. Such "men" should be florists, not historians.
Another considerable tome on this subject is the Marxist historian Jean-
Luc-Marc-Luc-Luc Nostrille's "French Peasantry." He shows how the Frondes
were directed specifically against local nobleman, indicating that the rebellions
were a result of class tension. The only reasonable response to a thesis such as
this is: Go back home you pinko commie frog, and take your Marxism with you.
Who won the Cold War? We did. We kicked communism's ass. Idiots such as
Nostrille don't seem to realize this. There is still some ass-kicking to be done as
far as they are concerned.
The most recent revision comes from Henry Crapson, who uses, among oth
ers, Lacan and Freud to dissect attitudes of, and toward, the ancient regime in
his "France and Peasants." A typical instance of his methodology comes in his
discussion of Richelieu's dual role as statesman and phallic symbol. Freudians
are perverse people who presume that everybody is as sordid as they are. Crap
son is a case in point. I hear that by his bed he has both a tub of Vaseline and
a biography of Hitler. If you're reading this Crapson, you pathetic Freudian
idiot, read my lips: I have never wanted to have sex with my mother. Ironical
ly, however, I have had sex with your mother, Crapson. She was abysmal. For
get history and take up something else.
In conclusion it would seem that, on the subject of French peasantry, some
thing tending toward my opinion would be the most reasonable approach. I am
right, everyone else is wrong. I am the island of genius in a sea of morons. One
day my history will be revered and all other historians, who currently have
more "prestige" than I do, will one day be forgotten. That is what history means.
