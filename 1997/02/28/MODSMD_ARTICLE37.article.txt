Do you know what really pisses me off? The fact that people don't stop at stop
signs. Especially in that corner of Mayfield where the Row begins. Sometimes I feel
like throwing a plastic hody over one of those cars that don't stop so they'd think
they'd run someone over. I'll bet they'd get really scared! Do you think that would
teach them a lesson? This time I didn't get to write anything, which makes me feel
left out, so I decided to add this little thingie here. Is that OK? Do you love me?
