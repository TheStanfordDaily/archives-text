# Grad schools rank high in U.S. News
## 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Stanford did exceedingly well in the graduate school
rankings released yesterday by U.S. News & World Re
port, with the Graduate School of Business placing first
and the Law, Engineering, Medical and Education
schools all placing in the top 10 of their respective fields.
The rankings will appear in the March 10 issue of the
magazine and in a guidebook that will be available on
newsstands Monday. This is the eighth year the maga
zine has ranked graduate schools. Undergraduate
rankings will be released later this year, despite the re
cent controversy over the magazine's methodology.

The methodology behind the
rankings differs for each school, but
most are ranked according to,
among other factors, student selec
tivity, job placement success, repu
tation and faculty resources.
"It's always nice to be ranked
No. 1," said Business School Dean
Mike Spence. "We're glad that peo
ple recognize our strength."
This is the second year in a row
that the Business School has placed
first in the ranking. Harvard moved
up three places to a close No. 2. The
University of Pennsylvania, MIT
and the University of Chicago
rounded out the top five.
Spence added that although the
importance of the ranking should

be downplayed, they do help both in
attracting potential applicants and
placing recent graduates in busi
nesses and companies.
In the Law School rankings,
Stanford placed fourth — down
from third place last year. Yale Uni
versity ranked first, followed by
Harvard and the University of
Chicago. Columbia ranked fifth.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
also suggested that the rankings
are not that important. However,
he did point out that the current
head of Chicago's Law School is a
Stanford graduate.
The rankings "are certainly
taken with a grain of salt," Brest
said. "They also certainly help sell
U.S. News & World Report."
In terms of Engineering
Schools, Stanford placed second
again this year to MIT. This is the
eighth year in which MIT has been

ranked number one. Other schools
in the top five were UC-Berkeley
and the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana, which were
tied at third, and The Georgia Insti
tute of Technology, which placed
fifth.
Stanford Medical School was
ranked 10th again this year for re
search-oriented medical schools.
Harvard placed first.
Stanford's School of Education
moved up from third to second
place. Teachers College of Colum
bia University placed first; the
other top five schools included UC-
Berkeley, Harvard and UCLA.
U.S. News & World Report's
ranking methodology, especially
for undergraduate institutions, has
come under close scrutiny by vari
ous students and administrators
throughout the nation, particularly
at Stanford.

University President Gerhard
Casper has written a letter to U.S.
News & World Report condemning
the rankings, and ASSU Vice-Pres
ident Nick Thompson is leading a
nation-wide drive to ask universi
ties and colleges to withhold infor
mation from the magazine.
"We're expecting somewhere be
tween zero and 10 schools to with
hold information," said Thompson.
"We're still in negotiations with a
whole lot of schools."
Stanford, however, is undecided
about what it plans to do.
"We're still consulting," said Di
rector of University Communica
tions Terry Shepard.
U.S. News & World Report had
asked for the rankings by Feb. 19,
but Shepard added that most uni
versities do not have the necessary
information submitted by that
time.
