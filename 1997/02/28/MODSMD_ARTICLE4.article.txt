# Grad schools rank high in U.S. News
## 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Stanford did exceedingly well in the graduate school
rankings released yesterday by U.S. News & World Re
port, with the Graduate School of Business placing first
and the Law, Engineering, Medical and Education
schools all placing in the top 10 of their respective fields.
The rankings will appear in the March 10 issue of the
magazine and in a guidebook that will be available on
newsstands Monday. This is the eighth year the maga
zine has ranked graduate schools. Undergraduate
rankings will be released later this year, despite the re
cent controversy over the magazine's methodology.
