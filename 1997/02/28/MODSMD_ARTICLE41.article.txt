# Engineers elected to National Academy
## 
### Alison MacKinnon 
Although many members of the Stanford
community do not understand the intricacies
of engineering, everyone understands the
honor that comes with national recognition.
Four Stanford professors were among 93 engi
neers elected to the National Academy of Engi
neering earlier this month.
The election of these four brings the total
number of Stanford members in the Academy
to 74.
Those just elected were Parviz Moin, the
Franklin P. and Caroline M. Johnson Profes
sor of Mechanical Engineering, for his re
search on turbulence; Paul Roberts, the C.L.
Peck, Professor of Civil Engineering, for his re
search on water treatment; and Electrical En
gineering Prof. R. Fabian Pease for his re
search on electron beam technology.
Also elected as a foreign associate was
Antony Jameson, who joined the Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department last month as
the Thomas V. Jones Professor of Aerospace
Engineering. He has conducted research on
aerodynamics.
Invitations to join the academy are extend
ed to those who have shown "unusual accom
plishments in the pioneering of new and devel
oping fields of technology."
Moin's current research centers on methods
of controlling turbulence, which could ulti-

mately increase airlines' profit margins.
The award comes as "a pleasant surprise,"
Moin said. He said he is grateful to be honored
"in the company of such distinguished engi
neers and scientists."
Since receiving his master's and doctoral de
grees in mathematics and mechanical engi
neering from Stanford in 1978, Moin has
worked as a National Research Council fellow
and staff scientist at NASA Ames Research
Center. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1986.
Roberts, who received a master's in civil en
gineering from Stanford in 1971, was elected to
the academy for his work in water treatment
and ground water decontamination. He has
used the principles of chemical engineering in
combating environmental problems. A mem
ber of the Stanford faculty since 1981, Roberts
has worked with students on projects includ
ing one that showed how an "air stripping"
process separates organic chemicals from
ground water.
Despite past honors, Roberts was unpre
pared for the award. When he received the
package notifying him of his latest distinction,
"I thought it was a pile of reports that I had to
review," he said. His confusion turned to
amazement as Roberts realized the truth."I
was delighted, and my next reaction was 'How
did I deserve this?' " Roberts said.
Pease has worked on showing that electron
beam technology could be used to heal silicon

wafers after sustaining damage from ions.
Currently on a two-year leave in Washington,
D.C., with the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, Pease was a pioneer even as a
graduate student at Cambridge University. At
Cambridge, Pease designed and built the first
scanning electron microscope with the ability
to image details as small as 100 angstroms â€”
about one millionth of a millimeter.
Pease served as a faculty member at UC-
Berkeley before coming to Stanford in 1978.
Electrical Engineering Department Chair
Bruce Wooley, who has known Pease since he
was a student of Pease's at Berkeley, called
him "an extraordinary contributor to Stanford
and a pioneer in his field."
Jameson, elected to the academy as foreign
associate, has focused on the problem of air
flow prediction around the wings of an aircraft
as it moves from subsonic to supersonic flight.
At Princeton University, where he taught be
fore coming to Stanford in January, he and his
colleagues created the first computer code that
models such airflow. This code has been used
by NASA in their work to develop a supersonic
transport.
Although he is an British citizen, Jameson
said he has conducted most of his research in
the United States. Like the other professors at
Stanford, he said he is flattered by his election
to the Academy. "It is nice when somebody
takes note of your work," he said.
