Deformed humans and farm
animals bellow with pain in a
reprint of Pablo Picasso's tor
tured and harrowing "Guerni
ca." A Hewlett-Packard 755 CM
plotter printer rests just below
the mural painting of a fascist
bombing in Spain.
This famous cubist image
strangely juxtaposed against
the modern computer equip
ment can be found in the newly
unveiled Stanford University
Digital Art Center.
The center, developed by
Greg Lam Niemeyer, a second
year graduate student in the
fine arts program, is located
above Annenberg Auditorium
in the Cummings Art Building.
Digital art is a new medium
that involves the creation of art
work using computers and
imaging software. According to
Lam Niemeyer, "The digital art
center is going to be something
that brings the art community
together."
"One of the new tools avail
able to the artist is the comput
er, but it still needs a lot of de
velopment before it becomes ac
cepted by the general art audi
ence. Hopefully, this will hasten
the development," Lam
Niemeyer added.
The art center formally
opened last night with a speech
by digital art pioneer Pedro
Meyer. His humorous hour
long presentation highlighted
art and photography.
Meyer made use of Annen
berg's Powerpoint presentation
capabilities by displaying many
works ranging from Dali's sur
realist watches to Renaissance
style portraits.
A pioneer in the digital art
field, Meyer created the first in
teractive art CD-ROM 10 years
ago. "It was the first time that a
CD-ROM was made with con
tinuous images and sound," he
said.

Meyer commented that the
most important part of the cen
ter's project is that it allows dig
ital technologies to be made
available to more artists. He
also said that as "technologies
become part of the education of
young people, things in art will
change."
Many may worry that this
new medium of digital art could
somehow replace the traditional
art forms. However, Photogra
phy Lecturer Joel Leivick noted
that just as "color photography
wasn't the end of black and
white photos," digital art will
not replace traditional art. He
added that the many different
types of art can actually peace
fully coexist.
The 29 year-old Lam-
Niemeyer initiated a $25,000
grant proposal for the center at
the urging of Leivick.
Leivick, who has 15 years of
experience at Stanford, said, "A
new frontier is opening up in
photography. There are so
many photographic applications
that revolve around the comput
er manipulation of images, and
we are hoping to create a place
where people can learn about
these technologies."
The new lab is sparsely fur
nished with a few tables, two
Power Macintoshes and a print
er which has the unique capabil
ity of printing up to 10-foot long
banners.
Lam-Niemeyer is capitaliz
ing on these special printing op
tions in an undergraduate
course he teaches titled, "Digital
Art in Public Spaces." The class
is currently working to decorate
the Fourth and Townsend Cal-
Train station in San Francisco
with its artwork.
The CalTrain campaign will
place banners in the station that
show friendly conductors and
behind-the-scenes construction
work. According to Lam-
Niemeyer, the art should add
"narrative to the daily experi
ence of using the train."
