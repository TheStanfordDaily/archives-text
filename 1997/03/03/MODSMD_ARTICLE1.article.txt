# Afro-American studies to join with CSRE program
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Despite some initial reservations, the Under
graduate Program in African and Afro-American
Studies has decided to become a full member of the
new Program in Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford, the steering
committee chair of Afro-American Studies, sent an
e-mail message on Thursday to Dean of the School

of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven confirming that the com
mittee had voted in favor of fully
joining CSRE. Until that point,
Afro-American Studies was an af
filiate member.
The letter said, however, that
the decision "was not reached easi
ly." It listed a set of concerns about

possible consequences of full mem
bership, as well as a set of assur
ances from Shoven that have "suf
ficiently put to rest" the commit
tee's concerns.
In practical terms, the principal
effect students will feel from the
change will be in the requirements
for the Afro-American Studies
major. Of the six majors that will
eventually make up CSRE, Afro-
American Studies is the only one
that now exists as a degree-granti
ng program.
Morris Graves, the program's
acting director, said the change
means Afro-American Studies ma
jors declaring after this year will
have to complete the 15 units of re
quired courses for CSRE majors,
including two CSRE "gateway
courses" and a senior writing semi
nar.
They will still have to complete

Afro-American Studies 105, the re
quired entry-level course. They will
also need 20 units of core courses
within the department instead of
the currently required 25 to 30. The
minimum for completing the
will be 60 units instead of 55.
In addition, Graves said, jiajor
curriculum changes in Afro-Ameri
can studies will have to be made in
consultation with the CSRE pro
gram.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, di
rector of the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
said he is "very enthusiastic" about
Afro-American Studies joining his
program.
He stressed that the decision to
join was made entirely by faculty in
Afro-American Studies. He added
he had always considered it possible
for the affiliate relationship to con
tinue indefinitely without leading
to full membership.
He was "delighted," however,
that it had not continued in that
fashion.
"I think there's much to be

gained from a common intellectual
background of core courses and the
senior seminar," Camarillo added.
One of the major problems Afro-
American Studies faculty had
about joining CSRE was the possi
ble difficulty of combining the cur
rent content of Afro-American
Studies with the CSRE curriculum.
Rickford's letter cited a concern
that "the focus of [Afro-American
Studies] on African and African-
American people ... might be dis
placed by the focus of CSRE on race
and race relations, which consti
tute only a part of our intellectual
interest."
"We don't want CSRE classes to
get to the point where students are
arguing over who's been victimized
the most," Graves said.
According to Rickford's letter,
Shoven had reassured the faculty
that "the focus of [Afro-American
Studies] on the study of Africans
and African-Americans will not be
downplayed" and that students will
receive degrees in Afro-American
Studies rather than CSRE.

Shoven has also assured the fac
ulty that the Martin Luther King,
Jr. professorship, which was re
cently vacated by Anthropology
Prof. James L. Gibbs, will become
permanently associated with the
director of Afro-American Studies.
At the moment, Graves ex
plained, Afro-American Studies is
not able to hire its own faculty but
is staffed by faculty with billets in
other departments.
Therefore, he said, faculty had
been concerned that giving the di
rector the endowed chair might
mean it would revert to whatever
department held the chair's billet.
Afro-American Studies will be
one of six majors offered within
CSRE, along with Chicano Studies,
Native American Studies, Asian
American Studies, Jewish Studies
and Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity.
For students interested in any of
these options, an information
meeting will be held this afternoon
from 4:30 to 5:30 in Building 200,
Room 305.
