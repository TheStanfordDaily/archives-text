## Editorial True representation? 
### 
The ASSU must turn to
its constituents to be an
effective government

The president, vice
president and 30 senators
who get elected as Stanford's
new student government in April
face a challenge — not to live up to
the greatness of their predecessors
but rather to define their roles and
ensure the ASSU truly is a repre
sentative government.
The switch last year from a
Council of Presidents to a presi
dent-and-vice-president pair made
many hopeful that what was an
ineffective leadership would turn
into an organ for change on behalf
of the students. This year's leader
ship has produced a remarkable list
of issues to tackle and, in some
cases, has made progress on these
issues. But the question remains:
Are they representing the stu
dents?
How many students care
whether the University maintains a
separate "socially responsible"
endowment fund? Indeed, how
many students knew their elected
representatives were campaigning
for this in the first place? Certainly
the answer cannot be based on how
many signatures were collected on
petitions in favor of this or any
other initiative. Everyone with a
petition knows that people passing
through White Plaza at lunch will
sign anything.
This is evidence of the disturbing
lack of communication between
Stanford students and their repre
sentatives. One would hope that Bill
Shen is our president because of
more than name recognition and
political maneuverings. And one
would hope that the issues he is
pursuing have to do with more than
his and ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson's personal interests.
But neither Shen, Thompson nor
any senator has made a concerted

effort this year to find out what stu
dents really care about. They criti
cize University President Gerhard
Casper for failing to learn about the
"real" student issues, but the execu
tive and legislative branches of the
student government fail to actively
seek that information.
With this election, there is a
chance for change. The field of can
didates is broader and more com
petitive, and students must demand
that candidates prove their worth
by offering specific plans for how
they'll represent students' views.
Both as candidates and as elected
officials, they may be able to accom
plish this by holding town hall
meetings, talking to students at din
ing halls or scheduling regular
office hours. They need to do more
than simply give the impression of
listening — which is exactly what
the ASSU's current leadership is
doing with today's "Cookies and
Tea" session, a meeting open to all
University administrators that is a
take-off of Casper's "Tea and Cook
ies" gatherings designed to allow
students to bring up any issue they
see fit.
How the ASSU's version is dif
ferent from Casper's is not clear,
but it's obvious that it will be just
another opportunity for ASSU lead
ers to lodge their complaints.
The fliers for the event certainly
don't give much hope that today
will be different from any other day.
To draw students, they suggest
some topics that might come up —
the socially responsible endowment
fund, the potential relocation of the
Toyon Eating Clubs, a public ser
vice minor.
It may be that students, or at
least a subset of students outside
the ASSU President's Office, care
about these issues. The problem is
that no elected official is making
any effort to determine whether
that's true.
Representative government is
central to the meaning of democra
cy. And there's no reason Stanford
students should have anything less
than true representation.
