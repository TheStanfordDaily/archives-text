Graduate and undergraduate mix essential to co-ops

WIE ARE A GROUP of neighbors,
friends and alumni who feel
that The Stanford Daily has
made a false distinction between the
"right" of undergraduates to have on
campus housing and the "luxury" of
choosing integrated graduate-under
graduate housing as an option.
In our cooperative, Hammarskjold
House, graduate students constitute
about 25 percent of the population, and
we all feel that they provide an integral
part of the cooperative lifestyle and
enrich the co-op community with their
additional diversity and experience. For
those of us who value this sort of diver
sity within our living group, it is sad
dening to see the ideal that we have
achieved belittled by both the adminis
tration and The Daily. There has got to

be a better way to work around chang
ing housing needs without unnecessari
ly deepening the divide that exists
between Stanford's graduate and under
graduate populations.
Graduate students and undergradu
ates do have different needs. The under
graduate experience is based on diversity
of choices and interactions, whereas
post-bachelor education tends to require
specialization and focus. However, the
mixture of graduate students and under
graduates can be extremely enriching.
Through this interaction graduate stu
dents can become immersed in Stanford
culture, community and traditions while
undergraduates can obtain educational,
personal and entertainment benefits
from the broader experiences of gradu
ate students.

At Hammarskjold, graduate stu
dents and undergraduates mix in liv
ing spaces, cook crews and social activ
ities. Residents give each other job
advice, teach candle-making, learn
about the different countries they
come from, take hiking trips together,
even build houses together. But what
is amazing is that we all live, eat and
work together while months go by
without ever bringing up the issue of
who among our neighbors is a gradu
ate student and who is an undergradu
ate. We take it for granted that it does
not matter.
Meanwhile, in the rest of Stanford,
especially following the exclusion of
undergraduates from Crothers Memori
al in 1993 and the dismantling of the
Manzanita trailer park in 1995, there is

nowhere else where this sort of harmo
ny and mutual respect is even capable
of developing. There really is no place
other than the co-ops where graduate
students and undergraduates can regu
larly just hang out.
We need more, not less, community
between graduate and undergraduate
students at Stanford. We urge the Stan
ford Housing office to think outside the
box when responding to temporary,
predictable fluctuations in housing
needs. The answer is not to create two
"separate but equal" Stanfords.
