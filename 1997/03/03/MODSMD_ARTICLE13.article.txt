# Stanford ROTC policy was not changed by recent agreement
## 
### 
There have been numerous articles
and editorials over the past few weeks
in The Stanford Daily that may have
misled your readers into believing that
a fundamental change of policy has
taken place and the return of the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps to
Stanford is imminent. Nothing could be
further from the truth, and I would like
to set the record straight.
Although Stanford recently renewed
an agreement with the Army ROTC, that
agreement is a continuation of practices

that have been in place for almost twenty
years. It is not the dramatic change that
has been portrayed in some articles in
The Daily, and it certainly does not
include a provision that an ROTC
detachment will be located at Stanford.
Stanford has had cross-enrollment
agreements between the Naval ROTC
program at UC-Berkeley, the Army
ROTC program at Santa Clara Univer
sity and the Air Force ROTC program
at San Jose State since the late 1970s
and early 1980s. Under those agree
ments, Stanford students take courses
at those universities and, upon comple
tion of the ROTC program and upon
graduation from Stanford, are commis
sioned into the armed forces.
The agreement that Stanford has had
with the Army ROTC program had
expired and needed to be renewed in

order for Stanford students to continue
to participate. This has been portrayed
in some news articles as "ROTC is
returning to Stanford." It needs to be
made clear that the ROTC detachments
that operate at UC-Berkeley, Santa
Clara University and San Jose State will
continue to operate at those institu
tions. At no point has any ROTC unit
requested that it be allowed to move its
operations to Stanford.
For some time we have permitted
ROTC courses from these three universi
ties to take place at Stanford when
requested to do so and when space has
been available. We have done this primari
ly as a convenience to Stanford students.
Because credit is earned at the other three
universities for participation in ROTC, we
evaluate the transferability of credit
according to Stanford's normal practices

of accepting credit from other universi
ties. These practices include a review of
the courses by Stanford faculty members.
To date, only one course from UC-Berke
ley has been accepted in transfer.
Students who enroll in ROTC are eli
gible for substantial scholarship support
Without this support, many of our stu
dents simply would not be able to attend
Stanford. Stanford has sought to deal
with the issue of ROTC in a manner
that does not penalize those who can
least afford it.
The Daily, in its inaccurate portrayal
of the nature of the relationship
between Stanford and ROTC, has only
complicated an issue that should have
the thoughtful consideration of the
Stanford community.
