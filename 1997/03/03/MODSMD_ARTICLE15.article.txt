Dear dean shoven,
I am writing to urge you to con
sider Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta's appeal for tenure. I am nei
ther Prof. Gupta's colleague nor his stu
dent, but I am a participant in the field of
cultural studies. Engaging in a discipline
with some of the most daring and bril
liant scholars in the world is dizzying and
terrifying and exalting. It is exactly what
you advertised in the brochure that came
to my mailbox four years ago.
I came here because of "Courses and
Degrees," because of the infinite promise
contained in its pages. A lot of people I
know came for the same reason; we liked
the excellent sports teams, the light on
Memorial Church at sunset, the idea of
bare legs in February, but we were sold
on the promise of developing our minds
to extents previously unrealized.
And what should we say to the incom
ing class? Jim Montoya, the dean of
undergraduate admissions, sent an e-mail
message to all members of the senior class
asking us if we wanted to share our Stan
ford experiences with prospective stu
dents. Should I tell them that I was good
enough to get in as a student but that
with the education I received, I will never
be good enough to get in as a professor?
Should I tell them that serious scholar
ship does not include gender, race, ethnic
ity, sexuality, class or culture?
I don't need to tell them. You are telling
all of us that. You are telling those of us

who study or belong to groups traditional
ly excluded from academia that we are not
good enough, that we will never be good
enough. Last year, five women went up for
tenure. Five women went away empty
handed. Stanford has one of the worst
rates of retention of faculty of color and
female faculty. I know each case is individ
ual. But these cases give us insight into
what kind of individual you are looking for.
Given the passage of California's Propo
sition 209 and a time when education
threatens to become more exclusive than
ever, this tenure business sends a danger
ous message of complicity. For you are lim
iting the kind of people who will come here
as surely as ending outreach and equal
opportunity would. By dismissing those
who dare to question and those who take
risks, you are developing a very narrow
profile of what it means to be a member of
the Stanford community. And this kind of
narrowness and pedagogical inflexibility is
not the kind of profile that you can adver
tise in an admissions booklet, simply
because it's nothing to be proud of.
What power you have, Dean Shoven.
What possibilities. Scholarship has
always been about cultural studies, but
the culture has always been monolithic.
In the breakdown and rebuilding of our
understanding of culture and how it
operates is the possibility of coalition
building, consensus and recognition of
difference. We are learning a language
with which to speak to and about each

other. It comes haltingly, painfully, like
any newly acquired tongue. As an educa
tor, you have the chance to help the dis
cussion flourish and expand.
There is much talk that Prof. Gupta's
appeal will be delayed until summer, when
his students and his colleagues are not
here to protest. I am asking you to be
courageous enough to talk to us now. Prof.
Gupta deserves that much respect. Every
one on campus deserves an honest look at
Stanford's pedagogical goals to see if they
are worthy or if they need to be fought in
order to preserve the kind of exemplary
scholarship and research opportunities
that should exist at this university.
I want to know why people like Akhil
Gupta do not have a place here. His col
leagues deem him an international
expert. His students say he is a generous,
gifted instructor and human being. His
department recommended unanimously
that he receive tenure. As someone who
came here for the quality of the profes
sors, that's enough for me. What exactly
would be good enough for you?
Very truly yours,
Teri M. Stein
Senior, modern thought and literature

Teri Stein will be ready for tenure in 15
years â€” assuming she finishes her
senior thesis.
