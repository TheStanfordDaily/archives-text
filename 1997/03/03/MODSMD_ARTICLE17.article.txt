# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Keeping track of yourself: A warning to potential clonees 
### 
SEND IN THE clones! First some
scientists in Scotland cloned a
sheep. Now some experts in Ore
gon are cloning monkeys. Obviously,
there's a trend here.
It's only a matter of time until these
same scientists clone their way up the last
few rungs of the evolutionary ladder and
start cloning you and me. And you and
me. And you and me. And you and me.
And you and me. And you get the point.
Well, I for one (and only one) am none
too anxious to see this whole cloning con
cept invade my life just yet. After all, I have
too many inner conflicts and insecurities
as it is; the last thing I need is to start giv
ing them all human form. Something as
simple as getting dressed to go out would
become an early evening nightmare:
Me: I just got this new shirt. I think
I'll wear it tonight.
Myself: Well, if I were you — and I am
— I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing!
I: Please! Would you kiss our mother
with that mouth?
And so on and so on, so that eventual-

ly I — I mean, we — would never get any
thing done. So much for the convenience
of modern technology.
Of course, if all these scientific break
throughs keep breaking through, I won
der if there's any way to stop the
inevitable. As has always been the case
throughout history, people are generally
too busy paving the road with their good
intentions to stop and notice where it's
leading. So we might as well get ready for
the day when that first home-cloning
infomercial hits the airwaves.
If that day comes, I especially worry
about the effect widely available cloning
technology could have here at Stanford.
At a place where everybody wants to
make something of themselves, the
chance to do so quickly and easily could
get real trendy, real fast.
Just think about it. There you are:
You've just pulled another all-nighter,
and now you've got so many classes,
meetings and rehearsals that it'll be
Thursday before you can take home the
take-home that you picked up before you

left for your tournament last weekend.
You resolve that your life is just too hec
tic for one person to handle.
So you jaunt over to the Bookstore and
right up the stairs to the new "Clonique"
counter. A helpful salesperson directs
you to the make-up section, where anoth
er (identical) salesperson analyzes your
genetic make-up. At this point, some
thing you don't understand happens and
moments later the friendly salespeople
present you with a free gift, as well as up
to eight carbon-copies of yourself. You
(plural) walk away feeling more relaxed
and more numerous than you did only
moments before. You remark that the
procedure itself was rather cheap, but
the $400 you find yourself shelling out
for eight identical Stanford sweatshirts
foretells the problems to come.
At first, everything seems great. You
can skip class and have yourself take
notes for you. People start noticing you're
the life of the party — every party. Need
to be two places, three places at once? Not
a problem. Friends realize that they can

always call on you. Professors realize that
there's always one of you to call on. Final
ly, you win the heart of the girl of your
dreams ("Oh, Stanley! One of you is
always there for me, and I love you for
it!"). Yep, you've got it made. All of you.
But then, the fragile fabric of your
world begins to fray. It starts with ten
sions, short tempers, the little arguments
over who gets shotgun. Next, you get a
phone bill for calls you don't remember
making. You're doing your laundry every
other day, but you still never have clean
clothes. All your new friends lose faith in
you after you make plans with them and
don't show up because you forgot to tell
yourself. Finally, your girlfriend dumps
you ("Dammit, Stanley! You only care
about yourselves! You're not the only
people with problems, you know!").
You're left standing there, helpless, ask
ing yourselves, "What went wrong?"
Each of you has a different excuse.
Frantic, you yearn to get away from it
all, to escape your troubles for awhile —
but you can't because you lent yourself

the car. So you slump down, defeated,
beside yourself, hating yourself for what
you've become.
Don't let this happen to you! Is this
really what we want? I don't think so. In
my future dreams, I see a life where
being is for humans and copies are for
Kinko's! I look forward to a world where
people are content to just be themselves.
But maybe that's just me. This
cloning issue has a lot of medical and
moral controversy flying around it and
despite my strong feelings, I have no
desire to bog myself down in a big bio
ethical boondoggle. So for now and in the
future, I will continue to speak for myself
and only for myself.
And that could be a lot of people.

Victor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, might consider taking on a clone
if that clone promised to clean up the
room every once in a while.
