## Men's and women's hoops squash hapless Weenies Women appear sluggish, but it doesn't matter

BERKELEY — If there were
any tears shed in Harmon Gym
nasium Friday night, it probably
had more to do with the quality
of the contest than the fact that
it was the last women's game in
California's revered run-down
arena.
A total of 4,908 fans, many of
whom were from Stanford, wit
nessed the Pacific 10 Conference
champion Cardinal's 19th con
secutive victory, an 82-50 wire
to-wire win over the Cal Bears
(6-19, 2-14 Pac-10). While the
margin of victory was convinc
ing, the way the game was
played left little to be desired.
"It just felt like our team was

going through the motions," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "I know that this was
an important game for Cal, but
we just need some different peo
ple to step up. We got that from
the perimeter people, but I
thought we needed a little bit
more inside."
Before the game was 10 min
utes old, Stanford (28-1, 16-0)
found itself ahead 16-2. Califor
nia could not get started offen
sively, missing 11 of its first 12
shots. Meanwhile, the Cardinal
was spurred on by its 6-of-ll
first-half shooting from three
point range. It was a good thing
too because without it, Stanford
shot 8-of-27 (29.6 percent), with
many of those coming on missed
layups down low. The Bears did
not add anything to the game
either, turning the ball over 18
times in the opening 20 minutes
of play while shooting 28 percent
from the floor.
"Part of it was us not execut
ing, and we talked about that at
halftime," said Cal head coach
Marianne Stanley. "Against a
team that is very sound defen
sively you must execute. It
seemed like no one wanted to
shoot the first eight minutes of
the game."
Starbird provided the high
light of the half (or the evening,
for that matter) on a breakaway
when the Ail-American went up,
twisted in the air and softly made

a two-handed reverse layup to go
along with a foul. The three
point play made it 32-9 with 4:38
to go, a lead that eventually
became a 39-17 halftime advan
tage.
The second half was a con
stant shuffling of players and
missed shots as Cal relaxed and
proceeded to shoot 40 percent
from the floor. Starbird (18
points) sat down for the night
with 15 minutes to go and the
Cardinal up 50-22.
Four more Stanford players
joined her in double figures as
Wideman chipped in with 13
before joining Starbird on the
bench with 12:31 left. Junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard poured in
17, and junior center Olympia
Scott scored 10. After taking over
for Starbird, freshman guard
Christina Batastini once again
took full advantage, scoring 10
points, grabbing four rebounds
and dishing out three assists.
The overall team numbers
were not as positive. Stanford
was out-rebounded 49-45 (Cal's
season high) by a team that is
last in the Pac-10 in rebounding
margin. The post players man
aged to shoot 6-for-20 while the
team shot a below-average 61
percent from the line.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to
come out with a better effort
than we did tonight," Wideman
said. "I look at it as preparation
for the tournament. I think we
need to be able to play with 40
minutes of intensity as opposed
to tonight where we were in and
out of the level of play that we
need to be successful."
