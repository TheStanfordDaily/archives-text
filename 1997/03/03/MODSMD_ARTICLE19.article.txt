# Bears now call Oakland home
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY-It's called a
home-court advantage, and
California doesn't have one.
Fortunately for the Bears
(6-19, 2-14 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), Friday's game against
the third-ranked Cardinal
(28-1, 16-0) was their last in
Harmon Gym. Now Cal can
look forward to playing in
Oakland's Kaiser Auditorium
while Harmon is transformed into
the Haas Pavilion and hopefully
building a more successful tradi
tion under the tutelage of head
coach Marianne Stanley. Stanley's
first season has been anything but
a success, and with just a road trip
to Arizona left, Cal is in danger of
becoming one of the few Division I
schools to complete the season
without a win away from home.
Friday was Cal's last home
game, but it was not any more
pleasant than anything that the
Bears have faced on the road this
season, with the possible exception
of the 51-point beating Cal took at
Maples Pavilion on Jan. 31.
This time around Cal kept it
close, or at least closer. A sloppy
first half and destitute shooting
from the Bears, combined with
more than 50 percent three-point
shooting from Stanford was the
difference at the break as the Card
led 39-17.

The half was almost painful to
watch. Cal couldn't stop turning
the ball over and shot atrociously
but managed to be just 22 points
down at the break. The reason, at
least partly, was Cal's ability to
stop the transition and pack thing√ü
into the lane to stop Stanford's
inside game. Unfortunately for the
Bears, the Card settled for a half
court game that produced 6-of-ll
shooting from three-point land
and gave Stanford the lead.
"We've had trouble offensively
all year," Stanley said. "It took us
a while to settle down and execute,
and part of the credit is Stanford's
defense. But if your execution is
off, you're going to make their
defense just look better."
The turnovers did not provide
Cal with many scoring opportuni
ties in that half, but the Bears also
didn't capitalize on the few oppor
tunities they got, only making
seven of their 25 attempts. With
10 minutes, 42 seconds left in the
first half, Cal had totaled just two
points to its nine turnovers. But
the Bears settled down and put 15
more points on the board before
the half s close, falling just one

short of their turnover mark of 18.
The game can probably be
described as Stanford's ugliest win
of the season. The Card did not
shoot well from the inside and was
out-rebounded by Cal 49-45. The
first half was almost torture to
watch, and the only play that real
ly sparked the crowd, most of
whom were Stanford fans, was an
incredible double-pump, two
handed, basket-and-the-foul,
reverse layup off the glass from
senior guard Kate Starbird.
Cal managed to tidy up its game
in the second half and was only
outscored by 10. The Bears com
mitted just eight turnovers while
shooting 40.6 percent from the
field and 33.3 from three-point
range and even looked relaxed on
the court against the Pac-10 cham
pion despite finishing 6-of-21 (28.6
percent) from the foul line. Stan
ford, meanwhile, continued to play
as if it were going through the
motions. The Card scored 43
points in the second period on sim
ilar shooting numbers to the first
half and didn't appear excited to be
on the court.
"We were missing (junior for

wards) Heather (Owen) and
(Naomi Mulitauaopele) a lot,"
VanDerveer said. "We got out
rebounded; Olympia was really
struggling inside. We had excel
lent perimeter scoring but besides
our transition and perimeter
[game], our inside game was real
ly lacking. The sooner they come
back, the better, as far as I'm con
cerned."
Coming off an emotional game
like last weekend's Senior Night,
one can imagine the difficulty to
get up for a game against the last
place team in the conference, a
team that Stanford has already
beaten by 51 points. But the Car
dinal wasn't pleased with its per
formance and noted the impor
tance of using its next two games
to better gear up for the NCAA
tournament.
"I think it would be a mistake
for our team to look at just the
win-loss record in terms of our
readiness for tournament play,"
Wideman said. "We won the game
tonight, but I don't think we nec
essarily used the opportunity to
improve ourselves and our level of
play."
