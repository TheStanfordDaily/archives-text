O J
anxious and weary? Do you want
someone else to just take care of
you?
If you answered yes to any of
the preceding questions, look no
further. The newly created Dad
Service is going to solve all your
problems, and it's going to do it
for free.
Established this quarter, the
service dispatches kindly surro
gate fathers to students' dorms at
night. According to fliers adver
tising the service, dads are able
and willing "to read you a bed
time 3tory, get your last glass of
water for the evening and answer
questions about why the sky is
blue."
The brainchild of seniors
Hayes Morehouse and Nathan
Jones, the Dad Service has two
main goals. "The first is to be
nice, to take care of people. Peo
ple at Stanford are real stressed
out," said Morehouse, a psycholo
gy "The second (goal) is to
question gender roles, whaO it
means to be gendered. We actual
ly have one female dad."
Morehouse said the inspira
tion for the service was an experi
ence he had last Thanksgiving at
a friend's house in Arizona. "I

read abedtime story to a group of
my friends. They loved it. They
were asleep by the time I finished
the story. It was so cute."
Since the official formation of
the service, however, few stu
dents have taken advantage of

the dads. Morehouse, who is one
of the four dads, said calls have
come from his friends, who have
ordered dads for their friends
rather than for themselves.



Justin Mills — Daily
Seniors Hayes Morehouse (left) and Nathan Jones, the founders of
Stanford's new Dad Service, take turns reading bedtime stories to
each other.
"Once I didn't know the peo
ple, and they weren't expecting
it," Morehouse said. Because of
the combination of these factors,
he decided not to go. "It's too far
out of people's normal frame of
reference. It wouldn't [have
been] a good interaction."
Morehouse and Jones both
said they have encountered stu
dents who assume the service is
somehow lecherous. "A lot of peo
ple are suspicious of our mo
tives," Morehouse admitted.
Because of this suspicion, the
dads have tried to use nonthreat
ening language in their advertise
ments. When making the fliers,
"we were very careful sexually,"
Morehouse said. He added that
they considered offering to "tuck
you in, turn out the light" but
thought, "No, that sounds
sketchy."

The dads' uniforms are intend
ed to further quell skepticism:
They include slippers and
bathrobes. Morehouse said he
made his robe on a sewing ma
chine.
Wardrobe aside, Morehouse
and Jones said they are not sim
ply mimicking the paternal role
— they are challenging it.
"I'm in this space where I'm
believing that gender is complete
ly learned," Morehouse said.
Jones, a feminist studies
major, said he hopes "to change
general conceptions of masculini
ty or femininity by mismatching
them or change them by the
things we emphasize."
For example, Jones said, the
service would not reinforce "abu
sive" stereotypes sometimes as
sociated with fathers.
Jones said he sees humor as a
useful tool in raising awareness
about the limitations of gender.
"If you're going out and telling
people they could be bad people or
their friends could be bad people,

you're coming from a negative di
rection. We thought, 'What can
we offer that's kind of cool or kind
of fun?"'
At the same time, Jones em
phasized that the Dad Service is
not intended to be entirely amus
ing, which is a misconception sev
eral prank callers have had. The
calls "aren't mean at all and are
sometimes funny or informa
tive," Jones said.
"One was a guy who said some
thing like 'Free daddies? I want
one. ... 'I think these people
probably think this is just a joke
or an art project with no deeper
significance."
The Dad Service is something
of an outgrowth of Men in Soli
darity, another group Jones
helped establish last fall. "I am
dissatisfied, to say the least, with
our options as men," Jones wrote
in a statement when he started
Men in Solidarity. "I want some
new options. I want some new
arenas. I want a new masculini
ty."

Jones said he envisions Men in
Solidarity and the Dad Service
working together through perfor
mance art to dispel myths about
gender. Possible plans for the fu
ture include hosting a tofu barbe
cue or obtaining "strollers and
lawnmowers and having a little
parade" in White Plaza.
The message of such gestures
"is a sense of mobility," Jones
said. "People can move through
gender spaces, sex spaces, self
spaces. Move your boundaries
around and explore."
Of course, students who call
the Dad Service might be feeling
more self-indulgent than socially
conscious. This is fine, according
to Morehouse — dads are happy
to oblige self-indulgence.
"It's fun to do something that
makes people laugh and soothes
them at night," he said.

To order a dad, Stanford stu
dents can call Morehouse at 723-
7615, ext. 121, or Jones at 497-
5628.
