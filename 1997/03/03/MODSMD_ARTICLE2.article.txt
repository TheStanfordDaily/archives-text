anxious and weary? Do you want
someone else to just take care of
you?
If you answered yes to any of
the preceding questions, look no
further. The newly created Dad
Service is going to solve all your
problems, and it's going to do it
for free.
Established this quarter, the
service dispatches kindly surro
gate fathers to students' dorms at
night. According to fliers adver
tising the service, dads are able
and willing "to read you a bed
time 3tory, get your last glass of
water for the evening and answer
questions about why the sky is
blue."
The brainchild of seniors
Hayes Morehouse and Nathan
Jones, the Dad Service has two
main goals. "The first is to be
nice, to take care of people. Peo
ple at Stanford are real stressed
out," said Morehouse, a psycholo
gy "The second (goal) is to
question gender roles, whaO it
means to be gendered. We actual
ly have one female dad."
Morehouse said the inspira
tion for the service was an experi
ence he had last Thanksgiving at
a friend's house in Arizona. "I

read abedtime story to a group of
my friends. They loved it. They
were asleep by the time I finished
the story. It was so cute."
Since the official formation of
the service, however, few stu
dents have taken advantage of

the dads. Morehouse, who is one
of the four dads, said calls have
come from his friends, who have
ordered dads for their friends
rather than for themselves.
