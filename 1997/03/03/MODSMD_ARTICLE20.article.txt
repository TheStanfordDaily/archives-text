# Men continue Maples streak, rain treys on Cal
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
There was little mystery sur
rounding California's game plan
heading into Saturday morn
ing's 10 a.m. showdown between
the Golden Bears and No. 25
Stanford.
Cal, with 6-foot-6, 250-pound
forward Tony Gonzalez starting
in place of the injured Ed Gray,
was going to pound it inside on
the Cardinal and play relentless
defense, using the same formula
that helped the Bears earn a 70-
64 win over the Cardinal on Jan.
29.
But the difference on this day
was 7,391 packed-in Maples
Pavilion fans — many of them
no doubt braving Saturday
morning hangovers. All season
long Stanford's shots have found
their way to the bottom of the
net at Maples, and Saturday
morning was no different ts the
Cardinal buried 11-of-22 ree
pointers to key a 73-63 wii
"When we're wide open, we're
not going to miss — at home,"
said freshman guard David
Moseley, who burned the Bears
for four three-pointers, nearly
all on wide-open looks.
"When you get it sold out like
this, it gets loud, and I think
that's what puts us over the
hump," said senior point guard
Brevin Knight, who tied a school
record with 13 assists. "We don't
have to deal with any of the
heckling; we don't have to worry
about periphery stuff because
everyone's on your side. It's
your comfort zone."
Stanford's 10-0 record at
Maples Pavilion this year is a
testament to that. The Cardinal
(18-7, 10-6 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), which now moves into a
fourth-place tie with Cal (19-8,
10-6), has won its home games

this season by an average mar
gin of 25.8 points.
Saturday Stanford won by
neutralizing Cal's inside game
and making the most of its out
side shot opportunities. Sopho
more wings Arthur Lee and Kris
Weems and Moseley combined
for 42 points, with 33 of them
coming on shots outside of 17
feet.
"They hit some pretty tough
shots — they really did," said
Cal coach Ben Braun. "They
should play a couple more games
at 10 in the morning."
While Stanford did get out
rebounded 43-38, it was effective
in pressuring the low post, hold
ing Cal big men Michael Stew
art, Alfred Grigsby, Kenyon
Jones and Sean Marks to 8-of-25
shooting.
"We did not guard people
away from the basket," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery, who became the only
man other than Howie Dallman
to lead the Cardinal to 200 victo
ries. "We knew that maybe their
big kids were not great shooters
away from the basket.
"The one concession that we
did not make was to [senior Cal
guard Randy] Duck. We felt that
Randy would take up some of
Gray's slack in terms of looking
to shoot the ball."
Duck did make 4-of-7 treys en
route to a team-high 16 points,
but more impressive was the
performance of the senior part
time tight end Gonzalez, who
tallied 14 points and nine
rebounds and showed a nice
touch from mid-range through
out.
He was also a favorite of Stan
ford's Sixth Man Club, which
mercilessly harassed the junior
forward with chants of "fum
ble" — a reference to Gonzalez's
error that secured Stanford's

Big Game win over Cal two years
ago — and "C-F-L," a dig at
Gonzalez's future in pro foot
ball.
"I love the crowd," said an
amused Gonzalez after the
game. "That's definitely one
thing I'm going to miss next year
— the whole college atmo
sphere."
Sophomore Tim Young, who
was shut down in the Bears' ear
lier win, showed improvement —
not to mention a couple of nifty
drop-step moves — in an eight
point, six-rebound performance.
The 7-foot-l center also gave
fans a special treat with a rare
dunk, a left-handed jam with 1
minute, 4 seconds remaining in
the first half that capped an 8-0
spurt and stretched the Cardi
nal's lead to 12, its largest mar
gin up to that point.
Gal went into the half trailing
by only seven, but the Bears
would get no closer than six in
the second half. Stanford was in
firm control throughout the
final 20 minutes and stretched
its lead to as much as 20 — on a
dazzling reverse layup by Mose
ley with 4:15 remaining.
The Cardinal's flawless home
record will be tested Thursday
by No. 15 Arizona and again Sat
urday by Arizona State. While
Stanford can probably secure an
NGAA tournament berth with a
split, a sweep would put the Car
dinal on much more solid
ground.
Asked if he thought one more
win would get his team in, Mont
gomery said, "I don't know.
Nobody knows. The committee
knows, and they'll know next
Sunday."
"But this one was huge, no
question. I wouldn't have liked
to go into next week without this
one. I think the pressure would
have been immense."
