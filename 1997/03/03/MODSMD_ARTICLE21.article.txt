# Swimmers and divers take Pac-10 title

### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving team
continued to build its dynasty over the weekend in
Federal Way, Wash., as the squad captured its 11th
straight Pacific 10 Conference championship.
The Cardinal squad won in convincing fashion,
beating out second-place USC by 363 points. Stanford,
which finished with 1,573 points, was led by two-time
Olympic gold medalist Catherine Fox, who won the
100-yard freestyle with a Pac-10 record time of 48.90
seconds.
"I wasn't feeling that much pressure to score points
or to win, I was just out there to have fun," said Fox,
who also won the 100 backstroke and the 100 butter
fly. "I wasn't that nervous, and I just wanted to go out
there and swim my best."
The meet was Fox's first championship meet as a
Cardinal swimmer, but her international experience,
which has helped her during the entire season, was an
added bonus once again over the weekend.
"I knew that I had put a lot of training into this
year and that I had to rely on what (coach) Richard
(Quick) had taught me and what I had already learned

and try to swim the best that I could," she said. "I
knew that if I concentrated and put all my energy into
it, I would swim 100 percent that day."
Although the result was the same for the Cardinal,
the way the team won the championship was different
in two main respects. First, the team uncharacteristi
cally did not win that many events but instead placed
a multitude of swimmers in the final races, all of
whom scored points.
"I don't think the focus was any different," said
senior co-captain Michelle Jesperson. "Our goal was to
pack the finals, and we definitely did that. We just
wanted to keep the ratios up against teams like USC
and Arizona. So we definitely achieved that goal, which
gave us the depth that was needed to win the meet."
The second change to the championship meet was
that the diving competition was held on the same days
in the same natatorium as the swim meet. In previous
years, the diving was held in separate places from the
swimming, even though the divers' points contributed
to the Pac-10 title.
The swimmers got a big boost from the divers, as
senior Megan Gardner won both the one-meter plat
form and the springboard competitions. Gardner was
excited to be a part of the entire meet this year.

"It felt great," Gardner said. "It felt a lot different
than past Pac-10 meets because you could see what
you were contributing. This time I actually felt pres
sure to score points for the swimmers — but it was a
good feeling."
The swimmers were just as happy to see the divers
at the meet, too.
"This year's meet was really neat because we've
never seen the divers compete before," said senior co
captain Sarah Anderson. "The divers were really
something special to watch."
Overall, the Stanford swimmers won just six
events. In addition to Fox's three wins, the team also
took top honors in three relay events — the 400 free,
the 200 medley and the 800 free.
"For the most part we were pretty solid. A couple of
the other teams really messed up, but we really swam
well," Anderson said. "The freshmen really stepped
up, and everyone who rested for the meet swam really
well."
The team now has almost three weeks to rest
before the NCAA championships, which will be held in
Indianapolis March 20-22. The Cardinal, which has
not lost a meet all season, appears to be well on its way
to its sixth straight national championship.
