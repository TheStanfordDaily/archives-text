# Baseball sweeps USC for first time in six years
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
Take out your biggest dustpan,
ladies and gentlemen, because this
was one huge sweep.
The No. 9 Stanford men's baseball
team (15-6, 3-0 Six-Pac) took three
games from No. 3 USC (17-6, 2-4) in
its Pacific 10 Southern Division
opener at Sunken Diamond this
weekend, winning 4-0, 5-4 (in 12
innings) and 22-13 in the chaotic
finale yesterday.
Cardinal skipper Mark Marquess
summed up the weekend perfectly in
one word: "Fantastic."
"Unbelievable," said junior pitch
er Kyle Peterson.
"Perfect," said sophomore pitcher
Brent Hoard.
Prior to this weekend, the Card
had a nine-game losing streak
against the Trojans, including being
swept at home in two consecutive
series. What a difference a year
makes.
In Friday's hyped pitchers' duel
between 1995 Six-Pac co-pitchers of
the year, Peterson and USC's Randy
Flores, Peterson and the Cardinal
stole the show. Improving to 3-1,
Peterson set the tone for the series
with a complete-game shutout, lead
ing the team to a 4-0 victory. While
not dominating the Trojans, Peter
son allowed just six hits in nine
innings, striking out six and walking
none.
Stanford got on the board in the
third inning with freshman John
Gall's RBI double. Gall and sopho
more Jody Gerut extended the Card's
lead with RBI singles in the fifth
inning, driving Flores out of the

game. Junior shortstop Jay Pecci
went 3-for-4 with two doubles, two
runs scored and one RBI in the win
ning effort.
Saturday's battle lasted 12
innings, with Stanford senior left
fielder Chris Clark scoring the win
ning run 5-4, on a throwing error by
USC first baseman Greg Walbridge.
Clark led off the 12th with a double,
and Pecci followed with an infield
single. Junior second baseman Joe
Kilburg drew an intentional walk,
and with the bases loaded, freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth grounded
a ball to Walbridge. What should
have been a routine ground ball
turned into the game-winning play as
Walbridge's throw bounced and
ended up at the backstop, and the
Cardinal ended up with the win.
"Our experience in close games so
far this year has paid off," senior
Luke Quaccia said.
Sophomore pitcher Tony Cogan
had another magnificent outing,
shutting out the Trojans for six
innings. Usually appearing in a clos
ing role, Cogan had not pitched more
than three innings until Saturday
but lasted six with no trouble. Cogan
has allowed only one run in 27 1/3
innings this season.
USC's Seth Etherton, 1996 Six-
Pac pitcher of the year, went only 5
2/3 innings for the Trojans.
Yesterday's game was a battle of a
different sort, a battle of the bats. In
a game that turned into a slugfest,
Stanford (baseball, not football) won
22-13. The last time the Cardinal was
involved in a 35-run game was when
Stanford beat Division 111 Stanislaus
State 35-0 Feb. 11, 1986.
Stanford scored what appeared to

be an insurmountable nine runs in
the first inning, sending 13 batters to
the plate. Muth and Gerut started
the first rally with back-to-back
home runs, followed by senior Luke
Quaccia's double and junior catcher
Jon Schaeffer's first career triple off
the 400-foot mark on the center-field
wall.
The rest of the lineup kept up the
rally, as the Cardinal compiled seven

extra base hits in the first inning
alone.
Gerut led the offense with four
hits and five RBIs and Kilburg, and
Muth and Gall all scored four runs.
With eight doubles, a triple, three
home runs, 22 hits and 22 runs, the
Card applied a severe beating to
USC's pitching staff. The Trojans

used seven pitchers in an
attempt to contain Stanford's
offense, but the Cardinal scored
on all but one of the pitchers.
USC scored 10 straight runs
to briefly take the lead in the
fourth, and the game remained
close until the bottom of the
sixth. Stanford broke the game
open 19-12 with a five-run
inning. After a seven-run Trojan
third inning, Stanford's pitching
was settled down by lefty Hoard.
He pitched the final six innings
in relief of sophomore starter
Chad Hutchinson and picked up
his fourth victory.
"Our hitters picked up the
Ipitching) staff today," Hoard
said. "They helped with a lot of
two-out hits. This is a perfect
way to start the conference" sea

Take out your biggest dustpan,
ladies and gentlemen, because this
was one huge sweep.
The No. 9 Stanford men's baseball
team (15-6, 3-0 Six-Pac) took three
games from No. 3 USC (17-6, 2-4) in
its Pacific 10 Southern Division
opener at Sunken Diamond this
weekend, winning 4-0, 5-4 (in 12
innings) and 22-13 in the chaotic
finale yesterday.
Cardinal skipper Mark Marquess
summed up the weekend perfectly in
one word: "Fantastic."
"Unbelievable," said junior pitch
er Kyle Peterson.
"Perfect," said sophomore pitcher
Brent Hoard.
Prior to this weekend, the Card
had a nine-game losing streak
against the Trojans, including being
swept at home in two consecutive
series. What a difference a year
makes.
In Friday's hyped pitchers' duel
between 1995 Six-Pac co-pitchers of
the year, Peterson and USC's Randy
Flores, Peterson and the Cardinal
stole the show. Improving to 3-1,
Peterson set the tone for the series
with a complete-game shutout, lead
ing the team to a 4-0 victory. While
not dominating the Trojans, Peter
son allowed just six hits in nine
innings, striking out six and walking
none.
Stanford got on the board in the
third inning with freshman John
Gall's RBI double. Gall and sopho
more Jody Gerut extended the Card's
lead with RBI singles in the fifth
inning, driving Flores out of the

game. Junior shortstop Jay Pecci
went 3-for-4 with two doubles, two
runs scored and one RBI in the win
ning effort.
Saturday's battle lasted 12
innings, with Stanford senior left
fielder Chris Clark scoring the win
ning run 5-4, on a throwing error by
USC first baseman Greg Walbridge.
Clark led off the 12th with a double,
and Pecci followed with an infield
single. Junior second baseman Joe
Kilburg drew an intentional walk,
and with the bases loaded, freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth grounded
a ball to Walbridge. What should
have been a routine ground ball
turned into the game-winning play as
Walbridge's throw bounced and
ended up at the backstop, and the
Cardinal ended up with the win.
"Our experience in close games so
far this year has paid off," senior
Luke Quaccia said.
Sophomore pitcher Tony Cogan
had another magnificent outing,
shutting out the Trojans for six
innings. Usually appearing in a clos
ing role, Cogan had not pitched more
than three innings until Saturday
but lasted six with no trouble. Cogan
has allowed only one run in 27 1/3
innings this season.
USC's Seth Etherton, 1996 Six-
Pac pitcher of the year, went only 5
2/3 innings for the Trojans.
Yesterday's game was a battle of a
different sort, a battle of the bats. In
a game that turned into a slugfest,
Stanford (baseball, not football) won
22-13. The last time the Cardinal was
involved in a 35-run game was when
Stanford beat Division 111 Stanislaus
State 35-0 Feb. 11, 1986.
Stanford scored what appeared to

be an insurmountable nine runs in
the first inning, sending 13 batters to
the plate. Muth and Gerut started
the first rally with back-to-back
home runs, followed by senior Luke
Quaccia's double and junior catcher
Jon Schaeffer's first career triple off
the 400-foot mark on the center-field
wall.
The rest of the lineup kept up the
rally, as the Cardinal compiled seven

extra base hits in the first inning
alone.
Gerut led the offense with four
hits and five RBIs and Kilburg, and
Muth and Gall all scored four runs.
With eight doubles, a triple, three
home runs, 22 hits and 22 runs, the
Card applied a severe beating to
USC's pitching staff. The Trojans

used seven pitchers in an
attempt to contain Stanford's
offense, but the Cardinal scored
on all but one of the pitchers.
USC scored 10 straight runs
to briefly take the lead in the
fourth, and the game remained
close until the bottom of the
sixth. Stanford broke the game
open 19-12 with a five-run
inning. After a seven-run Trojan
third inning, Stanford's pitching
was settled down by lefty Hoard.
He pitched the final six innings
in relief of sophomore starter
Chad Hutchinson and picked up
his fourth victory.
"Our hitters picked up the
Ipitching) staff today," Hoard
said. "They helped with a lot of
two-out hits. This is a perfect
way to start the conference" sea
son.
