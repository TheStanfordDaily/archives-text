# Spikers avenge loss to Trojans
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team contin
ued its dominance of teams at home with two
important Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
wins over the weekend. Both USC and Long
Beach State, Stanford's two victims, are also
members of Stanford's division in the two-divi
sion MPSF.
In Friday night's match at Maples Pavilion,
the stage was set for the Cardinal to come out
ready to play and to dispatch the Trojans in
quick fashion. That was the team's goal after
having lost to USC earlier this season in a
match when Stanford beat the Trojans in the
first game and then allowed them to win in
four games. Early on, it appeared that all of
Stanford's goals for this match would be
unachievable.
From the start of game one, the Card was
not playing its best volleyball. USC took advan
tage of Stanford's weak play, dominating the
first game and winning in relatively easy fash
ion 15-10. The Trojan hitters were dominant,
hitting an impressive .588 to the Cardinal's
.256.
Game two followed a similar pattern, at least
early on. Once again USC moved out to an early
lead, but on the back of strong defense and the
play of senior middle blocker Mike Hoefer, the
Card started a comeback, getting to within one
point of USC late in the match at 12-11. Howev
er, just as it looked like Stanford was about to
turn the tables, the Trojans ended the game, tak
ing three straight points for a 15-11 victory.
Two games down and playing against a tough
Trojan team, it looked as though the match was
just about over for Stanford. The beginning of
the third game saw Stanford trail early but rally
from a 7-4 deficit to capture the game in decep
tively easy fashion 15-7.
After struggling in the first two games, senior
outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer played very well
in the latter half of the match, beginning in game
three when he helped carry the team to victory.
In addition to Fuerbringer's strong play, Stan
ford's defense was outstanding, holding the Tro
jans to .103 hitting for the game, while achieving
a .417 mark if its own.
In game four Fuerbringer again led the Car
dinal to a win. evening the match at two games
apiece with a 15-9 victory. Once again, it was
Stanford's defense that made the difference. The
Cardinal seemed to dig every ball USC sent its
way and limited the Trojans to another poor hit
ting performance.
Game five was never close, and despite the 15-
10 score the Trojans were never in the game.
"I thought we played well late in the match,"
said player of the match Mike Hoefer. "It was
great that so many fans came out; they really
helped us get this win."
The Cardinal fired on all cylinders, with every
player on the floor performing well. Senior out
side hitter Mike Lambert rebounded from some
difficulty in the middle of the match to augment
Stanford's power while freshman outside hitter
Andy Witt provided powerful serv
ing and strong blocking. USC was
helpless, only mustering four total
kills to go with four errors.
"We were all nervous after the
first two games," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We came back
strong though. Hoefer was our
most consistently good player.
Both Fuerbringer and Lambert
struggled at times, but they
stepped it up when it really mat
tered. Tad [Hoffman] did a super

job off of the bench. This was a
really big win for us."
Saturday's match against Long
Beach State was never in doubt.
Although Nieves feared that the
team might suffer a letdown
because of its tough match the
previous night, there was no evi
dence of this.
In game one the team got off to
a strong start as senior setter
Stewart Chong, not normally
thought of as a powerful server,
deceived Long Beach with his
knuckleball-like serve, leading
Stanford to an early 3-0 advan
tage. The Cardinal continued to
build its lead, eventually leading

11-2 and going on to win 15-3.
Games two and three were con
ducted in essentially the same ho
hum manner. Stanford's domi
nance continued, and the 49ers'
troubles persisted. Stanford won
game two 15-2 and after leading 8-
0 and 14-4 in the third game even
tually won the match 15-7. Despite
the Somewhat closer score of game
three, it was never a contest.
Chong controlled the match,
setting ball after ball in perfect
position for the Stanford hitters to
pound to the floor, providing great
defense and contributing strong
blocking, unusual for a 5-foot-10
player. Understandably he was

named the player of the match.
"People do set a lot of balls my
way because I'm short," Chong
said. "I get more opportunities for
blocks than the other guys, so I
ought to come up with some. This
weekend was really good. It has
been nice to come home after los
ing to BYU and win four in a row."
Indeed, if Stanford, who hit an
incredible .607 for the match, con
tinues to play in the fashion that it
did in the final three games Friday
and in all three games of Satur
day's match, the four-match
streak Chong talked about may
keep growing until the end of
May.
