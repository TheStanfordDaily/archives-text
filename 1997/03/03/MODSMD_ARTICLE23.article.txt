The Stanford men's volleyball team contin
ued its dominance of teams at home with two
important Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
wins over the weekend. Both USC and Long
Beach State, Stanford's two victims, are also
members of Stanford's division in the two-divi
sion MPSF.
In Friday night's match at Maples Pavilion,
the stage was set for the Cardinal to come out
ready to play and to dispatch the Trojans in
quick fashion. That was the team's goal after
having lost to USC earlier this season in a
match when Stanford beat the Trojans in the
first game and then allowed them to win in
four games. Early on, it appeared that all of
Stanford's goals for this match would be
unachievable.
From the start of game one, the Card was
not playing its best volleyball. USC took advan
tage of Stanford's weak play, dominating the
first game and winning in relatively easy fash
ion 15-10. The Trojan hitters were dominant,
hitting an impressive .588 to the Cardinal's
.256.
Game two followed a similar pattern, at least
early on. Once again USC moved out to an early
lead, but on the back of strong defense and the
play of senior middle blocker Mike Hoefer, the
Card started a comeback, getting to within one
point of USC late in the match at 12-11. Howev
er, just as it looked like Stanford was about to
turn the tables, the Trojans ended the game, tak
ing three straight points for a 15-11 victory.
Two games down and playing against a tough
Trojan team, it looked as though the match was
just about over for Stanford. The beginning of
the third game saw Stanford trail early but rally
from a 7-4 deficit to capture the game in decep
tively easy fashion 15-7.
After struggling in the first two games, senior
outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer played very well
in the latter half of the match, beginning in game
three when he helped carry the team to victory.
In addition to Fuerbringer's strong play, Stan
ford's defense was outstanding, holding the Tro
jans to .103 hitting for the game, while achieving
a .417 mark if its own.
In game four Fuerbringer again led the Car
dinal to a win. evening the match at two games
apiece with a 15-9 victory. Once again, it was
Stanford's defense that made the difference. The
Cardinal seemed to dig every ball USC sent its
way and limited the Trojans to another poor hit
ting performance.
Game five was never close, and despite the 15-
10 score the Trojans were never in the game.
"I thought we played well late in the match,"
said player of the match Mike Hoefer. "It was
great that so many fans came out; they really
helped us get this win."
The Cardinal fired on all cylinders, with every
player on the floor performing well. Senior out
side hitter Mike Lambert rebounded from some
difficulty in the middle of the match to augment
Stanford's power while freshman outside hitter
