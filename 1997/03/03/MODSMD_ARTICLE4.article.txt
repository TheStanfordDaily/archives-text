# Athletics Dept depends on corporate sponsors
## 
### Hugh Handeyside Contributing writer 
Financially supporting one of
the most successful collegiate ath
letic departments in the nation is
not cheap. To attract coaches and
athletes of Stanford caliber, the
Department of Athletics relies on
corporate sponsorship for much of
its funding.
Robert Carruesco, a marketing
manager in the Athletics Depart
ment, said there are about 70
sources considered official spon
sors of Stanford athletics, paying
anywhere from $500 to several
hundred thousand dollars yearly
for exposure to Stanford athletes
and fans.
Carruesco cited Pepsi Co.,
Citibank, Fry's Electronics and
State Farm Insurance as the de
partment's most substantial spon
sors, each giving between
$100,000 and $300,000. In return,
the sponsors are allowed radio
time during broadcasts of athletic
events or the use of signs in athlet
ic facilities. For sponsors that pro
vide equipment, logos are dis
played on uniforms and other
clothing.
"College sports more and more
cannot be a drain financially for
the university," explained assis
tant women's tennis coach Lele
Forood. "They have to justify
themselves to the university, so
college athletic sponsorships are
not going to go away."
Assoc. Athletic Director for Ex
ternal Relations Jon Denney
echoed this prediction. "We've just
scratched the surface in terms of
potential sponsors for Stanford.
It's exciting; it's revenue that we
need."
The corporate presence
While athletics departments
have embraced opportunities for
outside funding, concern has
arisen recently in the sports world
that increased corporate presence
on the field diverts attention from
the benefits of athletics as compet
itive contests.
"It started in the NFL and the
NBA, and it kind of filtered down
from there," said equipment man
ager Pat Marcuccillo. "The bottom
line is exposure. If we weren't on
TV, I guarantee we wouldn't get

anything. We'd be out there in our
BVDs."
Susan Burk, director of student
services at the Athletics Depart
ment, recalled that athletic offi
cials were told they could not leave
the press box of Coca-Cola spon
sored NCAA events with a Pepsi in
their hands. Marcuccillo told of a
nearby college that lost a corporate
contract for taping over the spon
sor's logo on athletes' shoes
Corporate wariness of their
level of exposure has extended to
placing "spotters" on the sidelines
of athletic events. Chad Hutchin
son, a quarterback for the football
team and a pitcher for the baseball
team, said during the first football

game of the season his jersey was
missing a Nike swoosh. A Nike
spotter recognized the mistake,
and the next morning Nike noti
fied the department and asked
that it be corrected.
Nike is partly charged with
originating this obsession in cor
porate sponsors with commercial
exposure. "Guerrilla marketing,"
a strategy that Nike basically in
vented and mastered, has made
the Nike swoosh a übiquitous sym
bol of the sports world and pro
pelled Nike into international re
pute as a premier sports equip
ment supplier.
