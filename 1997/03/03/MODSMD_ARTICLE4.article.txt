# Athletics Dept depends on corporate sponsors
## 
### Hugh Handeyside Contributing writer 
Financially supporting one of
the most successful collegiate ath
letic departments in the nation is
not cheap. To attract coaches and
athletes of Stanford caliber, the
Department of Athletics relies on
corporate sponsorship for much of
its funding.
Robert Carruesco, a marketing
manager in the Athletics Depart
ment, said there are about 70
sources considered official spon
sors of Stanford athletics, paying
anywhere from $500 to several
hundred thousand dollars yearly
for exposure to Stanford athletes
and fans.
Carruesco cited Pepsi Co.,
Citibank, Fry's Electronics and
State Farm Insurance as the de
partment's most substantial spon
sors, each giving between
$100,000 and $300,000. In return,
the sponsors are allowed radio
time during broadcasts of athletic
events or the use of signs in athlet
ic facilities. For sponsors that pro
vide equipment, logos are dis
played on uniforms and other
clothing.
"College sports more and more
cannot be a drain financially for
the university," explained assis
tant women's tennis coach Lele
Forood. "They have to justify
themselves to the university, so
college athletic sponsorships are
not going to go away."
Assoc. Athletic Director for Ex
ternal Relations Jon Denney
echoed this prediction. "We've just
scratched the surface in terms of
potential sponsors for Stanford.
It's exciting; it's revenue that we
need."
The corporate presence
While athletics departments
have embraced opportunities for
outside funding, concern has
arisen recently in the sports world
that increased corporate presence
on the field diverts attention from
the benefits of athletics as compet
itive contests.
"It started in the NFL and the
NBA, and it kind of filtered down
from there," said equipment man
ager Pat Marcuccillo. "The bottom
line is exposure. If we weren't on
TV, I guarantee we wouldn't get

anything. We'd be out there in our
BVDs."
Susan Burk, director of student
services at the Athletics Depart
ment, recalled that athletic offi
cials were told they could not leave
the press box of Coca-Cola spon
sored NCAA events with a Pepsi in
their hands. Marcuccillo told of a
nearby college that lost a corporate
contract for taping over the spon
sor's logo on athletes' shoes
Corporate wariness of their
level of exposure has extended to
placing "spotters" on the sidelines
of athletic events. Chad Hutchin
son, a quarterback for the football
team and a pitcher for the baseball
team, said during the first football

game of the season his jersey was
missing a Nike swoosh. A Nike
spotter recognized the mistake,
and the next morning Nike noti
fied the department and asked
that it be corrected.
Nike is partly charged with
originating this obsession in cor
porate sponsors with commercial
exposure. "Guerrilla marketing,"
a strategy that Nike basically in
vented and mastered, has made
the Nike swoosh a übiquitous sym
bol of the sports world and pro
pelled Nike into international re
pute as a premier sports equip
ment supplier.

By making the Nike swoosh un
avoidable to television cameras,
Nike circumvents the need to ad
vertise conventionally.
"They know the marketing and
advertising game so well, and they
have become such an integral part
of athletics that a lot of the stuff
they do they don't pay for," said
Carruesco. "They have so saturat
ed the athletic arena that it's im
possible to keep them out. We
don't necessarily get paid for a lot
of the exposure they're getting."
Athletic Director Ted Leland
agreed. "They're on the cutting
edge. They're the guys that evepr
body looks at in terms of their in
fluence in the sport world. They're
the best guerrilla marketers in the
country, and a lot of people would
say they're the best at marketing
to young people."
Nike's expertise in catering to
youth is such that its marketing
team provides Stanford with ad
vice as a part of the company's
$700,000 contract with the Uni
versity.

Amateur advertisers?
Tied to the issue of exposure is
that of sponsors using amateur
athletes to advertise products
without pay. Although the NCAA
prohibits amateurs from endors
ing products, some have argued
that amateurs cannot avoid doing
so in college athletics today.
"I think [sponsors] do use col
lege athletics," said Leland, "but
the college athletics department is
a willing co-conspirator because
the funding is important to us in
terms of running our programs. If
funding weren't important, Nike
swooshes would not be on uni
forms."
Leland stressed that he felt the
University's Nike contract was
"mutually beneficial," yet he did
express some concern for the mes
sage athletes are receiving.
"I am a little concerned about
using athletes as billboards," he
said. "I think the biggest problem
is that athletes would think, 'The
Athletics Department is making
all this money off me, and I'm not
allowed to make money off my
self.' There's a cynical sense of be
trayal there."
Cross country runner Allison
Twist, a sophomore, said she

would wear Nike products even if
they were not supplied to the team,
but that she felt "like athletes are
pawns in this huge game."
Other athletes saw no problem
in Nike's aggressive marketing.
"We get shoes, we get jackets, all
that stuff gets taken care of," said
sophomore Tate Blahnik, a swim
mer. "I think it's a good deal."
Hutchinson agreed. "In a way it
is free advertising, but I don't
think much of it. You're repre
senting them, but they're also giv
ing you top-of-the-line equip
ment."
Kit Morris, Nike's NCAA rela
tions liaison, explained simply,
"We are providing universities
with equipment and apparel, and
those teams are the beneficiaries
of that agreement. It is important
for us to have an authoritative
presence on the field but also to be
good citizens."
Most coaches expressed little
concern about the use of amateur
athletes for advertisement by
sponsors. "The coaches are profes
sional, the athletes are amateur,
and they've chosen to be amateur
and to abide by NCAA regula
tions," said men's volleyball head
coach Ruben Nieves.

Assistant men's basketball
coach Doug Oliver felt the adver
tising issue was not important.
"We don't get involved with the
thought process behind all that.
If we have a problem, it's an
swered."
Nike's most recent marketing
strategy is to endorse entire ath
letics departments and supply
equipment for all of that school's
varsity teams. The University of
Michigan, Ohio State University
and USC, among others, are all
"Nike campuses." The Stanford
Athletics Department is seeking
such a contract. Currently, several
sports such as the volleyball
teams, have contracts with other
companies, including as Reebok.
The coach's role
Most college sponsorship con
tracts, however, are negotiated
personally by head coaches.
Nieves described his deal with
Side-Out Sport as "very person
al," yet he said that coaches are
"encouraged to go out and get as
many sponsors we can for our
selves because the more sponsors
we have, the less strain it puts on
the department as a whole."
As a part of some Nike contracts,

coaches are paid individually as
consultants, although at Stanford
the details of such contracts are un
available to the public.
"They're just a subsidy some
what because you are using Nike
products," explained assistant
football coach David Tipton of the
deals with head coaches, adding
that as an assistant coach he and
his family receive Nike products
free.
In the case of men's tennis
coach Dick Gould, the personal
contract with Nike involves a com
mitment to summer clinics, prod
uct testing and speaking events.
"Pretty soon, it's not going to
matter which coach is and which
coach isn't [receiving money],"
said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney, referring to the upcoming
department-wide deal with Nike.
"The student athlete is getting
everything allowable within
NCAA rules."
Although the NCAA is current
ly considering a regulation that
would require all contracts to be
made directly with institution ath
letics departments, there are cur
rently no restrictions on either the
size of a sponsor's donation or the
parties with whom contracts can

be made.
"The only kind of policy we
have regards the size of the com
pany's logo," said Alfred White, di
rector of promotions at the NCAA.
"We don't concern ourselves un
less our membership is con
cerned."
Current regulations require
that equipment shall bear only the
manufacturer's normal label, not
to exceed 2 1/4 square inches in
area.
Most coaches stressed the over
all superiority in the quality of
Nike products. "From our stand
point, there would be a concern if
it weren't a top-of-the-line prod
uct," said Oliver. "Nike has gone
out of their way to provide for the
athlete."
Forood was similarly positive
about Nike. "We seldom get told
'no,'" she said.
Leland was more cautious
about the benefits of college ath
letics sponsorships.
"We struggle to balance it every
day,"he said. "In the best of all
worlds we'd be fully funded and
every decision we'd make down
here would be purely educational,
but we have to make some busi
ness decisions."

team, said during the first football

game of the season his jersey was
missing a Nike swoosh. A Nike
spotter recognized the mistake,
and the next morning Nike noti
fied the department and asked
that it be corrected.
Nike is partly charged with
originating this obsession in cor
porate sponsors with commercial
exposure. "Guerrilla marketing,"
a strategy that Nike basically in
vented and mastered, has made
the Nike swoosh a übiquitous sym
bol of the sports world and pro
pelled Nike into international re
pute as a premier sports equip
ment supplier.

By making the Nike swoosh un
avoidable to television cameras,
Nike circumvents the need to ad
vertise conventionally.
"They know the marketing and
advertising game so well, and they
have become such an integral part
of athletics that a lot of the stuff
they do they don't pay for," said
Carruesco. "They have so saturat
ed the athletic arena that it's im
possible to keep them out. We
don't necessarily get paid for a lot
of the exposure they're getting."
Athletic Director Ted Leland
agreed. "They're on the cutting
edge. They're the guys that evepr
body looks at in terms of their in
fluence in the sport world. They're
the best guerrilla marketers in the
country, and a lot of people would
say they're the best at marketing
to young people."
Nike's expertise in catering to
youth is such that its marketing
team provides Stanford with ad
vice as a part of the company's
$700,000 contract with the Uni
versity.

Amateur advertisers?
Tied to the issue of exposure is
that of sponsors using amateur
athletes to advertise products
without pay. Although the NCAA
prohibits amateurs from endors
ing products, some have argued
that amateurs cannot avoid doing
so in college athletics today.
"I think [sponsors] do use col
lege athletics," said Leland, "but
the college athletics department is
a willing co-conspirator because
the funding is important to us in
terms of running our programs. If
funding weren't important, Nike
swooshes would not be on uni
forms."
Leland stressed that he felt the
University's Nike contract was
"mutually beneficial," yet he did
express some concern for the mes
sage athletes are receiving.
"I am a little concerned about
using athletes as billboards," he
said. "I think the biggest problem
is that athletes would think, 'The
Athletics Department is making
all this money off me, and I'm not
allowed to make money off my
self.' There's a cynical sense of be
trayal there."
Cross country runner Allison
Twist, a sophomore, said she

would wear Nike products even if
they were not supplied to the team,
but that she felt "like athletes are
pawns in this huge game."
Other athletes saw no problem
in Nike's aggressive marketing.
"We get shoes, we get jackets, all
that stuff gets taken care of," said
sophomore Tate Blahnik, a swim
mer. "I think it's a good deal."
Hutchinson agreed. "In a way it
is free advertising, but I don't
think much of it. You're repre
senting them, but they're also giv
ing you top-of-the-line equip
ment."
Kit Morris, Nike's NCAA rela
tions liaison, explained simply,
"We are providing universities
with equipment and apparel, and
those teams are the beneficiaries
of that agreement. It is important
for us to have an authoritative
presence on the field but also to be
good citizens."
Most coaches expressed little
concern about the use of amateur
athletes for advertisement by
sponsors. "The coaches are profes
sional, the athletes are amateur,
and they've chosen to be amateur
and to abide by NCAA regula
tions," said men's volleyball head
coach Ruben Nieves.

Assistant men's basketball
coach Doug Oliver felt the adver
tising issue was not important.
"We don't get involved with the
thought process behind all that.
If we have a problem, it's an
swered."
Nike's most recent marketing
strategy is to endorse entire ath
letics departments and supply
equipment for all of that school's
varsity teams. The University of
Michigan, Ohio State University
and USC, among others, are all
"Nike campuses." The Stanford
Athletics Department is seeking
such a contract. Currently, several
sports such as the volleyball
teams, have contracts with other
companies, including as Reebok.
The coach's role
Most college sponsorship con
tracts, however, are negotiated
personally by head coaches.
Nieves described his deal with
Side-Out Sport as "very person
al," yet he said that coaches are
"encouraged to go out and get as
many sponsors we can for our
selves because the more sponsors
we have, the less strain it puts on
the department as a whole."
As a part of some Nike contracts,

coaches are paid individually as
consultants, although at Stanford
the details of such contracts are un
available to the public.
"They're just a subsidy some
what because you are using Nike
products," explained assistant
football coach David Tipton of the
deals with head coaches, adding
that as an assistant coach he and
his family receive Nike products
free.
In the case of men's tennis
coach Dick Gould, the personal
contract with Nike involves a com
mitment to summer clinics, prod
uct testing and speaking events.
"Pretty soon, it's not going to
matter which coach is and which
coach isn't [receiving money],"
said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney, referring to the upcoming
department-wide deal with Nike.
"The student athlete is getting
everything allowable within
NCAA rules."
Although the NCAA is current
ly considering a regulation that
would require all contracts to be
made directly with institution ath
letics departments, there are cur
rently no restrictions on either the
size of a sponsor's donation or the
parties with whom contracts can

be made.
"The only kind of policy we
have regards the size of the com
pany's logo," said Alfred White, di
rector of promotions at the NCAA.
"We don't concern ourselves un
less our membership is con
cerned."
Current regulations require
that equipment shall bear only the
manufacturer's normal label, not
to exceed 2 1/4 square inches in
area.
Most coaches stressed the over
all superiority in the quality of
Nike products. "From our stand
point, there would be a concern if
it weren't a top-of-the-line prod
uct," said Oliver. "Nike has gone
out of their way to provide for the
athlete."
Forood was similarly positive
about Nike. "We seldom get told
'no,'" she said.
Leland was more cautious
about the benefits of college ath
letics sponsorships.
"We struggle to balance it every
day,"he said. "In the best of all
worlds we'd be fully funded and
every decision we'd make down
here would be purely educational,
but we have to make some busi
ness decisions."
Financially supporting one of
the most successful collegiate ath
letic departments in the nation is
not cheap. To attract coaches and
athletes of Stanford caliber, the
Department of Athletics relies on
corporate sponsorship for much of
its funding.
Robert Carruesco, a marketing
manager in the Athletics Depart
ment, said there are about 70
sources considered official spon
sors of Stanford athletics, paying
anywhere from $500 to several
hundred thousand dollars yearly
for exposure to Stanford athletes
and fans.
Carruesco cited Pepsi Co.,
Citibank, Fry's Electronics and
State Farm Insurance as the de
partment's most substantial spon
sors, each giving between
$100,000 and $300,000. In return,
the sponsors are allowed radio
time during broadcasts of athletic
events or the use of signs in athlet
ic facilities. For sponsors that pro
vide equipment, logos are dis
played on uniforms and other
clothing.
"College sports more and more
cannot be a drain financially for
the university," explained assis
tant women's tennis coach Lele
Forood. "They have to justify
themselves to the university, so
college athletic sponsorships are
not going to go away."
Assoc. Athletic Director for Ex
ternal Relations Jon Denney
echoed this prediction. "We've just
scratched the surface in terms of
potential sponsors for Stanford.
It's exciting; it's revenue that we
need."
The corporate presence
While athletics departments
have embraced opportunities for
outside funding, concern has
arisen recently in the sports world
that increased corporate presence
on the field diverts attention from
the benefits of athletics as compet
itive contests.
"It started in the NFL and the
NBA, and it kind of filtered down
from there," said equipment man
ager Pat Marcuccillo. "The bottom
line is exposure. If we weren't on
TV, I guarantee we wouldn't get

anything. We'd be out there in our
BVDs."
Susan Burk, director of student
services at the Athletics Depart
ment, recalled that athletic offi
cials were told they could not leave
the press box of Coca-Cola spon
sored NCAA events with a Pepsi in
their hands. Marcuccillo told of a
nearby college that lost a corporate
contract for taping over the spon
sor's logo on athletes' shoes
Corporate wariness of their
level of exposure has extended to
placing "spotters" on the sidelines
of athletic events. Chad Hutchin
son, a quarterback for the football
team and a pitcher for the baseball
team, said during the first football

game of the season his jersey was
missing a Nike swoosh. A Nike
spotter recognized the mistake,
and the next morning Nike noti
fied the department and asked
that it be corrected.
