Engineering-Economic Systems Prof.
William Perry is back on the Farm today.
"He'll stroll into the office, and a person
from the outside would never realize he's the
former secretary of defense," said Walter Fal
con, director of the Institute for International
Studies.
Perry, who resigned from the Clinton ad
ministration following the president's re-elec
tion, will split his time between the Center for
International Security and Arms Control — an
affiliate of the Institute for International Stud
ies — and the Engineering-Economic Systems
and Operations Research Department.
"He's always been a very productive, intel
lectually-stimulating faculty member," said
James Sweeney, the EES / OR chair.
According to Sweeney, Perry will not teach

any classes until fall quarter.
He added that he did not yet
know what classes Perry
would be teaching.
However, Sweeney said he
hopes Perry, along with the
rest of the EES / OR faculty,
will be involved in the plan
ning of the new undergraduate
EES / OR major. Sweeney an
ticipates the major, which is in

and approval process, will begin in the fall of
1998.
Falcon said Perry, will not return as co
chair of the Center for International Security
and Arms Control, his position before he left
for Washington.
"He'll probably play a role in the program's
executive community but not day-to-day man
agement," Falcon said, adding that Perry has

expressed interest in writing a book on securi
ty issues.
A great deal of excitement surrounds
Perry's return to the center, Falcon said.
"He's one of those rare triple-threats," he
said, referring to Perry's academic, govern
ment and business expertise. "There are not
many people like that."
Before serving in the president's cabinet,
Perry founded and was chairman and CEO of
Technology Strategies and Alliances, a Palo
Alto-based firm conducting international tech
nology consulting and analysis.
Falcon said Perry's experience as secretary
of defense during Clinton's first term will in
crease Perry 's expertise.
"He was already at the top of his field before
he left," he said. "He's seen a lot of issues up
front, from food relief to Bosnia. He should be

wonderfully helpful on a whon
set of timely issues."
Perry served at the helm of
the Department of Defense be
ginning in 1994, when he took
over for outgoing Secretary Les
Aspin.
Perry, a professor on the Farm
since 1989, received both his
bachelor's and master's degrees
from Stanford. He holds a doctor
ate in mathematics from Pennsyl
vania State University.
Falcon added that Perry's

presence will bring a number of
contacts and visitors that will
benefit the entire University.
Perry will retain several influ
ential and visible part-time posi
tions in Washington. He holds a
seat on the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board and
is a trustee of the Carnegie En
dowment for International Peace.
He is also expected to continue as
an adviser to the current secre
tary, William Cohen.
A closed reception for Perry
will be held on March 19 at the
Faculty Club, sponsored by the
provost, the Institute for Interna
tional Studies and the EES / OR
Department.
