Students, look out — next year's freshmen
could be your parents.
"If I had college to do over again, I would be
here myself," said Linda Bauer, whose son,
John, is a freshman. Bauer flew in from New
Jersey with her husband, Les, for Parents'
Weekend.
Bauer's sentiments seemed typical of visit

"It's a beautiful place to be," said Jan Vort

"You'd crash," her son countered.
Jack and Susan Salberg, who flew in from
Nashville, Tenn. for the weekend, enjoyed their
brief glimpse of their daughter Rachel's dorm

whole system," Susan Saiberg said. "We spent
some time talking to them this afternoon and
enjoyed it a lot."
Jack Saiberg also voiced his enthusiasm.
"We like Stanford's laid-back atmosphere —

Mike and Carol Flannery from Portland,
Ore., are Parents' Weekend veterans. They pre

Hope '93 and they spent this weekend visiting
their son Matt, a freshman.
"I love coming and seeing all the different
groups, nationalities and interests," said Carol
Flannery. Although they arrived late Friday
