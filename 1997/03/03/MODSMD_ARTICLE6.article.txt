## Visiting parents enjoy classes and weather

Students, look out — next year's freshmen
could be your parents.
"If I had college to do over again, I would be
here myself," said Linda Bauer, whose son,
John, is a freshman. Bauer flew in from New
Jersey with her husband, Les, for Parents'
Weekend.
Bauer's sentiments seemed typical of visit
ing parents, who were impressed with the cam
pus and with the many activities they attended.
"It's a beautiful place to be," said Jan Vort
mann, visiting from Visalia, Calif. "I'd have a
hard time going to classes because it's so beauti
ful outside." Vortmann and her husband Paul,
whose son, Mike, is a freshman, attended the

Friday afternoon classes offered by Dean of Re
ligious Life Robert Gregg and English Prof. Ron
Rebholz.
"The [classes] needed to be longer than 50
minutes," Jan Vortmann said. "They had some
really interesting topics, and everyone would
have liked to hear the professors speak a little
more."
The Vortmanns also learned quickly about
the difficulty of transportation on a large cam
pus. "They should offer bicycles for the visiting
parents," Jan Vortmann suggested.
"You'd crash," her son countered.
Jack and Susan Salberg, who flew in from
Nashville, Tenn. for the weekend, enjoyed their
brief glimpse of their daughter Rachel's dorm
life as a freshman in Toyon Hall. "I'm really im

pressed with the [resident assistants] and the
whole system," Susan Saiberg said. "We spent
some time talking to them this afternoon and
enjoyed it a lot."
Jack Saiberg also voiced his enthusiasm.
"We like Stanford's laid-back atmosphere —
and the lack of snow-covered ground," he said.
Mike and Carol Flannery from Portland,
Ore., are Parents' Weekend veterans. They pre
viously came to the Farm to visit their daughter
Hope '93 and they spent this weekend visiting
their son Matt, a freshman.
"I love coming and seeing all the different
groups, nationalities and interests," said Carol
Flannery. Although they arrived late Friday
evening, the Flannerys planned to
throw themselves into touring and
learning about their son's life on
campus on Saturday.
"I want to make sure I feel like
I'm going to Stanford, too," Mike
Flannery joked.
Linda Bauer experienced this
feeling when she received a special
birthday gift generally reserved for
students — the Mendicants sere
naded her following their concert
with Talisman Friday night. John

Bauer, a member of the Mendi
cants, harmonized with his fellow
singers in a rendition of "Happy
Birthday" for his mother.
"I can't tell you how happy it
makes me," Linda Bauer said af
terward. "This is the best gift I
could have received."
The Bauers said they have
nothing but positive feelings
about Stanford. "I feel that my
son made an excellent choice. I
think the campus is very beauti
ful, and I think the students really
enjoy their life here," Linda Bauer
said.
"I'm very jealous," Les Bauer
added.
