Tornadoes touch down in Arkansas
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Tornadoes killed at least 24 people in Arkansas, rip
ping through Little Rock, Arkadelphia and smaller towns around.
There was a possibility the death toll could climb as rescue workers worked in yes
terday's driving rain to pull away the wreckage, authorities said.
More than 200 people were injured and hundreds of homes, businesses and other
structures were destroyed or damaged along a 260-mile path from Hempstead Coun
ty in the southwest to Greene County in the state's northeastern corner.
The same huge system of thunderstorms also killed as many as seven people in
Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio on Saturday.
LAPD was outgunned by bank robbers
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The two bold gunmen killed in the five-block, rolling gun
fight had a crushing firepower advantage over the police who stopped them.
Police were still sorting out the gunmen's arsenal, but it appeared that each man
had at least one AK-47 automatic rifle or a similar SKS rifle and had 100-round
ammunition drums and 30-round clips, Lt. Nicholas Zingo said.
The gunmen fired steel-jacketed bullets easily capable of penetrating body armor
worn by patrol officers, Cmdr. Tim Mcßride said.
