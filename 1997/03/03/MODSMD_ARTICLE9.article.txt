# Iranian quake claims 3,000 lives
## Series of unconnected tremors shake Asia, affect hundreds of villages 
### 
SHIRAN, Iran (AP) — Temperatures
plunged and a blanket of snow covered
northwestern Iran yesterday, hamper
ing efforts to reach villages devastated
by a massive earthquake that rescuers
say claimed 3,000 lives.
The official toll from Friday quake
stood at 554 but was expected to rise. At
least 2,000 were injured.
The Iranian quake was one of a num
ber that jolted Asian countries over the
last couple of days, including temblors
in Armenia, China and Pakistan. Scien
tists said there was no evidence that any
of them were connected.
Iran estimated the quake's magni
tude at 5.5. The U.S. National Earth
quake Information Center in Golden,
Colo., said it was 6.1.
Kayhan, a daily newspaper, quoted

an official in Iran's hard-hit Ardabil
province as saying that 110 villages
were affected.
The roads leading to the villages were
covered with sheets of ice yesterday,
making access difficult. Most villages had
received some help, but survivors whose
homes were destroyed said they needed
tents and fuel to cope with temperatures
that fell yesterday to 19 degrees.
Some aid workers said a string of vil
lages beyond the Sabalan mountains,
made impenetrable by the snow, may
have been the hardest hit. But they
have been unable to reach the area to
make an assessment.
The death toll in just six villages vis
ited by reporters in Ardabil province
was more than 2,000 people.
Buses and cars crammed with people

began arriving in the villages at the
weekend, carrying families that sought
news of relatives in the devastated area.
A more powerful quake struck west
ern Pakistan on Friday, killing at least
100 people. Pakistan and Iran are hit by
numerous quakes each year.
In the remote corner of western Pak
istan — 1,200 miles southeast of the
Iranian quake site — some of the
injured began arriving Saturday in
Quetta, the nearest big city, about 400
miles southwest of Islamabad. Stretch
ers lined hospital corridors and doctors
made an appeal for blood donations.
Rescuers said more than 100 people
were killed and dozens injured when the
magnitude-7.3 quake shook Baluchis
tan province early Friday — the hardest
hit region was the remote Sibi district.
