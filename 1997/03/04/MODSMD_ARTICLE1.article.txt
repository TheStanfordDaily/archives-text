# SURE to stay at Women's Center
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Although
SURE Escort Ser
vice experienced a
scare with the
possibility of an
other change of
location, the main
office of the cam
pus-wide trans
portation service
will most likely re-

main in its current location in the
Women's Center.
The escort service moved into
the center last quarter after leav
ing Tresidder Union to make room
for Polio Rey restaurant.
Although "noise conflicts" have
come out due to the recent in
crease in evening use of the center
by women, the issue is "still resolv
able," said Director of Student Ac
tivities Nanci Howe.
Some members of the center
said disruptions occur simply be
cause of the additional activities
the transportation service has
brought, said Anne-Marie Nunez,
the center's coordinator.
The center may not be large
enough to handle all of the foot
traffic that now passes through it.
The matter is "not too serious,"
said Howe, however.
She originally helped the escort
service transfer to the center be
cause she thought the two organi
zations that both with have the
similar objective of providing a
safer environment.
She said she thought they
would form "a good marriage."
"We're not asking them to leave
at all," said Howe.
"As long as the (escort) service
exists, and as long as there's

space, we'd like to have them
there."
Howe added she thought the
problems between the two organi
zations were just "operational is
sues" and some "logistical rela
tionships" concerning noise and
space still need some work.
"I have a feeling it might just be
a communication problem," Howe
said.
Nunez will meet with the SURE
Escort Service Director Felipe
Merino at the center tomorrow
night to officially discuss matters
for the first time.
Some escort drivers feel they
have been accused of taking up too
much space and creating too much
of a male influence.
"The murmurs of discontent is
kind of an unfriendly gesture," es
pecially since many women use the
escort service after their late night
meetings, said junior Sarah
Schoenfelder, one of the few fe
male escort drivers.
Schoenfelder added that the
majority of the drivers and the
center's members have "a good re
lationship."
"It's not our regular customers
that are annoyed, but a few people
that are irritated by the noise," she
said.
The escort service uses radio
transceivers as well as additional
telephones from the center for
communicating with its drivers
and customers.
Schoenfelder said if they are
moved out of the center, it will de
feat the purpose of an escort ser
vice.
"Our current location in the
Women's Center helps solidify our
aim of serving everyone, especially
women," Schoenfelder said. "We
are there for them."
