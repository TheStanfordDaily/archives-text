SARDIS, Ark. (AP) — The house that Dennis
and Christy Bailey built six months ago is scat
tered across the countryside — all except for the
closet that protected the family from a tornado
that killed 10 of their neighbors.
"I'm sorry your place was destroyed. I'm just
grateful God spared you and your children," Gov.
Mike Huckabee said yesterday to a tearful Mrs.
Bailey, who huddled in the closet with her hus
band and three children while the winds raged at
an estimated 256 mph.
The closet stands like a tattered lean-to amid
the debris of what until Saturday was the Bailey
home. The family — with two boys and a girl ages
8 to 2 — must once again find a new home.
"Every day it seems worse," Mrs. Bailey said.
At least 25 people were killed in Saturday's
storms, which raked Arkansas from its southwest
ern corner to the Missouri Bootheel in the north
east. An elderly man still was missing yesterday
near Arkadelphia.
The governor said that in a five-hour period
Saturday, the state had 14 tornadoes — more than
in all of last year. The 25 deaths were the worst
single-day death toll in Arkansas since May 15,
1968, when tornadoes killed 45 people.
"The reality of the loss is overwhelming," Huck
abee said after visiting the Baileys near their lit
tered lot. "Even through that, you can still hear
them say, 'I'm glad to be alive.' "
Nearby states were also victimized by the same
weekend storm system. Flooding killed at least
three people in Tennessee, four in Ohio and nine
in Kentucky, where one person was still missing
yesterday. Tornadoes killed one person each in
Mississippi and Tennessee, and high winds caused
two deaths in Texas.
In Little Rock, Lee Rhodes had a choice of shel
ters: his unanchored trailer home or a nearby cin
der-block grocery store. He chose the store, then
was crushed when a dairy case fell on him. His
trailer was untouched.
"The store blew completely away," said Gordon
"Pete" Caple, Rhodes' boss at Caple's Garage

"The funny thing — he would have been safer in
the trailer. The storm didn't even touch it."
The head of the Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency, James Lee Witt, toured the hardest
hit areas of Arkansas yesterday in advance of a
trip today by President Clinton.
Clinton authorized federal emergency aid for
storm victims in a 260-mile cross-state path cov
ered by the storm.
Tornadoes killed a total of 26 people in
Arkansas during Clinton's 12 years as governor.
Witt, himself a former Arkansan, looked over a
pile of cars, clothes, furniture and home siding
that once was a trailer park. Traveling with Witt
was Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who said, "It's a
scene of total and utter destruction. It's very simi
lar to scenes reminiscent of World War II."
Witt, Bumpers and other state and local offi
cials walked through downtown Arkadelphia,
pausing to look at asphalt roofing and wooden
chunks flung like spears into the side of the
Arkansas Employment Security Department
office.
At the Shaw's Garden Restaurant — now just
six brick pillars and part of a back wall — Judy
Sligh told the group how National Guardsmen
pulled her from underneath a counter.
"I don't feel like I've lost anything except things
that can be replaced because my life was at stake,"
she said.
In Sardis, Charles Dunn wept for his parents,
who died as the storm ripped apart their home on
its march southwest of Little Rock.
"I don't understand it,"he said. "It would be
different if someone had done something to them,
then I could go and settle the score. But there's
not a damn thing you can do. I don't know why it
took them away."
The same winds that left Dunn's parents dead
in their back yard lifted his 2-year-old nephew,
Kyle Glasco, out of the home. He was found in
trees more than 1,000 feet away, uninjured, miss
ing only one shoe.
Dunn found the missine shoe Sundav.

An aerial view of downtown Arkadelphia yesterday shows the business district in ruin after a tornado
slammed into the small town Saturday. Authorities have said that 14 different tornados touched down
in Arkansas Saturday killing 25 people and injuring more than 400. President Clinton is expected to tour
the damage today.
