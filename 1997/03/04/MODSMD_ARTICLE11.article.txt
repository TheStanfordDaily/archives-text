# High-ranking CIA officer pleads guilty to espionage
## Despite plea bargain, agent might still face penalities up to life in prison and $250,000 fine

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - Harold J.
Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA offi
cer ever convicted of espionage, got a shot
atA avoiding life in prison by admitting
guilt yesterday and promising to tell the
government exactly what top secrets he
sold the Russians for $180,000.
"I plead guilty, your honor," the beard
ed, 46-year-old former CIA station chief
softly told U.S. District Judge James
Cacheris during a 14-minute court hear
ing. He spoke only to answer Cacheris'
questions, mostly with a "yes" or "no."
Nicholson could receive a sentence of
life in prison and a $250,000 fine. He
agreed to forfeit his spy gains and any

future profit from sale of his story for
books or movies.
But his agreement to provide "a full
and candid debriefing" for the CIA could
win him a shorter sentence than life —
perhaps close to 20 years in prison with
time off for good behavior. Cacheris will
impose a sentence June 5.
The deal saves the government the
cost of a trial. The government also
learns what secrets he actually turned
over and avoids disclosing to the world
at a trial the secrets and top secrets he
was carrying when he was arrested at
Dulles International Airport last Nov.
16 en route to a meeting with Russian

agents in Switzerland.
Nicholson admitted to a single charge
that he conspired since June 1994 to com
mit espionage by selling Moscow national
defense documents, including some classi
fied "top secret." Two other counts — of
espionage and attempted espionage —
were dropped, but the actions alleged in
those counts also were contained in the
conspiracy count to which he admitted.
After Nicholson's hearing, U.S. Attor
ney Helen Fahey told reporters, "If he
cooperates fully, that will have an impact
on the sentence requested by the govern
ment."
In the plea bargain, the government

agreed to recommend a sentence of 23
years and 8 months if he cooperates com
pletely.
Nicholson's attorneys will recommend
21 years and 10 months, the low end of
federal sentencing guidelines for his
crime. Nicholson can appeal his punish
ment only if the sentence is longer than
27 years and 3 months, the high end of
the guideline.
If he does not cooperate, the guidelines
call for a sentence of 27 years to 33 years
and 9 months, but the judge can impose
more or less time than the guidelines call
for.
Parole has been eliminated, but if

Nicholson behaves in prison, any sen
tence would be reduced by 15 percent —
to almost exactly 20 years under the most
lenient possible government recommen
dation.
FBI agents observed Nicholson in Sin
gapore last June 27 put a briefcase in the
back of a car with Russian diplomatic
plates. He admitted yesterday the brief
case contained secret documents but the
government does not know which ones.
Prosecutors say Nicholson is suspected
of giving the Russians the identities of
CIA recruits he trained from 1994 to
1996. CIA officials said that could restrict
their future assignments.
