# Gore faces ethical questions
## Vice president denies breaking the law in soliciting money 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President A 1 Gore,
under fire for his aggressive role in campaign fund
raising, acknowledged yesterday he solicited dona
tions from his White House office but insisted he did
not do "anything wrong, much less illegal." Yet he
said he would never do it again.
"Everything I did, I understood to be lawful,"
Gore said, adding that he made only a few calls in
search of contributions from his office, around the
corner from the Oval Office. It is illegal for federal
employees to solicit money in federal buildings, but
Gore said he was not subject to that restriction.
He defended his actions in a high-stakes White
House news conference, markedly different from his
occasional appearances on behalf of administration
initiatives. This time, Gore was trying to protect his
political honor as looks ahead to the presidential
race in 2000.
Standing ramrod straight, he remained cool
under sometimes-argumentative questioning.
His explanation came even as the White House
released a 1995 memo from then-presidential coun
sel Abner Mikva instructing employees to avoid
doing the very thing that Gore did. "No fund-raising
phone calls or mail may emanate from the White
House or any other federal building," Mikva wrote.
Offering a lawyerly defense of his action, the vice
president said several times, using almost exactly
the same words:
"My counsel advises me that there is no control
ling legal authority or case that says that there was
any violation of law whatsoever in the manner in
which I asked people to contribute to our re-election
campaign."
He added, "I am proud of what I did. I do not feel

like I did anything wrong, much less illegal. I am
proud to have done everything I possibly could to
help support the re-election of the president."
Gore's deep involvement in raising money was
the latest twist in the controversy about the fund
raising tactics of the Democratic National Commit
tee and of Clinton, who approved White House cof
fees and sleepovers for big-money donors.
"On a few occasions," Gore said, "I made some
telephone calls from my office in the White House
using a DNC credit card" — a reference to the
Democratic National Committee. He said that as
vice president, he was exempt from laws that gener
ally prohibit people from fund raising in public
buildings.
"If I had realized in advance that this would cause
such concern then I wouldn't have done it in the
first place," he said.
He brushed off questions about whether the con
troversy had hurt his chances for running in 2000.
"I've told you before I'm not focused on any political
campaign in the future."
Gore said Clinton never asked him to make tele
phone calls but was aware he was helping to raise
campaign money. He insisted that only a small part
of the money he raised came from White House tele
phone calls. Most came from traditional fund-raising
events, he said.
Gore said the vice president and president are not
subject to the Hatch Act, which generally forbids
politicking by on-duty federal employees. A separate
law forbids fund raising on government property,
but Gore said the statute was designed to prevent
people from pressuring federal employees for money
— something Gore said he never did.
