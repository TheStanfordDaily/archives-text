Mayor discovers homeless man was his cousin
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Mayor Bill Veroneau was saddened by
the story of a homeless man found dead in a snowbank. But he was
shocked to learn the man was his cousin, who had been living under
a bridge less than a mile from City Hall.
David Martel, 52, was in his dirt-floored, concrete cubbyhole under
the Water Street bridge when he had a heart attack Feb. 13. He man
aged to crawl up a hill before he collapsed and died.
"I just think it's a tragedy," the 66-year-old mayor said. "I guess
that's the luck of the draw. Those kind of stories are everywhere."
Though the men were a study in contrasts — one a successful busi
nessman and politician, the other living on the streets and dying pen
niless — Veroneau and Martel led similar, promising lives as kids.
They grew up in the same house, went to the same school, served

in the military and attended college.
But Martel's life apparently started falling apart in the late
1980s, after his mother died, Veroneau said. Martel's father died in
the 19405.
At the time of his death, Martel had been homeless for nine years.
He and Veroneau were never particularly close, partly because of the
14-year age gap. Veroneau said he last spoke to Martel a decade ago.
Ten days after Martel's death, the Concord Monitor told his story
on the front page. That was the first that Veroneau knew of his
cousin's fate.
"When I read the article, I said, 'Oh, brother!' " he said. "It's kind
of hard to describe."
Martel's aunt, Claire Breckell of Boscawen, said she didn't know
he was homeless until she read of his death. She doesn't know why
Martel, an only child, didn't call family when he lost a place to live.

Clinton criticizes Israel
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton chided Israel yesterday
for deciding to put up a new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem. Such
a plan "builds mistrust" with the Palestinians, he said, as an emo
tional Yasser Arafat vented his objections at the White House.
"The important thing is on both sides to be building confidence
and working together," Clinton said at a picture-taking session with
Arafat in the Oval Office. "And so I would have preferred the decision
not have been made because I don't think it builds confidence. It
builds mistrust."
The president did not deal directly with the merits of Israel's claim to
the city and its outskirts as the eternal capital of the Jewish people. But
his stance conflicted with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
view that Israel can take unilateral actions affecting the city's character
