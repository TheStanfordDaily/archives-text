Alumni involvement in
admissions process can
sway potential students

JUST AS THE members of
Class of 1997 thought they
were about to escape to the
real world, the University
attempted last week to pull them
gently back in — as recruiters of
prospective freshman. The
Admissions Alumni Involvement
Program, in its second year, will
begin to use graduating seniors
as ambassadors to high school
students and parents in their
regional areas. It is a welcome
addition to the recruitment pro
cess — one that should have been
instituted long ago.
There is no better recruitment
tool than one-on-one interaction.
How else can prospective stu
dents get an accurate idea of the
school short of an actual visit to
Stanford? Travel to the Bay Area
is not a viable option for many
high school students or their par
ents, and thus having access to a
recent graduate of the University
— someone who has experienced
the ups and downs of Stanford
undergraduate life — will be
invaluable. Consider it a mobile,
toned-down, pre-application
Admit Weekend-type experience.
Instead of relying on the pic
tures in Stanford's application
booklet or a long-distance phone
call to an admissions director
more than twice a high school
senior's age, prospective appli
cants will have the opportunity
to meet with recent alumni who
can answer questions more effec
tively than could either the book
let or even their high school
counselors.
Alumni may have been infor
mally involved in the recruit
ment process before now, but
there has not been a formal net
work in place with the Office of

Undergraduate Admissions.
Admissions staffers do travel all
over the nation to attend college
fairs, but only end up at the
major ones. Hopefully, through
this new system, a representa
tive of Stanford will be able to
appear at nearly every college
fair and meet with every poten
tial applicant.
More important, this recruit
ment effort will increase poten
tial applicants' awareness of
Stanford as a viable option for
college. Often, prospective stu
dents from outside California —
especially those from the East
Coast — simply don't consider
Stanford when applying to col
lege. It's not that they think little
of Stanford but rather that the
University doesn't have a pres
ence in the forums where various
colleges present themselves and
recruit students. Increased alum
ni participation can help ensure
that Stanford remains on radar
screens of those planning their
college educations.
This new effort is also a posi
tive sign about a University that,
in recent years, has been compul
sively controlling all public rela
tions from the top down. By
allowing the 425 alumni who've
signed up for this program to
speak their own minds, the Uni
versity's higher-ups are sending
a refreshing signal that they in
no way fear honest and free dis
cussion of Stanford.
This initiative is a winning
proposal not just for the Admis
sions Office but for the Universi
ty as a whole, for it will
inevitably foster better and clos
er relations between alumni and
the Farm. University President
Gerhard Casper has repeatedly
cited the lackluster alumni giv
ing rate as a central problem for
Stanford, and this new initiative,
while not soliciting money from
alumni, nevertheless provides
them with a continuing connec
tion to the University. And that
can only help boost donations.
