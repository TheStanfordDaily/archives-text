## Tripping on an empty tank

PICTURE YOURSELF AT
Chuck's Donuts at 4 a.m. on a
Sunday morning. You and your
friends have been dancing all night, and
a bear claw is the final step on your way
to a well-deserved night of sleep. Yet as
everyone greedily munches around you,
you resist and choose to forsake the sim
ple sweetness that Chuck can provide.
That was my friend Jody last week. She
has given up desserts for Lent.
Many of the world's religions have
days, weeks or months that mandate fast
ing or self-sacrifice. Muslims have
Ramadan, Jews have Yom Kippur, and
the Baha'f have Aid, to name a few. For
some people, these times are an opportu
nity to give thanks for the necessities of
life; for others, their sacrifice is about
repentance. For many, the clarity of mind
created by food deprivation helps them
understand their own personal truth.
I've never made a 40-day commit
ment to any kind of food-related sacri
fice. I discovered my limits after follow
ing a misguided whim and fasting for 72
hours in the Alaskan tundra.
Ostensibly, I was taking part in
wilderness training. The premise was
that if a bear ate my food and my bags
of bulgar and lentils were lost, I would
have to know how long I could survive.
To be honest, though, I've never been
good with hypotheticals. I was seeking a
more direct goal â€” to see if I could nat
urally induce hallucinations.

Now you may think that starvation is
a high price to pay for the equivalent of
a $5 acid trip, and you're right. But I
had other reasons. I wanted to test the
limits of my strength. I wanted to see
how dependent I really was on the 30
pounds of food I carried in my back
pack. I knew that my megalomania
needed a good kick in the ass. These sec
ondary goals proved to be critical, for
the talking pizzas and undulating,
multi-colored Twinkies never showed
up, although I did have an erotic day
dream about a La Costena burrito.
Three days of no food and little sleep
gave me too much time to think. The
self-imposed melodrama of my sacrifice
led to some earth-shaking revelations,
most of which I forgot the next time I
tasted the sweet ambrosia of freeze
dried backpack rations.
However, a few insights remained.
On day one, hour 13 of fasting, I decid
ed that food is really great stuff and
that without it I am a sniveling lump of
nothingness. On day two, at 2 a.m., I
resolved that if a bear really ever ate my
food, I would create my own personal
aurora borealis via self-immolation
rather than try to overcome starvation.
On day three, hour 23, only two hours
away from the end, I knew in my heart
that, at that moment, if I were offered
the choice between a wet, passionate
kiss from Meg Ryan and a single Cool
Ranch Dorito, I would send Meg pack

ing. In a second. At 4 a.m. that morn
ing, food was my truth.
Suffice it to say, I can't imagine the
determination of a practicing Muslim,
forsaking food during the daylight of an
entire month. I can't fathom the com
munity that it creates among those of
common faith and the individual
strength that it requires. I imagine that
the acid trip, even with hallucinations,
is much less fulfilling. But not for me;
I'm not strong enough.
So I continue to live a life of culinary
excess, and I revel in it. I get cranky if I
haven't eaten for four hours. I have
driven 100 miles to buy a Cinnabon.
Last month, I broke my vegetarianism
to eat fish cheeks.
And at the end of my Alaskan jour
ney, after three days of inspiration
about finding joy in the tiniest morsel
and revelation in a single bite, I broke
my fast by eating six fat pancakes cov
ered with brown sugar and margarine. I
promptly vomited.
Sometimes the truth is hard to swal
low.

lic policy, recently dropped a late morn
ing class so he could eat Sandy's choco
late-chip cookies straight out of the oven
of Lambda Nu. It was a good decision.
