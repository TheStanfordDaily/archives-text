Montgomery knows how to get job done for men's hoops

IN HIS COLUMN Thursday, Todd
Bernstein asserted that Mike Mont
gomery was in many ways responsi
ble for the somewhat erratic season the
Stanford men's basketball team has
enjoyed this season. As someone who
•travels with the team to every game and
,'has seen the Cardinal play all season, I
;could not believe what I read. In that
'dubious piece of journalism, Bernstein
'displayed a remarkable lack of knowledge
of the Stanford team specifically and the
game of basketball generally and in doing
so insulted the coach who is responsible
for much of the success that Stanford
has had this year and in years past.
The specific aspects of the season that
Bernstein cites as perplexing are misin
terpreted by him in his effort to make
Montgomery look bad. He says Stanford
should be playing more zone defense
because the Cardinal has "consistently
shown an inability to stay in tight man
to-man defense with very athletic teams."
He cites the UCLA game at Pauley
Pavilion as an example. But were you
watching, Todd, when Stanford won by
48 points here vs. the Bruins on Jan. 9?
In large part that victory was due to
phenomenal shooting, but if you recall,
the score was 109-61. Stanford's defen
sive effort made UCLA's offense look

inept. Most important, though, is the
fact that Stanford is ranked No. 2 in the
Pac-10 in scoring defense, meaning
Stanford has been superb on the defen
sive end all season long.
Bernstein also says that Montgomery
has not handled personnel well. He
believes that Mark Madsen should be
receiving more playing time. My ques
tion is, has Bernstein been watching any
of the games recently? Madsen has got
ten significantly more playing time since
Tim Young's back has been hurting, and
he has been producing.
Against Washington State last Thurs
day, while Young was on the bench for
crunch time, Madsen led the team to vic
tory. Madsen's proclivity to get in foul
trouble prevents him from playing even
more, as he is averaging 3 1/2 fouls per
game in only 16 minutes of play, and he
has fouled out almost as many times this
year as the other players combined,
despite missing the first five games.
If Bernstein took a moment to think
about it, he would realize that Mont
gomery's coaching of Madsen, a player
who prior to this fall's practice had
played basketball a total of seven times
in two years because of his mission work
and was then injured for seven weeks to
start the year, has been phenomenal.

Madsen has become a lock for the All-
Freshman Team in the league.
Bernstein's biggest blunder is assum
ing that this Stanford team has top 10
potential. The Cardinal is good, and I am
its biggest fan. But this is not one of the
30 most talented teams in the country.
Aside from Brevin Knight, the players
are extremely young and unseasoned,
and while all of Stanford's young players
will eventually be outstanding, none of
them came to Stanford with enough nat
ural ability to immediately make an
impact in our conference.
Stanford should be upset about two
losses this year — the game in Arizona,
where they had the game in hand and
gave it away, and the game at Oregon
State. Losses to UC-Berkeley, USC,
Charleston, and the University of Wash
ington were all games in which Stanford
lost to a talented team on the road.
Where is the shame in that? Does Bern
stein expect that Stanford go undefeat
ed? Also, how can he compare Bob Hug
gins to Mike Montgomery? Sure, Hug
gins can yank his star out of the starting
line-up for one game; he has six high
school Ail-Americans on his roster to
replace him with. How many Stanford
players came here regarded as one of the
50 best high school players in the coun

try? None. That is the disadvantage
Montgomery faces every year as he tries
to assemble his team.
This year is no exception. Bernstein
says that "great coaches know their per
sonnel." Who knows his personnel better
than Montgomery? He has taken a group
of young, inexperienced players and put
them into a position where it now
appears that Stanford, with a good fin
ish, will finish second in the Pac-10. How
can that be a failure? And watch out
when Stanford goes to the NCAA tourna
ment. With Montgomery's preparation
and coaching, Stanford will win a couple
of games against some teams that won't
know much about kids named Kris
Weems, Arthur Lee or Mark Madsen.
Before Montgomery came to Stanford,
the Card hadn't been to the post-season
in 44 years. Tom Davis, the highly suc
cessful coach at lowa, who preceded
Montgomery, swore that you could never
build a winning program at Stanford.
During his tenure here, Montgomery has
done just that. The Cardinal is on the
verge of a 20-win season and a tie for its
highest finish ever in this conference. In
my book, that is a job well done.
