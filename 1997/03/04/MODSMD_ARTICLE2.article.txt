# Students ask for quicker action
## 150 students, administrators show up for 'Cookies and Tea' 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
An open forum run by students
yesterday put a new twist on Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's "Tea and Cookies"
events.
Ten people, with an audience of
about 150, spoke their minds on
an exhaustive list of student con
cerns at "Cookies and Tea."
While the name comes from
Casper's "Tea and Cookies," se
nior Leslie Anne Hummel, the
event's coordinator, was quick to
point out the differences between
the two programs.
"I think there's a tremendous
difference in tone and format be
tween 'Cookies and Tea' and 'Tea
and Cookies,' " Hummel said.
" 'Cookies and Tea' is student-ini
tiated, student-led and it's a
chance for the student voice to be
heard. 'Tea and Cookies' is ad
ministration-initiated, adminis
tration-led and a chance for the
administrative voice to be heard."
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ram6n Saldivar and Dean
of Students Marc Wais were in at
tendance, along with representa
tives from about 15 other admin
istrative offices.
The first student, Michael Put
nam, spoke on the importance of
interdisciplinary programs.
"We recommend the Universi
ty form a commission ... empow
ered to make recommendations
for improvement [in interdiscipli
nary programs] and initiating reg
ular reviews," said Putnam, a se
nior majoring in science, technol

ogy and society and director of
special projects for the ASSU
President's Office.
Saldfvar later addressed some
of Putnam's concerns. He said
faculty participation and funding
are vital for the survival of inter
disciplinary programs. The cre
ation of the Program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnici
ty, he said, reinforces the strength
of these efforts.
"I think it's something we can
point to with great pride," Saldi
var said. w We are getting phone
calls from around the country. I
think we've taken a very impor
tant step in the creation of
CSRE."
Sophomore Cathy Rion, an ac
tive volunteer at the Women's
Center, brought up concerns that
the 26 recommendations made in
the 1992 Women's Needs Assess
ment Report and in the 1993 Re
port on Women Faculty have got
ten "dusty." She suggested that
the University take a new look at
the recommendations.
Aly Remtulla, a senior in an
thropology, made an appeal on be
half of Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta, who recently was de
nied tenure.
Senior Lubia Sanchez spoke on
behalf of the Stanford Center for
Chicano Research, which has no
permanent director but is seeking
one.
Junior Kelly Naylor said the
importance of creating a public
service minor, which, in the pro
posal presented at a student
forum in January, will consist of
six classes, three of which would

be part of a public service core. Nay
lor said students have been inter
viewing faculty and staff and are
currently drafting a comprehensive
proposal.
Junior Lisa Rubin, president of
the Intersorority Council, ad
dressed the lack of sorority housing.
"All Greek organizations should
be housed," Rubin said. "I think
Greek organizations represent a le
gitimate choice and should be
housed," Rubin said.
She said most Greek organiza
tions on campus do a great deal of
philanthropic work, "all of which
could be enhanced by being
housed," she said.
Junior Andre Braxton raised
complaints concerning his financial
aid package. As an ethnic theme as
sociate in Ujamaa, he is supposed to
be paid $675 at the beginning of
every quarter, but when he received
his financial aid package, he found
that the University simply deducted
that amount from his total package.

"It just doesn't make sense. My
advice — don't give us a salary. Just
give us free room and board. Those
of us that are poor are just getting
poorer," Braxton said.
Director of Student Awards Cyn
thia Rife later clarified the position
the Office of Financial Aids takes
with such cases and encouraged
students with such problems to con
sult the office.
"We can deal with things very
flexibly, but you have to come to
us," she said.
Jessica Lehman, a sophomore
active in Disabled Students of Stan
ford, discussed the importance of
having all buildings accessible to
students with disabilities.
"We need Stanford University to
demonstrate disability access as a
priority," Lehman said. She added
that she has seen students bring is
sues to the attention of the adminis
tration in the past and accomplish a
lot. She specifically pointed to the
last year's fight to get funding for
the Women's Center and the strug
gle to save STS.
"If it's a priority, things get done.
Now is the time to show that same
kind of support," Lehman said.
