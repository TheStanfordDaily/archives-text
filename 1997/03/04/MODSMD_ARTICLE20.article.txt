I Much as lam flattered to have been
designated as "the founder of the Insti
tute for Research on Women and Gen
der" in Thursday's Daily, I have no
.claim whatsoever to that distinction.
Then-undergraduates Cindy Davis and
Beth Garfield and then-graduate student
Susan Heck deserve that recognition,
along with Education Prof. Myra
Strober, who served as the institute's
first director. I will, however, claim to

have been a whole-hearted supporter
from the beginning along with my hus
band, who as the University's president
supported budget-based dollars as
investment in this initiative.
