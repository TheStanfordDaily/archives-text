# Greek life for blacks abounds on campus
## 
### 
Wednesday's Daily article on black
Greek organizations was much appreci
ated by those of us in the Greek com-

munity and also timely, coming at the
close of Black Liberation Month.
However, there was a rather gross
mistake in her article. There are not
four but six black Greek organizations
with a history of membership and ser
vice on Stanford's campus. The Sigma
Gamma Rho sorority and Omega Psi
Phi fraternity are the newest of Stan
ford's black Greeks. As members of
Sigma Gamma Rho, we were quite dis
turbed by this omission.
Sigma Gamma Rho is an organiza
tion with a focus on community service
and sisterhood among black women on
college campuses across the nation.

The sorority was founded in 1922 at
Butler University in Indiana and has
since spread to almost every major col
lege and university campus in the Unit
ed States.
The Xi Delta chapter of Sigma
Gamma Rho was established at Stan
ford in 1994 and has continued this
rich tradition of service to the black
community.
