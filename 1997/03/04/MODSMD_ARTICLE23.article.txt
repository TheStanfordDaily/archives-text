# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Pushing the envelope in the direction of liberalism 
### 
I'VE OBVIOUSLY GOTTEN myself
onto some sort of leftie mailing list. (I
think it's the Mother Jones subscrip
tion that did it.) I first realized this in
late October, when I received a desperate
plea from House minority whip David
Bonior asking me to send him money so
he could be re-elected and continue fight
ing off Gingrich's right-wing onslaught.
I threw that letter out along with the
invitations to invest with Thompsonian
socially responsible mutual funds, to give
money to assorted environmental organi
zations and to join the Coalition to Free
Tibet. I've always wanted to join the
ACLU so that I could proudly call myself
a card-carrying member, but alas they've
yet to send an invitation. Early last week,
though, I got an intriguing one.
As I was tossing out credit card offers
and insidious College Pro Painters sum
mer job applications, I saw a request to join
the National Organization for Women.
Growing up with a name like Jesse,
one becomes accustomed to receiving
form letters addressed to "Ms. Oxfeld"
and other such gender confusion. At first
glance, I thought that NOW had simply
screwed up and sent me an invite because

it though I was a woman.
When I thought about it a bit more,
though, I decided that the NOW mailer
must have originated with the same list
that gets me other left-leaning letters and
pamphlets. But unlike other propaganda,
this one I didn't throw out so quickly.
I'd been explaining to a female friend
not too long beforehand how I, a man, am
a feminist. I'm a feminist in the sense that
there seems to me no reason for women to
be treated any differently than men by the
law or by private companies' policies. I'm a
feminist in the sense that I believe women
deserve the same opportunities as men and
deserve the same pay for the same work. I
guess you could say I'm a feminist because
I support the right to choose.
NOW's self-description in the Encyclo
pedia of Associations says that the group
is made up of "men and women who sup
port full equality for women in truly equal
partnership with men." I support that.
The next sentence: "Seeks to end prej
udice and discrimination against women
in government, industry, the professions,
churches, political parties, the judiciary,
labor unions, education, science,
medicine, law, religion and every other

field of importance in American society."
Sounds good to me, too.
It's an organization whose goals I agree
with, and becoming a member could lend
some gravitas to my claims of feminism. I
couldn't think of any good reasons not to
join but for the fact I'm a man. And I didn't
really see why that should stop me.
The specific campaign behind NOW's
solicitation, however, I found a bit more
troubling.
You see, NOW is seeking new donations
to help fund its "Flush Rush" effort. Its
goal is to show Americans that Rush Lim
baugh is a dangerous, bigoted demagogue.
I agree wholeheartedly that Limbaugh
is a dangerous, bigoted demagogue. But as
a journalist who depends upon the Consti
tution's guarantees of free speech regard
less of how undesirable some might find it,
I feel a little uncomfortable supporting an
effort to "flush" someone else's ideas.
I guess that's one of the problems inher
ent in being a civil-liberties-valuing liberal.
Those on the right can easily and comfort
ably call for the suppression of their oppo
nents' viewpoints. If their exhortations are
successful, they've benefited their cause,
and even if they fail they certainly haven't

hurt themselves or their views by trying.
But how can someone on the left preach
his own tolerance and acceptance while
simultaneously rejecting his adversary's
right to an opposing opinion? To do so
would negate his own argument.
It's kind of like the philosophical prob
lem with Bob Dole's attempt at a GOP
platform compromise on abortion. His
solution was to insert language saying
that one could be pro-choice and still be a
good Republican. But if the GOP says it's
OK to choose either a pro-abortion or
anti-abortion stance, the party is essen
tially taking a pro-choice stance. If liber
als say that repressive viewpoints should
be silenced, they are essentially taking a
repressive viewpoint.
But NOW's leaders ain't dumb. They
know that their constituency is one that
also values free speech, and they carefully
phrased their anti-Limbaugh plans.
They're not calling for stations to stop
carrying Rush's programs, and they're
not calling for the FCC to censor his
broadcasts. What they are demanding is
equal access to the public airwaves. And
that's something tough to argue with.
NOW points out that while Rush can

spout his hate-filled rhetoric on radio sta
tions across the nation for free, many of
the same stations would not accept
NOW's paid advertisements because they
were deemed "too controversial."
A private company is well within its
rights to choose not to do business with
NOW. But if you accept — as U.S. law
does — that the radio and television air
waves are owned by the public and only
leased to various broadcasters, then it's a
good question why Rush's right-wing
views can travel those public airwaves
but NOW's leftist views cannot.
By joining NOW and signing on to the
"Flush Rush" campaign, I'd be support
ing the group's efforts not to silence Lim
baugh's speech but to ensure that NOW
has the same opportunities for speech.
That's something I can support.
