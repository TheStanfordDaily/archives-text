# New group advances disability awareness

Non-disabled students can experience an ordi
naryday in the life of a disabled student as part of a
school-wide Disability Action Day tomorrow.
The Disability Awareness and Reform Team,
formed this quarter by about 10 non-disabled stu
dents concerned about the inaccessibility of many
campus areas, is organizing the event in White Plaza
from noon to 1:30 p.m.
Because most students are not blind, deaf or oth
erwise disabled and do not foresee having to deal with
such inconveniences, they tend to fail to recognize the
challenges the more than 180 disabled students at
Stanford face, group members said.
"Disability is not a very publicized aspect of cam
pus life, and I'm glad students will have the chance to
think and learn more about it," said Bliss Temple, a
coterminal student in earth systems, who will be the
main speaker.
Disabled students will conduct campus tours, es
corting non-disabled students to hard to reach places.
Medical student Nathan Watson, one of the stu
dent organizers, said a disability simulation exercise
offers non-disabled students the opportunity to com
plete a task often more complicated for students with
disabilities.
Watson said a sample assignment might be: "You
are deaf. For the next hour, count the number of fire
alarms that can flash that you see."
This may seem like a simple task, but students will
soon realize that this may be the only way a deaf per
son would realize that there is a fire, Watson said.
Watson also said a petition will be circulated. The pe
tition will request disabled access to all community cen
ters, elevator access in all dorms, more library space be-

tween stacks, more Braille signs, blind-accessible com
puters in every residential computer cluster, hearing
aid-compatible microphone systems in lecture halls
and course syllabi availability to disabled students
three weeks prior to the normal registration deadline.
The group hopes that through Disability Action
Day, more students will become aware of the issues
that disabled students have to face, especially pccess,
or lack of access, to many buildings.
Watson is also a Disabled Civil Liberties Union
member, a disability staff forum liaison and a mem
ber of the Americans with Disabilities Act task force.
"I hope that the raised awareness translates into
some action on the part of the student body," said
Ryan Page, the organization's treasurer. This in
cludes signing the petition but could also be as simple
as not blocking access to a ramp with bicycles, he said.
Page said, "The administration will be more re
ceptive to implement the necessary changes if more
students become involved or voice their support."
Watson said while the forum and the Disability
Resource Center already have lobbied for these
changes in past years, reform has been slow because
disabled students are a minority of students at Stan
ford.
Disability Action Day will give the student body
the opportunity to voice their support for the changes
that need to be made to make the campus more ac
cessible to the disabled, members of the new group
said.
Its membership is open to the entire Stanford
community.
"Becoming part of the group has opened my eyes
to the problems that exist for disabled students, and
I am glad to be able to try to do something about rem
edying them," Page said.
