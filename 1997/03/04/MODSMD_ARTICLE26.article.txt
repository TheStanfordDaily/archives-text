## Bulldogs nip men but women win in track and6 field's home opener 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
Less than a week before the start of indoor
nationals, the Stanford track and field team
kicked off the outdoor season with its first home
meet of the year.
Saturday's meet pitted the Cardinal against
some familiar competition: Fresno State, Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and Sacramento State.
Because of the impending national meet, how
ever, the team wasn't able to showcase a full
squad. Nevertheless, the Stanford women man
aged to capture first place, with 245 points to
Fresno State's 208, and the men came in a close
second to Fresno State, losing 198-197.
Among the many outstanding performers on
the women's side were the 400-meter and
1,600-meter relay teams, who both captured
first place with times of 46.82 seconds and
3:45.05 respectively.
"It was a good opener and we have more to
work on, but still it was a nice way to start the
outdoor season," said junior Heather Miller, a
member of both teams. Miller, who won all
three of her events, also took first place in the

200 with a time of 25.15.
The 800-, 3,000- and 100-meter hurdles were
also controlled by the Cardinal women. In a
close race, sophomores Cynthia Morman and
LaShawndra Pace placed 1-2 at 2:13.14 and
2:13.33 respectively, beating out Nikki Shaw of
Cal Poly who came in third at 2:13.52. Likewise,
in the 3,000, senior Amanda White and fresh
man Shaluinn Fullove continued the 1-2 punch
with times of 10:00.86 and 10:02.76. Then in
the 100-meter hurdles, junior Bernadette
Armand and sophomore Tracye Lawyer repeat
ed the feat by coming in first and second at
14.01 and 14.26.
"I had an overall good performance,"
Armand said. "I felt really good all the way, and
my opener felt pretty strong."
Junior Sarah Moore continued the women's
domination of the track events by taking first
place in the 1,500 with a time of 4:30.35.
In the field events, freshman Cassie Romuld
took the discus title with a throw of 151 feet and
also came in second place in the shot put with a
throw of 45-9. Junior Katrinka Jackson took
first place in the shot put with a throw of 47-4
3/4. Lawyer won the high jump at 5-7, and

senior Tyra Holt continued her success at the
pole vault with a leap of 11-6.
While the women easily beat Fresno State,
the men's meet was very closely contested with
the final outcome coming down to the last
event.
In the 800, senior J.J. White and sophomore
Jacob Maas placed first and second with times
of 1:52.51 and 1:53.04. Ironically, White, a dis
tance runner and a member of the NCAA cham
pion cross country team was running the 800
for only the second time in his collegiate career.
"It went fine and was great to be able to step
out of my usual role," said White, who ran to
stay in tune for nationals. "I knew that my
training wasn't geared for that so there was no
pressure," he said. "It was kind of funny
because the distance guys were giving me a hard
time about running it."
Continuing Stanford's traditional domi
nance in distance events, senior Rob Reeder and
sophomore Brent Hauser then captured the
1,500 and 5,000 meters with times of 3:53.65
and 14:21.23 respectively.
In other track events, freshman Mike Harte

won the 110-meter hurdles in
14.61 at his first meet of the sea
son.
"It felt good to begin my college
career with a win even though the
time was not so hot," Harte said.
"I'm adjusting really well to the
higher hurdle, and pretty soon that
won't even be an issue for me any
more."
In the field events, senior Justin
Strand took first place in the ham
mer throw at 201-7, sophomore
Jauron Pigg won the triple jump
with a leap of 45-5 and freshman
Toby Stevenson continued his
impressive performance in the pole

vault by winning with a leap of 17-
6 1/2.
"It was pretty slow today; the
wind was bad and my warmup
didn't go too well, but it was a good
start for the weekend," Stevenson
said. Despite being disappointed by
his performance, Stevenson was
optimistic about the upcoming
NCAA Championships. "I'm get
ting a few new poles, and if I can
jump 18 at nationals, I think I have
a great chance of winning," he said.
Some said the team's strong
performance in all events is work
ing to change others' perception of
Stanford.
"We have a very good team, and
we're out to dispel the rumor that
we're only a distance and middle
distance team," said coach Vin
Lananna.
