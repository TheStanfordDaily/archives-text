# Third time not a charm for Goldstein
## Junior teams with Wolters and loses in Pac Coast Doubles final 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis players got to do
something out of the ordinary for
the squad last weekend in La
Jolla, Calif., at the 108 th annual
Pacific Doubles Championships.
They played doubles, only dou
bles and more doubles: 18 match
es, 41 sets and 356 games of dou
bles.
At a tournament composed of
juniors, professionals and locals
as well as collegiate players, Stan
ford was no newcomer to La Jolla.
Not only has the Card captured
the title six of the last seven years,
but in the past two years the final
has featured junior Paul Gold
stein, who won the title in 1995
with Scott Humphries and in
1996 with Jeff Salzenstein.
The finals match Sunday came
around and so did Goldstein, this
year teaming up with fellow All-
American Ryan Wolters, a sopho
more. However, there was no
three-peat for the junior as he and
Wolters fell in the final to a strong
team of George Bastl and Kyle
Spencer from USC in four sets, 6-
2, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6.
"It would have been nice for
Paul to win the tournament three
years in a row with three different
partners," said head coach Dick
Gould. "It is always nice to win,
but we got a lot of good doubles
playing in and that is what we
needed."
Although the Trojans have a
strong team in Bastl and Spencer,
it also was not Wolters' and Gold
stein's best day. They got off to a
slow start, taking only four games
in the first two sets and serving
poorly.
"We were not serving well in
the beginning of that match,"
Gould said. "You just can't beat
players at that level if you are not
serving well. But the guys fought
back and almost turned the
match around."
Although the Cardinal did not
come away with another La Jolla
title, they came home with a great
deal of good doubles experience.
Leading the Card in matches
played was the senior-freshman
duo of Grant Elliott and Geoff
Abrams, who lost in the first
round of play to Rogelio Hernan
dez and Mark Segesta of San

Diego 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-3 but then
fought back to take the consola
tion title, winning their next five
matches in straight sets. Elliott
and Abrams took out Tom Smith
and Robert Wilkins of Irving,
Calif., 6-3, 7-6 in the final.
"Geoff and Grant lost a tough
first-round match but came back
and won against a bona fide
team," Gould said.
In other play for the Card,

freshman twins Bob and Mike
Bryan cruised to the semifinals of
the tournament easily, defeating
all their opponents in straight
sets before falling to Bastl and
Spencer 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford juniors Charles
Hoeveler and Misha Palecek, who
played together in La Jolla last
year, cruised to the third round
before they too were stopped by
Bastl and Spencer 6-2, 6-0. Bastl

and Spencer appeared to be one of
the only teams which could stop
the Card in Jolla; three of
Stanford's four doubles teams
lost their only match to the two
Trojans.
Stanford returns to dual
match play today when the Card,
currently 9-1, takes on Pacific 10
Conference opponent Oregon at
1:30 p.m. at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
