# OSU, Denver fall as gymnasts prevail
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The women's gymnastics team
continues to ride on a high, defeat
ing No. 12 Oregon State and No.
19 Denver by more than three
points Friday. It was the Card's
last home event, and the Stanford
gymnasts rocked a packed Burn
ham Pavilion by not only taking
the team title but also dominating
the all-around event.
In an earlier encounter with
Oregon State, Stanford had suf
fered a close loss to the Beavers'
experienced squad and was look
ing to exact vengeance.
"It was just about the best meet
I know, the best meet all year,"
said assistant coach Wayne
Wright.
This full victory came at a cru
cial point in the season for the
Cardinal, which is building on
each meet to pull it together for
the upcoming Pacific 10 Confer

ence Championships and the
NCAA Regionals next month, said
head coach Lisa Izzi.
Freshman Larissa Fontaine,
who swept the all-around event,
scoring no lower than 9.825 on
each apparatus and tallying
39.375 total points, said the victo
ry lifted the Card's confidence
level.
"We proved our consistency
that we've been building on all
year," Fontaine said.
Izzi said that because it is
important that the team "keep the
ball rolling" for the postseason,
the most satisfying accomplish
ment in the meet came with the
gymnasts' "continual develop
ment of skills" and ability to stay
focused.
She was especially proud of her
team's performance given the for
mat of the competition. The tri
meet — a time-consuming meet in
which one team must continuous
ly be on standby while the other
two teams take turns on their
events — lasted approximately
three hours. The postseason
meets, for which multiple top
notch teams will gather, will follow
a similar format.
The Cardinal gymnasts
showed no signs of weariness in
the mistake-free meet, however.
While Fontaine was crowned
the all-around queen, sophomore
co-captain Amy Murakami and

sophomore Tracey Kohl took sec
ond and third places, marking
39.025 and 38.875 points respec
tively.
Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick
and junior co-captain Keri Mona
han followed closely behind, tying
for fourth place with 38.75 points.
"It was really exciting to see
that we can do so well individually
on every event, especially against a
team like Oregon State," Izzi said.
This meet also allowed the
newer members of the squad to
attain further competition experi
ence, and having nearly all fresh
men members compete in the Car
dinal lineup proved the squad's
depth and strength of individual

skill, Fontaine said.
"We are experimenting with
lots of different lineups, seeing
what's going to work best for us in
postseason," Fontaine said.
While freshman Annie
Thananopavarn showed strong
routines on the vault, freshman
Kim Young pleased the crowd
with an exhibition debut on the
beam. Both Thananopavarn and
Young have been recovering from
pre-college and preseason injuries.
Freshman Sarah Harding
reasserted her presence on the
floor, following last week's electri
fying debut in a meet against UC-
Santa Barbara. Harding's skilled
floor routine, including a high Ara

bian dive-roll and a double-full
tumbling pass, earned her a high
score of 9.725.
Harding's victory Friday came
after a lower-back stress fracture
forced the gymnast to refrain from
training for a frustrating four
months.
"This is what I've been looking
forward to for so long," Harding
said. "I'm just so excited that I am
competing, and I just feel really
happy and proud to finally be a
part of Stanford's team."
Harding picked up practice in
mid-January and is preparing for
competition on the beam and bars;
the full recovery of the freshman
force will further boost the Cardi

nal team level, Izzi said.
Oregon State sophomore Danae
Phillips said the Beavers are look
ing forward to a postseason
rematch with the Card after "a lot
more work." She added that she
enjoyed the spirit of the Burnham
competition and the friendliness of
the Cardinal gymnasts.
Izzi was careful to note that the
Beavers are not in their best condi
tion and will most likely improve
by the time the Card faces the
squad at Pac-lOs in three weeks.
"You can never count them
out," she said. "They have injuries,
and they are resting some of their
members." Among the recovering
gymnasts are two All-Americans
