## Men battle to fourth 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
This weekend marked an
important turning point for the
Stanford men's gymnastics team.
With a key all-arounder out of
commission and an action-filled
month up ahead, the Cardinal has
taken a daring strategy and atti
tude change that will prove neces
sary for the upcoming events.
No. 9 Stanford placed fourth in
Saturday's competition at UC-
Santa Barbara with a team total of
224.15, behind No. 2 California's
229.78, No. 6 Oklahoma State's
229.48 and No. 10 Illinois' 225.8.
However, the most important
occurrence for the road trip was
when senior co-captain Jamie Ellis
injured his shoulder during a tum
bling pass Thursday night at the
UCIA Invitational. Ellis then sat

Santa Barbara. Although Ellis
remains optimistic about his
recovery, an MRI performed last
night will prove a more telling pre

"In a way, Jamie's injury was
one of the best things to happen to
the team, even though (Satur

day's) team score and team finish
was not outstanding," said head
coach Sadao Hamada.
In response to the gap in the
lineup, the Stanford squad
stepped up to the challenge and
filled in five of the six holes left by
Ellis' absence Saturday.
Hamada was impressed with
the substitute performances.
Whoever filled in for Jamie did
a good job â€” David (Ludlow) on
rings, Craig (Nesbitt) on pommel
horse, Jeremy (Herman) on paral
lel bars," Hamada said.
Junior Gabe Edelman also
served a key role in taking over
two of Ellis' events, the floor and
vault.
Nesbitt, a freshman, essentially
made up a pommel horse routine
the day before the meet and still
managed to post a 9.0 on the appa
ratus.
"I'm just now getting the skills
back up to it,"he said. "I just
started working back toward pom
mel horse a few weeks ago."
In addition to uncharted rou
tines, many of the gymnasts
attempted more difficult skills for
