# Middle of the pack
## Men battle to fourth 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
This weekend marked an
important turning point for the
Stanford men's gymnastics team.
With a key all-arounder out of
commission and an action-filled
month up ahead, the Cardinal has
taken a daring strategy and atti
tude change that will prove neces
sary for the upcoming events.
No. 9 Stanford placed fourth in
Saturday's competition at UC-
Santa Barbara with a team total of
224.15, behind No. 2 California's
229.78, No. 6 Oklahoma State's
229.48 and No. 10 Illinois' 225.8.
However, the most important
occurrence for the road trip was
when senior co-captain Jamie Ellis
injured his shoulder during a tum
bling pass Thursday night at the
UCIA Invitational. Ellis then sat
out Saturday's competition at
Santa Barbara. Although Ellis
remains optimistic about his
recovery, an MRI performed last
night will prove a more telling pre
dictor.
"In a way, Jamie's injury was
one of the best things to happen to
the team, even though (Satur

day's) team score and team finish
was not outstanding," said head
coach Sadao Hamada.
In response to the gap in the
lineup, the Stanford squad
stepped up to the challenge and
filled in five of the six holes left by
Ellis' absence Saturday.
Hamada was impressed with
the substitute performances.
Whoever filled in for Jamie did
a good job — David (Ludlow) on
rings, Craig (Nesbitt) on pommel
horse, Jeremy (Herman) on paral
lel bars," Hamada said.
Junior Gabe Edelman also
served a key role in taking over
two of Ellis' events, the floor and
vault.
Nesbitt, a freshman, essentially
made up a pommel horse routine
the day before the meet and still
managed to post a 9.0 on the appa
ratus.
"I'm just now getting the skills
back up to it,"he said. "I just
started working back toward pom
mel horse a few weeks ago."
In addition to uncharted rou
tines, many of the gymnasts
attempted more difficult skills for
a higher starting value reflecting
Hamada's new approach caused
by Ellis' injury.
With Ellis out of commission,
the team knew that a focus on
high scoring at the competition
would prove futile.
"I changed my strategy to let
them try some new skills,
sequences and routines — most of
them succeeded. I was very
pleased," Hamada said. "I took
advantage of the situation."
In fact, the setback will aid in
the team's depth, as each gymnast
now must improve their own
skills to make up the slack.
"We proved to ourselves that
we have a lot of talent and depth,"
said senior lan Bachrach. "It
pushed everyone to do that much
better."
This weekend's meet also
served as an opportunity for the
Cardinal to gauge the other com
petition. Before the weekend's
road trip, Stanford had only faced
California and San Jose State, but
the Santa Barbara meet saw the
entrance of several East Coast
schools on an even playing ground.
"I wasn't that impressed with
Oklahoma State," Bachrach said.
"I don't see them as being a threat
this year." The Cardinal still con
siders Cal the team to beat for
NCAAs.
The Cardinal squad is unusual
in its history and approach to win
ning; although ranked ninth,
Stanford has never lost sight of
their ultimate goal — an NCAA
championship.
In past years, the road to
NCAAs has also been replete with
mild setbacks, but each year the
Card has been able to recover and
make a solid run for the title come
April.
Ellis' injury is just another of
the bumps in the road, and as
Nesbitt put it, "We have to just
push through this time, make the
best of it and it will make us
stronger in the end."
