# Senate could redistrict
## Grad senate seat shuffle on tonight's agenda

Political power games. Angry, profane e-mail mes
sages. Threats of challenging election results and
charges of constitutional ignorance.
These are the "Days of Our Senate."
The ASSU Senate is locked over the redistricting of
graduate senate seats, a necessary action due to the dis
proportional representation that has grown out of
changing enrollment in Stanford's seven graduate
schools. What began as an attempt to fix that discrep
ancy has grown into an all-senate political battle.
The fight could end in several ways at tonight's sen-

ate meeting. First, the senate will vote
on its original redistricting bill, which
would shuffle the graduate schools to
create three districts with five repre
sentatives each.

That bill would break up the current layout by mov
ing the School of Earth Sciences from the district it cur
rently shares with the School of Engineering into the
district containing the Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences and Education. The third district, consisting of
the Schools of Business, Law and Medicine, would re
main unchanged.
