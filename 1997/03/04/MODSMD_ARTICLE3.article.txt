# Senate could redistrict
## Grad senate seat shuffle on tonight's agenda

Political power games. Angry, profane e-mail mes
sages. Threats of challenging election results and
charges of constitutional ignorance.
These are the "Days of Our Senate."
The ASSU Senate is locked over the redistricting of
graduate senate seats, a necessary action due to the dis
proportional representation that has grown out of
changing enrollment in Stanford's seven graduate
schools. What began as an attempt to fix that discrep
ancy has grown into an all-senate political battle.
The fight could end in several ways at tonight's sen-

ate meeting. First, the senate will vote
on its original redistricting bill, which
would shuffle the graduate schools to
create three districts with five repre
sentatives each.

That bill would break up the current layout by mov
ing the School of Earth Sciences from the district it cur
rently shares with the School of Engineering into the
district containing the Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences and Education. The third district, consisting of
the Schools of Business, Law and Medicine, would re
main unchanged.

If that bill fails, two others will
be considered, according to several
members of the senate Steering
Committee. One would move the
schools in a different manner, leav
ing Earth Sciences with Engineer
ing and moving Education into the
Business, Law and Medicine group.
Engineering / Earth Sciences
would have six representatives,
Humanities and Sciences would
have four and the combined profes
sional schools and Education would
hold five seats.
The other bill would overhaul
the system, districting students not
by schools but by degree program.
The original bill was first pro
posed at the Feb. 11 senate meet
ing, but ASSU Senate Chair Don
Aingworth immediately sent it
back to the Administration and
Rules committee. It returned to the
senate for debate at last week's
meeting.
During that debate, Aingworth, a
graduate student in the School of

Engineering, expressed reservations
about passing the bill. He supported
an amendment by ASSU Senator
Diogo Rau which would have elimi
nated districts altogether.
That amendment failed and the
meeting ended when Aingworth
walked out, breaking quorum and
halting a vote on the bill.
The following day, ASSU Sena
tor Doug Natelson posted a com
promise plan on the ASSU mailing
list. Several responses followed, in
cluded a profane message from
ASSU Senator Mallory Roberts
that personally attacked Aing
worth.
An electronic melee ensued.
More than 40 redisricting mes
sages — many of which carried per
sonal attacks — were posted on the
news group during the next six days
along with an unspecified amount
of personal e-mails.
Natelson discussed policy issues
in his messages but nonetheless
grew tired of the debate. "For pity's
sake, folks," he wrote, "we are all —
hard as it is to tell sometimes —
adults here."
Tonight, however, Natelson is
optimistic that debate will be short

and centered on the topic. ASSU
Senator Harris Shapiro agreed. "If
we can have a debate on [the bill],"
he said, "that debate would be fair
ly civil, I hope."
Natelson is confident that one of
the three plans will pass and will be
happy to see the issue put to rest.
He favors the districting by de
gree plan, which he drafted, but he
is more concerned with correcting
the present system than pushing
his own agenda.
"I won't feel too upset by any of
the three bills" passing, Natelson
said. "It's a situation where you're
trying to be fair numerically, and
there are so many issues."
Aingworth, too, favors the dis
trict by degree plan. "The proposal
groups people in a way that the peo
ple they would elect to represent
them would have the most in com
mon with them," he said.
He remains opposed to the first
bill and would not rule out any polit
ical manner of defeating it."I would
prefer passing nothing," he said, "to
(passing) the first proposal."
If nothing is passed, Shapiro said
the spring election could be chal
lenged on constitutional grounds.
