Stanford's opponents may change, but the
results stay the same.
The women's synchronized swimming
team traveled north Saturday, this time

give Stanford extra firepower at the national
championships.
"Heather has really boosted all of us," said
senior co-captain Maia Young. "She's helping
us not just with the points from her individu

leadership as a whole. Heather's Olympic
experience has given us a fresh perspective on
our team event, and that's a routine that she

This boost was clearly evident Saturday, as
the focused Cardinal achieved its goal of qual
ifying all 11 swimmers for the NCAA Cham
pionships. Senior Bridget Finn, who placed
second in the figures competition, paired with
Pease to conquer the duet event. They were
followed by senior Lesley Riddervold and
