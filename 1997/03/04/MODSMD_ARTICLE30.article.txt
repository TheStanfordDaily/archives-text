# On to NCAAs
## Synchro wins West Regional 
### Scott Judd Contributing writer 
Stanford's opponents may change, but the
results stay the same.
The women's synchronized swimming
team traveled north Saturday, this time
squaring off against California, St. Mary's,
Arizona and Washington in the NCAA West
Regional Championships in Seattle. The
result? Another crushing Stanford victory, as
the polished Cardinal swept all events and
continued its decade-long tradition of bring
ing home the West Regional crown.
With its latest triumph, the second-ranked
Cardinal remains undefeated for the year and
is in a strong position for next week's NCAA
Championships at Florida State. Junior
Heather Pease led the charge for Stanford,
trouncing her competition en route to win
ning the figures, solo, duet and trio competi
tions.
Pease, a gold medalist at last year's

Olympics, transferred to Stanford this year
and has dominated collegiate synchronized
swimming ever since. In meets this year,
Pease has not lost a single event and should
give Stanford extra firepower at the national
championships.
"Heather has really boosted all of us," said
senior co-captain Maia Young. "She's helping
us not just with the points from her individu
al swimming but with her knowledge and
leadership as a whole. Heather's Olympic
experience has given us a fresh perspective on
our team event, and that's a routine that she
doesn't even compete in."
This boost was clearly evident Saturday, as
the focused Cardinal achieved its goal of qual
ifying all 11 swimmers for the NCAA Cham
pionships. Senior Bridget Finn, who placed
second in the figures competition, paired with
Pease to conquer the duet event. They were
followed by senior Lesley Riddervold and
sophomore Vanessa Shaw, who
finished the duet event a close sec
ond.
Shaw joined with Pease and
Finn in the trio competition as
their routine claimed yet another
event for Stanford. The Card's
second trio team of freshman
Julie Enos, sophomore Catherine
Chen and senior Amy Markezick
had already previously qualified
for nationals. Rounding out Stan
ford's sweep was the eight-mem
ber team competition, where
Stanford's dynamic and precise

routine drowned all other oppo
nents.
After this dominant victory,
Stanford will focus even more
intensely on what has been its sea
son-long goal — toppling perennial
national champion Ohio State
from its throne. This will not be an
easy task; Ohio State has twice as
many scholarship swimmers as
Stanford and expects to qualify 30
swimmers for nationals.
"It's the classic David vs.
Goliath story," said assistant coach
Andy Maisel. "What we bring to
the NCAAs is a small group of very
hard-working, very talented swim
mers. It may be an uphill battle,
but we're definitely on the right
path."
