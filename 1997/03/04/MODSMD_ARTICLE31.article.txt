# Women's rugby crushes Claremont 65-12
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Essentially preparing for an
upcoming match against league oppo
nent UC-Santa Cruz, the women's
rugby team demolished Clareinont
College 65-12 over the weekend. And
in a warmup match before Sunday's
showdown against top-ranked Cali
fornia, the second-ranked men's
rugby team handed Humboldt State a
16-12 loss.
For the women, the victory was a
small one in that the opponent was
not very competitive. The Stanford
women have proven to be one of the
top teams in the region, but in order
for them to advance in the postsea
son, they will have to be able to take
on the higher-caliber teams in addi
tion to squads like the Stags.
"I would say that a major factor in
the game was the fact that the teams
were very unevenly matched," said

senior Claire Dacey. "I think that
although people played well, we didn't
play with the intensity that we could
have because it wasn't a very hard
game.
"Mostly my impression of the game
was that it was a fun game, but a lot
of times in that kind of game you
don't keep that level of focus and
intensity that you could have."
Despite not being much of a test,
last weekend's match allowed the
Cardinal to work on fine tuning some
of the basic skills of the game. The
passing coming down the field was
much quicker, Dacey said.
Speed will be the key for the
women, who lack size. Because they
cannot take on most of their opponents
head-to-head, they have to be able to
outrun and out finesse the opposition.
This involves not only foot speed but
also speed in decision-making in order
to avoid contact.
The win for the men was also one

that lacked in excitement. However,
the match gave the men an anticli
mactic break from an otherwise
intense schedule.
On Feb. 24, the Cardinal defeated
then-No. 2 UC-Davis in a seesaw
match. The victory set up a show
down between the top two schools in
the nation, Stanford and Cal, for Sun
day, with the Humboldt game serving
as a small break in between clashes of
the titans.
The game against the Lumberjacks
gave the squad an opportunity to rest
some of their starters and also gave
the second-team players a chance to
start.
Many of the first-team players
needed the break to recover from
injuries. Freshman Desmond Croan is
still questionable for this weekend
after twisting his knee against the
University of British Columbia, and
senior Joel Drescher has also been on
the injured list.
