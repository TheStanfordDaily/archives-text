## No. 6 baseball gets breather vs. Dons 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
How hot is the Stanford base
ball team?
Ask San Francisco Dons head
coach Rich Hill.
"We need to throw Stanford the
ball underhand because that is the
only pitch they haven't hit hard so
far this season," Hill said.
Although Hill may be slightly
exaggerating, No. 6 Stanford (15-6)
is en fuego. The combination of
solid pitching and clutch hitting
has given the Card a five-game
winning streak, including a three
game weekend sweep of the then-
No. 3 USC Trojans at home to open
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division season. USC has since
slipped to seventh in the rankings.
While the entire squad is swing
ing the bat extremely well, sopho
more center fielder Jody Gerut led
the bunch this weekend with seven
RBIs. Junior shortstop Jay Pecci
and freshman John Gall each con
tributed seven hits, including three
doubles apiece.
The Cardinal pitching staff has
compiled a combined 4.09 ERA and
the offense has left opposing pitch
ers with a 8.27 ERA. Tonight Stan
ford will use a combination of pitch
ers in an attempt to stop the USF
Dons (8-8), including junior Adam
Harris and freshman Brian
Feamow. The game begins at 7
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.

However, the Card must beware
of USF's Jermaine Clark. A presea
son third-team All-American,
Clark is one of the most exciting
position players in the Bay Area.
Clark was named the first West
Coast Conference player of 1997
after going 7-for-19 with a home
run, five runs and six RBIs.
Led by Clark, the Dons use a
solid defense (.962 fielding percent
age) and consistent offense to sup
port their erratic pitching staff.
"We have been up and down,"
Hill said. "We have been very good,
very bad and mediocre."
The Dons have the advantage of
being well-rested as they have not
played since Wednesday, when
they split a doubleheader with
Southern Utah. Taking the mound
for USF will be senior Greg March
banks (2-1, 7.11 ERA).
"They are rested," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
need to hold them early in the
game and score a few runs early."
For Stanford, this game falls
between two huge Six-Pac series,
last weekend's battle with USC
and the coming weekend's road
trip to No. 11 Arizona State. The
Tuesday games provide the Card a
chance to give some different play
ers game time which will be valu
able down the road.
"It forces us to use some other
pitchers, which is good in the over
all scheme of things," Marquess
said.
