# Softball drops three of four games
## Inconsistencies trouble team against Hornets, Devils 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The softball team's season
long nemesis, low run produc
tion, along with uncharacteristi
cally poor pitching, resulted in
three losses out of four games
played this weekend. The team
(10-9, 0-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
split the first series against
Sacramento State, losing 1-0
and winning 6-5 and lost both
Pac.-10 games against Arizona
State 6-1, 7-3.
The normally strong pitching
performances that the softball
team has become accustomed to
were certainly not there
throughout the weekend, except
for in game one against Sacra
mento State.
In that game, sophomore Car
dinal pitcher Becky Blevins lim
ited Sacramento to two hits and
one run. The run scored was
unearned, manufactured by an
error, walk and a weak base hit
in the third inning.
It was unfortunate for the
Cardinal that Sacramento State
pitcher Susie Bugliearello was
just as dominating. She went
the distance, recording an
impressive 11 strikeouts and
allowing only two hits.
In game two against the Hor
nets, Stanford was able to get it
together offensively and put
together nine hits for six runs.
The team scored early — three
runs in the first and all six runs
by the end of the fifth inning.
Sacramento State pitcher Robin
Jury couldn't get out of the first
inning and was yanked by her
coach after giving up three
earned runs in two-thirds of an
inning.
The hitters who caused the
most damage for the Cardinal
were sophomore shortstop
Michelle Schneider and sopho
more right fielder Michelle Acos
ta. Schneider went 3-for-4. Her
impressive statistics for the
game included a double, stolen
base and two runs batted in.
Acosta went 2-for-2, had a dou
ble and drove in four runs.
The squad had a bit of a scare
toward the end of the game, as
the Hornets scored three runs in
the last two innings. This was
the first game back for Jessica
Schulman, who relieved starter
Marcy Crouch in the seventh
inning to record the final two
outs. Schulman was obviously a
little rusty, but her return signi
fies the strengthening of an
already formidable pitching
staff.
After a disappointing split
against Sacramento State, the
Cardinal came into Sunday's
series against 15th-ranked Ari
zona State looking for two wins.
The Sun Devils had just won

their own tournament the previ
ous weekend and brought an
impressive 8-2 record to their
series against Stanford.
In game one, the usually
steady Blevins was rocked early
as the Sun Devils scored four
runs in the first three innings.
The Stanford players weren't
able to get any solid part of the
bat on the ball, with weak pop
flies dominating the Cardinal's
outs.
The Cardinal did have seven
hits during the game in compar
ison to Arizona State's nine, but
the Cardinal also gave up five
walks and had three errors.
Sophomore right fielder
Shane Anderson had two hits in
the game, and a 3-for-6 weekend
performance against the Sun

Devils. But Anderson's strong
outing was one of the few offen
sive contributions over the
weekend.
Game two could have been
the game that salvaged the
weekend for the Cardinal.
Instead, it ended up as nothing
more than the second loss to
Arizona State.
Once again the Sun Devils
were able to get on the score
board early. In the second
inning, Arizona State scored
with two outs after an over
thrown ball by Schneider to first
baseman Summer Lee. The Sun
Devils tacked on three runs in
the fourth inning, with the Car
dinal giving up as many errors
as hits.
Stanford tried to answer

back, scoring three runs in the
fourth inning. Lee provided a
clutch two-out double to drive
in runners from second and
third.
In the fifth inning it looked
like the Cardinal would tie the
score, but Stanford was unable
to bring in senior third baseman
Amanda Renteria, who had sin
gled to lead off the inning, from
second base.
Three runs scored in the sev
enth by Arizona State made a
last-inning comeback out of
reach for the Cardinal, putting
the game away.
Despite the tough losses this
weekend, Stanford should use
the setbacks to build upon and
work on improving the Cardi
nal's offensive output.
