# Women's water polo gets first tournament victory ever
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
Winning games is not something new
for the Stanford women's water polo
team, but winning tournaments is new to
the Cardinal. The third-ranked Stanford
squad chalked up its first tournament
victory in its two-year history as a varsi
ty sport this weekend at UC-Santa Bar
bara.
The Cardinal's road to victory came on
four wins in two days. The last of these
was a 5-4 win in the championship Sun
day afternoon against a club team, Gold
en West. The game was locked at 4-4

until freshman Katie Powell scored for
Stanford with just over two minutes left.
The Golden West squad that included
three junior national team players and
one senior national team player was
unable to answer and Stanford held on to
win.
Golden West had beaten second-ranked
California earlier in the day. Stanford had
come to the Gauchos' tournament with
the hopes of meeting the Golden Bears in
the finals, but Golden West thwarted
those hopes.
"We weren't really stressed out about
this game. Had it been Cal we would have
definitely been more nervous," said

sophomore goalkeeper Heather Crary.
Stanford's path to the final was a
smooth one as they were not challenged in
any of their first round games. In their
first game Saturday, the Cardinal defeat
ed Redlands, a Division 111 school, 19-2.
That afternoon Stanford faced a UC-San
Diego squad that it had beaten two weeks
earlier 16-1. The margin was smaller this
go around, but the result was the same as
Stanford shut out the Tritons 8-0.
These two games ensured Stanford a
spot in the semifinals Sunday morning,
where the Cardinal faced UC-Davis who,
like UC-San Diego, Stanford had beaten
two weeks earlier. This too was a blowout

as the Cardinal won 9-2.
"We dominated UC-Davis even more
then we did the last game," Cathcart said.
The Cardinal's tournament victory
came with relative ease and also helped
Stanford improve on their offense. In its
season-opening tournament the Cardinal
relied on standout freshman Ellen Estes
and Suze Gardner to find the net and
looked to spread the scoring more evenly
over the weekend. And at Santa Barbara
Stanford did just that as 10 different Car
dinal players scored.
"The games were good to see what we
need to work on," Crary said. "As a team
we played really together."
