# Cardinal sailing takes second to Navy at intersectional
## Contested race puts first place out of reach 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
sailing team saw i first-place fin
ish drift away at this weekend's
10-team intersectional contest at
Redwood City, yet emerged seem
ingly more confident than before.
"We finished second, but we
met all of our goals," said coach
Steve Bourdow.
Navy (17-5) took first-place
honors, while St. Mary's (Md.)
(15-6) grabbed third.
"The goals were to make the
final four and help develop a
fourth team-racing boat," Bour
dow said.
"We had a real solid top three
Iboats], but there was a gap
between them and No. 4. This
weekend showed that we could do
OK if we lose our top three."
Other team members echoed
their coach's enthusiasm.
"We sailed well. It was the
first big team race regatta of the
season," said sophomore Adri
enne Stoltz. "Communication
was always good. We sailed rela

tively clean."
However, sophomore Steve
Kleha thought that the team's
communication was somewhat
lacking, given the expectations for
the team. "Communication was
not up to par, at least for a team
that came in second at nationals
last year," Kleha said.
The weather provided a perk
for the Cardinal's weekend com
petition. "The conditions were
excellent," Bourdow said. "We
completed two complete round
robins. Every team competed
against every other team twice."
In each race, both competing
teams sent three of their boats out
on the water. Each of the six boats
then received a certain number of
points depending on its finish.
Because blocking and other
maneuvering are allowed in this
type of racing, teamwork was crit
ical, Bourdow said.
The schools with the top four
records then headed to the finals,
where they faced one another
once more. After the two prelimi
nary rounds, the Cardinal had a
16-2 record. Not only was this eas

ily good enough to make the
finals, but it left the Stanford
squad with a seemingly com
manding lead over its competi
tors.
However, things did not go so
well in the final round of competi
tion. The Cardinal dropped its
first two races, and to make mat
ters worse, it lost its lone victory
on a protest from Navy.
"We won the race on the water
but lost on protest," Kleha said.
The team's 16-5 cumulative
record left it with a close second
place finish to the Midshipmen.
Nevertheless Stoltz thought it
was a good learning experience.
"With East Coast schools you
don't know what to expect, how
much they've improved from last
season," she explained.
The team's outlook remains
optimistic for upcoming competi
tions as well as for nationals.
"This team has the potential tal
ent to win the national champi
onship," Kleha said.
During spring break the Stan
ford team will head to the Ranier
Cup in Portland, Ore.
