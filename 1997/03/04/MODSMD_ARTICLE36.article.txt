# Equestrian team overcomes setbacks to win champion at Intercollegiate Horseshow
## 
### Erin Reilly Staff writer 
The Cardinal western equestrian team
began the season with four riders and no
horses. After Sunday the team of nine won
champion at the Intercollegiate Horseshow in
Fresno.
This marks a growing string of success for
the team after winning reserve champion at
King's River College two weeks ago.
Wrangling up the victory were a trio of
sophomores, all who live in Mirlo. Sophomore
Mark Gundersen pointed out of beginner
stock seat after winning first at King's River
and second at Fresno. Gundersen moves into
intermediate and said he wants to concen
trate on loping since in the beginner division
riders are judged solely at the walk and jog.
"Intermediate I is a big class and to place
within the top three will be a challenge I look
forward to," Gundersen said.
Gundersen aims to qualify for nationals,
which Stanford will host this spring. "I have
had my sights set on nationals since I joined
the team last spring," he said. Dormmate
Shannon Kiesling tied for second in begin
ning stock seat, an impressive ribbon for her
first show, and Kiesling's roommate Laura
Drum took fifth.
Freshman Jamie Shamseldin once again
flashed great style in the open stock seat and
open reining divisions. Shamseldin placed
second and fifth respectively, and sophomore
Kathleen Gilbert was third in open reining
and fourth in open stock seat. It was Gilbert's
second western show.
"I always seem to leave the ring wishing I
could ride another time," Gilbert said. "I
think it's a blast to ride reining patterns;
that's probably my favorite part of riding
open because it requires such control and
speed at the same time. If you draw a good
horse, you can do sliding stops and spins,
which for me are just as exciting as jumping a
course."
Gilbert rides for both the English and
western teams and said riding both disci
plines means more time in the saddle. Riding
western and English "presents different
challenges. Some aspects of your body posi
tion are different, like the more forward seat
of hunt seat versus sitting deeper and lean
ing back in stock seat, but I actually think
that I'm more conscious of my upper-body
position since I started riding western
again."
Coach Karine Baudoin said the young
team has improved tremendously over the
year. Western competition is based on the
position of the rider and understanding the
horse. Baudouin said the team now under
stands what to do to solve a problem — the
key to winning. Baudoin is confident heading
into the show and said, "We will get high
point again."
The A team, A for Amanda that is, domi
nated the jumping classes in the English com
petition with junior Amanda Hoche, sopho
more Amanda Gillett and senior Amanda

Boyd topping their events.
Team president Hoche was reserve high
point rider and now leads the region in the
vying for the Cacchione Cup — an award for
high-point open riders. Hoche said that since
coach Barbara Close began training both
beginner and advanced team members, the
team has really focused. Previously, beginner
riders took lessons from the Red Barn riding
school.
Hoche said despite the poor quality of
horses at Fresno, the English team was pre
pared for competition. "My horse was horrid;
it was not to be believed," said Hoche, who
still managed third on the flat and fourth
over fences.
Amanda Boyd had to reride the course
after problems with her horse but placed

third over fences and on the fiat in the novice
division. Sophomores Ann Carney and Vanes
sa Bartsch (western team president), were
second — the flat division was split. Mandy
Gillett pointed out of intermediate fiat and
will close out the year competing in open flat.
The overall English team champion was
Cal Poly and Fresno won reserve. The Cardi
nal riders compete at Cal Poly on Saturday.
Watch out for sophomore Lynne Chou, who
rejoined the team after taking fall quarter off.
Chou is close to qualifying for regionals
because of points accumulated from last sea
son. Also watch for freshman Jaimie McKin
nell in the walk trot division.
"He's only been riding a month," said
Hoche. "He can ride any horse, and it looks as
if he's been riding for years He is amazing."
