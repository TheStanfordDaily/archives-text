# Cycling makes strong showing at Cal-Poly
## 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's cycling
team took on a strong field of
teams that included California,
Cal Poly- San Luis Obispo, UC-
Santa Barbara, UC-Davis,
UCLA, San Diego State and UC-
San Diego. Cal Poly hosted the
weekend's competition in San
Luis Obispo.
In addition to the larger con
tingencies, smaller groups of
four and five also competed from
Chico State, Sacramento State,
San Jose State, Nevada and Cal
Poly-Pomona.
The Stanford squad, totaling
20 cyclists, posted a second-place
showing in the road race and
individual highlights in the team
time trials and criterium.
In the team time trials, gradu
ate students Lee Fleming, Pete
Armitage, Russell Mead and

Dario Falquier beating Santa
Barbara by 3 seconds. Coach Art
Walker said Mead came on late
as Falquier and Armitage start
ed to fade.
For the women, graduate stu
dents Cathy Norbutas and Cyn
thia Ferguson placed third in the
team time trials, despite sending
only two riders out for what is
generally a four-person competi
tion.
"Ideally it's a four-person
race; sometimes it becomes nec
essary for schools with teams
that are very small to ride with
less than that," Walker said.
"They beat a number of four
rider teams and were not beaten
by any teams as small."
Sending a two-person team
out was strategic to allow more
competitors for Stanford overall
in the event and to yield a lower
time, he explained.
"The work for a four-person

team is substantially reduced,"
said junior Mark Leibowitz.
Other individual highlights
include senior Andy Price's
fourth place finish in D's in cri
terium competition. Leibowitz
said that D's are a starting point
for riders to learn skills.
Despite being a first-year
racer, "he's got a lot of power
and seems to race fairly intelli
gently," Walker said.
In the road race A's, Falquier
and Armitage took second and
fifth place respectively. Falquier
and Armitage were behind the
breakaway pack when Walker
spotted them the first time but
managed to battle to the front
pack in the next 30 miles to give
their coach a salute the second
time around.
"WTien they came through the
feed zone the second time, both
Dario and Pete were both in
there (the front) and saluted me

and grinned," Walker said.
"They spent the previous miles
crossing the gap, and they were
feeling a sense of personal relief
at that moment."
Overall in the road race, the
Stanford team came in second to
Cal Poly, 289-175.
"The event that meant the
most to me was the road race,
which we did best at — second
place as a school," Walker said.
"We had a couple of people
from whom we expected big
results and we didn't get them,
and some people were missing,
but I discovered after adding up
the point sums that we got sec
ond.
"In every category (of the
road race) somebody did the job
very well, or multiple somebod
ies like men's B's — (graduate
student) Mike Cummer and
(freshman) Will Parks had great
rides."
