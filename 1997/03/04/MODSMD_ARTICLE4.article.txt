# Electricians picket SLAC
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A dispute involving several electricians working at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center resulted in a
small demonstration on Thursday and an investiga
tion into hiring practices.
According to William Petros, an organizer for the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
about 15 workers put up "informational pickets" at
two entrances to the center after being told there was
no work for them on Thursday and Friday.
"We knew definitely there was work available to
them, but it was done by people making a lower wage,"
Petros said.

The electricians concerned were employees of the
Valhalla Company, a contracting firm. Petros said
many other tradesmen working at SLAC respected the
picket line and did not enter the facility.
He emphasized that the action was not a strike but
an informational picket to let the public know about
what he characterized as violations of federal employ
ment laws at SLAC.
According to Petros, SLAC has been illegally using
low-wage temporary workers to do construction jobs
covered by the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act, which mandates
that workers on federal construction projects be paid a
federally-determined "prevailing local wage." As a divi-
sion of the University fully funded
by the Department of Energy,
SLAC falls under Davis-Bacon.
SLAC spokeswoman P. A.
Moore said the workers were told
not to come to work on Thursday
because the project they were work
ing on, called the B-Factoiy, was
scheduled for "commissioning
tests," which would close the site
for two days.
Afler the picket on Thursday,
some of the electricians involved
were asked to come in to work on
Friday, Assoc. SLAC Director Jerry
Jobe said.
Moore said "SLAC management
has begun an investigation" of
whether the union was correct in
saying there are additional jobs
that should be allocated to its work
ers.
Lee Lyon, SLAC's personnel di
rector, said SLAC does hire tempo
rary workers in addition to the
union contractor, but noted that
Davis-Bacon restrictions cover only
construction work and not mainte-

nance and replacement of existing
equipment.
"We do not hire [temporary
workers intentionally] to do Davis-
Bacon work. There have been in
stances where there's been confu
sion and we've used them for Davis-
Bacon work," Lyon said.
Petros said there is an "ongoing
discussion" between SLAC and his
union over using temporary work
ers in this fashion. He said he had
repeatedly pointed out instances of
what he saw as violations. While
they were sometimes corrected, he
said, new ones continued to ap
pear.
He said he was "pretty opti
mistic" about SLAC Director Bur
ton Richter's pledge to investigate
the matter, a pledge Petros directly
attributed to Thursday's action.
"I do believe that there are peo
ple in administration who under
stand there's a problem, but I be
lieve there's people in middle man
agement who keep on" maintaining
current practices, Petros said.
He said SLAC management had,
on several instances, rejected the
recommendations of its own stand
ing committee that is supposed to
provide advice on what work is cov-

ered by Davis-Bacon.
Lyon criticized this interpreta
tion of the facts. He noted that the
committee in question makes its
recommendations to the Depart
ment of Energy, which makes final
determinations on what work is
covered.
It is the Department of Energy's
decision that is binding rather than
the SLAC committee's, Lyon ex
plained. Therefore, if the two deci
sions do not agree, SLAC is obliged
to reject its own committee's deci
sion.
He also attributed some of the
dispute to the nature of Depart
ment of Energy decisions, which
often deal with large projects in
general terms: "it's not always clear
what a decision means when you're
talking about one wire," he said.
According to Petros, however,
the practices to which the union ob
jects may be more widespread.
"We have very little knowledge
of how much Davis-Bacon violation
there is," he said. He added that the
union had filed requests under the
Freedom of Information Act to
"find out all the (electrical) work
that's been done and how it's been
allotted."
