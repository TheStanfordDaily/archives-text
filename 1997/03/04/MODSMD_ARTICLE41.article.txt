# Volunteers in Asia seek student help
## 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Leaders of Trans-Pacific Exchange, part of
Volunteers in Asia, are soliciting students to
serve as paid assistants this summer for the
program's 20th year.
The program has grown from 50 students a
year to more than 300 and currently brings to
Stanford students from Japan, Taiwan and
Vietnam.
"The general purpose is to foster cross-cul
tural understanding between Asia and the
U. 5.," said Sara Ackerman, one of four program
directors. "Our mission here is to expose Stan
ford students to other cultures, specifically
Asia, and to provide them with an opportunity
to develop their leadership skills "
The vast majority of the incoming students
are university undergraduates, Ackerman said.
The purpose of Trans-Pacific Exchange is "to
introduce Asian students to American student
life and culture," she said.
Asian students will come from the Chengchi
University and the National Taiwan University
in Taiwan and the Keio University, Doshisha
University and Kobe Women's College in
Japan.
The Ford Foundation is providing funds for

the Vietnamese students, who are selected by
various government ministries.
In addition to taking classes in English com
munication and American culture at Stanford,
the exchange students will also learn in a resi
dential education system during their six weeks
on campus.
Stanford students will serve as program as
sistants, or hosts, program director and former
summer host Alice Lee said. "There are a lot of
dorm-based panels and discussions. We try to
give the students a deeper sense of American so
ciety through various viewpoints."
In addition to living with the students in dor
mitories, the hosts will help plan dorm pro
grams, encourage students to speak English
and build person-to-person individual relation
ships. Scheduled activities include guest speak
ers, diversity panels, a gay and lesbian panel
and a discussion of the media's influence on so
ciety.
"Before they come to the U.S. on this pro
gram they have a lot of misconceptions and
stereotypes about the U.S. that they got from
watching television or American movies in their
own countries," Lee said. "A common miscon
ception is that all Americans have guns, or that
all people are like 'Beverly Hills, 90210.' "
Lee added that besides having these pro

grams, the goal of the Trans-Pacific Exchange
is "to internationalize the campus, because very
few people know much about Asia. They might
know about China and Japan, but very few peo
ple know about Taiwan, Vietnam or Indonesia.
"We want Stanford students to understand
more about Asia because it's an important area
of the world, economically and militarily," Lee
says.
Another Trans-Pacific Exchange group in
cludes Asian English teachers seeking to im
prove their knowledge of the language as well as
their teaching ability. The teachers come inde
pendently and are hosted by graduate students.
The Volunteers in Asia program began in the
1960s when Stanford first sent English teach
ers into third world countries, something that
continues to this day. Japan initiated the
Trans-Pacific Exchange program in the next
decade.
Other Trans-Pacific Exchange programs
run during the fall, in which students from Sin
gapore were brought to study business and In
addition, Japanese students also will visit Stan
ford as part the alternative spring break pro
gram. Throughout the year, Volunteers in Asia
offers eight Treat Fellowships, awards dedicat
ed to a former professor who promoted a
greater understanding of Asia.
