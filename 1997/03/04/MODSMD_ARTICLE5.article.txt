# Grad theme house prevents isolation

The cliche holds that graduate
school is a lonely and busy experi
ence â€” you don't even know who
lives next door. Some people
don't see their roommates for
days.
But those living in the Rains
multicultural theme house go be
yond the stereotype by greeting
and meeting people from all over
the world.
"What I like the most is that
there is a sense of neighborhood
here. People say 'Hello' when
they pass you by," said Nancy
Tsai, a doctoral student in me
chanical engineering, who's been
at Stanford for seven years.
Rains buildings No. 8, 9 and

needs and cultures of all groups.
Doctoral student in political
science Kareem Crayton, one of
the coordinators of the theme
house, said the reason he wanted
to live there was because. "I knew
graduate school is much smaller
than undergraduate and it's diffi
cult to establish network."
Kunie Kikunaga, a doctoral
student in education, signed up
for the house because she wanted
to meet many different people.
Kikunaga especially appreciated
seeing her name on the welcome
sign on the door.
"Small thing like this makes
the difference from other gradu
ate residences," Kikunaga said.
Undergraduates get this kind
of treatment the day they arrive
on the Farm. But because many
graduate students have families
or live off-campus, the communi-
