# Grad theme house prevents isolation
## 
### Mariko Hayashibara 
The cliche holds that graduate
school is a lonely and busy experi
ence — you don't even know who
lives next door. Some people
don't see their roommates for
days.
But those living in the Rains
multicultural theme house go be
yond the stereotype by greeting
and meeting people from all over
the world.
"What I like the most is that
there is a sense of neighborhood
here. People say 'Hello' when
they pass you by," said Nancy
Tsai, a doctoral student in me
chanical engineering, who's been
at Stanford for seven years.
Rains buildings No. 8, 9 and
16 are designed to serve as the
multicultural theme house and
are the hub of multicultural edu
cational activities for graduate
students, according to Chris Grif
fith, director of graduate resi
dences.
There are 108 people of vari
ous ethnic backgrounds, includ
ing international students from
Asia, Europe and Africa, and peo
ple of mixed descent, she said.
About 70 requested the theme

house. All single graduate stu
dents who are assigned to the
Rains complex have the option to
live there.
The theme house was estab
lished in 1989 to prevent the iso
lation many minority graduate
students feel and to support the
needs and cultures of all groups.
Doctoral student in political
science Kareem Crayton, one of
the coordinators of the theme
house, said the reason he wanted
to live there was because. "I knew
graduate school is much smaller
than undergraduate and it's diffi
cult to establish network."
Kunie Kikunaga, a doctoral
student in education, signed up
for the house because she wanted
to meet many different people.
Kikunaga especially appreciated
seeing her name on the welcome
sign on the door.
"Small thing like this makes
the difference from other gradu
ate residences," Kikunaga said.
Undergraduates get this kind
of treatment the day they arrive
on the Farm. But because many
graduate students have families
or live off-campus, the communi-

ty is dispersed. Thus, the theme
house unite different interests.
"It serves to bridge to other cul
tures," Griffith said. "Through the
theme house, we try to identify is
sues of American minority groups.
"Reflecting the population of
the community, every area at
Stanford, by nature, is multicul
tural," she said. "We just provide
opportunity to learn other cul
tures."
The theme house is currently
led by five coordinators and two
Graduate Resident Assistants,
who are all house residents.
They are responsible for build
ing community spirit and helping
students enjoy and learn from
their multicultural experience.
Doctoral student Kathy
Williams, one of the coordinators,
said the group tries to help people
expose to unique experiences.
For example, the staff organizes
a special study break every other
week, such as gay and lesbian wel

come day, international desserts
day and discussion of Hong Kong
transition day.
These sort of events drew Tsai
to the theme house. "All resi
dences sponsor study breaks from
time to time, but of all the years
I've lived on campus, this is the
first time I've been to a study
break that had as its theme 'inter
national desserts.' "
Crayton, a coordinator, said the
study break is not just a place for
people to eat and leave.
"It's important to provide a
form of discussion related to diver
sity," he said. "This is a great
chance to share issues with people
from other disciplines, too."
Crayton said participation is
greater at the theme house. He
added that what they are doing
could be adopted in other graduate
residents.
"These issues are important
not only for minorities," Crayton
said. "That's why we want to in
vite a lot of people."
For spring quarter, the staff
plans on having a discussion of in
terracial dating as well as jazz
night and Latino band night. "It

doesn't have to be information
packed," Williams said. "We also
have having fun in common."
The coordinators and GRAs are
well-informed about events on
campus that appeal to different po
litical, cultural, ethnic, literary,
artistic and educational interests.
To keep up with the information
and plan the events, they hold offi
cial meetings every two weeks.
"I like the whole ideas of what
they do," said doctoral student
Lupita Montoya, a former coordi
nator. She pointed out that aspects
of the undergraduate system could
be valuable to the theme house
"A lot of things are set up by un
dergraduates," Montoya said.
"This tradition hasn't trans
formed to grads."
However, many graduate stu
dents are not even aware of the ex
istence of the theme house. To pro
mote the house, the staff plans on
having an open house to invite
everyone before the next housing
application.
"The theme house is a place you
can use academic method such as
critical skills to socialize relation
ships," Crayton said.
