# Students file for candidacy
## Three running for ASSU president 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
The 1997 ASSU election season
kicked off yesterday with the offi
cial announcement of three presi
dential slates and 33 senate candi
dates.
Running for president and vice
president respectively are Emily
Andrus and Ben Decker, Jim Fin
sten and Kelly Naylor, and Howard
Loo and Solomon Lefler.
Thirty undergraduates declared
their candidacy for 15 undergradu
ate senate slots. However, only
three graduate students will appear
on the ballot. The remaining 12
graduate senators will be filled after
the election, scheduled for April 16
and 17.
One of the cornerstones of the
Andrus and Decker campaign will
be reaching out to the majority of
students who are not part of the
"traditional vocal groups." Andrus
stressed the need not only to work
with the groups but also to include
students with a broader range of
concerns. Additionally, they hope to
interact more closely with graduate
students.
Other goals include increasing

student representation on Univer
sity committees, adding a student
representative to the Board of
Trustees, creating a course review
book, encouraging administrative
support for interdisciplinary and
self-designed majors and creating a
weekly calendar of events to better
publicize ASSU programming.
Andrus also stressed the impor
tance of having an ASSU president
with ASSU experience, as next year
there will be many new senators
and a new financial manager.
"There will not be the wealth of ex
perience of the past," said Andrus,
who along with Decker is a junior.
Finsten and Naylor will run on a
platform of student empowerment.
They plan to seek more space and
funding for student organizations,
address the need to place greater
emphasis on undergraduate teach
ing and gain greater student influ
ence on the University administra
tion and its resource allocation.
Finsten, citing the success of this
year's ASSU leadership in eroding
the notion that "the ASSU is not a
particularly salient group for most
students," indicated that he wants
to continue the strides made in
working with students and admin
istrators.
When asked why he was running
for ASSU President, Finsten said,
"I think that the ASSU post-'Con
stitution '96' can be used much
more effectively in controlling
(Stanford's) education."
Finsten also lauded the strength
of his ticket. "We are a very good
team.... I am pretty familiar with

the ASSU from an outsider's per
spective whereas Kelly has shown a
tremendous commitment to stu
dent leadership in the ASSU and to
student activism."
Finsten, a senior, will be pursu
ing a master's in international poli
cy studies next year. Naylor is a ju
nior.
Loo and Lefler promise a differ
ent kind of ASSU leadership in
which "honor and integrity can be
brought back to student govern
ment." Loo emphasized that his
government would "work with the
administration rather than making
demands to it." He said his team

would provide the administration
with a coherent student vision
rather than "taking stands and run
ning activist campaigns."
Adding that "we all contribute to
the Stanford community whether
we are athletes, professors, etc.," Loo
indicated that has talents are politics
and policy making. Emphasizing his
desire to improve Stanford, Loo said
"there is no better place to do that
than as ASSU president."
Loo, who in June will be complet
ing a bachelor's in political science,
plans to earn another bachelor's in
computer science next year. Lefler
is a junior.
