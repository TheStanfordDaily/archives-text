# Students file for candidacy
## Three running for ASSU president 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
The 1997 ASSU election season
kicked off yesterday with the offi
cial announcement of three presi
dential slates and 33 senate candi
dates.
Running for president and vice
president respectively are Emily
Andrus and Ben Decker, Jim Fin
sten and Kelly Naylor, and Howard
Loo and Solomon Lefler.
Thirty undergraduates declared
their candidacy for 15 undergradu
ate senate slots. However, only
three graduate students will appear
on the ballot. The remaining 12
graduate senators will be filled after
the election, scheduled for April 16
and 17.
One of the cornerstones of the
Andrus and Decker campaign will
be reaching out to the majority of
students who are not part of the
"traditional vocal groups." Andrus
stressed the need not only to work
with the groups but also to include
students with a broader range of
concerns. Additionally, they hope to
interact more closely with graduate
students.
Other goals include increasing

student representation on Univer
sity committees, adding a student
representative to the Board of
Trustees, creating a course review
book, encouraging administrative
support for interdisciplinary and
self-designed majors and creating a
weekly calendar of events to better
publicize ASSU programming.
Andrus also stressed the impor
tance of having an ASSU president
with ASSU experience, as next year
there will be many new senators
and a new financial manager.
"There will not be the wealth of ex
perience of the past," said Andrus,
who along with Decker is a junior.
Finsten and Naylor will run on a
platform of student empowerment.
They plan to seek more space and
funding for student organizations,
address the need to place greater
emphasis on undergraduate teach
ing and gain greater student influ
ence on the University administra
tion and its resource allocation.
Finsten, citing the success of this
year's ASSU leadership in eroding
the notion that "the ASSU is not a
particularly salient group for most
students," indicated that he wants
