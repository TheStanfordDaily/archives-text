Step One:
Connect a million people to the Internet. For free.
Want to help us with Step Two?
Juno just launched hist April, and it's already one of the five largest providers
of Internet e mail in the country. It's by far the largest to provide e-mail
to the public for free. More than a million people have created Juno accounts.
Kvery day, another eight thousand or so sign up.
How does it work? The same as network TV. Sponsors pay, so members
don't have to.
We're working on our second million now. To pull this off, and to build the
other exciting projects now on our whiteboards, we need to expand our staff
dramatically in almost all areas: software engineering, marketing, telecommu
nications, sales, finance, analysis, product development, member services, and
accounting. We only hire exceptionally talented, accomplished, and intelligent
individuals-people who, in their field, are the very best. If you are a college
senior with a record of being the very best (in any field-our president was an
English major), we want to hear from you.
Want to play a role in the development of a service that in less than a year
has become a major force on the Internet and in millions of people's lives?
