# ROTC signs agreement

Santa Clara University ROTC courses will be offered
using Stanford facilities in the fall and re-evaluated for
transfer credit, according to Col. Richard H. Mackey.
Mackey, the fourth region commander of the U.S.
Army Cadet Command, finalized the agreement — al
ready signed by Provost Condoleezza Rice in January —
with his signature last week.
Stanford will not have its own ROTC unit, but will
function as a host for Santa Clara University's Army
ROTC program. The agreement also stipulates that de
scriptions of ROTC classes be provided in the Stanford
Bulletin and that ROTC courses be individually re
viewed in order to determine possible transfer credit.
Mackey's signature completed the contract between
Santa Clara University, Stanford and the Army ROTC.
The agreement was also signed by Santa Clara Univer
sity president Paul Locatelli and Lt. Col. Robert Reed,
chair of the department of military science at Santa
Clara University.
According to Reed, two Army ROTC courses will be
offered on campus beginning next fall. Reed added that
offering ROTC classes in the spring would have been
premature.
University Registrar Roger Printup stressed that the
contract is not a change in Stanford's policy but was
only a renewal of a previously existing agreement be
tween Santa Clara and Stanford. Printup added that
ROTC has taught classes on campus before. Since 1970,
however, the University has only awarded transfer
credit for one Navy ROTC class.
"The old agreement had expired," Printup said. "We
were proceeding as if it were still in effect."
Mackey agreed, saying that his signing of the con
tract merely "formalized an agreement which was al
ready in place."
"The agreement had existed in the past but had been
allowed to lapse," Mackey said.
However, expanded Bulletin listings and possibly in
creased opportunities for transfer credit are changes in
Stanford's previous attitude toward ROTC programs.
"In the course of renewing the agreement, we dis
cussed a number of things, such as different ways that
Stanford could participate in the ROTC program,"
Printup said. "This is not a huge, monstrous change."
Description of the ROTC program in the Stanford
Bulletin will now list all courses offered by the Army,
Navy and Air Force ROTC programs, including those
offered at other campuses. The descriptions will take up
"two pages maximum" in the Bulletin, Printup said.
"The ROTC program is an opportunity available to
Stanford students. [In the Bulletin] we would be giving
students an understanding of their options," Printup
said. "We haven't provided good information [on ROTC
programs] for 20 years," he added.
Because they are not Stanford classes, however,
ROTC courses will not be listed in the time schedule.
The University will also re-evaluate all Army ROTC
courses to determine whether they may be approved for
transfer credit. ROTC classes will be treated as any
other class submitted for credit from Santa Clara Uni
versity, Printup said.
Transfer credit for classes is determined on the basis
of whether a class comparable to it is offered at Stanford,
Printup explained.
According to the registrar, the lack of comparability
between ROTC and Stanford classes is responsible for
the lack of credit awarded to ROTC classes. However, he
added that they are "worth another review" because it
has been years since the University evaluated ROTC
classes.
