Thirty new fruit trees will take
root in the Stanford Community
Farm project today, courtesy of
Magic Inc., a Palo Alto nonprofit
organization.
Magic has been under contract
with the University for the past 10
years to regenerate native plants
on campus, especially oak trees.
The group has grown and main
tained thousands of trees in the
foothills on campus and in the Ar
boretum between the Main Quad
and El Camino Road.
Senior Brian Halweil, head of
the Stanford Community Farm
project, and others will be planting
trees salvaged by Magic for the en
tire day. The farm is located be
hind the Environmental Health
and Safety Facility along
Sears ville Road.
Planting trees "is something
that will ensure the perennial na
ture of the farm," Halweil said.
Halweil also mentioned that be
cause the soil in the field allocated
to the farm is rather poor, a host of
compost crops will be planted
next. This will create carbon root
matter which can then be used to
enrich the soil.
"Right now the emphasis is on

improving soil," Halweil said.
"There's a lot of clay (in the soil),
which makes for poorly developed
roots and plants."
Magic has also assisted many
other California organizations in
starting projects. These organiza
tions include a Marin County
group called Marin Releaf, sum
mer camps and other nonprofit or
ganizations in Southern Califor
nia and the Central Valley.
Volunteers will distribute
2,500 trees to Bay Area schools
today as part of a yearly program
to salvage surplus fruit trees and
educate students about ecology.
Members of Magic live in a resi
dential community in Palo Alto,
where they work to "demonstrate
how people can use the methods
and principles of ecology to make
life better," according to member
David Schrom. The group has
sponsored the "Fruition" project
every year since 1990, which
marked the 20th anniversary of
Earth Day.
"I think it's a wonderful idea to
get kids used to having trees — es
pecially fruit trees — in their
yards," said member and Stanford
alumna Joan Schwan.
Magic started the project after
discovering that farmers burned
surplus trees.
