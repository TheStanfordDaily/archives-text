Midwest flooding continues
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The huge Ohio
River rose to its highest crest in 30 years yester
day and forced more people from their homes,
even as smaller rivers upstream receded and
revealed acres of muck-covered destruction.
The flooding, which followed record down
pours Friday night to Sunday morning, had
forced thousands of people from their homes in
Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and West
Virginia and more were packing to leave.
State officials sent National Guardsmen to the
region and ordered 1 million sandbags in anticipa
tion of higher water later this week.
"It hasn't been this high in so long that the
weather service isn't sure what the changes in
river flow and flood control projects will do, so
we're preparing for the worst," Alden Taylor, an
Indiana state emergency official, said yesterday.

Clinton bans funds for cloning
WASHINGTON (AP) — Warning against "try
ing to play God," President Clinton yesterday
imposed a ban on federal funds for human cloning
experiments.
In issuing the directive, Clinton noted recent
breakthroughs in genetically reproducing animals
and said he does not believe federal funds should
be used for human cloning. Current restrictions
do not guarantee that result, he said.
Also, Clinton asked for a voluntary moratori
um on human cloning experiments in the United
States — at least until the legal and ethical issues
can be sorted out. Because privately funded scien
tists are not covered by Clinton's directive, he said
that only a voluntary moratorium would ensure
ethical issues are fully debated.
Clinton said he did not know of any human
cloning research financed by government funds.
