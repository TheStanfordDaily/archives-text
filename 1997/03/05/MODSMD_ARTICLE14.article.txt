# Budget amendment defeated
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a stinging setback for
Republicans, a proposed balanced-budget amend
ment to the Constitution was narrowly defeated in
the Senate yesterday at the hands of Democrats who
attacked it as a threat to Social Security.
The vote was 66-34, one shy of the two-thirds
needed to prevail. It marked the third year in a row
the GOP had failed to muster the support to pass a
cornerstone of its conservative agenda.
Republican frustration was evident in the
moments before the vote, when GOP Sen. Orrin
Hatch repeatedly accused Democrats of "dema
goguery" when it came to Social Security.
In a fiery floor speech, Hatch, the Judiciary Com
mittee chairman, said Democrats "don't want to
cast the right vote" to force an end to nearly three
decades of nonstop deficits.
But Democrats had long since made up their minds.
Social Security "is the most successful social pro
gram in the history of the world," said Senate Demo
cratic leader Tom Daschle. "For millions of older

Americans it is the difference between living in dig
nity and living in fear and poverty. A balanced-bud
get amendment shouldn't force us to break that his
toric contract."
The measure would require a balanced budget
by 2002 and every year thereafter, unless three
fifths of the House and Senate vote otherwise.
Exceptions could be made in cases of war or other
military conflict.
Passage by a two-thirds majority was needed to
send the measure to the House, where the amend
ment has stalled. Approval there would submit it to
the states for ratification.
Republicans have sought its approval for years,
and made it a cornerstone of their conservative rev
olution when they took control of Congress two
years ago.
A similar amendment cleared the House in 1995
but failed to pass in the Senate when then-Sen.
Mark Hatfield of Oregon became the only Republi
can to oppose the measure.
