The University owes
a justification for locking
students into its services

The university tells
students to do many
things. It tells us which
surveys to fill out, when we can
take our weekend meal, even how
we should act toward our neigh
bors (see the Fundamental Stan
dard). But sometimes, even in our
haste to write that paper or study
for that test, we want to be told
more than the which, when and
how. Sometimes we want to know
why. And when it comes to the
service monopolies on campus,
this question is rarely satisfied.
Although these monopolies,
which include Student Communi
cations Services, Stanford Televi
sion and University Dining Ser
vices, reach into every aspect of
our lives, it is not wholly clear
why these monopolies exist.
Because none of these enterprises
are designed to make a profit,
competition isn't restricted to
boost their bottom lines. Yet there
must be a reason — and probably
several of them — why students
are not allowed to eat their own
meals or speak on their own tele
phones without buying into each
service's plans.
These reasons, of course, are
not automatically insidious. In
fact, some of the Stanford monop
olies appear to benefit the majori
ty of most students.
Take, for example, the Stanford
telephone system, which provides
local and long-distance telephone
service to all students in University
housing. Their rates are consistent
ly lower — by more than 50 per
cent, in most cases — than those
advertised by such national tele
phone companies as AT&T, MCI
and Sprint. Last year, Communica
tions Services found that students
were making so many calls that it

decided to cut their customers'
rates by almost 20 percent.
Granted, because students
must subscribe to this service,
they are unable to seek out compa
nies that may provide lower rates
for some international calls. This
is unfortunate, but lumping stu
dents under one plan saves a lot of
money for nearly everyone. Never
theless, is there any way — either
through new technology or
through a change in rules — that
students could be given more free
dom in their choice of companies?
If there is, we would like to know
how. If not, we want to know why.
Although the telephone
monopoly makes sense, the other
monopolies are not as fortunate.
Why is it necessary for under
graduates who live in campus hous
ing — and that's nearly all of them
— to purchase board plans from
Dining Services, not just for their
freshman years but for all four
years? Everyone has different
schedules and different prefer
ences, so it is not readily compre
hensible why students can't have
more choice with their meal money.
Why are dorms and Row houses
unable to get cable television in
their common rooms? Even if they
want to pay for it, they can't get
anything more than the broadcast
channels and a few random cable
channels. Moreover, why is it nec
essary for students to subscribe to
cable to get even the broadcast
channels in their rooms while at
the same time they are not per
mitted to install antennas?
These questions could be
answered, perhaps even for good,
if the administrators of these ser
vices informed the students in a
direct and simple fashion. With all
the information we receive at the
beginning of the year, why not
include an explanation detailing
the reasons for each monopoly's
existence? Why not justify our
lack of choice in one concise state
ment which shows both the bene
fits and costs of a service
monopoly? Why not?
