Shen, Thompson deliver as student representatives

IN YESTERDAY'S EDITORIAL call
ing for "true representation," The
Daily made a critical error in inter
preting the efforts of the ASSU.
To my understanding the ASSU Pres
ident's Office has put the highest priority
on the same issue everyone at Stanford
values most: the quality of our educa
tion. Representation on issues such as
the post office, quality of dining services
and the per-capita number of Stairmas
ters is all well and good, but it is not
what we are spending $30,000 for. We
want the best education that money can
buy. Improving the quality of our educa
tion is something that we all agree is
important. On this point, ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen and Vice President Nick

Thompson couldn't be representing stu
dent interests better.
When I voted for Shen and Thompson
I was signing on to an idea of real change
that went beyond making our "country
club" a little cozier. If people voted on
just name recognition and not on the
issues, they certainly got more than they
bargained for. And as far as Thompson's
"personal interests," I am willing to
guess he would rather be out playing his
guitar than wrestling with a reluctant
University administration over such pro
found issues as investment responsibility
and educational integrity.
As far as the interest in socially
responsible investing, I would say there
is strong student interest. When more

than 1,000 students sign a petition and
give hundreds of dollars towards a cause
I would not classify it as lacking support.
The next time The Daily wants to
accuse the ASSU's current leadership of
simply giving "the impression of listen
ing" and then go on to describe the fail
ures of a planned event designed to elicit
response from students, they should wait
until after the event occurs. The ASSU's
"Cookies and Tea" was a phenomenal
success with more than 120 students and
administrators in attendance. A range of
issues were raised, not by ASSU leaders
but by the students themselves.
If "any other day" consists of dealing
with such relevant issues as socially
responsible investing, public service

minors and a range of issues relating to
the quality of education at Stanford and
at universities across the country, I have
to disagree with The Daily and say that I
am not too disappointed with today being
like any other day.
Shen and Thompson have set out on
an ambitious journey that both chal
lenges the norms of student government
and the educational institutions of this
country. I am confident that they are
very much in tune with the real issues
that challenge students today. And if, as
students, we disagree with their priori
ties, it is our responsibility to let them
know.
