# Arrillage doesn't serve the amateur athlete
## 
### 
I agree in large part with Phil Delio
and Mark Oldman's Feb. 24 letter
about the pitiful state of the equipment
in the Arrillaga Weight Room. Appar
ently that is all that tuition (up another
4 percent next year) will buy. There is
another vexing problem that afflicts
that facility.
In The Guide to the Good Life, refer
ence is made to "the very limited hours
of access" at the Arrillaga Weight Room
(p. 30). We could have all the well
maintained and up-to-date equipment
in the world, but, if they won't open the
place to the public, the public is in no
position to take advantage of it.
At present they open at noon to a
long line and close again at 2 p.m. This
ill serves the staff who only have an
hour for lunch and who are repeatedly
faced with delays at the most popular
machines. The facility opens again at
5:30 p.m., once more to long lines and
crowded machines. This time it is the
students who are inconvenienced since

the late opening interferes with supper
in their residences.
This problem has been repeatedly
brought to the attention of the powers
that be in the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation. As
a result of long efforts by the faculty
oversight committee for the depart
ment, the hours of recreational access
have been extended by a mere one hour
per week (a half-hour on Tuesdays and
Thursdays).
The equipment is lousy and access is
limited because recreational athletics is
seen as no more than a mere bother by
the department. As far as recreational
athletics is concerned, there is nobody
home there. Athletic Director Ted
Leland owes it to the Stanford commu
nity to explain where the true amateur
athlete fits into his scheme of things,
and just who will see to it that this
shabby treatment will cease.
After all, there are many more recre
ational athletes than there are varsity
athletes, and what we do is just as
important.
