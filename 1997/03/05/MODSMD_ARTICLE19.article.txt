Reading about the elaborate delibera
tions over the shape and contents of the
proposed Introduction to the Humani
ties course, I thought, borrowing from
T.S. Eliot: "Come off it, colleagues" and
"Are we then so serious?"
First humanities are by definition
hard to define, which is why, unlike more
practical subjects, they are the core of
any true university: generally, roundly,
openly, fully human. So just relax. Close
your eyes and pick great books off the
top of your putatively well-read mind.
Remember that your students will be
various and also hard to categorize and
serve individually. And remember the
honest student of Western Culture (I
taught a section, but not hers) who told
me: "I didn't read any of those books
and got an A." So keep a sense of humor
and proportion, dear colleagues, and
plunge in, giving them the very best
books and reading you can come up

with. Forget method or critical theory.
As a sophomore at the University of
Virginia, before the big war I got pulled
into, I took a seminar on three novels,
"The Brothers Karamazov," "The Magic
Mountain" and "Ulysses," taught by an
engaging, cultured and enthusiastic
young philosophy professor. I was
bowled over by the masterpieces. They
molded and inspired my life work.
The ethnic extraction of those writers
(one Russian, another German, the third
Irish) was of no real interest to me. Nor
the fact that none was Jewish, as I am
(although anti-Semitism was ferocious
in my time). Nor would it have mattered
to me in the least if one had been a
woman, say George Eliot or Virginia
Woolf. All that mattered was their
genius, the enthusiasm of my teacher
and my eagerness. But every professor of
a certain age knows what I am referring
to. Only they usually choose silence.
I feel truly sorry for the kids at Stan
ford who have been deprived of that pas
sionate and disinterested kind of learn
ing. I doubt that anything can ever make
up for it.
