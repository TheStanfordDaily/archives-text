## An elegy to the cigarette 
### 
I'LL NEVER FORGET the first time
I walked into the Coffee House. It
was my very first day at Stanford,
and ignorant frosh that I was, I sat
down and lit a cigarette.
Of course I realized my mistake in a
second — all eyes turned to me as if I
was the anti-Christ come to blight the
pristine cappuccino air. I was amazed,
stupefied and dumbfounded to find "No
Smoking" signs blaring out of every
restaurant window in the entire state.
Even Denny's is off limits.
I realize that I may get lynched for
writing in praise of smoking at a time
and place when the practice inspires
such repression, and I certainly don't
take issue with the public health man
date against it. Smoking kills more
women than alcohol, illicit drugs, car
accidents, suicide and homicide com
bined. Cigarette smoke contains
(among other things) butane, carbon
monoxide, formaldehyde, methane,
nitrous oxide and arsenic. Tobacco is
the only legal substance that is lethal
when used as directed.
And yet millions of people smoke,
and have smoked, since the end of the
16th century, when tobacco was first
introduced to Europe, and long before.
People smoked Duke of Durhams, Old
Golds, Kools, Marlboros and Mistys.
People rolled their own. People smoked
even before Philip Morris, Joe Camel
and Virginia Slim told them to. Why?

The reasons, the irrational, now-for
gotten reasons why people smoke, are
what I want to resurrect for you here.
Not out of any malicious wish to
encourage a bad habit but out of a cer
tain respect for a cultural practice that
is dying and deserves a funeral.
Let's call it an elegy to the cigarette.
First and foremost there is the sheer
physical pleasure of smoking. The fire,
the smoke, a deep inhalation of nicotine
and mortality. That rich cigarette smell
on your clothes and in your hair.
Taking a smoke break is an excuse to
take a time out with yourself or with
friends to share a ritual. It's stealing a
cool minute or two simply to think,
relax and buzz.
There exists an instant camaraderie
between smokers, especially at Stanford
where they're an endangered species. I
can't tell you how many people I've met,
how many conversations I've had with
people asking to bum a cigarette or a
light. I've had entire friendships that
revolved around a few minutes out on
the balcony for an after-dinner smoke.
There's a whole language, a history, an
entire set of experiences that smokers
share, somewhat like being from the
same town.
As cliched as it might be, smoking is
passion and danger, right from the first
noxious puff. It's jazz; it's driving fast;
it's a sensuous, buttery moon. It's the
illusion that we can enjoy our lives right

now, not later — not after my paper is
done and my bills are paid and all the
other equally noxious tasks that succeed
each other, hour after hour, as identical
and unmysterious as paper clips.
Smoking is dirty. It's a silent daily
protest against an increasingly antisep
tic, paper-clip world. To me, its demise
parallels the death of seedy motels
(replaced by chain gigs like Comfort
Inn), cooking with real butter and free
love (we should've known it wouldn't
last). •>
I am writing this as an elegy because
smoking is dying, but also because I
have quit smoking. I haven't touched a
cigarette for nearly a year. (Well ...
maybe I did once or twice.)
To deal with the loss — not just the
physical but the spiritual loss — I have
taken of late to appreciating smoking
on purely aesthetic grounds.
Smoking is beautiful, pleasurable,
stirring. Like a painting in a museum —
I can't touch, but I can look. And I do. I
watch people who smoke. Sometimes I
take a surreptitious second-hand drag. I
remember.
