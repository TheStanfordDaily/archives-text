# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Democracy in action: ASSU elections rear their ugly head 
### 
AH, IT'S THAT time of the year
again. The birds are chirping, the
sun is smiling and White Plaza has
become the clipboard capital of the Bay
Area. Yes, that's right — the petitioners
for ASSU special fees have come out of
hibernation. Let the races begin.
I love the special-fee system. I really do.
It demonstrates the wonderful democratic
process that our forefathers and foremoth
ers fought to bring forth to the forefront of
society. Democracy rests in the power of an
intelligent and informed electorate
expressing their viewpoints through the
power of petition and collective action.
Here's an excerpt from a White Plaza
interview I had with one such person:
Me: Hello, there, Mr. Member of the
Informed Electorate. Would you mind if
asked you a question?
Mr. Member of the Informed Elec
torate: You don't want me to sign
another damn petition, do you?
Me: No, of course not. I'm just a lowly
columnist, and I was wondering what
petition it was that you just signed.
Mr. MIE: Umm, I dunno. I just kinda
signed.
Democracy in action, I love it! Stan

ford University — land of the free, home
of the ASSU! It is the will of the people
that puts special fees on the ballot, not
some heavy-handed paternalistic bureau
cracy. To get tens of thousands of dollars
in special fees, student groups need to go
through the difficult process of "convinc
ing" 2,000 Members of the Informed
Electorate to think hard and sign their
names on the dotted line. Who could
argue against the will of the people?
Me: Hello, there, Ms. Member of the
Informed Electorate. What are you sign
ing there?
Ms. MIE: It's a petition to overthrow
the despotic power of our government that
has trampled on individual rights for long
enough! Every American, regardless of
education or socio-economic status, should
have the right to walk down our nation's
streets and feel like they are part owners of
this brotherhood we call America!
Petitioner: Actually, we just race
solar cars.
Democracy in action, I love it! Once
2,000 have inked their names on a peti
tion, the ASSU engages in its rigorous
checks-and-balances system to "approve"
the requested monies and provide "legiti

macy" to their request by assuring
groups ask for appropriate amounts. Of
course, the ASSU senators who are doing
this approving and legitimizing were only
approved and legitimized by getting more
than 460 votes in last year's election.
That's just more than 7 percent of the
informed undergraduate electorate.
Of course, ASSU President Bill Shen
and Vice President Nick Thompson were
approved and legitimized by only about 6
percent of the informed electorate.
Democracy, I love it!
Me: Hey there, guy, I have a clipboard.
Want to sign this random petition?
Guy: OK.
Me: It's to put my tuition on the spe
cial-fee ballot.
Guy: OK.
Me: Hello? Weren't you even listening?
Guy: OK.
I have no problem with democracy. In
fact, I love it! The most beautiful and
poetic part of a democratic system is
that it protects the rights of the minori
ty from the will of the majority — and it
would be difficult to find someone to
argue that this is not a desirable state
for society. Democracy, however, has a

potentially disastrous outcome, as well:
It does nothing to protect the apathetic
from the socially active.
Now, before those of you actually write
letters decide to actually write letters,
understand that I'm not saying that this
is an undesirable consequence — it is sim
ply a logical result of the democratic sys
tem. If someone does not care to formu
late and express an opinion, then they
have no right to whine and complain
when things go wrong. And therefore it is
the active that should and will be heard.
The problem with the ASSU special
fee system is that it encompasses such a
small sample of the "informed electorate"
that the incredible numbers of apathetic
students severely skew any legitimacy the
system may have. In the past, groups that
have made it to the April ballot have often
failed to get even the minimum 15 per
cent of potential voters voting "yes"
required to have their votes counted. And
most other groups hover around this
ridiculously pitiful 15 percent mark.
How can we trust a system where any
one with a few clipboards and a ball-point
pen can get themselves on the ballot once
they are approved and legitimized by an

unaccountable group cf senato > that it
took just 9 percent approval to join? And
how can we trust, once groups are on the
ballot, approval by the student body
when, in many cases, these groups get
just about 8 percent of the vote?
But how can we complain if we are
apathetic and allow a few hundred people
to divide up the pot that we are all forced
to put money into at the beginning of
every quarter?
Here's my advice: Don't sign a petition
as you're running into Flicks or biking by
in White Plaza. Sign a petition after
you've stopped and asked the person
what it is they need money for and why
you should be the one to give it to them.
If students don't take control of the sys
tem, the system will take control of them.
So either sneak ud or auit complaining.

Jeremy Desman, a senior majoring in
public policy, was planning to graduate
this spring unless enough people write
in "Jeremy's tu. on" on the ballot. Any
takers ?
