## San Francisco Bay affected by January storms Freshening of saltwater causes environmental changes to estuary's ecosystem 
### Ellen Licking 
When heavy storms slammed into the West
Coast earlier this year, they caused massive
flooding and widespread damage in many coun
ties in Northern California.
Two months later sandbags no longer deco
rate area river beds, and levees damaged by high
run-off have been repaired. Despite the drier
weather conditions, though, some areas are still
experiencing the effects of January's rains. One
of these is the San Francisco Bay.
Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey esti
mate that the current amount of freshwater
entering the bay from the San Joaquin-Sacra
mento river delta is 10 times higher than nor
mal. Given the magnitude of the run-off, scien
tists at the Geological Survey and Stanford are
actively monitoring the Bay and its inhabitants
in order to understand how the ecosystem
responds to such large flows.
"Almost any aspect of the Bay you can think
of will be affected," explained Jim Cloern, a biol
ogist with the Geological Survey.
Because San Francisco Bay is an estuary,
the salinity percentage of the water varies with
location and time of year. Significant mixing of
salt and freshwater occurs at a point called the
interface. During the winter, freshwater from
the San Joaquin-Sacramento river delta enters
the bay and moves the fresh-salt water inter
face toward the Pacific Ocean.
In November, this interface was near the
source of the delta. Recent flooding has shifted
this interface 35 miles westward. The saline
level of the North Bay surface water is current
ly zero parts per thousand from San Pablo Bay
eastward, and the salinity at Angel Island is

only seven parts per thousand. "This is a signif
icant freshening of the system," Cloern said.
Salinity changes of this magnitude are a
shock to the ecosystem. Marine mussels, clams,
crabs and shrimp found in the benthos, the
muddy bottom zone of the estuary, will experi
ence osmotic stress due to the drop in salt con
centration in their environment.
Biologist Jan Thompson works with the Geo
logical Survey and studies the benthic clam
Potamocorbula amurenesis. She believes that a
short-scale die-off of marine organisms may
occur in pockets of the estuary.
Brian Cole, also a Geological Survey biolo
gist, speculated that the freshening of water in
the Bay might delay the development of the
typical summer community because animals
like the marine clam will not be able to invade
saltwater areas until later in the season. As a
result, Cole said, "these organisms may not be
able to establish themselves in their biological
niches this year."
Benthic organisms filter water and sedi
ments for nutrients. They are major consumers
of phytoplankton, the microscopic bacteria and
algae which form the foundation of the estu
ary's food web. By grazing on the phytoplank
ton, the clams and other small crustaceans help
control algal bloom formation.
Typically, blooms develop in the bay's shal
low waters during the spring, when a combi
nation of factors, including waste from sewage
treatment centers, provide the algae and bac
teria with a plentiful food source. If the benth
ic organisms fail to establish themselves early
in the spring, the grazing pressure they can
exert will be limited.
Cloern believes that there is a higher chance

that algal blooms will occur in both the north
and south parts of the Bay. In fact, on a recent
"flood cruise" in the southern part of the Bay,
he saw significant blooms in progress.
In addition to the osmotic stress caused by
the drop in salinity, Bay animals have also suf
fered significant mechanical stress due to the
sheer force of sediment and water moving
through the Bay.
The high levels of freshwater have flushed
the Bay of its phytoplankton. In addition,
fast-moving currents have propelled small
fishes, clams and zooplankton to different
regions of the Bay, displacing them from their
established niches.
The high sediment discharges caused by
January's storms have been exceptional,
according to Dave Schoelhamer, a Geological
Survey geologist.
"It has been phenomenal to watch this hap
pen" Schoelhamer said. "So much sediment was
moving through the system the water in the
Sacramento River looked like chocolate milk. At
the height of flooding, sediment was moving out
of the Bay at a rate of 1 billion pounds per day."
The impact of such high sediment flows on
the marine organisms is unclear. The current
ly muddy waters may interfere with the feed
ing efficiency of the benthic grazers. With
time, the sediment particles will also settle out
of solution. As the particulates fall to the bot
tom of the Bay, they may smother the small
crustaceans, mollusks, and marine inverte
brates that inhabit the benthos.

es endured by the bay's marine species appear

Francisco Bay. Recent storms and floods have caused a freshening
of the saltwater in the bay.
