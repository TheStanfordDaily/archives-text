# Halogens lamps not so bright an idea
## 
### Daniel Wan Editorial staff 
Since the conception of the
halogen torchiere in the early
1980s, it has rapidly become one
of the most popular lighting fix
tures in the world.
Yet concern over the safety
and efficiency of these residential
lights have caused Stanford's
Student Housing Services to
issue a halogen lamp safety alert
to all students living on campus.
Although halogen bulbs use
less energy than standard incan
descent bulbs, they're a lot hot
ter. The lamp surface can reach
temperatures of 800 to 1,200
degrees Fahrenheit while the
area right above the lamp can
reach temperatures of 600 to
800 degrees.
In comparison, paper ignites
at 340 degrees and cloth at 640
degrees. These lamps obviously
can pose a serious fire hazard.
"Using a halogen lamp is com
parable to keeping an open flame
in your bedroom or common
area," the alert reads. "The Con
sumer Product Safety Commis
sion has recorded over 100 fires
started by halogen lamps, and
these lamps have already started
two fires in Stanford housing."
The fire at England's Windsor
Castle in 1992 was partly caused
by a halogen lamp. An art restor
er was spraying a painting with
cleaning fluid when it acciden
tally came in contact with a 250-
watt halogen lamp, which imme
diately set a nearby curtain on
fire and caused more than $90
million in damage to three acres
of floor space.
Many universities have
banned halogen torchieres after
incidences of fire. In one case, a
fire started when someone tried
to dry a T-shirt or towel over the
bowl of the torchiere.
Draperies that are too close to
the lamp or the accumulation of
combustibles such as dead
insects in the bowl of a torchiere
can also cause fires to occur.
Halogen torchieres also con
sume large amounts of energy.
Using 300-, 500-, or even 600-
watt lamps, these fixtures have
significantly increased residen
tial energy use.

"The Housing Energy Con
servation Center has worked for
two decades to install high-effi
ciency lighting in Stanford
Housing. The increases in halo
gen torchiere use over the last
two or three years have offset
much of the efficiency gains of
the last 20," says David Frost,
housing management energy
coordinator.
America's 40 million halogen
torchieres are also affecting
energy consumption on a nation
al scale. It is estimated that
national halogen torchiere use
may be as high as 16 billion kil
lowatt hours.
If all the halogen torchieres
in the U.S. were replaced with
CFL torchieres, the annual
lighting bill would decrease by

more than $1.5 billion.
These fixtures are not partic
ularly efficient, either. Much of
the energy used is converted into
heat, not light.
At full power, a halogen lamp
produces an average of 10 to 15
lumens per watt. The lumen is a
unit of measure for the flow of
light. At one-third power, they
only produce an average of two to
three lumens. That is roughly
equivalent to the efficiency of
Thomas Edison's first prototype
light bulb, manufactured in 1879.

The use of halogen lamps also
affects the environment. If all
the halogen torchieres in the
U.S. were replaced with CFL
torchieres, annual carbon diox
ide production would decrease
by more than 11.5 million tons.
To further demonstrate the
wastefulness of energy incurred
by halogen torchieres, a few
illustrations are useful.
The energy used by one 300-
watt halogen lamp can power
about three Stanford outdoor
light posts. One 600-watt halo
gen lamp can power the lighting
of 10 standard Row-house
restrooms.
All of the halogen lamps used
in undergraduate housing alone
use enough power to light 20
Palm Drives.

Stanford is now implementing
an aggressive, seven-month pro
gram to phase out halogen lamps
in student housing while offering
an alternative lighting solution.
Student Housing Services has
been working with the Stanford
Utilities Department, Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory and
EMESS Lighting to produce a
new and safer lamp.
"The idea is to find a superior
alternative to halogens," said
Frost. "The new lamp's operat
ing temperature when on will be

about one-tenth that of typical
halogen lamps. The lamps will
be 20 percent brighter and use
one-fifth the energy of current
300-watt halogen lamps. Using
advanced compact fluorescent
technology, the bulbs will last
five times as long as halogens,
lasting up to seven years with
typical use. If a student buys a
lamp as a freshman, he or she
could finish coterming before
needing to relamp."
A fluorescent lamp is normal
ly a glass tube, coated on the
inside with a phosphor material
and filled with argon gas and a
small amount of mercury.
When voltage is applied
across the tube from the elec
trodes located each end, the cur
rent ionizes the mercury vapor.
This causes the emission of
ultraviolet light which causes
the phosphor coating to glow, or
fluoresce, consequently produc
ing visible light.
The color properties of the
lamp's light output are depen
dent on the exact composition of
the phosphor coating. The new
CFL lamps use rare earth phos
phor compounds that produce
visible light at the most sensitive
wavelengths of the eye's color
sensors. This produces better
color rendering and raises lumen
output.
The new lamps also have
improved electrical components
that make the lamp run at a
higher frequency, which con
serves energy.
A CFL torchiere could save
more than $250 in operating
costs over its seven year life and
reduce a . student's energy
expenses by $35 to $45 per year.
"Use of the CFL fixture will
lead to a safer residential envi
ronment at Stanford. There will
be a lower risk to lives and prop
erty from fire damage and water
damage, when the halogen
torchieres set off sprinkler sys
tems," said Frost.
In the spring, Student Housing
Services is planning to initiate a
testing program for its new lamps
in a limited number of undergrad
uate dorms. If proven effective,
the lamps will be made available
in local retail outlets, including
the Bookstore.

The typical halogen lamp reaches temperatures of 800 to 1,200
degrees Fahrenheit, generating enough heat to cook an egg.
