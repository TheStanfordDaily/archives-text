Geophysicist catches eruption before it starts

Using a network of data-coliecting stations placed
around Kilauea, Hawaii's most active volcano, Susan
Owen, a geophysics doctoral student, was able to
observe how the ground shifted during the opening of
a new volcanic rift on Jan. 30.
These data-collecting stations were set up by scien
tists from Stanford and the U.S. Geological Survey's
Hawaiian Volcano Observatorv. The stations use

readings from Global Positioning System satellites to pinpoint their
exact locations. As the ground shifts during a volcanic eruption, the
changes in position are measured and recorded. The recorded mea
surements are then sent to scientists like Owen, who works with
Assoc. Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall.
According to Owen, eight hours before the eruption, the ground
beneath Kilauea's Napau crater stretched almost eight inches
before cracking and forming a hot, bursting rift. After the forma
tion of the rift, the ground continued to expand by another six
inches. Based on her data, Owen believes that the stretching and
shifting was far more pronounced further beneath the surface. At
a depth of 1.5 miles, the pressure of hot magma may have caused
the rock to shift as much as 13 feet.
Although the data collected by the StanfordXJSGS stations was
unable to pinpoint the exact time of eruption, Owen said that the
new technology could aid in the study of other volcanoes, and even
tually, earthquake zones like the San Andreas fault running under
the Bay Area.
Fluctuations in food supply can cause crises

Rosamond Naylor and Walter Falcon, two
economists at Stanford's Institute for International
Studies, have warned that increased fluctuations in
food supply could lead to crises throughout the world.
According to their analysis, food shortages caused by
these fluctuations, which in turn are caused by several
environmental factors, could potentially destabilize
governments and lead to global unrest.

Naylor and Falcon wrote in the journal Population and Develop
ment Review that "annual weather fluctuations, longer-term climate
change, reductions in genetic diversity in the field, more synchro
nized patterns of planting and policy influences on management are
all plausible contributors to a pattern of incre;ised variability."
Naylor and Falcon worry that these fluctuations could lead to
political instability, particularly in developing nations. "Govern
ments have been thrown out of power based on the price of rice or the
price of bread," said Falcon.
However, shedding a more optimistic light on the issue, the
two economists agreed that food supply variability is not neces
sarily disastrous. Adjustments in international trade, number of
livestock and grain storage could help balance out the effects of
these fluctuations. â€” Rollin Hu
