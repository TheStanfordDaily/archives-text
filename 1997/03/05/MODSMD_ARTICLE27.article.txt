Q t How do lie detectors work ?

A. In ancient Greek mythology, there
• was a woman named Cassandra,
who was loved by the god Apollo. Apollo
promised her the gift of prophecy, on the
condition that she return his love.
Unfortunately, as in many Greek
myths, things went bad — I mean, what
do you say when an omnipotent being
says he loves you? "I'm feeding my gold
fish tonight" just doesn't work.
Because the gods had some kind of rule
against taking back promises, Apollo
decided the best way to get even was to
make it so that no one believed anything
Cassandra said. "Well, she was right about
the Fall of Troy and Agamemnon's death,
but the streak has got to end sometime." If
only they had a lie detector, or polygraph,
they wouldn't have been so surprised.

The first polygraph was invented in
1921 by John Larson. The machine mea
sured blood pressure, pulse and respira
tion; it was called the polygraph.
Later, another measurement was
added called galvanic skin response. Sup
posedly, when used by a skilled operator,
the polygraph is a highly accurate
method of detecting lies, although there
is much controversy over that point.
The polygraph measures various phys
iological factors to try and gauge the
stress level of a subject. It's probably
pretty obvious how blood pressure, pulse
and respiration change when you are
under stress, but you're probably won
dering what the galvanic skin response is.
To measure the galvanic skin response,
two metal plates are attached to the fingers
and the machine measures the electrical

conductivity of the skin. It's not as danger
ous as it 9ounds. It's not like they shock
you whenever they think you're lying —
the amount of current needed to determine
the conductivity of your skin is very small.
For most people, when they are under
stress, various systems in their body start
panicking and other things start going out
of whack. In particular, the sweat glands
in the skin are activated. When this hap
pens, the resistance of the skin goes down.
In a typical lie detector session, the
subject is asked pairs of questions, one
called the control question and the other
called the relevant question.
The control question is a question that
is supposed to make anyone nervous, no
matter what they have or have not done.
"Is two plus two equal to four?" is not
a good control question, unless the sub

ject has severe math anxiety. "Have you
ever stolen anything?" is better.
The relevant question is then a ques
tion which directly pertains to the fact
that the operator wants to know about.
The results of the control and relevant
question are then compared to see how the
measured stress levels of the two compare.
A result in which the control question
causes more anxiety than the relevant
question is interpreted as truthfulness,
whereas the opposite result is interpret
ed as lying. If enough lies come out dur
ing a session, then the test is considered
a positive result.
Other methods have also been devel
oped to increase the reliability of lie
detector tests. But in many jurisdictions,
polygraph examinations are still not
admissible in court.
