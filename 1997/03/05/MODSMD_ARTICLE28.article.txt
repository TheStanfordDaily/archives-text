# Knight Fellow writes about war-torn areas of the world
## 
### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
Anna Husarska crouched in front of a keyboard as
the blaring of bullets mocked the steady sound of her
typing. The faint glimmer of the computer screen —
the sole source of light — illuminated the small Sara
jevan room where she stayed.
By choice, Husarska, a journalist, forgoes hotel
rooms — with a comfortable bed and porcelain bath
tub — for a water-bottle shower and a "worms-eye
view" of the war-plagued nation.
Currently a Knight Fellow at Stanford and a staff
writer for The New Yorker, Husarska will speak
about the last six years of her life as a journalist in
Bosnia tomorrow evening in Tresidder Union, Oak
Room.
Through her numerous articles, Husarska said she
acts as a "voice" for those who don't normally have
one.
"I'm not reporting on warfare; I'm reporting on
human rights and human lives," she said. "When the
coup was happening in Russia, CNN was covering it
indirectly, and I wrote an article of how my friends
saw from their kitchens what was happening. . . .
They were lost."
Husarska said journalism "picked" her when she
was working as a logistics officer for the human rights
organization Doctors of the World, where she dealt
with refugees, prisoners and victims of civil war.
"There was just too much misery around," she
said, adding that she began writing for The Buenos
Aires Herald in Argentina. "I wanted to tell as many
people as 1 could what was happening — outrageous
human right violations."
In 1979, Husarska published her first article about
shopping under communism in Poland. Since then,
she has traveled to more than 30 countries and has
covered about a dozen civil wars.
Husarska described her biggest accomplishment
as "staying alive."

"When you see little clouds of dust rising all
around you ... you know they're shooting at you,"
Husarska said, adding however, that she is more
afraid of "thugs" than bullets. "Those brutal thugs
tell me that all journalists lie, and they are going to
settle their account with the world's media by beat
ing me."
While other journalists stay in hotels, Husarska
travels without a set bank account, "bums meals"
from locals and hitchhikes to needed destinations.
Her main attempt is to blend in with the local popula
tion.
"I don't believe you can write about Sarajevo —
[which is] without water, electricity and gas — from a
hotel room that has water, electricity and gas," she
said. "If you only stay in hotels and drive in taxis,
[then] you have quotes from hotel Iworkers] and taxi
drivers."
She added that because of her attempt to blend into
the community, a country made up of primarily a dif
ferent race can prove an obstacle.
"I like the people to forget that I am a
foreigner / outsider," she said, adding that the prob
lem with reporting in Somalia, Haiti or Algeria is that
she is "inevitably the 'white' around."
"It has nothing to do with not liking them; it is not
being one of them [that is the problem]. I stick out,"
she said.
Husarska will leave Stanford next week for Poland,
where she is covering a story for The New Yorker. She
is then traveling to Iraq for a story for The New Re
public. Finally, she will settle in Sarajevo.
"There is a lot to write from Bosnia," she said,
adding that she wishes she didn't have such a field of
opportunity there. "Since I cover human rights (vio
lations), I'd like to be left jobless."
Husarska said journalism is "not a profession" but
a "style of life."
"Journalism the way I do it is like riding a bike — if
you stop, you fall," she said. "Even if I lose everything
tomorrow, I've lived an interesting life."
