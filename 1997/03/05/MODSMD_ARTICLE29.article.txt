## Baseball wins a marathon in 12 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
The No. 6 Stanford baseball
team must love the game
because they can't seem to get
enough of it with only nine
innings.
For the second time in three
games, the Cardinal (16-6) bat
tled 12 innings to earn a victory.
Yesterday's 8-7 win came
against the San Francisco Dons
(8-9).
In a bizarre game that saw
three rundowns, 23 hits, 20
walks (15 issued by Dons pitch
ers), 13 pitchers, 29 men left on
base (20 by Stanford) and a shat
tered light, it is no wonder the
game ended just a minute before
midnight.
Stanford scored in the bottom
of the second inning on sopho
more designated hitter Tony
Schrager's solo home run. After
being sidelined with an injury
Feb. 11 against Nevada, Schrager
blasted the first pitch he had seen
in three weeks over the left-field
scoreboard.
With Stanford trailing 6-2 in
the sixth inning, Dons pitcher
Rich Igou gave up three walks in
a row to freshman right fielder
Edmund Muth, sophomore cen
ter fielder Jody Gerut and fresh
man left fielder Nick Day.
Sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang drove Igou's pitch
up the middle for a two-RBI sin
gle. Igou proceeded to walk in
another run for the Cardinal,
closing the gap to 6-5.
The Dons added a run in the
top of the ninth inning, extend
ing their lead to 7-5. Day made a
stellar backhanded diving catch
with the bases loaded for the
third out, keeping at least two

more runs from scoring.
The Cardinal tied the game
at 7-7 in the bottom of the
ninth. Junior shortstop Jay
Pecci led off the inning with a
walk, and junior Joe Kilburg fol
lowed with a single. With one
out, Gerut hit what appeared to
be a routine ground ball, but
Dons second baseman Troy
Nakamura booted the ball,
allowing Stanford to load the
bases. Freshman John Gall bat
tled with Don reliever Ray
Rivera (2-3) for eight pitches,
finally drawing a walk and scor
ing Pecci. Day followed with a
sacrifice fly, scoring Kilburg
and tying the game.
The Card was unable to push
across the winning run until the
bottom of the 12th inning.
Hochgesang led off the frame
with a triple to center field and
was driven in on a sacrifice fly by
fresnman pinch hitter Joe Savig,
who made his second plate
appearance of the year.
"This was another great win
for us," Hochgesang said. "It
really shows our character."
Picking up the win for Stan
ford was sophomore Cameron
Newton (1-0), who held the
Dons scoreless in the 12th
inning. Newton's off-speed
pitches shut down the Dons,
who had just faced sophomore
lefty Tony Cogan's heat for four
innings. Freshman Geoff
Linville made his first career
appearance and pitched the first
two innings for Stanford.
"It was good to get Newton
the win,": said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "It was a
good come-from-behind win, and
I was very pleased with it."
