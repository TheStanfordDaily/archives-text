# Book-buying alternative
## SMOC enlists support of two ASSU projects 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
The Stanford Store and the Virtual Direc
tory have joined forces with Stop Monopolies
on Campus to provide students with an alter
native to buying used books at the Bookstore.
SMOC is a student group founded last
quarter by juniors Danny Bramzon and Hus
sein Kanji to protest what they viewed as a
monopoly on book sales by the Bookstore.
Last quarter, SMOC created controversy
and drew attention to its activities by holding
a used book fair on the steps of the Bookstore.
After discussion with SMOC leaders, the
Bookstore decided to allow the group to con
duct activities on its steps.
According to Bramzon, "SMOC is no
longer as much protest-oriented as it is stu
dent service-oriented."
Hanie Fayegh, the course materials and
Microdisc manager at the Bookstore, said,
"The last time we met with SMOC was sever
al months ago." He added that the Bookstore

did not know of the new developments with
SMOC.
"It's unfortunate he didn't come to us
If [Bramzon] has an issue, he should call us.
He's talked enough with the Bookstore to
know who to talk to," said Fayegh.
Bramzon said there was no reason to go
back to the Bookstore because SMOC was no
longer protesting its actions. The group is now
providing an alternative service that students
could choose.
The partnerships of SMOC with the Stan
ford Store and Virtual Directory, respectively,
are separate, but both are aimed at helping the
students, said Bramzon.
In working with SMOC, the Stanford Store
will be buying back and selling textbooks "for
at least 10 percent more and less than the
Bookstore," respectively, Bramzon said.
Freshman Justin Mills, SMOC director of
the Stanford Store project, said, "Our intent is
to target a few select classes ... to be outside
the doors on the last day of classes to
buy books and be outside the doors
on the first day of [spring quarter]
classes" to sell books to students.
"Our goal is to publicize the book
project, make it a big deal and save
the students some cash. ... No
body needs to get rich off recirculat
ing books through campus. It is
done by the students and for the
students," said senior Don Cole
man, projects director of Stanford
Student Enterprises.

The Stanford Store provided
the capital and advertising for the
operation, while SMOC provided
the idea and the manpower, said
Mills.
"If everything keeps going the
way it is, [the operation] will be
ready for the end of this quarter,"
Mills added.
The partnership of SMOC with
the Virtual Directory will allow an
online, searchable database of avail
able books. The database will also
allow students to add books to it. A
working prototype will be online by
the beginning of next quarter, said
Bramzon.
In addition, the used book fair,

originated by SMOC, will be held
under the Virtual Directory big tent
next quarter rather than at the desk
at which it was held this quarter in
White Plaza
"We will help students save
money, and hopefully that will cre
ate tremendous publicity," said
Bramzon. "We're spreading and be
coming more permanent, and I
hope to expand our services."
ASSU Financial Manager John
Hall said, "SSE is excited to be
helping student projects get off the
ground. It's a good example of SSE
and independent students work
ing together to improve quality of
life on campus."
