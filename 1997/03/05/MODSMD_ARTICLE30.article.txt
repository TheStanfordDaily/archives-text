# Spikers to challenge Loyola-Chicago
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The No. 3 ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team will square off against the Ram
blers of Loyola-Chicago from the Midwest
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association at 7
tonight at Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal (9-2) is hot coming off of
this weekend's victories over USC Friday
and Long Beach State Saturday. The team
will look to continue its winning ways at
home, where it has posted a 4-0 mark this
year. The Ramblers, looking to end the
streak, are a virtual unknown to the Stan
ford coaches.
Assistant coach John Kosty "is going to go
see them play tonight at UOP, and we will
come up with a plan for the match based on
what he sees," said head coach Ruben

Nieves. "All T know is that they have had a
couple of close matches with some of the
stronger teams in the Midwest, teams that
gave us good matches earlier in the year."
Specifically, the Ramblers have lost to
conference foes Ohio State in five games 12-
15, 15-2, 15-9, 12-15, 15-11 and Indiana-
Purdue-Fort Wayne 11-15, 15-13, 14-16, 15-
6, 15-12. Although Stanford has already
defeated both teams this year, the No. 13
Dons and the No. 14 Buckeyes did give the
Card a challenge.
On paper, it looks like Stanford will want
to stop Dan Schultz, the Ramblers' top hit
ter at .363, and their overall leader in
attempts, kills, digs, solo blocks and kills per
game, at 5.15. Other than Schultz, the Ram
blers do not appear to have another signifi
cant offensive threat.
The main reason that the Ramblers are

on the schedule, aside from giving Stanford
what should be a relatively easy win, is to
provide the Cardinal with the opportunity to
play teams outside of its region. Nieves cited
a team's ability to dominate outside of its
region as one of the major criteria that the
NCAA selection committee looks at in decid
ing who will go to the Final Four.
If Stanford does not win the season-end
ing tournament in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, which would guarantee
the Cardinal one of the three regional bids to
the Final Four, it would have to rely on the
at-large bid. A strong nonconference record
would encourage the NCAA officials to select
Stanford over a team from another region.
Budgetary concerns make it difficult for
Stanford to travel extensively out of the
MPSF. For example, the Cardi
nal's participation in the NCAA

Preview Tournament earlier
this year in Columbus, Ohio,
was funded by Ohio State and
did not come out of Stanford's
pocket. As a result, Stanford
must seize the opportunity to
play teams whenever they travel

out this way. For these reasons,
Stanford will play yet another
Midwest team next week, the
Cardinals of Ball State.
Regardless of the relative
mystery that surrounds the
Ramblers, the team is ready to

play.
"The guys are excited to get to
play Loyola," Nieves said. "We
don't get to play to many teams
outside the MPSF, and it is great
that we get to play them at
home."
