Freshman all-arounder Larissa Fontaine guided the Car
dinal to a victory over No. 12 Oregon State and No. 19 Den
ver in Friday's Chili's Invitational held at Burnham Pavil
ion. Fontaine won the all-around event with a total score of
39.375, while demonstrating her versatility by scoring no
lower than 9.825 on each apparatus. Fontaine's perfor
mance helped the Card to 195.550 points, four more than
its nearest opponent. Fontaine was followed bysophomoro
teammates Amy Murakami and Tracey Kohl, who finished
second and third, respectively. "We've proved our consis
tency that we've been building on all year," Fontaine said.

Senior setter Stewart Chong earned player of the game
honors after an impressive all-around performance against
the Long Beach State 49ers Saturday. Chong gave the Car
dinal a boost early with his serving, helping Stanford move
out to a quick lead it would never relinquish. The 5-foot-10
Chong also proved his prowess on defense, as he turned the
49ers' offensive plans awry with his blocking at the net
Chong has successfully engineered a powerful Stanford
attack all season, and this weekend was no exception. With
Chong at the helm, the Card avenged an earlier loss to USC
before its pummeling of l>ong Beach State.
