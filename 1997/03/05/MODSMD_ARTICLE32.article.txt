### John Sullivan Staff writer 
With everything on the line at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships this weekend, the Stanford
wrestlers exceeded even their own expectations by fin
ishing with six place-winners and four NCAA quali
fiers. After a season of mixed performances and only
brief glimpses of great team wrestling, the Cardinal
pulled it together to finish seventh overall out of nine.
"I'm very happy with our performance," said coach
Chris Horpel. "Our guys rose to the occasion and wres
tled really well. We definitely won more than our fair
share of the close ones, which always makes a coach
happy."
In qualifying four wrestlers for NCAA Champi
onships later this month, Stanford matched its best
mark for NCAA qualifiers despite somewhat low
expectations because of injuries and inexperience.
Freshman Zach Zimmerer, one of Stanford's young
but rising stars, wrestled his way to a fourth-place,
NCAA-qualifying finish. The 126-pound Zimmerer
started things off by defeating Cal Poly-San Luis Obis
po's Gale Miller 10-5. The victory over Miller was a
first for Zimmerer and a tone-setter for the rest of his
tourney.
Zimmerer went on to the finals in the consolation
round where he lost a tight match in sudden-death
overtime to Oregon State's Jake Whitehurst. With the
match tied 2-2, Whitehurst was able to take Zimmerer
to his back, completing a five-point move that gave
Whitehurst the match 7-2 and gave Zimmerer a
fourth-place finish.
"I wrestled at Pac-lOs the best I have all season,"
Zimmerer said. "I finally put it all together."
Sophomore Beau Weiner provided some high drama
en route to an impressive third-place finish at 142
pounds Weiner cruised his way through the regular
draw into the semifinals, where he met Cal State-Bak
ersfield's Jason Ramstedder Although Ramstedder led
for much of the match, Weiner picked up the intensity
at the end, barely missing a pm attempt in the final sec
onds of the match.
In the consolation draw, Weiner met Arizona
State's Tracy Brown, who led 5-3
with just under 20 seconds remain
ing. Unlike the match against
Ramstedder, this time Weiner's
late-match effort was successful as
he took Brown to his back for a
five-point takedown.

In his match for third place,
Weiner met his archrival and for
mer UC-Davis teammate, Oliver
Salud. During the regular season,
Weiner and Salud split two close
matches and this match was also
very tight. However, 5 minutes, 16
seconds into the match Weiner was
able to pin Salud for the victory
and third place.
Junior Scott Chapman, ranked
No. 2 in the Pac-10 and No. 9 in the

nation at 167 pounds, began on an
off note by losing 4-3 in an unusu
al match but won the rest of his
matches to earn third place.
In his first match against Cal
State-Fullerton's Jason Webster,
Chapman fell behind 4-3 late in the
match but was about to score
points on a takedown move when
the timer called time with seven
seconds remaining in the match.
The clock had to be reset, and
Chapman was then unable to con
vert, losing 4-3.
In the consolation round, Chap
man major-decisioned his first
opponent from Oregon State and
avenged his pin loss to Cal State-
Bakersfield's Lionel Halsey earlier
this season by handily defeating
him 11-1. In the match for third
place, Chapman beat Oregon's
Greg Johnson 4-1.
Senior Bryan Vaniman proved
his wrestling superiority by finish
ing fourth at 190 pounds despite
not having wrestled for more than
two months because of a broken
index finger. Vaniman met the No.
1 seed in the regular bracket and
wrestled well, keeping the match
much closer than the 5-1 loss
might indicate.
In the consolation round, Vani
man pinned Bakersfield's Jeromy
Bridges 1:18 into the match to get
himself into the match for third
place. Vaniman wrestled well

against Cal Poly's Scott Adams but
lost a heartbreaker 4-3.
Other placewinners for the Car
dinal were freshman Tim Kendall
at 177 pounds and sophomore B.J.
Sanchez at 150 pounds, who both
took sixth place. Kendall wrestled
"just phenomenally" according to
Horpel as he pinned UC-Davis'
Mike Roper with 3:28 left to give
himself the opportunity to get into
a NCAA-qualifying match.
In his next match, Kendall fell
behind 5-4 against his Oregon
State opponent late in the match
but with 20 seconds to go had a
cross-leg cradle which he was
unable to capitalize on. In the
match for fifth place, Kendall was
unable to get things together and
took home a sixth-place finish.
By finishing sixth, Sanchez is
the second alternate at his weight
for NCAAs, which means that if
two wrestlers drop out he will com
pete. Sanchez's tourney matches
included a loss to the top seed, a 7-0
victory over an NCAA qualifier
from last year, a narrow 1-0 loss to
his Cal Poly rival Craig Welk and a
heartbreaker to Boise State's Larry
Quisel in the fifth-place match.
"B.J. was two close matches
away from qualifying for NCAA,"
Horpel said. "He is physically and
technically ready and will continue
to prepare for NCAAs in case he
gets the nod."
