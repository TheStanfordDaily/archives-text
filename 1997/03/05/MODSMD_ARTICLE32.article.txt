With everything on the line at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships this weekend, the Stanford
wrestlers exceeded even their own expectations by fin
ishing with six place-winners and four NCAA quali
fiers. After a season of mixed performances and only
brief glimpses of great team wrestling, the Cardinal
pulled it together to finish seventh overall out of nine.
"I'm very happy with our performance," said coach
Chris Horpel. "Our guys rose to the occasion and wres
tled really well. We definitely won more than our fair
share of the close ones, which always makes a coach
happy."
In qualifying four wrestlers for NCAA Champi
onships later this month, Stanford matched its best
mark for NCAA qualifiers despite somewhat low
expectations because of injuries and inexperience.
Freshman Zach Zimmerer, one of Stanford's young
but rising stars, wrestled his way to a fourth-place,
NCAA-qualifying finish. The 126-pound Zimmerer
started things off by defeating Cal Poly-San Luis Obis
po's Gale Miller 10-5. The victory over Miller was a
first for Zimmerer and a tone-setter for the rest of his
tourney.
Zimmerer went on to the finals in the consolation
round where he lost a tight match in sudden-death
overtime to Oregon State's Jake Whitehurst. With the
match tied 2-2, Whitehurst was able to take Zimmerer
to his back, completing a five-point move that gave
Whitehurst the match 7-2 and gave Zimmerer a
fourth-place finish.
"I wrestled at Pac-lOs the best I have all season,"
Zimmerer said. "I finally put it all together."
Sophomore Beau Weiner provided some high drama
en route to an impressive third-place finish at 142
pounds Weiner cruised his way through the regular
draw into the semifinals, where he met Cal State-Bak
ersfield's Jason Ramstedder Although Ramstedder led
for much of the match, Weiner picked up the intensity
at the end, barely missing a pm attempt in the final sec
