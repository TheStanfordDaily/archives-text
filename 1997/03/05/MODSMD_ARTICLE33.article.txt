# Men's tennis beats Oregon with ease
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
The top-ranked Cardinal
shot down the Ducks of Ore
gon yesterday in a 7-0 drub
bing at the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium. The Cardinal
now boasts an impressive 9-1
record in dual match play,
while the Ducks fall to 3-5.
Stanford appeared dazzling
yet businesslike as usual. Less
than three hours after the
matches started, the Card had
already disposed of the Ducks
in all nine matches, not drop
ping a single set along the
way.
"Coach made it sound like
it would be a lot harder than it
was today," said junior Misha
Palecek.
But for the Card, most of
the season has been a similar
story as Stanford has domi
nated in all of its home match
es so far this season.
Junior All-Amencan Paul
Goldstein is one of many rea
sons for the Card's domi
nance By taking out Oregon's

Carlos Navarro 6-3, 6-0, Gold
stein extended his dual-match
winning streak to nine.
Ryan Wolters has produced
outstanding results as well
thus far this season. The
sophomore Ail-American
defeated Dougal Williams 6-1,
6-3. Wolters extended his dual
match record to 6-1.
The easiest win of the day
went to Stanford freshman
Bob Bryan at the No. 3 posi
tion. He took down Oregon's
John DeVorss without drop
ping a single game 6-0, 6-0.
His brother Mike at the fourth
spot breezed past Oregon's
Joaquin Hamdan 6-2, 6-3.
Rounding out play for the
Card in singles was freshman
Geoff Abrams and junior
Charles Hoeveler at the No. 5
and No. 6 spots, respectively.
Abrams beat Oregon's Cedric
Van Haver 6-2, 6-4 while
Hoeveler, stepping in for
senior Grant Elliott at the
sixth position, breezed by
Mike Goldstein 6-2, 6-2.
Having just returned from
the 108 th annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships in La
Jolla, Calif., the Card displayed
its doubles practice by easily
beating the Ducks at all three
positions. Wolters and Gold
stein, who hold an impressive 7-
0 record in dual-match play for
doubles, took the day off as
Bryan and Bryan played the No.
1 spot. They beat Williams and
Navarro 8-3. Elliott and Abrams
played the No. 2 spot, taking out
Oregon's Goldstein and DeVorss
8-4.
Finishing out the lineup for
the card was Hoeveler and Pale
cek, who finished strong for the
Card with a solid drubbing of
Oregon's Chris Fylkesnes and
Van Haver 8-1.
Although their matches were
done for the day, the Card took
the courts again for some more
practice — two matches of play
were not enough.
"We need to get some more
balls in today," Palecek said.
Stanford takes the court again
Friday, when the team hosts
53rd-ranked SMU at 1:30 p.m.
at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium.
