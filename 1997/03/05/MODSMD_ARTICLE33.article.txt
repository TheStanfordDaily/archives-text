The top-ranked Cardinal
shot down the Ducks of Ore
gon yesterday in a 7-0 drub
bing at the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium. The Cardinal
now boasts an impressive 9-1
record in dual match play,
while the Ducks fall to 3-5.
Stanford appeared dazzling
yet businesslike as usual. Less
than three hours after the
matches started, the Card had
already disposed of the Ducks
in all nine matches, not drop
ping a single set along the
way.
"Coach made it sound like
it would be a lot harder than it
was today," said junior Misha
Palecek.
But for the Card, most of
the season has been a similar
story as Stanford has domi
nated in all of its home match
es so far this season.
Junior All-Amencan Paul
Goldstein is one of many rea
sons for the Card's domi
nance By taking out Oregon's

Carlos Navarro 6-3, 6-0, Gold
stein extended his dual-match
winning streak to nine.
Ryan Wolters has produced
outstanding results as well
thus far this season. The
sophomore Ail-American
defeated Dougal Williams 6-1,
6-3. Wolters extended his dual
match record to 6-1.
The easiest win of the day
went to Stanford freshman
Bob Bryan at the No. 3 posi
tion. He took down Oregon's
John DeVorss without drop
ping a single game 6-0, 6-0.
His brother Mike at the fourth
spot breezed past Oregon's
Joaquin Hamdan 6-2, 6-3.
Rounding out play for the
Card in singles was freshman
Geoff Abrams and junior
Charles Hoeveler at the No. 5
and No. 6 spots, respectively.
Abrams beat Oregon's Cedric
Van Haver 6-2, 6-4 while
Hoeveler, stepping in for
senior Grant Elliott at the
sixth position, breezed by
Mike Goldstein 6-2, 6-2.
