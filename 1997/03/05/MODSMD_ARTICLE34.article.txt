## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis bounced back from its
first loss of the season last week
end by crushing both No. 18 Cal
ifornia and No. 4 Texas at home
8-1
Both matches were clinched
in the singles competition for the
Cardinal (13-1 overall, 3-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion), who extended its confer
ence winning streak to 27 by
defeating the Bears Friday.
"I was very pleased with this
weekend," Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan said. "I told the
team that we needed to have a
bunch of matches like these
before we are of NCAA-title cal
iber."
Stanford took five of six sin
gles matches Sunday in beating
the Longhorns (5-2), the last
team to win at Stanford. Senior
co-captain Katie Schlukebir, the

seventh-ranked singles player in
the nation, clinched the win by
coming from behind for a three
set win in the No. 1 singles
match against No. 12 Cristina
Moros, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4
Moros took the first set in a
tiebreak and led the third set 3-0
before Schlukebir stormed back
for the win.
Schlukebir was not the only
Cardinal competitor who fought
back from behind. Fellow senior
Sandra De Silva also staged an
impressive third-set comeback in
order to give the Cardinal anoth
er win in the No. 3 match against
Longhorn Laura Berendt. Down
2-0 after dropping the second set,
De Silva regrouped for a 6-4. 3-6,
6-3 win.
In addition, junior co-captain
Julie Scott faced a 4-1 deficit in
the second set of her match
against Melody Falco but
refused to let Falco earn a split
by forcing a tie-breaker and win
ning 6-3, 7-6.
"That was great to see,"
Brennan said. "In our loss to
Florida, we lost all three three
set matches. Today we won two
out of two and won them the
hard way. When we had to have
it, they stepped up and said
OK."
Texas notched their only
point early, taking a 1-0 lead on
Sandy Sureephong's 6-2, 6-1 vic
tory over Stanford freshman
Anne Kremer in the No. 2
match.
Stanford quickly tied that up
on freshman Teryn Ashley's vic
tory in the No. 6 match against
Anne Pastor 6-1, 6-3. Ashley is
undefeated thus far in dual
match play. Junior Ail-Ameri
can Ania Bleszynski also won in
straight sets over Michelle
Faucher 6-4, 6-2.
The Cardinal did not let up in
doubles after clinching the win.
At No. 3, Kremer and Ashley
cruised to an 8-0 win over
Faucher and Falco. Schlukebir

and freshman Lilia Osterloh
also breezed past their oppo
nents, Berendt and Sureephong,
in the No. 2 match 8-2.
"The doubles looked real good
today," Brennan said. "Bleszyn
ski and Scott looked like a good
team again. I don't know who
those girls were on Friday. They
had our uniforms and they gave
them back today."
On the first court, Bleszynski
and Scott avenged for a poor
performance against Cal Friday
by upsetting the No. 1-ranked
team in the nation, Moros and
Farley Taylor 8-3.
Friday, the Bears (5-4, 1-2)
were no match for the Cardinal.
Stanford won all six singles
matches, five of them in straight
sets.
"It was nice not to have to
fool around with them and go
into one of those titanic strug
gles," Brennan said.
The doubles play mnrked the
dual-match debut of Osterloh,
who had been out with a shoul
der injury. The No.l-ranked
junior in the nation teamed with
Schlukebir for an 8-3 victory.
"My shoulder has been bet
ter, but it was pretty good,"
Osterloh said. "It wasn't sore. It

was good to be back. Hopefully,
I'll be back playing singles in the
next few weeks."
Brennan hopes to get Oster
loh into the lineup as early as
this week against either Boston
College, Washington or Wash
ington State, although he is not
sure exactly where she will play
in the lineup.
"Lilia was twice as sharp as
she was on Friday," Brennan
said. "She's got a long way to go,
but she was showing some good
stuff out there. No problem with
the shoulder so definitely next
week we'll get her in singles.
She's the national junior singles
and doubles champion, the No.
1-ranked junior in the country
and the No. 2-ranked junior in
the world. We'll find a spot for
her; I just don't know where."
As far as fitting Osterloh into
the lineup today against Boston
College, Brennan can afford to
mix up the starters a bit. The
Eagles will be no match for the
second-ranked Cardinal.
"It's nice to have seven play
ers," Brennan said. "We've had
someone injured all year so we
have needed that depth. Now
that everyone's healthy, we will
just give someone a rest today."
