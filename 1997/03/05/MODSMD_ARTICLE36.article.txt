# Rugby men to play Cal, women face Santa Cruz
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It may not be the first thing every
one thinks of when they hear the
phrase "Big Game," but matches don't
get much bigger than Sunday's show
down between Stanford and Califor
nia's rugby teams.
Cal, ranked first in the nation, has
perennially been a powerhouse on the
rugby field.
The Bears have always dominated
the series between the two rivals — at
least until last year.
That was when the Cardinal defeat
ed Cal at Berkeley 24-21, a feat that
had not been accomplished in 16 years.
The upset victory gave the Cardinal a
short stint as the top-ranked squad in
the nation before the Golden Bears
went on to win the national champi
onship.
This year's match, which takes place
at Maloney Field at 1 p.m., should
prove to be no less dramatic.
The scrummers have proven that
they are a force to be reckoned with
throughout early competition within
the league.
On Feb. 24, the men pulled them
selves up to second place in the nation
by defeating then-No. 2 UC-Davis 36-
24.
"I think preparation is very impor
tant and we'll be ready that way, but
the real game is going to be played in
the heart of the players," said head
coach Franck Boivert.
"They're going to have a lot of fire in
their hearts to counter Cal because Cal
is superior to us in size. But 15 players
with big, huge hearts can make a
tremendous difference and we're going
to count on that."
As a precursor to the men's match,
the women's team will take on league
rival UC-Santa Cruz at 11 a.m. at Mai

oney Field. When the two met on Feb. 1
at Santa Cruz, the Cardinal easily out
ran the Banana Slugs in a 32-0 shutout
victory.
The women have relied on their
speed throughout much of the season,
and this weekend will not be any differ
ent.
If the women wish to advance far
into the postseason, they will have to
continue to play an agile game in order
to compensate for their lack of size.
Against Occidental Sunday, they were
able to rout the Tigers with quick pass
ing and versatile play.
"From now on we're going to show
our versatility and our athletic ability
for the rest of the games," said fresh
man Karina Celaya.
"It's going to be a big factor in our
matches. We're going to be a really
competitive team as time goes on and
we gam experience.
"In the last game we played differ
ent positions, and it just showed how
we're not restricted to a certain type of
play."
Competition among the players for
game time has also helped improve the
team, Boivert said.
By playing against themselves, the
team has helped itself grow into a bet
ter contender.
That competition "brought out the
best in the team and therefore we'd like
to keep them on their toes like this,"
Boivert said.
"What also happened against Occi
dental College is that they really played
as a rugby team. They really had some
moments with good rugby reactions,
good rugby skill, and good improvisa
tions.
"They improvised a lot. They've
become real rugby players now, and
we'd like to see the team go in the same
direction for the game against UC-
Santa Cruz."
