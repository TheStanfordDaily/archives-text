# Ultimate finishes 2nd to UC-Santa Barbara

The Stanford men's Ultimate
Frisbee team is out to get revenge.
It didn't name itself La Familia
this year for nothing.
In this weekend's showdown,
the team was undefeated going
into the finals before falling to
archrival UC-Santa Barbara.
According to mafioso captain
Jim Schoettler, "No team gave us
a challenge until Santa Barbara."
In the quarterfinals, La Familia
easily defeated San Diego. In the
semifinals it defeated Santa Cruz
15-3.
After UC-Santa Barbara had
crushed the University of British
Columbia 15-8 in the semifinals,
the stage was set for a great cham
pionship contest.
In the championship match, La
Familia was ahead 9-6 at halftime.
Then, at the beginning of the sec
ond half, Santa Barbara gunned in
four points, causing La Familia to
fall behind. Finals matches end
when one team gets 17 points, but
the two teams found themselves
tied at 17-17. A decision was made
to cap the game at 19 points, much
to the regret of La Familia as
Santa Barbara scored the last two
points.
Schoettler explains that the
squad's loss in the final was due to
"mental mistakes which really
cost us in the stretch." The defeat
was especially harsh because it
occurred on La Familia's home
turf.
Fortunately, La Familia has

many opportunities coming up to
restore its honor. During spring
break the team has two tourna
ments — a club tournament in
San Diego and a tournament in
Santa Cruz. More important,
nationals will be held in May. La
Familia is pleased with the loca
tion of the tournament at UC-
Davis. Hopefully its proximity will
provide La Familia with local sup
port along with a relatively short
journey.
La Familia has set its eyes on
Santa Barbara as the team to beat.
Santa Barbara is the current
national champion, but as the
score of the final game shows and
sophomore mafioso Omer Ates
men says, "We know we have the
potential as well as the ability to
beat Santa Barbara." Other teams
contending for a championship
this year are Carleton, Madison
and East Carolina.
Despite losing the most recent
tournament, La Familia recently
won the Mardi Gras tournament,
in which it defeated a very good
Madison team in the finals.
Another thing going for La
Familia is that it has all of the
components of a good Ultimate
Frisbee team.
First, it has many good ath
letes. Second, the team members
have each other's loyalty and the
ability to work together as a unit.
Third, it has many skilled han
dlers and deep players. The Fami
ly should feel very confident about
Nationals, but can they win it all?
This demands a sequel.
