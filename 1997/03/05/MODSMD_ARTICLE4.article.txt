# Knight life at Stanford
## 
### Jennifer Chien 
Have you ever wanted to dress up as a
knight? Fight battles in full armor? Be a
queen for a day? Have you always wanted to
drink mead? Do you even know what mead
is?
If you answered yes to any of those, then
the Society for Creative Anachronism is the
organization for you.
"The culture is different from ours
enough that you can learn a lot and use your
imagination," said senior Thomas Willeke,
head of Stanford's branch. The society "at
tracts a different breed of people, adults who
still know how to play, who want to wear cos
tumes and run around and be silly."
Senior Bari Mandelbaum, who was intro
duced to the group by Willeke, said he eryoys
the society because it becomes a community
in and of itself.
Founded in 1964 at Berkeley, the society
has grown to more than 50,000 members na
tionwide, with people spread out among var
ious states and age groups. The society recre
ates authentic medieval society, from weav
ing and cooking to archery and fighting.
The society's introductory handbook
states that the purpose of the organization is
Jacqui Frank— Daily

to recapture the ambiance of the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance. "But more than re
search or practice, the society also attempts
to embody those lost ideals that are found in
the medieval romances: chivalry, courtesy,
honor and graciousness."
The society has a branch at Stanford that
includes members from the surrounding
community. Events include medieval dance
and fight practice. During practice, members
dance to music of traditional wind instru
ments while holding hands and moving in a
circle of fancy footwork
Willeke, temembers his fascination with
medieval culture beginning in early child
hood. After attending countless medieval
role-playing conventions, he stumbled upon
a society event in high school.
"I found the real thing," Willeke said.
The society sponsors many different
events, including revels (parties), seminars,
demonstrations and tournaments. The
weekly meetings in medieval dancing and
fighting are a great way to meet new people
and make friends, but Willeke said the week
end events are "where the magic is." These
events, which gather hundreds of people
from the Bay Area, typically last the whole
weekend.

In the winter, there are often feasts and
dance balls held indoors. The banquets repli
cate medieval high feasts with authentic
recipes and entertainment. During the
spring, tournaments are held where crowds
of people descend on a camping ground and
set up huge pavilions, tables, chairs and fire
pits. There are only two requirements at one
of these camping events, Willeke explained.
One is that participants must make some
"attempt at pre-16th century clothing." This
involves anything from silly hats and colorful
surcoats to elaborate dresses and genuine
medieval armor. The second requirement is
to "be courteous and kind to everyone," fol
lowing the medieval tradition of chivalry.
The main attraction at the tournaments
is the fighting. Participants, many of whom
study medieval methods of fighting, con
struct their own armor and weaponry, that
often varies widely in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness. Both men and women can take
part in the fighting, which Willeke described
as strictly skill-based and not very dependent
on strength or size.
Ironically, Willeke explained that the
recreation of medieval fighting is in fact a
recreation of a recreation. In the
14th century, the tournaments
were meant to imitate past styles of
tournament, without as much in
jury and death. The fighting, which
consists of either one-on-one spar
ring or wars between two opposing
camps, is entirely honor-based. Be
cause the weapons and armor are
padded, the combatants themselves
decide when they have been "mor
tally wounded." The combatants,

according to Willeke, "want to fight
honorably, but victory is not neces
sarily important."
There are many other competi
tions at tournaments in such arts as
music and dancing. The society
handbook names a multitude of
areas of interest: heraldry, manu
script illumination, archery and
metal work.
After the day's activities con
clude, there are campfires, stories
and general revelry, where one can
find society members drinking
mead, a type of honeyed wine found
in old tales of medieval times.
"There is a lot of community,"

Willeke said. He said he particularly
enjoys the fact that there is "no fear
of danger at these events, even
though they involve many people
you don't know who are drinking
and 'armed.' "
Willeke said he believes that the
society embodies a sense of chivalry
"that does not exist in the modern
world." The fundamental idea of
"treating people with respect and
honor," Willeke said, is evident in
all of these tournaments and is
characteristic of the entire organi
zation. In fact, Willeke feels more at
home with the people in the society
than in the Stanford community.
