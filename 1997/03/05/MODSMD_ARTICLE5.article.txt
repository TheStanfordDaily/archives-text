# Diversity is emphasized over unity
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Ethnic organizations on campus are plentiful.
However, diversity — not unity — is their common
thread.
Most students know there are a myriad of cultural
organizations on campus. Many don't know, however,
the distinction between an ethnic community center
and a voluntary student organization.
There are four ethnic centers that are administra
tive units of the University: the Black Community
Services Center, the American Indian / Alaska Native
Program, the Asian American Activities Center and
El Centro Chicano.
These centers are among the 13 community cen
ters that make up the Dean of Students' Office, pro
viding programming and academic support to individ
uals and student organizations. Each center directs
students to University resources, offers advice and
contact information and provides a meeting place for
the many volunteer student organizations working
out of their offices.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said he works closely
with each of the assistant deans of students, who are
the directors of the centers.
Although the ethnic centers "clearly have a focus
for their particular ethnic community, their primary
purpose is to support the educational enterprise at
Stanford while also celebrating and promoting the
history, contribution and intellectual heritage of their
particular ethnicity through educational, cultural
and social programs," Wais said.
Wais added that the ethnic cen
ters also provide "a critical support
system for students of color."
BCSC
Tina Gridiron, assistant direc
tor of the BCSC, described the cen
ter as a resource that "provides
leadership and development op
portunities and training for stu
dents, as well as advising to stu
dent organizations [planning] pro
grams or activities.
"Part of our role on campus is to
provide educational opportunities
for the entire campus around a cul
turally / ethnically specific history
and to provide historical informa
tion and valuable resources to the
campus regarding African-Ameri
can issues, challenges and needs,"
Gridiron said.
Gridiron emphasized the fact
that the role of the ethnic centers
is no different than the role of any
other community center or depart
ment on campus.
Most of the African-American
student organizations operate out
of the BCSC office and work close
ly with the BCSC staff, according
to junior Maria Bleavins, co-chair
of the Black Student Union.
"The BCSC serves to coordi
nate the activities of the different
student organizations," Bleavins
said, adding that there are about
40 black volunteer student organi
zations which work out of the
BCSC office, among them the
Black Student Union.
But although the BCSC offers
resources and advice to many
black student organizations, it
does not necessarily represent
them, according to senior Cristale
Brown, financial chair of the Black
Liberation Month Planning Com
mittee and senior programming
coordinator at the BCSC.
"Because there are a multiplici
ty of groups, you can't look for a
group to address every need of
every community," Brown said.
"[But] BCSC provides ... a solid
foundation from which we are able
to go out and address the rest of
the Stanford community.
"Black student groups do not
stand monolithically for one po
litical agenda. We're a very di
verse community, and we have
different concerns and political

needs," she added.
AAAC
Like the BCSC, the Asian
American Activities Center pro
vides advice and resources for
about 40 Asian-American student
organizations.
Rick Yuen, director of the cen
ter, described the center as "a Uni
versity resource / department, es
tablished to provide services to
students, to make the links be
tween faculty and students, ex
plain University policy and direct
students to the right offices they
might need.
"Stanford is unique in that we
have a pro-active mechanism for
student affairs," said Yuen. "On a
lot of other campuses you have to
knock on many doors to find the
right answers and resource people
to help student affairs. I think
Stanford has taken the position of
having centers that . . . work with
students on a daily basis."
Sophomore Jane Kim, chair of
the Asian American Students As
sociation, described the center as
"a space to plan events, hold meet
ings, and use the facilities."
AASA, the umbrella organiza
tion for Asian-American groups, is
not a representative organization,
according to Kim.
"AASA doesn't pretend to rep
resent the Asian-American com
munity. We know the Asian-Amer
ican community is diverse, in its
opinions, experiences and identi
ty," Kim said. "What we try to do
more than anything is to build
community among the different
groups under AASA and also
[build] good relations with other
communities of color at Stanford."
AIPO
A third ethnic center is the
American Indian / Alaska Native
Program.
"We are advisors and advocates
for our constituent student com
munities and the community as a
whole," said Denni Woodward, in
terim director of the program.
The umbrella organization for
the American Indian / Alaska Na
tive student organizations is the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation. According to Woodward,
there are about 15 organizations
under SAIO's umbrella.
"Native Americans are a di
verse population," said Woodward.
"We're frequently asked, 'What do
Indians think,' [but] by the same
token you couldn't say what all

Californians think or what all peo
ple of Europeans descent think."
Woodward added that the pro
gram "tries very hard to be diplo
matic and inclusive and encourage
our students to be the same."
Senior Clay Akiwenzie, co-chair
of SAIO, agreed with Woodward
that Native Americans do not com
prise one community.
"There's always a tendency,
when [people] talk about Native
Americans to talk about the plains
and powwows, [but] we have over
50 different nations just within
our community," he said.
"So far as multiculturalism,
we're talking different nations
here, not just cultures. There's dif
ferences in understanding what
'Indian' means," Akiwenzie
added.
EI Centro Chicano
The fourth ethnic center is El
Centro Chicano, which serves the
Chicano / Latino community.
"There are a lot of different
needs and ways students interact,"
said Chris Clarke, assistant direc
tor of El Centro Chicano. "I don't
think one particular group would
say they represent all the other
groups or all Chicano students."
"I think it's more around par
ticular issues that students try to
fmd a unified voice," Clarke said,
referring to the recent creation of
the Program in Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity, as well as
debate over the renaming of Casa
Zapata.
Although MEChA has been
considered the umbrella organiza
tion for the Chicano / Latino com
munity, senior Lubia Sanchez,
chair of MEChA, said the organi
zation does not represent the com
munity.
"Because we are such a vocal
group we often are marked as the
'Chicano / Latino' voice," Sanchez
said. "We do not try to represent
any other voice than those of our
members and supporters," she
said.
Sophomore Paola Marusich, co
ordinator of the Latin American
Students Association, said the
Chicano / Latino community is
not unified.
"Each organization is such a
separate entity. I think it's hard to
clump them together when the
cultures vary so greatly," she said.
"I don't think it's a united front
we're presenting, I think we're
presenting a variety of options,"
she added.
