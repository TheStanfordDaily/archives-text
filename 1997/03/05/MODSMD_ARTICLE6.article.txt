# Senate approves grad redistricting
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
After almost a month of con
tentious debate, the ASSU
solved the issues of graduate
senate redisricting and the
nomination of sophomore
Robert Windom to the Constitu
tional Council in a marathon
meeting last night.
Redistricting was deemed as
necessary in order to better rep
resent the diverse needs and in
terests of Stanford's graduate

population.
The bill that passed will give
five seats to the School of Engi
neering, five seats combined to
thg Schools of Education, Earth
Sciences and Humanities and
Sciences, and five seats com
bined to the Schools of Busi
ness, Law and Medicine. The
new plan will move Earth Sci
ences from its current district
with Engineering.
The 5-5-5 bill narrowly
passed following a failed vote on
the 6-5-4 redisricting plan
which would have moved Educa
tion into the district with Busi
ness, Law and Medicine.
The passage of the 5-5-5 bill
resulted from the pleas of sever
al senators to pass a bill.
"We have to vote on some
thing. Otherwise, the graduate
elections are on shaky ground,"
said graduate senator Doug Na
telson.
ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson added, "If we don't
pass this soon, I'm going to hang
myself."
Nonetheless, graduate sena
tor Don Aingworth held out in
opposition to the plan stating
that it was unwise to vote on it
in the absence of many senators.
"We are being forced to vote
on a bill when the vote is now
unrepresentative," said Aing
worth.
Aingworth stalled the bill on
graduate seat re-apportionment
last week when he walked out of
the meeting resulting in a loss of
quorum.
In the other major matter of
the evening, Windom was ap
proved as the third member of the
senate's Constitutional Council.
In contrast to previous meet
ings, Windom received almost
unanimous praise.
"Our questions about Win
dom rested on whether he would
stand up to overwhelming per
sonalities. He has answered this
by showing up at two meetings
and putting up with this abuse,"
said graduate senator Mallory
Roberts. "I was very pleased
with his answers to our ques
tions last week."
An elated Windom said that
he was "quite pleased with the
actions of the senate and is look
ing forward to the appointment
of a fourth justice."
He said he hoped that the
council wouldn't need to be too
active, adding that its mere
presence would hopefully lead
the "president and the senate to
act constitutionally now that
they have someone looking over
their shoulder."
There are currently no candi
dates for the two remaining spots
on the Constitutional Council.
