It's March, and that means time for
Spring Break. March also means Dead
Week and exams. Put down your books
fora while and get outdoors to enjoy the
California sunshine! Any students I see
taking an active study break during Dead
Week—running Campus Drive, playing
pick-up basketball, throwing a Frisbee or
swimming in the Lake—will be rewarded
with NIKE water bottles . . Get set for
a tennis doubleheader as the Stanford
Women's Tennis Team takes on
Washington and the men take on SMU on
Friday, March 7. Both matches start at 1:30
p.m. at the Varsity Tennis Courts. Fans will
be given NIKE Ace Cards. Hold these up
to help support the Cardinal as they
smash their opponents.
DOING 1T...
Junior Economics and Computer Science major Matt Blythe has
followed a long and scary road to become the Stanford Club Ice
Hockey Team's starting defender. In December of his senior year of
high school in Indianapolis, Blythe was diagnosed with Hodgkin's
disease, a form of cancer. Though Blythe managed to stay in school
and graduate while battling this deadly disease, several East Coast
colleges that had been recruiting him to play hockey stopped calling.
Blythe's interest turned West and brought him here to Stanford.
It was very important for him to start college on time with all of his
classmates, which he was able to do with the cancer in remission.
One thing was still missing for him, however —hockey. Blythe found out about Stanford's Club Hockey Team, and he
decided he wanted to play.
With the help of a trainer, Blythe put on 25 pounds and made the team his freshman year. He has been playing ever
since and is an integral part of the team's success. Stanford has been invited to the Division II National Tournament
this year in St. Louis.
Blythe is a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and works as a Residential Computer Coordinator (RCC) for
Junipero. Whenever he can, Blythe talks with other kids who are battling cancer. Blythe knows that a little inspiration
can go a long way; his teammates often compare him to NHL star Mario Lemieux. Like Matt, Lemieux was diagnosed
with Hodgkin's disease and, like Matt, many said he would never play again. His hero's comeback helped motivate
Blythe to stick with the sport he loves.
