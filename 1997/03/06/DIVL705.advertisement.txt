Hosted In the Department ol Anthropology and
the Program in History ami Philosophy of Science
The quick progress recently made by histories of science in their handling
of material practice raise anew an intriguing philosophical question, that
of extending historicity not only to the humans but also to the 4ion
humans and thus ottering to various forms ot realism a new and more
solid ground. The talk will explore four models ot historicity: political
history, technical history, legal history, ami art history, to see what are
the advantages and disadvantages of each in handling scientific objets. It
will then propose a type of historicity adjusted to the specifications ol
scientific objects that must escape at some point the grasp ot human
history anil will show how the notion ol partial existence allows tor a
much finci differentiation than the notion ot demarcation.
