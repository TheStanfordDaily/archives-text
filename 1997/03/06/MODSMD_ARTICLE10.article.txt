New gun restrictions endorsed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Less than two weeks
after a Palestinian's killing spree atop the Empire
State Building, President Clinton clamped down
yesterday on gun sales to foreigners.
Flanked by state troopers and Democratic law
makers in the Oval Office, Clinton urged passage
of a Senate bill making it illegal for non-immi
grant foreigners to carry or buy firearms and
announced new proof-of-residency requirements
for legal aliens buying guns under current law.
The new rules would require a photo ID plus
some other proof, such as utility bills, that the appli
cant has been in the country for three months.
The gunman responsible for last month's
attack, a Palestinian teacher, had lived in a Flori
da motel for just three weeks on a tourist visa
before buying a gun there.

Holocaust victims' fund proposed
BERN, Switzerland (AP) — Switzerland's
president proposed yesterday that his country
endow a $5 billion fund that would aid Holocaust
victims, a major concession to international
groups that claim Swiss banks still hold the for
tunes of murdered Jews.
President Arnold Koller told Parliament that
the Swiss Foundation for Solidarity would use
proceeds from Swiss gold reserves to help Nazi
victims as well as others in need.
Switzerland has been under intense interna
tional pressure to pay compensation to the heirs
of Nazi victims for assets heirs claim were never
returned by Swiss banks.
The Swiss will "do some good to those who
endured unspeakable sufferings 50 years ago,"
Koller said.
