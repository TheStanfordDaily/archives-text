# Rebellion erupts in Albania

SARANDA, Albania (APj — Government jets
bombed a southern town and anti-government mili
tants commandeered tanks and fired ofT anti-aircraft
guns yesterday as weeks of unrest erupted into an
armed revolt in southern Albania.
The two sides fired at each other across a river east
of Vlora, the city at the center of the conflict. Albania's
foreign minister, meanwhile, acknowledged that the
situation in Vlora, Saranda and Delvina was "out of
control."
Yesterday's bombing near Saranda and a major
security operation launched by the government
reflected President Sali Berisha's determination to
quickly end the growing insurrection.
At least five T-55 tanks and half a dozen armored
personnel carriers manned a checkpoint yesterday
near Fieri, 35 miles south of Tirana. Other govern
ment checkpoints also were set up.
In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said his Albanian counterpart, Tritan Shehu, told him
the insurgents had captured three tanks and many

other weapons and aim to seize Tirana, the capital.
The government is seeking to "isolate" the three
southern cities without armed conflict, Shehu said.
Southerners warned the government not to pro
voke them.
"If they move into Saranda, Albania will see the
worst bloodshed ever," said one armed protester, Ilias
Sideris.
Two months of protests by Albanians who lost sav
ings in shady investment schemes culminated in an
orgy of anti-government violence that led BerLsha to
declare a state of emergency Sunday.
Frightened by the violence, a steady stream of peo
ple left the south for the north.
The rebellion has exposed a deep north-south
divide in this impoverished Balkan nation, between
Berisha's supporters in the north and those who
back the opposition Socialists in the south.
Overall, southern Albanians are wealthier — and
therefore lost much more than northerners in the
shady schemes.
