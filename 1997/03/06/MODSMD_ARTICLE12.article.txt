Lack of widespread
support allows many
campus issues to die

IT HAPPENED THREE years
ago. Some of those who remem
ber the event have forgotten.
And many do not even realize that
there was an event to forget.
Three years ago, four Chicano
students went on a hunger strike
to protest administrative insensi
tivity to issues of profound impor
tance to them. One of their
demands was fora campus-wide
ban on grapes. The grape issue
became a heated one across this
campus, to say the least.
Supporters of the grape boycott
were protesting what they consid
ered to be unfair labor practices in
the California agricultural com
munity, specifically the policies
regarding migrant workers. Dur
ing the protests, students recalled
that pesticides were sprayed on
their friends and relatives and, in
some cases, even on themselves.
Last year, the University's Grape
Policy Committee recommended
that individual residences be per
mitted to vote on whether to serve
the fruit in their dining halls. Many
residence halls sponsored forums
and panel discussions on the issue,
and ultimately, students voted to
ban grapes in all but two dining
halls — Manzanita and Ricker.
This year, on the other hand,
few residences have voted on the
grape issue, primarily due to a lack
of education on the issue and a lack
of interest on the part of students.
And this lack of continuing
interest is not unique to the once
highly controversial grape issue.
Once a year or two passes, and par
ticularly once we've left Stanford,
how many of us will think back to
our college years and remember a
grape boycott, let alone other
issues of student activism? Will
the U.S. News & World Report

saga be forever ingrained in our
collective memory? Taco Bell?
By nature, these concerns will
always be fleeting. Students are
usually only here for four years
and then move on with their lives.
Without the activists' own pres
ence on campus, it is difficult for
issues, such as the grape boycott,
to last. And without the activists,
those who were only tangentially
involved with the issue will soon
forget essentially, most
students are selfish.
This does not mean that stu
dents are mean or unkind or that
they don't want to bring change to
others' lives. In fact, most stu
dents want to do just that. Howev
er, the lasting concerns for stu
dents remain selfish ones: how to
get by in CIY what will be served
in the cafeteria this evening, find
ing a good summer job.
Perhaps the disappearance of
active interest in the grape issue is
actually an example of successful
activism. Because dorms have not
voted on the issue for this year,
the vote from last year remains in
place, and thus grapes will not be
served in most campus residences.
The goal of the protesters has
been reached.
But more than likely, the dia
logue has essentially stopped
because a specific group of stu
dents willing to strike in support
of its beliefs has left.
History has shown us that cam
pus issues championed by a par
ticular organization cannot last
long. This is unfortunate because
although student interest dwin
dles, the significance of most
issues brought to the forefront of
campus debate deserve to be
fought for. To maintain this level
of interest across campus genera
tions, activists need not only look
to the present struggle but also to
forming organizations with broad
support and broad concerns to
champion particular interests
that will arise in the future. Real
change takes more than four
years to complete.
