University's ROTCpolicy is morally reprehensible

I MET RECENTLY with Assoc.
Provost Ann Fletcher and University
Registrar Roger Printup about the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps pro
gram at Stanford. Fletcher assured me
that Stanford is firmly committed to con
tinuing its discriminatory involvement in
disbursing scholarships and academic
credit for the ROTC. The administration
has three arguments for continuing this
practice, none of which is persuasive.
First, the administration argues that
Stanford's involvement in this program is
so insignificant as to absolve the University
of any responsibility for discrimination.
The facts don't agree. Stanford has entered
into contracts with three ROTC units at
nearby universities. Without the provost's
signature on those contracts, Stanford stu
dents would not face discrimination.
The University, not the military, is
awarding academic credit. Stanford is the
one providing its facilities to the military
free of charge and advertising for ROTC
in The Stanford Bulletin. If Stanford's
actions are so insignificant, we can stop
them without any ill effect. The argu
ment that Stanford is uninvolved and
thus not culpable in ROTC discrimina
tion is patently false.

Second, the administration argues
that it would be too burdensome to deter
mine which universities follow our
nondiscrimination policy before granting
transfer credit.
This problem is easy to solve. The Uni
versity should only withhold academic
credit for programs which have an explicit
written policy of discriminating against a
class of students that is protected by Stan
ford's nondiscrimination policy. The Uni
versity should only institute or remove
such a ban when it receives notice of
changes in the other institution's policy.
This regime would require almost no
administrative effort. Bans on transfer
ring credit would be rare, reserved for the
most extreme cases of discrimination.
Third, the administration argues that
ROTC scholarships are necessary to meet
the financial aid needs of low-income stu
dents. The implications of this argument
are extremely troubling and only serve to
weaken the administration's position on
ROTC. Stanford has a policy of meeting
all demonstrated need in undergraduate
financial aid. Either Stanford's aid prac
tices are sufficient to meet actual need or
they aren't. If the aid is sufficient, then
ROTC funding can be slowly phased out

without hardship to students.
But if, as the administration suggests,
Stanford's financial aid practices are not
sufficient to meet actual need, then this
university has three serious problems.
First, we are denying access to a Stan
ford education on the basis of wealth,
violating the spirit of Stanford's guaran
tee to meet all demonstrated need. Sec
ond, the administration is allowing stu
dents to be coerced into joining the
ROTC as their only means of attending
Stanford. Students should join ROTC
and enter into the resulting service com
mitment because they want to, not
because they have to. Third, Stanford's
agreement with ROTC is providing criti
cal funding for low-income heterosexual
students without equivalent funding for
low-income gay students. If aid is insuffi
cient and ROTC is the only means of
bridging the gap, Stanford is not only
discriminating, but that discrimination is
placing a significant and disproportionate
financial burden on gay students. If
Stanford's financial aid system is broken,
let's fix it â€” not slap on a discriminatory
funding regime as a Band-Aid.
Gay and lesbian students are a disad
vantaged group. A 1992 Hetrick-Martin

Institute study found that one in four gay
and lesbian youth are forced to leave
home because of conflicts over sexual ori
entation. Studies at Oberlin College, Rut
gers University, Yale University and
Penn State found that 16 to 26 percent of
gay and lesbian respondents had been
threatened with physical violence at col
lege because of their sexual orientations.
A 1989 Department of Health and
Human Services study found that lesbian
and gay youths constitute 30 percent of
all completed suicides and are two to
three times more likely to attempt suicide
than heterosexual youths.
Despite the problems faced by gay and
lesbian students, Stanford has rejected
donations on at least four separate occa
sions from 1976 to 1996 for scholarship
funds to help them. Gay and lesbian stu
dents represent the only disadvantaged
group that the University simultaneously
discriminates against in awarding scholar
ships and academic credit, refuses to
accept scholarship donates to aid and
promises to protect in its nondiscrimina
tion policy. The administration's position
is morally and logically indefensible.
