# Forum comments on Greek housing were taken out of context
## 
### 
As a participant in Monday's student
initiated "Cookies and Tea," I was
delighted to see the picture of an impas
sioned Aly Remtulla under the headline
"Students ask for quicker action." Yet
despite my enthusiasm about the event,
my smile quickly disappeared when I
read how my comments on sorority
housing were distorted.
For several months, I have spoken

out publicly about the inequities of Stan
ford's undergraduate housing system
and have championed the right of
women's Greek organizations to have
access to their own houses. However, at
no time have I ever claimed that "all
Greek organizations should be housed,"
as The Daily repotted I said Monday.
Rather, in an attempt to demonstrate
why the University should grant sorority
women the opportunity to be housed, I
began by questioning the wisdom of dis
cussing the issue of Greek housing solely
in terms of equity. When the sorority
community emphasizes equity above all
other rationales for housing women's
Greek organizations, many members of

the Stanford community then ask why
any Greek organizations should be
housed in the first place. Thus, my goal
Monday afternoon was to highlight cer
tain features common to all Greek orga
nizations, such as our commitments to
philanthropy and educational program
ming, that enable both the University
community and the organizations to
prosper from their being housed.
While I am not ashamed of having
declared Greek life to be a "legitimate
choice," the true crux of my speech was
that all Greek organizations should have
the opportunity to apply for housing.
Yet I emphatically maintain on behalf of
my community that not all Greek orga

nizations want to be housed. More
important, many of us take great pride
in the fact that Stanford's Greek com
munity offers so many alternatives to
traditional, housed Greek life.
Although I spoke at Monday's event, I
benefited much more from listening to
other student activists as well as admin
istrators. Yet noting not only my mis
quote but the article's exclusion of com
ments by two prominent student lead
ers, Jim Finsten and Christie Larson, I
wonder whether The Daily covered the
same event I attended.
