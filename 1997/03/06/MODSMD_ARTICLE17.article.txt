## A
						pocket full of nothing 
### 
LATELY I'VE BEEN paying for
things with crumpled-up dollar bills
and loose change. My wallet was
stolen last week, and I've never been
more frustrated in my life. For three
days, I had no plastic on me and no form
of identification. It seemed like I couldn't
provide evidence for my existence.
The wallet was a birthday gift from my
sister, made of dark-brown alligator skin,
the color of hot Aztec clay. It was my first
adult wallet. That first wallet that doesn't
have Velcro, isn't some cheap imitation,
and doesn't wear away after a month. I
loved the feel of the smooth reptilian skin,
like I was petting my own private alligator.
Now it's gone.
It's my own fault. It fell out of my
sweat pants once before, so I should have
been more cautious with it during the
movie. But you know that feeling you get
after a great movie, when you just get up
and start talking about it with your
friend? My friend Joel and I just got up
and talked about "Shine." We talked
about "Shine" for 20 minutes straight â€”
the entire drive home.
Joel dropped me off, still debating if
Geoffrey Rush would win the Oscar.
Then I sensed a funny feeling by my butt.
Like something was missing. Some sen
sation was missing that only my right
butt-cheek can feel, which must make my
left cheek extremely jealous. My hand
reached around to find an empty pocket
where a wallet should be.

"Shit," I muttered. I went into shock.
The abrupt change in conversation and
the look on my face must have communi
cated something to Joel, because he said,
"Lose your wallet?"
I nodded yes and something told me
that it fell out during the movie. "I have
to go back to the theater," I said.
"Maybe it fell out when you got out of
the car? Trace your steps."
I hate when people tell me to trace my
steps. I always feel like I'm in kinder
garten and I don't know where I left my
coloring book. Everyone doubts your
memory and nobody is convinced that
you looked everywhere to find it.
"It's at the theater. I'm going back." I
ran to my car and jetted to the theater. I
was now victim to a wave of anxiety. It
was like everything in my life was going
down one tremendous toilet. I had no
cash on me, and if I got pulled over I
didn't have a license. Yet I drove faster
than Mario Andretti on the Autobahn.
I said a prayer as I opened the door to
the movie theater, hoping to be greeted
by an over-zealous usher with a big grin
on his face and my wallet in his hand.
Instead, I discovered two guys with white
shirts and black bow-ties talking about
the weather. "Sorry sir, we haven't found
a wallet." I searched the theater three
times over and couldn't find it.
My anxiety turned into a wave of neu
rotic paranoia. Every person in there
became a prime suspect. I looked at the

popcorn guy and saw a pick-pocket. That
hippie chick who sat behind me during
the film became a bank robber. Then I
had a flash of paranoid delusional racism,
and that Susan Smith quote popped into
my. "Some black guy did it!" And we all
know where Susan Smith is right now.
I left my name and number and got
back in my car with the dying hope that
my wallet would be found by closing. Of
course, that never came to pass. I remem
ber thinking how little caution I had
when it came to my wallet. How could
something which holds so much impor
tance, so much weight, be so easy to lose?
And that old saying came back to me:
"You never realize the value of something
until you no longer have it." At that
moment, at the point when I realized that
my wallet may be gone forever, that
seemed so true to me. As I opened the
door to my room and began the first of
many calls invalidating my plastic cards, I
promised myself never to lose sight of
what I have now that could easily be lost
tomorrow. And I promised myself a new
wallet but this time with a chain.

Jordan Gelber, a senior majoring in com
munication and drama, still hasn't found
his wallet, and he wants to let whoever has
it know that everything's been invalidated
and that they should feel very guilty.
