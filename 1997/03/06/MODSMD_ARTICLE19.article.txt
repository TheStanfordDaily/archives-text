## Eagles crash Women's tennis soars to victory 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
In not-so-dramatic fashion, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
squad squashed Boston College 9-
0 at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium yesterday.
The Cardinal (14-1 overall, 3-0
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) dropped only two sets
total in the match, winning seven
matches in straight sets.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh, the
No. 1 18-and-under player in the
country, made her Stanford sin
gles debut, competing at the No. 3
singles spot. Back in action after
missing all of January and most of
February with a sore shoulder,
Osterloh needed no adjustment
time as she whitewashed Christi
na Malone, 6-0, 6-0.
"It was good to see Lilia back
in," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "She played
injury-free, and she played that
much better than the last time."
With two more matches coming
up this weekend against Washing
ton and Washington State, Bren
nan elected to rest senior co-cap
tain Katie Schlukebir for the day
and junior Ania Bleszynski in sin
gles.
With two starters out of the
lineup, freshman Jenn Heiser
made the most of an opportunity
in the No. 6 singles match, down
ing Kim Arbuckle, 6-2, 0-6, 6-3.
"This was an opportunity to get
some other people some experi
ence," Brennan said. "Jenn got to
play, and she did a very good job."

Filling in for Schlukebir in the
No. 1 match was freshman Anne
Kremer. Kremer cruised in
straight sets against Barbara
Privrel, 6-1,6-3. Senior Sandra De
Silva shook off a slow start in the
No. 2 match to emerge victorious
in straight sets as well against
Mercedes De Valle, 6-3, 6-1.
"My concentration was lacking
a little bit at the start," De Silva
said. "Sometimes when we are
playing a team that isn't Cal or
Texas, I tend not to focus as much.
But I got it together when I start
ed to focus and concentrate bet
ter."
Freshman Taryn Ashley, unde
feated thus far in dual-match com
petition, also took her match at
No. 5 in straight sets, defeating
Carey Ann Denefrio, 6-0, 6-3.
Boston College won its only
other set in the No. 4 singles
match. Cardinal junior Julie Scott
had no problem in the first set, but
the Eagles' Shannon Byrne forced
a split in the second. Scott
bounced back fora 6-0, 4-6, 6-3
victory.
Boston College proved no more
challenging in doubles competi
tion, losing all three matches. On
the No. 1 court, Scott and Bleszyn
ski continued their solid play in
rolling over De Valle and Privrel,
8-1. On Sunday against Texas, the
junior All-Americans upset the
top-ranked doubles team in the
nation.

good because the more we play

together, the more we get to know
each other's games," Bleszynski
said. "We've had a few lapses, such
as against Cal, but we're definitely
starting to click. Our games and
personalities click well together."
Osterloh and Kremer, Stan
ford's diaper dandies, teamed up
for an 8-2 win while Heiser and

senior Emily Burt also cruised, 8-2.
In her third match back from
injury — Osterloh played doubles
against Cal and Texas — the fresh
man continued to work her way
back to 100 percent.
"She will be in there," Brennan
said. "She has got to keep playing
and getting up to speed."
While Brennan will be looking
to rest more of his starters against
the Huskies tomorrow and the
Cougars Saturday, Osterloh will be
in the lineup.
