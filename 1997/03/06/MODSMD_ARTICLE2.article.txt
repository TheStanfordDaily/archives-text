# Fac Sen to discuss CIV changes today
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
Despite concerns from faculty members
teaching in the Program in Cultures, Ideas
and Values, the Faculty Senate today will
discuss a report on changing the structure of
the Area One requirement.
According to Asst. Academic Secretary
Patricia Del pozzo, the discussion will be "an
opportunity for senators to raise questions
and make comments" about the report and
is intended for the benefit of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies.
"At this point, there is no proposal from
the (undergraduate studies committee] that
asks for senate action," Del-Del pozzo said.
"This is pretty much preliminary discus
sion."
The report proposes a transition from the
current three-quarter structure to a one
quarter-two quarter sequence. It was sub
mitted to the undergraduate studies com
mittee by the CIV Redesign Committee on
Feb. 19.
If the new plan is approved it will be com
pletely in place by the 2000-01 academic
year. The first quarter, called "Introduction
to the Humanities," would consist of three or
four tracks with large, team-taught lectures
and sections of no more than 15 students.
Seeking to examine works in depth, the
course will only cover three to five texts.
The second and third quarters will re
main similar to the current CIV tracks.
The report comes to the senate and un
dergraduate studies committee for discus
sion over the objections of History Prof. Paul

Seaver, the director of CIV, and 21 other
members of CIV faculty.
In a letter to undergraduate studies com
mittee and the steering committee of the
Senate on Feb. 14, Seaver and his colleagues
suggest that the CIV Redesign Committee
did not fulfill the mandate it received from
the Senate.
According to Seaver, the CIV Redesign
Com mittee did not conduct a thorough study
of programs at other institutions similar to
CIV, did not survey students after they fin
ished the track, and never gathered a visiting
committee to analyze the objectives and im
plementation of CIV.
All of these procedures are among those
outlined in the Senate resolution that origi
nally authorized Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven to appoint the CIV Re
view Committee.
On Feb. 22, English Prof. Rob Polhemus,
the chair of CIV Review Committee, ad
dressed the concerns of CIV faculty in a let
ter to the Senate Steering Committee.
The steering committee met with Seaver
and Polhemus on Feb. 25 and, after the
guests left, voted unanimously to allow un
dergraduate studies committee and the Sen
ate to proceed with a discussion of the report.
Polhemus said that he looks forward to a
substantive discussion of the report's pro
posals during today's meetings.
Given the wide latitude senators have in
what they may discuss, neither Polhemus
nor Del pozzo was willing to comment on
whether the question of the CIV Review
Committee's original charge would come up
at today's meeting.
