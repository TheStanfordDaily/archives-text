# Sixteen straight?
## No. 3 volleyball defeats Ramblers 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team continued its dominance at
home last night, sort of. Facing
the Ramblers of Loyola Universi
ty-Chicago, the Cardinal struggled
early appearing to forget the type
of play that earned the squad its
four-game winning streak at
home, all against top 15 teams.
Regardless of its ranking, Loy
ola appeared to be a real power
house, storming out to an early
game one lead, 9-1, during a peri
od in which Stanford looked
almost lackadaisical. However,
after letting the Ramblers gain a
certain measure of confidence,
Stanford began its comeback.
Unlike past games, when Stan
ford's starters have keyed the
comeback, this time reserve out
side hitters junior Devin Poolman
and sophomore Jeremy Bart led
the Cardinal back. Stanford
clawed back to 9-6 and eventually
took the lead 13-12. From there
the sides traded points, to 16 all, at
which time the next point would
win. Despite the vociferous sup
port of the Burnham crowd, Stan
ford yielded a point and got itself
in an early hole, 1-0.
"I think we came in a little bit
over-confident," Bart said. "In the
first game the first 10 points kind
of shocked us and we figured out
that we had to turn it on."
In game two, Stanford got out
to an early lead at 4-1 and then
generally held its lead by about
that margin before beginning to
widen it behind the serve of senior
middle blocker Mike Hoefer.
Although the Ramblers made an
effort to stay around, getting as
close as 12-9, Stanford shut the
door, going on to win 15-9.
Game three saw the two squads
trade points until Stanford broke
away, once again on the serve of

Poolman, from a 5-5 tie to go up 8-
5. From there, the Cardinal took
control, going on to win 15-10 and,
for the time being, appeared to
have regained its top form.
In game four, the Card jumped
ahead early going up 4-1, but the
Ramblers battled back to retake
the lead 11-10 as Stanford
appeared to struggle once again.
From there Loyola went up 14-10
and after Stanford got two points
the Ramblers closed out the game
15-12 evening the match at two.
"The second and third games
were pretty good," Bart said "But
in the fourth game we got behind
early, I think we came into that
game thinking that it was over."
The fifth and final game was
sure to be exciting, as the regular
scoring format is replaced by the
faster rally scoring in which a
team gets a point regardless of
whether it is serving. Early on, the
two teams traded points and
errors, as the Card did all it could
to help out Loyola by giving the
Ramblers points on errors.
After the somewhat sloppy play
that began the game, things began
to heat up. Loyola went up 9-7,
but Stanford roared right back
tying the game at nine and induc
ing the Ramblers to call a time
out. Coming out of the break, the
teams once again traded points, as
tensions continued to run high.
Two great digs by senior setter
Stewart Chong led to kills by Pool
man and senior outside hitter
Matt Fuerbringer, giving Stanford
the lead, 14-12. Loyola battled
back to tie it at 14, but Stanford
was too much in the end, eking out
the victory and sending the fans
home happy, 16-14.
Stanford, playing without
senior outside hitter Mike Lam
bert, had to rely on its other
potent offensive powers. Fuer
bringer contributed a season high
30 kills, hitting .350, and outside

hitters Poolman, playing in place
of Lambert, and freshman Andy
Witt added 21 and 26, respective
ly. Sophomore outside hitter Jeff
Schultz paced the Ramblers with a
match high 33 kills.

Although the effort was not the
team's best, the end of the match
showed how well the squad can
play when it really matters, a skill
that will be critical as it heads into
the second half of the season.
