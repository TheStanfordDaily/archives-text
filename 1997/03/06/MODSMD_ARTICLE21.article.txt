# Men's basketball eyes NCAA tourney
## Stanford hoopsters face No. 12 Arizona at Maples Pavilion 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Three days from today, the NCAA Selection
Committee will announce tournament brackets
and seedings on live television, with dozens of
schools standing by, fingers crossed, anxiously
awaiting their fate.
No. 23 Stanford will undoubtedly be one of
those teams, but it can make things a lot easier
on itself with a win over No. 12 Arizona tonight
at Maples Pavilion. While Stanford could earn a
tournament selection by splitting its two week
end's games, a win tonight would all but guar
antee a postseason berth.
For now, Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery is only concerning himself with the

business at hand. After ail, speculation won't do
any good come Sunday.
"You'll drive yourself batty," Montgomery
said. "All the things that you read or hear are all
speculation. People are paid to come up with an
opinion about something, but really nobody will
know what's going to happen until Sunday."
Arizona and USC are currently tied for sec
ond in the Pacific 10 Conference at 11-5, one
game ahead of Stanford and California. But the
Wildcats are virtually assured a NCAA berth,
thanks to nonconference wins over several
quality opponents, including top-10 teams (and
potential No. 1 seeds) North Carolina and Utah.
UCLA, of course, has already clinched the
Pac-10 Championship and the guaranteed tour
nament berth that accompanies it. That leaves

USC, Stanford and Cal all scrambling for at
large berths. And don't forget Washington — if
the Huskies beat UCLA and USC this weekend,
they, too, could make a compelling case for their
inclusion in the tournament.
"I don't think you'd have any trouble justify
ing having five and possibly even six people in
the tournament" from the Pac-10, Montgomery
said. "You can make a case for six schools with
out feeling like you're trying to pull the wool
over somebody's eyes."
Stanford certainly has its work cut out
tonight against an Arizona team whose talent
rivals, if not surpasses that of conference cham
pion UCLA. The Wildcats boast one of the con-
ference's (and the nation's) best
point guards in freshman Mike
Bibby, most talented scorers in
junior Michael Dickerson and most
skilled big men in 6-foot-8 junior
Bennett Davison.
Throw in 6-foot-11 center A.J.
Bramlett and junior off-guard
Miles Simon, who did not play in
the Wildcats' 76-75 win over Stan
ford on Jan. 4 due to academic inel
igibility, and it's one of the most
imposing starting lineups this side
of the Atlantic Coast Conference.
One concern for Stanford has
been its recent over-reliance on out
side shooting. It worked to the Car
dinal's favor Saturday against Cal,
when Stanford drained 11-of-22
three-pointers in a 73-63 win. In
fact, the Cardinal has already shat
tered a school record this season
with 199 three-pointers. But what
happens when its shooters go cold?
"You've got to go with what you
do, and you can't manufacture
something that doesn't exist,"
Montgomery said. "If we're not get

ting the ball down inside, then
there's no point going there.
"Because of our size inside, a lot
of people are doubling down and
collapsing down, which forces you
to shoot the ball from outside.
When guys are open, I think
they've got to have the freedom to
shoot the ball."
Shooting the ball hasn't been a
problem at Maples Pavilion this
year, where Stanford is scorching
the nets at 50-percent. That's one
reason the Card may complete the
season undefeated at home for the
first time since 1988-89 and for the
second time in Maples history.
"It's not a cockiness, it's just a
confidence" when it comes to win
ning at home, said freshman guard
David Moseley. As for the tourna
ment, he said, "Not only do we feel
we have to win both, we want to
win both — we have confidence
that we can beat Arizona at home."
It may not be March Madness
(at least not yet), but it's just the
kind of game that can keep a coach
tossing and turning at night.
"Subconsciously you get real
anxious about this time of year,"
he said.
Just wait until Sunday.
