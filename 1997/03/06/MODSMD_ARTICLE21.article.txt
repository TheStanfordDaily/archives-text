# Men's basketball eyes NCAA tourney
## Stanford hoopsters face No. 12 Arizona at Maples Pavilion 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Three days from today, the NCAA Selection
Committee will announce tournament brackets
and seedings on live television, with dozens of
schools standing by, fingers crossed, anxiously
awaiting their fate.
No. 23 Stanford will undoubtedly be one of
those teams, but it can make things a lot easier
on itself with a win over No. 12 Arizona tonight
at Maples Pavilion. While Stanford could earn a
tournament selection by splitting its two week
end's games, a win tonight would all but guar

For now, Stanford head coach Mike Mont

know what's going to happen until Sunday."
Arizona and USC are currently tied for sec

game ahead of Stanford and California. But the
Wildcats are virtually assured a NCAA berth,
thanks to nonconference wins over several
quality opponents, including top-10 teams (and
potential No. 1 seeds) North Carolina and Utah.
UCLA, of course, has already clinched the
Pac-10 Championship and the guaranteed tour

USC, Stanford and Cal all scrambling for at
large berths. And don't forget Washington â€” if
the Huskies beat UCLA and USC this weekend,
they, too, could make a compelling case for their
inclusion in the tournament.
"I don't think you'd have any trouble justify
ing having five and possibly even six people in
the tournament" from the Pac-10, Montgomery
said. "You can make a case for six schools with
out feeling like you're trying to pull the wool
over somebody's eyes."
Stanford certainly has its work cut out
tonight against an Arizona team whose talent
rivals, if not surpasses that of conference cham
pion UCLA. The Wildcats boast one of the con-
