# Men swim for another Pac-10 title
## 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swimming
team is shooting for its 16th
straight Pacific 10 Conference
championship this weekend in
Long Beach, Calif.
The Cardinal has won the con
ference title every year since the
1981-82 season, the longest streak
of any Pac-10 athletic program,
including the great John Wooden
coached UCLA basketball teams of
the 1960s and 19705.
All dynasties are tested though,
and this year will not be the usual
cakewalk for the Cardinal. With
USC and California teams that are
hitting "10-year highs" in talent,
Stanford expects the caliber of the
meet to be higher this year than in
the past.
USC and Cal "are both really
good teams. But they are young,
and our guys know how to win,"
said junior sprint freestyler Chris
Olson. "Plus, there is the added
incentive of getting USC back for
giving us the only blemish on our
record this year."
Aside from continuing its 16-
year streak of conference champi

onships, this weekend offers Stan
ford a rematch with USC, the only
team to beat the Cardinal in a dual
meet this year. In early February,
a well-rested Trojan team came to
deGuerre Pool and eked out a six
point victory over Stanford.
Although the loss was disappoint
ing for the Stanford swimmers, it
will not be too great of a mental
obstacle at this weekend's champi
onships.
"Losing to USC did not hurt
our confidence because it was not
a true indicator of where we stood
in relation to them at that point in
the season," said freshman breas
troker Steve Ronson.
Ronson's reasoning comes from
the fact that he and his teammates
have set their sights on this week
end's meet all year, while the Tro
jans gave up a lot by preparing and
resting specifically for the dual
meet against Stanford.
Although only a freshman,
Ronson, who is from southern
California, looks forward to the
comfort of Long Beach's Belmont
Plaza Aquatic Center.
"It's cool because the pool is a
familiar setting for me," said the
Tustin, Calif., native.

Ronson and fellow freshmen
Glenn Counts, Kurt Spencer and
Steve Neebe are expected to have
an impact on the team's perfor
mance.
"The freshmen definitely start
ed to come around at the Cal dual
meet," said junior butterflyer and
freestyler Jed Crowe. "I think they
are expecting big things of them
selves."
The dual meet against Califor
nia alluded to by Crowe was the
Cardinal's final regular season
dual meet, and it was an exciting
contest in which the Golden Bears
swam exceedingly well. The Cardi
nal, however, was able to counter
all of Cal's good swims with fan
tastic performances of its own to
eventually win the meet. But one
can be sure that with its stock of
foreign Olympians, California will
be joining Stanford and USC in
the battle for the top honors in
more than a few of this weekend's
races.
Even with the increased talent
in the pool at this years Pac-lOs,
the Stanford team likes its
chances of bringing yet another
