# Women's hoops goes to Arizona

### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
For Stanford, the long and
winding road to a No. 1 seed goes
through Arizona.
The third-ranked Cardinal (28-
1, 16-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
looks to solidify its grip on a top
seed in the NCAA tournament
starting tonight as it takes on the
Arizona Wildcats (21-6, 11-5) in
the McKale Center in Tucson. The
6 p.m. matchup is one more step
toward a second consecutive per
fect conference mark and also pro
vides a good road test against a
potential tournament team.
"We're still in a situation where
we don't have everybody," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We're going to need dif
ferent people stepping up for us,
and we're going to have to play
well. This is the senior's last road
trip to Arizona. I think what we've
been able to count on from them is
the pride that they have in playing
well wherever they play."
Normally, with only the Ari
zona schools standing between
Stanford and the tournament, the
tendency would be to look past this
weekend's opponents. However,
the Cardinal cannot afford that

luxury. As VanDerveer pointed out
last week after the California
game, a loss this weekend could
potentially drop the Card from a
top seed due to the league's image
as a soft conference.
Also, the team is not quite
healthy. Junior forward Heather
Owen continues to nurse her bro
ken finger and will not make the
trip. Her cast will come off next
week, though, and she continues
to work out with the team. Fellow
junior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele will travel with the
squad but is doubtful to play.
"She practiced and looked real
good" on Monday, VanDerveer
said. "But her knee just swells on
her. It's been four weeks since
surgery. We're trying to be patient,
but we obviously want her to play."
The Wildcats have had an
impressive year following last sea
son's 25-8 record, which was
capped off by the Women's Nation
al Invitational Tournament cham
pionship. Their 11-5 conference
mark includes impressive road
wins at USC and Oregon. Still, the
team finds itself fourth in the con
ference after succumbing to Wash
ington 76-59 in Seattle last Satur
day.
The Wildcats are led bv junior

forward Adia Barnes, who is aver
aging more than 19 points a game
while grabbing 6.7 rebounds per
contest, placing her among the top
ten in the conference in both cate
gories. She will probably be looking
to bounce back after an atrocious
3-of-15 shooting performance
against the Huskies. Redshirt
freshman guard Lisa Griffith is
averaging four assists per contest,
as she tries to fill the huge void left
by graduated point guard Brenda
Pantoja, who led the country in
assists (9.3) last year.
"Arizona shouldn't be, but
maybe they perceive themselves to
be, a bubble team," VanDerveer
said. "1 think it's really important
to play well against them."
Playing well will be especially
important for the Card after last
week's ho-hum effort against the
Bears. With the tournament just
about here, Stanford needs to be
playing its best basketball.
"We were up 34-9 [last week],
and it's a challenge to play with the
type of intensity that you need,"
VanDerveer said. "The only thing I
would say is that it's a challenge,
but it's doable. I know because I
had a team last year that blew peo
ple out and got after it every single
game."
