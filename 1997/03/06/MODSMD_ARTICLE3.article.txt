Students who take Political Science
104, a seminar in urban policy, look be
yond their textbooks and lectures to ex
perience issues personally through in
ternships in East Palo Alto.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga has taught the course since 1993.
He said it mirrored a national trend to
ward increasing community service
components in college curricula.
In addition to a seminar where stu
dents discuss contemporary urban poli
cy issues such as housing, diversity, so
cial services and economic development,
students spend seven hours every week
on one of several projects in the East

Palo Alto community.
"Service learning is a way for stu
dents to strengthen their academic work
by applying it to real-life situations. It
helps forge stronger relationships to
help the community do what it wants to
do while educating students at the same
time," said Fraga.
Students in the seminar can work
with the East Palo Alto city government
on rent stabilization, with the police or
on economic development projects.
There are also several internships
with community-based organizations
such as Families in Transition, the Cen
ter fora New Generation, the Enter
prise Foundation and the Boys and Girls
Club.

Katie Tinto, Class of '96, who will be
the teaching assistant for the seminar
this spring, took the class during her se
nior year.
At that time, she took an internship
with the East Palo Alto police and
began the Family Violence Prevention
Center, a group that aims to prevent
family violence through education and
outreach.
After that, she said, she obtained a
grant and now works full-time at the
center she started as an undergraduate.
The center has an advisory panel com
prised of community members and has
expanded to train volunteers to give pre
sentations on family violence.
"East Palo Alto is small, so you get a

sense of how the different problems get
played out. It's a really valuable experi
ence as it's a two-way learning relation
ship. Students help a community devel
op, and they help themselves through
experiential learning," said Tinto.
Through seeing the problems on a
first-hand basis from this neighboring
community, students have the opportu
nity to strengthen the more abstract
academic theory, Tinto said.
Fraga sees service learning as very
important for students who wish to pur
sue a career in the social sciences.
"Doing rounds is a standard practice
for people who are training to be doc-
