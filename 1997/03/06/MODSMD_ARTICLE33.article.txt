The Drama Department stages Chekhov in a brighter light

Most of the time Anton Chekhov's plays are per
formed,the audience really doesn't know when
to laugh and when to cry. This week, the Drama
Department will present two one-act comedies by Anton
Chekhov that are no exception: "The Bear" and"The Fes
tivities." Like Chekhov's major plays, such as "Uncle
Vanya" and"The Cherry Orchard," these two works blur
the lines between comedy and drama. He wrote his plays
around the turn of this century, and his characters often
meditate on times to come.
"The Bear" is staged in the time it was written, 1888. It
opens with Popova (Blythe Frank), a young widow who
has locked herself in her house fora year after her hus
band's death, sitting at a desk turned away from a window
looking out at the world. She intends to remain faithful to
the memory of an adulterous husband. But then Smirnoff
(Jarek Truszczynski), a creditor, enters, demanding re
payment of her husband's debts; he needs money to pay
his mortgage. They insult each other and enact the debate
over 19th century sexual politics. This interaction un
leashes feistiness in Popova which in turn earns the ardor
of Smirnoff.
"The Festivities" is staged in contemporary times.
Shipuchin (Sterling Brown) is a bank manager planning
a celebration for himself and his bank. In anticipation of
his guests, he attempts to keep his office in perfect work
ing order with technologically advanced devices. Disaster
ensues as these devices fail to make things run smoothly.
Paul Schmidt recently wrote new translations of these
plays, which will be published in April. The translations
are an attempt to render Chekhov in an updated Ameri
can idiom because most translations are older and
British.
Caroline Nastro, a Drama Department doctoral stu
dent, directs. Her previous Stanford work includes the
Tennessee Williams dramas " The Glass Menagerie" and
"27 Wagons Full of Cotton." Intermission talked to Nas
tro last weekend between rehearsals at the Nitery.
I: Why stage Chekhov's one-acts rather than the larger
plays?
CN: That's just a practical thing because we were looking
for smaller plays — we wanted to do two in conjunction.
And 1 have done dramas and 1 was looking to do comedy.
Also, there's a Chekhov seminar series going on in the
Drama Department. So these plays are being done in con
junction with that and there's going to be a later play:
"Uncle Vanya." But mostly because I wanted to do come
dy instead of drama.
I: With an artist like Chekhov, the audience is going to be
bringing in a lot of expectations about his work. How are
you reacting to those expectations?

CN: What sort of expectations do
you think the audience would be
bringing in to the play?
I: Well, especially with the one-acts
people are likely expecting, despite
whatever heavier issues the charac
ters might be going through, a par
ticular lightness and joyous attitude
that Chekhov usually has....
CN: I think the plays are kind of
difficult in that way because you
have these farcical elements but at
the same time the characters are
somewhat psychologically devel
oped. It's the difficulty of working
with two different modes of play
writing and trying to put them to

gether. So, for example, in the first part of "The Bear"
Popova is trapped in her world of mourning, but she's
also stuffing her face full of candy.
I: So do you see that psychological complexity as a source of
the comedy?
CN: I think you can play with it a little hit. At times there
is a psychological moment where Popova is lost in her
own world, and then all of a sudden she's eating candy,
and it rips you right out of it. So we're working with that
sort of juxtaposition and contradiction. And in"The Fes
tivities" we do a lot more of that. It's a darker comedy. The
characters will be saying one thing, talking as if they're
wrapped up in their own ideas, but their body will be
doing something else, which in a way symbolizes the
problems of these characters.
Heerin (Anthony Celentano) is a clerk in a bank, and
he's sitting doing certain things in a particular method,
but he's really angry and sort of frazzled. Rather than get
ting angry at the characters around him, he is trying to
control objects. He's not just sharpening his pencil, he's
practically grinding it to its tip. He can only unleash his
anger on this object, while attempting to remain calm and
in control with the people around him. So these juxtapo
sitions work together.

I: How do you feel that Chekhov
works with symbolsln "The Bear"
the audience can't help but notice
the repeated references to oats.
CN: At the time, oats were a pre
cious thing to give to the horses,
and (Popova) keeps giving these
oats away. It's similar to the way she
eats the candy at the beginning of
the plav — she's wasting, eating
things as a sign of mourning.
And then Smirnoff comes in,
and he is owed money because of
the oats that her husband has
been feeding to the horse. It is im
plied then that [the husband) had
been traveling around, cheating
on her, so the horse needed all the
oats because it had been galloping
around the countryside, taking
the husband to see all of these
women. But then Smirnoff turns
out to be the man that Popova
falls in love with. So there are con
nections between hurt and love
and the oats. It's tricky, though,
because it isn't directly explained
in the script.

I: "The Hear" is a period piece, but "The Festivities" is set in
contemporary times. What sort of correspondences do you
see between the two plays?
CN: I think both arc related in that characters in both are
obsessed with one idea. Smirnoff wants to get his money
just as the bank manager, Shipuchin (Sterling Brown) is
obsessed with keeping his bank aesthetically pleasing for
the arrival of the delegation. Popova is caught up in the
idea of mourning for her husband's death.
Everyone is caught up in these illusions that they have
created, refusing to come out of them. But then another
character comes in and shatters these illusions or they're
forced to break open, and that's where the comedy comes
in, breaking down these illusions....
I: That seems to be one of Chekhov's central themes — shat
tering illusions. Hut at the same time they're plays, and
drama is about creating illusions. Do you see any contradic
tions there?
CN: I'hat it's a play about shattering illusions? I found
something interesting in reading Chekhov's letters in
preparing for this production, and he talks about how
plays should not only present life as it is, but also how it
should be. He was referring more to the later plays, but I
think what's neat about the comedies is that they express
moments that wouldn't necessarily occur in real life.
And in that way, even though it's a play presenting il
lusions breaking down, it's still supporting an illusion
because in real life these illusions probably wouldn't
break down. The characters would stay ensconced in
their own little worlds. That's what Chekhov seems to
celebrate. B
