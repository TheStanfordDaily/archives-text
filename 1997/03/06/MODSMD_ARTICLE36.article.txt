What: Battle of the Bands
When : Saturday at 9:30 p.m.
Where: Toyon Hall
How Much: Free

fy Sve bands will make the walls of Toyon Hall crumble
JL Saturday as members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraterni
hp ty host the Battle of the Bands, an annual event
since 1991. The battle features some of the loudest,
wackiest and most talented bands on campus in a
competition of grinding guitars and strained vocal
cords.

Also sponsored by the Chi Omega sorority, Tower Records in Mountain View and Groove
smith music store, Battle of the Bands promises to be a night of great music and fun. Admis
sion is free for students, and five bands will compete for the favor of the crowd as well as a cash
prize and a spot on KZSU's "Wednesday Night Live."
"We put on Battle of the Bands to provide campus bands with some exposure and to pro
vide the campus with enjoyment," said sophomore Jason Weiner, who organized this year's
battle. "Audiences should expect great music played by student bands, with pretty short breaks
between, plenty of room to dance near the stages and a chance to mix with people from all over
campus."
Last year, the winners weie Oddjob in first place, Jellyroll in second and Lifskada in third.
Here is an introduction to this year's bands, in no particular alphabetical order.

one of whom is from Stanford — Fellow sports a raw, hard
hitting but mellow sound, just heavy enough to convey a
fee Ii ng of angst and fed - u ped ness.
"I don't really like to describe our style, I'd prefer for you •
to just hear it," said guitarist Andrew Roper, a sophomore. "I
will say, however, that it is guitar-based rock and that we are
not like Cake."
In addition to Roper, the band includes guitarist Vic
Chico, vocalist T.J. Chopclas, bassist Jason Bakke and drummer Randy Tan. Because the
band's members are at different schools, they've had to sacrifice some time playing together.
"Academics don't really come into play, except that they make us practice a little less often,"
said Roper. "T.I. and Vic are at American River College and Randy is at UC-Davis. I'm here.
We just deal."
Despite its members' geographic separation, the band finds time to perform together. They
also cut an album this summer.
The band finds inspiration in a variety of places, according to Roper. "I guess we all kind of
listen to Seattle bands, although I'm trying to shy away from that scene. We all have different
influences, although for Vic and myself, I'd have to say that Dave Matthews and Soundgar
den's guitar work is definitely one of the greatest influences."
"We are all really looking forward to it," Roper said'ofthe upcoming competition. "It should be
a great chance to play for- an enthusiastic audi
cncc.... Playing with other bands
should make it interesting, and it
will be nice to listen to other
musicians and see what cre
ativity they have to offer."

"We tend to be somewhere between the Grateful Dead,
Phish, King Crimson [and] the jazzy /funky beats,
rhythms and melodies of such greats as Herbie Han
cock. ... You name it, we'll try it," said senior Dave Siegd
of his band, Honeydew.
With junior John Cha on electric bass and primary funk,
junior Steve Enstad on lead / rhythm guitar and vocals, Scott
Gagner, Class of 1996, on drums, vocals and bovine accompaniment and Siegel on
rhythm / lead guitar and vocals, this band is indeed very Dead-like, marked by jazzy and
bluesy instrumental solos.
The band has formed two years ago, when Siegel and Enstad, who were neighbors in Stem
Hall, started playing together. "We played guitar together quite a bit that year and wrote a few
tunes, covered a few tunes and realized that our styles tended to be quite complementary,"
said Siegel.
The band picked up current drummer Gagner at its first performance at a Stanford Di-j
rectory party.
"Our then-drummer was conspicuously absent just prior to the show, when lo and behold,:
a random fella — Scott — started looking through our song book," Siegel added.
Although Gagner did not end up sitting in that night he joined a few months later, and the J
band made its first public performance in its current incarnation on Valentine's Day last year!
at an Enchanted Broccoli Forest happy hour.
"We've played a few parties on campus and several EBF happy hours," Siegel said. "The!
happy hours tend to be pretty fun — crazy, wild times with crazy, wild folks."
Personality-wise, the band is very compatible. "We're really lucky — we have four vision j
aries all grouped together in one band," said Siegel.
This visionary attitude comes through in the group's approach to their music. "You dont«
want a stillborn song; you want a song to come out just like a healthy baby — kicking <mdj
screaming and with a long, bloody cord coming out of it attached to you," Siegel explained.
As far as the way they approach their shows, they try to be up front with their audiences, j
"You just have to be honest;;
you reallv have to mean it,i
or else everyone will
V know," said SiegdL
"The crowd al
ways knows
when you're
not being
V sincere."
Perhaps the youn. est band on the b.itilo s ballot. Too Much Neon stirs a mix of different
styles into its music"!{'s like putting what you have in the fridge in the blender'' said vocalist
and harmonica playu Kim Coffey, a sophomore.
Other member; m;lude junior Kelly Irvin on b&>s, freshman Wendy Marinaccio on drums'!
and sophomore Dm iv.Morrow on guitar. 1 he band comes from a variety of musical back
grounds. Coffey h* :»ad no formal voice training but has done some theatrical singing, and
Irvin is mostly self-taught. Marinaccio, now a member ol
the Stanford Band, played in her high school's jazz band,
ai)d Morrow finds tntluence in pop groups like U2 and the Pet Shop Boys.
Morrow and Cof&y have been playing together since last year, but the band has oulv been in its
current form for about one quarter. Although the group is still young, it has been putting in a lot
of practice time in preparation for battle >>} the Bands.
"1 have no life," Maiinacc io complained, U 1 play music and go to class. But 1 don't mind."
Every Friday the band performs in what it calls "roving practices'' where the members pick a
dorm and go play for people there. "We've been kicked out of more places than any other on-cam
pus band'' said Irvin.
The band is rather sporadic in choosing influences for its songs. "A lot of our songs last year were
very depressing and were mostly influenced by bad relationships we were having," Morrow
"But we're a happier band this ye.it."
Even.the band's lyrics come from many sources.l wish my lyrics were like Paul WesterbergV
Coffey said, " 'cause then they'd be really cool. [Writing lyrics] is kind of like the way you write a
paper — vaguely, so that it fits many interpretations."
Marinaccio takes an intuitive approach to herplaving. "1 just add what feels right tome," she said.
Because they range so much in backgrounds and class years, the
group has found itself to he an interesting combination.
"Danny th inks we're three freaks and the normal guy,"

"I really like stories" said Jean-Paul
"If you don't tell the truth for your own benefit, it's
called lying. But if you don't tell the truth for the amuse-
ment of others, it's called storytelling."
lor King, the story element is the base for
both lyrics and instrumental interludes between vers
es.
The band came together about I 1/2 years ago,
when Labrosse and junior Joseph King met each
other while performing with Talisman a capella.
A cappella "was a great experience, but it wasn t
my element, 1 guess,'' said King.
Although Labrossc stopped out after freshman
year, the band continued, picking up junior Bret
Mohley on bass. The group was at first an acoustic folk
hand using mostly guitars and hongos, hut now, ac
cording to King, it has moved toward acoustic rock in-
fused with other elements.
"I think Bret's a funk bassist at heart, J.P..(Jean-Paul) has a
I background in latin percussion and mine's story-rock, said King.
The band has been busy playing in San Francisco and San Jose and
most recently at Gtfe d'Orleans in Menlo Hark, signifying a maturation in performance level.
"We've gone away from the traditional frat band to a more concert-style band," said King.
A year ago, the band members found themselves surrounded by the platinum, records lin-
Lifskada is not new to rocking parties on campus with its up-beat ska punk music and funky lyrics.
"Hie style of our music is ska, but we try to bring in other elements, like classical forms. Sometimes we rock out in a
kind of lOth century Iberian genre. We can change styles instantly," explained Paul "The Sweeper " Resnikoff, a junior
and bassist for the band.
Other members of this band are senior Tommy "Noodles" Casey on drums, senior Pat "Goodfella Enright on gui
tar, senior Kaney "The Tripper" Crump on vocals, senior Nick "Lefty" Merz on trumpet, Doug "The Spanker" Flanzer,
Lifskada
Class of 1996, on saxophone and junior Brad "The Enforcer"
Laybourne on trombone.
The group has had some strange times in coming together.
"It all started on the remote island of Fiji," explained Resnikoff,
'where I was living the fast life with choice cigars, fast women and a
Royce in the driveway. Then I realized 1 was over my credit limit."
"At that time I was also in Fiji," said Casey, "and I had been having problems with
some debts I had. Pat was in a seminary hanging out with the lead singer from Blind
Melon and leading a youth group on tour."
"Everyone knew who Tommy C. was," explained Resnikoff. "He used to go
around handing out $100 bills, even to the ugly girls. But we knew he was having
problems when he started walking around with wads of Monopoly money."
Because the band was in such dire straits, it had to leave Fiji. On the plane ride back
"we heard a golden voice in the back of the plane singing with an acoustic guitar to
this heart transplant recipient, and right then we knew she was to be our vocalist,
according to Resnikoff.
The group found Merz when he made an attempt on Resnikoffs life while dis
embarking the plane, Flanzer was"a loan shark from Milpitas" and Laybourne was
found "passed out on the stairs at Deke, with a trombone in one hand, a Keystone
Light in the other, smoking a White Owl cigar," according to Resnikoff.
The band seemed to have few problems after coming together, although inspira
tion sometimes causes a problem.
"Sometimes when we have problems musically and lyrically, we go to the desert
and wander around," said Casey. "We used to have a bari sax player, but we had to
leave him dehydrated and sunburned, rambling about the Indian souls in his body.
It's really too bad, but there just wasn't any room in the car."
Despite the large size of the group, there seems to be no problem cooperating.
"Everyone gets along perfectly," said Resnikoff. "If there is a problem, though, we
settle it by a gun duel at 30 paces — which explains the loss of our lute player.'
As for future plans, the band is uncertain right now. "It depends if our number-
running business pulls through, ex-
plained Casey. "Then we'll
decide whether we'll go
through with our
plans to tour the
Samoas."

"It was good to do an album ourselves. We wanted to do it our own
way," King said. "Once you do an album by yourselves you have a much bet

much more when he's sitting there telling you how to do things."
The band has conic a long way in the past few years and is now considering
playing music professionally. »

the experimental stages, and 1 think it's a legitimate option to play professional-

us." /

"I think Bret's a funk bassist at heart, J.P..(Jean-Paul) has a

I background in latin percussion and mine's story-rock, said King.

The band has been busy playing in San Francisco and San Jose and

most recently at Gtfe d'Orleans in Menlo Hark, signifying a maturation in performance level.
"We've gone away from the traditional frat band to a more concert-style band," said King.
A year ago, the band members found themselves surrounded by the platinum, records lin-

Lifskada is not new to rocking parties on campus with its up-beat ska punk music and funky lyrics.
"Hie style of our music is ska, but we try to bring in other elements, like classical forms. Sometimes we rock out in a
kind of lOth century Iberian genre. We can change styles instantly," explained Paul "The Sweeper " Resnikoff, a junior
and bassist for the band.
Other members of this band are senior Tommy "Noodles" Casey on drums, senior Pat "Goodfella Enright on gui

The group has had some strange times in coming together.
"It all started on the remote island of Fiji," explained Resnikoff,
'where I was living the fast life with choice cigars, fast women and a

Royce in the driveway. Then I realized 1 was over my credit limit."
"At that time I was also in Fiji," said Casey, "and I had been having problems with
some debts I had. Pat was in a seminary hanging out with the lead singer from Blind
Melon and leading a youth group on tour."
"Everyone knew who Tommy C. was," explained Resnikoff. "He used to go
around handing out $100 bills, even to the ugly girls. But we knew he was having
problems when he started walking around with wads of Monopoly money."
Because the band was in such dire straits, it had to leave Fiji. On the plane ride back
"we heard a golden voice in the back of the plane singing with an acoustic guitar to
this heart transplant recipient, and right then we knew she was to be our vocalist,
according to Resnikoff.
The group found Merz when he made an attempt on Resnikoffs life while dis
embarking the plane, Flanzer was"a loan shark from Milpitas" and Laybourne was
found "passed out on the stairs at Deke, with a trombone in one hand, a Keystone
Light in the other, smoking a White Owl cigar," according to Resnikoff.
The band seemed to have few problems after coming together, although inspira
tion sometimes causes a problem.
"Sometimes when we have problems musically and lyrically, we go to the desert
and wander around," said Casey. "We used to have a bari sax player, but we had to
leave him dehydrated and sunburned, rambling about the Indian souls in his body.
It's really too bad, but there just wasn't any room in the car."
Despite the large size of the group, there seems to be no problem cooperating.
"Everyone gets along perfectly," said Resnikoff. "If there is a problem, though, we
settle it by a gun duel at 30 paces — which explains the loss of our lute player.'
As for future plans, the band is uncertain right now. "It depends if our number-

running business pulls through, ex-

plained Casey. "Then we'll
decide whether we'll go

through with our
plans to tour the

Samoas."

"It was good to do an album ourselves. We wanted to do it our own
way," King said. "Once you do an album by yourselves you have a much bet

much more when he's sitting there telling you how to do things."

The band has conic a long way in the past few years and is now considering
playing music professionally. »

"Right now we're midway between falling and flying," said King. 'We're past
the experimental stages, and 1 think it's a legitimate option to play professional-

ly. We've got a manager and booking agents and lots of people opening doors tor

This summer the band plans to travel to Texas to record another album. Although this
