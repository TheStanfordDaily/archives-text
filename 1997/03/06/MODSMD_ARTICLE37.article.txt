# THE 						ODDS ON 'HARD EIGHT'
## Actor John C. Reilly talks about how a little naivete will go a long way 
### 
he title of the film "Hard Eight" is taken
from a bet on a particular roll of the dice
in craps; a "hard eight" is rolling double fours. In
this film, a roll of the dice is also a metaphor for
life.
"Hard Eight" is set entirely in casinos, restau
rants and hotels, transmitting a feeling of tran
sience that is reflected in the rootlessness of the
characters. It opens in a coffee house where an
aging, gentlemanly looking gambler named Syd
ney (Philip Baker Hall) meets young, down-and
out John (John C. Reilly). Sydney takes John
under his wing — among other things, helping
him arrange his mother's funeral — and two years
later, they're together in Reno. There, Sydney be
friends Clementine (Cwyneth Paltrow), a cocktail
waitress and fledgling prostitute. Meanwhile,
John is hanging out with Jimmy (Samuel L. Jack
son), a last-talking security guard who just doesn't
get along with Sydney.
Reilly said his own life has some similarities to
that of John, the character he plays. Reilly's father
died just prior to shooting the film, and Reilly's
best friend is a man in his 50s. Reilly also admits to
going through a stage in his life like that of his un
worldly, trusting alter ego.
"1 still am kind of a naive person," he said. "But
you know, a little hit of naivete is good. [Film
makers] keep seeming to cast me in these parts
where I'm incredibly naive or innocent. I think
I'm a pretty savvy customer. , . . It's probably be
cause I usually take people at face value. I think it's
positive, though, to be kind of naive. It makes it a
lot easier to get out of bed in the morning, any
way!"
Although Reilly has had small parts in "Hoffa,"
"What's Eating Gilbert Grape," "The River Wild"
and "Dolores Claiborne," John in "Hard Eight" is
his first major role.
"Hard Eight" is also the feature film debut of
writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. Reilly
met Anderson at the Sundance Filmmaker's Lab, a
forum where first-time writer-directors work
with professional actors and technicians. At this
time, Anderson was "getting his [directing] feet
wet," Reilly said.
"We'd take little trips up to Reno and Vegas,

Paul and I," he said. "We'd have different read
throughs and rehearsals. Paul just loves to get me
going, improvising one thing or another. Paul has
a knack for capturing the little interesting details
in people's behavior. He would take something 1
did and go, 'Oh that's great, that's great, what you
just did,' and he would put it into the script. So I
had to be careful, after a while, what I did in front
of Paul."
After having worked with high-profile direc
tors such as Woody Allen ("Shadows and Fog")
and Brian DePalma ("Casualties of War"), Reilly
described working with first-timer Anderson as
"different in a good way."
"He's got a real freshness and energy," he said.
"Part of that comes with it being his first time.
He's a natural at directing. He has a real intuitive
sense of the actors, and he's a very sensitive per
son. When it comes to emotional stuff he could
sense what's going on. He could tell when he
wanted to do another take — what to say, which is
rare. Most importantly, he's a good audience.
There has to be one person somewhere in that
crowd or behind the camera who's really engaged
in what you're doing and is really excited and lis
tening, and Paul is definitely that. He loves to
watch actors act."
Reilly has just wrapped up a role in Anderson's
second film, "Boogie Nights," which is about the
adult film industry.
In "Hard Eight," Reilly co-stars with seasoned
actors like Jackson and Hall, as well as Paltrow,
who plays his love interest.
"Gwyneth is a really fun person to be with,"
Reilly said. "She has so much energy and she's a
very quick wit. She's one of those people [that] if
you say something stupid, she'll nail you."
Although Paltrow has recently received much
media attention for her role in "Emma" (among
other things), she was a relative unknown when
"Hard Eight" began filming. Of the seven films she
had completed, only one had been released.
"At the time that we shot the movie it was a re
ally exciting time for her [because] she was really
just starting to come into her own," Reilly said.
"The only film of hers that had been released at
that point was, I think, 'Flesh and Bone.' So she

was really just kind of exploding onto the scene at
that point."
Reilly felt that the role of Clementine is one of
the few Paltrow has had that is equal to her tal
ents.
"A lot of people would get caught up in that
stuff — the publicity, all the attention — but she,
at the bottom of it all, is a really good actress and
knows why she's in the business to begin with," he
said. "And all this other stuff, this publicity and
everything, I think just serves that purpose . ..
that her acting is what it's all about."
Because he was the only bankable cast member
at the time, Samuel L. Jackson helped the film ob
tain financing. Reilly described Jackson as a great
Storyteller.
"We traded back and forth location horror sto
ries from making movies," he said. "He's just a
very positive, easygoing person [and a| very funny
actor."
Jackson's character, Jimmy, is a Hashy gangster
type who precipitates the film's explosiveness, and
not only because his character is the only one who
owns any firearms.
Knowledgeable, distinguished and well-spo
ken, John's mentor, Sydney, is the polar opposite
of Jimmy. Sydney is played by Hall, a veteran of
many television and film roles, including one in
Robert Alt man's "Secret Honor."
Reilly described Hall the person as very similar
to Sydney the character: "After a while, he and I
developed a relationship similar to the one we
have in the movie. Philip is like the eye of the
storm. When the shit is hitting the fan, Philip is
the one calm person in all of it. It was like all these
people running around trying to pull this miracle
off, and Philip really relaxed people. He's a very
wise person."
Given that "Hard Eight" is a writer-director's
debut and features few high-profile stars, one
could consider it a miracle that the film ever got
off the ground. But Reilly disagreed that "Hard
Eight" is a special case.
"Every film's a miracle," he said. "Every turn
there's a million things that could go wrong, from
the very beginning of the film to the very end." O
