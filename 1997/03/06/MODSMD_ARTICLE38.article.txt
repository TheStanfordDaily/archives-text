Ira Nair has just gotten off a plane when she ar
rives in the hotel lobby. She's late, she's tired, she's
P w p hungry. And she's only spending 24 hours in San
Francisco before heading off to Japan. This city-hopping is all
part of a two-week, intensive tour she's doing to publicize her
new movie, "Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love." The miracle is that
amid all the chaos she remains perfectly calm.
Although Nair describes herself as proudly Indian, the
writer / director / producer lives in South Africa and has re
ceived international acclaim for her films "Salaam Bombay"
(19K6), "Mississippi Masala" (1991) and"The Perez Family"
(1993).
Her films are committed to investigating the forbidden, and
the one that she is in San Francisco to discuss is no exception.
Superficially, "Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love" is just that — a
story of love and jealousy about two lifelong friends, princess
to-be Tara (Sarita Choudhury) and Maya (Indira Varma),
whose future in 16th-century India promises only servitude.
Deep-seated resentments culminate in betrayal, which sets in
motion a vicious love triangle promising ecstasy and misery to
the bitter end.
The film transcends its mediocre dialogue with visual opu
lence and sensuous erotica — among the most beautiful scenes
of silk saris, Indian landscapes and people sharing their bodies
ever to be captured on film. Ultimately, "Kama Sutra: A Tale of
Love" has the emotional poignancy to inspire any viewer with
a heart to place an immediate call to Air India.
Intermission: For this film you have taken a eue from ancient
Indian texts and culture. What made you want to go hack so far
in time and reconstruct history?
Mira Nair: The main inspiration to go back was to counter
the obscenity and the perversity with which I see women being
treated on Indian and international screens. And not just
women but also sexuality.
In this country it's like sex is always a spectator sport. De
void of any kind of emotion. In India, sexuality is taboo, but in
the guise of not showing it, it's cloaked through rape and vio
lence and a very twisted view of women — a very strange sort
of dichotomy between the virgin and the whore. Woe betide
any woman who is to express herself sexually.

So we thought we'd go back to a time in our own civilizatior
which took love very seriously, which studied love, which stud
ied the art of love and sexuality. But while being non-moralis
tic about it, in that sex without love could be practiced it voi
wish, this is the art of pretense. Sex with love, if dealt with in ;
careful manner, is a link to the divine. Eros is a spiritual thing.
So with that in mind, we ended up writing a film that wa:
not really about sexual positions, but more about sexual poli
tics between men and women. [We didn't want] to make a filn
that was a removed piece of work, something that was a histor
ical museum piece on India, but something that you and I
could relate to — you know, San Francisco, India, wherever —

in terms of the games men and women play—which
are the same, then or now. It's just the attitudes to
ward them that are different.
I: You've been quoted saying thai "to be utterly
modern is to embrace the truly ancient." After delving
into the ancient world, what perspective does that give
you on the modern?
MN: Just how far we have come from this inex
tricable combination of sensuality with sacredness,
which we had in the past. And how paradoxical India
is because to the eye you don't see any kind of natur
al or organic expression of sensuality in India.
But on the way to location every day, in a small
Indian village in Central India where I lived while
making the film, at the base of every banyan tree
there was a statue of the lingam and the yoni — the

male phallus and the female vagina — with fresh
flowers and incense. Hvery day this kind of male-female union
is worshipped as sacred. And that is such a paradox that the
essence ofwhat I am trying to strive for is part of an ancient tra
dition, hut the inspiration to make the film was a reaction to
what 1 didn't see on our screen.
I: You've said that "eroticism is rarely about flesh or nudity,"
which seems incongruent to me with the focus on the body in this
film.
MN: 1 don't mean that nudity is not erotic. I mean that the
way it's handled is the point. Just to show flesh, like in "Basic
Instinct," like a meat market, is completely un-erotic.
I: The eroticism in your film has caused quite a bit of contro
versy, especially in your native country of India. Can you tell me

n about the struggle you've had to get the film released there?
I- MN: It's taken a long time — four months to fight the bat
i- tie with the censor board of India. They basically wanted to re
u move all the sexuality from the film, so I said to them, "This
a would then be no longer the film I made."
So India still being the working democracy it is, I took the
is case against the censor board to the Supreme Court of India,
i- the appellate tribunal, and had a much more enlightened hear
-11 ing from the court.
Now they have passed the film with slightly over two min
-1 utes cut, which are cuts that I generally expected and one cut I
lament, but basically it restored the movie. And it's opening all

over India in a very big release on March 21.
/: Has there been any controversy over the film in the United
States as well?
MN: The MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)
took a very similar stance: They gave it an NC-17. But the stu
dio has chosen to release it unrated, and for the video version
we're going to make almost exactly the same cuts as for the In
dian version — two minutes.
I find it a little bit of a double standard. Any minute you can
have a woman with her breasts exposed, with a knife on her
back and leather, but woe betide you if you kiss that nipple.
|It's] very peculiar. I don't know what [the reception] will be
like here; it's been really good (so far j.
/: How do you anticipate the movie's reception in India?
MN: There's |been| so much press about it. Reporters in m\
living room when I wake up — I mean it's just too much. And
there's a hell of a lot of awareness about the whole battle and
controversy. There's almost too much hype.
I'm pretty nervous, but also curious about what will hap
pen. One contractual condition I've asked for, as part of the
sale in Indian territory, is that three times a week we have to
have all-women shows, three matinees a week, all over the
country.
[The reason is j because the Kama Sutra is a very misunder
stood text. Everybody thinks its just a fuck-fest, sexual-posi
tion thing. But it's not, it's a completely philosophical, matter
of-fact treatise on men and women.
The film is essentially about lessons about love, so 1 feel
[that] the film is very true to the real meaning of the Kama
Sutra. But it is not how people would ordinarih understand
• u.. i" c..._, 1- 4:- t .

the Kama Sutra, even in India. So
therefore it's like a practical flag to
wave — to make it for women only,
the three screenings. It would give
the message that the film is not
pornography in a very clear way, and
it really works very well with
women.
I: Since this movie is presenting sex
utility from the female perspective, do
you think it is something that men can
relate to ami participate in?
MN: I think they can partici
pate. I'm not a separatist at all in
spirit, life or — 1 hope not — in my
work. I choosej female protago
nists fora reason. That was the in
tention — you can t do everything.
Having said that, I don't believe
that only women can understand
this and men cannot. We all have
humanity; this [film is common
to humanity.
I: I think it's very interesting that
the film ami the hook approach eroti
ca as something that is worth being
taught and learned. It reminded me in

a strange way of the American debate on sex education. Is it your
opinion that sexuality ami erotica is a worthwhile subject of edu
cation?
MN: In a holistic way. I actually met a person on the tour
who said that she would recommend this film tor every hit;h
school. Go for it!
I think one of the essential problems here is that | erotica j is
so compartmentalized. This is your life and then you deal v\ ith
the sensual realm separately. Like I've often said, the real idea
with Eros in this film is to make it about the mundane. Hros has
to be in the mundane, in the banal things. tJ
