## The 						Offspring "Ixnay on the Hombre" 
### 
Having taken a three-year rest after
its 1994 release, "Smash," The Offspring are
back with a new label, a new album and the
same old punk-rock attitude. "Ixnay on the
Hombre," the group's fourth album, is a bril
liant mesh of what got The Offspring here
and lots of new sounds as well — exactly
what fans demand.
Singer Dexter Holland sounds even
better than he did on earlier recordings,
pushing The Offspring to their musical
limits. "Ixnay" is the group's best release
yet.
After opening with the playfully sarcastic
"Disclaimer," in which Jcllo Biafra reads,
"This American, apple-pie institution
known as parental discretion will cleanse any
sense of innuendo or sarcasm from the lyrics
that might actually make you think," the
album kicks off the music with the hyper
charged "The Meaning of Life."
"Meaning of Life" sets the tone for what is
to come; it hits the listener with a blast of clas
sic The Offspring formula — a pedal-to-the
medal rhythm section that is hastily joined by
frantic guitar chords. The pissed-off lyrics,
hollered by Holland, round out the song —
one of best on "Ixnay," along with "All 1
Want."
Military beat drums introduce the next
number, "Mota." Remember the line "ya
gotta keep 'em separated" from the hit sin
gle "Come out and Play"? Well, in a similar
fashion, we hear some guy commenting
"mota!" between riffs. Sure, it's cliched —
they did it before and, yep, they did it again.
It's hard to complain, though, because it

still works to perfection.
"Me & My Old Lady," is a new twist on
the traditional Middle Eastern influences
within The Offspring's sound, while
"Cool to Hate" is a great demonstration of
what makes a song punk. "I hate teach
ers / 1 hate school / I hate the cheerleaders
and anyone who's cool .... yeah I hate
everything / 1 even hate you / so fuck

you," Holland
shouts.
Funk rock
ers will find it
hard to criti
cize the album
because The
Offspring hit
the nail on the
head with this
one. While
sustaining a
hard rock feel,
they incorpo
rate some slow
songs —
"Gone Away"
and "Amazed"
— which fit
like a glove in
between the
faster songs.
The one ba
nana-peel slip
of "Ixnay" is "1
Choose," a re
ally weak pop
tune with con-

gas and cheesy vocals.
There's something for just about every
body — "Way Down the Line" is beer
bash, punk rock NOFX-style, while
"Don't Pick It Up" is a sizzling ska dance
sensation. If you've ever liked anything
having to do with The Offspring, just get
the album.
