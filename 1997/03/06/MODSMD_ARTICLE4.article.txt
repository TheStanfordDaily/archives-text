## Known for work in population 
### Ann Kim 
Kingsley Davis, a senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution who studied demography and
sociological phenomena died last Thursday at 88.
He suffered from Parkinson's disease for several
years.
Davis was internationally recognized for his ex
pertise in world population growth and resources,
the history and theory of international migration,
world urbanization, demographic transition and
population policy.
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian de
scribed Davis as "an intellectual leader and innova
tor in his discipline. He is someone we at Hoover and
all demographers and sociologists will miss."
Senior fellow Rita Ricardo-Campbell recounted
how a casual discussion with Davis over coffee led to
their collaboration to organize an international con
ference and editing a book on non-replacement fer
tility.
"He was very intelligent and a delightful person to
be with," said Ricardo-Campbell.
A graduate of the University of Texas, Davis re
ceived his doctoral degree from Harvard University.
He held teaching positions at Penn State, Princeton
University, Columbia University, UC-Berkeley and
USC before his appointment as a Hoover fellow in
1981.
In 1966 Davis became the first sociologist to be
elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He rep
resented the United States on the United Nations
Population Commission and was a member of the
Advisory Council of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
He also served as president of the Population Associ
ation of America and the American Sociological As
sociation.
Davis was a sought-after consultant on popula
tion policies and demographic information, provid-
ing his expertise on fertility con
trol policies to India, Nepal,
Bahrain and Latin American
countries
Davis was the recipient of the
Irene B. Taeuber Award for out
standing research in demography,
the Commonwealth Award for dis

tinguished work in sociology and
the Career of Distinguished Schol
arship Award from the American
Sociological Association.
"Kingsley Davis was a very dis
tinguished population expert, a
man of very wide intellectual in
terests â€” the type they don't pro
duce anymore," said W. Glenn
Campbell, a senior Hoover fellow
who served as the Institution's di
rector until 1989.
Davis' work has appeared in

Scientific American, Science Mag
azine, The New York Times Mag
azine, Foreign Affairs and numer
ous newspapers.
Davis has published books on
topics like the population of India
and Pakistan, world urbaniza
tion and the impact of the growth
of cities on human society.
Davis is survived by his wife,
four children and two grandchil
dren. A private service will be held
tomorrow.
