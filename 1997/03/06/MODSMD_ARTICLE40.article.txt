# Ben Vaughn
## "Rambler 65" 
### 
Over the course of my admittedly short life,
I have learned that strange people come in two
categories. The first group is composed of es
sentially normal people who, for various rea
sons, go out of their way to make the world
think that they are just plain nuts (see They
Might Be Giants, the Stanford Band, etc.). The
other group consists of the truly disturbed, no
acting necessary. Indeed, they might not even
think of themselves as strange (see Prince, the
Stanford Band's staff, etc.).
Ben Vaughn falls decidedly into this second
category. "Rambler '65," his new album, is
aptly titled: The entire thing was recorded in a
1965 Rambler American.
Why? That is a very good question, one
which the album's packaging chooses not to
answer. Except for "Heavy Machinery," in
which the Rambler's engine serves as percus
sion, recording in a 30-year-old car seems to
have had little effect.
If this is just a publicity stunt, it's not even a
very good one. Further, Vaughn plays virtual
ly every instrument on the album, giving the
work even more of a crazed-man-in-the
wildcrness feel.

However, what might be most surprising
about "Rambler '65" is that the music is noth
ing less than brilliant. Possessing a rich knowl
edge of rock's past, Vaughn flashes his influ
ences as if he has something to prove. From
surf ("Piston Search") to psychedelia ("Levita
tion") to Cajun ("Boomerang"), his stylistic
range is indeed impressive.
When Vaughn turns his attention to meat
and-potatoes rock 'n' roll (as in Buddy Holly
and Chuck Berry), the sound is confident and
believable, as on "7 Days Without Love" and
the hilarious "Rock Is Dead." Vaughn's music
may be derivative, but the respect he has for his
roots is obvious.
Moreover, Vaughn has a special gift for
painful country-blues ballads, such as the gor
geous "Too Much Sorrow." On "Song For
You," he even adds synthesized rhythms, creat
ing what could only be described as techno
country.
I told you he was strange.
Unfortunately, like many genuinely weird
people, Vaughn might never get the main
stream attention he deserves because he's just
so unusual.

Give Ben Vaughn a chance. His musical
ideas are just too strange to shrug off.
