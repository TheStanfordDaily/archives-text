## "Marcy Playground" 
### 
The self-titled debut release from Marcy
Playground sounds like classic rock 'n' roll
as written by children of the 1970s who be
came teen-agers of the early '80s, which it
was. But "Marcy Playground" is also in
fused with the neo-folkand groove sensibil
ities of popular 1990s alt-rock, creating an
interesting fusion of sounds.
Heavy clod-stomping ballads and mel
lifluous acoustic tracks slide beneath lyrics
about drugs, women and death. Frontman
John Wozniak, who wrote all the lyrics and
plays guitar on the album, handles the
singing as well with a deft, pop-tinged
voice.
Although he occasionally comes up
with searingly precise lines such as "I smell
sex and / candy here," (from "Sex and
Candy"), as often as not he fails to engage
the listener in intense, emotionally satisfy
ing lyrics.
Wozniak named the band in tribute to
his "experimental hippie" elementary
school, the Marcy Open School in Min
neapolis. "From the window I could see the
whole playground and everyone in it," he's
written. "Fverything happening at once. I
made up stories about what I saw."
The trio is filled out by bassist Dylan
Keefe and drummer Jared Kotler, who cre
ate a smooth and grooving rhythm section
for Wozniak's sometimes not-so-technical
guitar work.
The blend of electrified power chords
and arpeggiated acoustic lead guitar hint at
some driving musicality that just doesn't
get fully explored. The smooth, dreamy bal
lad "Ancient Walls of Flowers," makes simi
lar tracks like "Sherry Fraser" and "Gone
Crazy" seem like badly done, unnecessary
reproductions.
Four of the songs on the album are about
the drive for individuality, which becomes
almost self-defeating; grunge anthem "The
Shadow of Seattle" takes a poetic form
equals-content approach but doesn't sound
like authentic angst about the state of "art"
in society. This approach is more successful
in the hazy track "Opium."
I come away from this album wondering
if there is something concrete the band
wanted to communicate with its music, or if
they should want to — because its music is
much better when the band lets itself have
fun, such as on tracks like "Poppies" (an
other opium song) and"The Vampires of
New York."
"Marcy Playground" vaguely sketches
the structure of the band's own moral and
ethical worldview through subject material
that does not have nearly enough fullness to
be credible. In the end, I'm not sure if
"Marcy Playground" tries to do too much
or not enough.
