## "Brighten the Corners" 
### 
The band Pavement has been an indie
favorite for several years, and despite a
few videos, a Loilapalooza slot and four
critically acclaimed albums, it still hasn't
really found wide success beyond that
core audience. Well, it's the mainstream's
loss — as "Brighten The Corners" aptly
demonstrates, Pavement puts out the
kind of music that alterna-radio bands
of the week only dream about.
Indie-pop is a cliched term, to be sure,
but it's actually a damned good way to
describe this band: Beneath overall
looseness of form and 10-fi dissonance
lurks a strong current of tight, infectious
pop.
In "Transport Is Arranged," singer
Stephen Malkmus sings, "A voice coach
taught me to sing / he couldn't teach me
to love," but he's only kidding — Malk
mus' sardonic, somewhat atonal vocals
aren't going to be mistaken for Placido
Domingo anytime soon. But any lack of
polish is more than made up for by his
strong sense of melody and a gift for
lyrics that are at once insightful, witty
and yet somewhat opaque.

This sioppy-yet-catchy ethic plays
through the music as well. "Brighten
the Corners," like most of the Pave
ment music I've heard, has a relaxed,
jammy feel to it, a rough-around-the
corners fuzziness that borrows widely
from 1960s classic rock and other
indie bands, creating a sound that
contrasts sharply with the tight licks
and seamless melodies that character
ize most of today's so-called "alterna
tive" music.
That's not to say this is Phish or the
Grateful Dead: Pavement knows how to
rock when it needs to, and the members*
astute pop sensibility keeps the jams
from getting too far afield.
There seem to be a number of bands
on the radio today who, rather than
"rocking out," seem to be aiming fora
more relaxed feel. Most of them could
learn a lot from this album.
Sarcastic yet sympathetic, 10-fi but fo
cused, "Brighten the Corners" is yet an
other tasty morsel of pop craftsmanship
from a talented band.
