# Bad Livers
## "Hogs on the Highway" 
### 
You're living in Austin, Texas, a mecca of
new music, but you're entranced by the tra
ditional bluegrass style pioneered by (of
course) Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs, Doc
Watson and others. How do you solve this
dilemma? If you're Danny Barnes, Mark
Rubin and Ralph White, you form the Bad
Livers and make music that can best be de
scribed as bluegrass with a punk sensibility.
On their third album, "Hogs on the
Highway," the Bad Livers have added the
mandolin and guitar services of Bob Grant
to complement Barnes' banjo picking,
White's fast and furious fiddle playing and
Rubin's string bass and occasional tuba.
(That's right, tuba. I told you this wasn't
your traditional bluegrass band.) The addi
tion of Grant hasn't changed them a bit,
though; they continue to produce their
characteristic, excellent, twisted bluegrass.
It's not that they stray vastly from the
genre of bluegrass, for the first-time listen
er can easily peg their music as belonging to
that genre. But on further listening, the
nasal vocals of Barnes combine with all the
instrumental twists the Bad Livers throw in
— within the boundaries of bluegrass —
and the realization grows that it isn't just
bluegrass; it's something more, something
better, something weirder.
For example, take "Hogs on the High

way," the title cut from the album: The song
starts out with a cozy, down-home, wel
coming feel: classic bluegrass. But then
Barnes' nasal yet melodic vocals come in —
"Hogs on the highway, sows in the
street / There's a tramp at the backdoor to
wash his dirty feet / Garden hose is busted
and my pocket sprung a leak" — and the
phrase "twisted, yet genius" percolates in
the back of your mind.
"Lathe Crick" follows and quickly that
percolating phrase pops right to the front,
driven by the lazy bluegrass sounds backed
by an "oompah" tuba and the stilted
melody and vocal delivery.
That's not to say the Bad Livers can't or
don't go the traditional route. "Count the
Ties," "News not the Weather" and "Corn
Liquor Made a Fool Out of Me" — with its
great fiddle work and the lyrics "Tell the
lx>ys I'm doing so much better / But I sure
could use their company / I ain't had a
drink since Monday / Corn liquor made a
fool out of me" — are harmonious, peace
ful and very pretty examples of fine blue
grass playing.
With the Bad Livers, it's definitely blue
grass, but at the same time the punk atti
tude is peeking out from underneath the
covers.
