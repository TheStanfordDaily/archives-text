# Voodoo Glow Skulls
## "Baile De Los Locos" 
### 
You want ska? You want something faster,
harder and crazier than that usual mellow
crap? The Voodoo Glow Skulls are here to
satisfy your every desire.
A seven-piece Southern California band
with the typical ska lineup (guitar, bass,
drums, vocals and horn section), the Glow
Skulls combine the melodies of Skankin'
Pickle and the Pietasters with the speed and
punk ferocity of Hiisker DO.
The result is a mix of highly distorted ska /
punk guitar, mostly unintelligible shouted
vocals and horn lines so fast you won't be
lieve it.
On "Baile De Los Locos," the Glow Skulls'
third album, they remain true to form,
adding quirky rhythmic twists and more
shout-along choruses.
The title track is a rompin', stompin' cele
bration of insanity sung in Spanish with a
uniquely catchy chorus. "Los Hombres No
Lloran" ("Men Don't Cry") is a slower in
strumental, with several tuneful solos,
demonstrating that Joe (trumpet), Brodie
(trombone) and Joey (sax) can not only play
fast but also melodically.
"Feliz Navidad," a happy-go-lucky
cover of the Christmas song and perhaps
the best track on the album, alternates be-

L.
tween a party-esque verse and a thrashv
chorus.
Unfortunately not all of the songs on
"Baile De Los Locos" are of this caliber.
"Here We Are Again," "My Soul Is Sick," and
"Bulletproof" are all essentially mediocre
songs, repetitive and not thematically in
spired (although "Bulletproof" does contain
several amusing movie samples).
The song "Elephantitis* is painfully juve
nile, with the chorus "I've got elephantitis of
the nuts" becoming more and more irritat
ing with each listening. One wonders if, like
Beavis and Butthead, the Glow Skulls still
find words like "butt" funny.
At first, you might think it unusual to have
a band that alternates between songs in
Spanish and English (the Glow Skulls put out
both an English and a Spanish version of
their second album, "Firme," last year), but
because the vocals are difficult to understand
anyway, this is not really a problem.
Although "Baile De Los Locos" is decid
edly mediocre, this album will still shake and
confuse the hell out of you.
If you want hardcore but can't do without
some sort of melody, the Glow Skulls are
your band.
