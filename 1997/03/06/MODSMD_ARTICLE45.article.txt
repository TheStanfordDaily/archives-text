## Donnie Brasco 
### 
Based on movies I have seen, here are a few of the "defin
ing" characteristics of people in the Mafia: shiny Cadillacs,
tinted sunglasses, thick New York accents, obesity, slicked (or
else nonexistent) hair, foul language, tobacco addictions,
black leather clothing and lots of drinking.
The audience easily identifies all of the "bad guys" who
have this type of image, but is it really necessary to propagate
the same-old stereotypes over and over again? I hate to say it,
but "Donnie Brasco" has essentially strung together such
cliches into a 121-minute exercise about the mixing of the
underworld and law enforcement.
This is the prototypical fish-out-of-water story with a

tragic hero inserted at the center. Playing the central charac
ter of Joe Pistone, Johnny Depp does a sufficiently fresh take
on the "wholesome" character, in this case an FBI agent, who
realizes that he does have a darker side to his personality. He
even openly admits to his wife, Maggie (Anne Heche), that he
likes the new lifestyle of the gangster; she responds by letting
him know that she wants a divorce because he has become
one of "them."
The fact that this is a true story makes this movie experi
ence even more frustrating. "Donnie Brasco" could have
been a truly engrossing and Oscar-caliber film — this prob
ably explains its early-in-the-year release date. One of its four
producers, Barry Levinson, has worked on many critically
acclaimed films, including "Rain Man" and "Sleepers." Per
haps the multitude of people producing the film could ex
plain its lack of focus and originality.
Or some of the fault could lie with the director, Mike
Newell, who also directed the delightfully funny film, "Four
Weddings and a Funeral" — he is apparently not cut out to

make serious and provocative dramas.
After the film came an eerie silence, most likely used
by the moviegoers (including myself) to figure out why
someone would want to see this movie. It is unnecessar
ily bloody and violent at times, and, of course, there is
the abundance of profanity. One scene, in particular,
sticks out in my mind: One gang, led by Lefty (Al Pacino
in a typical role), takes out a rival faction with a smatter
ing of bullets and angry words, then proceeds to saw
their legs off in blood-splattering detail. We did not need
to see that to understand the point of conflicting hierar
chies and gangs.
Yet there were constant laughs throughout the film, even
at the most tense and climactic moments. I had high hopes
for this movie after seeing the commercial and the critical ac
claim surrounding it. Hut this one just does not have the
quality some other gangster films have. I'd suggest renting
"Goodfellas" or "Casino" instead.
