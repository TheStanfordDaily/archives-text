# Rosewood

### 
Based on a true story, "Rosewood" focuses
on a central Florida town in 1923. It's 75 years
after the abolition of slavery, but the brutal ef
fects of racial hatred are far from over. "Rose
wood" is a powerful film about that tragic vic
timization ofblack people.
Rosewood is a flourishing town populated
and maintained by blacks with the exception of
the town storeowner, John Wright (Jon
Voight). The town's comfortable lifestyle is ru
ined, however, when a white woman named
Fanny Taylor (Catherine Kellner) from the
neighboring town of Sumner makes the false
claim that she was beaten by a black man. The
white men of Sumner use the allegation an ex
cuse to demonstrate their anger toward the
people of Rosewood.
During the next week. Rosewood becomes
a disaster area as the search for the nonexistent
perpetrator turns into a massacre. What starts
off as a lynch mob explodes into an army of
men from neighboring counties who are pre
pared to gun down any black people on sight.
The women and children of Rosewood are
forced to hide in the surrounding swamps, led

by Mr. Mann (Ving Rhames), a mysterious ex
soldier and newcomer to Rosewood. Mann
and Wright soon hatch a plan to bring the sur

vivors to safety.
My only complaint about the film is that it
begins with 15 minutes of dry character intro

ductions and stereotypical scenes of the South
in the 19205. But from the moment Fanny Tay
lor runs screaming from her house the movie
grips its audience with increasing emotion.
The plot of "Rosewood" is supported by
some notable acting jobs. Don Cheadle speaks
for Rosewood as Sylvester Carrier, a man who
would rather take a stand and fight than run.
Michael Rooker is the frustrating Sheriff Walk
er, who fails to exercise control over the people
of Sumner while pretending to lead them.
Rhames also delivers a powerful presence, al
though it is apparent that his range of emo
tions is limited.
John Singleton, the film's director, does an
excellent job of portraying the random vio
lence and the burning town. The unique set
ting of the Florida marshlands is ironically pic
turesque.
"Rosewood" raises many questions about
the South in the early 20th century. More im
portant, the movie expresses the courage, dig
nity and eventual triumph of a group of black
Americans in one of their darkest hours.
