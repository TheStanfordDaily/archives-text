## Shall we dance? 
### 
I love dancing and 1 love movies. Put
them together properly and you get
"Saturday Night Fever," "Dirty Danc
ing" and "Strictly Ballroom." Screw up
the recipe and you get "Swing Kids
and "Shag."

"Saturday Night Fever" (1977).
What's left to be said about this classic
of the '70s? Tony Manero, played by a
young John Travolta, rips up the dance
floor, breaks hearts and tries to break
out of his lower-class existence by be
coming king of the discotheque. Lots
of the Bee Gees and lots of strutting

around in bell-bottoms.
Then there's the dancing movie of the '80s
"Dirty Dancing" (1987), every teeny-bop

per's dream (or at least mine). In case you've
forgotten the plot despite the dozens of times
you watched it at slumber parties, here's a lit
tle re-cap: Patrick Swayze is in full form as
Johnny Castle, the dance instructor at a posh
Catskills resort. When his dance partner be-

comes indis
posed, it's time for
Baby (pre-nose
job Jennifer

Grey), an idealis
tic upper-class tomboy, to step in. With half
its running time spent dancing, an unbeat
able soundtrack and a happy ending, this is
the dance movie at its best.
Then, two years later, a little movie called
"Shag" was released. Basically a weak attempt
to capitalize on "Dirty Dancing," (a note on
the video's cover brags that two films share a
choreographer), it just doesn't rank. Three
girls take their engaged friend Carson
(Phoebe Cates) on a sinful binge in Myrtle

Beach and all four of them hook up. The few
dancing scenes in the movie has are random,
including spontaneous shagging at a drive-in
and the conclusion when everyone is racing to
a shag contest for some reason. Ignoring the
plot's stupidity, "Shag" fails as a dance movie
because the dancing doesn't have any mean
ing. In both "Saturday Night Fever" and
"Dirty Dancing," dance was a form of rebel
lion and escape for the main characters.
"Swing Kids" (1993), in which young Ger
mans who don't want to become Nazis dance
the night away to Count Basie and Benny
Goodman, seems to fulfill this requirement. I
must admit that I liked the movie when it
came out because I loved the dancing, wanted
the World War 11-era clothes and, well, I also
wanted Christian Bale. But after watching it
again recently I realized that the dancing
movie formula doesn't work here. It's also
kind of hard to take Kenneth Branagh seri
ously when he is delivering melodramatic di

alogue in English with a German accent to a
whimpering Robert Sean Leonard.
"Strictly Ballroom" is an Australian "Dirty
Dancing" (I would say "for the '905," but de
spite the fact that it came out in 1995, it has a
strong '80s flavor with Cyndi Lauper on the
soundtrack and too-glossy lipstick on the ac
tresses). An ugly duckling (Tara Morice) blos
soms in the arms of her teacher (Paul Mercu
rio); ultimately they prove both their families
wrong and shake up the ballroom dance
world. The dancing is nicely filmed, although
sometimes it killed me that they showed the
actors gazing into each others' eyes instead of
the great footwork. Overall, it's an entertain
ing comedy edited at a snappy pace and filled
with snappy dialogue.
If you're in the mood to dance, check a few
of these films out on video. All except for
"Shag" contain decent moves, some of which
might be worth trying at the next Jammix.
