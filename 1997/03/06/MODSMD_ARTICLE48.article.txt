## The 						good, the bad and the critic Samuel Park 
### 
I hate critics. Hate anyone who goes to
the theater with a pen and paper rather
than an open mind and ready heart. Hate
anyone who will dismiss someone's work
with a too clever epigram or a sentence
carelessly thrown aside, lacing the end of a
paragraph with cyanide. Hate anyone who
would rather tear apart a piece in print
than put together a production from
scratch. The latter is an artist; the former is
a hack.
Yes, I hate critics. Except, of course,
when I'm the critic. When I write a review
of a play fora publication or a class, I
shamefacedly develop a Janus syndrome
and hop on to the other side. I fool myself
into believing I'm upholding some higher
standards of quality and beauty, and I try to

say something meaningful about a work.
"Every writer wants at some time to be a
critic," writes William Zinsser, formerly of
the New York Herald Tribune, in his book
"On Writing Well." Of course! Why not?
When you're a critic, your opinion is the
key to the kingdom. It's all that matters.
And all you depend on is your wit, taste and
cleverness. You also depend on your arro
gance. Criticism is an inherently arrogant
act. You're saying that you could think of a
better way of doing something. That they
did it wrong. They misunderstood what
Chekhov meant in that one line. You're di
rector, literary critic, interpreter, visionary
and actor, all at once.
For that one moment, for that one page,
the entire efforts of the theatrical company

are put under the scrutiny of your opinion,
and become secondary to your writing, as
subject, rather than the thing itself. What a
thrill.
But then why is it that no one remembers
George Kaufman, the critic, only George
Kaufman, the playwright? Dorothy Parker's
witticisms are well known, but her work as
a poet is far better appreciated than any of
her reviews. The same is true of any num
ber of critics-turned-writers.
If a play moves or touches me, I feel the
impulse to discuss it endlessly. I enjoy it al
most as much as creating something my
self. Like the ancient mariner, I want to im
press the importance of my experience to
everyone else and have them go through the
same feelings and emotions that I did. It's

only natural to want to write about a work
that means something to you.
And the best critics are those who are
deeply in love with their subjects, like
Pauline Kael, formerly of The New Yorker.
Or former Esquire critic John Simon, who,
when asked why so many of his reviews
were negative, replied that it was because he
loved movies so much that his standards in
evitably became higher.
It's easy to accuse critics of being too
harsh or out of touch. But they may be a
necessary evil, one that's often found in our
own selves. This week a piece that I wrote
will open in the Drama Department. I'm
not sure if I'll care what any critics may say,
although I do know one whose opinion will
mean a lot to me.
