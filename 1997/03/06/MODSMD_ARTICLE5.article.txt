Sophomore Ann Karash quit smoking. Almost.
Karash used to smoke a couple of packs a week, but
now limits herself to just one cigarette per month for im
proved health. She usually indulges while hanging out
with friends behind the Coffee House.
"I'll usually smoke when I'm stressing out or having
an emotional collapse," she said. "Smoking is a 15
minute release. With certain friends, it's like, 'Let's relax
and have a cigarette.'"
Karash fits into a group that's become rather com
mon at Stanford: recreational smokers. They tend to
bum cigarettes off of other people, as opposed to buying
them themselves. They often don't consider themselves
smokers because they just smoke occasionally with
friends or at parties.
"It's something to do," said Elise Lenox, director of
the Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Program at
Cowell Health Center. "You have a drink in one hand,
and a cigarette sits so nicely in the other."
Lenox's program conducted surveys of smoking
trends among Stanford students in 1994 and 1995. Both
surveys showed similar results. Thirty percent of stu
dents reported using tobacco in the last year, while only

3 percent said they were daily smokers, meaning about
27 percent of students fit somewhere in the recreational
smoking range.
Reasons for tobacco use vary largely by gender, Lenox
said. Males tend to chew tobacco on the athletic field,
whereas women smoke cigarettes in social arenas and to
improve body image.
"What I hear from women is weight control, appetite
suppressing effects, she said.
Lenox said she thinks most Stanford smokers are fe
males and that many are influenced to start smoking by
industry advertising.
"There's no doubt the industiy is targeting women
much more than in the past," she said. "I believe women
smoking is based on media impact."
The prevalence of recreational smoking among
women on the fitness-oriented Stanford campus has
caused confusion for Lenox.
"Something we question at Cowell is the Stanford
community is somewhat obsessed with body image,
health and fitness. Recreational smoking contradicts
that and it frustrates us," she said.
International students make up a large percentage of
Stanford smokers, as well. In many countries, smoking
