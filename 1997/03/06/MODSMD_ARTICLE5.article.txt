# Waiting to inhale

### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Sophomore Ann Karash quit smoking. Almost.
Karash used to smoke a couple of packs a week, but
now limits herself to just one cigarette per month for im
proved health. She usually indulges while hanging out
with friends behind the Coffee House.
"I'll usually smoke when I'm stressing out or having
an emotional collapse," she said. "Smoking is a 15
minute release. With certain friends, it's like, 'Let's relax
and have a cigarette.'"
Karash fits into a group that's become rather com
mon at Stanford: recreational smokers. They tend to
bum cigarettes off of other people, as opposed to buying
them themselves. They often don't consider themselves
smokers because they just smoke occasionally with
friends or at parties.
"It's something to do," said Elise Lenox, director of
the Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Program at
Cowell Health Center. "You have a drink in one hand,
and a cigarette sits so nicely in the other."
Lenox's program conducted surveys of smoking
trends among Stanford students in 1994 and 1995. Both
surveys showed similar results. Thirty percent of stu
dents reported using tobacco in the last year, while only

3 percent said they were daily smokers, meaning about
27 percent of students fit somewhere in the recreational
smoking range.
Reasons for tobacco use vary largely by gender, Lenox
said. Males tend to chew tobacco on the athletic field,
whereas women smoke cigarettes in social arenas and to
improve body image.
"What I hear from women is weight control, appetite
suppressing effects, she said.
Lenox said she thinks most Stanford smokers are fe
males and that many are influenced to start smoking by
industry advertising.
"There's no doubt the industiy is targeting women
much more than in the past," she said. "I believe women
smoking is based on media impact."
The prevalence of recreational smoking among
women on the fitness-oriented Stanford campus has
caused confusion for Lenox.
"Something we question at Cowell is the Stanford
community is somewhat obsessed with body image,
health and fitness. Recreational smoking contradicts
that and it frustrates us," she said.
International students make up a large percentage of
Stanford smokers, as well. In many countries, smoking
is a cultural norm, Lenox said.
Stanford policy prohibits smok
ing in campus buildings, including
dormitories, and at public events.
Lenox said this is a common com
plaint from graduate students.
"They can't afford to live in Palo
Alto, but they can't smoke in their
own rooms," she said.
Undergraduate smokers do not
complain about this as much, in
stead just smoking outside the dor
mitories, according to sophomore
Patrick Dominguez, a peer health
educator who lives in Junipero.
"The smokers are considerate so
the nonsmokers don't have to deal
with second-hand smoke or the
smell," he said. Several of the fresh
men in his dorm smoke outside, and
he has never seen anyone smoking
inside the dormitory.
Dominguez said the Stanford's

tobacco policy has not been an issue
in his dorm.
"Smokers coming into Stanford
are aware of its policies," he said.
"They come knowing that. They
make their own accommodations.
Some freshmen put they are smok
ers on their applications and request
singl&s or balcony rooms."
Although Dominguez has not
had to deal with any smoking-relat
ed issues this year, all peer health ed
ucators are trained to do so.
"Peer health educators are
trained for the harmful .side effects
of smoking and the short-term ef
fects like bad breath and second
hand smoke for roommates, even
though you're not supposed to
smoke in the room," Dominguez
said.
Dominguez said most Stanford
smokers just smoke recreationally
fora variety of reasons.
"My friends smoke one or two cig
arettes eveiy other day as a break,
for recreation," he said. "Your expe
rience a little boost in confidence, to

reduce stress. We all have different
methods to reduce stress."
He added that Stanford is a high
stress environment for many stu
dents, which may encourage smok
ing.
Dominguez said the level of
smoking at Stanford does not con
cern him very much, and he hasn't
raised the issue with any of the
freshmen in his dormitory who
smoke.
"If I see my freshmen smoking,
it's up to them," he said. "I use my
best judgment on an individual case.
If a smoker developed a cough or be
came continually sick, I'd just make
known my concerns."
Ixjiiox hasn't decided how she
feels about recreational smoking. Its
effects have made fora continuous
debate among those in her program.
"There's a really strong contin
gency that t hey are smokers in train
ing," she said. "Others believe that
people can have a cigarette or two
and take it or leave it. I'm not quite
sure where I fall between those."
