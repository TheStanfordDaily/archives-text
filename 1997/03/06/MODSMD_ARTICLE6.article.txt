# Students call for awareness of disabilities

"One day could change your life forever" was
the slogan for Stanford's first Disability Action
Day, an event that served to increase awareness
of the inaccessibility of numerous areas on cam
pus and the issues disabled students face.
The event in White Plaza yesterday afternoon
was organized by the Disabled Awareness and
Reform Team with the help of the Disabled Stu
dents of Stanford.
The team was formed by a "bunch of able
bodied students who wanted to form a group to
promote disability awareness on campus," said
senior Nicole Walden, a member.
"Stanford is not a completely accessible cam
pus, and most people aren't even aware that this
is an issue," she said.
