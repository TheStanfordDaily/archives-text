# Students call for awareness of disabilities
## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
"One day could change your life forever" was
the slogan for Stanford's first Disability Action
Day, an event that served to increase awareness
of the inaccessibility of numerous areas on cam
pus and the issues disabled students face.
The event in White Plaza yesterday afternoon
was organized by the Disabled Awareness and
Reform Team with the help of the Disabled Stu
dents of Stanford.
The team was formed by a "bunch of able
bodied students who wanted to form a group to
promote disability awareness on campus," said
senior Nicole Walden, a member.
"Stanford is not a completely accessible cam
pus, and most people aren't even aware that this
is an issue," she said.
Coterminal student Bliss Temple, former
leader of Disabled Stanford Students, delivered


Lunnon Miles - Daily
Coterminal student Bliss Temple speaks at
Disability Awareness Day yesterday.
the keynote speech.
"Disabled students as a minori
ty group are really under-recog
nized. .. . I'm hoping that people
at Stanford come to think of us as
a minority group that has a pres
ence on campus," said Temple.
"Disabled people have a history
of being oppressed and here at
Stanford, we are segregated and
discriminated against," she said.
"Access is crucial for people
with disabilities.. . . The commu
nity loses something when we're
not fully integrated into commu
nity life," she added. "Stanford
pluralism and diversity is dimin
ished by lack of physical access for
students with disabilities."
The event focused on obtaining
signatures fora petition listing
several ways that the problems of
inaccessibility could be alleviated.
Medical student Nathan Wat
son, a student organizer of the
event, said the petition is a result
of "dissatisfaction with the cur
rent levels of accessibility for peo
ple with disabilities at Stanford."
He said it is an attempt to "remove

barriers which hamper the partic
ipation of disabled students in the
Stanford educational process and
student life."
The petition begins with a plea
that elevators be installed to allow
wheel-chair access to the second
and third floors of certain dormi
tories .
Watson said, however, that "if
you can even get in the door at
some places, you're lucky," said
Watson.
"There are no plans to retrofit
any dorms with elevators until
2004," he added.
The petition also asks for in
creased space to accommodate
wheelchairs between stacks at
Green and Meyer libraries , more
braille signs posted around cam
pus, blind-accessible computers in
all clusters, an installation of
hearing aid-compatible micro
phone systems in all lecture halls
and accessibility to the Old Union
clubhouses.
Walden, a friend of Temple, re
calls when they both went to a mu
sical concert at Braun and "had a
hell of a time getting in."
Although this specific accessi
bility problem must be addressed
by the University, students can
contribute to the awareness in

simple ways such as "not parking
their bikes on ramps" and in more
committed ways like "joining the
Disabled Awareness and Reform
Team," said Walden.
The petition requests Stan
ford require course syllabi and
reading lists be made available
three weeks before the quarter
starts.
Blind students need books on
tape and the process of recording
them takes about three weeks.
Many end up getting their books
around midterms, and some stu
dents have been put on probation
as a result of not being able to
complete their work on time due
to the absence of books, said Wat
son.
Temple reminded students
that "disability is an open-ended
minority which anyone can join.
"Wherever you go, ask your
self, 'Could someone in a wheel
chair get in here? Could someone
who is blind orient themselves in
this building? Could someone
with multiple chemical sensitivi
ties stay in this room with getting
sick?' " she said.
The event ended with a tour of
Stanford that pointed out areas
that were inaccessible to disabled
students.
