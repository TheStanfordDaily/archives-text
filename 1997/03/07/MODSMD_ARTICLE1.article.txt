# Students protest proposal to move grad students from co-op housing
## 
### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
Students protested the prospect
of the removal of graduate slots
from co-op housing yesterday morn
ing outside Old Union.
The protesters were responding
to a proposal by Housing and Dining
Services to ease the undergraduate
housing shortage by removing grad
uate students from co-ops next year.
The administration needs to create
44 additional undergraduate hous
ing spots because of an anticipated
increase in the number of transfer
students.
"I really appreciate their concern
and interest in the program," said
Rodger Whitney, associate director
of Housing and Dining Services.
"We are seriously considering this
feedback."

However, he said his office is still
considering removing graduate stu
dents from co-ops.
"The issue is the same, and the
solutions we are looking at are still
the same," he said.
Seven protesters spent the night
in White Plaza on Wednesday, and
five more joined the demonstration
yesterday morning. The protest fo
cused on the social and economic
benefits of graduate students living
in co-ops and the repercussions of
removing them.
Living in a co-op offers graduate
students emotional benefits, said
Brian Cheney, a doctoral student.
"After a long day in the lab, the
last thing you want to do is come
home and watch TV in an empty
apartment," he said. "You want

human contact."
The protesters reiterated Ch
eney's sentiments in a letter to vari
ous housing authorities, including
Whitney and Assoc. Director of Res
idential Education Ann Porteus.
"It seems strange that the Uni
versity almost actively encourages
the segregation of its population,
with almost no interaction between
the two," the group wrote.
Senior Thomas Willeke elaborat
ed on the benefits of graduate stu
dents living in co-ops. "Having a di
versity of age is very important,"
Willeke said. "Being in the presence
of such a wide range of ages breaks
down differentiation, so there is less
segmentation by classes."
The protesters also emphasized
the economic benefits that gradu

ate students bring to co-ops. They
often invite their friends and col
leagues to be eating associates —
people who pay the board bill and
eat at the co-op but do not live in the
house.
"Each eating associate pays $450
a quarter," Cheney said. "Last year
that added up to $9,000, one-third
of our quarterly budget. This is a
huge economic issue because we
buy all of our food in bulk."
However, Whitney pointed out
that the co-ops "were undergradu
ate co-ops for years, and they oper
ated just fine. Graduate students
will certainly still be eating associ
ates at the co-ops."
"We are considering a wide range
of solutions to the housing prob
lem," Whitney said. A decision will
probably be made early spring quar
ter, he said.
