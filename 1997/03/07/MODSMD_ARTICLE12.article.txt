Committee passes fundraising bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Republican plan to
investigate "illegal activities" in the 1996 congres
sional and presidential campaigns was rammed
through a Senate committee yesterday over Demo
cratic objections.
The Republican resolution, which will reach the
Senate floor Monday and may be ready for a vote on
Tuesday, was a compromise. It would shave more
than $2 million from an earlier $6.5 million GOP
funding proposal, set strict deadlines as demanded
by Democrats and permit an investigation of con
gressional as well as presidential fund raising —
along with activities of both political parties.
Swiss firms to give $46 million
GENEVA (AP) — Swiss companies are con
tributing $46 million to a fund set up by banks to
aid victims of the Holocaust, the Swiss federation of
industries said yesterday.
The donation means there is now $188 million in
the fund begun by three Swiss banks a month ago
under pressure from Jewish organizations.
That money is in addition to a Swiss government
plan announced Wednesday for a $5 billion fund to
aid victims of the Holocaust and other genocides or
disasters.
The banks set up the humanitarian fund to help
impoverished Jews, Gypsies and other Holocaust
victims while investigations continue into the
banks' handling of the assets of people murdered by
the Nazis.
Jewish organizations claim the banks owe the
heirs of Nazi victims up to $7 billion in assets and
interest that went unclaimed after the war.
The banks claim it is much less. In 1962, they
gave 9.5 million Swiss francs (now about $7 mil
lion) to Jewish charities as a settlement but subse
quently have conceded that may not have been
enough.

Rebels call off talks
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Rebels holding 72
hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence
called off today's peace talks, saying the govern
ment has been secretly digging a tunnel under the
complex.
Rebel leader Nestor Cerpa said the hostage-tak
ers began hearing noises three days ago and that
they intensified yesterday morning. He accused
police of planning a coordinated attack from above
and below ground.
Police had no response to the claim by the
Tupac Amaru rebels, who have held the
hostages since they raided a swank diplomatic
reception on Dec. 17. The rebels are demanding
freedom for hundreds of their jailed comrades, a
condition President Alberto Fujimori has
refused to accept.
It had been rumored for some time that
police had been tunneling — playing music dur
ing the day to cover the noise of the excavation,
removing the dirt at night — and that the real
reason TV cameramen were ordered from one
nearby rooftop was so they could not see the
activity.
There also had been unconfirmed reports of
practice commando operations at military bases
near Lima, including the use of helicopters and
paratroopers and the digging of a duplicate, practice
tunnel.
Cerpa said he had heard enough.
It was not clear when the rebels would return to
the negotiating table.
Today's talks would have been the 10th round
since they began Feb. 11 and the first since both
sides put their formal proposals on the table
Wednesday.
Cerpa has shown no public interest in safe pas
sage out of Peru — Cuba has offered asylum — say
ing he wants to return to the Peruvian jungle
where the movement is based.
