# Residents view flood damage
## Officials express optimism that worst may be over 
### 
FALMOUTH, Ky. (AP) - In
their first look at their flood
ravaged hometown, weary
refugees came face to face with
houses in the middle of streets,
trailers on their sides and roads
covered in ankle-deep muck.
It made them think the
unthinkable: that they may not
have a home to return to — and
some of their friends may not
have gotten out alive.
"The trailers, they looked like
bumper cars," Patrick Bass said
after weary evacuees were
allowed their first bus tour
through the town of 2,700 along
the Licking River.
National Guard troops used
bulldozers and other heavy
equipment to clear away crum
pled houses and piled-up cars.
Some houses were ripped from
their foundations and flung 100
feet by the floodwaters.
Rooftop-high waters had been
receding since the weekend, but
residents had been kept out as
search teams using dogs found
at least four bodies — an elderly
woman in her house and a man,
a woman and a 14-year-old girl
pulled from two trailers.
"It's just awful," said Becky
Fogel, who knew 54-year-old vic
tim Hazel McGovney and her
daughter, Crystal. "Hazel was a
hard-working good-hearted per
son. She believed she could han
dle any situation."
Authorities ended their door

to-door search for bodies on yes
terday, marking checked homes
with red ribbons tied to door
knobs. Some homes also were
marked with Xs — too danger
ous to enter because of gas or
severe structural damage.
Bass said he and his wife left
town just before the floods hit —
to see a concert by country
music star George Strait — and
a friend who was staying in their
home hasn't been seen since.
"He's probably gone," said
Bass.
At the height of the flooding,
this once-tidy town 35 miles
southeast of Cincinnati was
swamped, with only the roofs of
homes and the twin humps atop
the McDonald's sign visible
amid a milky lake.
Now, it is covered with a goo
the color of coffee with two
creams that sucks at your boots
as you walk.
Falmouth was among the
hardest hit from the floods that
forced thousands from their
homes along the Ohio River and
smaller streams in Tennessee,
Kentucky, Ohio and West Vir
ginia. Hoods and tornadoes
were blamed for a total of 53
deaths and tens of millions of
dollars in damages.
And while the Ohio remained
at its highest levels in 33 years,
officials expressed optimism
that the worst may be over. The
river was 15 feet above flood

stage in Louisville on Yesterday
at 3i3 * feet, and was expected to
crest late Friday at 38.7 feet.
"I expect it's going to fluctu
ate, not go up a great deal
more," said National Weather
Service hydrologist Mike Calla
han.
But in West Point, a town of
1,300 near the confluence of the
Ohio and Salt rivers, chest-high
floodwaters flowing swiftly
through the streets rose several
inches yesterday, prompting
authorities to issue an ultima
tum to about 45 stubborn hold
outs.
Saundra Bratcher, coordina
tor for disaster emergency ser
vices, said the Coast Guard was
leaving at nightfall and taking
their boats with them.
Coast Guard Lt. Michael Hart
took that message to the K&I
Cafe, announcing to the six peo
ple sipping coffee and smoking
cigarettes: "You can take it to
the bank, we're out of here at
dark. We're here to help but I'm
not here to endanger my peo
ple."
Tim Shively, whose sister
owns the cafe, leaned back in his
chair and responded: "I'm not
going nowhere. ... I can't afford
to leave this unguarded."
Rhonda Daniels, the cafe's
owner, grabbed her coat, took
the money out of the tip jar and
said: "I'm going. If it was just
me, I'd stay, but I've got kids."
