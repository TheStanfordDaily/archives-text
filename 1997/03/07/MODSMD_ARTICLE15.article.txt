## Editorial Finding class unity 
### 
All-frosh dorms are vital
to new committee's goal
of increased class unity

Another committee
was formed last week, this
one charged with increas
ing class unity. Compared to its
competitors, Stanford faces chron
ic levels of alumni dissatisfaction
and disconnectedness, and it is
believed that increasing class
unity will help solve the problem.
Students and administrators
alike have noticed a relatively low
degree of class unity over the
years, especially during the sopho
more and junior years. If the aim
of this nascent student-initiated
committee is truly to increase class
unity, it needs to remain focused
on one aspect: increasing fun
social interaction. Class unity is
built on shared social experience.
There exists a simple solution to
increase class unity dramatically
among future Stanford students:
increasing the number of all-fresh
man dormitories. University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper, in creating
his task force on undergraduate
housing, recognized that demand
for freshman housing currently
far outstrips availability. Hopeful
ly, the task force's recommenda
tions will reflect that reality.
Freshman dormitories foster a
unique environment that leads to
the creation of special bonds
among students as they take their
first steps into college life. Most
residents of freshman dormitories
identify with a shared, common
experience. It is more likely for
Branner and other all-frosh resi
dents to attend dorm reunions and,
without a doubt, this is because
they feel closer to their class. As a
direct result, they also feel closer to
their University. This is not to say
that Stanford should offer only all
frosh dormitories to incoming stu
dents only that the University pro

vide enough single-class residences
to satisfy freshman demand.
Other universities have specific
policies that enhance class unity
head-on. At Harvard University, the
entire freshman class lives in dorms
surrounding one courtyard. This
helps to ensure that their freshman
year will consist of intellectual pur
suits as well as social growth.
The tight class unity that
ensures a rewarding college experi
ence is beneficial to the University
as well. Greater class loyalty seems
to lead to greater school loyalty
which, in turn, seems to lead to
greater alumni-giving rates. The
plus for the University of enhanced
revenues grows from the plus for
students of a better social experi
ence. It's a win-win situation.
The committee should look to
establish class traditions. While
this university often seeks to dif
ferentiate itself from Eastern
schools entrenched in years of tra
dition, Stanford, by contrast,
seems to pride itself on its lack of
tradition. Traditions, however,
increase the number of ties the
alumni have to their alma mater.
Alumni that are attached to a
particular facet of the University
are more likely to help the Uni
versity later on; it is no coinci
dence that as a percentage, Greek
alumni donate more to Stanford
than non-Greek alumni.
For this new committee to be
successful, it is paramount for
them to focus on improving the
social experience for students
while they're at Stanford. It seems
that all concerned parties will ben
efit from a socially rewarding,
class-based experience, and thus
there is no reason for Stanford and
the class presidents to waste any
time in implementing changes to
achieve that end.
Class unity can be immediately
served, though, by a commitment
from the University to provide
housing for all freshmen who want
frosh-only dormitories. As the Uni
versity attempts to build greater
class unity, it's a great place to start.
