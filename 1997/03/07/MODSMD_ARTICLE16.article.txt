Lack of field space is slowly killing non-varsity sports

I AM WRITING to express my oppo
sition to the Athletics Depart
ment's plans with regard to the
intramural north and south fields.
I recently spoke with the depart
ment's operations manager, Rob Thomp
son, about the construction of the new
soccer complex that will begin shortly on
the north IM fields. According to Thomp
son, these fields will not be available to
intramurals, club sports and other gener
al users (non-varsity athletes), and no
new field space will be created to replace
them "for at least a year."
I also understand that the spring
intramural season is in jeopardy because
of the reduction in IM field space, and
club sports activities are being curtailed
or canceled. It is evident that removal of
these fields from general-use athletics
space will exacerbate an already severe
field overcrowding problem. I urge the
Athletics Department and the Universi
ty to make new field space available as

soon as possible in order to minimize the
negative impact of field closure on the
Stanford community.
Stanford's fields are a treasured Uni
versity resource. These fields are used by
a large and diverse portion of Stanford
students, faculty and staff. In addition to
official EM sports, clubs and other groups
play softball, soccer, Frisbee, rugby,
lacrosse, cricket, football, etc. on an
almost year-round basis. Competition for
access to the fields has intensified in
recent years as more and more fields
have been fenced and restricted.
When I first came to Stanford as a stu
dent in 1985, there was an abundance of
free athletic field space. There were many
places to play, pick up or organize field
sports, and field crowding was rarely an
issue. There were few fences and gates
but many unbroken, expansive views
across large, contiguous fields. It was
quite evident how the Farm got its name.
Since that time, I have watched with

increasing apprehension as field after
field has been fenced and removed from
general access. The list includes Maloney
I and 11, the "field hockey" field, the
"lacrosse field" (now under the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center) and parts of
Roble Field (due to the post-Loma Prieta
earthquake "temporary" trailers). As the
field space has shrunk, non-varsity ath
letes have found themselves competing
not only with each other for the remain
ing available space but also with other
users such as football parking, tailgating
and the Stanford Powwow. These non
athletic activities often cause consider
able damage to the fields and leave sig
nificant amounts of debris, including
glass, bottle caps and charcoal pits,
which create hazardous playing condi
tions for athletes. The University needs
more, not fewer, general-use fields, and
those fields should be designated for ath
letic use only. The University needs to
remember, in spite of the current build

ing boom, to keep the farm in the Farm.
I am concerned the trend of removing
field space from general-use access is
going to continue. While the general,
non-varsity users of Stanford facilities
have not had a coherent, unified voice,
we are the majority of athletes on cam
pus. Our interests must be taken into
account when the University makes deci
sions regarding Stanford's athletic
resources. This will require significant
reform of the current planning and deci
sion-making process so our views and
needs are effectively represented.
I hope that we and other concerned
Stanford community members can meet
with Athletic Director Ted Leland so the
decision-making process for managing
Stanford's athletic resources can be
made more representative and inclusive.
