# Phone monopoly rates poorly with frequent international callers
## 
### 
In Wednesday's editorial, "Monopo
lized lives," The Daily argued that Stan
ford's "telephone monopoly makes
sense." It does not. Students who call
overseas (including thousands of gradu
ate students) face inflated rates.
When we lived off campus, on Stan
ford Avenue, my wife paid 70 cents per
minute to call her family in China. Our
roommates teased us for getting ripped
off because they negotiated deals in
which different telephone companies
sent them checks for as much as $50 for
switching carriers.
But after moving across the street to
Escondido Village, we suddenly started
paying $2 for the first minute and 93

cents for each minute thereafter. This
adds up. Last month (a typical one), we
paid $100 for calls to China. Stanford's
monopoly costs us $30 per month and
leads my wife to talk with her family
less than she would if we faced more
reasonable rates.
But the Bookstore's monopoly is even
worse. Last year, I bought "Business
Chinese 500" for $34.95 and was
shocked to find it for $7.95 at the new
Borders Bookstore on University
Avenue. I also bought "30 Lessons on
Spoken Chinese Foreign Trade" last
year for $13.95.
This year, classmates photocopied the
book from me after sticker shock â€” the
Bookstore was charging nearly $40 for
the same exact book. The irony is that
the retail price in China is $2, implying
a 2000 percent markup!
Although Stanford does not directly
manage all these monopolies, it profits
from our exploitation when it sells

monopoly rights. I urge alumni and
future alumni to consider their shabby
treatment by Stanford-granted monopo
lies when Stanford comes asking for
donations.
