# Disabled community needs respect, not pity
## 
### 
The Daily's Tuesday article on "dis
ability awareness" is exactly what the dis
ability community did not want to see.
We do not need people to pretend to have
disabilities to understand us. Persons
without disabilities will never understand
what it feels like to have a disability.
Disability simulations create negative
stereotypes about persons with disabili
ties. Why not reach out to the public and
educate them? Teach proper techniques

for interacting, demonstrate communica
tion skills. Have real people with real dis
abilities and who use wheelchairs show
obstacles and the need for accessibility.
We need to demand we be treated
with dignity. When "Disability Aware
ness Day" disappears, let's hope the
flood of pity is replaced with respect.
Who is Nathan Watson? A non-dis
abled, want-to-be-hero and self-appoint
ed staff liaison. I am one of the founders
and the current chair for the Disability
Staff Forum at Stanford, accepted at
Stanford and nominated by staff
employees since 1989. In no way do I
support Watson and his "disability
awareness" tactics.
Having a disability is not tragic. It is
an experience that I have and you do
not. Don't pity me, Nathan. I don't.
