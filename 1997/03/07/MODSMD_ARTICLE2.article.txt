# Research table formed by the Women's Center
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
In an attempt to foster support for undergraduate
research, Stanford's Women's Center sponsored the
first of a series of Research Round Table sessions last
night in the Women's Center.
Created by senior Melissa Hoover, the Research
Round Table is designed to provide a forum in which
students can discuss their ideas and ask questions
about independent research.
The gathering was small, and the discussion was
dynamic; women had an opportunity to present their
research topics and explain how they became interest
ed in the subjects they are investigating.
Hoover, who is the Women's Center educational
programs intern, said the discussion was "exactly
what I envisioned."
"I wanted the discussion to be an intimate, in
depth conversation, and it was," Hoover said.
In addition to the group of students, Assoc. Dean t>f
Religious Life Kelly Denton-Borhaug was present to
facilitate discussion.
Denton-Borhaug said she was impressed with the
"innate passion" the students had for their research.
"It is wonderful to see that the students are con
cerned with ethically significant research," Denton-
Borhaug said. "This round table discussion is a terrif
ic idea, and it ought to be ongoing. It's a wonderful use
of the Women's Center."
The idea for the Research Round Table came only
after the Women's Center lost its funding from the
special fees ballot last year. The center had to submit
a proposal to the University requesting money, and
the Research Round Table was one of the new pro
grams presented in the proposal.
"A big part of the round table is sharing ideas with
younger women," Hoover said. "The University's
mission includes a sophomore support plan, to help
sophomores interrupt the sophomore slump — to get
them to feel connected."
Not only did the sophomores
present find the discussion panel
helpful, older students were appre
ciative of the program as well.
Junior Theresa Hwang, who is
studying women in South America,
said she was grateful to the round
table for offering support.
"It's great to have this support
network," Hwang said.
Many of the women felt the rep

resentation of a variety of interests
was another advantage of the pro
gram's design.
"It's nice to bounce ideas off of
people of different disciplines. It
gives me a new set of people to
whom I can turn," senior Deborah
Slon said.
Along with sharing research in
terests, the women discussed diffi
culties in beginning research. Stu
dents shared their thoughts about
common hurdles such as narrow
ing down research ideas, managing
time and finding an adviser.
Slon, who is researching the vit

amin A deficiency of Latin Ameri
can children and how it relates to
blindness, said the Research
Round Table provided her with an
opportunity to share her research
and appreciate the significance of
her work.
"The research I'm doing has the
potential to change the lives of the
people I'm studying. It's inspir
ing," Slon said.
Hoover, who is investigating
labor movements of Finnish
women in Minnesota around the
turn of the century, said she wants
the Research Round Table to

spread the word about "the guilty
pleasure of research."
"People sometimes think of
doing research as eating vegeta
bles: You know they're good for you
even though they taste bad. It's im
portant to know that research can
be rewarding if you're passionate
about the subject. Personalizing
education is taking our interests
and devoting academic time to
them," Hoover said.
The Research Round Table will
meet three more times during
spring quarter, on April 8, April 15
and a date to be announced.
