In an attempt to foster support for undergraduate
research, Stanford's Women's Center sponsored the
first of a series of Research Round Table sessions last
night in the Women's Center.
Created by senior Melissa Hoover, the Research
Round Table is designed to provide a forum in which
students can discuss their ideas and ask questions
about independent research.
The gathering was small, and the discussion was
dynamic; women had an opportunity to present their
research topics and explain how they became interest
ed in the subjects they are investigating.
Hoover, who is the Women's Center educational
programs intern, said the discussion was "exactly
what I envisioned."
"I wanted the discussion to be an intimate, in
depth conversation, and it was," Hoover said.
In addition to the group of students, Assoc. Dean t>f
Religious Life Kelly Denton-Borhaug was present to
facilitate discussion.
Denton-Borhaug said she was impressed with the
"innate passion" the students had for their research.
"It is wonderful to see that the students are con
cerned with ethically significant research," Denton-
Borhaug said. "This round table discussion is a terrif
ic idea, and it ought to be ongoing. It's a wonderful use
of the Women's Center."
The idea for the Research Round Table came only
after the Women's Center lost its funding from the
special fees ballot last year. The center had to submit
a proposal to the University requesting money, and
the Research Round Table was one of the new pro
grams presented in the proposal.
"A big part of the round table is sharing ideas with
younger women," Hoover said. "The University's
mission includes a sophomore support plan, to help
sophomores interrupt the sophomore slump â€” to get
them to feel connected."
