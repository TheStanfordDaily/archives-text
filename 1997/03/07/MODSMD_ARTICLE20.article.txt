## Biting the hand that feeds 
### 
A FEW YEARS ago I spent the sum
mer volunteering in a small,
Paraguayan city. While the
greater part of my official efforts was
spent immunizing people, I also informed
schoolchildren about dental hygiene.
This was a fairly painless process
when dealing with second-graders.
Toothbrushes were new toys and I was
Santa Claus. However as I watched sixth
graders try to brush their rotted teeth I
winced along with them. When they ran
to the store after school to buy Coca-
Cola, they smiled again. I was the one
who kept on wincing.
A few months ago, I attended a Coca-
Cola Scholars luncheon. The president of
the Coca-Cola Foundation was in atten
dance, and he concluded a feel-good talk
by warmly inviting us to contact him
with ideas about philanthropic undertak
ings the foundation could support. Eyes
shining with memories of toothless
smiles, I approached him.
"The Coca-Cola Foundation does won
derful things, and I know there is a huge
international market for Coca-Cola." He
smiled. "But many children in other
countries do not have access to dental
protection." He frowned. "I was wonder
ing if the Coca-Cola Foundation would be
interested in supporting an international
dental hygiene program." Silence.
"Well," he began, "well we wouldn't
ever want Coca-Cola to be in any way
associated with problems of dental
hygiene. ... If you have any other

ideas, here's my card."
It was not the worst rejection I have
ever experienced, but in my naivete, it
was one of the more unexpected. I stam
mered a thank you and floundered my
way to the door. I had no hard facts and
no accusations to make of the Coca-Cola
Co. Only unwelcome questions.
Down the street from Stanford is
located another "altruistic" foundation.
Among many services it provides to the
city of East Palo Alto, Romic Chemical
Company (now known as Romic Envi
ronmental Technologies) supports the
Ecumenical Hunger Program.
Romic also recycles Silicon Valley's
toxic waste. In 1995, it was shut down
when officials discovered that sewer
water flowing from East Palo Alto con
tained dying bacteria. Romic had been
pouring cyanide into the sewers at 10
times the legal limit. Romic said it was
"good" cyanide.
Of the 54 hazardous-waste companies
in California, 53 are located in poor
minority communities. Residents in
middle- and upper-class communities
have enough political muscle to keep
such companies out. They know toxic
waste causes cancer. The people of East
Palo Alto also know this. And yet Romic
stays. Romic contributes to the East
Palo Alto Historical Society.
The clapper rail, saltwater harvest
mouse and pickleweed all used to grow in
the baylands near Romic. That they can
no longer survive there is a loss. That

humans still do live there is ominous.
And yet Romic stays. Romic also funds
the East Palo Alto Little League.
A group called East Palo Alto Commu
nity Against Toxics has one goal: forcing
Romic to leave. Members don't like the
fact that sealed trucks cart in secret sub
stances. They don't want a toxic-waste
incinerator. They know little leagues are
nice and food closets are nice. But they
also know that if they don't bite the hand
that feeds East Palo Alto, that same hand
may pour cyanide in the sewers.
Scholarships are nice, too. What will
happen to me if I am pushy enough to
delve into the root of international
tooth decay? I already have a tooth
brush. And a scholarship. 1
Romic's injustices in the community
of East Palo Alto are well documented.
There is a group of East Palo Altans
fighting very hard to make Romic leave.
They will not be bought, and they will not
be intimidated. Superficial altruism has
not blinded them to the true health
implications of a toxic-waste recyclery
that won't clean up after itself.
I, on the other hand, have not said
another word to the president of the
Coca-Cola Foundation.

Cola 's generosity.
