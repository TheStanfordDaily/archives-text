## Facing hypocrisy and contempt: the struggle of ROTC students 
### 
Anthony D'Alessandro and Steven Grossman

THE PASSIONATE AND apparently
rational letters and opinions against
inviting the Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps program back to Stanford made
us curious about the other side of the argu
ment, inspiring us to research the actual
facts and the points of view of those with
first-hand experience in ROTC.
Our initial reaction is that it is hypo
critical for ASSU President Bill Shen to
fight for a public service minor while
opposing the return of ROTC units to cam
pus, when those units would be filled with
Stanford students who volunteer to risk
their lives for at least five years defending
our country and national security.
His other pet project is the socially
responsible endowment fund, with the
stated goal of investing in companies that
promote human rights and environmental
protection. Those we met in ROTC also
have idealist goals of defending freedom

but feel that they can make more of a dif
ference in the world by serving actively as
peacekeepers in Haiti or Bosnia than they
could by not investing other people's
money in Pepsi Co. They have the same
goals as the typical Stanford student; they
just go about them differently and quietly.
We also disagree with the reasoning
that ROTC units should be banned from
Stanford because, as doctoral student
Susan Owen argued in a Feb. 3 letter,
"ROTC policy explicitly states that no
one who is gay, lesbian or bisexual may
receive a ROTC scholarship."
First of all, everyone in the program
went through a thorough application pro
cess. The freshmen involved did so just
last year, and they tell us from experience
that there is no box to check to identify
yourself as gay, bisexual or whatever. No
doubt there are already gay students in
ROTC as well in the active military. The
"don't ask, don't tell" policy simply states
no one's sexuality has any place at work.
Second, Owen is completely erroneous
in portraying the "don't ask, don't tell"
policy as an invention of the ROTC. It is
not military policy, it is public law. The
day that the military selectively ignores
an executive order from the president is
the day we abandon the rule of law and
become a military dictatorship.
Moreover, if Stanford is truly a liberal

institution it would be tolerant of the opin
ions of the community members who are
patriotic and support the military as well
as the opinions of gay, lesbian and bisexu
al students, and the University would fund
organizations appealing to both groups of
students without prejudice. Or are we only
tolerant of others if they conform to what
is deemed acceptable by the Pharisees of
political correctness?
If "Stanford has to require the same
fundamental non-discrimination policy
from any company or organization who
wants to install itself' as part of the cam
pus," as Owen claims, how is it right for
Stanford to accept the nearly $100,000 per
student enrolled in ROTC elsewhere or the
more than $250 million in research grants
from the federal government, a substantial
part of it from the Defense Department?
The $250 million is in addition to $167
million in federal funding for the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. By comparison,
the total revenue from undergraduate
tuition is under $120 million. The possibil
ity of decreased federal research grants has
caused University President Gerhard
Casper to desperately seek more contribu
tions to keep the University solvent.
Like it or not, there would be no Stan
ford experience without the Defense
Department. What hurts us more than
the hypocrisy is our perception of a

widespread sentiment that somehow serv
ing in the military is beneath Stanford
graduates because it is not sufficiently
intellectual. The people we met are not the
phalanx of homophobic clones that Owen,
ASSU leaders and faculty like English
Prof. Ron Rebholz describe in The Daily.
Out of uniform they are indistinguish
able from the rest of the Stanford student
body: They play in the Band, they repre
sent Stanford in varsity sports, they are
resident assistants, they are members of
fraternities and they pursue their aca
demic careers just as passionately as any
one else. Why is it not desirable to have
the best of the best in uniform, protecting
national security and easing our collective
guilt when we see pictures of dying
African children on the cover of Time?
One example of this attitude comes
from Rebholz, who said he would object
to the bestowing of faculty status on mil
itary officers who taught ROTC courses.
Any Stanford student can transfer credit
from classes at his or her local communi
ty college, but somehow the military sci
ence classes that ROTC cadets and mid
shipmen take, all taught by officers with
graduate degrees and expertise in mili
tary science far beyond the doctoral level,
are not sufficiently intellectual. It makes
no sense to justify this anti-military
atmosphere on the Pentagon's "policy of

excluding gays, bisexuals and lesbians,"
as Owen does, because it is not the people
in uniform who make policy decisions.
Our Constitution and its uniqueness
hinge on the principle that civilians (some
of them Stanford professors) hav~ ulti
mate control over the military and only
they can set policy. The way to change
policy and make it more tolerant, is at the
ballot box, not by discouraging Stanford
students from serving as officers.
It seems contrary to all logic to dis
courage Stanford students from learning
how to lead our armed forces. How is
anything going to change if tolerant
atmospheres like Stanford do not pro
duce those who are in a position to make
a difference? The alternative is a caste of
professional soldiers, trained at institu
tions like the military academies and the
Citadel, isolated from the rest of society.
We should encourage and support our
national tradition of the citizen-soldier
who serves his or her country for several
years and then returns to civilian life.
The people we met are not mercenaries;
some of them signed up not for money
but for honor, courage and commitment.
