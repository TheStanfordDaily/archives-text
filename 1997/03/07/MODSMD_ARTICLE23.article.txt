So much for that tough road test.
The third-ranked Cardinal (29-1, 17-0 Pacific
10 Conference) made it look amazingly easy,
routing a tough Arizona squad (21-7, 11-6) 95-60,
before 4,123 in the McKale Center. Despite com
mitting 24 turnovers, Stanford shot a solid 50
percent from the floor, including a sizzling 15-of
-25 in the second half.
"I think the second half was more indicative of
what we want to do," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We ended up hitting 12
threes, which was more than we've made all
year."
All five starting Cardinal players scored in
double figures, led by senior guard Kate Star
bird's 15. Redshirt sophomore forward Kristin
Folkl came off the bench to post her second dou
ble-double in four games, scoring 14 points and
grabbing 12 rebounds to go along with three

assists and two blocks in 21 minutes of play.
"Kristin has great hands," Starbird said.
"That really helps cut down on your turnovers
because if you throw a bad pass she'll get it any
way. We're all really glad to have her back, and
she gets a lot of rebounds, as you can tell."
The Cardinal displayed a sharpness that was a
180-degree turn from last week's offensive dol
drums at California. Junior center Olympia Scott
got things going, scoring Stanford's first six
points of the game. The outside shooting also
caught fire, as senior point guard Jamila Wide
man's third three-pointer of the first half made it
35-18 with 6 minutes, 11 seconds to go before the
intermission. Redshirt sophomore center Chan
dra Benton followed that up with the second
three of her career, stunning the McKale Center
crowd. At that point, the Wildcats were strug
gling with their shot, making only 7-of-23 from
the floor.
,"We missed eight or nine bunny shots," said
Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini. "We had
great position inside. We got the scoring from
Lisa (Griffith] and Adia [BarnesJ but not from
the others."
Not only was Stanford rolling offensively and
playing great defense, it also had the chance to
play junior forward Naomi Mulitauaopele for the
first time since Jan. 18. She ran the floor well
while scoring six points in 10 minutes of play.
Arizona did regroup towards the end of the
half by closing the half on a 14-7 run to make the
