So much for that tough road test.
The third-ranked Cardinal (29-1, 17-0 Pacific
10 Conference) made it look amazingly easy,
routing a tough Arizona squad (21-7, 11-6) 95-60,
before 4,123 in the McKale Center. Despite com
mitting 24 turnovers, Stanford shot a solid 50
percent from the floor, including a sizzling 15-of
-25 in the second half.
"I think the second half was more indicative of
what we want to do," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We ended up hitting 12
threes, which was more than we've made all
year."
All five starting Cardinal players scored in
double figures, led by senior guard Kate Star
bird's 15. Redshirt sophomore forward Kristin
Folkl came off the bench to post her second dou
ble-double in four games, scoring 14 points and
grabbing 12 rebounds to go along with three

assists and two blocks in 21 minutes of play.
"Kristin has great hands," Starbird said.
"That really helps cut down on your turnovers
because if you throw a bad pass she'll get it any
way. We're all really glad to have her back, and
she gets a lot of rebounds, as you can tell."
The Cardinal displayed a sharpness that was a
180-degree turn from last week's offensive dol
drums at California. Junior center Olympia Scott
got things going, scoring Stanford's first six
points of the game. The outside shooting also
caught fire, as senior point guard Jamila Wide
man's third three-pointer of the first half made it
35-18 with 6 minutes, 11 seconds to go before the
intermission. Redshirt sophomore center Chan
dra Benton followed that up with the second
three of her career, stunning the McKale Center
crowd. At that point, the Wildcats were strug
gling with their shot, making only 7-of-23 from
the floor.
,"We missed eight or nine bunny shots," said
Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini. "We had
great position inside. We got the scoring from
Lisa (Griffith] and Adia [BarnesJ but not from
the others."
Not only was Stanford rolling offensively and
playing great defense, it also had the chance to
play junior forward Naomi Mulitauaopele for the
first time since Jan. 18. She ran the floor well
while scoring six points in 10 minutes of play.
Arizona did regroup towards the end of the
half by closing the half on a 14-7 run to make the

score a manageable 42-32.
Barnes scored nine during the
run on her way to leading the
team with 29 points.
Any momentum gained from
that spurt was soundly
squelched by the gunning Cardi
nal attack. Stanford went on a
14-2 run in the first 3:29 of the
second half to go up 56-34.
Meanwhile, Arizona was having
trouble finding offensive support
for Barnes. After her, the next
leading scorer was Griffith with
10 points, while forward Monika
Crank finished with a paltry six
points.
As the Wildcats maintained
their frigid shooting (34 percent
in the second half), the Cardinal
advantage became more decided.
A Starbird trey made it 84-50
with 6:24 left.
Not only did this three com
plete Starbird's scoring for the
evening, but it raised her season
total to 647, good for a tie for
sixth place on the Pac-10's all
time single-season scoring list
with former USC great Lisa
Leslie and breaking Stanford's
record of 643 set last year by
Starbird.
But it was the three-point
shooting that stood out tonight.
Starbird's three capped off an
amazing Stanford run during
which the team hit 7-of-8 three
point attempts in the second
half, clearly impressing Van-
Derveer.
"I like threes," VanDerveer
said. "I'm not a math person,
but I'm pretty sure that three is
more than two."
The Cardinal will close the

regular season tomorrow night
against ninth-place Arizona
State (9-18, 3-14), which won the
battle for last place last night,
knocking off Cal (6-20, 2-15) at
home 65-54. Senior forward
Molly Tuter is the lone bright
spot on a terrible team, averag
ing 15 points per contest. At
stake for Stanford is their second
consecutive perfect conference
mark as well as its fourth 30-win
season of the 19905.
