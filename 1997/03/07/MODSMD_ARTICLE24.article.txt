# Men's netters to play Weenies, Mustangs
## 
### Hilary Stamm Contributing writer 
It should be a pleasant weekend
for the top-ranked men's tennis
squad, as it is highly favored in
both its dual matches this week
end.
The Card kicks off its play
today at 1:30 p.m. when it takes on
53rd-ranked Southern Methodist
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um.
"This is our last home match of
the term," said head coach Dick
Gould. "We are looking to keep our
focus in these last few matches
and finish strong."
SMU and Stanford were sup
posed to meet last year in mid-
February, but the match was
rained out. Although the Mus
tangs are the underdog, they have
some strong talent in their top
players.
Due to new additions in the
Mustangs' roster, Stanford coach
es Gould and John Whitlinger see
SMU as a much improved squad.
However, the Mustangs will have
to be dynamite if they have any
chance of slowing down the Card
(9-1, 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference).
Stanford has only dropped one
match all season, losing to Ken
tucky at the national indoors last
February. Since its loss to the

Wildcats, Stanford has been phe
nomenal against its opponents,
knocking off such highly ranked
teams as No. 12 LSU and No. 7
Texas.
Since its return from the
national indoors, the Card has
walloped all competition which
dares step onto its courts. Stan
ford has breezed by both San Jose
State and Oregon, dropping only
one set in 18 matches.
If the Card is looking forward to
anything this weekend, it is its trip
across the bay Saturday when it
takes on Pac-10 rival California at
noon. Regardless of Stanford's
superior tennis program, there
has always been good competition
with the Bears.
"There is always a good rivalry
with Cal, it is a fun match," said
junior Misha Palechek.
The Bears (4-3, 2-0) just won
their second conference match
earlier this week against Oregon.
Cal is ranked sixth in the region,
running behind the top ranked
Card. Last season, Stanford
breezed past Cal at Berkeley by a
score of 5-2.
The Bears' best chance at a vic
tory will most likely be in doubles.
They currently have two of the top
ranked teams in the region,
including the pair of Michael Hill
and David Sutton.
Yet the Card should be prepared
there as well. Ail-Americans Paul
Goldstein, a junior, and Rvan
Wolters, a sophomore, were the

runners-up at the doubles champi
onships in La Jolla, and senior
Grant Elliott and freshman Geoff
Abrams won the consolation
bracket.
When asked what the team did
afler a solid walloping of its oppo
nents following the San Diego
State match earlier this season,
Elliott, the team captain, replied,
"We have to go home and study."
