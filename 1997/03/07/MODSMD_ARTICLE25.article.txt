It's not often that a college
basketball player gets a chance to
play hero by making the last
minute shot in a big game. For
Stanford sophomore Peter Sauer,
it's already happened twice.
The first time was last year's
second-round NCAA tournament
game against top-ranked Mas
sachusetts, when Sauer missed a
three-pointer in the waning
moments that could have sent
the game into overtime. Last
night, Sauer got a second chance,
and this time the 6-foot-7 for
ward delivered, burying a soft
baseline jumper with six seconds
remaining to lift No. 23 Stanford
to an electrifying 81-80 victory
over No. 12 Arizona before a sell
out crowd of 7,391 at Maples
Pavilion.
"I've been thinking about that
ever since that happened," Sauer
said of his missed shot against
UMass. "So it's nice to get one in.
"Someone had to step up and
make the play. It wasn't a real
hard play â€” [point guard Brevin
Knight] put it right there for me.
Just a shot we do every day in
practice."
Arizona had the lead, 80-79,
and the ball with 56 seconds
remaining in the game, but Stan

ford sophomore center Tim
Young grabbed the rebound of a
missed Miles Simon shot, leading
to a Cardinal timeout with 15 sec
onds left. On the Stanford bench,
head coach Mike Montgomery
put the decision in Knight's
hands.
"I asked Brevin what he want
ed, what he felt most comfortable
with," Montgomery said. "He
wasn't sure he could get a shot off
necessarily, but he knew he could
get in the lane."
Driving by his defender and
into the paint, Knight immediate
ly drew the attention of Arizona
forward Bennett Davison, which
left Sauer wide open on the base
line. The Wildcats would have
one last chance to win it, but
Michael Bibby's off-balance
three-pointer at the buzzer feil
short, prompting Stanford stu
dents to flood through a wall of
security guards and onto the
court, where they joined the play
ers in an impromptu post-game
celebration.
"Pete made a great shot,"
Knight said. "If his guy is going
to come at me, I'm gonna drop it
off to him. Whoever was open, I
was going to try to get them the
ball."
Sauer's shot was merely the
