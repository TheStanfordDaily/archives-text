# Men upset No. 12 Arizona in thrilling finish at home
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
It's not often that a college
basketball player gets a chance to
play hero by making the last
minute shot in a big game. For
Stanford sophomore Peter Sauer,
it's already happened twice.
The first time was last year's
second-round NCAA tournament
game against top-ranked Mas
sachusetts, when Sauer missed a
three-pointer in the waning
moments that could have sent
the game into overtime. Last
night, Sauer got a second chance,
and this time the 6-foot-7 for
ward delivered, burying a soft
baseline jumper with six seconds
remaining to lift No. 23 Stanford
to an electrifying 81-80 victory
over No. 12 Arizona before a sell
out crowd of 7,391 at Maples
Pavilion.
"I've been thinking about that
ever since that happened," Sauer
said of his missed shot against
UMass. "So it's nice to get one in.
"Someone had to step up and
make the play. It wasn't a real
hard play — [point guard Brevin
Knight] put it right there for me.
Just a shot we do every day in
practice."
Arizona had the lead, 80-79,
and the ball with 56 seconds
remaining in the game, but Stan

ford sophomore center Tim
Young grabbed the rebound of a
missed Miles Simon shot, leading
to a Cardinal timeout with 15 sec
onds left. On the Stanford bench,
head coach Mike Montgomery
put the decision in Knight's
hands.
"I asked Brevin what he want
ed, what he felt most comfortable
with," Montgomery said. "He
wasn't sure he could get a shot off
necessarily, but he knew he could
get in the lane."
Driving by his defender and
into the paint, Knight immediate
ly drew the attention of Arizona
forward Bennett Davison, which
left Sauer wide open on the base
line. The Wildcats would have
one last chance to win it, but
Michael Bibby's off-balance
three-pointer at the buzzer feil
short, prompting Stanford stu
dents to flood through a wall of
security guards and onto the
court, where they joined the play
ers in an impromptu post-game
celebration.
"Pete made a great shot,"
Knight said. "If his guy is going
to come at me, I'm gonna drop it
off to him. Whoever was open, I
was going to try to get them the
ball."
Sauer's shot was merely the
finishing touch to one of the most
thrilling games in Maples Pavil
ion history. It was a dogfight from
start to finish, with both teams
battling back and forth in a game
that saw the lead change hands 13
times. Stanford trailed by as
many as 11 points and led by as
many as 10 — and that was just
the first half.
Arizona Coach Lute Olson
called it the best game the Wild
cats (19-8 overall, 11-6 Pacific 10
Conference) have played all year.
"I told our guys this is not a nega
tive," he said. "Beating this team
here is going to be as tough as any
thing you're gonna have to do.'
Particularly when Stanford is
running the kind of balanced
offensive attack it had last night.
The Cardinal made just 5-of-18
three-pointers, but compensated
with a big inside game that
included an inspired performance
by Young.
The 7-1 sophomore has strug
gled in recent weeks, but last
night he hit 7-of-10 shots from
the floor and 8-of-8 from the free
throw line in a 22-point, 17-
rebound effort.
"He almost just willed himself
to play better," Montgomery said.
"22 and 17 — that's the last
month for Tim. That was huge,
and we needed every one of them.
"With Tim's talent, we have to
go to him, and he just showed
tonight what he's capable of
doing," said Knight, who dished
out 12 assists to go along with a
game-high 23 points. "His back is
feeling better, he said his legs feel
good, so we're gonna ride him as
long as he can go."

That should be at least until
next week's NCAA Tournament.
Stanford (19-7, 11-6), which
moves into a three-way tie for
third place in the Pac-10, all but
guaranteed itself a tournament
berth with last night's victory.
With a win tomorrow over last
place Arizona State (10-19, 2-
15), the Cardinal could finish as
high as second in the conference.
"This was definitely the best
game that I've ever had here,"
said Knight, who along with Rich
Jackson will be honored tomorrow
night in the seniors' final home
game. "With as much as we have
on the line, for us to gut up and
win the way we did, it was great."
