# Knight, Young finally display long-awaited one-two punch
## 
### Dan Kao Senior staff writer 
It's called karma. What goes
around comes around. And for
the 23rd-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team (19-7
overall, 11-6 Pacific 10 confer
ence), it has been a long time
coming.
In last night's nailbiting 81-
80 Cardinal home victory over
No. 12 Arizona (19-8, 11-6), not
only was Stanford finally able to
avenge a 76-75 loss earlier this
season with a one-point win of
its own, but in addition, after
what seems an eternity, the Car
dinal finally caught a glimpse of
what it had hoped to see more of
this season: Ail-American senior
guard Brevin Knight and sopho
more center Tim Young domi

nating a game together in a way
that only the great point guard
center combinations can.
"Tim Young and Brevin
Knight, the two guys we've
talked about having to be impact
players for us, were clearly
impact players for us [tonight],"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery.
Knight has definitely been up
to the task all season long,
entering last night's game aver
aging 15.2 points per game while
throwing in 7.6 assists and 2.7
steals per contest. At the same
time, the veteran point guard
has shouldered the burden of
guiding a young, somewhat
inexperienced team composed
mainly of freshmen and sopho
mores.
And the nifty floor general
didn't disappoint last night
either with a 23-point, 12-assist,
three-steal performance. Just
another day at the office.
On the other hand, Young has
struggled as of late, racked with
a bothersome back.
The gritty center roared back
against the No. 12 Wildcats,
however, with 22 points, 17
rebounds, and a career-high five
blocks despite some tightness
still in his back.
"He's really trying in there,"
Montgomery said. "He was
jumping up and dominating the
boards. We're glad to see him
back."
More than numbers was the
way the two players dominated
the contest in the game's waning

moments. Trailing 80-77 with
1:21 left to play, Knight swiped
the ball from Wildcat Mike
Bibby and found a wide open
Young on the offensive end for
an easy dunk that moved the
Cardinal to within striking dis
tance.
"He makes me a much better
player just because other players
put so much emphasis on guard
ing him that it leaves me open
for shots," Young said. "A lot of
my shots today were just lay-ups
because Brevin's such a good
passer."
Then, on the defensive end,
Young pulled down a clutch
rebound off of a miss by Wildcat
Miles Simon to give Stanford its
crucial possession.
With 15 seconds to go and
down 79-80, there was no doubt
that Stanford would put the ball
into the hands of its All-Ameri
can.
"We wanted Brevin in a posi
tion to make the play, and he

did," Montgomery said.
Knight caught the ball on the
inbound, blew past Wildcat
Jason Terry, penetrated the
lane as only he can, drew the
double team, and dished the ball

Montgomery 'told me
he was going to put
the ball in my hands,
and he told me to
make a play, and
that's what I did.'
— Brevin Knight

to sophomore forward Pete
Sauer all alone on the baseline
for the game-winning jumper.
Montgomery "told me he was
going to put the ball in my
hands, and he told me to make a
play, and that's what I did," said

Knight.
"I've been playing with him
long enough to know that if he's
got two guys on him, he'll be
able to get it to me," said Sauer.
Sauer made the game-win
ning shot, and Knight the game
winning assist.
But it's no secret that for the
Cardinal to win more games, it
needs to rely on more than just
superlative guard play and out
side jumpers. It needs a force on
the inside.
Young "definitely stepped up
for us tonight," said Knight.
"We need an inside presence. He
dominated. He did everything
that we've asked of him to do,
and that's what we're going to
need to be successful from here
on out."
With selection Sunday just
two days away, the Cardinal will
be hoping to maintain the pow
erful guard-center combination
it established in last night's vic
tory.
