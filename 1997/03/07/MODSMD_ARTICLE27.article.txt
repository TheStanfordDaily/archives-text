# Volleyball prepares to do battle against UCLA, Loyola Marymount this weekend
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team hits the road
once again this weekend. The team's opponents this
time will be fourth-ranked UCLA (9-3, 8-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) and No. 15 Loyola Mary
mount (4-6, 3-6).
Stanford has had some difficulty winning big
matches on the road, compiling a 3-2 record away
from home, including losses to USC and BYU. Stan
ford will try to win away from the friendly confines of
home the same way it has during its five-game
unbeaten streak at Burnham Pavilion.
The team will travel to Pauley Pavilion today,
where it faces the Bruins. Recently, UCLA has con
sistently been the most dominant team in the coun
try, having won 16 national titles since 1970; the
Bruins currently are the two-time defending nation
al champs. Like Stanford, UCLA is big and powerful,
relying on its net game to win matches.
UCLA features a blend of experience and youth.
The team returns four starters from last year and
adds to this mix freshmen Brandon Taliaferro, a 6-
foot-5 setter, and Adam Naeve, a 6-foot-10 middle
blocker. Along with Stanford freshman outside hit
ter Andy Witt, these two were the top recruits in the
country. They join 6-foot-7 senior outside hitter Paul
Nihipali, a candidate for player of the year much like
Stanford's own Mike Ijambert, and 6-foot-8 senior
middle blocker Tom Stilwell as the team's other two
key players. Together, the sue Bruin starters average
6-foot-7.5, a taily formidable physical presence, even

for Stanford.
"This is the first time that we're
going to play against a team that is
bigger than we are," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "You do not
try to stop a player like Nihipali,
just like people don't try to stop
Instead, you hope to con
tain him and stop him from beat
ing you single-handedly. We defi
nitely need to try to slow him
down, but we can't concentrate too
much on him because they have so
many other weapons."
In addition to being a contest for
bragging rights between the top
two volleyball teams in California,
the match may have important
ramifications for the NCAA Final
Four. A win for either team gives it
a huge advantage toward the at
large berth offered by the selection
committee. If, by chance, one of
these two does not win the MPSF
tournament, both will have to hope
for this bid.
"1 do see the match being real
important for the NCAAs," said
Nieves. "In addition to being
important in case we need an at
large berth, it will be crucial to
MPSF tournament seedings. The
top seed in the tournament gets to

play all of its matches at home.
Based on our record at Burnham,
I'd feel pretty good about our
chances if we got that opportuni
ty."
If Stanford is to prove victorious
over the Bruins, it will have to con
tinue to serve and pass well, things
that were lackmg in earlier losses
this season but have been
strengths during the winning
streak. In addition, strong matches
from two of the three outside hit
ters, Lambert, Witt and senior
Matt Fuerbringer, will be critical.
When at least two of the three have
performed well, Stanford has
played well.
On Saturday, in what should be
the easier of the two matches, the
Cardinal will face No. 15 Loyola
Marymount. Despite having a less
than-intimidating record, the
Lions have earned some impressive
wins, beating No. 8 UC-Santa Bar
bara along with then-13th ranked
Cal State-North ridge. Loyola has
been led by senior outside hitter
Corin Bemus, who is one of the top
offensive players in the MPSF,
averaging 6.3 kills per game.
In order to stake its claim to a
national title, Stanford must con
vince people that it can win on the
road. Two victories this weekend,
including one in the house of the
defending champs, would go a long
wav toward doing this.
