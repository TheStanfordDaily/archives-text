## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team hits the road
once again this weekend. The team's opponents this
time will be fourth-ranked UCLA (9-3, 8-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) and No. 15 Loyola Mary
mount (4-6, 3-6).
Stanford has had some difficulty winning big
matches on the road, compiling a 3-2 record away
from home, including losses to USC and BYU. Stan
ford will try to win away from the friendly confines of
home the same way it has during its five-game
unbeaten streak at Burnham Pavilion.
The team will travel to Pauley Pavilion today,
where it faces the Bruins. Recently, UCLA has con
sistently been the most dominant team in the coun
try, having won 16 national titles since 1970; the
Bruins currently are the two-time defending nation
al champs. Like Stanford, UCLA is big and powerful,
relying on its net game to win matches.
UCLA features a blend of experience and youth.
The team returns four starters from last year and
adds to this mix freshmen Brandon Taliaferro, a 6-
foot-5 setter, and Adam Naeve, a 6-foot-10 middle
blocker. Along with Stanford freshman outside hit
ter Andy Witt, these two were the top recruits in the
country. They join 6-foot-7 senior outside hitter Paul
Nihipali, a candidate for player of the year much like
Stanford's own Mike Ijambert, and 6-foot-8 senior
middle blocker Tom Stilwell as the team's other two
key players. Together, the sue Bruin starters average
6-foot-7.5, a taily formidable physical presence, even
