# The 						envelope please
## High school senior anticipates her approaching college choices 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
Editor's note: The following
article is the third in an occa
sional series following the col
lege application process of an
"average" high school senior
living in Silver Spring, Md.
Katie Nelson, 17, applied to
Stanford last December. If ac
cepted, she will probably be
come a member of the class of
2001.
Three weeks from today, the
Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions will mail letters to
thousands of hopeful, stressed
out high school seniors. Three
and a half weeks from today,
after the letters arrive and
many of these seniors learn
they have been denied a spot in
the class of 2001, the Admis
sions Office will get a bit more
feedback than it would proba
bly wish for.
" There are literally hun

dreds and hundreds and hun
dreds of letters and phone
calls," said Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid James Mon
toya. "We gear up for a full
week of phone calls from disap
pointed students and parents."
For the truly outraged, a
phone call isn't sufficient.
When Montoya arrives at work
on the Monday after letters
have been sent, "it's not un
usual for students and parents
to be waiting at the door," he
said. "Last year, a woman wait
ed outside the window" of Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's office.
This year, with 16,800 stu
dents vying for about 1,610
spots, more applicants than
ever before will get the notori
ous skinny envelope.
Katie Nelson is hoping she's
not one of these people. At the
same time, she realizes nothing

is certain. "Honestly, I think so
many people apply, and 90 per
cent are qualified to go," she said.
"It could go either way. I'll be
thrilled if I get in, but I won't be
surprised if I don't."
Whatever happens with Stan
ford, Nelson can rest assured
she's going somewhere next year:
In early February, she was accept
ed by the honors program at the
University of Maryland. "I was re
ally happy," she said. "But I had a
pretty strong feeling I would get
in. Maryland isn't really the place
I want to go."
Nelson said she's unsure of
which school is the place she real
ly wants to go. "I have absolutely
no idea. I go back and forth. For a
while, I thought I should go to
Maryland and save $25,000 a
year. Then I thought I should go
to Stanford. Then I thought
maybe I'd like to go to Macalester
(College, in Minnesota), a small
school."
Throughout the application
process, Nelson has been hesitant
to pin her hopes on Stanford, and
recent events have only rein
forced this hesitance. In the hon
ors program in which she is en
rolled at Richard Montgomery
High School, "three people ap
plied early (to Stanford), and all
three people got deferred," she
said. "I was really surprised, espe
cially about one because I know
her brother goes there. She has
close to a 4.0 (GPA) and 1,500 on
her SATs. And she's an art per
son, the best artist I know."
According to Montoya, deferral
or rejection of students who ap
pear to be shoo-ins is inevitable.
In such cases, "there is not one el
ement of (a student's admission)
files we can point to and say, This
is why you didn't get in,' " Mon
toya said. "What I say is, 'Other
applicants are more compelling.'"
Admission is not simply based
on grades, class standing and test
scores, Montoya said. Essays and
teacher evaluations are also cru
cial. Teacher evaluations are not
called recommendations, Mon
toya pointed out but instead are
"reference forms."
"It's not a recommendation.
It's a description of how a student
approaches the particular subject

of the class and the impact of the
student in the classroom and the
style in which the student best
presents academic material,"
Montoya said.
With the growth in recent
years of an entire admissions in
dustry — manifesting itself in the
form of consultants and SAT prep
courses — many applicants and
parents are savvier than ever. Yet
despite a slick appearance, Mon
toya said, the real student in
evitably shows through.
For example, with the personal
essay "we assume this is going to
be students' best piece of work,
reviewed by teachers, parents,
friends and assorted others,"
Montoya said. "An extremely
well-written and sophisticated
essay will not make the difference
between a student getting in and
not getting in.
"If a student has a brilliant
essay and less than stellar Eng
lish grades and scores on the SAT
11, I could imagine reaching the
conclusion that the student had
significant help," Montoya said.
Montoya added that students'
responses to the shorter ques
tions can be more revealing than
their responses to the essay ques
tion because less time is usually
spent on short answers.
For Nelson, questions about
the essay are moot by now be
cause she turned in her applica
tion months ago. "It was a big
cram to get everything out in Jan
uary," she said. "Now I can sit
back and wait."
During this waiting period, she
is enjoying her last few months of
high school. Despite uncertainty
about her future, she is taking full
advantage of the present. In Feb
ruary, Nelson celebrated her 18th
birthday by attending a midnight
show of "The Empire Strikes
Back" with friends, and she went
snowboarding the weekend be
fore.
"I fell, like, 300 times," she
said. "I spent the whole weekend
sitting on the mountain trying to
get up.
In kung fu, which is one of sev
eral extracurricular activities
Nelson pursues, she just moved
from the beginning to the inter
mediate class. "I got sparring
gear, including a helmet," she
said. "I'm really, really excited
about this whole sparring thing.
I'm just about able to do the splits
now."
