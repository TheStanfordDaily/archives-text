## High school senior anticipates her approaching college choices 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
Editor's note: The following
article is the third in an occa
sional series following the col
lege application process of an
"average" high school senior
living in Silver Spring, Md.
Katie Nelson, 17, applied to
Stanford last December. If ac
cepted, she will probably be
come a member of the class of
2001.
Three weeks from today, the
Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions will mail letters to
thousands of hopeful, stressed
out high school seniors. Three
and a half weeks from today,
after the letters arrive and
many of these seniors learn
they have been denied a spot in
the class of 2001, the Admis
sions Office will get a bit more
feedback than it would proba
bly wish for.
" There are literally hun

dreds and hundreds and hun
dreds of letters and phone
calls," said Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid James Mon
toya. "We gear up for a full
week of phone calls from disap
pointed students and parents."
For the truly outraged, a
phone call isn't sufficient.
When Montoya arrives at work
on the Monday after letters
have been sent, "it's not un
usual for students and parents
to be waiting at the door," he
said. "Last year, a woman wait
ed outside the window" of Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's office.
This year, with 16,800 stu
dents vying for about 1,610
spots, more applicants than
ever before will get the notori
ous skinny envelope.
Katie Nelson is hoping she's
not one of these people. At the
same time, she realizes nothing
