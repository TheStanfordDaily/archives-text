# Baseball visits Arizona State
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
The No. 6 Stanford men's base
ball team (16-6, 3-0 Pacific 10
Southern Division) will head to
Tempe, Ariz., this weekend to take
on No. 11 Arizona State (14-8. 2-
4). This marks the first conference
road trip for the Card, who opened
Six-Pac play last weekend with a
sweep against USC.
The Sun Devils have played an
extremely difficult schedule this
year, already having played the top
three teams in the nation. Seven of
their eight losses have come
against top-25 opponents, sue of
the seven against top three teams.
Loss No. 8 came against UC-Santa
Barbara, who took two of three
from the Card at Sunken Diamond
earlier this year.
Leading the ASU offense is
junior Dan McKinley. A second
team pre-season All-American,
McKinley is batting .385 with 37
hits and 6 homeruns this season.

The outfielder has hit safely in 12
of the last 13 games. Sophomore
third baseman Andrew Beinbrink,
one of last season's top freshmen,
has also stepped up for the Sun
Devils. He has a team leading 27
RBIs, has 27 hits, 23 runs scored
and two stolen bases. Beinbrink
has hit safely in 14 of the last 15
games.
Junior Ryan Bradley (3-2) leads
ASU on the mound. He has
stepped up as the Sun Devil's top
relief pitcher, posting a 1.71 ERA
while acquiring four saves. He is
also a third team pre-season All-
American and is second on the
ASU squad with 32 strikeouts.
For Stanford, sophomore Tony
Cogan (3-1) has gone above and
beyond the call of duty as the
team's closer. Cogan has pitched
10 innings in his last two outings,
allowing only one run. He leads
Stanford with a 0.58 ERA.
"I go in and I know they won't
score," Cogan said. "It is my job to
pitch back-to-back (games)."

Junior Kyle Peterson and
sophomore Jody Gerut were
named co-Six-Pac players of the
week for their efforts against USC.
Peterson pitched a complete game
shutout for the victory last Friday
and has struck out 55 batters this
season. While playing stellar
defense, Gerut is batting .402 with
a 8 doubles and a team leading 34
RBIs.
Cardinal leadoff man, junior
Joe Kilburg, is batting .422 and
has scored a team leading 32 runs.
Sophomore Tony Schrager, who
started the season as Stanford's
leadoff hitter, returned to the line
up Tuesday against USF with a
homerun in his first at bat.
With Schrager's injury three
weeks ago, Kilburg moved from
right field to second base, opening
up that position for freshman
Edmund Muth. Muth has taken
full advantage of this opportunity,
compiling a .404 batting average
with four doubles, four homeruns
and 14 RBIs in 9 starts.
