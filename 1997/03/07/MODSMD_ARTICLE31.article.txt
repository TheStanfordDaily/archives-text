# Women's gymnasts to compete with Utes
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team will face one of its
toughest competitions of the
year tonight. The Cardinal
squad, currently enjoying a
three-meet winning streak, will
challenge No. 4 Utah on the
Utes' home ground.
The Utah squad is a usual
contender for the NCAA champi
onship, taking almost every
national title in the past decade.
Head coach Lisa Izzi said the
dual-meet experience against the
Utes — the Cardinal's last
match before heading off to
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships in two weeks — can only
help the Stanford team.
The Utes "are a very strong
team — the dynasty of college
women's gymnastics — and it's
going to be a big meet," Izzi
said. "For any team that is

building to become the nation's
top, this is one meet that will be
a great opportunity."
The last two months have
been a nonstop battle against
the nation's top teams for the
Cardinal squad, and the team
has boosted its consistency and
confidence level in the last sever
al high-scoring meets in particu
lar.
The meet is expected to
attract an audience of more than
12,000 people, and Izzi added
that the meet will help the Card
to prepare mentally for the big
audiences of next month's
NCAA postseason meets.
"You can either have the big
crowd, and the noise push you
apart or keep you together,"
sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami said. "Hopefully, it'll
help us stay together for the big
meets."
According to Murakami, team
members have been careful in

their conditioning, and after this
week's tough workouts, the Card
is "set to go" tonight.
The squad is scheduled to put
up five all-arounders against the
Utes talented squad of at least
four All-Americans. The gym
nasts include co-captains junior
Keri Monahan and Murakami,
sophomores Tracey Kohl and
Katie Fitzpatrick and freshman
Larissa Fontaine, who together
dominated the top five places at
last week's meet against No. 12
Oregon State.
The team will continue to
experiment with its lineup in
order to "see what scores people
who have shown increasing con
sistency [in practice] can score
as well as give others a chance to
rest," Izzi said.
Freshman Sarah Harding,
who has competed on the floor
since her electrifying debut two
weeks ago, will not perform in
this meet.

Harding has just recovered
from a lower back stress fracture
that kept her from practicing for
four months.
Junior Christie Jones, who
will not compete on the beam in
tonight's meet, will take fresh
man Annie Thananopavarn's
place in the vault line-up. The
Card will put junior Amy Neil on
the beam with the five all
arounders.
"I think our team is looking
great, and we'll show them what
we've got," Murakami said. "It
will definitely be good to finish
the main chunk of the season
strong before going into Pac-lOs,
to have confidence on what we
can do, confidence in each
other."
Murakami added that she'd
like to surprise the Utes.
"They don't see us as a threat,
and I want them to see us as a
threat," she said. "But we're get
ting there."
