## Indoor track season ends 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
After a successful home meet
that started off the outdoor sea
son, nine Stanford athletes are
in Indianapolis this weekend to
end the indoor season by partici
pating in the NCAA Indoor
Track and Field nationals.
The group, which includes six
distance runners, one sprinter, a
heptathelete and a vaulter, rep
resents an unprecedented num
ber of athletes for the indoor
championships.
According to Vin Lananna,
director of track and field, "This
is the largest group that we have
ever had at the NCAA indoor
championships, and we have
representation in a variety of
events.
"It will be our goal to have a
large group of Ail-Americans in
cross country and indoor and
outdoor competition, and I feel
we're well on our way," Lananna
said.
On the men's side, junior Jon
Weldon and senior J.J. White
will run in the 3,000 meters.
White, who is coming off a win in
the 800 meters at last Satur
day's four-way meet, qualified
for the 3,000 with a time of 8
minutes 4.72 seconds.
Weldon qualified with a run
of 8:08.47 at the Canon IV Invi
tational in February. The two
will face particularly stiff compe
tition from Ryan Wilson of
Arkansas, one of the competi
tion's favorites.
Cardinal senior Rob Reeder
will compete in the 5,000 meters
and junior Jason Lunn will run
the mile, both having qualified
at the Cannon IV invitational
with times of 14:03.61 and
4:03.61, respectively. Reeder
will face some competition from
Dan Browne of Army, who is
recovering from a stress frac
ture.
In the 200 meters, senior Jim

mie Johnson will take part in the
championships after capturing
the 200-meter title at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
meet in February. Johnson will
have to go up against Texas-El
Paso favorite Obadele Thomp
son, considered one of the top
sprinters in the country.
To round off the men's team,
freshman sensation Toby
Stevenson will compete in the
pole vault after qualifying by
breaking a school record at the
MPSF. Although going to nation
als as a freshman may be a lot of
pressure, Stevenson isn't fazed.
"I'm not going in looking for
the win, but I have a great
chance of winning," said Steven
son. "Right now the key for me is
making 18 (feet) and to keep
pressing those guys higher," he
added.
Vaulting coach Casey Roche
concurred.
"If Toby makes 18, he will
place very high, perhaps even
the top three," Roche said.
Favorites to win the men's
team competition are NCAA
cross country runner-up
Arkansas, George Mason, South
Carolina, Florida and UCLA.
On the women's side, a pair of
distance runners and a jumper
will compete. Seniors Sarna
Renfro and Monal Chokshi will
take part in the 3,000 meters
and the mile run respectively
after having qualified at the
Cannon IV invitational and the
MPSF. The 5,000 is expected to
be a battle between Wisconsin's
Kathy Butler and Arizona's Amy
Skieresz. In the mile, Miesha
Marzell of Georgetown and But
ler are once again favorites.
The other Cardinal female
athlete is sophomore hep
tathelete Trayce Lawyer, who
will participate in the high jump.
Favorites to win the women's
team competition are Texas,
Wisconsin, Louisiana State,
Florida and Villanova.
