# Softball looks to bounce back this weekend against Arizona and ASU
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The softball team hopes its hitting
gets hot in Arizona this weekend
when it takes on 12th-ranked Arizona
State Saturday and top-ranked Ari
zona on Sunday.
The Cardinal was unable to get
anything going last weekend when it
played the Sun Devils here at Stan
ford. Arizona State's pitching was not
dominating, but the Cardinal did not
put itself in position to score many
runs.
Most of the Stanford outs were pop
flies, limiting the opportunity for
Stanford batters to beat out throws or
for the Sun Devils to make errors that
would put more runners on base.
No one on the team has distin
guished herself as the offensive lead
er. The hits have been typically well
spread out, and the team has seen
some strong offensive games by
sophomore outfielder Shane Ander
son, sophomore pitcher Marcy
Crouch and freshman catcher Kelly
Wiginton.
The team could really benefit from
one of these players or someone else

taking charge and consistently pro
viding big games.
ASU also put up a significant num
ber of runs to support its pitching last
weekend, scoring six runs in game
one and seven runs in game two. This
was one of the few times this season
that Stanford pitchers have been lit
up, and the offense was not able to
compensate.
Crouch "pitched well. There were
just a few defensive mistakes that
caused us to lose the game," sopho
more pitcher Becky Blevins said. "I
just had a bad day against ASU. It
happens."
The pitching squad should be able
to contain ASU and Arizona this
weekend. Last weekend, many of the
Sun Devils' hits were on the verge of
being outs.
If Blevins and Crouch can pitch as
well as they have most of the season,
the team should have a good chance of
winning.
"We're basically looking to get
some revenge against Arizona State,"
said Blevins. "We performed far
below our potential last weekend, and
we're looking to put that behind us by
having a solid series."

The team needs to get some
momentum going against Arizona
State on Saturday, as Sunday's game
is against Arizona, which won the col
lege World Series last year and has
been consistently ranked in the top
three for the last several years.
"The Pac-10 is so tough that any
body can beat anyone on a given day.
Arizona is a great team, but our team
is capable of beating them," Blevins
said.
The team's overall record of 10-11
is pretty good considering its highly
competitive schedule, but the Cardi
nal fell to 0-4 in the Pac-10 with the
two losses to ASU last weekend. The
upcoming weekend series is impor
tant in terms of Pac-10 victories and
getting a regional spot in the postsea
son.
The last time the team had a rough
weekend, against Pacific and UCLA
on Feb. 15 and 16, it rebounded the
following week by winning five out of
seven games.
The team has shown that it is capa
ble of beating the best and coming
back from a poor series. This weekend
it will have to do both to come out
ahead.
