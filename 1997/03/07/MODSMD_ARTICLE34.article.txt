# Water polo challenges Bruins for No. 1 spot
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team has been steadily
moving up the rankings this
season and has a chance to be
ranked first nationally after its
tournament this weekend at de
Guerre Pool.
"We are looking to win our
home tournament and be No. 1,"
said head coach Ben Quittner. "I
would really like to go undefeat
ed [the rest of the year] and be
12-1" on the season.
The second-ranked Cardinal
will begin the weekend with a
game today at 4 p.m. against
UCLA. The Bruins are ranked
first nationally and are the only
team to beat Stanford thus far
this season.
The Stanford Invitational
begins tomorrow morning. The
Cardinal's first opponent will be
UC-Santa Barbara at 12:15
p.m. The Stanford squad will
continue opening round play at
5:15 p.m. with a match against
Michigan.
Facing these two teams will
be a welcome change for Stan
ford because the Gauchos and
Wolverines are among the few
teams in the tournament the
Card has not played thus far
this season.
The 12-team tournament
will conclude Sunday with the
semifinals and final. Also in the
tournament are Pacific, Clare
mont, Mount Scripps, UC-
Santa Cruz, San Diego State,
UC-Davis, Team Canada and,
most important, third-ranked

Cal. Stanford has yet to meet
the Golden Bears this year but
could meet them Sunday. Stan
ford displaced Cal in the rank
ings this week to become No. 2.
The Cardinal could also meet
UCLA again Sunday, as today's
match is not a tournament
game. UCLA, which started its
varsity program two years
before the Cardinal, is led by
two starters from the senior
national team, including goal
keeper Nicolle Pain. In addition
to these two standouts, the Bru
ins also have senior national
team reserves and a number of
junior national team players.
Stanford is led this season
offensively by freshmen Suze
Gardner and Ellen Estes. But
defensively, the Cardinal relies
upon the strong play of sopho
more goalkeeper Heather
Crary, a junior national team
player. In addition to these play
ers, Stanford depends on the
performances of senior co-cap
tain Alice Cathcart and sopho
more Lindsay Welsh.
UCLA's only loss of the sea
son has been to Cal, and the
Bruins narrowly beat the Stan
ford squad 7-6 in the Cardinal's
season-opening tournament at
UC-San Diego. If Stanford does
beat UCLA today, it will also
need to win the tournament to
ensure capturing the No. 1
ranking.
"We have to look at this
weekend one game at a time,"
Quittner said. "If we win
[today], we gain confidence and
can go on and beat UCLA in the
tournament."
