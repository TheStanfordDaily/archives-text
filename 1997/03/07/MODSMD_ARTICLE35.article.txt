Who knew John Steinbeck's
writing would apply to golf?
"Don't look back — something
may be gaining on you," the
author once wrote.
The Stanford women's golf
team will be heeding Steinbeck's
advice when it plays its first round
of the Spartan Invitational in Mon
terey today.
The Cardinal hopes to shake off
bad memories of its last tourna
ment while seeking to defend its
No. 2 ranking among other top
competitors like San Jose State
and Arizona State at this event.
The Stanford squad placed a
disappointing seventh at its last
tournament, scoring its highest
team stroke play this season.
"We're just going to forget
about the last tournament and

play like our old selves at this one,"
said senior co-captain Mhairi
McKay.
The three-round tournament,
which ends Sunday, will be held at
the Ford Ord-Bayonet Golf Course
in Monterey.
While senior Andrea Baxter will
not play in the tournament, she
will he cheering her teammates on
today.
The sixth-ranked intercolle
giate player, who is right-handed,
broke her left wrist in a snow
boarding accident last month. She
will be out for a majority of the sea
son.
Without the Card's second
seeded Baxter, the rest of the team
is challenged to focus on each
stroke and step its game up a
notch.
"Instead of relying on Andrea to
save me if I miss a stroke, it forces
[me] to shoot lower scores," fresh

man Jae Jean Ro said.
In team golf, the top four scores
of individual stroke play per round
is added for a team total. The
team-stroke format produces
greater lead swings per hole,
heightening the stakes of individu
al play.
Ro said the camaraderie of the
team helps boost her psychological
confidence and mental stamina.
"When I'm out there not having
a good day, I don't have to worry
about the pressures of teammates
being bitter," she said.
A unified Card will certainly
have plenty of opportunities to
encourage each other in this week
end's tournament.
The Bayonet Golf Course is
known to be difficult because of its
visually deceptive layout. While
most courses are lined with rough
or tall pines, the Bayonet course
has dense Douglas firs with low

branches, making the course look
unusually narrow.
Once the ball disappears from
the fairway, it's bye-bye birdie.
The strategy to plav the course
is simple — avoid the trees. The
ability to avoid them — well, that's
a more difficult task.
McKay, who has played the
course twice, dreads the trees.
"I've been there many times.
Trying to hack your way out is not
very fun," said McKay, who fin
ished third at the Spartan In vita
tional as a sophomore.
She advised that the best bel
is to hit low and take the short
est route back to the green
McKay has seen the mistake oi
inexperienced, bold golfers mak
ing courier shots eff the fairway
so the Cardinal squad will focrn
on playing a percentage game
using a 3-wood or iron to hit ofl
the tee for accuracy.
