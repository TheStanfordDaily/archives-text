# Men's golfers to swing away in the Duck
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Despite an early winter season
success in Monterrey, Mexico, the
men's golf team played poorly at
the Rancho Murietta tournament
last week due to a difficult golf
course and an uncharacteristically
rough day. Despite its second-place
finish in the tournament, the
squad's performance in the 54-hole
competition was less than stellar.
"This is the toughest golf course
we've played on so far," freshman
Dusty Brett said. "The fairways are
tight with a lot of out-of-bounds
areas. The greens are very undulat
ed and firm, which makes it diffi
cult to stop or control your ball."
Although the team started out

strong in the first 18-hole round
Monday morning, it slowly
declined in the following rounds. A
team score of 298 put the Cardinal
in the lead in the first round, and
despite a second-round score of
309, the squad held its lead until
the third round, which was"the
worst round by far we've played all
year," Brett said.
Posting a 333, with only sopho
more Joel Kribel breaking 80 in the
final round, the Card still managed
to finish in second-place amidst the
relatively easy field of teams.
"All of our scores skyrocketed,"
said senior Conrad Ray. This was
"probably the worst we could've
played. Hopefully, a field like this
will motivate us to work harder
and help us realize that anytime we

go out we can't take anything for
granted."
As Kribel, who finished second
in the individual standings, said:
"It didn't work out as we wanted.
We should have finished first. Ran
cho Murietta was disappointing,
but hopefully we can pull it togeth
er next week at Oregon. The main
reason for this tournament was to
get ready for Oregon."
The squad will travel to Eugene
for the Oregon Duck Tournament
early next week. The Duck will be
an important test for this team. In
men's golf, teams make the region
al tournament based on their per
formances compared to those of
the other teams in their respective
districts. Because the Duck will
host several of Stanford's district

rivals, it will "definitely be the
biggest tournament of winter quar
ter," Ray said.
"The Duck will be one of the
most important tournaments of
this season. We were off to a good
start in Mexico, but it will be
important to play well at the Duck
for our spring hopes because this
will set a precedent for next quar
ter," Brett said.
The Duck will follow the same
format as the Rancho Murietta.
with two 18-hole rounds Monday
and one on Tuesday. When asked
about entering this important
tournament immediately following
such a disappointment, Ray said.
"If we can go up to Oregon and
have a good tournament, last week
will be quickly forgotten."
