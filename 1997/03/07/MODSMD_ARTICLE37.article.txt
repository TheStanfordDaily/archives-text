# Men's gymnastics visits Cal, hosts Santa Barbara
## 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Bruised and banged up, the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
will seek to repair its lineup and
NCAA tournament chances in a
competition tonight at California
and tomorrow at home against
UC-Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal will take on Cal
and Michigan at 7 tonight at Har
mon Gym and face the Gauchos
at the same time tomorrow at
Burnham Pavilion.
This week marks one of the
most physically and emotionally
draining weeks for the Cardinal
as it competes in its second two
meet weekend in a row. Never
have the men competed so fre
quently in a 10-day span.
To add to the already difficult
schedule, the Card must deal
with the loss of senior all
arounder Jamie Ellis and fill the
vacancies left by his absence.
Ellis dislocated his shoulder
during a floor routine at UCLA
Feb. 27. An MRI performed this
week indicated that Ellis had
torn the labrum in his shoulder.
Team physician Michael Dilling
ham recommended surgery to
repair the damage. It is unknown
as to whether Ellis will see action
for the remainder of the season.
If he does have surgery, it will be
his second shoulder surgery in
the past two years.
"Dillingham said that my
shoulder needs to be operated on
again and left it up to me to
decide whether or not it's worth
the risk of reinjuring and causing
more damage to my shoulder,
whether it's worth attempting to
compete and train," Ellis said.
"He highly recommended that I

don't do any
thing basically
other than
pommel horse,
because the
risk is mini
mal, and in the
other events
the risk is
high."
The Cardi
nal already had
to compensate
for Ellis' loss in
last Saturday's
competition by
putting up new
routines and
skills and
returned home
weary.
Going into
this weekend's
matchups, the
Stanford squad
must realize
that it is no
longer experi
menting —
these changes,
especially the
substitute per
formances, will
more than like
ly be perma
nent.
"Right now

we are going to have to go full
speed; everyone has to be train
ing routines," said senior co-cap
tain Keith Wiley.
Winning the NCAAs "is just
going to be a much bigger chal
lenge. Even before Jamie's inci
dent, we knew it was going to be
really hard," he said. "Now it's
going to be even more difficult.
All we can do is train our hardest
and hope for the best."

Wiley is left as the lone all
arounder from last year's squad
and the NCAA championship
team from two years ago. Fresh
man Jason Katsampes and
sophomore Scott Finklestein are
the only two all-arounders to join
Wiley this season.
The competitions this week
end should provide no new obsta
cles for the team, other than self
imposed ones.
Stanford has taken on Cal five

times already this season, closing
the point differential at each
juncture. Although the Card has
yet to beat Cal, it is focused main
ly on beating the Bears at
NCAAs. Neither Michigan nor
Santa Barbara should pose a
mqjor threat.
In fact, the weekend's primary
challenge should be regrouping
and reformulating routines and
lineups and rebuilding both the
internal and external.
