# WELCOME TO JEOPARDY!

WITH YOUR HOST,
ALEX TRIBEK!

ALEX I m very excited about tonight's
show, the final game of this week's
Tournament of Champions. Remember that
the contestant with the most money at the
end of the show wins $100,000 on top of his
earnings for today. Everyone else wins a box
of shoe polish and a free subscription to Golf
magazine. But before we start, let's meet our
contestants. Contestant No. 1 is Joe
Pantolino, and according to my cue cards you
work as a bouncer at the Pants-Off Club in
San Francisco.
PANTOLINO: That's right, Alex.
ALEX: Mr. Pantolino, I understand you have
recently been released from jail. I'm sure you
have a clever and amusing anecdote relating
to that.
PANTOLINO: Actually, Alex, my time at
San Quentin was very traumatic, and I would
rather not talk about that.
ALEX: My, aren't we a little touchy, Mr. I-
Come-From-the-Chain-Gang? Well let's move
on to contestant No. 2, Miss China Blue.
According to my notes, you work as an
investment banker during the day and as a
cheap Times Square hooker by night. Which
leads to the obvious question, "When do you
sleep?"
CHINA: I don't sleep, Alex. I'm a vampire.
ALEX: Oh, good answer. Finally, our tnird
contestant is Uncle Vanya. I understand you
are not really real but rather a figment of
Anton Chekhov's imagination. I'll expect you
to do well in the category of "World Drama,"
should that come up.
VANYA: Thanks, Alex.
ALEX: Well, let's get started. The categories

for the first round are: "Obscure Rivers in
Chechnya," "Quotes Having To Do with
Decapitation," " 'T' and 'A'," "Disgusting
Bodily Fluids" and, finally, "Famous Dicks."
CHINA: I'll take "Famous Dicks" for $100,
Alex
ALEX: I'll bet you will. (Reading) "This
dick couldn't perform his duties and had to
pull out early. '
iPantolino buzzes first.)
ALEX: Mr. Pantolino.
PANTOLINO: Who's Tricky Dick?
ALEX: Right. Richard Nixon. Select again.
PANTOLINO: "Famous Dicks" for $500.
ALEX: "This dick got himself into a hole
and finally had to be cut out."
(China buzzes first.)
ALEX: China Blue.
CHINA: Dipk Morris.
ALEX: Pleafee phrase your answer in the
form of a question.
CHINA: Who's Dick Morris?
ALEX: I don't know, hon, but the name
sounds familiar. (Laughs at own joke.) That's
right. Give her the money! But right now
we'll have to stop for a brief commercial
break. When we come back, we will play our
final round in Final Jeopardy! The category
today is, "Famous Shashanas." Please stay
with us.
(Commercial break follows.)
ALEX: Welcome back to "Jeopardy!" I'm
your host, Alex Trebek, and yes, I am smarter
than you are or ever will be. The last clue of
the evening is as follows, in the category of
"Famous Snashanas": "This Shashana is
often celebrated as a religious holiday, though

some people think she's actually a brand of
liquid detergent." (30 seconds pass, during
which we hear the annoying "Jeopardy!"
theme song.)
ALEX: China, let's start with you, since you
have the least money and look the most
concerned. You wrote: <reading) "Who is
Barbra Streisand?" Oh! Very close. Very close.
But not yet. I'm sorry. Let s see how much
you risked. <Reading) $2,000! This leaves you
now in last place, with $1.
CHINA: Th at's usually the way I end up,
anyway, Alex, by the end of the night. That's
why I don't quit my day job.
ALEX: Good call. Let's move on to our next
contestant. Uncle Vanya. You wrote: (reading)
"My life is miserable and 1 plan on shooting
myself after this show." I'm sorry, but that's
incorrect. And you risked: Ireading) "200
rubles." I'm sorrv, again, but we don't deal
with that kind of Communist stuff
(Uncle Vanya pulls out gun and shoots
himself.)
ALEX: Our last contestant is Mr. Pantolino.
You were ahead, Mr. Pantolino. Let's see what
you wrote. (Reading) "What's Rosh
Hashana?" And that's correct. And you bet:
(reading) $10,000. And you're the new
champion! Congratulations, Mr. Pantolino!
And thank you at home for watching. We'll
see you next time wit h another exciting game
of"Jeopardy!"
