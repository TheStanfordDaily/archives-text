# Editor's rant:

### 
You know what I hate the most about life? It's the fact that it
goes on. Sometimes things get really good and exciting and you just
want to freeze that moment 'cos you know that things won't stay
that cool for very long and you'll fall off the tree and break your
head or something awful like that. Like today, all these good things
kept happening followed by bad things, and you wonder why things
can't just stay the same, you know? This is where I start weeping.
Like sometimes I really enjoy doing Diversions, but sometimes it's
so frustrating I just feel like sticking my head in a toilet bowl and
calling out, "Stella!" Anyway. I want to finish with a gratuitous
mention of Tyler Neal, who's in my honors tutorial and who I
promised would put his name on the paper. This is for you, Tyler.
This week I had to write the big piece on top simply because
two of my writers flaked. So I'm always looking for able-bodied
folks to help me put together this page. If you have any interest in
writing for Diversions, send a writing sample to
daily.stanford.edu. And join the fun!
