# Fac Sen splits in discussion
## CIV-il rights 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting was the scene of sharp
disagreements over the wisdom
and scope of the proposed over
haul of the Program in Cul
tures, Ideas and Values.
The senate was not scheduled
to vote on the measure but to
comment on the issue instead
for the benefit of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies. The
committee is currently consider
ing the report of the CIV Review
and Design Committee, chaired
by English Prof. Rob Polhemus.
The main recommendation
of Polhemus' committee is to re
place the current three-quarter
CIV sequence with a program
called "introduction to the Hu
manities." This would require
all freshmen to take a large lec
ture course for fall quarter and
smaller group classes for the re
maining two quarters.
In a speech delivered before
the floor was opened for com
ment, Psychology Prof. Ann
Fernald, undergraduate studies
committee chair, called CIV "an
excellent program" and stressed
what she saw as the conserva
tive nature of the reform.
