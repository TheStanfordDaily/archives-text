# Fac Sen splits in discussion
## CIV-il rights 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting was the scene of sharp
disagreements over the wisdom
and scope of the proposed over
haul of the Program in Cul
tures, Ideas and Values.
The senate was not scheduled
to vote on the measure but to
comment on the issue instead
for the benefit of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies. The
committee is currently consider
ing the report of the CIV Review
and Design Committee, chaired
by English Prof. Rob Polhemus.
The main recommendation
of Polhemus' committee is to re
place the current three-quarter
CIV sequence with a program
called "introduction to the Hu
manities." This would require
all freshmen to take a large lec
ture course for fall quarter and
smaller group classes for the re
maining two quarters.
In a speech delivered before
the floor was opened for com
ment, Psychology Prof. Ann
Fernald, undergraduate studies
committee chair, called CIV "an
excellent program" and stressed
what she saw as the conserva
tive nature of the reform.
"There's 90 percent conserva
tion, and we can agree or disagree
on what that 10 percent means."
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
was one senator who clearly
sought to disagree. Perry, who has
taught CIV and its precursor,
Western Culture, took great issue
with the idea of changing the cur
rent name of CIV.
Perry was on the task force
that studied the Western Culture
requirement in the years prior to
changing it into CIV. He said he
remembered the extensive and
active discussion of that change
as showing "the campus at its
best."
However, he said, the process
was highly misrepresented in the
national press and came in for
great criticism from conservative
figures such as former Secretary of
Education William Bennett.
Abandoning the title of CIV, he
said, would be "seen by the larger
community as a capitulation to the
zealots, a repudiation of CIV."
He added that it was the specif
ic gesture of changing the name
from Western Culture to CIV
which had "warped" the public
perception of the change, such that
few recognized the essential conti

nuity in the reforms.
"We didn't think [changing the
name] was important nine years
ago, but it was," Periy said.
University President Gerhard
Casper cautioned against paying
too much attention to how the
media would construe the matter.
"If the Wall Street Journal is
going to dictate curricular policies
at Stanford, then God help us. I
want no part of it," Casper said.
He added that a university
should never hold back from re
forming something just because it
had invested great effort in achiev
ing the status quo.
Perry also challenged the new
name on the grounds that the idea
of introducing students to the
ways and means of humanistic in
quiry might draw emphasis away
from the texts. The meeting briefly
dissolved into laughter when he
suggested that he had never met a
Stanford professor as interesting
as the texts he taught.
Casper said, however, that the
emphasis on introducing students
to what "the humanities" means is
essential because of an increasing
trend in this country towards a
view where "people bring no un
derstanding any more (of the hu
manities) when they come as
freshmen."
He said giving students a
chance to be "captured" by the hu
manities should be an important

part of the freshman requirement.
In addition to addressing con
cerns about what the change
might mean, senators also spoke
on the issue of exactly how big a
change it was and how it should be
made.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
said a replacement of CIV should
not be considered until the pro
gram had been reviewed and given
a chance to answer any concerns
emerging from such a review.
"A review of CIV itself, under
its own legislation, is not what we
have here.... At some point in the
history of the committee, a deci
sion was made not to review CIV"
but instead to replace it, he said
with visible emotion.
McCall, who is a lecturer in the
Literature and the History of
Ideas CIV track, asked the senate
to "just consider how different an
atmosphere we would be in" if the
committee had proposed a pilot
program involving about one
eighth of each freshman class in
stead of replacing CIV "summari
ly and without due process."
He said that such a pilot plan
could run until the next time CIV
came up for its regular five-year
review, at which point faculty
could see if the alternative ap
peared attractive.
Echoing Fernald's introduc
tion, administrators stressed what
they saw as the limited nature of

the overhaul.
Appealing personally and em
phatically to McCall, Casper urged
him to believe that CIV was "not a
defendant under indictment."
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven called it "an
enormous exaggeration" to refer
to the changes an "elimination" of
CIV, as McCall had.
While the most extensive
speeches either attacked or de
fended the reforms, several points
were discussed with more agree
ment. German Studies Prof. Rus
sell Berman, speaking for the Divi
sion of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages, said several of the
changes would assist in bringing
faculty into the program from
other smaller departments.
He noted that many depart
ments with small faculties would
find it possible to teach a two-quar
ter track when a three-quarter
track was impossible.
Berman, who has taught in the
Myth and Modernity CIV track,
echoed several professors' senti
ments in commending the new
plan for eliminating what he
called the "snippet factor" â€” the
problem of too many texts being
taught toe superficially in a short,
time.
On this point, even Perry was
prepared to praise the reform.
"Eliminate everything else, and
I'll be a fan," Perry said.
