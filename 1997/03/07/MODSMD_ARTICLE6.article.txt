# Rice talks about status of women
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
In reporting to the Faculty
Senate on the status of female
faculty members at Stanford,
Provost Condoleezza Rice
painted a picture of noteworthy
progress but also recognized
the considerable distance that
still needs to be covered.
She spoke as a foliow-up to a
report commissioned by then-
Provost Gerald Lieberman in
1993 and also in response to re
quests from the Women's Fac
ulty Caucus.
Rice cited several relevant
statistics about women faculty
and their status. In 1993,
women made up 15.8 percent of
the total faculty and 11.2 per
cent of tenured faculty. In
1996, those figures were 17.8
percent and 13.3 percent, re
spectively.
She called this "slow, steady
progress in the right direction,
but I would emphasize that the
figures are not flying up."
Of the 245 assistant profes
sors hired between 1984 and 1989,
41 percent of the women are now
tenured, vs. 34 percent of men, fig
ures which Rice said indicate that
"there seems to be no gender ef
fect."
Another figure Rice found en
couraging was the fact that the av
erage tenured woman at Stanford

now makes 92.5 percent as much
as a tenured man, up from 87 per
cent in 1992.
Rice said that figure was closer
to 100 percent in many areas. Per
centages were in the 80s in the
areas of engineering and natural
sciences where women are "quite
newcomers," she said.
In response to a question on
how Stanford compares to other
schools on such issues, Rice said
Stanford's relative position had
changed little since the 1993 re

port, when Stanford ranked 17th.
in a sample of 21 universities.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo sug
gested that the University set spe
cific goals for the hiring and pro
motion of women which would
have to be met by 2005. The idea
did not appeal to Rice.
She said she was "very wary" of
thinking in terms of figures that
had to be met and preferred work
ing on a case-by-case basis, mak
ing the best decision in each indi
vidual situation.

Another issue Rice covered ex
tensively was accommodating
family life into teaching duties.
She praised the work of the Work
Family Center and its director,
Kathleen Sullivan.
She referred again to Sullivan
as a possible recourse for the com
plaint of Civil Engineering Prof.
Jeffrey Koseff, who cited his per
sonal experience that child care
centers on campus were "becom
ing less and less sensitive to the
needs of faculty."
