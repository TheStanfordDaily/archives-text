surance and increased space for
student organizations.

ever wanted to know about student
affairs," the forum featured direc
tors of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, Residential Education, Cow
eli Student Health Center, Admis
sions and Financial Aid, the Haas
Center for Public Service and Reg
istration and Academic Support.
According to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
the forum, which will take place
once a quarter from now on, is in
tended to "eliminate the feeling
that students are not listened to.
"We are partners in the educa
tional experience," Edmonds said.

After each pan
elist gave a short
introduction, the
floor was opened
to questions from
the audience.
Doctoral stu

John Hall asked about the future of
the Bridge, the in-house, 24-hour
peer-counseling program, which
currently suffers from seismic and
foundation damage.
"To be honest, I think the pro
gram is in danger," Hall said.
"There seems to be no long-term
plan for allowing the program to
continue. It would be a real loss to
the University."
"There has been a concerted
effort on the part of Student Af
fairs to maintain the Bridge pro
gram," Dean of Students Marc
Wais replied, adding that there
will be no "Band-Aid solution" to
the Bridge's structural problems.
Senior Michael Putnam added
the "quarter-ization" of Stanford
life makes it "hard to get things
going and keep them going," a

problem compounded by the lack
of space in which student groups
can organize.
"There is not that much space
on campus," Edmonds responded.
"Be very aware that we are try

Edmonds added that once seis
mic restructuring is finished, cur
rently displaced departments will
move out of their temporary loca
tions. This move will open up pos
sible spaces for student organiza
tions.
At the end of the meeting, senior
Ijeslie Anne Hummel praised Tim
othy Stanton, director of the Haas
Center. Calling Stanton an "un
sung hero," Hummel added that
"the work that he oversees has
made a larger positive impact on my
undergraduate career at Stanford
than perhaps any other of the other
offices represented here."
"Hey, I admitted you," Montoya
protested, inspiring loud laughter
from the audience.
