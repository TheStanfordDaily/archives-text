The Office of Student Affairs
held a forum yesterday in order to
clarify its responsibilities and listen
to current student concerns.
Students, in turn, asked admin
istrators to address issues, includ
ing co-op housing for graduate stu
dents, improved student health in
surance and increased space for
student organizations.
Advertised as "all the things you
ever wanted to know about student
affairs," the forum featured direc
tors of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, Residential Education, Cow
eli Student Health Center, Admis
sions and Financial Aid, the Haas
Center for Public Service and Reg
istration and Academic Support.
According to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
the forum, which will take place
once a quarter from now on, is in
tended to "eliminate the feeling
that students are not listened to.
"We are partners in the educa
tional experience," Edmonds said.

After each pan
elist gave a short
introduction, the
floor was opened
to questions from
the audience.
Doctoral stu
dent Robert Rud
nitsky, a member
of the Graduate
Student Council,

asked about possible improvements
to student health insurance plans,
which currently do not include den
tal benefits or glasses or contact
lens prescription services.
Cowell Student Health Center
Director. Ira Friedman replied that
dental plans are "prohibitively ex
pensive," but that a new student
health plan, which has been in the
works for two years, will be an
nounced soon and available begin
ning next fall. The program will in
clude eye check-ups.
Students also voiced concern
over the lack of space for student or
ganizations. Coterminal student
