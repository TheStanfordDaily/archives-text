After an illustrious campaign
involving livestock, cotton candy
and Gerhard Casper, freshman
Matt Merrill was chosen Wednes
day night as Stanford's newest
Tree.
As Tree, Merrill will serve as
the Stanford Band's mascot and
attend sporting events and other
campus celebrations.
Merrill's predecessor in Tree
dom, junior Chris Cary, summa
rized Merrill's campaign with the
phrase, "Farm Animal Parade."
The campaign ended Wednesday
night after Merrill wrapped him
self in cotton candy and led a
throng of supporters and admir
ers to the Band Shak. Merrill
said the cotton candyman
episode was only one example of
the many ways in which his cam
paign was "touched by the hand
of God."
Other highlights of the cam
paign included an endorsement
speech by Gerhard Casper and an
animal parade involving goats,
horses, chickens and other farm
animals.

On the parade, Merrill said, "I
was riding this horse bareback in
tighty-whitey grundy underwear
with angel wings, drenched in
goat saliva."
Cary, who witnessed the pro
cession, said, "I've never seen so
many farm animals in my entire
life. I kept waiting for a bear to
come by on a ball, but a llama
came instead. It was like the
Fourth of July, Yom Kippur and

Canadian Thanksgiving all
rolled into one."
Another former Tree, junior
Chris Bonzon, also witnessed the
parade.
" 'Animal Farm' is a great
phrase that could be used to de
scribe the event," Bonzon said.
"I've never seen so many animals
in one place, except a petting zoo.
