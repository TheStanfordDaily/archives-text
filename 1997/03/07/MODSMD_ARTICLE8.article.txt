## 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
After an illustrious campaign
involving livestock, cotton candy
and Gerhard Casper, freshman
Matt Merrill was chosen Wednes
day night as Stanford's newest
Tree.
As Tree, Merrill will serve as
the Stanford Band's mascot and
attend sporting events and other
campus celebrations.
Merrill's predecessor in Tree
dom, junior Chris Cary, summa
rized Merrill's campaign with the
phrase, "Farm Animal Parade."
The campaign ended Wednesday
night after Merrill wrapped him
self in cotton candy and led a
throng of supporters and admir
ers to the Band Shak. Merrill
said the cotton candyman
episode was only one example of
the many ways in which his cam
paign was "touched by the hand
of God."
Other highlights of the cam
paign included an endorsement
speech by Gerhard Casper and an
animal parade involving goats,
horses, chickens and other farm
animals.

On the parade, Merrill said, "I
was riding this horse bareback in
tighty-whitey grundy underwear
with angel wings, drenched in
goat saliva."
Cary, who witnessed the pro
cession, said, "I've never seen so
many farm animals in my entire
life. I kept waiting for a bear to
come by on a ball, but a llama
came instead. It was like the
Fourth of July, Yom Kippur and

Canadian Thanksgiving all
rolled into one."
Another former Tree, junior
Chris Bonzon, also witnessed the
parade.
" 'Animal Farm' is a great
phrase that could be used to de
scribe the event," Bonzon said.
"I've never seen so many animals
in one place, except a petting zoo.

He took things to ridiculous lev
els."
According to Merrill, "The
best part of the campaign, other
than doing the stunts, was get
ting to work with people and live
stock." He added that "the Spi
der Man thing was pretty
damned fun," referring to a
stunt during Flicks in which he
rappelled from the rafters of
Memorial Auditorium.
"We were very proud that
they actually stopped the projec
tor and rewound Flicks because
of us. After that, we knew we
were on the right track," Merrill
said.
Merrill also described his ex
citement about becoming the
Tree. "I am kind of afraid, but

just like any big hitter, I am will
ing to step up to the plate and
wield my tool in as valiant a way
as possible," he said.
Merrill said his mission as the
new Tree is to maintain the feel
ing he had while trying out to be
the new mascot. "I was embody
ing fun," he said, "and being
Tree is a way to do that for a
whole year. I want to be every
one's playmate.
"This is some funky stuff," he
added.
Merrill said he will carry away
fond memories from his cam
paign, including conversations
with the llama farmer, who "did
a little bit of academic advising"
in addition to supplying Merrill
with live animals.
"He actually knew quite a bit
about John Locke. Me and the
llama farmer talking about John
Locke is definitely a memory I
will not forget," Merrill said.
