What is madness? Is it possible to face the difference it signifies in its own right as constituting
its own system, with its own rules and norms? On the other hand, what do you do with generous
controversial statements as that of Michel Foucault, who says: "Now, with me, madness can
speak in its own language." Is it really possible for madness to speak about itself in a language
which is not one of reason?
