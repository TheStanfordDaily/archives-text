Last Friday, I went running around Campus Drive with my friend, and we
took a shortcut, which made me feel incomplete, so after we'd split up to
go to our dorms I kept running by myself It was about 6 p.m. and getting
dark. I stopped running by Serra Street and headed up toward the Oval and
then walked through the Quad, which was mostly empty By this point, the
sun had set completely. No light hit the front of Memorial Church; there
were only these shadows sort of clinging to everything. It had been a hot
afternoon, but the temperature had dropped. The palm trees in the Quad
seemed very tall. I felt that weird blend of happiness and sadness that
sometimes fills you when you're in a beautiful place alone and you know
that not only will this moment not last but neither will the larger time period
that's currently unfolding for you. I kept walking. Near Meyer Library, some
one asked me for directions to the Law School When I got back to my
dorm I took a shower, and then we had special dinner, and everyone got
really drunk and smashed plates and wrote people's names with aspara
gus on the floor. Frankly, I don't know what to make of any of this. Do you?
