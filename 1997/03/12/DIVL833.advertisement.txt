Top 10 things overheard at a CIV study session
(or, a shameless imitation of good ol' Letterman top 10 lists)
10. You mean Shakespeare lived after Aristotle? That clears a few things up.
9. You thought those were Tic Tacs? No, dude, that's Vivarin. How many have you had?
8. Did anybody not get a B+ on the Marx paper?
7. The Domino's guy is on the phone. He can't find Yost. He says if we don't come get the pizza
ourselves, he's just going to throw the whole bag into Lake Lag.
6. Sappho was a chick? You mean ... man, that's gross.
5. You know and I know that Freud was Austrian, but as long as the TA says he's Chinese,
that's what I put on the exam.
4. Basically, I argued in my paper that Homer would like the designated hitter rule but
Confucius wouldn't.
3. Does anyone have anything to say about Augustine besides "he needs a life"?
2. Trust me, if you just take a couple of bong hits, Nietzche will make much more sense.
1. OK, everyone take a deep breath and repeat after me: "It's only CIV ... It's only CIV"
