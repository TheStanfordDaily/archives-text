Presents
Bruno Latour: On the
Historicity of Scientific Objects
March 17,1997
3:30 pm
Building 200 Room 2
Reception following in Building 110 Room 111-0
Organized by Joan H. Fujimura, Henry K. line Professor of
Biotechnology and Society
Hosted by the Department of Anthropology and
the Program in History and Philosophy of Science
The quick progress recently made by histories of science in their handling
of material practice raise anew an intriguing philosophical question, that
of extending historicity not only to the humans but also to the non
humans and thus offering to various forms of realism a new and more
solid ground. The talk will explore four models of historicity: political
history, technical history, legal history, and art history, to see what are
the advantages and disadvantages of each in handling scientific objets. It
will then propose a type of historicity adjusted to the specifications ol
scientific objects that must escape at some point the grasp of human
history and will show how the notion of partial existence allows tor a
much finei differentiation than the notion of demarcation.
