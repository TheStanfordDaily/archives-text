The Overseas Studies Pro
gram will open its eighth center
next winter quarter, giving stu
dents an opportunity to study in
Puebla, Mexico.
The program, which will
admit 25 students, will be locat
ed at the Universidad de las
Am6ricas-Puebla (UDLA) in
Cholula, 11/2 hours southeast of
Mexico City.

private homes and take courses
intended primarily for Stanford
students.

ter will definitely be more closely
connected with that university
than other centers will be," said
McNaughton. "We also wanted
to offer coursework that would
bring students from both groups
together in the same classroom."
Furthermore, once students
complete prerequisites at Stan
ford, they will be able to enroll in
one of two tracks: development
economics or cultural studies. In
addition to the coursework, stu
dents will also have the opportu
nity to pursue individual re
search projects with a faculty
member.
The reasons for and the bene
fits of such studies are plain to
see, according to McNaughton.
"In economics, students can
study the development of
NAFTA, what it takes to unite
