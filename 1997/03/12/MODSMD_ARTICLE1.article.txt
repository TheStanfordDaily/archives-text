# Overseas program opens in Mexico

### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
The Overseas Studies Pro
gram will open its eighth center
next winter quarter, giving stu
dents an opportunity to study in
Puebla, Mexico.
The program, which will
admit 25 students, will be locat
ed at the Universidad de las
Am6ricas-Puebla (UDLA) in
Cholula, 11/2 hours southeast of
Mexico City.
"It's very exciting to have
this," said Pamela McNaughton,
assistant director of the Over
seas Studies Program. "Stu
dents have been asking about
this possibility for quite some
time now."
The center in Mexico will dif
fer from other Stanford centers
across the world. Students will
live in university dormitories
and take part in courses taught
to both Stanford and UDLA stu
dents. All courses will be con
ducted entirely in Spanish and
taught by UDLA faculty.
In contrast, students at other
Overseas Studies centers live in
private homes and take courses
intended primarily for Stanford
students.
"Students at the Puebla cen
ter will definitely be more closely
connected with that university
than other centers will be," said
McNaughton. "We also wanted
to offer coursework that would
bring students from both groups
together in the same classroom."
Furthermore, once students
complete prerequisites at Stan
ford, they will be able to enroll in
one of two tracks: development
economics or cultural studies. In
addition to the coursework, stu
dents will also have the opportu
nity to pursue individual re
search projects with a faculty
member.
The reasons for and the bene
fits of such studies are plain to
see, according to McNaughton.
"In economics, students can
study the development of
NAFTA, what it takes to unite
different economies and social
political issues in developing eco
nomic communities," Mc-
Naughton said.
"In terms of race and ethnici
ty, there have been numerous
questions about issues of chang
ing cultural identity over time
and the intersection of cultures
over time," she added. "Especial
ly in the light of the development
of the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity major, can we
broaden the discussion in the
context of other countries?"
According to McNaughton,

UDLA was chosen not only be
cause it is one of the leading uni
versities in Mexico but also be
cause Overseas Studies staff
wanted to give students an oppor
tunity to study such issues in a
neighboring country, putting
them in a more local context.
In addition, the UDLA's sys
tem meshes in well with Stan
ford's. Despite the fact that
UDLA is on the semester system,
all courses involving Stanford
students will be a quarter long.
Applications for the new pro
gram will be due in spring quar
ter. A group advising session with
Overseas Studies Director Rus
sell Berman has been tentatively
set for April 17.
