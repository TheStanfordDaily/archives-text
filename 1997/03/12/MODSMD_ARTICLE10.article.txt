# Senate to examine 'soft money'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
startling turnaround, Senate
Republicans agreed yesterday to
a broader investigation of cam
paign financing that would
include a look at huge "soft
money" donations. The Senate
quickly approved the expansion
by a vote of 99 to 0.
The change came after
Republicans suddenly found
themselves short of votes — and
concerned that their original
scope would have prevented an
investigation of White House
coffees and sleepovers for sub
stanial donors.
It also might have precluded
investigating the $50,000 cam
paign donation that a California
businessman brought to the
White House and handed to Mar
garet Williams — chief of staff to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Until yesterday, GOP sena
tors stood together for an investi
gation that would have allowed
the Governmental Affairs Com
mittee to investigate only illegal
activities in the 1996 presidential

and congressional campaigns.
This would have left out soft
money because these donations
are not against the law.
When Republicans agreed to
include "improper" activities,
the resolution passed 99-0.
While that was the key vote, the
Senate still must approve a final
resolution to set the investiga
tion in motion.
The solid Republican front
began to crack earlier in the day,
when Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
said the Republican scope was
too narrow and "filled with
booby traps."
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said he was among the Republi
cans — as many as eight — who
argued during a private lunch
time caucus against the original
GOP plan.
"If you said, 'Maggie Williams,
you come over and testify,' they
say, 'No, that's not illegal,' "
McCain said. "It may be improp
er but it's not illegal."
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-
Maine, also spoke in favor of the

expanded scope.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said there were
arguments in the caucus that
"some of these coffees, some of
these sleepovers" at the White
House might have fallen outside
the scope of the investigation.
Democrats had been pushing
for inclusion of "soft money" —
unlimited, party-building dona
tions by corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals — because
Republicans collect more of it.
For the 1996 election cycle,
Republicans took in $141 million
in soft money while Democrats
raised $122 million.
One Rules Committee mem
ber, Republican Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, has said that in
order to get rid of soft money, it
would be necessary for the feder
al government to finance political
campaigns.
Rules Committee Chairman
John Warner, R-Va., insisted
nonetheless that his panel would
pursue soft money problems
"with diligence."
