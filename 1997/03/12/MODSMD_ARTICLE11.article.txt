Students must act to
ensure Tresidder board
hears their viewpoints

SINCE HIS ARRIVAL at Stan
ford last year, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais has been
making a concerted effort to bring
new and varied retail operations
into Tre c idder Union. Wais says the
University is getting close to choos
ing a vendor to fill that space,
though he cannot say right now
who the vendor is.
Before the University makes its
final decision, though, it is impera
tive that students be consulted.
And Wais has said he is very open
to student input.
In choosing the vendor, the Uni
versity is looking for an organiza
tion or company that will both com
pliment the existing businesses in
Tresidder and provide enough
rental revenue to bring the building
to financial self-sufficiency.
Ultimately, Wais will make his
decision after considering the rec
ommendations of the Tresidder
Advisory Board, a group of stu
dents, faculty and staff charged
with providing Wais with guidance
on the building's operations.
In theory, such an advisory
board, with its complement of stu
dents, seems ideal for allowing
Wais to ascertain what kind of a
businesses the campus community
would like to see in Tresidder. But
the reality is that four of the five
student members serve on the
committee by virtue of their posi
tions with the ASSU.
Do those students necessarily
know what most would like to see
in Tresidder? Maybe, but we can't
be sure. Those who ran the
ASSU's business projects may be
more interested in preventing
competition for their Stanford
Store than in providing the retail
outlets most desired by or useful
to the student body as a whole.

Furthermore, its questionable
that ASSU officials who spend a
good part of their day stuck in their
Tresidder offices know just what
businesses the typical Stanford stu
dent is looking for. Wais says he wel
comes e-mail from any student who
has suggestions for the space.
Take advantage of the offer. E
mail him: cm.mxw@Forsythe. Tell
him what stores you'd like to see â€”
it's only with your input that
Tresidder's administrators can
determine what students would
most like to see. Maybe it's a Noah's
Bagels or a Starbucks, as has been
mentioned. Maybe it's a dry cleaner.
Maybe it's even a shoe-shine stand.
A lot of effort has been put into
making sure that changes to Tresid
der serve the campus community.
The University consulted a special
ist who recently designed a new stu
dent union for UC-San Diego to
provide guidance on the Tresidder
space. The Stanford Management
Co. has become involved in running
the building, bringing its real-estate
expertise into play.
For the most part, those efforts
have been successful. With the addi
tion of Polio's and the soon-to-open
Jamba Juice, Tresidder definitely
has come a long way as far as meet
ing students' needs.
It's logical that Tresidder's
administrators would want to pro
vide the businesses students are
looking for. It can be argued that
in some instances what students
desire is not what's best from an
administrative standpoint. But in
this case it clearly is. The Univer
sity wants to make Tresidder a
profitable retail center, and the
way to do so is to find businesses
that appeal to students.
Administrators are dedicated to
making sure that the new vendor is
one that students will welcome and
Wais has expressed a willingness to
accept advice on the decision from
any and all students.
So give it to him. If you don't,
and if you don't like whatever busi
ness ends up in Tresidder, you have
only yourself to blame.
