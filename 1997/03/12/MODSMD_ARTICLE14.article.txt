I KEEP A notebook next to my bed
which alternately serves as a jour
nal and space for random ideas and
lists. Lately, I've started to keep a list of
800 numbers for products that I've seen
on TV and wanted to order. Three of
the numbers are for '80s compilation
CDs ("Big '80s," "Heavy '80s" and "Lite
'80s"), two are for exercise equipment
(Abßoller Plus and the Glider), one is
for Suzanne Sommers' psychological
counseling hotline (you never know), a
couple are for cooking utensils and one
is for a program that teaches you how to
memorize magazines and books in their
entirety.
I've never been one of those puritan
ical, Luddite-types who despises TV.
Talk shows, cartoons, infomercials, sit
coms, soap operas, cooking shows —
you name it, I'll watch it. Sometimes I
do feel a pang of guilt after I've wasted
three of four hours watching reruns of
"Family Ties" and "Who's The Boss,"
but overall I relish the opportunity to
sink into the torpor of my couch and
think about absolutely nothing.
Every once in a while, though, a
fleeting thought or two passes through
my VH-l-induced coma. What exactly is
it about TV that is so insipid, that
makes me care more about shortening
my ab workout than other, real prob
lems? Why not just read instead? And
why, with all the other issues I could
write about in my journal, do I instead
record secret wishes for kitchen uten

sils and phone counselors?
I think on the whole that even
though TV shows constitute our most
pervasive form of national culture, they
are a pathetic substitute for books. I
read because I want to dive into a fanta
sy world, to take on the lives and prob
lems of characters in radically different
situations than my own. I read to learn,
to fantasize, to be inspired and to live in
another world for just a little while. I
don't watch TV for any of these rea
sons. I watch TV to forget.
Watching TV is, significantly, not
about fantasy at all. I do not share the
problems of TV cops, Geraldo Rivera or
the Huxtables. I do not turn on the TV
to participate in someone else's world.
On the contrary, watching a sitcom is
like entering someone else's world and
finding that their lives aren't that
important after all. No problem on TV,
even the most lurid or terrible, ever
seems important enough to warrant
thinking about later or even important
enough to make me angry or inspired.
Usually I can't even muster enough
inspiration to get up off the couch.
In TV world, the only problems that
are bad enough to do something about
are acne, ring-around-the-collar and my
pitiable lack of '80s CDs. That is, no one
else's problem is ever more important
than my own. I can hardly even come up
with an example of a TV character's
problem — Bailey's alcoholism on
"Party of Five" springs to mind,

although I never wrote about him in my
journal. What did I write about instead?
My own problems. My need for exercise
equipment, relaxation tapes, real estate
investment tips and a juicer.
I don't want to be too simplistic or
conspiracy-minded, but I can't help
thinking that maybe a general sort of
apathy is exactly what the TV and
advertising people want from us. They
want a sort of general mind-numbness
so they can convince us, for a few
hours at least, that relaxation is a lot
more important than thinking hard
about things, that fingernail polish
and psychic lines are just as important
as what's on the news. Like fantasy
cruises and Muzak, TV wants us to for
get about thinking and think about
buying.
Meanwhile, all of this thinking
about TV makes me want to throw
mine out the window. But I know I
won't. I'll continue to watch, and I'll
continue to obsess about how terrible it
is. I guess that's the solution in all this:
be critical, be smart and be aware. Not
even Suzanne Sommers can cure me of
that.

infomercials over spring break.
