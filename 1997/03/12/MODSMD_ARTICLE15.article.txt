Disability Action Day was about education, not pity

AS A WOMAN, and especially as a
woman of color, I know the pre
cariousness that can develop
when people who are not members of a
given minority group involve them
selves in work for the advancement of
that minority group. Therefore, I can
understand the reservations Kimberly
Thompson expressed in her March 7
letter about the involvement of non
disabled students in disabled access
issues at Stanford. I can even under
stand that she would have read The
Daily's March 5 article on Disability
Action Day with skepticism.
I cannot, however, understand her
decision to publicly denigrate Disability
Action Day without seeking out any
information from or about the student

groups involved or even attending the
event. Furthermore, her personal
attack on Nathan Watson seems entire
ly uncalled for.
I agree that "persons without dis
abilities will never understand what it
feels like to have a disability." But let's
not stop there. Men will never under
stand what it feels like to be women in
our society. Does this mean that men
should not be involved in women's
equality struggles? Should whites have
refrained from joining the civil rights
movement? Non-disabled persons may
be able to make valuable contributions
to the achievement of access despite
their inability to experience the issues
firsthand.
Disability Action Day was not

intended to evoke pity for disabled per
sons. The primary goals for the event
were to educate the Stanford communi
ty about unnecessary physical, educa
tional and social barriers imposed on
its disabled members. The students
sponsoring the event, and Nathan Wat
son in particular, worked closely with
Disabled Students at Stanford to
ensure that the tenor of the event
remained respectful and representative
of its opinions and values.
Had Thompson attended the event,
she would know that we did, in fact,
"have real people with real disabilities
and who use wheelchairs show obsta
cles and the need for accessibility." In a
further attempt to reduce these obsta
cles, we circulated a petition written by

Disable Students at Stanford to be
given to the University's provost and
trustees as well as to her office, the
Office of Multicultural Development.
We hope the petition will encourage
that office to begin enforcing the basic
state and federal access laws it has
thus far disregarded.
I am disappointed that Thompson
reacted to our event with reflexive crit
icism rather than with inquiry. If she
had investigated further, she might
have found the attitudes expressed on
Disability Action Day compatible with
many of her own.
