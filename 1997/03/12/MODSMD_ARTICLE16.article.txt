# Class presidents will use new committee to address class unity
## 
### 
The Daily's March 7 editorial about
the new committee on class identity said
that class identity could and should be
improved at this University in two ways:
by increasing the availability of all-frosh
housing and by increasing social interac
tion among students. We fully agree
with this assessment. We believe that
class identity will not only benefit the
University, but it will benefit the stu
dents. Stanford's greatest resource is its
people and getting a chance to interact
with others from your class only
improves the student experience.
In terms of the student-housing
issue, we implore students to share their
views with the commission currently

looking into the matter, chaired by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ram6n Saldivar. We believe that all
frosh housing for all those who request
it would greatly increase class identity.
This is a great opportunity to improve
the undergraduate experience and the
student voice needs to be heard.
As for increasing "fun social interac
tion" on a class level and developing
traditions â€” that is exactly what this
committee is attempting to do. We
believe that such efforts, especially if
student-initiated, could greatly increase
the level of engagement of students
with their class and enhance their over
all experience.
In that vein, this letter is written to
encourage suggestions from students
for class-based events to increase class
unity. Student input will facilitate the
committee's endeavors. The commit
tee, largely through the class presi
dents, is looking to improve current

events and implement new ideas. We
strongly urge students to contact us
with ideas they may have.
