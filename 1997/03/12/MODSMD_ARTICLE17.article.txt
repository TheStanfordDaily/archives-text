# All-frosh dorms may isolate freshman from intellectual growth
## 
### 
Allow me to interject a comment in
reference to Friday's editorial, "Find
ing class unity." The University's
interest in creating alumni loyalty may
best be served by all-freshman dormi
tories, but this is only one among

many aspects of all-frosh dorms.
Some members of the faculty are not
sure such dormitories are the best are
nas for intellectual and even personal
growth. Four-class dorms provide enter
ing freshmen with in-house examples —
plural — of older students who have
found their way and are finding their
way. Upperclassmen can also informally
mentor the freshmen simply through
daily interaction and by demonstrating
informed enthusiasm about their chosen
majors. All-frosh dorms, while allowing
18-year-olds a chance to form a cohesive
group, suspend this kind of intellectual
growth — not unlike army barracks in
countries where young males of the same
age must serve their country for a year.
One should weigh carefully the costs
and benefits of each kind of housing
arrangement and not let the tail of
"team spirit" wag the dog of education.
