# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## A
						guide for the ‘End Quarter Period' procrastinator 
### 
PROCRASTINATION. SOME peo
ple believe it is simply the act of
wasting time. This, gentle readers,
is not entirely true. For many people,
procrastination differs from the above
definition by just one letter.
It is the art of wasting time.
Anyone can flip on the television and
become engrossed by a 12-hour Nick
elodeon marathon of "Degrassi Junior
High" or back-to-back episodes of "Doo
gie Howser, M.D." right before he slept
with Wanda and transformed from boy
doctor to manly-man doctor. That, how
ever, is hibernating — not engaging in
the art of time-suckage. Procrastination
requires style, poise, talent and nuance.
Not everyone has the ability to put
things off until the last possible moment.
They feel guilty if that two-page paper
isn't done three weeks ahead of time, and
they won't even watch "Friends" so they
can finish the first draft early enough. I
suppose this takes style, poise, talent and
nuance too, but to me it seems rather
pointless. I mean, isn't there an old Chi
nese saying that says "Why do today
what can be done three hours before it's

due?" Or something like that.
This Dead Week (er, End Quarter
Period) should be the perfect time to
hone your procrastination skills. With
three finals, two term papers, a problem
set and a summer job to think about,
your brain is looking for a short vaca
tion, and of course it wouldn't mind
dragging a few unwilling nearby brains
along for the ride. Here are a few sure
fire ways to escape the unfortunate work
which has piled up on your desk and
spilled onto your floor:
Head to the computer cluster. The
cluster is the perfect environment for
procrastination. This is due to two
important factors. First, everyone there
is (in theory) working hard on papers,
programs, etc., and is just ripe for the
plucking. Getting them into a deep philo
sophical discussion about reincarnation
should be about as easy as taking candy
from a diabetic.
The second reason the cluster is such
an easy target: e-mail. Clean your inbox,
write to your high school buddies, ytalk to
Florence, change your .sig — the possibil
ities are endless. Gotta love technology.

Go "out" to study. If you're not con
vinced that you're ready to procrasti
nate, just change location. Whether
you're headed to a cafe off campus or
just the Coffee House, anywhere you go
to "study" will ultimately result in
unfettered hedonism of some sort.
Schoolwork cannot compete with a
mocha and conversation, no matter how
interesting the subject matter or how
weak and uninteresting the coffee and
conversation are. There is a direct rela
tionship between the amount of unfin
ished work and how enthralling you Find
that moron down the hall at 3 a.m.
Write a column for The Daily. I've
heard through the grapevine that a great
way to put off doing schoolwork for sever
al hours at a time is to write a few hun
dred words for The Daily's page 5 every
week. Of course, sometimes you may find
yourself procrastinating from writing the
column (i.e., procrastinating from pro
crastinating), which brings you to a whole
new level in the art of time mismanage
ment. This is to be performed by trained
professionals only; do not try this at home.
Pick up a time schedule. Isn't Dead

Week the perfect time to chart out your
class schedule for next quarter? And while
you're at it, you might as well map out the
rest of your college career. And then
maybe pick a double major. And then fig
ure out which is the geekiest class in the
whole pamphlet. Then find some DRs that
look extremely painful. Then search for
cool classes like "anesthesiology" or other
weird subjects that make you sound like
you have a lisp when you pronounce them.
Or you could surf the Web to find the
time schedule online. Then find informa
tion on your major. Then on your
favorite rock band. Then find color pic
tures of every single member of the orig
inal Broadway cast of "Rent" along with
biographies, personal anecdotes and can
did photographs. Then put dirty book
marks on the cluster's version of
Netscape.
Clean. You know you can't study in a
dirty room, right? So, what better time
to do a little cleaning? Vacuum the car
pet. Throw your clothes in the closet.
Wipe down your desk with Lemon
Pledge. Change your sheets. Empty the
bugs out of your halogen. Flip over your

mattress. Get those chocolate stains off
of the ceiling. Clean between the keys on
your computer keyboard with Q-Tips.
Clean your ears. Floss.
Remember, the most important
aspect of the art of procrastination is to
avoid doing anything productive. If
instead you do something worthwhile,
you are not procrastinating — rather,
you are managing your time. This is to
be avoided at all costs.
And if you're going to waste some
time, you might as well suck your friends
in with you! Why go down that dark,
dirty path all alone? Like fine wine, the
art of procrastination should be shared
with friends. Spread the wealth.
And remember, you can always finish
that assignment tomorrow.
