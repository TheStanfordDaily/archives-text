# PA Council passes 'sit-lie' ordinance
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council
voted overwhelmingly to pass the
controversial "sit-lie" ordinance,
despite listening to a litany of pub
lic opposition on Monday night.
Anyone caught sitting or lying
on University Avenue between
High and Cowper Streets during
the hours of 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. is
liable to be cited when the law goes
into effect in late April. The council
voted by 7-2 in favor of the new la w.
While councilors insisted the
ordinance addresses concerns
about public safety in downtown
Palo Alto, more than 30 communi
ty members spoke out during pub
lic testimony to condemn the ordi
nance as a veiled attempt to sweep
the homeless off the streets of Palo
Alto.
Only a handful of people spoke
in favor of the ordinance during
the public hearings, including
members of the Palo Alto Cham
ber of Commerce, which repre
sents 200 downtown businesses.
Homeless advocates and
lawyers are set to challenge the
new law, which is modeled around
similar laws in Seattle and Berke
ley. These laws have both faced
"facial" law suits on constitutional
grounds, and the Seattle law has
recently been upheld by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Representing the Mental
Health Advocacy Project in San
Jose, attorney Carl McConnell
said he is aware of several other
lawyers who have been monitoring
the progress of the ordinance, and
some are likely to take action now
that the law has been approved. He
predicted that a law suit could be
lengthy and costly for the City of

Palo Alto.
Brandishing a sign "Stand Up
to the Sit-Lie Lie," Gary Andrew
Crittenden of Stanford Homeless
ness Action Coalition said he
planned to file a lawsuit against
the city.
During the council meeting,
City Attorney Ariel Calonne de
nied that the law violated constitu
tional rights. "This is dealing with
a portion of University Avenue,"
he said. "Anybody who wants to
express themselves by sitting has
all the benches on University Av
enue, as well as the plant boxes and
the side streets."
The small concrete plaza out
side Burger King, known as Lytton
Plaza, will be the only stretch of
University Avenue sidewalk af
fected by the ordinance where
pedestrians can sit or lie without
fear of citation in the future.
Under the law, even a child sit
ting on the sidewalk to eat ice
cream would be subject to the ban,
according to City Attorney Ariel
Calonne. However, Police Chief
Chris Durkin said that in practice
a child would probably not be
moved on, because he or she would
only be sitting down for a matter of
minutes.
Sitting or lying during medical
emergencies, in wheelchairs or in
strollers are all exempted from the
ban.
Homeless advocates were
adamant that the ordinance tar
geted a certain section of the com
munity's low-income community.
One homeless man, Michael
Mahan, turned the issue around
and asked councilors, "How would
you like it if we told you that you
couldn't drive your BMWs down
University Avenue at certain hours
of the day?"
SHAC member Margaret Ash
said that although she didn't think
the ordinance would affect many
people, "it will seriously affect
some, like Carole Gallagher, who
supplements her income by pan
handling."
Gallagher told the city council
Monday that she pays $725 per
month in rent for a room in the
Palo Alto Hotel on High Street and
receives benefits totaling $708.
"I have no money, and that's
why I'm sitting out there," she
said.
Councilor Gary Fazzino, who
initiated the ordinance, insisted it
addresses a legitimate safety con

cern. Ten percent of the city's cur
rent litigation defense case load
arises directly out of sidewalk haz
ards, according to the city attor
ney's report.
"On balance, I believe it is the
right action to ensure public safety
in our downtown area," said Fazzi
no. "It is unfortunate that some
have turned this into a homeless
issue. I agree that this should not
be used as a hammer for a certain
class of people."
Opposing the ordinance, Coun
cilor Ron Andersen said that he
was disappointed at the council's
support for the measure.
"We have had no incident of
anyone tripping over a human
being on University Avenue," he
said. "Panhandling is a freedom of
speech issue. We can't outlaw it, so
we are trying to find other ways. It
is not constitutional, and we're
basing this on flimsy evidence."
