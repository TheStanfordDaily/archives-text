Racist e-mails reported
An individual reportedly using an e-mail account that had been left
open on a computer in Meyer Library wrote racist messages to a num
ber of individuals on the evening of March 3. Police suspect the 15-
year-old younger brother of a Stanford football player.
The same individual repeated the action the next night from an
other open e-mail account. The messages were reportedly sent most
ly to friends of the individual's brother who are minorities.
"These crass, derogatory and racist letters assailed, [among other
groups], whites, blacks and rednecks," said Niemeyer.
"This was some prank on the part of a 15-year-old," said Niemey
er, "not some (Klu Klux Klan] or Skinhead group."
The issue has been turned over to Steve Hansen, computer securi
ties specialist, an act that is "standard procedure" according to Stan
ford "olice.

Gay rights banner vandalized

found to have been sprayed there.

that evening — we're going to try to find out information about what
happened that night."
