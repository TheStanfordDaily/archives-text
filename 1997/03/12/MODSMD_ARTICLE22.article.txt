According to the Department of
Public Safety crime statistics for
1996, bicycle thefts fell nearly 30
percent from 545 in 1995 to 384 in
1996.
Reported bicycle thefts have
been steadily decreasing since
1993. In that year, 829 bicycles
were stolen.
"A lot of it is due to increased ef
forts by the Stanford Department
of Public Safety, such as installing
more and better bike racks," said
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy.
"We are certainly happy, but we
are not going to sit on our laurels."
In other areas, including sexual
offenses, burglaries and aggravat
ed assault, there were no major in
creases in the number of crimes
committed.

Recently, the Stanford Police
Department decided to change its
reporting methods by reporting
rape and forcible sex offenses sepa
rately. Forcible sex offenses in
clude sodomy, sexual assault with
a weapon, and forcible fondling.
"The chief wants to put it out
that way, even though the law says
we only have to put it under
'forcible,' " said Mary Solakian of
the Stanford Police Department.
Only one murder occurred on
campus in 1996, a figure actually
higher than the previou vear's
murder count of zero.
"The murder was a pa» - of a
double-homicide that did not take
place on the campus," said Bandy.
The body was found near Peter
Coutts Road.
Robberies rose from zero in
stances in 1995 to two last year
and aggravated assaults rose from

four to six.
Reported thefts of motor vehi
cles, however, rose from 14 in 1995
to 18 last year. The rise halted a
three-year decline in motor vehicle
thefts that began in 1993.
Forcible sex offenses rose from
three to seven. Nonforcible sex of
fenses, which refers to, among
other things, incest and statutory
rape, remained unchanged at one.
Instances of hate crimes rose from
zero in 1995 to two in 1996.
Statistics on arrests related to
drug and liquor violations, as well
as weapons possession, will be re
leased in the near future, Solakian
said.
In compliance with the 1990
Crime Awareness and Campus Se
curity Act, the Stanford Police De
partment is obligated to tabulate
and report crime statistics for the
Stanford community.
