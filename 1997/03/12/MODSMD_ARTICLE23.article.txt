### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
In honor of its 100 th anniver
sary, the Bookstore presented
Green Library with a check for
$100,000 and a pledge to donate
10,000 books in the coming years.
"We wanted to do something to
celebrate our centennial and to
give something back to the com
munity," said Trish Keady, mar
keting manager of the Bookstore.
The gift, presented in a ceremo
ny by Bookstore President and
CEO Peggy Mendelson to Univer
sity Librarian Mike Keller at
Green Library on Feb. 27, is one of
the largest in recent years. March
18 marks the 100 th anniversary
of the Bookstore's founding.
The money will be used to build
a "Gentlepersons' Reading
Room" in the west wing of Green
Library, an area currently under
going restoration because of se
vere damage suffered during the
Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989.
The location in the fifth-floor
Bender Room was chosen because
of its size, beauty and the view it
affords of the Main Quad and the
campus at large, said Keady.

"I think it's a marvelous gift
that will go to renovate most of
Green Library West," said Keller.
"I'm very happy about it."
The room will not just be a
reading room, however; it will also
house a special book collection.
In addition to the initial gift,
Green Library will also receive a
donation of 5,000 books of their
choice. In a few years the Book
store will donate another 5,000
books chosen by Green. The first
set will consist of the "great
works" of civilization. The second
set will consist of recent and fu
ture bestsellers, both fiction and
nonfiction.
The purpose of the reading
room is to create a comfortable en
vironment for recreational read
ers, Keller said.
"We wanted to make this a
room for book lovers and recre
ational reading," he said. "There
will be large tables, soft seats and
a nice view of the campus. We're
also hoping to cater to everyone's
tastes with such a wide selection
of books."
The room is scheduled to open
when the West Wing reopens in
1999.
