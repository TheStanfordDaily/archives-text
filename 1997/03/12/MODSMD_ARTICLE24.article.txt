# ISC to hold Sorority Rush on campus
## 
### Kelly Vaughan Contributing writer 
Attempting to increase the
number of women who partici
pate in Sorority Rush and de
crease the number who drop out
before it ends, the Intersorority
Council will hold Rush on cam
pus this year.
The last two years, the ISC
held Rush at Bing Elementary
School and Palo Alto High School.
This year, however, Rush coordi
nators reserved rooms in the
School of Education, Tresidder
Union and Bechtel International
Center. The final night's celebra
tion will be held, as in past years,
at the Palo Alto Holiday Inn.
The ISC hopes to make this
year's Rush "approachable and
affordable, if possible," said
Rachel Rucker, chair of Rush.
Due to its return to campus,
the cost of this year's Rush will
be $18, a $3 decrease from last
year's. The money goes to cover
the costs of publicity, Rush
books, food and reserving and
cleaning rooms. Rucker said no
profit was being made.
Rush will last four days, from
April 4 to April 7. On the first
evening, women will visit each of
six "parties," one for each of the
national sororities on campus.
They will talk to members of the
sororities, allowing the Rushees
and the sorority members to
meet each other.
ISC President Lisa Rubin said
that after the participants leave,
"the members of the sorority will
get together and decide which
women they want to invite back
and which they want to release."
All but two members of each
sorority participate in the par
ties, Rucker said. Two women
from each chapter are designated
"Rho Chis" or Rush counselors.
Rho Chis — who do not reveal
their own particular sorority —
are responsible for taking
prospective sorority members
from party to party and respond

ing to any questions or concerns
the women may have. A Rho Chi
is the "one person during Rush
the Rushees can trust whole
heartedly," Rucker said.
The number of parties women
can attend is reduced from six
the first day to two the last day,
regardless of the number of invi
tations received. Rubin described
this as "a process of mutual selec
tion."
In the past, the first two
nights were open houses, and no
cuts were made until after the
second night, Rubin said. This
year, the narrowing down
process will begin after the first
night, she said.
Another change to this year's
Rush is an increased emphasis on

"the importance of belonging to
any Greek organization, rather
than a specific organization,"
Rucker said. Rubin and Rucker
said they hope such changes will
increase the number of women
who stay in Rush.
Rucker said she is tiying to in
crease numbers of women who
participate in Rush by making
the ISC more visible, through
panels in freshman dorms and
early sign-ups in White Plaza.
Rush sign-ups will continue until
Friday. So far, 162 women have
signed up. Rucker said she ex
pects about 260 women to partic
ipate.
The ISC decided to change
their Rush process after Betty
Woods, the area adviser for the

National Pan-Hellenic Confer
ence, visited last quarter. Rucker
said Woods suggested ways to
make Stanford's sorority Rush
more successful. "Her sugges
tions centered around promoting
Greek life and understanding the
process from the Rushee's per
spective," Rucker said. Woods
will return this spring to help
with Rush, Rucker added.
If changes are deemed suc
cessful, Rucker said, the ISC will
reserve rooms for next year's
Rush as early as next quarter.
The ISC is "trying to make
[Rush] less of an intimidating
process," Rucker said, "We're
trying to be more in tune with
what the Rushees are going
through."
