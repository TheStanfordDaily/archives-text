# Greek Affairs report to be completed spring quarter
##

While the Greek Affairs Task Force report like
ly will be completed next quarter, it probably will
not be released in time for Sorority Rush, a Uni
versity official said.
According to Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, the review of the report
"will probably take us through the Rush time."
Sorority Rush runs from April 4 to April 7.
Because of this, women participating in Rush
will not be aware of the committee's recommenda
tion on sorority housing.
"The Intersorority Council has requested Stu
dent Affairs to prepare a statement for women
going through Rush providing a summary of the
situation," said ISC President Lisa Rubin.
Rubin emphasized that the task force report
will put forth recommendations and not policy
changes.
"We're united in our desire for access to housing
and as far as I'm concerned, that's the most im
portant thing," Rubin said.
The task force was formed in February 1996 by
Edmonds in order to review the Greek system, par
ticularly Greek housing and judicial review.
The task force has set numerous deadlines for
completion of its recommendations. When it
began, the task force thought it would complete its
work by the end of fall quarter, Edmonds said.

"Once committees get started, there's a lot of
things they don't look at going in," she said.
"Those deadlines have to be extended in order to
have an extensive, comprehensive report, and I
think that's what we are trying to have."
Committee Chair and Biology Prof. Robert Si
moni said the task force will meet today to fine
tune a draft of the report which will then be sent to
Edmonds' desk.
"My guess is the earliest we'll get it to Mary is
next week," said Simoni, who stressed that the
soonest Edmonds could release it would be early
next quarter.
Edmonds said that she would need time to thor
oughly examine the recommendations after the
task force has completed its report. She empha
sized that she would not release a report of any
kind during dead week, finals week or spring vaca
tion.
Regardless of whether sorority housing is ap
proved in the report's recommendations, it is un
likely that any housing changes could be made in
time for the 1997-98 academic year.
"It has never been the desire of women in the
sorority system to have housing implemented by
next fall," Rubin said.
At this point, she said, a "haphazard, hasty"
change would be detrimental to Greek life.
"I think we would rather see a decision happen
more deliberately, more slowly to benefit all
women," Rubin said.
