## Stanford scientists test new forms of laser surgery Laser treatments significantly reduce the risk of corneal scarring 
### Wai Fung Kwok Contributing writer 
Ophthalmologists at the Stan
ford Medical Center are pioneering
two new forms of laser surgery
that can correct astigmatism and
farsightedness, two vision prob
lems current standard procedures
cannot fix.
Stanford is one of the few places
in the United States that has been
authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration to conduct clinical
research of these new treatments,
called toric Photo-Refractive Kera
tectomy (toric PRK) and hyperopic
Photo-Refractive Keratectomy,
(hyperopic PRK).
"We are the only center in
Northern California and one of
seven centers nationwide that's
doing studies on these two new
procedures," said Asst. Ophthal
mology Prof. Edward Manche.
According to Manche, toric PRK
is used to treat moderate near
sightedness compounded with
astigmatism, a condition often
found in myopic people in which
the cornea is more elliptically
shaped than normal.
Hyperopic PRK is used to cor
rect low to moderate levels of far
sightedness.
Manche and other researchers
at Stanford have just concluded a
study of 75 patients who under
went toric PRK. The data will be
submitted to the FDA for approval.
At the same time, Stanford
doctors are pioneering another
cutting edge technique called
Laser-Assisted in-Situ ker
atomileusis, or This pro
cedure can be used to correct

moderate to high levels of near
sightedness.
The most commonly used laser
surgery procedure is PRK, which
corrects moderate levels of near
sightedness.
Laser surgery combines state
of-the-art computer technology

with advanced laser precision. The
laser used in these procedures
has, according to Manche "an
accuracy of up to 0.25 microns per
pulse, which can cut a strand of
hair."
The laser changes the shape of
the cornea by breaking molecular

bonds between corneal cells,
which has the effect of removing
corneal tissues from the eye. The
reshaped cornea is then able to
better focus light.
The laser sculpts the cornea in
less than one minute and the
entire surgery usually takes less

than 30 minutes.
The advantages of laser surgery
include having permanently cor
rected vision — which means no
more glasses and contact lenses —
according to Manche, who per
forms about 25 PRK and LASIK
procedures each week.

"For people who are into athlet
ics, such as swimming and hiking,
laser surgery might be an advan
tage over glasses and contacts,"
Manche said.
"There are also certain jobs
where it might be advantageous
not to wear glasses or contacts,
such as being a fireman, policeman
or a person in the military."
Despite all the benefits laser
surgery offers, there are also some
risks involved.
Transient complications include
pain that lasts from one to two
days, corneal swelling, double
vision and light sensitivity that
may last up to several weeks.
"The risks for PRK include
corneal scarring which occurs in 2
percent of the cases, minor glare or
halo around light and a decrease in
quality of vision, which occurs in 1
percent of all cases. Some of these
complications might be perma
nent. LASIK does not present any
risk of corneal scarring, which is an
advantage over PRK," said
Manche.
A candidate for laser surgery
should be at least 18 years old
and have healthy eyes free from
any retinal problems or corneal
scars.
The reason for the age require
ment is because vision tends to sta
bilize during the late teens or early
adulthood.
"Laser surgery is a relatively
new procedure," Manche said.
"The technology gets better
every year, and the lasers also
get more advanced. Future
research in this area will proba
bly involve the improvement of
current techniques."
