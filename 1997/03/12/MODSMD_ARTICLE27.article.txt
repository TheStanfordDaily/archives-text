# 'Protein pump' keeps AIDS drug out
## 
### 
Sometimes the body just doesn't realize what's
good for it.
Results of a new study led by Clinical Pharmacolo
gy Prof. Terrence Blaschke and postdoctoral fellow
Carla Washington have demonstrated that a certain
enzyme in the cells lining the gut prevents the body's
absorption of saquinavir, one of the newest and most
potent anti-HIV drugs.

This enzyme, called P-glycoprotein, is one of the body's first lines
of defense against invading microbes like viruses and toxins. P-gly
coprotein acts as a "protein pump" and actively ejects foreign
molecules out of the body's cells. Unfortunately, these foreign
molecules are sometimes beneficial to the body, as in the case of
saquinavir.
Because oral medicines are absorbed into the bloodstream
through the lining of the digestive system, P-glycoprotein's pumping
action decreases the ability of saquinavir to reach HIV-infected cells
in the body.
In a series of experiments, Blaschke and Washington discovered
strong indications that P-glycoprotein recognizes saquinavir as a for
eign molecule and pumps it out of the cells in the gut. The
researchers found that cells with P-glycoprotein could survive high
er doses of saquinavir, which is toxic at extremely high levels, com
pared with cells without P-glycoprotein. This, said Blaschke, was
presumably because cells with P-glycoprotein could pump the drug
out, keeping saquinavir levels low within the cell.
In order to increase the effectiveness of saquinavir, the
researchers proposed that a method be developed to block the action
of P-glycoprotein. This could increase the amount of drug actually
passing through the digestive system into the bloodstream and into
the HIV-infected cells where it does its work.
Several drugs designed to block P-glycoprotein to enhance cancer
chemotherapy are already in clinical trials, though none have been
developed to enhance anti-HIV drugs.

Stent grafts patch ruptured aorta
A seven-hour emergency procedure that usually
involves opening the side of the chest, collapsing a
lung, temporarily placing the patient on a bypass
machine and fiddling around with the heart can
now be replaced with a one-hour, non-invasive type
of surgery, due in part to the work of Charles
Semba, assistant professor of cardiovascular inter-

ventional radiology.
At the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular and
Interventional Radiology held Monday, Semba reported on his expe
rience with a new procedure designed to help patients with ruptures
of the thoracic aorta, one of the body's most important blood vessels.
Traditional surgery requires that the doctor cut open the chest of
the patient in order to replace the ruptured aorta with a fabric tube
or a graft. The new interventional radiology technique only requires
that a quarter-inch incision be made in the groin. Then, a catheter is
inserted into an artery and pushed through to the aorta. A small
metallic tube at the end of the catheter can then be pushed into the
site of the rupture, where it stems the bleeding. "It's actually a pret
ty simple idea," Semba said.
Because of the invasiveness of the seven-hour traditional
surgery used to stop aortic ruptures, at least one-third to one-half
of the patients undergoing the procedure die. The new procedure
has a much higher survival rate. Semba treated 13 patients with
the new technique, and all 13 survived, although two later died of
unrelated causes.
Semba said in a statement that the new procedure "may well turn
out to be the standard of care in the future." Although this procedure
has been widely used to treat blood vessel ruptures in other parts of
the body, particularly the abdomen, it has never been used before to
treat the aortic ruptures.
