# Sleep more important than you realize
## 
### Akash Garg 
Amid the frantic frenzy of
classes, activities, social events
and finals, students rarely get a
good night's sleep. However, get
ting adequate rest may be more
important than most realize.
"Without sleep, you cannot
think or perform very well," said

Rafael Pelayo, an instructor in
psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences at the Stanford Sleep

Disorders Center. "Not hav
ing enough sleep is as dan
gerous or even more dan
gerous than being intoxi-

cated."
A good analogy to

sleeping is eating. If you
eat regularly, you won't
feel the urge to eat more
than you usually do at
any given meal.

Similarly, if you
sleep regularly, you
won't feel the need to
take naps. According
to Pelayo, good sleep
ers do not sleep in.

Many people try to
eat at least three bal
anced meals every
day. Sleep should be
no different.

Regular patterns
of sleeping are just as
important to an indi
vidual's health as eat
ing regular meals.
Sleeping regularly may
also help prevent the
development of insom
nia and other sleeping

problems later in life.

Although everybody
sleeps, the exact reason for
why is still unknown.

"We don't know why we
sleep," said Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement. "This mystery
has motivated sleep research. We
have not yet learned precisely
what is happening at a molecular

level. We do know that we must
sleep in order to experience nor
mal wakefulness."
There are also aspects of sleep
many people are not aware of,
such as a built-in defense mecha
nism that wakes people up peri
odically during the night.

"Sleeping is a sort of paradox,"
Pelayo said. "It is vital to exis
tence, yet it leaves you vulnerable
to attack. The brain has developed
safeguards. Every 90 minutes you
wake up and look around for a few
seconds and then fall back asleep."
Everybody has dreams, yet verv

little is known about them. On
average, people will have four to
six dreams a night, but you will
only remember a dream if you
wake up in the middle of one.
During the dreaming phase,
the body temperature cools to
almost room temperature. This
can offer an explanation as to why
people sometimes feel the need to

snuggle during the night.
Males also experience full

erections during REM sleep,
although the reason for

that is not known.
According to Dement,
these are not sexually
driven because infant
males exhibit the same
kind of behavior.

Many people also
snore when they
sleep.
Although snor
ing may seem natu
ral because it is so
common, it's actual
ly very unhealthy
and potentially life
threatening.
"The vast major-

ity of students have
impaired breathing
while they sleep,"
Dement said. "Snor
ing is a sleep disor
der."
Although you
might not have time
to sleep eight hours
every night, after
noon naps can be ben
eficial if you are feel
ing tired or sleep
deprived.
Naps are a bad

idea, however, if you

have insomnia or if you
ever have a hard time falling

asleep.
"Sleep is as important as exer
cise and nutrition," Pelayo said.
"It is crucial, and people have to
give it more importance."
