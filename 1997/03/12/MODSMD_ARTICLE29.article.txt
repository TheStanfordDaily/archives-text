vy! Why does your voice change
when you inhale helium?
A: People speak and sing and
laugh and gargle by forcing air
through two folds of mucus mem
brane called the vocal cords, or
glottis, that stretch across the lar
ynx.
The vocal cords are controlled
by a set of muscles which can cause
the opening between the vocal
cords to expand or contract. As air
passes through them, both the
vocal cords and air vibrate.
Depending on the size of the open
ing between the two, the pitch of
the sound that is created changes.
The sound which comes from
the vocal cords then passes up
through the larynx and is further

altered by the tongue and teeth and
other body parts that get in the
way. The end result is the ability
for humans to produce a complex
set of sounds ranging anywhere
from beautiful singing to prehis
toric grunts a la Tim Allen.
The whole path through which
the vibrations travel, from the
vocal cords through the larynx and
up through the mouth and out the
lips, acts like a long tube. Specifi
cally, it acts just as a wind instru
ment does, where vibrations are set
up at one end and the sounds are
propagated through a tube to pro
duce sound.
If you've ever played a wind
instrument, you probably know
that the length of the tube through
which the vibrations travel affects
the pitch of the sound that comes
out. In a trombone, the sliding arm
shortens and extends the length of

the tube and causes the pitch of the
resulting sound to change.
In physics, you've probably
learned about standing waves.
When sound is produced in a cham
ber like the vocal tract or a trom
bone, where one end is closed and
the other is open, certain frequen
cies of the sound are favored over
others. This is because only certain
wavelengths of sound "fit" inside
the tube.
The sounds which correspond to
these wavelengths are called the
resonant frequencies. When you
speak, all different frequencies are
present in your voice, but those
closest to the resonant frequencies
are amplified over others.
Now, in humans, it's a lot hard
er to change the length of the air
channel than it is in a trombone.
This is one of the reasons people
have such characteristic voices.

However, it is possible to change
the relation between the preferred
wavelengths and the resonant fre
quencies.
In helium, because it is less
dense than air, the speed of
sound is faster. This means that
the resonant frequencies must be
higher because the resonant
wavelengths can't change with
out serious injury to the body.
This is what makes your voice
sound higher pitched.
Now if you breathe in a denser
gas, like xenon hexafluoride, the
opposite affect is achieved — your
voice sounds a lot lower. Of course,
this is all very dangerous because
you are depriving your lungs of
oxygen when you do this.
But then again, think how cool
you'll be when you can do impres
sions of both James Earl Jones and
Kerri Strug at the same party!
