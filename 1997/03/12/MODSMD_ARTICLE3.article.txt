# Students to move Asian-American mural
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's Asian-American com
munity will finish the mural hanging in the
Asian American Activities Center but move it
elsewhere on campus because of concerns that it
excludes some Asian groups.
"We made the decision that the mural should
be completed and the work of the artist should
not remain undone, but we also decided that it

should not remain in the [center] out of concern
that the mural might not welcome all members
of the community," said Gavin Funabiki, a stu
dent intern at the center.
Center Director Rick Yuen said this was one of
about five options presented to the Asian com
munity in a survey distributed three weeks ago.
Other options included whitewashing the mural,
leaving it incomplete, redesigning the mural or
adding mini murals above the larger mural.
The decision to finish the mural — which de

picts Asian Americans doing a number of activi
ties — and move it"was actually somewhat sur
prising," Yuen said.
Asian American Student Association Chair
Jane Kim, a sophomore, said she thought the de
cision, reached in a Thursday night community
meeting, should appease the different factions —
people who wanted to finish it because of its artis
tic value and people who did not want it in the
center because of its misrepresenta
tion.
"People should be content, not
necessarily very happy or out
raged," Kim said. "I think people
who aren't happy with the decision
aren't aware of how the decision was
made. A lot of people don't know the
history of the mural also, which
makes things more complicated."
The student-initiated effort to
create a mural in the center began in
January 1996.
Funabiki said the group wanted
the mural to portray many sides of
the Asian experience at Stanford in
cluding South Asians, Southeast
Asians, women, activism and the
cultural performing arts.
During fall quarter, the center

commissioned the help of UCLA
artist Darryl Mar, who taught a
class for students interested on
working on the mural. The class
took trips around the Bay Area to
look for inspiration for the mural
images.
Mar designed a draft for the
mural which was presented at a
community meeting. According to
Funabiki, some people in the class
were not pleased with the draft be
cause it did not represent all of the
groups they initially wanted por
trayed.
The group then gave Mar some
recommendations on how he could
incorporate some of these images.
However, Mar began to paint the
mural anyway, without incorporat
ing the recommendations, AASA
members said.
"For the first week (of winter
quarter), he started outlining the
mural," Funabiki said. "He didn't

actually inform all members of the
class that he actually started paint
ing the mural."
Upon discovery of Mar's out
lines, students became upset over a
lack of South Asians and Southeast
Asians in the mural. Additionally,
the mural contained no images of
Stanford.
"I think his rationale was that
the figures didn't represent a cer
tain ethnicity," Funabiki said.
"They were somewhat ambigu
ous."
Some students, however, felt
they could delineate between South
Asians and other Asian groups.
After a Jan. 31 community meeting,
the center announced it would tem
porarily discontinue the project.
Mar likely will not complete the
mural, Funabiki said.
"We essentially have everything
we need to have it completed," Fun
abiki said. Some students formerly

in Mar's class expressed interest in
completing the mural themselves.
The decision to move the mural
came from some students' discom
fort at having the mural in the cen
ter.
The center "is really looking at
ways it can be a welcoming space for
all members of the community,"
said senior Kns Hayashi, who was
in Mar's art class. "I wanted to make
sure it represented the diversity of
the Asian-American community. I
didn't want the mural, as it was, to
hang in"the center.
Funabiki said many members of
the community wanted it to remain
on campus, if possible, for others to
enjoy.
Yuen said he has already been ap
proached by Okada residents inter
ested in adding a large piece to their
dormitory's art collection. The cen
ter is also considering relocating the
mural to EAST House.
