## 
### Ben Hewlett 
Stanford Symphony Orchestra
conductor and Asst. Music Prof.
Karla Lemon announced on Fri
day that she has accepted an offer
from the Music Department to
serve as its director of orchestras.
Lemon currently conducts the
symphony orchestra, teaches a
conducting class, works with
graduate students studying to be
conductors and directs a contem
porary music ensemble. In her
new position, she will perform all
of these duties and conduct the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra as
well.
Assoc. Music Prof. Chris
Chafe, the chair of the Music De
partment, said Lemon was recent
ly offered a five-year appointment
to the new position, which will not
be tenured.
"Lemon's acceptance of our
offer marks the end of an exten
sive search begun last year by the
department," Chafe said.
About 160 applications for the
job were received and reviewed by
a search committee, which select
ed four applicants as finalists.
These four auditioned with the
symphony orchestra, and the
committee recommended Lemon
for thejob.
The committee's recommenda
tion was approved by the Music
Department, and the search com
mittee made the formal offer.
"The search committee consid
ered the opinions of the entire
music community when they
made their decision," said Chafe.
"We take openness very seriously
in the appointment process.
There were no backroom things
going on with this appointment."
Allison Dietz, a cellist in the
symphony orchestra, said she was
satisfied with the input into the
decision.
"We all made an effort to give
the committee as much input as

possible, so I think that they knew
what we thought ahout the final
ists," she said.
Although Lemon has accepted
the Music Department's offer,
Chafe admitted that the process
has not been finalized. The offer
still must be approved by Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Etchemendy and Provost
Condoleezza Rice, Chafe said.
"The final steps of the process
will probably stretch through
spring quarter, but I'd like to
think that Lemon's appointment
is a done deal," he added.
Symphony orchestra mem
bers were pleased with the com
mittee's final recommendation.
"The committee made a good de
cision," said concertmaster John
Frederiksen, a junior. "Lemon
has a good feel of us and our limi
tations, which is something that
the other candidates did not
have."
"In the four years that she's
conducted the student orchestra,
Lemon has brought it up to a
much higher technical level than
in the past," Frederiksen added.
"Our current repertoire is compa
rable to that of a professional or
chestra."
Chafe was also satisfied with
the search committee's choice.
"When there is an incumbent in
volved in a search, extra attention
must be paid to objectivity in the
process. I think that our commit
tee was objective, and the candi
date that won just happened to be
the incumbent."
Lemon herself is excited at the
prospect of continuing her con
ducting career at Stanford. "I am
pleased and honored to have been
the candidate that was selected,"
she said.
"This is a wonderful time for
the performance arts here at
Stanford, and I'm excited to be a
part of that wave to the future,"
she said.
