Editor's note: This is the second in an occa
sional series on how University buildings re
ceived their names.
What exactly would it cost to have a building
named after you? According to John Ford, vice
president for development, it would take a do
nation of around one-third to one-half of the
total cost of a building. Total costs of struc
tures can range anywhere from $5 million for a
tennis court to $86 million for a major building
complex.
So much for that dream.
The Haas Center for Public Service
Stanford's Public Service Center became
the Haas Center for Public Service in 1989
after Peter Haas, the son of the late Oakland
A's owner Walter Haas, and his wife, Miriam,
gave $6.2 million as part of Stanford's Centen
nial Campaign.
The Haas family gave another $1.5 million
toward the center's new building, which was
dedicated in 1993. The $3.3 million building,
four times the size of the center's old home,
Owen House, was needed due to a lack of space.
Peter Haas spent his undergraduate /ears
at Berkeley and his graduate years at the Har
vard Graduate School of Business Administra
tion. He is a former member of the Borrd of
Trustees and has served numerous other char
ities, including the Mt. Zion Hospital and San
Francisco Aid to Retarded Children.
The Ford Center
Thomas Ford, a resident of Portola Valley,
is an active participant in Stanford affairs, es
pecially the Department of Athletics.
Ford said he is especially proud of the
progress made in women's athletics at the Uni
versity. He established a scholarship in his
name devoted solely to women's athletics; the
present holder of this scholarship is basketball

player Heather Owen.
Because of his admiration for Stanford ath
letics, Ford said he consented when ap
proached by then-Athletic Director Andy
Geiger to contribute to the construction of a
new athletics facility. This facility became the
Ford Center, which was built and dedicated in
1990.
"I was very proud of the fact that five foot
ball players and the coach of the football team
at that time also donated to the construction of
the building," said Ford.
The Ford Center is a modern extension of
the old Basketball Pavilion, now called Burn
ham Pavilion.
Ford said he was recently asked to rejoin the
Athletic Board. He last served on the board in
the 1970s shortly before his lOyear stint on the
Stanford Board of Trustees. He has also served
as legal counsel in the Stanford business office
and as director of land development for the
University.
The Jackson Library
J. Hugh Jackson, founder of the J. Hugh
Jackson Business Library, served as the second
dean of the Graduate School of Business from
1931 to 1956. He started the library in one
room with 1,000 volumes. The library has
grown to more than 400,000 volumes in books
and serials alone.
Jackson was born in 1891 on a farm in lowa.
He spent his undergraduate years at Simpson
College and received his MBA from Harvard in
1920.
He came to Stanford a few years later as a
professor of accounting. In 1931 he became the
Business School's second dean — a post he held
for 25 years.
William F. Durand Building
Dr. William F. Durand was known as the
"elder statesman" of American aviation, and
the "dean of American engineering."
Durand taught at Michigan State Universi

ty and Cornell University before joining the
Stanford faculty as head of Stanford's Mechan
ical Engineering Department in 1904. His first
major job once he joined Stanford was to help
rebuild the University after the 1906 earth
quake.
Durand developed the basic theories for the
design of the aircraft propeller, designed the
nation's first wind tunnel and was an original
member of the nation advisory committee for
aeronautics. He organized a mechanical engi
neering at Michigan State and Cornell.
He helped design the engines for the Chica
go, Boston and Atlanta Cruisers, the first steel
ships in the U.S. Navy. He served as a technical
liaison to the French during World War I and
as a major consultant on the Hoover Dam,
Hetch Hetchy, Boulder Dam and St. Lawrence
power projects.
Jordan Hall
Jordan Hall, which now houses the Psychol
ogy Department ,is named after David Starr
Jordan, the University's first president.
Oddly, he is most known for fish, becoming
the recognized authority on the fishes of the
world.
Jordan was also the first to institute what
was then called the "major professor" system,a
requirement that each student must have a
concentration before he could receive his de
gree.
Jordan retired as president in 1913. During
and after his years as president, he served as ar
investigator for the United States Fish Com
mission and was a member of the California
Fish Commission.
