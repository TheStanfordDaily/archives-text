# With a controversial past, Hoover Institution looks to future
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
As it looks toward the future, the
Hoover Institution has begun efforts to im
prove its historically uneasy ties with the
University.
Although an integral part of the Univer
sity, the Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution and Peace has been surrounded by
controversy in the past. The institution
supports numerous important researchers
and multitudes of historical resources.
The Hoover Institution and the Stan
ford Libraries have begun discussions to
improve their efforts to work together and
to repair their relationship. Over the years,
the library system and the institution have
had a rocky relationship, often duplicating
each other's collections and rarely working
together.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said Hoover
and the libraries are "looking for ways to
make their operations more synergistic and
avoid redundancies."
The discussions are focusing on which
areas both Hoover and the libraries have
collected the same materials from similar
sources and how not to repeat each other's
efforts.
In a sense, Hoover's lack of association
with the libraries has been representative
of its relationship with the rest of the Uni
versity.
Founded in 1919 by Herbert Hoover,
who became president of the United States
in 1929, the institution has become one of
the largest private collections on economic,
political and social change in the 20th cen
tury. In addition, the institution houses
more than 100 scholars studying different
areas of public policy, economics and gov
ernments.
Defined as an independent institution
within the framework of the University,
Hoover has had a checkered history during
its more than 75 years of existence. Filled
with both triumphs and crises, the institu
tion's tenure at the University has been a
busy one.
History of the Hoover Institution
In 1919, Herbert Hoover, a graduate of
the University's first class in 1895, pledged
$50,000 to be spent on collecting docu
ments and publications about World War I.
Hoover's agents, including Stanford alum
ni and professors, fanned out over Europe,
creating the largest World War I library in
the world by 1926.
Hoover was often personally involved in
expanding his war library collection. Ac
cording to some stories, while Hoover was
in Europe, his agents backed a truck up to
the government documents office in Hun
gary when the Bela Kun regime collapsed in
1919 and collected records of the first Hun
garian communist government.
During a relief mission to Europe in
1946, Hoover was personally given diaries
of Germany's propaganda minister Joseph
Goebbels and information about the Polish
underground.
As the institution's library grew larger

and researchers were added, the library
went through a number of name changes.
Originally designated the Hoover War Col
lection, in 1922 the collection's title was
changed to the Hoover War Library.
In 1941, Hoover Tower was completed,
marking the 50th anniversary of the Uni
versity. By 1946, the library was renamed
the Hoover Institute and Library on War,
Revolution and Peace, and finally in 1957 it
was renamed the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, the name it has
today.
The mission of the library has also
changed along with its name.
Originally, the library was intended to
be an archive of international documents,
according to John Raisian, director of the
institution. But as the times changed, the
institution also changed.
"Along about the 1940s and '505,"
Raisian said, the institution "began to at
tract scholars to work on the materials col
lected. In the 19705, there was a decision
made to look into domestic studies."
As the Cold War began to dominate glob
al affairs, the institution started to study
government policies of both the communist
nations and the United States and its allies.
Researchers also analyzed the economic
and political development of Third World
countries.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
collapse of the Soviet empire, some have ar
gued that the institution's days as a "bas
tion of Cold War antagonism" are num
bered, but Raisian says that the institu
tion's job has become more difficult.
"Now things are quite dynamic,"
Raisian said, "and I think we as a nation are
struggling with these new issues. And so, if
anything, our business has picked up since
1989."
A resource and research center
The Hoover Institution currently hous
es about 80 resident and 50 visiting schol
ars, studying international affairs, national
economic growth, domestic policy and
other areas of public policy. A number of fel
lowships bring visitors to the institution, al
lowing them to conduct independent re
search.
Resident scholars are appointed by the
institution staff, who make their recom
mendations directly to the University pres
ident. This differs from the process of going
through the academic council like with reg
ular faculty appointments, according to
Raisian.
While resident scholars do not necessar
ily have to teach classes, some of the schol
ars have joint appointments with the insti
tution and a regular academic department.
Joint appointees carry on their regular de
partmental duties along with their re
search at the institution.
According to Gerald Dorfman, associate
director for research, many Hoover fellows
are professors by courtesy at the University
and maintain a high level of interaction
with students.
"Many of the fellows have relationships
with the partners and programs in the Uni

versify," he said. Dorfman is a professor by
courtesy in political science and teach one
or two courses a year in political science.
"I would guess," Dorfman added, "if you
looked at all the fellows, two-thirds of them
are teaching somewhere in the University."
Palm said interaction between the
Hoover fellows and faculty in other depart
ments is encouraged.
"We have conferences in which Stanford
faculty regularly appear as speakers, and
we continue to have joint appointments be
tween Hoover and the rest of the Universi
ty," he said.
In addition to its scholars, the institu
tion contains a library of 1.6 million vol
umes, 58,000 reels of microfilm and 25,000
serial titles, while the archives hold more
than 40 million documents. The total
amount of material occupies 25 miles of
shelving.
The institution holds an endowment of
about $190 million, according to Palm, and
has a budget of about $9.5 million a year.
The library and archives receive $4 million
from general University operating funds.
A lightning rod for controversy
Throughout the years, controversy has
surrounded the Hoover Institution and
often congealed around its conservative
founder.
In describing the goals of the institu
tion in 1959, Hoover made the famous re
mark, "The purpose of this institution
must be, by its research and publications,
to demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx — whether communism, social
ism, economic materialism or atheism —
thus to protect the American way of life
from such ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the Ameri
can system."
Many Stanford faculty were worried by
the implications of this statement.
"The statement of purpose of the
Hoover Institution is inconsistent with the
purposes of Stanford as a great university,"
wrote William McCord, an assistant sociol
ogy professor, in a letter to The Daily in
1960. "Any organization of this University
must be concerned with finding truth
rather than 'demonstrating the evils' of dis
approved beliefs."
Furthermore, some faculty suggested
that the institution used its affiliation with
the University to push an anti-communist
agenda. Some even accused its members of
working with the CIA to uncover Commu
nist documents.
In the 19705, a tenured faculty member,
English Prof. Bruce Franklin, helped break
up a Hoover Institution-sponsored speech
by Henry Cabot Lodge, the former ambas
sador to Vietnam. This disruption partially
resulted in a disciplinary hearing by the
University, leading to his dismissal — the
University's first firing of a tenured faculty
member. The University cited him for both
disrupting the meeting and for inciting a
riot on an unrelated issue.
During the 1980s, Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prof. Ron Reb
holz wrote a petition seeking a Faculty Sen

ate resolution to inquire into the relation
ship between the University and the institu
tion. More than 1,500 people signed the pe
tition, including more than 70 faculty mem
bers.
"The existence of a partisan research
and policy organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University raises
serious questions concerning the academic
independence, integrity and reputation of
the University," Manley wrote in the peti
tion.
"In the Reagan years," Rebholz said in a
recent interview, "the Hoover Institution
spoke as an institution and used the name of
Stanford University, thereby compromis
ing Stanford's own position. Presidents
Kennedy and Casper said that even the
heads of departments cannot speak for the
University and still we have an institution
that's doing so."
The authors accused the institution of
using Stanford's name and funding to sub
stantiate its conservative agenda and of hir
ing faculty with the same political biases.
Because the institution's appointments are
not subject to the same requirements as reg
ular faculty, the petitioners argued that the
institution was forming a "core" of like
minded individuals.
"Virtually all the senior fellows on affir
mative action had the same political agen
da," Rebholz said. "The people who've been
brought in for five-year jobs had the same
political agenda and the whole appointment
process is highly suspect."
In seeking to investigate the institution,
Manley said they were not attacking its con
servative agenda but its political involve
ment.
"If someone offered Stanford a Franklin
Delano R'xjsevelt think tank to be put on
Stanford that would push forward a liberal
agenda, we shouldn't allow that to happen
either," said Manley.
Manley added that he feels that with the

appointment of John Raisian as director of
the institution in 1989, a lot of the opposi
tion today has subsided because of his more
diplomatic manner in dealing with the Uni
versity and the community.
"While W. Glenn Campbell was director
[of Hoover from 1960-1989), he was suffi
ciently obnoxious to enough people so that
people in the University did become critical
of Hoover," Manley said. "With Raisian,
who has a better bedside manner and is
much more agreeable than Campbell, a lot
of the opposition to Hoover has simply sub
sided because of the displacement of direc
tor over another. I think Hoover is more in
sidious than before."
However, institution members, both
then and now, argue that the petitioners ig
nored the fact that the institution member
ship is diverse. Additionally, French and
Italian Prof. Alphonse Juilland obtained
131 faculty signatures on a counter-peti
tion.
"One of our scholars took a poll a couple
of years ago, identifying who is a Republi
can and who is a Democrat at Hoover and
the result was that it was 50/50," said
Deputy Director Charles Palm. "When you
look at it as a context of the whole society,
one would conclude that we're evenly bal
anced."
Raisian agreed. "It is our intent to funda
mentally find people who are excellent," he
said. "One doesn't have to pass a political lit
mus test to become a fellow at the institu
tion. We are looking for people who funda
mentally fit the character of this place in ac
cord with the mission statement."
The University eventually decided to
take no action to investigate the institution.
The image today
Some students today continue to think
the institution is a "conservative think
tank," if they know anything about it at all,
despite the efforts of the institution to show
otherwise.
Freshman Daphne Tam said her father
is very conservative and"he always used to
discuss this place." However, she added,
"you don't hear that much about it today."
Other students said they did not know
very much about the institution.
"If it's a big think tank," said doctoral
student Melissa De term an, "I'm wondering
what they're doing, and the fact that the
campus doesn't seem to know much about it
is interesting."
Raisian believes that now the controver
sies are in the past and the institution can
move forward, despite the continuing objec
tions of opponents such as Rebholz and
Manley.
"We've been very fortunate that the con
troversies which have existed in the 1980s
have been, I think, completely erased,"
Raisian said. "The relationship with the
University is as good as I can imagine."
Dorfman also agreed with Raisian's
view.
"Finally, both sides have come to appre
ciate each other as assets to each other. Both
sides understand that we have something of
value to contribute," said Dorfman.

tion contains a library of 1.6 million vol
umes, 58,000 reels of microfilm and 25,000
serial titles, while the archives hold more
than 40 million documents. The total
amount of material occupies 25 miles of
shelving.
The institution holds an endowment of
about $190 million, according to Palm, and
has a budget of about $9.5 million a year.
The library and archives receive $4 million
from general University operating funds.
A lightning rod for controversy
Throughout the years, controversy has
surrounded the Hoover Institution and
often congealed around its conservative
founder.
In describing the goals of the institu
tion in 1959, Hoover made the famous re
mark, "The purpose of this institution
must be, by its research and publications,
to demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx — whether communism, social
ism, economic materialism or atheism —
thus to protect the American way of life
from such ideologies, their conspiracies,
and to reaffirm the validity of the Ameri
can system."
Many Stanford faculty were worried by
the implications of this statement.
"The statement of purpose of the
Hoover Institution is inconsistent with the
purposes of Stanford as a great university,"
wrote William McCord, an assistant sociol
ogy professor, in a letter to The Daily in
1960. "Any organization of this University
must be concerned with finding truth
rather than 'demonstrating the evils' of dis
approved beliefs."
Furthermore, some faculty suggested
that the institution used its affiliation with
the University to push an anti-communist
agenda. Some even accused its members of
working with the CIA to uncover Commu
nist documents.
In the 19705, a tenured faculty member,
English Prof. Bruce Franklin, helped break
up a Hoover Institution-sponsored speech
by Henry Cabot Lodge, the former ambas
sador to Vietnam. This disruption partially
resulted in a disciplinary hearing by the
University, leading to his dismissal — the
University's first firing of a tenured faculty
member. The University cited him for both
disrupting the meeting and for inciting a
riot on an unrelated issue.
During the 1980s, Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prof. Ron Reb
holz wrote a petition seeking a Faculty Sen

ate resolution to inquire into the relation
ship between the University and the institu
tion. More than 1,500 people signed the pe
tition, including more than 70 faculty mem
bers.
"The existence of a partisan research
and policy organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University raises
serious questions concerning the academic
independence, integrity and reputation of
the University," Manley wrote in the peti
tion.
"In the Reagan years," Rebholz said in a
recent interview, "the Hoover Institution
spoke as an institution and used the name of
Stanford University, thereby compromis
ing Stanford's own position. Presidents
Kennedy and Casper said that even the
heads of departments cannot speak for the
University and still we have an institution
that's doing so."
The authors accused the institution of
using Stanford's name and funding to sub
stantiate its conservative agenda and of hir
ing faculty with the same political biases.
Because the institution's appointments are
not subject to the same requirements as reg
ular faculty, the petitioners argued that the
institution was forming a "core" of like
minded individuals.
"Virtually all the senior fellows on affir
mative action had the same political agen
da," Rebholz said. "The people who've been
brought in for five-year jobs had the same
political agenda and the whole appointment
process is highly suspect."
In seeking to investigate the institution,
Manley said they were not attacking its con
servative agenda but its political involve
ment.
"If someone offered Stanford a Franklin
Delano R'xjsevelt think tank to be put on
Stanford that would push forward a liberal
agenda, we shouldn't allow that to happen
either," said Manley.
Manley added that he feels that with the

appointment of John Raisian as director of
the institution in 1989, a lot of the opposi
tion today has subsided because of his more
diplomatic manner in dealing with the Uni
versity and the community.
"While W. Glenn Campbell was director
[of Hoover from 1960-1989), he was suffi
ciently obnoxious to enough people so that
people in the University did become critical
of Hoover," Manley said. "With Raisian,
who has a better bedside manner and is
much more agreeable than Campbell, a lot
of the opposition to Hoover has simply sub
sided because of the displacement of direc
tor over another. I think Hoover is more in
sidious than before."
However, institution members, both
then and now, argue that the petitioners ig
nored the fact that the institution member
ship is diverse. Additionally, French and
Italian Prof. Alphonse Juilland obtained
131 faculty signatures on a counter-peti
tion.
"One of our scholars took a poll a couple
of years ago, identifying who is a Republi
can and who is a Democrat at Hoover and
the result was that it was 50/50," said
Deputy Director Charles Palm. "When you
look at it as a context of the whole society,
one would conclude that we're evenly bal
anced."
Raisian agreed. "It is our intent to funda
mentally find people who are excellent," he
said. "One doesn't have to pass a political lit
mus test to become a fellow at the institu
tion. We are looking for people who funda
mentally fit the character of this place in ac
cord with the mission statement."
The University eventually decided to
take no action to investigate the institution.
The image today
Some students today continue to think
the institution is a "conservative think
tank," if they know anything about it at all,
despite the efforts of the institution to show
otherwise.
Freshman Daphne Tam said her father
is very conservative and"he always used to
discuss this place." However, she added,
"you don't hear that much about it today."
Other students said they did not know
very much about the institution.
"If it's a big think tank," said doctoral
student Melissa De term an, "I'm wondering
what they're doing, and the fact that the
campus doesn't seem to know much about it
is interesting."
Raisian believes that now the controver
sies are in the past and the institution can
move forward, despite the continuing objec
tions of opponents such as Rebholz and
Manley.
"We've been very fortunate that the con
troversies which have existed in the 1980s
have been, I think, completely erased,"
Raisian said. "The relationship with the
University is as good as I can imagine."
Dorfman also agreed with Raisian's
view.
"Finally, both sides have come to appre
ciate each other as assets to each other. Both
sides understand that we have something of
value to contribute," said Dorfman.


Hoover Tower
As it looks toward the future, the
Hoover Institution has begun efforts to im
prove its historically uneasy ties with the
University.
Although an integral part of the Univer
sity, the Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution and Peace has been surrounded by
controversy in the past. The institution
supports numerous important researchers
and multitudes of historical resources.
The Hoover Institution and the Stan
ford Libraries have begun discussions to
improve their efforts to work together and
to repair their relationship. Over the years,
the library system and the institution have
had a rocky relationship, often duplicating
each other's collections and rarely working
together.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said Hoover
and the libraries are "looking for ways to
make their operations more synergistic and
avoid redundancies."
The discussions are focusing on which
areas both Hoover and the libraries have
collected the same materials from similar
sources and how not to repeat each other's
efforts.
In a sense, Hoover's lack of association
with the libraries has been representative
of its relationship with the rest of the Uni
versity.
Founded in 1919 by Herbert Hoover,
who became president of the United States
in 1929, the institution has become one of
the largest private collections on economic,
political and social change in the 20th cen
tury. In addition, the institution houses
more than 100 scholars studying different
areas of public policy, economics and gov
ernments.
Defined as an independent institution
within the framework of the University,
Hoover has had a checkered history during
its more than 75 years of existence. Filled
with both triumphs and crises, the institu
tion's tenure at the University has been a
busy one.
History of the Hoover Institution
In 1919, Herbert Hoover, a graduate of
the University's first class in 1895, pledged
$50,000 to be spent on collecting docu
ments and publications about World War I.
Hoover's agents, including Stanford alum
ni and professors, fanned out over Europe,
creating the largest World War I library in
the world by 1926.
Hoover was often personally involved in
expanding his war library collection. Ac
cording to some stories, while Hoover was
in Europe, his agents backed a truck up to
the government documents office in Hun
gary when the Bela Kun regime collapsed in
1919 and collected records of the first Hun
garian communist government.
During a relief mission to Europe in
1946, Hoover was personally given diaries
of Germany's propaganda minister Joseph
Goebbels and information about the Polish
underground.
As the institution's library grew larger

and researchers were added, the library
went through a number of name changes.
Originally designated the Hoover War Col
lection, in 1922 the collection's title was
changed to the Hoover War Library.
In 1941, Hoover Tower was completed,
marking the 50th anniversary of the Uni
versity. By 1946, the library was renamed
the Hoover Institute and Library on War,
Revolution and Peace, and finally in 1957 it
was renamed the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, the name it has
today.
The mission of the library has also
changed along with its name.
Originally, the library was intended to
be an archive of international documents,
according to John Raisian, director of the
institution. But as the times changed, the
institution also changed.
"Along about the 1940s and '505,"
Raisian said, the institution "began to at
tract scholars to work on the materials col
lected. In the 19705, there was a decision
made to look into domestic studies."
As the Cold War began to dominate glob
al affairs, the institution started to study
government policies of both the communist
nations and the United States and its allies.
Researchers also analyzed the economic
and political development of Third World
countries.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
collapse of the Soviet empire, some have ar
gued that the institution's days as a "bas
tion of Cold War antagonism" are num
bered, but Raisian says that the institu
tion's job has become more difficult.
"Now things are quite dynamic,"
Raisian said, "and I think we as a nation are
struggling with these new issues. And so, if
anything, our business has picked up since
1989."
A resource and research center
The Hoover Institution currently hous
es about 80 resident and 50 visiting schol
ars, studying international affairs, national
economic growth, domestic policy and
other areas of public policy. A number of fel
lowships bring visitors to the institution, al
lowing them to conduct independent re
search.
Resident scholars are appointed by the
institution staff, who make their recom
mendations directly to the University pres
ident. This differs from the process of going
through the academic council like with reg
ular faculty appointments, according to
Raisian.
While resident scholars do not necessar
ily have to teach classes, some of the schol
ars have joint appointments with the insti
tution and a regular academic department.
Joint appointees carry on their regular de
partmental duties along with their re
search at the institution.
According to Gerald Dorfman, associate
director for research, many Hoover fellows
are professors by courtesy at the University
and maintain a high level of interaction
with students.
"Many of the fellows have relationships
with the partners and programs in the Uni

versify," he said. Dorfman is a professor by
courtesy in political science and teach one
or two courses a year in political science.
"I would guess," Dorfman added, "if you
looked at all the fellows, two-thirds of them
are teaching somewhere in the University."
Palm said interaction between the
Hoover fellows and faculty in other depart
ments is encouraged.
"We have conferences in which Stanford
faculty regularly appear as speakers, and
we continue to have joint appointments be
tween Hoover and the rest of the Universi
ty," he said.
In addition to its scholars, the institu
tion contains a library of 1.6 million vol
umes, 58,000 reels of microfilm and 25,000
serial titles, while the archives hold more
than 40 million documents. The total
amount of material occupies 25 miles of
shelving.
The institution holds an endowment of
about $190 million, according to Palm, and
has a budget of about $9.5 million a year.
The library and archives receive $4 million
from general University operating funds.

"If it's a big think tank," said doctoral
student Melissa De term an, "I'm wondering
what they're doing, and the fact that the
campus doesn't seem to know much about it
is interesting."
Raisian believes that now the controver
sies are in the past and the institution can
move forward, despite the continuing objec
tions of opponents such as Rebholz and
Manley.
"We've been very fortunate that the con
troversies which have existed in the 1980s
have been, I think, completely erased,"
Raisian said. "The relationship with the
University is as good as I can imagine."
Dorfman also agreed with Raisian's
view.
"Finally, both sides have come to appre
ciate each other as assets to each other. Both
sides understand that we have something of
value to contribute," said Dorfman.
