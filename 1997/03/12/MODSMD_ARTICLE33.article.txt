### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Dwight Wilbur, Class of 1923,
one of Stanford's most distin
guished alumni and son of former-
Stanford president Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Class of 1897, died Sunday
of natural causes. A San Francisco
internist and gastroenterologist,
Dwight Wilbur was also a president
of the American Medical Associa
tion and a nationwide medical
leader during creation of Medicare
and Medicaid.
Wilbur was born Sept. 18,1903,
in England, while his father was
visiting Europe for advanced med
ical training. Then, beginning a
lifelong association with Stanford,
Wilbur spent his early childhood
growing up in a house that stood on
the exact spot where Tresidder
Union now stands.
A zoology major at Stanford,
Wilbur spent just three years as an
undergraduate before graduating
with distinction in 1923. He then
studied medicine at Stanford for
two years and subsequently trans
ferred to the University of Pennsyl

vania, where he received his med
ical degree in 1926. Wilbur com
pleted his medical training at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
when the Mayo brothers were still
teaching there.
Following his residency at
Mayo, Wilbur remained there for
several more years as a member of
the medical staff. "The golden age
of Mayo was just like being in
heaven," Wilbur told an inter
viewer. "One way to explain the
unfortunate trend in medicine to
wards scientist / doctors who are
poor clinicians is that medical stu
dents and young physicians no
longer have many clinical role
models. But my own clinical role
models were endless. The Mayos,
for example, were the two greatest
doctors that ever lived — no ques
tion in my mind — and my learn
ing experience as first assistant to
Dr. Charlie Mayo was like being a
cow in a field of clover."
Wilbur returned to California in
1937 and entered private practice
in San Francisco. In that same year
he also became an assistant profes
sor of clinical medicine at Stanford.

During World War 11, Wilbur
served as chief of medicine at the
U.S. Naval Hospital in Oakland.
Wilbur was strongly influenced
by his father in both clinical and
administrative medicine.
Wilbur's father served as presi
dent of the California Physician
Service, the first state medical as

sociation-sponsored insurance
plan, later renamed Blue Shield.
Strongly influenced by his fa
ther's experiences and a self-de
scribed "liberal conservative,"
Wilbur spearheaded the Ameri
can Medical Association's efforts
to stop the socialization of medi
cine in America.
In 1968 Wilbur was voted presi
dent of the AMA, the same post
that his father held 45 years earli
er. During the AMA's 149-year his
tory, it remains the sole instance of
a son following his father in that es
teemed position.
Wilbur is fondly remembered
for his dry sense of humor, which
many friends felt reflected his
British birthplace. Once while de
scribing his promotion to full clini
cal professor at Stanford, Wilbur
commented, "I served as a dollar-a
year man, and I never even got the
dollar."
Wilbur is survived by a large
family, including his sister, Lois, of
Palo Alto, his wife, Ruth Jordan
Wilbur, Class of 1927 and two sons.
Funeral arrangements are pending
at this time.
