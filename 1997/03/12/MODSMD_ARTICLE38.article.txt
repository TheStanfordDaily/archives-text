## No. 1 seed in the West Card beats ASU, 18-0 in Pacific 10 
### Ed Guzman Senior Staff writer 
Today, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Tomorrow, the NCAA.
For the second year in a row,
the third-ranked Cardinal (30-1,
18-0 Pac-10) swept through its
conference schedule, completing
the task Saturday night by
brushing aside Arizona State (9-
19, 3-15) 81-62 before 3,104 fans
in the University Activity Center
in Tempe, Ariz.
Despite early sluggishness
(and an early deficit), Stanford
regrouped to shoot 50 percent
from the floor as well as place
four players in double figures,
led by junior center Olympia
Scott. The All-Pac-10 selection
poured in 23 points and grabbed
12 rebounds (tying a career high)
over a painfully slow Sun Devil
front line. Redshirt sophomore
forward Kristin Folkl nailed all
seven of her field goal attempts
for a season-high 15 points and
pulled down eight rebounds.
Pac-10 Player of the Year
Kate Starbird was held to 14
points, but it mattered little as
the Cardinal never looked back
after trailing 17-16 with eight
minutes left in the first half.
"Olympia had a great game,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, who was named
Pac-10 coach of the year. "Folkl
was also able to come in really

strong for us."
With Stanford rolling with
frightening efficiency Thursday
night, Arizona State looked like
roadkill heading into Saturday's
game. Unfortunately, the Cardi
nal came out flat early, missing
easy shots and getting out-hus
tled. The result was an inauspi
cious 15-11 deficit halfway
through the first half. At that
point, Stanford was shooting 3-
of-16, and VanDerveer took a
timeout shortly thereafter to
make them aware of it.
"Play, finish, wake up," said
All-Pac-10 senior guard Jamila
Wideman, summarizing the dis
cussion in the huddle.
From there, the Cardinal
went on a 30-9 run to close the
half in distinct fast-break fash
ion. Folkl and Scott found their
groove down low. Folkl's layup
at the buzzer finished the run
and opened Stanford's lead to
41-24. Arizona State was unrav
eling fast, turning over the ball
12 times in the first half while
shooting a dismal 32 percent
from the field.
The second half was more
evenly played, but that just
meant the Cardinal was able to
maintain its 17-point advantage.
Two free throws by Arizona State
freshman center Rachel Holt
made it 59-46 with 9:18 left in the
game. But an 11-1 run over the
next three minutes stretched it to a
70-47 advantage and effectively put
the game out of reach. Senior guard
Charmin Smith followed up her

strong play against Arizona by hit
ting 5-of-6 field goals, good for 11
points. Meanwhile, Arizona State
could not overcome terrible shoot
ing (31 percent), and its halfcourt
game was a study in cluelessness.
So, with the regular season
and the Pac-10 honors out of the
way, the Cardinal can set its
sights on a much bigger prize: the

national championship. With the
No. 1 seed in the West Region,
Stanford is set to face Howard
(24-5, 16-0 Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference) Saturday at 6:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion. The
Lady Bisons clinched a berth by
winning their postseason tourna
ment and ending the regular sea
son on a 23-game winning streak.
