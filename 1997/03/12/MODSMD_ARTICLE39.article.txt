# Men's swimmers win Pac-10s, on to NCAAs

Top-ranked Stanford men's
swimming won its 16th straight
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship over the weekend, finishing
85 points ahead of second-place
USC.
Riding the momentum of out
standing swims by its junior class,
the Cardinal's victory was more
than convincing. This year's meet
was marked by a higher level of
parity than in the past, with Ari
zona leading after the first day of
competition and USC and Califor
nia staying in the team-scoring
hunt throughout the weekend.
But Stanford's talent and depth
upheld its dynasty in the face of an
improved conference with individ
ual wins from juniors Tom Wilkens
in the 200-yard individual medley
(1:46.99) and 200 breaststroke
(1:57.63), Jed Crowe in the 100
butterfly (47.49) and Andre Salles-
Cunha in the 100 breaststroke.
Stanford's 400 freestyle relay
(Sabir Muhammad, Wilkens, Matt
Pierce and Scott Claypool) won in a
time of 3:14.07, and the 200 med
ley relay of Muhammad, Salles-
Cunha, Crowe and Claypool won in
1:27.32.
It seemed to be a weekend in
which schools showed strength
concentrated in specific events. In
the 100 butterfly, for example,
Crowe's victory came over second
place teammate and defending

Pac-10 champion and conference
record-holder Muhammad. In the
200 freestyle, USC filled seven of
the eight lanes in the final heat
with its own swimmers, scoring big
points on the second day of compe
tition.
With its big second day, USC
caught and passed Arizona, which
led after day one, while Stanford's
strength in the 200 breast, 100 free,
200 back and 200 fly on the last day
helped it pull out the victory.
Wilkens' clutch performance in
the 200 breaststroke distinguished
him as Stanford's only double win
ner of the weekend. Sophomores
Tate Blahnik and Dan Schultz
pulled a 4-5 finish in the 200 back
stroke while junior Claypool and
freshman Glenn Counts finished
2-3 in the 100 freestyle. Adding
Pierce's second-place finish in the
200 butterfly, and one can see why
the Cardinal's strength on the
third day helped it come away with
the title.
Along with chasing the team
victory, Stanford's swimmers were
shooting for individual qualifying
times for the NCAA Champi
onships. Teams that go to the meet
are comprised of swimmers who
qualified either individually or on
relays. Those who do not meet the
highest standards but swam faster
than the consideration standards
must wait to see if they are offered
a "wild card" invitation.
