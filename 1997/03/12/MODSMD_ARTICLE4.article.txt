# Mental illness clinical center in jeopardy
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
Stanford Medical School may
lose a major clinical research cen
ter as a result of dismissing Psy
chiatry Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum,
the center's director.
For 20 years, scientists at Stan
ford's Mental Health Clinical Re
search Center to Study Biological
Correlates of Psychopathology
have been studying the biology of
mental illness. The center's fund
ing grant is now in jeopardy, un
less the University finds a princi
pal investigator who will be ac
ceptable to the National Institute
of Mental Health, the grant's
source. The principal investigator
is a faculty member in charge of
obtaining a research grant, over
seeing the project and providing
its overall scientific direction.
Director of University Commu
nications Terry Shepard said dis
cussions between the University
and NIMH are continuing. No de
cision about the future of the cen

ter has been reached, he added.
However, according to Kelvin
Lim, assistant psychiatry profes
sor and the center's clinical direc
tor, the current plan is to shut
down the center by November.
"I think the effect [of closing
the centerj would be devastating,"
Lim said, adding that many scien
tists rely on resources offered by
the center. In six or seven months,
these resources may disappear.
The center requested a little
more than $1 million in NIMH
funding for the year beginning De
cember 1996, and its personnel re
port lists 57 members, including
consultants and collaborators.
According to Pfefferbaum,
NIMH has not sent money to the
center so far for the funding cycle
that started last December. "My
removal as principal investigator
was a devastating blow to me per
sonally," Pfefferbaum said, "and,
as events have unfolded, it has be
come clear that the very existence
of the research center is in serious
doubt."
As the center's leader for the
last 10 years, Pfefferbaum said he
wrote "two consecutive five-year
grant proposals, both of which
were fully funded." However, he
was dismissed from Stanford and
removed as the grant's principal
investigator last summer.
Charging intolerable working
conditions and abuses of academic
freedom, Pfefferbaum resigned
his teaching position at the Veter
ans Affairs Hospital in Palo Alto in
July. Despite Pfefferbaum's dis
agreement, the University has
maintained that his action actual
ly amounted to a resignation from
Stanford faculty.
When the October deadline for
submitting an Application for
Continuation of the Center ap
proached, Pfefferbaum prepared
the lengthy document. The repre
sentatives of the University re
fused to sign the application, he

said.
A letter sent on Oct. 8 by John
Hsiao, acting chief of the Schizo
phrenia Research Branch of
NIMH, informed the University
that Pfefferbaum's report was
submitted with his signature
alone.
Hsiao also noted that "a change
in director for a [clinical research
center] is not a minor matter. ...
Unless Stanford is able, by Dec. 1,
to find a suitable replacement di
rector for the center, or opts to re
tain Dr. Pfefferbaum, NIMH will
need to consider whether to move
towards withdrawing future sup
port for the center."
"Since the major focus of the
center is neuroimaging studies of
patients with schizophrenia," he
said, "a new director would have to
be a senior investigator with a track
record in both neuroimaging and
schizophrenia research. It may not
be easy for Stanford to find some
one who meets these criteria, par
ticularly on short notice."
In November, NIMH extended
its application deadline, and the
University submitted its applica
tion with Psychiatry Prof. Jerome

Yesavage as the center's interim
director and principal investiga
tor.
NIMH was not satisfied. In a
Jan. 8 letter, Hsiao informed
Yesavage that the center will not
be funded at the full level and sug
gested some possible options for
dealing with that decision.
Noting that Yesavage also di
rects the Stanford Aging Clinical
Research Center, Hsiao said his
"proposed responsibilities as di
rector of two CRCs at one time are
unprecedented and do not seem
feasible." He also expressed con
cern about expertise in neu
roimaging and schizophrenia re
search required to direct the cen
ter at a fully funded level.
Lim said he understands the
position of NIMH to be that sup
port for the center will not be re
newed unless Pfefferbaum is rein
stated.
Pfefferbaum "provided the
major intellectual impetus and
drive for the center," he added. Ac
cording to Lim, the center is quite
specialized, and the University
has been unable to recruit or ap
point anyone who could "fill Pfef

ferbaum's shoes" to the satisfac
tion of the NIMH.
In the fall, Pfefferbaum accept
ed a job at SRI International.
"Despite my wrongful dis
missal and the demeaning and
shoddy treatment by Stanford, I
agreed to try to help them contin
ue the research center by collabo
rating from SRI," he said. "I of
fered to serve again as principal in
vestigator from SRI, but Stanford
refused."
Last month, a Santa Clara
County Superior Court judge or
dered the University to reinstate
Pfefferbaum as a professor, "with
the full rights, benefits and privi
leges of a tenured member of the
Stanford faculty," and to refund
its share of PfefTerbaum's salary.
"Stanford has done nothing to
comply with this order," Pfeffer
baum said, "I have not received
current or back pay, nor have my
privileges, including being princi
pal investigator and director of the
research center, been restored."
Shepard declined to comment
