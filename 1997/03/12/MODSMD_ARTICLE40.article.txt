# Men seeded 6th, will play Oklahoma
## Men stay out West for Big Dance 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Four months ago, college basketball pun
dits touted this Stanford basketball team as
potentially one of the school's best ever.
Beginning Friday, the Cardinal gets its
chance to show just how good it can be.
Twenty-seven games have shown Stan
ford to be one of the best teams in the coun
try. With a 86-63 whupping of Arizona State
Saturday, the Cardinal finished the regular
season 20-7 and tied for second place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 12-6 league
record. Sunday the NCAA tournament
selection committee recognized Stanford by
awarding it a No. 6 seed, the Cardinal's
highest seeding since 1988-89, and placing

it in the West Regional.
But all those numbers will be forgotten
when Stanford tips off against llth-seeded
Oklahoma (19-10) in its first-round game
Friday in Tucson, Ariz., at 7:15 p.m. PST on
CBS. So will the fact that this is Stanford's
ninth postseason appearance in 10 years
and its third straight trip to the NCAA
tournament. And so will the fact that Stan
ford has been ranked in the top 25 all sea
son.
That's because it's March Madness,
which means everybody gets a clean slate,
and anything — absolutely anything — can
happen. Prestigious preseason invitation
als, conference tournaments and national
rankings all get air time during the regular
season, but it's all little more than a prelude

to the Big Dance. It's the second season, the
time of year that can make or break a
school's reputation, not to mention a
coach's job security.
"We're excited," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I like where
we're going."
It's hard for Montgomery not to like
where the Cardinal is going, considering
Stanford has been shipped east to Albany,
N.Y., and Providence, R. 1., the past two sea
sons. This year the Cardinal gets to play in
the Pac-10's very own McKale Center.
"I was hoping for Salt Lake," said senior
forward Rich Jackson, a native of Provo,
Utah, "but Tucson's great. I think the fans
there will be supportive of us."
The Sooners are coached by
Kelvin Sampson, a friend of
Montgomery's who went to Nor
man after a seven-year stint at
Washington State, during which
he led the Cougars to their first
ever NCAA tournament berth. In
1995 Sampson earned national
coach of the year honors after
turning a then-mediocre Sooner
team into a top-25 power.
"If there were to be a nega
tive," Montgomery said, "it
would only be that they know
what we do and always did a good
job of preparing for us."
Oklahoma has been to the
tournament the past two years
and is led by 6-foot-5 guard Nate
Erdmann, who averages 20.4
points and 4.8 rebounds a game.
He played for Sampson at Wash
ington State his freshman year
— Stanford seniors Brevin
Knight and Jackson both remem
ber facing him — before transfer
ring to a junior college and then
to Oklahoma.
If Stanford survives the Soon
ers, it advances to Sunday's sec
ond round and a likely matchup
with third-seeded Wake Forest,
which meets West Coast Confer
ence champion and 14th-seeded
St. Mary's earlier Friday.
That scenario would pit Stan
ford sophomore center Tim

Young against W'ake's senior Ail-
American Tim Duncan — by all
accounts the best player in col
lege basketball and a lock for the
No. 1 pick in this summer's NBA
draft.
"I think there is mutual
respect there," Montgomery said
of the two centers, who along
with Knight played under Mont
gomery last summer as part of
the USA 22-and-under National
Team. "Those kids know each
very well."
A win Sunday, of course,
would mean a trip to the Sweet
16, which in this case would mean
just a short hike down Highway
101 to San Jose Arena. Stanford,
which has lost to Massachusetts
in the tournament's second
round the past two years, has not
advanced to the round of 16 since
1942, the year it won its first and
last national championship
But that's getting ahead of
things, and the Cardinal would
certainly b« ill-advised to look
past Oklahoma. The Sooners fin
ished by winning eight of their
last 11 and have recorded con
vincing wins over tournament
teams Colorado (twice), Texas
and Purdue. They also lost by
just two points to No. 1 Kansas,
which means anything can hap
pen come Friday.
Stanford has reached its first
goal: making the 64-team tour
nament field. Now the games
really count — one loss and your
season is over. lx»t the madness
begin
