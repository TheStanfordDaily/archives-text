# Men seeded 6th, will play Oklahoma
## Men stay out West for Big Dance

Four months ago, college basketball pun
dits touted this Stanford basketball team as
potentially one of the school's best ever.
Beginning Friday, the Cardinal gets its
chance to show just how good it can be.
Twenty-seven games have shown Stan
ford to be one of the best teams in the coun
try. With a 86-63 whupping of Arizona State
Saturday, the Cardinal finished the regular
season 20-7 and tied for second place in the

to the Big Dance. It's the second season, the
time of year that can make or break a
school's reputation, not to mention a
coach's job security.
"We're excited," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I like where
we're going."
It's hard for Montgomery not to like
where the Cardinal is going, considering
Stanford has been shipped east to Albany,
N.Y., and Providence, R. 1., the past two sea
sons. This year the Cardinal gets to play in
the Pac-10's very own McKale Center.
"I was hoping for Salt Lake," said senior
