# Brevin shines bright in final game at home
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
It was hard to tell whether the 7,391 fans packed
in Maples Pavilion Saturday were there for the
Brevin Knight sendoff or the Stan ford-Arizona
State game.
It doesn't matter much either way, because
Knight, senior forward Rich Jackson and the Car
dinal all got a proper farewell, as Stanford put the
finishing touch on a perfect home season (12-0) by
dismantling Arizona State 86-63.
The game amounted to little more than an
NCAA tournament tuneup for Stanford (20-7, 12-6
Pacific 10 Conference), which finished in a three
way tie for second place in the Pac-10 along with
USC and California. The Cardinal never looked
back after Knight staked Stanford to a 2-0 lead by
converting a clean steal into a layup at the other
end — a play fans have seen countless times during
Knight's four-year career.
The second-team Ail-American finished the
game with 21 points, allowing him to pass former
teammate Dion Cross for third place on Stanford's
career scoring list The 5-10 point guard, who also
owns the school records for assists (756) and steals
(291), was also named a first-team All-Pac-10 selec
tion for the third year in a row.
Knight, who was honored along with Jackson in
a rousing pre-game ceremony, took a seat with 2
minutes, 45 seconds remaining to a thunderous
standing ovation. Stanford's Sixth Man Club also
expressed its sentiments the way it best can — by
chant. Only this time, instead of the usual invective
directed at the opposing team, the student section's
cheer took the more amiable form of "Thank you,
Bre-vin."
Knight finished 4-of-6 from three-point range,
burying three treys in a span of 2:07 to key a 12-2
first-half run that put Stanford ahead by 13 and
took the life out of the Sun Devils. The Cardinal led
47-29 at halftime and cleared its bench with less
than three minutes remaining in the game. Stan
ford also outrebounded Arizona State by a whop
ping 21-rebound margin and outshot the Sun Dev
ils. 49 percent to 37.
While the night belonged to Knight and Jackson,
the game itself belonged to center Tim Young, who
put up monster numbers for the second game in a
row (22 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks against
Arizona Thursday), earning him Pac-10 player of
the week honors for the first time in his career. The
7-foot-1 sophomore scored 23 points (19 of them in
the first half) and pulled down 16 rebounds and
could have had more if not for being rested most of
the second half.
Stanford closed the regular season having won
four straight and seven of its last eight. Arizona
State (10-20, 2-16), meanwhile, finished the season

with a school-record 11 straight
losses.
