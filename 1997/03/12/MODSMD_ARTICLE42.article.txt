# Women swimmers go for 7th consecutive NCAA championship
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Some athletes wait their entire
lives to have a chance to win a
national championship, and most
never do. However, if you are a
female swimmer or diver at Stan
ford, you get the chance nearly

every year.
As hard as it is to believe, the
Stanford women's swimming and
diving team will be traveling to
Indianapolis the weekend of March
20-22 to defend its national title for
the fifth straight year.
Complete with a group of experi
enced seniors and a host of talented

freshmen, the top-ranked unde
feated Cardinal squad (10-0) enters
the NCAA Championships, unlike
last year (when the team fell to
USC in the regular season), as the
heavy favorite.
"My approach every year is the
same," said head coach Richard
Quick, who is looking for his 12th

career team championship this
year. "My goal is to have all of the
athletes on our squad perform to
their fullest potential at the NCAA
Championships.
"I think with the talent and the
experiences we've had this year
and with how hard the team has
worked, that's going to give us a
chance to contend for the title."
One reason that the Cardinal,
which won its 11th straight Pacific
10 Conference crown March 1, is
such a heavy favorite is that the
team has qualified 18 swimmers
for this year's championship. The
closest any team has come to
matching Stanford is Nebraska,
with 13 swimmers. Perennial pow
erhouses Texas, USC, Georgia and
Auburn are not far behind either,
having qualified 12 swimmers
each.
The margin of competitors the
Cardinal has qualified right now
could decrease this weekend when
the divers have their qualifying
meet in Colorado Springs, Colo.
However, given that Stanford has
a strong diving team, the squad
should maintain its sizable lead.
Quick realizes that just having
the most swimmers in the meet is
not enough to guarantee a victory,
though

"It doesn't make any difference
if you have 18 athletes qualified if
(swimmers No.) 14-18 don't score
points in the championship races,"
he said. "They just don't give you
points for showing up, but never
theless, we do have more opportu
nities to score points, which I think
is an advantage "
As Quick has pointed out all sea
son, this year's championship will
most likely be won by the team
with the most depth, rather than
the squad with a few outstanding
swimmers. For example, SMI'
enters with the top seed in five
events (compared to Stanford's two
non-relay top seeds). However, it is
likely that the team didn't qualify
enough swimmers (nine) to make a
strong enough run for the title.
Quick expects Georgia, a team
t hat was in contention for the title
until the final day of competition
last year to be the biggest chal
lengers but also believes that his
own swimmers will decide the out
come of meet — not the competi
tion.
"In my opinion, the best we can
hope for is for our top six athletes
to compete evenly with the other
top teams' top six," Quick said.
"And the difference is going to be
what happens with the bottom

two-thirds of the team. I think we
have a tremendous advantage
there because we have some great
athletes throughout our lineup."
Among Stanford's top six all
season have been freshman
Catherine Fox, junior Elin
Austevoll and seniors Claudia
Franco, Michelle Jesperson and
Sarah Anderson.
Additionally, as the team heads
to nationals, Quick expects other
Stanford swimmers to make waves
in Indianapolis.
"Look for Chantal Rawn to be a
surprise in the NCAAs to most peo
ple," he said of the freshman who
oompetes in the 200-yard individu
al medley and the 100 and 200
backstroke. "She's had a strong,
consistent year and done a very
good job."
Quick also mentioned swim
mers Jessica Amey, another fresh
man, who has performed well
recently, and junior Evi-Lynn
Byer, who at this time last year was
struggling to qualify for nationals
but who is now Beeded ninth in the
nation in the 200 back
"She's just done em outstanding
job this year," Quick said. "If our
team has swims like Byer had at
the Pac-10 Championships, we are
going to have a great NCAAa."
