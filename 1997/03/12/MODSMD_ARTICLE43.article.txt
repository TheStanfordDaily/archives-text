# Heading for nationals
## Synchro faces OSU 
### Scott Judd Contributing writer 
Bring on Ohio State.
After a spectacular season
full of lopsided team victories
and individual triumphs, the
synchronized swimming team
travels to Florida State to com
pete in the Collegiate Nation
als beginning today. Although
the undefeated Cardinal will
face competition from the best
swimmers 25 schools, they are
concerned with only one other
squad — perennial national
champion Ohio State.
A little background may
help explain Stanford's focus.
In nine of the past 10 years,
the Cardinal has traveled to
the national championships
and come home with a second
place finish, distinguishing
them as one of the most domi
nant squads in synchronized
swimming history. But in all
10 of those years, it was Ohio
State who claimed the national
title.
Ending the Buckeyes' reign
this year promises to be a diffi
cult task. Aided by a vastly
larger budget and lower school
entrance standards, they bring
a team of 30 swimmers to
nationals that is almost three
times the size of Stanford's.
Included on this roster are last
year's NCAA champion duet
team and five former members
of the U.S. junior national
team.
"Ohio State's been No. 1
since 1985," said assistant
coach Andy Maisel. "Our bud
get is around $10,000 per year,
while Ohio State has a budget
of over $180,000. That gives
them more travel, more sup
port, more full-time coaches
and more individual attention

for their swimmers."
But while Ohio State may
have these advantages, Stan
ford is ready to meet the chal
lenge with an impressive line
up of senior leadership and
new talent. In meets this year,
the second-ranked Cardinal
has swept every single event,
and this experience should give
them confidence as they head
into the championships.
Stanford's path to victory
will not be an easy one, howev
er.
Because of Ohio State's
larger squad, Stanford will
most likely need to win three of
the four events, plus figures. If
the Cardinal is to have any
chance of toppling Ohio State,
it must continue executing its
routines with the same preci
sion and flair it has exhibited
all season.
The addition of Olympic
gold medalist Heather Pease
could make the difference for
Stanford, as the junior transfer
has completely dominated her
competitors since returning to
college athletics. Pease swept
the figures, solo, duet and trio
events in last week's West
Regional NCAA Champi
onships and should make a
strong impact at the NCAA
Championships.
Senior Bridget Finn, a
member of the U.S. national
team and last year's NCAA
champion in the solo event,
said she is greatly anticipating
the chance to compete against
Ohio State one last time.
"Heather's been a great
addition to our team, and this
meet is our chance to bring
home the championship," Finn
said. "For a lot of us, it's going
to be the grand finale to our
time at Stanford."
