# Women's golf battles against trees, finishes 10th at the Spartan Invite

Remember those Peanuts cartoons where the
trees ate Charlie Brown's kites?
The second-ranked Stanford women's golf team
does â€” well, sort of.
When the team played the Ford-Ord Bayonet
Course in Monterey, Calif, over the weekend, some of
the trees ate its golf balls.
"I don't know what kind of trees they were, but
some of the balls got stuck in them and never came
down," said head coach Caroline O'Connor.
The team placed 10th in the Spartan Invitational
after shooting a 966 team stroke total. San Jose State,
which sponsored the event, finished in first place.
Freshman Julie Dunn led the team with a 239 and

tied for 17th place. Top-seeded Mhairi McKay, in 21st
place, followed with a 241. Sophomore Jenny Pippin,
in her third scoring tournament this season, shot a
245. Others included sophomore Michelle Sperry at
246 and freshman Jae Jean Ro with a 250.
Only 17 of the 77 team golf players, which includ
ed some of women's intercollegiate top golfers, scored
lower than 80 on the first day. The course, at par 74,
is not particularly long but is considered difficult
because of its visually deceptive layout.
It was perfect golf weather. Warm, sunny and no
wind. A golfer could not ask for anything more, except
that the fairways were as narrow as phone booths and
those trees, those horrible, cumbersome trees were in
the way.
