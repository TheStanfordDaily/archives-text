# Women's golf battles against trees, finishes 10th at the Spartan Invite

Remember those Peanuts cartoons where the
trees ate Charlie Brown's kites?
The second-ranked Stanford women's golf team
does — well, sort of.
When the team played the Ford-Ord Bayonet
Course in Monterey, Calif, over the weekend, some of
the trees ate its golf balls.
"I don't know what kind of trees they were, but
some of the balls got stuck in them and never came
down," said head coach Caroline O'Connor.
The team placed 10th in the Spartan Invitational
after shooting a 966 team stroke total. San Jose State,
which sponsored the event, finished in first place.
Freshman Julie Dunn led the team with a 239 and

tied for 17th place. Top-seeded Mhairi McKay, in 21st
place, followed with a 241. Sophomore Jenny Pippin,
in her third scoring tournament this season, shot a
245. Others included sophomore Michelle Sperry at
246 and freshman Jae Jean Ro with a 250.
Only 17 of the 77 team golf players, which includ
ed some of women's intercollegiate top golfers, scored
lower than 80 on the first day. The course, at par 74,
is not particularly long but is considered difficult
because of its visually deceptive layout.
It was perfect golf weather. Warm, sunny and no
wind. A golfer could not ask for anything more, except
that the fairways were as narrow as phone booths and
those trees, those horrible, cumbersome trees were in
the way.
"There were just way too many
trees. I just wanted to chop them
all down," Dunn said.
On the final day of the tourna
ment, balls seemed to land any
where but in the pin for the Card.
"It's not very fun playing bad
golf. In fact, it's the worst thing in
the world," said Pippin, who fin
ished in 35th place.
The Card squad moved into
seventh place, just nine strokes
shy of second place, on the second
day of the tournament. But the

team never caught up during the
third round. It smacked into trou
ble on the 11th and 12th holes.
Birdies and pars were sparse
during the two dogleg left holes,
cut to an almost 90-degree angle.
"Such holes require that you
hit it perfectly, like threading a
needle," O'Connor said.
Hunched over, freshman Dunn
tensed up her grip and swing dur
ing those holes. She hit a driver
shot which started to sail perfect
ly, but the ball clipped the tree as
it rounded the corner and dropped
straight into despair.
"Drivers, 3-woods, irons," she
said, "no matter what club I used,
the ball just wouldn't go where I

wanted it to."
Pippin's ball plunked into a
burrowing animal hole. Because of
a delay in the ruling, Pippin had to
bump it out into the fairway from
that very spot.
"It was frustrating Burrowing
animal holes are considered free
relief," O'Connor said
Despite posting disappointing
finishes in its last two tourna
ments, the Cardinal squad plans
on bouncing back in its upcoming
tournaments in April.
"Other teams think we're out
of Icontention], but that's a joke
They'll be taken by surprise when
we beat them next time," Pippin
said.
