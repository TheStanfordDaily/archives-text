# Fencers dominate Western Regional
## 
### James Greene Ben Hur 
The Cardinal men's and women's fencing team
went to Caltech over the weekend for the NCAA
Western Regionals. They had one purpose— to win
— and indeed they did.
"This time, it was total domination," said former
Alaskan tate fencing champion Fritz Schlereth, a
freshman.
The Cardinal men'B squad faced up against Cal
tech, UC-San Diego, Cal State-Fullerton and Air
Force in its final competition before nationals
March 20-24. Stanford's only real rivals were the

Falcons, but the Cardinal was cool with confidence,
undaunted even when the Academy fencers entered
the competition site wearing sunglasses. The Cardi
nal men made no such pretense and went on to win
the tournament handily without any gimmicks.
Stanford's men dominated the tournament by
winning seven out of the possible nine fencing
medals. The Cardinal swept the foil and epee com
petitions and took first in the sabre event. The only
other team to score was Air Force, pulling out sec
ond- and third-place finishes in the sabre competi
tion.
The prizes for winning the
individual weapon events are
three rotating trophies — an
antique foil, epee and sabre. For
the first time, the Cardinal men
brought all three back to the
Farm, now proudly on display in
the Roble Sword Masters'
Lounge. Unfortunately, the team
cannot yet display the sabre tro
phy as Air Force, who won the
event last year, was too confident
to bring it. The Falcons weren't
expecting the outstanding perfor
mance by Stanford's best in the
sabre, sophomore James Chung.
The Cardinal men also had
some other outstanding individu
al performances. Freshman Alex
Woods and sophomores Tim
Chang and Josh Stauffer took
first, second and third, respec
tively, in the foil. Former
Olympian Sean McClain (a
junior), sophomore Alden Clark
and sophomore Rich Hong simi
larly swept the epee. Based on
their performances this weekend,
and on their records throughout
the year, Chung, Woods, Chang,
McClain and Clark will all go to
the fencing nationals in Colorado,

hosted by Air Force. Junior Sasha
Zucker, a sabre specialist, may
also find a spot on the national
team.
The Stanford women also per
formed well at the regional cham
pionships, finishing third overall.
Stanford's freshman sensation
Monique Deßruin won first place
in the foil event, ending a remark
able regular season in which she
finished an amazing 53-0.
Junior Mary Barsanti finished
first in the epee competition for
the Card, while sophomore Lau
rne O'Brian earned second place
honors. Deßruin, Barsanti and
O'Brian are all expected to com
pete at the NCAA tournament.
"It was awesome, everybody
did very well," Barsanti said. "I
think we will be ready for NCAAs.
I think everybody will be able to
keep up the competition."
The regionals marked a tri
umphant return for Barsanti,
who competed for the first time in
a month after injuring her back.
"I was really nervous,"
Barsanti said. "I think the
women's team exceeded its expec
tations. "
However, the team was not
surprised by its performance.
Head coach and two-time
Olympic coach Zoran Tulum
expected the win. Weeks ago he

predicted that the team would
clean up at Caltech.
"We knew we were going to
win," said freshman fencer Yung
Liu.
Already having secured the
overall win, members of the men's
team took the last bouts of the day
less seriously. During the last epee
bout, Cardinal fencers McClain
and Clark faced off for first and
second place. McClain took advan
tage of the more relaxed bout to
test out some new techniques.
"Sean ninnied like a horse and
just charged at Alden," Schlereth
said. With his distinct flair,
McClain scored the final point
over Clark to win the bout and
claim top honors.
McClain and Clark will have
other opportunities to face off
when they compete at nationals
in Colorado. However, there will
be no room for hilarity among the
men and women who qualified.
Stanford is the only powerful
West Coast school competing in a
sport traditionally dominated by
Easi Coast institutions, so the
third-ranked Cardinal will have
its work cut out.
"The team fenced excellent
overall," Tulum said. "We domi
nated the West Coast and expect
to do the same at the national
championship."
