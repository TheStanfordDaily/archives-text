# Fencers dominate Western Regional

The Cardinal men's and women's fencing team
went to Caltech over the weekend for the NCAA
Western Regionals. They had one purpose— to win
— and indeed they did.
"This time, it was total domination," said former
Alaskan tate fencing champion Fritz Schlereth, a
freshman.
The Cardinal men'B squad faced up against Cal
tech, UC-San Diego, Cal State-Fullerton and Air
Force in its final competition before nationals
March 20-24. Stanford's only real rivals were the

Falcons, but the Cardinal was cool with confidence,
undaunted even when the Academy fencers entered
the competition site wearing sunglasses. The Cardi
nal men made no such pretense and went on to win
the tournament handily without any gimmicks.
Stanford's men dominated the tournament by
winning seven out of the possible nine fencing
medals. The Cardinal swept the foil and epee com
petitions and took first in the sabre event. The only
other team to score was Air Force, pulling out sec
ond- and third-place finishes in the sabre competi
tion.
