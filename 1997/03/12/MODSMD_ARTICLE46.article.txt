Four Stanford wrestlers will head
to Northern lowa for the NCAA
Championships March 20-22. After
qualifying with solid performances
at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships the first weekend of
March, redshirt freshman Zach Zim
merer, sophomore Beau Weiner,
junior Scott Chapman and senior
Bryan Vaniman look to finish in the
top eight and bring back Ail-Ameri
can honors for the Cardinal
Zimmerer currently has a 22-16
record after his fourth-place finish at
Pac-lOs. The redshirt freshman
began the season slowly by losing
several of his early season matches
but picked it up midseason and has
continued to wrestle nearly mistake
free.
Prior to Pac-lOs, Zimmerer
placed third in the Aggie Open at
UC-Davis and second at the All-Cal
ifornia Invitational. Although Zim
merer is not a favorite to place with
in the top eight nationally at 126
pounds, he has displayed the talent
and intensity necessary to win Ail-
American honors.
Zimmerer hails from Billings,
Mont., where he collected three state
wrestling titles. He was a second
and seventh-place finisher in the

national junior Greco-Roman
wrestling championships in high
school.
"Although Zach is definitely a
dark horse, I still think he could slip
in and qualify," said coach Chris
Horpel.
Several dramatic performances
in one of the toughest weight classes
in the conference paved the way for
Weiner's qualifying for NCAAs. Ear
lier in the season, Weiner placed
fourth at the All-Cal Invitational
However, he has wrestled in only 22
matches and has a 13-9 record.
Fierce competition with teammate
freshman Warren McPherson
accounts for his low match total. He
holds a 3-2 edge in challenge match
es against McPherson and conse
quently got the nod for Pac-lOs.
"One of Beau's biggest obstacles
this season was just making our
team," Horpel said.
A native of Placerville, Calif.,
Weiner began his collegiate career at
UC-Davis but transferred to Stan
ford after his freshman year. As a
true freshman at UC-Davis, he
placed fifth at Pac-lOs.
Stanford's best chance for an Ail-
American is probably Chapman (36-
8), who has been ranked near or in
the top 10 in the nation throughout

the season. Before finishing third
at Pac-lOs, Chapman earned
third place at the Southern Ore
gon Open, at the Midlands Tour
ney at Northwestern and at the
All-Cal Invitational. He was a
champion at the Aggie Open.
Chapman is from Twin Peaks,
Calif., where he became one of
only seven wrestlers to win three
consecutive state titles. He is one
of the team's co-captains.

In order for him to win Ail-
American honors, "Scott will
have to be on; he'll have to get a
few upsets and put on a few good
performances," Horpel said.
Vaniman, a four-year starter
and team co-captain, has one last
chance to become an All-American.
After taking fourth at the Pac-lOs,
Vaniman now has a 15-7 record.
Although he missed the last
six weeks of the season before
Pac-lOs due to a broken index
finger, Vaniman finished third in
the Southern Oregon Open and
second in the Aggie Open earlier
in the season.

"I would say that Bryan is
probably the most improved
wrestler on the team over the past
few years," Horpel said. "He is also
the best student on the team. He
has only gotten one Band has a 3.9
GPA."
Horpel has high hopes for the
fate of his four wrestlers.
"We are sending four out
standing individuals to NCAAs
this year," Horpel said. "If you're
good enough to qualify, you're
good enough to be an All-Ameri
can. If we can win some close ones
and pull some upsets, I think we
can surprise some people."
