## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's gym
naststics team stepped it up anoth
er notch in its last regular meet of
the season against No. 4 Utah on
Friday. The Stanford squad, com
peting in front of more than 10,000
Utah fans, marked a team total of
196.8 points, the highest score set
in Stanford history as well as the
best score marked by a visiting
team in the Huntsman Center.
"I'm super-impressed with how
they handled themselves and just
really excited about the meet," Izzi
said. "It was pretty incredible; the
girls looked very determined —
they looked like what people would
call 'veteran performers.' "
Although the No. 4 Utes won
the meet with 197.925 points —
the highest in U.S. collegiate gym
nastics this season — the Stanford
team put up a strong fight, hitting
aUi24 rouiuuaG on-all four events.
"We went in there and decided
we were going to do as best as we
could," said junior co-captain Keri
Monahan.
Annie Thananopavarn, who
executed strong rotuines on the
vault for a high score of 9.875, said
she enjoyed the huge audience of
friendly Utah fans, adding that the
competition was just "really fun."
"There was so much more hype,
and we dealt with it really well,"
the freshman said. "We fought for
everything, were really confident,
and I think the Utah fans were
impressed by that."
Thananopavarn added that
although, she was impressed with
the Utes' good form, the best part
about the meet was discovering
that it was not going to be hard to
level with the Utes in the future.
"We didn't even have our best
meet, and that's just very encour
aging," she said.
Monahan agreed, adding that
the Card found a to key success
going into the Pacific Conference
Championship in two weeks as
well as the postseason meets next
month.
"For us to be scoring this high
at this point in the season — espe

cially against a team like Utah — is
definitely a huge confidence boost
er," Monahan said. "It gave us a
flavor of what the postseason
meets are going to be like."
Monahan said that one of the
goals the Card set going into the
meet was to score above a 49.0 (out
of possible 50) on every event as a
team.
The Card had already accom
plished this on the vault and floor
earlier in the season but had not
been able to do so on its weaker
events, the beam and bars.
However, the Card elevated to a
higher level Friday as each mem
ber "pushed through little mis
takes and remained focused and
consistent," according to Mona
han.
Stanford put up five all-around
gymnasts for the meet, all of
whom scored above 39.0 out of
40.0 possible points. Marking an
amazing 39. 425 total points,
sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami and freshman Larissa
Fontaine tied for third place in the
all-around category bfehind Utes
gymnasts Traci Sommer and
Angie Leonard.
While every member contribut
ed to the team's high achievement,
Murakami and Fontaine's 9.9 per
formance on the difficult beam
pulled the team through, while
Monahan marked a 9.8 with a
flawless routine and sophomore
Tracey Kohl's 9.825 and junior
Amy Neil's high score of 9.725
brought the Card to a total of
49.13 points on the apparatus,
allowing the squad to break the
49.0 barrier for the first time this
season.
The Card also sailed through
the bars event, which some gym
nasts have occasionally had to
accept tight scores due to problems
on release movements.
While Murakami and Fontaine
marked highs of 9.95 and 9.5
respectively, Fitzpatrick and Neil
both scored 9.8s with strong flow
ing routines. Together with Kohl's
achievement of 9.725, the Card
tallied 49.2 for the apparatus,
again meeting the 49.0 goal it set
the week of the competition.
