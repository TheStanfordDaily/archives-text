# Women's gym tumbles against best at Pac-10s
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
After two month of intense
weekly meetings with the
nation's top teams, the Stan
ford gymnastics team (6-6.) will
face the big challenge of the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships. The Cardinal squad
will go up against six presti
gious teams the first Saturday
of spring break, on March 22 in
Tucson, Ariz.
The Pac-10 region, housing
top-notch teams such as No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 Alabama
which took the national title
last year, is the toughest con
ference in the nation. Other
teams the Card will challenge
include No. 4 UYah, No. 8 Ari
zona, No. 10 Arizona State, No.
12 Oregon State, Washington
and California.
According to head coach
Lisa Izzi, any team is physical
ly capable of coming out on top.
"There's a lot of good teams
out there, and we're just one of
them," Izzi said. "It's just a big
mental game."
As the postseason progress
es, the scores inevitablv get
tighter and tighter, and Izzi
said there will be too many tal
ented gymnasts at Pac-lOs that
will hit all her routines, mak
ing it even more difficult for
the judges to give high scores
to every strong showing.
Izzi said she hopes the Card
will score between the mid
-1948 to the mid-195s at the big
meet.
"It'll come down to little
things like who has the
straightest legs and the point
ed toes," Izzi added. To make
this possible, the squad needs
added spunk — be it dancing

skills or style — that would set
the Stanford team apart from
the rest. Izzi said.
Although the Cardinal pro
duced high scores and reset
school records throughout the
season, teammates agree that
there is still more room for
improvement.
"We haven't quite put it
altogether yet," sophomore
Katie Fitzpatrick said. "But
once we do, our performance
can definitely go up." Fitz
patrick added that that magic
could happen in "any one of
our meets in the future." After
the Pac-iOs, the Card is sched
uled to compete in NCAA
Regionals and Nationals, anc?
then go on to the NCAA "Super
Six" National Team Finals
next month.'
Junior co-captain Keri Mon
ahan said having been able to
pull together in last weekend's
meet against Utah is going to
help the Card focus and pull
through the tough Pac-10 com
petition. In the meet at the
Utes massive arena, the Card
set its seasonal record of 196.8
total team points. The new
record shattered the squad's
previous record of 195.75 — set
just four weeks ago — by more!
than a point.
"We didn't let the competi
tion setting shake us up at all,',
which is good because that's
how it's going to be" at the!
upcoming meets, Monahan
said.
While Izzi said the Cardinal!
line-up for the Pac-10 meet will;
be officially set after two more
weeks of practice, the Cardinal!
squad has gone through the
season long enough to see "who!
■enough to see "who can score
high where and be consistent" in
what events, according to fresh
v man Annie Thananopavarn.
"Maybe there will be a few
> changes here and there,"
" Thananopavarn said. "But we're

all just going to train really hard,
do our best and see what hap
pens."
Thananopavarn, who will be
taking CIV finals in Arizona
along with four other freshman
on the team, added that she
thinks having a week off of com
petition is going to be "really
beneficial" and will further psy
che the Card up for the Pac 10
Championships.
