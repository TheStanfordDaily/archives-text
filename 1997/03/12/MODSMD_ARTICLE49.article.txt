# Struggling with another injury
## Men win at home, prepare for MPSFs 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Most people don't profess to
knowing the secret of life, but
men's gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada has a theory, at least
where gymnastics is concerned.
"Life is struggle. As long as you
continue to struggle, eventually you
will have a better life," Hamada
says.
The struggle for the men's gym
nastics team goes back to last sea

son when the team recouped from
an injury to one of its top men, to go
from being counted out to being the
top-ranked team after the first
round of the NCAA Champi
onships.
The Cardinal came away from
the final round as the third-best
team in the nation, an amazing feat
considering that many observers
felt that Stanford could not
rebound to make a run.
But third place is never good
enough for the Stanford team

which taken home a national
championship in three of the last
five years.
Although the men ended List
year's season disappointed aijd
defeated, entering this season with
the desire to prove that they are In
fact the best team in the nation.
Now, a new struggle has hit the
Cardinal. Another of its top tnfcn
ha« been sidelined due to injuries,
and again the team is faced with
naysayers and obstacles that it
must overcome.
And once again, the Stanford
team will continue to struggle afid
show that it can emerge from the
rubble stronger than before.
The team took the first step in
doing so Saturday at Burnham
Pavilion, posting its highest score
ever 0228.90>, without senior all
arounder Jamie Ellis.
Ellis injured his shoulder two
weeks ago, and his return to the
team is questionable. Ellis will defi
nitely not see action as a collegvite
all-arounder ever again and his
appearance in other events depends
on the risk involved.
"The team reidlv needs his high
bar and parallel bar routines very
badly," llamada said. "I've got a
definite plan for a worst case see-

nario — that Jamie doesn't do any
events. But, I've seen so many
injured athletes come back; we've
been trained to do things like this.
But riskier injuries I never sacri
fice for routines."
After a mediocre showing at Cal
ifornia the night before, Saturday's
meet against UC-Santa Barbara
proved that the Cardinal can still
achieve its goals.
On Friday at Cal, Stanford post
ed a score 0f226.45 while the Bears
outdid themselves with a 233.4.
"We scored 226.45, which isn't
bad. I guess we were a little tired,
and we just wanted to get through
the competition," said junior co
captain Clarence Miao. "I thought
we did well as a team on Friday and
even better on Saturday. The mis
takes we made on Friday were
fresh on our mind, and we were

able to correct them the next day."
Saturday's competition saw a
marked improvement for the Car
dinal, as the team racked up sea
son-high scores on the parallel
bars. Stanford scored 38.4 on the
event, an average of 9.6 on the
event. Additionally, the Card post
ed phenomenal scores on vault,
averaging 9.73.
"We were very focused last
night, and I think that takes a lot of
strength emotionally and physical
ly," Miao said.
All three all-arounders had solid
nights for Stanford. Senior Keith
Wiley tallied 57.5 overall, highlight
ed by a 9.8 on the parallel bars.
Freshman Jason Katsampes put
up 56.2, while sophomore Scott
Finkelstein showed outstanding
progress with a 56.2.
However, there is still room for
improvement. Rings remain a
problem for as scores continue to
hover around the low nines.
The team will host again Satur
day night when Army, San Jose
State and Oklahoma pay Burn ham

Pavilion a visit. Although the Spar
tans and Cadets should be relative
ly easy to beat, the Sooners have
topped Stanford already this season.
At the Santa Barbara Invita
tional March 1, Oklahoma took sec
ond place in the competition, best
ing the Cardinal by almost five
points. Stanford scored 224.15 in
its first outing without Ellis, and
Oklahoma scored 229.48.
Nonetheless, with the Cardi
nal's record of steady improve
ment, a win against Oklahoma at
home does not seem unlikely.
On March 28 and 29, Stanford
will also compete at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation competi
tion in Lincoln, Neb. The tourna
ment will only serve as another
practice for the Cardinal as they
look toward NCAAs.
"MPSFs are just another meet
— I don't care if we finish last,"
Hamada said. His focus remains on
getting to the NCAA Champi
onships, and MPSFs, for that pur
pose, serve just as another measure
of progress.
