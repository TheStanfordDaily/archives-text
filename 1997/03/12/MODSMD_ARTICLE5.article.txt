# Profs offer views on math reform
## New 50 series signifies departure from nationwide project to change calculus 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Two quarters after changes in
the University's calculus instruc
tion caused a prominent professor
to leave the Mathematics Depart
ment, professors are offering cau
tiously optimistic views of the re
sults.
This marks the first year the
department has offered the new
50 series in multivariable calcu
lus. The series consists of three
five-unit courses, Math 51, 52 and
53. These are equivalent to Math
43,44, 103 and 130.
The new series combines multi
variable calculus with linear alge
bra and differential equations.
The first quarter of the series
was taught by Math Prof. Ralph
Cohen. He called it "a good, chal
lenging course" and said his 300
students "rose to the challenge."
He also noted that enrollments for
winter quarter showed an in
crease in freshmen continuing
with math after their first quar
ter.
The changes have been por
trayed in the academic press as
turning back from a nationwide
project to reform the teaching of

calculus, although many profes
sors in the department reject that
analysis as simplistic.
A keÂ«rfigure both in the current
debate and the national move
ment to reform calculus is Math
Prof. Brad Osgood, who recently
left the department over the issue.
Osgood said the department
has "repudiated all the changes"
he made, so he "cannot work effec
tively in the department any
more."
Osgood said he hopes to contin
ue teaching mathematics at Stan
ford. but as part of the new Sci
ence Core instead. He did not
comment on any specific academ
ic differences he had with the
changes.
Assoc. Math Prof. Rafe Mazzeo
characterized the "reform" calcu
lus movement as an attempt to
correct an undue emphasis on
"routine cookbook exercises" that
did not give students an adequate
explanation of what the problems
meant.
While he praised the textbooks
that have emerged from the pro
gram for emphasizing conceptual
thought, he said they had some-
