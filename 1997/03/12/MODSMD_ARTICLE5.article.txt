# Profs offer views on math reform
## New 50 series signifies departure from nationwide project to change calculus 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Two quarters after changes in
the University's calculus instruc
tion caused a prominent professor
to leave the Mathematics Depart
ment, professors are offering cau
tiously optimistic views of the re
sults.
This marks the first year the
department has offered the new
50 series in multivariable calcu
lus. The series consists of three
five-unit courses, Math 51, 52 and
53. These are equivalent to Math
43,44, 103 and 130.
The new series combines multi
variable calculus with linear alge
bra and differential equations.
The first quarter of the series
was taught by Math Prof. Ralph
Cohen. He called it "a good, chal
lenging course" and said his 300
students "rose to the challenge."
He also noted that enrollments for
winter quarter showed an in
crease in freshmen continuing
with math after their first quar
ter.
The changes have been por
trayed in the academic press as
turning back from a nationwide
project to reform the teaching of

calculus, although many profes
sors in the department reject that
analysis as simplistic.
A ke«rfigure both in the current
debate and the national move
ment to reform calculus is Math
Prof. Brad Osgood, who recently
left the department over the issue.
Osgood said the department
has "repudiated all the changes"
he made, so he "cannot work effec
tively in the department any
more."
Osgood said he hopes to contin
ue teaching mathematics at Stan
ford. but as part of the new Sci
ence Core instead. He did not
comment on any specific academ
ic differences he had with the
changes.
Assoc. Math Prof. Rafe Mazzeo
characterized the "reform" calcu
lus movement as an attempt to
correct an undue emphasis on
"routine cookbook exercises" that
did not give students an adequate
explanation of what the problems
meant.
While he praised the textbooks
that have emerged from the pro
gram for emphasizing conceptual
thought, he said they had some-
what overcompensated at the ex
pense of certain computational
skills, and that some of their at
tempts to give applications in en
gineering or science settings were
too superficial.
In addition to changes in the
multivariable curriculum, the de
partment has decided to stop
using a textbook for the 40 series
— single-variable calculus — that

was brought out as part of the re
form project and was co-authored
by Osgood.
Math Prof. Gunnar Carlsson,
the department's chair, cautioned
against looking at the changes as a
" 'reform' vs. 'traditional' di
chotomy." He noted that several
of the textbooks being considered
as replacements worked from a re
form perspective.
He also said the integration of
linear algebra and differential
equations was designed to help
economics, natural science and
engineering students, for whom

the series is primarily designed.
Math and physics majors are like
ly to take the more rigorous 51H
series, which is not undergoing
any similar changes.
David Starrett, chair of the
Economics Department, called
the new additions to the course "a
good marriage from our point of
view," although he said he had not
yet been able to assess it in opera
tion.
Starrett was consulted in re
working the curriculum, which
Cohen called "the Stanford educa
tional process at its best."

Carlsson did not comment on
Osgood's departure but said his
department had arrived at a "very
strong" consensus about the
changes.
Many faculty criticized press
coverage of changes in calculus
teaching that are going on nation
wide, calling it "superficial" and
"sensationalist."
"I think the question is blown
out of all reasonable proportion,"
Said Math Prof. Yakov Eliashberg,
"It's extremely unfortunate that
some people portray this as a
fight."
