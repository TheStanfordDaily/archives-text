# Track races in Invite
## 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field team will be busy
preparing for the rest of the outdoor season over the
break.
First up for the squad will be the Stanford Invita
tional, which takes place the weekend after final exams
March 22-23. The Invitational, although not a scored
team meet, is nevertheless a big event which will draw
over 75 universities and many Olympians to Angell
Field. Schools such as Kentucky, USC, Notre Dame,
Purdue, California, Georgetown, Arkansas and Wiscon
sin are all expected to attend, bringing with them a high
ly talented pool of athletes.
"This is a very big meet for us,* said coach Vin
Lananna. "Not only are a lot of big schools going to be
here but also a lot of gold medal
ists."
Because of the nature of the
meet, however, it will be primarily
an opportunity for athletes to hone
their skills and put them on dis
play.
Up next for the Cardinal, a week
after the Invitational will be a three
way meet against Oregon and UC-
Irvine at home March 28-29. This
meet is especially important, not
just because Oregon is a very good
team but also because of the compe
tition within the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. As a result, the outcome will
be crucial for the team overall.
"Oregon is a really good team,

and they've beaten us in the past so
this will probably be one of those
meets where we'll have to scratch
and claw for every point," said
junior decathlete Josh Gleason,
one of the team captains.
After those two meets, Stanford
will face another tough Pac-10
rival, Cal, on May 3 at home. In
past years, Cal has been very
strong and has won easily, but
more recently, Stanford has closed
the gap.
"This meet will also be a big
focus for us, especially since we've
gotten a lot better now and are a
very strong team," Gleason said.
Within the Pac-10, other
schools that Stanford will be facing
competition from are USC, UCLA,
Washington and Washington
State. Beyond that, the team's
objectives are fairly clear cut.

"Our goal is to qualify (the
maximum) 24 athletes on each
side for the Pac-10 Champi
onships, the largest ever,"
Lananna said. "Previously, the
biggest group we had was seven
people on both the men's and
women's side, so we're looking to
at least double that."
In addition, the team hopes to
work on its traditional strengths,
the distances and middle dis
tances, and shore up some of its
weaker areas â€” the jumping and
sprints. Overall, however, many
are optimistic about the possibili
ties that lie ahead for the outdoor
season.
"We're a team that can do some
thing really impressive," said
senior distance runner Rob Reed
er. "Nationals will be very excit
ing."
