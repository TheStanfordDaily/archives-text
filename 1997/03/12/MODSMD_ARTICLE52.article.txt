# Men's tennis rolls over Weenies and SMU
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
Although three of its six starters are fresh
men, such young talent has only been an
asset to the Stanford men's tennis squad,
which now boasts an 11-1 record to go along
with its No. 6 ranking.
This week was no exception to the Card's
usual superior tennis, as Stanford rolled over
SMU Friday and California Saturday by a
score of 7-0 both days.
Sophomore Ryan Wolters, currently the
17th-ranked player in the nation, came from
behind, as he defeated 13th-ranked Ignacio
Hirigoyen in three sets 5-7, 6-2, 6-2. At the
No. 2 and No. 3 positions junior Paul Gold
stein and freshman Bob Bryan easily dis
posed of SMU's Freddy Hanser and Vikram
Venkataraghavan. Goldstein won 6-2, 6-3,
and Bob Bryan won 6-3, 6-1.
"I felt like I played well today," Bob Bryan
said. "SMU is a tough team, and we looked
good."
His twin brother, Mike, had little trouble at
the No. 4 position for the Card, dropping only
one game to SMU's Gerardo Mulas 6-1, 6-0.
Rounding out the singles play for the Card
was freshman Geoff Abrams and senior
Grant Elliott. Abrams defeated Toby Hans
son 6-4, 6-4, and Elliott cruised past Tim
Radogna 6-1, 6-1.
In the doubles, the Cardinal took all three
matches easily. Goldstein and Wolters

cruised past Venkaraghavan and Hansson 8-
2. The Bryans defeated Radogna and
Hirigoyen 8-4, while Elliott and Abrams
crushed Keith Pollak and Dustin Mauck 8-1.
On Saturday, the Cardinal traveled to
Berkeley and had equal success with the Wee
nies, crushing them in singles.
At the No. 1 position, Wolters breezed by
the Bears' Alex Sueur 6-2, 6-0. Goldstein
fought a close battle in the second set, defeat
ing Chris Santoso in two sets 6-3, 7-6.
The three freshmen had little trouble with
the Bears at the third, fourth and fifth sin
gles spots. Bob Bryan defeated Nathan Jack
son 6-3, 6-0, while Mike Bryan easily dis
posed of David Sutton 6-1, 6-4 and Abrams
cruised past Minh Le 6-2, 6-3. Rounding out
the lineup for the Cardinal, senior Elliott
took out Cal's Bryan Fernando 6-4, 6-4.
In doubles, the Cardinal lost a close match
but managed to still take the doubles point by
breezing by the Bears at the No. 2 and No. 3
doubles positions. At the top spot, Goldstein
and Wolters fell to Sutton and Santoso 9-8 (7-
5) in a tie-breaker.
In other doubles, Bryan and Bryan easily
defeated Sueur and Le 8-2, while Elliott and
Abrams handled Jackson and Fernando 8-6.
After polishing off two more teams before
spring break, the Cardinal appears ready for
the second half of the season, which includes
many highly ranked teams such as USC,
UCLA and Pepperdine. But the young talent
of the Cardinal appears fearless and pre

pared. The freshmen point to the great lead
ership as a reason for their success.
"I love the team aspect of college tennis,"
Abrams said. "It was not like that in the
juniors. The guys are like brothers to me, and
the older ones are real leaders. Paul is helping
me with my volleys."
Goldstein could be a good volley coach for
most collegiate players. In the new Rolex
rankings, he is seventh in the nation. But
Goldstein says he cannot take the credit.
"I think it really starts at the top with the
coaches — (Dick) Gould and (assistant John)
Whit(linger). Being here two years has really
helped me learn how to be a leader."
Bob Bryan agrees with Abrams.
"Before tennis was so individual; now it is
different," Bryan said. "Paul, Grant and
(Wolters) really lead the way. I love playing
here."
After finals week, the Card will stick
around the Farm for three dual matches at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. The team
kicks off the week March 26, when it takes on
59th-ranked Brigham Young at 11 a.m. On
March 28 and March 29, respectively, the
Card will take on Pacific 10 Conference rivals
Arizona and Arizona State. Both Arizona
teams are ranked in the top 50 nationally.
Last year against the Arizona schools,
Stanford cruised by the Pac-10 competitors,
dropping only one match to Arizona. It
