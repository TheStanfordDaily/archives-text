# Women's tennis cruises, faces Kansas next
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis squad
wrapped up its winter quarter schedule in
impressive fashion, dominating both Washing
ton (6-4) and Washington State (3-6) last week
end at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The No. 2 Cardinal (16-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) rested both the
ill and the injured and still dropped only one
match in the two contests. Stanford defeated
the Huskies 9-0 and beat the Cougars 8-1.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh continued to climb
back into rhythm in singles play for the Cardi
nal after sitting out the majority of the dual
match season with a shoulder injury. Osterloh
won at the No. 2 singles position against Wash
ington State 6-1, 7-5 and cruised to a 6-0, 6-0
win in the No. 1 spot against Washington.
"It went very well," head coach Frank Bren
nan said of the weekend. "The biggest thing is
that we are getting Lilia back in there and get
ting her back. She is healthy, playing well and
getting sharper and more match-tough."
Against the Cougars, senior Katie Schluke
bir returned to the top singles spot — she sat

out Friday's match with a stomach bug — and
bulldozed Washington State's Andrea Reisz 6-
0,6-1. In the No. 3 match, freshman Anne Kre
mer shut out Narelle Hall with a 6-0,6-0 win of
her own.
Senior Sandra De Silva took the first set
with little trouble in the No. 4 match and
spoiled Bindi Thomas' bid to split sets by win
ning the match 6-1, 7-5.
Behind De Silva, freshman Jennifer Heiser
filled in for junior Ania Bleszynski, who has
missed the last three dual matches due to an
inflamed tendon in her ankle. Heiser broke a
tight match open in the second set and earned
a 7-5, 6-0 victory. Washington State's Melissa
Pine grabbed the only Cougar win of the after
noon by defeating junior Heidi Stalla in
straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford swept doubles as Osterloh and
Schlukebir breezed past Reisz and Tunde Nagy
8-2. Kremer and freshman Teryn Ashley, com
peting only in doubles due to knee injury, had
little trouble with Thomas and Pine, winning
8-1. Heiser and senior Emily Burt jumped out
to an early 5-2 lead on Hall and Helen Frank
land and held on for an 8-6 victory.
On Friday against Washington, Brennan

responded to the absence of Bleszynski and
Schlukebir by starting three freshmen in the
top four singles spots. Osterloh and Kremer
both notched straight set wins in the top spots,
while Ashley clinched the dual-match win at
No. 4 against Husky Zuzana Stunova in a tight
three-set match 7-6, 4-6, 6-3.
"They are well into it now," Brennan said.
"The freshmen are doing great. Teryn is play
ing very well, and Lilia and Anne are world
class players. There is always some adjustment
no matter who you are or where you have
played, but I think they are coming along
great."
Junior Julie Scott and Heiser blew past
their Washington opponents in straight sets in
the No. 3 and No. 5 matches, respectively. Burt
battled Erica StolofT, a Northern California
native like Burt, in a three-set match after the
win was a foregone conclusion.
After dropping the second set in a tie-break
er, Burt turned it up a notch in the decisive
third set, earning a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 triumph.
"These matches are a chance to get these
guys some matches," Brennan said. Burt "had a
heroic match. We just don't lilc« to
lose those matches. It didn't mean
anything to us in terms of winning
or losing the match, but we don't
want anyone to see any chinks in
our armor."
Once again, Stanford swept
doubles, with Osterloh and Kre
mer teaming up for an 8-2 win at
No. 1 doubles. Scott and De Silva
.cruised to an 8-4 win in the No. 2
match while Burt and Heiser
added an 8-5 win of their own.
While the rest of the Stanford
student body is off on spring break,
the Cardinal will be hard at work

defending its No. 2 national rank
ing with three matches in three
days. After a home match with No.
20 Kansas March 25, Stanford is
off to Southern California for
meetings with No. 29 San Diego
March 26 and No. 8 Pepperdine
the following day.
The Jayhawks (4-6) come to
Palo Alto without the services of
their top player, Kylie Hunt, a top
three singles player throughout
last season. Hunt has not compet
ed in a dual-match this season due
to iiyury. Kansas posted its biggest
win of the season in a 4-3 victory
over No. 13 Tennessee but has lost
to No. 19 USC and No. 32 Brigham
Young.
The Cardinal has already post
ed a 7-0 win over the Waves (7-4)

in the quarterfinals of the Nation
al Team Indoor Tournament. The
Cardinal earned the doubles point
with wins at No. 2 and No. 3 dou
bles and went on to take five sin
gles matches in straight sets.
Osterloh did not play in the victo
ry-
"We did beat them at Indoors,"
Brennan said. "But they are at
home this time, and they are
always formidable."
With Osterloh back, Brennan is
facing considerable lineup deci
sions. While shuffling the lineup
last week due to injuries to
Bleszynski, Schlukebir and Ashley,
Osterloh played in the No. 1, No. 2
and No. 3 singles spots. Where she
will play is still up in the air.
"I would like to have a lineup set

on the first day of the season,"
Brennan said. "Usually we are not
messing around with the lineup at
this point in the season, but with so
many good players and with the
injuries, you have to patch it up
and mix it up. So we will have to
play some challenge matches and
hopefully have a lineup set by the
first day of spring break.
"But this is what a good team
looks like. You have a lot of good
players and a lot of ultracompeti
tive athletes. So in terms of setting
a lineup, that is what we are deal
ing with and it's great."
Bleszynski and Ashley are both
expected to be healthy for the
upcoming matches. It will mark
the first time all year in which the
Cardinal is at full strength.
