The Stanford women's tennis squad
wrapped up its winter quarter schedule in
impressive fashion, dominating both Washing
ton (6-4) and Washington State (3-6) last week
end at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The No. 2 Cardinal (16-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) rested both the
ill and the injured and still dropped only one
match in the two contests. Stanford defeated
the Huskies 9-0 and beat the Cougars 8-1.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh continued to climb
back into rhythm in singles play for the Cardi
nal after sitting out the majority of the dual
match season with a shoulder injury. Osterloh
won at the No. 2 singles position against Wash
ington State 6-1, 7-5 and cruised to a 6-0, 6-0
win in the No. 1 spot against Washington.
"It went very well," head coach Frank Bren
nan said of the weekend. "The biggest thing is
that we are getting Lilia back in there and get
ting her back. She is healthy, playing well and
getting sharper and more match-tough."
Against the Cougars, senior Katie Schluke
bir returned to the top singles spot — she sat

out Friday's match with a stomach bug — and
bulldozed Washington State's Andrea Reisz 6-
0,6-1. In the No. 3 match, freshman Anne Kre
mer shut out Narelle Hall with a 6-0,6-0 win of
her own.
Senior Sandra De Silva took the first set
with little trouble in the No. 4 match and
spoiled Bindi Thomas' bid to split sets by win
ning the match 6-1, 7-5.
Behind De Silva, freshman Jennifer Heiser
filled in for junior Ania Bleszynski, who has
missed the last three dual matches due to an
inflamed tendon in her ankle. Heiser broke a
tight match open in the second set and earned
a 7-5, 6-0 victory. Washington State's Melissa
Pine grabbed the only Cougar win of the after
noon by defeating junior Heidi Stalla in
straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford swept doubles as Osterloh and
Schlukebir breezed past Reisz and Tunde Nagy
8-2. Kremer and freshman Teryn Ashley, com
peting only in doubles due to knee injury, had
little trouble with Thomas and Pine, winning
8-1. Heiser and senior Emily Burt jumped out
to an early 5-2 lead on Hall and Helen Frank
land and held on for an 8-6 victory.
On Friday against Washington, Brennan

responded to the absence of Bleszynski and
Schlukebir by starting three freshmen in the
top four singles spots. Osterloh and Kremer
both notched straight set wins in the top spots,
while Ashley clinched the dual-match win at
No. 4 against Husky Zuzana Stunova in a tight
three-set match 7-6, 4-6, 6-3.
"They are well into it now," Brennan said.
"The freshmen are doing great. Teryn is play
ing very well, and Lilia and Anne are world
class players. There is always some adjustment
no matter who you are or where you have
played, but I think they are coming along
great."
Junior Julie Scott and Heiser blew past
their Washington opponents in straight sets in
the No. 3 and No. 5 matches, respectively. Burt
battled Erica StolofT, a Northern California
native like Burt, in a three-set match after the
win was a foregone conclusion.
After dropping the second set in a tie-break
er, Burt turned it up a notch in the decisive
third set, earning a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 triumph.
"These matches are a chance to get these
guys some matches," Brennan said. Burt "had a
