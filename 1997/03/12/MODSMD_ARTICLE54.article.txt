## Women's lacrosse shuts out UOP, beats Broncos 
### Esther Pan Staff writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team got its season off to a strong
start with two wins over the
weekend. On Saturday the Card
clobbered Pacific, winning 20-0 at
home.
Attacker Carole Fakhry was a
star, according to coach Kay Cow
perthwait. The junior scored five
goals and assisted on two other
scores. Sophomore Carey Jones
scored three goals and had two
assists, and freshman Hedy Born
added four goals.
"Overall, [UOP] played well,"
Cowperthwait said, "but they're a
new team, and our more experi
enced players overmatched
them."
Stanford won again Sunday,
beating Santa Clara 12-5 in an
away game. Born scored eight
gfoals while goalie Susan Fan, a
senior walk-on, racked up 21
.eaves.
"Santa Clara isn't that
Htrong, but they're better than
UOP. Overall our performance

was rather lackluster, but we
were well balanced on both
ends," said sophomore captain
Alexis Patrizio.
Cowperthwait lauded the play
of Fan, an addition to the team
who along with freshman defend
ers Janet Lewis, Dana Katt.t % r,
Christina Gilyutin and Rachel
Gallager has provided the team
with a solid defensive backbone.
"Susan's been outstanding,"
Cowperthwait said. "She's so
quick and has learned so much in
such a short time it's amazing."
The squad will play Bucknell at
home March 21, then head east
for a tough spring break competi
tion schedule that includes games
against the University of Denver,
Notre Dame, Indiana, George
Mason and Ohio State. Aside
from the opportunity to hone
their basic skills and continue to
jell as a team, the trip should pro
duce some interesting matchups,
as the East Coast programs gen
erally feature stronger and deeper
teams.
"All of [the teams] will provide a
challenge, but we have a really
good shot at winning all our games
over spring break," Patrizio said.
"We hope that our "run and gun
style" will be more effective than
their method of working the ball
around the goal."
