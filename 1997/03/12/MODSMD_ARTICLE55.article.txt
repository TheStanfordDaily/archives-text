## Softball drops 3 of 4, prepares to travel south

The weekend series against eighth
ranked Arizona State and No. 1 Arizona
gave the softball team a better idea of
where it stands among the best teams.
Two close 1-0 games against the Sun Dev
ils that resulted in a split showed that
Stanford (11-14, 1-7 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) is one of the better teams in soft
ball. Yet, the crushing 8-2 and 6-0 losses
that the team suffered from the Wildcats
confirmed that Arizona is still a level
above Stanford and most other teams.
Two weekends ago, the Sun Devils left
the farm with two close wins against
Stanford. Saturday the Cardinal was
looking to settle the score by taking this
weekend's series in Tempe, Ariz.
Game one featured a strong pitching
performance by Becky Blevins. The
sophomore hurler pitched a complete
game and gave up only four hits, two
walks and no runs. Blevins has pitched 13
complete games in 15 appearances, which
is more than any other pitcher in the Pac
-10.
Blevins' solid outing was complement
ed by a strong defensive performance, the
first game this season in which the team
did not commit an error.
The squad also ei\joyed strong hitting

by sophomore shortstop Michelle Schnei
der and sophomore designated hitter
Shane Anderson, as both players went 2-
for-3 in the game. Stanford had eight hits,
but it still had trouble putting up runs.
Fortunately, the squad was able to push
one run across and eke out a 1-0 victory.
In game two Stanford had another
good pitching performance, this time pro
vided by Marcy Crouch. The sophomore
tossed a complete game, giving up six
hits, no walks and only one run. For the
second game in a row the Card had a
strong defensive outing, committing only
one error and giving no unearned runs.
The both games, each squad had trou
ble getting any offensive rhythm estab
lished. In game one, the output was limit
ed, while in game two it was nonexistent,
with Stanford managing only three hits
and putting just four runners on base,
none of whom were converted into runs.
Thus far, Stanford has been the worst
offensive team in the Pac-10 with a team
batting average of .261. The individual
offensive standings are devoid of Stanford
players, with only one player appearing
among the leaders in any of the cate
gories. Sophomore Michelle Acosta is tied
for third in doubles.

is definitely an NCAA power
house. Undefeated and pretty
much unchallenged for most of
the year, Arizona is the consen
sus No. 1 team in the nation.
The Wildcats lead the conference
in both offensive and pitching
team stats, with individuals lit
tering the leaderboards in a
number of categories.
In both games Sunday the
advantage that Arizona has on
paper materialized on the field
as Stanford was beaten soundly
in both games.
In game one, the Wildcats
jumped out to a three-run lead
after the first inning. Arizona
never looked back, scoring four
more runs in the third inning
and eventually beating the Card
8-2. Blevins recorded the loss,
which dropped her season record
to 6-8.
In game two, it was more of
the same. Arizona scored two
runs in the second to take the
lead early and for good, eventu
ally running away 6-0. Crouch's

record went to 5-6 for the sea
son.
The lone bright spot of the
doubleheader was the solid field
ing performance by the Card,
which committed no errors in
either game. Hopefully, Sun
day's series acted as a bench
mark for the players, demon
strating the amount of improve
ment that is necessary over the
next few years if Stanford aims
to contend with a perennial
champion such a3 Arizona.
During the break, softball will
be playing a string of away
games, squaring off first against
Tennessee March 24 in nearby
Cypress, Calif., before heading
south to Cal State-Long Beach,
third-ranked UCLA and Loyola
Marymount in the next three
days. The Cardinal looks to come
out with wins in at least three of
the four series.
The highlight should come
against a very tough Bruinb
squad. Winning the double-head
er should be difficult but by no
means out of reach. Stanford has
already faced the Bruins twice,
dropping a pair of heartbreakers
and leaving the squad anxious
for a rematch.
