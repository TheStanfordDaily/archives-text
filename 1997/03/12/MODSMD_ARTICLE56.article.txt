# Baseball puts on hitting clinic and wins series at Arizona State
## Sluggers score 27 runs and up record to 5-1 in Six-Pac 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
The Stanford Cardinal (18-7,
5-1 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division), entering its second
series of division play, took with
it an impressive streak. Dating
back to last season, the Cardinal
had swept the last four series
against division foes — that's 12
wins in a row against Six-Pac
teams.
In fact, Stanford had swept
four of the five other teams in the
formidable Six-Pac — Arizona,
UCLA and Cal to end last season
and USC to begin this one — and
needed only to beat Arizona State
(15-10, 3-6) in three contests this
weekend to complete the trick.
But after winning the first two
games 11-9 and 10-4, Stanford
dropped Sunday's game 12-8 to
end the streak.
The Cardinal kicked off the
series in fine fashion Friday night
as junior starter Kyle Peterson (4-
1) enjoyed some success against
Sun Devil hitters, allowing them
five runs in the first eight innings.
The Devils got to Peterson quickly
for one in the second and three in
the third, but then the pitcher set
tled down, allowing them to score
only one more run over the next
five innings.
However, the bottom of the
ninth sounded the death knell for
Peterson, who brought an 11-5
lead into the inning. After allow
ing a no-out single, he was
replaced by sophomore lefty Tony
Cogan.
The normally reliable Cogan,
however, proved to be completely
ineffective as he gave up three
straight hits and four runs with
out getting an out. Arizona State
squeezed the lead to a tenuous 11-
9.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
sophomore Jeff Austin, Sunday's
starter, was able to come into the
game and patch up the open
wound, getting three outs and
striking out one to earn his second
career save.
In the second game of the series
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal
won with six runs in the top of the
10th inning that sealed the extra
inning victory 10-4.
Pitcher Chad Hutchinson "was
great. He hasn't had too many
unbelievable performances this
season, but this undoubtedly was
one," Cogan said on KZSU.
Hutchinson, a sophomore starter
breezed his way through the first
eight innings, steering a 4-2 Stan
ford lead down to the bottom of the
ninth.
"This was the best outing of the
year for him," said head coach
Mark Marquess. "He was able to
get out of any trouble he ran into."
Hutchinson entered the bottom
of the ninth inning ready to seal
the game and get his first com
plete game victory of the season,
but the Sun Devils had different
ideas.
After a single and a walk, Ari
zona State had runners on first
and third with two outs. Kevin
Tillman, after swinging and
missing at two consecutive pitch
es, brought the Sun Devils down
to their last strike. But with one
hit, Tillman was able to change
the course of the game, smacking
the 0-2 pitch far down the right
field line and into the corner.

Junior first baseman Dan
McKinley scored immediately
from third. Freshman right field
er Edmund Muth, giving chase at
the ball, ran it down and hurled
it in to try to get Justin Delucchi
at home, but the throw was too
late to get him dashing across the
plate. The Sun Devils had tied
the game at 4-4.
Cogan came into the game to
face Greg Halvorson, who hit a
comebacker to the pitcher to end
the inning. But the last out of the
inning was one batter too late,
and Arizona State had tied the
game and sent it into extra
innings.
But the Cardinal, far from
being demoralized, jumped all
over the Sun Devils in the top of
the 10th to blow the game open.
The first pitch of the 10th was
handled by junior catcher Jon
SchaefTer for a single. After sopho
more center fielder Jody Gerut's
single and a walk by junior Josh
Hochgesang, the bases were load
ed for Muth. With a chance to
break the tie, Muth milked two
consecutive wild pitches from Ari
zona State closer Ryan Bradley
that scored SchaefTer and Gerut
like clockwork, putting the Card
ahead 6-4.
But Stanford was just getting
started. A sacrifice fly by junior
shortstop Jay Pecci and home
runs by junior second baseman
Joe Kilburg and senior left fielder
Chris Clark lofted the score to 10-
4. Cogan (4-1) set down the Devils
in order in the bottom of the 10th
for the win.
"Friday night startled me,"
Cogan said. "I had to come back
and show everybody that I mean
business."
Overall, Marquess thought the
game was a boost for team
morale. "That was a big win. It
was a real uplifting game for us.
They made a few mistakes, and
we were really able to take advan
tage," he said.
Sunday's game, though,
seemed the opposite for the Cardi
nal as few breaks went its way and
Arizona State was able to hand
Stanford a 12-8 loss.
The finale was a tale of frustra
tion. After allowing a leadoff home
run to right fielder Mikel Moreno,
another run in the first and two
more in the second, Austin left the
game trailing 4-2. Sophomore
reliever Brent Hoard came on to
repair the damage, but did little
better himself, giving up an RBI
double to the first batter he faced
to let the Cardinal slip even fur
ther behind, 5-2.
To start the bottom of the fifth.
Hoard loaded the bases with no
outs. The next batter, second
baseman Richy Leon, walked on
five pitches to score another run.
With the bases still loaded, a high
fly to center fielder Gerut was
dropped, allowing two more runs
to score and putting the Sun Dev
ils up 8-2, leaving the game out of
reach for the Cardinal.
The only real fight Stanford put
up was in the ninth, when the
Card scored four runs to cut the
lead to 12-8. But the effort was too
little, too late, and Stanford
dropped the third game.
The game was the last for two
weeks for the Cardinal, as Stan
ford rests next weekend and faces
the California Bears at Sunken
Diamond on March 22.
