During its spring break, the Cardinal baseball
team will play two Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division series against Arizona and California. The
Bears will play at Sunken Diamond March 22 and
Â£4 with a game in Berkeley in between, and Stan
ford will travel to Tucson March 28-30.
While Arizona (19-9, 5-1) and Cal (10-15, 0-6
Six-Pac) are considered the two weakest teams in
the Six Pac, both have already beaten respectable
opponents. The Wildcats jumped out to a 5-0 con
ference start, sweeping Cal in Berkeley, an ' stun
ning then-No. 1 UCLA by taking two out of three.
Cal has knocked off the Santa Clara Broncos 5-2.
Arizona showed it is capable of beating anyone
with 13-3 and 4-2 victories over the Bruins. First
year head coach Jerry Stitt has helped Arizona get
out to its best Six-Pac start ever.
Leading the Wildcat offense is junior Diego Rico.
Rico is batting .440, and the center fielder has a 21-
game hitting streak. Junior shortstop Jake Throw
,er is batting .386, and junior right fielder Colin
Porter in batting .386 with five home runs. The
team has combined for a .345 batting average.
On the mound, sophomore lefty Rob Shabansky
(6-1) boasts a 2.53 ERA for Arizona. Shabansky,
sophomore Darrell Hussman (3-1) and junior
David Quick (4-0) round out the Wildcat starting
rotation.
Cal has had a tougher time in the conference,

coming out to a 0-5 Six Pac start. A very young
team, Cal has 18 freshmen complementing five
seniors, five juniors and eight sophomores. With
such a young team, the Bears will only improve as
the season progresses.
"This team has a chance to sneak up on people,"
said Cal head coach Bob Milano. "We are going to
get better because not only do we have several
young players who have played a lot, but our new
comers are talented."
Golden Bear sophomore shortstop Brian Oliver,
a third-team preseason All-American, was a mem
ber of the freshman All-American team last year.
Oliver leads the Bears with a .379 average, seven
doubles and three triples. The speedster has stolen
12 bases in 13 attempts.
First-team preseason All-American Ryan Drese
is returning from an injury suffered late last sea
son. After nearly pitching a no-hitter last year
(eight hitless innings), Drese hurt his arm two
weeks later.
Senior Drew Fisher (2-3), one of the team's top
relievers for the past three years, has been convert
ed into a starter this year with the emergence of
converted reliever Tyler Walker. Last season, the
Bears shifted Walker, then playing catcher, to the
bullpen. In his first season, Walker had a 3.58 ERA
and ended the season throwing in the low 90s.
After the two conference series, the Cardinal
will play a single game at Nevada March 31. Stan
ford beat the Wolfpack 15-3 when the two teams
faced off earlier this season.
