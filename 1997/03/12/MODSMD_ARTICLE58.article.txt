# Spikers fall to the Bruins, beat Lions
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team returned from this week
end's trip to Southern California
with mixed results as well as a
great sense of disappointment at
letting one slip away.
The squad, which played at
UCLA Friday and then at Loyola
Vlarymount Saturday, suffered a
disheartening 8-15, 15-8, 16-14,
15-13 defeat in the first match yet
came back strong on the following
day and recovered with an easy 15-
5, 15-8, 15-8 win against an over
matched Lions team.
Friday's match was one of the
biggest matches, at least psycho
logically, that the Cardinal will
play all year. The Bruins have
owned college volleyball over the
last 25 years, winning 16 national
crowns, including the last two in a
row. In the process, UCLA has
beaten a number of strong Stan
ford teams, often denying Stanford
postseason play. With this in mind
and wanting to begin the process of
stripping the champs of their
crown, the Cardinal headed into
hostile Pauley Pavilion.
From the outset, it appeared
that Stanford would realize its goal
and send the Bruins packing. The
Cardinal came out strong, as the
team has done in most of its best
matches, taking command of the
match by winning the first game.
The squad was dominant in the
first game, winning easily 15-8.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
this was the high point of the
match. UCLA quickly got back into
it, dispatching the Cardinal in
game two 15-8. Game three started
very promisingly for Stanford,
which got out to a quick 8-1 lead
and eventually led 14-11. After
UCLA got within 14-12, Stanford
had a shot to take the game, but
freshman outside hitter Andy
Witt's swing was blocked by an
outstanding UCLA effort. After
the block, which prevented Stan
ford from getting the final point of
the game, the Bruins rallied, get
ting the next four points for a 16-
14 victory and a 2-1 match lead.
In game four, Stanford stayed
right with the Bruins, but UCLA

prevailed at the end as it broke
away from a tie at 13-13 to win the
game and the match 15-13.
Although Stanford has suffered
other losses this year, the most
recent setback was the toughest.
The team put together an out
standing defensive effort, led by
senior setter Stewart Chong's 21
digs and the blocking of senior out
side hitter Mike Lambert. These
two held UCLA senior outside hit
ter Paul Nihipali, one of the
nation's top players, to .088 hit
ting, and UCLA to a meager .218.
However, Stanford could not get
it going on offense. The entire team
struggled, hitting .198, and Lam
bert, Witt and senior middle block
er Mike Hoefer, normally the
team's most reliable hitters, all had
poor nights. Lambert and Witt,
who are both recovering from ill
ness, hit .063 and .180, respective
ly, while Hoefer, who has been
dominant recently, could only
muster six kills and hit .000 for the
match.
"We had a really bad night
offensively," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "I expect this team
to hit in the high ,300s. Even if we
have an off night, we should be hit
ting in the mid-.2005. Hitting
below .200 for us is not acceptable,
especially when we had such a
good defensive effort."
In addition to poor hitting,
Stanford had trouble with service
receive, getting aced on two of the
three game points and shanking a
serve on the other game point of
the games it lost.
"It is really frustrating for me to
see us receive poorly," Nieves said.
"We have preached service-receive
from the first day of fall practice.
To allow two balls to drop because
we thought they were going out of
bounds, particularly on match
point, is really disappointing. It is a
big mental error."
The lone bright spot for the Car
dinal was the continued outstand
ing play of Chong, who again
played great defensively, as well as
provide strong sets for the rest of
the team. Overall, however, it was a
frustrating evening.
"Our guys are really kicking
themselves right now for letting
this one slip away," Nieves said.

"We missed assignments and
were not as mentally tough as we
needed to be. We should have
beaten UCLA. I know it, the guys
know it, everybody who watched
the match knows it. We are better
than UCLA, but tonight we gave
them too much credit, remember
ing all of the titles and the times
we've lost to them. They had a
mental edge over us before the

match even started."
If the Bruins angered the Cardi
nal, then the Lions of Loyola Mary
mount provided a good target for
the squad's frustrations. Loyola
Marymount, although ranked 15th
nationally, did not present Stan
ford with any great challenge, suc
cumbing in just three quick games.

Games one and two were
close early, but Stanford played
strong in the middle of both
games, capturing them 15-5 and
15-8, respectively. Game three
was never close, as Stanford won
easily 15-8.
The Cardinal's hitting power
returned, sparked by Lambert's
resurgence (16 kills, .625 hit

ting) and the outstanding play of
senior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst.
He racked up 12 kills and no
errors in 16 attempts for .800
hitting in the third game and hit
.515 for the match, leading
Stanford to the win.
"We had a really strong offen
sive night and I thought came
back pretty well after a very dis
appointing match against
UCLA," Nieves said.
"I was happy that Mike
seemed to be feeling better after

Friday, when he was pretty sick.
It was a good way to get back on
track."
While Stanford will not play
the Lions again this season, the
team hopes that it will get
another matchup with UCLA
later in the year in the NCAA
Final Four. If so, revenge would
be sweet.
"Yeah, I have a feeling we'll
see them again," Nieves said. "I
also think that the next time, we
won't want to go away with a
bad taste in our mouths."

mental edge over us before the

match even started."
If the Bruins angered the Cardi
nal, then the Lions of Loyola Mary
mount provided a good target for
the squad's frustrations. Loyola
Marymount, although ranked 15th
nationally, did not present Stan
ford with any great challenge, suc
cumbing in just three quick games.

Senior setter Stewart Chong creates a kill opportunity in last
Wednesday's romp over Loyola.
Games one and two were
close early, but Stanford played
strong in the middle of both
games, capturing them 15-5 and
15-8, respectively. Game three
was never close, as Stanford won
easily 15-8.
The Cardinal's hitting power
returned, sparked by Lambert's
resurgence (16 kills, .625 hit

ting) and the outstanding play of
senior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst.
He racked up 12 kills and no
errors in 16 attempts for .800
hitting in the third game and hit
.515 for the match, leading
Stanford to the win.
"We had a really strong offen
sive night and I thought came
back pretty well after a very dis
appointing match against
UCLA," Nieves said.
"I was happy that Mike
seemed to be feeling better after

Friday, when he was pretty sick.
It was a good way to get back on
track."
While Stanford will not play
the Lions again this season, the
team hopes that it will get
another matchup with UCLA
later in the year in the NCAA
Final Four. If so, revenge would
be sweet.
"Yeah, I have a feeling we'll
see them again," Nieves said. "I
also think that the next time, we
won't want to go away with a
bad taste in our mouths."
