# On the road again
## Volleyball to face Slugs, Pepperdine 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
While the rest of the campus
crams for finals during Dead
Week, sweats it out during finals
week, and then retires to various
beaches for spring break, it will be
business as usual for the Cardinal
men's volleyball team.
The squad, coming off of this
weekend's play, is in pretty good
shape. Ranked third nationally,
the team has a two-game cushion
between itself and second-place
Long Beach State, a team Stanford
has already beaten twice.
Tonight the Cardinal returns
home to the cozy confines of
Burnham Pavilion where it is
undefeated this year. The Ball
State Cardinals (the birds, not the
color) will be Stanford's opponent
in the 7 p.m. match.
Unlike Loyola-Chicago, last
week's Midwestern Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association opponent,
Ball State is a highly touted team.
The Ball State Cardinals, ranked
sixth nationally, are the top team
in the Midwest region, and a mid
season favorite to go to Columbus,
Ohio, for the Final Four. They are
led by senior setter Eduardo Fer
raz, who is as good a setter as any
in the country. Stanford, which is
undefeated in its three matches
against Midwestern teams thus
far, will look to complete a sweep of
the Midwest squads on its schedule
by containing Ferraz.
"One of our goals going into
this season was to beat all four
Midwest teams on our schedule,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We are three-quarters of the way
there, but Ball State is the best of
the four teams, at least record
wise, that we play from back
there. It should be a great match."
After today's match, the team
will conclude its play for the quar
ter against Cal State-Northridge.
The Matadors have struggled this
season, but the team comes off of a
great weekend in Hawaii in which
it got an important league victory
on the Rainbows' home court, pos
sibly the toughest place to play in

NCAA volleyball. The team is
paced by the duo of senior outside
hitters Chad Strickland and Colin
Smith, one of the league's best
swing-hitting tandems. Unlike the
Cardinal, Northridge is in danger
of failing to qualify for the MPSF
tournament and desperately needs
to pick up some wins.
"I think that Northridge needs
to split its matches against us and
UOP this weekend," Nieves said.
"If they lose both, they are pretty
much out of it. Winning both puts
them right back in the mix."
During finals week, the team
will get a respite from practice and
games, but once the week is over,
it has little time to get ready for its
next opponent, UC-Santa Cruz.
The Banana Slugs are another of
the non-league opponents on
Stanford's schedule and should
not provide the Cardinal with
much trouble in the match at
Santa Cruz March 24.
"We scheduled this match so
that we could get our timing back
and get used to playing again
after the week off," Nieves said.
"We want to be ready when we
start league play again that fol
lowing weekend."
The final weekend of break,
Stanford travels to Southern Cal
ifornia to play two MPSF match
es, Thursday at No. 4 Pepperdine
and Friday against the Anteaters
of UC-Irvine.
The Waves' No. 4 ranking
speaks for itself. Much like BYU,
Pepperdine is achieving great suc
cess with the same core of players
as last year but with a year's more
experience. Like Stanford, the
Waves are a very physically talent
ed team and should provide the
Card with a very tough match.
"Pepperdine is a very good
team, somewhat of a surprise to a
lot of people," Nieves said. "They
have got a great setter in (UCLA
transfer) Greg Nelson. He is as
good as any setter in the league and
will be one of those considered for
All-MPSF, along with (Stanford
senior setter) Stewart Chong and
(UCLA freshman setter) Brandon
Taliaferrow. It is amazing to me
that UCLA has so much depth that
a guy like Nelson could sit on the
bench there."
Irvine should be a considerably
easier opponent for Stanford. The
Anteaters are in the cellar in the
Mountain Division of the MPSF and
are a must-win for the Cardinal.
"UCI has taken its lumps this
year," Nieves said. "This is a team
that we really have to get a win
against because it is a team that
everyone else will beat."
Upon returning home, Stanford
will have three days to gear up for
two very important league matches
against the Rainbows, last year's
national runner-up. The April 2-3
matches at Burnham Pavilion,
should be very close. Although
Hawaii is not as strong as it was last
year, the Rainbows are a formidable
threat, and if Stanford doesn't put
in a good performance Hawaii will
have the opportunity to pick up a lot
of ground.
"Hawaii is going to be a tough
team to beat," Nieves said. "I hope
that everyone will come out and
watch some volleyball to kick off the
quarter."
