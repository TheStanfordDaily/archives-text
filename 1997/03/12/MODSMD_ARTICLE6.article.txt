# Students debate expressions for activism

When consumer advocate Ralph Nader
came to speak to Stanford students last quar
ter, the first thing he did was chastise the ca
pacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium:
"You don't have burrs under your saddle,"
he told them. "Once you're into Stanford,
you're on an escalator, not a ladder." The only
encounter with reality you can expect in later
life is when your Mercedes hits a pot hole, he
added.
After the heady days of student activism in
the 19605, commentators in the 1990s have
branded students as greedy, apathetic and un
concerned with higher ideals, according to
Paul Loeb, author of "Generation at a Cross
roads."
Is this bad press for student activists unjus
tified?
A recent national survey of college fresh
men by UCLA's Higher Education Research
Institute suggests otherwise, showing that lev
els of political activism on campus have de
clined from their high points in 1992. The sur

vey echoed 112 ndings of a Daily poll conducted in
November 1996.
But Dean of Students Marc Wais disagreed
with the stereotypical image of student apathy
on Stanford's campus.
"I've been on campuses that are apathetic,
and they're very boring," said Wais, talking
about his career in university administration.
"I've never had a boring day at Stanford. ... I
think that Stanford has a very active student
body."
Senior Leslie Ann Hummel, who coordinat
ed the recent well-attended "Cookies and Tea"
a student-run alternative to President
Casper's "Tea and Cookies"— was similarly
upbeat about student activism.
"There's not an apathetic soul on campus,"
said Hummel, "but there are only a few who
are dedicated to the cause of social justice. ...
Stanford students enact their activism in dif
ferent ways."
Last Monday night, a group of Stanford ac
tivists spent their evening at the Palo Alto city
council meeting, instead of succumbing to the
inevitable flurry of paper deadlines at the end
of quarter.

Doctoral student Matt Bartels. a member of
Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition, is
one of a group of Stanford students who work
with homeless people in Palo Alto to advocate
homeless issues.
"Our activism has been focused around the
sit-lie ordinance," he said, talking about the
law that will ban sitting and lying on certain
downtown sidewalks that was passed by the
city council on Monday night. Bartels said
many students from SHAC who came to the
last public hearing against the sit-lie ordinance
were attending their first city council meeting.
"Activism in the community is one of the
ways you can make a difference, even if you
don't vote here," he said. "There's a lot of ab
stracting going on at Stanford. It's a fairly lib
eral campus, but how useful is it to be an arm
chair liberal? You can get so much more
achieved by going that extra mile off campus."
The passage of the sit-lie ordinance is the
kind of encroachment you read about in an in
troductory political science course, he said.
