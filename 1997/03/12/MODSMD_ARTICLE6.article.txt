# Students debate expressions for activism
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
When consumer advocate Ralph Nader
came to speak to Stanford students last quar
ter, the first thing he did was chastise the ca
pacity crowd in Memorial Auditorium:
"You don't have burrs under your saddle,"
he told them. "Once you're into Stanford,
you're on an escalator, not a ladder." The only
encounter with reality you can expect in later
life is when your Mercedes hits a pot hole, he
added.
After the heady days of student activism in
the 19605, commentators in the 1990s have
branded students as greedy, apathetic and un
concerned with higher ideals, according to
Paul Loeb, author of "Generation at a Cross
roads."
Is this bad press for student activists unjus
tified?
A recent national survey of college fresh
men by UCLA's Higher Education Research
Institute suggests otherwise, showing that lev
els of political activism on campus have de
clined from their high points in 1992. The sur

vey echoed 112 ndings of a Daily poll conducted in
November 1996.
But Dean of Students Marc Wais disagreed
with the stereotypical image of student apathy
on Stanford's campus.
"I've been on campuses that are apathetic,
and they're very boring," said Wais, talking
about his career in university administration.
"I've never had a boring day at Stanford. ... I
think that Stanford has a very active student
body."
Senior Leslie Ann Hummel, who coordinat
ed the recent well-attended "Cookies and Tea"
a student-run alternative to President
Casper's "Tea and Cookies"— was similarly
upbeat about student activism.
"There's not an apathetic soul on campus,"
said Hummel, "but there are only a few who
are dedicated to the cause of social justice. ...
Stanford students enact their activism in dif
ferent ways."
Last Monday night, a group of Stanford ac
tivists spent their evening at the Palo Alto city
council meeting, instead of succumbing to the
inevitable flurry of paper deadlines at the end
of quarter.

Doctoral student Matt Bartels. a member of
Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition, is
one of a group of Stanford students who work
with homeless people in Palo Alto to advocate
homeless issues.
"Our activism has been focused around the
sit-lie ordinance," he said, talking about the
law that will ban sitting and lying on certain
downtown sidewalks that was passed by the
city council on Monday night. Bartels said
many students from SHAC who came to the
last public hearing against the sit-lie ordinance
were attending their first city council meeting.
"Activism in the community is one of the
ways you can make a difference, even if you
don't vote here," he said. "There's a lot of ab
stracting going on at Stanford. It's a fairly lib
eral campus, but how useful is it to be an arm
chair liberal? You can get so much more
achieved by going that extra mile off campus."
The passage of the sit-lie ordinance is the
kind of encroachment you read about in an in
troductory political science course, he said.

political motivation was primarily
a sense of frustration.
"I feel very frustrated about a
lot of things I read about," Wang
said. "It's so easy to become de
tached from what's going on out
side. There are things that you
can't really learn from profes
sors."
She finds it depressing that out
of 9,000 students, only a handful
attend SHAC meetings on a regu
lar basis.
As a response to the real and
perceived flaws in existing campus
movements, students have begun
to look for different ways to voice
social concern, according to author
Paul Loeb. Community service
projects like the Stanford Project
on Nutrition allow students to per
form immediately useful tasks,
like feeding the hungry, without
engaging in direct political action,
which may alienate some students.
More than 80 Spoon volunteers
gather left-over food from campus
kitchens to be delivered to soup
kitchens in Palo Alto and the sur
rounding area.
"Spoon is apolitical," Bartels
said, comparing the work of a com
munity service-based group with
the homeless advocate group,
SHAC. "It's an easy way for stu
dents to get involved and fulfill
their personal needs without leav
ing campus."
Some volunteers become in
volved in the next stage of Spoon's

food cycle by volunteering as
servers at the Urban Ministry's
free meal programs in downtown
Palo Alto. The transition to deal
ing with real people is a rewarding
experience for many, according to
Spoon's Dave Murphy.
Spoon "is a great organiza
tion," Wang said. But homeless
ness "is a much broader issue than
providing food, which is a band
aid solution."
According to the Director of the
Haas Center for Public Service
Tim Stanton, an estimated 3,000
Stanford students are involved in
public service every year.
"We want people to be engaged
and effective citizens at whatever
level they're interested in," Stan
ton said. "Some are going to be in
government, and some are going
to be banging on the door of gov
ernment. That's what makes
democracy work."
"We view activism as an expres
sion of service commitment," he
added. "It's important that stu
dents don't only view problems at
the level of Stanford, but also
learn how these problems affect
individuals. People in public policy
often don't understand grass
roots problems."
Marc Wais agreed that some of
the most powerful statements can
be made through community ser
vice.
According to Wais, Stanford
students can look forward to an
active spring quarter. "Spring
quarter tends to be more active,"
he said. "Issues just happen to
percolate up and bubble through
in the spring."
