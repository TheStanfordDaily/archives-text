### Cordy Crockett 
Everyone knows about
Stanford's successful varsity
teams. However, not very
many people realize that
Stanford has many success
ful club teams as well.
This weekend, the
women's Ultimate Frisbee
team came in first place at
the Stanford Invitational
tournament.
The women not only won
it, but they won it convinc
ingly, defeating UC-Santa
Barbara 19-5 Sunday in the
finals.
On Saturday, Stanford
played Oregon, California,
club team Las Positas and
Colorado. Sunday the Cardi
nal played Humboldt State in
the quarterfinals and UC-
San Diego in the semifinals.
The tournament consisted
of 10 teams from California,
Oregon and Colorado. The
women's B team played as
well, losing 13-10 to the Buf
faloes who blew them out
earlier in the season.
The women's Ultimate
team may very well make
1997 a championship year.
Last year North Carolina-
Wilmington won the tourna
ment, but many of the Sea
hawk players graduated and
it has lost several games this

year. Two years ago Santa
Cruz won, but they have had
to do a lot of rebuilding as
well. Nationals will be held
at UC-Davis.
The success of Stanford's
Ultimate Frisbee team iB due
to a combination of factors.
"This year we're really
determined, and we've made
mistakes in the past which
we're trying to learn from,"
said senior captain Abby
Hoover. She also attributes
their success this year to
great coaching, team chem
istry and players who are
determined, talented and
athletic.
Despite the size and suc
cess of the Ultimate Frisbee
program at Stanford, its
interests are often threat
ened by the interests of var
sity sports. Many members
of the Ultimate team
expressed concern about the
fate ot the IM playing fields,
where much of this week
end's tournament took place.
This field space is currently
being converted to a varsity
field space. The men's and
women's Ultimate Frisbee
teams have almost 100 play
ers between them.
During the weekend after
finals, the men's Ultimate
Frisbee team will head to San
Diego for a club tournament.
"The competition in open
tournaments is a lot tougher
than college tournaments," said
senior team captain Christian
Dodge. But he said he expects
the team to make it to the semi
finals.
Also, since the results of
these tournaments do not count
towards collegiate standings, he
views them as being "mainly
developmental."
The men's team will spend
the week after the San Diego
tournament in Palm Springs for
"something like spring train
ing," Dodge said.
The women's team will con
duct a scrimmage March 28
against Carlton, another team
contending for the women's
national championship this
year.
On March 29 and 30, both
Frisbee teams will travel to
UC-Santa Cruz for the April
Fools tournament. This is a
club tournament characterized
by teams that dress up to play
their matches. In past years,
teams have come dressed in
women's lingerie and surgeon
clothing.
