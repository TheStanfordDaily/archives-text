Everyone knows about
Stanford's successful varsity
teams. However, not very
many people realize that
Stanford has many success
ful club teams as well.
This weekend, the
women's Ultimate Frisbee
team came in first place at
the Stanford Invitational
tournament.
The women not only won
it, but they won it convinc
ingly, defeating UC-Santa
Barbara 19-5 Sunday in the
finals.
On Saturday, Stanford
played Oregon, California,
club team Las Positas and
Colorado. Sunday the Cardi
nal played Humboldt State in
the quarterfinals and UC-
San Diego in the semifinals.
The tournament consisted
of 10 teams from California,
Oregon and Colorado. The
women's B team played as
well, losing 13-10 to the Buf
faloes who blew them out
earlier in the season.
The women's Ultimate
team may very well make
1997 a championship year.

hawk players graduated and
it has lost several games this

year. Two years ago Santa
Cruz won, but they have had
to do a lot of rebuilding as
well. Nationals will be held
at UC-Davis.

"This year we're really
determined, and we've made
mistakes in the past which
we're trying to learn from,"
said senior captain Abby
Hoover. She also attributes
their success this year to
great coaching, team chem
istry and players who are
determined, talented and
athletic.
Despite the size and suc
cess of the Ultimate Frisbee
program at Stanford, its
interests are often threat
ened by the interests of var
sity sports. Many members
of the Ultimate team
expressed concern about the
fate ot the IM playing fields,
where much of this week
end's tournament took place.
This field space is currently
being converted to a varsity
field space. The men's and
women's Ultimate Frisbee
teams have almost 100 play
ers between them.
During the weekend after
finals, the men's Ultimate
