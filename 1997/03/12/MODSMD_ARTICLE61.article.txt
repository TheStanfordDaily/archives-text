### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Traveling to St. Louis for a
16-game tournament, the Stan
ford ice hockey team came
home with a sixth-place finish
at the national championships
March 7-8.
The placing capped off a
great season for the Stanford
squad marked by great team
work and unity.
The Cardinal squad that
went to nationals was incom
plete as two members had var
sity golf commitments and oth
ers also could not make the
trip. Consequently, the out
come was no disappointment
"We were just happy to go to
nationals and actually go and
to perform as well as we did
was something to be proud of.
We didn't go out of St. Louis
hanging our heads," said
sophomore goalie Nick Flores.
Stanford began the tourna
ment with a win against the
top-seeded team in the North
east, Rutgers. Stanford was
seeded third in the West.
Junior goalie Sami Jo Small
was the star of the first game,
shutting out the Pioneers even
though Stanford was outshot
57-11.
"She played magnificently in
that game, and we won 1-0. We
were outshot — she won that
game for us," Flores said.
Sophomore Ben D'Ewart
scored the winning goal for the
Cardinal. "I just pinched down

on a guy on the boards. The
man I pinched down on
coughed up the puck. I had a
clear lane to the net and took a
shot to the low stick side,"
D'Ewart said.
D'Ewart had a great offen
sive series at nationals, scoring
in the first two games and log
ging an assist in the third. On
Saturday, Stanford took on
host Missouri.
The Cardinal bested Mis
souri 4-1. Flores played goalie
during game two and "had a
great game," D'Ewart said.
Later that day, Stanford
played a tough match against
Penn State, losing 8-1. The Nit
tany Lions were the second
seeded team in the South
region, and they eventually
ended up going to the finals.
"They were just a really good
team. They had a lot of depth,
and that was our second game
of the day," Flores said. "They
were just a superior team."
The lone goal of the game
three was by senior Doug Lane,
with an assist from D'Ewart.
"I think everybody was look
ing to finish in the top 10, so a
top-six finish was a big accom
plishment given the fact that
some of the guys didn't make
the trip," Flores said. "We were
kind of depleted — we just
didn't have as much depth as a
lot of teams."
The national championship
went to Life College in Atlanta,
with Penn State coming in sec
ond, 8-2.
