# Rugby men lose to top-ranked Golden Bears, women handily defeat hapless Banana Slugs
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
In a matchup between the top
two teams in the nation, the sec
ond-seeded men's rugby team
fell to its Bay Area rivals Califor
nia 41-24 Sunday.
After a streak of 16 consecu

tive losses to the Bears which
went all the way back to 1979,
the Cardinal was able to capture
the Axe in a 24-21 upset last year.
Its possession of the trophy was
short-lived, as Cal dominated the
tempo of the game and kept the
team scrambling after it.
The Bears jumped out to a

17-0 lead before freshman
Michael Ceballos put the Cardi
nal on the board with a try
about 15 minutes into the first
quarter. The missed conversion
after the try still left the team
trailing 17-5. Cal extended its
lead to a commanding 19 points
by the end of the half.
The Bears dominated the
Cardinal in the first half with
aggressive offense and unre
lenting defense. Stanford's
offense hardly ever got the ball
up field in the period and was
constantly being penetrated by
the Bear defense.
The men did make a game of
it in the second half as they came
out running. They were able to
give the Bears a taste of their
own medicine and bring them
selves within striking distance of
Cal. Junior Shin Inoue scored
the first try of the second half to
make the score 24-12.
A few minutes later, sopho
more Don Donester broke up
field and set up a try by senior
Jason White. The successful con
version after the score brought
the team to within five points.
But the Bears took over once
again and with two tries for a 36-
19 lead, they sealed the victory
for themselves. Donester added
one more try, but the deficit was
still too large to be made up so
late in the game.
"They were unable to imple
ment our game plan, especially
on defense and in the lineup,"
said head coach Franck Boivert.
"On defense we were unable to
disrupt the pace of Cal, which
was our first goal. Even though
we had plenty of opportunities to
put pressure on them, there were
only one or two guys doing it."
The Bears won most of the
lineups, with their jumpers steal
ing away many of the Cardinal's
throw-ins.
The loss means the men will
travel to West Point for the
Regional Playoffs in April. They
will open play against Catholic

University of Washington, D.C.
If they win, the will take on the
winner of the Army-Air Force
match.
During spring break, the
team will travel to Hawaii for a
match against the state's under
-21 All-Stars on March 22. It will
then travel to British Columbia
to take on the University of Vic
toria March 28 and the Univer
sity of British Columbia March
31.
Also Sunday, the women's
team defeated UC-Santa Cruz
40-5. The match was one-sided,
but the women lacked much of
the intensity they had when they
handed the Banana Slugs a 32-0
loss on Feb. 1.
Junior Suzie Hoffmann led
the team by scoring two tries and
converting five kicks, but overall
she felt that the team was not
working together as well as it
had in the past.
"We had a good win today, but
I would have to say that we
weren't working as effectively as
we have," Hoffmann said. "We
weren't really coming together
as a team. I'm not sure what
that's a result of. I know that the
energy and the desire are there
and that we are working hard to
get it, but I'm not sure every
thing's clicked together yet."
Sunday's match gave the
women an opportunity to hone
their skills for the postseason,
but they may not have effective
ly taken advantage of the situa
tion.
"I thought they lacked a lit
tle bit of intensity because they
had beaten UC-Santa Cruz
already," Boivert said. "I think
they took the game a little bit
for granted. It's going to bring
them back to Earth and show
them that there's still a lot of
work to do and that they should
never lose their intensity."
The team will join the men for
the stretch of the tour in British
Columbia before returning next
quarter for the regional playoffs.
