# Qualifying for the playoffs
## Men's lacrosse falls to Sonoma State 19-7 
### Allison Hays 
Despite an impressive sea
son thus far, the men's
lacrosse team (5-5) suffered a
disappointing loss to No. 1 seed
Sonoma State 19-7 Saturday.
A member of Northern
Division I in the Western Colle
giate Lacrosse League, the
Cardinal qualified for the play
offs which will take place in
mid-April. This will mark the
first time in four years that the
team has been eligible for the
playoffs and will herald high
expectations for future sea
sons. Its anticipated opponent
for the playoffs is UC-Santa
Barbara, who the Cardinal
challenged previously in a
tight scoring game.
The team's noteworthy
improvement from last season
is credited in part to the arrival
of the new head coach, Peter
Bijesse, former coach to Cali
fornia's lacrosse team for 15
years where he had an excep
tional track record. Bijesse
attributes this year's success to
the seniors who "are the heart
and soul of the team."
The team got off to a slow
start and only managed to
score one goal in the first half
to Sonoma's seven. Captain
and midfielder, senior Clay
Akiwenzie, ascribes the rela
tively lukewarm performance
in the first half to the "inabili
ty for the team to capitalize on
key opportunities." Although
the team did dominate the ball
for longer in the first half, they
did not score successfully
despite 14 attempts.
Junior Ronald Rhea, a
starting midfielder, was
responsible for the sole goal in
the first half. Rhea, known for
his speed and cunning, out
maneuvered Sonoma's solid
defense and scored with a

push. Rhea said the players, in
general, were exceptional
"physically and skill wise." He
cited problems that day to
"poor execution shooting and !
an inconsistent defense."
In the second half, the team
gained momentum scoring six
goals and taking an all-around
more aggressive approach. The
third period in particular
proved to be a high point of
Saturday's game as the Card
scored four of the seven goals.
Two shots were scored by
sophomore attacker Benton
Williams, both made in aggres
sive offensive plays, and the
other two by midfielders Scott
Green, a sophomore, and Jesse
O'Hanley, a junior.
"There was a lot of energy
out there today which repre
sents a new ethic for the play
ers. They show a lot of r
promise," said senior attacker 1
Geoff Hayden, who is graduat- ■ I
mg this quarter and played his 1;
last game Saturday. Hayden ] ■
was one of the captains for the ■ !
game and played an integral
part in the team's somewhat ;
successful offense. Also inte- •;
gral were captains Guillermo |-
Garcia, Ali Disston and Aki- ■
wenzie, who dominated much !;
of the offensive effort, scoring | ■
two goals in the last period.
Despite these highlights,
the team in general suffered ;■
from both poor shooting and >1
transition defense. Bijesse >
said. He also said these prob
lems are definitely correctable. «;
Junior midfielder Ryan
Page acknowledged that the \
team is slow-starting in games 1
but remained highly opti- ]>
mistic. The next two games are ■;
on the road against Utah State "
and BYU on March 29 and 30. !; i
Stanford challenges UC-Davis >;
