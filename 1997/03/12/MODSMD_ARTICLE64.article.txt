# Men's and women's horse polo prepare for national championship
##

Cardinal polo is confident, and it
should be.
Both the men and women are unde
feated as they head into the Western
Regional finals. A stellar season leaves
the women ranked first regionally and
the men ranked second.
Coach Wes Linfoot said the women
will have no problem at finals where Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo poses the greatest
threat. However the men face top
ranked Washington State and competi
tive UC-Davis. USC and UC-Santa Bar
bara are also top regional contenders.
Linfoot stressed that the teams will
work on penalty shots in preparation
for regionals.
"A big part of the game is won on
penalties," Linfoot said. "If we lose one
| a penalty 1 it means a point for the
other team."
Linfoot, a polo player since 1931, has

been Stanford's coach for nine years.
"I enjoy making good players. This is
their chance to learn," he said. "Then
they can come back again later when
they can afford it."
Under Linfoot, at least one team has
gone to nationals six of the past eight
years. Currently, Stanford polo ranks in
the nation's top five on both the men
and women's ranks.
Although Linfoot wants more play
time from his riders, polo also competes
with school. Western regionals are
March 20-23 in Murieta (near Sacra
mento) — at the tail end of finals week.
The women play Yale Friday, just prior
to exams. The teams spend close to 30
hours per week practicing and caring
for the string of 22 horses, all of which
are donated.
Women's team captain and fiflh-year
senior Ilia Christy said unity and good
communication are key to success in
polo.
"Communication is essential and we

have a lot of trust; we have a lot of
understanding. We can anticipate each
other," Christy said.
Perhaps success is assured also
because her sister, junior Alexa Christy,
plays and served as team captain last
year while her all-star sister was at
Johns Hopkins studying biology.
"There is a tradition in polo of sibling
and family involvement in the strongest
teams. It really helps," said the elder
Christy.
Alexa concurred with her sister's
assessment.
"This is a contact sport, and in colle
giate polo you get on a horse you know
very little about. You have one minute
to warm up and figure (the horse] out.
Communication is extremely impor
tant, and because we are sisters, we just
know each other well and we have that
communication," she said.
The Christys are flanked by veteran
senior Courtney Riggle and alternates
junior Heidi Burel and sophomore

Andrea Avtjoglou.
For the men's team, three is the
lucky number. Fiflh-year seniors Jason
Knight and Jeff Heeder along with
senior and polo club president Adam
Strom form the core squad. They've
played together for three years.
Team captain Knight is confident his
team will prevail and shut out rival UC-
Davis.
"I'm pretty sure we can crush Davis
because frankly, we are really good,"
Knight said.
Knight, a chemical engineering
m/yor, said Heeder talked him into rid
ing lessons when they were roommates
sophomore year.
"I'm not Prince Charles," Knight
said. "I would never have had the
chance to play. They spent a month
teaching me to ride, and once it gets in
your blood, you get addicted. I am
addicted "
Strom, a biology mtyor, also started
playing polo at Stanford as a sophomore

and is optimistic about the season
finale.
Winning regionals and nationals "ia
what we have been working for during
these three years. With a lot of hard
work and dedication, you can do any
thing," Strom said.
However the future after nationals is
more worrisome.
"We have two seniors graduating;,"
Strom said. "We need new men, n<x
experience necessary."
Polo is a fast and aggressive
Victory depends on the agility and skiK
of both horse and rider. X*
"The essence of polo is trying to hit £
grapefruit-size ball with a long croqufet
mount at 35 mph while someone else
tries to run you over," Knight said. ; 1
If both teams qualify for nationals,.
Stanford will try to run over defending
national champion Texas A&M and top
contender Colorado State — the only
teams to beat the men this year. Nation
als are April 6-12 in Burleson, Texas.-
