# Water polo finishes second at Stanford Invite
## Women lose close game to Bruins, beat Golden Bears 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team may have narrowly
missed defeating top-seeded
UCLA twice last weekend, but it
did beat third-ranked California.
"We definitely learned a lot
this weekend," said freshman
Suze Gardner. "The weekend
was very up and down. Different
people stepped up at different
times
The Cardinal's first loss to
the Bruins came Friday 10-9 in
overtime. After trailing 8-3, the
Card came from behind to score
five goals and send the game
into overtime. In the first over
time period, freshman holeset
Ellen Estes recovered a deflec
tion off the keeper and tucked it
into the back of the net to put
Stanford up 9-8. But the second
overtime was all UCLA, as the
Bruins scored twice, with the
first goal off a four-meter shot
and the second by national team
member Coralie Simmons to put
the Bruins on top for good.
The Cardinal then entered
Stanford Invitational play with
an 11-6 defeat of UC-Santa
Barbara Saturday. The Cardi
nal completed its first-round
play and earned a spot in the
semifinals Sunday by trounc
ing Michigan 14-2. Both the
Gauchos and the Wolverines
could do little to hang with the
Card.
Stanford met third-ranked
California in the semifinals Sun
day morning. By the middle of
the third quarter, Stanford had
taken a 4-2 lead. But that lead

quickly dissipated as Cal began
to put up a fight. With two min
utes left in the third quarter the
Golden Bears scored to bring the
game to 4-3. Just seconds into

the fourth quarter Cal found the
net again and tied the game up.

game winner shortly thereafter,
but with 38 seconds left Cal tied
the game up and sent it into over
time. The Cardinal went on top
for good with 1:16 left when
Gardner converted a four-meter
shot.
"Cal is very physical," said
head coach Ben Quittner. "We
will probably go to overtime with
them every game."

This victory put the Cardinal
in the finals where it earned a
rematch against UCLA. Stanford
held the Bruins for almost three
quarters, but after Stanford
scored to take a 4-2 lead late in
the third quarter, it was all Bru
ins. With 38 seconds left in the
third quarter UCLA scored to
pull within one. The Bruins
struck again shortly into the
fourth quarter to take the lead.
UCLA would score twice more to
put the game out of reach for the
Cardinal.
"We were right there. We

know we can beat them," said
Gardner. "We had them for three
quarters; we just need one more."
Stanford will next be in action
at Pacific Saturday. The Cardinal
will then meet Berkeley on its
home turf March 19.
"The crowd at (Cal) is always
big factor but also because we
play lots of freshman," Quittner
said.
Following the game against
Cal, Stanford will be off to
Hawaii where once again the Car
dinal will play Cal along with San
Jose State and Hawaii.
