### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team may have narrowly
missed defeating top-seeded
UCLA twice last weekend, but it
did beat third-ranked California.
"We definitely learned a lot
this weekend," said freshman
Suze Gardner. "The weekend
was very up and down. Different
people stepped up at different
times
The Cardinal's first loss to
the Bruins came Friday 10-9 in
overtime. After trailing 8-3, the
Card came from behind to score
five goals and send the game
into overtime. In the first over
time period, freshman holeset
Ellen Estes recovered a deflec
tion off the keeper and tucked it
into the back of the net to put
Stanford up 9-8. But the second
overtime was all UCLA, as the
Bruins scored twice, with the
first goal off a four-meter shot
and the second by national team
member Coralie Simmons to put
the Bruins on top for good.
The Cardinal then entered
Stanford Invitational play with
an 11-6 defeat of UC-Santa
Barbara Saturday. The Cardi
nal completed its first-round
play and earned a spot in the
semifinals Sunday by trounc
ing Michigan 14-2. Both the
Gauchos and the Wolverines
could do little to hang with the
Card.
Stanford met third-ranked
California in the semifinals Sun
day morning. By the middle of
the third quarter, Stanford had
taken a 4-2 lead. But that lead

quickly dissipated as Cal began
to put up a fight. With two min
utes left in the third quarter the
Golden Bears scored to bring the
game to 4-3. Just seconds into

the fourth quarter Cal found the
net again and tied the game up.
