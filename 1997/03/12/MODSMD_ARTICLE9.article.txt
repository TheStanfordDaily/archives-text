Debt deal will help Vietnam ties
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vietnam's recent
agreement to repay the United States debts
accrued a generation ago will hasten normal eco
nomic relations between the two countries, the
State Department said yesterday.
During negotiations last week in Hanoi, Viet
nam agreed to repay debts incurred by its enemy,
the former South Vietnam.
The United States asked Vietnam to take respon
sibility for about $145 million in debts, but the actu
al sum to be repaid is expected to be much smaller.
"What's significant about it is that it helps pro
pel us down the road to normalization of our eco
nomic relationships," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
"There is significant American commercial
interest in Vietnam," Burns added.
He said the debt involved four Agency for Inter
national Development loans and two food aid loans.
The United States channeled billions of dollars
in assistance to the Saigon government until it fell
to Hanoi's forces in 1975, after which the county
was reunified under Hanoi's rule.
The outstanding military debt owed by South
Vietnam to the United States was not under con
sideration for repayment.

Yeltsin shakes up cabinet
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris Yeltsin
ordered his Cabinet overhauled yesterday, follow
ing through on promises to shake up a government
that has been unable to pull Russia's fledgling mar
ket economy out of its rut.
The newly invigorated Yeltsin, who last week
castigated his government for lying "motionless"
while the economy drifted, only guaranteed the jobs
of two Cabinet members — Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and top deputy Anatoly Chubais.
The Russian government has seemed rudder
less since at least July, when an ailing Yeltsin won
re-election to a second term and then dropped
largely out of sight because of heart trouble and a
bout of pneumonia. Only in recent weeks has he
appeared to be fully back in control.
In the meantime, the economy has stalled on the
difficult road from communism to capitalism. Mil
lions of workers, both in government and private
industry, have gone for months without pay. Taxes
have gone uncollected and public disgust has grown.
In addition to Chernomyrdin, the Cabinet con
sists of 33 ministers and deputy premiers. Govern
ment spokesman Alexander Voznesensky said the
decree also might apply to some of the heads of 19
government committees and 23 federal agencies.
