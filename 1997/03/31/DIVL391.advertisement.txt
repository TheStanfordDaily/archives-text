Humanities Special Programs Announces
A New Course for Spring Quarter
Humanities 150
"Structures of Western Thought"
Mon. & Wed. evening: 7:00-8:15pm
Bldg 260(Language Corner)Rm:l 13
A one-quarter survey of the Western intellectual tradition and how it
compares to other major traditions (China, India) in its conceptions of
logic, time, history, religion, and politics. The one-quarter format allows
the student to examine the tradition as a whole in one course and to study
the relations among major authors and artists within the tradition: the
relation between Aristotle and Dante; between Paul and Dante; between
Dante and Columbus; between Aristotle and Galileo; between Masaccio
and Warhol. We will read selections from Aristotle, Genesis, Luke, Acts,
Cicero, Dante, Leon Battista Alberti, Vespucci, Galileo, Byron, and
Dostoevsky. Weekly reading assignments are not heavy (one exception:
Brothers Knrmimzov ) and it is our hope that this will open the class to
many who already have demanding study schedules. Ihe course is
interdisciplinary: we will study philosophy, religion, poetry (Dante,
Donne, Byron), painting (Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Piero della I rancesca,
Raphael, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Andy Warhol)), sculpture (Donatello)
architecture (Brunelleschi), and fiction. We will use slides extensively.
Units-flexible: 3 units-lecture and final
