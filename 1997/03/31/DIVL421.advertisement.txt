Women Talking About Religion, Anger and Forgiveness
Led by Associate Dean for Religious Life
Kelly Denton-Borhaug
Mondays, April 7-28,6:30-8:00 p.m.
Old Union Clubhouse Common Room
What is the relationship between religious faith, anger and forgiveness?
How do we reconcile the religious call to love one's enemies with the experience
that some things are unforgivable?
What is the role of truthftil judgement, lament and prophetic indictment?
Are suffering ever something in which to rejoice?
Please call or e-mail Kelly if you're interested in participating or if you'd like more information. Any women students, staff and/or
faculty interested in these topics are invited! (Rev. Kelly Denton Borhaug e-mail: kdenton@leland phone: 725-0090)
