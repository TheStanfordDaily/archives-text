# Old Dominion stuns Stanford in OT
## Quest for national title falls short for 3rd-ranked Card 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
CINCINNATI — It was not supposed to end
this way.
Not against Old Dominion. Not with the Nai
smith player of the year on your squad. Not with a
team that had destiny written all over it.
And last, but not least, not with a loss.
But destiny is fleeting sometimes, and when it
proves elusive, stunning things happen. Bad
things happen. Things that appear set in stone get
derailed, much like the third-ranked Stanford Car
dinal women's basketball team's pursuit of a third
national championship.
Good Friday became the day the music died. Or
more specifically, the third straight time Stanford
(34-2) was turned away in the semifinal game of a
Final Four. This time, the Lady Monarchs (34-1)
did the dirty deed, stunning the Cardinal 83-82 in
overtime before 16,714 fans at Riverfront Colise
um.
Just like that, the careers of seniors Kate Star
bird, Jamila Wideman, Charmin Smith and Tara
Harrington are over. And so tantalizingly close to
their ultimate goal — again.
However, it was not so much the loss actually
happening as the way it happened. Stanford held a
15-point first-half lead, with the offense pushing
the ball effectively and the post play of redshirt
sophomore Kristin Folkl blowing the Lady Mon
archs off the court. It turned into the biggest
blown lead in semifinal history.
To its credit, Old Dominion fought back to make
the game a nip-and-tuck affair in the second half.
But the Cardinal held a 72-67 lead with two min
utes to go in regulation and lost that as well. Even
then, Stanford had three shots in the final 12 sec
onds of overtime to pull this game out before Wide
man's three-point attempt at the buzzer bounded
off the rim.
"This team is very disappointed," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I thought we came
out at the beginning of the game and did a good job
playing the way we wanted to play. Going into
overtime, we had some real breakdowns in key
times and actually had a chance to win and not
playing our best."
Star light, star bright
As fans slowly filled the coliseum before the
game, it was a study in contrasts on the floor. Old
Dominion looked content just to be there and with
good reason. The Lady Monarchs had just survived
a hairy Mideast regional final, going scoreless in

the final 6 minutes, 35 seconds of
the contest and barely holding off
Florida 53-51.
Meanwhile, Stanford came out
very businesslike. It had just
exacted sweet revenge on a fiat
Georgia team four nights earlier
and had the look of a team that
was in no way going to be denied a
spot in the final game. Getting to
the Final Four was old hat. And if
that was not enough motivation,
all the players needed to do was
look to the other end of the court
to see the team that beat them 83-
66 Dec. 17.
Early on, it was Starbird who
dictated the action. The senior
guard's breakaway layup 2:11 into
the game gave Stanford its first
lead at 5-4 and became the start of
a sizzling first half. She came back
to nail the first of her four three
pointers to give the Cardinal a 12-
8 going into the first media time
out.
Folkl added to the Lady Monar
chs' problems as she too began to
assert herself. First, she took a
pass from Wideman for the short
layup, then took her defender out
side for a sweet left-handed
jumper. On the next possession,
she took a long outlet pass from
Wideman and jumped high to
touch-pass it to waiting junior
center Olympia Scott underneath
for the unbelievable assist and an
18-10 lead.
"Basketball is a game of
spurts," VanDerveer said. "And I
think Kristin had some — she
obviously helped us tremendous
ly."
Stanford's spurt was capped off
by Starbird's fourth three of the
half, tying an NCAA semifinal
game record for most treys in a
game. More important, it gave the
Cardinal a 31-16 lead with 7:48 to
go in the first half.
But by this point, Folkl was sit
ting on the bench with two fouls.
In eight minutes, she had hit all
four of her field goals and made
one steal to go along with her
assist.
Still, Starbird continued to get
open looks at the basket as she
nailed two more jumpers to con
clude her dizzying 21-point first
half. Unfortunately, after the sec
ond basket with two minutes to
go in the half gave the Cardinal a
37-23 lead, Stanford went score
less.
Old Dominion took advantage
of this by snatching the momen
tum and cutting into the deficit.
Senior point guard Ticha
Penicheiro provided the key
moment of the run as she acrobat
ically laid in a shot and drew Wide
man's first foul with four seconds
to go. The three-point play made
the score 37-30 as the two teams
headed into the locker room.
Machanguana momentum
Through the first half, Old
Dominion senior center Clarisse
Machanguana was a complete
non-factor, missing her only shot,
grabbing only three rebounds and
turning the ball over three times.
This was a stark contrast to the
first meeting, when she had 16
points and eight rebounds while
putting Stanford's post players in
foul trouble.
"At halftime, [Old Dominion
head coach Wendy] Larry pretty
much told me about my scoring
and performance on the floor,"
Machanguana said. "She told me
that the free throw area was wide
open, and I had to do something."
Do something she did as she
quickly filled the paint with her
menacing presence by scoring the
first six points of the second half
on aggressive drives. Penicheiro
did the rest, turning Stanford's
14th turnover into a breakaway

layup and a 38-37 Lady Monarch
lead with 17:54 left.
A 15-0 run helped erase the
Cardinal's 15-point lead. It was to
be a dogfight the rest of the way.
"They went on a great run to
catch up, and we lost all of our
momentum," Wideman said.
"We kind of came down and
weren't running anything offen
sively."
Old Dominion opened up a 51-
46 lead three minutes later on
another Machanguana putback.
Stanford eventually clawed back
ahead 56-55 on two Folkl layups.
Two possessions later, Wideman
nailed a huge three-pointer from
the top of the key for a 59-55 lead
with 8:46 to go. After Old Domin
ion closed the gap again, Wide
man hit another three for a 62-57
advantage. It appeared that Stan
ford's fearless leader was going to
will the team to victory.
Wideman proved her mettle
down the stretch, going in for a
driving layup past junior forward
Mery Andrade. She completed the
three-point play to stake her team
to a 72-67 lead with two minutes
left. That date with destiny
appeared to be on.
A frantic finish
Old Dominion looked ready to
fold, especially when sophomore
guard Aubrey Eblin threw up a
wild three-point shot with 1:48 to
go. Unfortunately, she was fouled
by Starbird. After nailing the first
two free throws, she missed the
last one. Andrade somehow
grabbed the rebound and drew
Folkl's fifth foul.
"That was a nice block," Van-
Derveer said. "She had all ball on
that one. She was the gutsy player
down the stretch and not having
her in there hurt us a lot."
Despite the fouls, Folkl was
indeed the offensive force when
Starbird was shut down in the sec
ond half. Folkl had a season-high
18 points and 10 rebounds on
record 8-of-8 shooting in -24 min
utes. Meanwhile, Starbird had
five points after halftime, all on
free throws while missing six
shots.
"They did step up their defen
sive pressure on us," Starbird
said. "But I missed shots in the
second half, and maybe I got a lit
tle tight as they came back."
That tightness may have been
a reason for the chronic turnover
problem that plagued Stanford all
game long. It finally hurt them big
time when Scott was caught with
the ball near midcourt and was
stripped by freshman guard
Natalie Diaz, who promptly drove
in for the game-tying layup.
Scott's third foul the next time
down resulted in two successful
free throws by Andrade with 1:09
left. Stanford's 27th turnover
turned into a layup for
Machanguana with 26 seconds
left that gave the Lady Monarchs
a 76-72 lead.
After a layup by junior forward
Naomi Mulitauaopele 14 seconds
later, Machanguana was on the
line with a chance to ice the game.
She missed the front end of a one
and-one and Smith somehow
came down with the rebound and
was fouled by Andrade with 10
seconds to go. The Cardinal still
had a chance to save the season.
Smith, ever the unflappable play
er, calmly sank both shots to dead
lock the score at 76-76.
"I was just happy [to have a
chance to tie] because it seemed
like it was getting down to the
end," Smith said. "I was excited
that we had another chance."
Another chance in Stanford's
first overtime game of the season
and the fourth in Final Four his
tory.
The bitter end
Having somehow earned five
more minutes of basketball, the
Cardinal pulled ahead on a Muli

tauaopele putback with the shot
clock winding down. After the
Lady Monarchs answered, Star
bird drove down the lane and
dished off to junior forward
Vanessa Nygaard down low, find
ing a great time to hit her first
field goal of the game with two
minutes to go in overtime.
Those were the last points of
the Cardinal season.
Penicheiro tied the game again
on a driving layup and then made
one free throw for an 83-82 lead
with 50 seconds left. Her second
attempt bounded away, but Old
Dominion missed a putback. Scott
tore down the rebound and outlet
ted to Wideman.
The game was in her hands and
her chances appeared good with
Starbird on her left as she drove
down the court. But Penicheiro
came from behind and stole the
ball away with 28 seconds to go.
Wideman was forced to foul, and
Penicheiro missed another free
throw. That set up the final,
painful Stanford possession.
Wideman once again had the
game in her hands. She drove
down and pulled up for a 15-foot
er that missed. Nine seconds.
Nygaard rebounded and missed
from underneath. Seven seconds.
Smith came down with the
rebound and found Wideman out
on the wing for that final
attempt. Machanguana ran at
her, making some contact, but

the gutty senior point guard still
got the shot off. No good and no
time on the clock.
"I think there was contact,"
Wideman said of the possible mis
take on the referees' part. "There
was contact all game, though.
Sometimes they called it and
sometimes they didn't. I just
didn't get the call."
Just like that, it was over. The
sheer finality of the moment could
not be described in these short
paragraphs. Old Dominion had
just emerged victorious in
arguably the greatest Final Four
game ever. But there was little
immediate consolation after the
game.
"I think it is really hard
because this team had gotten to
this point three years in a row and
wanted more," VanDerveer said.
"I think that this is a team that's
improved and grown and has
some really very, very special peo
ple out there.
"But at this point it is hard to
keep it in perspective when there
are, I guess, 268 other schools
that aren't here. And you have a
shot, too — you are one point
away and overtime away from
playing for the national champi
onship. I am extremely disap
pointed, and just felt that we
could have done better. That's
the hardest thing, just really
believing that you could do bet
ter."
