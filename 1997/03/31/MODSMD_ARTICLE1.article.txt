# Old Dominion stuns Stanford in OT
## Quest for national title falls short for 3rd-ranked Card 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
CINCINNATI — It was not supposed to end
this way.
Not against Old Dominion. Not with the Nai
smith player of the year on your squad. Not with a
team that had destiny written all over it.
And last, but not least, not with a loss.
But destiny is fleeting sometimes, and when it
proves elusive, stunning things happen. Bad
things happen. Things that appear set in stone get
derailed, much like the third-ranked Stanford Car
dinal women's basketball team's pursuit of a third
national championship.
Good Friday became the day the music died. Or
more specifically, the third straight time Stanford
(34-2) was turned away in the semifinal game of a
Final Four. This time, the Lady Monarchs (34-1)
did the dirty deed, stunning the Cardinal 83-82 in
overtime before 16,714 fans at Riverfront Colise
um.
Just like that, the careers of seniors Kate Star
bird, Jamila Wideman, Charmin Smith and Tara
Harrington are over. And so tantalizingly close to
their ultimate goal — again.
However, it was not so much the loss actually
happening as the way it happened. Stanford held a
15-point first-half lead, with the offense pushing
the ball effectively and the post play of redshirt
sophomore Kristin Folkl blowing the Lady Mon
archs off the court. It turned into the biggest
blown lead in semifinal history.
To its credit, Old Dominion fought back to make
the game a nip-and-tuck affair in the second half.
But the Cardinal held a 72-67 lead with two min
utes to go in regulation and lost that as well. Even
then, Stanford had three shots in the final 12 sec
onds of overtime to pull this game out before Wide
man's three-point attempt at the buzzer bounded
off the rim.
"This team is very disappointed," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I thought we came
out at the beginning of the game and did a good job
playing the way we wanted to play. Going into
overtime, we had some real breakdowns in key
times and actually had a chance to win and not
playing our best."
Star light, star bright
As fans slowly filled the coliseum before the
game, it was a study in contrasts on the floor. Old
Dominion looked content just to be there and with
good reason. The Lady Monarchs had just survived
a hairy Mideast regional final, going scoreless in
