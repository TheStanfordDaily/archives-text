killed themselves because leader Marshall Herff
Applewhite convinced them he was dying of can
cer.
Computer disks sent to the former cult mem

nothing left here on the face of the Earth for me
. . . no reason to stay a moment longer."
With all of the autopsies completed, the coro

terminal cancer.
"Marshall Applewhite has no gross physical
evidence and no visual evidence of cancer in his

liver or any other organs," Dr. Brian Blackbourne
told The Associated Press.
Palestinians protest
NABLUS, West Bank (AF) — Thousands of
demonstrators shouting "Vengeance!" filled
streets throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
yesterday, protesting Israeli construction in east
Jerusalem and venting their anger over the killing
of a demonstrator.
Israel, fearing the spread of violence on Land
Day — an annual day of protests against Israeli
land confiscation — stationed a half-dozen tanks
outside Nablus.
But Palestinian police largely succeeded in cre
ating a buffer between their own people and
Israeli troops — at times firing into the air, beat
ing protesters with clubs, and chasing them.
