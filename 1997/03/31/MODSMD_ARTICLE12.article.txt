PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Attackers
hurled a grenade into a political protest yesterday in
an apparent assassination attempt on Cambodia's
main opposition leader that could threaten the coun
try's fragile democracy.
Eleven people died and 112 were wounded —
including one American — in the attack that fol
lowed predictions of worsening political violence as
parties maneuver before legislative elections
planned for November 1998.
San Rainsy, head of the Khmer National Party,
was slightly injured by shrapnel in his leg. He said
he owed his life to a bodyguard who died when he
threw himself on the political leader to shield him.
Blood stained the grass and street after the attack
on 200 protesters outside the National Assembly,
where Rainsy had been leading the rally against
alleged interference in the judicial system by Second
Premier Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's
Party.
Rainsy blamed Hun Sen — his longtime nemesis

— for the attack, saying the grenade was thrown by
police and army "terrorists" taking orders from Hun
Sen's formerly communist party.
Hun Sen "should be sentenced and arrested,"
said Rainsy, his clothes soaked in blood and the left
lens of his glasses cracked.
Hun Sen retorted that Rainsy and other protest
leaders should be arrested because they bore respon
sibility for the casualties.
After more than two decades of war, unrest and
totalitarian rule, Cambodia held free multiparty
elections in 1993 under U.N. supervision. Next
year's elections pit the Cambodian People's Party,
Cambodia's most powerful party, against an alliance
that includes Rainsy's party, as well as a royalist
party, which currently shares power with the CPP
in a tense coalition.
The injured mcluded a U.S. citizen, Ron Abney,
55, of the International Republican Institute, a
democracy advisory group. Abney, of Cochran, Ga.,
was wounded in the groin.
