Despite postseason losses,
Stanford's sports teams
deserve our admiration

Make your way down to
Maples Pavilion or
deGuerre Pool and you're
likely to feel something strange.
The sound of the basketball on the
hardwood might be more hollow
than usual; a stroke through the
water could leave less splash. These
phenomena might lie in the fact
that after months of hype and
expectation, Stanford's men's and
women's basketball and swimming
teams did not bring home a single
national title last week.
However, although the champi
onship ring eluded these squads, it
is unfair to look back on their sea
sons as disappointing. Rather, their
season-long successes should not
only make us proud of their efforts
but also help boost the Cardinal's
claim as the premier athletic power
house in the nation.
Although we are apt to focus our
attention on the heart-breaking
losses of the men's and women's
basketball teams in the NCAA tour
nament, each team's season encom
passed a lot more than the final
minutes of their final game.
The men's team, which had been
consistently ranked in the top 25
throughout the season, made it to
the third round of the NCAA tour
nament for the first time since
Stanford won the national champi
onship in 1942.
In a stunning run through the
tournament, the Cardinal upset
perennial power Wake Forest and
national player of the year Tim
Duncan and came close to upending
Utah before losing in overtime.
Moreover, the men's team, which
started four sophomores alongside
All-American Brevin Knight, had
more than 20 wins once again this
year in which they defeated nation
al contenders UCLA and Arizona.

The record of the women's bas
ketball team was even more impres
sive. With 34 victories alongside
only two losses, they came within
two points of reaching the national
title game. Long-ranked as one of
the top three teams in the country,
the women's team went unbeaten
in the Pacific 10 Conference and
boasted a squad filled with super
stars, including the sparkling player
of the year, Kate Starbird. If not for
some questionable calls in the
national semifinal game, the Cardi
nal women might be popping open
the champagne right now in cele
bration of a national championship.
Likewise, the men's and
women's swimming teams were set
for celebration, not for shocking
losses in the NCAA finals. Favorites
going into the postseason, the
teams both placed second national
ly. Although titles would have been
preferred, we shouldn't forget how
the men and women dominated the
water this winter, shattering school
records in the process.
The men's and women's basket
ball and swimming teams not only
made cases for individual greatness
this year but also for the collective
superiority of Stanford's athletic
program. Already holding three
national crowns (men's and
women's cross country, women's
volleyball), the Cardinal needs only
three more titles to break the NCAA
record for most championship
teams in one year.
It was hoped that basketball and
swimming titles would have given
Stanford the record, but strong
teams in men's and women's ten
nis, men's volleyball and baseball
could still make the 1996-97 Cardi
nal the most accomplished sports
program in collegiate history.
However, our place in history
must wait, for now. And in waiting,
it is more important to realize that a
team's failure to win one game does
not signify complete failure.
Because when the final buzzer
sounded for four of Stanford's
teams last week, success was
already guaranteed.
