Bookstore's donation better served in students' pockets

THE MARCH 12 Stanford Daily
had an article about the Book
store pledging a $100,000 dona
tion to Green Library in order to con
struct a reading room. On the surface,
this gesture may seem like philan
thropy, but a more stringent review
reveals otherwise.
The Bookstore is a nonprofit organiza
tion, legally bound in accordance to its
mission statement to serve the Stanford
community. What would best serve the
Stanford community — lower prices or a

reading room?
Instead of donating $100,000 to Green
Library, the Bookstore could easily have
used that money to reduce the cost of
textbooks. Thus, the Bookstore seems to
have forced students to pay a superflu
ous $100,000. Moreover, we had to pay
about 8 percent sales tax on the
$100,000 — bringing the total to
$108,000.
What do students get for our
$108,000? A reading room in Green
Library is an extremely low priority for

University expenditures. If it were a high
priority, the University would have prob
ably already built one. If the Bookstore
insists on continuing rebates (instead of
lowering textbook prices), how about
donating that $100,000 to our rebate
checks?
Bookstore, please stop the charade!
You have no right to force students to
fund your reading room shenanigans.
The money you are "donating" is not
your money; it is students' money. When
did we give you the right to give it away?

Furthermore, many of the students who
pay for the reading room will graduate
before its completion in 1999.
After taxes, the Bookstore forced stu
dents to pay at least $108,000 for some
thing worth at most $100,000! Where will
your frivolousness end — a community
carnival? Bookstore, your antics may
seem sincere, but we see beyond your
facade.
