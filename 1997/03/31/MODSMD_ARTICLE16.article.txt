# Book prices aren't really that outrageous after all
## 
### 
In my letter of March 7 ("Phone
monopoly rates poorly with frequent
international callers"), I cited two exam
ples of seemingly outrageous pricing at
the Stanford Bookstore. I was subse
quently contacted by the course materi
als manager, Hani Sayegh.
Mr. Sayegh admitted that the price of

one book had indeed risen from $13.95
to nearly $40, but he showed me his
actual costs and said that the Book
store's price increase resulted entirely
from a dramatic price increase from the
Chinese importer. Both before and after
the increase, the Bookstore added a 20
percent markup, which is considered
normal or even low by industry stan
dards.
My other example was a boxed set of
Chinese language tapes and an accom
panying book which I had seen at Bor-

ders for $7.95 and at the Stanford Book
store for $34.95. After Mr. Sayegh sug
gested that $7.95 was unbelievable, I
returned to Borders and discovered that
they had swapped labels on two similar
products.
The boxed set had been priced at
$7.95 while the book alone (without the
tapes or the box) was priced at roughly
$36! The information desk admitted
that Borders had incorrectly swapped
prices. The Bookstore's price was actu
ally about $1 lower than Borders' price.

Everything in my earlier letter was
factually correct. However, I want to
correct the false impression that the
Stanford Bookstore was price-gouging
on these items. Their prices were consis
tently based on 20 percent markups on
their costs. I appreciate Mr. Sayegh's
concern for the Bookstore's pricing poli
cy. If others have concerns about book
pricing, I am certain Mr. Sayegh would
like to hear from you.
