## Appealing to a higher court 
### 
TODAY IS THE last day of
Women's History Month. In high
school, we celebrated it by making
posters of famous women, past and pre
sent, and hanging them close enough to
eye level that we could look at them and
recognize ourselves. These were what
role models looked like: teachers, doctors,
writers, mothers, political leaders.
And now to the list, we add basketball
players. Aren't the women of Stanford
basketball just as poised and powerful
and extraordinary as women can be? It
goes without saying that they are role
models; perhaps they'll get the Nike com
mercials to prove it. You may be Tiger
Woods; Kate Starbird, c'est moi.
There is just something special about
watching the women play. I mean no dis
respect to the stars of the men's basket
ball team, who treated all of us to a
thrilling upset of Wake Forest and a
breathtaking trip to the Sweet 16. Some
one ought to write a column about how
remarkable they are, too.
But the men's team, on the whole, is
younger, young enough that I never sat
with them in CIV section, as I did with
Jamila Wideman and Charmin Smith
and Tara Harrington, rolling our eyes at
each other and watching the clock.
In Mark Tunick's wonderful "Judicial
Politics and Constitutional Law" class, I
sat on a mock Supreme Court with Wide
man. It was so exciting to have watched
her play the night before and then for the

two of us to debate the finer points of
Penn Central Transportation Co. vs. New
York City the very next day. People often
feel as if they know their heroes. It's a
different level when you actually do.
They are close to my heart, this team.
I, like many others, felt like a part of
them as they high-fived and danced their
way through their victories and cried in
their moment of loss. (I cried, too. My
roommate threw away the Saturday
paper so we would not have to read about
the only blemish on a perfect season).
I tell people who ask what I am doing
after graduation that I am applying to
graduate school or turning my thesis into
a book. But secretly, I want to be a bas
ketball coach, want to share in the excite
ment firsthand. Who could not become
involved watching them? They are a won
derful sight to behold.
They are easy to admire because they
are so easy to like: Vanessa Nygaard, the
tireless cheerleader with the endless sup
ply of one-liners; Kate Starbird (the Ethel
to Nygaard's Lucy), whose awesome abil
ity is only exceeded by the unselfishness
of her play; Kristin Folkl, the midseason
addition to the cast who makes everyone
around her sharper; Olympia Scott who
raises presence to an art form.
Tara VanDerveer, if you didn't have a
gold medal already, someone ought to
give you one for inspiring an entire gen
eration of fans and armchair coaches and
future WNBA stars. Those of us, male

and female, who are basketball fans and
those of us who are in search of role mod
els, thank you deeply. We salute your
efforts and celebrate your victories. It
will be a long eight months as we wait for
you to take to the court again.
There is so much talk, in feminism
and out of it, about what women should
be. Perhaps we ought to look more at
what women are.
Here at Stanford, inspiration takes
the form of people who eat dorm food and
pull all-nighters. I did not think I would
ever ask a role model for notes or almost
get mowed over by one in White Plaza.
The women of Stanford basketball are
smart, funny, strong, talented; they are,
in a word, real. They belong to our uni
verse; they are our source of pride.
On this, the last day of Women's Histo
ry Month, one thing is abundantly clear:
The women did not need to win or lose on
Friday to show the world that women's
basketball is every bit as exhilarating and
heartbreaking as men's basketball is.
All they needed to do was show up and
play. The lessons will take care of them
selves.
