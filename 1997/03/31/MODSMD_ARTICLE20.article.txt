# Victor Wishna:All in the timing
## If this be basketball Madness, is there a method in it?

"A little Madness in the Spring is whole
some even for the King."
— Emily Dickinson (1875)
THAT SEGMENT OF the academic
calendar known as college basket
ball season is nearly at its absolute
end. The women's NCAA race is finished.
As for the men, 64 teams are now down
to two and only one of the originally
scheduled 63 games still needs to be
played. Those of you who scream, "Stop
the insanity!" will indeed very soon get
your wish. As March comes to an end, so
does the Madness.
But I ask, was it — is it — truly mad
ness? This electrifying event, which
brings together people from copiously
diverse regions and backgrounds — can it
fairly be called craziness?
After all, these "championship tourna
ments," under cover of competition, are
really grand conventions that unite dele
gates from Southern California to South
ern Alabama to Charleston Southern.

Participants are invited to partake in
these postseason parties, without regard
to gender (men's tournament, women's
tournament), nationality (Florida vs.
Florida International), religion (St.
Mary's vs. Temple), age demographics
(Old Dominion vs. New Mexico) or even
social class (Princeton vs. Cal).
Teams of all creeds and conferences
set aside their burdens and come play in
the fields of 64. From all corners of the
basketball universe they rally — from
East they come, from West, from South
east, from Midwest.
In our personal universe as well, new
norms of brotherhood and sisterhood are
fostered. In our dorms and houses,
acquaintances who are barely acquainted
gather together in their lounges just
before tip-off. Even members of that
strange subculture that would "rather
read than watch television" find them
selves reading in front of the TV, even if
only for a couple of hours at a time.
Elsewhere, students who didn't even

know they hud a team are struck with a
strange, queasy sense of pride when that
team pops up in the headlines. Yes, see
ing strangers sharing a sports section
always brings a tear to my eye.
In fact, the only group excluded from
all the March Merriment are those
diehard non-fans who invoke disgust as
though it were a constitutionally protect
ed civil right. Sadly, there are those who
are so socialized against social proof, that
they'll shake their heads at a group of
frenzied fans and weakly whimper that
they "don't like basketball" — as if that
were enough justification.
As I've tried to reach out, I've found
myself standing off against people who
couldn't understand how one single
game was more important than a "Simp
sons" rerun, especially when there were
63 of them (games, that is). I've encoun
tered "friends" who would rather watch
63 taped episodes of "Friends" than even
the last minute of the unexpected thriller
that was Texas vs. Coppin State. No, I

don't know where Coppin State is either,
but that's not the point!
The point is — what person with a
viable soul can truly resist this special
season and its suspense, its high drama,
its tale of the underdog, the little Chat
tanooga Choo-Choo that could?
In the end, the "Sweet 16" and the
"Final Four" are not about numbers, and
they're not even about basketball. Cast
aside all the talk of "brackets" and "seed
ings" and "at-large bids" and, dammit,
you'll realize it's all about people! Those
who refuse to understand, who refuse to
reschedule their own finals around the
regional semifinals, who refuse even to
check the score of the Stanford-Wake
Forest game, are missing out on some of
the greatest stories of human endeavor.
Granted, these people are also blind to
the pain, the agony of defeat that comes
with watching one's favorites fall. When
a polished and predestined Kansas team
is tripped up by upstart Arizona and its
freshman point guard with too many tat

toos, the pain felt by all Rock-Chalk-Jay
hawk faithful everywhere is real. And it
hurts.
And when a superb Stanford women's
squad finishes its season short with a
record of 34-2 (0-2 vs. Old Dominion),
words can do little to express the emo
tions of an unfulfilled aim.
But, 10, I stand by the madness of this
March and all the pain and pleasure it
inspires. I join with the millions of others
who keep the faith by reciting the mantra
that is as important in life as it is in bas
ketball and which those on the outside
will probably never understand:
Although passion often leads to anguish,
it is better to have loved and lost than to
have never made the tournament at all.

Wildcats will win it all tonight.
