Fredrick Kruger, professor emeritus of ap
plied earth sciences and known as "Fritz" to
colleagues and friends, died on Feb. 9 at age 84.
Kruger was an internationally renowned
geologist and engineer who served as the chair
man of the Applied Earth Sciences during his
tenure at Stanford from 1966 until his retire
ment in 1977.
Applied Earth Sciences Prof. Marco Einau
di said, "He used his pi-actical industry experi
ence to teach students how to think and use ge
ology in the real world."
Evan Just, professor emeritus of applied
earth sciences department, said, "I had no
trouble working with Fritz. We were old
friends and understood each other. All I can
say is that he was a good workman and he
must have had an interest in helping young
people, otherwise he wouldn't have come
here."

Just also spoke of how Kruger helped to
merge the then-Mineral Engineering Depart
ment into the Applied Earth Sciences Depart
ment, expanding the breadth of its research.
"When I was asked to come to Stanford in
1959, we only had four students in the (Miner
al Engineering) Department, and we managed
to build that up to 20 students," he said.
"When Fritz took over, that just about doubled
in size."
Einaudi arrived at Stanford only two years
before Kruger retired, but remembers Kruger
as "a person very dedicated to students. He
put them ahead of everybody else. He was a
stern-looking chap, but once you got to know
him he was a nice man with fascinating sto
ries" about his earlier jobs as an exploration
geologist.
Kruger, a St. Paul, Minn, native, obtained
his bachelor's in geology and chemistry in
1935, and his master's in geology and metal
lurgy in 1936, both from the University of Min
nesota. He also went on to obtain his doctorate

in Geology from Harvard University in 1941.
Before coming to Stanford, Kruger distin
guished himself in the industry, working as a
consultant and geologist for various companies
and became known as one of the best economic
geologists in the world. He was the vice-presi
dent of International Minerals and Chemical
Corp. before coming to Stanford and continued
private consulting through his retirement in
1977.
Kruger held teaching positions at Dart
mouth College, Harvard University, North
western University and the University of Ten
nessee.
Kruger is survived by his wife, Helene, of
Woodside, his daughter, Jan Christian Kruger
Anderson of Chappaqua, N.Y., and two grand
children, Avery Christian Anderson and Ethan
Hunter Anderson. He is also survived by his
son-in-law, Robert Steven Anderson, also of
Chappaqua.
A memorial service is being planned for
later this year, but no date has been set.
