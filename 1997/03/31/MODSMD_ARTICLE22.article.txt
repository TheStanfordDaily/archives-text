## Sports Auburn keeps swimmers from title 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's swim
ming squad capped a stellar
season with its 16th straight
top-four finish in the NCAA
Championships, taking run
ner-up honors behind champi
on Auburn at the University of
Minnesota's Aquatic Center
this weekend.
First place was a long way
away, though, as Auburn beat
Stanford 496.5 to 340.
Coming into the meet as the
top-ranked squad, the Cardinal
set its sights on the title, but
was unable to match the
scorching performance of
Southeast Conference power
house Auburn, which ran away
from the field.
Paving the way for the Car
dinal were junior Ail-Ameri
cans Tom Wilkens, who cap
tured the 400 IM title, and
Sabir Muhammad, who fin
ished third in the 100 butter
fly. The 400 Medley and 200 and
400 Freestyle Relay teams also
notched top-three finishes.
