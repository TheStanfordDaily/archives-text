# Living up to expectations
## Final Four wasn't enough for women 
### 
E xpectation is a difficult
thing. Most players would
die for the opportunity to
play in just one Final Four. But
when a program is as successful as
Stanford's and the majority of the
players are competing in their third
national semifinal game, that
opportunity is not enough.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team (34-2) finished its season
with an 83-82 overtime loss to Old
Dominion (34-1) and came up short

of the goal it so vocally claimed all
season long. This team wanted a
national championship, and it
made that clear from early Novem
ber.
But when expectations are so
high, the fall can be long and
painful. Coming up short when you
started the season as the No. 1
team in the nation, when you
played so confidently all tourna
ment, when you're the clear
favorite of the four teams remain
ing, is not an easy thing to do.
When expectations are high, dis
appointment hurts. But if the alter
native is to have low expectations,
be satisfied with mediocrity, never
even have the shot, isn't that
worse?
If it's more tragic to be one of
those teams that never got the

chance, then being there and com
ing up short is definitely more
painful. It doesn't make it any easi
er to think of those programs that
don't get that chance. Those teams
that you beat by 30 during the sea
son will never know what it's like
when the one you wanted most just
slips away right in front of you.
They didn't come this close; they
didn't watch it slip away in the final
seconds. They didn't stand at the
top of the key, arms on hips, staling
oft in disbelief like Jamila Wide
man. They weren't like Kate Star
bird, grabbing the sides of her head
and walking in a frantic pace as if
she were trying to escape the tears
already streaming down her face, or
Charmin Smith, pulling her jersey
up to cover her mouth and nose in
an effort to hide some of the pain.
Maybe that's what hurt most
about watching this team play its
final game. You never wanted to see
them standing in agony on that
court. You didn't want them to
watch when the buzzer sounded
and their opponent began to cele
brate just yards away. They were
supposed to be the ones jumping
into each other's arms with glee,
not falling there with broken
hearts.
You wanted this team to win.
You knew no other group of women
deserved it more. You prayed for
that free throw to rim out so your
team would have the chance to win
and when it did, you jumped for joy
because they had gotten that
chance.
Your heartbeat rose as quickly
as the team raced down the court.

shot, the rebound, a second shot, another
rebound and one final attempt as the horn
sounded, ending the game and sending your
hopes for this team crashing to the floor.
You hurt for this team. You watched them
try so hard for so long, and that it ended this
way seemed to be more than you could bear.
Their tears ripped at your soul; it was more
painful than you thought a game could be.
For three years the majority of these play
ers had been on the court together. You'd
watched them grow as a team and as individ
ual players. They found a place in your heart,
and you thought for sure this would be the
year. You wanted it for them almost as much
as they seemed to want it for themselves.
But the Cardinal did not win the national
championship. The visions you'd had when
you talked about this being the year didn't
quite materialize like you'd expected.
were crushed, but somewhere during the
aftermath of that painful loss, you've already
begun to fondly reflect on what this team
meant. The vision of this year didn't disap
pear; it just changed.
Teams are often remembered by their suc
cesses, and this team isn't short on those. In
addition to a third straight Final Four appear
ance, this was the year that saw senior guard
Kate Starbird take over the top spot in the

school's record books for scoring. She was
then named national player of the year en
route to becoming arguably the greatest play
er in Stanford's history.
This was also the year that saw four-time
captain and senior point guard Jamila Wide
man come into her own. As the year length
ened Wideman's intensity grew. She began to
dominate the game in a way that only a great
point guard can.
And this was the year that saw Stanford's
frontcourt become the most talked-about bat
talion of posts in the country. The combina
tion of centers and forwards at head coach
Tar a VanDerveer's disposal was nothing short
of an army. Redshirt sophomore Kristin Folkl
came back because of injuries, and when the
team healed no one could put as many high
quality post players on the court as Stanford.
Teams make history by winning champi
onships, but not every team that wins one is a
special team. Special teams are the ones that
leave their mark on the people around them.
They come in with eager anticipation and fol
low it all the way through with style and dig
nity. And when they're gone you're left wish
ing it had never ended.
This was The Year and The Team. The list
of accomplishments and wonders is too
lengthy for these pages. These players are spe
cial, and what they gave their fans was some
thing wonderful. They may not have gotten
that championship, but anyone who had any
thing to do with this group will tell you, it's a
year and a team they won't soon forget.
