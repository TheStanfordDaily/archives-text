# Living up to expectations
## Final Four wasn't enough for women 
### 
E xpectation is a difficult
thing. Most players would
die for the opportunity to
play in just one Final Four. But
when a program is as successful as
Stanford's and the majority of the
players are competing in their third
national semifinal game, that
opportunity is not enough.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team (34-2) finished its season
with an 83-82 overtime loss to Old
Dominion (34-1) and came up short

of the goal it so vocally claimed all
season long. This team wanted a
national championship, and it
made that clear from early Novem
ber.
But when expectations are so
high, the fall can be long and
painful. Coming up short when you
started the season as the No. 1
team in the nation, when you
played so confidently all tourna
ment, when you're the clear
favorite of the four teams remain
ing, is not an easy thing to do.
When expectations are high, dis
appointment hurts. But if the alter
native is to have low expectations,
be satisfied with mediocrity, never
even have the shot, isn't that
worse?
If it's more tragic to be one of
those teams that never got the

chance, then being there and com
ing up short is definitely more
painful. It doesn't make it any easi
er to think of those programs that
don't get that chance. Those teams
that you beat by 30 during the sea
son will never know what it's like
when the one you wanted most just
slips away right in front of you.
They didn't come this close; they
didn't watch it slip away in the final
seconds. They didn't stand at the
top of the key, arms on hips, staling
oft in disbelief like Jamila Wide
man. They weren't like Kate Star
bird, grabbing the sides of her head
and walking in a frantic pace as if
she were trying to escape the tears
already streaming down her face, or
Charmin Smith, pulling her jersey
up to cover her mouth and nose in
an effort to hide some of the pain.
Maybe that's what hurt most
about watching this team play its
final game. You never wanted to see
them standing in agony on that
court. You didn't want them to
watch when the buzzer sounded
and their opponent began to cele
brate just yards away. They were
supposed to be the ones jumping
into each other's arms with glee,
not falling there with broken
hearts.
You wanted this team to win.
You knew no other group of women
deserved it more. You prayed for
that free throw to rim out so your
team would have the chance to win
and when it did, you jumped for joy
because they had gotten that
chance.
Your heartbeat rose as quickly
as the team raced down the court.
Rose a little more with the first
