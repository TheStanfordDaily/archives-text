# Women swim short of sixth title
## Cardinal squad second to USC 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS - It has been
said that all good things must
come to an end, and for the Cardi
nal women's swimming and diving
team it has.
The Stanford squad, which had
owned the national title for the
past five years, turned in one of its
worst performances in years and
lost to the USC Trojans 406-395 in
the March 20-22 tournament.
"I think USC swam exception
ally well, and we swam spotty,"
said Cardinal head coach Richard
Quick. "We had some really fine
performances, and we had some
that weren't up to what we had
hoped they'd he.
"When you come to a meet like
thus, you have to expect to perform
at an exceptional level to win, and
we didn't do that."
The Cardinal women, who
held onto first place through the
first two days of competition,
relied heavily on the swims of
freshman phenom Catherine
Fox, who was the only Cardinal
swimmer to win an individual
championship in the meet.

Despite nursing an injured hack
all weekend, Fox, who won two
gold medals at the 199f> Olympic
Games, helped the Cardinal pull
out to an early lead Thursday by
capturing her first NCAA title in
the 50-yard freestyle race. Fox won
the race in 22.33 seconds, edging
out Arizona's Ashley Tappin by
0.19 seconds.
"I don't know what it does for
the team," Fox said about winning
individual events. "I just think
staying positive and staying smiley
helps us."
Stanford, however, did not win
another event Thursday and only
finished in the top three in one
event (the 200-meter free relay).
Nevertheless, the Cardinal placed
enough swimmers in the finals to
maintain a slim 7.5-point lead over
Arizona going into the second day
of competition.
It was much the same story for
Stanford on day two, as Fox was
the only Cardinal swimmer to win
an event. The evening opened with
the Cardinal's 200-meter medley
relay team finishing third behind
Southeastern Conference power
