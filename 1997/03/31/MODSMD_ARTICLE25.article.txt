# Women swim short of sixth title
## Cardinal squad second to USC 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS - It has been
said that all good things must
come to an end, and for the Cardi
nal women's swimming and diving
team it has.
The Stanford squad, which had
owned the national title for the
past five years, turned in one of its
worst performances in years and
lost to the USC Trojans 406-395 in
the March 20-22 tournament.
"I think USC swam exception
ally well, and we swam spotty,"
said Cardinal head coach Richard
Quick. "We had some really fine
performances, and we had some
that weren't up to what we had
hoped they'd he.
"When you come to a meet like
thus, you have to expect to perform
at an exceptional level to win, and
we didn't do that."
The Cardinal women, who
held onto first place through the
first two days of competition,
relied heavily on the swims of
freshman phenom Catherine
Fox, who was the only Cardinal
swimmer to win an individual
championship in the meet.

Despite nursing an injured hack
all weekend, Fox, who won two
gold medals at the 199f> Olympic
Games, helped the Cardinal pull
out to an early lead Thursday by
capturing her first NCAA title in
the 50-yard freestyle race. Fox won
the race in 22.33 seconds, edging
out Arizona's Ashley Tappin by
0.19 seconds.
"I don't know what it does for
the team," Fox said about winning
individual events. "I just think
staying positive and staying smiley
helps us."
Stanford, however, did not win
another event Thursday and only
finished in the top three in one
event (the 200-meter free relay).
Nevertheless, the Cardinal placed
enough swimmers in the finals to
maintain a slim 7.5-point lead over
Arizona going into the second day
of competition.
It was much the same story for
Stanford on day two, as Fox was
the only Cardinal swimmer to win
an event. The evening opened with
the Cardinal's 200-meter medley
relay team finishing third behind
Southeastern Conference power
houses Auburn and Georgia.
Then Stanford widened its lead,
as other Stanford freshmen began
contributing. Both Jessica Amey
and Gabrielle Rose scored points in
the championship final of the 100-
meter butterfly, finishing third
and fifth, respectively. Senior co
captain Michelle Jesperson also
produced a solid performance Fri
day, finishing sixth in the 200-
meter free, one of the most com
petitive races of the meet.
In the following race, Fox stole
the show once again. The fresh
man had an amazing start in the
100 back which put her far enough
ahead to thwart a late run from
California's Marilyn Chiang for
the title.
"That swim was huge," Quick
said. "It was a great win for us, it
was a great win for her and I am
really proud of her."
Despite Fox's win and the Car
dinal 15-point lead, Quick, who
had the meet wrapped up by Fri
day's competition last year, was
worried about the final day.
"We're definitely struggling,"
said Quick, after the conclusion of
the Friday races. "But this meet is
going to be won in the preliminar
ies tomorrow, so it's far from over
and it's going to be a really tight
contest."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Quick was right.
USC and Southern Methodist
University turned in outstanding
performances in Saturday's pre
liminaries, while Stanford never
got it together. What that meant

was that USC and SMU had con
siderably more women swimming
in the championship finals Satur
day night. And even though the
Cardinal packed the consolation
finals, Fox was the only Cardinal
swimmer to qualify for an indi
vidual championship (she fin
ished third in the 100-meter
free).
Thus, it was only a matter of
time before USC moved ahead of
the Cardinal to win the champi
onship. Stanford scored points in
each of the first three events of the
night, but failing to qualify anyone
for the 200-meter breast marked
the end of an era for Cardinal
swimming.
"It's disappointing for the ath
letes and our university that we
didn't win, especially when you
believe you could have," Quick
said. "But that's athletics, and we
are already looking forward to the
challenge of next year."
Unlike in other sports where
parity is more common, swimming
has been dominated by the Cardi
nal for the last five years. Accord
ingly, this year's second-place fin
ish was not only a shock to swim
ming fans but to Quick and his

swimmers as well.
"I honestly believe that we are e
better team than [USC]," Jesper
son said. "So it's hard for me to say
what happened."
In explaining their finish, most
of the Stanford swimmers pointed
to inconsistency at the meet. "We
either swam really well, or swam
really shitty," said senior co-cap
tain Sarah Anderson. "We just
didn't have enough people in the
finals to match [USC]."
The Cardinal did manage to end
on an up-note, though, as Stanford
turned in solid performances in
the final two events of the champi
onship meet. Senior diver Megan
Gardner led the late charge and
finished fifth in the platform div
ing competition.
And. with the national champi
onship already won by USC, the
Cardinal's 400-meter free relay
team (Rose, Amev, Fox and senior
Claudia Franco), turned in an
inspiring performance to win the
final event of this year's competi
tion.
"The 400 free relay has always
been our relay," Jesperson said.
"We've always won it, so it's excit
ing to still go out as champions."
