# Sweet Sixteen swallows men's hoops
## Team loses to Utah in overtime to end most successful postseason since 1942 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — For Stanford, the
ride lasted longer than even its
most ardent supporters could have
hoped: through a stern first-round
test, past the second-round Goliath
and into the rarefied air of the
Sweet 16. The team made it back
home to San Jose and oh-so-breath
takingly close to the Elite Eight and
a chance to play for a Final Four
berth.
That "Final Four" and Stanford
could even be included in the same
sentence speaks volumes about the
Cardinal's postseason success.
But alas, one had to believe
Stanford's number would come up
sometime — as it must for 63 of 64
tournament teams — and the end
came sooner rather than later in
the West Regional at San Jose,
where the Cardinal participated in
Sweet 16 play for the first time
since its national championship
season of 1942, when only eight
teams competed in the tourney.
The role of party-crasher fell to
second-ranked and second-seeded
Utah, which snapped Stanford out
of its NCAA Tournament dream
with an 82-77 overtime victory in
the West Regional semifinals at San
Jose Arena on March 20.
But it didn't come without a
valiant effort from Brevin Knight
and company, who followed up a
nightmare first half with a near
miraculous comeback that culmi
nated in Knight's desperation
three-pointer with seven seconds
remaining, sending the game to
overtime, when Stanford finally
surrendered.
"God, we had such a chance,"
sighed head coach Mike Mont
gomery afier the game. "As proud I
am of these kids, we just didn't play
very well.
"There wasn't anybody we could
go to. We were working so hard on
defense just to stay in the game and
give ourselves a chance, if we ever
could've got a spurt going where we
just 'Bang! Bang! Bang!' — some
body shot it in — I think we
could've won."
Stanford couldn't have asked for
a better atmosphere. The sellout
crowd of 18,345, which included a
vociferous Stanford student section
replete with Sixth Man Cluo T
shirts, was decidedly pro-Cardinal.
But they didn't have much to cheer
about in a first half that saw the
overly anxious Cardinal miss on 22
of 32 field-goal attempts and fnll
behind by as many as 16 points.
" They're a phy .-cal team, and
that surprised us," explained
Knight, who was l-of-5 from the
field in the first half, "and we were
a little bit pumped up. A little bit
too much, maybe."
Utah didn't fare much better at
the start. More than nine minutes
into the half, the scoreboard read 6-
2, Utes. Stanford didn't break into
double figures until there was 4:56

remaining in the half. By then, the
Utes had shaken from their initial
haze and were beginning to run
away with the game, taking a 35-21
lead into halftime
The Cardinal finally began
showing signs of life shortly after
intermission. Utah led 37-23 with
17:06 left when three Brevin
Knight baskets and a Peter Sauer
fast break lay-in sawed the lead to
six with 14:10 remaining, inciting a
deafening roar of approval from the
crowd.
Then Knight picked up his third
and fourth fouls in rapid succes
sion, the latter setting ofT a tirade
from Stanford assistant coach
Doug Oliver that led to a technical
foul as Knight prepared to shoot a
pair of free throws that would
shave the lead to four. Utah star
forward Keith Van Horn calmly
converted both technical free
throws nt the other end, guard Ben
Cat on buried a trey, and the lead
was back at nine.

But Knight continued to cane
apart the Utah defense, almost sin
gle-handedly keeping the Cardinal
within reach until finally, heroical
ly, his last gasp three-pointer from
the left corner, in front of the Stan
ford bench, tied the score at 67-67,
sending the contest to overtime.

Then, just 34 seconds into over
time. Van Horn was called for a
moving screen on Knight — his
fifth foul — sending the All-Ameri
can to the bench and putting
Knight at the line with a chance to

give Stanford its first lead of the
night. He made one of two, putting
the Cardinal up 68-67.
But even with three starters
fouled out (Stanford also fouled out
three players — sophomores Tim
Young and Arthur Lee and fresh
man Mark Madsen), Utah did not
relent, scoring almost at will and

getting key defensive stops and
clutch free-throw shooting, particu
larly from 6-foot-11 center Michael
Doleac, who was 12-of-12 from the
line.
Freshman forward Hanno Mot
tola put the Utes ahead for good
with a turnaround baseline
jumper that made it 75-73 with
1:59 remaining. Three-point
attempts by Knight, Lee and
sophomore Kris Weems all fell
short, and time ran out on Stan
ford's season.
