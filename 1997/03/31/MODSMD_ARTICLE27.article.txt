# Men beat Wake Forest to advance to regionals

TUCSON. Ariz. - One look
at Brevin Knight told the
whole storv. Skittering across
the McKale Center court, a
magical smile across his face,
the senior Ail-American point

guard embraced teammates,
pumped his fists, saluted the
Stanford fans, raised his eyes
to the heavens — reveling in
the moment with all the giddi
ness of an 8-year-old boy on
Christmas morning.
With time running out on
Stanford's 72-66 second-round
victory over Wake Forest,
Knight could let the emotion
flow. For the First time in recent
history, the Cardinal was headed
to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
Tournament.
Stanford thrilled fans with its
second-half comeback and near
upset of Utah in the West
Regional semifinals, but the
jewel of its 1997 tournament run
was undoubtedly this improba
ble second-round upset of Wake
Forest.
It was a game few expected
the Cardinal to win. It was an
upset that earned top billing on
that evening's sports telecasts
and lavish, full-page spreads in
the local papers. It was an
unmistakable benchmark in the
growth of the Stanford program
into a bona-fide college basket
ball power.
It was one glorious moment,
the unlikely Cardinal grabbing
the national spotlight all to
itself, even if just for an after
noon.
This, to quote head coach
Mike Montgomery, "was a

pretty big deal."
Two years running, Stanford
had advanced to the tourna
ment's second round only to be
gobbled up by a top-ranked
school and its high-profile super
star.
In 1995, it was sophomore
superstar Marcus Camby and
Massachusetts delivering a 22-
point skewering of the Cardinal.
In 1996, it was Camby, as the
Associated Press player of the
year, and UMass again, only this
time the Cardinal hung in long
enough to come just a three
pointer shy of forcing overtime.
This was the year Stanford,
playing like a team that had
been here before — because it
had — would ride two-year tour
nament veteran Brevin Knight
where no Stanford team had
gone before. All that stood in its
way was another top-ranked
team in third-seeded Wake For
est and another world-class ath
lete in senior Tim Duncan, the
1996 AP player of the year.
Stanford, emotional but com
posed, didn't flinch. With a
parade of big men holding Dun
can in check and the rest of the
Demon Deacons unable to locate
the basket, the Cardinal took
control from the opening tip.
With player after player rack
ing up two and three fouls trying

to guard the All-American cen
ter, Montgomery was left no
choice but to continue subbing
in his big men, and unexpected
ly, uncannily, the tactic worked.
Harassed by an endless flurry of
forearms and elbows, Duncan
began to wear down.
He still managed a remark
able 14 points and 15 rebounds
in the first half but got little
backup from his teammates,
who mustered just two first-half
field goals. Stanford, after jump
ing out to leads of 10-2 and 21-8,
went into halftime leading 25-
19.
The Cardinal stretched that
lead to 16 in the second half, but
eventually the giant awakened.
Guards Tony Rutland and Jerry
Braswell, held scoreless in the
first half, exploded for 29 points
in the second, helping the Dea
cons claw back into the game.
Rutland's three-point play
with 3 minutes, 24 seconds
remaining in the game sliced the
Stanford lead to 58-53. But the
Cardinal steadied itself, scoring
on seven of its last eight posses
sions and converting on the bulk
of its free throws.
"This is heaven for me,"
Knight said in a postgame news
conference, still basking in the
afterglow of the historic victory.
He finished the afternoon with a

game-high 19 points, five
assists, four steals and just one
turnover.
Knight, who roomed with
Duncan last summer when both
were members of the U.S. 22-
and-under select team coached
by Montgomery, embraced Dun
can after the game. "I told him
I'd see him at the next level,"
Knight said.
As the probable top pick in
the NBA lottery, Duncan will
shine on draft day, but for this
golden afternoon he took a back
seat to Knight and his Cardinal
teammates, taking center stage
in the college basketball cosmos.
And with this year to build on,
who's to say there won't be more
such days to come.
