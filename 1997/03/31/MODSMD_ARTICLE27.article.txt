### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
TUCSON. Ariz. - One look
at Brevin Knight told the
whole storv. Skittering across
the McKale Center court, a
magical smile across his face,
the senior Ail-American point

guard embraced teammates,
pumped his fists, saluted the
Stanford fans, raised his eyes
to the heavens â€” reveling in
the moment with all the giddi
ness of an 8-year-old boy on
Christmas morning.
