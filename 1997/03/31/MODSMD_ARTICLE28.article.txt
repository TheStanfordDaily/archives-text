## Cardinal returns favor to Georgia 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
MISSOULA, Mont. - The
third-ranked Cardinal did more
than get Georgia off its mind — it
throttled them out of the NCAA
tournament.
Stanford, whose previous visit to
Missoula four years ago resulted in
a disappointing 80-67 semifinal loss
to Colorado, overcame Virginia and
Georgia to advance to its sixth
Final Four in eight seasons, knock
ing ofT the Cavaliers 91-69 and the
Lady Dawgs 82-47, the second
game a rematch of last year's
national semifinal.
"I'm really excited with how
hard and how well our team
played," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "It was a total
team effort, and I was really proud
of their defense. I thought we con
trolled the game with our defense
and on the boards. We got into
transition, a lot of people contribut
ed and people on our team did a
great job of concentrating and fol
lowing the game plan."
The long-anticipated showdown
with Georgia came to pass on
March 24 before 5,975 fans in
Dahlberg Arena. The Lady Dawgs
showed some early resiliency —
severely lacking in its 66-52 region
al semifinal win over Vanderbilt
two nights earlier — as they raced
out to a 16-7 lead eight minutes
into the contest.
But Stanford responded with a
solid 19-2 run that put it comfort
ably ahead. Redshirt sophomore
forward Kristin Folkl had a phe
nomenal first half with eight
points and four rebounds, but it
was her passing that helped spur
the Cardinal comeback. From the
top of the key, Folkl found a cut
ting Vanessa Nygaard for a layup
that put Stanford ahead 19-18
partly through the opening half, a
lead never relinquished the rest of
the night.
"I think we were ready to play,"
said Georgia head coach Andy Lan
ders. "But as we went up, it seemed
that [Stanford] became more
aggressive defensively and that cre
ated some problems for us."
The rest of the deep well that is
Stanford's post play also began to
exploit Georgia. Junior center
Olympia Scott poured in seven
first-half points while junior for
ward Naomi Mulitauaopele
chipped in seven of her own. All
told, the front line of Nygaard.
Folkl, Scott and Mulitauaopele
made more field goals (10) than the
entire Dawg squad combined
(eight).
After starting on a pace to score
more than 50 points, Georgia went
11 minutes, 26 seconds between
field goals and ended up with a sea
son-low 22 points at the half as the
Lady Bulldogs trailed by 16, 38-22.
The second half was a complete
runaway as Georgia showed little
savvy about running a halfcourt
offense. Stanford's lead never
dipped below 12 points as Georgia
folded more decidedly at each TV
timeout. By the final media break.
Stanford was up 75-40 with less
than five minutes to go in the game
en route to the biggest regional
final win ever.
The magnitude of the Georgia
fold was nothing short of impres
sive. The Lady Dawgs hit season
lows in points, field goal percentage
ta meager 29 percent from the
floor) and field goals made (17-of
-59). Senior center Tracy Hender
son ended her career bitterly with a
2-for-6 shooting performance and
only four rebounds in 23 foul
plagued minutes.
Meanwhile, Scott had no such

trouble, ruling the paint with a
team-high 21 points and nine
rebounds while senior guard Kate
Starbird and Folkl chipped in 15
and 14 points, respectively.
The rematch was set up on
March 22, with Stanford getting by
a remarkably undisciplined Vir
ginia squad. With the 22-point win,
Stanford won its 24th consecutive
game, breaking the school record
set last season during the Cardi
nal's Final Four run to Charlotte.
Early on however, visions of
another early exit in Missoula arose
as the Cavaliers ran out to an 8-2
lead three minutes into the contest.
Virginia was running the floor
while also being physical down low,
although this did lead to five quick
team fouls before the first media
timeout.
But this season's Cardinal was
not about to repeat history, espe
cially with the depth it carried. The
memory of Molly Goodenbour look
ing winded in Montana's high alti
tude is not possible this year with
people like Folkl, Mulitauaopele
and freshman guard Milena Flores
giving Scott, Nygaard and Wide
man the chance to rest without the
level of play dropping off.
"Their defensive quickness gave
us problems early." VanDerveer
said. "Virginia is a great team, but
we had a little more quickness
tonight."
Stanford settled down and
promptly responded with a 15-0
run while Virginia went scoreless
for more than three minutes. Star
bird's first three of the game gave
the Cardinal the lead for good at 9-
8 while Nygaard capped off the run
with a short baseline jumper from
the left side that prompted a 20-sec
ond timeout by Cavalier head coach
Debbie Ryan.
Virginia wasted no time, making
it 17-16 in 90 seconds on the
strength of senior guard Tora
Suber's scoring. That was as close
as they would get in the half, or the
entire evening for that matter.
Starbird's fourth three made it
32-22 with 6:19 to go in the first
half as the Cardinal also started to
assert its power down low. The
front line of Nygaard, Scott, Folkl
and Mulitauaopele teamed up for
22 points and 14 rebounds, helping
the Cardinal race to a 44-35 half
time advantage.
Early in the second half, it
quickly become apparent that
Virginia did not have the team to
stay with Stanford. Wideman
only punctuated that fact with a
remarkable performance that
made the Virginia defenders
appear nailed to the floor. She
scored 11 points, grabbed four
rebounds (helping Wideman tie
her career-high of nine) and
dishing three second-half assists,
including a sweet bounce pass
down low for a Folkl lavxip that
gave the Cardinal a 72-58 lead
with eight minutes to go in the
game.
While the game was no longer in
doubt, Wideman added an exciting
exclamation point to the evening —
her first career block. Suber was
the unfortunate victim, driving
down the lane for a fast-break
layup until Wideman brought her
back down to Earth. Suber's last
game ended with a whimper
uncharacteristic of a Naismith
finalist: a team-leading 22 points on
only 8-of-23 shooting, four fouls
and three turnovers.
Stanford moved to the round of
16 for the 10th straight season by
beating 16th-seeded Howard (24-6)
111-59 March 15 and eighth-seeded
Texas Tech (20-9) 67-45 two days
later in the third straight subre
gional hosted by Maples Pavilion.

chipped in seven of her own. All
told, the front line of Nygaard.
Folkl, Scott and Mulitauaopele
made more field goals (10) than the
entire Dawg squad combined
(eight).
After starting on a pace to score
more than 50 points, Georgia went
11 minutes, 26 seconds between
field goals and ended up with a sea
son-low 22 points at the half as the
Lady Bulldogs trailed by 16, 38-22.
The second half was a complete
runaway as Georgia showed little
savvy about running a halfcourt
offense. Stanford's lead never
dipped below 12 points as Georgia
folded more decidedly at each TV
timeout. By the final media break.
Stanford was up 75-40 with less
than five minutes to go in the game
en route to the biggest regional
final win ever.
The magnitude of the Georgia
fold was nothing short of impres
sive. The Lady Dawgs hit season
lows in points, field goal percentage
ta meager 29 percent from the
floor) and field goals made (17-of
-59). Senior center Tracy Hender
son ended her career bitterly with a
2-for-6 shooting performance and
only four rebounds in 23 foul
plagued minutes.
Meanwhile, Scott had no such

trouble, ruling the paint with a
team-high 21 points and nine
rebounds while senior guard Kate
Starbird and Folkl chipped in 15
and 14 points, respectively.
The rematch was set up on
March 22, with Stanford getting by
a remarkably undisciplined Vir
ginia squad. With the 22-point win,
Stanford won its 24th consecutive
game, breaking the school record
set last season during the Cardi
nal's Final Four run to Charlotte.
Early on however, visions of
another early exit in Missoula arose
as the Cavaliers ran out to an 8-2
lead three minutes into the contest.
Virginia was running the floor
while also being physical down low,
although this did lead to five quick
team fouls before the first media
timeout.
But this season's Cardinal was
not about to repeat history, espe
cially with the depth it carried. The
memory of Molly Goodenbour look
ing winded in Montana's high alti
tude is not possible this year with
people like Folkl, Mulitauaopele
and freshman guard Milena Flores
giving Scott, Nygaard and Wide
man the chance to rest without the
level of play dropping off.
"Their defensive quickness gave
us problems early." VanDerveer
said. "Virginia is a great team, but
we had a little more quickness
tonight."
Stanford settled down and
promptly responded with a 15-0
run while Virginia went scoreless
for more than three minutes. Star
bird's first three of the game gave
the Cardinal the lead for good at 9-
8 while Nygaard capped off the run
with a short baseline jumper from
the left side that prompted a 20-sec
ond timeout by Cavalier head coach
Debbie Ryan.
Virginia wasted no time, making
it 17-16 in 90 seconds on the
strength of senior guard Tora
Suber's scoring. That was as close
as they would get in the half, or the
entire evening for that matter.
Starbird's fourth three made it
32-22 with 6:19 to go in the first
half as the Cardinal also started to
assert its power down low. The
front line of Nygaard, Scott, Folkl
and Mulitauaopele teamed up for
22 points and 14 rebounds, helping
the Cardinal race to a 44-35 half
time advantage.
Early in the second half, it
quickly become apparent that
Virginia did not have the team to
stay with Stanford. Wideman
only punctuated that fact with a
remarkable performance that
made the Virginia defenders
appear nailed to the floor. She
scored 11 points, grabbed four
rebounds (helping Wideman tie
her career-high of nine) and
dishing three second-half assists,
including a sweet bounce pass
down low for a Folkl lavxip that
gave the Cardinal a 72-58 lead
with eight minutes to go in the
game.
While the game was no longer in
doubt, Wideman added an exciting
exclamation point to the evening —
her first career block. Suber was
the unfortunate victim, driving
down the lane for a fast-break
layup until Wideman brought her
back down to Earth. Suber's last
game ended with a whimper
uncharacteristic of a Naismith
finalist: a team-leading 22 points on
only 8-of-23 shooting, four fouls
and three turnovers.
Stanford moved to the round of
16 for the 10th straight season by
beating 16th-seeded Howard (24-6)
111-59 March 15 and eighth-seeded
Texas Tech (20-9) 67-45 two days
later in the third straight subre
gional hosted by Maples Pavilion.
