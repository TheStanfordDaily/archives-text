# Class of 2001 receives notices
## 15.5 percent admit rate lowest in decade for Stanford 
### Kelly Vaughan Contributing writer 
During the next few days, 2,604 high school se
niors around the world will receive Class of 2001 ad
mission letters. Only 15.5 percent of the total appli
cants were admitted, marking Stanford's lowest
admit rate in the past decade.
Although many other selective colleges experi
enced a significant decline in the number of appli
cations, Stanford's pool of applicants increased by
2.9 percent this year to 16,844, said James Mon
toya, dean of undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid.
"We were pleased to note the rise in the number of
applicants to Stanford, but were particularly gratified
to see that the academic credentials for the admitted
students improved in every category," Montoya said.
About 90 percent of admitted students for whom
class rankings were reported fell within the top tenth
of their high school classes, and almost one-half have
straight-A records. More than two-thirds scored 700
or better out of a possible 800 on the verbal and math

portions of the SAT. Fewer than half of the students
with a 4.0 grade-point average were admitted.
"High school seniors seem busier than ever, and
with some students managing to juggle six APs and
three major extracurricular activities and the college
application process, the level of energy is truly extra
ordinary," Montoya said.
He added that the Admissions Office noticed that
among the admitted students, there seem to be more
women interested in math and science, more stu
dents interested in environmental issues and more
participants in research projects and summer insti
tutes than in previous years.
"Sharing technological expertise (i.e. building a
World Wide Web page) has become a new form of com
munity service," Montoya said in a press release.
"Students are seemingly more involved in collabora
tive and group learning projects at the secondary
school level where video and class presentations have
more often replaced the traditional term paper."
Montoya added, "Expertise in technology has
found its way not only into the
classroom but into research oppor
tunities and even extracurricular
activities and community service."
He said today's students are
learning to work with a variety of
people toward a common goal. "I
really sense that as a change in the
way secondary students are being
prepared to function in society,"
Montoya said.
The admitted class is 49.5 per
cent female and 50.5 percent male.
By major ethnic groups, the class is
9.9 percent African-American,
24.2 percent Asian-American, 9.7
percent Chicano, 1.2 percent Na
tive American and 49 percent
white. In addition, international
students represent 4.7 percent of
the admitted students. All these
figures are consistent with recent
years, according to the Admissions
Office.
Students from 1,418 secondary
schools in all 50 states and 46 for
eign countries will receive offers of
admission. Of the admitted class,
38.9 percent hail from California,
followed by Texas (6.4 percent),
New York (5.3 percent), Illinois
(3.6 percent), Massachusetts (3
percent) and Washington (2.6 per
cent).
The number of students admit
ted from the South increased sig
nificantly. Montoya attributed this
rise to an increased number of

strong applications from that re
gion.
The Admissions Office expects
an entering class of about 1,610
students, similar to last year's yield
rate of 61.3 percent. Montoya cited
distance from home, financial con
cerns and some students' "percep
tion that the California lifestyle is
too casual," as factors that may
deter students from going to Stan
ford.
Admitted students must decide
whether to accept their place at
Stanford by May 1.
Of those students accepted, 607
were previously notified under
Stanford's early decision program.
"In general it is a consistently
stronger pool," Montoya said of the
early decision applicants. "Those
students who are banking on their
senior year grades making a differ
ence would logically apply regular
decision."
Although the total number of
applications to Stanford in
creased, the number of early deci
sion applications decreased this
year. Montoya attributed this de
crease to "the very clear message
we sent to students . . . that early
decision is not the only way to get
into Stanford." He continued, "I
think that we have approached
early decision in a measured man
ner."
Montoya said he recognizes that
"some students simply aren't
ready to make a choice that early in
their senior year," and therefore,
universities must treat early deci
sion as "a delicate balance."
