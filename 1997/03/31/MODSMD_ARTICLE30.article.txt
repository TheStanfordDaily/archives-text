MISSOULA,
Mont. — After
enduring the
constant cliched
praise of her
play, senior
guard Kate
Starbird finally
received recog
nition that

counted —
national player of the year.
On March 23, Starbird was
named recipient of the 1997 Boost-
Naismith College Basketball Play
er of the Year Award, joining Jen
nifer Azzi as the only Stanford
player to achieve this accolade.
"Initially, I was kind of sur
prised," Starbird said. Head coach
Tara VanDerveer "told me and she
said I shouldn't be surprised. Then
I told her I was embarrassed, and
she said I shouldn't be embar
rassed. And then I decided flattered
was a good word."
Starbird easily outdistanced
runner-up Connecticut senior cen
ter Kara Wolters in the balloting
conducted by the Naismith Nation

al Advisory Board made up of lead
ing basketball coaches, journalists
and administrators.
At the time, Starbird was com
ing off a solid 22-point effort that
included four three-pointers in the
Cardinal's 91-69 victory over Vir
ginia in the West Regional semifi
nal. With the 22 points, the senior
guard became the first player in
Stanford history to score 700
points in a season while also closing
on becoming the Cardinal's all
time leading postseason scorer. She
would eventually pass Val Whit
ing's record of 249 points with a 15-
point performance during Stan
ford's 82-47 win over Georgia.
"I think I owe a lot to my team
mates that have played at Stan
ford," Starbird said. "For some rea
son, I just thrive in this system,
and I do realiy well with what we
d 0.... Perhaps I get this award,
but it's just because our team real
ly does so well consistently."
The two-time Pacific 10 Confer
ence player of the year (she shared
the award in 1996) joins an exclu
sive list of past Naismith winners
that include Anne Donovan, Cheryl
Miller, Dawn Staley and Saudia
Roundtree, last year's winner.

Five more years
After months of speculation,
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer agreed to a new five-year
extension March 18 that will keep
the highly successful coach at Stan
ford through April 2002.
"I was getting a little bit frus
trated, especially with the tourna
ment going on," VanDerveer said.
"I didn't want any speculation to be
a distraction for our team. I'm real
ly excited that things are going to
work out for our team, and I'm
really excited about our recruits."
The new contract is guaranteed
on both sides for three years, but it
will be VanDerveer's option to
extend it the final two years.
Published reports said Van-
Derveer will receive an estimated
base salary plus easily earned
incentives totaling near $200,000
per year. Including other incen
tives, camps, endorsements and
shoe contracts, VanDerveer could
earn nearly $450,000 annually.
The deal should make Van-
Derveer the highest-paid women's
basketball coach in the nation,
putting her ahead of Pat Summitt,
whose total package with Ten
nessee, running through May

2001, is worth $300,000 annually,
including a base salary of $137,000.
"The contract, I feel, is very
fair," VanDerveer said. "I feel
things are different in women's
basketball, that there are a lot
more options and opportunities.
Basically, they made a statement to
me that women's basketball is
important and that we want you in
the program, too."
VanDerveer had reportedly
been approached by at least five
professional teams, some from
American Basketball League and
Women's National Basketball
Association and even a Continental
Basketball Association squad, giv
ing Stanford more reason to renew
her contract.
Familiar faces
Not only did the Cardinal domi
nate the West Regional on the
court, but it also dominated the all
tournament team, securing four
spots, including the region's most
outstanding player. The team was
announced shortly after Stanford's
82-47 victory over Georgia in the
West Regional final.
Stanford was led by Jamila
Wideman, who secured regional

most valuable player honors by
deftly running the Stanford team
to two convincing victories over
Virginia and Georgia. The senior
guard averaged 13.5 points, 7.5
rebounds (including a career-high
tying nine against the Cavaliers)
and 6.5 assists in the two games
that saw the Cardinal crunch Vir
ginia 91-69 and avenge last year's
national semifinal loss to Georgia
by running them out of Missoula
82-47.
Joining Wideman were senior
guard Kate Starbird, junior center
Olympia Scott and redshirt sopho
more forward Kristin Folkl.
Starbird sandwiched her Nai
smith award presentation with a
team-high 22 points against Vir
ginia and 15 against the Lady
Dawgs. Scott and Folkl were
instrumental in the lethal front
line play that spelled doom for
opponents throughout the
regional. Folkl averaged 13 points
and 8.5 rebounds off the bench in
the regional, while Scott poured
in 21 points and grabbed nine
rebounds against Georgia. Scott
neutralized senior center Tracy
Henderson, holding her to two
field goals and four rebounds.

Spotlight on Starbird
For the second straight year,
Starbird found herself in familiar
company.
The senior guard was named to
the 1997 Kodak All-America team
March 27 for the second straight
year, joining Tennessee forward
Chamique Holdsclaw as the only
repeat members of the squad
selected by Division I members of
the Women's Basketball Collegiate
Association.
The WBCA also named Starbird
player of the year.
Joining Starbird and Hold
sclaw were senior center Taja
ma Abraham of George Wash
ington, senior guard Tamecka
Dixon of Kansas, senior forward
Clarisse Machanguana of Old
Dominion, senior forward DeL
isha Milton of Florida, senior
guard Ticha Penicheiro of Old
Dominion, junior forward Tracy
Reid of North Carolina and
junior guard Nykesha Sales and
senior center Kara Wolters,
both of Connecticut.
The Kodak Team is recognized
as the oldest and most prestigious
of the women's honor squads and
was first started back in 1975.
