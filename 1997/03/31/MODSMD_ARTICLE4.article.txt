### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
Wilbur Knorr, professor of philosophy
and classics, died of skin cancer March 18.
He was 51.
Knorr, a leading scholar in the field of an
cient mathematics, came to Stanford in
1979 as an assistant professor in the Pro
gram in History and Philosophy of Science.
He had been a full professor since 1990.
"Wilbur was simply one of the world's
most distinguished historians of ancient
mathematics," Philosophy Prof. Emeritus
Patrick Suppes said in a press release. "He

learned Arabic as a way to get additional in
formation about Greek mathematics. . ..
That's just one example that illustrates how
dedicated he was to the field."
Knorr specialized in the study of exact
sciences with emphasis on the development
of classical Greek mathematics and its me
dieval and modern traditions.
Recently, he studied the "creative" phas
es of classical geometry, which took place
over a relatively short period of time, from
400 to 200 B.C.'
"The kind of mathematical insights those
earlier geometers had are stun
ning," Knorr once wrote describing
his interests. "They were able to ac
complish things with a limited
technical background, without the
powerful mathematical techniques
one has today. What they accom
plished is similar to building a
cathedral without steel."

Knorr also wrote about and
taught courses on early classical
problem solving, pre-Euclidean
geometry and ancient and me
dieval mechanics and optics.
"He was wonderful, patient and
extremely quick," Cal State-Los
Angeles Philosophy Prof. Henry
Mendell — a former graduate stu
dent of Knorr — said about his
mentor. "I would get piles of notes
from him whenever I handed some
thing in."
By treating the history of early

Greek mathematics as au
tonomous from the history of phi
losophy, Knorr brought about an
interpretation of its development
"that was philosophically much
more profound that anything that
had been proposed before,"
Mendell said.
The traditional approach had
been to see mathematics as develop
ing out of philosophical schools and
puzzles. Knorr's belief was that the
ancient mathematicians were guid
ed by mathematical concerns.

"He reversed the traditional be
lief that philosophers told mathe
maticians what to do," Mendell
said. "Wilbur's view was that the
mathematicians told philosophers
what they were doing, and the
philosophers said, 'Oh wow, that's
what you should be doing.' "
Knorr was a native of Richmond
Hill, N.Y. He received his under
graduate, master's and doctoral de
grees from Harvard University. A
memorial service will be held today
at 4 p.m. in Memorial Church.
