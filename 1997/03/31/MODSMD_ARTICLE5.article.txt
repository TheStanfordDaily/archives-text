# Accident claims life of senior
## Tien dies of head injuries while hiking in Yosemite 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
Senior Henry Tien suffered fatal head injuries
last Monday afternoon after he fell while hiking in
Yosemite National Park.
Tien was hiking with his girlfriend, junior Susan
Wu, near Columbia Rock on the Upper Yosemite Fall
trail when the accident occurred. He was airlifted by
rescue personnel to Doctor's Medical Center in
Modesto, Calif., where doctors were unable to oper
ate due to severe blood loss.
During the hike, Wu had gone ahead of Tien, after
he decided to spend a little more time looking
around.
"Since I'm slower, I decided to go ahead, expect
ing him to catch up with me," Wu said. When Tien
did not catch up, Wu turned back and discovered
Tien already being attended to by others.
While no one actually saw Tien fall, those closest
to the incident at the time reported that he fell down
either one or two switchbacks, between six and 20
feet. There were also some indications that he fell
head first, hitting a sharp rock on the way down.
Tien was a biology and psychology major and a
head advising associate in Paloma, an all-freshmen
residence in Florence Moore Hall.
"He was extremely well-liked in the dorm," Resi
dent Fellow Edward Frueh said. "Henry always re
mained very easy-going, open and friendly. He was a
really great head AA."
"He was incredibly sincere," Wu recalled. "He
lived his life by a set of morals and stuck with them."
"Henry had so many good qualities," said senior
Eddie Sandoval, who has known Henry since fresh
man year and lived with him in Toyon Hall during
their sophomore and junior
years.
"He set his friends above any
thing else," Sandoval said. "He
was a person who I could count on
for anything. He noticed a lot of
little things about his friends."
While Tien was working to
ward becoming a doctor, "he was
already a doctor for us," said San
doval. "I trusted his opinion more
than anyone at Cowell."
Senior Scott Judd, a room
mate of Tien's during their
sophomore and junior years,
echoed these sentiments. "Henry
was an absolute gem. You could
always depend on Henry to come
through no matter what," Judd
said.
"He was just amazing all
around," said junior Irvin Tyan,
who first met Tien three years
ago. "The first thing I noticed
was that his last name, although
spelled differently, was the same
rare Chinese character, 'tien.' We
always joked around about being
brothers. ... He has always been
the older brother that I never had
and always wished for."
Tyan also recalled their last
meeting just before winter break.
"He had stayed up all night to
help me move my stereo system,
tapes, CDs and several boxes to
his room because I was going to
be in Oxford winter quarter and
needed somewhere to store my
things," Tyan said.
"I remember telling him to get
some sleep, but he insisted on
seeing me completely packed de
spite the fact that he had to drive
home by himself to Orange Coun

ty that very morning," he added.
"Henry felt passionately about
a lot of different things," said se
nior Howard Li, who has known
Tien since their freshman year.
In addition to his duties as a head
AA, Tien was an undergraduate
co-coordinator of the Arbor Free
Clinic in Menlo Park, which of
fers medical treatment primarily
to lower income individuals.
Tien served as a liaison be
tween the pre-medical student
volunteers and the clinic's other
staff.
Tien really publicized the clin
ic and what they do in order to in
crease usage of its services, ac
cording to Li, who serves as the
clinic's other undergraduate co
ordinator. The number of volun
teers also increased tremendous
ly because of Tien's efforts, Li
added.
"I learned a lot just from
watching him interact with oth
ers," said Li.
"Just doing some good in the
world was a big part of Henry,"
Sandoval explained.
"Whatever he did, he worked
really, really hard at it," Wu em
phasized. "He believed you can
really make a change. . . . He was
so idealistic."
Junior Jeff McCarty, another
of Tien's junior-year roommates,
summed up Tien's personality.
"He worked harder than anyone
I've ever met," McCarty said,
"yet he always made time for his
friends. He was really admired
and respected by everybody."
The funeral for Tien, whose
family lives in Irvine, Calif., was
held on Saturday in Newport
Beach, Calif. A memorial service
will also be held at Stanford once
students finish returning from
spring break, Frueh said.
