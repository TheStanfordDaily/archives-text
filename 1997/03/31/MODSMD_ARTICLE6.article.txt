# Merger faces legal hurdle
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The California state legislature is now considering
measures that could seriously affect the nature of the
merger between Stanford Health Serv ices and UC-San
Francisco Medical Center.
The legislation, introduced in the state senate by
Sen. John Burton, would extend state open meeting
and public record laws to any entity receiving more
than $50 million of state funding and using the name of
the University of California.
This requirement could turn into another hurdle for
a move that has already faced bitter opposition from
public-sector unions and initial hesitation by the UC
Regents.
Stanford officials have repeatedly insisted that the
merger will only go ahead if UCSF Stanford Health
Care, the corporation formed last year to take charge of
the combined clinical operations of the two centers, re
mains a completely non-governmental entity.
Peter Van Etten, chief executive officer of USHC,
said the legislation, if it passed, would make him "very
concerned about the viability of the entity." He added
that both of the universities have the option to dissolve
the merger at any time and for any reason.
He said the ability to operate as "a private, nonprof
it company" was essential to the future competitive po
sition of USHC. Stanford is not currently required to
hold open meetings or make its records public, al-
though UC-San Francisco is, as a
public institution.
Burton, a San Francisco Democ
rat, acknowledged that Stanford
was likely to oppose his plans. He
said Stanford "wants the benefits
of this merger but not any of the
burdens of public scrutiny. I don't
blame them."
He said in the event that his bill
passes, Stanford and UC officials
will have to choose between accept
ing public accountability or giving
up the merger.
Burton announced the legisla
tion on March 15 at a public hear
ing of the senate's judiciary com
mittee, which he chairs. The hear
ing was called specifically to look
into questions of the legality and
propriety of the merger.
"My concern is the way the re
gents put this |merger] together,"
Burton said at the beginning of the
session. "I think the way they put it
together stinks."
In addition to insisting on public
scrutiny, Burton repeatedly em
phasized that he thought the public
was inadequately represented on
the USHC board. Three of the
board's 15 members are UC re
gents, as well as three ex officio
members from UC-San Francisco.
Stanford also has six representa
tives, and the remaining three seats
are held by outside experts.
Burton criticized regents and
UC officials for giving in to Stan
ford's demands for a completely
private USHC rather than insist
ing that the state have half of the
seats on the board. He said the
merger as it stands "allows (UC-
San Francisco] to escape there

sponsibility it has to its employees
and to the public."
UC officials responded that the
USHC would be a nonprofit public
benefit corporation similar to Stan
ford's situation before the merger
and therefore obUged to serve the
public interest in its clinical work,
including treating indigent pa
tients.
"To my knowledge, we have
never turned away a child in need of
urgent care, and neither has (Stan
ford's) Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital," said Larry
Shapiro, chair of the pediatrics de
partment at UCSF's medical
school.
Although no Stanford represen
tatives were present at the hearing,
Van Etten said he agreed with the
position of the UC officials that
USHC would continue to serve the
public interest.
He added that debate over the
merger has been distorted by the
idea that the two medical centers
had different missions and that a
private USHC would be a for-profit
corporation, like a private health
maintenance organization, with no
legal responsibilities to the public.
Although Van Etten said USHC
was "very comfortable" with its
legal situation, several legal experts
testified at the hearing that it was
not at all clear the regents had the
authority to turn over a public asset
such as the medical center to an or
ganization in which they had only
minority control.
Several regents who did not op
pose the merger when the board ap
proved it 14-2 in November have
also changed their minds about the
legality of the merger. Burton said,
however, that the issue of transfer
ring public assets was more appro
priate for a court decision than leg
islative action.
