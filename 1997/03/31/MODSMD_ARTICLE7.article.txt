"No cuteness in the
hallways!" For fresh
men Lauren Oster
and Nicolas Ruble,
this phrase has be
come all too familiar.

The couple lives in Donner together
and their "dormcest" has become fod
der for teasing and gossip throughout
the dorm.

"We were making the front page of
the gossip section," Oster said. "We
broke up for two days and everybody
knew. It was so embarrassing.
"Before, we were much more affec
tionate, but now we've learned, espe
cially with the resident assistant al
ways saying, 'No cuteness, no cute
ness,' she added.
Ruble agreed that they had to tone
down their public affection to avoid
awkward situations.
"It's a lot nicer when we're outside

the dorm because we can be more cou
ple-y," Oster said. "Weend up walking
to the movies a lot. The Marguerite is
our friend."
Freshmen Laurel Whitnah and
Richard Tan share the same Roble
hallway and humanities track in the
Cultures Ideas and Values program.
They spent a lot of time together as
friends before they started dating.
"Once, we talked the whole night,"

Whitnah said. "He asked me if I
was interested in anyone here, and
I told him the truth. Within two
days, everyone knew."
For Whitnah and Tan, though,
the teasing started long before the
relationship did.
"Before we were even going out,
people would tease us and say,
'Where's your other half?' " Whit
nah said.
Whitnah and Tan have also
kept the affection to a minimum in
public areas of the dorm.
"Separately, we're not totally
public people, anyway," Whitnah
said.
Junior Pat Chinnavaso, who
started dating sophomore Imelda
Unibe last year when the two
lived in Burbank, agreed that
having a private relationship is
nearly impossible when living in

the same dorm.
"There's a lot more rumors be
cause everyone knows both peo
ple," Chinnavaso said. "It's hard
to make the relationship private.
It's more scrutinized."
Living in the same dorm also
makes it harder for the individuals
to have their own space.
"If one of us got mad, it was
hard to be alone," said Chinnava
so. "You have to leave the dorm in
stead of just going to your own
room. After a while, sometimes
you want some space. You want to
talk to people that don't know her
about your side."
This lack of space can some
times mean that studying and
extra curricular activities take sec
ond priority.
"There's always that tempta
tion to drop everything and go
down the hall," Tan said. "I man
age to get all my outside activities
done anyway, but it has interfered
slightly with homework."
Chinnavaso, who sang in the

Mendicants last year, said his par
ticipation in the group probably
suffered because of his relation
ship.
"I might have been less enthu
siastic about the Mendicants be
cause I wanted to spend time with
her," he said. "It's harder to keep
up with all your activities."
Balance must also be found be
tween the relationship and
friendships with other dorm resi
dents.
"It's really exclusive some
times," Oster said. "People think
they should give you more space. It
isolates you. We're 'Nick and Lau
ren' now. We're one."
Even at meals, Oster and Ruble
have noticed this isolation.
"We're at the table by our
selves, and people feel they
shouldn't join us because it's a pri
vate thing, which it's not," Oster
said.
Unibe agreed that her relation
ships with others in the dorm
might have suffered because of her

dormcest.
"I might not have gotten to
know as many people," she said.
Dormcest does have a lot of ben
efits, though, with proximity
ranking near the top.
"It's really handy, especially
going to meals," Ruble said. "If
you want to say goodnight, it's not
going all the way across campus."
Whitnah and Tan agreed that
living together takes away some of
the pressure sometimes associated
with relationships.
"You don't have to plan to
spend time together," Whitnah
said. "You don't have to have
dates."
Having mutual friendships
with others in the dorm is also a
major benefit of dormcest.
"You can have the same
friends," Whitnah said. "If we
lived in separate dorms, and I vis
ited him all the time, my room
mate would be mad that I'm
spending time with him."
Instead, Whitnah and Tan

spend a lot of time in her room,
and Tan and her roommate have
become good friends. Whitnah
said she feels lucky that the three
get along so well.
"There's a lot of opportunity
for problems if the roommates
aren't very tolerant," she said.
Roommates and Draw-groups
are currently on the minds of the
freshmen couples, as they decide
whether to Draw together.
Whitnah and Tan plan to form
a co-ed Daw group together. Oster
and Ruble said they want to be in a
large co-ed Draw group together
also. They are afraid of drawing as
just a couple because of the possi
bility of breaking up.
Chinnavaso and Unibe decided
not to draw together because of
the likelihood of getting split up
and the desire to live with friends.
Unibe now lives in Soto, and Chin
navaso lives in Storey. Unibe said
drawing separately was probably
the right decision.
"I like both, but with living

apart its easier to have your own
independence," she said. "You
spend more quality time than
quantity."
Chinnavaso said living apart
has its ups and downs.
"It's easier for me to concen
trate on my work, but I miss her a
lot and don't like the space," he
said.
Dormcest has become infamous
around campus for one issue: the
break-up. If couples end their rela
tionship, running into each other
every day in the dorm can be diffi
cult.
Oster and Ruble said they have
considered this possibility.
"I think it would definitely be
strange," Oster said. "He's defi
nitely part of my concept of Stan
ford now."
Tan said he has considered this
possibility as well, but isn't very
concerned about it.
"I think both of us are responsi
ble enough to be cordial and polite
with each other," he said.

spend a lot of time in her room,
and Tan and her roommate have
become good friends. Whitnah
said she feels lucky that the three
get along so well.
"There's a lot of opportunity
for problems if the roommates
aren't very tolerant," she said.
Roommates and Draw-groups
are currently on the minds of the
freshmen couples, as they decide
whether to Draw together.
Whitnah and Tan plan to form
a co-ed Daw group together. Oster
and Ruble said they want to be in a
large co-ed Draw group together
also. They are afraid of drawing as
just a couple because of the possi
bility of breaking up.
Chinnavaso and Unibe decided
not to draw together because of
the likelihood of getting split up
and the desire to live with friends.
Unibe now lives in Soto, and Chin
navaso lives in Storey. Unibe said
drawing separately was probably
the right decision.
"I like both, but with living

apart its easier to have your own
independence," she said. "You
spend more quality time than
quantity."
Chinnavaso said living apart
has its ups and downs.
"It's easier for me to concen
trate on my work, but I miss her a
lot and don't like the space," he
said.
Dormcest has become infamous
around campus for one issue: the
break-up. If couples end their rela
tionship, running into each other
every day in the dorm can be diffi
cult.
Oster and Ruble said they have
considered this possibility.
"I think it would definitely be
strange," Oster said. "He's defi
nitely part of my concept of Stan
ford now."
Tan said he has considered this
possibility as well, but isn't very
concerned about it.
"I think both of us are responsi
ble enough to be cordial and polite
with each other," he said.
