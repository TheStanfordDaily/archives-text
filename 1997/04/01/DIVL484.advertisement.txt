DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH AND ITALIAN
and the SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
1997 Spring Quarter Courses in Engineering and French
These courses are all given in French with flexible units and meeting times. The
meeting time indicated is intended to be a first "organizational" meeting to
determine the best course meeting times for all concerned.
French and Engineering 129, Advances of Technology in Europe: Bio-
Engineering. Engineering in biology and medicine. How engineering —
particularly electrical engineering — and applied mathematics are used in
biological research and development; how engineering, electronics,
mathematics and physics conjoin to serve diagnostic procedures for the human
bio-organism.
Visiting Professor of French and Engineering, Gerard Prieur. 2-4 units. The
first official meeting time as announced in the time schedule will be on
Wednesday, April 2 at 11:00 am in Bldg. 200, Room 13, but there will also be a
short one-time "organizational" meeting on Friday, April 4 at 12:15 in Bldg. 260,
Room 216 to accommodate as many students as possible.
French 100.1. Technocritique. (also listed as "Technology and Philosophy" in
the Spring lime Schedule) The French tradition of social and philosophical
criticism of technology; the apparent contradiction between being often at the
forefront of technological and scientific development and the demand for
prudence, because technological development is not always perceived as a
synonym of social and moral progress.
Professor of French and Political Science, Jean-Pierre. Dupuy, 3-5 units.
Organizational Meeting: Wednesdays at 12:30 in Bldg. 260, Room 244
French 50m. French Discussion Section of Engineering 50, Introductory
Science of Materials
Instructor: Martin Volatier 1-3 units. Organizational Meeting: to be
announced at first meeting of Engineering 50
For students in the French and Engineering program, Professor Jean-Jacques Chariot (Ecole Nationale
Suptrieure des Telfcommuinications-ENST) will be on campus Thursday, April 10, to meet individually
with students regarding internships in France. Please contact Susan Goforth-Mauthes (Bldg. 260, Room
220) to make an appointment (email: goforthfaleland.stanford.edu) or phone: 723-0773.
