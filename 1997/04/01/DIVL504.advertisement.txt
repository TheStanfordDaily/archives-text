COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
SPRING QUARTER COURSES
10. EGYPTIAN EAST/EGYPTIAN WEST
MWF 10 a.m. Encina Hall, Food Research Wing, Rm 1 Thomas Hare
Egypt as seen in the work of prominent Egyptologists through cosmonical, ethical, philosophical and
imaginative texts left behind by the ancient Egyptians. Egypt as a reflection of contemporary
attitudes about gender, language, and multiplicity.
204. SEMINAR: ETHNICITY AND LITERATURE
(FOR SOPHOMORES ONLY)
TTh 11-12:30 p.m. Bldg. 260, Rm 008 David Palumbo-Liu
Introduction to the concept of ethnicity and the nature of literary form in this context through an
examination of how people deemed "ethnic" have expressed social identities in literary texts.
260. FERNANDO PESSOA, MODERNITY, AND THE RHETORIC OF HETERONYMITY
Th 3:15-6:05 p.m. Bldg. 260, Rm 001 Miguel Tamen
Fernando Pessoa, the great Portuguese Modernist poet, wrote under many different names in
several languages. In a famous letter, Pessoa refers to such identities as "heteronyms," that is, as
"other names." The specific problems heteronymity brings to a standard theory of authorship will be
discussed. (No knowledge of Portuguese or previous acquaintance with
Pessoa'spoetry are required.)
310. TAKING TIME
T 12:30-3:05 p.m. Bldg. 200, Rm 107 Richard Terdiman
This seminar will consider how prominent literary texts since the Enlightenment, and important
contemporary models in cultural theory, have represented the materiality of time: that refractory,
irreducible condition of existence by which things in human life — work, writing, change,
understanding — "take time." Time's construction and its depiction have been crucial
issues for modernity.
