# Loan check problem causes delay in classes
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
On your way to class? Don't bother.
Because of a foul up in issuing loan
checks yesterday, the University has de
layed the start of classes until tomorrow.
Checks issued to students paying their
University bills yesterday were printed on
the wrong paper, and banks will not ac
cept them, University Registrar Roger
Printup said yesterday.

"We apologize sincerely for any prob
lems this may have caused," Printup said,
adding that banks and credit unions have
been notified that the checks are no good
and students will not be penalized for de
positing them
Staff members worked late last night
to prepare new checks, which can be
picked up starting at 11 a.m. today in the
Oak Room at Tresidder Union, Printup
said.
Because the mix-up will keep so many

students busy, Printup
and the deans of the
schools decided it would
be impractical to begin
classes today.
"Yes, it's confusing,"
admitted Dean of the
School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven.
"I'm not even sure
whether I have to be at
work tomorrow."

Students last night were unhappy wit h
what some called "yet another example of
the corporatization of the University."
"Universities are for students," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson,
who initiated the ASSU President's Of
fice's "Universities for Students" cam
paign. "Starting classes on Wednesdays is
probably proven to improve U.S. News
rankings."
But Printup insisted that the mistake
was an honest one, committed when staff

members removed an older box of checks
from a storage closet. The checks have
none of the safety features required by
banks.
Matthew ()liver, a spokesman for Wells
Fargo Bank, explained that without the
features there is no way to prove a check's
legitimacy. To avoid problems, banks sim
ply refuse to accept checks that are print
ed incorrectly.
