# IM athletes upset over field access
## 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
Recreational athletes are work
ing with the department of athlet
ics to increase the field space for
non-varsity usage.
The Athletics Department,
which in the past few years has re
stricted access of its fields to varsi
ty sports — in the case of football,
even during the off-season —
plans to rearrange fields to free
space for intramural sports.
Hey ward Robinson, a research
associate in electrical engineering
and an avid sportsman, is leading a
publicity campaign to raise aware
ness of perceived Athletics Depart
ment neglect toward non-varsity
athletes. Robinson and 100 others
recently sent a letter of protest to
Athletic Director Ted Leland ask
ing the Athletics Department to
clarify its priorities.
"People are very upset," Robin
son said. "There is a long dialogue

to be had which is long overdue.
Unfortunately, a lot of things,
once in motion, are difficult to
stop," he added, referring to some
of the University's field construc
tion projects such as a new varsity
soccer field being built on the IM
North fields.
Andrei Straumanis, a graduate
student in chemistry and an ulti
mate Frisbee player, felt "margin
alized" by the fact that "10 percent
of the athletes on campus seem to
get 90 percent of the resources.. ..
All of us are paying tuition, we're
members of the community, and
the facilities are for us as well."
Asst. Director of Facilities and
Operations Ray Purpur said the
University is not haphazardly re
moving IM field space and reallo
cating the space to varsity ath
letes.
"What part of the master plan is
to turn the IM North field into a
soccer field, the old soccer field into
a field hockey field and then free up
the IM South fields for intramu
rals," Purpur said.
A long-range goal is to group
most or all the intramural fields
together, increasing the conve
nience for intramural players, he
said.
Purpur said that a committee
that formulated recommendations
to both the Athletics Department
and the University had equal rep
resentation from all athletic inter
ests on campus.

Ajai Daridekar, a senior and ac
tive recreational athlete, was un
aware of the committee, comprised
of representatives from IM sports,
club sports, varsity sports and stu
dents in general, and felt that "the
University is totally blocking us
out of the decision-making
process."
"Whether these people |on the
committee] keep the campus in
formed is their job," Purpur
said.
After meeting with Leland and
Purpur at the end of last quarter,
Robinson said he was impressed by
the Athletic Department's "gen
uine attention" to student con
cerns and its willingness to in
crease the availability of Stanford

field space.
At the meeting, Robinson sug
gested both long-term and short
term ideas that could help improve
the general usage field conditions.
The University has done a good
job with providing opportunities
and facilities to non-varsity ath
letes, Purpur said.
"We've increased the Arrillaga
weight room from 6,000 to 19,000
square feet and introduced sand
volleyball courts," he said. "We are
also adding some tennis courts,
and have hired an athletic turf
manager to keep the fields in better
shape. No matter what we do, the
demand is still high because of the
thousands of students on cam
pus."
