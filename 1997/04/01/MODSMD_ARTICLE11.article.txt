# Phi Delta Theta to become dry in 2000
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Three years from now, the Phi
Delta Theta house may look a lit
tle different from most people's
image of a fraternity house. The
fraternity's national organization
has banned all alcoholic drinks in
its houses, beginning in 2000.
Robert Deloian, the chairman
of Phi Delt's General Council, said
in a statement that the decision
stemmed from a desire to promote
the "core principles" of the organi
zation, which he said included pro
moting friendship, academic
achievement, community service
and leadership.
"Abuse of alcohol among col
lege undergraduates endangers
these principles," Deloian said.
"Too often, the fraternity experi
ence today is defined by alcohol.

We risk losing our purpose."
The ban does not come as par
ticularly welcome news to Phi
Delts at Stanford.
"We obviously like the status
quo," said senior Benjamin Rada,
Phi Delt's president, referring
particularly to the function of fra
ternities as venues for open cam
pus parties. "The way things are,
alcohol is a big part of that," he
added.
Rada said, however, that the
Stanford chapter of Phi Delt had
always followed the direction of its
national organization, and that he
expected it to conform to the
liquor ban.
He attributed the national or
ganization's action mostly to a de
sire to "look good in the public's
eye" by promoting a new image of
the Greek system and also said
that the move was designed to help
lower the high insurance costs na
tional fraternities now face.
Rada said the eventual action
was made by "a select few mem
bers" and did not necessarily rep
resent the feelings of many
branches of the fraternity. He ac
knowledged, however, that indi
vidual chapters had been given op
portunity to add their voices.
The decision will not affect any
current active members but will

affect this year's pledges. Rada
said, however, that he expected no
decline in pledge numbers be
cause of the decision.
Heather Dunn, assistant direc
tor of student activities, said it
was too soon for her to comment
directly but said it would be "in
teresting to see the process that
the national organizations will
take to help the students."
The ban will make Phi Delt the
first designated alcohol-free hous
ing option on campus. Although
several universities nationwide
have experimented with making
certain dorms "substance-free,"
Dunn said Stanford has no imme
diate plans for such housing.

If such housing were to begin,
Dunn said, it would likely be be
cause of student rather than ad
ministrative action. She added
that she did not know of any other
housed fraternities on campus
that were planning such a move.
The national organization of
Sigma Nu has also decided to ban
liquor in its houses, but that fra
ternity is unhoused at Stanford.
As for the Phi Delts, the
prospect of becoming the only al
cohol-free house on campus did
not seem a matter for great con
cern to current members.
Junior Dan Zimbaldi said,
"We'll all be long gone and laugh
ing."
