Sweeping reforms to the Uni
versity's judicial charter appear
to be headed for a spot on the bal
lot in the April 16-17 ASSII Gen
eral Election.
The Committee of 15, a group
commissioned last year by Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper to study and propose
changes to the existing judicial
charter, released the proposed
new charter last week.
The new charter, which pro

governs alleged violations of the
Honor Code, Fundamental Stan

is immediately informed, and for
the next six weeks a judicial offi

presents evidence to the panel
investigates the facts.
Currently, a student has no
method of defending himself
against the charges. In the new
system, an accused student may
"answer the charges, call wit
nesses on his behalf and cross-ex
amine those giving testimony
against him."
If the panel finds the student
guilty, then sanctions, also deter
mined by the panel, are imposed
and the student is notified. The
entire process is designed to take
about 10 weeks.
