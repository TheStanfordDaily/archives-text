# Committee of 15 reforms charter
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Sweeping reforms to the Uni
versity's judicial charter appear
to be headed for a spot on the bal
lot in the April 16-17 ASSII Gen
eral Election.
The Committee of 15, a group
commissioned last year by Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper to study and propose
changes to the existing judicial
charter, released the proposed
new charter last week.
The new charter, which pro
vides for the judicial system that
governs alleged violations of the
Honor Code, Fundamental Stan
dard and other University stu
dent conduct policies, is in the
midst of a four-tiered approval
process before it can go into ef
fect.
It appears to be ready to clear
the first three of those hurdles
within the next lew days.
The committee recommended
the creation of judicial panels to
hear all cases where there has
been an alleged violation of the
Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard. Four students and two
members of the faculty or stall'
will make up the panel.
A new Hoard on .Judicial Af

fairs, a standing committee of six
students, six faculty and three
staff members, will oversee all as
pects of judicial affairs.
The committee also developed
judicial procedures that would he
more st •"• "-.lined and less drawn
out and bureaucrat ic.
The charter outlines a proce
dure where a complaint must he
fded within 60 days of the date
the evidence of the alleged viola
tion was discovered. The student
is immediately informed, and for
the next six weeks a judicial offi
cer — a designated person who
presents evidence to the panel
investigates the facts.
Currently, a student has no
method of defending himself
against the charges. In the new
system, an accused student may
"answer the charges, call wit
nesses on his behalf and cross-ex
amine those giving testimony
against him."
If the panel finds the student
guilty, then sanctions, also deter
mined by the panel, are imposed
and the student is notified. The
entire process is designed to take
about 10 weeks.
The ASSIJ Senate decided last
month that the burden of proof

will remain "beyond a reasonable
doubt."
This week, the charter is expect
ed to be approved by the ASSU
Senate, the Faculty Senate and
Casper. Students must approve
the charter by a two-thirds majori
ty for it to become law.
Geophysics Prof. Mark
Zoback, who chaired the commit
tee, feels that the current judicial
system does not adequately serve
its purpose. He was pleased with
the committee's recommenda
tions.
"The committee managed to
come up with a system that we re
ally felt was fair to everyone," he
said.
ASSU Senator Howard Loo, a
junior who served on the commit
tee, shared Zoback's feelings. He
said the new charter's main
strength lies in its use of students
as key players in the system.
"The central aspect of this new
system is student involvement,"
he said. "Students are nowhere in
the (current) process."
Support for the charter is far
from unanimous. The proposal has
drawn fire from a group calling it
self Students Have Rights, headed
by Hoover Institution Fellow Bill
Evers and UC-Berkeley Prof. Yale

Braunstein.
The group fears the new charter
will take away student rights and
promote malicious prosecution.
"This is the worst [proposal 1 in 30
years," Braunstein said.
Zoback called the charter a sig
nificant improvement over what
he felt was a flawed system. In the
"Background and Rationale"docu
ment that accompanies the char
ter, the committee sets out several
of these problems.
These include a lack of student
education about the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard, a low
amount of student involvement in
the judicial process and routine
faculty ignorance or circumven
tion of the process. In addition, the
committee felt that the process is
too time-consuming and complex,
that penalties are too rigid and
that the multiple roles of the Judi
cial Affairs Officer create a possible
conflict of interest.
Each of these issues has been
addressed, Zoback said. The com
mittee has created what it believes
to be a more streamlined, student
involving process that ultimately
puts the fate of an accused offend
er in student hands.
Sharing responsibility with stu
dents is essential, Zoback said. "If
you're going to have a trust-based
system like the Honor Code," he
said, "then everybody has to buy in."
Braunstein, however, feels that
too many blanket reforms were

made when only specific changes
were needed.
Specifically, he takes issue with
three provisions of the new char
ter. The first allows for an accused
student to have legal counsel at a
hearing but prohibits that counsel
from presenting evidence. Second,
it does not require the accusers to
testify, potentially denying the ac
cused the right of cross-exam ina
tion.
Most important, he believes
that members of the judicial panel,
four students and two faculty
members, could be "stacked"
against a defendant because pan
elists are not selected randomly
from the jury pool. Five out of six
are required to concur for a convic
tion.
Loo disagrees. Students in the
jury pool, he said, must be con
firmed by the ASSU Senate, and he
trusts that administrators will not
attempt to pick biased members.
"We have to have faith in the panel
pool," he said.
The proposed charter has also
drawn support from outside of the
committee. ASSU President Bill
Shen said he is "absolutely 100
percent in support of the recom
mendations. This is the most com
prehensive reform that the Stan
ford student body has seen in
years."
