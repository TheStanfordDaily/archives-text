writing on the Farm beginning fall quarter.
Wolff will lead the graduate program in fiction writ

Accordingto English Prof. John L'lleureux, who led
the search committee that extended the offer to Wolff,
the news has been received with great enthusiasm.
"Everyone from the provost on down is excited," he
said. "He is the most distinguished writer of short fic

The annoucement marks a victory for the Universi
ty, which had conducted a long campaign to woo the au

thor away from his New York homo.
"Wo have tried to hire him at various times in past,
years at any time we've had a search to" fill a vacancy,
L'lleuroux said. "But he had two children in private
schools and didn't want to transfer. Now, however, t hey
have both graduated, and he was movable and avail
able."
For Wolff, the relocation marks a return to familiar
surroundings.

Oxford University, he won Stanford's prosigious Wal
lace Stegner Fellowship, which provided him a small
stipend and the opportunity to spend two years on tin
Farm working on his writ ing.
