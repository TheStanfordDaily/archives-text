Accordingto English Prof. John L'lleureux, who led
the search committee that extended the offer to Wolff,
the news has been received with great enthusiasm.

The annoucement marks a victory for the Universi

"Wo have tried to hire him at various times in past,

schools and didn't want to transfer. Now, however, t hey
have both graduated, and he was movable and avail
able."
For Wolff, the relocation marks a return to familiar
surroundings.
