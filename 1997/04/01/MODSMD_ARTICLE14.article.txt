He or she may be the sophomore next
door, a drawmate, or a fellow biology
major. Neither can be just anyone, how
ever, because the section leaders of Com
puter Science 106 series are a select
group of approximately 50 undergrads
efficiently fluent in the programming
language C and all fundamentals of com
puter science.
Section leaders may face special is
sues while taking on the responsibility of
educating other undergraduates. Sopho
more Eric Yang, a chemistry major, said
most people can't imagine non-CS ma
jors section leading 106.
"As far as how the sectionees treat
me, I think they're a bit more critical at

the beginning, but I'm good enough
technically that it's generally not a prob
lem," he said. Yang enjoys helping peo
ple, and thought section leading would
be a good experience for his possible goal
of becoming a professor.
For junior Jennifer McGrath, section
leading is particularly relevant to her
concentration on education and technol
ogy for the symbolic systems major.
"Teaching is always something I like,
and there are few chances for under
grads to be involved in something like
this," she said.
McGrath also said although there are
more males in the applicant pool, the CS
staff try hard and do a good job getting fe
male section leaders.
"Hut it [gender issue! by no means

feels like an issue, by virtue of the fact
that if you're qualified, it's having the
ability, the technical know-how," she
said.
Another issue that may arise lies in
the dynamics of section leading students
of higher, graduate or even professional
levels.
"We're generally talking about CS,
which is knowledge based, so you forget
what class people are in," sophomore CS
major Rob Baesman said.
Yang and McGrath agreed that the
expected tension give way to the fact that
students believe that section leaders are
there because of their knowledge.
"The weirder thing is having people
