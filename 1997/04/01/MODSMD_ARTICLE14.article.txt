# Gettin' their kicks from 106

He or she may be the sophomore next
door, a drawmate, or a fellow biology
major. Neither can be just anyone, how
ever, because the section leaders of Com
puter Science 106 series are a select
group of approximately 50 undergrads
efficiently fluent in the programming
language C and all fundamentals of com
puter science.
Section leaders may face special is
sues while taking on the responsibility of
educating other undergraduates. Sopho
more Eric Yang, a chemistry major, said
most people can't imagine non-CS ma
jors section leading 106.
"As far as how the sectionees treat
me, I think they're a bit more critical at

the beginning, but I'm good enough
technically that it's generally not a prob
lem," he said. Yang enjoys helping peo
ple, and thought section leading would
be a good experience for his possible goal
of becoming a professor.
For junior Jennifer McGrath, section
leading is particularly relevant to her
concentration on education and technol
ogy for the symbolic systems major.
"Teaching is always something I like,
and there are few chances for under
grads to be involved in something like
this," she said.
McGrath also said although there are
more males in the applicant pool, the CS
staff try hard and do a good job getting fe
male section leaders.
"Hut it [gender issue! by no means

feels like an issue, by virtue of the fact
that if you're qualified, it's having the
ability, the technical know-how," she
said.
Another issue that may arise lies in
the dynamics of section leading students
of higher, graduate or even professional
levels.
"We're generally talking about CS,
which is knowledge based, so you forget
what class people are in," sophomore CS
major Rob Baesman said.
Yang and McGrath agreed that the
expected tension give way to the fact that
students believe that section leaders are
there because of their knowledge.
"The weirder thing is having people
you know in your sectionâ€”it can't
help but change the way you re
late to someone," McGrath said.
"You try to separate the role as
section leader and friend."
Yang also considered section
leading friends not a problem as
long as he thinks of someone he
knows as just another student.
"In general, it's cool having
friends in your section because
you get direct feedback. But there
are people who I see too much on
a daily basis, and I wouldn't want
them in my section, because it
would be too hard to detach,"
Yang said.
If a problem persists, McGrath
pointed out the options of switch
ing sections early in the quarter
and appealing grades to the TAs.
She explained that grading is
based on a set of "fairly objective
criteria."
According to Yang, students
do complain on occasion, al
though most cases are not justi
fied. "I just have to try and justi
fy my reasoning and hope they're
open to it,"he said. "The most
difficult experience for me has
been returning programs to dis
gruntled students."
For Baesman, the hardest
thing to deal with is having a stu
dent who he knows makes great
efforts but still cannot grasp
something.
"Your heart just goes out to
them; as a section leader, you re
ally become an emotional sup
porter," he said.
Winter quarter 1068 lecturer
Bob Plummer believes the high
time commitment and the grad
ing of programs are not easy for
section leaders.
Aside from leading a weekly
section, section leading tasks also
include grading programs and
exams and holding office hours in
Tresidder LaIR. They meet week
ly with the lecturers / professors
to go through course related ma
terial, Plummer added.
"I think the role of the section
leader is to provide a level of per
sonal contact and assistance that
can't be provided in lecture,"
Plummer said.
Junior Minnie Ingersoll, one
of two CS 198 coordinators in
charge of hiring 106 section
leaders, said the hiring process

begins the middle of each quar
ter. Applicants must have com
pleted 1068, 106X or an equiva
lent course.
All section leaders start out
in 106 A and take CS 198,
"Teaching Computer Science,"
a four unit workshop that coor
dinators like Ingersoll teach.
Section leaders may go on to
1068 and X as an undergrad,
but TAs and 198 coordinators
are usually graduate students,
according to Ingersoll.
There are distinctions in sec
tion leading different 106 classes.
Baesman, who worked in 1068
winter quarter, said because
those students all have computer
science experience, there is more
flexibility to stretch their limits
than in 106 A. Yang also enjoyed
teaching students with more pro
gramming experience. Leading
106X last quarter gave him the
opportunity to "teach faster and
focus on more advanced topics.
"However, I don't really like
section leading 106X because the
students are more arrogant about
their abilities, and you don't really
get a chance to truly help those stu
dents who need it most," he said.
McGrath added that 106 A has
the best support for students with
the sections and two to three sec
tion leaders in the LaIR at any
time to help.
"There's nothing else on Stan
ford like it as far as I know," she
said. McGrath also stressed the
support network for section lead
ers and all the behind the scenes
meetings.
"There's a whole structure
building around the section lead
ing program," McGrath said.
According to Ingersoll, there
are three TAs and lecturers or pro
fessors, one for each 106 class, two
198 coordinators and one faculty
advisor. She also explained the dif
ference between TAs and section
leaders. TAs work closely with the
professor or lecturer, while sec
tion leaders develop a close rela
tionship with their six to 13 stu
dents.
Aside from all section leaders
take on, what impresses Plummer
most is their enthusiasm and com
mitment.
"They are interested in the
progress of their students and
take great pride in their students'
success," he said. "All this quickly
rubs off on the students, and it
plays a big role in making the
courses successful."
