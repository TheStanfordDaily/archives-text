# Students research aid in Haiti
## 
### Nathan Gillespie Contributing writer 
Two Stanford students spent a week in
Haiti last month on a medical aid trip spon
sored by Miles to Go, a student organiza
tion for international development found
ed by Stanford alumnus John Randazzo.
Randazzo and the two students did
fieldwork in preparation for a more exten
sive aid trip to Haiti this summer.
"We were getting a sense of what the
public health care system is like in Haiti
and developing contacts for this summer's
project," said Randazzo.
Randazzo, first-year medical student
Jeanie Chang and senior Meredith Mc-
Morrow went to Ranquitte, a small village
of 1,500 on the poverty-stricken Caribbean
Island. The three also donated two boxes of
aid to a hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's
capital.

Randazzo founded Miles to Go as a stu
dent organization on the Stanford campus
three years ago, and it has since developed
into a nonprofit organization with multiple
branches.
Miles to Go is devoted to improving the
process of humanitarian aid through its
two primary missions, Randazzo said:
"First, to encourage hospitals to reuse sup
plies they no longer have any need for, that
we can send to developing countries where
people are dying. And second, to educate
students about international development
by putting them in the field."
I.ast year, Miles to Go collected used
and recycled medical supplies from Hay
Area hospitals for use in Bosnia, where
medical aid was desperately needed. Ac
cording to McMorrow, the I laiti trip repre
sents the organization "trying to branch
out, to see where else Stanford students
and supplies can be most useful."

Plans for this year include a return to
Bosnia as well as missions to Haiti,
Ecuador and possibly the West Hank. The
I laiti project will consist of a small team of
Stanford medical students and undergrad
uates working in Port-au-Prince. They will
deliver aid products gathered from Ameri
can hospitals and then work with Haitian
doctors to treat the sick.
They will also set up a medical library at
the capital's main hospital with excess
medical journals from the Stanford Med
ical School's I .ane I jibnii^.
Haiti, one of the world's p(x>rest coun
tries, has been ravaged by political violence
in recent years. It has the highest infant
mortality rate and the lowest life expectan
cy — 44.6 years — in the Western Hemi
sphere.
Ranquitte, the village students visited
on the trip, is accessible only by sin
gle-engine planes or by a long over
land truck journey. The level of
poverty in the isolated village is as
tounding. "The extent to which the

rural communities are impover
ished [isJ something I've never seen
before," said Randazzo.
Participating in the Miles to Go
aid trip is "a way to give something
back from everything we in America
have been given," said McMorrow.
"The worst conditions in the U.S.
are better than Haiti."
The aid workers are rewarded for

their efforts through the reactions of
the Haitian children. "The children
are so full of life. It's surprising,
given the conditions that they live in.
The human spirit is amazing," said
McMorrow.
Randazzo sees Miles to Go as a
positive force at home and abroad.
The group's efforts "have a national
and international impact. We're able

to reduce hospital waste here and im
prove the medical infrastructure of
needy countries."
Miles to Go is looking for in
creased student participation in its
aid projects. "What we need now is
people power," said Randazzo. Miles
to Go is holding an organizational
meeting Monday at 8 a.m. at Bechtel
International Center.
