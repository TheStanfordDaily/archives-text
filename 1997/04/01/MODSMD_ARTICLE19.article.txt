Stock market continues to fall
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks tumbled yesterday
and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to
its worst back-to-back point decline since the
1987 crash, raising concerns about the 6 l/2-year
bull market.
For a stock market that has been able to do lit
tle wrong, the event is enough to give pause. But,
analysts say, the bouts of selling may be part of a
market correction, a measured decline that while
painful, generally won't mean a prolonged erosion
in prices.
The Dow is now 7.1 percent, or 501.68 points,
below its record close of 7,085.16 on March 11.
But even with the two-day decline, it remains
ahead for the year, albeit just 2.1 percent.
"It's a necessary consolidation in an ongoing
bull market, as far as I'm concerned," said Peter
J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean
Witter Reynolds, a brokerage.
The market's main barometer plunged 157.11
points, or 2.3 percent, yesterday to 6,583.48. That
followed a 140.11-point drop Thursday and
brought the average's two-day loss to 297.22
points.
The decline also represented the index's sixth
biggest point decline in history. But the bull mar
ket remains intact, dating back to the fall of 1990,
when the Dow stood at about 2,360.
Selling from the Dow's high in early March
began with concerns that the Federal Reserve

would raise interest rates to forestall inflation,
which it finally did last Tuesday. At first, the mar
ket took it well.
On Thursday, though, prompted by some data
showing the economy was still going strong,
traders started dumping stocks. The market was
shut down for Good Friday.
Cable to carry broadcast stations
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government can
force cable television systems to carry local broad
cast stations, the Supreme Court said yesterday
in a decision that could serve as a stay of execu
tion for small, independent channels.
The 5-4 ruling rejected cable companies' argu
ment that a 1992 federal "must carry" law vio
lates their free-speech rights by forcing them to
carry stations they would rather drop.
The justices said the measure is a lawful effort
to preserve broadcast television and ensure public
access to information from a variety of sources.
More than 60 percent of American households
subscribe to cable TV. The decision means those
customers will continue to receive local broadcast
stations on their cable systems.
"Broadcast television is an important source of
information to many Americans," Justice Antho
ny M. Kennedy wrote for the court."For decades
now it has been an essential part of the national
discourse on subjects across the whole broad spec
trum of speech, thought and expression."
