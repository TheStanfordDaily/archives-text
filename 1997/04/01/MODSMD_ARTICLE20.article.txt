# McVeigh trial begins
## Security heightened as jury selection process starts 
### 
DENVER (AP) — In a courtroom protected by
barricades and armed guards, Oklahoma City bomb
ing defendant Timothy McVeigh gazed intently at
potential jurors yesterday as they spoke of their will
ingness to impose the death penalty for the deadliest
terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil.
McVeigh, wearing a buzz haircut, an open-col
lared blue shirt and khakis, smiled and shook his
attorney's hand as he was brought into the court
room from a basement holding cell for the start of
jury selection. He nodded and mouthed "Good
morning" through a smile when the judge intro
duced him to jurors.
But during detailed and excruciatingly slow ques
tioning, McVeigh's glare tightened over his folded
hands as prospective jurors discussed how they
could recommend execution if he is convicted in the
April 19, 1995, blast that killed 168 people and
injured hundreds more.
"It's hard to place yourself in the role of deciding
the fate of another human being on these terms,"
said a middle-aged man identified only as No. 858.
"Yet there has to be some ultimate price to pay."
The man, a self-employed financial adviser, said
he has not formed an opinion about McVeigh but
believes there may be other suspects who have not
been arrested. "There are elei <mts, potentially peo
ple out there that are ancilk ' to this case, that
might want to make their strength and presence
felt," he said.
The second prospective juror questioned, a grand

mother in her 60s, said her dominant memory of
McVeigh was the footage of him in an orange jail
jumpsuit being led out of a county jail in Oklahoma.
"I felt very sorry for him," she said. "For such a
young man to waste his life."
McVeigh attorney Stephen Jones then asked:
"You didn't feel sorry because they arrested the
wrong man?"
"I didn't know," she said.
As the prospective jurors took the stand to talk
about everything from their view of the justice sys
tem to their opinions on the O.J. Simpson case, they
were hidden behind a partial wall from nearly every
one in the audience section of the courtroom. U.S.
District Judge Richard Matsch has promised the
prospective jurors that their privacy will be protect
ed during the questioning.
Given the slow pace — only four potential jurors
were questioned by midafternoon — it could take
two weeks or more for lawyers to choose 12 jurors
and six alternates from a pool of hundreds, and all
those picked must be willing to consider the death
penalty as punishment.
Heightened security was evident at the stone
and-glass courthouse, which is ringed by concrete
barriers, huge stone planters and temporary metal
fences. Police officers on foot, on horseback and in
cruisers made regular passes around the complex,
and at least one sharpshooter, wearing military
fatigues, was stationed at the top of a parking struc
ture across the street.
