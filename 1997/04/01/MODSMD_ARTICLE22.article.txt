## Editorial Evaluation criteria 
### 
The Daily will use these
guidelines when making
special-fee endorsments

THE ASSU'S SPRING Gen
eral Election is fast
approaching, and students
will soon be voting on whether to
fund each of the 30 student groups
seeking special fees.
As usual, The Daily's Editorial
Board will make recommendations
on each group based on the budgets
and goals the group has submitted
for consideration. Sometimes these
endorsements are controversial but
making them is still an important
part of The Daily's mission.
Many students do not have the
time to fully scrutinize a group's
budget and weigh the costs against
the group's contribution to the
campus — and to repeat this pro
cess 30 times, once for each fee
seeking group. It is for this reason
that The Daily's Editorial Board
feels obliged to endorse special
fees. To make informed endorse
ments the board plans to meet with
representatives from each of the
groups before the election to dis
cuss the groups' budgets and goals.
At least three of the Editorial
Board's eight members will meet
with each group; the entire board
will discuss each special-fee applica
tion and make a recommendation.
Ideally, these recommendations
will help students think more
clearly and critically about student
groups before they vote. The
endorsements are not meant to
take the place of students thinking
for themselves, however. We
encourage all voters to read the
Elections Handbook when it is dis
tributed and to look at the groups'
budgets for themselves.
To help our readers — and the
student groups in question — bet
ter understand The Daily's recom
mendations, here are the criteria
that will be used to evaluate fee

requests. These are based in part
on the criteria listed in the ASSU
Bylaws for the senate Appropria
tions Committee, which makes
recommendations on special-fee
groups to the full senate:
• Does the group provide a good
value for the dollar?
• Does the group make a consci
entious and reasonably successful
effort to involve and serve a signif
icant portion of the student body
population that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate
initiative in self-funding; that is,
does its budget indicate that the
group is actively seeking revenue
sources other than the special fee,
such as outside fund raising or
working for the Stanford Fund?
• Has the group responded to its
refund rate and the results of last
year's election? For example, a
group that failed to receive its fee
last year should be able to show
how it adjusted its budget or activ
ities to better serve its audience.
• Should the student body popu
lation targeted to fund the group's
special fee — not the University, a
different population or other par
ties — be financing the group?
Fee-seeking groups are permitted
to request funds from only specific
sub-populations of the student
body; a group's decision to solicit
funding from only one sub-popula
tion, like undergraduates, should
have an explanation.
Special-fee groups should be
aware that they will be evaluated
on an individual basis and that
these criteria are intentionally
vague and open to interpretation.
For example, a community-service
group which neither involves large
numbers of students nor targets
its services to the student body
might nonetheless be worthwhile
because of the service opportuni
ties it creates and the positive
impact it has on the community in
which all students live.
The Daily welcomes responses
to its endorsements and will pub
lish them on a space-available
basis during election week.
