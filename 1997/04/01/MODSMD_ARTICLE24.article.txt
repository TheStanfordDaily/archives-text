## The 						politics of fornication 
### 
AS I DROVE across the Arizona
desert this spring break, I start
ed to feel the Easter spirit. I felt
the need for some spiritual guidance,
and I took it as a divine sign that my
radio could find only one station. So for
three hours, I tuned in to the Christian
tunes of KLRD, known as K-Lord to the
true believers.
Alas, instead of guidance, I was hand
ed an indictment. In the midst of a 40
minute set of Petra, I got to hear a
preacher's impassioned polemic about
"morality." It turns out that I, along with
most of America's youth, am a sinner.
Not only am I a blasphemer, but I fall
into the category of the dreaded f-word.
Fornicator.
Now this wasn't the first time that
I've been confronted by my supposed
immorality. The recent national discus
sion of "family values" has spawned
many old men hoping to dictate our
amorous agenda. Bill Bennett's "Book
of Virtues" doesn't leave much room for
my sexual ethic, and Robert Bork is con
vinced that I am "Slouching Toward
Gomorra." The conservative rhetoric
doesn't surprise me, and I've seen
enough self-serving hypocrisy and selec
tive Biblical quotation to take it all with
a pillar of salt.
What did surprise me, though, is when
I heard the same recalcitrant mantra
from my liberal-cum-centrist president.
Check out page 4 of the March 1 San

Francisco Chronicle. It turns out that
the Clinton administration is planning
to spend $250 million of the new welfare
bill preaching the pleasures of absti
nence to Americans.
Don't get me wrong. I think that
that's a worthy idea. I firmly believe that
we live in a time when having sex often
has too little to do with making love and
that the last thing a welfare recipient
needs is a child to support.
However, Clinton intends to send a
different message. Thanks to his policy,
we're now going to learn that engaging
in sex before marriage "is likely to have
harmful psychological and physical
effects" and that abstinence from pre
marital sex "is the expected standard" of
human behavior.
Oh, really? What "standard" do we
really advocate? Most of our parents
didn't abstain, and from recent reports,
more than 90 percent of our generation
does not. We know that Bill didn't.
We don't, as a society, follow the
standard that we now want to set for
the poor. But for some reason,
hypocrisy in the sexual discussion is
acceptable. Our president has traded
his podium for a pulpit and now sees fit
to dictate our moral standards. He is
buying in to the Draconian dogma of
the religiously radical.
And we, the Democrats, will let him
do it. We're so scared of the conserva
tive blowhards that even when our

president fails to represent any of us we
chalk him up as a lesser evil and are just
thankful that Bob Dole does not live in
the White House.
But who do Clinton's standards real
ly represent? Maybe you don't like
labeling yourself, but if Bill considers
himself to represent the center and you
find his idea of appropriate sexuality to
be too conservative, what does that
make you?
President Bill will continue to trian
gulate himself away from the left if we
allow him to do so, and, my guess is,
future-President Gore, despite his neo
environmentalist facade, will do the
same. It begins with our sexuality #nd
expands onward. U
My heart bleeds for my party, and it
bleeds liberally. The complacency that
President Clinton inspires in Democrats
has gone on for too long, and if his stat
ed views on sex don't convince you of
that, check him out on human rights in
China or the treatment of homosexuals.
President Clinton doesn't meet my
"expected standard" of behavior, and I
plan to actively abstain from supporting
his misguided agenda.

Rahul Young, a senior, plans to put his
public policy major to work and flaunt
the federal sexual code often.
