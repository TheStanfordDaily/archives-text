# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Here now, a defense of the not-so-shocking shock jock 
### 
YOU'RE GOING TO have to bear
with me for a bit; this column will
be markedly different from my
usual weekly rantings. This week I intend
not to justify any leftist or anti-military
views, and I intend not to tell you who my
friends are. Rather, I feel obligated to use
this space to make a public defense of a
great but unfairly maligned genius.
Many of you, I'm sure, have seen the
new Howard Stern movie, "Private
Parts." Something like 5 million Ameri
cans have seen it since it was released
the Friday before Dead Week. I saw it
that Saturday, the second day the film
was in theaters. I'm not a Howard Stern
fan; in fact I've almost never listened to
him despite having his home station,
New York's 92.3 K-Rock, nearly perma
nently tuned in on my car radio
throughout high school.
Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
It was funny, it was in some respects
touching and, much like "The People vs.
Larry Flynt," it presented its hero as a
noble First Amendment crusader.
You've got to love a film about a noble
First Amendment crusader, never mind
that neither Stern nor Flynt is one.
In Stern's portrayal of his own life
and times, he is painted as basically a
nice, decent guy, albeit with a slightly

ribald sense of humor. There've been
dozens of articles as part of the media
blitz surrounding the film's release (and
you know it's quite a blitz when even
the august New Yorker runs a glowing
profile of a shock jock with a seventh
grade sensibility), and in reading these
stories I've been convinced that it's not
merely a persona for the movie — Stern
truly is a nice, decent guy.
Weil, almost. You see, there's one
aspect of the movie that seems to me to
be nothing more than gratuitous mean
ness on Stern's part, and it is a mean
ness for which I'll have a very difficult
time forgiving him. You see, in "Private
Parts," Stern goes out of his way to paint
an unflattering and critical portrait of
my favorite radio personality of all time,
Don "The I-Man" Imus.
When, in the movie, Stern first
arrives at New York's WNBC, his new
boss takes him to meet then-top-rated,
afternoon drive time DJ Don Imus. The
I-Man, however, has no interest in
meeting Stern and verbally abuses him.
Since the film's release, Imus has made
no attempt to present his own version of
that story — as he freely admits, Stern's
arrival at WNBC coincided with the
height of Imus' drug-addicted days, and
Imus grants that Stern's version of

their first meeting is likely dead-on.
But Stern is not content to leave it at
that. Throughout the film, he goes on to
make subtle jibes about the I-Man, cele
brating when ratings of "The Howard
Stern Show" surpass those of the vener
able New York radio personality. In the
climactic final sequence, as Stern faces
throngs of adoring fans in New York's
Bryant Park, one of those fans — placed
conspicuously in the center of the film's
wide shots of the crowd — carries an
entirely gratuitous placard. "Imus
Sucks," it proclaims.
But, in actuality, Imus most certainly
does not suck. In my humble — and, of
course, correct — opinion, he is the best
radio talk-show host 011 the air.
It's a given that Imus' show will never
be a more popular than Stern's. After all,
the great unwashed masses that consti
tute America's listening public will
always prefer jokes about feces and les
bians to witty conversations with politi
cians and pundits. But, I like to think,
we at Stanford are most assuredly not
the unwashed masses.
Sure, Stern can be funny. But his
shtick quickly grows tiresome. Listening
to the "Imus in the Morning" program,
however, is always entertaining and,
even more surprisingly, enlightening.

The main "characters" of the show
are Imus; his loyal sidekick, Charles
(who always agrees with his boss but
does so with a note of irony); his produc
er, Bernie (generally a right-wing loon
but a very funny one); and his brother,
Fred (who appears on the show from his
home in Santa Fe, N.M.).
The most valuable cast member,
though, is impressionist Rob Bartlett,
who regularly contributes the voices of
Richard Nixon (the former president
has been dubbed "Imus in Washing
ton's senior political correspondent"),
Rush Limbaugh, Bill Clinton, Ted
Kennedy and even Howard Stern.
Often, Barlett's characters break into
song — yesterday morning I listened to
"Limbaugh" sing his own take on Garth
Brooks: "I've Got Friends with White
Faces." ("We all believe in the master
races," continues the refrain.)
But the real strength of Imus' show is
the caliber of guests who call in for a
chat. Senators are regulars — most
notably a recently retired gentleman
from Kansas called Bob Dole — as are
media celebrities like Dan Rather, Mike
Wallace, Frank Rich and Maureen
Dowd. In addition to Dole's numerous
visits, Bill Clinton's been on a few times.
(One of Candidate Clinton's finest

moments, when asked to define "bubba"
on the Now York-based radio show: "It's
Southern for mensch.")
Stern's movie was wonderfully
entertaining, and he's the nation's most
popular radio personality. I'm sure
you've all heard his antics a few times,
even if, like me, you assiduously avoid
his show. By all means you should go
see his movie — but nonetheless you
should listen to his competitor. It's time
to face the reality that we at Stanford
are card-carrying members of the cul
tural elite, and, as such, "Imus in the
Morning" is the show for us.
Imus is broadcast on KPIX 95.7 FM
in San Francisco. I still like the original
version, on New York's WFAN, the
best, if for no other reason than to hear
Imus' endless needling of traffic
reporter Eileen Marcasi Cohen. But it's
great to be able to listen to him every
morning (when I get up early enough)
here on the left coast. No doubt about
it, you should do the same.
