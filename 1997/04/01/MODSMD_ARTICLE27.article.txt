Bookstore thief at lar^e
Stanford Police plan to release a picture of a
man who allegedly stole $ 1,258 ol computer equip
ment from the Stanford Bookstore on March 24 if
he is not apprehended by Thursday
Stanford Police said the suspect is between 18
and 25 years old, 6 feet tall 160 pounds, and was
wearing khaki pants and a brown polo shirt with a
dark brown collar
"The suspect is most likely a Stanford student, '
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, the subject, carrying a
green backpack, walked into the Bookstore shortly
after 2 p.m. and walked into Microdisc, where the
computers are sold.
Bookstore personnel noticed that the man was
acting "suspiciously" and making "furtive move
ments," said Niemeyer.
The suspect then placed a JAZ Disk Drive and a
Sony Digital Still Camera in his backpack and
walked out of the bookstore without purchasing
the equipment.
After two Loss Prevention agents from the
Bookstore began to pursue the suspect, he imme
diately dropped the green backpack and ran away
toward Green Library.
The suspect has not been apprehended, but the
Niemeyer said he will display the suspect's picture,
captured on Bookstore surveillance footage if the
assailant does not turn himself in.
"We want to give him the opportunity to turn

himself in," said Niemeyer. "He has until 5 p.m. on
Thursday to do so before we run the photo."
Bike thieves caught
Two bicycle thieves from East Palo Alto were
apprehended Saturday night with the assistance of
watchful students and a police dog.
Two students called police around 11 p.m. and
reported that two suspicious-looking individuals
were looking at bicycles near Toyon Hall, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Stanford Police then "set-up a loose quadrant"
around this area in order to apprehend the sus
pects, Niemeyer said.
Deputy Mark Thomsen, first on the scene, saw
that the two juveniles were "carrying two locked
bicycles in the Toyon parking lot." When he began
to pursue them, the suspects promptly dropped the
bikes and ran toward Serra Street.
Deputy Bob Henderson caught one of the sus
pects near 855 Serra Street shortly thereafter, but
could not apprehend the other suspect.
Officer Dave Trujillo, who pursued the other
suspect with a police dog and, after he would not
stop, released the dog, who brought down the sus
pect and injured his thigh.
"This is another good example of vigilance of
students," said Niemeyer. "When we get coopera
tion from students, we can do some good."
Both individuals, one 16 and the other 17, were
released to their families.
