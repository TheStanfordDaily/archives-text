## Synchro just misses NCAA title 
### Scott Judd Contributing writer 
It was David against Goliath, and Goliath
won.
With only 11 qualifying swimmers com
pared to defending national champion Ohio
State's 28, Stanford's synchronized swimming
team needed to swim a perfect meet to capture
the NCAA crown. To most observers, the Car
dinal did. But it still wasn't enough.
In the most competitive and exciting colle
giate national synchronized swimming cham
pionship of the past decade, the previously
undefeated Cardinal squad fell 0.13 points
short of archrival Ohio State. Thirteen hun
dredths of a point short of ending Ohio State's
13-year reign as national champions. Thirteen
hundredths of a point short of capturing its
first-ever NCAA title.
"Losing was the closest thing to heartbreak

that isn't heartbreak," said senior co-captain
Maia Young. "We gave our best effort and did
all that we could do to win. Our swims looked
spectacular, but it just didn't translate into a
win on that day."
By a razor-thin margin, the Cardinal fin
ished second for the 10th time in 11 years. It
was a difficult end to a spectacular season, one
that saw Stanford turn in its best performance
ever at the March 16 national championships
in Florida.
Despite fielding a squad that was barely
one-third the size of Ohio State's, the Cardinal
still captured first-place finishes in A figures, B
figures, solo and trio. Seven of Stanford's 11
swimmers earned All-American honors, and
junior Heather Pease was named high point
winner of the meet. Also, while barely losing to
Ohio State, Stanford finished 24 points ahead
of third-place Canisius.
"It may have been David vs. Goliath, but

this time Goliath was very aware that David
was there," said assistant coach Andy Maisel.
"We really did have season-best swims from
everybody. We won four of the six events, and
the award stand was full of Stanford swim
mers. I have never been more proud of a team.
They did everything that a coaching staff could
ask for. Everyone gave perfect performances,
but in subjective sports like synchronized
swimming it comes down to lots of other vari
ables."
In this case, the variables were NCAA
judges, who had grown accustomed to seeing
perennial champion Ohio State take home the
national crown. Ohio State's vastly larger
squad meant that Stanford needed to counter
quantity with quality and win three of the four
routine events plus figures. This would be an
incredibly difficult task under any condition.
