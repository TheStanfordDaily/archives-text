## Synchro just misses NCAA title 
### Scott Judd Contributing writer 
It was David against Goliath, and Goliath
won.
With only 11 qualifying swimmers com
pared to defending national champion Ohio
State's 28, Stanford's synchronized swimming
team needed to swim a perfect meet to capture
the NCAA crown. To most observers, the Car
dinal did. But it still wasn't enough.
In the most competitive and exciting colle
giate national synchronized swimming cham
pionship of the past decade, the previously
undefeated Cardinal squad fell 0.13 points
short of archrival Ohio State. Thirteen hun
dredths of a point short of ending Ohio State's
13-year reign as national champions. Thirteen
hundredths of a point short of capturing its
first-ever NCAA title.
"Losing was the closest thing to heartbreak

that isn't heartbreak," said senior co-captain
Maia Young. "We gave our best effort and did
all that we could do to win. Our swims looked
spectacular, but it just didn't translate into a
win on that day."
By a razor-thin margin, the Cardinal fin
ished second for the 10th time in 11 years. It
was a difficult end to a spectacular season, one
that saw Stanford turn in its best performance
ever at the March 16 national championships
in Florida.
Despite fielding a squad that was barely
one-third the size of Ohio State's, the Cardinal
still captured first-place finishes in A figures, B
figures, solo and trio. Seven of Stanford's 11
swimmers earned All-American honors, and
junior Heather Pease was named high point
winner of the meet. Also, while barely losing to
Ohio State, Stanford finished 24 points ahead
of third-place Canisius.
"It may have been David vs. Goliath, but

this time Goliath was very aware that David
was there," said assistant coach Andy Maisel.
"We really did have season-best swims from
everybody. We won four of the six events, and
the award stand was full of Stanford swim
mers. I have never been more proud of a team.
They did everything that a coaching staff could
ask for. Everyone gave perfect performances,
but in subjective sports like synchronized
swimming it comes down to lots of other vari
ables."
In this case, the variables were NCAA
judges, who had grown accustomed to seeing
perennial champion Ohio State take home the
national crown. Ohio State's vastly larger
squad meant that Stanford needed to counter
quantity with quality and win three of the four
routine events plus figures. This would be an
incredibly difficult task under any condition.

one made even harder by the sub
jective nature of scoring synchro
nized swimming. And harder still
when two of the judges had
daughters on the Ohio State team.
Despite these challenges, Stan
ford nearly upset the nation's
most dominant synchronized
swimming team. Pease led the
charge for Stanford, capturing the
figures, solo and trio events and a
second-place finish in duet compe
tition. Pease, a gold medalist at
last year's Olympics, crushed her
opponents in the A figures and
solo events, winning by margins of
3.255 and 5.533, respectively. Two
Ail-Americans, senior Bridget
Finn and sophomore Vanessa
Shaw, joined Pease to capture the
trio crown, edging out Ohio State
by .133 points.
Because the Buckeyes had such
depth on their team, the meet was
decided by the duet competition.
Pease and Finn swam a focused
and vibrant routine to capture the
highest scores awarded in the
meet up to that point, a 98.133. It
came down to the last competitors
in that event — the Ohio State
duet of All-Americans Becky
Jasontek and Emily Marsh. After
swimming an enthusiastic but

technically marred routine, the
duet stunned Stanford by posting
a 98.267 tally — a score which
gave them a duet victory and
ensured that Ohio State's champi
onship reign would continue for at
least one more year.
"Entering duet, I thought we
were certain to do well there,"
Maisel said. "Our scores were a lit
tle lower than I thought they
should be, but I didn't think that
the competing team had the per
formance to beat us. We were
absolutely shocked when we saw
the final scores."
But even though the Cardinal
may have fallen short of toppling
Ohio State, this meet served
notice to the synchronized swim
ming world that Stanford is a true
competitor. With Ohio State los
ing seven of its top eight swim
mers next year and Stanford los
ing only four athletes, the Cardi
nal is in excellent position to final
ly bring home the NCAA title next
year.
"I can only see great things in
store for the program," Young
said. "This was a very deserving
team, a group of people who put
their hearts into something that
they loved. Often I wonder what I
did to deserve to be around them.
Our love for the sport stems from
the closeness of the team, and for
me that's been the greatest part of
the whole experience."
