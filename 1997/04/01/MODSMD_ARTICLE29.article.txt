## Wilkens captures an individual title 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
Punctuating a great season, the
Stanford men's swim team came
away from the 1997 NCAA Cham
pionships with the second-place
trophy, a proud coach and a bright
outlook on its future.
Auburn won the three-day
meet, which took place on March
27-29 at the Minnesota Aquatics
Center in Minneapolis. The War
Eagles' 496.5 points gave them
their first-ever NCAA swimming
championship over second-place
Stanford's 340.
The second-place finish to an
Auburn team that modeled itself
after Stanford's program before
becoming one of its rivals, was not
an easy pill to swallow for the Car
dinal. However, the swimmers and
coaches expressed pride in their
season and their performance at
the meet in Minneapolis.
"I'm so very proud of our guys,
not only as swimmers, but as rep
resentatives of Stanford and as
young men," said head coach Skip
Kenney after the meet. Kenney,
who has coached at Stanford for 18
years and was the 1996 head men's
Olympic coach in Atlanta last sum
mer expressed sentiments that
were echoed by other members of
the coaching staff.
"I'm pleased with the way the
guys presented themselves to the
meet," said volunteer assistant
coach and renowned stroke spe
cialist / guru Bill Boomer.
"Whether it was in warmups,
morning or evening swims, they
were organized and purposeful.
They were together as a group and
cared about each other."
Junior tri-captain Tom Wilkens

won his first NCAA individual title
in the 400-yard individual medley
on the night of the second day. In
one of the most exciting races of
the weekend, Wilkens came from
behind on the freestyle leg in the
last 100 yards of the race to over
take longtime rival Chris Babylon
of Georgia. What made the victory
all the more outstanding for
Wilkens was the fact that his
freestyle has traditionally been
considered his weakness in the
four-stroke event.
"One main change in my train -
ing this year had to do with my
freestyle," Wilkens said. "So I had
a lot more confidence in it."
Wilkens felt he owed some cred
it to his supporters for helping him
stay focused after his fiflh-place
finish in the 200 IM (1:46.57) the
day before.
"I have to thank the team,
(coaches) Skip and Ted, God, Kurt
(Grote) and the trainers, Rick
(Egelston) and Mike (Covert),"
Wilkens said. "After the first day,
my confidence wasn't as high as it
normally is, and the team and
coaches helped me keep it up."
Wilkens also was surprised at
the way he felt during the victory.
"You have in your mind what
you think a national championship
swim will feel like: You know, like
it will feel great, unstoppable,"
Wilkens said. "But my 400 IM
wasn't like that at all. It hurt all
the way. I think that made the race
more satisfying."
Over the course of the three-day
meet, the Stanford team picked up
momentum, having its best perfor
mances on the last day. In con
