# Men's swimming second at NCAAs
## Wilkens captures an individual title 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
Punctuating a great season, the
Stanford men's swim team came
away from the 1997 NCAA Cham
pionships with the second-place
trophy, a proud coach and a bright
outlook on its future.
Auburn won the three-day
meet, which took place on March
27-29 at the Minnesota Aquatics
Center in Minneapolis. The War
Eagles' 496.5 points gave them
their first-ever NCAA swimming
championship over second-place
Stanford's 340.
The second-place finish to an
Auburn team that modeled itself
after Stanford's program before
becoming one of its rivals, was not
an easy pill to swallow for the Car
dinal. However, the swimmers and
coaches expressed pride in their
season and their performance at
the meet in Minneapolis.
"I'm so very proud of our guys,
not only as swimmers, but as rep
resentatives of Stanford and as
young men," said head coach Skip
Kenney after the meet. Kenney,
who has coached at Stanford for 18
years and was the 1996 head men's
Olympic coach in Atlanta last sum
mer expressed sentiments that
were echoed by other members of
the coaching staff.
"I'm pleased with the way the
guys presented themselves to the
meet," said volunteer assistant
coach and renowned stroke spe
cialist / guru Bill Boomer.
"Whether it was in warmups,
morning or evening swims, they
were organized and purposeful.
They were together as a group and
cared about each other."
Junior tri-captain Tom Wilkens

won his first NCAA individual title
in the 400-yard individual medley
on the night of the second day. In
one of the most exciting races of
the weekend, Wilkens came from
behind on the freestyle leg in the
last 100 yards of the race to over
take longtime rival Chris Babylon
of Georgia. What made the victory
all the more outstanding for
Wilkens was the fact that his
freestyle has traditionally been
considered his weakness in the
four-stroke event.
"One main change in my train -
ing this year had to do with my
freestyle," Wilkens said. "So I had
a lot more confidence in it."
Wilkens felt he owed some cred
it to his supporters for helping him
stay focused after his fiflh-place
finish in the 200 IM (1:46.57) the
day before.
"I have to thank the team,
(coaches) Skip and Ted, God, Kurt
(Grote) and the trainers, Rick
(Egelston) and Mike (Covert),"
Wilkens said. "After the first day,
my confidence wasn't as high as it
normally is, and the team and
coaches helped me keep it up."
Wilkens also was surprised at
the way he felt during the victory.
"You have in your mind what
you think a national championship
swim will feel like: You know, like
it will feel great, unstoppable,"
Wilkens said. "But my 400 IM
wasn't like that at all. It hurt all
the way. I think that made the race
more satisfying."
Over the course of the three-day
meet, the Stanford team picked up
momentum, having its best perfor
mances on the last day. In con
trast, the sprinter-laden Auburn
team blasted out to a huge lead on
the first day, which it was able to
sustain with strong relays on the
following two days.
Stanford's first day started out
with the 200 medley relay team of
juniors Scott Claypool, Sabir
Muhammad, Chris Olson and Jed
Crowe placing third behind
Auburn and Texas.
Following the relay the Cardinal
picked up Wilkens' fifth-place fin
ish, followed by freshman Glenn
Counts' eighth- and sophomore
Dod Wales's 14th-place finishes in
the 200 individual medley. This
was a surprisingly successful event
for the Cardinal this year as both
Counts and Wales, known for their
freestyle talent, have diversified to
become big weapons for Stanford
in the short IM event.
Tri-captain Claypool swam to a
seventh-place finish in the final
individual event of the first day,
the 50 freestyle. His seventh-place
showing this year, along with his
second-place outing in the event
his freshman year, solidifies Clay
pool as Stanford's premier sprint
freestyler of the last three years.
If there is any award for relay
swim points, it would have to go to
Stanford's Claypool, who swam all
live of Stanford's relays at the
meet, including the final event of
clay one, the 400 medley relay.
Stanford finished third in the
100 medley with a time of 3:10.65,
again behind the teams from Texas
and Auburn. Muhammad, Wilkens
and Crowe teamed up for this, yet
another all-junior class relay for
the Cardinal.
Heading into the meet's second
day, Stanford found itself in third
position, three points behind sec
ond-place Texas and 69 points
behind leader Auburn.
After another Stanford junior
class relay comprised of Muham
mad, Andre Salles-Cunha, Crowe

and Claypool placed fourth in the
200 medley relay, Wilkens' win in
the 400 IM got Stanford's momen
tum rolling.
The Stanford cheering section
was one of the most audible and
visible in the stands in Minneapo
lis, and they helped the momentum
of the second night as well.
"Our fans were really classy,"
said Salles-Cunha of the Stanford
backers. "We definitely had the
most spirited cheering section
here."
The 100 butterfly came next,
and Sabir Muhammad's third
place finish, as well as Jed Crowe's
sixth-place finish added to the
great swims of the evening.
In the first 100 butterfly field in
NCAA history where all eight com
petitors in the final heat finished in
under 48 seconds, Muhammad
(46.70) and Crowe (47.33) swam
personal bests and came up big for
the Cardinal.
"I was excited for the 100 fly
after Wilkens won the 400 IM,"
Muhammad said. "I put everything
I had into that race."
Matt Pierce, swimming in the
consolation finals, also gained
points for Stanford, coming in 13th
in the 100 fly.
The next event was the 200
freestyle, and Stanford gained
points from senior tri-captain Scott
Jones and Wales, who placed 11th
(1:37.13) and 14th (1:37.47)
respectively. In his last meet as a
Stanford Cardinal, Scott Jones was
happy to score his first individual
NCAA points in the 200 free.
"I was really happy to score in
that race," Jones said. "To end on a
high note is a great way to finish."
After being shut out of the 100
breaststroke, Stanford had its
hopes on Sabir Muhammad for the
second time that evening in the
100 backstroke. Less than an hour
after his third-place performance
in the 100 butterfly, which itself
started not long after his swim in
the 200 medley relay, Muhammad
stroked to sixth in the backstroke,
with a time of 47.92.
About his tiring schedule the

second night of the meet, Muham
mad was stoic. "I was hoping my
backstroke would be a little faster
than that," Muhammad said.
The second night ended with an
exciting 800 freestyle relay, in
which Stanford's team of Wales,
Jones, Counts and Claypool fin
ished fourth. The race was made
very interesting by Claypool, who
swam Stanford's anchor leg. Div
ing in with his team solidly in
fourth place, Claypool completed
the first half of his 200-yard leg in
a blistering 43.8 seconds, bringing
the Cardinal all the way up to sec
ond place before he was overtaken
in the final three laps.
The Cardinal performed excel
lently on the meet's second day,
and overtook Texas to move into
second place by a slim margin. Hut
even with its great swimming, the
Cardinal was still over 100 points
down to Auburn, whose first- and
second-place finishes in the relays,
along with surprising individual
performances in the nights other
events helped lengthen its lead.
Stanford had six swimmers and
one relay score on the last day of
competition, with senior Kevin
Iladvany starting it off by placing
10th in the 1650 freestyle. Ilad
vany, who placed second in the
event a year ago, averaged 56 sec
onds per 100 yards for the first
1,550 yards of the race, before
swimming a 54 second last 100 to
overtake two swimmers at the very
end to move up in his scoring posi
tion.
"I can't be mad about my mile,"
Iladvany said. "My accomplish
ment was getting through the year,
more than any awards."
After Radvany's mile, sopho
more Tate Blahnik, who qualified
seventh after the morning's pre
liminaries, stroked his way to an
impressive fourth place in the 200
backstroke. He felt that although
physically he was right on during
the event, his performance might
have been different if his outside
lane hadn't limited his vision of the
field.
"I felt I should have been third,"

said Blahnik after the race. "1
couldn't see past Jason Webb (who
swam just inside Blahnik m lane
two) for <uiy of the race, so 1 didn't
know where anyone else was. But
the swim felt more relaxed than it
did ;it I',a--10s At that meet 1 felt
like 1 was muscling it, and 1 do
much better when 1 swim relaxed
like 1 did tonighl."
The 100 butterfly, the 100
freestyle was the fastest field ever
assembled. All 16 swimmers that
made up the championship and
consolation final heats in the event
swam under 44 seconds. Two of
these 16 were Stanford's Scott
Claypool, whose 43.77 earned him
11th place, and Dod Wales, whose
43.70 was good for eighth.
A third-place finish of 1:56.80 in
the 200 breaststroke was Tom
Wilkens' final event of his very suc
cessful meet, while the 200 butter
fly event which followed it was
Matt Pierce's first championship
final swim of the weekend.
Pierce finished fourth after
making a late run to almost catch
the leaders on the last lap.
"I would rather swim to win and

get sixth than swim to get fourth
and get fourth," Pierce said. "So
tonight I swam to win and ended
up fourth."
The final relay of the meet, the
400 freestyle, was perhaps the best
one for Stanford, the team of
Wales, Counts, Crowe and Clay
pool swam to second place behind
— you guessed it — Auburn. The
fust three swimmers all split fast
times of 43.5 seconds, while Clay
pool anchored in 43.1.
The meet ended with Auburn in
first by a convincing margin, and
Stanford in second place over Geor
gia, which was followed by Texas.
"I felt we swam very well," said
Pierce of the team. "I don't like to
get second, but all year long I was
how we swam as a team. We cared
about one another and swam with
lot of heart. We're still a really
young team, and we'll be her next
year."
Wilkens also discussed the
future when summing up the
weekend.
"It was a lot of fun to compete
with this group of guys," Wilkens
said. "This is a great turnaround
from last year, and we'll go into
next year's season on an upswing."
Assistant coach Ted Knapp
emphasized the balance and solid
swims turned in by the Cardinal
and agreed that the future looks
bright, but he also stressed the fact
that a team can only control its
own performance.
"I do think that we have an even
better team next year, but you
never know what the other teams
will do," Knapp said.
Ot her teams have been showing
up more oflen these days, as spec
tators no longer expect to see the
same schools always on the victory
stand. Auburn's first-ever men's
swimming championship exempli
fies this change in the way the
sport is shaping up as it heads into
a new century. This year's champi
onships were marked by a greater
level of parity among the top

teams. More and more, the tradi
tionally second-tier schools like
Auburn, Georgia and Tennessee
have begun to challenge for their
place among the eUte swimming
powerhouses like Stanford, Texas
and Michigan. This trend has
resulted in more competitive, excit
ing championship meets, which is
something Stanford continues to
adapt to.
"The meet has a lot more play
ers now," Boomer said of the
changing atmosphere. "Auburn
was absolutely outstanding.
Nebraska, Georgia and Tennessee
are up-and-comers now, too. The
players are changing, which is very
good for the sport of swimming.
The more breadth of quality that
comes to the various teams, the
more quality Stanford will need.
"So, that is the future task of
this (Stanford) team: to raise the
quality of the group as a whole.
They appreciate this task and
know where they are headed each
day. That is a good place to be. It is
fun to be in the hunt."
The junior class that was so cru
cial in the success of Stanford's
relays this year came to the Farm
one year after the team's last
NCAA championship. The class of
Claypool, Crowe, Muhammad,
Olson, Salles-Cunha and Wilkens
is the strongest part of the team
right now, and the swimmers have
their final chance at a champi
onship ring next year.
As seniors, they will be joined by
a strong freshman class and more
experienced sophomore and
juniors. None of next year's Stan
ford team will own any rings, and it
will effectively move from the
ranks of the hunted to the hunters.
It will be the hungriest team the
NCAA has seen in four years.
But this year's team, with
seniors Jones and Kadvany,
deserves credit for helping turn the
Cardinal around from last year's
fourth-place finish, and it is a gutsy
group that won't soon be forgotten.

"Whether it was in warmups,
morning or evening swims, they
were organized and purposeful.
They were together as a group and
cared about each other."
Junior tri-captain Tom Wilkens

won his first NCAA individual title
in the 400-yard individual medley
on the night of the second day. In
one of the most exciting races of
the weekend, Wilkens came from
behind on the freestyle leg in the
last 100 yards of the race to over
take longtime rival Chris Babylon
of Georgia. What made the victory
all the more outstanding for
Wilkens was the fact that his
freestyle has traditionally been
considered his weakness in the
four-stroke event.
"One main change in my train -
ing this year had to do with my
freestyle," Wilkens said. "So I had
a lot more confidence in it."
Wilkens felt he owed some cred
it to his supporters for helping him
stay focused after his fiflh-place
finish in the 200 IM (1:46.57) the
day before.
"I have to thank the team,
(coaches) Skip and Ted, God, Kurt
(Grote) and the trainers, Rick
(Egelston) and Mike (Covert),"
Wilkens said. "After the first day,
my confidence wasn't as high as it
normally is, and the team and
coaches helped me keep it up."
Wilkens also was surprised at
the way he felt during the victory.
"You have in your mind what
you think a national championship
swim will feel like: You know, like
it will feel great, unstoppable,"
Wilkens said. "But my 400 IM
wasn't like that at all. It hurt all
the way. I think that made the race
more satisfying."
Over the course of the three-day
meet, the Stanford team picked up
momentum, having its best perfor
mances on the last day. In con
trast, the sprinter-laden Auburn
team blasted out to a huge lead on
the first day, which it was able to
sustain with strong relays on the
following two days.
Stanford's first day started out
with the 200 medley relay team of
juniors Scott Claypool, Sabir
Muhammad, Chris Olson and Jed
Crowe placing third behind
Auburn and Texas.
Following the relay the Cardinal
picked up Wilkens' fifth-place fin
ish, followed by freshman Glenn
Counts' eighth- and sophomore
Dod Wales's 14th-place finishes in
the 200 individual medley. This
was a surprisingly successful event
for the Cardinal this year as both
Counts and Wales, known for their
freestyle talent, have diversified to
become big weapons for Stanford
in the short IM event.
Tri-captain Claypool swam to a
seventh-place finish in the final
individual event of the first day,
the 50 freestyle. His seventh-place
showing this year, along with his
second-place outing in the event
his freshman year, solidifies Clay
pool as Stanford's premier sprint
freestyler of the last three years.
If there is any award for relay
swim points, it would have to go to
Stanford's Claypool, who swam all
live of Stanford's relays at the
meet, including the final event of
clay one, the 400 medley relay.
Stanford finished third in the
100 medley with a time of 3:10.65,
again behind the teams from Texas
and Auburn. Muhammad, Wilkens
and Crowe teamed up for this, yet
another all-junior class relay for
the Cardinal.
Heading into the meet's second
day, Stanford found itself in third
position, three points behind sec
ond-place Texas and 69 points
behind leader Auburn.
After another Stanford junior
class relay comprised of Muham
mad, Andre Salles-Cunha, Crowe

and Claypool placed fourth in the
200 medley relay, Wilkens' win in
the 400 IM got Stanford's momen
tum rolling.
The Stanford cheering section
was one of the most audible and
visible in the stands in Minneapo
lis, and they helped the momentum
of the second night as well.
"Our fans were really classy,"
said Salles-Cunha of the Stanford
backers. "We definitely had the
most spirited cheering section
here."
The 100 butterfly came next,
and Sabir Muhammad's third
place finish, as well as Jed Crowe's
sixth-place finish added to the
great swims of the evening.
In the first 100 butterfly field in
NCAA history where all eight com
petitors in the final heat finished in
under 48 seconds, Muhammad
(46.70) and Crowe (47.33) swam
personal bests and came up big for
the Cardinal.
"I was excited for the 100 fly
after Wilkens won the 400 IM,"
Muhammad said. "I put everything
I had into that race."
Matt Pierce, swimming in the
consolation finals, also gained
points for Stanford, coming in 13th
in the 100 fly.
The next event was the 200
freestyle, and Stanford gained
points from senior tri-captain Scott
Jones and Wales, who placed 11th
(1:37.13) and 14th (1:37.47)
respectively. In his last meet as a
Stanford Cardinal, Scott Jones was
happy to score his first individual
NCAA points in the 200 free.
"I was really happy to score in
that race," Jones said. "To end on a
high note is a great way to finish."
After being shut out of the 100
breaststroke, Stanford had its
hopes on Sabir Muhammad for the
second time that evening in the
100 backstroke. Less than an hour
after his third-place performance
in the 100 butterfly, which itself
started not long after his swim in
the 200 medley relay, Muhammad
stroked to sixth in the backstroke,
with a time of 47.92.
About his tiring schedule the

second night of the meet, Muham
mad was stoic. "I was hoping my
backstroke would be a little faster
than that," Muhammad said.
The second night ended with an
exciting 800 freestyle relay, in
which Stanford's team of Wales,
Jones, Counts and Claypool fin
ished fourth. The race was made
very interesting by Claypool, who
swam Stanford's anchor leg. Div
ing in with his team solidly in
fourth place, Claypool completed
the first half of his 200-yard leg in
a blistering 43.8 seconds, bringing
the Cardinal all the way up to sec
ond place before he was overtaken
in the final three laps.
The Cardinal performed excel
lently on the meet's second day,
and overtook Texas to move into
second place by a slim margin. Hut
even with its great swimming, the
Cardinal was still over 100 points
down to Auburn, whose first- and
second-place finishes in the relays,
along with surprising individual
performances in the nights other
events helped lengthen its lead.
Stanford had six swimmers and
one relay score on the last day of
competition, with senior Kevin
Iladvany starting it off by placing
10th in the 1650 freestyle. Ilad
vany, who placed second in the
event a year ago, averaged 56 sec
onds per 100 yards for the first
1,550 yards of the race, before
swimming a 54 second last 100 to
overtake two swimmers at the very
end to move up in his scoring posi
tion.
"I can't be mad about my mile,"
Iladvany said. "My accomplish
ment was getting through the year,
more than any awards."
After Radvany's mile, sopho
more Tate Blahnik, who qualified
seventh after the morning's pre
liminaries, stroked his way to an
impressive fourth place in the 200
backstroke. He felt that although
physically he was right on during
the event, his performance might
have been different if his outside
lane hadn't limited his vision of the
field.
"I felt I should have been third,"

said Blahnik after the race. "1
couldn't see past Jason Webb (who
swam just inside Blahnik m lane
two) for <uiy of the race, so 1 didn't
know where anyone else was. But
the swim felt more relaxed than it
did ;it I',a--10s At that meet 1 felt
like 1 was muscling it, and 1 do
much better when 1 swim relaxed
like 1 did tonighl."
The 100 butterfly, the 100
freestyle was the fastest field ever
assembled. All 16 swimmers that
made up the championship and
consolation final heats in the event
swam under 44 seconds. Two of
these 16 were Stanford's Scott
Claypool, whose 43.77 earned him
11th place, and Dod Wales, whose
43.70 was good for eighth.
A third-place finish of 1:56.80 in
the 200 breaststroke was Tom
Wilkens' final event of his very suc
cessful meet, while the 200 butter
fly event which followed it was
Matt Pierce's first championship
final swim of the weekend.
Pierce finished fourth after
making a late run to almost catch
the leaders on the last lap.
"I would rather swim to win and

get sixth than swim to get fourth
and get fourth," Pierce said. "So
tonight I swam to win and ended
up fourth."
The final relay of the meet, the
400 freestyle, was perhaps the best
one for Stanford, the team of
Wales, Counts, Crowe and Clay
pool swam to second place behind
— you guessed it — Auburn. The
fust three swimmers all split fast
times of 43.5 seconds, while Clay
pool anchored in 43.1.
The meet ended with Auburn in
first by a convincing margin, and
Stanford in second place over Geor
gia, which was followed by Texas.
"I felt we swam very well," said
Pierce of the team. "I don't like to
get second, but all year long I was
how we swam as a team. We cared
about one another and swam with
lot of heart. We're still a really
young team, and we'll be her next
year."
Wilkens also discussed the
future when summing up the
weekend.
"It was a lot of fun to compete
with this group of guys," Wilkens
said. "This is a great turnaround
from last year, and we'll go into
next year's season on an upswing."
Assistant coach Ted Knapp
emphasized the balance and solid
swims turned in by the Cardinal
and agreed that the future looks
bright, but he also stressed the fact
that a team can only control its
own performance.
"I do think that we have an even
better team next year, but you
never know what the other teams
will do," Knapp said.
Ot her teams have been showing
up more oflen these days, as spec
tators no longer expect to see the
same schools always on the victory
stand. Auburn's first-ever men's
swimming championship exempli
fies this change in the way the
sport is shaping up as it heads into
a new century. This year's champi
onships were marked by a greater
level of parity among the top

teams. More and more, the tradi
tionally second-tier schools like
Auburn, Georgia and Tennessee
have begun to challenge for their
place among the eUte swimming
powerhouses like Stanford, Texas
and Michigan. This trend has
resulted in more competitive, excit
ing championship meets, which is
something Stanford continues to
adapt to.
"The meet has a lot more play
ers now," Boomer said of the
changing atmosphere. "Auburn
was absolutely outstanding.
Nebraska, Georgia and Tennessee
are up-and-comers now, too. The
players are changing, which is very
good for the sport of swimming.
The more breadth of quality that
comes to the various teams, the
more quality Stanford will need.
"So, that is the future task of
this (Stanford) team: to raise the
quality of the group as a whole.
They appreciate this task and
know where they are headed each
day. That is a good place to be. It is
fun to be in the hunt."
The junior class that was so cru
cial in the success of Stanford's
relays this year came to the Farm
one year after the team's last
NCAA championship. The class of
Claypool, Crowe, Muhammad,
Olson, Salles-Cunha and Wilkens
is the strongest part of the team
right now, and the swimmers have
their final chance at a champi
onship ring next year.
As seniors, they will be joined by
a strong freshman class and more
experienced sophomore and
juniors. None of next year's Stan
ford team will own any rings, and it
will effectively move from the
ranks of the hunted to the hunters.
It will be the hungriest team the
NCAA has seen in four years.
But this year's team, with
seniors Jones and Kadvany,
deserves credit for helping turn the
Cardinal around from last year's
fourth-place finish, and it is a gutsy
group that won't soon be forgotten.

placed third at NCAAs this weekend in the 100-yard butterfly.
Punctuating a great season, the
Stanford men's swim team came
away from the 1997 NCAA Cham
pionships with the second-place
trophy, a proud coach and a bright
outlook on its future.
Auburn won the three-day
meet, which took place on March
27-29 at the Minnesota Aquatics
Center in Minneapolis. The War
Eagles' 496.5 points gave them
their first-ever NCAA swimming
championship over second-place
Stanford's 340.
The second-place finish to an
Auburn team that modeled itself
after Stanford's program before
becoming one of its rivals, was not
an easy pill to swallow for the Car
dinal. However, the swimmers and
coaches expressed pride in their
season and their performance at
the meet in Minneapolis.
"I'm so very proud of our guys,
not only as swimmers, but as rep
resentatives of Stanford and as
young men," said head coach Skip
Kenney after the meet. Kenney,
who has coached at Stanford for 18
years and was the 1996 head men's
Olympic coach in Atlanta last sum
mer expressed sentiments that
were echoed by other members of
the coaching staff.
"I'm pleased with the way the
guys presented themselves to the
meet," said volunteer assistant
coach and renowned stroke spe
cialist / guru Bill Boomer.
"Whether it was in warmups,
morning or evening swims, they
were organized and purposeful.
They were together as a group and
