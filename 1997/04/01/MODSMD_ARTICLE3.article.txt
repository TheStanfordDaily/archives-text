# ROTC returning in fall
## Department of military science to take over LGBCC spot in Fire Truck House 
### December Aspen Staff writer 
Five courses will be offered on
campus this quarter through the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps
Program.
In accordance with an agree
ment signed by Provost Con
doleezza Rice during spring break
and announced yesterday, the
military training program will be
taught in University buildings by
a Defense Department-assigned
professor who will fill the newly
created position of vice provost for
military affairs.
The decision was hailed as a
milestone in fighting discrimina
tion against members of the
armed forces that proponents say
has been prolific at Stanford since
the University banned ROTC
more than 25 years ago.
"A triumph, nothing less than
that," said junior Bruce Gibney,
the ASSU senator who introduced
a bill calling for the program's re
turn to campus. "I will no longer
be ashamed to call myself a Stan
ford student."
But in the Fire Truck House
last night, students were already
planning marches, petitions and
other protests of the move. Be
cause of space constraints, the

University has decided to house
the ROTC program on the second
floor of the building, a location
that formerly housed the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
The classrooms will be re
designed to meet standards set by
the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
"An outrage, nothing less than
that," said senior Benjamin
Lawrance, who has been active in
the fight against the program's re
turn.
Lawrance said a group already
has been formed, tentatively
called Students Together Against
ROTC. It charges that the Univer
sity and the Defense Department
conspired to prevent making the
required ADA changes to the
building in order to provide an ex
cuse for kicking out the LGBCC.
STAROTC objects to the ROTC
program in principle because of
the military's "Don't ask; don't
tell" policy toward homosexuality.
In a surprising turn of events,
Office of Student Activities Asst.
Director Troy Gilbert, the com
munity center's adviser, an
nounced he has accepted the pro
fessorship.
