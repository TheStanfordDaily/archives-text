# Chapman honorable mention All-American
## Stanford sends four to NCAAs 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Wrestling legend and coach Dan
Gable once said, "Although season
duals and individual records are
important, all that really matters is
the NCAA tournament in March
when any wrestler has a shot at
becoming a champion." Sending
four wrestlers to the NCAA tour
nament at the University of North
ern lowa, the Stanford wrestling
team felt this simple adage work
both for and against the Cardinal.
Freshman Zach Zimmerer,
sophomore BeauWeiner, junior
Scott Chapman, and senior Brian
Vaniman all wrestled in their first
NCAA tournament March 20-22
before sellout crowds of 14,500
loud spectators in a dome the size
of an indoor football stadium. "It's
easy to get intimidated by all this in
your first NCAA tournament,"
head coach Chris Horpel said. But
all four wrestlers won matches and
proved they can compete at this
level.
"I felt pretty good about how I
wrestled," 126-pound wrestler
Zimmerer said. "Winning my first
match I sort of surprised myself. I
realized I had a shot at becoming
an All-American." Zimmerer
entered the tournament with a 24-
18 season record as the team pin
leader with six pins.
Zimmerer dominated senior
Scott Murray of Northern lowa
(22-7), beating the West Regional
Conference champion 12-3.
Zimmerer lost his next match to
Dwight Hinson, the top-seeded
wrestler in the 126-pound division,
sending him to the consolation (or
"wrestle back") bracket.
Zimmerer's next opponent was

his old nemesis John Kelly (14-4),
the Western Athletic Conference
champion from Brigham Young.
Losing late in the third round,
Zimmerer bested yet another con
ference champion by reversing
Kelly and nearly pinning him with
15 seconds left to finish his 6-3 vic
tory.
Senior John Noble (19-9), the
Mid-American Conference cham
pion from Ohio, defeated Zimmer
er in his next match 12-5. Finish
ing 2-2 and in the top 16 at
NCAAs, Zimmerer's "perfor
mance as a frosh was outstand

ing," Horpel said.
Weiner, a 142 pounder, had
mixed feelings about his NCAA
performance. Winning his fir.st
match in a double-overtime tie
breaker victory against sophomor"
Clint Musser (26-11), the ninth
seeded wrestler from Penn State,
Weiner "felt good about the
match, and that I should place in
the top 8."
However, Weiner wjus sent to
the wrestle backs after losing his
next match 11-3 to sophomore

Chapman led the Stanford coalition at NCAA's with a ninth-place
finish in the 167-pound bracket over spring break.
Brett Modder (30-4), the Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa
tion Champion and eighth seed
from Penn.
In the wrestle backs, Weiner
lost to junior Mike Harp (22-10),
Big 12 Conference runner-up, by a
6:48 technical fall in a "conflict in
wrestling styles," Horpel said.
"Despite a midseason slump, I
pulled it out at the end when I
needed to," Weiner said. "If I had
wrestled to my potential I would've
been an All-American, but before
that was just a goal. Now I know
what it takes and I know I can do it
next year."
Placing ninth in the 167-pound
bracket was a bittersweet end for
Chapman.
"I was pretty disappointed; I felt
I could place top eight and make

All- American," Chapman said. "I
know 1 was ready; I just didn't
win." Chapman entered the tour
nament with a 39-10 record, tying
Stanford's all-time season record.
In his first match, Chapman
made quick work of senior Damon
Stephens (22-13) of Maryland,
beating the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence runner-up 9-1.
Chapman lost his next match
17-7 to second seeded senior and
Big 10 champion Kevin Wilmot
(30-3) of Wisconsin.
In an exciting comeback, Chap
man defeated junior Mike Barlow
(25-10) of George Mason 8-7 after
scoring a five-point takedown and
nearfall against the Colonial Ath
letic Association runner-up late in
the third round.
"I felt stronger in my last
matches," Chapman said. Display
ing his renewed strength, Chap
man pinned junior Southern Con
ference champion Derrik Strobel
(16-4) of Appalachian State in 6:03

to advmice to honorable mention
All American standing. Another
win would have made Chapman an
All-American.
However, Chapman lost a close
and controversial match 4-2 to
junior John Winthrow (29-7) of
Pittsburgh which "could've gone
either way."
"I thought the other guy stalled
most of t he second and third peri
ods," Chapman said. Horpel also
said, "Scott had a probable take
down and back points with 20 sec
onds to go which the referee ruled
'potentially dangerous.' "
Wrestling in his last tourna
ment, 190-pounder Brian Vani
man overcame a broken finger
which kept him out of the second
half of the regular season.
Although the cast was removed
prematurely for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, Vaniman
said "overall, it had no real impact
on my performance at the
NCAAs."

Vaniman lost his first match 13-
5 against junior Sam Neider (24-
10) of Northwestern.
Beating WAC champion and
Fresno State senior Lalo Moz 5-3,
Vaniman came back strong in the
wrestle backs.
Vaniman's lost his next match
with freshman Elliot Williams, the
Colonial champion, 5-3 in a disap
pointing finish.
"It was a frustrating match
because Brian was in on his legs
time after time but couldn't con
vert to a takedown," Horpel said.
Overall, Horpel was satisfied
with his team's performance. "The
only thing that we could've done
better was make Scott an All-
American," he said.
But with the team placing 32
and three of the four NCAA
wrestlers returning next year, the
Stanford wrestling team promises
only to become stronger and con
vert NCAA qualifiers to All-
Americans.
