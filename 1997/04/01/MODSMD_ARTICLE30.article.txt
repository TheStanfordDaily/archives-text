## Stanford sends four to NCAAs 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Wrestling legend and coach Dan
Gable once said, "Although season
duals and individual records are
important, all that really matters is
the NCAA tournament in March
when any wrestler has a shot at
becoming a champion." Sending
four wrestlers to the NCAA tour
nament at the University of North
ern lowa, the Stanford wrestling
team felt this simple adage work
both for and against the Cardinal.
Freshman Zach Zimmerer,
sophomore BeauWeiner, junior
Scott Chapman, and senior Brian
Vaniman all wrestled in their first
NCAA tournament March 20-22
before sellout crowds of 14,500
loud spectators in a dome the size
of an indoor football stadium. "It's
easy to get intimidated by all this in
your first NCAA tournament,"
head coach Chris Horpel said. But
all four wrestlers won matches and
proved they can compete at this
level.
"I felt pretty good about how I
wrestled," 126-pound wrestler
Zimmerer said. "Winning my first
match I sort of surprised myself. I
realized I had a shot at becoming
an All-American." Zimmerer
entered the tournament with a 24-
18 season record as the team pin
leader with six pins.
Zimmerer dominated senior
Scott Murray of Northern lowa
(22-7), beating the West Regional
Conference champion 12-3.
Zimmerer lost his next match to
Dwight Hinson, the top-seeded
wrestler in the 126-pound division,
sending him to the consolation (or
"wrestle back") bracket.
Zimmerer's next opponent was

his old nemesis John Kelly (14-4),
the Western Athletic Conference
champion from Brigham Young.
Losing late in the third round,
Zimmerer bested yet another con
ference champion by reversing
Kelly and nearly pinning him with
15 seconds left to finish his 6-3 vic
tory.
Senior John Noble (19-9), the
Mid-American Conference cham
pion from Ohio, defeated Zimmer
er in his next match 12-5. Finish
ing 2-2 and in the top 16 at
NCAAs, Zimmerer's "perfor
mance as a frosh was outstand

ing," Horpel said.
Weiner, a 142 pounder, had
mixed feelings about his NCAA
performance. Winning his fir.st
match in a double-overtime tie
breaker victory against sophomor"
Clint Musser (26-11), the ninth
seeded wrestler from Penn State,
Weiner "felt good about the
match, and that I should place in
the top 8."
However, Weiner wjus sent to
the wrestle backs after losing his
next match 11-3 to sophomore
