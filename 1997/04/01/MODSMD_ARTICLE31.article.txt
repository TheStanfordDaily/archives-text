## Senior guard Jamila Wideman carried team through season 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
CINCINNATI - Head coach
Tara VanDerveer knew she had
something special in senior
Jamila Wideman from that very
first recruiting trip to Stanford.
"Because of her eye contact,"

VanDerveer explained. "I don't
know why I did, but I just said,
'This is someone 1 look forward
to working with.' She just looks
right at you and doesn't break
eye contact in a way that you
know she just, I don't know. It
wasn't like it was anything artifi
cial, but she was just listening."

That's the kind of sentiment
Wideman evokes from Van-
Derveer. The day following Stan
ford's 83-82 overtime loss to Old
Dominion in the national semifi
nal the coach sat quietly, finding
difficulty with the words as she
sought to explain what is so spe
cial about her four-year captain
and point guard.
You get the impression from
VanDerveer and the other play
ers that words may be too limit
ed to describe Wideman. Sim's
not someone you can simply tell
another person about; she's
something you have to experi
ence.
Her focused gaze is penetrat
ing, and her confident demeanor
gives her the kind of presence
that takes up an entire room
without pushing others out of it.
In fact, just the opposite is true;
they're drawn in.
"Jamila is a deep person,"
VanDerveer said. "She's some
one who understands the big pic
ture. She's someone who gen
uinely cares about people. She's
someone people trust and have
confidence in. She says, 'Let's
go,' and they go. And I go, too."
Perhaps it's that indescriba
bility, that quality you just can't,
express with words, that makes
Wideman such a great leader.
She gives the impression of being
in a place that's just a little above
t he rest, but she does it without
arrogance or without even try
ing. Wideman knows the fine line
between confidence and cocki
ness and has the charm to dance
all the way to it, without ever
cross ing.
"Charisma," senior guard
Kate Starbird said of Wideman's

presence. "She has more charis
ma than 10 people put together.
That helps to make a great lead
er. She's someone you want to lie
around. She makes you (eel good
about yourself. She's a good per
son to talk to."
She's also a good person to lis
ten to. All those qualities — the
mat urity and wisdom beyond her
years, the charisma, the confi
dence — translate into an incred
ible point guard on I lie court.
Hut it's more than her versa
tility to make the pass or the
shot, to defend the passing lane
and then get, the steal. It's more
than her vast knowledge of the
game that makes her an exten
sion of t he coach on t he floor.
It's the way she controls her
team. It's the way she carries
herself on the court. It's the way
she has the courage to get up in
front of a teary-eyed team after
playing her final collegiate game
and get t hem to lift their heads.
"If you could've seen Jamila
in that locker room," Vau-
I )erveer said with a tone of mixed
sadness and respect. "I'm like, 'I
don't have anything to say,' and
she is such a leader of 112 hat team.
She said stuff that will stick wit h
me forever. People were very
upset, but she was like, you
should've seen it,. She was stand
ing in front of everyone and she
was like, 'Pick your heads up.'
And I was like it was really
they respond to her."
What, was an incredible
moment for VanDerveer and
undoubtedly everyone in the
room was, for Widenian, one last
opportunity to speak to her
