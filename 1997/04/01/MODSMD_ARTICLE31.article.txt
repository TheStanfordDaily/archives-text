# A 						leader on and off the court
## Senior guard Jamila Wideman carried team through season 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
CINCINNATI - Head coach
Tara VanDerveer knew she had
something special in senior
Jamila Wideman from that very
first recruiting trip to Stanford.
"Because of her eye contact,"

VanDerveer explained. "I don't
know why I did, but I just said,
'This is someone 1 look forward
to working with.' She just looks
right at you and doesn't break
eye contact in a way that you
know she just, I don't know. It
wasn't like it was anything artifi
cial, but she was just listening."

That's the kind of sentiment
Wideman evokes from Van-
Derveer. The day following Stan
ford's 83-82 overtime loss to Old
Dominion in the national semifi
nal the coach sat quietly, finding
difficulty with the words as she
sought to explain what is so spe
cial about her four-year captain
and point guard.
You get the impression from
VanDerveer and the other play
ers that words may be too limit
ed to describe Wideman. Sim's
not someone you can simply tell
another person about; she's
something you have to experi
ence.
Her focused gaze is penetrat
ing, and her confident demeanor
gives her the kind of presence
that takes up an entire room
without pushing others out of it.
In fact, just the opposite is true;
they're drawn in.
"Jamila is a deep person,"
VanDerveer said. "She's some
one who understands the big pic
ture. She's someone who gen
uinely cares about people. She's
someone people trust and have
confidence in. She says, 'Let's
go,' and they go. And I go, too."
Perhaps it's that indescriba
bility, that quality you just can't,
express with words, that makes
Wideman such a great leader.
She gives the impression of being
in a place that's just a little above
t he rest, but she does it without
arrogance or without even try
ing. Wideman knows the fine line
between confidence and cocki
ness and has the charm to dance
all the way to it, without ever
cross ing.
"Charisma," senior guard
Kate Starbird said of Wideman's

presence. "She has more charis
ma than 10 people put together.
That helps to make a great lead
er. She's someone you want to lie
around. She makes you (eel good
about yourself. She's a good per
son to talk to."
She's also a good person to lis
ten to. All those qualities — the
mat urity and wisdom beyond her
years, the charisma, the confi
dence — translate into an incred
ible point guard on I lie court.
Hut it's more than her versa
tility to make the pass or the
shot, to defend the passing lane
and then get, the steal. It's more
than her vast knowledge of the
game that makes her an exten
sion of t he coach on t he floor.
It's the way she controls her
team. It's the way she carries
herself on the court. It's the way
she has the courage to get up in
front of a teary-eyed team after
playing her final collegiate game
and get t hem to lift their heads.
"If you could've seen Jamila
in that locker room," Vau-
I )erveer said with a tone of mixed
sadness and respect. "I'm like, 'I
don't have anything to say,' and
she is such a leader of 112 hat team.
She said stuff that will stick wit h
me forever. People were very
upset, but she was like, you
should've seen it,. She was stand
ing in front of everyone and she
was like, 'Pick your heads up.'
And I was like it was really
they respond to her."
What, was an incredible
moment for VanDerveer and
undoubtedly everyone in the
room was, for Widenian, one last
opportunity to speak to her

team, an opportunity she had to
take no matter how painful it
proved to be.
"I knew that was probably
going to be my last opportunity to
address our team when I was still
going to be an part of it in the inti
mate way that you are as a play
er," Wideman said. "I was in
shock and obviously very disap
pointed that it was over for us, but
I didn't want to let that space of
time disappear because something
about the immediacy of that lock
er room and that space of time felt
final to me.
"I didn't want to lose that
opportunity to try to catch some
thing for myself and maybe to
throw something out there for
our team to hold on to as some
thing positive, something spe
cial, that hopefully will remain
for people for as long as they live

and longer than the hurt of los
ing will."
You can bet Wideman succeed
ed. So how can one person mean
so much to such a team? No one
seems to be able to say what it is,
but they can all tell you Wideman
is the one they wouldn't want to
be without.
"I don't think I could put her
role into words," Starbird said.
"She ran the whole team on and
off the court. If you look at our
team, the one person who wasn't
replaceable was Jamila.
"From the moment we
stepped on the campus as fresh
men, we knew she was the leader.
I owe a large portion of the per
sonal success and awards I've
received to her because she's
been such a great point guard.
There are different types of point
guards. Jamila's the one that's
really unselfish, distributes the
ball, runs the team. She's been
making me look good for four
years."
Wideman doesn't think she's

the one to answer the question of
what makes her so special but
offers a small explanation of what
she brings to the court.
"Hopefully what people feel is
that I'm willing to give anything
of myself to be successful," Wide
man said. "And not just in terms
of our wins and losses but for our
team to be the kind of team that's
fun to be on and one that you'd
want to remember.
"I put all of myself into that,
and so people trust my motiva
tions. I think it in some way
engenders a certain amount of
confidence. In terms of basketball,
I leave it all on the court. There's
no secret; I give everything that I
have and maybe for some people
that example is something they
respect."
If the praise of her teammates
and coaches is any indication,
respect is a good word for Wide
man. VanDerveer said she's a per
son who can "make a difference in
our world, not just the basketball
world," and Starbird is just

thankful to have played with her
and known her these four years.
"When I think of my experi
ence at Stanford, I think Stanford
has allowed me to have a friend
ship with Jamila Wideman," Star
bird said. "She's one of the great
people at Stanford."
Wideman will go down as one
of Stanford's great point guards.
Her love for the game and compet
itive nature make her a great play
er, but those indescribable quali
ties that are so rare will make her
unforgettable.
Like any true competitor,
though, the enjoyment of her
remarkable career is outweighed
by her loss, at least for the time
being.
"I think right now it's hard,"
Wideman said. "I guess one of the
labels I didn't want for this team
was, 'It was a special team but...'
And right now I can't really sepa
rate the two. It is a special team,
and it will always be. But it's not
how I ever imagined it would end
for this team."
