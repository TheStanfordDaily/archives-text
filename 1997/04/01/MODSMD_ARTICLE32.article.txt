### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
Sounding a death knell for Mast
Coast domination of the sport, the
No. .'5 Stanford fencing squad pro
duced its best finish ever, tying for
third at the N( !AA (Championships
in Colorado Springs. The Cardi
nal's 1,1'2() points left it dead even
with St. John's (N Y.) and fell
behind only top-ranked I'enn State
and No. '2 Notre Dame.
"We came in with big expecta
tions, and I think we did as well ;ls
we hoped we would, " said sopho
more Lauren ()'Mrien. "At the very
least, we proved that we are legit."
Stanford's performance! was
even more remarkable considering
a number of considerable disad
vantages; most notably, a t.wo
fencer handicap that left I he Cardi
nal with only eight competitors as
opposed to the 10 sported hy the
Irish and the Nittany Lions. Only
eight Stanford fencers qualified for
the championships.
The squad shouldered the addi
tional anxiety of finals as well, tak
ing off for the Air Force Academy
on Wednesday of finals week. With

their minds preoccupied by compe
tition, the athletes completed their
exams away from the Farm.
"There's no way that something
like that could not he a distrac
tion," said freshman Alex Wood.
"We did a good job of not letting it
bother us too much though."
Ix;ading the way for the Cardi
nal was the brilliant individual
showing of sophomore Alden
Clarke, who dropped only one bout
en route to a gaudy 22-1 round
robin record and the men's epee
crown..
"I felt absolutely amazing, like I
couldn't lose," Clarke said. "I've
l>een working toward this for more
than half my life."
After cruising through the
round robin, Clarke found himself
paired against junior teammate
Sean McClain, an Olympic team
alternate, in the semifinals.
McClain had defeated him twice
before at regionals, completely
shutting him out 5-0 in one bout.
"I was pretty nervous because
he killed me before," Clarke said.
"I figured I just wanUnl to compete
so that I had nothing left at the end
of it."

Seemingly unable to miss,
(Jlarke beat Mc( Main handily 15-10
and set up another crucial rematch
in the final, this time against
Ceorge Hentea of St. John's, who
had stung Clarke for his only loss
in the preliminary rounds. Ilnwev
er, Clarke jumped out to a huge'
lead and avenged the lone blemish
with a 15-1 .'i victory.
"I Ihink a big factor was having
great guys like Sean and Rich
11 longl to train with," (larke said.
"They raise the har a notch in prat:
tice."
Other strong individual perfor
mances included Wood and sopho
more captain Tim Chang finishing
ninth and 101 h, re perl ively, in the
men's foil. Sophomore .James
Chung never found a rhythm, fin
ishing 22nd in the sabre.
On the women's side, freshman
Monique l)e Mruin, also an
Olympic alternate, finished first in
tlx; foil round robin at 20-3, but fell
in the semifinals. O'Urien over
came early jitters to finish fifth in
the epee, while junior captain Mary
Barsanty endured excruciating
pain from a herniated disc to finish
20th.
