# Volleyball faces Hawaii tonight
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
The Cardinal will have to he on top of its game
tonight for its highly anticipated 7 p.m. match at
Burnham Pavilion against Hawaii. Last year's run
ner-up at the NCAA Championships, the Rainbows
are riding a seven-game winning streak, including
victories over nationally ranked powers Lewis Uni
versity, Loyola Marymount and Cal State-
Northridge.
While Hawaii's streak is impressive, it may be a
slightly misleading indication of Rainbow domi
nance, as all of seven wins came at home, where

Hawaii's rabid fans, consistently the most support
ive in the country, give? it huge advantage Coming
to Stanford and leaving with victories should prove
to be a much tougher task
"The two games will be a real test for Hawaii,"
said Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves ' Taking
their show on the road to play one of the be>t teams
in the country will give them t he opport unity to see
how good they are.
"Like us, their coach feels that tliey are playing
their best volleyball of the year It should lie a real
competitive two days of volleyball."
Despite Hawaii's 7-6 record in
the MPSF, the Rainbows are a
without a doubt, one of the most
dangerous teams. While Ail-
Americans Yuval Katz, an out
side hitter who turned pro last
year after his sophomore year,
and setter Erik Pichel were lost
to graduation, Hawaii still boasts
a formidable array of talent.
Jason Ring, Hawaii's top hit
ter, was moved from middle
blocker to outside hitter to
replace Katz, and Rich Tune has
replaced Ring in the middle. In
addition, Hawaii has one of the
most electric volleyball players
in the country in junior middle
blocker Sivan Leoni, an Israeli
import. Fellow Israeli Naveh
Milo, an outside hitter who has
as good a jump serve as any in
the country, setter Curt

Vaughn, who is as talented as
Pichel, and outside hitter Aaron
Wilton, the coach's son, round
out the talented group of
starters.
"Leoni puts on a real show on
the court," Nieves said. "The
only way to describe him is as a
wild man. I think that the real
key to the match will be how we
match up with their passers.
They are not a big team, but they
are great defensively and at con
trolling the ball.
"I think that the combination
of Wilton and Milo is the best
passing duo in the country. We
have to force them into as many
errors as we can and then block
and sideout well when they do
make good passes. The two
matches will let us know how
much we have improved at win
ning long rallies."
Clearly, if Stanford wants to
remain perfect at home this year,
it will take two very strong
efforts over the next two nights.
