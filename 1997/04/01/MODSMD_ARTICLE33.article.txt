The Cardinal will have to he on top of its game
tonight for its highly anticipated 7 p.m. match at
Burnham Pavilion against Hawaii. Last year's run
ner-up at the NCAA Championships, the Rainbows
are riding a seven-game winning streak, including
victories over nationally ranked powers Lewis Uni
versity, Loyola Marymount and Cal State-
Northridge.
While Hawaii's streak is impressive, it may be a
slightly misleading indication of Rainbow domi
nance, as all of seven wins came at home, where

Hawaii's rabid fans, consistently the most support
ive in the country, give? it huge advantage Coming
to Stanford and leaving with victories should prove
to be a much tougher task
"The two games will be a real test for Hawaii,"
said Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves ' Taking
their show on the road to play one of the be>t teams
in the country will give them t he opport unity to see
how good they are.
"Like us, their coach feels that tliey are playing
their best volleyball of the year It should lie a real
competitive two days of volleyball."
