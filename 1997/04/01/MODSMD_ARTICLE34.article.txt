# With new lineup, women's tennis dusts opponents
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
While the majority of Stan
ford athletic teams spent their
spring breaks vying for national
championships, the No. 2 Cardi
nal women's tennis squad swept
three matches as it prepares for
its own title run.
Stanford (18-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
extended its winning streak to
eight as the Cardinal blasted
Kansas at home 8-1 and then hit
the road to defeat San Diego 6-1
and No. 8 Pepperdine 8-1.
The Cardinal sported a brand
new lineup for the three match
es, determined in practice
through challenge matches. The
lineup features freshmen T.ilia
Osterloh and Anne Kremer in
the top two singles spots, fol
lowed by an impressive display of
depth by four All-Americans.
Kremer, playing twice in the
No. 2 spot and once at No. 1, led
the way for the Cardinal with
three singles wins and two dou
bles wins in as many attempts.
Against the eighth-ranked
Waves (11-6) March 27, Stanford
steamrolled Pepperdine for the
second time this season. The
Cardinal took all six singles
matches as Osterloh and Kremer
won in straight sets. Osterloh
took Papperdine's Isabella
Petrov 7-6, 6-4.
"Lilia played the best oppo
nent of the break," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan.
"She rose to the occasion and
played good solid tennis â€” not
great yet, but pretty damn good.
So that was a good showing for
her."

Senior Katie Schlukebir, now
playing at the No. 3 spot,
crushed Annabel Rognon in
straight sets as well 6-2, 6-3. Fel
low senior Sandra De Silva
earned another straight-set win
at the No. 4 spot, as did junior
Julie Scott in the No. 6 match.
At No. 5, junior Ania
Bleszysnki outlasted Karoline
Borgersen in a tough three-set
contest 7-5, 4-6, 7-5.
"The highlight was Ania,"
Brennan said. "Although she
went three sets, her opponent
was really good. [BorgersonJ
looked better than anyone in
their lineup except for Petrov.
I Bleszyftski | has been struggling
and this match she had her
demons, but she hung in there
and prevailed. She played great
tennis at the end. Her last couple
games were about as good as I
have ever seen her play. She was
totally focused, moving her feet,
getting to every ball, creaming
forehands. So I was thrilled."
Pepperdine put up a fight in
doubles play, earning its only
win of the afternoon at No. 2
doubles as Bleszynski and Scott
dropped an 8-5 match to the
Waves. Osterloh and Schlukebir
took the No. 1 contest 8-4, while
Kremer and freshman Teryn
Ashley edged out their Pepper
dine opponents 9-7.
Doubles hardly got a chance
to get going against San Diego
March 26 as the Cardinal took
the bottom five singles matches
and the No. 1 doubles match
before the remaining doubles
matches were suspended.
In the No. 1 match, San
Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova got the
best of Osterloh 7-5, 6-4. But
Schlukebir, De Silva and Scott
notched straight-set wins, and
Kremer and Bleszynski battled for
three-set victories.
Osterloh and Schlukebir earned
another 8-4 win in the only dou
bles match which occurred.
At home against Kansas March
25, the Jay hawks did not have the
firepower to keep up with the Car
dinal. Missing the services of Kylie
Hunt, one of the top singles com
petitors in the country last season,
Kansas managed only one win at
the No. 5 singles position.
Cardinal doubles play high
lighted the win as the Stanford
teams dropped only three total
games in three matches. Kremer

and freshman Teryn Ashley
blanked their counterparts 8-0.
Osterloh and Schlukebir also
cruised to an 8-1 win while
Bleszynski and Scott won easily 8-
2.
Stanford brings its winning act
back home to the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium as it puts its win
ning streak to the test against Pac
-10 rivals UCLA and USC this
weekend. The Cardinal lineup
should remain the same as they
adjust to their new positions.
"This is the way it should be,"
Brennan said. "I don't expect
them to be happy with where they
are in the lineup. Katie is a senior;
she is doing a great job and she is
now No. 1 in the country. I don't
expect her to agree with me. I
wouldn't want her to. I want her to
think she can beat everyone in the
country. But this is what coaching
is all about, and this is why I get
paid the big bucks."
