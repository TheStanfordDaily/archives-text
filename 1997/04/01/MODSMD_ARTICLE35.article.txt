# Gymnasts prepare for regionals
## Cardinal places second at home, fifth at MPSF meet in Nebraska 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
The pressure is on for the men's
gymnastics team.
The Cardinal placed second at
its last home meet March 15 to
Oklahoma 231.4-227.45 and then
took fifth at MPSFs in Nebraska
last weekend.
After the last home meet, head
coach Sadao Hamada turned his
focus to NCAA West regional
action, saying, "MPSFs are just
like any other meet. I don't care if
we finish dead last."
While Stanford's score of 224.65
was its second lowest of the season,
it still put the Cardinal well above
the last-place team, UC-Santa Bar
bara, with a 196.70. Nonetheless,
the score should be a wakeup call
because the Card has only one
week to prepare for the Western
Regionals from which only three
teams move on to the NCAAs.
Nebraska took first with 230.7
in the Huskers' best meet of the
season, followed by Oklahoma at
230.1, California at 229.8 and New
Mexico with 225.025.
The field for the top three spots
at Western Regionals looks to be
decided between four teams: Cali
fornia, Oklahoma, Nebraska arid
Stanford. Stanford has yet to beat
any of these teams this season and
looks to steal a spot from either
Oklahoma or Nebraska.
Although Friday's team perfor
mance was less than stellar, the re
emergence of senior Jamie Ellis
promises to bring renewed life to
the Cardinal squad.
Ellis injured his shoulder during
a floor exercise routine last month
and was thought to be sidelined for
the rest of the season. Ellis' physi
cian strongly advised him not to
compete in any event other than
the pommel horse.
However, Ellis saw action at
MPSFs on the floor exercise, post
ing a 9.725 on the event. Even

more surprisingly, Ellis may see
full action at Western Regionals
this weekend.
Ellis has been training for the
last week, and Hamada projects
that most likely he can do the all
around.
The Stanford squad has used
Ellis' injury and recent resurgence
as inspiration for their own perfor
mances. "In a way, Jamie's injury
has been the best thing for our
team; a lot of guys on the periphery
have been forced to train new
events and bring their level of gym
nastics up," said senior co-captain
Keith Wiley. "He looks just as good
now as he did before the injuiy. It's
been a huge motivating factor.
"I think he realizes that it's now
or never, and he doesn't want to
end up regretting this season just
like us."
Despite the weak overall perfor
mance of the team, Wiley again
pulled through with a consistent
performance, as he has all quarter,
and placed first in the all-around.
During the first night of MPSFs,
which consisted of team competi
tion, Wiley landed the top score on
the pommel horse, a 9.8. In Satur
day night's individual events finals,
Wiley placed third on parallel bars,
fourth on vault and fourth on pom
mel horse.
After four years at Stanford,
Wiley is finally attaining the con
sistency that he has long worked
toward. "As a senior, I have a lot
more experience, and I know what
I'm expected to do," he said. "I'm
starting to understand my body
and my gymnastics."
Other highlights from the week
end included freshman Jason Kat
sampes' 9.7 on the pommel horse
and sophomore Scott Finkelstein's
9.775 on the floor exercise. Junior
Clarence Miao also had a solid
night, scoring 9.6 on floor, 9.55 on
pommel horse, 9.4 on vault and 9.1
on the parallel bars.
Hamada discounts the week

end's outcome because it was
accomplished without the full
use of two of his top stars, Ellis
and senior lan Bachrach.
Bachrach bruised his foot at the
March 15 competition coming
down from his rings routine.

Redshirt freshman David hud
low also saw limited act ion due to
a fractured rib.
"At MPSFs I didn't want to
push lan and David," liainada
said. He explained that he is saving
them for Western llegionals.
