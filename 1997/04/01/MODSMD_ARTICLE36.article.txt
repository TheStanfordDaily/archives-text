# Women gymnasts place second at Pac-10s
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Producing the highest Pacific
10 Conference Championship
results in the history of Stanford
women's gymnastics, the Cardi
nal squad came home as runner
up from the cut-throat competi
tion at Arizona March 22.
The impressive fight against
six rigorous squads including
UCLA, Arizona and Arizona
State is especially sweet for the
Stanford team, which lost junior
co-captain Keri Monahan to an
ankle injury the day before the
competition. The injury may
keep the co-captain, who won

numerous all-around titles
throughout the season, from
competing in regionals and
nationals this month.
In facing the tough competi
tion without their spiritual team
leader, squad members worried
for a moment after it happened,
during a missed dismount off the
uneven bars at practice.
"But we dismissed the
thoughts and pulled together
immediately," said junior
Christie Jones. "It was a com
plete team effort; it was amazing
how everyone just stepped up to
fill in."
With sophomore Katie Fitz
patrick, freshman Tara LaMorte

and Jones stepping up to take
all-arounder Monahan's place in
the arena, the Stanford squad
pulled together an impressive
196.325 points, falling just 0.225
short of UCLA's top score of
196.55. Washington took third
place behind the Card with a
total of 196.025.
Although no Cardinal per
former received an individual
title, the prevalence of the Stan
ford gymnasts in top placings on
every apparatus clearly showed
the squad's immense team
potential; the strong and consis
tent routines of each gymnast on
all events allowed the squad to
sneak past prestigious
teams for an impressive overall
team finish.
On the bars, an event that
had sometimes hurt the Card's
overall score earlier in the sea
son, sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami swept the crowd off
its feet with a near-perfect rou
tine which earned her a score of
9.725. Murakami finished sec
ond behind UCLA's Leah
Homma, who acquired the only
perfect 10 given in the meet.
Stanford's freshman rookie
Larissa Fontaine also put on a
strong performance, earning a
9.925 to share fourth place with
Sun Devil rookies Amy Shelton
and Elizabeth Reid and Ari
zona's Heidi Hornbeek. Sopho
more Katie Fitzpatrick took
eighth place to bring the Card to
a first-place finish on the uneven
bars with a score of 49.2.
Pleasing the crowd with pow
erful routines which earned
marks in the high nines,
Murakami, sophomore Tracey
Kohl and Fontaine shared sixth
place on the floor with Reid and

Homma with a score of 9.875.
Freshman Sarah Harding's
energetic floor performance also
helped lift the Card in the tight
match. She scored a 9.8. Stan
ford, UCLA and Oregon State all
came in second place for the
event with 49.125 total team
points, falling just short of
Washington's top mark of
49.225.
Kohl and Fontaine pulled off
two amazing 9.9s on the vault
for seventh-place finishes while
freshman Ann Thananopavarn
followed closely behind with a
score of 9.825 to place 12th.
With a score of 49.2, the Card
came in third on the event
behind Arizona State, which tal
lied 49.4 and Washington, which
scored 49.225.
Stanford's top beam perfor
mance was Fontaine's 12th
place routine which was awarded
a score of 9.85. The Cardinal
gymnasts nonetheless managed
to obtain a total of 48.8 points to
hang on to an overall fourth
place for the event.
Executing powerful routines
throughout the night and pro
ducing a high score of 39.55,
Fontaine narrowly missed the
bronze crown for the all-around,
contenting herself with a close
fourth-place finish.
Murakami, whose flawless
routines placed her fifth in the
all-around with a total of 39.425
points, noted that many mem
bers of the team marked well
deserved best scores at the meet.
She also said she was happy the
squad was able to remain relaxed
despite various media filming
Monahan on the sidelines.

"I'm really proud of my
team," Murakami said. "We
know now we just have to have
confidence and know we are an
awesome team."

Jones said the mass team
effort the Card executed at the
last minute will be of critical
physical and psychological
importance going into region
als.
"We have a clearer sense of
what team effort is — that it is
what it's going to take us all the
way," Jones said.
