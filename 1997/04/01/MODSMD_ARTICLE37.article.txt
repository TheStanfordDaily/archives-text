### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
It was a relaxing and victorious
spring break on the Farm for the
No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team
last week, as the Cardinal cruised
by BYIJ, Arizona and Arizona
State at home to improve its
record to an impressive M -l.
"I was really pleased with (lie
guys," said head coach Dick
Gould. "We had strong, solid
match play all week long."
Today may not be as much of a
cake walk for the Card, as it takes
on the Waves of Pepperdine at I lie
Taube Family Tennis Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
"Pepperdine will be one of our

toughest, home mutches of the
year, along wil h I ISO and I 1C1,A,"
Gould said. "Beginning this week,
the schedule gets really husy as we
play a day and then practice and
then go out Cor another match."
Although the Waves will he a
tough match for the Card, Stan
ford proved its strength over
spring break, as the Cardinal
breezed past anyone who saun
tered in for a game of tennis in its
new stadium.
The Card began the week of
strong matches March 'JJ>, breez
ing past Brigham Young 7 0.

Freshman Bob Bryan sets up for a backhand March 4 against Okla
homa.
American sophomore Ryan
Wolters defeated BYU's Boris
Bosnajakovic 7-6, 6-3. Stanford's
No. 2 player, Ail-American junior
Paul Goldstein, was sidelined with
a stress fracture and sat out as
freshman Bob Bryan fdled the No.
2 position. Bryan had little trouble
with BYU's Dann Battisone, win
ning 6-1, 6-2.
The closest match of the day
was the three set victory for Stan
ford freshman Mike Bryan. He
squeezed past BYU's Manual
Calvo 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Rounding out the singles play
for the Card was freshman Geoff
Abrams, senior Grant Elliott and
junior Charles Hoeveler, all win

Stanford won the doubles point

by taking two matches but lost a
match at the No. 3 doubles posi
tion as Wolters and junior Misha
Palecek fell to BYU's Battisone
and Damien Ward 9-8. In other
doubles action, the Bryan broth
ers cruised past Bosnajakovic and

Abrams defeated Brad Macintosh
and Jason Hardin 8-6.
On Friday, the Cardinal was
out in force again at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium as Stan
ford crushed Pac-10 rival Arizona
6-1. While an easy win for the
Card at home, the Wildcats could
prove a much tougher squad in
Arizona.
"The heat and the altitude
make it much tougher to play
down there, and it is also just a
really tough road trip," Gould said.
While the Card swept the sin
gles in straight sets, dominating
across the board, it lost the dou
bles point to the Wildcats. While

Elliott and Abrams defeated Ari
zona's Jerome Oliveri and Jean-
Noel Lacoste at the No. 2 position,
both the Bryan twins and the duo
of Wolters and Hoeveler lost at the
one and three positions in close
matches. The Bryans fell 9-8 to
Arizona's Henrik Wagner and
Tom Haugland, and Wolters and
Hoeveler lost 8-6 to Wildcats
Roland Kupka and Mike Mackay.
The Card made its last of three
spring break home appearances
Saturday, cruising past Arizona
State 6-1.
In singles, Wolters had a close
first set with Arizona State's Ser
gio Glias, before pulling away to
take the second set easily as well
as the match 7-5, 6-1. Bob Bryan
had to battle a three-set match
before defeating the Sun Devils'
Alex Osterrieth 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
Abrams also bad a tight match, as
the freshman fell to Sun Devil Ed
Carter 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. In other sin

gles matches, Mike Bryan, Elliott
and Hoeveler won in two sets in
the three, live and six positions,
respectively.
Stanford once again had trou
ble in the doubles, losing at the
top and third positions as Gold
stein remained sidelined. The only
win of the day in the doubles for
the Card went to Elliott and
Abrams at the No. 2 position, as
they beat Arizona State's Ed
Carter and Ed Osterrieth 8-6. The
senior-freshman team did not
drop a doubles match all week.
Yet the defending NCAA
champions were not done after
these three solid wins. They prac
ticed doubles late into the day yes
terday and took little time off last
weekend.
"The guys have had a really
strong practice all week, as well as
Friday and Saturday, and then
one day off on Sunday," Gould
said.
