# Men's volleyball improves season record
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
During the past three weeks, the Stanford
men's volleyball team has been busy improv
ing its record. The Cardinal, ranked third in
the nation, enjoyed a very productive time,
winning all five matches it played and
improving its record to 16-3 overall and 1 I -3
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
Stanford's string of victories began at
Burnham Pavilion nearly three weeks ago
on March 12, with a victory over then-No. 6
Ball State. The Cardinal dispatched the Car
dinals, the top team in the Midwest region,
in handy fashion, winning in four games.
Stanford seized command right from the
start, winning the first two games 15-12 and
16-14 respectively. However, in the third
game of the match, the Cardinals rallied and
beat Stanford soundly 15-8.
The Ball State recovery was aided by poor
service receive and an unusually high num
ber of hitting errors by the Cardinal.
Regardless, Stanford quickly proved that
game three had been an aberration, as it.
soundly thumped the Cardinals 15-5 in the
fourth game, sealing yet another victory at
Burnham and preserving its perfect home
record this year.
During the weekend, the Cardinal
returned to league play, squaring off against
Cal State-Northridge, the nation's No. 15
team. Although the Matadors are not a
member of Stanford's division of the MPSF
every league match is critical
The Cardinal responded, winning th<
match in four games 15-5, 15-6, 11 15, 15-8
While the match along with the victory over
Ball State were good victories for tlie team,
head coach Ruben Nieves was not entirely
pleased with his team's effort
"Against both Ball State and NorthridgÂ«
we had a real lapse in the third game, said
Nieves. "Both times, we wanted to come out
and control the match from beginning to
end, but we had some problems with hittin>
and service receive. While they wen both
good wins over ranked teams, we didn't play

good all match in either case."
The team had the following week of! for
finals before returning to practice March 21
t,<> prepare for the March 24 match against
UC-Santa Cruz. While some teams might
have become rusty during the layoff, the
Cardinal showed no signs of weakness
against the Banana Slugs, easily winning the
match in three games 15-3, 15-6, 15-12.
The match against a weaker opponent
gave Stanford an opportunity to play a lot of
its people. Sophomore setter PK Diffen
baugh, senior setter Stewart Chong's back
up, provided outstanding play off the bench.
Replacing Chong after the first game, lie
provided 40 assists in the next two games
and did a great job setting up the Stanford
bitters.
"The Santa Cruz match gave us a good
chance to tune up for our league matches
later in the week," Nieves said. "Even
though I hey are a varsity Division I school,
it is a team we really shouldn't have trouble
with Overall, I thought we played well,
piohahly a B-plus or A-minus grade for the
effort. We controlled the match throughout,
soon tiling we had struggled to do earlier."
While Monday's match against Santa
Cruz may not have been a challenge for the
Cardinal, the match last Friday against Pop
pet dine, the No 6 team in the country, was
expected to be one of Stanford's toughest all
veai 'I lie Waves are a big, physical team
that many believe has a real shot at going all
the way and taking home the championship
in May
In game one, Pepperdine staked its claim
to being one of the country's best, jumping
out to a 7 1 lead and, after allowing Stanford
to get to within one at 10-9, surging ahead to
win the initial game 15-9.
Stanford, not fazed by the Waves' effort,
came back in game two, which saw the Car
dinal pull away after a close start and win 15-
8 I nt be t bird and pivotal game of the match,
the two sides battled back and forth for the
uppet hand. Eventually, Stanford went
ahead 14-11 and appeared to be in control.
However, the Pepperdine defense stiffened,

and, despite having three swings for the final
point of the game, the Cardinal hitters were
thwarted by great digs by the Waves.
Finally at 14-13, with the game in real
jeopardy, Stanford got the game's decisive
point when, after a long rally, one of Pepper
dine's players committed an net error,
falling into the net and giving Stanford the
point and the game.
After the demoralizing loss of the third
game, the Waves' resolve was lost. Stanford
captured the; fourth game and the match in
easy fashion 15-7. Senior outside hitters
Matt Fuerbringer and Mike Lambert provid
ed outstanding hitting for the ('ordinal, with
32 and 36 kills, respectively. Chong, mean
while, supplied the Stanford attack with
great opportunities for kills, recording 102
assists and coming up with 11 digs.
"Lambert, Fuerbringer and Stewart were
great," Nieves said. "The two hitters provid
ed great attack from the outside and back
row all night long. They really bailed us out
whenever we couldn't get a good enough
pass to set our middles.
"As for Stewart, I haven't mentioned him
much, but he has been our most consistent
ly good volleyball player. He is playing the
best volleyball of his career without a doubt.
Ah a team, we played really well too. We
sided out and attacked as well as we have at
any time this year."
Following the outstanding effort against
Pepperdine, Stanford traveled to UC-Irvine
to face the Anteaters. Irvine, one of the
poorest teams in the MPSF, proved no
match for the Cardinal, falling 15-4, 15-2,
15-3. Stanford was completely dominant,
hitting .644 as a team. Freshman Andy Witt
continued his outstanding play, totaling 21
kills and hitting .870, while Lambert com
piler! 13 kills and hit an amazing .929.
"Coupled with Pepperdine, this was our
best weekend of volleyball all year," Nieves
said. "We won two league matches, on the
road, against one very good team and one
poorer team Our level of play was always
high and we will look to continue and
improve upon this level of play."
