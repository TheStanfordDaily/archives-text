# Chinese accused of conspiracies
## 
### Lake Anthony Staff writer 
Hoover Fellow Harry Wu and Political
Science Prof. John Lewis, in a tersely
worded letter to University President Ger
hard Casper, alleged that the Chinese gov
ernment attempted to influence last year's
ASSU election.
The Chinese government was unhappy
over the progress of the Asia-Pacific Schol
ars Program, called the "Rhodes of the
East" by Casper, which was supposed to
begin two years ago.
According to a vacationing director of
University communications speaking to
The Daily on condition of anonymity, Wu
and Lewis claimed the Chinese funneled
money into the campaign of current ASSU
President Bill Shen, a Chinese American.
"We have reason to believe that the stu
dent election held in April 1996 may have
been influenced by a government seeking a
student leader who would prioritize the
commencement of the Asia program," the
administrator said.
However, Casper declined to tell then-
ASSU Elections Commissioner Ryan Med
ders of the warning. The incident has

prompted an investigation into the sources
of the University's endowment nnd the le
gitimacy of Shen as the ASSU's chief
Shen was criticized at the onset of his
administration for overspending the ASSU
funds allocated for use by the president.
However, as soon as the allegations became
public, Shen was in the black again.
The Daily has learned that students re
ceiving financial aid from the Chinese gov
ernment paid money to attend top-level
meetings with Shen, which brought the
president out of near bankrupcy. Addition
ally, ASSU insiders claim that Shen al
lowed some students to sleep in his posh
Tresidder Union office overnight.
A Chinese government spokesman de
nied the allegations. "China, like the Stan
ford student body, regards the ASSU as
only vaguely legitimate," said Chinese For
eign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai.
"We would hope, however, that as a Chi
nese American, Mr. Shen would advance
the interests of the Asia-Pacific Scholars
Program," Tiankai said.
Casper, flying first class to the Far East
for a week-long business trip, did not re
turn repeated calls to his air telephone.
