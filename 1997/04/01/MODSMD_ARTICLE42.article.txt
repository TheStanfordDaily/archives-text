# Three resign at Rainbow School
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
Three resignations in the span of three
months at Stanford's Rainbow Nursery School
have lead to a strong outcry from parents, who
say they feel that the nationally accredited
school's program and environment have lost
their continuity.
The Rainbow School, one of four preschool
programs run by the Stanford Work Life Cen
ter, lost former Director Jan Krinsley in De
cember when she turned in her resignation to
teach at a public school.
A search committee was formed following
Krinsley's resignation in order to help Rainbow
School Program Coordinator Dorothy Steele
hire a new director. The committee was com
posed of one parent and the two remaining
teachers at the time, Joyce McClure and Luce
Jorgenson.
The search lasted 2 1/2 months, at which
time a new director was hired, a woman named
Micki Cooley. According to the parents, this
hiring decision was not supported by the com
mittee.
On March 7, McClure said she was"present
ed with a letter that criticized my ability to
work with my colleagues and suggested to me
that I would be terminated." McClure in turn
sent a letter to parents in which she said "the
only way to defend my character was to resign."
Five days after McClure's resignation, the
newly hired director allegedly assaulted a 4-
year-old boy. Two parents who witnessed the
alleged incident claimed Cooley "lost her tem-

per in class and struck [the boy] in the face with
the palm of her hand."
According to one of the parent witnesses,
Cooley admitted having struck the boy after
ward when she took the child to Steele's office.
That night, Cooley offered her resignation.
McClure said she attempted to rescind her
resignation but was unsuccessful. On March
14, a letter written to Steele signed by all of the
parents of Rainbow Nursery School, said
"Given the recent disruptive changes in staff
... we believe that the most important thing for
our children is to secure the return of Joyce Mc-
Clure through the remainder of the school
year."
Numerous meetings among parents, Steele,
McClure, Work Life Center Director Kathleen
Sullivan and Sally Dickson, director of the Of
fice of Multicultural Development, have failed
to bring McClure back, however.
According to one parent, Sullivan and Dick
son both support Steele's decision not to allow
McClure to return.
Although Steele acknowledged that Krinsley
left to teach at a public school, when questioned
about the other resignations, she said there is
"a law protecting all employed persons that rea
sons for their leaving are private."
Currently, Jorgenson is the only teacher
who has been with the program throughout the
year. Steele has secured two teachers to stay at
the school until June. The teachers are perma
nent substitutes, a status which, said Steele,
will allow a new director to be free to hire.
Steele said she believes the Rainbow School
is "not in deep trouble. How we get over this pe-

riod of hiring again is about forming relation
ships, and you don't do that in one minute."
In their letter to Steele, the parents wrote,
"More than anything else, we want a return to
the continuity that [McClure and Jorgenson]
provided." The letter also urges Steele to re
hire McClure immediately, saying, "Our chil
dren want her back now."
While concerns are present about the incon
sistency of the staff, parents and administra
tors alike said the real focus should be on the
children. Steele said her job was to "help our
community at Rainbow School bring itself peo
ple whose job it is to raise children together."
The parents, too, concentrate on the chil
dren. One parent said, "The content of the mes
sage is the welfare of the children. The children
simply need their beloved teacher." Following
McClure's resignation, the parent said his 5-
year-old son refused to go to school.
The boy's parent said the program's admin
istration "cares more about saving face after a
series of disastrous errors in decision making
than what is best for the children."
The parent of one 4-year-old girl said, "I'm
at the point where I'm trying to decide whether
to pull my daughter out. As parents, we're all
very frustrated that our voices don't seem to
count at all. I do have two other children and I
don't think I would send them [to Rainbow
School] at this point."
With only 2 1/2 months left in the school
year, the search for a new director continues.
Steele said the changes have been "stressful on
the grownups because we're worried that
everything will go OK."
