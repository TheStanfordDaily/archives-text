# ASSU nets $700,000 gambling
## 'John Hall' to be dedicated in honor of financial manager's Vegas success 
### Tyun Gah Editorial staff 
In an unexpected stroke of good luck
for the ASSU, Financial Manager John
Hall added more than $700,000 to the
association's bottom line during a 24-
hour spring break stopover in Las
Vegas.
Hall parlayed $30,000 from the
ASSU special-fee refund account into
the large winnings in a high-stakes
craps game at the new Luxor resort. His
strategy utilized a system designed by
senior Michael Schaps and perfected at
Sig Ep Casino Night.
"Craps is clearly the only responsible

investment in the gaming field," Hall
said. "With the right system, you can al
most balance the odds of your winning
with those of the casino."
Hall received widespread praise for
his gambling prowess.
"This system appears to be a pro
foundly innovative growth vehicle, al
though somewhat unorthodox," said
Stanford Management Co. CEO Lau
rance Hoagland. He will recommend
that the Board of Trustees consider the
issue's implications for the University's
responsible investment policy.
En route to his success, Hall had to
make more than one sacrifice.
"The scene at the craps table was not

pretty," said Daniel Bressler, the Stan
ford Directory project director, who was
with Hall. "John went without sleep for
36 hours straight. He kept saying, "Let
it ride, let it ride."
The winnings will likely be used to
enable Stanford Student Enterprises to
bring an In-N-Out Burger franchise to
Tresidder Union. "The chief obstacle
will be renovating the building to allow
for drive-through service," Hall said.
ASSU President Bill Shen suggested
that part of the winnings be donated to
the University as seed money for a new
auditorium to be named in honor of the
financial manager.
