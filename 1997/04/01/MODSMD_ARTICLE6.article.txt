### Belul Tropoje Senior staff writer 
Members of Students Against Genocide,
the Albanian Students Organization and
Miles to Go, an organization that has been
traveling to Bosnia to provide aid, have
scheduled a trip to Albania and plan to join
the rebellion.
The students plan to begin their invasion
in the southern regions of the country, most
likely from the port of Vlore, which is still in
rebel hands.
"We want to provide manpower and
weapons to the struggling rebels," said
Melvina Cheung, a member of Miles to Go.
She said Stanford students are desperately
needed to assist the rebels in unseating the
new coalition government before it can sta
bilize.
Already 15 students have signed up to join
and have donated their own personal
weapons, including the kitchen knives from
Synergy and Chi Theta Chi. Students are still
being recruited, however, and are being
asked to donate money to buy arms, as well as
artillery they may posses.
"We'll be in Whito Plaza every afternoon
this week, talking to students about the rebel
cause," said SAGE member Tin Gazivoda.
"We want to give the people of Albania a
means by which they can have a connection
with the outside world, a way they can get
military arms. Students battalion will
strengthen their forces, and at the same time
we can learn Albanian guerrilla warfare tech

niques.
Cheung said that she thought the trip
would bean important learning opportunity.
"It will be a very positive experience," ('lie

ungsaid. "I think it is important because it is
the first time large numbers of Stanford stu
dents can go into Albania. We can do so much
good."

Albanians cried out at the news that Stanford students were planning to save them and
that troops would soon arrive with arms reinforcements.
