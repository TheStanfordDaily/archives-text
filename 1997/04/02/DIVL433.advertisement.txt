HOW
CLOSE ARE
WE TO A
CURE FOR
CANCER?
IN HER CASE, ABOUT 31 MILES.
While advances in medical
research have given thousands
of Americans with cancer more
hope than ever, we still
haven't been able to
solve the most
basic prob
lem of
transportation.
But you can
help. And we hope you will.
Through the American
Cancer Society's Road to
Recovery program, you can
help by volunteering to drive a
cancer patient to and from a
treatment facility. If you have a
car, safe driving skills, and can
drive as little as one morning or
afternoon a month, you can
help give someone the most
precious of all gifts: the
chance for a fuller life.
For more information, call
your American Cancer Society

today And help us drive
cancer from the face of
the earth.
