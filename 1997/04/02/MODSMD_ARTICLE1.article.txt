## Flicks brings back 'The Graduate' 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Following a one-year hiatus, the
tradition of showing "The Graduate"
as the final movie before Commence
ment has returned to Sunday Flicks.
According to junior Matt Garling
house, the Flicks manager, the annu
al showing has been presented to the
student body for at least 10 consecu
tive years and was canceled last year
pending renegotiation of the film's
distribution rights.
Garlinghouse said although his
predecessor was not able to get the
rights last year due to the distribu
tor's plans to re-release it, the film's
reintroduction in San Francisco and
New York earlier this year enabled
him to retain the right to broadcast
the film.
"A lot of seniors were disappointed

last year, so I decided to get it back,"
said Garlinghouse, whose job as man
ager includes selecting the movies to
show Sunday nights at Memorial Au
ditorium.
"The Graduate" stars a young
Dustin Hoffman as a recent, direc
tionless college graduate who is se
duced by Mrs. Robinson, one of his
parents' friends, as he tries to adjust
to the adult world.
Garlinghouse said he obtained a
new print of "The Graduate," made
from the original copy, which has im
proved visual and audio quality. He
said the sound has been touched up
and additional work has been done on
lighting and added that he is happy
that the seniors will have the chance
to view the film.
Senior Colleen Noonan, a commu
nication major, said although she has
not made it to Flicks much this year,

she will definitely take part in the
Stanford tradition.
" 'The Graduate' recognizes life as
it should be lived — unadulterated,
unrestrained and uninhibited," Noo
nan said.
Christian Dodge, a senior double
majoring in biology and psychology,
agreed.
"I really like the theme of it, a
mother seducing a friend's son,"
Dodge said. "There are lots of lessons
to be learned about the real world."
Senior Hilda Saffari added that she
could not think of a more relevant
movie with which to graduate. Al
though last year's graduating class
voted to see the 1980s classic "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off" when they discov
ered "The Graduate" was unavail
able, many of them got together in
Cubberley Auditorium for a screen
ing. The auditorium was packed with

emotional seniors, Saffari said.
Saffari also added that she did not
mind the change in the Flicks rates at
all. Individual tickets are now selling
for $4, up $1 from the previous
charge. However, any student that
buys a quarter pass through their res
ident assistant can get it for $18,
while other students have to pay the
normal price of $20.
Garlinghouse said the point of the
change was to reinforce the power of
Flicks as a social dynamic. He added
that Flicks was a "much bigger deal
before," but due to the quick rise in
pass charges, it has surrendered to a
less important part in Stanford social
life.
"The more people that go to Flicks,
the more fun it's going to be," Gar
linghouse said. "I'm just tweaking to
bring it more in check of historical
price ratios."
