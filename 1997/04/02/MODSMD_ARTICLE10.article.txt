Islam Awareness Week, an student-run event
geared toward promoting understanding and aware
ness of Islam among Stanford students through panels,
speakers and information sessions began this week and
will continue through Saturday.
The week, organized by the Muslim Students
Awareness Network with help from the Islamic Soci
ety, the ASSU Program Board and the Office of Stu
dent Affairs, is the largest event of its kind to be held on
the Stanford campus.
Organizers hope to promote awareness of Islam on
the campus at large, especially toward non-Muslim stu
dents who might have misconceptions about the reli
gion. "I think the majority of society identifies Muslims
as they see them on t he television " said junior Sayema
I lameed, president of the Muslim Students Awareness
Network.
"We want to show people that the Muslims por
trayed in movies like 'Executive Decision' and sitcoms
are not representative of Muslim society," said senior
Imran Maskatia, president of the Islamic Society.
The week began Monday with a banquet dinner cel
ebrating 40 years of Islamic activism at Stanford for
alumni, faculty and students. Alumni Hussein Al-Hus
sein, Aladdin Nassar and Marghoub Quraishi shared
their experiences as Muslims at Stanford
Last night, speakers Asifa Quraishi and Maha El-
Genaidi discussed their perspectives as Muslim-Ameri
can female activists. Hameed said she was very im
pressed by Quraishi's ability to shatter stereotypes

about women in Islam as repressed, subservient indi
viduals.
Some more interactive workshops will be held as
well. Today, a workshop will take place in Manzanita
Dining Hall answering the question, "What is Halal
meat?" and including samples. Languages Division
Lecturer Khalil Barhoum will teach an Islamic calligra
phy workshop at 6 p.m. in the Kimball Lounge. "We
wanted informational and fun events. ... Calligraphy
has been one of the most influential arts of Islamic cul
tures," said Maskatia said.
Tomorrow features a presentation on "Islam and
the African-American experience" by Abdel-Malek Ah,
director of Masjid Al-Islam, a mosque in Oakland. Stu
dents are invited to Friday prayers at 12:30 p.m. at the
Bechtel International Center.
Organizers expect the keynote address, "Islamopho
bia: TV Muslims vs. the Real Thing," to be the highlight
of the week. Speaker Nihad Awad, executive director of
the Council for American-Islamic Relations, will dis
cuss what Muslims as a whole and individually face
every day."He will be comparing the myths and reali
ties of Islam," said Maskatia.
Students also hope to increase awareness of Islam as
a prevalent world religion and encourage University
programs about Islam.
"This is something Stanford lacks, and if we don't
make ourselves heard, people won't know that," said
Maskatia.
Because this is the program's first year, organizers
hope to introduce students to Islam and build upon that
knowledge in future years.
