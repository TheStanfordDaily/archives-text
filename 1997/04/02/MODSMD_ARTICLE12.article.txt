# Stock market rebounds slightly
## Dow gains 27.57 points, halting trecherous two-day slide 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones indus
trials finished higher yesterday after a day of
erratic trading on a set of economic reports
that gave mixed signals about the likelihood
that interest rates will keep rising.
The Dow climbed 27.57 points to close at
6611.05, regaining a small part of the nearly
300-point loss it suffered in the previous two
trading sessions.
Optimistic investors seized on a small part

of a report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management released yesterday
morning. It showed that prices paid for raw
materials were steady in March, indicating
that inflation remains benign.
But the purchasing managers' index of
overall economic activity rose. In addition, the
federal government reported the highest con
struction spending increase in 11 months and
the Conference Board's leading economic indi

cators index posted its biggest gain in a year.
The selling since last Thursday had raised
serious concern about whether the bull mar
ket that has carried stocks to new heights for
nearly 7 years is over.
Monday's loss of 157.11 in the Dow com
bined with 140 points in the previous session
to produce the worst back-to-back point loss
since the 1987 crash and the worst two-day
percentage loss since 1990.
