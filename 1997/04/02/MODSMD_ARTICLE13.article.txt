# Bungled suicide bombings escalate tensions in Mideast

### 
NETZARIM, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli troops shot
and killed two Palestinians and two others blew them
selves up in bungled suicide bombings yesterday, one
of the deadliest days yet in a growing crisis in Middle
East peacemaking.
The bombers apparently had meant to destroy
Israeli school buses outside Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip, Israelis said. The attacks come during a
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which
broke down last month over new Israeli construction
in disputed east Jerusalem, and triggered new accusa
tions from both sides.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insist
ed that the suicide bombings showed that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has sanctioned attacks by Islam
ic militants.
The twin attacks are "proof that the terror cam
paign continues," Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu later decided to make a 12-hour
visit Monday to the United States to talk with
President Clinton on the crisis, the prime minis

ter's spokesman said.
Israel's Channel 2 television said Clinton intended
to propose a compromise to Netanyahu.
Yesterday's first explosion went off about a mile
from the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, south of
Gaza City. A Netzarim school bus was running late,
which meant it was away from the site when the
bomb exploded.
Palestinian police disputed Israeli allegations that
the other explosion, at Kfar Darom, was a suicide
bombing. They said Israeli troops threw explosives at
a taxi and a donkey cart, killing a Palestinian
bystander and wounding seven taxi passengers.
But Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Sha
hak, said Islamic militants set off both blasts. He said
the suicide bombers wore Palestinian police uniforms
and were Islamic militants belonging to either the
Hamas or Islamic Jihad groups.
Israel TV said the explosive kits were similar to one
used by a Hamas-afTdiated suicide bomber who killed
three Israeli women in a Tel Aviv cafe on March 21.
