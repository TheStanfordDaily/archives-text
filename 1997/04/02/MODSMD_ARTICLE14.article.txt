Court upholds immigration law
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A new law that makes
it easier for the government to deport illegal
immigrants and block the entry of others took
effect yesterday after a federal court turned back
a challenge by immigrant-rights groups.
"We're going forward. The law and accompany
ing regulations are being implemented as original
ly planned," said Andrew Lluberes, a spokesman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
But the law has thousands of illegal and legal
immigrants fearing the future. Several hundred
people, many of them Haitians, took to the streets
Tuesday near an INS office in Miami to vent their
frustrations. Many of the immigrants had come to
the United States in search of new lives.
"Now all of a sudden they've changed the rules.
They're telling them to go back home," said
Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida
Immigrant Advocacy Center.
In Washington, both sides returned to court
yesterday as the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights pur
sued another part of their complaint. A judge
scheduled a hearing on that issue for Friday.
Under the new law, INS officers may refuse
entry to anyone bearing invalid or fraudulent doc
uments unless a credible fear of persecution or
asylum claim is made. It also reduces the rights of
federal courts to review decisions about deporta
tion and exclusion.

Advocates for immigrants maintain the INS is
violating the law and the intent of Congress by
not ordering immigration officers to routinely
inform people of their right to apply for asylum
and consult with an attorney.
Telephone giants merge
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - SBC Communica
tions Inc. yesterday acquired Pacific Telesis
Group in a deal worth $16.7 billion, completing
the third-largest merger in U.S. history.
California regulators on Monday gave final
approval to the merger, which creates a local tele
phone powerhouse covering seven states.
SBC agreed to conditions set by the state's
Public Utility Commission, which included a
refund of $213.5 million over five years to cus
tomers of Pacific Bell, PacTel's phone subsidiary.
The Federal Communications Commission
approved the merger in January, rejecting chal
lenges from competitors.
SBC Chairman and CEO Edward E. Whitacre
Jr. said the deal emphasizes "exploding demand
for Internet access and high-speed data services,"
as well as wireless communications.
The new SBC will provide local phone service
in California, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas. Its 100,000
employees will include 1,000 new jobs promised
by the companies for four new headquarters
buildings in California.
