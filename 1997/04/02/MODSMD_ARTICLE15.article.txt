# No April Fool: Snow hits East
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) - New Eng
land towns had begun putting
their plows away after a winter of
below-average snowfall, and hard
ware stores had set up their dis
plays of patio furniture. Then,
April Fool!
Boston started digging out yes
terday after its biggest snowfall
ever in April, a Nor'easter that
blew away the tip of one of the
masts on the USS Constitution,
the sturdy frigate known as Old
Ironsides.
Snow piled up nearly <i feet deep
from New Jersey into Mas
sachusetts, shutting down air
ports, closing schools and knock
ing out electricity to hundreds of
thousands of people, some of
whom won't see their power
restored for days.
"It's a practical joke. It's April
Fool's Day," Christie Humphrey
told her astonished 2-year old son,
Sam, as he looked at the snow in
North Andover.
Strangers to the area thought
differently.
"This is what 1 think of in a
Currier and Ives print. It's just
beautiful," said -Joe Moore, a visi
tor from Oklahoma City enjoying
Boston's Lexington Square
Forecasters said the snow prob
ably will melt gradually without
causing any serious Hooding when
temperatures climb into the 50s
and 60s by the weekend. Most of
the winter's snow had already
melted, and there has been little
spring rain to soak the ground.
The huge storm blew rain, sleet
and snow from Maryland to Maine
beginning Monday. By yesterday
afternoon, 3,'} inches of snow had
fallen at Milford, Mass.; .'{2 inches
in upstate New York; .'!() inches at
Hopkinton, Mass., and High Point,
N.J.; and 27 inches at Jaffrey,
N.II.
The Baltimore Orioles post
poned their opening day baseball
game against the Kansas City Roy
als because of wind gusting to .'i.'t
mph. Ground crews shoveled snow
off the field.
Boston's trolley lines were
closed for the first time in nearly
two decades. Many colleges also
were closed — including Harvard
School, shut for the first time

in nearly 20 years. Harvard stu
dents used cafeteria trays to tobog
gan down the snow-covered stairs
of Widener I -ibrary.
"I love if when the weather
forces people out of their routine,"
said Andrew 1 at imer, a Somerville
lawyer who played hooky from
work t'> I'd toss country skiing in
Cambridge.
Bost ... iiOgan Airport stopped
letting planes in or out on Monday
afternoon and was closed most of
I he day while crews cleared away 2
feet of snow. Many travelers were
stranded at the airport.
"For the last 24 hours, we've
become very intimate. If you can't
do that, then you've lost some
thing somewhere," said Susan
Tremblav, 32, who was trying to
get home to her family in Atlanta.
Connecticut's Bradley Interna
tional Airport in Windsor Locks,
near Hartford, was closed
overnight.
"The airplane doesn't want me.
The hotels are full. Nobody wants
me," lamented Vincent Mule of
Meriden, ( l onn.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge
sent the National Guard to help
dig out cars stalled in the middle of
highways. About 1,000 Pennsylva
nia motorists spent Monday and
yesterday in their cars, and 4,000
others stayed in shelters.
The 2 l inches at Logan Airjxjrt
made if Boston's third biggest
snowfall on record, and the largest
ever in April, the National Weath
er Service said.
Until Monday, Boston had
received just 2(i.f> inches of snow
for the winter, well below the 'Ill
inch average and last year's record
107.6 inches.
Across the region, wind gusted
to nearly 70 mph during the night.
In Boston Harbor, gusts to 50 mph
sheared oil the top of the USS
Constitution's foremast, echoing
damage caused by cannon lire dur
ing the War of IHI2.
The biggest problem was
downed trees and utility poles,
which blacked out more than
200,000 customers in Mas
sachusetts, more than 100,000 in
New York, nearly 98,000 in Con
necticut and smaller numbers in
neighboring states.
