Overseas Studies center
in Mexico will broaden
students' global views

The overseas studies
Program is adding another
international site to its
existing seven locations this win
ter, but it won't be overseas. In
conjunction with the Universidad
de las Americas-Puebla, one of
Mexico's top universities, Stanford
students will be able to study
south of the border in Puebla,
Mexico, just 1 1/2 hours from Mex
ico City. This is a wonderful devel
opment for the Overseas Studies
Program and, more important, for
those students interested in learn
ing about this Latin American
country from first-hand experi
ence.
An overseas experience is
important to any student who
seeks a better, more accurate
understanding of another country :
its culture, its economy, its politi
cal system. That's why the Over
seas Studies Program is so impor
tant; it allows students to study
their own subjects in depth in
other countries from different aca
demic and cultural perspectives.
Overseas Studies is also a popu
lar program. More students apply
than there are positions available
in almost all of the Overseas Stud
ies centers. It's understandable
that programs are limited in size,
but it is very unfortunate that stu
dents wanting this experience
must go elsewhere, outside of
Stanford. This new addition not
only broadens the mostly Euro
pean venue of the Overseas Stud
ies Program but also will allow
more students who want an off
campus academic experience to
have it through a quality, Stan
ford-directed program.
Most of Stanford's overseas pro
grams offer relevant courses for
those studying such diverse sub

jects as art, biology, engineering
and sociology, among many others.
This is the strength of Stanford's
overseas program. However, most
centers are located on the Euro
pean continent — with the excep
tions of Santiago, Chile, and Kyoto,
Japan — and this is its greatest
weakness. With the new center in
Mexico and a proposed center in
Beijing, the Overseas Studies Pro
gram is responding to a world that
is decidedly less Eurocentric.
Mexico will be a valuable addi
tion to the Overseas Studies pro
gram on both economic and social
grounds. Since the signing and
ratification of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, Mexico
has been the center of controversy
with groups ranging from Ameri
can labor unions to drug enforce
ment agencies. It has become one
of the United States's most impor
tant economic partners and conse
quently has a profound effect on
the U.S. economy — witness the
impassioned debates of the U.S.
bailout of Mexico's peso crisis. For
those students working on these
economic issues, study in Mexico
will offer them the chance of closer
examination of that country's role
in the global economy.
Furthermore, the United States
and Mexico have a shared history
that binds them together. Specifi
cally, California and the Southwest
were the scene of armed conflict
between the two developing
nations and are now the scene of
cultural mergings. California,
especially, knows the importance
that Chicanos will play in its
future success as that group
becomes the new ethnic majority.
Perhaps an understanding of this
cultural heritage will be strength
ened via the creation of the new
center.
The creation of this center is
recognition of the continued
importance of Mexico and its peo
ple to America; it will expose Stan
ford students to the real-world
issues affecting the people of Mex
ico first hand.
