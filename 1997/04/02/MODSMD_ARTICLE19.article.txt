Building peace without builidng Israeli settlements

ON FRIDAY MARCH 21, a Tel
Aviv cafe was bombed, killing
three Israelis and wounding 48.
The radical Islamic group, Hamas,
appears to be responsible for this atroci
ty. In Israel and abroad, public discus
sion of the Palestinian-Israeli peace pro
cess has once again shifted to issues of
terrorism.
We have great sympathy for the inno
cent victims of this tragedy and unequiv
ocally condemn its perpetrators. Yet this
bombing and the angry demonstrations
that have followed them on the West
Bank should surprise no one. All knowl
edgeable observers, including the Israeli
security services, predicted such a
response if the Israeli government pro
ceeded with plans to construct a new
Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem
at Jabal Abu Ghneim / Har Homa.
Since taking office last May, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
repeatedly humiliated and provoked the
Palestinians with whom he alleges he is
trying to make peace. He refused to meet
with Yasser Arafat for months, delaying
a withdrawal from part of Hebron
already agreed to bv the previous Israeli
government. Then he announced his
intention both to expand existing Jewish

settlements in the West Bank and to con
struct new ones, thereby violating the
1993 Oslo accords that leave the disposi
tion of Israeli settlements to be negotiat
ed in the final-status talks, which have
yet to begin in earnest.
In September, Netanyahu authorized
construction of a new entrance to an
archaeological tunnel in East Jerusalem
that runs close to Muslim holy places,
fully aware that previous Israeli govern
ments had refrained from such actions to
avoid arousing Palestinian protest. Final
ly, on March 14 Netanyahu ordered
ground-breaking to begin on a new Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem at Har
Homa, acceding to the demands of his
cabinet members angered by the partial
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron.
Israel's implementation of the Hebron
evacuation accord has been similarly
provocative, unilateral and inadequate.
The agreement required three additional
Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank
by mid-1998. Israel has proposed an ini
tial withdrawal from only 9 percent of the
West Bank, the majority of which is
already jointly patrolled by Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. The meager scope
of this wit hdrawal has convinced many
Palestinians that they will not gain much

more territory from the Oslo process.
Israel remains in full control of nearly 70
percent of the West Bank and continues
to expand the road network between Jew
ish settlements, preventing territorial
contiguity between Palestinian-controlled
areas.
The new settlement at Har Homa is
part of a broader blueprint on which
both the Labor and Likud parties agree:
expanding control over the greater
Jerusalem area, rendering Israel's
annexation of the eastern city (which is
not recognized by any other country)
irreversible and non-negotiable. Because
1967 both Labor and Likud governments
have expropriated more than a third of
the land in East Jerusalem, constructing
38,000 apartments for Jews while autho
rizing only 500 new housing units for
Arabs. The planned 6,500 units at Har
Homa will complete the encirclement of
the Palestinian neighborhoods of East
Jerusalem with Jewish housing,
strengthening Israel's claim to the city
and biasing the final status talks on
Jerusalem's future.
The Netanyahu government's repeat
ed provocations have convinced many
Palestinians that it does not wish to
implement the Oslo accords. Indeed, its

proposal to suspend the implementation
of those accords and begin final status
negotiations is designed to avoid the fur
ther withdrawals from occupied territory
to which it has already agreed, even as
Israel's hold over East Jerusalem is
solidified through construction of new
Jewish neighborhoods. The Clinton
administration has criticized Netanyahu
for this strategy but continues to protect
Israel from condemnation by the United
Nations Security Council, vetoing two
resolutions in March.
The slow annexation of the West Bank
under the guise of peace, with no serious
consideration of Palestinian interests,
can only provoke further violence from a
people who feel they have nothing more
to lose. We call upon the Clinton admin
istration to move beyond its empty
phrases and to demand that Israel stop
building settlements and start building a
just and equitable peace.
