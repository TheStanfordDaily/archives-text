# Stein's column tapped into energy generated by women's basketball
## 
### 
As two of the several people who
got caught up in the basketball fever
of this year's men's and women's
teams, we especially appreciated Teri

Stein's eloquent and thoughtful col
umn on Monday. We actually drove to
Missoula over the break, in part
because our friends who live there
have been bagging for us to visit but
mainly to continue to experience the
excitement and inspiration of the
women's basketball team. At the last
minute, we were also able to make the
game in Cinncinati. After this
thrilling yet heartbreaking game, we

had to do some real thinking.
We realized that, if the Cardinal had
won, it would have been easy to ride the
high that the win would produce. We
could have gone back to Stanford and
been completely jazzed by the win and
the energy of the team.
With a loss, we wore forced to look at
the entire season and draw our inspira
tion from all that the team represented,
as Stein communicated so well in her

column. It was a little bit harder this
way but just as fulfilling.
Thanks to Stein, and even more so,
thanks to the Stanford women's basket
ball team for a great season!
