## Oh, the humanities of it all 
### 
SO IT'S APRIL now, I'm a senior
and I still haven't started looking
for a job. Sure I've gone through
the motions: visited the CPPC, told my
parents I've sent out resumes (I haven't),
asked myself the big questions. What do I
want to do with my life? What has my
Stanford education prepared me for? My
father assures me that my knowledge of
modern literary and intellectual history
has surely prepared me for something â€”
law school, maybe, or something socially
useful like that.
But the more I think about it, the
more I realize that what I really want to
be is not socially useful at all, at least not
according to any prevailing standard.
What I really want to be is a scholar, a
writer, a thinker, a teacher, a journalist,
a critic. What I really want to do won't
make much money for any corporation or
any politician, won't create a new cut
ting-edge technology and won't dictate
U.S. health care policy. What I really
want to do is, for all intents and purpos
es, useless.
I'm not one of those who believe that
the humanities should be an ivory tower
or a walled-in intellectual enclave. I don't
take pride in the fact that my interests
(art and literature) are different from
most people's. I believe that the humani
ties are inspiring and important, that art
and literature are socially useful pursuits
and that scholarship is for everyone, not
just professors and students.

I did not learn this view at Stanford.
In high school I was taught that to be a
scholar was a special calling. At the very
least, the "great" thinkers and the
"great" pieces of expression (whatever
those might be) were supposed to reveal
what makes us uniquely human. It was
only when I got to Stanford that I experi
enced anti-intellectualism. First it was
CIV. The unanimous consensus on CIV
seemed to be that at least it gave you a
nominal understanding of the "classics";
someone once told me that CIV is good
"in case someone brings up Madame
Bovary at a cocktail party." Presumably
these are the cocktail parties of Wall
Street and Silicon Valley or whatever
socially useful institutions we sell our
selves to after we graduate.
It didn't take long to figure out that
what my Stanford education would
amount to was a commodity that I had
bought, my parent's investment in my
own future market value. Stanford is my
ticket to a comfortable upper-middle
class life, where knowing about Madame
Bovary is good for cocktail parties and
not much else.
I've learned a lot at Stanford over the
past four years, about history and cul
ture, art and politics, "great" literature
and new ideas. I have been taught by
many dedicated and brilliant professors.
But my view to the future is grim: When
I go to graduate school, I can look for
ward to cramming all my intellectual

energy into one tiny area of specialization
that I will package and market to pub
lishers and universities. I will think and
write and live under my aforementioned
delusion: that the study of the humani
ties is important and socially useful or
that I can convince students it is.
Can we realistically imagine a world in
which Bill Clinton consults the novels of
Toni Morrison for tips on domestic poli
cy? Or where Bill Gates reads Marx for a
finer understanding of the capitalist
economy? Of course not. When it comes
down to it, our so-called liberal arts edu
cation is, at best, a deflated ideal, not
much more than an ideology handed out
on a course syllabus. The humanities
seem willfully ignorant of the sciences
and vice-versa. No one is interested in
talking about how all of our specialized
fields of study, from rocket science to lit
erary theory, might relate to each other
or to real life. How can we make scholar
ship useful, desirable and important?
It's a question I've only just begun to
answer. For now, I'm just trying to figure
out how to turn modern thought and lit
erature into food and rent. Any ideas?

Rula Razek, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, isn't nearly so
negative about Stanford as this article
makes her seem.
