## Fuzzy tummies everywhere! Tickle me up, tickle me down 
### 
"Heh heh heh, heh heh heh. That tick
les!"
— My Tickle-Me Elmo
YES, THAT'S RIGHT, over spring
break I bought myself a Tickle-
Me Elmo doll. I am 22 years old, a
soon-to-be Stanford graduate, and yes, I
now own a bright red, furry monster
with an orange nose and big googly eyes
that giggles uncontrollably when you
squeeze him in his fuzzy little tummy.
You got a problem with that?
All the experts say it's very important
to get in touch with your inner child —
ew, gross — and as long as your inner
child is "Ages 1 1/2 and Up" like the box
requires, I think a Tickle-Me Elmo is the
perfect way to reacquaint yourself with
the tiny tike within. Plus, you get to use
phrases like "fuzzy little tummy" in
everyday conversation and they actually
sound appropriate.
As anyone who has ever met the cud
dly fellow would agree, Tickle-Me Elmo
is empirically cute. Regardless of all the

Christmas hype — countless stories of
mothers selling their first born to buy a
Tickle-Me Elmo for their second born —
that little ticklish guy is just so
adorable. You tickle his tummy once and
he chuckles, saying "That tickles!" You
tickle him again and he guffaws, crying
"Oh boy!" One more time and he laughs
like crazy and shakes his fuzzy little
booty in a wild, raucous giggle that is
really, really beginning to annoy the hell
out of my roommate.
All of my friends are just waiting for
me to get sick of Elmo's saccharine little
self giggling all day and "Oh boy!"-ing all
night as long as his Duracells can keep on
ticking. They say Elmo and I are in our
"honeymoon" period. I try to tell them
how undeniably cute he is and how I'll
never shove him into a musty old trunk
in the attic with my Cabbage Patch Kid
because Elmo is just so cute and Cabbage
Patch Kids may be one-of-a-kind and
have dimples and Xavier Roberts might
just send them a card on their birthday,
but they certainly don't giggle when you

tickle their fuzzy little tummies.
I just can't understand why all my
friends doubt my sanity for owning a
Tickle-Me Elmo. Are they afraid that 1
was unwillingly sucked in by the Tickle-
Me Elmo craze? Are they frightened that
a 22-year-old who spends quality time
with a giggling stuffed animal is in des
perate need of psychotherapy? Or are
they just plain jealous that they don't
have an Elmo to call their very own?
We all know the truth now, don't we?
They're just jealous that Elmo loves
me, so they try to discount their feelings
by making me appear to be strange.
They are all too happy to play with the
boisterous little monster if given the
chance, and then maintain that it's
weird for anyone (particularly me) to
have one. Aside from the scant few who
were visibly frightened by Elmo's con
vulsive giggling, everyone seems to have
fun during the time they spend with
Elmo (including Elmo himself). People
walk by, hear the giggling and beeline
into the room to pick up the first thing

they see with googly eyes. Pretty soon,
they are going to have to start signing up
for time slots if they expect to spend any
serious time with the little guy.
The greatest thing about owning my
very own Tickle-Me Elmo is the Tickle-
Me Elmo "Instruction Sheet" that the
good folks at Tyco have provided me so I
may enjoy proper use of my Elmo. The
instructions have such headings as
"Before playing with Tickle-Me Elmo
please read this" and "How to play with
Tickle-Me Elmo." At first, I kept throw
ing Elmo against the wall hoping that he
would giggle until finally I read "How to
play with Tickle-Me Elmo" and realized I
was supposed to "Tickle Elmo's belly."
Oops, my bad. It's a good thing I finally
read those instructions!
But I digress.
Did you know that the Tickle-Me
craze is growing? Elmo is not the only
Tickle-Me doll on the shelf nowadays.
There are now Tickle-Me Ernies, Tick
le-Me Big Birds, Tickle-Me Cookie Mon
sters and a plethora of other Sesame

Street characters in full Tickle-Me
regalia, lining the Tickle-Me shelves at
your local Tickle-Me toy store. More
Tickle-Me merchandise than anyone
could ever have imagined. Ain't tech
nology grand?
So don't be shy, get yourself one.
Everybody's doin' it — even the cool
kids. Hut if you can't bring yourself
around to buying one, you can come by
and play with mine anytime. If any of
you out there happen to be walking
down the Row, just follow the joyous gig
gles of that furry, little monster, for
hours and hours of Tickle-Me fun.
Ages 1 1/2 and up only, please.

could beat the crap out of Big Chirpy
Duck (who lives down the hallway).
Elmo, a junior majoring in comparative
