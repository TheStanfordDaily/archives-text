## Genomic scientists pioneer DNA chip technology Biochips can monitor the expression of 100,000 genes simultaneously

Imagine all the genetic infor
mation needed to encode a
human being, all 100,000 genes
in the genome, arrayed on a chip
no bigger than a thumbnail.
Next imagine monitoring the
expression of these 100,000
genes simultaneously.
Although it may sound like
something from Michael Crich
ton's latest science fiction novel,
researchers in the Biochemistry
department at the Stanford Med
ical Center, in conjunction with
scientists at the local biotech
companies Affymetrix and Syn
teni, are working to make this
biochip a reality.
Advances in genomics, a new
area of biology that focuses on
mapping, sequencing and analyz
ing entire genomes, have necessi
tated the development of DNA
chip technology.
The entire human genome is
predicted to be sequenced by the
year 2003, and the genome of
baker's yeast was finished last
December. "Knowing the
sequence of an organism is just the
first step in understanding how its
genes actually function," said post
doctoral fellow Mark Schena.
Growth and development are

complex processes regulated by
messenger RNAs, transcripts that
contain information for making
proteins and the proteins them
selves. The blueprints for these
molecules are encoded by an
organism's genes. To better
understand genetic regulation,
sophisticated analytical tools like
DNA chips have been developed.
Currently, two different DNA
expression chips exist. The origi
nal biochip, developed in 1993,
was the brainchild of scientists at
Affymetrix. Called an oligonu
cleotide array, it is a glass chip
densely packed with oligonu
cleotides, or short regions of
DNA, which specifically recog
nize different genes.
The amount of space required
for one 25-base tag is minute: The
information occupies an area of
only 50 square micrometers This
means there is enough space for
65,000 different oligos on a 2
square centimeter chip.
The second chip, known as
the DNA microarray, was origi
nally developed in the Brown lab
at the Stanford Medical Center
as a method for parallel genotyp
ing en masse.
Like the oligonucleotide array,
the DNA microarray is made of
glass and displays thousands of

different nucleic acid sequences in
a highly compressed area. Instead
of using oligos, entire coding
regions of genes or cDNAs, are
printed on the DNA microarray.
Despite this basic difference,
both chips were designed to allow
researchers to quantify ihe
expression levels of many genes
sun ultaneously
A pooi of messenger KNA iso
lated from a biological sample
can be labeled with a fluorescent
dye and used to probe the chip
under very stringent conditions.
Messages present in the sample
will specifically bind to their cog
nate DNAs on the chip.
When the chip is exposed to a
specific wavelength of light, the
mRNA-cDNA complexes fluoresce
with an intensity that reflects the
abundance of the particular inRNA
in the sample population. The
more highly expressed the mRNA,
the brighter the spot on the chip.
Different mRNAs will be
expressed at higher levels under
some conditions relative to others.
As a result, mRNA pools harvest
ed from samples exposed to differ
ent environmental conditions can
be screened and compared. This
information can be used to deter
mine which factors increase the
expression of specific target genes

and which factors do not.
For instance, a scientist inter
ested m heat-inducible genes could
screen a DNA chip using samples
collected at low and high tempera
tures. By comparing the two
expression profiles, it would be
possible to find all the heat
inducible genes in a given genome.
These DNA microarrays are
produced using high-speed robot
ic printing and require very little
sample material. Only two micro
liters of sample, a volume smaller
than the head of a pin, are
required to manufacture multiple
DNA chips. Although the chips
are currently made of glass, any
solid surface to which DNA
adheres could be used.
"The technology behind biolog
ical chips is evolving rapidly,"
Schena said "Ultimately we don't
know what form the chip will
take When we started this pro
ject, we started with the idea
the genome DNA chip — and
worked backwards to achieve the
goal as rapidly as possible. The
result is a wedding of biological
needs to available technology."
Both chips were designed using
principles routinely employed in
the computer industry: parallel

rocessing, automation and mini
mal surface area. "We are using a
mathematical, engineering-like ap
proach in a biological context,"
Schena said.
In order to print DNA samples
rapidly and efficiently, a "microar
rayer," or computer-driven robot,
was designed and developed by bio
chemistry doctoral students Dari
Shalon and Joe Deßisi. The mi
croarrayer prints DNA sequences
onto glass slides at a rate of about
four DNA samples per second.
In addition to its efficiency, the
microarrayer is also cost-effec
tive. Gene sequences are readily
amplified using the Polymerase
Chain Reaction and printed onto
glass slides costing less than 50
cents each.
To date, DNA chips have been
used to monitor gene expression in
yeast, human and the flowering
plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
Asymetrix is currently designing a
chip which encodes the sequence of
the bacteria Escherichia coli. Chips
containing the nematode and fruit
fly genomes are expected in the fu
ture.
"Chips have a broad application
for research,"Schena said. "You can
ask questions about function under
a variety of conditions in a high

through-put fashion."
Doctoral student Dan Shoemak
er agrees, noting that "the main
valu«* of this approach Ls that it al
lows you to adopt a genomiccontext.
You can now ask a biological ques
tion and obtain information about
the responses of all genes in a given
organism."
Both Deßisi and Schena empha
size the potential use of DNA chips
in clinical settings.
"Gene chips have the potential to
revolutionize clinical diagnosis,"
Deßisi said. "With every human
gene on a chip, one could precisely
define the genes which are differen
tially expressed in people with vari
ous illnesses by sampling thousands
of patients and comparing them to
unaffected individuals. With this in
formation it may be possi ble to build
a database of signature expression
patterns for diagnostic use."
Although the research applica
tions of DNA chips are very promis
ing, Shoemaker and Schena caution
that they will not replace the more
traditional molecular and biochemi
cal approaches which focus on a sin
gle gene or group of genes.
"Our genomic approach Ls com
plementary with existing method
ologies, and allows researchers to
broadly characterize a genome and
identify interesting targets,"
Schena said. "But the detailed ge
netic analyses and biochemical ex
periments will still need to be per
formed."
