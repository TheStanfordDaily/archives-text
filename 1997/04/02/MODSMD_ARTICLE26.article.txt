Air bags cause serious eye injuries

A recent study in the Journal of Opthalmic Surgery
and Lasers reported that activated air bags, even in
minor car accidents, can cause serious eye injuries.
Based on the injuries seen during a 2-year period by
an opthalmology trauma team at UCI-A, the damage
ranged from eye socket bruises to ruptured eyeballs
resulting in blindness.
"The study highlights that air bags need some

changes in design. They can be lifesaving, but they can also be haz
ardous to the eyes," said Edward Manche, assistant professor of
opthalmology and director of cornea and refractive surgery at the
Stanford Medical Center. Manche was a visiting assistant professor at
UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute before coming to Stanford in July.
"In one case we detailed, a pregnant woman was driving about 20
miles an hour when she crashed into another car," Manche said.
"Her passengers had no air bags, and they were not injured. In this
case, the air bag was not lifesaving, yet it certainly caused injury: The
driver became legally blind in one eye."
In another case, the driver's rigid gas-permeable contact lenses
broke in her eyes. Surgery was needed to repair a detached retina in
her right eye and a torn retina in her left eye. Her injuries led to the
development of a cataract in the left eye and a hole in the macular
region of the right eye, which created a blind spot.
In contrast to the drivers in the study, all their passengers fared
well. Most of them did not have air bags. Those who did, Manche
speculates, probably escaped major injury because they sat farther
away from the air bag than the drivers did.

Smallest force measurement reported

Scientists from Stanford and IBM's Almuden
Research Center have successfully measured, for the
first time, "atto-newton" forces that are barely strong
enough to lift a protein molecule and far too weak to
budge a blood cell.
A newton is a unit of force equivalent to about one
fifth of a pound, while an atto-newton is about a bil
lionth of a billionth of a newton. To use an analogy, an

atto-newton is to a feather as a feather is to Hoover Dam.
"As far as we know, this is the first time that a mechanical sensor
has been demonstrated that is delicate enough to measure atto new
ton forces," said Asst. Mechanical Engineering Prof. Thomas Kenny.
The measurements were made with o microscopic cantilever
being developed for a new instrument called the Magnetic Resonance
Force Microscope.
The MFRM will be able to make 3-D, non-destructive, in-situ
atomic-resolution images of atoms, molecules, defects in solids and
binding sites on viruses. Researchers also hope that the MRFM will
be able to measure the spin of a single electron for the first time.
The ultrasensitive cantilevers measure 230 microns long, 5
microns wide and less than 600 angstroms thick I hat s 1,000 times
thinner than human hair and invisible to the naked eye
