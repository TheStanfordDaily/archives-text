# Therapeutic applications of bioenergetics

### Nina Chinosornvatana 
The emerging field of bioener
getics may hold the keys to new
therapeutic and diagnostic tools
that can revolutionize modern
medicine and help us understand
how "mystical" alternative
medicinal methods such as chi,
aura massage, crystal healing
and acupuncture work.
Bioelectromagnetics is the
study of how electromagnetic
fields, or EMFs, can affect bio
logical systems.
Electromagnetic energy is inti
mately involved in all parts of the
body's functioning, from direct
ing chemical interactions to the
action of muscles and brain
waves. It is also involved in the
development of embryos and the
function of cellular ion channels.
Jan Walleczek, research direc
tor of the Bioelectromagnetics
Laboratory at Stanford's Depart
ment of Radiation Oncology, has
studied bioelectromagnetics for
eight years. Formerly a microbiol
ogist and immunologist, he began
to study this complex interdisci
plinary subject after becoming
interested in the physics of elec
tromagnetic stimuli.
Walleczek said that close to 50
percent of an individual's energy
consumption is used to maintain
the electric potential across cell
membranes. This energy also plays

an important role in other organ
isms, as illustrated by the sensitiv
ities of rays, eels and sharks to
electricity within the ocean.
People in today's technological
ly advanced societies are constant
ly surrounded by energy fields.
Manipulation of these fields can
have either positive or adverse
effects on internal energy fields.
Until several years ago, the
study of bioenergy was focused
mainly on finding out whether
there were specific human
effects caused by electromagnet
ic fields. The recent controver
sies such as studies showing a
correlation between peoples'
proximity to phone lines and
increased cancer rates, along
with those of cellular phones and
brain tumors, have added to the
positive evidence.
Scientists believe, for
instance, that EMFs may alter
the function of a hormone called
melatonin in humans. This hor
mone normally suppresses the
growth of breast cancer cells.
Many researchers are trying
to find more therapeutic applica
tions with this science. Yet a
great deal about bioenergetics is
still unknown. "In my view, we
haven't even scratched the sur
face, ' Walleczek said.
The medical establishment
already uses some concepts of
bioelectromagnetics in several

well-known diagnostic and ther
apeutic tools.
Magnetic resonance imagery
uses electromagnetic waves
instead of more harmful X-rays
to detect abnormalities in the
body. Electrocardiography moni
tors the heart's electrical cur
rents to diagnose heart disease,
while artificial pacemakers use
electric impulses to invoke
heartbeats.
A less documented alternative
clinical use of electrical stimula
tion is transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, or TENS.
This therapy places electrodes
on either side of the skull to cre
ate a low current through the
skull. This electrical stimulation
seemingly reduces anxiety and
pain by blocking pain signal
transmissions and has been used
in drug-withdrawal treatment.
Electromagnetic fields have
also been used successfully to
repair bones.
Pulsed magnetic field thera
py, or PMFT, is particularly suc
cessful for those patients with
non-healing fractures. Pulsed
EMFs one-twentieth the
strength of a small refrigerator
magnet are generated around
these fractures. PMFT has a 75
to 85 percent success rate and is
significantly more successful
than surgery in later stages of
permanent disease.

The research team at Stan
ford studies the effects of EMFs
on biological systems by placing
a small vial containing enzymes
or other biological substances
within a magnet.
They have found EMF effects
to be extremely nonlinear. Not
only does their efficacy depend
on intensity and frequency, it
also depends on the state of the
biological system.
Walleczek has found that
p]MFs can change the concentra
tion of calcium ions within a cell.
EMFs raise the influx of these
ions into cells which are in a
resting state. Wallaczek also the
orizes that EMFs may possibly
alter the processes of nerve cell
communication, muscle contrac
tions, hormone secretion and the
transcription of genes.
As more is learned about bioen
ergy, explanations may turn up
for New Age therapies like Chi
nese medicines, pyramid energy
healing and psychic healing.
Throughout history, scien
tists from Hippocrates to New
ton have believed in the exis
tence of a spirit which influences
the human hody. Researchers
today hope these "energies," or
possibly EMFs, can be used and
developed into new therapies
that can modulate hormone lev
els and heart arrhythmias and
regenerate nerves.
