QWhy do wintergreen Life
-savers spark in the dark:

A .When I was young, naive
• and knew little about sci
ence — a science larva if you will
— one of my 112 riends told me about
how wintergreen Lifesavers
sparked in the dark when you
chewed them
I didn't believe him; this was
the same kid who told me that
putting ketchup in my shoes
would make me run taster, and I
found out that wasn't true the
hard way
Anyway, I was still a sucker
back then, so I went home and
decided to try it out To my
amazement, it really worked, and
I went through about two rolls of
wintergreen Lifesavers until I

started to feel sick
The lesson here is, it you do
try this one at home, try to con
trol yourself before you pass out
on the floor in a confectionery
heap The other lesson i» never
listen to the spiky-haired kid
with the bad ideas
Now that I've grown up, sort
of, I feel I'm in a position to stop
other people from making the
same mistake by explaining how
the sparking really occurs Hope
fully, through this and other
educational articles like Why
is my dog foaming at the
mouth''" and "What, this glow
ing stuff in my bac kvard? — I II
be able to save lives
The sparks given off by the

Lifesavers are caused by an
effV'ct called triboluminescence
Ti iboluininesconco is the cre
ation of light by friction. This
was fir it studied by Sir Francis
fjacon «bout 400 vears ago, even
before 'ho wintergreen Litesaver
w;i: in\< nted
It turns out that lot , of things
can glow when friction is applied.
II vou look closely, qua kly strip
ping a roll of tape can cause a
faint blue glow to appear
It ;ilso turns out that sugar is
triboluminescent When you
crush sugar crystals, you produce
fragments that are positively and
negatively charged This separa
tion of charge can become great
enough to create small sparks to

jump through the air. I his is like
how lightning occurs between the
ground and the clouds, except on
a much, much smaller scale
you're not going to be able to re
animate dead flesh by stomping
011 a few sugar packets.
Normally, when you crush
sugar, these small sparks excite
nitrogen molecules in the air,
which subsequently emit mostly
ultraviolet light. We can see only a
small amount of this light, emit
ted as a faint bluish glow. Most
candies should be capable of this,
though it is really hard to see.
Hut if you've gone off and tried
the wintergreen Lifesaver experi
ment, you'll notice that the Life
savers produce a pretty bright

flash ot light. Obviously, there is
something special about the win
tergreen Lifesavers which makes
them so much brighter.
That special something is
methyl salicylate, the? ingredient
which gives it the wintergreen fla
vor. Methyl salicylate, it turns
out, can absorb the ultraviolet
light given off by the nitrogen and
re-emit it as visible light. This is
what makes the wintergreen Life
savers so much cooler 'pun totally

Well, that's the story of the
Lifesavers. Don't overdose on
them, and watch out for the
spiky-haired kid with the winter
green tape
