# Environmental program founder dies
## 
### Scott Peterson 
Civil Engineering Prof. Emeritus Rolf
Eliassen, founder of Stanford's environmental
engineering program, died on March 14. He was
86.
When Eliassen came to Stanford from MIT
in 1961, he already had a successful 25-year ca
reer as a civil and sanitary engineer. Here he cre
ated what would become one of the nation's best
environmental engineering programs, part of
which was the popular undergraduate engineer
ing course, Civil Engineering 170: "Man and His
Environment" that he created.
"His presence here made an awesome differ
ence," said Civil Engineering Department Chair
Jeffrey Koseff. "He was truly one of the steeples
of excellence in the mold of (former provost|
Frederick Terman."
Civil Engineering Prof. Perry McCarty, who
was recruited from MIT by Eliassen, said
Eliassen was drawn to Stanford because the Uni
versity offered the possibility to work across dis
ciplines. Eliassen envisioned that it would be
necessary to combine expertise from many fields

to combat problems affecting the quality of land,
water and the environment, McCarty said.
Eliassen designed the "Man and His Envi
ronment" course to reflect this interdisciplinary
vision, and despite an 8 a.m. meeting time, the
course attracted so many students each year
that it was sometimes held in Memorial Audito
rium.
"It was the first course in the nation that
took an integrated approach to environmental
problems: air pollution, water pollution and
solid waste management," said Civil Engineer
ing Department Assoc. Chair Gil Masters. "It
was such a new approach; it was written up in
journals. On Earth Day in 1970, this course was
already there, running full steam ahead for stu
dents who wanted to find out something about
the environment."
On retiring, Eliassen handed over teaching of
the course to Masters, and it continues under
the name "Environmental Science and Technol

Eliassen was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Feb
ruary 22,1911. He received his bachelor's, mas
ter's and doctorate in civil and sanitary engi

neering in 1935 at MIT. His early career includ
ed employment in engineering firms, the Illinois
Institute of Technology and New York Univer
sity.
Eliassen returned to MIT as a professor of
sanitary engineering in 1949, overseeing re
search and teaching on treatment of water,
sewage and industrial wastes. The focus of his
research there — incorporating high-level ra
dioactive wastes into stable glasses — has just
recently been applied, 40 years later, in Depart
ment of Energy nuclear sites, McCarty said.
In addition to his position at Stanford,
Eliassen was adviser to the White House Office
on Science and Technology Polity from 1961 to
1973. His expertise in treating waste water and
disposing solid and nuclear wastes gained him a
place on the General Advisory Committee to the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He was also a
consultant to the U.S. Public Health Service,
the Departments of Commerce, Defense and the
Interior and California's Department of Water
Resources.
He is survived by his wife, Mary, his sons,
Thomas and James, and five grandchildren.
