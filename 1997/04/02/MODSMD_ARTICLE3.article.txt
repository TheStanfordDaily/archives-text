# ASSU sends judicial bill to committee
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
After much heated debate last
night, the ASSU Senate delayed
voting on a bill that would place
the reformed Stanford Judicial
Charter on the ballot for the
ASSU General Election. In order
to discuss it further, the bill was
sent to a senate subcommittee.
The new charter, composed by
the Committee of 15, governs pro
cedures for raising and reviewing
charges of the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard viola
tions.
The charter, hailed by ASSU
President Bill Shen as "the most
important thing students have
been asked to vote on in years,"
would make significant changes
to the current 30 year-old proce
dures.
The proposed changes would
have a committee consisting of
four students and two adminis
trators decide whether a student
was "guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt" of an Honor Code or Fun
damental Standard violation.

This proposal differs markedly
from the current system in which
one administrator decides an in
dividual's guilt and another de
termines the punishment.
"The system we have now is
absolutely Byzantine as there is
no student voice and no due
process. It is a system that
doesn't serve the needs of stu
dents, faculty or administrators
very well," said Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback, who chaired the
Committee of 15.
Shen praised the committee's
work, noting that "he had never
been this impressed with a com
mittee and its ability to seek out
(the advice of) a wide range of peo
ple." He added that the new bill
"offers a huge opportunity to
move away from a system that is
dangerous to students."
In spite of the new bill's ability
to prevent the arbitrariness and
contradictions inherent in the
present system, the changes have
raised new questions among both
senators and alumni as to
