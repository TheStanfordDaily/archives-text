# ASSU sends judicial bill to committee
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
After much heated debate last
night, the ASSU Senate delayed
voting on a bill that would place
the reformed Stanford Judicial
Charter on the ballot for the
ASSU General Election. In order
to discuss it further, the bill was
sent to a senate subcommittee.
The new charter, composed by
the Committee of 15, governs pro
cedures for raising and reviewing
charges of the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard viola
tions.
The charter, hailed by ASSU
President Bill Shen as "the most
important thing students have
been asked to vote on in years,"
would make significant changes
to the current 30 year-old proce
dures.
The proposed changes would
have a committee consisting of
four students and two adminis
trators decide whether a student
was "guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt" of an Honor Code or Fun
damental Standard violation.

This proposal differs markedly
from the current system in which
one administrator decides an in
dividual's guilt and another de
termines the punishment.
"The system we have now is
absolutely Byzantine as there is
no student voice and no due
process. It is a system that
doesn't serve the needs of stu
dents, faculty or administrators
very well," said Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback, who chaired the
Committee of 15.
Shen praised the committee's
work, noting that "he had never
been this impressed with a com
mittee and its ability to seek out
(the advice of) a wide range of peo
ple." He added that the new bill
"offers a huge opportunity to
move away from a system that is
dangerous to students."
In spite of the new bill's ability
to prevent the arbitrariness and
contradictions inherent in the
present system, the changes have
raised new questions among both
senators and alumni as to


Shen
whether the bill adequately pro
tects students' rights.
Stanford alumnus and UC-
Berkeley Prof. Yale Braunstein
addressed the senate suggesting
that the new charter "forces the
accused to have a hearing, denies
the person under fire the chance
to be cross examined and provides
no provision for random selection
of jury members."
Some senators supported
Braunstein's concerns, noting dis
pleasure with the flexibility of the
new judicial process' framework
and a requirement posed by the
ASSU Constitution that potential
ly conflicts with the committee's
bill concerning the privacy of the
hearings.
Braunstein and several sena

tors were concerned about the
process used by the Committee of
15. In contrast to Shen, they ex
pressed frustration with the com
mittee's lack of responsiveness to
their concerns raised last fall
when the committee gave its pre
liminary report.
Zoback countered criticisms by
reminding the senate of the in
credible protection granted by the
requirement to have proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson,
in spite of some reservations, "The
new system is not the best system,
but it is a big improvement. The
one thing that I do like is that it
provides an ongoing structure for
procedural improvement."
Asked to respond to the ASSU
decision to send the charter to a
subcommittee, Zoback replied, "I
think it is basically fine. People
need to assure themselves that
the charter is fair to everyone. As

long as we can maintain the mo
mentum and get a student vote, it
is fine."
He added, however, that de
spite the long debate, he felt "few
substantive issues had been
raised."
Braunstein said that last
night's debate "highlighted all the
problems in the [Committee of
15's| process." Braunstein reiter
ated that "every student would be
better off [under the old system)
than under the new proposal."
Nonetheless, he conceded that a
revised proposal could be better
than both.
The senate is expected to vote
on the proposal next week. If it is
approved by the senate, it will be
put on the ballot for approval in
the elections later this month. Be
fore going into effect, the bill must
also be approved by the Faculty
Senate and University President
Gerhard Casper.
