## Minus Goldstein, men trounce Waves 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
With Stanford's All-American and llth-ranked
Paul Goldstein still sidelined by a stress fracture, it
looked like No. 9 Pepperdine might have a chance to
upset the No. 7 Cardinal.
But with its lone senior and young freshman talent
persevering in tight matches, the Stanford men's ten
nis team cruised past the Waves 5-2.
On an unusually blustery day at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal fell behind Pepperdine
at the beginning, dropping two of the three doubles
matches and losing the doubles point.
Playing No. 1 for the Card in doubles was the broth
er-brother freshman combination of Bob and Mike
Bryan, currently ranked 16th in the nation. They fell
to Pepperdine's Simon Aspelin and Brad Sceney 8-4.
"Bob and I are having a rough year in doubles,"
Mike Bryan said. "But we just need to get our confi
dence back, and then we will be hard as nails."
In other doubles action, freshman Geoff Abrams
and senior Grant Elliott easily dispatched Pepper
dine's Troy Budgen and Anthony Ross at the No. 2
position 8-3. The third match saw sophomore Ryan
Wolters and junior Misha Palecek fall to the Waves'
Michael Jessup and Chris Hill 8-4.
Easy victories in singles for Bob Bryan and Abrams
put Stanford ahead 2-1. Bryan cruised past Hill 6-1, 6-
0, while Abrams easily disposed of Budgen 6-0,6-1. Yet
Stanford had not clinched the match, as four of the six
singles matches remained tight battles.
At the No. 1 position, Ail-American Wolters turned
in the next victory for the Card when he beat Aspelin
6-1, 7-5.
Meanwhile, at the No. 6 position, junior Charles
Hoeveler fought a hard battle but lost in a close match
in the second set to Waves' Ross 6-2, 6-3.
With the score at 3-2 in Stanford's favor, the Card
looked to No. 3 singles for Mike Bryan and No. 5 Elliott
to clinch the match.

Freshman Geoff Abrams runs down a ball at the net in a home meet against Oregon earlier this season.
Elliott, the sole senior on the
Cardinal squad, displayed his tal
ent and veteran leadership, coming
from behind in the second set to
pull it out in the tie-breaker, beat
ing Jessup 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).
Jessup, who had been playing at
the No. 2 or No. 3 singles position
for Pepperdine, played at the No. 5
position yesterday against Klliott.
Yet the senior entered the match
confident.
With his teammates watching
on, Elliott went ahead 7-6 in the
tie-breaker and then took the
match when Jessup dumped a
backhand into the net.
"It was a close match," Elliott
said. "I knew I could break his
serve in the second set; it just took
a while. He had his chances, too.
He has beaten me the last couple of
times we had played, which was in
the juniors. We had not played
each other in four years. This was a

great win for me."
Less than a minute later, Mike
Bryan finished off Sceney 2-6, 6-4,
6-4 to end the meet.
"I had to fight hard, and it was a
tough match under the circum
stances," Bryan said. "I was tenta
tive in the first set with the wind
and all, but I came back.
The win boosts Stanford's
record to an impressive 15-1, and
Pepperdine falls to 17-5.
The key to the Card's success,
as it breezed by a top-ranked team
with a key players sitting out?
"The senior leadership," Mike
Bryan said.
Elliott, on the other hand,
defers to the youngsters.
"The freshman are studs," he
said.
Whatever the successful formu
la, Stanford looks to a tough road
trip this weekend when it travels
down south to take on UCLA and
USC Friday and Saturday, respec
tively. The Cardinal returns to the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium
Tuesday to take on 15th-ranked
Illinois.
