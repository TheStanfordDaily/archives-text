## Minus Goldstein, men trounce Waves 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
With Stanford's All-American and llth-ranked
Paul Goldstein still sidelined by a stress fracture, it
looked like No. 9 Pepperdine might have a chance to
upset the No. 7 Cardinal.
But with its lone senior and young freshman talent
persevering in tight matches, the Stanford men's ten
nis team cruised past the Waves 5-2.
On an unusually blustery day at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal fell behind Pepperdine
at the beginning, dropping two of the three doubles
matches and losing the doubles point.
Playing No. 1 for the Card in doubles was the broth
er-brother freshman combination of Bob and Mike
Bryan, currently ranked 16th in the nation. They fell
to Pepperdine's Simon Aspelin and Brad Sceney 8-4.
"Bob and I are having a rough year in doubles,"
Mike Bryan said. "But we just need to get our confi
dence back, and then we will be hard as nails."
In other doubles action, freshman Geoff Abrams
and senior Grant Elliott easily dispatched Pepper
dine's Troy Budgen and Anthony Ross at the No. 2
position 8-3. The third match saw sophomore Ryan
Wolters and junior Misha Palecek fall to the Waves'
Michael Jessup and Chris Hill 8-4.
Easy victories in singles for Bob Bryan and Abrams
put Stanford ahead 2-1. Bryan cruised past Hill 6-1, 6-
0, while Abrams easily disposed of Budgen 6-0,6-1. Yet
Stanford had not clinched the match, as four of the six
singles matches remained tight battles.
At the No. 1 position, Ail-American Wolters turned
in the next victory for the Card when he beat Aspelin
6-1, 7-5.
Meanwhile, at the No. 6 position, junior Charles
Hoeveler fought a hard battle but lost in a close match
in the second set to Waves' Ross 6-2, 6-3.
With the score at 3-2 in Stanford's favor, the Card
looked to No. 3 singles for Mike Bryan and No. 5 Elliott
to clinch the match.
