# Poor final round leaves Stanford in 10th
## Golfers struggle at The Duck 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
The Stanford golf team prac
ticed hard every day over spring
break, hoping to increase its scor
ing depth and put a mediocre per
formance at Oregon on March 10
and 11 behind it. Finishing 10th in
team standings and battling
adverse weather conditions and a
difficult 'field, the meet proved to
be a disappointment.
"We just didn't have a good
tournament," said freshman
Dusty Brett.
Senior Conrad Ray, sophomore
Joel Kribel, senior Eri Crum,
freshman Michael Wiemer, sopho
more Scott Wang and Brett trav
eled to the Eugene Country Club
to play in The Duck. Junior Jake
Poe also played as an independent.
This was the squad's last winter
quarter tournament and an impor
tant determinant in its current
lOth-place regional ranking.
Battling harsh wind and rain,
the team started off badly, posting
a team score of 316 for the first day
and standing ninth out of 14

squads. Ray had the best individu
al score of 76 to tie for 13th. The
second round of the day was can
celed due to continuing heavy rain.
At this point, Washington, Oregon
and Oregon State led the team
competition.
The second day proved much
better for the Card, which posted a
team score of 299 in the final
round to finish 10th. Ray and Kri
bel scored 72 and 71, respectively,
to finish with individual scores of
148 and tie for sixth place. Brett
(160), Wiemer (162), Wang (163)
and Crum (164) followed. Poe fin
ished with a 168.
Had the squad performed the
first day as it did the second, it
would have finished in third place.
"It wasn't the conditions we
expected, and we certainly don't
deal with rain and wind as often as
the teams from the Northwest,"
Brett said. "The course was nice
and Pac-lOs will also be there, but
I felt like we were battling the con
ditions more than the course."
The Washington and Oregon
teams were both in the top three.
"Obviously it's difficult for

teams who don't usually play in
the rain and wind to adapt to these
conditions," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "A team which plays
with wind or rain often can adapt
to no wind or no rain, but it's very
difficult for a team to adapt to
these conditions when they don't
usually play in them."
However, everyone played the
same course.
"We went up hoping to do bet
ter, but everyone had to deal with
the weather," Wiemer said. "I
know this team has it within itself
to do well, but we need to work on
our scoring depth. Conrad and Joel
are always on par, and Dusty's
done a great job bringing in some
good scores, too. The rest of us
need to step it up and get the
fourth and fifth guys to bring in
some 75s for the team."
This change will not happen
overnight.
"The depth problem is not
something we can overcome quick
ly," Goodwin said, "if we expect to
keep it overcome.
