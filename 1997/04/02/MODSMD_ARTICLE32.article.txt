Redshirt sophomore forward Kristin Folkl made the
difference as Stanford reached its third consecutive Final
Four. The 6-foot-2 star set a new Final Four record for
shots made in a game without a miss when she huried 8-
of-8 attempts against Old Dominion Friday. For the tour
nament, Folkl, who played only the final six weeks of the
season, made 69 percent (24-of-35) of her Field-goal
attempts, snared 39 rebounds and blocked three shots.
Her scoring output increased each game in the tourney
and she recorded two double-doubles, securing all-region
al honors for the second time in her career.

Over the three games of his final NCAA tourney, senior
point guard Brevin Knight displayed all the remarkable skill
and leadership that the Cardinal faithful have come to
expect from the Ail-American. Averaging 21.3 points and 8.0
assists for the tournament, Knight steered Stanford out of
round one and past the heavily favored three seed, Wake
Forest, to take the Card to its first Sweet 16. Facing No. 2
Utah, Knight was unstoppable, showcasing his trademark
quickness and almost singlehandedly keeping pace with the
Utes despite an early fourth foul. His clutch three with seven
seconds left in regulation sent the game into overtime.
