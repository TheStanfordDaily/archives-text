# Sluggers snowed out
## Card widens Six-Pac lead 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
The Cardinal baseball team used the break to
focus on its work and was able to sweep California
and take two of three from Arizona last weekend
before having to cancel a Monday game at Nevada on
account of snow.
"There were flurries on the field as we started to
play, so we called it off," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Getting 'snowed out' was a first for me."
Junior second baseman Joe Kilburg, who hails
from Bay Village, Ohio, thought that the words
"snowed out" didn't truly describe the situation.
"That wasn't snow," Kilburg said. "That was
nothing. Back home, we know what snow really is."
Despite the problems with Mother Nature, the
Card was able to eryoy the rest of spring break and
finish with five wins in six games and a comfortable
lead in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
The No. 4 Cardinal (23-8, 10-2 Six-Pac) opened
the break with a three-game series against the rival
Golden Bears and handed them three defeats.
"Playing Cal is always a big game," Kilburg said.
"But in this league, every game is a big game. You
can never let up."
The Cardinal was in danger of letting up in the
first game of the series, as Cal jumped out quickly
with five runs in the first five innings. After junior
shortstop Jay Pecci's two-run homer in the fifth put
them within three, Stanford was only able to squeak
to within one at 5-4 by the ninth inning.
However, with two outs and Pecci on first in the
bottom of the last frame, freshman right fielder
Edmund Muth's fly to left was
misjudged by Cal's Preston Sharp
and fell for a double to tie the
score. Sophomore Jody Gerut then
shot a liner off the right-field
fence, sending Muth home to
pounce on the plate as the game
winning run.
The Cardinal then traveled to
Evans Diamond at Berkeley and
hardly exerted itself, dealing the
Golden Bears a crushing blow with
a 20-.5 defeat.
In the lopsided victory, every
Stanford starting player pounded
at least one hit, helping the team
careen through five Cal pitchers.

Stanford's total of 24 hits set a new
season high. Muth (4-for-6, five
RBI), Gerut (3-for-4, three RBI),
senior Chris Clark (3-for-3), and
Pecci (3-for-6, two RBI) led the
Cardinal in the batters' box.
The last game of the series fell
on Marquess' 50th birthday. By
the end of the day, the team had
given its coach another victory,
completing a sweep of a belea
guered Golden Bear squad with a
16-4 win at Sunken Diamond.
The team scored in seven
straight innings and led 11-0
before Cal was able to eke out a
run against sophomore starter
Brent Hoard, who allowed just
four hits and three runs in five
innings of work.
Stanford's offensive prowess in
the series against Cal is indicative

of a season-long trend that is a
surprise to Marquess.
"The key to our hitting is a lot
of different players have batted
well," he said. "We haven't just
been carried by one or two players.
It's really been a team effort."
Stanford's offensive locomotive
kept up enough steam to plow into
its next three-game series against
the Arizona Wildcats. Although
the Cardinal guns couldn't match
the lofty point totals of the Cal
series, the team was able to jump
from the starting line to a 10-3 vic
tory in game one.
Junior starter Kyle Peterson
turned in a seven-inning, eight
strikeout performance, allowing
only three earned runs for the win.
Peterson's 279 career strikeouts
puts him fifth all-time in Cardinal

history.
The Card lost its only game of
the trip the next day, as Wildcat
southpaw James Johnson pitched
eight innings and set down nine
Stanford batters on strikes, lead
ing Arizona to an 11-7 win.
But Stanford was able to come
back to win the rubber match of
the series. With Wildcat runners at
second and third and Stanford
holding on tightly to a meager 3-2
lead in the sixth inning, sopho
more Jeff Austin took over for
Hoard and struck out the next two
Arizona batters to escape the jam.
He pitched the next three innings
of scoreless ball to get the save.
Junior Jon Schaeffer's insur
ance home run in the eighth made
the final score 4-2.
The team's impressive spring

break performance netted five con
ference wins and a comfortable
two-game Six-Pac lead over USC
and UCLA. But Marquess isn't
ready to label the team a sure bet
in the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
"We're in good shape now; we
look really good," Marquess said.
"But we have some tough games
coming up against USC and UCLA.
And we haven't even played UCLA
yet, so we don't know how we
match up against them."
Even so, Kilburg has confidence
in the team and it's chemistry.
"We have the perfect mix of
older and younger guys," he said.
"Older guys to provide the guid
ance and veteran attitude and
younger guys who just go out and
play as hard as they can."
