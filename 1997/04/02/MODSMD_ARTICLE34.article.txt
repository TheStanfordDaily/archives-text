The Stanford softball team (10-16-1) had a
great spring break, ending up with a winning
record in its eight games against some strong
opponents. The Cardinal had five wins, one tie
and only two losses against second-ranked
UCLA, llth-ranked Long Beach State, Loyola
Marymount and Tennessee.
The most pivotal series was against the high
powered Bruins. UCLA, riding a 21-game win
streak, was looking to maintain its position as a
powerhouse by sweeping the Cardinal on its
home field. Stanford had different intentions,
however, breaking out to an early five-run lead
in game one. Going into the bottom of the sev
enth, Stanford held the lead 5-1, but a UCLA
rally tied it at 5-5. Crouch was relieved by
Blevins who pitched the remainder of the game.
In the top of the 10th, Stanford was able to
score off a double by Yablonski, which brought in
pinch runner Lauren Gellman. Blevins held the
Bruins in the bottom of the 10th, and the Cardi
nal came away with a huge 6-5 win.
In game two the Cardinal lost 4-0. Bruins
pitcher Courtney Dale pitched seven strong
innings that limited Stanford to two hits. The
split against UCLA at its own field was a big
boost for Stanford and confirmation that it can

beat top-five teams.
The Cardinal started off its vacation series
against Tennessee. The Lady Vols (25-9) have
been considered one of the better teams in the
country all season long and were riding an eight
game win streak prior to their contest against
Stanford.
The Card wanted to establish that it was one
of the best teams in the Pacific 10 Conference
and in the country with a strong showing during
break. That position was quickly asserted by the
Cardinal in game one, with Stanford winning 4-
1. The Cardinal had a well-balanced attack in the
game, with a solid all-around offensive perfor
mance and a good game by sophomore ace Marcy
Crouch.
Freshman catcher Kellie Wiginton continued
her season-long strong hitting, going 2-for-4 in
the game and driving in a run. Sophomore desig
nated hitter Shane Anderson made the most of
her batting appearances, driving in two runs on
her one hit. Stanford scored early with one run
in the second and two runs in the third and from
there never looked back. It was a good win for
the Cardinal, setting the tone for the rest of its
games.
Stanford allowed some of its fans to bring out
the broom, as it won game two in powerful fash-
