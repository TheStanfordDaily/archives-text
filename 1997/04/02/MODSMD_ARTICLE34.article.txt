# Softball upsets No.2 UCLA
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team (10-16-1) had a
great spring break, ending up with a winning
record in its eight games against some strong
opponents. The Cardinal had five wins, one tie
and only two losses against second-ranked
UCLA, llth-ranked Long Beach State, Loyola
Marymount and Tennessee.
The most pivotal series was against the high
powered Bruins. UCLA, riding a 21-game win
streak, was looking to maintain its position as a
powerhouse by sweeping the Cardinal on its
home field. Stanford had different intentions,
however, breaking out to an early five-run lead
in game one. Going into the bottom of the sev
enth, Stanford held the lead 5-1, but a UCLA
rally tied it at 5-5. Crouch was relieved by
Blevins who pitched the remainder of the game.
In the top of the 10th, Stanford was able to
score off a double by Yablonski, which brought in
pinch runner Lauren Gellman. Blevins held the
Bruins in the bottom of the 10th, and the Cardi
nal came away with a huge 6-5 win.
In game two the Cardinal lost 4-0. Bruins
pitcher Courtney Dale pitched seven strong
innings that limited Stanford to two hits. The
split against UCLA at its own field was a big
boost for Stanford and confirmation that it can

beat top-five teams.
The Cardinal started off its vacation series
against Tennessee. The Lady Vols (25-9) have
been considered one of the better teams in the
country all season long and were riding an eight
game win streak prior to their contest against
Stanford.
The Card wanted to establish that it was one
of the best teams in the Pacific 10 Conference
and in the country with a strong showing during
break. That position was quickly asserted by the
Cardinal in game one, with Stanford winning 4-
1. The Cardinal had a well-balanced attack in the
game, with a solid all-around offensive perfor
mance and a good game by sophomore ace Marcy
Crouch.
Freshman catcher Kellie Wiginton continued
her season-long strong hitting, going 2-for-4 in
the game and driving in a run. Sophomore desig
nated hitter Shane Anderson made the most of
her batting appearances, driving in two runs on
her one hit. Stanford scored early with one run
in the second and two runs in the third and from
there never looked back. It was a good win for
the Cardinal, setting the tone for the rest of its
games.
Stanford allowed some of its fans to bring out
the broom, as it won game two in powerful fash-
ion 8-0. It was the worst loss of
the season for the Vols, with the
run rule stopping the game in
the fifth inning.
The squad had one of its best
offensive performances of the
season, highlighted by a three
run home run by Crouch. Sopho
more shortstop Michelle Schnei
der also had a solid game at the
plate, going 2-for-2 and driving
in two runs. Stanford hit well
collectively, having nine hits dis
persed among six players. Sopho

more pitcher Becky Blevins had a
strong outing that included four
strikeouts and only one walk.
Stanford's next series against
Long Beach State proved to be
quite a thriller. Game one ended
after 13 innings, with the Cardi
nal notching a 1-0 victory. In the
long opener, both teams
remained scoreless until the
13th due to the brilliant pitching
performances of Stanford pitcher
Crouch and 49ers pitcher
Tammy Dietrich. In the top of
the 13th, the Card started off
with a single by sophomore cen
ter fielder Kelly Yablonski, who
was moved to second by senior
third baseman Amanda Rente

ria's sacrifice. A passed ball
allowed Yablonski to move to
third, and Wiginton's single
brought Yablonski home for the
game-winning run.
In game two, Long Beach
State looked ready to hand Stan
ford a close loss, leading 1-0 all
the way up to the sixth inning,
but the team rallied for two runs
in the sixth. Wiginton and
Schneider singled to lead off the
inning, and then moved to sec
ond and third on Crouch's sacri
fice fly. A sharp grounder that
turned into a single by sopho
more left fielder Michelle Acosta
brought in the two baserunners
and gave the Cardinal the lead

heading into the bottom of the
sixth.
The 49ers were able to score
one run in the sixth to tie the
game. As darkness approached,
Long Beach loaded the bases in
the seventh. But with two outs,
Blevins was able to strand the
opposing baserunners by forcing
a 49er to ground out to end the
inning. The game ended in a tie,
being called due to darkness.
The final series for the Cardi
nal against Loyola Marymount
also resulted in a split. Although
the Lions are a high-caliber
team, they are not in the same
league as UCLA.
"It's always hard to play well

following a big game," Wiginton
said. "We were intense and
played hard, but things fell a lit
tle short in game one. We defi
nitely feel we should have beaten
Loyola both games, and we're
not going to let a loss like that
happen again."
In game one, the Cardinal
took a three-run lead into the
bottom of the fifth, but Loyola
Marymount was able to score
four runs by the seventh and
eventually pull off the win 4-3.
In game two, the Cardinal
started off strong, scoring four
runs in the first inning. Wiginton
and Schneider drove in a run
apiece, and Crouch doubled in

two more runs in the first
inning. That was all Crouch
needed to collect the win as she
went the distance, allowing only
five hits and two runs in seven
innings. It was another well-bal
anced performance for the
squad, which perhaps was the
exclamation point on a spring
break series that signified the
end of the Cardinal's inconsis
tency at the plate.
"The team performed very
strong both offensively and
defensively in all the games dur
ing break," Wiginton said. "It
was really encouraging to see
things come together against big
teams."
