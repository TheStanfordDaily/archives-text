Then-N0.3 California proved
to be the only thorn in the Stan
ford women's water polo team's
side over the break, beating the
second-ranked Cardinal twice in
as many tries. Despite these two
losses, the squad had its way
with the other eight teams it
faced.
The Cardinal's first blowout
was a 15-5 win at Pacific in
Stockton March 15, but enjoy
ment over the win was short
lived as the Cardinal's first
encounter with Cal came four
days later. The team led the
Golden Bears early but fell 13-
12 with three seconds left in
overtime.
Stanford then traveled to
Honolulu and had a much easier
time with most of its opponents
in the Hawaii Wahine Water
Polo Invitational as it mopped
up the competition. The Cardi
nal met UC-Santa Cruz two
times in the tournament and
trounced the Banana Slugs 18 2
and 26-0.
The Cardinal also faced Whit
tier College twice and destroyed
the Poets 28-2 and 26-4. The
last object of Cardinal wrath was
host Hawaii, whom Stanford
beat 23-1 and 18-3. The Cardi
nal's only loss of the tourna
ment was to Cal 10-5.
Because Cal left the tourna
ment early to return in time for
classes, the Cardinal faced
Hawaii in the finals and defeat
ed the Rainbow Wahine soundly
16-4.
Despite all the victories in

Hawaii, it whs the loss at the
packed Berkeley pool March 19
that had the most resonance. At
Cal, the crowd did not initially
seem to have an effect on the
Cardinal, and Stanford came out
on fire. By the middle of the
third quarter Stanford had
taken control of the game and
was up 9-4.
"We played the hest first half
of women's water polo I have
ever seen," said head coach Ben
Quittner.
But after the first half the
moment swung, and the Bears
scored six unanswered goals in a
period of six minutes to take the
lead 10-9. The Cardinal went
down fighting as freshman Suze
Gardner scored with 2 minutes,
29 seconds left to tie the game at
11 apiece, sending the game into
overtime.
The Golden Bears scored first
in overtime, hut Gardner once
again evened the game by scor
ing with 1:09 left in the first
overtime. With the game tied at
12-12 and 14 seconds remaining,
the Cardinal had the ball and a
final scoring opportunity. Then,
because of an offensive foul,
Stanford turned the ball over.
Cal took advantage of this mis
take and found the back of the
net with three ticks left to go on
top for good 13-12.
"We played a really good
game, but we had a few lapses
that lost the game for us. But
overall, we played really well,"
Gardner said.
The Cardinal had a second
chance at Cal in Hawaii, but
