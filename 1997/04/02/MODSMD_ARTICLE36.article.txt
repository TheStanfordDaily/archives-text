# Rugby dominated by Canadians
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
After a three-week respite
from practice due to Dead
Week, finals and spring break,
the men and women's rugby
teams got a rude awakening
during their recent tour of
Canada.
The men dropped their
match to the University of Vic
toria 50-7 Friday and were
crushed by British Columbia
55-14 Monday.
Without regular practice the
men were off-pace and unable
to function smoothly as a unit,
said head coach Franck
Boivert.
"The men feel like they are
in a slump," Boivert said.
"They will get out of this slump
and go back to training hard
and getting their pace back.
They have to get their team
work together. You cannot get
that in rugby unless you prac
tice regularly and since we did
not practice for three weeks . . .
the team is kind of lost on the
field."
The men will have three
weeks to regain their compo
sure for the regional finals on
April 19 and 20. Failing to get
back into its routine could
mean an early exit from cham

pionship contention for the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal.
Stanford's only loss to an
American school has come
against top-ranked California,
so the squad has proven it has
more than enough to fight into
the final rounds of the postsea
son.
The women were also hand
ed two losses over the trip, a 45-
5 drubbing by Victoria and a
36-7 loss against British
Columbia Friday and Monday,
respectively.
But despite dropping both
games by significant margins,
Boivert is more optimistic
about the level of the women's
performance.
"For the women the tour was
much more positive [than for
the men] because they played
with a lot of intensity," Boivert
said. "Even though they were
outmatched, they performed
quite well. Since the quality of
the opposition is going to be
less in regional playoffs, I think
that if they concentrate on a
couple of things like avoiding
turnovers they will perform
very well.
"Even though they lost, the
outcome of the tour allows
them to be much more opti
mistic than the men."
The women will continue to

build up that intensity as they
prepare to host the regional
playoffs on April 12 and 13.
Throughout the season, they
have been able to overcome
their smaller size by constantly
increasing their tempo and
becoming increasingly success
ful in dictating the pace of the
game, both of which should

prove vital if the squad is to
contend.
As long as the women can
keep opponents on their heels
and guessing what comes next,
they should be able to advance.
But if they slow down the pace
of the game, other schools will
most likely be able to overpow
er them.
