# Insurance at Cowell to change
## Cardinal Care to offer Blue Cross coverage 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Substantial changes in the health insurance plan
that the University provides for students are sched
uled to go into effect next year, with the aim of lower
ing students' medical costs and increasing their op
tions for care.
Thanks in large part to a decision to buy insurance
from Blue Cross of California, students will he cov
ered for care from any provider in Blue Cross' na
tionwide network, and they will face lower de
ductibles and copayments under the now plan,
known as Cardinal Care.
Students will still receive 100 percent coverage for
visits to Cowell Student I lealth Center, and the quar
terly rate for insurance will stay the same at $182. All
students are required to have Stanford or some other
form of insurance before they can register.
According to Cowell Student 1 lealth Center Direc
tor Ira Friedman, the changes will lead to "more
choices, more options than before" because Blue
Cross' network extends into all 50 states. Currently,
the University buys insurance on students' behalf
from Mega Life, which Friedman said had a substan
tially more restricted list of outside providers.
Students will be covered for 80 percent of the cost
of care at a network hospital after they meet a $200
annual deductible. They will be responsible for the
remaining 20 percent, and their maximum annual
contribution will be set at $1,500. Currently, stu
dents are covered for 70 percent at outside hospitals.
Friedman said the additional coverage without
any increase in premiums was possible because of
Blue Cross' advantageous position in the health care
market. He added that the University does not pro
vide any subsidy for the insurance.
Although it is very common for universities to pro
vide insurance for students and quite common to in
sist that they have some form of coverage, Friedman
said Cardinal Care was in many ways "completely
new."
One unusual aspect is the extent to which stu
dents are covered for providers other than Cowell and
Stanford Medical Center. Students need a referral
from Cowell to be 100 percent covered for care at
Stanford, but no referral is necessary for care at an
outside provider, which is covered up to 80 percent if
it is a member of the Blue Cross network and up to 60
percent otherwise.
"We put (the provision about outside providers! in
intentionally so that students will have more choice,"
Friedman said.
This sort of freedom for students to choose a
provider is very rare in university health plans.
Linda Maearelli, the insurance coordinator for
UCLA's student medical insur
ance plan, was skeptical about
Stanford's ability to provide this
kind of coverage without in
creased premiums.

She said UCLA exercised sub
stantially more "gatekeeping"
functions to determine what kind
of care needs to be covered.
Stanford's new plan went in
"quite the opposite of the direction
health care is taking," Macarelli
said. She added that it would like
ly result in "no one minding the
store" and thus an increase in the

number of claims, which would in
turn require an increase in premi
ums.
Friedman said he anticipated
that people would continue to go
through Cowell because it is the
only way to obtain 100 percent
coverage, and he predicted that
there would be no increase in
claims.
