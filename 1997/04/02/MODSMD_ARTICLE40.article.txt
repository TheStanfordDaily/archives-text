### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
After a successful spring break that
launched the outdoor season, the
future of the Stanford track and field
team looks brighter. On the weekend of
March 22, the squad competed in the
Stanford Invitational, and the follow
ing Saturday, the Cardinal faced Pacif
ic 10 Conference rival Oregon and UC-
Irvine at home. In that meet, the men
took second place while the women
took first.
The invitational "was a great meet
for us," said coach Vin Lananna.
"Especially given the fact that there
were 92 NCAA Division I qualifiers,
our performance was outstanding.
"Oregon was also a very good meet
for us. They're probably one of the
toughest dual-meet competitors."
Against the Ducks, freshman
Michael Harte grabbed first place in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of
14.50 seconds.
"I felt my race was pretty clean tech
nically, but I need to work on my speed
now and that should come as the year
progresses," Harte said.
Junior Jeff Allen continued the Car
dinal men's domination, winning the
400-meter hurdles with a time of 52.68.
Junior Damon Dunn and senior Jim
mie Johnson wrapped up the 100 and
the 200 with times of 10.67 and 21.28,
respectively. Johnson then went on to
win his other two events, the 400 in
47.42 and the 4 x 100 relay at 41.13,

while Dunn came in second in the 200.
"I did all right," Johnson said, "but
if I had run only one event I could have
done better."
The 800 and the 1,500 were also cap
tured by Stanford runners. Junior
Jason Lunn won the 800 in 1 minute,
48.78 seconds, and senior J.J. White
ran the 1,500 in 3:47.40. In other
events, the men's 4 x 400 relay team
took first with a time of 3:15.98 while
sophomore Jauron Pigg won the long
jump with a leap of 23 feet, 8 inches.
Finally, in the hammer, senior Justin
Strand took first with a throw of 204
feet, 5 inches.
At the invitational, the Cardinal
men had some outstanding perfor
mances in their strongest events: the
distances.
In the 1,500, Lunn came in first with
a time of 3:42.12, qualifying provision
ally for the NCAAs and also setting a
new meet record. White continued the
strong distance performances by finish
ing fourth in the 5,000 at 14.01.96.
Sophomore twins Brent and Brad
Hauser and senior Rob Reeder then fin
ished 3-4-5 in the 10,000 with times of
28:46.35, 29:05.25 and 29:15.17,
respectively. Brent also set a meet
record mark in the process.
To round out the day, senior Justin
Strand and junior Adam Connolly pro
visionally qualified for the NCAAs and
finished 2-3, respectively in the ham
mer throw with throws of 219-7 and
213-5.
In women's action against Oregon,

sophomore Tracye Lawyer captured

feet. The triple jump saw junior Rhon
