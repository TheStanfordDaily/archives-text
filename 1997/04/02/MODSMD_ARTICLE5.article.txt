When he was a child, Andrew Leeds was so
shy that he would hide behind his mother's
leg.
In order to rid him of the habit, Mrs. Leeds
placed her son in a singing and movement
group in his hometown of Clearwater, Fla. He
hated it the first day, but with time he learned
to love it, oblivious to the fact that those class
es would lead him into a deep appreciation for
acting and the entertainment business.
This quarter, lxieds, a freshman, is bring
ing the daring musical "Falsettos" to life at
Stanford. "Falsettos" Is a story about the tri
als and tribulations a divorced couple must
face after the husband admits his homosexu
ality. The musical won a Tony Award for best
score and book and a Pulitzer Prize in 1992.
According to Auren Kule, a close friend of
the actor and producer of the Stanford pro
duction, Leeds "doesn't want to repeat how
the musical was done on Broadway, but wants
to add originality and create his own take on
the story."
Leeds developed a love for this Broadway
musical when he played the role of the couple's
son. He said the story of "Falsettos" makes
people think a little deeper than usual.

"If it's done right," said, "you should
cry."
The cast of "Falsettos" includes freshmen
Eugene Walters and Nathan Baynard, sopho
mores Alicia Liza ma and Brandi Jensen, ju
nior Jeremy Sawyer and senior Jane Lee,
Kule, Ephraim Luft and David Lampson are
the show's prf)ducers. The crew consists of
musical director Todd Feldman, technical di
rector Aren Sandersen, vocal director Jen
Chou and costume designer Jenny Ellickson.
This project demonstrates the ambition
that has driven Leeds since childhood. When
was 8 years old, he had a boundle&s vi
sion and optimism. He was ashow-biz-kid. He
traveled to auditions in Now York, sang and
danced his heart out in musicals and did voice
overs for Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs com
mercials.
At 8 years old he was an understudy in the
Broadway musical "Teddy and Alice" but
quickly climbed the ranks when, according to
Ijeeds, "one of the kids was running back
stage, tripped and cracked his head open."
I jeeds took over the role fulltime and until this
day swears he didn't trip the running kid.
But that wasn't his finest hour. His brown
eyes widen and an excited smile crosses his
face as he remembers when he was 9 and au

ditioried for the role of Gavroche, the young
boy in the Broadway musical, "la>s Miser
ables."
"That was probably the most fun I've ever
had," I.<eeds said, "but then it always changes
because whatever I'm doing is the most fun
I've ever had."
His days of ncting in the musical ended
when he grew too tall for the role. He recalls
that he started the show at 53 i riches and grew
to 57 inches.
Afraid to reveal his new height, Leeds said,
"The director would come over to visit, and I
would hide,"
After "Les Miserable*" Ijeeds acted in two
musicals, an opera and a movie before he land -
ed the role of Dotson in the film "Major
Payne" starring Damon Wayans.
He stated, "I'm more proud of my theater
work as far as quality is concerned than the
work I've done on movies."
Kule said that I<eeds has always been con
cerned with making quality No. 1.
Looking beyond college productions, Leeds
has even loftier plans for the future.
"My goal is to run the Walt Disney Co. I
want to design roller coasters and be involved

in the technical side of building
theme parks," he said.
Today, he admits to still playing
with Ijego blocks. It seems that the
young actor has found a way to
merge his childhood love with his
future ambition.
Ellickson, Leeds' resident assi
tant in Rinconada, and "Falset
tos" costume designer, described

him as "one of the nicest people
I've ever met." She said one of the
actor / director's most outstand
ing qualities is that he doesn't
seem to dislike anyone and that
although he has a background in
show business, he is self-effacing.
Lull, a producer of "Falsettos"
and a good friend of Leeds', said
"When you meet Andrew he's right
there meeting you, and that's one
of the things that make him a dy
namic individual."
Falsettos will he playing May 29,
30 and 31 in the 1 /ittle Theater.
