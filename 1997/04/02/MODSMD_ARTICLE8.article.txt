# Sleep Center celebrates 25th year
## Outreach programs scheduled to help bring attention to disorders 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Beginning this month, the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Center will celebrate its silver an
niversary by offering outreach programming
to students, faculty and outside community
members.
The center, which was established in No
vember 1972 as the first of its kind, will be
kicking off its anniversary on April 21 with a
day-long program called "Great Transition:
Adolescent Development, Biological Rhythms
and the Destruction of Sleep." Faculty and
staff of Bay Area high schools and middle
schools also have been invited to attend this
event. '
This particular program was scheduled
first because "the whole issue of being able to
deal with sleep deprivation was initiated at

the Stanford Summer Sleep Camp," said Psy
chiatry Prof. William Dement, the center's di
rector. The camp ran every year from 1976 to
1985 and began in the Lambda Nu house.
"Before that, there was no notion that sleep
debt builds up. All of the concerns began with
these scientific breakthroughs."
"We're the largest sleep disorders facility
in the world," said Marvin Miles, an adminis
trative associate at the center.
Despite the accolades, Dement emphasized
that outreach programs would play a major
role in the center's celebration.
"Instead of patting ourselves on the back,
it's better to celebrate by doing something for
others," Dement said. "We want to reach out
in a feasible way ... to students with sleep
problems."
Stanford students "do have some of the se
rious sleep disorders, but we don't know the

prevalence of complaints," Dement said
He estimated that 20 percent of students in
the University suffer from some type of sleep
disorder while 80 percent complain that they
simply are not able to get enough sleep
Although the center will include many out
reach programs during its celebration, the
services offered are not necessarily free of
charge.
"I think we could manage to take care of
problems one way or another. What we
couldn't do would be to allow everyone to
come into the clinic free," Dement said
As another part of the center's outreach,
one of Dement's students is preparing a sec
tion of Cowell's annual health survey to mea
sure Stanford students' sleep habits.
"This is rarely done in universities because
people don't think it's important," Dement
said.
