SUMMER SCHOOL FOR PEOPLE
ON THEIR WAY TO THE TOP.
If you didn t sign up for ROTC as a freshman or sophomore, you can
still catch up to your classmates by attending Army ROTC Camp
Challenge, a paid six-week summer course in leadership training. By
the time you have graduated from college, you'll have the credentials
of an Army officer. You'll also have the self-confidence and discipline
it takes to succeed in college and beyond.
Find out more! Contact Captain Rhonda Lovko at 1 -800-227-ROTC
or come by Varsi Hall, Room 201, Santa Clara University.
