### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Praised by teachers for his "remarkable degree of
commitment" to public service, junior Eric Beerbohm
is among 69 students nationwide to receive a $30,000
Truman scholarship for 1997.
The awards are given annually by the Truman
Foundation to undergraduates who have displayed a
commitment to government or public interest and
public service. Since 1977, there have been 37 Tru
man scholars from Stanford.
"This award is a recognition of Eric's remarkable
degree of excellence, passion and commitment," said
Robert McGinn, Stanford's Truman scholarship fac
ulty representative, director of the Science, Technolo
gy and Society Program and a professor of industrial
engineering and engineering management.
McGinn said Beerbohm "is a real standout. The
committee confirmed what was apparent to us."
Beerbohm said he was suprised and excited to re
ceive the honor.
"I am happy to get to know a whole bunch of other
people interested in public service who will be re
sources in the future," he said.
"I feel like the scholarship is a way to help people
with their work in public service. It isn't really an
award to me, much more of a way to continue my
work."
Beerbohm was chosen as one of four Stanford nom
inees for the award by a committee consisting of
McGinn, Economics Prof. Gavin Wright and Timothy
Stanton, the director of the Haas Center for Public
Service.
After becoming a Stanford nominee, Beerbohm
competed against 717 candidates from 369 colleges
and universities. After a series of interviews, he be
came one of 202 finalists for the award.
A political science major, Beerbohm attended the
Stanford in Washington program, serving as an aide
to the Associate Attorney General's Office and on the
health policy team of the Senate Committee on Labor
and Human Resources.
Beerbohm was praised by these offices for his work
in writing briefing memos and drafting a public state
ment by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum on the Newborn Pro
tection Act, according to McGinn.
"Eric strikes one as a person who has a synergistic
balance between persuasive advocate and extraordi
nary intellectual curiosity," he said.
Last year, Beerbohm and several other students
traveled to Los Angeles where they produced a video
documenting the lives of homeless people in the area.
Also, Beerbohm worked with a youth community
service organization in East Palo Alto to bring togeth
er young people from many different communities in
the area to interact.
Through a philosophy of working "directly with
and not on behalf of the people he aids, "Eric dis
plays a real passion for recognizing the humanity of
the individuals who he is of assistance to," said
McGinn.
About $3,000 of the Truman scholarship can be ap
plied to the last year of undergraduate work. The re
maining $27,000 must be applied to the first three
years of graduate school.
