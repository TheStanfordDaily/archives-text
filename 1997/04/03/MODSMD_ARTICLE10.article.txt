Debts hinder Democrats
WASHINGTON (AP) — Mired in debt, Presi
dent Clinton's Democratic Party is so focused on
escaping the fund-raising taint of 1996 that some
activists fear critical future planning is being
ignored or shortchanged.
Hanging over every effort to prepare for the
1998 congressional and gubernatorial elections is
this daunting fact: 25 cents of every dollar raised
by the Democratic National Committee this year is
earmarked to erase debt or to refund illegal or
questionable contributions accepted last year.
Democratic leaders acknowledge a fair amount
of worry and grumbling in the party ranks, but say
it's mostly unfounded.
Moving ahead with party fund-raising efforts,
Clinton was the headliner last night at a $750,000
Democratic Business Leadership Council event.

The DNC is $12.7 million in debt, and the party
has committed to returning, by June 30, some $ 1.5
million in 1995-96 contributions.
