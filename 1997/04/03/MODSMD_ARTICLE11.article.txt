# Strawberries sicken kids
## Michigan Hepatitis A outbreak tied to tainted fruit 
### 
DETROIT (AP) — Her family thought it was just a
stomach virus. Then Amanda Bischoff began vomit
ing constantly and the little girl's eyes turned yellow.
"She looked like a daffodil," Patty Bischoff said of
her daughter.
Amanda ended up among about 150 Michigan
schoolchildren and adults who authorities believe
contracted hepatitis A from tainted frozen strawber
ries that were shipped to the government's school
lunch program.
Amanda got better in time to celebrate her ninth
birthday Friday, but thousands of students and educa
tors in six states may have been exposed, including as
many as 9,000 people in Los Angeles, where tainted
fruit cup was served last week in 18 public schools.
Some communities plan to offer protective
gamma globulin shots to hundreds of youngsters.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said yester

day it will investigate how Mexican-grown strawber
ries got into the USDA school lunch program, which
is required to buy only U.S. products.
So far, the only reported illnesses linked to the
tainted berries have been in Michigan. Strawberries
with the same lot numbers were also sent to Arizona,
California, Georgia, lowa and Tennessee.
About 1 million pounds of strawberries could be
contaminated, FDA Acting Commissioner Michael
Friedman said. A little less than half were sent to the
school lunch program, while the others were used
commercially, he said.
The vice president of the berries' distributor, San
Diego-based Epitope, contradicted the FDA figures
yesterday, saying 2.6 million pounds were shipped in
mid-December. Some 1.7 million pounds went to the
school lunch program and 900,000 pounds went to
other customers, Matthew Kramer said.
