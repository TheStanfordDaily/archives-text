New Palo Alto ordinance
unfairly removes homeless
from University Avenue

PALO ALTO CITY Council
members insist that an ordi
nance passed last month
that prevents anyone from sitting
or lying on the main stretch of Uni
versity Avenue's sidewalk serves
only to protect pedestrians and
shoppers, making the streets safer
and easier to navigate.
Opponents of the "sit-lie" ordi
nance and advocacy groups for the
homeless insist — quite rightfully
that the ordinance is nothing
more than a thinly veiled attempt
to clear the otherwise upscale Uni
versity Avenue of panhandlers and
other unkempt individuals.
Interestingly, the ordinance only
bans people from sitting or lying on
University Avenue during the time
of day when the street's shops and
restaurants conduct most of their
business.
The ordinance's initiator, coun
cilman Gary Fazzino, insists that
sidewalk hazards in Palo Alto pose
a legitimate threat to downtown
shoppers. According to a city attor
ney's report, 10 percent of the liti
gation in which the city is involved
is directly related to sidewalk haz
ards. Hut Police Chief Chris
Durkin said last month that there
is not a single documented case of
anyone tripping over anyone else
in downtown Palo Alto.
Opponents of the ordinance
have further pointed out that
whether or not the Palo Alto City
Council members like it, the U.S.
Constitution protects soliciting,
welcome and unwelcome. Accord
ingly, opponents of the ordinance
have done their best to present the
issue to the public as a constitu
tional dilemma.
As far as the issue of free speech
is concerned, city officials have
taken what can be best described

as a somewhat casual tone. Fazzino
told the San Francisco Chronicle
that "nobody has the constitution
al right to block a public sidewalk."
The city attorney has said that
people who wish to "express them
selves" can do so by sitting on
benches and planters or moving to
a side street — away from heavy
pedestrian traffic and away from
Palo Alto shoppers.
Yet it would be an unfair criti
cism to say that the "sit-lie" ordi
nance ignores the issue of free
speech altogether. The law makes a
small concession, allowing anyone
who wishes to communicate by sit
ting or lying to do so in Lytton
Plaza, the concrete space adjacent
to Burger King.
That part of the ordinance is
laughable. It's like saying Ameri
can citizens can only publicly criti
cize the government on Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons or some
thing equally arbitrary.
The ordinance is also generous
enough to make another egalitari
an concession: It permits sitting
and lying during medical emergen
cies and for those confined to
wheelchairs and strollers.
From a humanitarian stand
point, an ordinance that has to
specifically create such an exemp
tion is ridiculous. The idea that
without such an exemption a phys
ically disabled person could be
arrested because he or she is
unable to stand is appalling.
But putting all humanitarian
issues aside, the "sit-lie" ordinance
remains a harmful piece of legisla
tion. The real objection that mer
chants and city council members
have to sitters and liers on Univer
sity Avenue, who more often than
not take the form of panhandlers,
is their presence alone.
It doesn't take a bleeding-heart
liberal or a group of advocates for
the residentially challenged to see
the major flaw of the ordinance.
It's a little thing called the First
Amendment. The "sit-lie" ordi
nance deliberately and woefully
neglects it.
