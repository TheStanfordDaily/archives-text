## Exploring the inner beast 
### 
I love war and responsibility and excite
ment. Peace is going to be hell on me."
— George S. Patton
While most of Stanford was tak
ing a break with friends and
family, hovering around televi
sions for a glimpse of college basketball
and recovering from finals-induced sleep
deprivation, I was learning how to slice
open a person's abdomen with a rapier
and the best way to choke someone to
death with a phone cord — all without
actually killing them.
From 9 in the morning until 9 at
night, over an intensive seven-day peri
od, I took part in a stage combat work
shop. Unlike real combat, where people
kill or get killed, stage combat is an art
form in which there is the perception of
actual combat and even death, without
the element of physical harm coming to
the combatants.
As an actor who has been involved in
stage combat before, it amazes me that
some people aren't aware how much
energy and time goes into this art form.
Whether you see it on the screen or
stage, a fight scene is something which
involves meticulous direction and an
exhaustive rehearsal process.
It is a time-consuming activity
involving physical and emotional
endurance with the goal of apparent
ease and confidence in performance
(unless your character is supposed to

lack those characteristics, of course).
The next time you see Steven Segal
drop-kick an enemy or watch Mercutio
fall under Tybalt's blade or catch an
episode of "Walker: Texas Ranger" (how
ever doubtful that may be), keep in mind
that every move you see in every fight,
no matter how small, has been painstak
ingly choreographed by a certified fight
choreographer. After all, we wouldn't
want Chuck Norris actually to have his
ribs broken, now would we?
The odd thing is, after all this chore
ography and attention to safety, one
can't help but sense the fears and ner
vous energy of an actual fight. While act
ing in a staged fight, you can't help but
grunt and yell and sweat. It would be
unnatural not to.
I think we all have a penchant for vio
lence. But how violent can a sober Stan
ford student get? How many times have
you wanted to hit that teaching assistant
or run that bicyclist over? But you can't,
probably due to legal constraints. Stage
combat is a healthy — and legal — way
to let that dark, animal side rise to the
surface.
We often forget how animalistic
humans really are. We mark our territo
ries, fight for our lives and are in con
stant competition for survival, whether
on an economic, social or political level.
But, our evolution has consisted of a
chain of events all in the pursuit of sup
pressing our animal nature in exchange

for a supposedly civilized world. This
pursuit for civilization has left us, or at
least me, estranged from our animal
side. A side we observe in war, on inner-;
city streets and, for some people, myself
excluded, in the bedroom. %
The simple feel of a lethal weapon ii(
my hand, whether rapier, broad sword/
dagger, phone cord or plastic bag, is
enough to raise anyone's blood pressure.
It's very much like dance or yoga or
tai-chi; stage combat requires and cre
ates what acting teachers call a connect
edness to the body that we tend to have
trouble with in everyday life. A connect
edness that athletes must strive for in
every game or competition if they want
to win.
For me, it was "combat therapy,"
something akin to what Spalding Gray
calls "war therapy": fictional combat
with the psycho-physiological effects of
an actual fight. After all, there's nothing
more exciting or arousing as fighting for
your life.
Especially in front of an audience.

Jordan Gelber, a senior majoring in
drama and communication, can be seen
this weekend performing at the Rodin
Sculpture Garden. Unfortunately, he will
not be fighting anyone.
