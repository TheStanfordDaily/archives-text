Middle East peace process hinges on rejection of violence

I WRITE IN response to yesterday's let
ter from Amir Najmi, Hilton Oben
zinger ;uid Rebecca Stein. The letter
began with a short paragraph condemning
(lu* March 21 terrorist bombing in Tel
\viv that killtxl three innocent Israeli civil
ians and wounded 48 more. The remain
der of the letter, however, was a biased
attack on the Israeli government's policy
if building housing in East Jerusalem, the
opening of a tunnel entrance vaguely
described as "close to Muslim holy places"
and accusations that the Israeli govern
ment "lias repeatedly humiliated and pro
voked the Palestinians."
1 request that the authors of yester
day'.- letter stop insulting the intelligence
if t he Stanford community by expressing
heir gre.-it sympathy for the innocent vic
itns of thi tragedy." If they are truly
■ony for the terror, then their letter
hould have stopped idler the first para
graph, but this was not their ulterior
motive.
I take i -ne with the authors' assertion
i hat "In Israel and abroad, public discus
ion of the Palestinian-Israeli peace pro
cess has once again shift ed to issues of ter
rorism For virtually all Israelis 1 know
iid for most Palestinians, terrorism and
violence, no matter who the perpetrator,
re the central issues of the peace process,
Hid they always have lx»en. The authors
re attempting to downplay and minimize
he importance of terror and violence, and
this is simply wrong.

Ironically, yesterday's Daily also print
ed an Associated Press story about a series
of bungled terror attacks in the Gaza
Strip. In one incident, a suicide bomber
accidentally blew himself up before he
could reach his target, a school bus filled
with Jewish children on their way to
school at the Jewish settlement of Net
zarim. Fortunately, the only casualty was
the evil man whose goal was to slaughter
children.
This summer, I taught English to a
similar group of Israeli children in a small
town called Kiryat Malachi, not to far
from where yesterday's attack took place.
Ix?t me assure Najmi, Obenzinger and
Stein that my 12- and 13-year-old students
have absolutely no interest in oppressing
anyone, but they wake up every morning
aware that there are many "people" who
would walk onto their school bus and mur
der them all.
Other Israeli children have not been as
lucky as my friends from Kiiyat Malachi
or the children of Netzarim. Ijast month,
in what can only be described as a display
of pure evil, a lunatic who happened to be
a Jordanian soldier sprayed automatic
gunfire into a large group of Israeli school
children visiting the "Island of Peace" in
Jordanian territoiy. Dozens of children
were injured; seven young girls died at the
scene.
Fortunately, in that case, cooler heads
prevailed. This disgusting act was not the
act of a state or a people, but the act of an

individual, not unlike the equally evil act
committed by Dr. Baruch Goldstein, an
American-born Jewish settler who massa
cred more than 20 innocent Palestinians
in a Hebron Mosque three years ago.
N{\jmi, Obenzinger and Stein would
have us all believe that between acts of ter
ror and violence, the real issues concern
"who opened a tunnel where" and that
terror and violence are simply politics by
another means. The truth is that the
authors of yesterday's letter were not
merely expressing their sadness about the
terror attack; they were attempting to jus
tify it.
Sometimes we need to call a spade a
spade. At least one of the authors of yes
terday's letter has made several public
statements on the Middle East crisis.
Rebecca Stein has written several letters
to The Daily in recent years, and her atti
tude toward terror and violence has not
always been so casual and dismissive. She
co-signed a letter to The Daily printed
March 3, 1994, (shortly after the Hebron
massacre) which assigned "collective
responsibility" to the Israeli government
for Goldstein's deeds. Apparently violence
and terror are root causes of the conflict,
so long as they are only perpetrated by
Jews.
Stein has been an active member of a
group called "Middle East Focus" since I
arrived at Stanford. This group aligned
itself with Hamas and publicly opposed the
peace process nearly since its inception,

long before Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power.
I believe that yesterday's letter was the
latest in an ongoing attempt to deceive
members of the Stanford community
about the peace process, and, frankly, I
question whether Stein and her friends
would be happy with any agreement
including Jewish sovereignty in Israel.
At the time of the Hebron attack, the
late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
called Goldstein "a Hamas member."
Rabin understood that there are two sides
to the ongoing crisis, but that they are not
the sides we have traditionally believed in.
The crisis is no longer between Israelis
and Palestinians, Jews and Muslims, secu
larists and fundamentalists — it is
between those who want to stop terror and
violence and those who don't.
Most decent people want a negotiated,
fair peace. The issues are complicated and
difficult, but let's stop comparing building
settlements with killing children. I'd say
that most Jews on this campus have seri
ous concerns about the expansion of settle
ments, while all decent people should feel
nothing short of revulsion toward the
killing of Jewish school children and inno
cent Muslim worshipers.
We know where Goldstein stood and
Hamas stands. My question to Najmi,
Obenzinger and Stein is simple: Which
side are you on?
