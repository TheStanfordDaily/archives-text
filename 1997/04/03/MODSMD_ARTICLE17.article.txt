# PLO leader Arafat is not a wronged innocent
## 
### 
\fter reading yesterday's letter from
Amir Najmi, Hilton Obenzinger and
bVbocca Stoin, one would got the impres
-11 that PiUestinian leader Yasser Arafat
i (lie wronged innocent and that Israel is
inly to blame for the current Middle

East situation.
I'd like to remind the writers that the
terrorist attack in Tel Aviv was a violation
of the Oslo accords, and I wonder if they
are suggesting that if you don't get what
you want it's OK to blow up innocent
women and children.
It seems that every time that Arafat
wants to make a point he unleashes his
terrorist to do their work. In addition,
Arafat is in violat ion of the Oslo accords by

not having removed the clause in the
Palestinian constitution that calls for the
destruction of Israel.
As for the building on liar Homa, most
of this land belonged to the Jews prior to
1948, and it was taken from them by the
Jordanians during the war for indepen
dence. The status of Jerusalem was not in
the Oslo accords, so the building on Har
Honia is not a violation of the accords.
It is very nice the writers can complete

ly ignore Arafat's provocations and blame
everything on Israeli Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu. It must be nice to be liv
ing in a fantasy land where good and evil
are so easily delineated.
Maybe it is time for them to remove
their rose-colored glasses and see that
Arafat is not the poor, wronged innocent
that he makes himself out to be.
