## Scott Judd and Irvin Tyan Friends remember Henry Tien as a dedicated 'quiet hero' 
### 
WHEN A CLOSE
friend dies,
we're often
haunted with the ques
tion "Why?" Why did he
have to leave us? He
didn't deserve to die, we
tell ourselves.
Yet, no matter what
we do, despite all our
attempts to reason the

death, the question "Why?" persists.
There seems to be no answer. And
although it is natural to cry, to feel the
painful void and to rage against the cruel
unfairness of the world, we should
instead try to appreciate and celebrate
the life of a cherished one while sharing
and reliving the memories in death.
You may not know much about it, but
the world lost a very special person Mon
day, March 24. His name was Henry
Tien, and he was one of our best friends.
You could say a lot of impressive things
about Henry, and they'd all be true. He
was a double major in biology and psy
chology and always had a full course load.
Yet he still found time to coordinate the
Arbor Free Clinic, study for the MCAT,
apply to medical school and work as the
head advising associate in Paloma.
But these phrases only describe what

Henry did and not who
he was.
Although his resume
was packed, Henry
stood out from the
crowd due to more than
his varied academic
achievements. It was
his strength of charac
ter and his genuine love
and concern for the

people around him that made him dearly
cherished by all who knew him.
Henry distinguished himself as an
honors student in the Biology Depart
ment, but what made him truly singular
was the maturity and elegance he
brought to his life and relationships.
Henry was a quiet hero who always
helped others without expecting anything
in return. It was something he did to
make the world a little better, a personal
code he followed simply because he felt it
was the right thing to do.
The death of Henry Tien shocked the
entire Stanford community, from his
close friends in Toyon to the freshmen in
Paloma. Friends wept, hugged each other
and discussed his death. Points were
repeatedly brought up about Henry's
uniquely admirable character. What was
so special about him?

It was something intangible, a charis
ma that was both effortless and indefin
able. Even complete strangers lamented
his death. Although Residence Dean
Patricia Polhemus had never met him,
she cried twice afler reading The Daily's
Monday article. Henry just had a certain
magical aura that allowed him to reach
out and touch everyone he knew and even
those he didn't know. It was Henry who
always stopped to chat with the custodial
staff in the hall. He was the type of person
whose message board was always filled
with notes, the type whose phone rang
constantly.
Henry was popular with everyone he
met. The responsibility and dedication he
exhibited towards his work always
astounded those who knew him. He
always used to say, "If you're going to do
something, you might as well do it well,"
and he lived by that belief.
As an AA his junior year, he showed
such care and concern for his advisees
that he visited them frequently, often
talking for many hours with each one.
Always organized, Henry took pride in
the neat row of textbooks and binders —
binders that contained complete notes
and copies of several years' worth of old
exams for every biology, organic chem
istry and physics premedical class he had

taken. He would lend his binders out to
anyone who asked, and the demand was
so high that the shelf always contained
gaping holes. He was someone you could
always count on; if Henry said he would
do something, he did it and he did it well.
This dedication was combined with a
rare and keen capacity to love. Henry
loved people — he loved his friends, he
loved his Paloma frosh, he loved the
Arbor Clinic; he did everything to express
that care. Freshman year, Henry's room
mate was blind, so Henry always made
time to show him around the dorm and
even color coordinated his clothes. One
night last year, he drove to a drugstore to
pick up candy, pens and stationery. It was
Dead Week, and he was making little care
packages for his advisees so they would
feel less stressed while studying for finals.
Henry always tried to make people's
lives happier in seemingly small yet such
important ways. He was the one who
would plan all the birthday bashes in
Toyon.
Henry knew what type of music his
friends liked to listen to and would have
their favorite tapes ready to play even
before they stepped in his beloved
Acura Legend. His sincerity and gen
uine love in helping people any way he
could earned the respect and loyalty of

his many friends.
Henry's death has affected all of us
greatly. We grieve at his loss, and the
empty void in our hearts can never and will
never be replaced. In life, Henry was a true
role model, a gentleman whose ideals and
work ethic were admired and followed.
So many people have said they benefit
ed greatly from simply interacting with
him. Instead of angrily raging against the
unfairness of the world — one where the
nobility of spirit and the integrity of mind
are tragically and abruptly ended — we
can learn from Henry even in his death.
By reliving all our memories, by
remembering Henry's strength of charac
ter, by following his down-to-earth sincer
ity, by loving others the way Henry loved
us, by showing dedication and reminding
ourselves to be responsible individuals
the way Henry was — it is in this way that
we can make meaning of his death while
keeping his spirit alive. And Henry would
have wanted that.

Scott Judd, a senior majoring in psychol
ogy and economics, and Irvin fyan, a
junior majoring in English and biology,
invite the Stanford community to com
memorate Henry's life in a memorial ser
vice to be held Sunday at 1 p.m. in the
lounge ofToyon Hall.
