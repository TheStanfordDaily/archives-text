# Stanford Card no longer has ATM option: current users unaffected
## Wells Fargo ends ID card banking 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
From now on, Stanford cards will no longer be
linked to Wells Fargo banking, because of changes the
bank is planning in its ATM card technology.
Wells Fargo will no longer offer the banking option,
which was only introduced at the beginning of the
1995-96 academic year.
David Kiyokawa, the vice president of Weils Fargo's
Campus Card division, said, "Wells Fargo is in the
process of re-evaluating the campus card strategies. We

discussed this with (University Registrar) Roger Print
up, and it was a mutual decision to stop offering the
Wells Fargo option."
He also cited Wells Fargo's "exploration of new card
technologies" such as a chip-based card rather than the
current magnetic stripe card as a reason for the discon
tinuation of the joint association, although he said the
reasons that caused the stoppage of the plan were "pro
prietary."
Printup, however, had a different version of events.
"I wouldn't say the decision was mutual at all. They
wanted to move in a direction that, if the University

adapted it, would cost additional money and would add
no value to Stanford."
"Stanford was happy with the situation with Wells
Fargo, and we're sorry to see it. end Their move to a
new system was for their own reasons," he added.
Current cards with the magnetic stri|>e cost the uni
versity approximately 50 cents to manufacture, accord
ing to Printup, hut the cards that Wells Fargo suggest
ed with a chip would have cost It) dollars each.
"We would have had to issue new cards to every-
body, and there are more than
30,000 cardholders who would have
had to receive new cards," Printup
said.
Kiyokawa said that current
cardholders who had a dual Stan
ford / ATM card don't have to
worry.
"Benefits will continue [for cur
rent cardholders 1 as long as they are
enrolled at Stanford," he explained.
Wells Fargo will send more infor
mation regarding possible changes
directly to current holders of the

Stanford Card with the Wells Fargo
banking option.
Concerning the future of having
another financial institution re
place Wells Fargo's role of a linked
Stanford Card / ATM card, Print
up said, "There is too little time to
set up a similar system with a fi
nancial institution for fall quarter
next year. However, if we don't go
to other institutions, they will
come to us."
One obvious alternative option
would be linking cards to ATMs of
the Stanford Federal Credit Union.
Credit Union President Warren
Marshall said "The arrangement
between Stanford and Wells Fargo
was mainly marketing. This devel

opment will definitely help us. We
will market to more students and
pick up any services the University
wants to have continued. I would
certainly like the opportunity to
talk to the University."
The end of the Wells Fargo ser
vice will not affect the Stanford
Card Plan, which is separate from
the linked ATM card. Aspects of the
plan such as usage in Tresidder Ex
press, Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, vending machines and laundry
facilities will not be affected.
The campus branch of Wells
Fargo in Tresidder Union is sepa
rate from the card plan and will
also remain unaffected by this de
cision.
