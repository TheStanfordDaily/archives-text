## Volleyball takes two from Hawaii Spikers take MPSF division 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
After a more than two-week
hiatus from play at home, the
No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball
team returned home to Burn
ham Pavilion for two matches
against No. 6 Hawaii. The Car
dinal (18-3, 13-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
came away from both Tuesday
and last night's matches with
victories over the Rainbows.
The two victoires over last
year's national runner-up
would have been significant
under any circumstances, yet
the wins took on greater mean
ing, as the sweep of Hawaii
allowed Stanford to clinch the
division title in the MPSF.
While the result in both match
es was the same, the matches
were very different in their
respective compositions.
Tuesday night's affair was
one of Stanford's closest
matches of the seasoji. The
Cardinal managed to eke out a
five-game victory 15-12, 17-15,
7-15, 12-15, 15-10. The first
game set the tone for what the
rest of the match had in store.
The teams battled back and
forth early on until Hawaii
managed to build an 8-5 lead,
causing Stanford to take a
timeout.
Coming out of the timeout,
with freshman outside hitter
Andy Witt serving, Stanford
rallied, getting to 8-7. After
exchanging points, Stanford
eventually tied the match at
10-10 and, after three more
ties, went ahead for good at 13-
12 behind two consectutive
aces from junior serving spe
cialist Devin Poolman. These
two serves shattered the Rain
bows' resolve, and Stanford got
the victory on a block by Witt
15-12.
In game two, the teams
exchanged leads, eventually

reaching a final tie at 15-15.
With the outcome of the game
very much in doubt, the Cardi
nal reached down again and
came up with two consecutive
points, sealing the victory in
the second game 17-15.
Hawaii was outhit .477 to
.311, and the only thing that
allowed the Rainbows to keep
the game close was the Cardi
nal's atrocious serving. This
was the story throughout the
match, as Hawaii served quite
well, amassing 14 aces with
only 16 errors, while the Cardi
nal amassed an equal number
of aces but suffered 33 mis
cues.
Stanford appeared to be in
complete control of the match
going into the third game.
However, Hawaii mounted a
comeback. After Stanford led
early, Hawaii battled back to
take the lead 7-6 and then
pulled away quickly, winning
the game easily, 15-7. The
Rainbows dominated in every
aspect of the game, outhitting
Stanford .464 to .314, and con
tinued to serve well.
However, while appearing
strong in the third game,
Hawaii faltered badly in the
early stages of the fourth game.
The Rainbows staked Stanford
to a 12-7 lead, giving the crowd
of 899 a lot to cheer about and
leaving the fans from Hawaii,
who filled a substantial section
of Burnham, very little to be
happy about. Although Stan
ford looked ready to close out
the match, the Rainbows
refused to go away, rallying
and taking the next eight
points from Stanford to win the
game 15-12.
The fifth and final game of
the match began just as badly
as the fourth had ended for
Stanford. The Card got down
quickly 2-0, but managed to

retake the lead 6-4 in the rally
scoring format of the decisive
game.
Although the Rainbows
attempted to stop the bleeding
by calling a timeout, Stanford
would not be denied, as the team
rallied behind the strong and
vocal play of senior outside hit
ter Mike Lambert. Lambert
willed the team to victory in the
final game, punishing the Rain
bows as a blocker and hitter and
propelling Stanford to a 15-10
win in a game that was only
close early on.
The only reason that the
match was close was Hawaii's
excellent serving. Stanford's hit
ters dominated the match, hit
ting .429 and proving unstop
pable for Hawaii's net people.
"I thought that both teams
played really well," said head
coach Ruben Nieves of Tues
day's match. "We were fortunate
to be as strong at the net as we
were. They simply could not stop
our outside hitters.
"Witt and Lambert (who
totaled 33 and 42 kills, respec
tively) were really awesome.
They served amazingly well, and
we struggled serving, but our
net game, which is our strength,
came through. I'm sure, howev
er, that [the second] match will
be different from"the first.
Nieves proved to be a prophet,
as the complexion of the match,
if not the outcome, was entirely
different. Stanford did not play
an outstanding game at net, but
the squad's serving was great,
amassing seven aces and just 11
errors while Hawaii outhit Stan
ford but served poorly, with
three aces and 19 errors. The
end result was a Stanford victo
ry in a convincing fashion, 15-
13, 15-10, 15-9.
Game one was close all the
way, as both teams settled into
the pattern that had predomi
nated the previous night's play.
Finally, Stanford surged ahead
from a 13-13 tie to take the game
15-13. Lambert led the way for
Stanford, with an ace late in the
game and seven kills.
Although Stanford hit a very
average .349 for the game, the
Cardinal limited Hawaii to a
meager .279. Stanford's blocking

was tough and in a number of
rallies, the Cardinal's ability to
get to balls was uncanny, as it
came up with amazing saves and
digs.
While game one was close,
game two was never really in
doubt. Stanford took an early 5-
1 lead, and although Hawaii was
able to scrape back to a tie at 9-
9, Stanford put the Rainbows
away with impenetrable defense,
winning the second game easi
lyls-10.
Once again, the story of the
game was Hawaii's inability to
get spikes beyond Stanford's
front line. While the Cardinal's
hitting percentage was only
.316, Hawaii was hopeless, hit
ting a minuscule .180. Some of
this may have been due to
fatigue after Tuesday's match
and the lengthy trip from the
islands, but Stanford's stingy
defense deserved the bulk of the
praise.
After game two, the fans real
ly began to exhort Stanford onto
victory, cheering more loudly
with every Stanford point and
making thinly veiled mockeries
of Rainbow senior setter Curt
Vaughn's pink hair. This
approach proved fruitful, as
Vaughn, who had served very
well on Tuesday, struggled in
the final game, offering three
consecutive service errors.
The fans' taunts also fell on
freshman middle blocker Clay
Stanley, who hit one of his own
teammates in the back of the
head in his only service attempt.
Buoyed by the crowd and looking
forward to being rid of the
'Bows, Stanford cruised to an
easy 15-9 victory, punctuated by
an emphatic block by senior mid
dle blocker Mike Hoefer, the
player of the match.
"I was real pleased to get a
win in three games against a
team as good as Hawaii," Nieves
said. "I thought that we played
better in the first match, but it
was really nice to see our guys in
the middle step up and take
some of the load off Lambert and
Witt. Normally we are not as bal
anced an attacking team as we
were tonight."
With the victory, Stanford
took yet another step towardthe
Final Four, and ensuring the-
Cardinal of at least a No. 2 seed
ing in the eight-team MPSF
tournament, which will kick off
at Stanford April 19.
