## Volleyball takes two from Hawaii Spikers take MPSF division 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
After a more than two-week
hiatus from play at home, the
No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball
team returned home to Burn
ham Pavilion for two matches
against No. 6 Hawaii. The Car
dinal (18-3, 13-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
came away from both Tuesday
and last night's matches with
victories over the Rainbows.
The two victoires over last
year's national runner-up
would have been significant
under any circumstances, yet
the wins took on greater mean
ing, as the sweep of Hawaii
allowed Stanford to clinch the
division title in the MPSF.
While the result in both match
es was the same, the matches
were very different in their
respective compositions.
Tuesday night's affair was
one of Stanford's closest
matches of the seasoji. The
Cardinal managed to eke out a
five-game victory 15-12, 17-15,
7-15, 12-15, 15-10. The first
game set the tone for what the
rest of the match had in store.
The teams battled back and
forth early on until Hawaii
managed to build an 8-5 lead,
causing Stanford to take a
timeout.
Coming out of the timeout,
with freshman outside hitter
Andy Witt serving, Stanford
rallied, getting to 8-7. After
exchanging points, Stanford
eventually tied the match at
10-10 and, after three more
ties, went ahead for good at 13-
12 behind two consectutive
aces from junior serving spe
cialist Devin Poolman. These
two serves shattered the Rain
bows' resolve, and Stanford got
the victory on a block by Witt
15-12.
In game two, the teams
exchanged leads, eventually

reaching a final tie at 15-15.
With the outcome of the game
very much in doubt, the Cardi
nal reached down again and
came up with two consecutive
points, sealing the victory in
the second game 17-15.
Hawaii was outhit .477 to
.311, and the only thing that
allowed the Rainbows to keep
the game close was the Cardi
nal's atrocious serving. This
was the story throughout the
match, as Hawaii served quite
well, amassing 14 aces with
only 16 errors, while the Cardi
nal amassed an equal number
of aces but suffered 33 mis
cues.
Stanford appeared to be in
complete control of the match
going into the third game.
However, Hawaii mounted a
comeback. After Stanford led
early, Hawaii battled back to
take the lead 7-6 and then
pulled away quickly, winning
the game easily, 15-7. The
Rainbows dominated in every
aspect of the game, outhitting
Stanford .464 to .314, and con
tinued to serve well.
However, while appearing
strong in the third game,
Hawaii faltered badly in the
early stages of the fourth game.
The Rainbows staked Stanford
to a 12-7 lead, giving the crowd
of 899 a lot to cheer about and
leaving the fans from Hawaii,
who filled a substantial section
of Burnham, very little to be
happy about. Although Stan
ford looked ready to close out
the match, the Rainbows
refused to go away, rallying
and taking the next eight
points from Stanford to win the
game 15-12.
The fifth and final game of
the match began just as badly
as the fourth had ended for
Stanford. The Card got down
quickly 2-0, but managed to
