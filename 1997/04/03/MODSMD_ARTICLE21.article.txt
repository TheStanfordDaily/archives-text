### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water polo team will be
looking for revenge today when they meet California
in deGuerre Pool at 4 p.m.
The third ranked Cardinal will have another shot
at second-ranked Cal, who has defeated Stanford
twice in the past two weeks. The squad will also be in
aqtion Saturday at noon when it meets Pacific, and
then again Sunday Stanford will face UC-Davis at 2
p.m. and San Jose State at 3:30.
The Cardinal has faced Cal three times this season,

losing twice and coming out with only one win. The
sole Cardinal victory came in the Stanford Invitation
al back on March 9. Since then, Stanford has struggled
against Cal. Its first loss against the Golden Bears was
a 13-12 overtime setback March 19 in Berkeley.
Despite an exceptional first half by Stanford, Cal
clawed back and broke a 12-12 tie with three seconds
left in overtime to win the heartbreaker. The Cardinal
faced Cal one other time in a tournament in Hawaii
over spring break and lost 10-5. Although Stanford
lost to Cal, it still managed to take home a tournament
victory when the Golden Bears went home early.
