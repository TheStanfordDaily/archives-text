### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water polo team will be
looking for revenge today when they meet California
in deGuerre Pool at 4 p.m.
The third ranked Cardinal will have another shot
at second-ranked Cal, who has defeated Stanford
twice in the past two weeks. The squad will also be in
aqtion Saturday at noon when it meets Pacific, and
then again Sunday Stanford will face UC-Davis at 2
p.m. and San Jose State at 3:30.
The Cardinal has faced Cal three times this season,

losing twice and coming out with only one win. The
sole Cardinal victory came in the Stanford Invitation
al back on March 9. Since then, Stanford has struggled
against Cal. Its first loss against the Golden Bears was
a 13-12 overtime setback March 19 in Berkeley.
Despite an exceptional first half by Stanford, Cal
clawed back and broke a 12-12 tie with three seconds
left in overtime to win the heartbreaker. The Cardinal
faced Cal one other time in a tournament in Hawaii
over spring break and lost 10-5. Although Stanford
lost to Cal, it still managed to take home a tournament
victory when the Golden Bears went home early.
The Card will be looking to take
advantage of its home-pool advan
tage and evening its record with
the Golden Bears. This game Ls
also of importance because it is a
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion contest.
Stanford will play three more
times this weekend and is favored
in each of these mntches. The Car
dinal has not lost a mntch to Pacif

ic, UC-Davis or San Jose State all
season. The Cardinal's most recent
victory against these three teams
was a 15-5 shelling of Pacific in
Stockton March 15. The Pacific
game is also a league contests.
The Cardinal has been led offen
sively this season by the freshman
duo of Suze Gardner and Ellen
Estes and defensively by senior co
captain Alice Cathcart. The Stan
ford squad has been getting quality
play out of its starters all season
and will need the depth to make
the difference when the Cardinal
meets the Golden Bears this time.
