# One woman's dream: to win it all
## 
### 
I had the dream. I had a plan
that I meticulously put into
action. My quest, like that of so
many of the athletes who fill these
pages, was for a championship.

We had all the tools — experi
ence, depth, talent, speed, height
and coaching; this was our year.
Now let me take just a minute to
straighten out any confusion and
assure you that I'm not talking
about a measly NCAA champi
onship here. Oh no, this is on a
whole other level. We're talking
intramurals, baby.
You may think I'm joking, but
for all us has-beens, those eight
weeks of intramural competition
are a big deal. And what's sad is
you know I'm not the only one.

You've all been subjected to those
conversations about who's on
which team and who beat whom
and who's going to make the
playoffs.
So if you've had to suffer
through those, let me apologize
right now. We're just has-been ath
letes still chasing that glory you
can only find on the court. Because
no matter how much fun watching
your team can be (or even writing
about it in my case), deep down we
all still dream that we are the ones
who can knock down the clutch
shot or make the dazzling play you
know you'll see that night on
Sports Center.
But let's get away from my piti
ful driveling and back to my plan. I
decided this would be my year in
women's basketball intramurals. I
figured I would need talented play
ers and solid coaching. Then I
remembered this was intramurals
— coaching not necessary. We'd
run the ball and if things ever got
controlled enough to resemble a
halfcourt set, we'd just freelance.
(Was I talking about intramurals
or the NBA?) In any case, coaching
was not essential so the only thing
left was finding players.

As Stanford women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer once
said, "You can't win the Kentucky
Derby on a donkey." Cigar may l>e
infertile, but that horse could run.
I needed players; this is key for any
team. I started with the core group
I'd played with since I was a fresh
man. Unfortunately only three of
us remained — a 5-foot-6 guard, a
6-1 center and myself, a 5-9 wher
ever there's an open spot on the
floor type of player.
Then I secured the participation
of two former college Softball play
ers. I'd played with both before and
knew they liked to run the floor.
My next step was to attract inter
ested players from within my
dorm. (Since Robinson was footing
the bill, I couldn't really leave any
of them out, and I figured I might
even get a good player or two.)
I ended up getting two more
players with height and speed, and
I thought things were looking
good. No Signe Antvorskovs on
this team. So far all of my players
were former high school stars, and
most had played collegiate athletics
of some sort.

My coup, my shining moment of
glory, my "I am the world's great
est recruiter" declaration, came
with the acquisition of two former
Stanford basketball players. One, a
5-4 guard who currently plays soft
ball, had played with me the year
before after walking on to Skin
ford's team and playing for two
years. The other was Kristin Folkl.
Dick Vitale picked her as a presea
son All-American, but Folkl decid
ed not to play, at least not for Stan

ford. "Carpe diem," I said and
snared Folkl for my team.
The first game came, and we
won by 50. I considered retiring
from playing so I could sit back and
watch each game, but playing on a
team with an All-American is too
much fun to pass up. Game two
went just as well, and we appeared
to be cruising toward the title.
But destiny had other ideas.
Softball season kicked into high
gear, and the first of my two for
mer Stanford basketball players
called it an early season. She didn't
want to risk injury during her sea
son, so I said goodbye to our best
ball handler.
But I was optimistic. We still

had Folkl and some other talented
players. Meanwhile the third
ranked Stanford team was saddled
with injuries, and sure enough,
VanDerveer called Folkl and got
her back. Goodbye championship,
goodbye dream, goodbye Folkl.
We finished our season without
a loss but fell in the semifinals by
one point. Interestingly enough we
got off two shots in the final 10 sec
onds that could have won the
game. I was left to wonder what
went wrong? I thought I had it
planned so perfectly.
But don't worry. I'll bounce
back. It's softball season, and I've
still got those former softball play
ers to put on my team. Unfortu

nately I've yet to recruit outside
that sport, and the season is almost
upon us. So if you're an athlete
(particularly some college athlete
and not necessarily one that used
to play Softball), and you think you
want a piece of that intramural tro
phy, call me. (My number's listed,
and Folkl, if you come back, first
base and the cleanup spot in the
order are both yours.)
What am I say? I'm a deranged
has-been who's still seeking athlet
ic glory. Give me a break. And
please, no harassing phone calls.

If you call, don't even think about
asking Robin which squad
derailed her dream.
