# One woman's dream: to win it all
## 
### 
I had the dream. I had a plan
that I meticulously put into
action. My quest, like that of so
many of the athletes who fill these
pages, was for a championship.

We had all the tools — experi
ence, depth, talent, speed, height
and coaching; this was our year.
Now let me take just a minute to
straighten out any confusion and
assure you that I'm not talking
about a measly NCAA champi
onship here. Oh no, this is on a
whole other level. We're talking
intramurals, baby.
You may think I'm joking, but
for all us has-beens, those eight
weeks of intramural competition
are a big deal. And what's sad is
you know I'm not the only one.

You've all been subjected to those
conversations about who's on
which team and who beat whom
and who's going to make the
playoffs.
So if you've had to suffer
through those, let me apologize
right now. We're just has-been ath
letes still chasing that glory you
can only find on the court. Because
no matter how much fun watching
your team can be (or even writing
about it in my case), deep down we
all still dream that we are the ones
who can knock down the clutch
shot or make the dazzling play you
know you'll see that night on
Sports Center.
But let's get away from my piti
ful driveling and back to my plan. I
decided this would be my year in
women's basketball intramurals. I
figured I would need talented play
ers and solid coaching. Then I
remembered this was intramurals
— coaching not necessary. We'd
run the ball and if things ever got
controlled enough to resemble a
halfcourt set, we'd just freelance.
(Was I talking about intramurals
or the NBA?) In any case, coaching
was not essential so the only thing
left was finding players.

As Stanford women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer once
said, "You can't win the Kentucky
Derby on a donkey." Cigar may l>e
infertile, but that horse could run.
I needed players; this is key for any
team. I started with the core group
I'd played with since I was a fresh
man. Unfortunately only three of
us remained — a 5-foot-6 guard, a
6-1 center and myself, a 5-9 wher
ever there's an open spot on the
floor type of player.
Then I secured the participation
of two former college Softball play
ers. I'd played with both before and
knew they liked to run the floor.
My next step was to attract inter
ested players from within my
dorm. (Since Robinson was footing
the bill, I couldn't really leave any
of them out, and I figured I might
even get a good player or two.)
I ended up getting two more
players with height and speed, and
I thought things were looking
good. No Signe Antvorskovs on
this team. So far all of my players
were former high school stars, and
most had played collegiate athletics
of some sort.
