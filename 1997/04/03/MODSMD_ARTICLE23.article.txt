# Looking to advance
## Men's gymnastics goes to regionals 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
It's do or die for the men's gym
nastics team.
All season long the Cardinal has
focused on the big picture, the long
run — the NCAA championship.
Through hours of training and
therapy and workouts, the gym
nasts have known that they had
only one goal in sight.
Now, the Cardinal must leap
one final hurdle to make it to the
championships in lowa. Only the
West Regional competition stands
in the way of the team attaining its
goal.
Three teams will advance to the
NCAA Championships in lowa on
April 17-18. Three teams can keep
Stanford from getting there — No.
2 California, No. 3 Nebraska and
No. 4 Oklahoma.
No. 11 Stanford has faced each
of these top contenders this year
and defeated nary a one. Most
recently, the Cardinal squad com
peted at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Championships
last weekend and fell to all three
plus New Mexico.
It's going to be a tough battle.
Stanford has known all season that
Cal would be the strongest team in
the field, with its dearth of talent.
The teams have gone head to head
six times this season, and each
time Stanford has come up short.
But keeping in step with the mas
ter plan, the Cardinal looks to
knock either Oklahoma or Nebras
ka out for a spot in the top three.
The showdown with Cal need not
come now.
Both Oklahoma and Nebraska
are similar teams, not overly tal
ented but very consistent. Okla
homa placed second to Nebraska at
MPSFs and Cal placed third.
Oklahoma is led by senior Casey
Bryan. The Sooner team was fifth
in the nation after last year's
NCAA tournament but lost only
three routines to graduation.

Bryan is second to Stanford
senior Keith Wiley in the West
Region in the all-around. Wiley
won the all-around last year and
will defend his title this weekend.
Wiley followed up his showing last
year with a second-place finish in
all around at NCAA*?.
Nebraska will also threaten to
keep Stanford out of the hunt for
the title. Wiley said the Nebraska
gymnasts had the "meet of their
season" at MPSFs. The team may
have peaked too early though.
Unlike Nebraska, the Stanford
squad trains to peak at NCAAs; it
is all part of head coach Sadao
Hamada's master plan. Hamada
projects that "it's going to be a dog
fight" for the top three positions.
Hut he counts in his favor that
he will be "taking an entirely dif
ferent team with me this week
end." Hamada's team at MPSFs
which scored its second-lowest
score of the season, was perform
ing without the contributions of
senior Jamie Ellis, senior lan
Bachrach and redshirt freshman
David Ludlow.
Both Ellis and Bachrach are All-
Americans and arc huge additions
to the lineup. Ellis sufl'ers from a
shoulder injury but will see all
around action thus weekend in all
likelihood, Hamada said.
Bachrach, a key performer on
vault and floor, will also return to
the team in full force after seeing
limited action due to a bruised heel
last weekend.
Ludlow was rested because of a
slightly fractured rib, and he will
be back to help out the team at the
regionals.
So, although the Stanford team
may be the underdog, it does hnve
a few tricks up its sleeve. Hamada
said earlier this season, "If there is
one way in a million, I will find it."
Wiley advises to "have faith in
Sadao's plan." It is apparent that
the team has faith in his plan and
has been heavily training to bring
his plan into reality.
