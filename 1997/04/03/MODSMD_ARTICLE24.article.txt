						tribute to Brevin's reign

### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Reflecting back now, the trade
marks are almost too numerous to
list.
First, of course, there was the
number, 22. Then there's the
dark, piercing eyes, the ones he'd
use to glare down opposing point
guards, just before he'd strip them
of the ball and streak downcourt
for an easy layup off the glass.
There was that unmistakable,
laid-back swagger, the one he'd
lull defenders asleep with, just
before zipping past them with a
lightning-quick cut to the hoop.
And don't forget that silky
smooth pull-up jumper â€” and,
when it fell, the crowd-pleasing
shadow-boxing jig that ensued.
The Brevin Knight Era at Stan
ford is history, thanks to the Car
dinal's 82-77 overtime loss to
Utah last month at the West
Regional semifinals in San Jose.
But the senior point guard left
Cardinal fans with memories to
last until well after Knight has
played his final NBA game.
Ten, 20 years down the road,
after Jason and Jarron Collins and
all the other heirs of Stanford bas
ketball have come and gone,
they'll still be talking about the
unsung kid from Jersey who took
a sagging program and almost sin
gle-handedly restored it to nation
al prominence.
Consider this: In 1992-93, the
year before Knight's arrival, Stan
ford finished 7-23 and rock-bot
tom last in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, with an abysmal 2-16 league
mark. Four years later, anything
short of the NCAA tournament's
second round might be called a
disappointment on the Farm.
"I don't think we'd get the
Collins twins to come here if we
didn't make the second round the
last couple of years," said coach
Mike Montgomery.

It's no coincidence that
Knight's four years at Stanford
have coincided with the most pros
perous years in the program's his
tory: four straight postseason

appearances, including three
straight in the NCAAs, and the
school's first-ever Sweet 16 berth.
