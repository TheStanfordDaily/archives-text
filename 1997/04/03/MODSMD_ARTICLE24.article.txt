# A 						tribute to Brevin's reign
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Reflecting back now, the trade
marks are almost too numerous to
list.
First, of course, there was the
number, 22. Then there's the
dark, piercing eyes, the ones he'd
use to glare down opposing point
guards, just before he'd strip them
of the ball and streak downcourt
for an easy layup off the glass.
There was that unmistakable,
laid-back swagger, the one he'd
lull defenders asleep with, just
before zipping past them with a
lightning-quick cut to the hoop.
And don't forget that silky
smooth pull-up jumper — and,
when it fell, the crowd-pleasing
shadow-boxing jig that ensued.
The Brevin Knight Era at Stan
ford is history, thanks to the Car
dinal's 82-77 overtime loss to
Utah last month at the West
Regional semifinals in San Jose.
But the senior point guard left
Cardinal fans with memories to
last until well after Knight has
played his final NBA game.
Ten, 20 years down the road,
after Jason and Jarron Collins and
all the other heirs of Stanford bas
ketball have come and gone,
they'll still be talking about the
unsung kid from Jersey who took
a sagging program and almost sin
gle-handedly restored it to nation
al prominence.
Consider this: In 1992-93, the
year before Knight's arrival, Stan
ford finished 7-23 and rock-bot
tom last in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, with an abysmal 2-16 league
mark. Four years later, anything
short of the NCAA tournament's
second round might be called a
disappointment on the Farm.
"I don't think we'd get the
Collins twins to come here if we
didn't make the second round the
last couple of years," said coach
Mike Montgomery.

It's no coincidence that
Knight's four years at Stanford
have coincided with the most pros
perous years in the program's his
tory: four straight postseason

appearances, including three
straight in the NCAAs, and the
school's first-ever Sweet 16 berth.

Senior Brevin Knight contemplates his next move as he protects the
ball In the Cardinal's second-round upset victory over Wake Forest.
Under his charge, Stanford has
flowered into a bona fide big-time
college basketball program. Those
who think the return of four
starters and the addition of two
blue-chip recruits will compensate
for the loss of Knight next season
are kidding themselves.
His tale has been retold so often
that it's become cliched: top pro
grams overlook scrawny, 5-foot-8,
148-pound high school star, who
lands across the coast at the only
major-conference school that
would recruit him — one known
better for producing biologists
than basketball players — then
unexpectedly wins the starting job
as a freshman.
Now, four years later, the acco
lades spill from Knight's resume
in bunches. Second-team All-
American (he was the sixth vote
getter and first among guards),

Wooden Award candidate, Nai
smith Award candidate, school
record holder in assists and steals
(and second and fourth, respec
tively, on the Pac-10 career lists)
and on and on.
As Montgomery said before
Stanford's game against Utah,
"There's only one Brevin."
Knight's dazzling play this
postseason was gratuitous, having
already established himself as one
of the most gifted point guards in
the country over the past four
years, both at Stanford and as the
leader of the U.S. 22-and-under
team that almost upset the Dream
Team last summer. His tourna
ment numbers — 24 assists and
just two turnovers in three games
— only affirmed Knight's mastery
over the college game.
Against Utah, Knight took a
sputtering Stanford team, strapped
it on to his back, and refused to let
it quit. With the offense jittery and
off-the-mark — looking like a
squad in awe of the big time —
Knight decided to impose his will

on the game as only he can.
Wheeling and slashing, dancing
and darting, Knight ran circles
around the Running Utes in the
second half, pulling Stanford from
the depths of a 14-point deficit and
then forcing overtime with his
last-second, double-pump three
point prayer — all with four fouls.
"It was a nightmare for me,"
said Utah point guard Andre
Miller. "He gets a step on you, and
he's gone. There's not really any
thing you can do against him."
And so it is with a tear in its eye
and a pat on the back that Stanford
sends ofT Knight to pursue NBA
fame and riches. He will likely be
the first point guard taken in the
draft and could go in the lottery.
Without Brevin, the Cardinal
will be left to feel its way through
a new and uncertain future next
season. Point-guard duties will fall
to sophomore Arthur Ijee — who
spent the vast mtyority of his time
this season at the two-guard —
with possible relief from incoming
freshman Mike McDonald.

"I don't think that the players
on our basketball team realize how
much Brevin has meant to their
success," Montgomery said after
the Utah loss. "He just brings
everybody up a level. We're going
to have to do things so much bet
ter, so much differently next year.
"We got to a place we've never
been before, and this little guy
down at the end of the table got us
there," he said, motioning to
Knight. "He's something. A very,
very special player."
Special, indeed. After Stan
ford's second-round upset of Wake
Forest, radio broadcaster John
Platz remarked that Knight is
"the kind of player you write poet
ry about." Well, poetiy is outside
the scope of this writer's reper
toire, but I can say this:
Brevin, you will be missed in
both body and spirit — both on the
court and off. On behalf of Stan
ford and the entire Bay Area,
thank you for an exhilarating four
years.
And to all, a good Knight.
