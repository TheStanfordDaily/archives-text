History Prof. Emeritus Don Fehrenbacher has
been selected as a recipient of the 1997 Lincoln Prize,
the nation's highest annual award for Civil War stud
ies.
The award, given by the Lincoln and Soldiers In
stitute at Gettysburg College, recognizes Fehren
bacher's lifetime of achievement in Civil War Studies.
His research is centered on the causes of the civil
war but also includes American constitutional histo
ry.
"This prize is recognition for lifetime achievement
and recognition for the books I have published. It's
the crowning achievement of half a century of work in
history," Fehrenbacher said.
Fehrenbacher won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977 for his
book, "The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in Amer
ican Law and Politics."
Another of his books, "Prelude to Greatness: Lin
coln in the 1850s," and his newly published "The Rec

ollected Words of Abraham Lincoln " were also noted
as outstanding works that contribute to Lincoln
scholarship.
History Prof. George Fredrickson called Fehren
bacher "one of the two leading Lincoln scholars in the
country," adding that he couldn't imagine a more de
serving candidate.
Fehrenbacher, who taught at Stanford from 1953
to 1984, will receive a prize of $50,000 and a bust of
Lincoln for his achievement. He was selected for the
prize from more than 80 other entries.
Fehrenbacher is currently studying the relation
ship between the United States government and slav
ery.
His other achievements include the completion of
a book begun by David Potter, "The Impending Cri
sis, 1848-1861," which also won a Pulitzer Prize.
The Lincoln Prize has been awarded annually
since 1991, and previous recipients of the prize in
clude filmmaker Ken Burns, the National Archives
and Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald.
