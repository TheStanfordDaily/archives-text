## Topics include cloning Stanford and banning the bomb

As part of a celebration of the relationship between
the Bay Area and Britain, Stanford students had a
unique opportunity to participate in an engaging debate
with students from Oxford and Cambridge Universities
last night in Tresidder Union's Oak Room.
Beginning with a light debate on whether or not
Stanford should be cloned, freshman Matt Spence of the
Stanford Debate Society argued that "the greatness of
Stanford could be spread across the world."
The debate quickly switched gears, however, to dis
cuss the more serious issue of the role of nuclear
weapons in the 21st century.
Arguing that the atomic bomb should be banned
from all countries, Stanford's debate team presented an
array of arguments both idealistic and realistic.
Arguments in favor of banning nuclear weapons
ranged from the need to promote democracy to the
change in the nature of warfare.
Using an elegant, logical style, the British team de
bated in favor of keeping nuclear weaponry.
Reasons to maintain such weapons as the nuclear
bomb included the hope of preventing small conflicts
from snowballing to the logistical impracticalities of dis
arming countries.
Stanford doctoral student Kevin Harrington said, "If
we want to see democracy spread throughout the world,
we can't put power in the hands of a few."
The British team put forth a series of well-structured

arguments against these views.
Sarah Raines of Cambridge rhetorically asked, "How
do you disarm countries that don't acknowledge they
have nuclear weapons?"
The British team stressed that distrust of other
countries and right-wing extremists would always point
in favor of maintaining nuclear weapons.
Sam Gyiamah, an Oxford student, said he was disap
pointed in the lack of facts he heard from the Stanford
team. He argued that countries need to be prepared for
the worst.
"If you want peace, you prepare for war. It's sad but
true," Gyiamah said. "Someone out there, somewhere,
will try something stupid."
In the end, the audience's applause indicated that
the British team had won the debate.
Oxford's lan MacMullen, who participated in the
first humorous debate regarding the cloning of Stan
ford, said the debate was enjoyable.
With regard to the Stanford team, MacMullen said
he thought the team was "stylistically very good and
rhetorically nice but fluffy."
The Office of Student Activities played an active role
in planning the debate, and Director Nanci Howe said
she thought the evening was "great fun.
"It was nice to see Stanford students debating on
campus," Howe said. "It's interesting to see how differ
ent teams meld debate traditions."
The debate was part of "Britain meets the Bay," a
festival designed to foster cultural and educational ties
between Great Britain and the Bay Area.
