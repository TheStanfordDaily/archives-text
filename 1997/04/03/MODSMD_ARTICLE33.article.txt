THEATER
THUR • 3 - SAT • 5
Catch "Out of Focus," a new play by An-

gela Goodsell. The play targets the
younger generation of playgoers with its
intimate look at four men and women in

themselves and others at a time when their
lives and connections are painfully out of
focus. The director and actors create a set
ting that immerses the playgoer in the
emotional milieu of the emerging adult
generation. Goodsell's minimalist use of
language underlines the emotional isola
tion of her characters and the tenacity of
their efforts to reach each other. The per
formance is at 8 p.m. at the Burgess The
ater, 601 Laurel Street, Menlo Park, be
tween Willow Road and Ravenswood Av
enue. Tickets are $8. For tickets and infor

A sellout at last fall's Solo Mio Festival,
David Sedaris returns with readings from

Christmas elf trapped in a world of lech
erous Santas, vomiting tots and cruel
parents. He both celebrates and skewers
contemporary United States culture. A
question-and-answer session follows this
reading of some of his favorite pieces,
many too "steamy" for NPR. Tickets are
$ 1 4; call 392-4400 to order. The show is
at 7:30 p.m. the Cowell Theater,
Buchanan Street at Marina Boulevard in
San Francisco. Call 626-6422 for de

MONOLOGUES
FRI *4 and SAT*S
Two shades of Gray, both provocative, in
truguing and splendidly Spalding. He's the
conscience of our generation, the voice of
our insight, the one-man army of story
telling genuis, weaving his way into our in
tellect with his irreverent wit and unforget
table personality. Join Spalding Gray, au
thor, speaker and movie star, for two dif
ferent performances: "It's a Slippery
Slope," the hilarious tale of learning to ski
after 40; and "Gray on Gray or Everything
Reminds Me of Something," the monolo
gist's monologue where you get to submit
the material. See one, see both, but get
your tickets fast — Gray is hot this year!
Spalding Gray performs "It's a Slippery
Slope" Friday at 8 p.m. and "Gray on
Gray or Everything Reminds Me of Some
thing" Saturday at 8 p.m., both in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. Call 725-ARTS for ticket
information.
