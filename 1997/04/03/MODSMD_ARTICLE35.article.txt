## When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth 
### FERNANDA EBERSTADT 
Book Review

Imagine, if you will, an extremely upper-crust,
art-collecting family called the Geblers, in New
York in the 1980s. Of course, Mr. Gebler married
Mrs. Gehler for her money. Of course, Mrs. Gebler
actually runs the art gallery (called "Aurora") and
has a strange love for dull, lifeless paintings and
drawings. Of course, Mr. Gebler is full of 7.est and
lust, has had several affairs and thinks all of Mrs.
Geblers fave art is for shit. Add two beautiful, fe
cund daughters and a butterball son, and you get
the point: rich family.
Enter Isaac, a beautiful brawny male from the
New Hampshire boonies with a new outlook on life
and love and religion that turns the family upside
down. What begins as a sort of mutual hatred be
tween the Geblers and Isaac ends up as an intense
love disguised as an intense hatred, and then the
book ends. Sounds pretty bad, huh?

But it's not.
Eberstadt's writing style is a sort of combination be
tween a novice high-literature fiction writer and Tom
Robbins. With her seemingly vast pits of information
about New York, 80s culture (including the effect of AIDS
on the art world), world history, painting and the Bible,
she draws you into her story and teaches you a great deal
about what may very well be her personal world view. The
process is rather slow but it's worth it.

Every now and then Eberstadt pulls out
poignant observations that are right on:
"One of the annoying rules of social inter
course: Whatever it was you were dying to
do or find out was precisely the thing that
was forbidden." Or, "She was so young, Isaac
realized, that she was trying to make
grownup conversation with him." Or (my
favorite), "Gebler felt obscurely piqued, the
way you do when hearing that even some
one you don't much like is happily entan
gled with someone who isn't you."
There is no room for being lost in Eber
stadt's world. It's too well-drawn and too ac
curate.
There is a down side, though. The novel is
entirely too long. The plot doesn't have the
obsessive quality to it that makes a reader
forego necessary surgery in order to finish
reading it. The ends don't all tie up, and it's
hard to defend a recreational book of such
length (404 pages) if the length can't be jus
tified in the text somewhere. OK, Steven

King is pretty long but when you are done reading King
you feel like you've just lived an epic. When I finished read
ing "When the Sons," I felt like I'd come to the end of an
other chapter. The book feels unfinished.

If you simply must read
"When the Soils ol I le.iv
en Meet the Daughters of
the Earth," don't go into it
with any expectations. It's
an in-between book. It's
at the exact midpoint be
tween airport novel ease
of reading and English
class, social commentary,
interesting witticism lil
erature ease of reading.
So ultimately the deci
sion is yours. I)o you like
and remember the 80s?
Do you remember the
(iulf War? I >o you know
New York pretty well? I )o
you know anyone I torn
New Hampshire? And
(most important) do you
have loads of free time?
Do you like Tom Rob

bins? If you have answered yes to these questions, this may
well he the book for you to net a eyeful of before the quar
ter starts getting too hard.
