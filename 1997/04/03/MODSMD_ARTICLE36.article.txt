# Warning!
## WILD IMPROV COMICS RETURN TO THEIR HOME ZOO 
### 
The L.A.-
based But
Franklies,
composed
entirely of
Stanford
alums,
perform
this
weekend

ne tiling about sketcn comedy is
that some people just have to do it,
regardless of lack ot pay, a time
crunch or the inconvenience of day jobs.
Take the eight men and three women
in the Los Angeles-based comedy group
But Franklies, for example. Most of them
are aspiring actors and writers, and in
February 1996 they officially started
doing improv in places like the Upfront
Comedy Theater in Santa Monica, Calif.
They .ire now coming home to Stanford
for a show, performing in the Little The
ater tomorrow.
The But franklies are all Stanford
alumni who graduated between 1992 and
1995, and their shows are part improv,
part sketch comedy and part a cappella.
The actors bring to Stanford some of their
favorite routines, such as improvised
Shakespeare, an improvised musical and
other long-form narrative scenes and fun,
short hoop games.
Most of the members of the group
were active in improv at Stanford, as
part of either the Drama Department's
SIMPS (Stanford Improvisors) or Ram's
Head's Sponge (Spontaneous Genera
tion).
The men of the group sang a cappel
la at Stanford, in either Fleet Street or
the Mendicants, where they got a
chance not only to hone their vocal
skills but to develop their comic timing

in various
sketches they
would write
and perform
for the shows.
As big fans
of Saturday
Night Live and
SCTV (Second
City's short
lived TV
show), the but
Franklies see
their "sensibil
ity as a little bit
more toward
the conven
tional sketch
comedy show"
than improv
per se, accord
ing to produc
er Jason May
land, Class of

1994. The lack of a forum for sketch com
edy at Stanford was an impetus for start
ing the group.
"Looking back, it would've been great
to have had something like a weekly
sketch comedy show at Stanford," said
Mayland.
But even more important than that
was the shock of graduating and no
longer being able to perform for large .111

diences.
"Stanford has so many
outlets to perform, as well
as the benefit of a built-in
audience," said May land.
"When you get out in the
LA. world, you're in a vacu
um. So this is a nice way tor
us to develop our comic
sensibility and see what
works and what doesn't."
As more Stanford gradu
ates moved to Los Angeles to
try their luck in film or televi
sion during the past two
years, Mayland thought it
would be a waste not to orga
nize these "talented, multi
faceted performers" into a

comedy troupe.
Encouraged hv the Groundlings, a
well-known improv group in Los Ange
les, the But Franklies already have ambi
tions for making an impact on the South
ern California comedy scene.
One distinction is the But Franklies'
choice of doing the tougher, riskier full
length narrative scenes that some groups
avoid.
"A lot of the improv done in LA is not
as risks' as what we like to do," said May
land. "A lot of these comedy groups are
afraid of doing improv and afraid that au
diences will be bored. It's scary to do a
full-length story that's improvised, so we
feel that we have something to contribute
to the I .A. comedy scene." B
