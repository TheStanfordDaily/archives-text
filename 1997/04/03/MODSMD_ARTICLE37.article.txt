## The 						Royal Family take a bow at the A.L.T.

s the curtain rises on a posh apartment, the brief interval before the telephone rings is virtually the only
time of peace and quiet in the entire play. From the moment the housekeeper and butler rush onstage to
v receive the endless stream of guests, deliver packages, answer phones and doorbells, serve cocktails
112 and attend to the extravagant lifestyle of the renowned Cavendish family, the frenzied atmosphere
never relaxes and the action never stops.

From the actresses' elegant velvet gowns to the feath
ered open-heeled sandals, the audience's attention is
captivated not only by superb acting but by the glam
orous images as well.
Set in the late 1920s in Manhattan, the American Con
servatory Theater's "The Royal Family" depicts three
generations of a celebrated New York family of actors:
matriarch Fanny Cavendish (DeAnn Mears); her daugh
ter, Julie (Valerie Leonard); and her teenage grand
daughter, Gwen (Elizabeth Eidenberg).
The play, directed by Albert Takazauckas, is based on
the real-life, legendary acting family, the Barrymores.
The glamorous lives that the Barrymores led were dis
played daily across newspaper headlines in the 19205.
The title of the play comes from the sibling triumvirate
of Lionel, Ethel and John, who were dubbed "the royal
family of the theater" by the press.
The story line is straightforward. At the start of the
play, Fanny is ready to defy the limitations of her old
age and begin a new production. Julie is a well-estab
lished star in the theater when she is revisited by Gilbert
Marshall, an old lover who has become a millionaire.
Gwen is torn between the demands of her stockbroker
fiance, Perry Stewart, and her own budding acting ca
reer.
Julie's brother, Tony (Aloysius Gigl), complicates mat
ters when he abruptly arrives from 1 lollywood after hav
ing lost his temper and punched his director. During his
one-night stay at the Cavendish apartment before his es
cape to Europe, he wreaks havoc on the rest of the fami
ly with his rowdy and self-centered behavior. The other
Cavendishes must even run a gauntlet of reporters before
entering their own home.
Meanwhile, Perry has threatened to leave Julie be
cause he is convinced that their marriage will never work
if she continues to have a full-time acting career. Julie
laments the struggle of her situation, declaring, "1 don't
want to be a Cavendish. I want to be a human being."
"The Royal Family" is the result of a prolific collabo
ration between playwright George Kaufman and novelist
Edna Ferber. Kaufman, who produced more than 40 mu
sicals and plays in his lifetime, wrote only one original
play, "The Butter and Egg Man," by himself. Of the Ift
collaborators with whom he co-wrote most of his works,
only two were women. Kaufman had a lot of respect and
high regard for Ferber and the great success they
achieved with the six plays they finished together, saying,
she "wrote like a man."
Although Kaufman and Ferber denied using the Bar
rymores as their sole inspiration, they did admit that the
character of Tony Cavendish was based on that of John
Barrymore. In the production notes of the play, Ferber
said, "We only used bits and pieces of him, though. He
was much too improbable to copy from life."

Interestingly, both Kaufman and Ferher hoped Ethel
and John Barrymore would play the lead roles and sent
the first two manuscripts to them. They were shocked at
the response they got. Not only did Ethel refuse the part
of Julie, but she called a prominent lawyer to obtain an
injunction which would prohibit the production of the
play. Advised that her suit was too weak, Ethel severed all
relations with the two playwrights whom she had known
for years.
Although both the positive and negative aspects of an
acting career are highlighted in the play, Ethel did have
many reasons to be unhappy with the script. The
Cavendishes arc depicted as obsessive and callous, and
the entire play verges on melodrama because the charac
ters are so exaggerated. The dialogue and action never
stop, giving an excellent impression of people whose
lives are spent in a whirlwind of events and errands. At
the same time, two hours of watching what is virtually

one great (lurry can be taxing.
"The Royal Family" has the elements of both a come
dy and tragedy. The quick wit and sarcasm Â«>t Fanny
Cavendish gives the play a twisl of humor that stands in
contrast to the more serious moments. There is an un
derlying sense throughout the play that the Cavendishes
are so absorbed with acting that they forget to stop when
they are off the stage. Thus, the twist of the story is that
it is difficult to tell when anyone is being serious or sim
ply treating real life as part of the theater.
The real sadness in the play lies in realizing how much
the female Cavendishes have had to sacrifice (or acting.
Although they have alienated themselves from their bus
bands and lovers, although they have become so nies
merized by the stage th;it they have losi touch with the
rest of the world, they can never break away from their
heart's obsession: the theater. II
