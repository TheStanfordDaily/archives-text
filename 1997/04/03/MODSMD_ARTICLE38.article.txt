# Behind the doors of Stanfords hallowed halls Lurks...
## PUNK 
### 
Punk and Stanford — huh?
Believe it or not, those two words haven't al
ways seemed so mutually exclusive. Ten years ago,
the space now occupied by The Edge housed a
well-known punk club, attracting bands like Bad
Brains and Seven Seconds. Palo Alto supported a
small scene of its own: Local bands could play at the
Varsity Theater (now Borders Bookstore) and other venues
around town.
Stanford was part of this ferment as well — the infamous
Descendants once played a Stanford frat party.
More recently, Stanford produced Mindslam (a.k.a. Cain),
which metamorphosed from a freshman-year noise band in
the early '90s to a polished punk group that self-produced a
CD that got favorable reviews in national fanzines and was
played on Live 105.
Although the band's recent appearance on an Epitaph
Records compilation with nationally known bands appears to
have been its final recording, the legacy lives on, if only in the
upside-down-flag "Unamerican" stickers manufactured by
Stanford alumnus Srini Kumar, Class of 1 993, the band's
frontman.

Mindslam was an anomaly, though, and its failure to find
lasting success may in part be due to Palo Alto's nature. The
tapid gentrification of downtown Palo Alto erased virtually
every trace of its once-vibrant punk scene.
Most people don't think of today's downtown as a hotbed
for punk rock. At a school where bands that play original
music are outnumbered by a cappella groups two-to-one,
most punk fans long ago accepted their unpleasant choice: Ei
ther make the long trip to San Francisco or limit their involve
ment in punk to listening to CDs and surfing Internet groups.
Things may not be that bleak, though.
Admittedly, the Palo Alto area can't compete with the musi
cal ferment that goes on in other areas around the Bay
sorry, sports fans, but this is one place where the Weenies re-

ally have us beat.
But things might now be
chanaina. The kids have al

— — - —
ways been here — isolated, maybe, but hanging in there
nonetheless. People are working to bring Stanford's punks
and punk fans together into a community.
Here are just a few of these people. They are DJs, musi
cians, producers, high school students. Their musical tastes
run the gamut of "punk" subgenres from Green Day to Bikini
Kill to Earth Crisis. But they all share a common passion for
their music and a common desire to embrace that passion a
little closer to home.
ANDY
Andy Radin, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major,
didn't know much about punk when he came to Stanford in
1 992. Although he heard a few things as a freshman — his
first show was Green Day playing Gilman Street and he hails
their first album as the "soundtrack to my freshman year" — it
wasn't until the next summer that his interest really started to
blossom.
Sophomore year, he moved into the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest and started hanging out at KZSU, where he discovered
the passionate, aggressive punk subgenre known as hardcore
characterized by bands like Torches to Rome, Up Front and
Heroin.
"My normal Stanford experience basically ended freshman
year," Radin said, "which is OK with me because I hated it."
Radin started taking DJ classes at KZSU and going to
shows, but pursuing his newfound interests wasn't easy.
"Stanford's a long way from San Francisco and Berkeley,"
he said, "so for 2 1 /2 years I spent almost every single week
end trying to borrow a car from somebody or taking the 7F
and spending all day getting to the city."
These trips were often lonely at that point, according to
Radin, "out of 14,000 people at Stanford, maybe five" had
music tastes similar to his.
Once Green Day hit the mainstream, that changed. With
each new class, he said, there's more interest in punk rock and
hardcore. There's a growing scene of people willing to listen
to a wider variety of music, seek out "different stuff."
But the bottom line is still the same, he said interest in in
dependent, original music is low at Stanford and most people
continue to ignore KZSU and its eclectic programming.
Because of this, Radin leads a double life: a Stanford social
life and a life outside campus centered around shows, bands
and the Bay Area straightedge and hardcore scenes.
"Every time I go to a show there are friends of mine there,"
he said people from a wide variety of backgrounds and with
a completely different lifestyle than his Stanford friends.
But these two spheres have overlapped in a strange way.
Thanks to a little-known high-tech recording studio on the
Stanford campus, Radin has been able to offer several hard
core bands top-quality recording sessions at no cost.
Located in the Knoll, the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics, or CCRMA, is a division of the Music De
partment intended primarily for creating experimental com
puter music. The studio, however, is open for student use
after taking a series of training classes, students can sign up for
recording times.
Radin learned about the studio through his friendship with
members of Mindslam. He sat in at a few Mindslam recording
sessions and then began approaching bands on his own. To
date, he's recorded with three Bay Area hardcore bands and
is scheduled to work with two more.

Still, Radin laments the lack of
hardcore music at Stanford.
"There really hasn't been a band
in recent years that is serious about
what it is," he said. "I'd like to see
a band that thought what it was
doing was important."
He wishes Stanford had bands
that pursued music more seriously ir

the world beyond Palm Drive.
Until this changes, Radin considers the possibility of a real
Stanford scene — a vibrant community of bands producing ex
citing, original music — little more than a dream. For most peo
ple at Stanford, Radin said, music is mostly background noise,
a soundtrack to dance to on Friday nights but not much else.
Yet he still has hope. "All there needs to be is some band

who's pretty good
and good at get
ting people to
come, who gets a
following and
then inspires that
following to start
their own bands,"
he said.
WENDY
Freshman
Wendy Yao doesn't

take her music as seriously as Radin does, but she's no less
passionate about it. Although she's very modest about it, her
roots in punk rock are deep she's been listening to it since
she was 13.
"I lived in this town that was really boring," Yao said, "so we
listened to music."
With her sister and her best friend, she started a band be
fore she was old enough to drive.
"We never really practiced or anything," she said. "Our
parents wouldn't let us be in a band so we had to say we were
doing these insane study sessions instead of saying that we
were going to play."
So the band Emily's Sassy Lime — didn't play very much.
They did a few shows and parties, mostly for their close friends.
However, they've put out a few seven-inch vinyl singles and are
currently on Kill Rock Stars, an indie label based in Olympia,
Wash. Through Kill Rock Stars, Yao has become friends with
bands all along the West Coast and regularly tours with some
of them as a roadie.
Yao didn't expect to find much of an audience here.
"I was expecting to be a hermit when I came here. I kind of
didn't think there would be that many punks here I thought
I'd just hang out with other friends I had in other places," Yao
said.
Perhaps because of these low expectations, she was pleas
antly surprised to find that there are, in fact, quite a few peo
ple at Stanford with an interest in punk rock.
But despite a few kids with similar tastes there wasn't a
scene, no cohesive, creative group generating music. "At
Stanford, people aren't connected in that way," she said. "In
other places everyone kind of knows each other and everyone
supports each other."
Like Radin, Yao's search for this kind of community has

brought her to KZSU. She's met a lot of people at the station,
but few of them are actually Stanford students. Yao said that at
times the lack of a scene at Stanford can be discouraging.
"It's kind of sad but sometimes I sit in my room and i get these
ideas for something really fun we can do here, but then I'm like,
Wait, who am I gonna do it with? Never mind.' It would be a
beautiful thing to have an outlet for punk ideas at Stanford."

Yao's doing more than just talking about this: She's sched
led a Kill Rock Stars band called The Need to play in White
• laza at noon on April 1 6. Although this may not turn Stanford
ito a punk mecca overnight, she's excited to be starting
something. She's also tried other things to bring Stanford's
'scoundrels" out of their caves — a film she showed earlier
this year at the Coffee House succeeded in drawing a fair
number of people.
Even if these events don't bring major crowds, Yao finds it
'nportant to introduce them to Stanford.
This idea is important to Yao, who is upset by what she sees
as a lack of choice at Stanford. She likes the idea of a space
apart, a refuge from Stanford's overwhelming "normal-ness."

Can it happen?
"I don't know," said Yao, "because I don't
know this school very well, but if people would
hang out with each other more, maybe they
could set something up."
Currently, she's working on bringing more
bands to campus and trying to set up a few
more film showings. She encourages interested
people to contact her at wyao(c£>leland. Stan
ford, edu.
PETE
Sophomore Pete Solderitsch's room is kind of
a surprise in the austere, motel-like environ
ment of Mirlo's first floor: With all the bare white
walls around, you don't expect such a sudden
riot of punk show flyers, band posters and other
pop-punk memorabilia.

The room's difference from its neighbors is more than aes
thetic. If Stanford's punk community can be characterized by
isolated individuals alone in a sea of "normalcy," Solderitsch
typifies that isolation. Although he plays guitar with a band
back home on the East Coast, his involvement with punk rock
in California has been almost nonexistent.
Solderitsch got into punk as a junior in high school, |ust a
few weeks before Green Day released its mapr-label debut
and catapulted pop-punk into the mainstream. His band,
the Pushovers, got together for a high school Battle of the
Bands and enjoyed it enough that they're still together, even
though the bandmates are dispersed across the country. The
Pushovers have a track on a CD compilation, and more
compilations and a seven-inch are in the works.
When he got to Stanford, Solderitsch was hoping that he'd
be able to continue his exploration of the punk scene. But he
was disappointed.
"I figured I'd meet more people with similar music tastes,"
he said, "but it hasn't really happened."
Solderitsch hasn't done much with punk since he's been al
Stanford; he's only been to three shows since arriving on cam
pus.
Without a car or friends to accompany him to shows, staying
in touch with Bay Area punk is a difficult task. Unable to visi
record stores in San Francisco with any regularity, tie gets his
punk fix by hitting Tower Records and buying a few punk fanzines
or whatever happens to be available by the bands he likes.
Solderitsch is philosophical about his failure to find a punk
rock niche at Stanford but said it still annoys him.
"It's especially interesting to talk to my friends from the
band, because they're having a very, very different college ex
perience than I am," he said. "It's not that this makes me dis
like my experience at Stanford per se It's more like a 'what if'
situation "

Me s excited by the idea ot a scene
at Stanford. "All it would take is one or two
people who know a lot of other people
and are willing and able to put on a show
or two."
S.U.C.K., DEBRA, THE SMELTS
It's 9 p.m. on the Wednesday of fi
nals week, but the Smelts "Stanford's
first all-girl punk band" are in the mid
dle of a vigorous rehearsal in the Terra
woodshed. They've only been together
for a few weeks and are still working on
pulling everything together, but it's obvi
ous that the band, composed of seniors
Erin Graves and Amy Parris and 1 6-year
old Debra Rolph, is enjoying itself
The catalyst for the birth of the
Smelts was KZSU: Parris and Rolph, both

DJs, met at the station. Graves answered a flyer Parris put up,
and a future legend maybe was born. Tonight's re
hearsal is especially strenuous the band's public debut
would be that Friday.
S.U.C.K., or Sub Urban Conspiracy Kids, is Rolph's brain
child, conceived on a long bus ride back from San Francisco
when she finally got fed up with the lack of punk activities in
the Palo Alto area.
Rolph created S.U.C.K to bring people together, organi/
ing shows, yard sales, art exhibits and other activities.
Rolph said she welcomes Stanford students' participation in
S.U.C.K. KZSU is the connection It's really the only way Stan
ford students and Palo Alto kids with similar music interests are
able to meet each other, she said
So far, Rolph is encouraged by S.U.C.K.'s success. Ihe fust
three meetings have been attended by as many as 30 people
Ultimately, she hopes S.U.C.K will lie able to rent a ware
house and put on all-ages, nonprofit shows modeled after the
ones at Berkeley's famous Oilman Street
EPILOGUE
Ihe lirsl S.U.C.K show was March 21 at E Bf, and accord
ing to those who attended it was a success
The bands ranged Irom bad herd rock to guitar noise to
emotional hardcore and varied widely as far as talent was
concerned. About 60 people showed up surprisingly high
attendance (or an under-promoted punk show on the last
night of finals week.
S.U.C.K sold bread and cookies in the back and made
enough money to pay some of the band;. Despite; the loud
music, the cops didn't show up All in all, it was a good hi■
ginning and a possible watershed moment for Stanford's punk
scene.
Of course, there are still obstacles to punk's success here
Ihe most dire one is the unsure fate of KZSU Ihe radio sta
tion lost its ASSU special fee last year and may not be able to
make it through another year without that funding
"Hopefully," said Rolph, "enough people will recognize
KZSU's value before it's too late."
Still, things seem to be looking up for Stanford's punk
scene There are more exr iterj, interested people around than
ever before, and it seems like they're finally ready to stop talk
ing and start acting. Tfie rritiral mass may finally fx; there,
and, like Solderitsch said, it might only take one or two peo
pie actively setting up shows to really get things going
Who knows maybe the I will get a chant e
to play Stanford again someday |V

Andy Radin has recorded three Bay Area hardcore bands at CCRMA.
Punk and Stanford — huh?
Believe it or not, those two words haven't al
ways seemed so mutually exclusive. Ten years ago,
the space now occupied by The Edge housed a
well-known punk club, attracting bands like Bad
Brains and Seven Seconds. Palo Alto supported a
small scene of its own: Local bands could play at the
Varsity Theater (now Borders Bookstore) and other venues
around town.
Stanford was part of this ferment as well — the infamous
Descendants once played a Stanford frat party.
More recently, Stanford produced Mindslam (a.k.a. Cain),
which metamorphosed from a freshman-year noise band in
the early '90s to a polished punk group that self-produced a
CD that got favorable reviews in national fanzines and was
played on Live 105.
Although the band's recent appearance on an Epitaph
Records compilation with nationally known bands appears to
have been its final recording, the legacy lives on, if only in the
upside-down-flag "Unamerican" stickers manufactured by
Stanford alumnus Srini Kumar, Class of 1 993, the band's
frontman.

Mindslam was an anomaly, though, and its failure to find
lasting success may in part be due to Palo Alto's nature. The
tapid gentrification of downtown Palo Alto erased virtually
every trace of its once-vibrant punk scene.
Most people don't think of today's downtown as a hotbed
for punk rock. At a school where bands that play original
music are outnumbered by a cappella groups two-to-one,
most punk fans long ago accepted their unpleasant choice: Ei
ther make the long trip to San Francisco or limit their involve
ment in punk to listening to CDs and surfing Internet groups.
Things may not be that bleak, though.
Admittedly, the Palo Alto area can't compete with the musi
cal ferment that goes on in other areas around the Bay
sorry, sports fans, but this is one place where the Weenies re-

ally have us beat.
But things might now be
chanaina. The kids have al

— — - —
ways been here — isolated, maybe, but hanging in there
nonetheless. People are working to bring Stanford's punks
and punk fans together into a community.
Here are just a few of these people. They are DJs, musi
cians, producers, high school students. Their musical tastes
run the gamut of "punk" subgenres from Green Day to Bikini
Kill to Earth Crisis. But they all share a common passion for
their music and a common desire to embrace that passion a
little closer to home.
ANDY
Andy Radin, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major,
didn't know much about punk when he came to Stanford in
1 992. Although he heard a few things as a freshman — his
first show was Green Day playing Gilman Street and he hails
their first album as the "soundtrack to my freshman year" — it
wasn't until the next summer that his interest really started to
blossom.
Sophomore year, he moved into the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest and started hanging out at KZSU, where he discovered
the passionate, aggressive punk subgenre known as hardcore
characterized by bands like Torches to Rome, Up Front and
Heroin.
"My normal Stanford experience basically ended freshman
year," Radin said, "which is OK with me because I hated it."
Radin started taking DJ classes at KZSU and going to
shows, but pursuing his newfound interests wasn't easy.
"Stanford's a long way from San Francisco and Berkeley,"
he said, "so for 2 1 /2 years I spent almost every single week
end trying to borrow a car from somebody or taking the 7F
and spending all day getting to the city."
These trips were often lonely at that point, according to
Radin, "out of 14,000 people at Stanford, maybe five" had
music tastes similar to his.
Once Green Day hit the mainstream, that changed. With
each new class, he said, there's more interest in punk rock and
hardcore. There's a growing scene of people willing to listen
to a wider variety of music, seek out "different stuff."
But the bottom line is still the same, he said interest in in
dependent, original music is low at Stanford and most people
continue to ignore KZSU and its eclectic programming.
Because of this, Radin leads a double life: a Stanford social
life and a life outside campus centered around shows, bands
and the Bay Area straightedge and hardcore scenes.
"Every time I go to a show there are friends of mine there,"
he said people from a wide variety of backgrounds and with
a completely different lifestyle than his Stanford friends.
But these two spheres have overlapped in a strange way.
Thanks to a little-known high-tech recording studio on the
Stanford campus, Radin has been able to offer several hard
core bands top-quality recording sessions at no cost.
Located in the Knoll, the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics, or CCRMA, is a division of the Music De
partment intended primarily for creating experimental com
puter music. The studio, however, is open for student use
after taking a series of training classes, students can sign up for
recording times.
Radin learned about the studio through his friendship with
members of Mindslam. He sat in at a few Mindslam recording
sessions and then began approaching bands on his own. To
date, he's recorded with three Bay Area hardcore bands and
is scheduled to work with two more.

Still, Radin laments the lack of
hardcore music at Stanford.
"There really hasn't been a band
in recent years that is serious about
what it is," he said. "I'd like to see
a band that thought what it was
doing was important."
He wishes Stanford had bands
that pursued music more seriously ir

the world beyond Palm Drive.
Until this changes, Radin considers the possibility of a real
Stanford scene — a vibrant community of bands producing ex
citing, original music — little more than a dream. For most peo
ple at Stanford, Radin said, music is mostly background noise,
a soundtrack to dance to on Friday nights but not much else.
Yet he still has hope. "All there needs to be is some band

who's pretty good
and good at get
ting people to
come, who gets a
following and
then inspires that
following to start
their own bands,"
he said.
WENDY
Freshman
Wendy Yao doesn't

take her music as seriously as Radin does, but she's no less
passionate about it. Although she's very modest about it, her
roots in punk rock are deep she's been listening to it since
she was 13.
"I lived in this town that was really boring," Yao said, "so we
listened to music."
With her sister and her best friend, she started a band be
fore she was old enough to drive.
"We never really practiced or anything," she said. "Our
parents wouldn't let us be in a band so we had to say we were
doing these insane study sessions instead of saying that we
were going to play."
So the band Emily's Sassy Lime — didn't play very much.
They did a few shows and parties, mostly for their close friends.
However, they've put out a few seven-inch vinyl singles and are
currently on Kill Rock Stars, an indie label based in Olympia,
Wash. Through Kill Rock Stars, Yao has become friends with
bands all along the West Coast and regularly tours with some
of them as a roadie.
Yao didn't expect to find much of an audience here.
"I was expecting to be a hermit when I came here. I kind of
didn't think there would be that many punks here I thought
I'd just hang out with other friends I had in other places," Yao
said.
Perhaps because of these low expectations, she was pleas
antly surprised to find that there are, in fact, quite a few peo
ple at Stanford with an interest in punk rock.
But despite a few kids with similar tastes there wasn't a
scene, no cohesive, creative group generating music. "At
Stanford, people aren't connected in that way," she said. "In
other places everyone kind of knows each other and everyone
supports each other."
Like Radin, Yao's search for this kind of community has

brought her to KZSU. She's met a lot of people at the station,
but few of them are actually Stanford students. Yao said that at
times the lack of a scene at Stanford can be discouraging.
"It's kind of sad but sometimes I sit in my room and i get these
ideas for something really fun we can do here, but then I'm like,
Wait, who am I gonna do it with? Never mind.' It would be a
beautiful thing to have an outlet for punk ideas at Stanford."

Yao's doing more than just talking about this: She's sched
led a Kill Rock Stars band called The Need to play in White
• laza at noon on April 1 6. Although this may not turn Stanford
ito a punk mecca overnight, she's excited to be starting
something. She's also tried other things to bring Stanford's
'scoundrels" out of their caves — a film she showed earlier
this year at the Coffee House succeeded in drawing a fair
number of people.
Even if these events don't bring major crowds, Yao finds it
'nportant to introduce them to Stanford.
This idea is important to Yao, who is upset by what she sees
as a lack of choice at Stanford. She likes the idea of a space
apart, a refuge from Stanford's overwhelming "normal-ness."

Can it happen?
"I don't know," said Yao, "because I don't
know this school very well, but if people would
hang out with each other more, maybe they
could set something up."
Currently, she's working on bringing more
bands to campus and trying to set up a few
more film showings. She encourages interested
people to contact her at wyao(c£>leland. Stan
ford, edu.
PETE
Sophomore Pete Solderitsch's room is kind of
a surprise in the austere, motel-like environ
ment of Mirlo's first floor: With all the bare white
walls around, you don't expect such a sudden
riot of punk show flyers, band posters and other
pop-punk memorabilia.

The room's difference from its neighbors is more than aes
thetic. If Stanford's punk community can be characterized by
isolated individuals alone in a sea of "normalcy," Solderitsch
typifies that isolation. Although he plays guitar with a band
back home on the East Coast, his involvement with punk rock
in California has been almost nonexistent.
Solderitsch got into punk as a junior in high school, |ust a
few weeks before Green Day released its mapr-label debut
and catapulted pop-punk into the mainstream. His band,
the Pushovers, got together for a high school Battle of the
Bands and enjoyed it enough that they're still together, even
though the bandmates are dispersed across the country. The
Pushovers have a track on a CD compilation, and more
compilations and a seven-inch are in the works.
When he got to Stanford, Solderitsch was hoping that he'd
be able to continue his exploration of the punk scene. But he
was disappointed.
"I figured I'd meet more people with similar music tastes,"
he said, "but it hasn't really happened."
Solderitsch hasn't done much with punk since he's been al
Stanford; he's only been to three shows since arriving on cam
pus.
Without a car or friends to accompany him to shows, staying
in touch with Bay Area punk is a difficult task. Unable to visi
record stores in San Francisco with any regularity, tie gets his
punk fix by hitting Tower Records and buying a few punk fanzines
or whatever happens to be available by the bands he likes.
Solderitsch is philosophical about his failure to find a punk
rock niche at Stanford but said it still annoys him.
"It's especially interesting to talk to my friends from the
band, because they're having a very, very different college ex
perience than I am," he said. "It's not that this makes me dis
like my experience at Stanford per se It's more like a 'what if'
situation "

Me s excited by the idea ot a scene
at Stanford. "All it would take is one or two
people who know a lot of other people
and are willing and able to put on a show
or two."
S.U.C.K., DEBRA, THE SMELTS
It's 9 p.m. on the Wednesday of fi
nals week, but the Smelts "Stanford's
first all-girl punk band" are in the mid
dle of a vigorous rehearsal in the Terra
woodshed. They've only been together
for a few weeks and are still working on
pulling everything together, but it's obvi
ous that the band, composed of seniors
Erin Graves and Amy Parris and 1 6-year
old Debra Rolph, is enjoying itself
The catalyst for the birth of the
Smelts was KZSU: Parris and Rolph, both

DJs, met at the station. Graves answered a flyer Parris put up,
and a future legend maybe was born. Tonight's re
hearsal is especially strenuous the band's public debut
would be that Friday.
S.U.C.K., or Sub Urban Conspiracy Kids, is Rolph's brain
child, conceived on a long bus ride back from San Francisco
when she finally got fed up with the lack of punk activities in
the Palo Alto area.
Rolph created S.U.C.K to bring people together, organi/
ing shows, yard sales, art exhibits and other activities.
Rolph said she welcomes Stanford students' participation in
S.U.C.K. KZSU is the connection It's really the only way Stan
ford students and Palo Alto kids with similar music interests are
able to meet each other, she said
So far, Rolph is encouraged by S.U.C.K.'s success. Ihe fust
three meetings have been attended by as many as 30 people
Ultimately, she hopes S.U.C.K will lie able to rent a ware
house and put on all-ages, nonprofit shows modeled after the
ones at Berkeley's famous Oilman Street
EPILOGUE
Ihe lirsl S.U.C.K show was March 21 at E Bf, and accord
ing to those who attended it was a success
The bands ranged Irom bad herd rock to guitar noise to
emotional hardcore and varied widely as far as talent was
concerned. About 60 people showed up surprisingly high
attendance (or an under-promoted punk show on the last
night of finals week.
S.U.C.K sold bread and cookies in the back and made
enough money to pay some of the band;. Despite; the loud
music, the cops didn't show up All in all, it was a good hi■
ginning and a possible watershed moment for Stanford's punk
scene.
Of course, there are still obstacles to punk's success here
Ihe most dire one is the unsure fate of KZSU Ihe radio sta
tion lost its ASSU special fee last year and may not be able to
make it through another year without that funding
"Hopefully," said Rolph, "enough people will recognize
KZSU's value before it's too late."
Still, things seem to be looking up for Stanford's punk
scene There are more exr iterj, interested people around than
ever before, and it seems like they're finally ready to stop talk
ing and start acting. Tfie rritiral mass may finally fx; there,
and, like Solderitsch said, it might only take one or two peo
pie actively setting up shows to really get things going

to play Stanford again someday |V
