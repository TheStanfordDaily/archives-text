## The 						Simpsons "songs in the key of springfield" 
### 
I'm not exactly sure what I expected
from the new Simpsons album — some
laughter, some tears and some good clean
fun, perhaps? I was sorely disappointed.
The new album, "songs in the key of spring
field," is a long and occasionally brilliant
but largely uninteresting collection of
roughly 39 different tunes, quips and
themes from"The Simpsons" TV show.
The first track on the album is the fa
mous main title theme by Danny Elfman, a
melody very familiar to all Simpsons afi
cionados. liven people who have seen the
show only once or twice would probably
agree that this song quickly loses its novel
ty, and the fact that 10 versions of the main
theme are included on this album is exces
sive.
Other tracks include the "Itchy and
Scratchy" theme (both the title theme and
the end credits theme), the "Eye on Spring
field" theme and the Halloween special
theme. These tunes are amusing to listen to
once, but putting them on the disc assures
that only true fanatics will buy the album.
()f course there are high points to "songs
in the key ol springfield," many of which are
actual dialogue from the show rather than
songs. For instance, there is I lomer's classic
line, "He lied to us through song. 1 hate it
when people do that!"
And then there's the hilarious drui! scene

in which Bart and
Milhouse take al
ternating hits off a
pure syrup
Squishy. Some of
the songs are also
amusing, such as
the Falco parody,
"Dr. Zaius," and
Homer's homage
to beer ("When I
was 17, I drank
some very good
beer I purchased
with a fake ID").
The main prob
lem with the
album is that the
brilliance of "The
Simpsons" lies al
most entirely in
the dialogue and in
the situations,
rather than in the
soul's or music.

Imagine buying the music from a show like
"Green Acres"; of course the very fanatical
viewers will want to buy the album, but
most of us "normal" people, even those of
us who watch almost every episode, will
find it uninteresting.
One slightly redeeming quality of the

allium is Homer's line, "Marge, it takes two
to lie: One to lie and one to listen." Like
wise, it takes two to be ripped off: One to
sell overpriced crap, and one to waste
money.
Don't waste your money.
