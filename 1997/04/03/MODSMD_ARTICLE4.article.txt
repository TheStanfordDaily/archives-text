# Hague program focuses on mediation
## Summer students will hear lectures from world leaders and diplomats 
### David J. Lee Contributing writer 
Stanford students interested in in
ternational politics will have the oppor
tunity to apply for a unique summer
mediation program to be held in The
Hague, Netherlands. The month-long
summer symposium will bring together
talented students from select universi
ties around the world and offer them a
chance to interact up-close with promi
nent leaders.
"I wanted a chance to meet incredi
ble people, not like in a classroom," said
senior Katarina Milicevic, an interna
tional relations major, who participated
in the symposium last year. "I had only
moderate expectations, and I was very
impressed. For us, Lord David Owen
was one of the speakers. It was a great
opportunity to listen to what they were
saying and challenge them. It's almost
unexplainable."
One of the main features of the sym
posium is a series of open discussions
led by the same diplomats and policy
makers who frequently appear in news
paper headlines. Talks on a variety of
topics such as dispute resolution, use of
international force and law, and human
and civil rights will provide students
with a substantial background in the
reality of international politics.
Senior Sameer Bhatia and juniors
Jason Wong and Kay Shimizu were also
among the several Stanford students in

the program last summer. During their
stay, they attended the Bosnian war
crimes trials and experienced first
hand the tension surrounding the
event.
"It was real, and it was translated
into four or five languages at once," said
Shimizu, who is majoring in interna
tional relations. "They had little models
of the camps, and on one day there was
a public trial for a person who was
raped."
In addition, the students spent a cou
ple of days role-playing the United Na
tions at Clingendael — also known as
the Netherlands Institute of Interna
tional Relations — which trains Dutch
diplomats as well as those from other
countries.
"At Clingendael we were given the
primary and secondary objectives of
certain nations and went through mock
UN negotiations," said Wong, also an
international relations major. "That
was fun."
Shimizu agreed. "It was a really good
part of the symposium," she said. "I
think they're planning to lengthen this
portion of the program."
Clingendael staff are internationally
recognized faculty members who will be
teaching symposium classes this year.
Academic credit may also be given once
it is cleared with Stanford.
The general consensus among last


Ted Mc Guire — Daily
year's Stanford participants is
that the symposium was a fantas
tic experience. A part of that expe
rience is reflected by the relaxed,
though academically stimulating,
atmosphere of the program. Be
cause the symposium is situated
in one of the world's most popular
cities, students and lecturers have
the luxury of an informal setting.
"I liked going out to lunch with
the lecturers and going to bars
with them afterward, just throw
ing around ideas with people at
the top of their fields," Bhatia
said. "Sitting around talking with
the directors of the program was
nice, too."
For Bhatia, however, the sym
posium was more than a fun trip.
The only human biology major in
the Stanford group, he plans to
focus on children and health in
developing nations. In previous
years, with help from his father,
Bhatia started DOSTI — a pro
gram through the Haas Center

for Public Service — that sends
student to India for six weeks in
the summer for service. He saw
the symposium as a stepping
stone to other opportunities in in
ternational policymaking that
could tie in to his interests.
"I realized that my interest in
global development was very
much tied to international con
flict resolution, and ultimately
my career would like to focus on
addressing both of those issues.
"You're going to meet students
who you're going to be very tight
with, keep in touch with. And it's
not only friendship, but friend
ship with people who have very
common interests. I'm sure that
down the line our paths will cross
and I may have a chance to work
with them again," Bhatia said.
The symposium also helped
Milicevic, who was searching for
an honors thesis topic. The sum
mer program was an impetus for
her current thesis, which deals
with the negotiations processes
that attempted to end the war in
Yugoslavia. She plans to discuss
why the first four attempts failed,
while the Dayton Peace Accord

succeeded. Having met, among
others, Lord David Owen who
drafted the successful peace
treaty for Bosnia, she has become
more aware of how negotiations
processes really go on.
"I came to realize that there
are so many different roles and
strategies to think about," Milice
vic said. "I just loved every mo
ment of it."
Stanford is one of only 10 U.S.
educational institutions to be se
lected to participate in the sympo
sium, which is in its second year.
The program is sponsored by The
Institute for International Medi
ation and Conflict Resolution, a
Washington, D.C.-based organi
zation established for the purpose
of providing mediation and con
flict resolution skills to future
world leaders.
The program runs from July
21 until Aug. 15. The deadline for
submitting applications is May
31. Detailed information and ap
