# Hague program focuses on mediation
## Summer students will hear lectures from world leaders and diplomats 
### David J. Lee Contributing writer 
Stanford students interested in in
ternational politics will have the oppor
tunity to apply for a unique summer
mediation program to be held in The
Hague, Netherlands. The month-long
summer symposium will bring together
talented students from select universi
ties around the world and offer them a
chance to interact up-close with promi
nent leaders.
"I wanted a chance to meet incredi
ble people, not like in a classroom," said
senior Katarina Milicevic, an interna
tional relations major, who participated
in the symposium last year. "I had only
moderate expectations, and I was very
impressed. For us, Lord David Owen
was one of the speakers. It was a great
opportunity to listen to what they were
saying and challenge them. It's almost
unexplainable."
One of the main features of the sym
posium is a series of open discussions
led by the same diplomats and policy
makers who frequently appear in news
paper headlines. Talks on a variety of
topics such as dispute resolution, use of
international force and law, and human
and civil rights will provide students
with a substantial background in the
reality of international politics.
Senior Sameer Bhatia and juniors
Jason Wong and Kay Shimizu were also
among the several Stanford students in

the program last summer. During their
stay, they attended the Bosnian war
crimes trials and experienced first
hand the tension surrounding the
event.
"It was real, and it was translated
into four or five languages at once," said
Shimizu, who is majoring in interna
tional relations. "They had little models
of the camps, and on one day there was
a public trial for a person who was
raped."
In addition, the students spent a cou
ple of days role-playing the United Na
tions at Clingendael — also known as
the Netherlands Institute of Interna
tional Relations — which trains Dutch
diplomats as well as those from other
countries.
"At Clingendael we were given the
primary and secondary objectives of
certain nations and went through mock
UN negotiations," said Wong, also an
international relations major. "That
was fun."
Shimizu agreed. "It was a really good
part of the symposium," she said. "I
think they're planning to lengthen this
portion of the program."
Clingendael staff are internationally
recognized faculty members who will be
teaching symposium classes this year.
Academic credit may also be given once
it is cleared with Stanford.
