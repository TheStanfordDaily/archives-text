# Mikhail Pletnev
## Russian Piano School, Volume 9 
### 
Mikhail Pletnev struts his piano play
ing prowess in the latest volume of the
"Russian Piano School" series by
Melodiya.
by playing symphonic pieces he
arranged lor the piano — as well .is music
ol various styles, periods and composers
Irom the little known Rodion Shchedrin to
the household name Wolfgang Amadeus
Mo/art Pletnev, born in 1957, shows his
versatility and virtuosity.
beginning with Pletnev's keyboard ver
sion ot the popular concerto suite from
"The Nutcracker ballet by Peter llyich
Tchaikovsky (1840 1893), the album s first
majestic chords ring familiar yet still in
trigue through the new medium of the
piano.
Although Pletnev plays with a seeming
disadvantage — lacking an orchestra and
playing only one instrument — this two
time winner of the Tchaikovsky ('ompeti
tion has no problem layering his playing to
create different voices. Tor example, in
" The Dance ol the Sugar Plum Tairy," his
delicately played upper hand controls the
listener's attention, while the steady bass
grounds the beat.
While these relatively upbeat songs
prove his technical mastery perhaps more

than his musicality, the final song of the
arrangement, "Andante maestoso" renders
the passion that drives all great musicians,
l ull ol rolling glissandos and grand chords,
it\ easy to picture Pletnev's arms and hodv
moving to, and being moved hv, his evoca
tive, intense music.
The next piece, by the obscure
Shchedrin, born in 1932, is a marked con
trast to the accessibility, mood and fame of
the Tchaikovsky piece. Their only similari
ty is that they are Pletnev's piano arrange
ments of symphonic compositions for bal
let. ( The Shchedrin comes from "Anna
Karenina," I9(i8).
The mood in "Prologue," the first half of
the song, is quiet and melancholy — almost
eerie in fact. The second half, "Horse Race,"
is faster and louder but still retains a night
marish flavor.
In Piano Sonata No. 7 in B-llat major by
Sergei Prokoviev (1891-1953) which fol
lows, dissonance again infuses the agitated
first movement, but in the second, slower,
movement, the listener gets respite in a few
tonal moments. Those who dislike disso
nance may want to jump to the next
Sonata, also in B-flat major but vastly dif
ferent.
The final piece by Mozart (1756-1791)

provides easier listening. Here, Fletnev se
cures his position as a great pianist, for by
now he has shown the listener that he not
only can transcribe music, but he can also
perform works by both modern composers
and canonized ones.
