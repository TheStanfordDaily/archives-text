# Jeremy Toback
## "Perfect Flux Thing" 
### 
What is striking about Jeremy To
back's music is the regular thrumming
on clean acoustic guitar characteristic
of almost every track on "Perfect Flux
Thing." But what is most beautiful is
the way his deeply resonant voice
weaves itself into the web of sound his
instruments create.
"Perfect Flux Thing" is an album of
spacey rock and neo-folk that provides
a flowing soundscape for Toback to
sing over, and he dominates songs
with rich, melodic vocals sung in
lower registers.
This is pop mood music in the same
vein as Sarah McLaughlin, juxtaposing
velvet-smooth vocals that float over
acid electronic sounds and acoustic
guitar. Years of coffee houses and
weekend brunches honed the slowly
sung lyrics and vibrant acoustic guitar,
creating a "happy collision, deep
rhythm and sound" in Toback's own
words.
Tracks range from the up-tempo yet
mellow folk of "Butterfly Elephant" to
thel97os-influcnced slow rock of "The
Word Behind Words." The sounds of
faster rock grooves diversify somewhat
on tracks like "Eden Trampoline" and
"Know" with conga and tribal drum
ming, and in other places string
arrangements can be heard among the
layers of sound.
Although the tracks "California
Phase" and "Clockwise" are good evi
dence that, as Toback writes in his
liner notes, "Somewhere along the line
the songs started resembling songs
one might sing along to," most of the
pieces on this album have complex
structures that contradict that senti
ment. "Unbecome" and the title track
are meandering trips through the
noise of space that come back to their
refrains at particularly unpredictable
times.
Unfortunately, this album has not
really done anything new. We've all
heard these songs before, just in differ
ent incarnations and by different
artists.
This does not invalidate Toback's
legitimate emotional expressions
through original music, but it does
slightly dampen my enthusiasm for
what I think is otherwise a finely craft
ed album.
