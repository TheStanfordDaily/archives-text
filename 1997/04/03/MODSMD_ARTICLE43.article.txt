# The 						Mighty Mighty Bosstones
## "Let's Face It" 
### 
The rascally Mighty Mighty Bosstones have
once again brought ska lovers worldwide a
tasty dog biscuit of an album in "Let's Face It."
Smart guitar licks, mellow bass lines and su
perb vocals make the Bosstones' latest a real
winner. All of the skank energy the Bosstones
pack into their live shows is integrated in "Face
It," making the recording fresh and convinc
ing. Few bands are at their best both on stage
.uul in the studio, but the Bosstones do a great
job of maintaining a high level of intensity
throughout the album.
Diversity is the anchor of the Bosstones'
success. "Face It," like previous albums, is an
excellent medley of dance, mosh and mel
low/kickback tunes. Bosstones songs never
grow old, but they bear a strong tradition of
upbeat ska-core tempo. The music keeps the
listener on his toes. While the ear never knows
quite what to expect next, it is always pleasant
ly surprised by a cool guitar, ii funky bass line
and the familiar voice of lead vocalist and
songwriter Dicky Barret.
Barret is the heart and soul of the Bosstones.
I It- growls, snarls and yells great lyrics. Barret

really punishes his throat on "l ace It" — every
song involves some sort of verse on which a
vocal chord is nearly blown. On "Break So Kas
ily," it sounds as though Barret chews out his
Adam's apple with the lyrics "You took the an
swers when you broke / so easily you're gone."
If Barret is the Bosstones bark, guitarist
Nate Albert is the bite. Albert's riffs and cuts
pack a real punch. 1 le plays both rhythms and
leads, plays reggae, punk and metal pieces and
gives the entire group a real kick in the butt. Al
bert's work on "1-2-8," the final song of the
album, involves simple reggae notes followed
by heavy feedback and tough hard rock chords.
The Bosstones' horn section is good, yet it
fails to achieve the level of brilliance reached by
Barret, Albert and drummer Joe Sirois. Rather,
the two saxophones and trombone act as sup
plements to the rhythm section. The brass lines
in "Another Drinkin' Song" get the music
rolling, but it doesn't sound good until Barret
gets involved. While the horns remain an inte
gral part of the ska-core Bosstone sound, they
don't contribute much to the songs themselves.
