# Morphine
## "Like Swimming" 
### 
Morphine's jazzy, low-rock sound is
hack in"I ike Swimming," the fourth album
from this Cambridge, Mass., band.
Morphine's distinctive sound is created
by Mark Sandman on vocals and two string
slide bass, Hilly Conway on drums and
1 )ana Colley on baritone sax.
"Like Swimming" is less produced than
the group's last album, "yes," although it
fails to recapture the high-octane flare of
Morphine's first two albums. Morphines
second album, "Cure for Pain," first
brought the band into the public eye, with
some of its songs featured on the sound
track of the indie hit film "Spanking the
Monkey." The sleazy, low-class style of
"Sheila" and "Head with Wings" perfectly
matched the story of incest in suburbia.
"Like Swimming" retains the sax-heavy
sound of Morphines earlier albums, but
Sandman's lyrics are more often voiced than
sung.
Still, those lyrics are as fetching .is ever.
"I ianging on a (airtain" stands out, sport
ini! such classic lines as "Little red feet with

lug hluc toes / I el me put my li.iiuls inside
your clot lies." Snth It.ill whimsical, li.il!
menacing verse runs through the allium,

In "like Swimming," though, the siol y

music, rather than melding the two .is in

time, the hand is experimenting with .1

Low" to great suttcss. And the hush,
brassy Morphine trademark is definitely
present in such tracks as I Know You (I'l.

still possesses that siren sung essence that
effectively beguiles its listeners.
