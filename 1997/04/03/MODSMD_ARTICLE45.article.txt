# James
## "Whiplash" 
### 
When we last heard about the British rock group lames,
they were busy cross-dressing and singing loudly about sex
in the album "Laid."
While "Whiplash" has no such obvious theme, it's got
plenty of character. The first single, "She's a Star," is already
getting its share of radio rotation thanks to a charming tune.
From the opening strums of "Tomorrow" to the urgent,
catchy beats of "Homeboy," it is obvious that James is taking
bolder musical steps with its new record. The pace is a tew
strides quicker than the gentle rhythms of "Laid," and the
album has a good deal more drums and electric guitar.
Like many British groups, James is experimenting with
the world of techno / trance music. This is most apparent in
the song "Go to the Bank," which is complete with driving

synthesized instrumentation and a droning dialtone-likc
sound in the background. "Play I )ead" opens up with some
mixed sampling and progresses into a haunting melody.
That isn't to say that James has become a loud dance
group. "Whiplash" retains the overall mellow yet powerful
style that defined the hand's earlier work. Tim Booth's voice
has a great high-end range that manages to he soothing even

in the album s liveliest and heaviest moments.
booth is complemented by some great work on the
drums, guitars and keyboards. I lie mixer s have added ech< >
nig elements to give many of the songs their enchanting
qualities. Brian Kno, the album's co producei, piti lied in 011

Alter listening to "Whiplash, ' I found myself missing I he
slow, dreamy tunes from I,aid. "I he lone remnant from that
relaxed, drumless slyle is the (.losing song, "Blue Pastures."
()ti the other hand, it's inspiring to hear James explore a
different territory; as the title suggests, the album will be a
jolt of energy toold fansand a breath of fresh air to new ones.
