## Crash 
### 
Why do wo find those deathtraps known as
motorcycles sexy? Because when we're on the
edge of death, we feel most alive, and that is
erotic.
Although the human tendency to associate
sex and danger is not uncommon, the charac
ters of "Crash" take danger to a new level. With
a lot of sex and car crashes hut not very much
heart, "Crash" depicts a weird world of acci
dent survivors who find the thrill of danger a
heady — even necessary — aphrodisiac.
James Ballard (James Spader) is a television
producer whose conversations with his wife,
Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger), consist
chiefly (and briefly) of discussion of their ex
tramarital sexcapades. It isn't even clear until
the end of the film why these two are married,
although their lovemaking sessions are among
the few in the film where the participants are
face-to-face.
Alter a near-fatal accident, James meets 1 )r.
Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) who drove
the other car in the crash. At the instant their
eyes meet after the initial impact — which has
flunu her husband fatally into James's car

she immediately signals its erotic effect on her.
Through her the Ballards meet Vaughan
(Elias Koteas), the leader of a subculture of
crash survivors who find the confrontation of
one's mortality the ultimate turn-on. Helen
and James attend reenactments of famous au
tomobile collisions, staged principally by
Vaughan with a studied, scientific attention to
accuracy and detail.
"Crash" has only one immediately likable
character, Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), one
of Vaughan's followers whose appeal is due
mostly to her wistfulness but also partly to her

appearance. With pigtails, sexy black lace and a
black leather body support, she sports horren
dous scars and leg braces as lingering re
minders of her brush with death.
Beautifully shot, the film makes its points
about danger and mortality without much gore,
and there is an abundance of pretty as well as
scarred flesh, both of which are depicted as en
ticing. A figuratively telling meeting of flesh and
metal is the opening sequence, as a woman's
breast kisses the wing of a small airplane.
During one of James and Catherine's sex
acts (one of the few not in a car), Unger's exot

ic beauty is used effectively to create a Medusa
or mermaid effect, with her hair swirled fantas
tically around her. Several driving sequences
show how the characters substitute the inter
play of cars on a freeway — hovering, ap
proaching and encountering — for foreplay
and climax.
Directed by renowned writer-director
David Cronenberg ("The Fly," "Naked Lunch,"
"M. Butterfly"), "Crash" is rated NC-17 for
sexuality (critics charge pornography) and
some violence. "Crash" is based on science fic
tion writer J.C. Ballard's 1973 novel of the same
name.
At its premier in Cannes and elsewhere,
"Crash" provoked controversy. It won a prize
at the Cannes Film Festival in 19% for "audac
ity, originality and daring," after the jury there
decided to honor the film but found no appro
priate existing category. The film has also has
garnered numerous awards in Cronenberg's
native Canada.
Not a mainstream film, "Crash" takes no
moral stands and is meant to be provocative,
challenging the viewer with its disquieting
look at disconnected human interactions in a
sterile modern age.
