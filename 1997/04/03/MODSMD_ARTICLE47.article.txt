# Smilla's Sense of Snow

Things that appear to be contradictory can be powerful in that they may appeal to both sides
of a dichotomy, lor example: Southern 1 )emocrats, intelligent sitcoms, Mercedes station wag
ons, female action movies.
I lerein lies part of the appeal of "Smilla s Sense of Snow," a film that bridges the gender gap
ol movie genres. As proof, both my brother (an adventure and adrenaline-pumping movie
lan) and myself (an artsy and emotional film aficionado) left the same theater feeling satisfied.
I lie movie, which is based on the best-selling mystery novel by Peter I loeg, is about a halt-
In nit woman living in I Vnmark who stumbles into danger when a boy from her apartment
building is found dead. Smilla (lulia Ormond) senses something is wrong by the footprints he
left in the snow. I ler Ihiikli is confirmed by the threats she receives when she starts asking ques
tions. fearlessly, she embarks on .1 journey to discover what some povverlul men wanted with
a sweet I it lie boy.
The appeal of the movie is aided by Ormond's riveting performance. As the outcast, rough
and tough misfit Smilla, underneath her slightly too chic winter outfits and natural prettiness,

Ormond exudes a singular kind of intelligence, sorrow
and strength.
Ormond is an actress known for playing opposite
some of the more high-profile and talented male movie

stars of our time (including Brad Pitt, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford). This film is no ex
ception with the striking Ciahriel Byrne playing her love interest and partner in detective work.
As is consistent with my tendencies, 1 would have liked a hit more screen time devoted to delv
ing into these characters' intriguing psyches and less to building suspense and low-budget spe
cial effects. But that's just me. My brother would contend that there should have been a few more
scenes spent blowing things up. No matter how hard they try, they can never please everyone.
