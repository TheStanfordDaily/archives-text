# Return of the Jedi
## 
### 
There arc essentially two kinds of people in the world: those
who hate the I woks and those who love them. However,
whether you are a tan ot the furry little creatures or not, you
still have to love "Return of the Jedi" — the third installment
in the "Star Wars" trilogy, newly re released in special edition
form.
This "|edi" contains new digital tricks, more than either of
its technology-enhanced predecessors, presumably because
(ieorge I.ucas wanted to go out with a bang. I lowever, the new
segments don't really add much to the film. A musical num
ber in Jabba's palace gives us some new creatures, and the Re
bellion's victory celebration is expanded to include shots of
galaxy-wide revelry (minus that "Yub-nub" Kwok song that
originally closed the film). The new frames seem sort of
empty, though, as if we know that they're just computer ef
fects. They're too cold to really inspire an audience and lack

the substance th.tt made the 1983 scenes so memorable.
Those memorable, original scenes are all there, however,

and are still good times to watch. Quotable lines like "He's
using an old ledi mind trick" and "Your father, he is" have not
lost one bit of their fabulousness, and seeing them spoken on
the big screen only adds to the fiesta. My favorite scene is the
rescue of Han Solo from Jabba's palace, now featuring a more
ravenous Pit of Sarnac computer-beastie to eat up our heroes.
It's got everything: Han getting feisty, Chewie, light-saber an
tics and the nefarious yet badass bounty-hunter Boba Fett. Per
fection.
The "ledi" re-release tampers more with the original than
the first two films, which is unfortunate from a sentimental
standpoint for people from a certain generation. The missing
Ewok song, for example: It just seems strange for the movie to
end without that wacky, persistent, vaguely annoying tune. I
mean, the first 500 times most people saw it, that song stayed
with them for days. The 10-year-olds seeing "Jedi" for the first
time are going to have a slightly different perspective on the
film — but the same action figures, we can only hope.
The re-release of the "Star Wars" trilogy has underlined the
timelessness of these movies, and "Jedi" holds up extremely
well 14 years after its release. It could still be packing them in
centuries from now. But as Yoda would say, "When 800 years
you reach, look as good you will not."
