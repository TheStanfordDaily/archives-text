# The
						Devil's Own

On my way to "The Devil's Own" I Fig
ured that no matter what the movie was
like, I'd at least have plenty to look at: Har
rison Ford and Brad Pitt.
While the stars provided a feast for the
eyes, the plot left my mind hungry for
more. Pitt plays Frankie McGuire, an IRA
member who comes to the United States
and poses as construction worker Rory De
vaney in order to carry out a missile deal for
the cause back home. Ford plays Tom
O'Meara, the Irish-American New York
( ity cop with whom Devaney boards for
reasons that are never made clear. Other
loose ends make the Film a hodge-podge of
elements that run the gamut from action
(.in explosive shoot-out in the Irish coun
tryside) to inaction (a Confirmation cere
monv).

The story meanders between
Devaney / McGuire's IRA escapades, his
romance with an Irish lass named Meaghan
and the way in which he gains the trust of
O'Meara's family, mainly because he's
good-looking and all the daughters have
crushes on him .(Pitt does look especially
appealing while holding and comforting
the youngest O'Meara lass.) But the film
also has to give equal time to Ford, and that
means witnessing the exploits of a goody
two-shoes cop whose superhumanly strong
principles prevent him from following his
heart in life. It doesn't quite seem realistic
for such a cop to exist in New York.
Despite the bad press, superstars Ford
and Pitt prove to be a surprisingly good
pair. Their characters' chummy, affection
ate father-son relationship gives the film its

most substantial element. This is a crying
guy's flick: By sharing tears and trauma,
the two men bond until they discover that
there is no way to reconcile their differ
ences. Ford is appropriate as the American
good guy and looks nice in police pants
reminiscent of Han Solo's trousers. Pitt
pulls off an authentic Irish brogue and
proves himself a much more serious actor
than the pretty boy from flicks like "leg
ends of the Fall."
While the plot is unsatisfying, Ford and
Pitt perform well and hold the film togeth
er with their on-screen relationship. Per
haps the story's loose structure can be ex
plained with one of Devaney's revelations
to O'Meara: "It's not an American
story. . . . It's an Irish one."
