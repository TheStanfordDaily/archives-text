Helping Stanford to build on its
international connection, the
Knight Foundation of Miami has
awarded the University's John S.
Knight Fellowships program a
$1.25 million grant to support two
of its international fellowships.
Because of the grant, "our
funding for our international fel
lows will be on a much more solid
financial footing," said Jim Het
tinger, deputy director of the fel
lowships program.
The program, which brings pro
fessional journalists to Stanford
for a year of non-credit and non
degree academic study, received
the grant after making an infor
mal proposal to the foundation.
The grant will be divided be
tween two international fellow
ships. Although the foundation
has supported a fellowship for a
Latin American journalist for the
past 10 years, it will now provide
$1 million to endow the fellowship,
making it a permanent program
and the first endowed internation
al fellowship.
The foundation has had inter
est in I.jitin American journalism
for some time, according to Het
tinger. The foundation feels
"there is not enough attention
paid to journalism in Latin Ameri
ca,"he said.
In addition to the endowment,

the foundat ion liii ,il,-;i i approved a
$250,000 grant to the Lyle and
Corrine Nelson international
Journalism Fellow hip, which wmh
created three years ago hy former
international fellow who wanted
to raise money to support t he pro
gram The fellowship is named in
honor of retired ( 'ommunication
Prof. Lyle Nelson, director of tho
Knight Fellowships from 1969 to
1985, and his wife.
Alt hough the foundat ion's loca
tion m Miami makes it subject to
Latin American influence, Het
tinger said this is not the sole rea
son for its interest in I -at in Ameri
can journalism
"We believe our program is
playing a small but important ruin
in improving the quality of jour
nalism in a region where I here baa
been a strong move toward press
freedom in recent years," said
Communicat ion Prof. James Kiss
er, director of I he program.
Stanford's program and tho
foundation are ilit ere ted in inter
national journalist: lot the extra
experience they bring to the Amer
ican fellows and the program in
general, according to Hettinger.
Many have been imprisoned or
have witnessed death first-hand.
"They bring a real reality
check, and Iliey're very important
to our Amerivan fellows for that
reason," Het tinger said.
In 1982 the foundation perma
nently endowed the part of the fel
lowships program that brings 12
U.S. fellows to Stanford every

year, but the six international fel
lows have been sponsored on a
yearly basis by the Knight Foun
dation, the Reuter Foundation
and other organizations.
Three international fellows
have been brought in from China,
Hungary and Poland under the
Nelson fellowship.
