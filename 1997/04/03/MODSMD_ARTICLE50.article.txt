Jim Carrey has a bona fide hit on his
hands once again.
Rebounding from his abysmally re
ceived "The Cable Guy," Carrey is perfectly
in tunc with his character, Fletcher Reede,
a lawyer with a penchant for lying. Fletch
er constantly fibs to his clients to postpone
meetings with them. He also relays excuse
after excuse to his mother and his former
wife, Audrey (Maura Tierney of "Newsra
dio"), so that he can, among other things,
strew his boss, Miranda (Amanda Dona
hoe).
For his birthday wish, Fletcher's son,
Max (Justin Cooper), wishes that his father
would not be able to lie tor 24 hours, as
Fletcher has once again failed to show up as
promised.
The first sign that this magical request
lias come true takes place the next morning
when Fletcher admits, "I've had better," to
Miranda. There arc further encounters that
day with a busty woman, a homeless guy
and a royal blue pen that showcase Carrey's
talents as a comic actor.

The core dilemma in the film is c" fol
lows: Fletcher must find a way to present
the Cole case, which is essentially a pack of

lies. Samantha

Tilly) strongly
believes that .is
the victim of her
husband's cold
nature, she de
