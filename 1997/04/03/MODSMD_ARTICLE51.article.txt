(ill ess who's .is old as Mob Dole hut a billion times
coolcr? OK, besides most of the elderly people in this
country... Robert Altman. The groundbreaking indie
filmmaker began his career, which most recently pro
duced stall classics as " The Player" and "Short (Aits,"
in 1943, after a four-year stint as an Air Force bomber
pilot, lor the American director most likely to garner
.111 alarming array of stars for each of his films, we're
lucky his first career didn't take off, as it were.
In 1970, his first film, "M 4 A\S*H" won the Palm
d'( )i .it the ('.nines film festival, and .1 directing star
was born. Starring Robert Duvall, 'Ibm Skerritt and
Donald Sutherland, this landmark film spurred the
wartime television series ol the same name.
five years later saw what some call Alt mail's best early
film, "Nashville," which tracks 24 characters involved
111 a political rally. (characteristic of Altman's rambling
style, "Nashville" stars I.ily Tomlin and Jeff (ioldblum

in a twisting journey through comic vignettes which develop
and sardonically expose American society as well as the coun
try music business.
1982's "Come Hack to the l ive and Dime Jimmy Dean,
Jimmy I )ean" charts the 20 year reunion of a James I Jean fan
diih. I he stunning film's only blemish is Cher, but Altman
survived her acting to make the I Wf film "Secret I lonor." In a
mythic portrayal in which a bottle of scotch helps former pres
ident Richard Nixon recount his life, the film predates Oliver

Stone's "Nixon" blockbuster and outranks it as a revelatory
(yet not self-important) look at one of American history's
greatest fallen heroes.
Altman's career has demonstrated his contempt for the all
important box office. 1992 solidified his professional and per
sonal disgust for Tinsel Town with, ironically, the box office
smash and award-winner "The Player." A more biting portrait
of the film business has yet to be uncovered, and Tim Robbins
stars in this dry-as-dust comic satire that Altman irreverently
called his "third comeback."
Following "The Player," Altman made the long, intense
"Short (iuts," a masterpiece of multiple narrative drama and sit
uational comedy. Weaving together myriad sub-plots based on
Raymond (larver's chilling short stories, Altman skillfully man
ages such stars as I ilies Tomlin and Taylor, Ibm Waits and Tim
Robbins to produce a frightening portrayal of people just like
us. This film is a gorgeous and painful piece of contemporary
art, at once grippingly familiar and a stab in the chest.
Speaking of films full of stars, Altman packed them in his
next film, "Pret-a-Porter," a humorous deconstruction of the
fashion industry. Unfortunately, this film lacks the depth ofhis
early work. Last year he made the box office failure "Kansas
City," starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Miranda Richardson and
1 iarry Belafonte in an exploration of the jazz and mob town of
the 19305. While the soundtrack included unrivaled jazz and
the urban scenery created a striking mood piece, the plot and
dialogue were a disappointment, and reaction to the film was

lukewarm at best.
1 )espite the discouraging productions of his recent past, Alt
man has it in him to create films that rival such American greats
as Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese. So although his "alterna"-
status keeps him obscure, check him out. After all, who knows
how much longer his career will last — Hob Dole's is over.
