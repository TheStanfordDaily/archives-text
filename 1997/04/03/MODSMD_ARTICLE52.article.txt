## Let' em see you sweat 
### Samuel Park 
This spring break I spent a lot of time
watching television, flipping through some
situation comedies and bad hour-long dra
mas like "Baywatch." For some reason my
mind didn't concentrate on catching sloppy
dialogue as it usually does. Instead, I got
fixated on the acting.
Television has done a lot of bad things to
acting, lowering the standards of the work
to the level of commercials and 30-second
spots for coming attractions. It makes stars
out of talking mannequins and tricks peo
ple into believing that a series of continu
ous camera shots constitutes a perfor
mance.
But the worst thing it does is to make
people forget that actors sweat.
No, I don't have a particular fetish for
the excretionary glands of performers, nor
am I an advocate of seeing their body fluids.

But on television, this small, technology
based medium, the "work" of acting is re
placed by the "look" of acting, and the
difference between the two, which is
huge, is erased with the blimp of a remote
control.
Television, like the movies, is a medium
of moving pictures, and on that theory an
entire performance could be pieced togeth
er out of photographs of a person. This
means even an inanimate object could per
haps deliver a convincing performance
with the help of a good makeup artist, a
Pygmalion and an editor. It's also a medium
all about faces â€” close-ups.
In theater, of course, there is no camera
to get in the way of the audience and the ac
tors. Seeing great acting onstage is always a
wonderful reminder of all those things that
become flattened and forgotten in the tube,

like the power of the human body to ex
press emotion.
A television camera, regardless of in
spired editing, can't convey the height and
majesty of an actor playing Lear on a stage.
It can't capture the grace of an actors'
movements, the way the physical language
flows from limb to limb in the continuous
motion of emotion.
But above all, you can't sec the sweat on
the faces of the actor, the way his glistening
body reveals the physical effort of sustain
ing a performance for an entire evening.
One of my favorite moments in theater
was one evening at a one-act play, when the
actor playing the lead role stood right in
front of me during a scene and I could see
the light reflected through the sweat on his
face. This was a black-box theater, tiny, and
if I reached out from my front-row seat, I

could probably touch him with my hand
and wipe that sweat off his brow.
But why would 1 do that? The sweat on
the face of that actor is something impossi
ble to see anywhere other than the theater.
A lot of artists, from Yeats onward, protest
when people forget how much work it is to
create something.
But forget the hours punched in the re
hearsal clock, never mind the time spent
memorizing lines. The real proof of the
sometimes exhausting work of acting is in
that sweat on the face of the actor. It's a
beautiful moment, worthy of a photo
graph.
But can a photograph capture it? Proba
bly not. Can a camera capture it on televi
sion? Even more unlikely, especially be
cause there is nothing to capture in the first
place.
