# SSE supplies funds for Bookstore rival
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
A partnership between Stu
dents Against Monopolies on
Campus and Stanford Student
Enterprises, the business branch
of the ASSU, has established a
solid base for the Bookstore's
only major competitor.
According to ASSU Assoc. Fi
nancial Manager Don Coleman,
the student enterprises pur
chased, on behalf of SMOC, about
40 books for each of several popu
lar lecture classes. SMOC in re
turn has been coordinating a text
book sale and buyback program,
with the proceeds going back to
the student enterprises.
In its first fully operational
quarter, SMOC is overseeing
what it calls the Internet Book
market, which is run through the
Virtual Directory, and a competi
tive buyback program run
through the Stanford Store.
Book buyback is guaranteed at
rates at least 10 percent more
than the Bookstore, while sale
prices will be at least 10 percent
less than the Bookstore.
A desire to keep overhead low
was their guiding principle. "We
reduced everything to the bare
necessities, enough just to cover
the costs," SMOC's founder, ju
nior Danny Bramzon, explained.
"And the Bookstore is just as ca
pable of doing this as we are. They
just don't."
SMOC began in the fall of last
year and grew, thanks to Bram
zon *8 publicity campaign that at

tracted new member,; who
demonstrated using enthusiastic
scream tactics across from tho
bookstore steps. The student en
terprises agreed earlier this year
to tentatively invest in the buy
back program l>y providing
SMOC with the necessary capital
to begin the program.
As yet, Ken Shark, director of
operations of the Bookstore, said
he has not noticed much change
in sales at the Bookstore so early
on in the quarter.
According to Bramzon, howev
er, fj()0 textbooks have been en
tered into the Internet Bookmar
ket. "Response has been great,"
he said. "People know who we are
and what we do now oven before
they come up to our table. We're
not sure we need to be quite as
vocal anymore."
Bookstore officials have in the
past stressed their position a: a
nonprofit organization, cit ing an
nual student rebat< .;i evidence
of their commitment to overall
reasonable pricing.
The reason for tho high prices,
they say, is that goods that do not
make a profit must lie balanced by
the more popular and conse
quently higher priced products.
In addition, freedom in hopping
for classes make it irnpo... ible to
accurately preorder hook quanti
ties, again adding to the sticker
price.
Because SMOC i currently a
completely voluntary organiza
tion Supported by the Indent en
terprises, it hopes to avoid those
same problems as well as saving
on salary and rent payments thus
keeping costs to a minimum. "We

are not going for revenues, and we
have never planned on it," ex
plained sophomore Eric Fried
man, SMOC's vice president.
Although organizing an alter
native book market outside of the
Bookstore is not a completely
novel idea, SMOC is the most re
cent and seemingly most success

ful of the attempts. In the late
1980s, the ASSU offered "Beat
the Bookstore," which failed due
to its high financial losses.
SMOC is trying to avoid that
problem by only buying back
books used in large lecture classes
and working under the protection
of the student enterprises.

Although controversy emerged
late last quarter over whether
SMOC members would be com
pensated for their work put into
organizing the program, Bramzon
insisted that "no SMOC member
will get paid for the work they do.
We just want lower prices and bet
ter buyback rates."
