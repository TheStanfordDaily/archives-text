## Axess moving to Web 
### Grace Chen 
Students will be able to register
using the World Wide Web starting
this summer. Information Tech
nology Systems and Services may
finish transferring the Axess sys
tem as early as July, said Universi
ty Registrar Roger Printup.
This is part of a larger effort to
make University services more ac
cessible.
"What we are trying to achieve
is a system that is so easy to use
that students don't need any train
ing," Printup said.
ITSS has been working since
last fall to transfer Axess to Inter
net format and is now testing the
system on a few students. While
ITSS is in charge of working on the
technical side of preparing the Web
site, the Registrar's Office is mak
ing sure that the site complies with
University policies.
Axess on the Web will offer as
many or more of the services cur
rently on Mac Samson, Printup
said.
"We want to make sure that it
works ... so that by the time a
large number of students return in
the fall, we know that it is a stable
system," Printup said.
According to him, Axess will
maintain the same level of security
on the Web as it does on Mac Sa
mson. The Web site will be more con
venient for students because it will
be available all day, without the
breaks that are necessary with
Mac Samson.
Margo Cannenberg, who is in
charge of the technical side of
preparing the Web site, said Axess
probably will be offered between 7
a.m. and midnight. However, the
possibility exists that these hours
may be extended in the future.
Some of the additions Printup
hopes to see on the Web site are the
function to declare a major and the
option to de-commit registration,
which currently can be done only in
person at the Office of the Regis
trar. Also in the interest of conve

nience, students will no longer need
to go to a different site to declare a
minor.
In addition, Printup said the
Web site might offer students the
option of paying their bills to the
Bursar's Office and completing
registration and financial aid
forms.
Axess will still be available on
Mac Samson in the first few weeks
of the Web site's operation, but

Axess will eventually be used only
on Mac Samson as a backup for the
Web site, Printup said.
The other systems on Mac Sa
mson might work more quickly once
Axess is moved to the Web, he
added.
However, according to Cannen
berg, "Half of the Axess informa
tion would still be on the main
frame computer when the system
is functioning on the World Wide

Web." Consequently, she said it is
uncertain whether the other sys
tems on Mac Samson would be
come more efficient with the trans
fer of Axess to the Web.
A positive factor in moving
Axess to the Web is the visual ap
peal of Web sites, Printup said. He
noted that people find the Web in
terface attractive, and ITSS will be
able to add more graphics and color
to the Web site.
