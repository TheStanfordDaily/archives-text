The German government awarded Dennis
Bark, a senior fellow and deputy director of the
Hoover Institution, with a high honor last
month for his contribution to German-Ameri
can scientific cooperation.
He received the Officer's Cross of the Order
of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany,
which he said "is equivalent to the Order of the
British Empire or the French Legion of
Honor."
Bark added that the honor "is usually given
to Germans and occasionally foreigners for a
contribution to education, business, journalism
or the arts that enriches the life of culture of
Germany."
On his reaction to being awarded the high

honor, he said, "It was a complete surprise, but
I am very appreciative."
Bark attended Stanford as an undergraduate
from 1960 to 1964, and his interest in German
studies was spurred by a class he took as a senior
from a visiting professor from the Free Univer
sity of Berlin.
Two years later, Bark decided to continue his
own studies at the University of Berlin, obtain
ing a doctoral degree summa cum laude in his
tory and political science.
Bark joined Hoover as a fellow for studies in
Germany in 1968 while he was also a fellow of
the Alexander von Humboldt and Fritz Thyssen
Foundations. In 1981, he was promoted to
deputy director and senior fellow of the institu
tion.
In his career as a scholar of German history,
Bark has written several groundbreaking

books about Berlin during the Cold War peri
od.
These include "Die Berlin-Frage 1949-
1955," "Agreement on Berlin" and his major
work, "A History of West Germany," which won
high international acclaim. In addition, Bark
acted as scholarly advisor to the film documen
tary, "The Germans: Portrait of a New Nation,"
produced in 1994.
In concluding his acceptance speech at the
German consulate general, Bark summed up
his past and future pursuit in German studies:
"My relationship with German affairs goes back
three decades and presumably will continue an
other three decades with the birth of my god
daughter in Hamburg."
Other recent Stanford recipients of the
award include History Prof. Norman Naimark
and German Studies Prof. Russell Berman.
