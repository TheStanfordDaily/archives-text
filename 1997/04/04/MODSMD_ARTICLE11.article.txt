Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, former director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, has
joined the likes of Thomas Edison, Enrico
Fermi and Albert Einstein in receiving the
prestigious Matteuchi Medal.
The Italian National Academy of Sciences
presented him with the annual award for his
achievements in the study of particle physics as
well as his work as the administrator of SLAC.
Panofsky learned that he had been awarded
the medal a month ago, when he received a fax
from the academy.
"It was completely out of the blue," he said.
"I had heard nothing about it."
The award ceremony took place on March
22 in Rome. "It was quite a solemn ceremony,"
Panofsky recounted. "But unfortunately, it
was all in Italian. I had a friend of mine sitting

behind me whispering a translation in my ear."
The award is another achievement in
Panofsky's long and illustrious career. Begin
ning in the 19405, Panofsky studied pi mesons,
particles that carry the charge that binds neu
trons and protons, at UC-Berkeley.
In the course of his experiments, he discov
ered neutral pi mesons. He then performed
studies to define the properties, such as mass
and parity, of these new particles. He describes
this work as a "cornerstone of elementary par
ticle physics."
Panofsky went on to develop SLAC, which
he directed from 1962 to 1984. His administra
tive skills have made the center highly success
ful, spawning three Nobel prizes.
"He is generally regarded as being one of the
best science administrators ever," said Burton
Richter, director of "He has a rare com
bination of taste and talent that has enabled
him to always find the right people for a job."

Since retiring from his post at SLAC,
Panofsky has dedicated himself to working for
nuclear arms control. For several years he
served as chair of the National Academy of Sci
ence's Committee on International Security
and Arms Control that, among other things,
facilitated dialogue between scientists in the
United States and such countries as Russia
and China.
Panofsky is currently working on the prob
lem of the management of surplus plutonium.
The Matteucbi Medal is one of the longest
running science awards in the world. The
Academy was founded in 1785 and has been
awarding the Matteucbi Medal since 1868.
The medal recognizes great achievement in
the physical sciences. Past recipients also in
clude Lord Kelvin, John Rayleigh, Konrad
Rontgen, Pierre and Marie Curie, Robert Mil
likan, Werner Heisenberg, Freeman Dyson
and John Wheeler.
