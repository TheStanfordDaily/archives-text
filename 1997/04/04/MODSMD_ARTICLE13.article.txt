California reaches tobacco agreement
LOS ANGELES (AP) — California has reached a preliminary
agreement with the Liggett Group that will allow the state to
share in a settlement with 22 other states seeking reimbursement
for health costs related to smoking, Attorney General Dan Lun
gren announced yesterday.
"This historic settlement is extraordinary in that California
did not even have to sue Liggett in order to strike this agree
ment," Lungren said.
In a related development, Liggett also reached tentative settle
ments yesterday with 13 California counties: Alameda, Contra
Costa, Marin, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Fran
cisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shas
ta and Ventura.
Lungren, a Republican, has steadfastly refused to join the
other states in suing the tobacco industry, despite pressure from
Democrats and anti-smoking activists.
He has said that a provision instate law prohibits the state from
suing the industry. The law exempts from liability the manufactur
er of a product that "is inherently unsafe and is known to be unsafe
by the ordinary consumer" and specifically mentions tobacco.
Fed chairman to wed NBC reporter
WASHINGTON (AP) — Let the market melt down. Andrea
and Alan are getting married.
The wedding Sunday of NBC's Andrea Mitchell and the Fed
eral Reserve's Alan Greenspan is a merger made in Washington:
Big time TV personality weds second most powerful man in the
country. One moves ratings; one moves markets.
They met when she covered a blue-ribbon commission created
to rescue Social Security. He ran the commission.
Between questions, interest perked. Two years later, he asked
her out. Cautious and deliberate is a Greenspan hallmark.
After a 12-year courtship, he popped the question on Christ
mas Day. He's given her a huge diamond ring.
The afternoon ceremony will be an hour's drive outside Wash
ington at the pricey Inn at Little Washington. The guest list — 75
close friends — includes Washington's movers and shakers.
ABC's Barbara Walters, an old Greenspan flame, and Sen. John
Warner, Walters' current escort, are expected.
