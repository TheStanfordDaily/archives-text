# Stock market continues downward trend
## Wall Street insiders begin discussing the unthinkable: Is the bull market gone? 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Hugh
Johnson, a market pro since Lyn
don Johnson was president, decid
ed yesterday to pull some of the
$260 million his firm manages for
investors out of the stock market.
That decision was not taken
lightly. But the market has been
so weak recently that even the
most seasoned Wall Street
investors are beginning to whis
per the unthinkable.
"It's a correction," Johnson
says. "Now the question is, is it
going to deteriorate into a bear
market?"
Important government figures
on employment in March, due out
today, are more critical now than
ever. A stronger-than-expected job
picture might prompt the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates
again, dampening the economy.
If that's so, (tic 6 1/2-year bull
market may be in jeopardy. The
trouble, of course, is that no one
really knows.
Like many others, Johnson,
First Albany Corp.'s chief invest
ment officer, doesn't think a bear
has yet come knocking. But bear
markets are like quicksand, often
hard to recognize until it's too late.
Stocks tend to ebb and (low, but
since the fall of 1990 a rising Dow
Jones industrial average has been
pretty much a constant. Despite
two presidential elections, an
uncertain economy, military oper

ations from Haiti to Bosnia and
political scandal, investors have
been consistently rewarded.
The current rise took the Dow
from about 2,360 to a high of
7,085.16 on March 11. It has since
lost 8.6 percent â€” almost com
pletely erasing its gains for the
year. Yesterday, the index closed
at 6,477.35, down 39.66 points.
Last March was the last time
the market had a case of the jit
ters, shortly after a February
1996 jobs report was released
that showed real strength. The
Dow tumbled 171 points.
The problem then was a con
cern that the Fed would stop cut
ting interest rates to stimulate the
economy. The concern now is that
it will raise them again, after
doing so last week for the first
time in more than two years.
"This one, I think, is more
severe than last March," says
Steve Burr, an accountant tend
ing to his portfolio during
lunchtiine at a Fidelity Invest
ments office in New York.
Burr was buying on the 171-
point decline last March, viewing
the market as still healthy and the
sellofTas an opportunity.
This time is different. Burr says
he has increased the cash portion
of his portfolio and gotten rid of
some of the more speculative
shares he held in favor of larger,
more stable companies.
