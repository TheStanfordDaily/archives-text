Move to Web will much
improve Byzantine rules
for accessing Axess

ON WEEKDAYS, AXESS,
Stanford's computerized
gateway to grades, tran
scripts and more, opens at 7 a.m.
and promptly closes at 10. It opens
again from noon until 2 p.m. Then
it shuts down again. Finally, at 4
p.m., it reopens and stays open until
midnight. On weekends, generous
ly, it's open from 9 a.m. to midnight.
Such sporadic availability has
punched many holes in students'
schedules and been the black mark
on an otherwise effective registra
tion system. However, with upcom
ing changes to Axess, days of log
on disappointment will hopefully
be a thing of the past.
Students have long argued that
Axess' operating hours are, simply
put, inane. It can be argued that it
makes sense for all University
offices to close from noon to 1 p.m.
— after all, the people who work in
them do need lunch — but there's
no apparent reason why the Axess
computers need daily breaks.
The reality, however, is that
Axess does not close merely for the
Registrar's amusement. Rather,
because Axess is part of a huge
administrative mainframe also used
by the accounting, budget and per
sonnel departments, the registra
tion system cannot be open during
all working hours. From 10 a.m. to
noon and from 2 to 4 p.m., adminis
trative computing tasks are so
heavy that, in order to alleviate
some of the electronic traffic, Axess
must be shut down.
Although Axess' closing is tech
nologically necessary, it is neverthe
less a burden on students. Universi
ty Registrar Roger Printup has said
that he doesn't like the current sys
tem; he's seen to it that Axess is
open until midnight to better
accommodate students' schedules.

However even this provision is not
satisfactory because students often
need to access Axess in the middle
of the day or in the early morning
hours to request a transcript or
check a distribution requirement.
Recognizing these student
desires, the Registrar's Office has
made the much-anticipated move
to increase Axess' hours by placing
the system on the World Wide Web.
Not only will the system be avail
able from 7 a.m. to midnight daily,
but it also may allow even more
administrative tasks to be accom
plished via computer. The registrar
is proposing that students might be
able to pay their tuition bills or
declare a major through the Web
interface. These new options may
be little things in the grand scheme
of most students' lives, but they
successfully make at least one
aspect of the University's bureau
cracy a little less cumbersome.
And the fact is, it's about time
these changes take place. Already
Axess is one of the finest registra
tion systems of its kind. While other
schools have their students fill out
old-fashioned paperwork, use
archaic, telephone-based registra
tion systems and even force their
students through an onerous
add / drop process, we have been
fortunate enough to avoid all of that
misery. And now with the increased
hours, students will be able to avoid
that misery for even longer.
However, the new system seems
not to be without its flaws. The Reg
istrar's Office should attempt to
make Axess available 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, to accom
modate all student's hectic sched
ules. Moreover, considering the
amount of complaining students
have done in the past regarding
Axess' random operating hours, the
Registrar's Office needs to pay clos
er attention to student desires.
Axess' move to the Web seems
to reflect the registrar's eagerness
to listen to students. Finally, it
seems, access to Axess will be suf
ficient for the system to live up to
its name.
