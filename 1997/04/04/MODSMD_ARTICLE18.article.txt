## A 						protest to the protesters 
### 
I HAVE A confession to make. This
morning, after I got out of bed, brushed
my teeth and woke up, I came down
stairs to the kitchen. And I ate breakfast.
Breakfast is perhaps the most political
event in my day.
I take a mug from the cupboard. "That
coffee," my friend informs me, "is
racist." I look up at her. "The milk and
sugar you put in it protect you from tast
ing the bitterness of the sweat and toil of
those plantation laborers. It is systemic
power. I learned it in sociology. Trust
me." I don't want people to be oppressed
just so I can stay awake in my 9 a.m.
class. I replace the mug.
I take a bowl from the cupboard and
put it underneath the Raisin Bran dis
penser. Unfortunately, someone
informed me two weeks ago that raisins
are actually shriveled up grapes. I had
spent the last two years of my life trying
to convince myself that I didn't, in fact,
know that about raisins. However, the
cognitive dissonance is now too much for
me. Maltreated laborers picked those
raisins. So I put the bowl away.
I reach for a plain bagel because no one
knows what controversy might surround
sesame seeds. I cut the bagel in half. I put
both halves in the toaster. I turn the
toaster on. I take both halves out of the
toaster. I grab the jar of jelly. And then it
hits me. It was in second grade, I remem
ber very distinctly, that my father told me
that my family couldn't visit Knott's

Berry Farm because the owners were
notoriously anti-Semitic. Besides, it is
strawberry jam, and there should eventu
ally be a boycott on strawberries. The
laborers who pick them are forced to work
for sub-minimal wages in pesticide
soaked fields. Just like the coffee laborers
and the grape laborers.
I proceed to eat my bagel dry, and still I
feel guilty. At this point I have begun to
think about world hunger. I realize that I
don't really need to eat the bagel at all.
I have another confession to make.
Once, in the middle of the night when no
one was looking, I had a Dorito. This was
at a time when PepsiCo had not yet pulled
out of Burma. Doritos are a product of
Frito-Lay. Frito-Lay is a subsidiary of
Pepsi Co. PepsiCo is the instrument of
Lucifer. I ate a Dorito when no one was
looking, and I may as well have taken
communion with the devil.
I believe I am confused.
Every morning, I have to force myself
to remember that strawberries and grapes
are not themselves physically responsible
for the repression of migrant farmwork
ers. It is easier to hate innocent fruits that
I hold in my hands than some nebulous,
nefarious system that continues to elude
my grasp. But the recent withdrawal of
PepsiCo from Burma serves as proof that
boycotts are not directed at products and
companies so much as they are targeted at
the injustice perpetuated by the sale of
those products. Hating Doritos isn't

enough because now that I cannot hate
them anymore, I don't know how to focus
on the oppression in Burma. Boycotts are
important. But they are not enough.
This is remarkably easy for me to for
get. My participation in boycotts has
often been more habitual than passion
ate. This may be evidenced by the fact
that I have been boycotting a company
for 12 years because my father once told
me it was run by bad people. For all I
know, Knott's Berry Farm could now be
owned and run by hippies. And yet I con
tinue to spell it Naz Berry Farm. I may be
missing the point entirely.
A unified front is desirable, but
facades of protest will lead to superficial
change. Human beings should not be
forced to work in conditions that endan
ger their lives. No one should be permit
ted to breathe pesticide fumes in order to
support a family. That fundamental can
cer which lies far beneath the surface of
political catch phrases is sometimes very
hard to focus on. But boycotting on
empty doesn't get at the heart of a sys
tem of corporate injustice. It leaves us
hungry, and more important, it leaves a
lot of other people hungry, too.

Jocelyn Wiener, a sophomore majoring in
urban studies, is ashamed to admit that
she really enjoyed that Dorito.
