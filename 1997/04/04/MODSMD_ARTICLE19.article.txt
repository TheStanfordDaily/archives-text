A world of opportunity open to humanities majors

IN HER COLUMN "Oh, the humani
ties of it all" (April 2), Rula Razek
says that society does not value the
skills that she has acquired as a humani
ties major. She writes, "What I really
want to be is not socially useful at all, at
least not to any prevailing standard.
What I really want to be is a scholar, a
writer, a thinker, a teacher, a journalist,
a critic." She ends the column by asking
how we can make scholarship useful,
desirable and important and also asks
how she can "turn modern thought and
literature into food and rent."
Although I am not sure if this is what
she intended, Razek's column seems to
suggest that the humanities are useless
in that, first, she cannot use her skills to
contribute to society because society does
not value them, and second she cannot
secure a job with her skills. I worry that
many students who have read Razek's
column will consequently decide not to
major in the humanities, and I feel the

need to suggest that perhaps Razek's dif
ficulties do not reflect her course of
study but her own attitude toward her
future.
Although I may feel differently when I
am a senior searching for a job or gradu
ate school, I currently feel that a human
ities major is quite useful to society and
is indeed marketable.
According to the Stanford Bulletin,
Razek should possess many useful skills
as a student in the Modern Thought and
Literature Program. The Bulletin claims
that MTL students commit themselves
to "the interdisciplinary study of modern
literature (since the 18th century), cul
tural history and critical theory." Fur
thermore, students enroll in classes from
the disciplines of anthropology, commu
nication, comparative literature, English,
history, philosophy and political science.
It seems that these subjects should pro
vide Razek with the knowledge to work
toward solving many major problems

such as racism and poverty. It also seems
that the analytical, critical-thinking and
communicative skills she has gained
should provide her with the tools she
needs to engage in this type of work.
To give concrete examples, Razek
could apply to be part of the Caux Schol
ars Program: Applied Studies in Peace
making in a Global Context, Caux,
Switzerland. She could apply to World
Teach. She could apply to intern at the
United Nations. She could apply to work
at think tanks such as Ruder Finn or
AEI, learn book-publishing skills at Ran
dom House, work for the Fund for the
Feminist Majority, apply to work for the
U.S. State Department, apply to intern
at the White House or even attempt to
run the White House one day, incorpo
rating the skills she gained from modern
thought and literature into running the
country! Razek could even be a "scholar,
a writer, a thinker, a teacher, a journal
ist, a critic" in these jobs. Furthermore,

many of these opportunities do not have
deadlines until April 15. There is still
time! All of this information, besides on
the presidency, I imagine, is on file at the
CPPC.
The opportunities for humanities
majors are out there. Students simply
must make the effort to find them.
Razek stated in the beginning of her col
umn that she has not even seriously
attempted to search for a job yet. While a
major provides students with informa
tion and, more important, the tools to
use that information, it is up to the to
student actually put that information
and those tools to use. Perhaps her col
umn would have better served Stanford
students if she had written about how
students need to be more responsible for
their futures. Peeople's futures are not
so much determined by their major than
it is by their own actions and efforts.
