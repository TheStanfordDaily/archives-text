# Problems continue for Bon Appetit union
## 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
Nearly a year after voting for a union, workers at several
eateries in Tresidder Union are engaged in contentions negoti
ations over their first union contract.
"We've been scheduling some heavy duty meetings," said
Mary Clark, a district manager for Bon Appetit, which man
ages the Corner Pocket, the Coffee House, Baker Street, The
Cafe and a altering service.

Negotiations are already behind schedule because the
union's final package was originally expected in November but
not delivered until January, she said.
"We're very far apart," Service Employees International
Union Local 715 representative Kristie Sommersein said.
"We're certainly trying to speed up the process."
Workers decided to join the SFIU last June. The union, part
of the AFL-CIO, claims about 1 million members overall, in
cluding about 1,200 on the Stanford campus.
"These workers are looking for fairness," Sommersein said,

mentioning four main areas of concern.
First, the union wants any layoffs that may happen to fol
low a seniority principle, but Bon Appetit does not want such a
restriction in termination, Sommersein said.
Second, lx>cal 715 is seeking wage improvements. Current
ly, the about 120 employed at Hon Appetit's eateries who work
"somewhat regularly" earn between $5.50 and $ 10.80 an hour
with most earning about $7, Sommersein said.
Third, members want respect for
their union, according to Sommer
sein. In particular, they want an
agency shop so that even nonunion
members must pay a fee to cover col
lective bargaining costs.
Members also want union repre
sentatives to have the right to make
unannounced visits to the work
place as well as the right to place a
bulletin board informing workers of

union activities.
Fourth, the union is seeking im
provements in the medical benefits
workers receive. Currently, cover
age is only provided for those who
work at least 32 hours per week. The
union is seeking to reduce the re
quirement to 24 hours.
In addition, the union believes
the workers are required to con
tribute too large a portion of their
earnings for health insurance. The
union feels that Bon Appetit re
quires the employee to pay too much
for health insurance out of his
monthly pay check. The union is try

ing to commit Bon Appetit to paying
up to $100 of the insurance costs
each month, Sommersein said.
Clark rebutted any suggestions
that workers face poor treatment.
"If we have really treated people
poorly, why would they work for us
eight or nine years?" she said.
According to Clark, the union is
unsympathetic to lion Appetit's eco
nomic situation. She notes that sales
are down by 20 percent this year due
to competition from Polio Rey.
Bon Appetit is implementing
new features, like nighttime pizza
delivery, in order to improve its com

petitiveness, she added.
Clark said Bon Appetit is not in
the same situation as most business
es and that union officials "don't un
derstand the type of business we're
in." There are a fixed number of
people on campus, she explained.
"We can't price ourselves out of a
market, and we're very sensitive to
that," Clark said.
"This employer makes millions
and millions of dollars," Sommer
sein said. She added that Bon Ap
petit "hasn't shown us the books,"
and she did not expect them to do so
during negotiations.
