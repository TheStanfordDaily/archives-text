Nearly a year after voting for a union, workers at several
eateries in Tresidder Union are engaged in contentions negoti
ations over their first union contract.
"We've been scheduling some heavy duty meetings," said
Mary Clark, a district manager for Bon Appetit, which man
ages the Corner Pocket, the Coffee House, Baker Street, The
Cafe and a altering service.

Negotiations are already behind schedule because the
union's final package was originally expected in November but
not delivered until January, she said.
"We're very far apart," Service Employees International
Union Local 715 representative Kristie Sommersein said.
"We're certainly trying to speed up the process."
Workers decided to join the SFIU last June. The union, part
of the AFL-CIO, claims about 1 million members overall, in
cluding about 1,200 on the Stanford campus.
"These workers are looking for fairness," Sommersein said,

mentioning four main areas of concern.
First, the union wants any layoffs that may happen to fol
low a seniority principle, but Bon Appetit does not want such a
restriction in termination, Sommersein said.
Second, lx>cal 715 is seeking wage improvements. Current
ly, the about 120 employed at Hon Appetit's eateries who work
"somewhat regularly" earn between $5.50 and $ 10.80 an hour
with most earning about $7, Sommersein said.
