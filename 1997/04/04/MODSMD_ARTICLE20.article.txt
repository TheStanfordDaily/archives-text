# More Israeli settlements threaten to undermine Mideast peace process
## 
### 
In their letters of April 3, Jim Fin
ten and Marvin Sommer use diversion

ary tactics to defend the Israeli govern
ment from the charge that its provoca
tive actions are undermining the peace
process. They ignore Israel's repeated
violations of both the letter and spirit of
the Oslo agreements and instead focus
on Palestinian violence. Unfortunately,
when it comes to violence each side has
its share of perpetrators.

The real issue is that '2 million
Palestinians are steadily losing their
land, their water and their hopes of
future statehood while Israel preempts
negotiations by expanding Jewish set
tlements in East Jerusalem, the West
Bank and Gaza.
The day before Finsten and Som
mer's letters appeared, Israel's defense

minister announced plans to build thou
sands of additional apartments in Jew
ish settlements in the West Bank, a
move that The New York Times said
"was likely to further aggravate ten
sions." It is surely no way to make
peace.
