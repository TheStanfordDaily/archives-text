# Amateur radios provide an amusing hobby

While teen-agers cling to their telephones and
doctors cling to their beepers, some electrical en
gineering graduate students rely on their long
wave, low-frequency radios for enjoyment and
communication.
"Amateur radio is a good geek hobby," said
Philip King, Stanford Amateur Radio Club pres
ident and electrical engineering doctoral student.
The club provides virtually free use of its radio
equipment to students, encouraging the activity
with classes and monthly meetings.
Affectionately referred to as "hams" by their
peers, amateur radio fanatics have run the Stan
ford Amateur Radio Club for more than 70 years.
The radios are used for communication, emer
gency preparation and community service by un
dergraduates, graduate students, alumni and
community members alike.
With a long tradition behind them, the only
thing that might worry the club is the shortage of
new hobbyists joining the ham gang. "Most of
our members are from Silicon Valley. I don't
think we are reaching the undergraduates who
are interested," said Manish Sharma,
secretary / treasurer of the club. He is also an
electrical engineering doctoral student.
The number of people involved might be de
clining because the image of the radio is chang
ing, Sharma said. "Ham radio as a hobby is be
coming less glamorous," he said.

At the same time, the Federal Communica
tions Commission is making it easier to get in
volved. "For a long time it was more difficult to
become a part of the radio community, but now
the FCC has relaxed requirements to get a li
cense," Sharma said.
"You don't have to be a techie to be a ham,"
said David Findley, a staff member at the Stan
ford Medical Center.
Despite recent trends, most people are at
tracted to ham because of its technical character.
"Ham radio is the only radio service where you
are encouraged to alter your equipment to make
it more powerful and effective," said King.
The particularly low-frequency range of ham
operation lets signals reflect off of the ionosphere
for communication directly with people located
on the other side of the planet. In contrast, stan
dard radio broadcasts can be received only along
line of sight. For King, ham radio provides the
same communication opportunities which oth
ers find on the Internet. "You can just get on the
air and meet people anywhere," King said.
Findley was attracted to the radios far before
he came to Stanford. "I started when I was 12,"
he said. "I was interested in talking with people
all over the world."
Not only can the low-frequency range of ham
radio travel long distances, but the higher fre
quencies can bounce off of satellites and reach as
tronauts in the Mir Space Station.
"Talking to the cosmonauts gives you a real

kick," said Sharma, who built his first transmit
ter as a child in India.
However, ham is also not just for communica
tion. "Some people consider ham to be a form of
sport and try their best to contact a large number
of remote countries," King said.
Because of its long-range, low-power require
ments and wireless nature, ham radio is the best
form of communication to use in emergencies.
The Stanford club holds emergency drills every
few months, working with local sheriff 1 s depart
ments and hospitals to ensure that the Bay Area
will have necessary communication in case of a
flood, earthquake or other disaster.
On a smaller scale, the club helps out the com
munity by providing logistical support and com
munication every day. This weekend, the club is
following elderly runners during the annual 50-
plus race at Stanford Stadium to alert ambu
lances if runners have a difficult time on the
course.
Overall, ham operators say their attraction to
the hobby has a dual technical and personal na
ture â€” on the one hand, it offers the creative
thrill of building one's own radio. On the other, it
provides contact with other people.
"The fun is in the talking," Sharma said. "You
sit down late in the night, turn on your radio and
wonder who you will talk to and where they will
be. With the radio, some people even play chess
between continents."
