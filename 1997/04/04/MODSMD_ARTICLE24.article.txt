## Baseball in conference rematch No. 7 Trojans await Card 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
With the No. 4 Stanford baseball team enjoying
a position atop the league standings and playing
its best baseball of the season, will the Cardinal
ever get a chance to relax?
Not according to junior second baseman Joe
Kilburg.
"In our conference you can never let up," he
said. "Every series is a big series."
1 his weekend's three-game set against No. 7
USC will be no different. The Trojans (29-10, 11-7
Pacific 10 Southern Division) were humiliated ear
lier in the season at Sunken Diamond when the
Cardinal (23-8, 10-2) took three games in a row.
But USC has regrouped and is steaming ahead
with a six-game winning streak.
"They're playing their best baseball right now,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "They're going to
come out real tough."
USC is coming off a three-game sweep of Ari

zona State in Tempe, Ariz., where the Trojans
came out with all gears pumping. After falling
behind 7-0 in the first game, they were able to roar
back, scoring one run in the fifth and then 10 in
the seventh to overwhelm the Sun Devils. The
team triumphed in the last two games by comfort
able margins, 12-1 and 11-7.
For their performance in the sweep, senior first
baseman Greg Wallbridge and senior pitcher
Randy Flores earned Pac-10 player of the week
and pitcher of the week honors, respectively.
The Cardinal will have to look out for an offen
sive explosion from the Trojan's top three hitters,
senior Jason Brown (.438), outfielder Greg
Hanoian (.429) and second baseman Wes Rachels
(.360). Brown has smacked three grand slams in
the last 10 games, helping the team go 8-2 in that
span.
Trojan pitching is also nothing to scoff at. Flo
res, a preseason All-American with a 7-3 record
and a 3.09 ERA, will be the first
to face Stanford. Last weekend's
complete-game victory against
the Sun Devils tied him with
legendary USC pitcher Bruce
Gardner as USC's all-time win
ningest pitcher, with 40 career
wins. Friday's start opposite
Stanford's Kyle Peterson (5-1,
4.05 ERA) will give Flores the
chance to take sole possession of
the record.
Flores and his supporting
cast have pitched their way to a
3.94 ERA, while holding oppo
nents to a .241 batting average.
Stanford, however, has never
shied from good pitching.
Despite being led by sophomore
center fielder Jody Gerut (.397,
4 HR, 43 RBI), Kilburg (.377, 5,
29) and senior left fielder Chris
Clark (.374, 5, 30), the key to
the team's offense has been con
sistent hitting on the part of the
whole team.
"I'm pleased with our
offense," Marquess said. "We've
been consistent, that's impor
tant."
But Marquess hastened to
add that not everything is
peaches and cream for the Car
dinal.
"We're still a young team,"
he said. "But we're further
along at this point that I
thought we would be. We still
need to improve defensively and
pitching-wise."
Stanford will try to extend its
lead in the Six-Pac tonight at 7
n.m at Dedeaux Field.
