# Tennis faces conference test
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Most women's tennis teams
would shiver at the prospect of
playing seven consecutive match
es against the toughest confer
ence in the country. But then
again, No. 2 Stanford hasn't lost
in 27 straight Pacific 10 Confer
ence matches.
In fact, the last time the Car
dinal (19-1 overall, 3-0 Pac-10
Southern Division) lost a confer
ence dual match, its current No.
1 singles player, freshman Lilia
Osterloh, was just a sophomore
in high school.
Currently 3-0 in the Pac-10
South play this season, Stanford
is vying for its third consecutive
undefeated conference season
and its 10th straight Pac-10 title.
However, the Cardinal will
face a tough test at home this
weekend, as Pac-10 rivals UCLA
and USC come to Taube Family
Tennis Stadium for a weekend
homestand.
"I don't know if it ever feels
comfortable," said head coach
Frank Brennan of facing Pac-10
opponents. "I'm always uncom

fortable with something. But we
are a good team, and if we are
going to win a championship, we
have to be challenged and rise to
the challenge."
The No. 3 Bruins started slow
ly this season, losing three of
their first six dual matches. But
UCLA is coming on strong, win
ning its last eight contests. Since
losing to No. 4 Duke 4-3 in
February, the Bruins have beat
en three top-10 squads.
"They are good," Brennan
said. "They certainly deserve it.
They are young, but they are
coming together. This is the best
team we play at home this sea
son. I think all of the matches are
going to be close."
UCLA is fresh off a 6-3 win
over No. 8 Pepperdine, whom the
Cardinal defeated over spring
break, 8-1.
The UCLA roster features
four fresh faces, with the Bruins
returning only two singles
starters from last year's NCAA
semifinal squad. The Bruins are
led by sophomore Kati Kocsis,
currently the No. 9 singles play
er in the nation. Kocsis boasts a
19-11 overall record but is just

5-6 playing against top competi
tion at the No. 1 spot. Kocsis will
likely meet Osterloh this after
noon.
"They are not really new to us,
because we have seen them all
season at various tournaments,"
Brennan said.
Stanford senior Katie
Schlukebir will defend her No. 1
singles ranking at the No. 3 spot
versus Annica Cooper (10-4).
Also contributing to UCliA's
success in singles has been new
comer Katia Roubanova, a fresh
man who joined the team in Jan
uary. Roubanova has put up a 10-
1 record playing at the No. 5 spot,
where she will face Stanford All-
American Ania Bleszynski.
"Roubanova came in midsea
son," Brennan said. "And she is a
very solid singles and doubles
player, so that was a very good
get for them."
It is perhaps in doubles that
the Cardinal has the biggest
advantage. The No. 2 Stanford
team of Bleszynski and junior co
captain Julie Scott currently sit
atop the rankings in collegiate
