A newly rejuvenated Stanford Softball team look. l
to solidify its position as one of the best in the I'acif
ic 10 Conference this weekend by winning its game?
against conference rivals Oregon and Oregon Slate
The Cardinal plays both teams at home, the Beaver*
Saturday at 1 p.m. and the Ducks at the same tinu
on Sunday.
Stanford is coming off a strong spring break
series, winning five out of eight contests against a
number of extremely competitive teams. Offensive
production that had been missing in many of flu
team's losses earlier in the season was increasingly
consistent.
Some of the offensive stars over break included
sophomore Kelly Yablonski, freshman Kellie Wigin
ton and senior Amanda Renteria. All three players
had multiple-hit games and provided clutch hits,
either driving in runs or getting on base for others to
bring them in. One of the most encouraging features
of the Cardinal offense over the break was the dis
persion of production from the top of the hatting
order to the bottom.
The improving Cardinal bats, combined with the
relatively weak pitching staff of both Oregon teams,
bodes well for the Card. Expect to see Stanford puf
up enough runs to support its outstanding sopho
more pitching duo of Becky Blevins and Many
Crouch.
Crouch has been particularly impressive of late,
both as a hitter and against other batters, a: well. I n
the contest versus second-ranked UCLA, she shut
down the Bruin offense to help the Card notch an
incredible upset victory. Crouch also leads the team
in several offensive categories, including home run
The team cannot take either team for granted,
though. Both field solid offenses and are capable of
exploiting weak pitching. Yet there is no reason why
the Cardinal should be unable contain either attack,
especially if the defense behind Stanford's pitchers
stays solid.
"Even though (Oregon) was easy earlier, they've
made progress. So even (this weekend] will be good
games," Wiginton said.
Glove work has clearly been n problem, as t he team
