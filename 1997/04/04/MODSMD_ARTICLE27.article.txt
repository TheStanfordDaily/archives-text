## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Competing for a bid to nationals just two weeks
away, the women's gymnastics team is off to Poise,
Idaho, for the NCAA regional championship,
where it will face six other talented squads.
Tomorrow night, the Card could walk away as
champions of the competitive West region, which
consists of No. ti UCLA, No. 14 Washington, No.
20 Oregon State, Cal State-Fullerton, California
and Boise State.
While the winning team will receive an auto
matic bid to the NCAA national championship,
seven wildcards will qualify as the top scoring
teams of the five regions put together. Last year,
the Card placed third at regionals hut scored high
enough to receive the wildcard invitation.
According to sophomore all-arounder Tracey
Kohl, the goal at regionals for the Card this year is
"not to just qualify, hut to win regionals."
The Stanford squad, resetting school records
throughout the year, has been unstoppable and
last month came home as runner-up of the Pacific
10 championship. The Pac-10 is considered by
many to be the toughest conference in the country,
and the close second-place finish has left the Stan
ford gymnasts more fired up for the postseason
than ever.
UCLA, which took the Pac-10 title over the
Card by just 0.02f> points, remains the only team to
which the Cardinal owes a loss this season. Coach
Lisa Izzi said she thinks her squad could attain
sweet revenge tomorrow and make its way to
nationals.
"We are at a good state," she said. "We should
he able to go out there and do well." Izzi added she
expects the Cardinal to peak (his weekend and
maintain the high all the way to nationals.
According to Izzi, the point of the game is to
remain confident and relaxed. As long as each
member of the squad pulls through and executes
her best routines, the Card may well be looking at
Western gold.
Although the Cardinal is going to the meet with
a serious disadvantage of having lost junior co-cap
tain Keri Monahan to an injury tlie day before Pac
10s, the Stanford gymnasts also have full confi
dence in their own ability to come out on top.
"We are ready — 100 percent," Kohl said.
"UCLA is definitely within our reach."
Monahan, who suffered a severe sprained ankle,
will not be able to fully partake in the competition.
According to Izzi, Monahan is scheduled to com
pete on the uneven bars, an event which will give
almost no direct pressure on the injury aside from

the pounding landing.
Izzi added that there is a slim
chance Monahan will compete
on the vault and beam as well,
depending on how well her ankle
holds after two weeks of not
practicing rigorously.
According to athletic trainer
Perry Archibald, Monahan's
recovery is "quicker than aver
age," although still far from
healed. Both Izzi and Archibald
said they expect Monahan to
have healed enough by nationals
to be able at least partly to par
ticipate.
In the meantime, sophomore
Katie Fitzpatrick will be step
ping up to take Monahan's place
on the beam, while junior
Christie Jones will replace the
injured captain on the vault for
regional competition.
Freshman Tara LaMorte will
also be filling in for Monahan on
the floor.
Sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami, who took the title at
last year's regional competition

as an all-arounder, is expected to
lead the Cardinal with Monahan
absent.
According to Murakami, the
team is "looking good" aside
from a few minor injuries which
haunt any team toward the end
of a tough season of going up
against the nation's best on a
weekly basis.
"Your body knows what to do
by now," she said. "We're just
going to have fun, go all out, and
do awesome."
Murakami added that unlike
the Pac-10 meet, in which the
Stanford gymnasts were coming
out of finals, the squad should be
well rested and better set to go.
"This is the time to work it,"
Murakami said. "If there's one
time to go out there and just do
it, this is it."
The Card is scheduled to put
up Murakami, freshman rookie
Larissa Fontaine, Fitzpatrick
and Kohl in the all-around cate
gory.
Other gymnasts expected to
cause a stir in Boise are fresh
man Annie Thanaopavarn on
the vault, freshman Sarah Hard
ing on the floor and junior Amy
Neil on bars.
