Competing for a bid to nationals just two weeks
away, the women's gymnastics team is off to Poise,
Idaho, for the NCAA regional championship,
where it will face six other talented squads.
Tomorrow night, the Card could walk away as
champions of the competitive West region, which
consists of No. ti UCLA, No. 14 Washington, No.
20 Oregon State, Cal State-Fullerton, California
and Boise State.
While the winning team will receive an auto
matic bid to the NCAA national championship,
seven wildcards will qualify as the top scoring
teams of the five regions put together. Last year,
the Card placed third at regionals hut scored high
enough to receive the wildcard invitation.
According to sophomore all-arounder Tracey
Kohl, the goal at regionals for the Card this year is
"not to just qualify, hut to win regionals."
The Stanford squad, resetting school records
throughout the year, has been unstoppable and
last month came home as runner-up of the Pacific
10 championship. The Pac-10 is considered by
many to be the toughest conference in the country,
and the close second-place finish has left the Stan
ford gymnasts more fired up for the postseason
than ever.
UCLA, which took the Pac-10 title over the
Card by just 0.02f> points, remains the only team to
which the Cardinal owes a loss this season. Coach
Lisa Izzi said she thinks her squad could attain
sweet revenge tomorrow and make its way to
nationals.
"We are at a good state," she said. "We should
he able to go out there and do well." Izzi added she
expects the Cardinal to peak (his weekend and
maintain the high all the way to nationals.
According to Izzi, the point of the game is to
remain confident and relaxed. As long as each
member of the squad pulls through and executes
her best routines, the Card may well be looking at
Western gold.
Although the Cardinal is going to the meet with
a serious disadvantage of having lost junior co-cap
tain Keri Monahan to an injury tlie day before Pac
10s, the Stanford gymnasts also have full confi
dence in their own ability to come out on top.
"We are ready â€” 100 percent," Kohl said.
"UCLA is definitely within our reach."
Monahan, who suffered a severe sprained ankle,
will not be able to fully partake in the competition.
According to Izzi, Monahan is scheduled to com
pete on the uneven bars, an event which will give
almost no direct pressure on the injury aside from
