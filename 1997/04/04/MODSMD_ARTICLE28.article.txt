# Golfers seek par at Ping

### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Tiger Woods couldn't par the Karsten
Golf Course when he was a freshman at
Stanford, lint the Stanford women's golf
team is hoping to do just that and maybe
even slip in ;i few birdies when it plays the
first round of the Ping / ASH Invitational
t< iday.
The Ib roe tou nd tournament is hosted
by third ranked Arizona State, who won
the tournament last year.
The Karsten Golf Course, set in
Tempo, Ari/,., is known to be tempera
mental and can challenge the patience
and mental stamina of any skilled golfer.
Tricky water holes and deep traps creep
up everywhere.
"There's a few tough holes, like the
!)(h, that you really have to think about,"
said senior Mhairi McKay. The Stanford
team co-captain, who tied for first at last

year's I'ing/ASU Tournament with an
average of 72, will seek to clinch top hon
ors again this weekend.
The course, named after Ping CEO
Karsten Solheim, once served as a wash
to catch the desert rain. Thousands of
tons of topsoil and sand were shipped in
to create the course's temperamental,
moon I ike characteristics.
Sand traps are so deep they look like
craters. The course itself is bumpy, hilly
and undulated. The elevated greens run
hard and fast.
The last three holes are particularly
trying. The Kith hole starts with an
intimidating view of a very small green
surrounded by enormous water holes.
While the wind moves diagonally on
the 16th hole, players hit balls straight
into strong winds on the 17th. The land
scaping can also be difficult to adjust to.
Golf balls fly over flat terrain,
sloping valleys and water holes
before plopping onto the safety of
the green. And the narrow driving
area of the 18th hole tests the
accuracy of players.
Still, the par 72 course, at
6,090 yards, will provide plenty of
opportunities to play aggressively
on other holes and shoot low
scores. But the penalty of not
being careful can cost good birdie
opportunities, McKay cautioned.
The team will have to play
aggressively if it hopes to win the
tournament and be a strong
NCAA contender.
The Card is setting its goal to
win the national championship.
The team boasts two seniors
ranked in GolfStat's intercolle

giate women's top 10.
The Stanford team has won
three major tournaments since
October, including the Rolex Match
Play Championship. But after it
won its first tournament at the
start of the NCAA season last quar
ter, the Cardinal began to slip,
posting mediocre scores at its past
two tournaments.
The bad spell came when one
of Stanford's top players, senior
co-captain Andrea Baxter, suf
fered a wrist injury. The fifth
ranked Card, which dropped
from its second-ranked position,
has struggled to adjust to Bax
ter's absence in its past two
tournaments.
Baxter, who broke her wrist in
a February snowboarding acci
dent, may be ready to play in next
weekend's Peg Barnard California
Collegiate Tournament hosted by
Stanford.
While Baxter has not been

able to practice her full swing in
more than a month, she has
worked on extensive short game
drills.
"When she's ready tc play, she
just may be the best putter out
there," said head coach Caroline
O'Connor during a recent inter
view.
Though Baxter will sit out this
tournament, the team feels confi
dent and prepared.
Four of the Cardinal team's
golfers spent spring break practic
ing in LaQuinta, the site of last
year's NCAA tournament, where
Stanford finished fifth.
The players anticipate facing
similar windy and hot condi
tions as they faced in Palm
Springs.
"We've had a good practice over
break. We know we're better than
the other teams out there," said
freshman Jae Jean Ro. "We're
going out there to kick ass."
