Tiger Woods couldn't par the Karsten
Golf Course when he was a freshman at
Stanford, lint the Stanford women's golf
team is hoping to do just that and maybe
even slip in ;i few birdies when it plays the
first round of the Ping / ASH Invitational
t< iday.
The Ib roe tou nd tournament is hosted
by third ranked Arizona State, who won
the tournament last year.
The Karsten Golf Course, set in
Tempo, Ari/,., is known to be tempera
mental and can challenge the patience
and mental stamina of any skilled golfer.
Tricky water holes and deep traps creep
up everywhere.
"There's a few tough holes, like the
!)(h, that you really have to think about,"
said senior Mhairi McKay. The Stanford
team co-captain, who tied for first at last

year's I'ing/ASU Tournament with an
average of 72, will seek to clinch top hon
ors again this weekend.
The course, named after Ping CEO
Karsten Solheim, once served as a wash
to catch the desert rain. Thousands of
tons of topsoil and sand were shipped in
to create the course's temperamental,
moon I ike characteristics.
Sand traps are so deep they look like
craters. The course itself is bumpy, hilly
and undulated. The elevated greens run
hard and fast.
The last three holes are particularly
trying. The Kith hole starts with an
intimidating view of a very small green
surrounded by enormous water holes.
While the wind moves diagonally on
the 16th hole, players hit balls straight
into strong winds on the 17th. The land
scaping can also be difficult to adjust to.
