# No. 4 netters host Coyotes
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Coming off this week's victories over No 6
Hawaii, a series in which the Cardinal wrapped up
the Pacific Division title of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation for the first time since 1994, the
No. 4 Stanford men s volleyball team heads into
tomorrow night's match against Cal State-San
Bernadino riding a wave of momentum.
The team is perfect at home this season and has
not lost a match since a March 7 defeat at the hands
of UCLA. Although the Coyotes will look to stop
Stanford s string of eight straight victories, they
should pose little problem for the Card.
Simply put, Cal State-San Bernadino is not the
most competitive team. Although the Coyotes are a
Division I squad, they have struggled against club
teams this year. On March 28, Sacramento State, a
club team, gave the Coyotes fits in a five-game
marathon, 8-15, 14-16, 16-14, 15-12, 15-13.
Although the Coyotes managed a win, they looked
pretty bad against Sacramento State, which makes
the match against a more talented Stanford squad
seem that much more ominous. Barring a miracu
lous improvement by the Coyotes, Stanford should
roll.
San Bernadino comes into tomorrow night's
match, at Burnham Pavilion at 7 p.m., with an offi
cial record of 4-7. Wins over club teams like the
Aggies do not count. Although weak, the Coyotes
have managed a few memorable performances. Fore
most among these have been a five-game victory over
George Mason University, an Eastern team, and a
loss to No. 1 UCLA in which they were able to take
one game away from the powerful Bruins.
Indeed, if San Bernadino is to have any hope of
remaining in contention even briefly, it will have to
rely heavily upon the tandem of junior outside hitter
Joe Mullen and junior middle blocker Jason Miner.
Miner leads the Coyotes with 5.56 kills per game and
Mullen is close behind with 4.35. However, these two
will need career nights to overcome being physically
overmatched by Stanford's imposing front line.
While the Cardinal may not be highly challenged,
the contest should provide Stanford an opportunity
to play some of the many talented players who rarely
see playing time in the Cardinal's tougher matches.
Foremost among these are junior outside hitter
Devin Poolman and junior middle blocker Tad Hoff
man.
Both Poolman and Hoffman played a good deal
earlier in the year, coming off the bench in a number
of Stanford victories, most notably in Stanford's stir
ring comeback against USC and in a strong win over
Indiana Purdue-Fort Wayne. However recently,
Stanford has stuck with its six starters very consis
tently, not really needing to look elsewhere for help.
"I hope that we are able to come out strong
