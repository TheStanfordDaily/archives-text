# Men try to unseat Bruins

The No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team travels
south today to embark upon one of its toughest road
trips of the season, taking on the Trojans of USC
today and the No. 1 UCLA Bruins tomorrow.
"We are looking to have two tough, competitive
matches," said head coach Dick Gould.
Coming off a solid ousting of ninth-ranked Pep
perdine last Tuesday at Stanford, the Card is into
what Gould calls "the nitty-gritty part of the sea
son." While the squad currently boasts an impres
sive 15-1 record, the next few weeks will be essential
preparation for the NCAA championships in late
May.
"Both USC and UCLA have some new talent this
year," Gould said.
"USC has live new players, and UCLA has three
new guys, so it will be interesting. We have not real
ly seen any of the USC guys play, except a few who
traveled to the doubles championships in La Jolla."
Stanford has had tough competition with both
the Bruins and Trojans. In the new rankings which
came out April 1, UCLA remained the No. 1 ranked

team in the nation and is currently on a 17-match
win streak with a season record of 18-1.
USC has a young, but talented squad, as it lost
five of its six starters at the end of last season,
including the 1996 NCAA singles champion, top
ranked Cecil Mammitt, who only completed his
freshman year but decided to jump to the pro
ranks.
USC was not predicted to have a top-notch pro
gram this year, conspicuously absent from the top
20 in the preseason rankings. However, the talent of
the young Trojan team appears to have been under
estimated, as it comes off its recent upset of No. 22
Fresno State, snapping the Bulldogs 34-mateh
home winning streak.
"There is definitely a home court advantage in
tennis, and it will be good for us to Ret a chance to
see USC and UCLA's players and get to know them
better at this point in the season," Gould said.
While Stanford may not be playing its strongest
lineup with junior AU-American Paul Goldstein
still sidelined with a stress fracture, checking out
the two squads may be just what Stanford needs
