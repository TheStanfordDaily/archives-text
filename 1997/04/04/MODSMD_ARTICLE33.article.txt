As students return from spring break with
renewed enthusiasm about classes and college life,
the men's and women's ultimate Frisbee teams
have returned with a renewed intensity and sights
on national championships.
The second-ranked men's team put in many
hours of hard work during the break. The squad
competed in two tournaments and committed itself
to what the team refers to as "spring training."
The women, also ranked second nationally,
played a match against Carleton, one of the top
ranked teams in the country, boat ing the Knights
17-I'J. It was a very competitive match and one of
the Card's first opportunities to prove the legitima
cy of its high ranking, as the competition against
1. : 1 ..» ~. ot been very intense.
" I bin was pretty important since it was our first
real test against a college team," said junior Martita
Emde.
Over the first weekend of spring break, the men
went to San Diego for a club tournament and fin
ished with a 3-3 record. The squad, didn't face any
college teams.
"Our purpose was mainly to have fun," said co
captain Jim Schoettler.
During the second weekend of break, the men's
team competed in the annual April Fool's tourna
ment held in Santa Cruz, going 3-2. The highlight of
this tournament was its victory against top-ranked
Santa Barbara.

The women competed in the same tournament,
but since they had a large team that consisted of the
current team as well as a Stanford alumni team, the
competition was a bit disorganized. As a result, the
team was not as successful as it hoped to be, losing
to a very good Santa Cruz team that eventually
made it to the finals.
Both tournaments were open, meaning any team
could participate. Often the competition is much
more difficult in these tournaments, with veiy
skilled players who are often not eligible for colle
giate play.
"This is sort of the professional side of ultimate
Frisbee," Schoettler said.
Between their two tournaments, (lit* men trained
in Palm Springs, staying at the Smoke Tree Ranch.
According to coach and senior co-captain Christian
Dodge, the setting was posh, but they trained very
hard. A typical day consisted of waking up at H a.m.
and going for a 5-mile run. Then the team would
gather again at 1 1 a.m. for an hour of drills, relaxing
in the afternoon, then training again from 4 until 7
p.m. on community soccer fields.
The team felt that a week of intense practices
was necessary, as it hadn't practiced during Dead
W«H>k and finals week.
"It, was a good time to come together," Dodge
said. "This team has been more solid than in previ
ous years."
The women's team, too, has begun what Emde
