ranked Stanford polo team the
West regional title as the Card
dominated the national qualifying
competition at Ilancho Murieta,
Calif., March 20-23.
After some early trouble with
fouls and a slim halftime lead 10-7,
the Cardinal women's team came
back to piny a fast second half and
beat sixth-ranked USC 25-11 in
the first game. Senior captain Ilia
Christy scored 12 goals, junior
Alexa Christy scored four and
senior Courtney Higgle scored nine
— five of which were made in the
fourth chukker.
The bulk of IJSC's goals were

made from penalty plays, a testa

shots and Stanford's foul troubles.
The women faced No. 2 Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo in the final
game and won easily 2(5-8. The
first half was rougli with a mid

kicked in during the second and
third chukkers, scoring her fifth
and sixth goals, respectively, and
finishing the game with an impres
