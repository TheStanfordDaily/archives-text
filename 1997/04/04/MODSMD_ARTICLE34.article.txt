## Polo fulfills dream, rides past regionals 
### Erin Reilly Staff writer 
Aggressive play earned the top
ranked Stanford polo team the
West regional title as the Card
dominated the national qualifying
competition at Ilancho Murieta,
Calif., March 20-23.
After some early trouble with
fouls and a slim halftime lead 10-7,
the Cardinal women's team came
back to piny a fast second half and
beat sixth-ranked USC 25-11 in
the first game. Senior captain Ilia
Christy scored 12 goals, junior
Alexa Christy scored four and
senior Courtney Higgle scored nine
— five of which were made in the
fourth chukker.
The bulk of IJSC's goals were

made from penalty plays, a testa
ment to USC's skill with penalty
shots and Stanford's foul troubles.
The women faced No. 2 Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo in the final
game and won easily 2(5-8. The
first half was rougli with a mid
way score of I 1.-6, but Ilia Christy
kicked in during the second and
third chukkers, scoring her fifth
and sixth goals, respectively, and
finishing the game with an impres
sive 17 goals.
Higgle had an outstanding
fourth chukker riding her favorite
polo pony, Sant a Rosa. Aboard the
award-winning puny, which was
named the 1995 West Regional
best playing pony, Riggle scored
nine of her 15 goals. Alexa ('hristy,
the younger sister of Ilia, scored a

total of three.
Ilia Christy and Higgle were
elected to the All-star collegiate
polo team as a result of their supe
rior play along with a rider from
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and an
alternate from UC-Santa Barbara.
The men's team shut out the
fifth-seeded Gauchos 24-7 in the
first round with 12 goals hy senior
Jason Knight and six goals each hy
seniors Adam Strom and Jeff
I leeder. The men wont on to a dra
mafic win in sudden death over
time against Washington Slate in
the next round. The men overcame
a three-goal lapse and tied tin
game 15-15 before overtime.
In less than a breath, Strom
passed the ball to I leeder. Knight
took a pass and scorn I the winning

goal, finishing with 10 goals total.
Strom and I leeder totaled three
goals each in t he game.
The face-off with the Cougars
was expected to be a close match,
as last year the two teams tied
once, and Stanford narrowly beat
WSI I at the 1990 regionals.
WSIJ has two "2 goalers" (play
ers rated on a scale of-2 lowest to
10 highest). Stanford's Knight is
rated 0, alt hough according to his
(.earnmates, be plays better than
his rating.
Team captain Knight was elect
ed tot he men's All-star team along
with two Washington players and
an alternate from IJC Davis.
For Knight, the win had special
meaning. Four years ago, he
watched his team lose to WSU by
14 points. And later, he traveled as
an alternate to nationals, but was
unable to play — the team had not
returned since.
"We really deserve this win,"
Knight said. "This team started
out from scratch, and we plowed
our way through. We got here by
busting our butts."
The men and women depart
Monday for Ft. Worth, Texas,
where they will play in the
national collegiate polo finals,
April 6-12.
The Cardinal men enter nation
als ranked fifth and face No. 4 Col
orado State — a team known for a
fast paced game.
If the men prevail, they face
the defending national champi
on, No. 1 Texas A&M. Stanford

lost to the Aggies earlier this
season and is expected to face
stiff opposition from the superi
or squad.
Hanked fourth, the women face
fifth-seed Texas A&M in the first
round, a rematch from earlier in
the season, when the two squads
tied.
"It should be a good game," Ilia
Christy said. "We have a reason
able chance at winning. We can
definitely play better than last
time."
If Stanford prevails, it will face
top-ranked Cornell to reach the
finals. Neither the men nor women
have captured a national title, but
both are optimistic.
Ilia Christy said the greatest
challenge about nationals is the dif
ference in the polo arena.
"The footing is harder and the
boards are different, so the ball
bounces of the ground and against
the boards. You must be able to
react quicker. .. .We have to react
quicker," she said.
