> Q: How do you feel about Big Bird being admitted to the Class of 2001?


"I think it's enough
with all this show
business people
getting in."


"I'd rather find feathers in my
shower than nasty crumbs of
hair that women leave in my
dorm."


"This guy's got a
definite element of
diversity to add to the
community."


"Big Bird is cool as long
as he doesn't sit in
front of me in class."


"I just like his
feathers."
