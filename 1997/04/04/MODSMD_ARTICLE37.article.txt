# THE 						SECRET DIARIES OF AIMEE THANA TOGENOS!
## THIS WEEK: 'My Conversion to Judaism!â€™ 
### 
This spring break, on a Monday afternoon,
sometime between watching the Rosie O'Donnell
show and clipping my toenails, I had what laymen
refer to as an "onset spiritual conversion," and I
decided to convert to Judaism. I already have the

accent to go with
it.
I have been
dissatisfied with
my current reli
gion, Buddhism,
because it clashes
with my fashion
sense and I don't
look good in pas
tels. For a while I
was an agnostic,

but it became
increasingly hard
to explain to
friends what that

Beau Applewhite was the
leader of the cult responsible
for the plague and Brooke
Shields' career.

meant, even with the visual
illustration of me throwing my
body forward while sitting
down, pretending I was hurl
ing. (One day 1 gave myself
whiplash and found God. I also
found a Susan R. Anthony
under the couch, but that's
another story.)
I've been monodeist for
three years, although for a
while, at an earlier time, when
1 was a naive and nubile little

thing just off the bus and ready to be grabbed by
a cult of religious fanatics, I did toy with t he whole
Greek-Roman polygamous tradition. I even
bought a book with lots of color drawings explain
ing who was who and who did what to whom and
when.
That infatuation didn't last very long. I
couldn't take these gods seriously, especially after
seeing Ursula Andress play Aphrodite and Lau
rence Olivier play Zeus in that awful "Clash of the
Titans" movie. Myself I've always seen Aphro as
more of a Vanessa Redgrave type, but then again
I have a bias for Vanessa since she's a Zionist, and
I'm a neonist, and our child could be a Post-Mod
ernist.
So yes, I was lying on the ground, hall-con
scious, having eaten a whole sausage without
mustard, thinking about that horrible Heaven's
(late cult mass suicide, wondering why those men
had followed the words of a bald, bug-eyed, long
winded old fool when they could've just followed

me and had a really good time at my place.
And then it just hit me. A really large, oval
shaped lamp. And after that, something else hit
me. An idea. I should join a religion. First,
inspired by all those supermarket chains giving
away free Farmer Cook's hams (with the mini
mum purchase of $50) for Faster Sunday con
sumption, I thought of jumping onto Catholicism.
But then I thought of what that religion had
done for Madonna, that indecent freak. Judaism,
on the other hand, had produced that nice, funny
girl Barbra Streisand. I'm not one to take my
choice of religion lightly (I struggled awake for
many hours that night, pondering my decision,
though the sleeplessness might've been caused by
that piece of livestock I had as a snack), but after
reading Babs' unauthorized biography, I realized
that if I couldn't have her money, her talent or her
repulsively large nose, then at least 1 could have
her religion.
After this wonderful religious revelation, 1
smoked a nice long Joe Camel and made several
resolutions for spring quarter. One, I will no
longer call up random people and ask, "Have you
seen my cow? Are you sure you have not seen my
cow?" Two, I shall no longer show up at office
hours dressed as a Pillsbury muffin and expect my
professors to bite me. And three, most important
ly, I will stop trying to stick long words like "pros
thetic" and "haberdash" into my everyday conver
sations. I will, however, continue to use the word
"Swahili" at will and yes, 1 will brush my legs
against yours under the table.
Of course, I'm not sure how my gentile friends

will react to my con
version to Judaism,
though I suspect
most of them will
simply ignore me as
usual and deliver
some snotty stan
dard response, like
"I told you so!" or "I
knew it all along."
Actually, I don't
care what my
friends say. Ever
since I told them I
have an incurable
mental disease they

have been
as nice to
me as my
leper's
skin and

UNCUT!
UNCENSORED!
UNCIRCUMSIZED!

palsied
hand will allow.
So yes, I am very comfortable with my new
found religious identity. 1 feel like this is some
thing I'm serious about, and not just a silly little
contretemps like my past obsession with feet odor
or my misguided collection of David Cassidy hair
pieces.
Babs, I'm on my way!
NEXT WEEK:
'My life as an tpileptic!'
