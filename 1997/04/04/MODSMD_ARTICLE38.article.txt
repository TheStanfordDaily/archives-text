# Huston tried. So did Lean. But only one man could bring James Joyce alive on the screen: Woody Allen!

Trying to move past the scandal involving his relationship with Soon-Yi
Prevm, director Woody Allen shocked some with the announcement
of his newest film project, a literary adaptation of one of James
Joyce's short stories, Araby. Even more surprising was the
announcement that he has cast himself in the lead role, a teenage hoy com
ing of age in turn-of the-century Ireland. Diane Keaton is slated to co-star as
the boy's psychiatrist, and Mia Farrow, due to contractual ties, is set to play
the boy's conscience. Here's a scene from the script:
WOODY ALLEN: (Facing the camera, speaking directly to the audience.) I
don't know how to say this — it's a little embarrassing to be sharing with all
you people, some of whom I probably owe money to — but I'm 111 love.
MIA FARROW: Why are you so interested in this, this Mangan girl? She only
has only one line in the whole thing. You know, there are so many other
women, Anna Karenma, sure she was a little depressed at the end.
ALLEN: No, none of those literary types, OK? Last time I asked for one of
those 1 got stuck with Emily Dickinson. Yeah, a real morbid first date, she
was. She kept trying to suffocate herself with the tablecloth.
(ARROW: Maybe I'm trying to protect you from rejection. I just don't

think you should ask her out.
Alt I N: Why? Why not? Is it because I'm not attractive, because I'm

not some muscle-bound Robert Redford? So is that it? I'm gonna let
some genetic accident preventing me from finding the love of my life? Just
'cause I'm not handsome?

EARROW: No, no, no, it's not because you're not handsome.
Al LEN: W-w-well, then, is it because I'm still a kid and I don't have a job and
still live with my kind relatives?
FARROW: No, no, no, no, it's not because you don't have a job or because
you're illegitimate.
ALIEN: Wow, wow, that's a long word. Did you have to get a Ph.D. to get to
say that? Illegitimate, gitimate, sounds like a dyslexic 5-year-old trying to
read Kafka.
FARROW: You know, sometimes you're so obnoxious. I may be just a figment
of your imagination, but I have feelings too. I just think, I don't know, I mean,
I just, you know, there was a time when you were nice and I didn't mind being
your conscience, but lately, I mean ...
ALLEN: W-w-w-when was that? When I was 4? I had some pretty nasty
thoughts when I was 4. Remember that Swedish babysitter? Yeah, well, you
know, let me iust say. I was an earlv riser. Just vour recuilar Casanova.

FARROW: I don't know, I don't think I

can help you, this love thing is so com
plicated.

ALLEN: Yeah, yeah, I know. Love is the main

reason why they created prescription medicine,
but you knew that right?

AUNT: (Interrupting, disembodied voice) Buy her a pot!

ALLEN: W-w-what, who just said that?

AUNT: This is your aunt speaking; I'm on the left side of the brain.
ALLEN: And what did you just say?
AUNT: Go to the bazaar and buy her a pot. She'll think it's exotic. She'll fall in
your arms in no time.
ALLEN: Wa-wa-what are you talking about? A pot? Why don't I just get
extravagant and buy her a toilet seat?
UNCLE: (Equally disembodied) That's right. The whole idea is ridiculous.
ALLEN: Thank you. Wait, who're you?
UNCLE: I'm your uncle. I'm supposed to be on the left side too, but your aunt
and I had a fight. About the pot. Don't do it. She'll think you're trying to buy
her love.

ALLEN: Is that right, left? What are you people all doing up there? Is there
some party going on? I mean, should I leave, give you guys some privacy?
My goodness, is anyone else up there? Maybe Jimmy Hoffa?
AUNT: Just trying to give you advice. Don't give me attitude.
ALLEN: Well, you know, I feel like I should be able to do this on my own. I'm
gonna go to the shop and buy her something, and I'll charge it to your cred
it card, so you can make yourselves useful. And try not to step on my gray
cells. I need them for when I'm 80 and quoting fortune cookies at a retire
ment home and questioning the value of abstinence.
ALLEN: So now I'm at the bazaar, looking at some jars, and the saleslady
won't help me. I think she's anti-Semitic, and the irony of it does not escape
me because I'm really Irish.
SALESLADY: Can I help ya, boy?
ALLEN: You know, you remind me of my ex-wife. She too used to ask me that,
in the exact same tone.
SALESLADY: Listen, I've been stuck saying the same three lines for 10 years.
It's 1914 now, and they still haven't published this thing. How do you think I
feel?
ALLEN: Don't worry, don't worry. You're gonna become a part of world liter
ature. Scholars in the future will be debating what those three lines meant,
though I know it probably just meant you grew up in California.
SALESLADY: Oh, whatever.
ALLEN: Yeah, yeah, so now I'm sitting by myself, which, metaphysically
speaking, is quite frightening to me. And I look up and all the lights are gone.
I gaze into the darkness and I wonder if there's a God, and if so, why he gave
us so much suffering and how can he account for the existence of Richard
Simmons and Tammy Eaye Bakker. There are two states of living, one is pain
and the other is agony. The only difference is that when you're in pain, you
can still get to second base. And, is there life after death, and if so, does that
deny the possibility of foreplay? I look at myself, and my hair is falling, and
my ears are protruding. I see myself as this creature driven and derided by
vanity, and my eyes burn with anguish and anger. God, I need some eye
drops.
