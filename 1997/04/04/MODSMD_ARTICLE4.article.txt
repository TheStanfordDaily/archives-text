Ever wonder what you can do with a history degree?
Later this quarter, an expert will be on campus to tell
you.
Christopher Avery, a 1974 Stanford graduate with
honors in history, is the spring quarter alumni visiting
mentor at the Haas Center for Public Service.
After working for more than 10 years at the Interna
tional Secretariat of Amnesty International in London,
Avery has been pursuing an independent research pro
ject. The project seeks to establish a new international
organization that would monitor the socially responsi
ble activities — or lack thereof — of corporations. The

organization would focus on poverty alleviation, educa
tion, health, child welfare, women's issues, environ
mental protection and human rights.
"Through his human rights work, Avery has become
interested in socially responsible business practices in
the developing world," said Debra Solomon, student co
director of the Visiting Mentor Program. "We felt that
students have become more and more interested in bow
businesses can act responsibly, especially with the pro
posed creation of the Stanford socially responsible en
dowment fund and the debate over Taeo Hell and Pep
siCo's involvement in Burma."
