# Visiting mentor Christopher Avery to come to Haas Center
## 
### Clara Kim 
Ever wonder what you can do with a history degree?
Later this quarter, an expert will be on campus to tell
you.
Christopher Avery, a 1974 Stanford graduate with
honors in history, is the spring quarter alumni visiting
mentor at the Haas Center for Public Service.
After working for more than 10 years at the Interna
tional Secretariat of Amnesty International in London,
Avery has been pursuing an independent research pro
ject. The project seeks to establish a new international
organization that would monitor the socially responsi
ble activities — or lack thereof — of corporations. The

organization would focus on poverty alleviation, educa
tion, health, child welfare, women's issues, environ
mental protection and human rights.
"Through his human rights work, Avery has become
interested in socially responsible business practices in
the developing world," said Debra Solomon, student co
director of the Visiting Mentor Program. "We felt that
students have become more and more interested in bow
businesses can act responsibly, especially with the pro
posed creation of the Stanford socially responsible en
dowment fund and the debate over Taeo Hell and Pep
siCo's involvement in Burma."

Avery "has a lot of different
professional experiences to offer,"
Solomon said. "He has a great deal
of insight to offer students about
issues like human rights that he's
dealt with professionally but also
in terms of personal choices about
careers and the future."
Jackie Schmidt-Posner, staff co
director of the program, said she
sees Avery as a "helpful role model"
for students, especially undergrad
uates.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Avery received law degrees
from UC-Davis and Columbia Uni
versity. Avery will put his legal ex
pertise to use by meeting with
groups on campus including the
Graduate School of Business's
public management group, the
Law School, the Institute for Inter
national Studies and the Stanford
Amnesty International chapter.
Planned activities include a
workshop on International careers
in public service, a forum on inter
national development and a discus
sion about public interest law.
There will also be a lunch during
which Avery will talk about how

his background in history helped
his career and an informal presen
tation of Avery's recent work in de
veloping nations.
"We hope he can be inspiring
and freeing," Schmidt-Posner said.
Students should be able to identify
with Avery because many of his ca
reer decisions were influenced by
his experiences at Stanford, she
added.
"He's very articulate and reflec
tive about his experiences,"
Schmidt-Posner said. "We chose
him because we feel he can really
connect to a wide variety of stu
dents."
The Alumni Visiting Mentor
Program, jointly sponsored with
the Stanford Alumni Association,
is an "ongoing program that's
meant to connect alumni with stu
dents," according to Suzanne
Abel-Vidor, development and ex
ternal relations coordinator at the
Haas Center.
"We're really excited about this
particular visit because Chris is so
much looking forward to meeting
with the students," Abel-Vidor
said.
Avery will be on campus from
April 28 through May 2. To arrange

Solomon or Jackie Schmidt-Posner
