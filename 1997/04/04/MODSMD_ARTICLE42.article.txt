# Crew crushes opponents

While most Stanford stu
dents spent spring break sleep
ing and relaxing, the Stanford
men's and women's crew teams
had little opportunity to do
either, as both endured two-a
day practices and began their
competitive racing season.
The women's team began
two weeks ago as it faced its
first competition in a dual meet
with Santa Barbara. Racing on
its home course at Redwood
Shores, the team cruised to a
convincing win in the various
divisions. All four eight-person
boats, women's varsity and
junior varsity, and the two
novice boats, won handily. The
novice B boat finished with a
remarkable winning margin of
52 seconds. The junior varsity
and novice four-person boats
also pulled out wins.
Stanford continued its sea
son tune-up with a scrimmage
race against the Marin Masters
Crew Club Team. The varsity
boat challenged the Masters'
men, and won, with the junior
varsity boat racing against the
Marin B team. Novice A and B
boats competed against the

Marin C boat, and finished
first and second in the race.
The second place finish by
novice B avenged a loss that it
suffered two weeks ago against
Marin.
The women also went up
against UC-Davis this past
weekend. The Aggies presented
the Cardinal with a greater
level of competition, but both
the women's varsity and junior
varsity fared well. The novice
eight-person boats struggled
but gained some valuable expe
rience from the race. The
novice B boat finished strong,
ahead of the UC-Davis C boat.
The Stanford men also took
on UC-Santa Barbara two
weeks ago, with the varsity
men and novice A boats pulling
out a win. However, the junior
varsity and novice B boats were
not as lucky, finishing behind
the Gauchos.
Against UC-Davis, the Stan
ford men's varsity and junior
varsity continued their win
ning streaks. Joining them
with a surprising upset, the
novice A boat beat both the
Aggies A boat, as well as the
Davis junior varsity boat.
Both crew teams will be
traveling to San Diego this

weekend to compete in the San
Diego Crew Classic. They will
be confronted with a signifi
cant challenge as they race
against some of the east coast
powerhouses. The women's
varsity boat will be looking to
take out perennial west coast
power Washington, as well as
other top East Coast crews
from Michigan and Yale.
All of the preliminary heats
will be held tomorrow, with
usually the top two finishers in
each heat advancing to the
finals, which will be held Sun
day.
"We've been training really
hard, and Stanford usually
produces one of the top teams
on the West Coast," said fresh
man Anne-Caroline Gamier,
who felt confident about the
regatta this weekend.
"Our training schedule has
been intense all year, and
spring break gave us the
chance to focus all our energy
into moving our boats â€” eight
rowers and a coxswain truly
becoming a single entity," Gar
nier said. "The competitive
season is here, and we are
ready, psyched and have every
intention of pulling our bow
ball over the finish line first."
