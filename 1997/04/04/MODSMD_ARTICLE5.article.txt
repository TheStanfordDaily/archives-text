# Coleman to be new ASSU financial manager
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
A funny thing happened to Don Coleman on
the way to Wall Street: He finally found a place
to call home.
Coleman, a senior economics major, was
confirmed by unanimous vote at Tuesday's
ASSU Senate meeting as the successor to .John
Hall as ASSU financial manager next year. By
accepting the job, Coleman passed up lucrative
investment banking jobs in New York and San
Francisco.

The choice was not difficult, he said. "I want
to be an entrepreneur for a year," he said.
Working at Stanford "is a much better experi
ence."
Next year, Coleman will begin his third year
working for Stanford Student Enterprises, the
financial arm of the ASSU. Considering his self
described "nomadic" childhood, which con
tained so many moves Coleman has difficulty
deciding on one place to call home, those three
years represent a significant commitment.
It is a commitment Coleman cherishes, hav
ing fallen in love with Stanford since transfer

ring from Harvey Mudd College in 1994. "I
have a great appreciation for this place," he
said.
In his time with the student enterprises,
Coleman moved up from Lecture Notes manag
er to project director — which entails supervis
ing all student enterprise projects - before
beingchosen as next year's financial manager.
He said he has grown to love the organiza
tion. In particular, he likes the balance between
gaining career experience and helping others to
learn about the trade.
"You get to be a teacher and a businessman
at the same time," he said.
A four-person panel, consisting of Hall,
ASSU President Bill Shen and senators Emily
Andrus and Doug Natelson, selected Coleman
after conducting a campus-wide search.
The committee, Hall said, took a variety of
factors into consideration when interviewing
candidates. Business experience was a central
factor, but it needed to be complemented by
leadership skills and a clear vision for the stu
dent enterprises.
After a long debate , 1 lall said the committee
chose Coleman based on his strong leadership,
vision and knowledge of the organization.
"We liked his ability to articu
late the educational mission of
Stanford Student Enterprises
within the responsibilities of fi
nancial manager," Mall said. "He
really understands the bigger pic
ture of what SSE is trying to do."
Natelson agreed. "He brought a
lot to the position in terms of man
agement style," he said. "He really
seemed like the kind of person that

would be easy to work with."
The strong pool of applicants
made for a difficult decision. "It
was a tough call," Natelson said.
Now, Coleman is faced with
putting his vision into place, a task
he greets with enthusiasm.
Next year, he wants to continue to
expand the ASSU's financial stability
and increase its educational side by
further developing the office intern
program and creating new projects
— like the Stanford Store which was
aestablished this year — to allow
more students the opportunity to
work with student enterprises.
