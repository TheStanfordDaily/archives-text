# After 2 years as ASSU financial manager, John Hall says leaving is the hardest part
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
John Hall has faced many trials in his two
years as ASSU financial manager, but none
can compare to the challenge of leaving.
"This job," he said, his voice and eyes con
veying a mix of sorrow and fond reflection,

"ha.s been my life for two years."
In his tenure, Hall has played an integral
role in the transformation of the ASSU's fi
nancial office from ASSU Business Projects —
a University-sup; rted organization — to
Stanford Student Enterprises, a financially
independent student group.
Those close to the ASSU say that
he has been remarkably successful.
"John Hall has done an amazingjob
as financial manager," said Danny
Bressler, who has worked with Hall
for more than two years and is cur

rently project manager for the
Stanford Directory. "He leaves be
hind some mighty big shoes to fill."
But for Hall, success has come
not only from the fortunes of the
student enterprises but also from
his own personal development.
"This has been the biggest part
of my Stanford education," he said.
"This opportunity is not something
I woidd have passed up. It's been a
lot of work — you have to make a lot

of sacrifices — but this is the best
job on campus."
He is quick to pass on credit for
the student enterprises' success to
his colleagues. He is impressed by
how hard they work and how much
they care about their jobs, and he
calls them some of the "smartest
and most competent people at Stan
ford."
In part due to his confidence in
his successor, Don Coleman, he car

ries high hopes for the group's fu
ture. Hall will use the future as a
gauge of his own effectiveness as fi
nancial manager because he be
lieves, "half of your success is mea
sured by how well the organization
does after you leave."
After leaving his mark on Stan
ford, John Hall is ready to move on.
"I'm going out to the wide
world," he said, "to seek my for
tune."
