Vibrators named Joltin' .Jelly,
Emerald Twister and Octopus fill
an uninhibited story on sexuality.
Stanford's newest 'zine, Scene,
audaciously opened its inaugural
edition Tuesday with the brazen
story of a man shopping for these
quivering pieces of sexual taboo.
Senior Elisabeth Morse, creator
of the provocative publication,
started work on the project in mid-
January and looked to the maga
zine Ray gun as well as The New
Yorker for inspiration.
Scene has a staff of about 15 stu
dents and will be issued on campus
bimonthly. Morse carries editorial
responsibilities along with sopho
more Liz Chien.
"Scene was created to point you
toward things you might not know
of and to give you new perspec
tives on things you do know
about," Morse said. "Thus, our
graphics and layout will puzzle
and please you, challenge and
tease you."
I,aid-out in an untraditional
fashion, the magazine is filled
with randomly selected fonts and
juxtaposed pictures, spattered
with vertically oriented text, and
includes other unusual designs.
Vibrator illustrations and a
particularly dangerous-looking
paintball gun are just a select few
of these outrageous graphics.
Chien said the publication's
unusual layout is designed to be as
interesting and intriguing as the
text itself. She also commented on
the unusual nature of some of the
stories, divulging that the maga
zine is attempting to make "enter

tainment a little edgier."
Providing more oddity to the al
ready peculiar publication, the
cliched Star Wars motif is used, as
Morse is referred to as the Empress
of Content, Chien is duhl>ed the
Obi-Wan Kenobe of Finances, and
co-workers are called Minions and
Stormtroopers.

'Scene was created to
point you toward things
you might not know of
and to give you new
perspectives on things
you do know about.'

Morse said the staff had tried to
focus on the "overwhelming, the
bizarre, the trendy and the valu
able." She also said the fun and in
formal aspectsof the 'zine provide a
fresh outlook on contemporary so
ciety.
Articles in the first edition of
Scene explore topics that vary from
a paintball review to articles on
fashion, film, music and the Inter
net.
The issue's cover story reviews
coffee the college "drug of
choice" and comes complete with
a chart that critiques the leverage's
quality at various campus loca
tions.
For those interested, the
