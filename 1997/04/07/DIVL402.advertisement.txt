Hello? Anybody there? If the tools of communication have improved so much, how come no one at your bank wants to talk to you?
At Stanford Federal Credit Union, you'll always find friendly people eager to serve you. That's what a credit union is all about.
Sure, we have high-tech services like home banking, but we also have a desire to serve. SFCU is a not-for-profit financial cooperative
that exists only to serve its member-owners. That means we can keep our loan rates low and return high dividends on savings.
If you're reading this, chances are you're eligible to join. Call us today.
You'll find someone at the other end who wants to listen.
