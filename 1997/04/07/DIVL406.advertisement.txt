BEHIND EVERY ACHIEVEMENT
YOU'LL FIND AN
EXTRAORDINARY DRIVE
And inside every drive there are enormous possibilities. After all, we didn't get to be
the biggest name in storage technology by thinking small. That's why we look for people with big ideas
and high expectations for their future. Exceptional talent. New perspectives. Achievers with drive. If
you're ready to make the leap from the challenges of school to those of a career, you won't find more
exciting technology or more diverse possibilities anywhere. Now that's an achievement.
We are seeking interns who are ideally seniors in an undergraduate program or have advanced to a grad
uate program and will be eligible for hire within one year of the internship.
