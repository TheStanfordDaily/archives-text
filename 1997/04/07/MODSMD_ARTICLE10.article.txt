Blizzard slaps Great Plains
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A blizzard shut down
much of the northern Plains yesterday with blind
ing, wind-blown snow and drifts up to 20 feet high,
stranding travelers and making life miserable for
volunteers sandbagging flood-threatened towns.
Hundreds of miles of highways were closed in
Wyoming, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska and
the eastern edge of Montana. Thousands —
including two-thirds of Grand Forks, population
49,000 — were without electricity. Two people
were killed in Wisconsin.
The blowing snow rebuilt drifts that had begun
melting after a winter of record snowfall.
Even North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer, who
asked President Clinton to declare the state a dis
aster area, was snowed in.
Power was cut to most of Grand Forks yester
day and to the entire town of Casselton, about 20

miles west of Fargo. More than 200 of the 1,600
residents kept warm Sunday at the local school,
which has its own power generator. An ambulance
crew organized a truck brigade to rescue trapped
residents.
Redskins owner Cooke dead at 84
WASHINGTON (AP) - Jack Kent Cooke, the
crusty entrepreneur whose Washington Redskins
won three Super Bowls and whose personal life
was the stuff of tabloid headlines, died yesterday
of cardiac arrest. He was 84.
Cooke collapsed Sunday morning at his north
west Washington estate. "When paramedics
arrived ... his heart was not beating," said Dr.
Robert Shesser, emergency room chief at George
Washington University Hospital, where Cooke
was pronounced dead shortly after noon, 35 min
utes after arrival.
