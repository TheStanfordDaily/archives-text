NEW YORK (AP) — Hugh Johnson, a market pro
since Lyndon Johnson was president, decided yester
day to pull some of the $260 million his firm manages
for investors out of the stock market.
That decision was not token lightly. But the mar
ket has been so weak recently that even the most sea
soned Wall Street investors are beginning to whisper
the unthinkable.
"It's a correction," Johnson says. "Now the
question is, is it going to deteriorate into a bear
market?"
Important government figures on employment in
March, due out today, are more critical now than
ever. A stronger-than-expected job picture might
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
again, dampening the economy.
If that's so, the 6 1/2-year bull market may be in
jeopardy. The trouble, of course, is that no one really
knows.

Like many others, Johnson, First Albany Corp.'s
chief investment officer, doesn't think a bear has yet
come knocking. But bear markets are like quicksand,
often hard to recognize until it's too late.
Stocks tend to ebb and (low, but since the fall of
1990 a rising Dow Jones industrial average has been
pretty much a constant. Despite two presidential elec
tions, an uncertain economy, military operations
from Haiti to Bosnia and political scandal, investors
have been consistently rewarded.
The current rise took the Dow from about 2,360 to
a high of 7,085.16 on March 11. It has since lost 8.6
percent — almost completely erasing its gains for the
year. On Thursday, the muex closed at 6,477.35,
down 39.66 points.
Last March was the last time the market had a
case of the jitters, shortly after a February 1996 jobs
report was released that showed real strength. The
Dow tumbled 171 points.
