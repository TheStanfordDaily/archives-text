Will Phi Delta Theta's
campus chapter follow
national alcohol policy?

MOST PEOPLE IN our soci
ety have the same percep
tion of fraternities, an
image reinforced regularly in televi
sion shows and movies but also
based on personal experiences with
fraternities and their members.
They see fraternities as bastions of
proud, very male machismo — a
sort of machismo reliant upon,
among other things, conspicuous
and copious consumption of alcohol.
Those who run the college Greek
movement, however — and by this
we mean not the various chapter
presidents but rather the heads of
the fraternities' national organiza
tions — have a very different view
of the role their fraternities play.
Last week, in announcing that the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity's Gener
al Council — Phi Delt's national
policy body — would ban all alcohol
from its chapters by the year 2000,
council chair Robert Deloian artic
ulated a more noble view of frater
nal life. The "core values" of the
Phi Delts, he said in a statement,
are to promote friendship, academ
ic achievement, community service
and leadership. "Too often, the fra
ternity experience today is defined
by alcohol," he continued. "We risk
losing our purpose."
The experiences of the new, dry
Phi Delt chapters as 2000
approaches will show more defini
tively than ever which conception
of fraternities' roles is the right
one. Perhaps Deloian is correct,
and all individual Phi Delts are
seeking from their organization
are lessons in those lofty values.
But perhaps, as things certainly
seem to the layman, fraternities
exist to provide groups of college
men with places to act like college
men; perhaps these men were
looking for a fun place where they

could be free to scratch themselves
openly, talk about women and reg
ularly have a few drinks.
Which is not to say that there's
anything wrong with that. While
certainly a time for seizing the edu
cational opportunities a university
has to offer, one's college years are
also designed, to a large degree, as a
time to have fun. Even if the only
reason people become Phi Delts —
or members of most any fraternity,
for that matter — is simply to have
a place to act like wild and crazy col
lege guys, very few would object to
that. Furthermore, although there
are other reasons why students join
fraternities — good housing comes
to mind, as does networking —
most if not all members of Stan
ford's chapters would acknowledge
that the partying aspects are cer
tainly important.
It's not clear that individual
chapters will necessarily comply
with the national organization's
alcohol ban. Certainly they're not
pleased by it. "We obviously like the
status quo," Phi Delt President
Benjamin Rada told The Daily last
week. "The way things are, alcohol
is a big part of that." The Phi Delts
could simply ignore the new policy,
as nearly every Stanford fraternity
does with national rules against
kegs at parties. Or they could sim
ply choose to disassociate from its
national organization and its no
alcohol dictate
But it's also possible that Phi
Delt's General Council is right.
Maybe when 2000 arrives, the fra
ternity will go dry, and it will focus
all its energies on the "core values"
of leadership, friendship, academic
excellence and public service.
Maybe Phi Delta Theta will become
another Alpha Phi Omega. But it
seems unlikely and, for the average
student looking for weekend fun,
rather undesirable.
Either way, whether or not 2000
arrives with thriving and alcohol
free Phi Delt chapters will show
whether the real purpose of frater
nities is in fact the more noble one
or the more base one.
