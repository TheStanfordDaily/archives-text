U.S. debate on Middle East is hampered by extremism

IN THEIR THURSDAY letters, Jim
Finsten and Marvin Sommer dismiss
my critique of Israeli settlement con
struction by accusing me — and those
with whom I co-authored my letter —of
supporting the recent wave of Palestini
an violence in the West Rank and Gaza.
Finsten writes: "The crisis is no
longer between Israelis and Palestinians,
Jews and Muslims, secularists and fun
damentalists — it is between those who
want to stop terror and violence and
those who don't." And he ends his letter:
"Which side are you on?"
1 concur with Finsten that the crisis
is no longer a bifurcated one; indeed, it
never was. And it is precisely for this
reason that his question, "Which side
are you on?" is such a simplistic one.
Unfortunately, even since the signing of
the Oslo Accords in September 1993, the
violence in Israel and the West Rank and
Gaza has continued in many forms.
The suicide bombings carried out by
the Hamas movement have tragically
taken the lives of tens of Israeli civilians
in the last year. Yet it is not enough to
categorically condemn these acts of vio
lence, as I have done repeatedly in past

letters to The Daily. It is incumbent
upon the Israeli government and all per
sons concerned with the future of the
peace process to ask what might bring
this cycle of violence to an end and cre
ate conditions for a lasting peace.
As Israeli military analysts have
repeatedly suggested, armed militant
groups like Hamas flourish in the West
Rank and Gaza under conditions of
poverty and hopelessness. Tragically,
since the signing of the Oslo accords,
these conditions have worsened dramati
cally. According to figures recently
released by the United Nations, the
income generated per person in the West
Rank and Gaza declined 38 percent
between 1992 and 1996. At best, Pales
tinian workers are now able to cover
some 60 percent of their families' most
basic needs. Child labor has increased,
and many refugee camps report condi
tions of near starvation.
The U.N. explicitly blames Israel's
military closure for this downward spiral
of poverty. Under the military closure,
which restricts the movement of Pales
tinians into Israel, the number of Pales
tinians working inside Israel dropped

from 150,000 in 1993 to 35,000 in 1996.
The grossly underdeveloped infrastruc
tures of the West Rank and Gaza have
been unable to absorb the unemployed.
While I do fault the Netanyahu gov
ernment for exacerbating the current
crisis in the peace process with its plans
for a new Jewish neighborhood in East
Jerusalem, my assessment of Arafat's
regime is far from "rosy" as Sommer
suggests. As Edward Said and others
have remarked in the Western media,
Arafat's regime has proved to be tragi
cally undemocratic.
Under Arafat's command, the Pales
tinian authority has policed and terror
ized individuals and organizations that
voice political dissension. As in the days
of the pre-Oslo Israeli occupation, Pales
tinian prisoners have died under interro
gation, and censorship has continued.
Rut it should also be noted that Israel
has encouraged Arafat's repressive mea
sures insofar as they are useful mecha
nisms for suppressing Hamas and other
opponents of the Oslo process.
It is precisely the simultaneity of a
critique of Netanyahu and Arafat that
Sommer's and Finsten's reductive

attacks are unable to assimilate. Their
failure to differentiate criticism of Israeli
government policy from an embrace of
terrorism is particularly troubling.
Unfortunately, their attacks exemplify a
persistent blindness in U.S. political dis
course, in which criticism of Israeli poli
cy is most readily understood as anti-
Semitism or terrorism.
Rarely mentioned is the fact that
political debate is much freer in Israel.
The Hebrew press prints daily critiques
of the government in articles that would
be considered slanderous in the limited
terms of the U.S. debate. In calling for
an end to settlement-building and mili
tary closure, I join Israeli Jewish human
rights and other activist organizations
such as Women in Black, Peace Block
and Physicians for Human Rights that
criticize their government for a lack of
commitment to the peace process.
It is only by opening up the U.S.
debate on Israel that we can begin to
look seriously at the political options for
a lasting and equitable peace.
