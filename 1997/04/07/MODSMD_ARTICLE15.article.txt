# SHAC will petition to place Polo Alto sit-lie law on next ballot
## 
### 
We are writing to commend The Daily
on its stance taken on Palo Alto's recent
ly passed "sit-lie" ordinance. The Daily's
Thursday editorial discussed the most
pressing concerns that we and many oth
ers share over this harmful law.
Although its supporters have argued

that "sit-lie" addresses safety concerns,
it is clear that its underlying motivation
is to remove unwanted panhandlers and
homeless persons from University
Avenue. The "sit-lie" ordinance is sim
ply the city's most recent scheme to
drive away its undesirables. In the
recent past, the city council's anti
aggressive panhandling proposal failed
because of strong community protest.
We feel strongly that "sit-lie" should
meet the same fate.
At the hist two public hearings on "sit
lie," an overwhelming majority of the

proponents of the ordinance represented
the Chamber of Commerce or other elite
business interests in Palo Alto. The City
Council caters to the minority interests
of the business community; at these
same hearings five people spoke against
the ordinance for every one who spoke in
favor of it. Opponents of the ordinance
included everyone from a small shop
keeper to students, the elderly, homeless
people and other long-term Palo Alto res
idents. We believe Palo Alto voters would
overturn this ordinance if given the
opportunity to do so.

Thus, the Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition has undertaken a mas
sive drive to collect the 2,200-plus signa
tures required to hold a city-wide vote on
"sit-lie" in November. These signatures
must be handed to the City Clerk by
April 24. We know we can succeed but
we need the assistance of students, facul
ty and anyone else interested in combat
ing legalized meanness.
