## The
						character of politics 
### 
I'M HERE IN Los Angeles, waiting
for tomorrow to be over. Tuesday is
the city attorney's election and
tomorrow night, I will be drinking Cos
mopolitans at the Biltmore Hotel and
awaiting the returns to see if my father
has won. Tomorrow, it all comes to a
close: the 14 hour campaign schedule,
the jockeying for publicity, the call from
my mother at 10:30 each night with the
poll numbers.
Tomorrow, my mother will be able to
turn on the television again, safe from
the nastiness of the commercials. The
lack of truth makes her angry. "This is
not who he is," she says. But that's
America today. We don't care very
much about what our politicians do and
we care even less about who they are.
At the risk of sounding naive, I miss
character. It seems to have disappeared
from the political landscape. Conven
tional wisdom places this disappearance
in the Watergate era. They were once
perceived as the best of us, but Water
gate turned politicians into the worst of
us.
This is a fairly accurate assessment,
but it overlooks something vital about
the character issue, namely that politi
cians use it against voters all the time.
Politics in the United States has never
been more about character than it is
now, nor has it been more devoid of it.
Our twin governors of morality are Bill
Clinton, the pot-smoking president who

wants to crack down on drug use, and
Newt Gingrich, who chastises "welfare
queens" for refusing to take responsi
bility for their actions while he refuses
to pay the $300,000 he owes in ethics
fines. I think I could live with the
sleaziness if it weren't for the utter
hypocrisy. It seems to me that if my
moral behavior is going to be the sub
ject of political debate, I ought to hold
the debaters to the same standard.
My mother and I have both said that
if winning didn't mean so much to my
father, we would rather he lost. It
seems incomprehensible to me that this
man — who taught me to drive defen
sively and to make a superior omelet
and who sang me to sleep to the tune of
the University of Michigan fight song —
could ever be a part of such a cruel,
ruthless world. Yet I don't think it will
change him. He knows who he is.
He is someone who always came
home for dinner, who never missed a
school play, who took my phone calls
from college and made the mayor call
back. He is a man who waited to run for
political office so that he could go to
parent-teacher conferences on week
nights instead of Kiwanis dinners. He
ran the L.A. airport, and he never lost a
court case as an assistant district attor
ney, yet when anyone asks him for his
greatest accomplishment, he says that
he is a good husband and a good father.
This doesn't win elections, but it means

a lot to the three voters who have
the recipients of his efforts.
I'm not saying that people who are}
good parents and good partners are'
always good legislators or vice versa.
Character is not the sum of everything
nor should it be. Bob Dole would have<
made a dreadful president, yet he!
strikes me as a far more honorable man*
than Bill Clinton. Character should!
only take you so far. The problem with,'
politics today is that it doesn't take you
anywhere.
People will vote for him because he is
endorsed by the mayor mid the sheriff
or because his commercials are better. I
wish these people could understand the
real reasons they are right to vote for
my father. He thinks he can make a dif
ference. I almost don't believe that's
possible for politicians to do anymore.
But a part of me still holds out hope.
And that hope is what I will take to the
polls tomorrow morning, and the pride
I take in him is what I will remember
tomorrow night and the night after. He
is my father.
It's a much harder job than being
city attorney.

thought and literature, should know if
"politics" is singular or plural.
