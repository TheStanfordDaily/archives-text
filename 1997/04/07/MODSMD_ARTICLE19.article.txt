# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## O eminent scholar; allow me into your august class 
### 
"If I am not for myself, who will be for me ?
If I am only for myself, what of it? And if
not now, when will I ever take this class?"
— Me, at the beginning of most
quarters (with apologies to Hillel)
Dear professor.-
I am writing, as per your
request, the one page on which I
am to enumerate the reasons that my
inclusion in your class would benefit
myself, the other chosen students and,
eventually, the world at large. By the end
of this page, it is my hope that you will
understand why this course is so impor
tant to me and my transcript at this par
ticular time.
First, let me present the basics. I am a
major in your department, as I have been
on paper for many months and in my
soul since the day of my birth. I have
completed all of the prerequisites for this
course as denoted in the Stanford Bul
letin, all of them taken for a grade (in
fact, the same grade — my inborn sense

of modesty prevents me from stating
which grade, but let me just say that I
feel personally partially responsible for
our little grade-inflation problem, if you
catch my drift). You will note that on the
sign-up sheet for this class, my name
appears third. I was in fact first in line,
but my inborn sense of altruism com
pelled me to allow two disabled students
to precede me, lest they be crushed in the
ensuing onrush of signees.
However, I don't want to convey the
notion that I am approaching this course
as merely the next step toward a degree
to be conferred by your department. I
happen to know that it was this particu
lar course that inspired you as an under
graduate. It was in this course that you
first encountered the professor who
would go on to be your mentor and to
whom, in a New York Times interview
published last year, you would give cred
it for "shaping me into the person I am so
proud to be today." Therefore, to take
this class with you as my professor, my

potential mentor, would be a very special
experience indeed. I won't say that I
want to be like you. I want to be you.
Unfortunately, to be completely hon
est, my true needs for taking your class
are not quite so superficial or happy-go
lucky as the mere fulfillment of a child
hood dream or a hoped-for encounter
with an academic hero. No, as I write
these words, I haven't the right to my
own thoughts of happiness. My heart
grows heavy as I consider the waning
hopes of my Uncle Oren and Aunt Fluen
za back home. As their only nephew, I
am all they have left. Their son sits at
home all day playing Pictionary against
himself for money, and they haven't
heard from their daughter since she
joined that inline-skating cult. Last
Tuesday, their dog died. If I don't do
what it takes to get into the right gradu
ate school and make them proud, what's
to become of them?
As for why I need to be in this class at
this particular time — well, I have to

admit my reasons here are a little more
selfish. The doctors have said that I may
have as many as nine months left, so, yes,
theoretically, there's no good reason why I
can't take this class when it's offered
again in the fall. However, my schedule at
that time should be a little hectic — "day
to-day" they call it — so it would just work
out so much better for me if I could take
this class now. I hope you understand.
Before I conclude, I would just like to
say that one final reason why you
should accept me for your class over
other potential students is because,
quite simply, I am better than they are.
I'm smart, I'm clever and if I just put
my mind to something — anything — I
can do it and do it well. I'm very special,
and my own mother has told me as
much. I'm willing to wager that no other
student will point out that they should
be in this class simply because they
deserve it more and that, interestingly
enough, proves my point.
In closing, let me applaud your wis

dom in adopting a system of selection
that assures only the most deserving stu
dents may gain entry to your hallowed
lecture halls or hold fellowship in your
engagingly organized seminars. A pol
ished page of self-promoting prose is
nothing short of a logistic necessity for
the on-the-go professor who hasn't the
time to establish objective selection crite
ria or reschedule to a larger classroom. I
understand that beyond tuition pay
ments and prerequisites, the truly wor
thy student of today will have a little
something extra to offer. And I, unlike
others, am not resentful to ohlige.

Vietor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, has never been denied admis
sion to a class he wanted. There was one
time when he was put on a waiting list,
but he later realized he hadn't wanted to
take that stupid, boring class anyway.
