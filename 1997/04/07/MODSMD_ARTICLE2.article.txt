With a mixture of tears and laughter, Henry
Tien's friends and family commemorated his life
yesterday in the Toyon Lounge.
"He was a dedicated brother, a loving brother to
his sister, and to many of us here, he was our best
friend," said senior Howard Li.
About 275 people attended the service to remem
ber Tien, who died March 24 from head injuries sus
tained after falling during a hike with his girlfriend,
junior Susan Wu, in Yosemite National Park.
During the 2 1/2-hour service, several of Tien's
closest friends spoke, read poems and played music.
A booklet of writing by friends was distributed.
The service concluded with a video by junior Sal

Paniagua featuring photographs of Tien through
out his life and video footage from his high school
graduation speech, as well as interviews with sever
al of Tien's friends.
The service included a great deal of both humor
and sadness as Tien's friends told stories about his
life.
"We wanted to have this service in Toyon, where
he really spent a lot of his life," said senior Scott
Judd, Tien's roommate during their sophomore and
junior years. "Since Meyer Library was too quiet,
and Susan's old room could not hold 300 people, we
figured the Toyon Lounge was good enough."
Virgil Wong, Tien's cousin and friend since age 8,
told of their childhood love of Transformers toys and
