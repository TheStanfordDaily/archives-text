### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
With a mixture of tears and laughter, Henry
Tien's friends and family commemorated his life
yesterday in the Toyon Lounge.
"He was a dedicated brother, a loving brother to
his sister, and to many of us here, he was our best
friend," said senior Howard Li.
About 275 people attended the service to remem
ber Tien, who died March 24 from head injuries sus
tained after falling during a hike with his girlfriend,
junior Susan Wu, in Yosemite National Park.
During the 2 1/2-hour service, several of Tien's
closest friends spoke, read poems and played music.
A booklet of writing by friends was distributed.
The service concluded with a video by junior Sal

Paniagua featuring photographs of Tien through
out his life and video footage from his high school
graduation speech, as well as interviews with sever
al of Tien's friends.
The service included a great deal of both humor
and sadness as Tien's friends told stories about his
life.
"We wanted to have this service in Toyon, where
he really spent a lot of his life," said senior Scott
Judd, Tien's roommate during their sophomore and
junior years. "Since Meyer Library was too quiet,
and Susan's old room could not hold 300 people, we
figured the Toyon Lounge was good enough."
Virgil Wong, Tien's cousin and friend since age 8,
told of their childhood love of Transformers toys and


Henry Tien
cartoons and reminisced about late
night card games based on televi
sion game shows.
"We gambled our toys as prizes,"
Wong said. "Henry would always
win. I'm still bitter about that."
Wu talked about her relation
ship with Tien, describing shared
memories that ranged from the first
time they met in El Toro — one of
the Toyon Eating Clubs — to their
trip to Yosemite and emphasizing
her love for Tien.
"He taught me how to love some
one truly and deeply," she said. "He
always made time for me, no matter
what."
Tien's mother, Marjorie, ex
pressed her appreciation to the en
tire Stanford community for their
support.
"We really feel a heartfelt grati
tude that we really can't put into
words," she said.
She also spoke of her son's love
for Stanford, which she said began
from the first time he stepped on
campus and told her all the build
ings looked like a Taco Bell.
"I think [Stanford] really gave

him the opportunity and the space
to let Henry be who he wanted to
be," she said. "Coming to Stanford,
he blossomed. I am so thankful to
the Stanford community to give my
son the opportunity to be what he
wanted to be."
Mrs. Tien also said she knew
that losing Henry was not easy for
his friends at Stanford.
"Knowing Henry, I know he'd
want us to get over this and get on
with our lives," she said. "We
should hold a special part of our
hearts for him, but we should move
on.
Wu said that she does not feel
that Tien is really gone from her life.
"I really miss him — I miss him
so much," Wu said. "I think that
he's not really gone. Henry always
sticks by me. He's always there for
me.
Judd said that there are two
main truths for him about Tien's
death.
"First, I am sad and heartbro
ken," he said. "I will miss him every
day for the rest of my life. He would
have been a wonderful doctor, hus
band and father.
"Second, I am so happy because I
was incredibly lucky to have known
someone like Henry for the past
three years."
