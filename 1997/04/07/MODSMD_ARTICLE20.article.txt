## Six straight Baseball sweeps Trojans in series 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
The weather may have been a
little cool this past weekend at
USC's Dedeaux Field, but the
No. 4 Stanford baseball team (26-
8, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) was definite
ly on fire.
Stanford dominated the series
with a blistering 15-9, 4-2, 10-3
string of victories that swept the
season against the No. 7 Trojans
(29-13, 11-10) for the first time
since 1991. The Card also
snapped USC's six game winning
streak.
Before the series commenced,
head coach Mark Marquess
expressed a few pre-game nerves.
"It's always difficult to play
down here in the USC ballpark,"
he said. USC doesn't "have any
major weaknesses."
Marquess' worries, however,
appeared unfounded.
Stanford ignited the flame
early Friday evening after sopho
more infielder Josh Hochgesang
slammed the ball into left center
field for a homer. As Hochgesang
loped around the bases, Stanford

took the lead 1-0.
Junior infielder Jay Pecci fur
ther stunned the near-capacity
crowd late in the fourth inning as
he belted the ball deep into left
field for a three-run homer
against the Trojans.
USC, a potential No. 1 seed at
the NCAA College World Series
before its encounter with the
Cardinal this past weekend, was
arrested in its efforts by junior
pitcher Kyle Peterson. Under the
watchful eye of a dense row of
radar guns, Peterson clocked a
solid performance before retiring
in the eighth inning.
As Peterson said in a KZSU
interview after the game, "It's
definitely a good win for us and
the way we want to start the
weekend."
The Cardinal continued its
winning streak Saturday after
noon with a 4-2 victory.
In that game, senior infielder
Luke Quaccia smacked an easy
base hit in the third, bringing in
Pecci and freshman outfielder
Edmund Muth and furnishing
the Cardinal with an early 2-0
