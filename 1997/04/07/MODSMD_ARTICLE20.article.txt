## Six straight Baseball sweeps Trojans in series 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
The weather may have been a
little cool this past weekend at
USC's Dedeaux Field, but the
No. 4 Stanford baseball team (26-
8, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) was definite
ly on fire.
Stanford dominated the series
with a blistering 15-9, 4-2, 10-3
string of victories that swept the
season against the No. 7 Trojans
(29-13, 11-10) for the first time
since 1991. The Card also
snapped USC's six game winning
streak.
Before the series commenced,
head coach Mark Marquess
expressed a few pre-game nerves.
"It's always difficult to play
down here in the USC ballpark,"
he said. USC doesn't "have any
major weaknesses."
Marquess' worries, however,
appeared unfounded.
Stanford ignited the flame
early Friday evening after sopho
more infielder Josh Hochgesang
slammed the ball into left center
field for a homer. As Hochgesang
loped around the bases, Stanford

took the lead 1-0.
Junior infielder Jay Pecci fur
ther stunned the near-capacity
crowd late in the fourth inning as
he belted the ball deep into left
field for a three-run homer
against the Trojans.
USC, a potential No. 1 seed at
the NCAA College World Series
before its encounter with the
Cardinal this past weekend, was
arrested in its efforts by junior
pitcher Kyle Peterson. Under the
watchful eye of a dense row of
radar guns, Peterson clocked a
solid performance before retiring
in the eighth inning.
As Peterson said in a KZSU
interview after the game, "It's
definitely a good win for us and
the way we want to start the
weekend."
The Cardinal continued its
winning streak Saturday after
noon with a 4-2 victory.
In that game, senior infielder
Luke Quaccia smacked an easy
base hit in the third, bringing in
Pecci and freshman outfielder
Edmund Muth and furnishing
the Cardinal with an early 2-0
series by eclipsing a floundering
USC team Sunday with a 10-3
win.
The excitement smoldered in
the third when the Cardinal
scored seven runs, beginning
with Muth's stand-up double,
which scored two runs.
This was followed by a double
from Hochgesang which smashed
against the outfield wall, steering
Muth and sophomore outfielder
Jody Gerut to home plate and
opening the doors for a deluge of
Stanford runs.
Another highlight of the game
occurred when junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer stepped up to bat late

in the third. As the crowd
watched in awe, Schaeffer
slammed the ball over the out
field wall, increasing his home
run total to seven for the 1996-97
season.
Quaccia summed up the
importance of the recent Cardi
nal victories over USC.
"It's a complete 180 from
last year," Quaccia said on
KZSU. "It's just a great feel
ing. . . . We beat them every
single game we've played them
this year, just solidly beat them
— outhit them, outpitched
them and played really good
defense."

lead.
Sophomore Chad Hutchinson
pitched a staggering game, effec
tively slamming the door on the
USC offense for the majority of
the afternoon.
"I had real good control,"
Hutchinson said on KZSU. "For
me, it's a matter of locating my
pitches. It's good to get back in
my form and throw some
strikes."
