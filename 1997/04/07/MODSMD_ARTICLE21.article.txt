### Aida Leu Editorial staff 
The No. 11 Stanford men's
gymnastics team defied all odds
and secured a place at the NCAA
championship by placing in the top
three at the NCAA West Regionals
in Albuquerque, N.M., last week
end.
Going up against No. 2 Califor
nia, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 Okla
homa and a fired up No. 10 New
Mexico, the Cardinal still managed
to score a 228.175, good for third
behind Cal's 233.125 and Okla
homa's 230.175.
Stanford was neck-and-neck
with Nebraska going in the final
event of the night but managed to
outdo itself on the last event, the
vault.
When the fmal numbers were
tallied, Stanford edged out New
Mexico, which gave a great effort in
front of the home crowd, for the
final spot at nationals by 1.025.
Nebraska, which peaked at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion championship the weekend
before with a 2.30.7, dropped to
fifth and posted only a 226.725 at
West Regionals.
Senior Ail-American Jamie
Ellis, in his first all-around appear
ance since Feb. 22, had a stellar
night scoring 9.7 on floor and 9.625
on vault. Ellis had seen action on
only one event, the floor exercise at
MPSFs, since dislocating his shoul
der on the same event at the UCI A.

Invitational Feb. 27.
Although strongly advised to
refrain from competing in any
event other than pommel horse,
Ellis rose to the occasion, per
formed in all six events and had a
solid performance in his home
town of Albuquerque.
Ellis' co-captain senior Keith
Wiley had the top performance for
the Cardinal, placing second in the
all-around. Wiley's routines were
highlighted by a 9.7 on the floor
and a 9.75 on the parallel bars.
Stanford's third and fmal senior
on the team, lan Bachrach, who
has won national titles on both the
floor and vault, suffered a knee
injury on floor. He is questionable
for nationals.
Despite the injury, Bachrach
still competed on the rings that
night.
The Stanford squad started the
night with a miss on parallel bars
but managed to recoup in the find
routines for a team score of 38.3,
good for third in the event.
After that, however, the team
struggled in its next rotation. On
high bar, both of the lead perform
ers, sophomore Scott Finklestein
and redshirt freshman David Lud
low, missed their routines. The
pressure was on for the final four
performers — Bachrach and fresh
man Jason Katsampes came
through with strong routines, but
Ellis and Wiley faltered.
"After high bar, everyone had to
be a little worried," Ellis said.

The third rotation for Stanford
was the floor exercise, which went
well with the Card again taking
second in the event to Cal. The
team racked up 38.65 for the event,

but lost Bachrach in the process.
Stanford then headed to the
pommel horse, generally the Cardi

nal's strongest event. The team
expected to make up for lost
ground but still finished second to
Cal's 38.775 with 38.525.
On rings, Stanford scored a
decent score all things considered.
Rings has never been the Card's
strong suit.
"We struggled on rings. Lan did
rings, but he over-rotated his dis
mount because of his knee," Ellis
said. "But we pretty much did the
best we could on rings."
The final event of the night was
the vault, and the Stanford squad
knew it needed a high score to dis
place Nebraska. Head coach Sadao
Hamada kept the team managers
busy tallying the scores so he could
determine which vaults thegym
nasts needed to perform.
Many of the gymnasts rehearse
a 10.0 vault and a more stable 9.8
based vault and depending on the
circumstances, Hamada will
instruct the team members on
which one to perform.
Hamada mistakenly neglected
to calculate New Mexico s score,
but luckily the Cardinal had a
great performance on vault. New
Mexico was unable to unseat Stan
ford for the third spot.
Both Wiley and Ellis attribute
the outcome of the tournament to
the unwavering team unity and
optimism. "It was our heart that
won the meet,' Ellis said. Every
one pulling together, overcoming
injuries and early struggles to get
the job done.
"We focused from the moment
we stepped in the gym on qualify
ing, no matter what happened in
the interim. We could have easily
folded, but we didn't."
The Stanford team must now
set its sights on realizing its year
long goal of another national
championship.
"I'm so happy that we made it
and that nobody gave up. We were
fighting until the end," Wiley said.
"We still have a lot of room for
improvement, and I still think that
everyone wants to fight for a
championship."
