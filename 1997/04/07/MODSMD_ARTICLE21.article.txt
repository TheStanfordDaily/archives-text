The No. 11 Stanford men's
gymnastics team defied all odds
and secured a place at the NCAA
championship by placing in the top
three at the NCAA West Regionals
in Albuquerque, N.M., last week
end.
Going up against No. 2 Califor
nia, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 Okla
homa and a fired up No. 10 New
Mexico, the Cardinal still managed
to score a 228.175, good for third
behind Cal's 233.125 and Okla
homa's 230.175.
Stanford was neck-and-neck
with Nebraska going in the final
event of the night but managed to
outdo itself on the last event, the
vault.
When the fmal numbers were
tallied, Stanford edged out New
Mexico, which gave a great effort in
front of the home crowd, for the
final spot at nationals by 1.025.
Nebraska, which peaked at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion championship the weekend
before with a 2.30.7, dropped to
fifth and posted only a 226.725 at
West Regionals.
Senior Ail-American Jamie
Ellis, in his first all-around appear
ance since Feb. 22, had a stellar
night scoring 9.7 on floor and 9.625
on vault. Ellis had seen action on
only one event, the floor exercise at
MPSFs, since dislocating his shoul
der on the same event at the UCI A.

Invitational Feb. 27.
Although strongly advised to
refrain from competing in any
event other than pommel horse,
Ellis rose to the occasion, per
formed in all six events and had a
solid performance in his home
town of Albuquerque.
Ellis' co-captain senior Keith
Wiley had the top performance for
the Cardinal, placing second in the
all-around. Wiley's routines were
highlighted by a 9.7 on the floor
and a 9.75 on the parallel bars.
Stanford's third and fmal senior
on the team, lan Bachrach, who
has won national titles on both the
floor and vault, suffered a knee
injury on floor. He is questionable
for nationals.
Despite the injury, Bachrach
still competed on the rings that
night.
The Stanford squad started the
night with a miss on parallel bars
but managed to recoup in the find
routines for a team score of 38.3,
good for third in the event.
After that, however, the team
struggled in its next rotation. On
high bar, both of the lead perform
ers, sophomore Scott Finklestein
and redshirt freshman David Lud
low, missed their routines. The
pressure was on for the final four
performers — Bachrach and fresh
man Jason Katsampes came
through with strong routines, but
Ellis and Wiley faltered.
"After high bar, everyone had to
be a little worried," Ellis said.

The third rotation for Stanford
was the floor exercise, which went
well with the Card again taking
second in the event to Cal. The
team racked up 38.65 for the event,

but lost Bachrach in the process.
Stanford then headed to the
