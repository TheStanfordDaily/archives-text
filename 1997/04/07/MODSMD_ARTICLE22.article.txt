## Fails to make nationals 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team,
which went up against prestigious teams
throughout the season and defeated some of
the top-ranked teams in the country, was sup
posed to ride on its high all the way to nation
als; the 1997 season was destined to be for the
young Cardinal squad.
However, the team placed fifth at the NCAA
West Regional championship held at Boise,
Idaho, Saturday with a team total of 193.95
points. This result was not enough to qualify
the Stanford team to the NCAA championship
and put an end to the postseason for the Card.
The total put the Stanford squad in 18th
place overall for all of the regions. Only the top
team in each of the four regions has an auto
matic berth to nationals, while seven wildcards
are dealt based on score.
"I still haven't figured out what happened,"
said sophomore co-captain Amy Murakami.
"But it just didn't happen."
The UCLA squad, which won the Pacific 10
Conference title just 0.225 points ahead of the
runner-up Card, emerged as the regional
champion with a total of 196.3 points. Wash
ington followed with 195.725, while Oregon
State, with 195.075 points, and Boise State,
with 194.75, finished in third and fourth
places, respectively.
California and Cal State Fullerton trailed
the Card with scores of 193.05 and 190.925.
Other teams represented in the competition
included Santa Barbara, Alaska-Anchorage
and Cal State Sacramento.
Although qualifying was never an issue for
the talented young squad which placed third
last year in the regional competition and
received a wildcard invitation to nationals, the
Card was put in a tough situation going into
the meet with junior co-captain Keri Monahan
on the bench for three of four events.
Monahan, who had been experiencing a
radiant season of all-around titles but two
weeks ago suffered a severe ankle injury, went
up on the bars in hopes of helping set the Card
off with a strong lead.
"With Keri sitting out, it was just nerve
racking for the team to wonder for the past two
weeks if she was going to help us or not," said
head coach Lisa Izzi. "When you are dealt that
kind of situation, the best you can do is to com
municate well with the trainers and remain
positive."
Although Monahan fought bravely on the
bars, the meet was off to a slow start for the
Cardinal, which finished seventh place on the
