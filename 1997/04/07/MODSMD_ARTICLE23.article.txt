### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team (21-1, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division) extended its
conference winning streak to 29 this weekend by
downing No. 3 UCLA 6-3 and USC 7-2 in a tough Pac
-10 homestand.
The Cardinal won nine of 12 singles matches over
all against the Bruins and the Trojans. Stanford beat
both Los Angeles rivals without No. 2 singles player
freshman Anne Kremer, who took the weekend off
due to strep throat.
In the clash between the second- and third-best
women's tennis programs in the nation this year, the
Cardinal jumped out to a 4-2 lead in singles.
Freshman Teryn Ashley, back in the lineup
because of Kremer's absence, maintained an unde
feated dual-match record by defeating UCLA's Brandi
Freudenberg in straight sets in the No. 6 match, 6-1,
6-2.
The Cardinal seemed to get the best of the inexpe
rienced Bruins, as three of UCliA's four new faces
dropped their respective singles matches.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh once again was in the

spotlight of the No. 1 match but shot down UCLA
transfer Kati Kocsis in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6. Senior
Sandra De Silva and junior Julie Scott both tackled
the UCLA freshmen across the net in the No. 3 and
No. 5 matches, respectively. De Silva defeated Annica
Cooper 6-4,6-3 while Scott also rolled in a 6-4, 6-1 vic
tory over Katia Roubanova.
"They are young," said co-captain Scott. "But they
are good, and the match was definitely a good test for
us. I think they are the second best team in tin? con
ference."
UCLA earned its singles points in upsets at both
the No. 2 and No. 4 matches. Bruin freshman Eliza
beth Schmidt shocked Stanford senior Katie Schluke
bir, the No. 2 singles player in the country, in straight
sets, 6-3, 7-5.
At the No. 4 match, Kelly Rudolph, one of t he only
returning starters for UCLA, upset junior All Ameri
can Ania Bleszynski, 6-4, 7-6.
In doubles, Bleszynski was once again the victim of
an upset as she and Scott, the top-ranked doubles
team in the country, dropped an 8-5 decision to Kocsis
and Cooper. Down 7-2 in the match, the Cardinal lan
dem fought back to within 7-5, but the Bruin <|und
finished the match off.
"I think we should have beaten them, obviou Iv,"
Scott said. "I missed my share of halls, and Ania might
have boon upset about singles. Wo almost got it back,
but it was too late."
I lowever, the Cardinal was pleased with the win a
it proved once again that the Pac-10 is its conference
"We played pretty well I think," Scott said. "Wo got
off to a slow start l>ecause it was our first match ba« k
from spring break. But we got it together eventually."
In the other doubles matches, tlx; Cardinal team of
Ashley and senior Emily Burt eked out a 9-8 win in the
No. 3 match, while ()sterloh and Schhikebir l» l< <1
their way to a 8-0 whitewash of Schmidt, and
Roubanova.
Against the Trojans Saturday, it was business
usual as the Cardinal clinched the win in . in,
taking five of the six matches. Scott and Ashley on«v
again earned straight set wins. On the No. 1 court,
Osterloh put on an impressive display in coming i
behind to bent I JSC's Ditta Ihiber in three sets,
loh dropped a tiebreak in the first set and looked ready
to throw in the towel when she was down 3-0 in the
second as well.
Yet the freshman fought back in a hard-bittm
match with Holier and pulled off a *» 7, 6-4, 6-4 wu.
which was the clincher.
Bleszynski bounced back from a rough out •
against the Bruins by notching a straight set win i
Trojan Kva Jimenez, 6-4, 6-1
"1 was really not happy with myself after my |*r
forinance against UCLA," Bleszynski said. "I ren" '
wanted to come out and get. it together against I IS(
Schlukebir employed the same philosophy r
rebounding from her loss to UCLA. Schlukebir, firm
up from the first point, went on to a straight-set win of
her own over Knrolina Baklarova, 6-2, 6-4.
