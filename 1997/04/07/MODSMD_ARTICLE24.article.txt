# Softball beats Beavers, splits with Ducks
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford softball (19-17-1, 5-9 Pacific 10
Conference) had a successful weekend, putting
together much improved hitting, fielding and
pitching to notch three wins and only one loss
against Oregon State and Oregon. T he Cardinal
had four solid games and were only a question
able call away from going undefeated.
Saturday's opponent, Oregon State, proved
no match for the team. In game one, sophomore
ace Marcy Crouch pitched seven strong innings,
allowing only two runs to be scored on seven
hits. Crouch has done a good job in lowering the
number of walks allowed per game, and in Sat
urday's contest she limited her walks to three.
Stanford actually had fewer hits than the

Beavers, hut the hits were well timed. In the
second inning sophomore centerfielder Kelly
Yablonski hit a clutch single to drive in two
runs. Stanford would score again in the fourth
inning and go on to win 3-2.
In game two on Saturday, Stanford had one
of its best hitting performances of the season.
Line drive aßer line drive allowed Stanford to
score five runs in the second inning and take a
big lead early. Stanford had its highest extra
base hits total in a game, recording three dou
bles and a triple. The hard hit doubles were
recorded by freshman catcher Kellie Wiginton,
sophomore designated player Shane Anderson
and senior first baseman Summer Lee.
Sophomore shortstop Michelle Schneider
recorded the triple, continuing her good season
at the plate. Schneider is amongst the leaders in

many of Stanford's hitting categories and is pro
viding solid hitting at the No. 3 spot in the line
up.
"The second game against Oregon State was
one of our better games hitting-wise this year,"
Crouch said. "We were a little off offensively in
the other games, and it is something we'll work
on this week in practice."
Sophomore pitcher Becky Blevins comple
mented Stanford's fine hitting by recording her
fourth shutout of the season. Blevins' perfor
mances of late have been superb considering
she was sick during finals. The fatigue that
Blevins may have felt on Saturday was certain
ly not evident to the crowd or most of the
Beaver hitters, though, as the end result was a
7-0 trouncing.
Sunday's games were much
closer, largely due to the fact that
Stanford's hitting was not as solid
as it was on Saturday. In game one
against Oregon, Stanford pulled
out a close win 2-1. The game was
a nail biter, with sophomore right
fielder Michelle Acosta providing a
clutch hit with the bases loaded to
bring in the game winning RBI in

the bottom of the seventh. Crouch
got the victory arid improved her
record to 10-6.
In the second game against Ore
gon, masterful utilization of Duck
pitchers, great grabs by Oregon
outfielders and a questionable call
by the umpire led to Stanford's
only defeat of the weekend.
The Ducks used three pitchers
during the game to keep the Cardi
nal a bit off balance. Each time the
team began to get its timing
against one pitcher, Oregon's
coach would put in another, throw
ing the Card off and slowing any

Stanford momentum that was
beginning to unfold. After nine
innings the score was still tied, and
the international tiebreak rule,
which puts a runner on second at
the beginning of the inning, was
implemented.
"It's sort of the equivalent of
sudden death in soccer," Blevins
said.
Oregon was able to bring its
baserunner home, making the
score 3-2 going in to the bottom of
the 10th inning. With Acosta start
ing on second base for the Cardi
nal, Stanford hit two solid balls
that seemed to be the hits that
would drive in the tying run. But
Oregon outfielders made great
catches to get the outs and hold
Acosta at second.
With two outs, Lee hit a ball to
second and looked to beat out a
throw that would have made her
safe and driven in the tying run.
Not only did it look like she might
have beaten the throw, but Ore
gon's first baseman seemed to pull
her foot off the bag at the moment
she made the catch. The umpire,
apparently never hearing of the
home call, called Lee out to close
the game. It was a disappointing
loss, one that could have been won
earlier with a little better hitting.
The weekend's wins moved
Stanford back in contention to
receive a bid to the regional tour
nament. Stanford will have to con
tinue to play well to keep that pos
sibility alive. It's next opportunity
to move towards a bid is next week
end when Stanford plays Califor
nia at Berkeley.
"We're definitely looking for
two wins next weekend," Yablons
ki said.
