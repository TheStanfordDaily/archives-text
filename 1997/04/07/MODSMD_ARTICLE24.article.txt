Stanford softball (19-17-1, 5-9 Pacific 10
Conference) had a successful weekend, putting
together much improved hitting, fielding and
pitching to notch three wins and only one loss
against Oregon State and Oregon. T he Cardinal
had four solid games and were only a question
able call away from going undefeated.
Saturday's opponent, Oregon State, proved
no match for the team. In game one, sophomore
ace Marcy Crouch pitched seven strong innings,
allowing only two runs to be scored on seven
hits. Crouch has done a good job in lowering the
number of walks allowed per game, and in Sat

score five runs in the second inning and take a
big lead early. Stanford had its highest extra
base hits total in a game, recording three dou

recorded by freshman catcher Kellie Wiginton,
sophomore designated player Shane Anderson
and senior first baseman Summer Lee.
Sophomore shortstop Michelle Schneider
recorded the triple, continuing her good season
at the plate. Schneider is amongst the leaders in

many of Stanford's hitting categories and is pro
viding solid hitting at the No. 3 spot in the line
up.
"The second game against Oregon State was
one of our better games hitting-wise this year,"
Crouch said. "We were a little off offensively in
the other games, and it is something we'll work
on this week in practice."
Sophomore pitcher Becky Blevins comple
mented Stanford's fine hitting by recording her
fourth shutout of the season. Blevins' perfor
mances of late have been superb considering
she was sick during finals. The fatigue that
Blevins may have felt on Saturday was certain
ly not evident to the crowd or most of the
Beaver hitters, though, as the end result was a
