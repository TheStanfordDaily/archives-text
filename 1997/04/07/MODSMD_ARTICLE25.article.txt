# Spring football starts
## 1997 season looks good 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
With the echoes of a 38-0 Sun
Bowl triumph still lingering in
the not-so-distant past, head
coach 'JVrone Willingham and
his Stanford football team open
spring practice today at 4:15
p.in. in preparation for one of
their most hotly anticipated
campaigns in recent memory.

There is indeed reason for
optimism: The Cardinal returns
14 starters from a 199f3 team
that finished 7-5 (5-3 Pacific 10
Conference) and ran off five
straight victories to close the sea
son after stumbling out to a 2-5
start. The returning players
include six starters on offense
and six on defense, in addition to
startingjunior punter / placekicker
Kevin Miller.
What follows is a position-by
position breakdown of the 1997
Cardinal.
Offense
For the second straight year,
redshirt freshman quarterback
Chad Hutchinson will miss spring
drills in order to focus on his duties
as starting pitcher for the 4th
ranked Stanford baseball team.
Hutchinson, who won the starting
job from the now-departed Tim
Carey last spring, will be pushed
this fall by incoming freshman
Itandy Fasani, a blue-chip recruit
out of Granite Bay, Calif. In the
meantime, freshman backup Todd
Husak will handle the offense.
The offensive backfield remains
mostly intact, with running backs
junior Anthony Bookman and red
shirt junior Mike Mitchell return
ing for their final seasons. Cone is
fullback Adam Salina, but junior
Greg Cornelia and junior Jon
Ritchie, healthy and happy after
injury-plagued 1996 seasons, will
fill the void.
At wide receiver, speedsters
junior Damon Dunn and sopho
more Troy Walters will assume the
spotlight with the departure of
seniors Brian Manning, Andre Kir
wan and Marlon Evans. Junior
tight ends Tommy Hanson and
Derek Hubbard will be pushed by
freshmen Steve Coughlin and Rus
sell Stewart.
The offensive line returns sever
al experienced players, thanks to a
rash of injuries in 1996 that unex
pectedly forced young players into
game situations. Sophomore Mike
McLaughlin, junior Andrew

Kroeker and sophomore Jeff Cron
shagen will likely hold down the
center, left guard and right guard
positions, respectively, with junior
Geoff Wilson, sophomore F.li Bur
riss, junior Brian Donoghue, junior
Desmond Cook, redshirt sopho
more Matt Motherway and sopho
more Joe Fairchild all battling for
significant playing time.
Defense \
Three returning starters anchor*
a defensive line that could be one of!
the Pac-10's best in 1997. Junior
All-Pac-10 defensive end Kaileo!
Wong returns, as do tackle junior)
Carl Hansen and junior end Bryan*
Werner. The lone question mark is!
at nose tackle, a position vacated byj
fifth-year senior I'ete Swanson. â€¢
Also back in 1997 are starting!
inside linebackers Chris Draft and*
Jon Haskins, both juniors this*
year. They will likely l>e joined at!
the outside linebacker spot b>r
sophomore Donnie Spragan, a*
transfer from Pacific.
The defensive backfield is the*
one area bit, hardest by graduation,,
with three departed seniors leaving)
their starting jobs up for grabs.*
Juniors Corey Hill, Alist air White,.
Kadar Hamilton and sophomore*
Tim Smith are the front, runners
for starting spots.
Special Teams
Miller will likely assume punt-!
ing and place-kicking duties once*
again in 1997. The junior has aver-*
aged 38.9 yards per punt over the)
last two years and was also 12-of-'
19 on field goals last season Dunn!
is the team's top kickoff returner,)
and Walters will handle the punts. <
