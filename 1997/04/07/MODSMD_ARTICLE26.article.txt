# Santa Cruz plays host
## Men's golf heads for the hills 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
As the final few crucial tourna
ments of the spring season
approach the Stanford men's golf
team, head coach Wally Goodwin
knows that his squad has still not
ensured its spot at the NCAA West
Regional tournament in mid-May.
"As of now, we're ranked 10th
in the region. We probably can't
make it up to 7th, but I hope we
don't drop to 13th because only the
top 12 teams go to regionals,"
Goodwin said. "That's the great
thing about sports, though â€” it's
still anyone's game."
Five golfers attend the Western
Intercollegiate Tournament today
and tomorrow at Pasa Tiempo Golf
Course in Santa Cruz. The tourna
ment also hosts such schools as
San Jose State, Long Beach, Cali
fornia, UC-Irvine, Santa Barbara,
Pacific and Washington.
If recent performance in prac
tice is any indication of their

enthusiasm, the golfers are defi
nitely up to the challenge. Satur
day the team set the all-time low
qualifying record for the Stanford
golf course, lower than any team in
the past despite Stanford's several
national championship titles.
The five team members posted
scores of 65, 67, 68, 71 and 74. In a
tournament format (in which only
the top four scores are counted)
this would have equated to a team
score of 274. Compared to scores of
293 and 291, posted by the winning
team (Colorado State University)
at the prestigious and competitive
Nelson Invitational hosted by
Stanford last November, the Stan
ford golf team proved its potential
to compete with anyone.
"If you've never done some
thing, you don't know if you ever
will, but if you've done it once you
know you can do it again," Good
win said of Saturday's record
breaking success.
Regional rank is determined by
a team's record against other

regional adversaries. Key regional
opponents at the Western Intercol
legiate Tournament will be Cal,
UC-Irvine, Santa Barbara, Pacific
and Washington. These are the
teams the Cardinal must beat in
order to better its regional hopes.
"Right now, we're in an OK
position; we still have a good
chance," Goodwin said. "I hope
this week can be a stepping stone
for us. If we lose to those teams
next week, we'll have a long haul
ahead of us, but we still have the
Stanford tournament (and others)
to better our position and make it
in."
Although this may sound easy,
in golf, as in many sports, a miss is
as good as a mile.
"An inch here and an inch there
will be the difference between vic
tory and defeat," Goodwin said.
"We are about a stroke, a player,
a day from being a shoo-in at the
NCAA tournament. If all five guys
average one stroke a day less from
now, we'll be there."
