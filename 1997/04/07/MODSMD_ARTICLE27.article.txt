# Men's volleyball eases past Coyotes in straight games
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Coming into Saturday's match
against Cal State-San Bernadino,
the No. 4 Stanford men's volley
ball team (19-3, 13-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had
some rather unusual goals in
mind.
While the squad wanted to
continue its winning streak and
its perfect home-match record,
one of the goals foremost in the
minds of the Stanford coaching
staff was trying to get more play
ers involved in the action. Nor
mally, a team does not go into a
match looking to keep its starters
out of the game as much as possi
ble, yet this was the Cardinal's
desire.
"Early on in the season, we
used some people off the bench,
particularly Tad Hoffman and
Devin Poolman, when other guys
were struggling," head coach
Ruben Nieves said before the
match. "Recently we have not
used anyone off the bench
because our starters have been
playing really well. I hope that we
will get the chance to I let] these
guys show the skills that we
relied on early on."

Clearly from the composition
of the team that spent time on the
floor on Saturday, the goal of the
coaching staff was realized. All
told, only three players out of
Stanford's starting group of six
showed up in the post game
statistics. Outside hitters Matt
Fuerbringer, a senior, Andy Witt,
a freshman and senior middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst all
got much needed rests, involved
as spectators rather than their
more usual role of stars.
While Fuerbringer, Witt and
Whitehurst watched, the match
was dominated by a combina
tion of familiar stars and sel
dom seen reserves. All told in
the easy three-game victory,
Stanford used eight non
starters and won 15-8, 15-5, 15-
5. Although senior starters
Mike Lambert, Mike Hoefer and
Stewart Chong electrified the
crowd witli their typically
strong play, the reserves really
stole the show.
Senior outside hitter Aaron
Garcia, who has seen little action
this year, provided outstanding
serving and contributed two aces.
Others contributing were junior
middle blocker Tad Hoffman,
who totaled eight kills, junior out

side hitter Devin Poolman, who
contributed five kills and eight
digs and sophomore outside hit
ter Patrick Klein who showed
himself to be a strong attacking
force by putting up seven kills.
"For most of the season we
have played only six or seven
guys," Hoefer said. "Wo have a lot
of good players, and it was great
that they got a chance to play and
played so well."
While some may have gone
away unhappy at not having seen
more of Stanford's stars, the
strong play of the reserves, many
of whom will be back next year,
bodes well for the future. The
backups showed the faithful that
Witt, who Ls the only underclass
man in the starting six, will not
have to shoulder the burden of
carrying Stanford to another
strong season next year. Indeed,
if Stanford's returning players
contribute at the level that they
did on Saturday, the squad will be
assured of a strong showing in
1998.
Coming off this weekend's vic
tory, the Cardinal has until Fri
day before its next competition, a
weekend series with Pacific Divi
sion cellar dwellers San Diego
State and UC-San Diego.
