Members of the Stanford Homelessness Ac
tion Coalition spent Saturday afternoon on Uni
versity Avenue in Palo Alto campaigning against
the recently passed sit-lie ordinance.
The law, said SHAC member Olivia Wang, a
senior, is "yet another attempt by the city to push
away homeless people."
The ordinance, which prohibits anyone from
sitting or lying on the sidewalk on University Av
enue during peak business hours, was passed at a

Palo Alto City Council meeting March 10. Wang
explained that SHAC now has until April 24 to
collect 2,200 signatures from Palo Alto residents
in order to place the ordinance as a referendum
on the November ballot.
Saturday's petition drive was only partly suc
cessful, Wang said. While the group collected
about 100 signatures, she said most of the people
SHAC members talked to were not Palo Alto res
idents and were therefore ineligible to sign the pe
titions.
"We're basically just going to have to rethink
our strategy and do more community organiza

tion and less standing on street corners trying to
get people to sign petitions," she said.
SHAC opposes the sit-lie? law for a number of
reasons, according to Wang.
"We don't feel like the city council is really
being honest to itself or the public about the ordi
nance," she said. "It's supposedly in the interest
of safety â€” the claim is that pedestrians who are
looking in shop windows aren't paying attention
