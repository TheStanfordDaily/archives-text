# SHAC wants 'sit-lie' on November ballot
## 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford Homelessness Ac
tion Coalition spent Saturday afternoon on Uni
versity Avenue in Palo Alto campaigning against
the recently passed sit-lie ordinance.
The law, said SHAC member Olivia Wang, a
senior, is "yet another attempt by the city to push
away homeless people."
The ordinance, which prohibits anyone from
sitting or lying on the sidewalk on University Av
enue during peak business hours, was passed at a

Palo Alto City Council meeting March 10. Wang
explained that SHAC now has until April 24 to
collect 2,200 signatures from Palo Alto residents
in order to place the ordinance as a referendum
on the November ballot.
Saturday's petition drive was only partly suc
cessful, Wang said. While the group collected
about 100 signatures, she said most of the people
SHAC members talked to were not Palo Alto res
idents and were therefore ineligible to sign the pe
titions.
"We're basically just going to have to rethink
our strategy and do more community organiza

tion and less standing on street corners trying to
get people to sign petitions," she said.
SHAC opposes the sit-lie? law for a number of
reasons, according to Wang.
"We don't feel like the city council is really
being honest to itself or the public about the ordi
nance," she said. "It's supposedly in the interest
of safety — the claim is that pedestrians who are
looking in shop windows aren't paying attention
and won'tbeabletoseea human person sittingin
the ground.
"But people aren't tripping over
human bodies," Wang said.
"There's not a single documented
case of a person tripping over a
human being. Everybody who's
heard of this ordinance knows it's
another attempt to get rid of home
less people that a lot of residents
and merchants don't want to see."
Another SHAC member, senior
Monty Black, said that although the
council claims people on the side
walk obstruct traffic, the law fails to
address other obstructions, such as
"dogs on leashes outside of Star
bucks and huge crowds at Miyake
on weekends.
"The council members are not
being fully honest about the motiva
tion behind the ordinance," Black
said. "They are trying to get pan
handlers off University Avenue."
However, Palo Alto City Coun
cilman Gary Fazzino, a supporter of
the ordinance, said it was created to
address the problem of navigating
through the downtown area on
"public sidewalks which are for the
express purpose of traversing."
I le also said the? measure was not
aimed at removing homeless people
from the streets. "If we really want
ed to eliminate homeless people,
we'd move the benches" from the
downtown area, Fazzino said.
Fazzino also said that although
members of groups like SHAC may
succeed in getting the sit-lie law on

the November ballot, he believes
the Palo Alto community supports
the ordinance.
"I think it's fairly easy to qualify
just about any ballot measure in
California, but I think it would be
defeated" because most of the oppo
sition to the measure has come from
people who were "very much associ
ated with homeless and street peo
ple," he said.
"And that was about it.
"You certainly didn't see lots of
folks with single family homes op
posing it. Based upon what we saw
and heard I'd be very surprised if it
were overturned," Fazzino added.
However, SHAC members said
they are focusing more on collect
ing signatures than on the poten
tial results of a referendum. Black
said the group is trying to figure out
how to get students involved.
Stressing the "urgency of the situa
tion, " he called the petition drive "a
very short-term effort that re
quires as much concentration as
possible.
"It's an ideal situation in terms
of student volunteering," he
added. "They can call a couple peo
ple or send out a few petitions and
be done by April 24." He said inter
ested students should call or leave
a message on SHAC's voice mail at
723-0066.
Matt Bartels, a doctoral student,
is hopeful about SHAC's chances of
collecting the signatures it needs. "I
hope we can make it — 2,200 signa
tures is a pretty manageable
amount," he said. "It's going to take
a lot of work, but I'm optimistic."
