# A 						common tune
## Stanford hosts young musicians 
### Alison MacKinnon 
Nine-year-old Bhavika Kaul plans to play music for a
longtime. "You can play piano throughoutyour life," she
explained Saturday afternoon. "You don't need to stop."
Esther Wee, a 13-year-old, agreed. "I love music be
cause playing encourages you to be creative and not so
limited," she said.
Although their reasons for playing differed, more
than 100 students ages 9-13 from ail over the Bay Area
came together at Braun Music Center Saturday to cele
brate their common love of music at the first Stanford
Young Artist Festival.
Classical music drifted out of the piano practice
rooms and students gathered in the hallways with their
violins awaiting auditions. Sixteen will be chosen for
$50 scholarships and will perform four school recitals at
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto elementary schools next
month.
Was there reason to be nervous? "No," confided An
gela Chen, 12. "We're here to have fun, and plus the
judges are really nice. Nobody should be scared of
them."
The judges, mainly Stanford music students, agreed
that the atmosphere was not competitive. "The inter-
view is an important part of their
score," explained adjudicator Koto
ka Suzuki, a doctoral student. "We
look for how well they communicate
with the audience."
Music can play an important role
in a child's life, said junior Katie
Thorpe, another judge. "It is a
source of esteem, a skill to work on
and something that others enjoy
hearing," she said.
The judges were unanimous in
their praise of the students. "I'm
impressed," junior Mary Barsanti
said. "I can tell that they really love
to play, and they have a lot of confi
dence."
"The kids are remarkably well
spoken, especially for their age
level," junior Hejin Woo agreed.
President and founder Sonja Ho,
a senior biology major, outlined the
idea behind the Stanford Music So
ciety, which organized the event.
"The best thing to share something
you care about is to give it away,"
she explained.
She founded the society last
year after being inspired by a per
formance at USC. "I wanted to
reach out to the community and

allow children to expand their
horizons," she said. The concerts
in East Palo Alto provide a great
opportunity to achieve that goal.
Many local districts "do not have
strong elementary school music
programs," explained junior Danny
Hsu, the society's second adminis
trative officer.
"This is a great way for them to
be exposed to classical music. They
can relate to kids their own age who
love music."
Since its founding, the society
has been working toward this event.
"The students have done a tremen
dous job," said Ben Simon, the
group's adviser and a lecturer in the
Music Department.
"This is one of the most well-or
ganized events I've ever seen," said
junior Salar Kamangar, first ad
ministrative officer."The Stanford
Music Society had been preparing
for this for over a year. It is always
rewarding to see a project through
to completion, but I'm especially
impressed by the tremendous sense
of excitement this organization has
inspired in the 100-plus Bay Area
students."
Eleven-year-old Angela Nguyen
summed up the experience: "Piano
playing is my favorite thing to do.
I'm so excited to meet other kids
who love the same thing."
