# Bridge safe for one more year
## 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
The University has decided to
allow counselors at the Bridge to
live on the first floor of their build
ing during the next school year.
"This is merely a Band-aid solu
tion," Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, to the structural weaknesses
that have caused parts of the build
ing to be condemned.
The University hopes to begin
working with volunteers at the
Bridge this quarter to develop a vi
able alternative to having students
live in the building, which is unsafe
as a result of damage caused by the
1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
"We're hoping to contact I volun
teers at the Bridge], possibly this
quarter, and give some general di
rection as to what we're trying to do
in the long-term," Wais said.
"There's a lot of competing student
groups vying for limited space; I
cannot guarantee anything."
Wais acknowledged, however,
that no solution has l)een identified
at this point. Options include "up
grading and retrofitting the old fa
cility, using a current facility or
using a new facility," he said.

He did not say
when a final deci
sion would be
reached.
Last fall, the
University con
demned the sec
ond floor of the
building that cur
rently houses the
peer counseling

service, forcing the four live-in
counselors to relocate to the first
floor.
Recently, however, the Univer
sity has become concerned about
the structural integrity of the en
tire building. Wais considered mov
ing the Bridge to Tresidder Union.
Members of the Bridge said they
felt thus would have severely hin
dered any live-in counselor service.
Tresidder is impersonal and located
in the busy center of campus, both
characteristics that would not
make it welcoming to students
seeking counseling, students said
Bridge employees were relieved
by the Thursday nightdecision that
will allow them to remain in their
home.

"In general, we're pretty
pleased," said live-in counselor Jack
Chu, a senior. "We're under less
stress and pressure — there is no
time-crunch."
"This decision has given us some
breathing room," said fellow live-in
counselor Hayes Morehouse, a se
nior.
Volunteers are optimistic about
the Bridge's future prospects.
"Things will be resolved," Chu
said. "The decision is encouraging."
"We are very optimistic," More
house agreed. "The Bridge is a fan

tastic concept, and the people here
are great."
The Bridge currently houses
four live-in counselors and involves
more than 40 volunteers. It has ex
isted at Stanford for more than 25
years.
The University, understanding
the peer counseling service's impor
tance to the Stanford community,
remains committed to assisting the
Bridge as best as it feasibly can,
Waissaid.
"The University looks to the
Bridge as a national model in stu
dent peer counseling," Wais said.
"It has a long, distinguished history
at Stanford and provides a valuable
service to students."
"We recognize that and value it."
