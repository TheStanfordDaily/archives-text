## Junior Amori Mikami wins award for public service in psychology 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
For Amori Mikami, the adage
"better late than never" must have
new meaning.
On Friday, Mikami, a junior
majoring in psychology, received a
1997 Truman Scholarship in a
supplementary process, which oc
curred after the original one. She
is the second Stanford student to
receive this honor, which awards
$30,000 to be used toward under
graduate and graduate education.
Last week, Eric Beerbohm, a ju
nior majoring in political science,
was named the University's first
recipient of the scholarship for this
year.
In 1997, 69 students from
across the country became Tru
man scholars. The award, given by
the Truman Foundation, recog
nizes students who have displayed
a commitment to government or
public service.
Mikami said she was "over
whelmed and incredibly honored"
when notified of the award. Fur
thermore, she said, her major pro
vides the perfect opportunity to
use if. "I think psychology is a way

to carry out public service," she
said.
Mikami and Beerbohm were
two of four Stanford students
nominated earlier this year for the
Truman Scholarship. Science,
Technology and Society Program
Director Robert McGinn, Stan
ford's Trumun scholarship faculty
representative, was eager to praise
Mikami.
"I have known Amori only since
the beginning of the selection
process last October," McGinn
said. "What was striking about her
was the balance she had attained
between high (JI®A and fine schol
arship on the one hand - she had
a wonderfully supportive letter
from Psychology Prof Philip Zim
bardo — and extensive public ser
vice field work on the other."
McGinn recalled that Mikami
had shown great courage in both
the first-round and final inter
views by expressing herself coher
ently and standing up for her be
lief's.
Mikami is pursuing a cotermi
nal degree in psychology at Stan
ford and plans to pursue a doctor
ate. McGinn said this is all part of
an endeavor "not to become an
academic but to acquire and gen
erate the knowledge that will en
able her to be effective in a non
profit institution dedicated to
helping trouble youth turn
around their lives."
Mikami has spent time working
with troubled children and plans
to continue in psychology after
graduation. "My career goal is to
be a clinical psychologist and work
with disadvantaged and under
privileged children," she said.
The Stanford winners were
part of a select pool chosen from
717 candidates at 369 colleges and
universities; 202 became finalists.
After the Truman Foundation
had chosen the recipients, Stan
ford nominated Mikami as the one
and only appeal case allowed to

each school in the supplementary
competition.
McGinn said he felt she had
been unduly passed over by the
committee the first time around.
Because psychology is not on the
foundation's list of preferred acad
emic backgrounds, the committee
might not have been convinced
Mikami would use her doctoral de
gree to pursue public service, he
added.
Mikami said the application
and interview processes were
"very hard. I would call it an intel
lectual, emotional and spiritual so
journ. It forced me to clarify all my
career goals and aspirations and
harness my passion for public ser
vice."
The supplementary round of
interviews was held in Denver last
Friday with a panel including
prominent figures such as a Col
orado State Supreme Court justice
and the Truman Foundation exec
utive director. McGinn learned of
Mikami's award the same night.
