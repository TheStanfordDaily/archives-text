# Following the food chain

A bit of darkness from between the stars drops down
and intercepts an insect. With a flap of kite-strutUKl
wings, a bat appears out of the void. Its night of hunting
has just begun.

Afler the moon glides across the sky, the tiny predator

will return home — to a condominium suspended in the trees.
Recently installed by the Facilities Operations Division, the new

bat houses provide perches for more than 300 bats. The 2-foot cubes an
open at the bottom, providing an entryway for bats to crawl up, carpen-

ter Dave Bell said. Covered in tar paper and positioned toward the southern
horizon, these houses provide the bats with cozy shelter — though perhaps

not as luxurious as the Bat Cave.
The bats live in the crevices of the red tile roofs. Some
times the night creatures made their way inside the

buildings, swooping among the stacks in Meyer

Library. Facilities Operations lured the bats
away by spraying the sides of the houses with

guano, Facilities Manager Herb Fong said,
then putting up netting to keep them from

The bat houses are part of a larger move
ment to use natural predators on cam
niifl

"We don't want to discourage them

Fong said. "They can eat their

weight in insects. And
they minimize the use of

I chemicals."
Sponsored Projects Office
Information Editor Bonnie Hale, a team mem

cue, agreed. "We are thrilled that Facilities ()|M'r

ation.s has explored the issues and is willing to try sev
era! environmentally friendlier alternatives," she said.
Other environmental efforts include preserving cavities it

trees. "Birds use them for nesting purposes," Kong said. "W<
won't remove the dead limhs until after summer."
These birds make formidable predators. Owls catch one or two
rodents each night, more during nesting season, while hawks also

Hale said. "The best ways to encourage
natural predators to remain here are to
reduce habitat and food destruction."
Facilities Operations is responsible

for more than 400 acres, from the land

said. The area covers a diversity of

plant and animal life, from eucalyp
tus to palm trees, from raptors to
rats.
There are many advantages to
using the "food chain method,"
rather than chemicals, in order to
control animal populations.
"Chemicals are expensive, and
people don't like the spraying
around their houses," Fong said.
"Natural predators are just as effec
tive. But they act more slowly and
require more vigilance on our part.
Timing is critical: where the infesta
tion is, what to monitor."
In comparison, pesticides and
other poison may lead to "secondary
kills," harming the population of
owls and other raptors. The poison
spreads up the food chain. Ironical
ly, these are the very predators that
could eliminate the pests.
One of the spots many owls nest
is in the indented windows in the
Knoll, an older building on campus.
Last January, Jay Kadis, an audio
engineer at the Center for Comput
er Research in Music and Acoustics
located in the Knoll, found a male
barn owl standing on the ground in
broad daylight, flexing his wings.
The unusual behavior compelled
Kadis to called Wildlife Rescue.
"Upon initial examination, I con
cluded that the bird's symptoms in
dicated he had ingested a rodent
that had been poisoned with an anti
coagulant," said Hale.
Symptoms of anticoagulant poi
soning included deep purple bruises
in the mucous membranes and
throat, Hale said. A veterinarian eu
thanized the bird when it started to
seizure.
Hale has picked up about a dozen
raptors on campus during the past

four years, mostly barn owls and
hawks, she said. About one-third
had been poisoned.
Last year, Facilities Operations
stopped its use of anti-coagulants to
control the ground squirrel popula
tion, Fong said. Complaints from
the community prompted the move
to search for nonchemical alterna
tives. However, surrounding areas
may not have followed suit.
The owl may have been poisoned
from feeding from an off-campus
site. The research center is close to
open space where anyone could be
putting out chemicals.
The center takes a different tact
toward animals by emphasizing co
habitation rather than control.
"Skunks and squirrels live here.
There are birds in the kitchen and
the occasional lizard walking down
the hallway," Kadis said.
Perhaps the center shows that
music soothes the savage beast.
Owls have nested in the building for
many years.
"The owls have been here for as
long as I have, about the last 10
years," Kadis said. The deeply set
windows on the third floor create a
secluded alcove in which owls nest.
The barn owls, graced with heart
shaped faces, hiss and clack rather
than hoot. They feed their young in
the cavernous windowsills of the
building.
The third floor has been aban
doned since the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake, Kadis said. "We don't
bug them. We consider them good
luck."
Currently, the female barn owl
— left alone without her mate — is
nesting with five to six eggs. Usually
barn owls mate monogamously for
life, and both parents participate in
the feeding.
"It might be difficult for her,"
Hale said. "We might supplement
her by putting out enough mice."
