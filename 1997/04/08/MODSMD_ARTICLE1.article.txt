# Suites eating club hit with anti-gay graffiti

### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Vandalism early yesterday morning left
one of the Suites eating clubs covered with
anti-gay slogans, drawing severe condem
nation from administrators.
Svent Hansen, the cook at The Bollard
eating club, discovered the graffiti at 7:15
a.m.
"There was so much of it, it was unbe
lievable," Hansen said.
Among the statements marked on the
walls and tables were "Gays should kill
themselves" and "Faggots are the down
fall of the U.S."

By noon yesterday, most of the graffiti
had been cleaned up.
Hansen said the vandals stole a clock
from the wall and littered ice cream and
coffee grounds on the floor. He also said
someone had vomited outside the door.
According to Lisa Webb, the residence
dean for Governor's Corner, Lagunita
Court and Roble Hall, students who were
in the eating clubs between 2 and 2:30
a.m. have said there was no graffiti at
that time.
Webb said there were no signs of forced
entry, which led her to believe that those
responsible either had keys or "were given
access" to the club.

The club's general manager, junior
Sara Buss, said the only people with keys
were the 65 club members, including all
residents of Anderson and the top floor of
Griffin, two eating associates and the club
staff.
"People aren't too stringent about let
ting people into the clubs," Buss said. "To
be honest, it's not too hard to get into the
clubs."
She admitted that it was "fair to as
sume" that the vandal or vandals were ei
ther club members or let in by a club mem
bers.
"We hope it's not a member of the club,"
Buss said. "I personally don't think it is."

Administrators said police and internal
efforts were under way to solve the crime
and issued strong condemnations.
"I think it's a very sad day at Stanford,
especially if we find out that this graffiti
that was done by Stanford students," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. The writer of
some of the graffiti claimed to be a student
at UC-Berkeley.
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds said anyone caught
would face criminal prosecution and, if he
or she is a Stanford student, prosecution
through the University judicial system.
The last major instance of anti-gay
vandalism on campus concerned the Gay

Liberation sculpture near the Quad. Of
eight suspects in that case, five were con
victed of misdemeanor vandalism
charges and one was charged with a
felony. The remaining two suspects were
exonerated.
Webb said she has been in contact with
representatives of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center and is "plan
ning to work with them and other mem
bers of the community about a proactive
response," possibly including program
ming in dorms.
LGBCC Adviser Troy Gilbert deferred
comment until he receives more informa
tion on the incident.
