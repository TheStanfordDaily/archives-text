## Blizzards pound Midwest Flood warnings extended after worst flooding in years 
### 
GRANITE FALLS, Minn. (AP) - Volunteers
raced to stack more sandbags yesterday, afraid that
the meltdown from a spring blizzard could worsen
what's already some of the most severe flooding on the
northern Plains in years.
Across the Plains, fields were sheets of white
stretching to the horizon after a storm over the week
end left more than 2 feet of snow in places.
In northwestern Minnesota, along the Red River
that forms the state line with North Dakota, bright
sunshine melted a little snow, but the real thaw is
expected Thursday or Friday, said Mark Seeley, cli
matologist with the University of Minnesota Exten
sion Service.
"Everything predicted for the lied is a flood of his
toric proportions," he said.
The National Weather Service issued a flood warn
ing extending for the next two weeks along parts of
three rivers in other parts of Minnesota — the Min
nesota, Mississippi and St. Croix.
There was no quick way to gauge how bad the
flooding might become once the snow melts, but 4 to 5
inches of heavy, late-season snow could be equal to I
inch of rain, Seeley said.
In Granite Falls, wind-blown snow stung the faces
of workers stacking sandbags on the levees as they
worked to protect about 40 homes along the Minneso
ta River.
Flood victims and weary out-of-town volunteers
trapped by the snowstorm stuck it out in a shelter at
the high school gym.
"We've had so much fun here — floods, blizzard.
We're expecting the asteroid next," said Red Cross vol
unteer Karen Barck from Marshall, 30 miles away.
She had been at the shelter since Thursday.
Residents were told to drink bottled water after
sewage backed up into the Granite Falls water supply.
A highway-model snow blower was used as a pump,
sucking water off the streets and spraying it in a 100-

foot-high arc over the levee back into the river.
In northwestern Minnesota, rising water from the
Wild Rice and Marsh rivers forced the evacuation of
about 1,000 residents of Ada, a town of 1,700.
"We're absolutely overwhelmed," Mayor Russ
Onstad said from one of the town's few working
phones. "We're getting water from north, south and
east."
President Clinton signed a statewide disaster dec
laration yesterday because of South Dakota's blizzard
and the flooding. There was no immediate word on
declarations for other states in the region. Thousands
remained without power.
Floods across the Midwest, m 1993 were blamed for
48 deaths and $10 billion in damage in nine states.
Temperatures dropped to zero yesterday at Dickin
son, N.D., and Bemidji, Minn., recorded a wind chill of
37 below zero.
Outside Wahpeton, N.D., along the Red River, Tom
Kubela's wheat and bean fields were entombed in ice
that was 15 feet deep in spots.
"It's kind of neat looking," he said. "There's ridges
in it. They look like little snowbanks. There was 50
mph winds making whitecaps in the yard. They froze
in midair."
Kubela's farm is just 100 yards away from the Bois
de Sioux River, a tributary to the Red River. His fam
ily has lived there for 110 years, and this is the worst
weather anyone can remember.
"You expect it, but when you get a major flood and
throw in a blizzard and a deep freeze afterwards
nothing like this has every happened here," he said.
Across the river in Breckenridge, Minn., Jason
Matteson drove his ice-covered four-wheel-drive, all
terrain vehicle looking for an open store to buy diapers
for his 2-year-old son. Matteson said he's been using
towels since Saturday.
"I'm in dire need," he said. "The boy's not slowing
down."
