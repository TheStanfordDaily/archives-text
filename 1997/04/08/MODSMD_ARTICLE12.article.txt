Poet Ginsberg remembered
NEW YORK (AP) — Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg was
remembered yesterday by several hundred shoeless mourners who sat
on pillows surrounding his coffin in a ceremony that combined elements
of Buddhism and Judaism.
Ginsberg had liver cancer and died of a heart attack Saturday at 70.
Though born to Jewish parents, he was a Buddhist, beginning each day
with a contemplative exercise followed by a hot cup of tea with lemon.
Ginsberg's remains were to be cremated.
Ginsberg shattered conventions as poet laureate of the Beat Genera
tion in the 1950s and influenced the next four decades of art, music and
politics. Followers included Abbie Hoffman and Bob Dylan, as well as
Generation X-ers who listened to him recite his poetry on MTV.
Clinton, Netanyahu meet
WASHINGTON (AP) — With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu at his side, President Clinton declared yesterday that he
would explore "any reasonable opportunity" to get Mideast peace talks
back on track. But he refused to endorse Netanyahu's call for a Camp
David-style summit.

At the outset of a two-hour White House meeting, Clinton said he
agreed with Netanyahu that Israel should not have to make concessions
to the Palestinians to end terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians. "No one
should ever have to bargain to be free from terrorism," Clinton said.
Clinton also renewed his call for a statement from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of "zero tolerance" for terrorism.
Afterward, Clinton described his talks with Netanyahu as "very thor
ough," but there was no sign of a breakthrough.
Clinton said he would consider "any reasonable opportunity" to get
peace talks up and going again. But he indicated he was not prepared to
set up a summit meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat under U.S.
auspices or make any other dramatic move right away.
Rebels take diamond-mining heartland
MBUJI-MAYI, Zaire (AP) — Laurent Desire Kabila (lew into this dia
mond-mining heartland yesterday to survey the latest conquest by his
rebel force in its six-month battle to unseat President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
Kabila arrived in Mbuji-Mayi accompanied by foreign diamond-min
ing executives. "Ixiurent! Laurent!" a group of young men chanted at
the airport. About 100 teen-age boys yelled "Desire! Desire!"

As Kabila arrived in triumph, a protest march against Mobutu in the
capital of Kinshasa, 600 miles away, was broken up by soldiers who
drove armored vehicles into the crowd, hurling tear gas and beating
protesters with whips and sticks.
"We are ready to die to end the dictatorship of Mobutu and his clique.
Mobutu must die — he is torturing us by living," said Faranka A(i, one
of about 3,500 people who marched toward downtown and Parliament.
Despite the forceful end to the march, there wore no immediate reports
of injuries.
American girls reach puberty earlier
CHICAGO (AP) — American girls reach puberty earlier than com
monly believed, with nearly half of black girls and 15 percent of white
ones beginning to develop sexually by age H, a study indicates.
The study raises troubling questions about whether environmental
estrogens, chemicals that mimic the female hormone estrogen, are
bringing on puberty at an earlier age.
It also suggests that sex education should begin sooner than it often
does, researchers said.
The research is in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics, published
by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
