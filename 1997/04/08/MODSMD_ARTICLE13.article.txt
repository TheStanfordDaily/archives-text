The University must do
more to encourage the
hiring of female profs

Nearly five years after
a comprehensive report was
released revealing how far
behind Stanford lagged in compen
sating, promoting and hiring
female employees, the University
still sits at the bottom of a list of
comparable institutions.
Progress has been "slow but
steady," according to Provost Con
doleezza Rice, and the situation
should continue to improve as more
women are tenured. But there are
steps the University could take to
expedite the process.
The report found that in 1993
women earned an average of 87
percent of a male full professor's
salary, and it further found that
they made up only 15.8 percent of
the faculty and 11.2 percent of the
tenured faculty.
Today's numbers don't look
much better. Female professors
made up 17.8 percent of the faculty
in 1995-96 and 13.3 percent of the
tenured faculty. While the average
salary is up to 92.5 percent of a
male professor's, women in some
departments — particularly in the
School of Engineering — are still
making only 80 percent as much as
their male counterparts.
Rice has a number of explana
tions for the slow progress, most of
which are legitimate and under
standable. Comparing the percent
age of women who are tenured
now with the percent in the same
position five years ago, for exam
ple, may not reflect the Universi
ty's efforts, as professors hired 10
years ago might just now be com
ing up for tenure.
That's true, but it doesn't justify
Stanford dismal record in moving
toward gender equality.
Women are making significantly
less than men in engineering and

natural sciences departments, Rice
argued, because they hadn't started
entering those fields in substantial
numbers until recently. Here, Stan
ford has the perfect opportunity to
make a difference. The combination
of top engineering and computer
science departments and a 50-per
cent female undergraduate student
body should make Stanford a leader
in producing women headed for
academia in these same fields.
But these women need role
models. Other than Rice, only 12
of 90 associate deans and depart
ment heads are women, leaving
Stanford's female students with
few exemplars to look up to. Not a
single dean in a university with
seven schools is female.
In order to engender the changes
needed for balance in the future,
Stanford must start now. The way
to do it is not through a quota sys
tem — as History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo suggested at a March Faculty
Senate meeting — but simply by
making a conscious effort to
include women in the pool consid
ered for hiring and to help ensure
that not so much effort will be nec
essary five years from now.
A quota system, as Rice rightful
ly pointed out, would only harm the
process by giving women the
impression they were hired to satis
fy numbers rather than because of
their skill. But there's no need for
specific numerical goals to prod the
University to make progress.
And when it does move forward,
it needs to do so faster than it has
since 1993. At the time, Stanford
was a "bottom feeder," as Business
Prof. Joanne Martin put it at the
March senate meeting, when com
pared to 21 other schools in terms
of proportion of female faculty
members. It has moved up no more
than a few places now.
There are few if any arenas of
education in which the University
would allow itself to rank 21st. A
school with Stanford's penchant
for excellence should be ashamed
that its treatment of women has let
it sink so low.
