## The 						resonance of the heart 
### 
ON A BLUSTERY day in 1940, a 42-
mph wind destroyed the Tacoma
Narrows Bridge. The 2,800-foot
span gyrated and swung like a Vegas
showgirl until it finally collapsed.
Fifty-seven years later, I spent four
days of my spring break alone in the
Grand Canyon. I lived life at my own pace
and relied on no one but myself. One
night, I came across a secluded beach on
the Colorado River. The fiery red sunset
faded over the swirling rapids of the river
and into a comet larger than the belt of
Orion. As I swam through the unknown,
I felt like I had found heaven on Earth.
But I would have given anything to be
more like the collapsing bridge.
That bridge, on the point of destruc
tion, possessed a quality I lacked in the
canyon. The external force of the winds
combined with the natural undulation of
the span created a phenomenon I was
unable to achieve by myself.
Resonance.
Resonance, as I learned in Physics 51,
is what occurs when an external force acts
on an oscillation system, simultaneously
matching its phase and frequency. The
cooperative movement of the oscillations
gradually increases beyond the scope of
either original amplitude.
It's like swinging in a playground.
You jump off the ground and begin the
oscillation of the swing and then kick out
at the same point in your arc, flying
higher and higher until you lose control.

For the Tacoma Narrows, that particu
lar day's wind matched the bridge's nat
ural movement and accelerated it
beyond its physical limits.
I quested for an internal parallel to
this wonder of physical mechanics and
tried to find resonance in the canyon.
That night on the river, I even reached
the proverbial "oneness with nature." I
was living in tune with my surroundings,
and together we achieved harmony, a
calm serenity. But though I matched the
rhythm, I could not augment it. I was at
peace but not impassioned.
With no wish to engineer nature to fit
my constraints, I was content to shape
myself to its dictum. The wilderness
echoed within me, but it did not resound.
The beautiful irony is that the physical
world could not provide the force which I
sought. Amid the techie worlds of civil
engineering and physics, of bridges and
wavelengths, I unexpectedly discovered
resonance in the most fuzzy of places. I
found it in another person.
Imagine putting one hand on your
heart and pressing your ear up against
someone's bare chest. The syncopation
and divergent rhythms are a starting
point. Alter your breathing, change your
thoughts and focus on the person
beneath you, and slowly you may bring
the pounding of your hearts closer
together. Try hard enough and the beats
will come into synchronicity. And maybe
the realization of this togetherness, this

incredible intimacy, will drive your inter
nal tempo consensually faster and faster,
to the point of euphoria.
The most powerful and scariest quality
of resonance is that we can never achieve
it independently. It is a phenomenon that
can spontaneously occur when two forces
or beings have the same defining quality
that builds off itself. But if you're like me
and are not content to wait for some cos
mic coincidence to bring your emotional
clone to you, there is a certain measure of
adaptation and compromise necessary to
reach the ultimate synergy.
It is the ultimate because you must
give up something of yourself to tran
scend your previous limits. You walk the
line of destruction and collapse. But you
do it anyway because you want so badly
to escalate your emotions beyond your
personal limits and on to a state of pure
passion.
I find few things more pure and inspir
ing than the wilderness. But not even the
overwhelming beauty of a sunset over the
canyon compares to the feeling of launch
ing onto the very literal wavelength of
another person. Only then can I find the
resonance inside of myself.
