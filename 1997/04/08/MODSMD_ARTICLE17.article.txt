Homophobia takes its toll, but victims remain strong

WHEN I WALKED out to my car
in the Rains parking lot Thurs
day, I was greeted by the word
"fag" in big, black letters written on my
rainbow-flag bumper sticker. Although
not pleasant, it was probably a random
occurrence not targeted specifically at
me, as they got the gender wrong and
all. So why am I writing about it?
First, people should know that these
things happen. And two, to explain the
serious impact of the occurrence, which
an alarming number of people fail to rec
ognize: Homophobic actions closet peo
ple, instill fear and exacerbate the het
erosexism that permeates this culture.
On a practical level, defacing sym
bols of queer pride forces people back
in the closet. I'm not interested in hav
ing the word fag on my car, so Fve
removed the symbol. This action has
implications for both others and

myself. For many lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgendered people, having pride
symbols in public spaces helps build
community and counter feelings of
shame. For me, the bumper sticker was
symbolic of my personal struggle to
come out and embrace this part of my
identity; its mutilation reminds me
that, no matter how tired I get, the
struggle never ends.
The occurrence brings up thousands
of years of violence, repression and
shame that continue today— a history
that is with me always but is forced to
the surface by these kinds of actions.
The origin of the word fag alone —
gays were utilized as the faggot, or
bundles of sticks, to start the fires used
to burn other groups of people in Nazi
Germany — advances images of
extreme violence and suffering. It also
reminds me of a personal history of

harassment and fear, especially
because they did it at my home.
Finally, this kind of blatant homopho
bia makes the everyday heterosexism
that builds up for me intolerable. Every
time a document requests the name of
my spouse but not my partner or some
one unfamiliar with my personal life
asks about a boyfriend, part of me feels
erased. And, of course, any reference to
someone who defies rigid gender roles
and is, therefore, perceived as homosex
ual is sure to get a laugh in stories told
by friends or on television sitcoms.
I am sure that a supportive queer
community exists on this campus. I am
an engineering graduate student and
consequently have not had time to seek
it out. So I have found that, in general,
my environment either denies my exis
tence or relegates me to a joke. Most
days I manage not to feel it. "Fag" on

my car makes it hard to ignore. It
makes an unpleasant environment a
hostile one.
The one positive aspect of my story
involves the response of the Universi
ty's Department of Public Safety. The
officers with whom I filed charges were
supportive and clearly took the crime
seriously — hate crimes are a felony. I
want to thank them for making the
experience considerably less painful
than it could have been.
There's actually one more reason
I'm writing this letter. I want to con
gratulate the person who did this: You
successfully ruined my day. But I have
been through too much to live in
shame, to live in fear, to live in silence.
In your broader goals, conscious or not,
you have failed.
