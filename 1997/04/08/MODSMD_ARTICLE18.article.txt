# Axess, some databases reside on Forsythe, not 'on' MacSamson
## 
### 
In The Daily's Friday article about
the forthcoming availability of Axess via
the World Wide Web, it used somewhat
misleading terminology. It referred to
the current incarnation of Axess as being
available "on Mac Samson." Mac Samson
may indeed be the application used by
most on-campus students to get to
Axess, but it is merely a tool, not the
actual system itself.
The actual Axess application is "on"
Forsythe. Forsythe is an IBM mainframe
system which (as the editorial in the
same issue pointed out) supports many
University administrative and financial
functions, as well as a large number of
research databases.
The Forsythe system is a "host," and

Mac Samson is one of many programs that
can be used as a "client" to connect to the
system via the telnet protocol. Mac Sa
mson can be used to connect to other host
systems, including the shared UNIX sys
tems like the Elaines and the Amys.
When most people connect to
Forsythe, they enter Folio, a front end
that provides a menu to select one of the
databases. Most students are mainly
familiar with Axess (for student infor
mation) and Socrates (the library cata
log). Folio also provides access to many
other useful and interesting databases
and services, including:
• Lexis-Nexis, full-text access to busi
ness and legal information and general
news from many periodicals.
• Econlit, a bibliography of economics
literature (journals and other publica
tions)
• Quotations, a database of quota
tions. (Find out who said what!)
To access these databases, type
"select" and then the database name

(e.g., "select econlit") once you have
logged on to Folio. To see a full list of all
available databases, simply type "select."
