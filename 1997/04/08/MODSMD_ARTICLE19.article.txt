# Peace in the Mideast hinges on a halt to settlement-building
## 
### 
While I disagree with much of what
Jim Finsten had to say in Thursday's
Daily. I welcome his assertion that
"most Jews on this campus have serious
concerns about the expansion of settle
ments." If this is how Finsten and others
feel about settlements, why are they not
expressing their outrage against Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's settle
ment policy?
Since the decision to start building in
East Jerusalem, the United States has

vetoed two U.N. Security Council resolu
tions condemning the settlement, resolu
tions no other security council member
voted against. I challenge Finsten and
others to practice what they preach and
insist that the United States joins the
rest of the world in passing the U.N. res
olutions condemning Israel's decision to
restart settlement-building.
As a m*yor aid donor to Israel, the
United States can do a lot more than it is
currently doing to stop new settlements.
Will Finsten publicly support actions simi
lar to those taken by President Bush, who
conditioned further loan guarantees on a
halt to settlement-building?
As someone who has supported the
peace process from the very beginning, I
believe that those who support peace
must recognize that settlements destroy
the peace process and must therefore
speak out against them, not give tacit
approval by their silence.
