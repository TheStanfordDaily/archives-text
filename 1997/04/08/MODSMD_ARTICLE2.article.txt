### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
History Prof.
Jack Rakove was
awarded the 1997
Pulitzer Prize in
history yesterday
for his acclaimed
book, "Original
Meanings: Poli
tics and Ideas in
the Making of the
Constitution."

The book recounts the period
leading up to the adoption of the
U.S. Constitution.
Rakove knew he was in the run
ning for the honor, but because he
recently missed winning another
major history award, he said he
was never certain.
"It can all be a bit of a crap
shoot," Rakove admitted. When
he learned yesterday around noon
that he had won the prize, howev
er, his doubts turned to "extraor
dinary pleasure and delight.
"I'm very attached to this
book," he said. "It was a dozen
years' work more or less. It t6ok
much longer to finish than I would
have expected.
In the book, "I try to convey the
deep sense of seriousness of what
[the Founding Fathers] were
doing," Rakove explained. "I try to
enter into their mental world . . .
and show how consequential the
issues they were grappling with
were."
While Rakove may bask in the

glory of a Pulitzer, he won't be sit
ting still for long. "I got a lot of
projects going," he said.
Rakove is working on a new
book, "Declaring Rights: A Con
stitutional Dilemma," which is to
be published later this year. For
his next msyor effort, Rakove said,
he hopes to ground some of the
major contemporary issues of our
day, such as term limits, in a his
torical context.
In a press release, History Prof.
David Kennedy described Rakove
as a historian with three gifts: al
lowing readers to understand
"afresh" familiar subjects, relat
ing the past to the present with
ease and refraining from "grand
conceptualizing," which can hin -
der historical writing.
In addition to its importance
for students of American history,
Rakove's prize-winning work ah io
is relevant to other fields.
Political scientists interested in
constitutionalism will find the
book useful, Rakove explained.
This is especially true in light of
the efforts to create stable cont ;ti
tution&l structures in many of <„he
new democracies of the world s» jch
as those in Eastern Europe and
South Africa.
"Its biggest contribution is to
the law," however, explained.
John Ferejohn, a political science
professor and senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
There are schools of legal inter


Rakove
pretation that depend on the orig
inal intent of the Founding Fa
thers, Ferejohn said.
In his book, Rakove argues
against the sole use of "original
ism," the practice of interpreting
the Constitution according to an
immutable set of the framers' in
tentions.
"Originalism rests on the as
sumption that a coherent, unsul
lied set of meanings was somehow
locked into the Constitution at the
moment of its adoption," Rakove
wrote recently in The Stanford
Historian. This ignores "the dy
namic, creative, experimental na
ture" of the early days of Ameri
can constitutionalism.
Rakove's book offers a "careful
reconstruction" of the adoption of
the Constitution, thus providing

"the most sustained penetrating"
examination of original intent,
Ferejohn said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest,
an expert on constitutional law,
concurred with that assessment.
"I think that his book is perhaps
the most thoughtful and in
formed thing that's ever been
written about original intent ," he
said.
Brest said he imagined that his
torians would like to impact peo
ple's thinking and that Rakove's
book succeeds in that goal.
"Whether it will influence the
Supreme Court, I don't know,"
Brest admitted, "nor do I think he
wrote it for that reason."
"I think it's a first-rate book,
and I'm glad it got the recognition
it deserved," Brest said.
The Pulitzer comes with a
$5,000 cash award from Columbia
University. Rakove is the only ac
tive member of the History De
partment with a Pulitzer.
