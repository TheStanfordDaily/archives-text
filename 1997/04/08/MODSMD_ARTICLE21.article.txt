# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Martyrdom's nice, but not for someone you know 
### 
I GUESS IT really hit me over spring
break, and what made it hit me was
the phone number. For a few years
now, my parents have been talking about
moving, and the idea has never really
bothered me. On the contrary, when
they talk about moving to Manhattan, I
kind of like the idea.
I'm Tine with the idea that what's
been my room for the past 20 years and
five months won't be any longer. After
all, now that I'm spending most of my
time in California, that room hasn't real
ly felt like home for a while. Likewise,
I'm fine with the idea that the drugstore
in the next town that my family's been
patronizing since before I was born
won't be our drugstore any longer, and
I'm fine with the idea that it will become
much more difficult to get Sonny's
bagels and Town Hall sloppy joes. (In the
certain part of New Jersey I come from,
sloppy joes are triple-decker, multiple
meat deli sandwiches. They're not, heav
en forbid, Manwiches.)
But I'm really upset that the phone
number will disappear. I'm not talking
about "my" line — the private phone
number I received in middle school as a
suburban right of passage — but rather
about the line that's been in the house
since we moved there. For as long as I can
remember, for as long as I've ever known

any phone number, 762-0162 has been
home. And it won't be any longer.
Which got me to thinking about just
why my parents want to move anyway. It's
not that they simply think the house is too
big with both their kids gone. (The plan is
to move after my brother leaves for college
in a year.) It's not that they have lots of
good friends living somewhere else and
they want to move there. It's not that they
don't like the area — my father works 20
minutes in one direction, my mother five
minutes in the other, and South Orange on
a good-traffic day is only a half-hour from
New York's Theater District.
And it'll certainly be an ordeal to move.
They've spent 20 years renovating, redeco
rating and otherwise settling into our
house; now they'll need to start again.
They'll certainly end up in a smaller place;
where will all the stuff go? They both grew
up where we live now; they graduated
from the same high school that I did and
my brother will. Leaving won't be easy.
So the question, then, is why? Why are
they doing it? Why do they want to leave
the place they've spent their entire lives,
where their kids grew up, and why do
they want to leave the house they've
spent 20 years perfecting?
It's a simple answer but, alas, not a
noble one. Money.
For nearly every American family, a

house is its most significant investment.
And, truth be told, the value of my fami
ly's house is falling.
Just before I went home for break, the
magazine New Jersey Monthly published
an investigation showing how the value of
homes in each of the state's municipali
ties had changed in the last 10 years and
the last five years. South Orange had not
fared well. While I was at home, The New
York Times published an article on the
change in home values for each ZIP code
in the tri-state area of New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut. South Orange's
ZIP code has gone down.
The sad fact is that home prices are
falling in South Orange because the town
isn't what it used to be. In my lifetime
alone, nearly all of the small, independent
retailers in the town center have closed.
Where a jeweler stood for years we now
have a Dunkin Donuts. The hardware
store where all of the employees knew me
by name is now a Blockbuster. The sta
tionery store that had been there forever
just became a chicken chain, sort of a
down-scale Boston Market.
The schools keep getting worse and
worse, with standardized test scores
falling, statewide rankings declining and
college acceptances getting less impres
sive. No one's gotten into Stanford since
my year.

I don't know what the town's crime
statistics are, but I do know that more and
more people are getting alarm systems.
Three years ago I had my car radio stolen
from my high school's parking lot.
Even sadder than what's becoming of
my hometown — and, I'm sure, others
like it around the country — is that no
one is really willing to fight the decline of
those cities and towns. I can't say I blame
them in the slightest, but why don't my
parents stay there, in the town they've
spent nearly all their lives in, and work to
make it better?
How will it ever recover if the long
standing residents — and particularly the
affluent ones — keep leaving?
But, on the other hand, why should I
possibly expect them to stay? It's all well
and good to discuss staying in a decaying
neighborhood to help fight for truth, jus
tice and the American way, but, frankly,
I don't need to be the one to do it
(although I'm not suggesting that my
hometown has reached the point of
"decaying" — at least not yet).
What I wonder is where, eventually,
people will end up. My grandparents left
Newark in the midst of the huge white
(light from that city, and my parents will
soon leave South Orange on what I pre
sume is the very early end of that town's
white (light. Kventually, I guess, America's

middle class — and certainly its upper
middle class — will have no choice but to
live in Kansas, having slowly tied inward,
away from the ever-expanding social ills
emanating from the cities.
That's the kind of realization that
tends to make liberals like myself — and
like my parents, for that matter — realize
that someone really ought to stand up and
do the right thing Someone, essentially,
ought to martyr himself. To become a
martyr, though, requires one to die fight
ing for ideals, and though I'm only using
the term in a metaphorical sense here, I
don't particularly want whatever the
appropriate death-equivilent may be to
happen to me or my family.
So 1 guess my parents, then, are doing
the predictable, even the — perish the
thought — conservative thing. And I guess
I fully endorse that conservative decision.
But at least it's not too predictable.
Always one to Ih> creative, my parents, as
they leave the suburb in which 1 grew up,
will become one of the very few examples
of white (light into the city.
