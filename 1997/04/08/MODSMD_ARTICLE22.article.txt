## Women's water polo wins four straight Cardinal exacts revenge on California in close 5-4 matchup 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The third time was the charm Thursday
for the women's water polo team as it
defeated California 5-4 in its third attempt
in three weeks. That was the first victory of
four for the squad this weekend at deGuerre
Pool.
The Cardinal defeated Pacific, UC-Davis
and San Jose State also, but it was the game
against the Golden Bears that highlighted
the weekend.
"This is probably the best game we have
ever played," said sophomore co-captain
Lindsay Tam. "We did not get frustrated.
We knew we had it."
Cal drew first blood by scoring in wnat
would become a defensive battle. It was
freshman Suze Gardner that found the net
on a four-meter penalty shot to even the
game at 1-1. But shortly thereafter the Gold
en Bears scored again to give them the lead
at the half.

Out of the locker room the two teams
continued to trade goals. Junior Julie Baker
came off the bench to beat the Cal keeper
twice and Tam scored once.
With the game tied at four apiece, senior
co-captain Alice Cathcart put the Cardinal
on top for good. This allowed the squad to
run out the clock as sophomore goalkeeper
Heather Crary thwarted each attempt by the
Golden Bears to even the game and take the
lead.
"This was a very good defensive game.
This was also the first game of the season
that was a total team effort," said head
coach Ben Quittner.
The squad's next game was a blowout
Saturday against underdog Pacific. Stanford
had its way with the Tigers on the path to an
18-5 victory.
Stanford's next opponent, Davis, did not
lay down as easily and battled to within two
goals of the favored Cardinal before falling
9-7.
Despite the close score, the Cardinal con

trolled the tempo and relied heavily on the
outstanding play of sophomore Lindsay
Welsh and freshman Ellen Estes to hold off
the Aggies.
The Cardinal's last game against San
Jose State was a rout as the Cardinal and
senior Tamar Engel earned a 18-0 shutout
over the Spartans.
Stanford is getting geared up for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Cham
pionships this weekend and has gained con
fidence through improved bench play that
should help greatly in the tournament. This
improvement has come mainly from Tain
and Baker.
"The game against Cal was particularly
important because the usual top three scor
ers were not the ones generating the goals,"
Cathcart said. "Spreading the scoring out
has been a really big problem for us."
The three-day MPSF tourney hosted by
the Gauchos gets underway Fridayat UC-
Santa Barbara, and Cal and Stanford are the
favorites.
