# Track shines in Texas and San Francisco

### Becky Unruh 
The Cardinal track team had one thing on its
mind prior to last weekend's competitions: to
showcase its talent. That's exactly what the
squad did with excellent performances at both
the Texas Relays and the San Francisco State
Invitational.
Much of the team took the weekend off, while
some members tuned up at the San Francisco
competition. The meet also provided an added
opportunity for athletes to qualify for Pacific 10
Conference Championships next month.
The Texas Relays proved to be the stage for
fierce competition and nail-biting finishes.
Texas was also a homecoming of sorts for many
on the team. The men's 1,500-meter relay team
ran away from Arkansas, a middle- and long
distance powerhouse, to finish first with a time
of 15 minutes, 22.55 seconds.
Redshirt freshmen Brad and Brent Hauser,
who are twins, are Texas natives, along with
junior Jason Lunn, who anchored the relay. The
fourth runner, freshman Michael Stember, is a
"Texan by heart," said head coach Vin Lanan
na.
Stanford also came away with a second-place
finish in the 800-meter relay with a time of
7:26.49, only a few-tenths of a second behind
first-place Rice. Redshirt junior J.J. White,
sophomore Jake Maas and Lunn ran the first
three legs with Stember taking care of the
anchoring duties. The Cardinal finished fourth
in the distance medley with a time of 9:49.93.
White was joined by senior Jimmie Johnson,
Maas and Brent Hauser.
Two other Texas natives were also on hand
to show off their skills in the meet hosted by the
Longhorns. Freshman Toby Stevenson shat
tered his pole, but was still able to clear 17 feet,
1 1/2 inches in the pole vault. Sophomore run
ner Damon Dunn also turned in a Pac-10 quali
fying mark in the 100 meters.
Meanwhile, other members of the squad
were showing off their talent closer to home.
The women especially turned in great perfor
mances at the San Francisco State Invitational.
Senior Amanda White and junior Kortney Dun
scombe turned in Pac-10 qualifying times, fin
ishing second and third in the 1,500 meters at
4:35.30 and 4:35.85, respectively. Similarly,
junior Bernadette Armand ran to a first- place
finish and a Pac-10 qualifying time in the 100-
meter hurdles. Sophomore Jen Carr finished
with an NCAA provisional qualifying time of 59
seconds in the 400-meter hurdles, and she also
finished second in the 800 meters with a time
of 2:16.65.
Sophomore Tracye Lawyer, sophomore Tara
Oettinger and junior Katrinka Jackson finished
1-2-3 in the long jump at 19-2 1/4, 18-0 1/2 and
17-9 3/4, respectively. Lawyer's jump was
enough to qualify her for Pac-lOs. Junior Rhon
da Witmer and Oettinger finished first and sec

ond in the triple jump with leaps of 38-6 1/4 and
36-10 1/4, respectively.
Freshman Allison Beatty tossed the javelin
140-10, enough to earn her a first-place finish.
Junior Sami Jo Small accomplished the same in
the discus, hurling it 151-8, which qualifies her
for Pac-lOs as well. Jackson, Lawyer and red
shirt sophomore Gina Heads had a clean sweep
in the shot put, finishing first, second and third
with marks of 45 1/2, 43-1 and 42-1 1/4, respec
tively. Lawyer again qualified for Pac-lOs with
her toss.
Senior Marlon Evans came away from the

meet with second-place showings in both the
100 meters and 200 meters with times of 11.02
and 22.40 seconds, respectively. Sophomore
Marc Mazzoni finished second in the hammer
with a toss of 180-9. Junior Adam Fusco fin
ished first in tho pole vault with a jump of l(i
3/4.
Lananna said that he was very pleased with
his team's performance over the weekend and
that he was looking forward to showcasing the
team throughout the month. Many competed in
off events, which speaks even more for the tal
ent and depth on the squad.
