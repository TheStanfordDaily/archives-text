# Water causes problems
## Golf struggles at ASU Invite 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
The water holes at the Karsten Golf Course
unnerved the Stanford women's golf team, which
finished ninth at the Ping / ASU Invitational last
weekend.
But despite the Cardinal's balls plunking into
the water numerous times, the par-72 course pro
vided plenty of opportunities for other team play
ers to score below par and at par.
Arizona's sophomore Marisa Baena, named last
year's NCAA player of the year, was the only
golfer of the 92 team players to score under 70.
She scored a 5 under par in the first round, to help
her team win the tournament.
Stanford senior Mhairi McKay, who tied for
first at last year's tournament with a par average,
placed fourth. She averaged 73.6 after three
rounds last weekend.
During the second round, McKay was penalized
two strokes for a technical regulation. McKay
would have tied for second without the penalty
strokes.
On the par-5 fifth hole, McKay impressed the
crowds by hitting 270 yards off the tee with a 4-
iron. While most of the intercollegiate players
needed to hit 120 yards on the second stroke,
McKay shot (55 yards to the green for a birdie.
The Cardinal team struggled during the first
round, placing 13th out of 16 teams after the first
day of the tournament. The water holes lining the
ninth and 18th holes tried the mental stamina of
the players.
In the first round, freshman .Julie Dunn made a
quintuple bogey on the 18th hole, hitting nine
strokes on a par 4. The final hole is known to be
particularly difficult because of water holes lining
the entire left side of the fairway.
"To see all that water when you're standing on
the tee is intimidating," Dunn said.
Her ball dropped in the water twice on that
hole.
"You have to stay focused because if you start,
thinking about the water, like -Julie did, inevitably
that's where the ball's going to land," said head
coach Caroline O'Connor.
Dunn, who tied for 39th place, improved her
score after she bogeyed and parred the 18th in the
second and third rounds, respectively.
After scoring a disappointing 83 in the first
round, Dunn showed more aggressive play on the
second and third day, going straight for the pins.
On the par-4 fourth hole, which is lined with
water holes to the left of the green, Dunn aimed
for the pin. While the ball bailed to the right, she
chipped in a 35-foot putt to birdie the hole.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro bogeyed all the par 5s on
the first round. While she struck the ball well, she
strained on her putting, O'Connor said.
Her balls ran flushed to the ground on the hard
and fast greens. Ro averaged 78 after three rounds
(78, 82,76).
Other team results include
sophomore Michelle Sperry, who
tied for 58th place, with 81, 79
and 80 and sophomore Jenny
Pippin, who scored 82 and 83 on
the first and third rounds. Pip
pin was disqualified for the same

technical regulation as McKay's
on the second day.
Players are allowed to have
someone line up their shots
before they hit. In intercolle
giate golf, if the person does not
move before the player hits, it
constitutes a penalty. Both
McKay and Pippin were penal
ized for such a violation.
While the Card won a tourna
ment at the start of the NCAA
season, the team has faltered at

its last three tournaments with
the absence of senior Andrea
Baxter, who suffered a wrist
injury in a snowboarding acci
dent.
"Two months ago we were
beating the pants off of every -
one," O'Connor said. "When we
lost Andrea, we were just trying
to adjust.
"But honestly, we're still in a
good position. We're going to be
fine."
