### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
The No. 5 Stanford men's ten
nis team showed that its talented
squad can play well even when on
the road at such tennis dynasties
as No. 1 UCLA and No. 13 USC.
Stanford breezed past USC by a
score of 5-2 but lost a tight battle to
the top-ranked Bruins 4-3.
"This was a great weekend of
tennis for us," said head coach
Dick Gould. "Only twice in my 31
years of coaching have we ever
swept down there. We had five
guys who had never played against
UCLA."
"We are very pleased all the way
from the one position down to the
six position with how they played,
said assistant coach John
Whitlinger.
Stanford started out strong
against the Bruins by capturing
the doubles point, as freshmen Bob
Bryan and Mike Bryan beat

UCLA's Kevin Kim and Eric Lin at
the No. 1 position 8-5. Stanford
juniors Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek, usually not starters
for the Cardinal, had an impressive
win at the No. 3 position, squeez
ing past the Bruins' Jason Cook
and Jason Thompsom 8-6.
"Misha and Charles stepped up
and played really well in the dou
bles with Grant and Paul out,"
Whitlinger said.
At the No. 2 position in doubles,
sophomore Ryan Wolters and
freshman Geoff Abrams, who usu
ally team up with Goldstein and
Elliott, respectively, fell to Bruins'
Eric Taino and Alex Decret 8-4.
Stanford's only easy victory of
the day came at the No. 2 position
when Bob Bryan trounced Decret
6-2,6-0. Stanford's third win came
from the No. 4 position, when
Abrams came from behind to
defeat UCLA's Vince Allegre in
three sets 2-6, 6-3, 6-1.
UCLA clinched the win in a

close match, when lOth-ranked
Taino pulled out a win against
Stanford's 19th-rankod Wolters.
With Abrams win at the four
position, Stanford tied up the
match as all eyes turned to Court
1. Wolters fought a close battle,
regaining a service break and
bringing the third set to 5-4 before
losing 6-3. 2-6, 6-4.
In other play, at the three posi
tion Kim defeated Mike Bryan 6-4,
6-4, and Breen and Cook defeated
Hoeveler and Palecek at the five
and six positions, respectively.
Although losing a tight match,
Stanford bounced back Saturday
when the Cardinal ousted the Tro
jans of USC.
"You never know how the guys
are going to react after a loss. They
came out the next day and had a
great match," Whitlinger said.
"This match could have gone
either way." Gould said. "It was a
great win."
Stanford had an impressive day
in singles, particularly at the top
position. Losing the day before in a
tight match against UCLA,
Wolters rallied to take out USC's
George Bastl 3-6, 6-3, 7-6.
In doubles, however, Stanford
was behind against the Trojans,
dropping two of the three doubles
matches and the doubles point.
The only win in doubles for the
day went to Stanford's freshman
senior duo of Abrams and Elliott,
who took out Trojans Fernando
Samayoa and Scott Willinsky 8-4.
The Bryans had success as well,
winning at the No. 2 and No. 3
spots. Bob defeated Patrick Got
tlesleben 7-5, 6-2, while Mike took
out Kyle Spencer 6-0, 3-6, 7-5.
At the four and five positions,
Abrams and Elliott took out
Johannes Mueller and Scott Will
insky, respectively.
Stanford returns to tough com
petition today when the Cardinal
takes on 15th-ranked Illinois at
home at 1:30 p.m.
