## Women's tennis takes on Cal 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
After sweeping a weekend homestand
against No. 3 UCLA and USC last weekend, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team travels
across the Bay this afternoon for a battle with
California at 1:30 p.m.
Winners of its last 10 matches, the Cardinal
(21-1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference South Divi
sion) has not lost since mid-February in the
finals of the National Team Indoors to No. 1
Florida.
The Cardinal, vying for a 10th consecutive
Pac-10 title, has now won 29 straight Pac-10
matches and is on track for its third straight
undefeated conference season.
No. 17 Cal (12-5, 2-3) and Stanford have met
once already this season, when the Cardinal
came away with an 8-1 win at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
"They are getting up there in the rankings
though," said Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan. "They beat USC and they lost to UCIJ\,
the No. 3 team in the nation, by a score of 5-4."

UCLA opponent in a match last weekend.
The Cardinal also competed
against UCLA over the weekend.
In that match, the Cardinal won
all six singles matches, five of
them in straight sets. Freshman
Lilia Osterloh did not participate
due to a shoulder injury. Osterloh
is Stanford's No. 1 singles player.
The Bears won only the No. 1
doubles match in the previous
meeting, and it was a tight 9-7
meeting even then. However,
Brennan dismissed the notion

that tomorrow's match would be a
blowout.
"That won't happen tomor
row," Brennan said. "They were
getting acclimated with each other;
they were at Stanford. It's going to
be a different story. They always
play us close up there, and I could
see this one going till 6 at night."
The Cardinal should be at full
strength for the match. Freshman
Anne Kremer, who missed last
weekend's action with strep
throat, should be back in her No. 2
singles spot this afternoon.
"Anne practiced pretty hard
yesterday," Brennan said. "Bar
ring anything unexpected, she

should be back in the lineup."

headlines the singles lineup for
Cal and teams up with freshman
Claire Curran as the No. 1 dou
bles team. The Cal roster features
only three total years of previous
collegiate experience between
three sophomores and seven
freshmen.
Stanford has been tested on the
road in the conference. The Cardi
nal was forced to open the Pac-10
season early with January meet
ings with Arizona and Arizona
State. The No. 4 Wildcats and Sun
Devils will be in town this week
end.
