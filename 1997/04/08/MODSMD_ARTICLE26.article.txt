# Bay to bay competition
## Women's tennis takes on Cal 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
After sweeping a weekend homestand
against No. 3 UCLA and USC last weekend, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team travels
across the Bay this afternoon for a battle with
California at 1:30 p.m.
Winners of its last 10 matches, the Cardinal
(21-1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference South Divi
sion) has not lost since mid-February in the
finals of the National Team Indoors to No. 1
Florida.
The Cardinal, vying for a 10th consecutive
Pac-10 title, has now won 29 straight Pac-10
matches and is on track for its third straight
undefeated conference season.
No. 17 Cal (12-5, 2-3) and Stanford have met
once already this season, when the Cardinal
came away with an 8-1 win at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
"They are getting up there in the rankings
though," said Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan. "They beat USC and they lost to UCIJ\,
the No. 3 team in the nation, by a score of 5-4."
