# Crew teams row with nation's best
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
Last weekend the Cardinal
crew teams traveled to San
Diego's Mission Bay to com
pete in the 1997 San Diego
Crew Classic. This two-day
regatta attracted more than
100 teams from around the
country, including traditional
powerhouses from the East
like Yale, Harvard and Michi
gan, and from the Pacific 10
Conference, such as Washing
ton and California.
The San Diego Crew Classic
"is the best early season race
in the collegiate world," said
novice men's head coach Josh
Burgel.
While both men's and
women's varsity crews went
into the weekend undefeated
(3-0) in dual-season competi
tion, the Cardinal oarsmen fin
ished eighth behind the Pac-10
crews of Washington, Cal and
Oregon State. The Cardinal
oarswomen finished seventh
behind league foes Washing
ton, Washington State and
Oregon State. Both Stanford
junior varsity crews showed
much improvement by making
it into the JV grand finals, fin
ishing in sixth place.
Despite the windy weather
conditions the week before the
race, which affected prepara
tions for this weekend, Stan
ford varsity men's head coach
Wieslaw Kujda "was generally
disappointed at the varsity
boat since I believe we have a
much higher potential.
"However, I understand
why [the] San Diego [regatta]
is so tough for Stanford — we
just don't have enough depth
or push to race crews who are
a level faster."
Women's head coach Aimee
Baker was disappointed with
the women varsity's perfor
mance.
"Even though we were in a
very tough first heat, we
thought we could have done
much better," Baker said.
Despite the varsity team's
disappointment, Baker was
pleased with the women's JV
performance this weekend as
the squad qualified for the
grand finals for the first time
in three years.
"1 think that all the Pac-10
crews will be very close and the

upcoming dual races against
Washington, Washington
State and Oregon State will
determine where we stand in
the top of the Pac-lOs," Baker
said.
The Stanford novice men's
and women's teams came
together for strong perfor
mances this weekend. The
men's squad finished an
impressive third place out of
19 crews while the women's
finished seventh out of 21
crews.
In the grand finals, the
novice men's boat got a late
start at the gate and trailed
the five other teams by a boat
length and a half but rallied to
catch up to the top three.
"All eight of us really
reached deep within and
pulled our hearts out," said
novice men's captain Michael
English, a freshman.
Burgel quantified the over
all goal of the team for the sea
son. "We have reached a point
where we [can] attain [a high]
level of success for our season
— winning Pac-lOs."
The novice men have a lot of
work ahead of them as they
finished behind traditional
Pac-10 leaders, Washington
and Cal.
Kujda expressed an opti
mistic outlook on the future of
the men's novice team. "The
novice team beat some good
traditional crews this week
end. The depth is coming for
them to make a good varsity
boat in the future," he said.
And that future may be
sooner than expected for some
of the novice oarsmen as
Kujda is planning to move
some of the novice oarsmen to
varsity this year, a move that
hasn't been made for a long
time in Stanford crew.
"Our team is still very
young and learning more in
each and every race," said
women's novice coach Kristine
Farson. "I am very pleased
with their turnaround to win
the petite finals."
Teams that do not qualify
for the grand finals, go on to
compete in the petite finals,
which constitute seventh
through 12th place.
Next weekend, the Cardinal
oars will hit the waters of Pull
man, Wash., against the
Huskies and host Cougars.
