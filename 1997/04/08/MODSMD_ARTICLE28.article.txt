# Equestrian qualifies 10 for regionals
## 
### Erin Reilly Staff writer 
The Cardinal equestrian team
ended its regular season with a
successful showdown at the UC-
Davis corral. Ten of Stanford's
top riders, on both the English
and Western teams, qualified for
Western Regionals to be held at
the Stanford Red Barn this
weekend.
Senior and English team presi
dent Amanda Hoche leads the
region for the prestigious Cac
chione Cup as the high-point hunt
seat rider. Hoche qualified in the
open fences and open flat classes
as well, with a fourth- and fifth
place win, respectively.
Head coach and regional presi
dent Barbara Close said Hoche
has the mental experience to take
a top slot in the hotly contested
Cacchione competition ' <;tween
the premier riders from each
region, but because Hoche's com
petitive background is in hunters,
rather than equitation, "she'll
really have to work for it."
Close has great expectations for
all the qualified members. "They
have all been competitive, and
they can all hold up well if they
qualify for nationals," she said.
Other highlights from the
weekend included junior Ann
Carney's stellar performance,
which earned her a regional berth
in novice flat.
"It was one of my best rides, if
not the best ride yet," Carney said.
Carney, sophomore Vanessa
Bartsch and senior Kathleen
Gilbert were among the nine
called back as qualifiers in the
novice division. It is the first time
that Stanford has had all the rid
ers in one division ranked.
Carney said she looks forward
to the weekend competition and
will ride every day, plus lessons, to
prepare for regionals.
"I just need to keep my act
together, be aggressive and then
draw a good horse," Carney said.
Junior Mandy Gillett qualified
in the intermediate division and

said she is excited for the events.
"Davis was the first time for me to
compete in the open division, and
I didn't put much pressure on
myself. I just wanted to do the
best I could."
Gillett said the greatest differ
ence between the intermediate
and open divisions is demand for
precision. "It is one notch higher
than before so what you can get
away with at lower levels you
can't at this one."
The other English riders who
qualified are junior Karen Hoff
man, Gilbert, sophomore London
Davies, sophomore Zaz Harris
and Bartsch.
The Cardinal Western team
finished reserve high point beat
ing out Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and Kings River College. Fresno
State placed first.
Stanford also qualified three
Western riders for regionals.
Head coach Karine Bodouin

believes the trio of Bartsch, senior
Whitney Schott and sophomore
Mark Gundersen will achieve
national ranks.
"These three are the returning
team riders, and we have a great
chance at qualifying for zones as
well as nationals this weekend,"
Bodouin said.
Schott was reserve national
champion in walk /jog two years
ago. With her impressive return
after nine months off and two
quarters in Argentina, Schott is
determined to prevail. "She had
only one lesson and pointed out of
walk-jog. She has a great chance
in the intermediate division,"
Bodouin said.
Gundersen has big tracks to fill
as the Cardinal walk / jog rider
has won the regional title for the
last consecutive two years. After
placing first and second at Davis,
however, Gundersen has a solid
chance at the title.

"Winning feels good and I feej
confident, but still I am nervous,"
Gundersen said.
Gundersen plans to work on
reining patterns and stock seat
equitation in order to prepare for
the weekend challenge but said
the Western team as a whole is
ready for action.
"We are two points from sec
ond place in region," he said.
"For a young team that is really
good."
The Western team is graduat
ing one senior, Schott, and the
remainder will be returning next
year. Bodouin said she is eager for
next season as all the riders will
be more experienced and focused
on success.
Western competition starts
Saturday at 3 p.m. Sunday's
English competition will be held
at Spring Down Equestrian Cen
ter in Woodside. The time has not
yet been announced.
