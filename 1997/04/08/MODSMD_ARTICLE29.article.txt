# Baseball goes to Santa Clara for midweek game
## 
### 
With a four-game winning streak and a
striking four-game advantage at the halfway
point of Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division play, Stanford (26-8) will play its
first nonconference game tonight since a
five-hour affair with San Francisco State in
early March .
The 7 p.m. matchup under the lights at
Santa Clara closes out the schools' four
game series this year and a seven-game road
stint for Stanford. The first of five consecu
tive Tuesday-night tilts for Stanford comes
on the heels of an impressive three-game

sweep over USC in Los Angeles.
The Broncos played three riveting games
with Stanford in February. Stanford took
two of three from the Broncos, who play in
the West Coast Conference. On Feb. 15,
Stanford won 9-8 at home behind a two-out
home run in the ninth inning by senior left
fielder Chris Clark, but the Broncos
answered at Buck Shaw Stadium with a 6-5,
10-inning victory the next day. The Cardinal
won the finale 8-6 on a two-run home run by
freshman right fielder Edmund Muth in the
eighth inning.

With the weekend rotation set, a host of
candidates will vie for the starting spot on
the mound for the Cardinal, including fresh
men Brian Fearnow and Geoff Linville,
junior Adam Harris and Cameron Newton.
All have seen limited duty this year, primar
ily in single nonconference games.
Stanford returns for its first series at
Sunken Diamond in a month Friday when
fifth-place Arizona State comes to California
for a three-game series that begins an eight
game homestand.
