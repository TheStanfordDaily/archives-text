# Minimum wage above average at Stanford
## Compensation set higher than at most schools so students can concentrate on studies 
### Elizabeth Pianca 
Students employed by Stanford University benefit
from some of the highest wages among colleges and
universities in the nation.
Of the eight schools surveyed, Stanford's mini
mum wage came out on top at $7.97 per hour. The na
tional minimum wage, currently $4.75 per hour, will
increase to $5.15 on Sept. 1.
University figures show that student wages range
from $7.97 to $11.35 per hour.
"The wage scale for student employees has been an
historical thing for students at Stanford," said Mary

Mon.-ison, senior associate director of financial aid.
"Historically, the University did not want students to
work more than a certain number of hours per week."
Wl iy higher here?
Compared to other colleges, both nationally and lo
cally, student wages are higher for the same types of
work.
The campus minimum wage of $7.97 was the high
est of any of the eight schools The Daily examined.
Morrison, however, said the campus minimum wage
is only a suggestion.
"They can pay

whatever they want," she said.
Morrison added that the driving reason for the
wages is the belief that students should not have
to work an excessive number of hours to finance their
education.
When students receive their financial aid pack
ages, they are given a suggested amount of money to
earn during the school year.
"We do tell students how much they should earn,
but we do not tell students how many hours they need
to work," Morrison said
