# Minimum wage above average at Stanford
## Compensation set higher than at most schools so students can concentrate on studies 
### Elizabeth Pianca 
Students employed by Stanford University benefit
from some of the highest wages among colleges and
universities in the nation.
Of the eight schools surveyed, Stanford's mini
mum wage came out on top at $7.97 per hour. The na
tional minimum wage, currently $4.75 per hour, will
increase to $5.15 on Sept. 1.
University figures show that student wages range
from $7.97 to $11.35 per hour.
"The wage scale for student employees has been an
historical thing for students at Stanford," said Mary

Mon.-ison, senior associate director of financial aid.
"Historically, the University did not want students to
work more than a certain number of hours per week."
Wl iy higher here?
Compared to other colleges, both nationally and lo
cally, student wages are higher for the same types of
work.
The campus minimum wage of $7.97 was the high
est of any of the eight schools The Daily examined.
Morrison, however, said the campus minimum wage
is only a suggestion.
"They can pay

whatever they want," she said.
Morrison added that the driving reason for the
wages is the belief that students should not have
to work an excessive number of hours to finance their
education.
When students receive their financial aid pack
ages, they are given a suggested amount of money to
earn during the school year.
"We do tell students how much they should earn,
but we do not tell students how many hours they need
to work," Morrison said
The Financial Aids Office does
not offer any guidelines on where
students can work. However, on
campus jobs provide greater flexi
bility for students' schedules as well
as higher wages.
About 250 Stanford undergrad
uates qualify for the Federal Work
Study program, Morrison said, in
which 75 percent of the student's
wage is subsidized by the federal
government and 25 percent is sub
sidized by the University.
A larger number of students re
ceive work-study suggestions with
their financial aid package (often
called departmentally funded job el
igibility). These students receive no
funds from the Financial Aids Of
fice.
Morrison said students who ei
ther qualify for Federal Work Study
or work-study as part of their finan
cial aid packages are supposed to
have first priority for University
jobs; however, according to Morri
son "there is no job police which en
forces this system."
She also said students' wages are
high because students are extreme
ly busy and paying a large amount
of money to go to school here.
"I don't know what would hap
pen if you let the wage float," she
said. "If the wages went lower, the
students would probably say that it's
not worth the time to have a job."
One common criticism of the

high student's wages is that they
are passed on to students through
high board bills and other costs. But
Morrison said students make up a
fairly small part of the Stanford
work force.
Housing and Dining Services
has about 150 student employees,
while as many as 400 people are em
ployed from off campus.
Pay scales
Raises for University jobs are
based on the number of quarters a
student has worked. For example, a
student working in food service will
have a starting wage between $7.97
and $8.50 per hour. After comple
tion of three quarters of part-time
work or one quarter of full-time
work, the student will receive a
raise to up to $8.78 per hour.
But wages for non-student em
ployees completing similar tasks
are significantly lower: The starting
wage at Dining Services is $5.70 per
hour.
"We are obligated to pay Stan
ford students at a different rate,"
said Melanie Jones-Carter, opera
tions manager for Dining Services.
"This is dictated from the Universi
ty."
Morrison said the need for stu
dent employees to fill certain types
of jobs in academic departments, li
brary services and food services cre
ates a "market economy" where
employers must compete for stu
dents labor.
Non-University jobs
Off-campus wages are signifi

cantly lower. At Stanford Ice Cream
and Yogurt and Peet's Coffee and
Tea, both located in Town & Coun
try Village, the starting wages are
$5 and $6.50 per hour, respectively.
At Kepler's, a bookstore in Menlo
Park, the starting wage is $6.29 per
hour.
Students do have the option of
working on-campus in non-Univer
sity jobs. At the Stanford Book
store, the wage for a cashier ranges
from $5.36 to $8.31 per hour. Stu
dents working at the Bookstore re
ceive a 50-percent discount on all
textbooks purchased. About 80 of
the 300 employees at the Bookstore
are students, said Human Re
sources Director Rick Sherwood.
Bon Appetit — the company that
supervises some eateries in Tresid
der Union and elsewhere on cam
pus — starts student wages at $6.75
per hour, said Richard Calbow, di
rector of retail operations.
"When our meal policy is thrown
in," Calbow said, "we match many
University jobs because it is a fun
place to work and we are flexible
and try to work around a student's
busy schedule."
Although the University's mini
mum wage may be significantly
higher than other universities and
colleges nationwide, it is competi
tive with the standard of living for
the Palo Alto area, Morrison said.
Other universities
At Santa Clara University, stu
dent employees are paid anywhere
from the federal minimum wage of
$4.75 per hour to $14 per hour for

university jobs, according to the
school's payroll office. The average
wage for students at Santa Clara is
between $6.50 and $8 per hour.
Across the Bay at UC-Berkeley,
the lowest wage paid for undergrad
uate student work is $6.34. But ac
cording to Richard Black, director
of financial aid, the typical wage is
about $10.12 per hour.
At Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, lo
cated in a rural community three
hours south of Stanford, under
graduate students are paid $4.75 to
$12 per hour depending on the type
of job and skill level required, said
Joan Lund, manager of staff devel
opment and training.
"Students want to stay on cam
pus and work because off-campus
employment opportunities pay sig
nificantly lower wages and do not
allow for as much flexibility as on
campus employment," she said.
Nationally, university wages for
student employees vary depending
on the location of the campus. At
Duke University, student wages
range from $4.50 (25 cents above
the state minimum) to $7 per hour.
"Approximately 93 percent of
Duke's students live on campus,"
said John Belvin, director of finan
cial aid. "Most students do not
want to travel off campus to work
at a job which does not allow for as
much flexibility for a students'
schedule."
Similarly, at Amherst College,
students are paid between $5.25
and $7.75 per hour, and at New
York University students are paid
anywhere from $5 to $ 15 per hour.
