# Wages and educational experience draw hashers to Stanford's kitchens
## 
### Vanessa Hua Editorial staff 
With a sweep of her long,
wavy brown hair, Patty
Vazquez looks like any
other Stanford student.
With her welcoming smile,
she makes her way around,
behind the counter, at the
cashier or at the hot line.

But unlike other Stanford hashers,
Vazquez arrives at 4 p.m. and often will not
leave until after 8. Unlike most other hash
ers, she works half-time while attending
school.
Vazquez, 24, of Redwood City, is the
head hasher of Manzanita Dining Com

mons. Each day, more than 400 people
herd through the airy glass doors into the
dining hall. Throughout, Vazquez ensures
the smooth running of the operation. She
eats afterward, after helping with and su
pervising the clean-up.
Recently, Vazquez began a second job at
Noah's Bagels, the: popular eatery in down
town Palo Alto "With two jobs, I don't
have much time (or myself," she said.
Four years ago, when Vazquez first
started working on campus, she also took
cosmetology classes full time at the College
of San Mateo and worked at Stanford in
the evening, 20 hours a week.
"I went to school in the morning. It was


Katie Stokes — Daily

a lot hands-on stuff, not much
homework. And then I work in the
evenings," Vazquez said.
Part of what keeps Vazquez
coming back are her co-workers,
students and staff.
"I get to know so many students
personally," Vazquez said. "People
here are really friendly, not rude.
They come in when they're not
working to say 'hi.' "
However, institutional
turnover is particularly high
among students, who may stop
working in the dining room due to
scheduling or change of residence,
Vazquez said.
In contrast, Vazquez has been
constant to Dining Services,
working half time during the
school year and full time during
the summer for the past four
years.
People often mistake Vazquez
for just another Stanford student.
"They're surprised when they
find out I'm not," Vazquez said.
"They've seen me here such a long
time, they assume I am."
Vazquez began working in the
dishroom and worked her way up

the ranks, from hasher to head
hasher.
"At first, my cousin needed help
for a few days, and I ended up stay
ing here for the next few years,"
she said.
Two years ago, Vazquez be
came a student manager at Man
zanita. Her responsibilities in
clude managing other hashers and
locking up and setting up for the
next day.
Off-campus and Stanford stu
dents alike "with demonstrated
performance in a job can get pro
moted," Asst. Dining Services
Manager Shirley Everett said.
"The student supervisors are out
standing individuals, who have
been working here loyally."
Other benefits stem from the
working with Dining Services.
"I get to work as a team,"
Vazquez said. "There's more
chance here to take charge."
She learned a lot by watching
others, Vazquez said. "It helps me
be more open to people. I'm shy,
but talking to students makes me
more comfortable. I can joke
around."
The management styles of the
two Manzanita head hashers com
plement each other, said junior
Frank Tsai, a product design
major. Tsai is Vazquez's counter

part, the other student head hash
er at Manzanita. Vazquez is in
charge of paperwork, while Tsai
takes care of disciplinary action of
hashers.
"She's good-cop; I'm bad-cop,"
Tsai said. "We have different ways
of talking to people."
However, both hashers empha
sized the easy going nature of their
job and their co-workers. Tsai said
he believed the management fos
tered the positive work atmos
phere at Manzanita.
Vazquez said, "Other off-cam
pus jobs have strict rules, such as
not being able to talk to co-work
ers. It's a different atmosphere
here, on campus. As long you get
everything done, you can talk to
your friends."
Management encourages cama
raderie, according to Rafi Taher
ian, the Manzanita Dining Ser
vices manager. "We try to be sup
portive," Taherian said. "We try to
make workers happy, so we can
make the student happy."
However, Tsai expressed his
concern over the wage inequality
between Stanford student and
non-Stanford hashers.
"I feel for them. Some Stanford
students get paid for doing noth
ing," Tsai said. "The off-campus
hashers work harder and get paid

less. But there's nothing they can
do."
About 30 hashers are employed
through temporary agencies, ac
cording to Dining Services Opera
tions Manager Melanie Jones-
Carter. "They are used to supple
ment the full time and student staff.
She added that some Dining Ser
vices workers, such as cooks, bakers
and potwashers, are unionized.
Everett said the Stanford stu
dent hasher wages are set at $7.97.
"It's set by the University for fi
nancial aid reason," she said.
In comparison, off-campus
hashers start at $5.60. However,
this hourly amount is higher than
minimum wage.
"We're not here to make
money. We're service-oriented,"
Taherian said. "It's a friendly en
vironment."
Vazquez enjoys providing that
service. She plans on working here
in the future after obtaining her
degree. Although Vazquez has al
ready earned her cosmetology li
cense, she needs to complete a few
more classes to receive her associ
ate degree.
"I want my degree," Vazquez
said. "I'll go into that field, but I
also want to stay here. I began
working here, at Manzanita, and I
want to stay here."
