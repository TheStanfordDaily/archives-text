## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Business Prof. Alain Enthoven , has been appoint
ed by California Governor Pete Wilson to lead the
Managed Health ('are Improvement Task Force.
"I am looking forward to giving this important
issue the thorough review it deserves," Enthoven
said in a press release.
The task force is a .'{() person bipartisan commis
sion that "will advise me and the legislature on how
to update California's governance of the managed
care industry to preserve its best features with the
fewest sido-effect.-s ( " Wilson said in a press release.
"Managed care has lowered costs and made health
care affordable for thousands of Californians," Wil
son said.
"Hut critics charge that this has come at the ex
pense of quality, medical research and access to
needed procedures," he added. "It is time to examine
the actual costs and benefits of managed aire to Cal
ifornia enrollees, their employers and their health
care providers â€” based on careful review of the
data."
The purpose of the task force is to research and re
port on the current picture of California's health care
service plans, specifically focusing on the different
types of plans available and how they are structured
and regulated.
The task force will also look at the effect of the
trends and changes in health care delivery on the
health care economy and academic medical centers.
The report is due Jan. 1, 1998.
The commission will also determine whether the
goals of managed care, including controlling costs
and improving quality and access
to care, are being satisfied. A com
parison of the effects of provider fi
nancial incentives on the delivery
of health care will be conducted.
Finally, the task force will estab
lish the effect of managed care on
the patent-physician relationship
and on academic medical centers.
Often referred to as the "father of
managed competition," Enthoven
and a colleague introduced the con
cept of the "consumer-choice health
plan" in an article published in the
New England Journal of Medicine
in 1978. Enthoven has devoted
more than two decades to the study
of health care management and has
actively pursued market-based
health care reform.
Enthoven's most recent re
search on managed care exam
ined the domination of Califor
nia's managed care by for-profit
health care maintenance organi
zations, which Enthoven labeled

"carrier HMOs."
These HMOs contract with
multispecialty group practices and
individual practice associations
using various risk-sharing
arrangements. Each HMO mar
kets a variety of delivery systems.
The competition among the exist
ing mix of HMOs has been driving
down the costs of health care in
California.
"The appointment of Prof. En
thoven to the governor's task
force signals that concerns about
managed care will get a thorough
and objective review, not just a bit
of hand waving," said Enthoven's
special assistant, Sara Singer.
Enthoven's work has earned
him national recognition; he was
awarded the Baxter Prize for
Health Services Research and the
Clifton Latiolais Honor Medal in
1994.
A Stanford graduate, Enthoven
helped benefits managers negoti
ate favorable health care premi
ums for Stanford, the California
Public Employees Retirement
System and the Pacific Business
Group on Health.
