## Students try to solve world problems at Model UN conference in Hungary 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Stanford's Model United Na
tions group on Sunday returned
from a weeklong, worldwide
conference in Hungary coordi
nated by Harvard University
and Budapest University.
Freshman Parikshit Kundu,
sophomore Sun Young Park, ju
niors Sera Linardi and Rafael
Nendel-Flores and doctoral stu
dents Mehul Patel and Mehul
Bastawala were among the
Stanford delegates. It was Nen
del-Flores' first trip out of the
United States.
Stanford students represent
ed Turkey on committees deal
ing with Middle East peace, dis
armament, the European Union
and humanitarian issues such
as child prostitution and female
infanticide.
Stanford representatives as
serted in the disarmament com
mittee that land mines were
necessary in Turkey to deter
guerrilla groups. In addition,
the group debated nuclear pro
liferation.
The European Union dis
cussed potential new member
states and the question of
whether to hold a standing
army. Turkey was among the
nations considered for member
status, but despite Stanford del
egates' argument that Turkey
was economically ready and re
spected human rights, it was de
nied the status.
Nendel-Flores said the Euro
peans took a more easy-going

approach to debate than the
Americans.
Although English was not
the conference's official lan
guage, most delegates were Eng
lish-proficient and spoke it unof
ficially. Park said one delegate,
aided by a translator, addressed
the conference in Mandarin Chi
nese.
Stanford students stayed at
the four-star Hotel Buda Mer
cure. Committee sessions took
place each day between 9 a.m.
and noon. Lunch breaks, Park
said, were informal and gave her
the opportunity to meet col
leagues from Taiwan and Japan.
"I learned a lot from the com
mittee experience, but it was
learning in a very limited
sense," Park said. "I think what
came closer to heart was the
human contact." An evening
discussion of religion and philos
ophy with two Kenyans and a
German at a local pub provided a
memorable social experience for
Park and Linardi.
On an organized trip to a
farm outside of Budapest, the
delegates enjoyed a horse show,
a bonfire, Gypsy dancing and
Hungarian food and wine.
"Everybody was there," says
Nendel-Flores. "We were all
having a good time."
U.S. Ambassador to Hungary
Donald Blinken gave the
keynote speech at the opening
ceremony of the conference.
Also on hand to speak was Bu
dapest Mayor Gabor Demszky.
At the closing ceremony, awards
were given out.
