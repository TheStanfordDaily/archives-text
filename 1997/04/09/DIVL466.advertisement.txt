DOING 1T...
Renee Pavelski has been pounding the pavement for most of her life.
The Senior Human Biology major began running seriously in the seventh
grade. Thanks to the influence and support of her biggest role models—her
Dad, a former three-season varsity college athlete, and her younger brother,
a college basketball standout—Pavelski kept running and improving
through high school. Eventually she earned an invi
tation to compete for the Stanford Track Team in
the heptathlon, which includes the high jump, long
jump, shot put, javelin, the 800-meter run, 200-
meter dash, and 100-meter hurdles.
Worried that college was taking a back seat to
running, Pavelski cut short her track career to con
centrate on other interests. She now works for
Sportsßridge, a non-profit organization whose mis
sion is to empower girls and women through sports.
Pavelski also works for the Center on Adolescence
on projects focused on stress, eating disorders, and
crime in teenage girls. In addition, she has worked
as a peer counselor at the Bridge. Pavelski's long
term goal is to earn her Ph. Din Clinical Psychology.
Even with all these activities in her life, Pavelski
has not let her love of running fade. Right now, she's training for the Big Sur
Marathon later this month. Though she says her main goal is just to have
fun, don't be surprised if this star athlete finishes at the top of the pack.
