# Senate takes no action
## New charter still on hold 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
It remains unclear whether the
proposed new judicial charter will ap
pear on the ballot for next week's
ASSU general election. At last night's
meeting, the ASSU Senate took no ac
tion on the issue.
Voting in the election begins next
Wednesday. A special meeting of the
senate any time before then could
place the charter on the ballot.

The Committee of 15 has been reviewing the char
ter, and came out with the final version of its proposal
last month. Since then, an ad hoc committee chaired by
ASSU Senator Michael Colon has raised three major
questions about the reforms.
The first issue, as identified by ASSU Senator Doug
Natelson at last night's meeting, was whether students
tried before the new judicial panels would have the
right to open hearings in all circumstances.
Natelson said the ASSU Constitution guaranteed
that right but that under certain circumstances, such
as sexual assault or harassment cases, witnesses might
not wish to testify or be cross-examined in public.
The second issue is that the judicial charter pro
hibits any third party from representing or speaking
for a defendant at a hearing.
While Natelson, Colon and the Committee of 15's
chair, Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback, agreed that hear
ings should not be allowed to turn into "legal contests,"
Natelson said there were certain circumstances, for exam
ple if a defendant was not fluent in English, where it would
be unfair to deny a defendant some form of assistance.
The third point related to whether the defendant
would have a right to cross-examine all witnesses called
against him, or whether, for example, expert witnesses
might be allowed to testify in writing.
The ad hoc committee will hold an open meeting
today at 5 p.m. at the senate's offices. Zoback said he
