## Prop. 209 ban is overturned Judge rules in favor of Calif, anti-affirmative action plan 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court
upheld California's voter-approved ban on affirmative
action yesterday, saying the state can dismantle pro
grams that favor women and minorities in hiring and
education.
In a 3-0 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals overturned a judge's order that had blocked
enforcement of Proposition 209 not long after it was
approved in November.
Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, writing for the
appeals court, said the U.S. Constitution "barely per
mits" preferential programs.
The affirmative action programs affected by Propo
sition 209 "work wholly to the benefit of certain mem
bers of one group and correspondingly to the harm of
certain members of another group," he wrote.
The ruling is scheduled to take effect in 21 days.
Supporters of affirmative action said they will ask for
a rehearing by 11 members of the 9th Circuit and
press it to continue the ban on enforcement in the
meantime.
The ruling foreshadows "a resegregation of soci
ety," warned Eva Paterson, executive director of the
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco,
among groups opposing the measure.
Supporters of Proposition 209 were jubilant.
The ruling "sends a strong, clear signal that the
people of California were right when they stated that
there should be no discrimination," said Sean Walsh,
spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican.
The initiative, passed by 54 percent of the voters,
would prohibit racial or gender preferences instate
hiring, awarding of contracts and college admission.
University of California Regents voted separately to
eliminate affirmative action programs effective with
1998 admissions.
Last fall, U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson
blocked enforcement of the measure, ruling it would
unfairly abolish programs that benefit minorities and
women while leaving others intact, including those for
veterans.
President Clinton, who opposed Proposition 209
during the campaign and in court, said yesterday that
"we'll all have to regroup and find new ways to achieve
the same objective" if the measure is upheld.
"I believe if states are precluded from trying to take
appropriate steps that are not quotas and that do not
give unqualified people a chance to participate in
whatever it is — economic or educational life — but do
recognize the disadvantages people have experienced,
I think that will be a mistake," he said.
"Unlike racial preference programs, school desegre
gation programs ... do not work wholly to the benefit
of certain members of one group and correspondingly
to the harm of certain members of another group, and
do not deprive citizens of rights," O'Scannlain said.
