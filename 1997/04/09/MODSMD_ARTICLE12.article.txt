Rights to abortion pill change hands
PARIS (AP) — Threatened by boycotts from American anti-abor
tion groups, the European pharmaceutical giant Hoechst unloaded
its remaining rights to the abortion pill RU-486 yesterday.
The company gave the rights to one of the drug's creators, Dr.
Edouard Sakiz, who plans to form a smaller company that will be
less vulnerable to consumer pressure.
The move was a further attempt by the French drug company
Roussel-Uclaf — a Hoechst subsidiary — to distance itself from the
controversial drug. Just two years ago, in the face of boycotts, it
ceded U.S. rights to RU-486 to The Populat ion Council, a New York
based nonprofit group.
The $3.5 million in annual sales of RU-486 — also known as
mifepristone — was not worth risking Hoechst's $1.63 billion in
U.S. business, Hoechst spokeswoman Catherine Euvrard said.
"Roussel-Uclaf no longer has the means to be able to withstand
the boycott threats" from American anti-abortion groups, she told
reporters in Paris. "This product can no longer be part of the strat
egy of an international company."
"In the United States, they're on the verge of a civil war" over
abortion, Sakiz said.
Last week the Washington-baaed National Right to Life Commit
tee, an American anti-abortion group, threatened to boycott Allegra,
a Hoechst antihistamine, Euvrard said. Hoechst and Sakiz already
had decided to make the transfer, she said.
About 200,000 women have ended pregnancies with the RU-486
since it debuted on the French market in 1988, and it is also sold in
Sweden and Britain. In the United States, RU-486 is expected to
received full approval and begin distribution by the year's end.
Alexander Sanger of Planned Parenthood said he hoped the
transfer of Hoechst's rights to the drug would make RU-486 more
available worldwide.
Air force jet disappears
PI lOENIX (AP) — Capt. Craig Button took off in a $9 million Air
Force attack jet last week for a practice run. Within minutes the
plane and its arsenal of four 500-pound bombs were gone.
All that's known for sure is that the A-10 Thunderbolt was last
spotted on radar over the Colorado Rockies — nearly 800 miles off
course.
Did it crash?
Was it sabotaged?
Or did the pilot steal it, like something out of the movie "Broken
Arrow"?
"Anythingyou can think of has probably been looked at," said Staff
Sgt. Rian Clawson at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. "But
the evidence so far doesn't indicate any of these wild hypotheses, like
he was trying to steal it, or he went ofT to Telluride to go skiing."
The Air Force rebuffs the idea that Button purposely veered the
plane off course. But officials acknowledged yesterday that investi
gators are looking into Button's background.
"The investigation ... includes all aspects of the plane and pilot,
anything to do with the situation," said Staff Sgt. Bret Zieman at
Davis-Monthan.
The mystery began last Wednesday morning about 90 minutes
afler Button's plane took off in formation with two other A-10s
bound for the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range. It was carrying
conventional, not nuclear, weapons.
One of the jets reported seeing Button's plane flying in the rear,
but a minute later the lead pilot radioed Button and got no response.
When the other pilots realized the plane was missing, they broke for
mation and began the search.
The jet itself didn't have its tracking device turned on because it
was flying in formation, said Maj. Joe spokesman for Lan
gley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va.
