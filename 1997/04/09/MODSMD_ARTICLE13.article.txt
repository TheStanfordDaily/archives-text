# Shooting of Palestinian youth incites riots
## More lives claimed as worst violence in months overtakes Hebron 
### 
HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - Jew
ish seminary students shot and killed
a Palestinian yesterday, sparking
fierce riots in which Israeli troops
killed two Palestinians and injured
dozens. It was the West Bank's worst
violence in months.
The rioting in Hebron raged for
more than five hours, with hundreds
of protesters hurling stones and fire
bombs at the Israelis, who fired back
tear gas and rubber bullets.
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu called for Israeli
security forces and Palestinian police
to cooperate in restoring calm and
warned that one more major terrorist
attack could scuttle the peace process.
Palestinian police tried to prevent
the protests from spilling over from
the Palestinian-controlled part of the

city into the enclave still held by
Israel, where the shooting occurred
only to be pelted with stones by their
own people.
Reports about the shooting in
Hebron which led to the riots were
conflicting.
Palestinians said the attack was
unprovoked, while Israelis insisted it
was brought on by Palestinians who
sprayed two Jewish seminary stu
dents with tear gas as they walked to
the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Both stu
dents had tear gas burns, police
spokesperson Linda Menuchin said.
The students opened fire with Uzi
submachine guns, Hebron police com
mander Benny Baharon said. One
shot hit Assam Rash id Arafeh, 23, in
the chest, killing him, Palestinian
police and hospital workers said.

Israel Radio reported that a police
investigation found the students
identified as Tomer I)eel and Zeev
Mok — had acted in self-defense.
Police still were investigating whether
they shot with the intent to kill.
Palestinians angered over the
shooting lobbed gasoline bombs and
rocks, injuring at least five Israeli sol
diers and several Palestinian police
men.
In retaliation, Israeli troops fired
tear gas and rubber bullets, wounding
about 100 Palestinians. Seven of them
remained hospitalized Tuesday night.
Palestinian Yacoub Julani, 10, died
in surgery with the metal kernel of a
rubber bullet lodged in his brain.
Later, 3,000 people attended his
funeral, some crying out "Rebel!" and
"Cod is great."

Although yesterday's fighting was
the bloodiest, Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers have battled in the streets of
the West Hank almost daily since
Israel broke ground March IH for the
Har 1 loma housing project in east
.Jerusalem, the sector Palestinians
want as their capital.
The violence in Hebron where
500 Jewish settlers live l in uneasy
coexistence with 130,000 Palestinians
- came an 1 Arab dismay over the
failure of Monday's summit l>etween
President Clinton and Netanyahu to
break t he deadlock.
The Israeli leader, however, insist
ed that "interesting ideas" on how to
restart talks had come out of the
Washington summit. Further
progress, he said, depended on the
prevention of further violence.
In Washington, Clinton urged both
sides to prevent the violence from
stopping progress toward peace.
"We've just. got. to keep going," he said
yesterday.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
speaking to a pro-Israel lobby, blamed
the crisis on Arafat, saying the Pales
tinian leader was an active accomplice
in a campaign of "terror and coordi
nated propaganda" that was aimed at
defeating Israel
Netanyahu accuses Arafat of
orchestrating the riots and authoriz
ing militant attacks, including a sui
cide bombing in Tel Aviv last month
that killed three Israeli women.
Arafat spokesman Marwan
Kanalani accused Netanyahu of hav
ing "blond on his hands" after yester
day's shootings. Arafat himself,
speaking before the shooting, said
Netanyahu's refusal to suspend set
tlement building means "he does not
want peace."
More than 700 people marched in
Arafeh's funeral procession yesterday
night. The body, wrapped in a Pales
tinian Hag, was carried to t he grave by
uniformed Palestinian police, who
fired a 21-gun salute. The mourners
waved Palestinian flags and banners,
and shouted down Palestinian Trans
portation Minister Ali Qawasmeh
when he tried to speak.
They yelled: "Let the olive branch
fall — and the gun rise!"

Relatives and friends carry the casket, draped with the Palestinian flag, containing the body of 24-year-old Pales
tinian Asem Arafeh, who was shot and killed yesterday by a Jewish settler in the Israeli portion of Hebron. Riots
broke out after the incident, and two other Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops.
