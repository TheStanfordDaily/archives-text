Only apathy prevents
students from shaping
effective government

Apathy, more than any
other word, best describes
Stanford students' relation
ship with campus politics. This is
an unfortunate circumstance, one
that ought to change. A week from
today, as ASSU election polls open
over the World Wide Web, there
are several reasons for why both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents need to vote.
Next week's election is not only
about who gets to spend $10,000
next year as ASSU president or
who gets to bargain with the Facul
ty Senate and members of the Com
mittee of 15 over legalistic minuti
ae. Rather, it will be about the
direction that the ASSU, as organi
zation working in the name of the
students collectively, takes, and it
will determine which student orga
nizations will be able to receive the
student fees they've requested.
While it might seem that simple
civic duty should compel voters to
cast their ballots in a computer
cluster, many students obviously
feel otherwise. Perhaps finding the
time to expend that effort is just
too inconvenient to fit into a busy
student's schedule. Perhaps they
believe that what their ASSU sena
tors do — much less who those sen
ators are — makes little difference
to the individual student. This is
not to say that the presidential and
senate races are not important in
and of themselves but rather that
students do not view them as being
important enough to justify their
time and effort.
But there's a reason students
don't like their student govern
ment; it's because they see it as inef
fectual, out of touch and consumed
with its own, internal pet issues. In
an election with three viable presi
dential tickets — each with varying

degrees of experience and very dif
ferent plans — and with nearly 40
candidates running for 15 under
graduate senate seats, students can
have a real voice in the direction of
their student government.
Furthermore, all students,
whether they vote or not, love to
complain that the administration
does not listen to their views. The
avenue through which administra
tors can most readily elicit student
input and heed student concerns is
through the students' elected rep
resentatives. But it is unlikely, in
fact unreasonable, to expect that
any administration figures will
likely give much credence to stu
dent viewpoints they perceive to be
illegitimate. And certainly an
ASSU president who receives the
votes from only 6 percent of the
student body, as did the current
president, cannot be viewed as not
wholly legitimate.
There's also the one longstand
ing reason that students vote do so:
special fees. Almost all major stu
dent groups on campus are funded
through annual referenda in which
students vote a group's budget up
or down. Those groups who win
their special fee charge each under
graduate or graduate student or
both (depending on the community
to which the group applies) a quar
terly charge — some groups charges
will top $10 for the year, if
approved. While this year's fee
amounts have been lower than in
the recent past, if all groups'
requests are passed in the upcom
ing elections, undergraduate fees
will reach $116 for the 1997-1998
school year; graduate fees will be a
more manageable $38.
In short, there are many reasons
for students to vote in next week's
election. It's unfortunate that a
culture of apathy now seems to
exists at a university historically
known for its political activism, and
perhaps that perception is
unfounded. In seven days, students
will have a chance to express their
views on campus politics at the vot
ing booth (or voting computer clus
ter, as the case may be). Use it.
