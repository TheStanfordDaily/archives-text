Middle East conflict isn't just a one-sided issue

AS ONE GROWS older, one learns
to anticipate certain things. The
blossoming of flowers in the
spring, the first signs of autumn. After
several years at Stanford, we learned to
foresee one additional thing. Whenever
something really bad happens in the
Middle East, Rebecca Stein and other
members of her lot send letters to The
Daily placing responsibility on Israel for
everything from low Palestinian income
levels to Yasser Arafat's unholy conduct,
only stopping short of proclaiming Israel
responsible for global warming.
During our time here, we have, at
times, written letters refuting some of the
slanted allegations made by members of
Middle East Focus and Stein. Frankly,
this time we planned on letting her letter
pass us by. "She did improve," we told
each other. "Some of the things she said
did have a faded link to reality, and she
did say something about not supporting
terrorism." Nonetheless, we were pleased
to see the responses from Jim Finsten and
Marvin Sommer to Stein's first letter and
noted that we were not alone in our strug
gle. It is reassuring to know that if Stein
lingers with her doctoral studies, others
might watch over this self-appointed

avatar of justice after we graduate.
However, after Stein's latest letter,
printed Monday, we feel compelled to
remind her, once again, that every compli
cated issue has at least two facets. Take
the closures imposed on the West Bank
after terrorist attacks are carried out in
Israel. Nobody would say that the closures
do not hurt Palestinians who cannot come
to work in Israel or deny that poverty and
hardship foster extremism, but one hardly
needs to be an Israeli military analyst to
make this keen observation.
Yet Stein neglects to mention that
such closures are only imposed after ter
rorist attacks. The closures are not a
retaliatory measure: Every Palestinian
who cannot go to work in Israel is a
worker who does not show up in the
Israeli workforce; both sides lose. Clo
sures are imposed because they are the
only preventive measure Israel can take
to protect its citizens from Palestinian
terrorism. The United Nations, which
Stein cites in defense of her criticism of
the closures, has historically been preju
diced against Israel, often steered by a
large coalition of Arab countries and is
second only to Stein and her group in its
resentment of Israel. Recent polls show

that more than 50 percent of Palestini
ans support suicide terrorist acts in
Israel, which led us to contemplate
whether Stein would invite to her lovely
apartment someone she knew would be
very likely to blow it up.
But let us investigate another flaw in
Stein's logic. Let us assume that Israel
gave the Palestinians, tomorrow, every
thing they wanted: a state, a flag and a
capital in Jerusalem. The only condition
is closed borders: You want to come to
Israel, you get a visa. As Stein acutely
pointed out, the new state would lack
the necessary infrastructure to function
as a stable economy, leading to poverty
and, inevitably, terror. She would still
have you believe that Israel would be at
fault if it did not supply the new state
with support, money and jobs. So Israel
cannot do anything that would satisfy
Stein unless, of course, it devotes all its
resources to sustaining those who still
call for its destruction. We are not sug
gesting that peace cannot be achieved,
we are just saying that solutions are
complicated and that all sides are
responsible for successes and failures.
In attempting to demonstrate impar
tiality, the onlv fault Stein finds with

Arafat is that he is overly harsh in
repressing the activities of terrorist
organizations. Even the most enlight
ened nations have discovered that it is
problematic to deal democratically with
those who oppose democracy. Taking
measures against terrorism should be
done cautiously and under the strict
guidance of law. But in a lawless land,
sometimes harsher means need to be
employed, as Arafat (indeed with the
encouragement of Israel) has sometimes
done. Imagine an armed serial killer
lurking free in the streets of your neigh
borhood; the police might consider tak
ing him dead or alive but would rarely
negotiate with him over a cup of coffee.
Lastly, we are calling on all sides
involved in the Middle East conflict to
reach a swift, just and lasting peace
agreement. If not for their own sake, at
least for the sake of Daily readers.
Only peace may free us from Stein's
barrage of letters. If that does not help
(and we suspect it might not), we don't
know what will.
