# When a 'no' vote can actually mean 'yes'
## 
### 
The campus is being plastered with
campaign flyers. Soon you will start to
tune them out, or get annoyed, or maybe
even read every single one. But whatever
your reaction to "Vote for Jill" or "Vote
Yes on the Stanford Spelunking Special
Fee," don't let it deter you from voting.
Voting in the student elections is easy. It

takes less than five minutes. You can do it
from any computer with World Wide Web
access. If you have a computer phobia there
are a few paper voting places on campus.
Why should you vote? Well, because it's
your right and responsibility and all that
philosophical jazz. But also, your not vot
ing is not a neutral statement; it can decide
the election. In order for student groups to
win their special fee, 15 percent of the stu
dent body must vote yes on their group.
Of course, if 1,500 people vote yes,
which is more than 15 percent of the

undergraduate population, but. 2,000 peo
ple vote no, the group will still lose.
Suppose, however, that 600 people
vote yes and no one votes no for a given
undergraduate group. The group will
lose because it didn't get the requisite
15 percent.
Suppose, finally, that 1,500 people
vote yes and an additional 000 people vote
no. Now the group will win because it
reached the 15-perccnt marker of yes
votes and received a majority of yes votes.
No matter how you feel about various

groups, even if you don't know anything
about them, it is important that you vote
for each and every group â€” it won't take
you more than a minute or two to click
once for each group, but it's a difference
of several thousand dollars and lots of
great programs for the groups involved.
