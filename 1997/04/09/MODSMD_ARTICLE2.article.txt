# Computer intruder steals passwords
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
A computer network intruder may have
gained access to almost 240 e-mail account pass
words last week.
According to an advisory issued by Computer
Security Officer Stephen Hansen, a network snif
fer — a type of computer program — operated for
two days in the Durand Building's computer sys
tem before it was discovered last Thursday.
The sniffer captured information including
the login names and passwords of users whose
network connections were not encrypted.
In order to install a sniffer, one must have
"root" access to computer networks that is only

granftxl to "superusers," said UNIX Systems Ad
ministrator Betty Lee. "Superuser" status is lim
ited to authorized personnol. However, a security
hole in one of the programs allowed the intruder
to gain "root" access without authorization,
said.
The incident is still under investigation,
Hansen said.
Security personnel have already alerted the
administrators of the systems possibly affected
by the activity of the sniffer; there were almost 80
of them. The sniffer mainly captured the pass
words of those individuals who attempted to
make a connection from Durand, Ixie said.
Leo decided to close off 57 affected Leland ac
counts on Friday night to prevent the intruder

from accessing them over the weekend.
According to Lee, security breaches happen
roughly twice a year The number of users affect
ed gets smaller and smaller because more people
are using encryption programs.
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Douglas Brutlag,
who is in charge of draft ing the University poli
cy on network usage, said the policy provides
broad guidelines to make computing as safe as
possible.
Most of the specifics of implementing the f>oli
cy are left up to I lansen, Brutlag said. 1 lowever,
provisions exist for dealing with security breach
es within the University. These include the possi
bility of Fundamental Standard violation charges
being levied against a student.
