## Slipping into the future 
### 
I DON'T KNOW how it happened, but
somehow I never found out about the
time change last weekend. I spent
Monday adrift in a raging, senseless sea
of appointments and deadlines that I
somehow, mysteriously, kept missing. I
felt a sort of twirling, relentless nausea
all day. In a day I thought I had planned
perfectly, down to the hour, my watch —
and my planner — betrayed me.
I first discovered day planners when I
got to Stanford, and I quickly decided
that I despised them. Day planners, I
thought, were as insidious and life-dead
ening as airports. Time management had
the euphemistic, patently evil ring of eth
nic cleansing. I hated having to make
advance appointments with planner
bound friends. I wanted my days to
unfold naturally. I wanted to go about
my life without the tyranny of obligation.
And I was confident that the world would
conform to my schedule instead of the
other way around.
To that end, I didn't wear a watch that
entire year and never, ever made calen
dars for myself. I probably also missed
every paper deadline, never made it to an
appointment on time and generally float
ed about campus as clueless and naively
gratified as a tourist. Now for some peo
ple this might seem like a personal hell,
but I've never been very anal about get
ting things done according to schedule. It
all seemed quite natural.
The change came sometime in the mid

die of sophomore year. I had slowly and
grudgingly started to wear my watch.
Then came scratch-paper to-do lists,
weekly assignment charts and scheduled
meetings. I tend to gravitate toward
behavioral extremes, so I quickly went
from clueless to psychotic. Soon I was a
copious list-maker and always knew what
week of the quarter it was. That summer,
I made a 500-mile quest through the flat,
hot mid-Kansas plains to purchase my
own, personal Franklin planner — the
Mercedes of time management tools.
This may sound crazy, but you must
understand that I fell for the Franklin
brochure hard-core. Somehow it seemed
I could accomplish anything with a
Franklin Day Planner. I would finally be
cured of my congenital lateness. If I had
such a detailed time management sys
tem, I thought I would never disappoint
my friends or professors again. With spe
cial pages to write down my future goals,
I felt sure that I would eventually come
up with some. In the heat of inspiration,
I was convinced that my salvation lay
between those two shiny black leather
covers.
With my Franklin, I could simultane
ously view my day, my week, my year and
my three-year plan. There was an elabo
rate code for recording daily assign
ments, including an itemized list of tasks
ranked in order of importance. I could
write down my personal and professional
goals, catalogue my friends' phone num

bcrs and birthdays and keep a record of
all my grades. I penned in my assign
ments and penciled in my friends. I knew
the time in Wichita, Paris, Tokyo and
Stuttgart. I probably spent more time
planning my work than actually doing it.
But my Franklin phase didn't last
long. Somehow my messy, perennially
late, spacy, preoccupied self always wins
out. No matter how hard I try to unmess
and de-space myself, nothing short of a
comet-trail miracle can make me con
form to what seems so infuriatingly sim
ple: being on time. For me, the urge to
plan takes its place among a litany of
other ritual attempts at self-improve
ment: aerobics, skin cream, vegetarian
eating. Some have worked better than
others. But when it comes to time man
agement, I just can't seem to buck
nature.
So what's the moral in all this? Well,
maybe there's a compromise. What if
everyone lived on the fly every once in a
while? Maybe set aside their planners to
think, dream, space out. Missed a couple
of appointments, maybe. Who says wast
ing time isn't good for the soul?
