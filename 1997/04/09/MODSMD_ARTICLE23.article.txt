Where does the time go when it's not
around here?"
Barenaked Ladies (it's a rock band)
AT 2:00 SUNDAY morning, the
United States slept through its
biannual Changing of the Clock.
1 hrough some combination of magic,
witchcraft and timing, the ticking and
tocking of timepieces everywhere myste
riously skipped the 2 a.m. hour Sunday
morning in an effort to save a little day
light for children everywhere.
And so we "spring forward" just as we
have "fallen back" the last Sunday of
every October since the inception of a
standardized Daylight Saving Time way
back in the historic year of 1966. (Yes, I
did my research.) Every spring, people
everywhere have the opportunity to com
plain that, once again, they "lost" anoth
er hour of sleep. If only they would have
saved that hour they were given in Octo
ber, instead of blowing it on an extra
hour of "USA Up All Night." But no,
everyone wants instant gratification.

So where does all that time go, any
way? 1 understand the idea of losing one's
keys or sunglasses or little brother, but
how do you "lose" 60 minutes? Where
does it all go if you don't have it and 1
don't have it and it isn't stuck in the cush
ions of the couch? Can you ever find it
again? You had it at one point . . . and
then you lost it... so now where is it?
This is all getting a little too "meta"
for me.
Twice each year, I begin to feel a little
anxious at about a quarter to 2 on those
fateful Sunday mornings — just 15 min
utes before we set the clocks forward or
backward an hour. Some of it is just the
sheer mortification at having to figure
out how to reset the time on not just my
alarm clock but also the wall clock, my
watch, the VCR, the computer and the
clock in my car. Some of it is just feeling
strange about skipping or creating a
whole hour of Sunday morning with the
touch of a button (or a few buttons simul
taneously). I feel like I'm playing God.
And is it just me, or do you figure that

every other person is going to forget to
reset their clocks? 1 figure that every per
son that I have a meeting with the Sim
day after I change my clocks will forget to
change their clocks and be an hour late.
So, of course, I'm that jerk running
around the house, saying "Hey guys,
don't forget to change your clocks!
Spring forward, guys, and it's springtime
again! Two o'clock, guys, don't forget!
Areya ready?" Yep, that jerk is me.
And did you know that the word "Sav
ing" in Daylight Saving Time, does not
have an "s" on the end? Apparently this
is very important. Bob Aldrich, the infor
mation officer for the California Energy
Commission, makes a particular note
about this, writing (on the CEC's World
Wide Web site): "It is Daylight Saving
(singular) Time, NOT Daylight SavingS
Time. We are saving daylight, so it is sin
gular, not plural." Thanks, Bob, for
enlightening us wit h a little grammar les
son. Wouldn't want to screw t hat one up,
now would we?
My favorite thing about the entire

Daylight Saving Time tradition is the
fact that Arizona doesn't do it. They just
don't do it. Leave it to Arizona to be the
pain in our collective ass. Arizona is just
jealous because they have at least one
cactus for every man, woman and child
and not a soul could care less. Hawaii
doesn't do Daylight Saving Time either.
But Hawaii doesn't count because of all
the coconuts, pineapples and volcanoes.
This only leaves the eastern half of
Indiana. The western half of Indiana
observes Daylight Saving Time, of course,
t the eastern half has chosen to isolate
itself from the rest of the state (and the
country) and not follow the crowd. Why
can't Terre Haute and Muncie put aside
their differences and just get along? And
why can't all of Indiana find the time to
compromise and end this bitter division
between east and west? Just remember
the horrific schism in post-war Berlin.
And remember the bitter division of West
Virginia and (East) Virginia. And what of
East and West Palo Alto?
In my research, I even encountered an

entire Web site dedicated to the eradica
tion of Daylight Saving Time due to the
fact that some people don't like resetting
their clocks back an hour just so they am
set them forward again in six months. The
site features a giant clock with a line
through it. Currently, this movement has
a grand total of 13 members. And growing.
So, enjoy the extra hour of daylight.
And while you're basking in that extra
hour of sunshine, take a moment to think
of those people out there who spend way
too much time thinking about time and
think about them for a while. And then
think about where all that, time goes, and
if you could find it all, you would have
plenty of time to do that problem set.
And then stop thinking. It's spring
quarter, for God's sake.

Jeremy Desman, who graduated last
week with a degree in public policy, can't
believe how fast time can fly.
