## Human blood cells immune to HIV discovered Clinical applications of finding may lead to new AIDS treatment 
### Rollin Hu Contributing writer 
In a major leap forward for
AIDS researchers, Stanford scien
tists have discovered human
blood cells that appear to be
immune to HIV.
These cells, called naive CD4
T-cells, aid in the body's initial
response to foreign invaders such
as viruses and bacteria.
Until recently, many scientists
believed that these naive CD4 T
cells were prime targets for the
AIDS virus. However, the recent
study led by a genetics research
associate at the Stanford Medical
School, Mario Roederer, suggests
that these cells are somehow
immune to the harmful effects of
HIV.
Several types of T-cells roam
around in the bloodstream, form
ing the backbone of the human
immune system. For example,
CD4 and CDB T-cells, so named
because of their specific surface
proteins, are the body's front-line
soldiers against infection. These
two types of T-cells can be further
classified into the naive and mem
ory cell categories.
Naive T-cells are newly created
immune cells freshly released
from the thymus, floating around
the bloodstream in search of
invading organisms. They are
termed naive because they have
not yet encountered any foreign
molecules.
Once they do encounter
invaders, they mount an immune
response, divide and turn into
memory T-cells which linger for
years in the bloodstream and

remember how to protect the
body against a repeated attack by
the same invading organism.
About half of all CD4 T-cells cir
culating in the bloodstream are
naive, while the other half are
memory T-cells.
Roederer's new finding indi
cates that the HIV virus does not
replicate in the naive CD4 T-cells.
To obtain this intriguing result,

Roederer and his collaborators
first separated HIV-infected naive
cells from HIV-infected memory
T-cells in test tubes Because 11IV
only replicates in dividing cells,
Roederer prompted the T-cells to
duplicate themselves by exposing
them to natural stimulatory pro
teins.
After repeated cell division, an
interesting result was obtained.

According to Roederer, "The
memory cells produced the virus
under this stimulation, but the
naive cells produced none.
"The virus did not replicate in
the naive cells, although the virus
was there," he continued. "The
cells divided like mad, but the
virus did not come out."
Observations of AIDS patients,
however, still indicate that the

number of naive CI)4 T-cells
decreases as HIV infection pro
grosses.
"Until now, many resennhers
believed that the CD4 T-cells dis
appear because HIV gets into
them and kills them," said Roed
erer. "But since HIV doesn't kill
naive T-cells, something else
must be causing the loss of these
cells in people with HIV disease.

Our current theory is that it a tin
destruction of the thymus that is
causing abnormally low levels ot
T-cells. Hut we don t lealh
know."
This new development could
point future AIDS research o tht
direction ot the thymus, and 11
also could bring scientists >.loset
to a cure or vaccine toi tin epi
demic.
In further applications, Koed
erer said his results could explain
a finding reported in the June
1996 issue of Science submitted
by Carl June of the Naval Medi
cal Research Institute in Bethes
da, Md. June observed that upon
inducing a mixture of HlV
infected naive and memory T
cells to divide one-millionfold, no
virus remained in the cell cul
ture. According to Roederer,
"It's as if the culture cured itself
of HIV."
Roederer suggests that the
mysterious disappearance of the
virus can be explained by his
observation that HIV in naive
CD4 T-cells fail to replicate. Since
naive cells reproduce more quick
ly than memory cells, naive cells
could have taken over the final
cell mixture in June's study The
virus, being unable U replicatt in
naive cells, eventually disap
peared
This observation may even
lead to new toward
fighting lIIV "You could cakt
CD4 T-cells from people with HIV
and allow the cells to multiply.
This would eliminate the virus
from their cells. Then you could
give them back their own virus
free cells," said Roederer.
