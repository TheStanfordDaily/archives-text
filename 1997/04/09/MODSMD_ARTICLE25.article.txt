Stanford professor wins March of Dimes prize

The 1997 March of Dimes Prize in Developmental
Biology has been awarded to Medicine Prof. David
Hogness for the discovery of homeobox genes. The dis
covery of these genes helped solve the mystery of how
living creatures develop from an embryo into an adult
organism.
Before the discovery of homeobox genes, little was
understood about how each part of an animal's

embryo knew exactly where and how to develop in relation to the rest
of its body.
Homeobox genes, called the "master architect genes," are the
directors, ensuring, for instance, that the arms are attached to the
upper half of the body and that the eyes are attached to the head.
Homeobox genes can be found in all animals, including fruit flies,
frogs and humans.
In the future, scientists may be able to use their understanding of
homeobox genes to correct congenital defects and disease by switch
ing these genes on or off.
"It gives us hope that some day we may be able to prevent or treat
many disabling and fatal disorders," said Jennifer Howse, president
of March of Dimes.
Drug resistance evolution in marine animals

Scientists at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station
have discovered a mechanism in certain cells that
provides resistance to a wide range of drugs, open
ing the door to understanding how cancer cells
developed mechanisms allowing them to withstand
chemotherapy.
The research team at the station, headed by Biolo
gy Prof. David Epel has isolated a protein called an

MDR pump found in the walls of certain cells within mussels and fat
innkeeper worms. These pumps force toxins out of cells. Epel theo
rizes that there are a wide array of different MDR pumps, each tar
geting a certain group of chemicals.
Seemingly fragile embryos, marine creatures, bacteria and tumor
cells have evolved this mechanism over the past million years to pro
tect themselves from naturally occurring toxins.
Chemotherapy is often ineffective in patients with MDR-laden
tumor cells, creating a serious obstacle to the treatment of various
cancers. Scientists hope to find ways of blocking the function of this
pump to improve treatments for cancer and other infectious diseases.
