# Thalidomide used in narcolepsy studies
## 
### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
You are walking to your first
class of spring quarter when you
spot a group of friends heading
toward you. You stop for a few
minutes to chat, and you start to
laugh hysterically at a joke.
The next thing you know, you
feel your knees buckle under you
and you suddenly crash to the
ground. You try to get up, but it
seems as though none of the
muscles in your body are work
ing. Scary? This is the beginning
of a narcoleptic attack.
Narcolepsy is a serious sleep
ing disorder that is characterized
by four primary symptoms —
excessive daytime sleepiness,
sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hal
lucinations and cataplexy.
During sleep paralysis, the
person is unable to move for sev
eral minutes upon falling asleep
or waking up. In hypnagogic hal
lucinations, a dream-like halluci
nation is experienced in the pro
cess of falling asleep.
Cataplexy is a unique condi
tion of narcolepsy in which there
is a sudden loss of muscle control
usually brought on by strong
emotions such as laughter. Such
paralysis can be confined to a
small part of the body, as in the
weakening of a grip, or it may
involve the entire body.
Sleep can be categorized into
two main types — non-REM
sleep and REM sleep. These nar
coleptic conditions are usually
seen in REM sleep, the stage of
sleep in which dreams often
occur when the brain is in high
activity while the body is immo
bile.
Narcolepsy affects about one
American in every 2,000, and
despite much research in this
area, little is known about the
pathophysiology of this neuro
logical disorder.
The role of thalidomide in
stimulating cataplectic reactions
is a recent discovery that sheds

new light on narcolepsy.
Thalidomide was first intro
duced in Germany in 1956 under
the name of Contergan. It was
used as a popular sleeping drug
in various parts of Europe and
Japan because it could induce
sleep without any obvious side
effects. But the discovery of fetal
abnormalities it caused quickly
led to a world-wide ban on the
drug.
Thalidomide never entered
the American market because
the Food and Drug Administra
tion never approved it. "Since
then, thalidomide was only
available for experimental and
research purposes," said Seiji
Nishino, associate director of
the Stanford Center for Nar
colepsy.
In the 19605, researchers dis
covered the potential use of
thalidomide in the treatment of
conditions involving the human
immune system. These condi
tions incluaed leprosy and pha
ryngeal ulcerations, both of
which are caused by bacterial
infections.
With the discovery of the anti
inflammatory and immunomod
ulatory properties of thalido
mide, sleep researchers began to
study the connection between
narcolepsy and immunity.
It had also been shown that
narcolepsy is associated with a
specific human leukocyte anti
gen. HLA is a part of the major
histocompatibility complex, an
important component of the
human immune system. MHC
allows the body to distinguish
between foreign and host cells.
Because of thalidomide's con
nection to sleep and immunity,
specifically HLA, it was proposed
that autoimmunity may also
play a role in the development of
narcolepsy.
Nishino said, however, that
although "the immune system
may be involved, [narcolepsy] is
not a case of classical autoim
mune disease."

A recent collaborative study
by researchers in Japan and at
Stanford found that thalido
mide increased cataplexy in
canine narcolepsy. A specially
bred colony of narcoleptic
Dobermans was used in ibis
project because they exhibit
many behavioral and physiolog
ical similarities found in human
narcolepsy
The idea behind the research
was that because thalidomide
plays a part in both sleep and
immune function, it could be a
useful chemical to study the
pathophysiology of sleep regula
tion.
Thalidomide also induces
sleep without disrupting REM
sleep, producing a sleeping pat
tern very similar to normal phys
iological sleep and making it. an
ideal drug for this study.
The mechanism by which
thalidomide induces sleep is still
unknown.
Tests show that thalidomide
only triggers cataplexy in ani
mals with narcolepsy, while nor
mal animals were not affected.
Furthermore, thalidomide was
not seen to hind or change any
neurotransmitter systems that

are known to influence cata
plexy.
The joint Japan-Stanford
research group has also shown
that canine narcolepsy is assoii
ated with a rise in a particulat
immune factor called TNFa. an
important immunological signal
ing molecule that decreases
REM sleep. The introduction of
thalidomide causes the produc
(ion of the TNFa factor to he
inhibited in narcoleptic dogs.
This further supports the idea
that thalidomide influences cat a
plexy via the immune function
and not by neurotransmittei
pathway.
Further research needs to be
done in the study of thalidomide
and its association with sleep. Its
role in both sleep regulation and
immune function has, however,
helped sleep researchers learn
more about narcolepsy and move
closer to finding a new and bet
ter treatment for this sleeping
disorder.
"We don't know much about
how thalidomide induces sleep
but we do know that the immune
system is very important for the
regulation of sleep," Nishino
said.
