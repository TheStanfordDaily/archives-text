Q I'm always, getting lost. Is
m there anything I can do <

A .You could buy a map. But if
• you don't know where you
are, even u map won't help you. If
you have the means and the desire,
check out something called GPS.
The Global Positioning System
provides the technology to tell
you, nearly instantaneously,
where you are within 60 feet (if
you are the military) or 100 feet (if
you are a civilian). You get lati
tude, longitude and even altitude
of your location.
That's pretty good, but the fed
eral government reports that with
in a decade, the accuracy will be
even higher.
If you think about it for a
minute, it's pretty obvious why

this technology is so useful.
Emergency vehicles use GPS to
find and plan t he best route to their
destinations. Trucking companies
use it to keep track of their vehi
cles. Scientists use it to monitor
and study earthquakes. Regular
people use GPS, too. Boaters, civil
ian pilots and automobile drivers
use GPS to navigate.
The Department of Defense
has spent about $12 billion
putting up the network of satel
lites that supports GPS. It w;is ini
tially intended for military use.
Recognizing its enormous com
mercial potential, the companies
that built some of the equipment
encouraged the government to
make GPS available to the public.

Because the technology could be
used to malevolent ends by terror
ists and smugglers, the govern
ment chose to release GPS infor
mation to the public on a "selective
availability" basis. This means that
the civilian signal is randomly
altered, reducing the accuracy to
100 feet.
"But wait," you ask, "how does
it work?" That question I can
answer, for I am the Science Bug.
But I'm afraid that's classified
information. Just kidding.
GPS requires the accuracy of an
atomic clock to work. I'll give you a
bit of background: The story of the
atomic clock goes back to I. I. Rabi
at Columbia University in the
19305. Rabi was the researcher

who invented magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. You chem majors
should be familiar with this
Rabi won the Nobel Prize in
1944 for his work It was at this
time that he suggested that an
incredibly accurate timepiece
might bo possible using the new
resonance t«rhnology.
His student, Norman Ramsey,
went on to develop and test Rabi's
hypothesis. The cesium atomic
clocks found in < »PS satellites work
based on the mechanism Rabi sug
gested so many years ago.
So we have atomic clocks that
keep good time. Hut what does this
have to do with < IPS?
Well, I just mentioned that
there are atomic clocks in GPS

satellites. The .satellites orbits an
arranged such that fiom . very spot
on the planet, one can n reive tin
GPS signal from at le,i. t lour >ate|
lites. The signal is |ii t a nroadi a t
of the current time of the clock
imide. A GPS nreiver compare
th' f ime sent by the -aN llite t«> it
intornal time. Based »n how mm li
nee there is in ft time a
distance can !«• calculate*)
My using the distance trom
tnree satellites, the p<> it ion of
the receiver can hi <l» t«•> mined
accurately
So remember if you end up in
the middle ofa bullfight t' proba
