### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
After struggling through a
tough weekend in Southern
California, the seventh
ranked Stanford men's tennis
team reasserted its domi
nance, victimizing top-15 foe
Illinois in a laughably easy 7-0
victory.
Riding behind sophomore
Ryan Wolters' brilliant play at
the No. 1 spot, the Cardinal
won the singles roster from
top to bottom, dropping only
one set. The All-American
Wolters produced a particu
larly strong performance, dis
mantling Illini top seed Cary
Franklin 6-3, 6-0.
"Ryan just played extreme
ly well," said freshman Geoff
Abrams. "Anytime you can
beat a No. 1 on a top-20 team
so convincingly, you have to
be on top of your game."
The Cardinal opened sea
son on the Illini by sweeping
the doubles matches and tak
ing a quick 1-0 lead with the
doubles point. At the top slot,
freshman twins Bob and Mike
Bryan defeated Illinois' No. 1
pairing of Jerry Turek and
Brady Blain 8-5. Abrams and
senior Grant Elliott had little
trouble with the Illini's
Franklin and Oliver Freelove
at the No. 2 position, taking
the match 8-4. The No. 3 dou
bles match produced a similar
result, with Wolters and
junior Misha Palecek notch

ing an 8-6 victory over Jeff
Laski and Matthew Snyder.
"Doubles really stepped
up," Abrams said. "It's been a
little trouble in the past so it
was good to go out and get
those wins.
"It's important to get that
1-0 lead. It's the difference
between having to win three
of six doubles matches and
four of six. It definitely took
the wind out of their sails."
In singles play, Bob Bryan
continued to fill in admirably
for injured junior All-Ameri
can Paul Goldstein, breezing
by Turek in straight sets 6-2,
6-3. At No. 3, brother Mike
Bryan struggled with Freelove
in the first set, gutting out a
7-5 win, before taking com
mand of the match and crush
ing Freelove 6-1 in the second.
Abrams found little prob
lem in getting past Illinois'
Jakub Teply, taking the No. 4
match in straight sets 6-2, 6-
4. In No. 6 singles Charles
Hoeveler also cruised, drop
ping only five games total in a
6-4, 6-1 victory over Snyder.
The Cardinal's lone set loss
of the meet came at the No. 5
slot, as Elliott dropped the
second set before roaring back
amid the cheers of his team
mates to take the decisive set
and score a 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 win.
Despite the apparent ease
of the Cardinal's win yester
day, the transition to playing
without Goldstein has proved to
be trying for the squad.
"It may seem easy, but inter
nally, it's tough," Abrams said.
"Everybody except the No. 1
(Wolters) has to bring their
game up a notch and it's hard,
but everyone is doing a great job
making the adjustment."
