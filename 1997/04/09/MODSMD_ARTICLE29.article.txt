# Women cruise past No. 17 Cal 7-2
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
It was your typical California-Stanford women's
tennis matchup. Traditionally, records and rank
ings have meant little as both squads get up for this
rivalry. Yesterday's meeting in Berkeley between
the second-ranked Cardinal and the 17th-ranked
Golden Bears was no exception.
But Stanford (22-1, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) managed to squeak past host
Cal by the score of 7-2 in a match that was much
closer than the score indicates.
The Bears (12-6, 2-4) took two singles matches,
sent three others into three sets and narrowly lost
two doubles matches 9-7.
But the Cardinal outlasted Cal to win its 30th
consecutive Pac-10 match and its 11th straight
overall dual match. The victory completed a sweep
of archrival Cal «us Stanford defeated the Golden
Bears earlier this season at home.
Stanford freshman Lilia Osterloh, who missed
the first meeting between the two teams due to
injury, led the way for the Cardinal. Osterloh took
the No. 1 singles match with Amanda Augustus in
straight sets 6-3, 6-0.
The only other Stanford singles competitor to
win in straight sets for the Cardinal was junior
Ania Bleszynski, the Cardinal's No. 5 player.
Bleszynski squashed a spilt attempt by Cal's
Gmeka Mayes by winning a second-set tiebreak
and the match 6-2, 7-6.
The Golden Bears earned a straight-set win of
their own in the No. 6 match in which Lisa Swerni
ak battled her way to a tight 7-6, 6-4 victory over
Cardinal junior Julie Scott. In the No. 4 singles
match, senior Sandra De Silva bounced back from a
first-set-tiebreak loss to Claire Curran. After taking
the second set 6-2, De Silva rolled in the decisive
third set to win 6-7, 6-2, 6-0.
In the No. 2 match, freshman Anne Kremer,
back after a bout with strep throat, also lost a tight
first set but refused to throw in the towel. Kremer
and Cal's Francesca La'O stayed tight through all
three sets, but Kremer came out on top with a 6-7,
7-5, 6-4 triumph.
Cal earned its second and final point in the No.

had two 8-0 doubles wins of
their own last weekend against

ranked doubles team in the nation,
had trouble of their own in the No.
2 match but eked out a 9-7 win as
