# Technology changing ways of knowledge and teaching
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
Imagine graduating from Stanford
without ever experiencing the palm
trees along Palm Drive. Imagine study
ing for four years without meeting a
professor or stepping inside a library.
Traditional notions of teaching and
learning are being turned on their heads
as the proliferation of new technology
transforms university learning from a
literal to a virtual experience.
"In the industrial age, we went to
school; in the information age, school
comes to us," said Andy DiPaolo, senior
associate dean of the School of Engi
neering and executive director of the
Stanford Center for Professional Devel
opment.
No longer bound by geographical lo
cation, students around the globe can
earn virtual degrees at online universi
ties without ever setting foot on a literal
campus. They can download books and
articles from the Internet 24 hours a
day without having to negotiate with
grouchy librarians or mastermind li
brary closing hours. With one flick of
the computer keyboard, they can share
philosophical ponderings with profes
sors th v have never met from the com
fort of ;ir own home.
But, s technology increasingly
transforn s the learning environment,
will students be adversely affected by
the lack of human interaction and the

shift away from more traditional learn
ing tools like books? Will university
campuses become increasingly desert
ed and will future generations of 18- to
23-year-olds be denied the rite of pas
sage typically enjoyed by college stu
dents?
Off-campus learning
For 28 years, Stanford's distance
learning program at the Stanford In
structional Television Network has
beamed Stanford classes to students
who may have never entered a Stanford
classroom. More than 3,500 graduate
students have already taken advantage
of Stanford's distance learning pro
grams, earning degrees in subjects
ranging from aeronautics to modern
languages.
Today, SITN offers more than 250
graduate-level courses and serves 187
companies at 250 different locations
around the world. Courses are trans
mitted by video to students in the com
fort of their own home or work place.
Study groups take place online.
DiPaolo maintains that students
taking the SITN courses do not neces
sarily miss out on the campus experi
ence just because they do not attend lec
tures. They can tune into Stanford lec
tures live and contact study group tu
tors by e-mail or in person as questions
arise.

New technology, such as these video units, have
influenced teaching and learning methods both in
and outside the classroom.
