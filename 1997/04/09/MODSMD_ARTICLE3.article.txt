# Technology changing ways of knowledge and teaching
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
Imagine graduating from Stanford
without ever experiencing the palm
trees along Palm Drive. Imagine study
ing for four years without meeting a
professor or stepping inside a library.
Traditional notions of teaching and
learning are being turned on their heads
as the proliferation of new technology
transforms university learning from a
literal to a virtual experience.
"In the industrial age, we went to
school; in the information age, school
comes to us," said Andy DiPaolo, senior
associate dean of the School of Engi
neering and executive director of the
Stanford Center for Professional Devel
opment.
No longer bound by geographical lo
cation, students around the globe can
earn virtual degrees at online universi
ties without ever setting foot on a literal
campus. They can download books and
articles from the Internet 24 hours a
day without having to negotiate with
grouchy librarians or mastermind li
brary closing hours. With one flick of
the computer keyboard, they can share
philosophical ponderings with profes
sors th v have never met from the com
fort of ;ir own home.
But, s technology increasingly
transforn s the learning environment,
will students be adversely affected by
the lack of human interaction and the

shift away from more traditional learn
ing tools like books? Will university
campuses become increasingly desert
ed and will future generations of 18- to
23-year-olds be denied the rite of pas
sage typically enjoyed by college stu
dents?
Off-campus learning
For 28 years, Stanford's distance
learning program at the Stanford In
structional Television Network has
beamed Stanford classes to students
who may have never entered a Stanford
classroom. More than 3,500 graduate
students have already taken advantage
of Stanford's distance learning pro
grams, earning degrees in subjects
ranging from aeronautics to modern
languages.
Today, SITN offers more than 250
graduate-level courses and serves 187
companies at 250 different locations
around the world. Courses are trans
mitted by video to students in the com
fort of their own home or work place.
Study groups take place online.
DiPaolo maintains that students
taking the SITN courses do not neces
sarily miss out on the campus experi
ence just because they do not attend lec
tures. They can tune into Stanford lec
tures live and contact study group tu
tors by e-mail or in person as questions
arise.

New technology, such as these video units, have
influenced teaching and learning methods both in
and outside the classroom.
"Because it's an interactive
system, whatever is happening on
campus, they are experiencing it
too," said DiPaolo, who oversees
the SITN program. "With new
technology, it's a faster and much
richer experience."
Stanford was one of the first
universities in the country to set
up a distance learning program in
the late 19605, and the program
still acts as a model today, accord
ing to DiPaolo. By 1996, more
than half of all universities in the
country had caught onto the idea
and offered some kind of distance
learning program.
In order to keep Stanford at the
cutting edge of new technological
advances in the world of educa
tion, University President Ger
hard Casper set up a Commission
on Technology in Teaching and
Learning in October 1994.
"Technology may enhance in
come opportunities for the Univer
sity and potentially reduce the
costs of delivering education,"
reads the mission statement. "It
can allow Stanford to become a
truly world-wide institution of
learning, reachingout to new types
of students and embracing the con
cept of life-long learning through
new models of continuing educa
tion."
According to Chris Thomson,
managing director of the commis
sion, distance learning programs
can provide a two-way exchange

between industry and academia
that is mutually beneficial.
SITN's engineering program is
a case in point. Research engi
neers at Stanford keep abreast of
technological advances in Silicon
Valley as practicing scientists par
ticipate in Stanford's degree pro
grams.
Stanford's distance learning
program is also lucrative, charg
ing 40 percent more than the nor
mal Stanford tuition fees.
Despite the potential for en
hancing income opportunities for
Stanford, the focus of the Com
mission on Technology in Teach
ing and Learning is to improve
teaching at Stanford itself, rather
than extending its reputation to
the outside world, according to
Thomsen.
"It may be appropriate for
Stanford to provide extension
learning," he said, "but in general
it might not be the best use of re
sources for Stanford to excel."
Learning online
Thomsen was cautious about
Stanford's involvement with the
California Virtual University,
which Gov. Pete Wilson initiated
last year after declining to join
with other Western states in an
other online enterprise — the
Western Governor's University.
Two members of Stanford's
Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning are also
on the planning board of Califor
nia Virtual University. When the
project goes online, Stanford will
work together with other West
coast universities, such as

UCLA, to offer courses and pro
grams via the Internet. But stu
dents will still have to apply to
Stanford via traditional chan
nels. It will therefore be difficult
to enroll a parrot at California's
virtual university, as happened
recently at another online insti
tution.
According to Thomsen, online
teaching methods are far better
suited to more applied, "utilitari
an" skills, such as accounting and
marketing, than to areas of acade
mic research where Stanford is
traditionally stronger.
"There is not a great deal of
value added by Stanford re
search" to subjects like account
ing or marketing, said Thomsen.
"It's not something that Stanford
excels in."
Virtual isolation?
Some have argued that the lack
of human interaction fostered by
distance learning is detrimental
to the educational experience.
"Distance learning, as televi
sion before it, is likely to increase
social isolation," said Casper in
his 1995 address to the American
Educational Research Associa
tion, "though the electronic pen
pals from the Internet may offer
some, if only 'virtual,' protection
against such isolation."
While online communication is
less personal than face-to-face in
teraction, most professors main
tain that e-mails have increased
the amount of contact they have
with students, particularly with
shy students who may have hesi
tated to contact them personally.

Internet interaction
Since the advent of the Inter
net, e-mail communication has
become an essential part of the
educational experience for both
faculty and students. At Stan
ford, an average of 158,000 e
mails are generated by the 30,000
faculty, staff and students every
day on the Leland server alone,
according the statistics generated
by Stanford's Distributed Com
puting Communication Systems.
This works out at an average of 50
messages per person per day.
It is difficult to imagine life
without an e-mail account at
Stanford, although some stu
dents have refused to give in to
the demands of new technology.
Eliel Swinton, a senior who
played on the Stanford football
team, is about to graduate from
Stanford. He holds the rare dis
tinction of surviving an entire ca
reer at Stanford without opening
an e-mail account.
"I felt like I didn't need it,"
said Swinton. "I felt like it was
just jibber-jabber. People send
messages about nothing. You
might as well pick up the phone."
Swinton does not feel as if he
missed out on any information by
opting out of the e-mail loop.
"Professors say they've sent
an e-mail, but they always repeat
the information in class anyway,"
he said.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said that the invention of e
mail is a curse, but an efficient
curse.
"I spend up to two hours a day

answering e-mail from students at
Stanford and from around entire
world, including high school stu
dents who view my video series,"
he said. And while more students
contact Zimbardo now than in the
past, particularly shy students,
they miss out on a lot of his non
verbal hugs because they never
come to see him personally, he
said.
Former University President
Don Kennedy agreed that e-mail
is no substitute for seeing stu
dents face-to-face.
"E-mail has been an addition
for most people under most cir
cumstances," he said, "lit] should
not be the end of the line."
In the same way, Kennedy said
that the Internet has provided a
vast resource to students and fac
ulty alike.
"Students who approach it in
telligently can be much more pro
ductive," he said. "But it's an in
ternational flea market. We have
to learn what can be taken with a
grain of salt and what can be
taken with a salt shaker."
Librarian Steve Gass, who is
head of the Science and Engineer
ing Resource Group, said the
World Wide Web has become "the
vtlOO" of our generation.
"With the Web, we're begin
ning to see the creation of 'knowl
edge environments,' " he said.
"Basically, technology has begun
to allow us to realize the promise
of delivering actual resources di
rectly to the user's desktop."
But for Gass, the greatest chal
lenge for libraries in the face of
the information revolution is in

tegrating traditional library
methods with new technology
while keeping library users
happy.
"We're stuck in a 'both end'
problem," he said. "It's not like
all of a sudden we can stop doing
the old stuff for the new."
Deputy University Librarian
Karen Nagy agreed. "Books are
not going away," she said. "More
people are coming into the li
brary."
According to Nagy, posting
Stanford's library card catalog
online and digitizing collections
of rare materials has piqued peo
ple's interest in the hard copies.
Although students and re
searchers can now access ab
stracts and catalog details online,
more people are actually coming
into libraries to find the materi
als, said Nagy.
"Those [resources] have pro
duced more requests for interli
brary loans," she said.
Technology and the future
For the time being at least, it
seems that new methods of teach
ing and learning will exist along
side more traditional methods of
education. While attending a real
university campus may one day
become a thing of the past, there is
a consensus among even the most
confirmed techno-converts that
technology will never replace the
benefits of human interaction in
teaching and learning.
"There's nothing better than
sitting down face-to-face and dis
cussing things," said DiPaolo. "The
next best thing is technology."

not going away," she said. "More
people are coming into the li
brary."
According to Nagy, posting
Stanford's library card catalog
online and digitizing collections
of rare materials has piqued peo
ple's interest in the hard copies.
Although students and re
searchers can now access ab
stracts and catalog details online,
more people are actually coming
into libraries to find the materi
als, said Nagy.
"Those [resources] have pro
duced more requests for interli
brary loans," she said.
Technology and the future
For the time being at least, it
seems that new methods of teach
ing and learning will exist along
side more traditional methods of
education. While attending a real
university campus may one day
become a thing of the past, there is
a consensus among even the most
confirmed techno-converts that
technology will never replace the
benefits of human interaction in
teaching and learning.
"There's nothing better than
sitting down face-to-face and dis
cussing things," said DiPaolo. "The
next best thing is technology."
Imagine graduating from Stanford
without ever experiencing the palm
trees along Palm Drive. Imagine study
ing for four years without meeting a
professor or stepping inside a library.
Traditional notions of teaching and
learning are being turned on their heads
as the proliferation of new technology
transforms university learning from a
literal to a virtual experience.
"In the industrial age, we went to
school; in the information age, school
comes to us," said Andy DiPaolo, senior
associate dean of the School of Engi
neering and executive director of the
Stanford Center for Professional Devel
opment.
No longer bound by geographical lo
cation, students around the globe can
earn virtual degrees at online universi
ties without ever setting foot on a literal
campus. They can download books and
articles from the Internet 24 hours a
day without having to negotiate with
grouchy librarians or mastermind li
brary closing hours. With one flick of
the computer keyboard, they can share
philosophical ponderings with profes
sors th v have never met from the com
fort of ;ir own home.
But, s technology increasingly
transforn s the learning environment,
will students be adversely affected by
the lack of human interaction and the

shift away from more traditional learn
ing tools like books? Will university
campuses become increasingly desert
ed and will future generations of 18- to
23-year-olds be denied the rite of pas
sage typically enjoyed by college stu
dents?
Off-campus learning
For 28 years, Stanford's distance
learning program at the Stanford In
structional Television Network has
beamed Stanford classes to students
who may have never entered a Stanford
classroom. More than 3,500 graduate
students have already taken advantage
of Stanford's distance learning pro
grams, earning degrees in subjects
ranging from aeronautics to modern
languages.
Today, SITN offers more than 250
graduate-level courses and serves 187
companies at 250 different locations
around the world. Courses are trans
mitted by video to students in the com
fort of their own home or work place.
Study groups take place online.
DiPaolo maintains that students
taking the SITN courses do not neces
sarily miss out on the campus experi
ence just because they do not attend lec
tures. They can tune into Stanford lec
tures live and contact study group tu
tors by e-mail or in person as questions
arise.

New technology, such as these video units, have
influenced teaching and learning methods both in
and outside the classroom.
"Because it's an interactive
system, whatever is happening on
campus, they are experiencing it
too," said DiPaolo, who oversees
the SITN program. "With new
technology, it's a faster and much
richer experience."
Stanford was one of the first
universities in the country to set
up a distance learning program in
the late 19605, and the program
still acts as a model today, accord
ing to DiPaolo. By 1996, more
than half of all universities in the
country had caught onto the idea
and offered some kind of distance
learning program.
In order to keep Stanford at the
cutting edge of new technological
advances in the world of educa
tion, University President Ger
hard Casper set up a Commission
on Technology in Teaching and
Learning in October 1994.
"Technology may enhance in
come opportunities for the Univer
sity and potentially reduce the
costs of delivering education,"
reads the mission statement. "It
can allow Stanford to become a
truly world-wide institution of
learning, reachingout to new types
of students and embracing the con
cept of life-long learning through
new models of continuing educa
tion."
According to Chris Thomson,
managing director of the commis
sion, distance learning programs
can provide a two-way exchange

between industry and academia
that is mutually beneficial.
SITN's engineering program is
a case in point. Research engi
neers at Stanford keep abreast of
technological advances in Silicon
Valley as practicing scientists par
ticipate in Stanford's degree pro
grams.
Stanford's distance learning
program is also lucrative, charg
ing 40 percent more than the nor
mal Stanford tuition fees.
Despite the potential for en
hancing income opportunities for
Stanford, the focus of the Com
mission on Technology in Teach
ing and Learning is to improve
teaching at Stanford itself, rather
than extending its reputation to
the outside world, according to
Thomsen.
"It may be appropriate for
Stanford to provide extension
learning," he said, "but in general
it might not be the best use of re
sources for Stanford to excel."
Learning online
Thomsen was cautious about
Stanford's involvement with the
California Virtual University,
which Gov. Pete Wilson initiated
last year after declining to join
with other Western states in an
other online enterprise — the
Western Governor's University.
Two members of Stanford's
Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning are also
on the planning board of Califor
nia Virtual University. When the
project goes online, Stanford will
work together with other West
coast universities, such as

UCLA, to offer courses and pro
grams via the Internet. But stu
dents will still have to apply to
Stanford via traditional chan
nels. It will therefore be difficult
to enroll a parrot at California's
virtual university, as happened
recently at another online insti
tution.
According to Thomsen, online
teaching methods are far better
suited to more applied, "utilitari
an" skills, such as accounting and
marketing, than to areas of acade
mic research where Stanford is
traditionally stronger.
"There is not a great deal of
value added by Stanford re
search" to subjects like account
ing or marketing, said Thomsen.
"It's not something that Stanford
excels in."
Virtual isolation?
Some have argued that the lack
of human interaction fostered by
distance learning is detrimental
to the educational experience.
"Distance learning, as televi
sion before it, is likely to increase
social isolation," said Casper in
his 1995 address to the American
Educational Research Associa
tion, "though the electronic pen
pals from the Internet may offer
some, if only 'virtual,' protection
against such isolation."
While online communication is
less personal than face-to-face in
teraction, most professors main
tain that e-mails have increased
the amount of contact they have
with students, particularly with
shy students who may have hesi
tated to contact them personally.

Internet interaction
Since the advent of the Inter
net, e-mail communication has
become an essential part of the
educational experience for both
faculty and students. At Stan
ford, an average of 158,000 e
mails are generated by the 30,000
faculty, staff and students every
day on the Leland server alone,
according the statistics generated
by Stanford's Distributed Com
puting Communication Systems.
This works out at an average of 50
messages per person per day.
It is difficult to imagine life
without an e-mail account at
Stanford, although some stu
dents have refused to give in to
the demands of new technology.
Eliel Swinton, a senior who
played on the Stanford football
team, is about to graduate from
Stanford. He holds the rare dis
tinction of surviving an entire ca
reer at Stanford without opening
an e-mail account.
"I felt like I didn't need it,"
said Swinton. "I felt like it was
just jibber-jabber. People send
messages about nothing. You
might as well pick up the phone."
Swinton does not feel as if he
missed out on any information by
opting out of the e-mail loop.
"Professors say they've sent
an e-mail, but they always repeat
the information in class anyway,"
he said.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said that the invention of e
mail is a curse, but an efficient
curse.
"I spend up to two hours a day

answering e-mail from students at
Stanford and from around entire
world, including high school stu
dents who view my video series,"
he said. And while more students
contact Zimbardo now than in the
past, particularly shy students,
they miss out on a lot of his non
verbal hugs because they never
come to see him personally, he
said.
Former University President
Don Kennedy agreed that e-mail
is no substitute for seeing stu
dents face-to-face.
"E-mail has been an addition
for most people under most cir
cumstances," he said, "lit] should
not be the end of the line."
In the same way, Kennedy said
that the Internet has provided a
vast resource to students and fac
ulty alike.
"Students who approach it in
telligently can be much more pro
ductive," he said. "But it's an in
ternational flea market. We have
to learn what can be taken with a
grain of salt and what can be
taken with a salt shaker."
Librarian Steve Gass, who is
head of the Science and Engineer
ing Resource Group, said the
World Wide Web has become "the
vtlOO" of our generation.
"With the Web, we're begin
ning to see the creation of 'knowl
edge environments,' " he said.
"Basically, technology has begun
to allow us to realize the promise
of delivering actual resources di
rectly to the user's desktop."
But for Gass, the greatest chal
lenge for libraries in the face of
the information revolution is in

tegrating traditional library
methods with new technology
while keeping library users
happy.
"We're stuck in a 'both end'
problem," he said. "It's not like
all of a sudden we can stop doing
the old stuff for the new."
Deputy University Librarian
Karen Nagy agreed. "Books are
not going away," she said. "More
people are coming into the li
brary."
