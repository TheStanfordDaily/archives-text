# UC-Davis too much for Card
## Lacrosse splits weekend pair 
### Allison Hays 
The Stanford women's
lacrosse team (6-7, 4-1 Western
Women's Lacrosse League)
emerged from this weekend's
contests at Maloney Field with a
1-1 split, first losing to UC-Davis
and then battling UC-Santa
Cruz.
The squad suffered a particu
larly disappointing 12-6 loss to
Davis after a brutal spring break
lineup featuring competition
against a number of tough
teams. The Aggies burst out of
the gate, scoring four goals
almost immediately, and Stan
ford was unable to recover quick
ly enough, letting several key
offensive opportunities slide.
The Cardinal found itself

unable to perform well in the
later parts of the game as well.
One of the main problems for
Stanford was the inconsistencies
in its game.
"We need to learn how to
focus our intensity for the entire
game, not just showing flashes of
our potential as players and a
team," said freshman attack
Hedy Born.
Born played a critical role in
the team's offense with two
goals and one assist. The defen
sive effort was led by fellow
freshman point Christina
Cilyutin and senior goalie Susan
Fan, who recorded 13 saves
against the aggressive Aggie
offense.
"We played great lacrosse dur
ing the first 30 minutes of play

and were only down by two goals
at the half, and then we let it. slip
away," said assistant coach I leidi
Connor. "I don't think that
Davis was necessarily the better
team, but they did outplay us on
Saturday."
Freshman attack Kathryn
Jones said problems during the
game included trouble with pass
ing and poor shot selection. The
team's next chance to challenge
Davis will most likely be in the
postseason.
To supporters of the program,
it's a pleasant surprise that the
women's lacrosse team finds itself
with the opportunity to play this
season. The Cardinal has survived
what can be deemed as recon-
structive surgery in the.last few
years. It was one of the first
women's lacrosse teams to turn
varsity on the West Coast in a
growing effort to establish
lacrosse in the region. But frustra
tion and conflicts due to alleged
mismanagement of the team led
15 players to quit last season.
This year represents a
rebuilding for the team, which
consists of many inexperienced,
but gifted players. The current
roster of athletes, featuring 13
freshmen, remains optimistic
about the team's potential. Stan
ford, Davis and California are
the top three teams in the North
ern Division of the WWLL, and
the Cardinal should enter the
playoffs at the end of the month
as one of the top seeds.

Stanford was able to rebound
from its loss to Davis and gain a
measure of confidence by
trouncing Santa Cruz Sunday
18-2.
After the Banana Slugs took
the early lead on a quick score,
the Cardinal managed to main
tain composure and outperform
the relatively weak team.
Once again, the defense was
stingy, highlighted by the solid
play of Fan. The arsenal of
aggressive scoring throughout
the game was led by three goals
from freshman Danielle Lurie,
who was making her varsity
debut. Fellow freshman Merete
Rietveld also contributed to
Stanford's domination with two
goals, two assists, five ground
balls and eight draw controls.
The team travels to St. Mary's
for a matchup against the Gaels
today and plays in the Western
States Tournament, which it is
favored to win, this weekend.
