In last weekend's NCAA West Regional, the senior Ail-
American gymnast made his first appearance in the all
around competition since Feb. 22 and put up scores of 9.7
and 9.625 on the floor and vault, respectively. Defying
odds and the advice of doctors, Ellis made an impressive
showing and inspired his teammates to work through
their own injuries as he and his teammates advanced to
the NCAA chamionship in lowa April 17-19.

The sophomore won the bronze in the till-around cate
gory at the NCAA West Regional last Saturday. In co-cap
tain Keri Monahan's absence, Fitzpatrick led the Cardi
nal squad through the rigorous competition, scoring a 9.8
on the opening bars event, a 9.875 on tho beam, a 9.75 on
the vault and a 9.7 on the floor. Together with freshman
teammate Larissa Fontaine, Fitzpatrick will represent
the Card at the NCAA championship next week in
Tampa, Fla.
