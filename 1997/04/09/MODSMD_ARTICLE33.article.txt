# The 						great outdoors

I/m the kind of girl-girl who
takes cart; of her nails, per
fumes her body and never,
ever goes a day without washing
her hair. So when my friend Chen
invited me to go on a three-day
canoeing trip down the Colorado
River, I had no idea what I was in
for.
When Chen said "camping," I
envisioned paddling down grand,

burnt-red canyons all day long.
When the Nevada sun went down,
there'd Ik; a four-star cabin with a
24-hour Denny's waiting for us in
the backdrop.
As I naively packed rny satsuma
bubble bath and loofah the morn
ing we left, rny friend called to
remind me to bring a sleeping bag
and toilet paper.
"By the way, don't expect to
take a shower or see a bathroom
for three days," he said.
Gasp.
I wasn't prepared for an out
doors trip then, but now I wouldn't
trade the experience for all the
Motel 6's in the world.
The first night we slept under a
blanket of stars at a campsite near
Hoover Dam after a 10-hour drive
from Palo Alto. It wasn't terribly
romantic. The full moon, though
thousands of miles away, shone
down on our faces as bright as sus
pects under duress. The rocky
gravel turned us into cripples the
next morning.
That didn't thwart my excite

merit to Htart canoeing though. We
launched from the Hoover Darn
and 00 yards later found a sauna
cave.
It was a marvel.
We played a cold-hot game
where we'd jump into the ice-cold
river, shiver and freeze. Then we'd
rush into the end of the pitch-dark
sauna cave, sweat and suffocate.
It was pretty fun until I started
worrying that an edematous bac
terium entered through my nose
and would soon rupture my brain
at any moment. The owner of the
canoes had warned that the natu
ral springs at Black Canyon were
known to carry some deathly bac
teria that traveled only through
your nasal cavity.
After a couple of the nine mod
students I was with tried to reas
sure me that I wasn't going to
spontaneously combust, we clam
bered back into our boats and
sailed off to our first campsite.
After setting up camp near
some unrelenting gravel, we
explored the canyons for natural
hot springs. We weren't disap
pointed, finding one that chan
neled from a cave.
The following morning, I rolled
out of my rocky sleeping bag and to
my dread resized I had to go. The
previous night's dinner of fiber
inducing cabbage forced me to per
form necessary but ungirlish
duties.
I climbed up some rocky cliffs in
search of a spot 100 yards from civ
ilization. A gecko skittering nearby
made me nervous as I dug a hole,
entertaining neurotic fears of
being airlifted out of the canyon
because of a gecko rabies bite on
my ass.
Afterwards I took a sulfur mud
bath that soothed my trauma. I
was tempted to wash my hair,


Yi-Wyn
Yen
which had turned into an oil slick
by then. Even though we had envi
ronmentally safe liquid soap, I was
scared that I'd piss off Sierra Club
activists. Besides, not washing my
hair was a sign that I was embrac
ing nature.
We packed up our things and

headed down the river again. We
caught sight of a 15-foot cliff jut
tiny into the river that cried out,
"Jump off me!"
I was too much of a chicken to
jump, but some of the others
weren't and said it was a rush.
We spent the rest of our day
canoeing in search of more natural
hot springs. There was an especial
ly relaxing hot spring at our second
campsite. The spring boasted a
small waterfall and was divided

into two huge pools that were large
enough to swim in.
The perfect day ended with a
sky so clear that we could see all
the major constellations twinkling
and Comet Hale-Bopp streaking
by. The last morning, we left our
beloved campsite and set off for
the final stretch. We raced and
made a pitiful attempt to swim
upstream.
When we had tired out, we tied
our boats together for a river pow

wow. As we floated downstream,
we saw a 35-foot tower that said
"Danger — Off Limits." None of us
were insane enough to jump off it.
Except Winnick, that is.
By the time we pulled up to
our final destination, I had dirt in
my nails, rock scrapes on my
body and was in desperate need
of a shower, but I didn't care. My
first camping / canoeing experi
ence was a blast, and I didn't
want the trip to end.
