More national accolades were
heaped upon Stanford as four
undergraduates received the
prestigious Barry M. Goldwater
Scholarship.
The Goldwater Foundation
named Felix Feng and Michele
Ilwu, both juniors majoring in bi
ology; sophomore Peter Kasson,
also a biology major, and De
bleena Sengupta, a sophomore
majoring in chemistry, as recipi
ents of the prize.
The award is presented annu
ally to outstanding sophomores
and juniors intending to pursue
careers in mathematics, the nat
ural sciences or engineering. The
scholarship provides juniors
with $7,500 for one year of un
dergraduate study and sopho
mores with $ If), 000 over two
years.
Colleges and universities na
tionwide each nominate four
candidates for the honor, leading
to a total of 1,164 nominees. This
year, all four of Stanford's candi
dates were among the 282 win
ners selected from the pool.
Applicants underwent an ex
tensive application process that
required them to submit an essay
describing a research problem of
particular personal interest,
three letters of recommendation
and a transcript.
The Goldwater Foundation
primarily "looked for people who
had a genuine interest in re
search," said Brian Kobilka, as
sociate professor of medicine and
molecular and cellular physiolo
gy. He is also Feng's research
mentor.
Feng has conducted research
on the adrenergic receptor for
adrenaline in Kobilka's lab since

the summer after his senior year
of high school.
"Felix started out knowing
nothing," said Kobilka, but "he
got along well with people and
consequently, he picked up what
other people had to teach him."
Asst. Biology Prof. Tim
Stearns, Feng's major adviser,
said Feng's most impressive trait
is his determination. "It is very
hard to be doing undergraduate
research while doing well in
classes," he added.
Like Feng, Kasson also devel
oped a passion for research in
high school. At Stanford, he be
came intrigued by Chemistry
Prof. Harden McConnell's re
search in immunology and began
working in his lab.
His participation in numerous
research competitions prepared
Kasson for the Goldwater schol
arship's application process. "If
you do a lot of these, you get bet
ter at writing the strange things
they ask you to write about," he
said.
He had met Sengupta, anoth
er of the award recipients, at sev
eral of these high school contests.
Sengupta has conducted re
search since her junior year in
high school. A transfer student to
Stanford from New York Univer
sity, she performs research with
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer
on the human muscle protein
myoglobin.
After learning about the
award program, she "took a
chance and just applied," she
said, but only after "working re
ally hard on the application."
The Goldwater Foundation is
a federally endowed agency that
was established in November
1986 to honor former Sen. Barry
M. Goldwater.
