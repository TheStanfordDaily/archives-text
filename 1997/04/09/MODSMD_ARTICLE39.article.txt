# Two women receive obscene phone calls
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
A man posing as a researcher for a major uni
versity has harassed two Stanford women in the
past week with obscene telephone calls, accord
ing to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
But it's not Oscar.
The caller allegedly said he was conducting a
survey for Texas A & M University. Both victims
described the caller as a male with a Southern or
Texan accent.
"We've had survey takers in the past,"
Niemeyer said. "He does give a name like it's
legit, but [the victims] don't remember the
name."
The first woman received a call from the al
leged surveyor on April 1 at 8:15 p.m. The sec
ond woman received a call on April 6 at 9:05
p.m.
"He asked them to put themselves in a
peaceful place," Niemeyer said. The surveyor

then allegedly told them to think about their
boyfriends. The caller began to say obscene
things, at which time both women hung up.
"It sounds like he's just trying to get sexual
gratification," Niemeyer said. "This is definitely
a new character. The so-called 'Oscar' charac
ters usually call late at night."
An obscene call received on April 4 at 10:20
p.m. resembled the pattern of Oscar, who has
been harassing people at Stanford since April
1995. After telling the woman thai, he had seen
her around and knew who she was, the caller
identified himself as Oscar and implied that he
was masturbating.
In a separate incident, freshman Laurie Wil
son received an obscene telephone call on April 6
at about 6 a.m.
"I talked to the person for five minutes. I
thought it was someone I knew," Wilson said,
"which is really bad."
Wilson said that she hung up the phone when
the caller started saying "obscene things."

Wilson said she has received similar calls this
year.
"I think it's the same person as last quarter,"
she said.
In addition to the Texas A & M surveyor
and Oscar, Niemeyer said there has been a
number of obscene calls that don't match ei
ther of the callers' profiles. Despite two seem
ingly isolated obscene calls reported within
the past two weeks, Niemeyer said the num
ber of recent calls is not above average for this
time of year.
Niemeyer recommended that students re
move their names from their answering ma
chine messages to avoid being harassed. Ac
cording to Niemeyer, obscene callers like Oscar
often call earlier in the day, when students are
in class, to check the name on the answering
machine. He will call that residence later in the
evening, asking for the person by name.
"It's almost impossible to work these (cases)
because we can't trace the calls," Niemeyer said.
