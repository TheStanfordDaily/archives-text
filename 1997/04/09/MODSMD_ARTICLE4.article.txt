# Edmonds to step down as vice provost
## Current Dean of Admissions Montoya will take her place 
### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds will step down
in June after heading the office for five
years.
James Montoya, dean of admissions
and financial aid, will succeed her in

this post.
Edmonds came to the University on
a five-year contract in the spring of
1992 from Bowling Green State Uni
versity in Ohio, where she was vice
president for student affairs.
"Senior administrators resign their
positions when they reach the age of
65," Edmonds said, "so I knew that I

would be in the position just for five
years."
This knowledge proved to be a moti
vating force during her time in student
affairs. "I didn't have the opportunity
to procrastinate," she said. "It focuses
you more when you know you have a
frame of time to get things accom
plished in."

Provost Condoleezza Rice recog
nized this focus. "It's rare that some
body can come in wit h a set of goals and
actually achieve them," Rice said. Ed
monds "can say that she did. She's
done a wonderful job."
Though leaving her post, Edmonds
will still be a part of the Stanford
community and will be available to
students for at least another year.
Rice has asked Edmonds to direct
a self-study of the Athletics De
partment for NCAA certification.
Edmonds also plans to conduct re
search in social gerontology dur
ing her stay, and she may teach
some more courses.
"I'm glad that I won't be leav
ing immediately," Edmonds said.
However, she admitted that she
"doesn't have a clue" as to what
she will do after leaving Stanford.
"I would like to finish a book I
started writing a long time ago,"
she said. "I'm scouting the oppor

tunities."
The Office of Student Affairs,
according to Edmonds, "essential
ly provides all out-of-classroom
services and amenities." Under
her direction, many "first-rate"
senior staff members — including
Registrar Roger Printup, Residen
tial Education Director Jane Ca
marillo and Dean of Students
Marc Wais — were hired. She also
initiated the task forces on Greek
life and alcohol.
"We are listening to students
more," Edmonds said. "Once we
have the reports in on the task
forces, we will have brought clarity
around the policies and procedures
so students can be informed."
After steering the admissions
process for more than five years,
Montoya looks forward to filling
his new position.

Chosen as Vice Provost for
Student Affairs in 1992, Mary
Edmonds has spent her career
at Stanford working with
students and other
administrators on problems
ranging from dealing with
student reaction to the
Rodney King verdict to easing
the burden of University
budget cuts on Student
Affairs.
Before she came to Stanford,
Edmonds served as vice
president at Bowling Green
University in Ohio for nine
years. She also chaired the
Health Services Department at
Cleveland State University
from 1976 to 1981.

"This is a wonderful opportuni
ty for me to contribute to the Uni
versity on a broader level," he said.
"One of the great joys of assuming
my new responsibilities will be to
work more closely with the under
graduates I have admitted to the
University."
Among other things, Montoya
introduced the Early Decision,
President's Scholars and Admit
Weekend programs to the Univer
sity's admissions process. A new
technical support system in the Fi
nancial Aids Office was also imple
mented under his leadership.
This was a "period of real
change" in the two offices, he said.
Edmonds said she believed
Montoya's promotion was the
"most wonderful and appropriate
decision that could be made.

When James Montoya was
chosen as Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid in 1991, he
had large shoes to fill, those of
Jean Fetter, who went on to
serve as assistant to President
Gerhard Casper.
He has filled those shoes
well, however, and has gone
on to be promoted to Vice
Provost for Student Affairs.
During his stint as dean of
admissions, Montoya has read
more than 89,530
undergraduate applications.
"I very much welcome the
challenge and excitement of
the vice provost position,"
Montoya said.

"In fact, I suggested it," she
added.
The search for a new dean of ad
missions and financial aid, howev
er, may not be as easy.
"That's going to be tough,"
Rice said. "We were very fortunate
that the right person was here to
succeed Mary. Finding someone to
replace Jim will be difficult."
A national search will be con
ducted through the Provost's Of
fice; Rice hopes a new dean will be
in place by the fall,
Members of Edmonds' office
said they will miss her when she
leaves. "She's a very warm-heart
ed person. . . . She's very fair,"
said Nadine O'Leary, executive
secretary to the vice provost. "I re
spect her leadership, and I know
that students just adore her."
