## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Israeli scholar and professor Dafna Sharf
man spoke on the current state of human
rights in Israel yesterday afternoon, address
ing issues including the reasons behind Israel
not having a constitution, its absorption of
mass immigration in the 1950s and the Israeli
Supreme Court's role as the "guardian of
human rights."
Despite tense political situations surround
ing Israel, Sharfman said the nation has done
an admirable job in maintaining human rights
standards.
"The most important thing we're trying to
do is preserve our democratic and human
rights ideals, even in difficult situations, such

as wars," Sharfman said in an interview after
the speech. "Most countries don't do this."
Despite the need for a consistent respect for
human rights, Sharfman said she thinks it is
"very difficult sometimes to maintain a high
degree of human rights, but we must always
succeed at this."
Sharfman says enemies of Israel, such as
the militant Islamic group Hamas, have "very
little consideration for human rights — even
for their own people.
"Regimes like [Hamas] are the kinds no one
would like to meet in a dark alley," Sharfman
said.
In addition to her research on human
rights, Sharfman, a professor at Western
Galilee College in Israel, has also studied
women's issues extensively. She regards

women's rights as a subsection of human
rights.
"Our goal is to promote rights of all kinds of
women — Arab, European descent, Russian
immigrants," Sharfman said.
She went on to compare Israeli society to
that of the United States.
"In a heterogeneous society, women's
rights are not subject to cultural differences,"
Sharfman said.
Furthermore, a push for affirmative action
is evident in the recent pieces of Israeli legisla
tion, Sharfman said. For example, women are
now given extra consideration when being
nominated to serve on boards of directors.
Sharfman's speech at Stanford is part of a
series of lectures she will be delivering around
the country in the next two weeks.
