Loose Nukes:
Security Issues on the
U.S.-Russian Agenda
Thursday, April 10,1997
5:00 - 6:30 p.m.
Oak Lounge, Tresidder Union
Stanford University
Russia is undergoing "a time of troubles" as severe as any in her history. The
government is in disarray, workers and the Army go unpaid for months at a time, and
the resources needed for protection and control of nuclear weapons are in short supply.
Ultimately Russia will recover but her present ability to function effectively within the
international community is limited. How can the United States and Russia work together
to better control nuclear weapons, prevent their appropriation by terrorists, and stop
global nuclear proliferation?
