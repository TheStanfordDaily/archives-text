# Helping EPA to help itself
## Business school project gives loans, tips to entrepreneurs 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
An innovative program launched by students at the
Graduate School of Business is helping train entrepre
neurs and revive the business community in East Palo
Alto.
The program, called Start Up, is a partnership of the
Business School, Silicon Valley's private sector and com
munity organizations in East Palo Alto.
The program provides entrepreneurs from in and
around East Palo Alto with in-class training, loan funds
and technical assistance.
Would-be entrepreneurs come to the program with
an idea for a business they want to develop. They attend
a four-week course designed to assess the feasibility of
their ideas. About half continue on to an eight-week
course in which they learn about cash flow management,
customer service, marketing and other issues.
Participants also develop more detailed business
plans and apply for funding. Out of about 18 loans made
to date, there have only been two or three defaults, said
Mike Zimmerman, one of Start Up's founders and the
current chairman of its board of directors.
Using their loans, entrepreneurs have launched a va
riety of businesses including a landscaping service, a
record label, an Internet service provider and a 3-D chess
company.
The program was the product of several different
strands coming together, said Jim Thompson, director of
the Business School's Public and Global Management
Program and a member of Start Up's board.
Each year the Business School undertakes a public
management initiative, Thompson explained. In 1994
the focus was urban development.
There were some students with a deep interest in the
subject, he added. Under the supervision of Political Sci
ence and Business Prof. David Brady, several of them
undertook an independent study project.
They did a thorough survey of best practices for eco
nomic development, Thompson said. One student went
to South America to study lending issues. Using what
they had learned from their research, the students began
Start Up.
Zimmerman said that he and other students wanted
to see how they could apply their skills to helping East
Palo Alto. "We wanted to really try to do something that
had a longer-term impact," he added.
According to second-year business student and board
member John Mark Rodgere, about 30 or 40 Business
School students currently participate in Start Up.
Economic development is interesting to many stu
dents who would like to combine business skills and com
munity service, Thompson explained. "There's a lot of
interest in helping disenfranchised people.
"Start Up provides a framework in which students
here can contribute and be valuable to the business com
munity in East Palo Alto," Thompson said.
Business School students reap other benefits from in
volvement as well, several of them pointed out.
"For one thing, it's a nice way to
be connected to the community out
side the Business School and Stan
ford," Rodgers said.
"It's pretty enjoyable to hear
about business plans, the ideas (the
entrepreneurs) have," he added.
It is also an opportunity to take
theory and test its practicality,
Zimmerman said. "Some of the ba
sics [of business] are very, very
helpful."
Students can help entrepreneurs
deal wit h marketing, inventory and
pricing, among other concerns, they
both said.
Of course, there are significant
differences in age, cultural back
ground and socio-economic status
between the students and the entre
preneurs they arc helping, Rodgers
admitted.
He said the key to overcoming
these potential barriers is to be a
good listener and not believe that
one has all the answers. "Most of
the entrepreneurs appreciate an
other set of eyes and ears," he said.

Start Up aspires to become a pro
totype for efforts throughout the
country, "but we sort of want to per
fect the model here," Zimmerman
said.
There are several enhancements
planned to the program. Start Up
hopes to have an alumni network
for the about 100 graduates of the
12-week program running in about
six months. "People need continu
ous support," Zimmerman empha
sized.
Start Up will introduce a Span
ish language class this fall. "The
program's been heavily focused on
the African-American community
in East Palo Alto," Thompson said.
Yet 40 percent of East Palo Alto's
residents are and at least
some portion of this population
would be more comfortable learn
ing in Spanish, Zimmerman ex
plained.
Start Up also hopes to serve as a
complement to three major rede
velopment efforts going on in and
around East Palo Alto. "Lots of
community organizations are try
ing to work together to make sure
East Palo Alto participates in the
redevelopment," Zimmerman
said.
