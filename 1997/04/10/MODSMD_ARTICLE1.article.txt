## Business school project gives loans, tips to entrepreneurs

An innovative program launched by students at the
Graduate School of Business is helping train entrepre
neurs and revive the business community in East Palo
Alto.
The program, called Start Up, is a partnership of the
Business School, Silicon Valley's private sector and com
munity organizations in East Palo Alto.
The program provides entrepreneurs from in and
around East Palo Alto with in-class training, loan funds
and technical assistance.
Would-be entrepreneurs come to the program with
an idea for a business they want to develop. They attend
a four-week course designed to assess the feasibility of
their ideas. About half continue on to an eight-week
course in which they learn about cash flow management,
customer service, marketing and other issues.
Participants also develop more detailed business
plans and apply for funding. Out of about 18 loans made
to date, there have only been two or three defaults, said
Mike Zimmerman, one of Start Up's founders and the
current chairman of its board of directors.
Using their loans, entrepreneurs have launched a va
riety of businesses including a landscaping service, a
record label, an Internet service provider and a 3-D chess
company.
The program was the product of several different
strands coming together, said Jim Thompson, director of
the Business School's Public and Global Management
Program and a member of Start Up's board.
Each year the Business School undertakes a public
management initiative, Thompson explained. In 1994
the focus was urban development.
There were some students with a deep interest in the
subject, he added. Under the supervision of Political Sci
ence and Business Prof. David Brady, several of them
undertook an independent study project.
They did a thorough survey of best practices for eco
nomic development, Thompson said. One student went
to South America to study lending issues. Using what
they had learned from their research, the students began
Start Up.
Zimmerman said that he and other students wanted
to see how they could apply their skills to helping East
Palo Alto. "We wanted to really try to do something that
had a longer-term impact," he added.
According to second-year business student and board
member John Mark Rodgere, about 30 or 40 Business
School students currently participate in Start Up.
Economic development is interesting to many stu
dents who would like to combine business skills and com
munity service, Thompson explained. "There's a lot of
interest in helping disenfranchised people.
"Start Up provides a framework in which students
here can contribute and be valuable to the business com
munity in East Palo Alto," Thompson said.
Business School students reap other benefits from in
volvement as well, several of them pointed out.
