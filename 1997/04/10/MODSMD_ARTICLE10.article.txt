Air Force unveils $71 million fighter
MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) — The Air Force and Lockheed-Martin
rolled out the first F-22 fighter jet yesterday in an upbeat ceremony
that temporarily masked concern over the post-Cold War era of lean
defense budgets.
Dubbed "Raptor 01, the Spirit of America,"the sleek white air
craft was unveiled in a Lockheed hangar packed with politicians, Air
Force officers and aerospace executives who battled to outdo each
other with praise.
Critics of the F-22 said it's designed to counter a threat that
doesn't yet exist and at $71 million each costs far more than the
nation can afford.
Gen. Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force chief of staff, said the plane
will more than pay for itself by providing American fighting forces
with air dominance in future wars and saving the lives of soldiers.
Designed as the successor to the Air Force F-15 fighter, the F-22

would be the first high-performance fighter built to all but disappear
from enemy radars.
