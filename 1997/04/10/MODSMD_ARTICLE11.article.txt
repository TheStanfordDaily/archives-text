The Galileo spacecraft has cap
tured images of iceberg-like
structures and smooth white
patches on Jupiter's moon
Europa, providing the strongest
evidence yet that an ocean — and
perhaps life — lie beneath its
frozen surface.
"It looks as though we found
the smoking gun that points at
this sub-surface ocean," said
Michael Carr, a geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo
Park.
The pictures, taken by the

unmanned Galileo spacecraft
during a Feb. 20 flyby and
released yesterday at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, are the
most detailed images Galileo has
ever made of Europa.
The pictures of icy chunks
scattered like pottery shards pro
vide "the clearest evidence to date
there is liquid water and melting
close to the surface of Europa,"
said Torrence Johnson, the
Galileo project scientist at JPL.
Hut, Johnson cautioned, "we
have no evidence directly bearing
on life."
