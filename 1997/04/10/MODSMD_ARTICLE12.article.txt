Educating about people's
differences can help to
avoid future hate crimes

IN THE LAST week, Stanford
has been hit with two as-yet
unconnected acts of anti-gay
vandalism. Thursday, a doctoral
student approached her car in the
Rains parking lot to discover that
a gay-pride bumper sticker had
been defaced. Monday, a cook in
The Bollard eating club arrived at
work to find the club had been cov
ered in anti-gay graffiti.
The word "fag" had been writ
ten on the rainbow-flag bumper
sticker; slurs including "Gays
should kill themselves" and "Fag
gots are the downfall of the U.S."
were scrawled on the eating club's
walls and tables.
These and other acts of hate are,
simply, unwelcome on this campus
— as they should be unwelcome in
all corners of society. They are the
work of uneducated and uncivi
lized people, and one would cer
tainly like to believe that no mem
bers of the Stanford community
fall into those categories. Appar
ently, however, some do.
Stanford is no stranger to hate
crime. In recent years, this cam
pus has been victimized by various
malicious acts directed against one
group of people or another. The
campus has witnessed everything
from racism to homophobia, and it
is unfortunate when any part of
our community is a target of hate.
Last quarter, a Mirrielees resi
dent witnessed a man trying to
remove a "gay pride" Hag and a
Mexican flag from another resi
dent's door. Upon seeing the resi
dent, the man allegedly shouted,
"Fuck fags, fuck you." And cer
tainly the campus cannot forget
the 1994 vandalism of the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture near the
quad. Though eight students were
accused of committing the vandal

ism, they were charged only with
destruction of property as Califor
nia law at the time stipulated that
a hate crime could only be commit
ted against another person.
Many on this campus are not
particularly concerned by these
latest attacks simply because they
directly affect only a small num
ber of us. But it is important for
everyone on campus to recognize
these were not isolated occur
rence. It's likely that many have
been victimized in one way or
another but simply have opted not
to make their experiences public.
These most recent attacks should
not be treated as isolated inci
dents but rather as a symptom of
a larger problem which plagues
our community.
If any good can come from these
unpleasant occurrences, it is that
they can be a catalyst for action.
Although student-affairs adminis
trators responded to the Suites
incident promptly and promised
swift and harsh punishment for
those involved, more must be done.
If members of our community
have not yet learned that acts of
hate are not acceptable expres
sions of behavior, then dialogues
should be established to explore
issues of prejudice and hate. And
responsibility for this discussion
does not lie solely with the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center, even though the center
has taken the lead thus far.
Because this is a community afflic
tion, a range of Student Affairs
offices — Residential Education,
most clearly — should share
responsibility for a sustained dis
cussion and education process.
If the ignorance that has led to
these two recent attacks contin
ues, the implications of this preju
dice will have the potential to
become more violent and severe.
It is about time that Res Ed
embrace this topic as one that is as
important to the Stanford commu
nity as orienting new freshmen. It
should be addressed immediately
and with appropriate significance.
