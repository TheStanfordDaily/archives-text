WHEN PEOPLE HACK home
find out I go to Stanford their
initial response is usually, "Oh,
is that in Connecticut?" After a few
lessons in geography and slowly enunci
ating StaNNNNNford, they realize their
mistake and follow their initial response
with, "Aren't you afraid of earth
quakes?" As if any person looks forward
to a natural disaster.
When people at Stanford find out I'm
from New York their first response is usu
ally, "Oh, New York City?" After a brief
lecture explaining that New York is a large
state composed of many areas other than
Manhattan and that while I may visit that
city often I am actually from a small sub
urb on Long Island, they take a breath and
ask, "Aren't you afraid of getting
mugged?" As if people look forward to
being robbed, beaten up and left for dead.
Clearly, ignorance is not isolated to
either coast. i«. * *
Like an American in Paris, a New York
er at Stanford can be seen as foreign, crude
and disdainful — someone who just
doesn't seem to belong. But, truth be told,
ignorance is just one of the many things in
common between New York (the city, not
the state) and our university. I offer you
the following pseudo-sociological study:
Traffic
Rush! Rush! Rush! Everyone's always
in a rush. For work. For class. For lunch.
For sex (more likely in Times Square
than White Plaza). For every fender-ben

der in New York there are five near-colli
sions between the Quad and Annenberg
Auditorium. The result is either a
lengthy delay or an even lengthier apolo
gy. Cross your fingers and hope there's
no lengthy litigation.
Parking
I am convinced the police have surveil
lance on every parking spot in every zone
both in New York and at Stanford. No
sooner have I pulled over to deliver a letter
or pick up an assignment than a yellow
ticket has been mashed between my wiper
and windshield. In New York, returns
from parking tickets are added on to the
city's fiscal budget. I wouldn't be surprised
if the Stanford returns are paying for every
cop's coffee and doughnuts for a year. And
that's from my parking tickets alone.
And have you tried finding a parking
space in downtown Manhattan or Palo
Alto on a Friday night? You could walk
from the Oval to Miyake on one leg and
you'd still be sitting at the sushi bar before
you could park your car.
Nightlife
Good parties are few and far between in
either locale. And just when you get a good
buzz going, the party-poopers arrive. A
Sigma Chi party break-up has its parallels
in the Limelight and Tunnel police busts in
New York. At Stanford it's minors in pos
session of alcohol, and in New York it's
anyone in possession of narcotics. The way
Stanford Police treat underage drinking,
one might swagger away with the impres

sion that a plastic cup of warm Budweiser
is just as bad as a line of blue-flake cocaine.
Coffee
Coffee is taken almost too seriously in
both regions. There are even coffee cults
that tend to hang out at the local coffee
house. You can usually spot them: They
are the ones smoking cigarettes outside,
usually in the freezing cold, sipping on
their vanilla lattes while taking drags on
a Dunhill or Camel Light. Also, there is
usually some music playing that you'd
rather not listen to.
Punks
The street toughs who skateboard and
roller-blade seem ever-present in both
locales. They hang out in groups, like
packs of wolves on the hunt for the best
hill or corner to ride around. As long as
you don't bother them, they won't bother
you. But tell them to find a job or get a life
and you may wake up in a gutter with
skid marks on your collar.
Weirdos
You know who you are. And if you
don't, believe me, someone else does.

Jordan Gelber, a senior majoring in
drama and communication, will be
attending graduate school in New York
City next fall. He hopes to find a Juice
Club equivalent and a cafe that can make
a California bowl there.
