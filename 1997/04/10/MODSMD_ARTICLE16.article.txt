Young was wrong to link abstinence to conservativism

Rahul young's Monday col
umn did something I think is very
dangerous. He attempts to link
sexual promiscuity with the Democratic
party's ideals of compassion and concern
for the poor.
1 agree with much of what he says
about conservative hypocrisy concerning
the poor. In addition, I also have some
disagreements with a few of our presi
dent's centrist posit ions. I am against
granting Most Favored Nation status to
China and I think that Clinton's signing
of the anti-gay marriage law was wrong.
However I would like to inform Young
that progressive ideals come from the
brain and not from below the waist.

What is his justification for sexual
promiscuity? Young states "most of our
parents didn't abstain" and that "90 per
cent of our generation does not." He for
gets the fine print: Our parents also have
<i historically high divorce rate, more than
50 percent, and All )S is the No. 1 killer of
men and women in our generation.
As chair of the Stanford Democrats
and the treasurer of True Love Waits, I
find it a bit ironic that Young would
pigeonhole me with people whom I
despise such as Robert Bork and Bill
Bennett. Young should know that one
doesn't need to be an "old man," imply
ing a lack or repression of sexual drive,
to be in favor of abstinence. One could be

20 years old, relatively unreligious and
politically liberal and still choose to
abstain from sex until marriage.
What's my justification? Divorce rates
among couples who chose to abstain are
much lower, while the sexual satisfac
tion among this group is also much high
er. In addition, the issue of dying from
AIDS becomes a moot point. Most
important, I respect women enough to
firmly believe that any woman who I
choose to have sex with should be good
enough to marry.
As a liberal, I don't want to mimic
religious demagogues such as Jerry Fal
well by stoting that AIDS is some kind of
punishment or that being poor is a pun

ishment for immorality. They clearly are
not. People have the right to make their
own sexual decisions, and this right
should not be infringed upon by the gov
ernment. However I don't think that
Clinton's authorization of abstinence
being taught as an option to teenagers
constitutes such an infringement.
In conclusion, Young and I should and
do have the freedom to make our own
sexual decisions. We can even belong to
the same liberal political party. I would
just hope that as a fellow Democrat,
Young would not label me as something
that I'm not.
