# Rachel Kolman Marshak: I'm a jelly doughnut
## Sibling rivalry can be supressed, but it never dies 
### 
C "T" M GOING TO go to Stanford," my
I brother told me.
"No!" I replied vehemently, sur
prising myself with the depth of my dis
pleasure. Don t come here. I thought
you liked Yale better. What about there?"
"They wait-listed me."
But Stanford isn't what you want.
I hey don t have the classes you want to
take."
"They have more than Amherst or
Swarthmore."
Have you looked at the course sched
ule?" I asked, fumbling for the Stanford
Bulletin. "See, they only have two
Roman history classes. You don't want to
come here."
Two weeks ago, my brother told me he
got into Stanford. Actually, my father told
me first, but I pretended to be surprised
when my brother told me. I was happy for
him. Not only is it good not to be rejected,
but he had been chosen as a President's

Scholar, and I was proud of him.
When I came home for spring break,
we had a long talk about colleges, but I
resisted influencing him any way,
remembering how much I hated my
mother's constant pep talk for Stanford
when I was a senior (which almost made
me want to go to Yale). But at that point,
I was pretty sure he was going to go to
Yale. I guess I should have made Stan
ford sound worse.
I didn't realize how much I didn't want
my brother to come to Stanford until it
became an almost-definite possibility.
It's not that I don't like my brother.
We get along as well as the average sib
lings, probably even better. But I don't
want him to come to Stanford. I want
him to find a life, one that isn't mine or
that has any part of me connected with it.
The first semester of my senior year
was the time that my brother and I were
the closest. He had just entered high

school, and I ei\joyed showing him the
ropes. We drove together to school and
were in many of same activities. I enjoyed
helping him.
But that soon turned into annoyance.
My brother seemed to be everywhere,
doing every activity with me. When I
went out with my friends, he wanted to
come too. I just wanted him to go away.
Imitation may be the highest form of
flattery, but too much imitation is suffo
cating.
Sure, Stanford is a lot larger than my
high school. He could live in Kimball and
I could live in Suites. I might not even see
him. But it's likely that he may do the
same activities as me or even be in a class
with me. And I'm sure he'll come over to
steal my car.
But the suffocating factor is only part
of the reason I don't want him to come to
Stanford. The more important reason is
that my brother and I tend to compete

with one another, and if he came to Stan
ford it would make the competition more
intense and thus more unpleasant.
We've always competed. When I was
kid, I walloped him at board games. Even
on subjects he knew a lot about, I tried to
minimize his advantage over me. I
learned enough presidents trivia to make
him stop quizzing me. I even made up
facts about Thomas Jefferson, his
favorite person in history, to dumbfound
him. We competed about everything,
including who got to talk first about their
day at dinner time. (Whoever talked first
stretched out the story so much that the
other never had a chance to say any
thing) Even after I left for college, we still
competed. He always got mad when I was
home for vacation and my parents paid
more attention to me than him.
The worst thing about our competi
tion is that I feel like I have to win all of
the time. After all, he's my stupid, puny

younger brother, and I should easily be
able to beat him. Hut of course, that's not
always possible (although it is most of
the time). With him at Stanford, the
comparisons will be easier to draw and
the competition that much more intense.
I think we would both be happier if he
went somewhere else.
So if you work for the Yale admis
sions office, or it you know someone who
does, please reconsider my brother and
accept him. He'd make a great addition
to the \ ale student body. He's a good
student and very involved in extracur
ricular activities.
But not as good as me.
