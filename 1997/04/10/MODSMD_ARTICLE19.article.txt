## Candidates promise no national campaigns, more attention to campus problems 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
The week-long campaign for ASSU presi
dent kicked off yesterday with a debate hosted
and broadcast by KZSU. The program fea
tured all three candidates, junior Emily An
drus and seniors Jim Finsten and Howard Loo.

But unlike the battles that
will be waged on kiosks, World
Wide Web sites and bathroom
stall walls, this opening salvo
provided discerning voters

with an opportunity to hear all three candi
dates together in the same forum.
The presidential hopefuls were invited to
offer 30-second opening statements. Andrus,
Finsten and Loo then responded to questions
from KZSU news reporters Thomas Soule and
Emily Richmond. Thirty-second closing state
ments from each candidate ended the half
hour program.
The earliest casualty of the evening was cur
rent ASSU President Bill Shen, whose nation
al campaigns were indirectly attacked by all
three students trying to succeed him.
"What is really important to me is that stu-

dents are represented and students are repre
sented well," Andrus said. "I don't have a po
litical agenda; I don't want to launch any huge
campaigns from this office."
Finsten added that student leaders "have
the power to persuade" the University admin
istration and "should not fight battles off cam
pus."
"The problem is that the ASSU executive
has focused on too many broad world issues,"
Loo said. "The ASSU president is uniquely po
sitioned to represent students before the ad
ministration."
After the pleasant introductions and agree
ment that all ASSU politics should be local, the
candidates attempted to outline their priori
ties.
Although Finsten told listeners in his open
ing statement that he and his running mate
Kelly Naylor were running on four issues, he
never clearly specified what those issues were.
Asked what she and running mate Ben
Decker would do with the $3,000 Shen spent
on his adhesive notepads, Andrus answered
with talk of leadership and representation and
finally settled on advancing a program to bring
back the Big Game Bonfire.

Finsten took a different tack on the same
question, attacking the money's allocation
and suggesting that the ASSU Office of the
President could function without that fund
ing-
"l think that the $3,000 on the Post-it notes
could have been better spent by any other or
ganization on campus. I'm not certain that
that money is necessary for the ASSU," Fin
sten said, adding that students face steeply in
creasing ASSU fees.
He stopped short, however, of advocating a
reduction in those fees.
Although Loo was generally direct on all
questions, he glossed over the details of his
"45-Day Plan," which would form the founda
tion of the early days of his administration.
The only specific element Loo addressed was
an online clearinghouse of campus events, a
place to which "every student can turn to find
out every event going on campus."
The other elements, he said, were being
added after he and running mate Solomon
Lefler spoke with dorm government presi
dents in the coming days. But with the election
only a week away, students are left with little
time to consider such a platform.
