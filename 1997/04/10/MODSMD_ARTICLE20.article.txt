## Kribel wins, team is fourth Golf team defeats regional opponents 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's golf team
helped solidify its regional stand
ing this week in Santa Cruz.
"There's been a noticeable
change in the team in terms of
work ethic since spring break,"
said senior Eri Crum. "Every
one's practicing harder now
because now our attitude when
we're out there is that we know
we have the ability to do well."
The Cardinal stood behind
those words Tuesday when it
brought home a fourth-place fin
ish from the Western Intercolle
giate Tournament at Pasa Tiem
po Golf Course.
The golf team's stellar perfor
mance was led by sophomore
Joel Kribel, who posted scores of
72, 66 and 71, respectively, to
win the tournament with a com
posite score of 7-under-par 209.
Senior Conrad Ray tied for 20th
place, while freshman Dusty
Brett tied for 22nd.
Collectively, Kribel, Ray,
Brett, sophomore Scott Wang
and freshman Tylar Lunke post
ed scores of 300, 290 and 300 for
each of the three rounds to end
with a final team score of 890.
"The highlight of the tourna
ment was definitely seeing Joel
win and also beating out so many
teams from our region," Lunke
said of his first varsity tourna
ment.
This tournament win for Kri
bel was his second of the season
and third in his career and will
help move him one step closer to
qualifying for first-team All-
America honors at the end of the
season.
The team's key victories over
regional teams will also help
improve its position entering the
U.S. Intercollegiate at the Stan
ford Golf Course later this
month, the final determinant of
regional standing. The schools
finishing behind Stanford were
San Jose State, Long Beach
State, UC-Irvine, UC-Santa Bar

bara, Pacific and Washington.
These defeats will help move the
Card into a better position to
qualify for the regional tourna
ment.
In fact, the only Western
Regional team finishing higher
than Stanford was California,
which placed second.
Despite the team's success,
there were several areas in which
to improve. "Everybody threw a
few shots away here and there —
the course was tough." Kribel said.

There's been a
noticeable change in
the team in terms of
work ethic since
spring break.'

"You're never completely satis
fied, though. There's always
something you could have done
better."
Lunke also commented on the
course and its difficulty.
"This was one of the hardest
courses I've seen, mostly because
of its fast, undulating greens,"
he said. "Although we had a
practice round at Pasa Tiempo
earlier in the season, I'm sure it
hurt Dusty, Scott and me, who
had never played a tournament
there before. It's not a straight
forward course."
The Cardinal's next challenge
will be the Cougar Classic tour
nament tomorrow through Sun
day in Provo, Utah. "It's a good
tournament with a lot of good
teams," Kribel said. "We're still
building our confidence, and I
think it will be a good chance to
solidify that."
Although the field at the
Cougar Classic is strong, the
course itself varies in difficulty
according to the weather. Provo
