## Kribel wins, team is fourth Golf team defeats regional opponents 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's golf team
helped solidify its regional stand
ing this week in Santa Cruz.
"There's been a noticeable
change in the team in terms of
work ethic since spring break,"
said senior Eri Crum. "Every
one's practicing harder now
because now our attitude when
we're out there is that we know
we have the ability to do well."
The Cardinal stood behind
those words Tuesday when it
brought home a fourth-place fin
ish from the Western Intercolle
giate Tournament at Pasa Tiem
po Golf Course.
The golf team's stellar perfor
mance was led by sophomore
Joel Kribel, who posted scores of
72, 66 and 71, respectively, to
win the tournament with a com
posite score of 7-under-par 209.
Senior Conrad Ray tied for 20th
place, while freshman Dusty
Brett tied for 22nd.
Collectively, Kribel, Ray,
Brett, sophomore Scott Wang
and freshman Tylar Lunke post
ed scores of 300, 290 and 300 for
each of the three rounds to end
with a final team score of 890.
"The highlight of the tourna
ment was definitely seeing Joel
win and also beating out so many
teams from our region," Lunke
said of his first varsity tourna
ment.
This tournament win for Kri
bel was his second of the season
and third in his career and will
help move him one step closer to
qualifying for first-team All-
America honors at the end of the
season.
The team's key victories over
regional teams will also help
improve its position entering the
U.S. Intercollegiate at the Stan
ford Golf Course later this
month, the final determinant of
regional standing. The schools
finishing behind Stanford were
San Jose State, Long Beach
State, UC-Irvine, UC-Santa Bar

bara, Pacific and Washington.
These defeats will help move the
Card into a better position to
qualify for the regional tourna
ment.
In fact, the only Western
Regional team finishing higher
than Stanford was California,
which placed second.
Despite the team's success,
there were several areas in which
to improve. "Everybody threw a
few shots away here and there —
the course was tough." Kribel said.

There's been a
noticeable change in
the team in terms of
work ethic since
spring break.'

"You're never completely satis
fied, though. There's always
something you could have done
better."
Lunke also commented on the
course and its difficulty.
"This was one of the hardest
courses I've seen, mostly because
of its fast, undulating greens,"
he said. "Although we had a
practice round at Pasa Tiempo
earlier in the season, I'm sure it
hurt Dusty, Scott and me, who
had never played a tournament
there before. It's not a straight
forward course."
The Cardinal's next challenge
will be the Cougar Classic tour
nament tomorrow through Sun
day in Provo, Utah. "It's a good
tournament with a lot of good
teams," Kribel said. "We're still
building our confidence, and I
think it will be a good chance to
solidify that."
Although the field at the
Cougar Classic is strong, the
course itself varies in difficulty
according to the weather. Provo
has been windy and snowy in the
last few days, and there is a good
chance that the same change in
climate that disrupted Stan
ford's play at The Duck in
Eugene, Ore., will pose yet
another challenge to the squad
this week when it leaves Stan
ford's sunshine.
At the thought of playing in
snow, Kribel shudders. "I need to
buy some gloves," he said.
Regardless of the weather,
Stanford will keep its strong
regional standing. Provo will not
host any other Western Regional
teams and the next time the
Card's ranking will be put to the
test will be under the sun at its
home course in the U.S. Intercol
legiate April 25 and 26.
The Stanford tournament will
make or break the Card's region
al standing. Several other region
al opponents will compete and
this will be the last competition
considered for deciding which
top 12 teams play in the regional

tournament. Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships occur two
days after the rankings and will
not be considered.
"If we do well (at Stanford),
we'll compete at regionals," Kri
bel said. "We definitely have the
potential; we just need to play
more consistently."
Spring break set the Cardinal
golfers in a new direction in
more ways than one. Not only
has the team practiced much
harder since the break, but also
felt a powerful surge in confi
dence, due in part to the new
course record set by the team
March 29.
"Any time you can bring in
scores like that, and that many of
them, it's great for your confi
dence," Kribel said.
The golfers are looking to con
tinue building this confidence.
"Golf is a mental game,"
Crum said. "If you know you'll
shoot well, you will. It takes a
couple of good rounds and scores
to really feel that confidence.
But spring break was an eye
opener for all of us, and I think it
will be the beginning of some
thing bigger."
