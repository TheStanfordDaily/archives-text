You can call them the No. 2
baseball team in the nation, but
are there any words to describe
how hot the Stanford men are?
Probably not.
"We are just playing very well
right now," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess.
With a 15-4 victory over the
Santa Clara Broncos (16-16)
Tuesday night, the Cardinal (27-
8, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) extended its
winning streak to five games.
The Card has also won 17 of its
last 19 games.
"I hope we can continue, but
it may not be at this pace," Mar
quess said. "I am just pleased
right now."
The Santa Clara game was
won in unusual fashion, howev
er, as Stanford had only eight
hits to score 15 runs. Very
patient at the plate, the Card
drew 15 walks, tying a season
high.
The first six Stanford batters
to come to the plate scored as the
Cardinal jumped out to a 6-0
lead in the first inning. Senior
first baseman Luke Quaccia,
junior catcher Jon Schaeffer and
sophomores Jody Gerut and
Josh Hochgesang all contributed
run scoring hits during this big
inning.
Schaeffer also drilled a three
run home run in the second and
center fielder Gerut added
another three-run homer in the
third, allowing Stanford to take
a 12-0 lead. Both Schaeffer and
Gerut finished the day with four
RBIs. Gerut has a team-leading
48 RBIs.
Santa Clara's only real offen
sive threat came in the bottom of
the third when junior starter
Josh Koons, who picked up his
third victory of the season,
allowed back-to*back doubles to
the Broncos' Bill Mott and Mike
Frank. Paul Chiaffredo followed
with an RBI single, but the
Broncos were only able to chip
away Stanford'sadvantage to a
still robust 12-3.

Combining to finish the pitch
ing duties for Koons were junior
Harris and sophomore Tony
Cogan. Cogan, the team's closer,
is the Six-Pac's ERA leader,
boasting a 1.96 ERA.
The Card's momentum will
carry it into a weekend series
against No. 16 Arizona State
(24-16, 9-12) at Sunken Dia
mond. The three-game series
begins tomorrow at 7 p.m. Stan
ford will then face the Sun Dev
ils at 1 p.m. Saturday and Sun
day. The weekend features a
variety of promotions, including
a men's basketball appreciation
night tomorrow in which stu
dents are admitted free.
The Sun Devils' starters,
Ryan Mills, Phill Lowery and
Jeff Cermak, are three power
pitchers, two of them lefties.
Arizona State also uses excellent
team speed to pressure its oppo
nents. Junior Dan McKinley, the
Six-Pac player of the week, leads
the Sun Devils with a .425 bat
ting average, and sophomore
Andrew Beinbrink has a team
leading 50 RBIs.
Junior Kyle Peterson is
scheduled to start tomorrow's
matchup for Stanford, and
sophomore Chad Hutchinson
will likely take to the mound
Saturday, with sophomore Brent
Hoard slated for Sunday.
After an impressive noncon
ference start, the Sun Devils
have posted a 9-12 record in the
Six-Pac, and are in fifth place.
But is the Cardinal cocky about
this weekend's series?
"No," Marquess said. "We
realize that in conference, if we
don't play well, we will get beat.
We have a lot of respect for our
conference and are aware of the
caliber of teams in our league."
As an indication of the
strength of the Six-Pac, the Car
dinal swept USC at Dedeaux
Field right after the Trojans had
swept Arizona State at Packard
Stadium. With each team ranked
in the top 25 in the nation, this
was quite a feat.
"It can happen to us," Mar
quess said. "This just makes the
league so exciting."
