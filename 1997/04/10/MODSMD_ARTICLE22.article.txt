# Hard work pays off for cycling squad
## 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
It's a long and winding road for the Stanford
cycling team as they prepare for the collegiate
nationals in Durango, Colo., on May 10-11.
The team, one of the oldest collegiate cycling
teams on the West Coast, has been in existence
since 1974. It has qualified for the nationals every
year since 1988 and is currently in third place in
the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference.
In order to maintain this standing, the team
endures a grueling training schedule. The mem
bers meet regularly outside the post office in the
afternoon, usually practicing six or seven times a
week and riding more than 400 miles weekly.
The actual races can often be even more
demanding.
"You don't get to decide when it's hard," said
doctoral student Dave Bailey. "Because of the fact
that you're in the pack . . . you have no choice but
to go with [the speed]. You just have to be pre
pared to suffer."
The rewards of training and racing for the
team, however, are innumerable according to
Stanford coach Art Walker.
"They're in one of the best places in the coun
try to train," Walker said. "Collegiates serve as
feeders to national-team programs. A number of
our alums are cycling regularly for the teams
either as professionals or as well-sponsored ama
teurs."
The current Stanford cycling team is com
posed of 38 riders, but only 24 members partici
pate regularly in the races. This lower turnout,
especially when compared to the larger teams
assembled by UC-Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, often jeopardizes the team
standing.
Such was the case at the most recent race in
Reno last weekend. The men's team placed third
in the individual time trial behind Nevada and

UC-Santa Barbara, respectively.
Stanford also produced a first
place finish in the team time
trial, with the men's and
women's A teams winning their
races. The men's B team placed
fourth despite losing one of four
team members to an accident
with a car.
"In the time team trials, four
people are supposed to work
together so it's a disadvantage to
lose one, but we managed to lose
very few places by working very
hard the rest of the way," said law
student Brian Moore.
Senior Andy Price was
knocked out of the race when a
car turned into his path. Howev
er, Price, who was not badly
injured, went on to race in the cri
terium D category.
"I started off slow and a group
broke away at the front, and I
spent the second half of the race
trying to catch up to them," he
said. Price managed to chase the
leaders down in the final 100 yards

of the race, good for fourth place.
In the criterium races, the
Stanford squad came in second to
Santa Barbara as the team faced
severe winds.
"We had the quality, but not
the quantity," Walker said. "I
know that we can do as well with
more riders."
The wheels will still be in
motion for the remainder of the
season as the team fortifies itself
for the national competition,
which will consist of a strenuous
road race in the alpine peaks sur
rounding Durango.
"It starts at 6,300 feet and fin
ishes at 9,300 feet," Bailey said.
"Also, it's going to be freezing
cold."
The next team road block,
however, appears on the horizon
this weekend as Stanford travels
to Chico State. The team will
compete in a 50-100 mile road
race and a shorter criterium race
of 20-35 miles.
"We think it's a good opportu
nity for a win because it's a strong
event for us — it's a long hard
road race and we excel at that,"
said doctoral student Russell
Mead.
