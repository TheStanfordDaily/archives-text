# Hard work pays off for cycling squad

It's a long and winding road for the Stanford
cycling team as they prepare for the collegiate
nationals in Durango, Colo., on May 10-11.
The team, one of the oldest collegiate cycling
teams on the West Coast, has been in existence
since 1974. It has qualified for the nationals every
year since 1988 and is currently in third place in
the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference.
In order to maintain this standing, the team
endures a grueling training schedule. The mem
bers meet regularly outside the post office in the
afternoon, usually practicing six or seven times a
week and riding more than 400 miles weekly.
The actual races can often be even more
demanding.
"You don't get to decide when it's hard," said
doctoral student Dave Bailey. "Because of the fact
that you're in the pack . . . you have no choice but
to go with [the speed]. You just have to be pre
pared to suffer."
The rewards of training and racing for the
team, however, are innumerable according to
Stanford coach Art Walker.
"They're in one of the best places in the coun
try to train," Walker said. "Collegiates serve as
feeders to national-team programs. A number of
our alums are cycling regularly for the teams
either as professionals or as well-sponsored ama
teurs."
The current Stanford cycling team is com
posed of 38 riders, but only 24 members partici
pate regularly in the races. This lower turnout,
especially when compared to the larger teams
assembled by UC-Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, often jeopardizes the team
standing.
Such was the case at the most recent race in
Reno last weekend. The men's team placed third
in the individual time trial behind Nevada and
