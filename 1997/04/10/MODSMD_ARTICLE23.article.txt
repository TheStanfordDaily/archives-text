# Men's volleyball takes on Aztecs and Tritons at home
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team (19-3, 1.3-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) will look to continue
rolling over opponents in a fashion simi
lar to that which has defeated its last nine
opponents and brought it victory in M of
its last 15 matches.
Tomorrow's contest at 7 p.m. against
San Diego State (5-19, 1-15 MPSF) and
Saturday's contest at 3 p.m. against IJC-
San Diego (5-18, 2-14 MI'SF) are the
final regular-season matches the Cardi
nal will play at Burnham Pavilion. With
wins in both, Stanford would post a per
fect regular-season record at home for
the year.
Based on the last three matches that
Stanford has played at home, in which
the squad has defeated national power
Hawaii twice and trounced lowly Cal
State-San Bernardino, the Aztecs and
Tritons from San Diego should not be
much of a test. The San Diego schools are
the owners of the two worst records in
the Pacific Division of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation and will not
factor into postseason play, and the
Aztecs' first 18 losses went a mere three
games.
In addition, the Cardinal has faced
both schools already this year. Stanford
traveled south to play the two schools in
its first two league matches of the year
Jan. 31 and Feb. 2.
In the match against San Diego State,
the Cardinal came away with a dominant
win 15-5, 15-9, 15-10. Stanford put
together a combination of outstanding
defensive volleyball, allowing the Aztecs
just 24 points and siding out an outstand
ing 75 times, with a strong offensive
game. Led by senior outside hitter Mike
Lambert and freshman outside hitter

Andy Witt, Stanford hit .4UH us a team.
However, if Stanford is to repeat and
garner another easy win against the
Aztecs, it will have to he sure to return
serve well. The team will have to watch
out in particular for the serve of San
Diego State's Matt (hilvin, who has been
among the nation's leaders in service-ace
average.
While Stanford may continue to look to
Lambert and Witt to dominate the out
side against the Aztecs, the Cardinal may
shift this strategy against UC-San Diego.
In the first match between the two
schools, Stanford dominated the middle,
winning 15-11, 15-5, 15-6.
In the match, senior middle blocker
Mike Hoofer destroyed the Tritons. Hoe
fer accounted for 1 1 kills and seven block
assists, while hitting .fiHH. The presence
of Hoofer and Stanford's other big front
line players also took away UC-San
Diego's most potent attacker, Eric Mia,
who was held to .110 hitting.
Despite the relatively poor quality of
these two opponents, look for Stanford to
come out firing on all cylinders. Unlike
earlier in the season when the team
appeared to take nn indifferent attitude
to lesser teams, recently it has gone out
and taken care of business regardless of
the opponent.
"We really want to close out the season
strong," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We have been playing our best volleyball
of the season, and it is really important
that we continue to do so.
"Having momentum going into the
tournament is really important, particu
larly since the only way to ensure a trip to
the Final Four is to win the MI'SF tour
nament."
The tournament winner gets an auto
matic berth to the Final Four in Colum
bus next month, while only one national
at-large hid is up for grabs.
