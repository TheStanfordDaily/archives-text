# Baby ducks threatened in brouhaha over Med Center fountain

Make way for ducklings!
That, at least, is the view of a small but
passionate group of people concerned with
Stanford's decision to remove nesting areas
for baby duckiings from the fountain in
front of the Medical Center.
This decision caused several newly
hatched ducklings, who arrived in the
world yesterday morning, to become ill or
drown, which has brought down accusa
tions of insensitivity on the University.
"This policy of 'survival of the fittest' is
not appropriate, particularly for a hospital
fountain," said Linda Lloyd, an administra
tive associate in the Molecular Pharmacolo
gy Department.
Ducklings are unable to survive without
shelter for the first weeks of their life, ac
cording to Lloyd.
"Young ducks have to be able to get to
high land to be with Mom when it gets
cool," she said.
At about 6 a.m. yesterday, Lloyd and sev
eral patients noticed the ducklings "bobbing
around" and attempted to rescue them.
Although severed of the ducklings had al
ready died, Lloyd and the patients rescued
the remaining ducks and plan to give them
to the Wildlife Rescue agency in Palo Alto.
"By having a big pool of water, you are

inviting them to come," said Marjorie
Weesner, an administrative associate in the
Office of Medical Student and Graduate Af
fairs. "It is really horribly cruel and inhu
mane."
University officials maintain that the de
cision to leave the ducklings homeless was
dictated by county laws.
"A county person came here and told us
that we couldn't provide housing or food for
the ducks," said John Hayes, assistant di
rector of housekeeping for the Medical Cen
ter.
However, Diane Snyder, a dispatcher
with the California State Fish and Game
department said there are no fish and game
regulations covering ducks in fountains, or
duckling housing for that matter.
While the ducklings may be safe for now,
others are concerned about the fate of fu
ture generations of ducks.
"The fountain is not a healthy habitat
for nesting ducks," said Lloyd. "We are not
taking adequate measures for stopping
ducks from nesting there."
Lloyd said that a number of easy steps
such as draining the fountain during nest
ing season— could be taken to prevent the
birds from settling there.
Hayes said the Humane Society and the
Medical Center are currently holding nego
tiations over the fate of future duckling
housing.
