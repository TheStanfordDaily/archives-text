# Vandalism case yields suspects
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford students are among
a number of suspects turned up by po
lice investigation into Monday's anti
gay vandalism at a Suites eating club.
According to a police statement,
investigation "has developed infor
mation that has focused on specific
suspects." No charges have yet been
made, and the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office is review
ing the evidence.

Stanford Police Capt. Raonl Niemeyer confirmed
that two students were among the suspects but did not
release any names or specify how many non-students
were involved.
Dean of Students Marc Wais would confirm only
that he was aware the police were investigating the in
cident. He said his office "has not been notified as to
the status of the investigation."
The next step in the process is for the District At
torney's Office to decide what, if any, charges the evi
dence merits.
Dana Overstreet of the District Attorney's Office
said he was "receiving bits and pieces of information"
from Stanford, and that the attorneys would wait
until they could look at the whole body of evidence be
fore deciding whether to treat the incident as a hate
crime.
The 1994 vandalism of the "Gay Liberation" statue
was not prosecuted as a hate crime. At the time, only
violations of individuals' civil rights qualified as hate
crimes.
Overstreet said that, partly in response to that spe
cific incident, the definition has been expanded to in
clude crimes against the property of public or private
institutions such as schools.
She said no decision on charges would be made
until at least the end of this week, as it would take time
to examine all the evidence.
"We're not taking this lightly," Overstreet said.
The seriousness of the incident was far from lost on
members of the Stanford community.
Troy Gilbert, the adviser of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, called the vandalism "a
complete anathema to the idea of a university."
He said the whole community was affected if some
people on campus had to use vandalism to express
themselves even in a place where "it seems to me that
we have so many ways to engage in hopeat, talk
about differences."
Jeff Seiff, co-president of Out for Business, an or
ganization for gay, lesbian and bisexual students at
the Graduate School of Business, added that more
openness from every side of the discussion could only
be beneficial.
"We would all be a little better off if we were less
concerned about not offending one another and more
concerned about standing up for what we believe,"
Seiff said.
