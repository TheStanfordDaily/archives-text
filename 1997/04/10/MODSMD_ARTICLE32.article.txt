The weight of the world f
is love. N
Under the burden
of solitude,
under the burden I 1
of dissatisfaction V-r
the weight, y
the weight we carry M
is love.
Who can deny?
In dreams f _
it touches
the body,
in thought Allen Ginsberg,
constructs (June 3, 1926-
a miracle, April 5, 1997)
in imagination
anguishes
till born
in human —
looks out of the heart
burning with purity—
for the burden of life
is love,
but we carry the weight
wearily,
and so must rest
in the arms of love
at last,
must rest in the arms
of love.
No rest
without love,
no sleep
without dreams
of love—
be mad or chill
obsessed with angels
or machines,
the final wish
is love
—cannot be bitter,
cannot deny,
cannot withhold
if denied:
the weight is too heavy
—must give
for no return
as thought
is given
in solitude
in all the excellence
of its excess.
The warm bodies
shine together
in the darkness,
the hand moves
to the center
of the flesh,
the skin trembles
in happiness
and the soul comes
joyful to the eye —
yes, yes,
that's what
I wanted,
I always wanted,
1 always wanted,
to return
to the body
where 1 was born.
San Jose, 1954
