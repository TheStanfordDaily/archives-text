## STEGNERS REAP THE REWARDS OF CREATIVE WRITING 
### 
T IS A TRUISM IN CREATIVE WRITING CLASSES that the plea
sures of being a poet or writer should come from the act of
working rather than from the possibility of publishing. As
several Wallace Stegner Fellows at Stanford are finding
out, however, publication can still be pretty satisfying.

Right now, five current and recent Stegner Fellows
— poet Talvikki Ansel and fiction writers Peter Rock,
Steve Lattimore, Diane Woodßrown and Lan Saman
tha Chang — have new books out already or coming
out shortly.
A unique two-year program that offers stipends and
workshops but no degrees, the Stegner Fellowships
program annually accepts 10 promising fiction writers
and 10 poets from an applicant pool of almost 1,000.
According to Rock, whose novel "This Is the Place"
was published earlier this month by Doubleday, the
success of the recent batch of fellows comes closer to
underrepresenting than overblowing the talent being
displayed in the workshop.
"I do think it's true that everyone in the workshop
could have a book published within a year, and I see
better things than my book all the time, and 1 cover
them in criticism," he said.
Such criticism is the centerpiece of the workshop.
The first time he turned in a story to be "work
shopped" — meaning to be read and discussed by his
classmates — Rock said, "I expected adulation or
praise. Instead I was met with confusion and criticism.
I thought, defensively, 'How did these people get in
here? Why arc they so dense?' "
More than a year later, Rock sees these classmates as
"smart readers (who) can bring you to realizations
earlier than you would have arrived by yourself."
Rock said he began writing seriously as an under
graduate at Yale University. Now he is simultaneously
working on two short story collections and a novel.
"Whenever I'm writing, things are always multiplying
and extrapolating. I'm always writing in the margins,"
he said.

His newel "This Is the Place," which addresses the
moral tensions and contradictions between Utah and
Nevada, focuses on an elderly blackjack dealer and the
19-year-old Mormon girl with whom lie is preoccu
pied.
Rock readily admits that not everything he works
on is worth publishing or even saving. "I've spent a lot
of time writing long things that turned out very, very
poorly," he said. "A day-to-day part of being a writer
for me is being really dissatisfied with my work."
As he prepares for a national book tour, Rock must
suppress these doubts, at least outwardly. "At this stage
1 must pimp for the product," he said.
Unlike Rock, Talvikki Ansel will be neither pimping
nor touring for her collection of poems, although she
will go to Yale later this month as the culmination of
winning the annual Yale Series of Younger Poets.
Ansel's book, "My Shining Archipelago," was pub
lished this month by Yale University Press. Past win
ners of the contest include YV.S. Merwin, Adrienne
Rich and Robert Mass.
Despite the prestige of the award, Ansel's book is
unlikely to make her rich or famous. Hut Ansel, who
was a Stegner Fellow from 1993 through 1995, said she
is not bothered by the fact that poetry is not widely
read. "1 don't really take it personally," she said.
"You just have to keep writing and stick with it and
keep plugging away," she added. "There's no guarantee
your work will get published. You have to keep doing it
because you want to do it."
Ansel's own commitment to poetry solidified while
she was working as a gardener at Thomas Jefferson's
Monticello after college. "1 was always wavering be
tween majoring in ecology and English," she said. "It
seems like I've liked [writing] for a while, but I didn't
really start writing a lot until I was in Virginia."
Ansel believes that her interest in writing stems
partly from growing up with three brothers and no TV.
"We always read a lot," she said. "We read and drew and
did stuff outside, fought, had pets." Now, one brother
is a boat builder, one is a painter and one is in the Peace
Corps. If the family had had a TV, "we would have all
worked for Microsoft," Ansel joked.
Carrying her interest in reading to a professional
level, Ansel worked at the Stanford Bookstore after her
Stegner fellowship ended. In addition to allowing her
to be surrounded by books, the job gave her insight
into the business side of publishing, she said.
Deciding to move on, Ansel quit her job in March in
order to live at the Djerassi Resident Artists Program,
a 600-acre artists' colony in Woodside established by
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi. Ansel will live at the
colony for seven months, helping run the program in

exchange lor room, hoard and a stipend.
"I have little fragments and jottings I would like to
work on," she said.
Part of the appeal of a hook, according to Ansel, is
that it allows her to give her lull attention to new writ
ing. A book is "a done deal," she said. "It's nice to have
a sense of closure to these poems."
At the same time, Ansel said that her life is not dra
matically different than it was before the late poet
lames Dickey selected Iter as the winner of this year's
Yale Younger Poets contest. "It's definitely nice, and
I'm sure that I'm much happier than ill hadn't won it,"
Ansel said. "Hut it didn't immediately change my for
tunc or something."
As lor the book itself, the settings of the poems
range from the Amazonian rain forest to Elizabethan
London. "Someone might see themes," Ansel said. "I
prefer not to."
Steve Lattimore, in contrast, sees his story collec
tion as having very definite themes. "My stories I,ike

place mostly in (the) San Joaquin Valley and are gen
erally about social cast-offs, adults unable to leave
childhood behind and children forced by circum
stances to become adults before their time," he said.
Lattimore, whose collection of stories "Circumnav
igation" will be published this fall by Houghton Mif
flin, is a second-year Stegner Fellow.
Currently he is working with his publisher on how
to market "Circumnavigation." Referring to the prac
tice of printing other writers' endorsements on the
book jacket, Lattimore said, "They're going through
the blurb sweepstakes right now.
"It's so new to me it's kind of fun," he added. "I still
don't think of myself as a writer with a book coming
out. I think of myself as some little workshop loser."
