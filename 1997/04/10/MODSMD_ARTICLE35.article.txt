## War propaganda, sewers and Bloomsbury artists A
						trio of on-campus exhibitions, two of which were assembled by history students 
### 
Current viewers of three petite but rich campus art ex
hibits on Britain will garner a substantial knowledge
of British history from the display captions but per
haps remain unaware that the authors of those captions are

Stanford students.
Last quarter's histo
ry class, "Presenting
Britain," taught by Prof.
Peter Stansky, orga
nized the three shows
that are now on view at
the Stanford Art
Gallery and the Hoover

Memorial Exhibit Pavilion. They cover a diverse set of
themes — the London sewer system, British posters of the
First and Second World Wars and the famed intellectual
Bloomsbury Circle.
San Francisco's "Britain Meets the Bay Festival" is the mo
tivating force behind this campus celebration of British cul
ture and history, said Stansky, whom sophomore Max Frd
stein describes as "a world specialist on Bloomsbury." For 12
students this outside cultural event meant a rare opportuni
ty to curate their own museum exhibits.
"The thing that made the class different was that it was
hands-on," said senior Becky Rambow, a history major. "It's
not often you get to take a class and have your project viewed
by hundreds of people."
Stansky noted that the course had another unusual aspect
— it allowed the students to work with professionals such as

museum cura
tors and librar
ians; in most
classes stu
dents only
have contact
with profes
sors.
The course
drew in senior
Heather Hard
wick, she said,
because it was
"experimen
tal" and gave
her a chance to
do "primary
source re
search." In
stead of being
entirely "intel
lectual discus
sion, [class
times] would
be more like
project group

meetings," she said.
The class divided itself into three groups — each in
charge of one exhibit. The students coordinating the
sewers and war posters shows at the Hoover Pavilion had
to sift through many historical and cultural artifacts to
determine what works would he on display.
Those organizing the Bloomshury program did not
have to choose the works themselves, said Stansky. He
and an intern at the Stanford Art Museum, 19% Stan
ford graduate Moth Mangini spent last summer choosing
the Bloomsbury works to be displayed from various art
collections in the area.
"Notes from the Underground," the title of the sew
ers exhibit (borrowed from Fyodor Dostoevskys novel
of the same name), makes the London sewer system
sound just as revolutionary as it was: According to Trd
stein, the London sewer system "represents the transfor
mation of London to a modern city."

Indeed, this civil engineering achievement not only
revolutionized London itself, but its construction gave Lon
don the distinction of having "the first sanitary system based
on civil engineering," F.rdstein said.
"The idea for it was rumbling around for years and years,
but the main push for it came in the 1850s," explained Ram

bow, who also worked on the sewers exhibition. The bulk of
it was finally completed in the 1870s, she said.
In order to create "Notes from the Underground," Erd
stein and the other two students in his group perused a col
lection of British civil engineering books acquired by the
Department of Special Collections at Green Library.
The three students sorted through this collection, which
consists of 500 volumes of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the civil
engineer who designed the London sewer system.
"We searched for visual things, interesting quotes," and
other things to fill the six cases of the exhibit, Erdstein said.
The four students who worked on "Forward to Victory,"
the war posters exhibition, had no trouble finding "visual
things" for their project because the Hoover Institution
Archives contains more than 3,000 original British posters
from the two world wars.
1 lardwick explained that she and the other students in her
group looked at the posters on slides, originally selected
about 200 and then "pared those down to about 40."
Those 40 are now on display at the Hoover Pavilion, bach
image chosen was placed in a group with others of a similar
theme, so that each comprises a mini-collection in itself.
The motifs portrayed in the show cover a whole range ol
ideas, from"the role of women in both wars, the role of the
[British] Empire and ... stylistic images," Hardwick ex
plained.
"How was it portrayed? Was it portrayed symbolically or
was it portrayed realistically?" were some of the questions
the group asked themselves as they searched through the im
ages, she said.
Though the posters themselves are fairly self-explanatory,
the captions provide an analysis of the images and slogans
and illuminate the themes that the students found. For in
stance,one image portrays a young girl sitting on her father's
lap and asking him, "Daddy, what did you do in the (ireat
War?" The accompanying text explains that the poster was
meant to appeal to a man's pride and his duty to protect his
family.
While "Forward to Victory" was the cry of those involved
in the war effort, "Down with Victorian Modesty!" may have
been the cry of the members of what is now known as the
Bloomsbury Circle.

"The Bloomsbury C Circle in Bay Area (Collections," on dis
play in a cozy room at the hack of the Stanford Art Gallery,
showcases the art and a few hooks associated with the early
20th century British intellectual crowd.
From this highly esteemed group comes the literary giant
Virginia Woolf, probably the most well-known ol her asso
dates. Aside from a few of her books, the majority of the
works in the exhibit showcase her painter counterparts,
Vanessa Bell, Roger l ry and I Hmcan (irant.
Their art reflects the influence of T.douatd Manet and the
Post-Impressionist painters because l ry had set up an exhi
bition of such works during l l )l().
"The artworks had already been chosen according to
availability, but we each did one or two artists, and one did
the overall intro," said senior Kirsten I oreen, one ol the five
students who worked on the Bloomsbury project.
The artworks come from collect ions around the Bay Area,
including two contributions from the Stanford Art Muse
um. Woolf's great-aunt, Julia Margaret C ameron (1815-
1879) took these two softly brown toned photographs de
scribed as "ethereal" by Loreen, who did the research and
wrote the captions on (Cameron.
Though Cameron was obviously part of an older genera

tion than the Bloomsbury Circle, "her legacy is present in the
philosophy of the Bloomsbury Ciroup," said I.oreen.
Cameron, says Loreen, believed in going underneath the
surface to seek out the core or essence of people, and the
Bloomsbury group's purpose to battle Victorian pretense
echoes Cameron's ideals, said Loreen.
"1 liked the class because it combined regular schoolwork
with work that one could see the results of," I.oreen said.
As her fellow student, Rainbow, said "It's real experience;
it's curatorial." U
