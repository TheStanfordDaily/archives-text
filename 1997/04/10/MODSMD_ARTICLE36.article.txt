# Music and mayhem in 'City of Angels'

### 
"Stay amy front Hollywood, Jt 's poison for writers."
— Raymond Chandler, 1939.

Musicals arc confusing. One moment a person is talking and 1
behaving normally, the next he or she is singing and danc-1
ing for no apparent reason at all. Whereas most people con-1
sider this entertainment, it strikes me as the behavior of a 1
psychotic. The only time I've seen anything comparable off I
the stage was in the lobby of the M(!M Grand in Las Vegas, and Las |
Vegas is hardly admissible as evidence of normal behavior. And yet 1 !j
seem to be the only one with these reservations. The musical is one of 1
the most popular forms of entertainment today, and "City of Angels," |
the Ram's I lead spring musical, is one of the most popular musicals in |
recent years.
When it opened on Broadway in 1989, "City of Angels" was seen as |
the Renaissance of the American musical. In both the Tony Awards and §
the Olivier Awards, Tonys London cousin, "City of Angels" shut out |
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard," ending Lloyd Webber's |
decade-long domination of the musical genre. The play was inspired by |
writer Larry Gelbart's own clash with Hollywood when he worked on
the Dustin 1 loffman film "Tootsie."

"C jty of Angels" is divided into two different worlds. One is the 1940s
1 lollywood studio system, in which a writer named Stine (Brandon Sin
gleton) is trying to get his novel, "City of Angels," adapted into a film
without its being destroyed by his producer, Buddy Fidler (George
Mitchell). The other is the film noir "City of Angels" itself, which is about
a private eye (John Wright), improbably called Stone. Stone is hired by
Alaura Kingsley (Carmel Murphy), an attractive and, of course, married
woman, to track down her missing daughter, Mallory (Oceana
Blueskyes).
The two worlds intersect in Stine, who uses the people from the stu
dio as inspiration for the characters in his movie and sees Stone as an ex
tension of himself. Most of the cast has plays both a Hollywood charac
ter and the film character that Stine translates them into.
The script requires an incredible complexity in staging and design.
Whereas the Broadway production had an enormous budget to create
the necessary effects, the Ram's 1 lead production has had to rely on the
innovation and imagination of their technical crew.
"We have an amazing team that worked around the limited budget
and used it to create something stronger than something with a larger
budget," producer liana Wiener said.
The set is divided into three different levels. The film occupies the
topmost level, and there the actors and lighting attempt to create the il
lusion that of a black-and-white film world. The bottom level is the Hol
lywood level; the colors have the gaudiness of 1950s Coca-Cola ads, and
the acting is naturalistic. It is the interaction and conflict between these
two worlds, which takes place on the middle level, that provides much of

the musical's entertainment.
"I think people on campus will be more in tune with '(,ity of Angels
than, say, 'Oklahoma,' " assistant director Lindsay Campbell, a sopho
more, said. This musical is a 1990s take on the 19405, and it certainly is
not the decade that the 1940s recognized itself to be. Buddy Fiddler
might complain about the presence of such words as Goddammit,
"Jesus," and "bastards" in Stine's screenplay, but Fidler himself, like
every other character in the Hollywood world, is not afraid to utter a
profanity or five.
Both the Hollywood world and the film world shoulder the burden
of providing the right amount of sex, violence and comedy. 1 here are
shootings, brawls, adulterous affairs and, at one point, on-stage nudity.
(Predictably only a woman takes her clothes off; the male cast is re
spectably allowed to remain clothed at all times.) Some scenes are de
lightfully twisted, such as Stone getting beaten up to the upbeat tunes of
Jimmy Powers and the Angel City Four or Alaura Kingsley spoon-feed
ing her husband as he lies immobilized in an iron lung.
As genres, film noir and the musical are about as different from each
other as left is from right. Film noir is ice-cold and cynical. 1 he closest to
a happy ending that film noir gets is not having everybody die at the end,
and even then the survivors are usually unhappy to be alive. The musi-1
cal, on the other hand, has to be uplifting at the very least. No death is I
(pointless and no life will be destroyed unless sugared with a necessary I
amount of nobility. Even if the suffering is immense and the waste ofi
| human life intolerable, there's always room for the big final number. 1
The attempt of "City of Angels" to force film noir to obey the rules ofi
1 the musical is a drama

lin itself. Campbell
1
I pointed out, "For this
I play we researched a lot
I of film noir films; no
-1 body would ever sing a
I song." Eventually the
| film noir has to acqui
| esce to the musical.
Even in the first pages
I of the script there are
| forebodings of the film
1 noir's eventual collapse
| when we see that Harlan
| Yamato, the county
I coroner, is a singing role.
| The film starts off dark
| ly enough in a morgue,
introducing Stone on
I his deathbed with a bul
let in his shoulder. Bit by
bit, however, the musi
cal seeps into the noir el
ements. When consid
ering Alaura Kingsley's
offer, Stone turns to the
audience and sings, "I
might be willingly de
ceived / 'Cause I can
trust myself around
her / Even less than I can
trust her / But even so I
need the dough." The
lyrics might be film noir,

but the singing private
eye certainly is not.
The disintegration continues when Stone visits Alaura at her man
sion. Where "Double Indemnity" had a conversation full of double en
tendres, Alaura and Stone sing "The Tennis Song." The repartee in"The
Tennis Song" has one meaning for sure; I don't know whether you could
rightfully discern two: Alaura: "1 like to work up a sweat." Stone: "And you
just can't get enough /... 1 may lack form and finesse / But I'll warm up
in a jiff." Alaura: "It's not exciting unless / The competition is stiff."
When Stone discovers Mallory in his bed, the conventions of film
noir demand sexual and dramatic tension. Instead, Mallory launches
into the finger-snapper "Lost and Found," which contains perhaps the

best lyric of the play: "And though Daddy told you to turn me in / Why
don't 1 turn you on instead?"
The tension between the two genres in "City of Angels" is resolved by
turning the film noir plot into a delicious parody. The private-eye film
is perhaps one ot the most frequently and lazily parodied genres at the
moment, but "City of Angels" pulls it off.
The acting in the film noir segments neatly parodies the style of I 940s
films without making the characterizations too obvious. There might
be an element of Bogart in Wright's portrayal of Stone, but at the same
time Stone's voice comes from the narrator of the Batman audiocas
sette stories that Wright listened to as a child.
The offbeat style ot the crime novel is taken to the extreme and quick
ly becomes comically absurd: "$ 10,000. Next to M rs. Kingsley's this was
the nicest figure in the room." It can also become self-conscious and
heavy at times ("L.A., truth to tells not much different from a girl with
the clap"), but on the whole the film noir world keeps itself sharp and
entertaining.
Whereas most art forms these days are happy to merely sup- j
ply symbols, leaving it to the audience to link them up and I
then pat themselves on the back for interpreting the artist's
message correctly, the musical takes no such chances. II
there is ever any subtlety in a musical, then it is generally
subtlety dressed in a luminous green shirt, with "SUB TLETY" written
iall over it, hitting itself over the head with a hammer and shouting,
"Look at me! I'm subtlety, I'm subtlety!" There is no way you can es-1
cape understanding what "City of Angels" is about.
First, we are asked to consider the relationship between the artist and j
the characters he or she creates. In The New York 'Times, country singer i
Kinky Friedman philosophically declared," 'City of Angels' may be set I
in the forties in Flollywood, but the excruciatingly empty pages Stone

•"• *•"» •■■ * •"•■/ w,v v " v * mv,m
must fill to imbue Stone with a mandatory Marlow-like loneliness
; could be pages out of any of our lives."
The musical employs a number of devices to make this clear to us.
When Stine revises his script, the characters in the film noir world
; freeze, do the scene in reverse and then do a revised version. Later
I Gabby (Stine's wife, played by Natausha Wilson) and Oolie (Stone's
secretary, played by Hillary Stamm), simultaneously sing about how
Stine and his fictional creation are equally hopeless at understanding
| women. If there is still any doubt, by the end of the first act Stine and
Stone are singing "You're Nothing without Me" to each other.
Jeff Tabaco, who plays the crooner Jimmy Powers, explains: "If we
| were just to say 'You're Nothing without Me,' it could get lost and di
" luted among everything else that gets said. Instead this line gets sung
I and reprised, and the point gets made."
The play also asks us to consider the lure of money and the negative

effect that it has on artistic integrity. Stine's novel contains a Chicano
character named Murio/ (Jason Alisharan), who, outraged over the fact
that Stone was apparently able to get away with murder on account of his
skin color, vowed to put Stone behind bars. Again, in case we might miss
it, the point is sung to us. The song, which contains such lyrics as "You've
never been my fav'rite / Gringo / In my native lingo / Adios / The end is
close," is the best proof I've ever heard of Voltaire's dictum that anything
too silly to be said can always be sung.
Naturally, producer Buddy Fidler wants to cut
the "social crap" and, of course, a smattering of , - -

...V UMVI,
Mc( larthyism is thrown in as a part of Fidlers evil
Hollywood logic. In a sense, though, "City of An
gels" is not so different from Fidler, it is as com
pulsory to include a racial statement in the 1990s
as it was to exclude it in the 19405. If the musical
is going to make a message, it's not going to take
any risks in getting the audience to notice it.
Director John Chakan, a senior, has chosen
to downplay the message segments of "City of
Angels."
"The play pokes fun at Stine for being the
stereotypical artist with integrity as much as it
pokes fun at Buddy," he said. "We've tried to
keep the show as apolitical as possible."
This is probably the correct approach for the
Stanford campus, which is likely to react cyni
cally to some of the show's heartfelt messages.
This production has chosen to playfully satire
just about everybody in it, making it witty
where it might have been heavy and leaden.
There are other respects in which it is proba

bly wise for "(lity of Angels" to resist interpreta
tion. For example, Donna's (Nudity's secretary) reflection on why she is
always used by men — "I'm solely to blame /... I'm my own worst
enemy" — sounds as it the rationale of a rapist has been forced into her
mouth. People might read a negative message into the fact that Stine is
played by a black man, whereas his fantasy double, Stone, is white. I low
ever, to read anything too significant into this play is to misinterpret it.
The casting decisions were authentically 'color-blind,' and the sexism
should be seen as quoting the attitudes of either the I l M()s or film noir it
self. "This play refuses to take itself seriously," said (lampbell.
The musical isat its best when it unpretentiously goes for pure enter
tainment. After all, that's what the songs are there for. "It's impossible to
separate the songs from the show and still have the same show," t 'hakan
said. "The songs are so good. You can't expect to have anything left that
could stand up dramatically if you take the songs away."
Although some people in the cast tried to convince me that the songs
were a natural expression of the plot, it seemed to me that it works the other
way around; the plot merely provides excuses for singing and dancing.
That's why musicals are so difficult to parody. It is literally impossible
to come up with subject matter for a musical more absurd than what

Broadway produces, a.s the upcoming musical "Titanic" testifies. This is be
cause the subject matter is irrelevant to the musical's success; it merely provides
the glue that keeps the songs together. The plot might confer some highbrow
status, like when Andrew I Joyd-Webber adapted T.S. I liot poems lor"(ats,"or
it might provide the laughs and the context for the songs, which is wh.it it does
in "(Jty of Angels." I lowever, the plot's main function is to differentiate one
musical from the other. Hven in the musicals that try their hardest to be dark,
bleak artistic statements, there'll always be something to snap your lingers to.
(Carmel Murphy, a 1996 Stanford grad, sees singing and dancing as the per
feet way to express emotion. "I or instance, every time I eat something that is
amazingly tasty, I start to do a little dance in my chair and I hum a little tune
to express my sheer delight," she said. "So, in a musical, we are trying to con
vey extreme emotions through our song and dance."
"(lity of Angels" not only does this successfully but is not afraid ol calling at
tent ion to the ambiguous role of singing in the musical. At one point, buddy I i
dler has to sing so badly it's comic, and yet he is later called upon to sing "The
Buddy System" competently. Buddy I idler the character might be .1 bad singer,
but the actor who is playing him cannot afford to be so untalented. later in the
play Stone visits his girlfriend, Bobbie, who is singing at .1 nightclub. In this
scene, the song Bobbie sings does not represent the emotion ol the character; it
represents a woman singing 011 stage. "(.ity of Angels" is as competent at sell
parody as it is at parody, and that is perhaps the key to its success.
Although I'm not convinced that I'll ever be able to understand the mu
sical, "City of Angels" is definitely accessible. The music is excellent, and the
subject matter is as strong as the music. As junior I lillary Stamm pointed
out, "Hveryone wants to be in a '40s movie. Now we get to be in one, even il
it is on the stage." II

sider this entertainment, it strikes me as the behavior of a 1
psychotic. The only time I've seen anything comparable off I
the stage was in the lobby of the M(!M Grand in Las Vegas, and Las |
Vegas is hardly admissible as evidence of normal behavior. And yet 1 !j
seem to be the only one with these reservations. The musical is one of 1
the most popular forms of entertainment today, and "City of Angels," |
the Ram's I lead spring musical, is one of the most popular musicals in |
recent years.
When it opened on Broadway in 1989, "City of Angels" was seen as |
the Renaissance of the American musical. In both the Tony Awards and §
the Olivier Awards, Tonys London cousin, "City of Angels" shut out |
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard," ending Lloyd Webber's |
decade-long domination of the musical genre. The play was inspired by |
writer Larry Gelbart's own clash with Hollywood when he worked on
the Dustin 1 loffman film "Tootsie."

"C jty of Angels" is divided into two different worlds. One is the 1940s
1 lollywood studio system, in which a writer named Stine (Brandon Sin
gleton) is trying to get his novel, "City of Angels," adapted into a film
without its being destroyed by his producer, Buddy Fidler (George
Mitchell). The other is the film noir "City of Angels" itself, which is about
a private eye (John Wright), improbably called Stone. Stone is hired by
Alaura Kingsley (Carmel Murphy), an attractive and, of course, married
woman, to track down her missing daughter, Mallory (Oceana
Blueskyes).
The two worlds intersect in Stine, who uses the people from the stu
dio as inspiration for the characters in his movie and sees Stone as an ex
tension of himself. Most of the cast has plays both a Hollywood charac
ter and the film character that Stine translates them into.
The script requires an incredible complexity in staging and design.
Whereas the Broadway production had an enormous budget to create
the necessary effects, the Ram's 1 lead production has had to rely on the
innovation and imagination of their technical crew.
"We have an amazing team that worked around the limited budget
and used it to create something stronger than something with a larger
budget," producer liana Wiener said.
The set is divided into three different levels. The film occupies the
topmost level, and there the actors and lighting attempt to create the il
lusion that of a black-and-white film world. The bottom level is the Hol
lywood level; the colors have the gaudiness of 1950s Coca-Cola ads, and
the acting is naturalistic. It is the interaction and conflict between these
two worlds, which takes place on the middle level, that provides much of

the musical's entertainment.
"I think people on campus will be more in tune with '(,ity of Angels
than, say, 'Oklahoma,' " assistant director Lindsay Campbell, a sopho
more, said. This musical is a 1990s take on the 19405, and it certainly is
not the decade that the 1940s recognized itself to be. Buddy Fiddler
might complain about the presence of such words as Goddammit,
"Jesus," and "bastards" in Stine's screenplay, but Fidler himself, like
every other character in the Hollywood world, is not afraid to utter a
profanity or five.
Both the Hollywood world and the film world shoulder the burden
of providing the right amount of sex, violence and comedy. 1 here are
shootings, brawls, adulterous affairs and, at one point, on-stage nudity.
(Predictably only a woman takes her clothes off; the male cast is re
spectably allowed to remain clothed at all times.) Some scenes are de
lightfully twisted, such as Stone getting beaten up to the upbeat tunes of
Jimmy Powers and the Angel City Four or Alaura Kingsley spoon-feed
ing her husband as he lies immobilized in an iron lung.
As genres, film noir and the musical are about as different from each
other as left is from right. Film noir is ice-cold and cynical. 1 he closest to
a happy ending that film noir gets is not having everybody die at the end,
and even then the survivors are usually unhappy to be alive. The musi-1
cal, on the other hand, has to be uplifting at the very least. No death is I
(pointless and no life will be destroyed unless sugared with a necessary I
amount of nobility. Even if the suffering is immense and the waste ofi
| human life intolerable, there's always room for the big final number. 1
The attempt of "City of Angels" to force film noir to obey the rules ofi
1 the musical is a drama

lin itself. Campbell
1
I pointed out, "For this
I play we researched a lot
I of film noir films; no
-1 body would ever sing a
I song." Eventually the
| film noir has to acqui
| esce to the musical.
Even in the first pages
I of the script there are
| forebodings of the film
1 noir's eventual collapse
| when we see that Harlan
| Yamato, the county
I coroner, is a singing role.
| The film starts off dark
| ly enough in a morgue,
introducing Stone on
I his deathbed with a bul
let in his shoulder. Bit by
bit, however, the musi
cal seeps into the noir el
ements. When consid
ering Alaura Kingsley's
offer, Stone turns to the
audience and sings, "I
might be willingly de
ceived / 'Cause I can
trust myself around
her / Even less than I can
trust her / But even so I
need the dough." The
lyrics might be film noir,

but the singing private
eye certainly is not.
The disintegration continues when Stone visits Alaura at her man
sion. Where "Double Indemnity" had a conversation full of double en
tendres, Alaura and Stone sing "The Tennis Song." The repartee in"The
Tennis Song" has one meaning for sure; I don't know whether you could
rightfully discern two: Alaura: "1 like to work up a sweat." Stone: "And you
just can't get enough /... 1 may lack form and finesse / But I'll warm up
in a jiff." Alaura: "It's not exciting unless / The competition is stiff."
When Stone discovers Mallory in his bed, the conventions of film
noir demand sexual and dramatic tension. Instead, Mallory launches
into the finger-snapper "Lost and Found," which contains perhaps the

best lyric of the play: "And though Daddy told you to turn me in / Why
don't 1 turn you on instead?"
The tension between the two genres in "City of Angels" is resolved by
turning the film noir plot into a delicious parody. The private-eye film
is perhaps one ot the most frequently and lazily parodied genres at the
moment, but "City of Angels" pulls it off.
The acting in the film noir segments neatly parodies the style of I 940s
films without making the characterizations too obvious. There might
be an element of Bogart in Wright's portrayal of Stone, but at the same
time Stone's voice comes from the narrator of the Batman audiocas
sette stories that Wright listened to as a child.
The offbeat style ot the crime novel is taken to the extreme and quick
ly becomes comically absurd: "$ 10,000. Next to M rs. Kingsley's this was
the nicest figure in the room." It can also become self-conscious and
heavy at times ("L.A., truth to tells not much different from a girl with
the clap"), but on the whole the film noir world keeps itself sharp and
entertaining.
Whereas most art forms these days are happy to merely sup- j
ply symbols, leaving it to the audience to link them up and I
then pat themselves on the back for interpreting the artist's
message correctly, the musical takes no such chances. II
there is ever any subtlety in a musical, then it is generally
subtlety dressed in a luminous green shirt, with "SUB TLETY" written
iall over it, hitting itself over the head with a hammer and shouting,
"Look at me! I'm subtlety, I'm subtlety!" There is no way you can es-1
cape understanding what "City of Angels" is about.
First, we are asked to consider the relationship between the artist and j
the characters he or she creates. In The New York 'Times, country singer i
Kinky Friedman philosophically declared," 'City of Angels' may be set I
in the forties in Flollywood, but the excruciatingly empty pages Stone

•"• *•"» •■■ * •"•■/ w,v v " v * mv,m
must fill to imbue Stone with a mandatory Marlow-like loneliness
; could be pages out of any of our lives."
The musical employs a number of devices to make this clear to us.
When Stine revises his script, the characters in the film noir world
; freeze, do the scene in reverse and then do a revised version. Later
I Gabby (Stine's wife, played by Natausha Wilson) and Oolie (Stone's
secretary, played by Hillary Stamm), simultaneously sing about how
Stine and his fictional creation are equally hopeless at understanding
| women. If there is still any doubt, by the end of the first act Stine and
Stone are singing "You're Nothing without Me" to each other.
Jeff Tabaco, who plays the crooner Jimmy Powers, explains: "If we
| were just to say 'You're Nothing without Me,' it could get lost and di
" luted among everything else that gets said. Instead this line gets sung
I and reprised, and the point gets made."
The play also asks us to consider the lure of money and the negative

effect that it has on artistic integrity. Stine's novel contains a Chicano
character named Murio/ (Jason Alisharan), who, outraged over the fact
that Stone was apparently able to get away with murder on account of his
skin color, vowed to put Stone behind bars. Again, in case we might miss
it, the point is sung to us. The song, which contains such lyrics as "You've
never been my fav'rite / Gringo / In my native lingo / Adios / The end is
close," is the best proof I've ever heard of Voltaire's dictum that anything
too silly to be said can always be sung.
Naturally, producer Buddy Fidler wants to cut
the "social crap" and, of course, a smattering of , - -

...V UMVI,
Mc( larthyism is thrown in as a part of Fidlers evil
Hollywood logic. In a sense, though, "City of An
gels" is not so different from Fidler, it is as com
pulsory to include a racial statement in the 1990s
as it was to exclude it in the 19405. If the musical
is going to make a message, it's not going to take
any risks in getting the audience to notice it.
Director John Chakan, a senior, has chosen
to downplay the message segments of "City of
Angels."
"The play pokes fun at Stine for being the
stereotypical artist with integrity as much as it
pokes fun at Buddy," he said. "We've tried to
keep the show as apolitical as possible."
This is probably the correct approach for the
Stanford campus, which is likely to react cyni
cally to some of the show's heartfelt messages.
This production has chosen to playfully satire
just about everybody in it, making it witty
where it might have been heavy and leaden.
There are other respects in which it is proba

bly wise for "(lity of Angels" to resist interpreta
tion. For example, Donna's (Nudity's secretary) reflection on why she is
always used by men — "I'm solely to blame /... I'm my own worst
enemy" — sounds as it the rationale of a rapist has been forced into her
mouth. People might read a negative message into the fact that Stine is
played by a black man, whereas his fantasy double, Stone, is white. I low
ever, to read anything too significant into this play is to misinterpret it.
The casting decisions were authentically 'color-blind,' and the sexism
should be seen as quoting the attitudes of either the I l M()s or film noir it
self. "This play refuses to take itself seriously," said (lampbell.
The musical isat its best when it unpretentiously goes for pure enter
tainment. After all, that's what the songs are there for. "It's impossible to
separate the songs from the show and still have the same show," t 'hakan
said. "The songs are so good. You can't expect to have anything left that
could stand up dramatically if you take the songs away."
Although some people in the cast tried to convince me that the songs
were a natural expression of the plot, it seemed to me that it works the other
way around; the plot merely provides excuses for singing and dancing.
That's why musicals are so difficult to parody. It is literally impossible
to come up with subject matter for a musical more absurd than what

Broadway produces, a.s the upcoming musical "Titanic" testifies. This is be
cause the subject matter is irrelevant to the musical's success; it merely provides
the glue that keeps the songs together. The plot might confer some highbrow
status, like when Andrew I Joyd-Webber adapted T.S. I liot poems lor"(ats,"or
it might provide the laughs and the context for the songs, which is wh.it it does
in "(Jty of Angels." I lowever, the plot's main function is to differentiate one
musical from the other. Hven in the musicals that try their hardest to be dark,
bleak artistic statements, there'll always be something to snap your lingers to.
(Carmel Murphy, a 1996 Stanford grad, sees singing and dancing as the per
feet way to express emotion. "I or instance, every time I eat something that is
amazingly tasty, I start to do a little dance in my chair and I hum a little tune
to express my sheer delight," she said. "So, in a musical, we are trying to con
vey extreme emotions through our song and dance."
"(lity of Angels" not only does this successfully but is not afraid ol calling at
tent ion to the ambiguous role of singing in the musical. At one point, buddy I i
dler has to sing so badly it's comic, and yet he is later called upon to sing "The
Buddy System" competently. Buddy I idler the character might be .1 bad singer,
but the actor who is playing him cannot afford to be so untalented. later in the
play Stone visits his girlfriend, Bobbie, who is singing at .1 nightclub. In this
scene, the song Bobbie sings does not represent the emotion ol the character; it
represents a woman singing 011 stage. "(.ity of Angels" is as competent at sell
parody as it is at parody, and that is perhaps the key to its success.
Although I'm not convinced that I'll ever be able to understand the mu
sical, "City of Angels" is definitely accessible. The music is excellent, and the
subject matter is as strong as the music. As junior I lillary Stamm pointed
out, "Hveryone wants to be in a '40s movie. Now we get to be in one, even il
it is on the stage." II
