## Rollins Band "Come In and Burn" 
### 
The new Rollins Band album begins
with the swirling winds of Chris Has
kett's guitar, followed by the mellow
"radio" vocals oft lenry Rollins. "Shame"
is good, but Rollins rarely explodes into
the music with the throat-wrenching
yelling that fans have become accus
tomed to. In 12 songs, Rollins never real
ly gets going; he takes a radically different
approach to singing than in his earlier
works.
As a result, this album takes a lot of
getting used to. At first it comes across as
a bit of a disappointment (more yelling
would've earned the album a fifth star),
but the new sound comes to life in songs
like "All I Want," a tough number about
being acknowledged in the eyes of anoth
er. This was in many ways an essential re
lease for a group that has played as long
as this band, formed in 19H7; it had to do
something fresh in order for the music to
remain original.
In many ways, Rollins' restraint on the
new release fuels the tension of the lyrics.
On "During a ("ity," the vocals simmer
below the boiling point, delivering a true
feeling of frustration. It comes across as
one of Rollins' most convincing songs.
The brutal honesty of Rollins' lyrics
and the manner in which he presents his
material has been the bread and butter of
his music since his early days with Black
Flag. On "Spilling Over the Side," Rollins

bridges the gap with his listeners with the
telling words, "Oh man /1 can't believe
the things I've said to you / hey / I
must've been out of my mind ... my
loneliness / how it hurts and how it
shows."
Rollins Band instrumental have
never sounded better, and this can be at
tributed to the influence of producer
Steve Thompson, who brought an ur
gency to the group by demanding that no
song be given more than four takes in the
studio. Drummer Sim Cain sounds as
brilliant as ever. On "Weight," bassist
Melvin Gibbs was thrust into the studio
without any previous experience with
Rollins, but after constant touring he has

found his niche
in the group.
He proves him
self to be more
than a match
for previous
Rollins bass
player Andrew
Weiss — while
he goes off on
tangents, he
stays within the
boundaries of
Cain and Has
kett.
In "Starve,"
Rollins gets

more aggressive; it is one of the few songs
in which he takes off and hollers the cho
rus. The distorted background music
moves at a 65-mph gallop. "On My Way
to the Cage" has a similar fast paced style.
Unlike previous albums, there are no
blues jam sessions. While it certainly
subtracts from the added artistic element
of the Rollins Band, it results in a tighter
sound. There isn't any dawdling along
the way on the recording — it's all busi
ness. "Come In and Burn" is an excellent
album, but it doesn't quite sound like the
Henry Rollins hard rock listeners have
grown to know and love.
