# Laurie Sargent
## "Heads and Tails" 
### 
Boston-based Laurie Sargent has staked a claim in the rapid
ly growing genre of electric folk neorock with her first solo
album, "I leads and Tails." Tragically, her gutsy melodic vocals
warble over bluesy guitar lines like smooth waves, but they are ut
terly nondescript. This music could be on the recently released
and quite vapid "Party of Five" soundtrack.
Oh, that's right — the first track on this album is on the pre
teen pop TV show's soundtrack. I guess it's fitting that carrot
puree masquerading as rock 'n' roll should appease anyone who

finds real drama in "Party of Five." My housemates agreed that
this is painful to listen to, despite their less-than-discriminating
taste in choice of television shows.
Where is the creativity in this cookie-cutter rock? The track
"Groove Thing" shows a blase lack of insight in its appellation.
Sorry Laurie, hut the metaphors in "Ponies" such as "love is a di
amond" are a little worn out (without lyrics in the liner notes,
we're thankfully not subjected to her trite poetry in written
form).
The distorted guitar work hits nice grooves in "Tractor" and
"Something With The Moon," but in her tough we-are-All-
American-beautiful-people-who-know-how-to-rock-you act,
Sargent does little more than flirt with the guy behind the cap
puccino counter and flip her hair over her shoulder.
This is rock and roll tor children who grew up on VH-1 in
stead of MTV and find their sensibilities offended by anything
heavier than Phil Collins. If you value pseudo-sensitive new-age
relationship rock, this is your album. Otherwise, track down
Laurie Sargent's more genuine pop predecessors like Sarah
McLaughlin and Sheryl Crow.
And if you really want to hear what Sargent is trying to do, lis
ten to women of the '80s like Annie Lennox and Julianna Hat
field. I lock, maybe go back even further to Stevie Nicks and Joni
Mitchell. Because all of those women had some element in their
music that elevates them above the masses of Laurie Sargents —
original artistic expression. That's not such an esoteric secret, is
it?'
