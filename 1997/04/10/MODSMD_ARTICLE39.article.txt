# Grey Eye Glances
## "Eventide" 
### 
It often seems as though there are so many differ
ent sounds out there that the only original thing left
to do is combine existing styles. That's exactly what
(irey Eye Glances has done.
Filled with introspective lyrics channeled by the
beautifully soft voice of Jennifer Nobel, this album is
as calm and soothing as the title "Eventide" suggests,
but at the same time it is upbeat and inspiring, with
the slightest hint of emotional distress in the lyrics.
For example, "Hard" and "Halfway Back" de
scribe the singer's frustration with love and lite in
general while "The Passing of the Evening" presents
feelings of loneliness and estrangement.
Reminiscent of both folk rock and soli pop, the
album integrates acoustic guitar and a variety of other
instruments including organ, piano, strings and syn
thesizer to carry the mood of reflective lyricism
throughout.
"Snow" is a flowing ballad in which Nobel is
backed by piano and intermittent strings. The song

drags a bit but captures wonderfully the subtleties of
a deteriorating relationship and gives a rather Taoist
approach to the situation: "If it starts to snow / well
then it starts to snow / If we feel it go / well we should
let it go."
"In the Company of You" has a funky bass line
supporting an almost country melody and describes
the wanderings of the narrator through different
countries in search of herself.
Despite the honesty of most of the lyrics, some
seem a bit contrived, like in"The Passing of the
Evening": "As I stand here now / where I stood before
/ heard the silent shout and it's so familiar." Still, the
song itself flows well, so that little slip-up can be over
looked.
Nobel's voice, though very pure, is not quite as
powerful as some of the other female vocalists cur
rently topping the charts, but it could still contend
with most of them. The only real problem with this
band is that so many of their songs sound alike that
none really stands out, even though many are superb.
Grey l ; .ye Glances is a group to find when search
ing for some easy listening, but don't expect to be
hearing it on the radio any time soon.
