# RA application figures still high
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The number of applications
for resident assistant posts re
mained high this year, contin
uing last year's trend toward
increased interest in residen
tial programs.
This year, 312 students ap
plied to become RAs, a figure
consistent with last year's
total of 314 but much greater
than the 270 applications re
ceived in 1995.
"I am pleased with the
pool," said Ann Porteus, the
associate director of Residen
tial Education. "When the
numbers are at this level, it is a
reflection on the residential
education program."
Receiving the applications is
the just the beginning of a long
process to select the 165 RAs
for next year, Porteus said.
In the current stage of the
process, applicants have regis
tered using the World Wide
Web, written an essay on their
reasons for applying and com
piled an initial list of prefer
ences for what dorms they
would like to staff.
Porteus said Res Ed does
not keep statistics on which

residences are most popular
with applicants.
"There are so many vari
ables," she said. "Some people
want an all-frosh dorm; some
people want an upperclass
dorm. The applicants are like
the makeup of Stanford stu
dents. They want different ex
periences."
After reading the applica
tions, resident fellows will de
cide which students to bring
back for interviews.
In the final stage of the
process, Res Ed compare lists of
resident fellows preferences
with lists of applicant's prefer
ences in order to determine all
the assignments. Porteus
likened this stage of the process
to the "residency matching
after medical school."
Both sets of lists are due
May 2, and Res Ed will an
nounce the new RAs on May 7.
While just more than half
the applicants will receive po
sitions, Porteus said Res Ed is
trying to ensure that applying
to be an RA is as painless as
possible.
"We are working with resi
dent fellows to keep the
process the least competitive
possible."
