# Karp
## "Self Titled LP" 
### 
It's hard to be a hesher these days — heavy metal's com
mercial viability has dwindled to an almost invisible level,
leaving modern-day metalheads with few musical options.
Sure, there's Marilyn Manson, but metal fans who have
moved beyond scaring their parents may find Manson's NIN
knock-off shock rock unconvincing. Instead, many metal
heads have cut their hair, put the puffy Reeboks and the acid
washed 501 sin the back of the closet and turned to punk
rock.
In the best instances, this collision of musical subcultures
takes place onstage. The musical style that results is an in
spired fusion, a tough, angry hybrid that borrows from both
genres to create a sludgy, powerful sound greater than the

sum of its parts. Olympia, Wash.-based Karp is one of these
bands, blending its obvious admiration for Black Sabbath
era heavy metal with punk's iconoclasm and attitude. Al
though the band is on K Records, home to girlie indie-pop
like Heavenly and the Softies, Karp is well aware ol its hesher
roots — an unnamed bonus track is a hilarious parody of
'SOs-era "the devil wants your soul" speed metal.
Karp's sound is Sabbath-heavy in the fashion of fellow
Northwestern punk-metal purveyors the Melvins, and the
many similarities between the two bands can't be purely acci
dental — Karp's guitarist even sports a gravity-defying afro,
just like the Melvins' guitarist. While Karp is certainly fol
lowing in the Melvins' footsteps, it adds its own ingredients

to the mix.
The Melvins favored slow, sludgy, drawn-out dirges, but
Karp is more aggressive. Songs like "Bacon Industry" pound
along with an almost industrial ferocity. Complexity isn't
completely lost in the onslaught, though: On "Forget the
Minions" and "Octoherfleshed," sonic stylings reminiscent
of Fugazi lurk behind the sludge.
Lyrically, Karp is hard to figure — nothing here has much
of a coherent message or narrative, but couplets like "round
the cops up the vampires are feeding / ("aptain Crunch of the
little men's teeth" are poetic in an oblique way, perhaps even
as heavily veiled social commentary.
