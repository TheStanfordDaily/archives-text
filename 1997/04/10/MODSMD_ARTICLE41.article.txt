# Dinosaur Jr.
## "Hand It Over" 
### 
The vocals don't sound quite as pop-friendly as 1 )inosaur Ir.'s
1994 "Without a Sound," and the songs are definitely less struc
tured. "Hand It Over" is more extreme and gutsy, hut this end is
attained through sloppy songwriting. All tin) often there doesn't
seem to be much point or direction to the music.
J. Mascis does it all. As the singer, guitarist, drummer and
songwriter Mascis uses "1 land It Over" to demonstrate his vari
ous talents instead of pushing each song. A number ol surpris
ing instruments are used in the album, including banjo and
trumpet. This is typical: Dinosaur Jr. songs are unique — they
don't quite lit into the classification of mainstream or under
ground contemporary rock.
l or instance, the unconventional "Never Bought It" is a com
position ofwhiney, off-key duet vocals with Kevin Shields, a solt
tlute and an impatient, blurry guitar solo.
Passionate guitar is the foundation ol all I)inosaur )r. music.
Like all great players of the instrument, Mascis utilizes his guitar
as a means of emotional expression. I lis rhythm guitar is nearly
indistinguishable from his lead; it is a blend of unpredictable
highs and lows, jazz improv and screeching aggression.
Percussion plays a key role in "Without A Sound," and this is
incorporated into Mascis' new material as well. A magnificent
sense of timing accompanies the wry singing. The cymbals arc
crashed frequently, punctuating the most powerful verses of the
songs, while the drum rolls are wild and spontaneous. Mascis'

drums seem to adopt a voice of their own throughout the album, cry
ingand yelling along with the lyrics.
The creative element of Dinosaur Jr.cannot be understated, yet the
songs themselves are sometimes difficult to listen to since they confuse
the ear: These songs aren't catchy. Mascis rips apart all alternative rock
norms, leaving behind a scattered trail of debris in the form of broken

up guitar rifls and obtuse vocals. Mis original expressions would be
better served by less vocal murmuring and whispering.
"Hand It Over" would improve as a collection ol songs il Mast is
played by the rules, but ol course in doing so he would sacrifice thai
which sets him apart.
