## The 						Saint 
### 
Seventy years ago, a British author named Leslie Charteris introduced a character
named Simon Templar, a.k.a. The Saint. Templar became so popular that Charteris' sto
ries evolved into a series of films and a '60s television series starring Roger Moore. Now
the character has been revitalized for the '90s in the Paramount picture "The Saint."
The movie begins by giving us a look at Templar's childhood in an orphanage in
Hong Kong, where a series of traumatic events shapes his future. Then we are swept to
modern-day Russia, where Templar (Val Kilmer) has become a man of a thousand faces
who takes the names of Catholic saints during his travels and has more cool toys than
Batman.
Moreover, Templar has the ability to break into the most heavily guarded places; ergo
his infamy as a professional thief. His goal is to earn a total of $50 million before he quits
the business altogether. He gets his big chance when he is hired by Ivan Tretiak (Rade
Serbedzija), a wealthy Russian industrialist who hungers for political power.
Tretiak intends to create turmoil in Russia by exploiting a formula for cold fusion, a
new type of energy generation. He sends Templar after Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue),
the scientist who invented it. Naturally, Templar falls in love with Russell instead and
decides to help her escape Tretiak. As she unlocks the secrets of his past, he finds him
self making the personal journey from sinner to saint.
Kilmer does a reasonably good job of portraying more than a dozen identities. He
manages to be calculating, mysterious and charming all at once. Shue is not so con
vincing; her character is too naive for a romantic nuclear physicist. But when the two
arc together, their chemistry is so explosive that it can be distracting.
The action in this movie is very involving, but I wasn't too pleased with the screen
writing. The dialogue in some places is pretty dry: "Too bad we have to kill him" —
"Yeah, too bad." There's too much of an effort to make the plot interesting and compli
cated; characters and plotlines are introduced and dropped from all sides. And the end

ing just won't, well, end.
"The Saint" is a fun movie that's worth seeing on the big screen. It you like films with
classic heroes, technological novelties and cosmopolitan intrigue, you won't want to
miss it. Just don't expect any big explosions.
