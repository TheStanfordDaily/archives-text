# Inventing the Abbotts
## 
### 
I love any excuse to remind my nostalgic, critical-of-the-contemporary elders that them good
ol' days weren't always so damn good.
Set in the 19505, "Inventing the Abbotts" does just that. It reveals the dark underbelly of our
safe, small-town Americana past: its sexual repression, male domination and blatant classism.
All this is wrapped up in a bittersweet love story. Make that five love stories occurring between
two inextricably bound and split families, with healthy portions of sibling rivalry and parent
child conflict served on the side.
The story is told through a retrospective "Wonder Years"-esque narration hv Doug Holt
(Joaquin Phoenix), the local social delinquent. Doug is the coolest kind of rebel, in addition to
being completely socially naive. Unable to read the subtext, Doug doesn't realize that his per

ceived identity is that of a "poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks." But his older, slicker
brother, Jacey (Billy Crudup), is painfully aware of their status. He takes revenge on the world by
being a playboy — effectively making even us female audience members swoon.
Both of these working-class boys manage to involve themselves with the most fancy-schman
cy uppercrust family in town, the Abbotts — unaware that the three Abbott daughters' bodies
might as well be considered property of their family patriarch. Thus conflicts abound and a

menagerie of sexual dysfunction from
nymphomania to prudishness emerge.
But thankfully the movie doesn't just rely on
titillation for kicks. What makes it compelling is
the intimate focus on the characters, their rela
tionships and the way they develop. They're all
convincingly complex in addition to being to
tally messed up — with the exception of Mrs.
Helen Holt (Kathy Baker), the boys' widowed
mother who provides a refreshing down-to
earthiness amid the storm of dementia.
Baker's performance, along with those of the
predominately young and red-hot cast, is com
mendable — except for Liv Tyler, who plays the
youngest Abbott daughter, Pam. Not only is her
character an annoying goody-two-shoes, but
her whiny and sulky portrayal is so uninspired
that I was unable to buy into the possibility that
there was any genuine emotion lurking under
neath.
What I liked about this film was its cogent
critique of social structures that construe pas
sionate relations as dark and dirty problems
rather than celebrations. But what I didn't like
was that this film ultimately celebrates a rather
dull romance, leaving the more interesting pos
sibilities by the wayside.
