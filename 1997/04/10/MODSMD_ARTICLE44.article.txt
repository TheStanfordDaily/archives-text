# Grosse Pointe Blank
## 
### 
One would think that a movie with John Cusack as its co
producer, co-writer and star would be a pretty sure thing. With
winners such as "Say Anything," "Better Off Dead" and the
more serious "The Gritters" and "City Hall" under his belt, Cu
sack seems to be the kind of actor who can do no (or very little)
wrong. Whether playing dramatic or comedic roles, Cusack is
typically successful in his uniquely funny, quirky and endearing
way.
Well, "Grosse Pointe Blank" definitely has the quirky thing
down.
The film tells the story of hi red-assassin Martin Blank (Cu
sack), who, after much prodding from his dutiful secretary
(played in typically hilarious form by Cusack's sister, Joan),
travels back to his quiet, suburban hometown of Grosse
Pointe, Mich., for his 10-year high school reunion. While
there, Blank intends to address a number of issues in his past;
these include reuniting with his mother and the potential
"great love of his life," Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he stood
up on prom night (in a $750 dress, no less) to join the army.
None of these reunions, of course, occur quite as intended.
Making things even more complicated is the fact that Blank
must carry out one last hit while in Grosse Pointe, both with
out Debis knowledge and despite the homicidal interference

of his archrival (Dan Aykroyd).
Despite the fact that the movie has the potential to be a good
black comedy, it just ends up being totally bizarre. Adding to
this is the fact that the film apparently never made it into edit
ing, as overhead microphones and other props are übiquitous,

at times even popping up in intimate
scenes between Martin and Debi. by the
end of the movie, the constant presence of
microphones had almost become a part of
the movie's random, weird atmosphere.
Driver's performance doesn't make
matters any better. Struggling to mask her
Irish accent, Driver transforms her voice
into a nasal monotone. She's supposed to
be endearing with the sassy, girlish things
she does, like jump on her bed and ask
Martin to give her "airplane rides," but re
ally we just want to slap her and tell her to
grow up.
The funny thing is, "Grosse Pointe
Blank" isn't a bad movie. It just doesn't
quite work — which is a shame because the
radio preview is really funny. Yes, Cusack

gives a solid performance, complete with the "Say Anything"
esque rapid speech and blank facial expressions, but it's not
enough to save "Grosse Fointe Blank" from being a second-rate
attempt at black comedy.
