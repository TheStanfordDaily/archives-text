# When We Were Kings

### 
"Ali, kill him!" the people of Zaire
cheer as Muhammed Ali prepares to
knock George Foreman out of his heavy
weight title on October 30, 1974. This day
marks Ali's successful recapture of the
crown he lost after refusing military ser
vice in Vietnam because of his religious
beliefs. This year's Oscar winner for best
documentary feature, "When We Were
Kings" sizzles as an in-depth look at the
main players of the famous 1974 "Rumble
in the Jungle."
The cast includes a charismatic, self
assured and playful Ali, his formidable
opponent George Foreman, host and dic
tator President Joseph Mobutu of Zaire,
promoter Don King (and his famous hair)
and singers 8.8. King and James Brown,
who performed at the event. This rare
1970s coverage is mixed with insightful
present-day interviews with Spike Lee
(who was 11 at the time at the time of the
tight); Norman Mailer and George Plimp

ton, who both covered the 1974 match;
and Ali biographer Thomas Hauser.
The film itself has an interesting cre
ation story. Due to financial and litigation
problems, director Leon Gast was unable
to complete the film he had shot in 1974.
In 1995, director Taylor Hackford un
earthed and recut the original and added
the present-day interviews. Unfortunate
ly, Ali, who has Parkinson's disease, was
not interviewed for the film.
"When We Were Kings" turns a boxing
match into a black struggle for indepen
dence and unity. By holding the fight in
Africa, both Ali and King felt they could
give black Americans a sense of home
pride and, by so doing, fight racial preju
dice. In the film, Ali calls it the "first as
sembly of all black people.... Plus I'll
whup George Foreman's ass." The music
of James Brown and 8.8. King is smooth
ly juxtaposed with that of their African
counterparts, and Don King philoso

phizes about multiculturalism. This re
turn to roots represents Ali's dream not
only as fighter but as a role model to all
blacks.
Ali comes off as genuine, strong and
entertaining. 1 ie tells the children to live a
clean life, not to use drugs and to quit eat
ing so much candy. (At this point, he
shows the camera his cavities and be
moans Mr. Tooth Decay). He talks poli
tics, music and black pride. He urges the
need for black Americans to have a
knowledge of self apart from white Amer
ica.
As Spike Lee notes in his interview, Ali
fused politics with sports. "When Wc
Were Kings" beautifully reflects this fu
sion, portraying Ali and those around
him with unparalleled vividness and in
tensity. This is a must see history lesson
involving many compelling members of
the civil rights era.
