## KILLER B MOViES 
### 
Ever go to Blockbuster on a Friday night and not
find anything interesting to watch? In the world of
mainstream movies, there are the romances, the
tearjerkers, the Schwart/eneggcr types, the dilet
tante classics and maybe a foreign film or two.
These are great films if you want to be immersed

in another world, but sometimes the mood calls for
distanced spectatorship (and criticism). Where are
the unprofitable but absolutely knockout B
movies? You know, the kind that are so stupid you
die laughing and still remember who you are,
where you are and who you are sitting next to — as
opposed to watching a heavy flick like "The English
Patient" and coming out of the dark totally dazed.
The following are some of my favorite picks.
Before Jim Carrey made it big, he got a bit part
playing Death in "High Strung" ( 1491). This ran

dom comedy is about 'Inane (Steve Oedekerk), a chil
dren's book writer who complains so much about every
thing that even Death is tired of him. Thane's expressions
of utter annoyance are so frank and obnoxious that they
are difficult to describe precisely in so short of a space.
Suffice to say that if you are a Carrey, Mel Brooks or
"Naked dun" fan, this is definitely the B movie of choice
tor you.
We've all heard about "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!''
( but most of us have probably passed judgment on
it without actually having seen it. This low-budget come
dy/ horror/ musical show opens with bloodthirsty toma
toes crawling out of an average American housewife's

garbage disposal. According to director John De Bello,
"Many familiar cliches of the science-fiction genre are
parodied and a few musical numbers are included."
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" has enough prestige (or
lack thereof) to be deemed a cult classic. There's also "Re
turn of the Killer Tomatoes!" (198H), "Killer Tomatoes

Strike Back!" (1990) and
' "Killer Tomatoes Eat
I France" (1991) for your
viewing pleasure.

"Plan 9 from Outer
Space" (1958) is your typical bad sci-fi horror flick from
famed director of tacky cult classics Ed Wood. In this
movie, aliens land on Earth in (lying saucers (paper
plates) and proceed to implement Plan 9 to conquer the
planet. (Plans 1 through 8 didn't work. Darn.) "Plan 9
from Outer Space" won the Double Golden Turkey Award
for worst film and worst directing of all time.
"Santa Glaus Conquers the Martians" (1964, a.k.a.
"Santa Claus Defeats the Aliens") has a title too hilarious
to pass up. Santa Claus is captured by martians and trans
ported to the red planet to stop Earth kids from being
cheerful. Once on Mars, he teaches the martian kids
about the real meaning of Christmas. A pair of Earth kids
are also involved in helping solve some martian family
problems. A low budget and total stupidity are the key
themes to this Hick, a favorite with "Mystery Science The
ater 3000" fans.
So if you're looking for something refreshingly differ
ent to watch but are sick of Monty Python reruns (which
are too intellectual to be called B movies anyway), check
out the hole-in-the-wall video stores across the street
from big daddy Blockbuster and have a good laugh at
some of the best worst movies ever made.

Martian kids look a lot like Earth kids in costume.
