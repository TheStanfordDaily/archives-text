# Fish Market at the Fillmore
## LEFTOVER SALMON SERVES UP A ZIPPY BLUEGRASS TREAT 
### 
Two nights of high-energy, polyethnic
Cajun slamgrass went down at the Fillmore
Auditorium in San Francisco this weekend as
Leftover Salmon look the stage. This 5-year
old hand from Boulder, Colo., left the planet
Farth behind with four sets of stripped down
hluegrass and spacey jams, taking plenty of
friends along.
What is polyethnic Cajun slamgrass? The
hand invented the label in an attempt to give
order to the divine entropy of their music —
a combination of rock, blues, pop, hluegrass,
Cajun, /.ydeco and Celtic genres rolled into a
tasty musical burrito. Composed of Vince
I lerinan on vocals and guitar, Drew Fmmitt
on vocals, guitar, mandolin and violin, Mark
Vann on banjo and rubber fish, Tye North on
bass and Michael Wooten on drums, Salmon
thrashes upstream through the crystal river of
speedy hluegrass music. Sitting in at the Fill
more shows on piano and accordion was Pete
Sears of Jefferson Airplane fame.
A fantastic combination of stage presence
and technical skill makes Leftover Salmon a
worthwhile live act. 1 lerinan masterfully en
gages the crowd with spontaneous greetings
like "Hoy howdy!" and encourages other
band members with ridiculous stage antics.

On Friday night, the band played with famed

'60s activist Wavy
Gravy, who joined the
band on kazoo and air
guitar with a stuffed orca
whale. Herman's rant
ing vocals are balanced
by Fmmitt's well

trained voice on long, pop
influenced ballads.
Friday's show opened with the /yde
co "Zombie Jamboree," followed by the
wacky medley "Green Thing / Whiskey

for Breakfast / Going Over the Water
fall." Fmmitt broke the set open with
fierce electric slide mandolin on "Do

the Boogie," promptly slaved it with
"Blue Night" and redeemed himself
with the beautiful "Whispering Wa

ters." The set ended with the up
tempo "Bettab" from Salmon's
third album, "Euphoria."

After the amazing "4:20 Polka,"
guitarist Buddy Wolf and man
dolin ist Danny Nicely from the (
opening band, McGraw Gap,

joined the boys on stage and provided a 45
minute lesson in the esoteric secrets of slam

grass. The crowd appreciated the fierce open

ing set the Virginia band pro
vided and was excited to sec

it onstage with Salmon.
Salmon et al fired up with
the bluesy "Reuben's
Train," and with eight mu

sicians on stage, they powered
through classics like "Rocky Top," "Cat
fish John" and "Sitting on Top of the
World." The band ended with the a
cappella encore "Rise Up."
Saturday night began with blazing
electric guitar from Fmmitt, who
broke strings on the intense pop-rock
tune "River's Rising." The set contin
ued with ecstatic midtempo blues.
Herman made a thoughtful dedica
tion to the poet Allen Ginsberg, who
died earlier that day, and launched
hopefully into the upbeat "Get Me
Outta This City." The legendary Paul

McCandless joined the band on

stage with an assortment of
penny whistles, pipes and

flutes, and the set ended with a mag
nificent cover of Led Zeppelin's "When the
Levy Breaks," highlighted by Pete Sear's

thrashing piano solo.
Yet another classic-rock cover, Jimi Hen
drix's "Hey Joe," kicked offset two. The crowd
kept dancing as more gems followed: "Muddy
Water Home," "Hot Burrito Breakdown," and
repeats of "Euphoria" and "Bettah" from the
first night. Wolf, Nicely and banjo player Will
Lee joined the band for an uptempo version of
the traditional "Salty Dog," featuring dueling
banjos (Vann and Lee), dueling guitars (Her
man and Wolf) and dueling mandolins (Em
mitt and Nicely). The set closed with Emmitt's
powerful vocals belting out "Reach," and the
encore was another "Rise Up" that ended with
McCandless and Sears playing a sweet duet
while the crowd sang.
Leftover Salmon's diversity of sound is a
large part of their growing success. Herman
dons the occasional washboard while Emmitt
sometimes uses a special effect that makes his
mandolin sound like a steel drum. But what
most attracts the crowd is the positive vibe. As
summer rolls around, the band is getting
ready for festival season, and you'll be able to
catch some Salmon at the Telluride Bluegrass
Festival in Colorado and the High Sierra
Music Festival in California in late July.
