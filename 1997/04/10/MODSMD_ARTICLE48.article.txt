I do it. You do it. Even our parents and
teachers do it Almost all of us do it But it's
against the law. No, I'm not talking about
smoking pot. I'm talking about "unauthorized
reproduction."
Unauthorized reproduction, distribution
or exhibition of any copyrighted material is a
federal crime.
Ever photocopied a page from a library
book?
When was the last time you made a music
mix for a friend?
How much of the software on your hard
drive have you really purchased?
None of us see ourselves as criminals, but
after reading the above questions, we must

admit that we are guilty of criminal copyright
infringement. It's against the law to duplicate
or exhibit copyrighted material without the ex
plicit permission of the copyright owner. So
how is it that we rationalize our crimes and
maintain a pure image of ourselves as honest,
upstanding citizens?
One way of justifying information theft is
by assuring ourselves that our copying is for
personal use and not for commercial profit.
After all, we aren't selling the copies we make so
what's wrong with making just one eensy
weensy little copy?
Another excuse depicts information as
immaterial —we don't treat information as a
physical commodity that can be picked up

and stolen. Copying a tape is just not the
same thing as shoplifting one from the store,
so how can The Man up on Capitol Hill say
this is theft?
Still another absolution of information
theft is one in which we call our crime a politi
cal protest. Those of us who take issue with the
concept of art or media being a form of prop
erty can take solace in the fact that we are re
fusing to patronize the blood-sucking enter
tainment corporations that distribute the art
we copy.
Just because something is against the law
doesn't imply that it is ethically wrong. Most of
us would agree that plagiarism is indeed a
crime. What makes it wrong is the fact that the

plagiarizer is taking credit lor another's work,
not the fact that there is an unauthorized copy
being made.
think about this. According to the law,
any Schmo who's making some mix tapes for
his friends must attain a record company's per
mission for each song he tapes and distributes.
Obeying the law in this case shafts both the
record company and the Schmo with a logisti
cal nightmare.
The bottom line is that nobody cares about
prosecuting this crime. Go figure. So why am I
writing a column about it? I'm a loser baby, so
why don't you kill me? Then you really would
be prosecuted for something on the federal
level! Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
