## David Harris reflects on student activism 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
When David Victor Harris
won a landslide victory as ASSU
president in the spring of 1966,
nobody was as stunned as he
was. The long-haired, bearded
anti-war activist bore no resem
blance to the more crisply-

dressed and clean-shaven candidates who usu
ally held the position.
For the next 30 years, Harris, who graduat
ed from Stanford in1967 with a bachelor's in so
cial thought, constantly challenged the status
quo in a political career that embodied 1960s
student radicalism. While married to folk
singer Joan Baez, Harris was imprisoned for '20
months for refusing to serve in the Vietnam
War.
Harris, now a respected journalist and
writer, returns to the Stanford campus tonight,
to offer his reflections on student activism.
Harris neither expected nor wanted to win
the ASSU election in spring 1966.
"I looked on student politics as a lame enter
prise of guys who were trying to apprenticeship
their way into congress and the legislature,"
Harris said. His intention was to force the other
candidates to address the issues that he consid
ered important.
A Daily editorial in 1967 reported that Har
ris' election was "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has been sub
tly brewing within the Stanford community the
past few years."
Harris seemed an unlikely candidate for
such a radical career. When he first arrived at
Stanford a fresh-faced frosh in 1963, he had

just been named Fresno High School Hoy of the
Year. Harris once dreamed of attending West
point, the military academy, was on the high
school football team and won laurels as a de
bater.
Harris' high school idealism was shattered
when he joined the civil rights campaign in Mis
sissippi in his sophomore year and witnessed
the "egregiousness of people of color being
lynched for registering to vote," he said.

Other student activists were equally affected
by events around the country.
"We were people who believed in high school
civics," Harris said. "When we discovered it
wasn't true, the 1960s happened."
He brought his new ideas back to campus.
The first issue Harris tackled was the dis
parate treatment of male and female students
