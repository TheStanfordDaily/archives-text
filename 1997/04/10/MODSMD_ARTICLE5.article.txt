## David Harris reflects on student activism 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
When David Victor Harris
won a landslide victory as ASSU
president in the spring of 1966,
nobody was as stunned as he
was. The long-haired, bearded
anti-war activist bore no resem
blance to the more crisply-

dressed and clean-shaven candidates who usu
ally held the position.
For the next 30 years, Harris, who graduat
ed from Stanford in1967 with a bachelor's in so
cial thought, constantly challenged the status
quo in a political career that embodied 1960s
student radicalism. While married to folk
singer Joan Baez, Harris was imprisoned for '20
months for refusing to serve in the Vietnam
War.
Harris, now a respected journalist and
writer, returns to the Stanford campus tonight,
to offer his reflections on student activism.
Harris neither expected nor wanted to win
the ASSU election in spring 1966.
"I looked on student politics as a lame enter
prise of guys who were trying to apprenticeship
their way into congress and the legislature,"
Harris said. His intention was to force the other
candidates to address the issues that he consid
ered important.
A Daily editorial in 1967 reported that Har
ris' election was "indicative of the deep transi
tion in thought and attitude that has been sub
tly brewing within the Stanford community the
past few years."
Harris seemed an unlikely candidate for
such a radical career. When he first arrived at
Stanford a fresh-faced frosh in 1963, he had

just been named Fresno High School Hoy of the
Year. Harris once dreamed of attending West
point, the military academy, was on the high
school football team and won laurels as a de
bater.
Harris' high school idealism was shattered
when he joined the civil rights campaign in Mis
sissippi in his sophomore year and witnessed
the "egregiousness of people of color being
lynched for registering to vote," he said.

Other student activists were equally affected
by events around the country.
"We were people who believed in high school
civics," Harris said. "When we discovered it
wasn't true, the 1960s happened."
He brought his new ideas back to campus.
The first issue Harris tackled was the dis
parate treatment of male and female students

in University housing. Female un
dergraduates were forced to live
on campus for the duration of
their studies and had a 10 p.m.
curfew.
Men, on the other hand, were
only required to live on campus
during their freshman year and
did not have to abide by a curfew.
If a woman stayed out all night in
a male dorm, she was suspended
from Stanford, while nothing hap
pened to the man.
Harris organized a rent-strike
to protest these conditions, but it
was a dismal failure.
"Although there was a strong
core of women helping us to orga
nize the rent strike in the first
place," he said, "most women were
just much too intimidated at that

point to do something as risky as
refusing to pay their rent. "
The failure of the campaign was
a crushing political blow for Har
ris, who desperately needed to
prove to the University adminis
tration that he could back up his
agenda with action.
"We were ahead of our time.
Clearly, history vindicated my po
sition. This dorm," he said while
sitting in Lagunita, "is far beyond
anything we ever proposed — men
and women living together on the
same floor."
Other ideas that Harris was
fighting for — such as increased
student input on curriculum, the
capacity to design individual study
programs and the introduction of
pass / fail options — also failed to
get past the administration during
his presidency but have since been
adopted by the University.
"Clearly, a lot of stuff we were
talking about was eminently rea

sonable, enough so that it can now
be taken for granted," Harris said.
"I think we helped make Stanford
what it is today, for better or for
worse."
At a time when protesting
against a war was considered un
patriotic or worse, Harris became
one of the most vocal opponents of
the Vietnam War in the Bay Area.
"When we were organizing, a
demonstration was considered
quite a big deal," Harris said. "It
got considerable attention because
nobody did this type of thing. The
capacity to make an impact — or at
least the illusion of making an im
pact — was immediately available."
For a campus that was not used
to students making waves, Harris'
ASSU presidency was something
of a tidal wave. Stanford adminis
tration would regularly call him to
tell him how much money he was
costing the University as alumni
withdrew donations in disap

proval, he said.
In spring 1967, Harris stepped
down from the presidency to con
centrate on setting up a nonvio
lent anti-war campaign, The Re
sistance. The organization called
on draft-age men to return their
draft cards to the government as
an act of mass noncooperation to
end the Vietnam War. He was
thrown into federal prison himself
between July 1969 and March
1971 for refusing the draft.
It was while he was raising funds
for The Resistance that he met and
fell in love with folk singer Joan
Baez. They were married in 1968,
and their child was born while Har
ris served his prison sentence. But
once he came out of prison, the
marriage faltered.
"It was a creature of the mo
ment," Harris said of the relation
ship. "We were Mr. and Mrs. Six
ties."
In 1976, Harris was defeated as

the Democratic candidate for Con
gress in the Mid-Peninsula Dis
trict. That was his last brush with
official politics.
Since then, Harris has written
three books and is about to em
bark on his fourth. He was a jour
nalist for The New York Times
magazine for 10 years and now
writes for the Rolling Stone as the
global environmental correspon
dent.
Although Harris no longer re
gards himself as an organizer, he
still considers himself a radical,
in the sense that he is continual
ly trying to get to the root of is
sues.

David Victor Harris will discuss
his views in "Reflections on Stu
dent Activism, 1960s to 19905"
tonight at 8 in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge. This is the culmina
tion of a year-long series, "Perspec
tives on Activism."
