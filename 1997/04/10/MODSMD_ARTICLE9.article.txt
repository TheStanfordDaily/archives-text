## Regime 'crumbling' in Zaire Prime minister arrested; Clinton asks dictator to step down 
### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — President Mobutu
Sese Seko had soldiers pull the prime minister off
the streets yesterday as his reign appeared to crum
ble even further. And a rebel leader called a three
day halt in his army's advance to give the president
a chance to abdicate.
The White House, meanwhile, urged Mobutu to
make way for a democratic government, calling his
three-decade dictatorship "a creature of history."
Early today, rebel leader Laurent Kabila said he
will halt his army's advance so Mobutu can respond
to an offer to leave power and withdraw to his home
village.
Rebel forces had all but seized control of Lubuin
bashi, the country's second largest city, Kabila told a
news conference. Hut he said his troops were meet
ing "stiff resistance" from presidential guards units
in the outskirts of the city and that the airport was
not yet secured.
"The sum total is that the city has fallen," Kabila
said in Goma, a major city in eastern Zaire.
The Zairian president, who had declared a nation
wide state of emergency on Tuesday in response to
rebel advances, named an army general as the new
prime minister. Gen. Likulia Bolongo had previous
ly served Mobutu as defense minister and army chief
of staff.
Likulia promised a crackdown on civil liberties,
saying his primary goal was"the restoration of pub
lic order."
The four-star general, dressed in his army uni

form and surrounded by four other officers, did not
elaborate on the crackdown at a news conference,
but said measures would b<> taken against the news
media if they published articles that "affected the
morale of the military."
Several foreign journalists, including an Associat
ed Press photographer and AI'TV cameraman, were
beaten and had their cameras stolen by soldiers dur
ing an anti-government, demonstrat ion yesterday.
Last week, political parties allied against Mobutu
named Ktienne Tshisekedi as their choice for prime
minister. Mobutu accepted his nomination in what
was seen as a ploy to weaken t he opposition by split
ting it between Tshisekedi's supporters and those
ready to join Kabila.
Tshisekedi is revered in Zaire for the suffering he
endured during his decades of opposition to Mobutu.
Since his appointment, he had moved to undermine
Mobutu by ordering parliament dissolved, annulling
the constitution and offering Cabinet posts to the
rebels.
The opposition lawmakers who had nominated
him said he had gone too far, and they joined Mobu
tu supporters in calling for his ouster. Yesterday,
Tshisekedi tried to lead thousands of supporters to
the prime minister's office to assume control.
Walking in the huge crowd with his hand raised
in a victory salute, Tshisekedi confronted a row of
soldiers backed by troops in armored personnel car
riers. The showdown took place near a monument to
peace and freedom erected in a traffic circle.
