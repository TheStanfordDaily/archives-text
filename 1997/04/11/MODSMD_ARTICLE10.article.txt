## President promises to place 10,000 welfare recipients into federal jobs

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton claimed credit yester
day for chopping welfare rolls by
20 percent over the last four years
and promised to shave even more
by putting 10,000 welfare recipi
ents into federal jobs, including a
half-dozen at the White House.
The first 2,000 hires are to start
work by Oct. 1.
"If we give people who are on

welfare the opportunity, they will
do the rest, helping us to break the
cycle of dependence and make
responsibility a way of life," Clin
ton said at the start of a Cabinet
meeting convened to review agen
cy-by-agency recruitment plans.
"We have all got to take respon
sibility to see that the jobs are
there."
Two former welfare mothers

with budding careers at the Social
Security Administration stood at
Clinton's side as Vice President Al
Gore outlined the goals of the 100-
plus participating federal agencies:
the Defense Department plans to
hire 1,600 over four years; the
Social Security Administration,
600; and Veterans Affairs, 800.
"These will not be make-work
jobs," Clinton insisted. "These will

be jobs that actually need to be ful
filled and work that needs to bo
done for the American people."
The announcement of govern
ment hiring goals, which Clinton
first ordered last month, was
timed to coincide with the release
of administration data indicating
that about 2.7(5 million people
have gotten off the welfare rolls
since January 1993 â€” from 14.12
million recipients to 11.36 million
recipients, or a 20 percent drop.
"The welfare rolls have now
declined by as much in the past
four years as they increased in the
previous 25 years," the president
said, crediting federally approved
state welfare experiments and the
generally stronger economy.
In its four years in power, the
Clinton administration has grant
ed waivers to 43 states, allowing
them to implement their own wel
fare changes.
According to Department of
Health and Human Services data,
only Alaska, California, Hawaii
and the District of Columbia
showed a caseload increase, with
Hawaii's welfare rolls increasing
by 20 percent.
Resisting talk of quotas, presi
dential spokesman Mike MeCurry
said the jobs initiative was an out
reach program that "set aside and
targeted" certain positions for peo
ple trying to get off the dole.
"We make no apologies for mak
ing federal employment opportuni
ties available for these types of
people," MeCurry said. "They are
the poorest of the poor."
Many of the job opportunities
were only temporary: 4,200 of
the slots were designated at the
Commerce Department, which
needs help preparing for the
2000 census.
