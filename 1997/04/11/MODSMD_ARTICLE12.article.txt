On Sunday, appreciate
the Stanfords — even
despite their faults

Most Stanford students
respond with a certain
decree of pride when asked
where they go to school. It's a kind
of pride that comes with the Stan
ford name, a name recognized
around the world.
Hut long before that name
belonged to generations of students,
it belonged to the Stanford family
— Leland and Jane and their son,
Leland Jr., whose death from
typhoid fever prompted his parents
to found the University. Members of
the Stanford community should be
grateful to the Stanfords for, among
other things, that name.
In recognition of our debt to the
Stanfords, the University has orga
nized a Founders' Day celebration
for Sunday, a day-long event com
plete with singers, Leland and Jane
look-alikes and that rarest of phe
nomena, a free lunch. While the fes
tivities promise fun, Founders' Day
should also allow the entire Stan
ford community a rare opportunity
to experience the uniqueness of the
University's history.
Stanford has been celebrating
Founders' Day since 1891, although
back then it was a day intended only
to honor and remember Leland Jr.
Now, the day is dedicated to remem
bering the whole Stanford family —
a commemoration that could pro
voke immediate ambivalence but is
nevertheless necessary.
It's true that Sen. Leland Stan
ford was, at best, a controversial
character. The Stanfords lived in a
time when big businesses, or rather
their leaders, had unquestionable
power — power that, to a large
extent, they abused. Like the Rock
efellers, the Carnegies and the Van
derbilts, the Stanford name was a
household name, and, like the oth
ers, it was one that often inspired

fear as well as respect. Leland
earned this national recognition by
building a transcontinental railroad
— which was built with the virtual
slave labor of Chinese immigrants.
While Leland Stanford's meth
ods were certainly deplorable, at
least he did not use the resultant
wealth to build either a skyscaper
complex or a musical hall in New
York, and he did not use it to build a
manse in Newport. Rather, the sen
ator used his ill-gotten millions to
start Stanford, which began as a
tuition-free institution.
In addition to money, it also took
a tremendous amount of dedication
on the Stanfords' part to found this
institution. When Leland died soon
after the University's founding,
Jane singlehandedly saw Stanford
through its early years. When times
were tough, she went so far as to
create a special "jewel fund" by sell
ing her valuable jewelry to finance
the University's library.
That kind of dedication —
though maybe not to such a degree
— can be seen once again in the
planning that has gone into this
year's celebration. The 14-person
Founders' Day committee, com
posed of faculty, administrators,
staff and both undergraduates and
graduate students, has worked to
ensure that the festivities would
include the entire University com
munity. The Stanford horse car
riage is going to be giving rides in
the Quad. The Mausoleum is going
to be open to the public for the
entire day.(It is, by the way, the only
day each year that people actually
have the opportunity to go inside
the tomb.) And if you do attend that
free picnic in the Quad, you might
even bump into University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper; he'll be there
to listen to the speeches being deliv
ered on the University's past.
So get up a little early on Sunday
morning, and walk to the Mau
soleum. Take in the sunshine and
remember why it is you are here.
Think about the Stanfords. After all
if it weren't for them, where exactly
would you be right now?
