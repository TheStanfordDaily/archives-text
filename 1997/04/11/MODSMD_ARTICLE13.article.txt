Dining hall politics reveal greater societal injustices

I WAS PLEASED to see an article in
'I u end ay's Daily about hashers. But
as a current hasher, I thought the
article painted a hit too cozy a picture of
what it's like to lie a non-student hasher.
If you are able to look a little below the
surface, you can see that Stanford Dining
Services reveals a lot about the inequali
ties and injustices of our society at large.
To begin, why is it that most hashers
have darker skin that the students they
serve? Why is it that most hashers come
from poor neighborhoods, while they
serve students primarily (though not
exclusively) from elite, middle-class
backgrounds? Perhaps we've gotten so
used to seeing this that we don't even
notice it anymore. Apparently Stanford
students' time is much more valuable
than that of high school students from

Redwood City or East Palo Alto. Stan
ford students are busy learning how
t hey can change the world — they don't
have time for frivolous activities like
cooking for themselves, right? Either
that or they're so lazy they'd rather
have minorities doing their dirty work.
Then there's the fact that student
hashers have it far better oft" than non
student ones. Not only are they paid well
more than $2 an hour more than their
non-student coworkers, but they also get
preferential treatment. For instance, why
is it that so many students are cashiers or
head hashers (the more prized jobs)?
When was the hist time you saw a student
bussing trays — a much more difficult
job? I'm sure many reasons can be given
to rationalize all this, but the results are
undeniable — inequalities in the work-

place. Again, one can only suppose that
Stanford students' money and energy are
more valuable than non-students.
As a current hasher, I see how hard
the non-Stanford hashers work. Many
must catch a bus from their home to the
CalTrain station, and then take the Mar
guerite to work. Then they work for a 2
1/2-hour shift and head back to the bus.
And they're not getting paid for this
long commute, of course. Most of them
have school to worry about in addition to
work (hey, just like Stanford students).
Others have multiple jobs, some working
60 hours a week to support their fami
lies — and these aren't desk jobs! And
they're constantly serving those who've
made it, all the while reinforcing in their
own minds that they have not.
I'm well aware that hashing jobs for

non-students are comparable to other
jobs they may seek. From t heir perspec
tive, it's not so bad. They don't have the
same expectations that come with the
superprivilege of most Stanford stu
dents. So I'm not calling for any protests
or boycotts but simply a greater aware
ness on the part of students of the com
plex dynamics that go on in a place as
common as the dining hall. And that's
without even mentioning the exploita
tion and injustices involved in getting
the food there in the first place! And one
last note to students: Next time you're
tempted to be picky about which slice of
roast beef you want or otherwise expect
the hashers to go out of their way for
you, think about what you're doing.
