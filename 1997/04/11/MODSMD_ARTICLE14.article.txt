# Service fraternity also knows how to have fun
## 
### 
I am writing to present a more com
plete and accurate view of Alpha Phi
Omega than the one presented in Mon
day's editorial. The editorial, in seeking to
address (lie issue of the changing Greek
system on campus, erroneously stated
i Hal: "Alpha Phi Omega . . . for the aver
age student looking for weekend fun, (is)
rat her undesirable."
Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed national
service fraternity, dedicated to imj ving
our community while still having t. Our
purpose is (o assemble college stiu. .its in
the fellowship of principles originally
dei ived from the Boy Scouts of America.
< )ur core principles of leadership, friend
hip and service are integral to our pro
grain on campus and in the community.
The Stanford chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega is in its 69th year. We currently

have more than 80 dedicated members
who do not find it at all "undesirable" to
promote public service and awareness.
Rather, we enjoy ourselves while provid
ing community service. While we may not
drink ourselves to oblivion — as The Daily
seems to portray other fraternities to do
— we still have fun on weekends, just like
other Stanford students.
We are not part of the Greek system
and (herefore not a member of the Inter
fraternity Council. This also means that
we do not participate or recruit in any of
the Greek Rush events. (However, we do
have members who belong to Greek fra
ternities and sororities.) We have two
pledging periods each year; we do not
offer bids; we do not condone or allow
any hazing. All individuals who are
interested 111 joining our fraternity and
who fulfill certain pledge requirements
are openly welcomed.
As an organization, Alpha Phi Omega
seeks to accomplish social good and to
better our community. I hope that in

the future, The Daily will acknowledge
our efforts and not belittle organiza
tions such as Alpha Phi Omega, which
seek to provide community service and
to promote principles beneficial to both
individuals and society.
