# Students should view Daily endorsements with a critical eye
## 
### 
On Tuesday, the editorial page of The
Daily will endorse an ASSU presidential
candidate and various special fee groups.
These endorsements arc generally well
thought out and serious, but they also
should be taken with many grains of salt
The editorial board consists of eight
people from The Daily. These people

work hard to be objective but they also
have personal prejudices that bias their
decisions. A number of student cam
paigns that were endorsed in the fall
have taken a beating in the spring. Have
the campaigns changed? No, not really.
It's just that there is a new group of
eight people, behind the scenes, anony
mously writing the editorials.
So when you read the endorsements
Tuesday, take them as you would any
other endorsement from eight people
who have thought about the issue but
are pushing their own personal opinions
and agendas. If (like last year) KZSU and
the Black Student Union don't get
endorsed, talk to people in those groups
and look at the election handbook before
deciding to vote no. These elections are
very important and I fear that Daily
endorsements are taken much more seri
ously than they should be.
