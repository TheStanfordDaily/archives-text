## I am what I am, sort of 
### 
MINE IS THE history of
oppressed America.
I am a product of public edu
cation. I went to public schools all the
way through.
(Granted mine were public schools
supported by a large tax base. Granted
that in my high school, which is poorer
and more diverse than were either my
junior high or my elementary school, I
was plugged into the homogeneous hon
ors track.)
I am Jewish. My grandfather was
picked up by the Nazis on Kristallnacht,
and he then fled the concentration camp
and the country.
(Granted the closest thing to anti-
Semitism I ever experienced growing up
was my peers' curiosity as to whether
Hanukkah Harry was like Santa. Grant
ed the local Jewish community to which
I belong is both sizable and highly
assimilated.)
I am female. I grew up in a society
that pays women less than men, lowers
their confidence in math and science
and objectifies them on the cover of
Sports Illustrated.
(Granted my father advises that I
should get degrees in economics and
engineering. Granted no magazine has
ever called and made an offer on my
face, legs or chest.)
I am young. Police and neighbors in my
hometown distrusted youth, cracked
down on our parties and followed our cars.

(Granted I never went to those par
ties. Granted the only time I was ever
pulled over was in a beat up, well-loved
Mustang driven by a Mexican friend
from the other side of El Camino.)
Granted.
I purport to mean well. This leaves
me in loose alliance with most of the rest
of humanity. I am appalled by the statis
tics I read about drive-bys and Uzis and
senseless deaths.
I blink back angry tears as I explain
how recent anti-imrnigrant legislation is
history repeating itself. I clench my fists
as I explain that welfare is wrong not in
that it takes from the rich but that it
fails to give enough to the poor. I
empathize with the struggle against an
unjust system. But I am not a casualty
of that system.
Yet every time I am asked where 1 am
from, I am vague. "I'm from around
here," I say. But often that does not
appease my interrogator.
"Uh, 4 miles away," I say when
pressed. It takes some deft cross-exami
nation before I will hesitantly admit
that my birthplace is a wealthy suburb
that is famous for passing legislation
against affordable housing and noisy
leaf blowers.
How much more appealing it is to
say, "Look at my education, my minori
ty culture, my gender, my age — I am a
member of the statistically oppressed."
Perhaps it is to compensate for the guilt

I feel, having been born with the face of
privilege.
Or perhaps it is to reduce my shame
for reaping the fruits of a system that
treads on those I seek to enfranchise. I
know 15-year-olds who, were they to sell
drugs, would be immediately hand
cuffed and tried as adults. If my younger
brother were to sell drugs, he would be
called an aberration and get off thanks
to good connections.
That every human being is welcome
and needed in the fight for justice seems
rhetorical. But I find myself searching
over and over again for a way to explain
that the struggle is not merely mine to
fight on someone else's behalf. I want
personal ownership of that fight.
But to focus on shared characteristics
of race, age, language or gender,
although tempting, is destructive
because it entails a misrepresentation of
my full background. Dissociating oneself
from a certain group of people in order to
fit in with another has never been the
effective way to utilize diversity.
But conformity has also never been
the way to overcome injustice. The real
current of change flows much deeper. I
have to grant you that.
