# ASSU presidential election: Comments from the candidates
## Communication is key to effective leadership 
### Emily Andrus Ben Decker 
ONCE A YEAR something
strange happens. Small
groups of students make a
bunch of fliers that say "vote for
me and talk about how to change
the notoriously ineffective organi
zation we call the ASSU.
For about a week the campus is
covered with brightly colored
paper, and people talk about the
same things they've been talking
about in these elections for years.
After it's over, the fliers come
down, and students are left more
or less where they began. So why
should you even bother to vote?
You should vote because the
ASSU really can change things
that matter to you. It can improve
student services, strengthen cam
pus organizations and serve as a
representative to University
administrators. But these things
can only be accomplished if your
student leaders seize the ASSU's
potential for concrete action.
We believe it is time for the
administration to take the ASSU
seriously. In recent meetings with
University President Gerhard
Casper and other administrators,
it has become clear to us that the
University does not believe the
ASSU has extensive student sup
port. And they're partly right. We
encourage you to make a conscious
decision during this election to
ensure that the student govern
ment you elect will represent you.
Without student support, the
ASSU cannot expect to accomplish
its goals. We believe that commu
nication, both with students and
with the administration, is one of
the most important functions of
effective student government and
one which is often overlooked.
When is the last time a senator
asked your opinion? Has the ASSU
president ever come to your house
meeting? We believe that real, per
sonal communication with the stu
dents on this campus is important.
Your concerns, those of your orga
nization and those of your dorm
should set the ASSU's agenda.
People in the ASSU seem to be

very adept at fliering during cam
paign season, but as soon as they
are elected direct communication
stops. We are currently working to
create a permanent position for an
ASSU publicist, who will ensure
that you are aware of the projects
student government undertakes,
events on campus and community
service opportunities. Incorporat
ed into this plan is outreach to
graduate students through their
respective departments and expan
sion of successful methods such as
the recently completed survey on
graduate student life.
Our office will publish a month
ly letter outlining our plans and
stating concrete goals. This letter
will be distributed in graduate and
undergraduate residences, as well
as in department offices.
We will also bring back a legiti
mate dorm rep system, expand the
role of the Frosh Council and
work with the graduate student
representatives.
We are committed to working
on the issues that matter to you:
Education: First and fore
most, we are students and our edu
cation is of the highest importance.
We believe that more emphasis
should be placed on the quality of
teaching at Stanford. Teaching
excellence should play an impor
tant role in faculty tenure and
recruitment decisions. We will
work with the Faculty Senate to
accomplish these goals.
Funding and support for
your student organization:
Campus groups provide opportuni
ties for education outside the class
room. We will ensure that your
organization is getting the
resources it needs. We have draft
ed plans to revamp the funding
system in to allocate money at the
start of the quarter, allowing for
better planning and budgeting.
Improvement of student
services: Paying too much for
books, not getting adequate health
coverage, not being able to park
near your dorm. We will address
these issures in conjunction with
administrators and the Universi
ty's governing committees.
We are two students with expe-

rience both inside
and outside the
ASSU. Our in
volvement in
campus life has
extended to stu
dent government,
academic groups,
ethnic and reli
gious organiza
tions, Greek life

and community service. Our expe
riences during the past three years
have given us a valuable perspec
tive on both the limitations of the
ASSU and its true potential.
Last year students voted for a
new constitution and a new
ASSU. They only got the first.
This Wednesday and Thursday
vote for the second.

Emily Andrus, a junior majoring
in public policy, is a candidate
for ASSU president. Ben Decker,
a junior majoring in economics,
is a candidate for ASSU vice
president.

During every ASSU election, voters
are bombarded with short cam
paign messages that leave voters
wondering about the candidates' sub
stance and leadership abilities. While the
Elections Handbook contains statements
from each candidate and The Daily tries
its best to inform you about them, there
will inevitably be questions you want
answered before you cast your votes.
The Daily asked the three tickets for
ASSU president and vice president to
write essays based on the following ques
tions: Why should students vote? How
will your ticket reach out to the under
graduate and graduate communities?
What issues are most important to you?
