# Campaign pledges difficult to fulfill
## ASSU incumbents reflect on past year 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
High hopes, colorful banners,
funky slogans and promises for the
future â€” these are the stuff of
which ASSU elections are made.
Offering ideas and goals for the
future, first-time candidates are
free of the burden of accounting for
their past work. However, for sena
tors running for re-election or seek
ing other offices, the election is a
time for offering new promises and
reflecting on both past achieve
ments and disappointments.
But to what avail are the promis
es that senatorial candidates offer
each year? How frequently can they
fulfill their agendas?
According to several ASSU offi
cials, a senator's ability to fulfill his
promises depends in large measure
on the committee to which he is as
signed.
Senators Howard Loo and Fern
Mechlowitz both indicated that
student politicians frequently be
come disillusioned when they dis
cover that the dynamics of the sen
ate and the requisite committee
work hinders them from bringing
their agendas to fruition.

Mechlowitz said that during her
year in the senate, she discovered
how hard is to execute individual
promises.
"Last year I campaigned on im
proving Cowell Student Health
Center," she said, "but part of the
reason that I couldn't address all
that I campaigned on is because
committees take up so much time."
Serving in the ASSU Senate is
"not just about about coming up
with your own ideas and attacking
them," Mechlowitz added.
Loo further suggested that he is
unsure whether the senate is the
best branch of the ASSU for repre
senting student views. Rather, Loo
explained that senate is, in practice,
"the watchdog of the ASSU"; they
have to accomplish many everyday
administrative tasks. He empha
sized that because the senate is pri
marily charged with overseeing the
work of the ASSU, "it has not been
the source of a lot of entrepreneur
ial student issues."
Nonetheless, election-time
promises are made, and con
stituents expect at least an attempt
at having them fulfilled.
