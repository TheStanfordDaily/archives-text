# Campaign pledges difficult to fulfill
## ASSU incumbents reflect on past year 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
High hopes, colorful banners,
funky slogans and promises for the
future â€” these are the stuff of
which ASSU elections are made.
Offering ideas and goals for the
future, first-time candidates are
free of the burden of accounting for
their past work. However, for sena
tors running for re-election or seek
ing other offices, the election is a
time for offering new promises and
reflecting on both past achieve
ments and disappointments.
But to what avail are the promis
es that senatorial candidates offer
each year? How frequently can they
fulfill their agendas?
According to several ASSU offi
cials, a senator's ability to fulfill his
promises depends in large measure
on the committee to which he is as
signed.
Senators Howard Loo and Fern
Mechlowitz both indicated that
student politicians frequently be
come disillusioned when they dis
cover that the dynamics of the sen
ate and the requisite committee
work hinders them from bringing
their agendas to fruition.

Mechlowitz said that during her
year in the senate, she discovered
how hard is to execute individual
promises.
"Last year I campaigned on im
proving Cowell Student Health
Center," she said, "but part of the
reason that I couldn't address all
that I campaigned on is because
committees take up so much time."
Serving in the ASSU Senate is
"not just about about coming up
with your own ideas and attacking
them," Mechlowitz added.
Loo further suggested that he is
unsure whether the senate is the
best branch of the ASSU for repre
senting student views. Rather, Loo
explained that senate is, in practice,
"the watchdog of the ASSU"; they
have to accomplish many everyday
administrative tasks. He empha
sized that because the senate is pri
marily charged with overseeing the
work of the ASSU, "it has not been
the source of a lot of entrepreneur
ial student issues."
Nonetheless, election-time
promises are made, and con
stituents expect at least an attempt
at having them fulfilled.
Inruiiibenl undergraduates
Two incumbent undergraduate
senators, Maren Norton and .Jesus
Gonzalez, are running for re-elec
tion. Both served this year as non
vot tng members of the senate.
Norton, despite her nonvoting
status, headed the Senate's Budget
and Finance Committee and served
on the ASSU Bylaws Committee.
Her fellow senators offered noth
ing hut praise for her dedication.
"She was indispensable, and she
made a great contribution to the
senate," said Senate Deputy Chair
Joe Freund.
Senator Doug Natelson echoed
these sentiments, noting that "al
though she is not even a voting sen
ator, she has put in tremendous
time and effort and has done a su
perb job."
Norton expressed pleasure in
achieving her promised goal of
reaching out further to students,
citing her work on co-authoring a
bill that enabled smaller student
groups to apply for special fees
under a larger umbrella organiza
tion, as well as attendance at meet
ings of various student organiza
tions.
Norton emphasized that in a

second term she would use her ex
perience "to make sure that first
and foremost in every decision
maker's mind are the students and
their input."
Gonzalez, who served on the Ap
propriations Committee, played a
smaller role. However, he noted his
work on the behalf of the Women's
Center, the Disability Resource
Center and student affairs.
Nonetheless, according to Sen
ate Chair Don Aingworth, Gonza
lez, "hasn't, to the best of my
knowledge, done much."
Gonzalez responded, saying
that as his involvement was mainly
with the Appropriations Commit
tee, Aingworth did not see him very
much.
"One of the problems is that
some tend to overlook the people
who do the work behind the
scenes," Gonzalez said.
Incumbent graduates
Graduate Senators Michael
Colon and Alane Murdock are also
running for re-election.
Colon, who ran hist year on a
platform of overseeing funding for
student organizations, served on
the appropriations committee. Say
ing that serving on appropriations
is "a way to be very effective,"
Colon indicated that he was pleased
with the progress made this year.
In recent weeks, Colon has also

chaired the Senate's Ad Hoc Com
mittee on the Judicial Charter.
Colon's tireless efforts have not
gone unrecognized by his col
leagues.
"I'm really quite impressed with
what Michael has done with the ad
hoc committee, particularly with
how many times it met and how
thoroughly it went through the
charter," said Senator Harris
Shapiro.
Aingworth agreed, noting that
Colon, "is the most thoughtful of
all the senators, whose work on
the senate committee reviewing
Committee of 15, has been in
valuable."
Among Colon's goals for a sec
ond term are to open membership
in some student organizations to
graduate students.
Colon also indicated interest in
creating a calendar of events for ac
tivities funded by special fees.
"Students often don't know
where their general fees are going,"
he said.
Murdock, a veteran senator and
a member of the Appropriations
Committee as well as the Adminis
tration and Rules Committee,
noted that her most significant
contributions this year were "the
umbrella group revisions, the clari
fication of the bylaws and the Judi
cial Charter."
Shapiro also noted Murdock's

work in reviving communication
between the senate and special
ASSU groups such as the Speakers
Bureau.
However, not all senators have
been as complementary about
Murdock.
"If she could learn to pick her
fights and evaluate her arguments
objectively, she could be a standout
senator," Aingworth said. "Howev
er, she gives more chaff than
wheat."
Next year, Murdock hopes to ex
amine the timing of student-group
funds allocation.
The Senate's "timing makes it
difficult for groups to put on good
programs early on in the quarter,"
she said, explaining that groups
need to wait about four weeks into
the quarter for their funds.
Andrus and Loo
Presidential candidates Emily
Andrus and Howard Loo both
served in the Senate this year. An
drus chaired the Appropriations
Committee while Loo chaired Stu
dent Affairs.
"They both went above and be
yond the call of duty," Natelson
said.
Andrus' committee extensively
reworked the ASSU Bylaws, as
well as the way the funding system
works. Most notably the commit
tee created the provision for small

extra curricular groups to apply
for special fees under umbrella
status.
Andrus said that the reforms en
abled the "Appropriations Com
mittee to be sure that it was follow
ing its guidelines while simultane
ously getting rid of inefficient ways
of appropriation and making sure
student groups were getting the
funding they needed."
The appropriations guideline
handbook that Andrus pledged to
compile is currently in the works.
She has also looked into changes at
the post office and participated in
the search for a new ASStJ finan
cial manager.
"Emily is always together," said
Freund. "She is very motivated and
extremely well prepared and effec
tive."
Although Aingworth confirmed
that Andrus is "a solid senator," he
mentioned that he "wished that
she had made her committee make
some tougher choices rather than
more-or-less rubber stamp the
board's recommendations."
As the sole Senate member who
was also on the Committee of 15,
Loo spent much of the year advo
cating the revised Judicial Charter
to senators and students alike. The
charter, if approved, will radically
change procedures for handling
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard Violations.

Loo conceded that he and his
committee focused principally on
the charter, neglecting his promise
to forge a closer relationship be
tween student government and
dorm government. He said this was
due to the importance of the char
ter and the lack of enthusiasm
among students for his other
promise.
He noted that his committee
had coordinated some dorm fo
rums on the topic of the charter last
fall.
Loo admitted that he was not as
successful at student outreach as
he would have liked to have been.
He contributed this in part to the
ongoing difficulties and problems
surrounding the charter.
"Who knew that it would drag
out all year?" said Loo.
Nevertheless, he suggested that
his participation in the senate
"helped raise the level of debate."
Freund agreed. "He often
played the role of devil's advocate
and led us to look at sides of issues
that other's hadn't explored."
Overall, many of the Senators
felt satisfied with this year. "People
have been more willing to work to
gether than in the past," Murdock
said.
Andrus agreed. "The senate
tried to be more unified and to not
let inner political battles influence
policy making," she said.
