# Draw, relations with ASSU are main issues
## 
### Howard Loo Solomon Lefler 
MANY ARE concerned
that the ASSU does not
do enough "outreach"
to the rest of the campus. We
believe that outreach is only the
beginning; only through gen
uine grassroots civic engage
ment can the ASSU executive
realize its full potential.
For example, we are imple
menting the first two prongs of
our "45 Day Plan" in a complete
ly grassroots manner. The "45
Day Plan" consists of three initia
tives that we will accomplish by
June 1 regardless of the outcome
of the election. We are currently
meeting with dorm presidents
and other interested students in
our effort to draft by June 1 pro
posals to change both the Draw
and the way dorm governments
interact with the ASSU.
This is the kind of grassroots
collaboration that excites us and

drives our candidacy. Through
this collaboration we are able to
tap the varied talents of the stu
dent body. In only the first few
days of our campaign, we have
been contacted by a number of
talented World Wide Web pro
grammers who are excited about
implementing prong three of the
"45 Day Plan": the Stanford
Activity Wei) Site / Channel.
We will complete this plan by
June I regardless of the outcome
of the election. The era of the
ASSU being run by an elite group
of 15 or so is over; the era of
widespread student involvement
in the Stanford civic arena is now.
The "45 Day Plan" is an
example of what student govern
ment at Stanford is capable of
doing. Each prong will impact
life at Stanford. The beauty of a
representative democracy is that
you, the voters, have the power
to determine the course of your
student government's future.
You also have the opportunity,
by joining the teams working to
implement the "45 Day Plan," to
contribute your talents to these
projects.
The success of these grass
roots efforts can only be realized
if the ASSU executive works in a
cooperative manner with Uni
versity officials. It is often politi
cally expedient for student lead
ers to rally against University
officials in order to create the
illusion that these student lead
ers are defending student inter
ests. It is more effective for the
ASSU executive to defend stu
dent interests in a mature and
serious manner; this entails
doing the research and ground
work necessary to really tackle
University policies.
In our group of dorm leaders
working on the proposal to
reform the Draw (prong one),
the final written proposal will
contain economic analysis of
alternative housing lottery
schemes as well as evidence from
student surveys pertaining to
the Draw. In short, representing
students to University adminis
trators entails more than merely

communicating
to an official that
"the students
want policy X";
real representa
tion entails de
veloping compre
hensive stands
and proposals.
Do not con
fuse more repre-

sentation with effective repre
sentation; adding student mem
hers to University committees
does not. improve student voice
on those committees it the stu
dents are not organized. One of
our long-term goals is to create
institutions, such as the grass
roots team current ly working on
the Draw and executive coordi
nation of student representation
on University committees, that
will strengthen student involve
ment in the University's deci
sion making.
We hnve rejected the cam
paign approach in which candi
dates present the student body
with a "laundry list of issues."
Issues can only be addressed by
plans of action, and the success
of any action plan is dependent
upon the principles on which
that plan is built.
We have the experience
(Howard as a dorm president,
resident assistant and senator;
Solomon as senate parliamen
tarian, Student Conduct leg
islative Council member and
ASSU elections hearings officer)
to be effective leaders. We have
provided you with three clear
principles: integrity over politi
cal expediency, grassroots par
ticipation and responsible repre
sentation to university adminis
trators. We have provided you
with a specific plan of action, the
"45 Day Plan," and we hope that
our ideas can be met with your
support.
