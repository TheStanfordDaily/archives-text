# Post-election action will speak louder than words
## 
### Jim Finsten 
During the past month or so,
I've been approached by several
students about the disappearance
of my column. The following is an exam
ple of a typical conversation between
myself and a loyal reader.
Loyal Reader: "How come I didn't see
your column in the Daily this week?
Jim: "I'm giving up my column to run for
ASSU president with Kelly Naylor."
LR: "You're going to do what?! I thought
you had some common sense."
J: "Obviously you've never talked to my
parents."
Being ASSU President has not been a
lifelong ambition of mine. I'm the only
candidate who has not run for ASSU office
before, and I'm the only candidate who is
not a member of this year's Senate. But I
decided to give up one of my favorite
chores (the weekly column) and take on
this project, which most Stanford students
consider to be a major headache. Why?
Journalists like to complain. At The
Daily, everyone's favorite target is the

ASSU and, in particular, the ASSU presi
dent. (It's hard to run a picture of the
entire senate.)
But after a while, whining gets old.
Kelly and I care about our Stanford
experience. For $30,000 a year, we
assume that you do, too. Like it or not,
the ASSU is the best way for students to
lobby the University.
When the ASSU deals with the Uni
versity, some administrators wonder
aloud if the ASSU really speaks for the
students. This way, it's easy for them to
dismiss us. It's even easier if students
spend little time selecting their leaders
and lots of time bitching about them.
Instead of calling this column, "Why
you should vote for Jim and Kelly," I'd
rather call it, "Why you should vote."
Read the Elections Handbook state
ments. Read the campaign literature
not just mine but my opponents' as well.
Read Emily Andrus' "open letter." Read
Howard Loo's "45 Day Plan."
One of us will be your next president,
meaning we'll assume the likely title of
"least popular person on campus." The

entire student body will be much better
off if our partners in the faculty, staff and
administration understand that the
ASSU president speaks for the students.
If you're sick of reading about how annoy
ing the ASSU is then help us change it.
In our case, our statement says the
same thing as our literature. If you're a
graduate student or you live off campus,
check our World Wide Web page. If you
live in undergraduate housing, chances
are you'll get a handbill from Kelly and
me. Wordy, perhaps (just like my
columns). Hut at least we're consistent.
Here's a recap of our platform:
Teaching: We didn't come up with
the ideas of merit pay and public course
evaluations; a University committee sug
gested them 20 years ago. Hut the recom
mendations were never acted upon.
Resource allocation: Not a very sexy
title, but it's important. We're talking
about interdisciplinary programs like Sci
ence, Technology and Society; Compara
tive Studies in Itace and Ethnicity; Ameri
can Studies; Human Biology. We want the
faculty to know we care about these pro

grams and they should be fully supported.
Student organizations: Most stu
dent interaction with the ASSU is
through the funding process. As a former
treasurer of Stanford in Government,
which is always fighting through red tape
for money, I want to simplify the process
and help Stanford find more workspace
for homeless student groups.
Hoard of Trustees: The University's
ultimate governing body has no voting
student members nor do students have a
voice in trustee selection. And they say
they listen to us.
I'm running for president because even
if I don't have much common sense (as
mom and dad maintain), I know an awful
lot of people on this campus who do.
One of these people is Kelly Naylor, my
running mate. Kelly is a typical Stanford
student — one of the busiest people you'll
ever meet. She's an engineer who spends
much of her waking hours at the Haas
Center for Public Service. Along with
other motivated students she is designing
the public service minor. She's also a v;ir
sity athlete who practices field hockey 20

hours a week. And she
bakes bread.
I still haven't decided
if I enjoy campaigning or
not. It's not much fun
trying to sell yourself,
but meeting people and
talking about things I
care about has been ;i
wonderful experience.
Before I'm done, I
want to thank the bun
dreds of students we've
met and talked to so far,
as well as the dozens of
people who have helped

to spread our message. Whether or not
you decide to vote for »Jim Finsten and
Kelly Naylor, I hog you not just to vote
but also to pay attention. For $.'{o,ooo a
year, you deserve nothing less.
