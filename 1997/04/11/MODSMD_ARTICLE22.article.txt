In commemoration of Okada's 25th anniver
sary as Stanford's Asian-American theme dorm,
residents are producing a documentary that ex
plores the history of their dormitory and how its
goals have changed over the years.
The primary purpose of the documentary is to
educate the Stanford community about Okada
and ethnic theme dorms in general by providing
what the film's producers feel is an often neglect
ed perspective on the topic.
"People will often say that ethnic theme houses
are divisive and that they promote division over as
similation or integration," said Chou Yang,
Okada's ethnic theme associate and the documen
tary's producer.
Assoc. History Prof. Gordon Chang is spon
soringthe project, which was started last quarter
by students in his seminar, "Exploring the Mul
ticultural History of Stanford."
Yang hopes the documentary will provide an
alternative, more informed view of Okada, as
well as other ethnic theme dorms, by showing
that the goal of Okada is to be a place where all
students can learn about Asian-American issues

and culture.
"The problem with arguments against ethnic
theme dorms is that they are usually about the
idea of the houses themselves when the focus
should be on the goals of the houses and whether
these goals are being achieved for all residents,"
Yang said.
The documentary will contain footage from
interviews with current and past residents, resi
dent assistants, theme associates, resident fel
lows and administrators. It will show how Okada
has changed since its founding, when its goal was
to serve as a safe environment for students of
Asian Pacific Islander heritage to come together
and unite.
"It's no longer just a place for Asian Ameri
cans to hangout," said freshman Okada resident
Ben Longoria-Valadez, who is also involved in
the documentary project. "Now it's much more
of a cultural experience where eveiyone can learn
about Asian-American heritage."
"I'm Mexican American, and there's no Asian-
American population where I come from. Livingin
Okada has served as a catalyst to change my pre
conceived notions about Asian Americans," Lon
goria-Valadez said.

The documentary is being produced in con
junction with the Communication and History
Departments as well as with MPAC, a local
public access channel that will air the complet
ed documentary. A preliminary cut of the doc
umentary is expected to be finished by the end
of May. The final version will be ready by next
fall.
"I'm findingout what the story is about where
I live. Now I understand how ()kada has changed
to get to where it is now. That's why being part of
this project is interesting," Longoria-Valadez
said.
The producers of the documentary are cur
rently in the process of looking to interview stu
dents, faculty, staff and administrators who have
strong opinions for or against the existence of
Okada or ethnic theme dorms. They are also col
lecting old video footage, pictures, flyers and arti
cles.
Yang plans to have campus wide screenings of
the documentary when it is completed. He also
hopes to keep copies of it at Meyer Library, where
it can be accesscxl easily. "It'll give new students
a good introduction to ethnic theme houses," he
said.
