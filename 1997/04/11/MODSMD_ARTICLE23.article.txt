## Softball travels to wounded Cal 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team
hopes to continue its winning
ways against 12th-ranked Cal
ifornia in a doubleheader at
Berkeley tomorrow at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal is on an
upswing since the start of
spring break, going 8-3-1 in its
last 12 games to boost its
record to a solid 19-17-1 and
5-9 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Key factors to the Card's
improved performance have
been error-free defense, con
tinued strong pitching and
better hitting.
"A lot of the extra inning
games that we've experienced
have really made us focus
mentally," said freshman out
fielder Kelly Yablonski. "That
has really helped improve our

defense and overall tough
ness."
A weakened Cal team (23-
18, 6-8 Pac-10) should also
benefit the surging Cardinal
this weekend. Injuries have
decimated the Golden Bears,
leaving their roster less com
petitive than it has been.
"Cal's best pitcher is out,"
said sophomore star Marcy
Crouch. "That should give us
an even better shot at beating
them."
The loss of two-time AU-
American Whitney Floyd to an
Achilles injury in February
has left Cal's pitching staff
particularly thin, so the Cardi
nal should get some good looks
at hittable pitches against
Holly Yost (16-13) or Melanie
McCart (5-3).
