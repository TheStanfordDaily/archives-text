The Stanford track and field
team will be at it again tomor
row when it competes at the
Pierce Golden Bear Invitational
in Berkeley. This should not be
confused with Big Meet against
camornia, wAiCrt wiXT Oe iVray <5
at Stanford.
Once again, the Cardinal will
not be sending a full team to
compete. The men's numbers
will be reduced due to the begin
ning of spring football practice.
Several runners serve double
duty, competing on the gridiron
as well as the track. After their
brilliant performance in Texas,
the men who competed there
will also have the weekend off. A
few women's sprinters who are
"a bit dinged up," according to
head coach Vin Lananna, will
get the weekend off as well.
Make no mistake, the Cardi
nal is ready to compete and
should have a good showing.
"We are sending a very good
team to Berkeley," Lananna
said. He expects strong perfor
mances, especially on the
women's side. Events to watch
include the 1,500 meters, the

throwing events and junior
Bernadette Armand, who has
"been on a roll" in the hurdles,
Lananna said.
Throwing this weekend for
the Card will be junior Sami Jo
Small, sophomore Gina Heads
and freshmen Summer Pierson,
Maggie Ts.sac ancf Affison Reatty.
The men's team is expecting top
performances in the jumping
and throwing events. They also
expect to have a good showing in
the steeplechase and 1,500
meters.
Stanford will be facing tough
competition this weekend.
Competing at the meet are Illi
nois from the Big 10 Conference
and Texas from the Big 12. Both
schools are excellent nonconfer
ence competition. The Cardinal
may have its eye more closely
focused on USC, the Pacific 10
Conference favorite, who will
also be there this weekend.
Stanford, however, is not nec
essarily looking to win the meet
this weekend. Although the
meet is scored, that is not the
Cardinal's main concern.
"Our focus is on individual
