# Tracksters hope to pierce Golden Bears
## 
### Becky Unruh 
The Stanford track and field
team will be at it again tomor
row when it competes at the
Pierce Golden Bear Invitational
in Berkeley. This should not be
confused with Big Meet against
camornia, wAiCrt wiXT Oe iVray <5
at Stanford.
Once again, the Cardinal will
not be sending a full team to
compete. The men's numbers
will be reduced due to the begin
ning of spring football practice.
Several runners serve double
duty, competing on the gridiron
as well as the track. After their
brilliant performance in Texas,
the men who competed there
will also have the weekend off. A
few women's sprinters who are
"a bit dinged up," according to
head coach Vin Lananna, will
get the weekend off as well.
Make no mistake, the Cardi
nal is ready to compete and
should have a good showing.
"We are sending a very good
team to Berkeley," Lananna
said. He expects strong perfor
mances, especially on the
women's side. Events to watch
include the 1,500 meters, the

throwing events and junior
Bernadette Armand, who has
"been on a roll" in the hurdles,
Lananna said.
Throwing this weekend for
the Card will be junior Sami Jo
Small, sophomore Gina Heads
and freshmen Summer Pierson,
Maggie Ts.sac ancf Affison Reatty.
The men's team is expecting top
performances in the jumping
and throwing events. They also
expect to have a good showing in
the steeplechase and 1,500
meters.
Stanford will be facing tough
competition this weekend.
Competing at the meet are Illi
nois from the Big 10 Conference
and Texas from the Big 12. Both
schools are excellent nonconfer
ence competition. The Cardinal
may have its eye more closely
focused on USC, the Pacific 10
Conference favorite, who will
also be there this weekend.
Stanford, however, is not nec
essarily looking to win the meet
this weekend. Although the
meet is scored, that is not the
Cardinal's main concern.
"Our focus is on individual
performance," Lananna said.
"We are going to treat this more
like an invitational."
For the next three weeks, the
track team will seem to be more
of a group of individuals. Lanan
na plans to split the team for
various competitions, like the
Mt. SAC relays in Walnut,
Calif., and the Wilson Invita
tional in Davis, Calif., both next
weekend. There may also be
some lineup juggling to see
which event suits each athlete
best. The entire team will final
ly all come together for Big Meet
next month.
One of the women's runners
in the 1,500 meters tomorrow
will be junior co-captain Monal
Chokshi. Although looking for
ward to a strong showing tomor
row, she can't wait until May.
"We have the strongest team
we've had since I've been at
Stanford," Chokshi said. "We
really feel like we're going to
beat Berkeley this year."
Big Meet has traditionally
been very close. Cal has a signif
icant lead over the Stanford
men as far as the win-loss
record goes, but the competition
is always close.
"It usually comes down to the
mile relay, the last step. No one
leaves the stands," Lananna
said.
The women have had a little
more success, but Chokshi is
still anxious.
"We haven't beaten Berkeley
in the three years I've been
here," she said.
Big Meet is still a month
away, but the Cardinal will be
ready. Strong individual perfor
mances are expected to contin
ue, starting tomorrow.
