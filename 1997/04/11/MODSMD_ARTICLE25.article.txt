# ’Cat, Devil women come to Taube
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Despite three matches in five
days against the toughest con
ference in women's tennis, it
doesn't get any easier for No. 2
Stanford. On consecutive after
noons beginning today, No. 8
Arizona State and No. 14 Ari
zona come knocking on the door
of the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium.
The Cardinal (22-1, 6-0 Pacif

ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) is on a roll, however, to the
tune of an 11-match win streak
and a Pac-10 win streak that
dates to 1994.
A homestand with the Wild
cats and Sun Devils has been
competitive as of late, with the
emergence of a top-10 program
in Tucson. However, it is the Sun
Devils who are making noise this
year, taking a No. 27 ranking in
last year's final poll and improv
ing to this week's No. 8 spot.

"All that means is that we
have double trouble," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"Arizona is always tough, of
course, and now ASU has really
been flexing its muscles."
Specifically, the Sun Devils
(14-3, 5-2) have lost just three
matches this season, at home to
No. 2 Stanford (8-1), at No. 3
UCLA (6-3) and at home against
Texas (7-2).
The Sun Devils are led by
junior Reka Cseresnyes, the

18th-ranked singles player, who
has put together a 10-6 record at
the top of the lineup. Against
Stanford in the first meeting,
Cseresnyes defeated Stanford
senior co-captain Katie Schluke
bir 7-5, 6-2.
"She has always been tough
on us over the years," Brennan
said. "Day in and day out she is a
great performer. She is a real
power player, so when she's
dropping them in, she is real
tough."
Freshman Kerry Giardino
has also been strong in her rook
ie season, compiling a 12-2
record at the No. 5 and No. 6 sin
gles spots.
In doubles, Arizona State
junior Stephanie Lansdorp and
sophomore Katy Propstra have
gone 9-3 in the top spot and are
ranked No. 18 nationally as well.
Against Arizona, the Cardinal
will get another glimpse of last
season's Pac-10 player of the
year, junior Vicky Maes. Howev
er, Stanford's top singles player
and Maes' opponent tomorrow,
freshman Lilia Osterloh, will get
her first look at Maes. Osterloh
did not compete in the Cardi
nal's 6-3 win due to a shoulder
injury.
"It's going to be a very inter
esting matchup since they have
never played each other," Bren
nan said. "I love to watch Vicky
play. She is a great athlete, and
she burns you with her speed.
She will be, by quite a bit, the
best player Lilia has seen so far.
If Lilia beats her, that's a good
benchmark for her."
Maes, currently ranked No. 7
in singles, is 16-3 in dual-match

competition. Osterloh is 5-1 at
the top spot, 9-1 overall and
ranked No. 51 as she climbs back
from injury.
In doubles, Maes teams up
with senior Khristen Pietrucha
to play in the top spot, where
they are 7-3 and ranked No. 6
nationally.
In their last action, the Wild
cats and Sun Devils squared off
in a desert showdown. The Sun
Devils earned a 6-3 road win as
they swept doubles play. The
Wildcats previously had upset

No. 5 Texas 6-3.
Stanford is coming off a hard
earned 7-2 win at No. 17 Califor
nia Tuesday and two wins
against No. 3 UCLA and USC
last weekend at home.
"You wouldn't expect our two
co-captains to lose against Cal,"
Brennan said, referring to losses
by Schlukebir and previously
unbeaten Julie Scott. "But
everyone else stepped up nicely."
The festivities conclude at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium
Sunday with the Women's Leg
ends Classic. The event, starting
at 1 p.m., features 25 former
Stanford players in Pro-Am play.
Tickets will be available at the
stadium.
