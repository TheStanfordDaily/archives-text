# Golf home at last for Barnard Collegiate
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
While the Stanford women's golf team
posted mediocre scores at its last three tour
naments, the team is shrugging its shoul
ders, looking only ahead to better days.
Better days may have just arrived.
The Cardinal team will host the Peg
Barnard California Collegiate, a 36-hole
event, at the 6,150-yard Stanford (Jolf
Course this weekend. The home-course
advantage helped the Cardinal to a second
place finish last year.
A welcome addition to the team is the
return of senior co-captain Andrea Baxter,
the fourth-ranked collegian, who has been
out with a broken wrist.
While Baxter's wrist is not fully recov
ered, she said she hopes her short game will
help compensate for her full swing.

"I'm tired of being injured," Baxter said.
"It'll be nice to just go out there and play my
best."
Baxter waS' sidelined from the last three
tournaments because of a February snow-
Ixfaj'vliptf accident She played the Stanford
course earlier this week during practice and
said she feels confident about her weekend
performance.
The par-73 Stanford course, though chal
lenging because of its undulating greens and
hilly setup, is not known for difficult par-5
holes. These par-5s will provide a good
opportunity for the Cardinal to play aggres
sively 011 its home course.
Senior Mliairi McKay said she hopes to do
just that on the 455-yard seventh.
The sharp dogleg left features huge, 100-
year-old oak trees. McKay said she will
attempt to carry her ball over the trees with
her driver to eliminate an extra fairway stroke.

Many others will play conservatively
because of the trees, hitting to the right cor
ner of the dogleg.
McKay posted her all-time course low at
the Stanford Women's Intercollegiate in
Ontoh'jr. She shot GO in the first round en
route to a second-place finish.
"It'd be great to shoot a 00 again, but I'm
not going to put pressure on myself to do
that," she said.
McKay came off strong at her last tourna
ment after scoring 5 over par for three
rounds (71, 77,
"I felt I was swinging well. And I want to
build on that this weekend," McKay said.
But in the mercurial game of golf, a per
fect. swing can disappear, and errant shots
can pop up with an intimidating course
design such as the Stanford course.
Built in 1929, the classic
course follows the natural topog
raphy of the Stanford Foothills
and San Francisquito Creek.
The transition between flat val
leys and hills makes for some
difficult sidehill shots and down
hill lie on the back nine.
The signature 12th hole, at
408 yards, features a large oak
tree smack in the middle of the
fairway. The creek parallels the
fairway along the right. A second
shot, which often requires a
sidehill lie, means shooting the
ball below the feet for an awk
ward stance.
The par-4 12th also features

an engulfing sand trap in front
of the green.
Cardinal players noted the
fourth and ninth as particularly
tricky because of the water haz
ards.
And one must not forget those
crazy greens.
"Man, they're pretty tough,"
Baxter said.
Consider the first hole, where
a player tees off from one side of
Junipero Serra to the other side
of the street. The pin sits in the
back of the green, where the
green slopes downhill Players
said the strategy to putt is to
shoot below the hole for a less
difficult, uphill putt.
The shotgun start is at 8:30
a.m. tomorrow and 8 a.m. Sun
day. The course will be closed
today for tournament practice.
