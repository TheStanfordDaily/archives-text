# Reed, Western Washington in town
## Women's rugby hosts regionals 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Hoping to continue the strong, quick play it has
been improving throughout the season, the women's
rugby team will host the Pacific Regional playoffs
this weekend.
The Cardinal will open its postseason play against
Western Washington tomorrow at 9 a.m. on Mal
oney Field. Stanford will then face Reed College at 5
p.m.
The team has had success overcoming its small
physical size by utilizing superior speed.
Although the Cardinal cannot overwhelm its
opponents with strength, the squad has been able to
set the tempo of the match and dictate the action. In
order to get far in the postseason, Stanford will have
to continue eluding its competitors while on offense

and keep them pressured while on defense.
"The women have been preparing extremely
well," said head coach Franck Boivert. "We went to
Canada (over spring break) to play two very good
teams, [Victoria and British Columbia). Last week
end we had a camp where we had to practice on Sat
urday and Sunday. And this week to top things off
we're just practicing tactically for our two matches
this weekend.
"The team will have to play a lot of defense.
They'll have to put a lot of pressure on the oppo
nents because I think offensively they are quite
ready. It's easier to win a game when they play hard
defense rather than the other way around."
While keeping the pressure on their opponents
defensively, the women will also have to stay accu-
rate with their passes.
"We have to stay on our toes
and keep them feeling the pres
sure on their backs and especially
their forwards," said freshman
Karinca Celaya. "Also, if we're
consistent with our passes and
looking to break through the
lines, we're sure it'll open up a lot
of opportunities for us."
The tournament, usually a
single-elimination, four-team
bracket, has been reformatted

this year clue to Washington
State dropping out. It. will be a
round-robin tournament, with
each school facing the other two
once. The team that wins both of
its matches will advance.
If each team wins only one
game, the tie-breaker will go to
the team with the lowest ejec
tions. The second tie-breaker will
go to the team with the highest
offensive total. If there is still a
tie, the team with the lowest total
of points allowed will advance.
The match between Reed and
Western Washington will take
place Sunday at 10 a.m.
