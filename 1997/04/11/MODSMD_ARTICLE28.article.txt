The seventh-ranked Stanford
men's tennis squad embarks
upon another difficult road trip
this weekend when the Cardinal
battles Pacific 10 Conference
rivals Arizona and Arizona State

The Cardinal is coming off a
solid win Tuesday at home,
when it ousted 15th-ranked Illi
nois by an impressive score of 7-
0. The Card now boasts a 17-2
record (4-1 Pac-10) for the sea
son.

Yet, the trip to Arizona will
prove a hot, quick and tiring
excursion for the Cardinal,
which will need to be in top form
to take out both the Wildcats
and the Sun Devils.
"It is a tough match because
there is not a lot of time in
between, and we just have to be
ready to go, go, go," said head coach
Dick Gould.
The Card faced both Arizona
and Arizona State earlier this sea
son on the Farm, when Stanford
defeated both the Wildcats and Sun
Devils 6-1. But Gould knows that
circumstances change in the heat
and altitude and on the road.
"What we are focusing on
against the Arizona teams is our
doubles play," Gould said. "We won
only three out of six doubles match
es against the two teams earlier in
the season."
Stanford's one loss to Arizona
came in doubles play when fresh
men Bob and Mike Bryan fell to
Arizona's Henrik Wagner and Tom
Haugland 9-8, while sophomore
Ryan Wolters and junior Charles
Hoeveler fell to Wildcats Roland

Kupka and Mike Mackay 8-6.
"When Arizona won the doubles
point against us at home, they then
came out a little flat in singles,"
Gould said. "But when we play
there, it will be much harder for us
to jump on them and come back in
the singles with their home crowd."
Against Arizona State, the
Card's impressive No. 2 doubles
team of senior Grant Elliott and
freshman Geoff Abrams, who have
dropped only two doubles matches
all season, fell to Sun Devils Alex
Osterrieth and Ed Carter 8-6.
"All three of our doubles teams
suffered losses against the Arizona
teams," Gould said. In singles, the
Card took 11 of the 12 matches.
Following Stanford's Arizona
trip, it will return to the Farm to
take on tough competition next
week against California Tuesday
before closing out the regular sea
son against USC and UCLA April
18 and 19, respectively. Pac-lOs
begin April 24 at Ojai, Calif, with
NCAA play beginning May 9.
