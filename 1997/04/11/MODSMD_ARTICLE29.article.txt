## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford
crew team will lie hauling its boats
up northeast to face Washington,
Washington State and Gonzaga.
The regatta will he a mental and
physical challenge for hoth the
men's and women's crews a.s they

are still recovering from the long
road trip thi.s pn.st weekend in San
Diego.
Coming off a disappointing race
hist weekend in the San Diego
Crew Classic, the varsity men's
team had a solid week of practice
and is ready to take on Pacific JO
Conference rivals.
"We have shifted gears after

San I)iego. The intensity is up, and
we are starting to pick up good rac
ing speed," said head coach Wies
law Kujda. "I am expecting an
improvement in speed since Gon
zaga is always a tough opponent
and rising star of the l'ac-10."
However, the Cardinal varsity
men are competing without one of
their oarsman, sophomore Jason
Marsh, who broke his right femur
last weekend in San Diego. Gradu
ate student Grant Cutting is
expected to fill in for the injured
Marsh, who looks to l>e out for the
remainder of the season. While
(Jutting is less experienced than
Marsh, he has an edge in physical
strength.
Despite the tough regatta in
Washington, Kujda's eyes are
more focused on next weekend's
race against Oregon and Oregon
State.
"We have managed to beat
[Gonzaga] in the last three years,
hut this race will give us a good
push to make us faster in prepara
tion for Oregon and Oregon State
the following weekend," lie said.
Under coach Josh Burgel, the
novice men's team had a very hard
week of double practices every day
in preparation for this weekend.
"I think we will get even faster
this weekend," said novice oars
man Bryan Hoffman, a freshman

who might also be racing in the
junior varsity boat this weekend.
"And come home with a couple of
shirts," Hoffman added, referring
to the long-standing crew racing
tradition of the winning boat get
ting all the losing boats' shirts.
After coming off a disappointing

race last weekend, the varsity
women have a good chance to bet
ter the Cougars this weekend.
"After not doing as well as we
wanted to in San Diego, these guys
are ready for the big one," said
women's head coach Aimee Baker.
"The varsity has a good chance to
beat Washington State, and it will
be a matter of whoever is up that
day and has a better race."
Baker also has optimistic views
about the junior varsity boat this

weekend as this is the first time the
junior varsity boat has ever had the
opportunity to race against the
Huskies and Cougars, who haven't
been very competitive in the past.
"Washington and Washington
State always have fast JV teams;
however, the JV women are excited
to race," Baker said. "Last week
end, the JV lost by a small margin
against Washington State, so they
have a chance."
The novice women's race will

also be very close since the Cardi
nal barely edged the Cougars last
weekend. However, after Washing
ton State added 20 full scholar
ships, its program skyrocketed,
attracting the best high-school
rowers in the country.
"It is tough for the novice
women to compete against that
since they are much smaller in size,
and with a possible headwind this
weekend, larger bodies tend to do
better," Baker said.
