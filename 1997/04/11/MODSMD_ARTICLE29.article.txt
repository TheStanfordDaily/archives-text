This weekend the Stanford
crew team will lie hauling its boats
up northeast to face Washington,
Washington State and Gonzaga.
The regatta will he a mental and
physical challenge for hoth the
men's and women's crews a.s they

are still recovering from the long
road trip thi.s pn.st weekend in San
Diego.
Coming off a disappointing race
hist weekend in the San Diego
Crew Classic, the varsity men's
team had a solid week of practice
and is ready to take on Pacific JO
Conference rivals.
"We have shifted gears after

San I)iego. The intensity is up, and
we are starting to pick up good rac
ing speed," said head coach Wies
law Kujda. "I am expecting an
improvement in speed since Gon
zaga is always a tough opponent
and rising star of the l'ac-10."
However, the Cardinal varsity
men are competing without one of
their oarsman, sophomore Jason
Marsh, who broke his right femur
last weekend in San Diego. Gradu
ate student Grant Cutting is
expected to fill in for the injured
Marsh, who looks to l>e out for the
remainder of the season. While
(Jutting is less experienced than
Marsh, he has an edge in physical
strength.
Despite the tough regatta in
Washington, Kujda's eyes are
more focused on next weekend's
race against Oregon and Oregon
State.
"We have managed to beat
[Gonzaga] in the last three years,
hut this race will give us a good
push to make us faster in prepara
tion for Oregon and Oregon State
the following weekend," lie said.
Under coach Josh Burgel, the
novice men's team had a very hard
week of double practices every day
in preparation for this weekend.
"I think we will get even faster
this weekend," said novice oars
man Bryan Hoffman, a freshman
