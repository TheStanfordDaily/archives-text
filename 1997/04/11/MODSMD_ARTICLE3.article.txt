# Disability access issues still plague University, students
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Despite the University's emphasis on
equal treatment for all its students, some
are faced with daily barriers to their partic
ipation in Stanford life.
Most dormitories, buildings, restrooms,
labs, offices and till the community centers
on campus have few — if any — of the nec
essary facilities to allow access to students
with disabilities.
The charges
According to medical student Nathan
Watson, Stanford is "substantially less ac
cessible [to students with disabilities] than
any of the UC campuses."
Watson, leader of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union and a member of the
Americans with Disabilities Act task force,
also said Stanford is not in compliance with
federal and state law.
"It's a real social justice issue when stu
dents with disabilities are unable to fully
participate in the academic and social life of
the University," Watson said. "There's no
excuse for the current state of access of the
University."
The Americans with Disabilities Act —
civil rights legislation that prohibits dis
crimination against persons with disabili
ties — includes requirements that activi
ties, benefits and programs be made acces
sible to people with disabilities.
Bliss Temple, a coterminal student and
a member of Disabled Students of Stan
ford, said the University is not being
"proactive" in improving access for stu
dents with disabilities.

"Part of the problem is
that the administration is
really decentralized, and
people kind of pass the
buck and don't want to
take responsibility,"
Temple said.
Temple, who uses a
wheelchair, said her re
quests two years ago for
wheelchair-accessible

weight equipment in Arrillaga Family
Sports Center had gone unheeded. Temple
said she never filed a grievance, although
she knew of the grievance procedure.
"I don't have time to fight every disabil
ity issue that affects me. If I did, I wouldn't
have time for anything else," she said.
Some problems with facility access in
clude narrow doorways, stairs leading to
entrances, lack of vertical access in build
ings with more than one floor, lack of
wheelchair seating in lecture halls and
classrooms, d<x>rs without lever hardware
and decorative steps.
Few dormitories on campus have eleva
tors, according to Temple. The few select
student residences that do include Mir
rielees, Synergy House and Florence
Moore Hall.
Also, few facilities have Braille, and
there is no campus Braille map, according
to Watson.
The timeliness of renovations
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center, said the costs for ren
ovating the Old Union Clubhouse were es
timated to be between $150,000 and
$650,000, according to a recent study.

Yuen said if both elevators and ramps
were put in place, and all the changes to
doors and restrooms, signage and clear
ances were implemented, the costs would
most likely reach the maximum amount.
"There are extensive renovations being
conducted around campus, and I think this
is an ideal time to conduct renovation to
the clubhouse," Yuen said.
According to Rosa Gonzalez, associate
director of the Office of Multicultural De
velopment and an ADA / Section 504 com
pliant officer, surveys were conducted last
spring by a tusk force to identify barriers to
access and determine how to remove them.
Gonzalez said funding had been autho
rized for renovations to begin this summer
in the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center, which include the installation
of an elevator, improved restroom facilities
and access to entrances.
"It's really exciting, and I'm hoping this
is the first of many projects," she said.
When asked whether Stanford had a con
crete plan for improving disability access,
Gonzalez said the task force will meet
again to review other possibilities.
"This is part of the process, and that
does take a while, but we want to do it
right," Gonzalez said. "To my knowledge,
there has not been any finding that Stan
ford is in violation of the law."
Where the violations are
But according to Joseph Younse, occu
pational therapy consultant with the Cali
fornia State Department of Health Ser
vices, Stanford could be held by attorneys


Yuen
to be in violation of the law.
Younse said the key determinant
of whether an institution is in viola
tion of the ADA is whether it has an
adequate plan for implementing
changes to existing buildings.
Stanford "is in violation ... if
they in fact don't have a plan,"
Younse said. "If you get an attorney
in there, they're going to say it's an
inadequate plan — if it's going to
take this long in getting things done,
it could take 120 years."
Younse said the fastest way to fa
cilitate action is to sue the school.
According to Watson, "Stanford
likes to keep access worst where the
law is least clear — on libraries, on
faculty offices and on dorms."
Section 504 of the Education Re
habilitation Act of 1973 requires
that every program or activity at an
education institution be accessible to
people with disabilities, Watson said.
"A community center is a pro
gram and an activity, and it's inac
cessible to people with wheelchairs.
It's as in-your-face as you can get,"
Watson said.

Campus mobility problems
Senior Nicole Walden, co-chair of the
Disability Access Reform Team and
a member of the Stanford Civil Lib
erties Union, said the University is
only making minimal efforts to im
prove access.
The University "is dragging its
feet," Walden said. "They're moving
toward improvement, but many of
[the changes] aren't substantial
enough to really make a big differ
ence.
"They keep saying they're doing
everything they can, but I don't
think they are. I think the money is
usually there; it's a matter of distrib
ution," Walden added.
Sophomore Brad Harris, who is
blind, said the University "always
works on the little things and not the
big things" like wheelchair access to
buildings and Braille to help blind
students.
"There are lots of things that pre
vent us from getting to the Quad,"
such as construction, Harris said.
"If I'm looking for a building in
the Quad, I have to ask where the
building is, get in the general area,
ask somebody else where it is, get in
side and ask again where the room is.
If there were Braille, I could navigate

the same way you would," Harris
said.
Harris also said it may be difficult
for him to complete his computer sci
ence major because he cannot pro
gram graphics or access the UNIX
computers in Sweet Hall.
Joan Bisagno, director of the Dis
ability Resource Center, said the
center is "working hard to upgrade
to adaptable computer equipment
that would be useful for students
who are blind or learning disabled."
The new equipment would have
voice recognition systems and tech
no-graphics abilities.
"No university is perfect, and we
are at a university that was built in
times when there weren't codes for
things like accessibility," Bisagno
said. "So it's a matter of upgrading,
updating and making accessible very
old buildings in a way that complies
with the law."
But for many, the changes are too
slow in coming. Freshman Hsien
Hayward, who uses a wheelchair,
said accessibility routes to class
rooms are extremely circuitous.
"I feel like I'm getting a $30,000
workout," Hayward said.
"Stanford claims to have a plan to
upgrade accessibility, but they also
acknowledge that it's moving very

slowly due to financial reasons," she
said.
"But I have a problem with that,
considering they spend $20,000 for a
palm tree. Yet they can't make a lift
or anything to make the residences
accessible to all students."
Hayward added that she am not
visit friends who live on the second
floor of her dormitory.
"It's a constant reminder t hat at
Stanford, there is a lack of equality. I
do feel segregated and blocked off
from a lot of opportunities that I feel
should be and are required to be
made equal by law," I layward said.
Like Hayward, Temple said she
appreciated many individual faculty
members and students who under
stood her difficulties but said there is
no concerted efTort by the University
as a whole to improve access.
"There are some great people
here who understand disability is
sues, but the institutional struc
tures are not aware of disability is
sues and are not being proactive
about access," Temple said.
"I know there are a lot of con
cerned students, able-bodied and in
wheelchairs," said Hayward, "and
that's been really reassuring to me,
to have a lot of people voicing their
concerns."
