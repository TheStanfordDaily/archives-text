# Disability access issues still plague University, students
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Despite the University's emphasis on
equal treatment for all its students, some
are faced with daily barriers to their partic
ipation in Stanford life.
Most dormitories, buildings, restrooms,
labs, offices and till the community centers
on campus have few — if any — of the nec
essary facilities to allow access to students
with disabilities.
The charges
According to medical student Nathan
Watson, Stanford is "substantially less ac
cessible [to students with disabilities] than
any of the UC campuses."
Watson, leader of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union and a member of the
Americans with Disabilities Act task force,
also said Stanford is not in compliance with
federal and state law.
"It's a real social justice issue when stu
dents with disabilities are unable to fully
participate in the academic and social life of
the University," Watson said. "There's no
excuse for the current state of access of the
University."
The Americans with Disabilities Act —
civil rights legislation that prohibits dis
crimination against persons with disabili
ties — includes requirements that activi
ties, benefits and programs be made acces
sible to people with disabilities.
Bliss Temple, a coterminal student and
a member of Disabled Students of Stan
ford, said the University is not being
"proactive" in improving access for stu
dents with disabilities.

"Part of the problem is
that the administration is
really decentralized, and
people kind of pass the
buck and don't want to
take responsibility,"
Temple said.
Temple, who uses a
wheelchair, said her re
quests two years ago for
wheelchair-accessible

weight equipment in Arrillaga Family
Sports Center had gone unheeded. Temple
said she never filed a grievance, although
she knew of the grievance procedure.
"I don't have time to fight every disabil
ity issue that affects me. If I did, I wouldn't
have time for anything else," she said.
Some problems with facility access in
clude narrow doorways, stairs leading to
entrances, lack of vertical access in build
ings with more than one floor, lack of
wheelchair seating in lecture halls and
classrooms, d<x>rs without lever hardware
and decorative steps.
Few dormitories on campus have eleva
tors, according to Temple. The few select
student residences that do include Mir
rielees, Synergy House and Florence
Moore Hall.
Also, few facilities have Braille, and
there is no campus Braille map, according
to Watson.
The timeliness of renovations
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center, said the costs for ren
ovating the Old Union Clubhouse were es
timated to be between $150,000 and
$650,000, according to a recent study.

Yuen said if both elevators and ramps
were put in place, and all the changes to
doors and restrooms, signage and clear
ances were implemented, the costs would
most likely reach the maximum amount.
"There are extensive renovations being
conducted around campus, and I think this
is an ideal time to conduct renovation to
the clubhouse," Yuen said.
According to Rosa Gonzalez, associate
director of the Office of Multicultural De
velopment and an ADA / Section 504 com
pliant officer, surveys were conducted last
spring by a tusk force to identify barriers to
access and determine how to remove them.
Gonzalez said funding had been autho
rized for renovations to begin this summer
in the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center, which include the installation
of an elevator, improved restroom facilities
and access to entrances.
"It's really exciting, and I'm hoping this
is the first of many projects," she said.
When asked whether Stanford had a con
crete plan for improving disability access,
Gonzalez said the task force will meet
again to review other possibilities.
"This is part of the process, and that
does take a while, but we want to do it
right," Gonzalez said. "To my knowledge,
there has not been any finding that Stan
ford is in violation of the law."
Where the violations are
But according to Joseph Younse, occu
pational therapy consultant with the Cali
fornia State Department of Health Ser
vices, Stanford could be held by attorneys
