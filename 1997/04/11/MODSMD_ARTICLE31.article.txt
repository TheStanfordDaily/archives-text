# Women aim sights on MPSF title
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team hopes to start postsea
son play with a bang this weekend
in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship tourna
ment in Santa Barbara, Calif.
"We have two goals this week
end, first to retain our No. 2 rank
ing, and second to beat UCLA,"
said head coach Ben Quittner.
The second-ranked Cardinal
will have three opening-round
games, starting with USC today
at 10 a.m., before it has the oppor
tunity to face the Bruins. Later
today, Stanford will face off
against Pacific at 4 p.m. before
facing San Diego State at 11:15
tomorrow morning. The Card has
had its way with each of these
three teams previously this sea
son, having yet to drop a game to
any of them.
San Diego State will be the
toughest of the first round teams,
said sophomore goalkeeper
Heather Crary. "We haven't
played them in a long time, and
they have picked it up," Crary
said. However, the Aztecs strug
gled when they faced the Cardinal
at the beginning of the season.
If the Cardinal, who won the
northern division of the MPSF
during the regular season,
advances out of its bracket, it will
play in the semifinals tomorrow
at 2:30 p.m.
Things will get much tougher
for the Card then as it will more
than likely face either top-ranked
UCLA or No. 3 California. Stan
ford is coming off a 5-4 victoiy
over the Golden Bears in
deGuerre Pool April 3, which
bumped Cal out of the No. 2
national ranking and gave it to
Stanford.
"We really feel confident, espe
cially after beating Cal," Crary
said.
The Cardinal has yet to beat
the Bruins this season and still
feels the sting of three one-goal
losses to UCLA, including an
overtime loss at the Stanford Invi
tational in early March.
The Stanford women will have
to be running on all cylinders if

they are to gain the MPSF crown.
The Cardinal has been led this
season by freshman sensations
Ellen Estes and Suze Gardner,
who lead the team in scoring.
Stanford has also found invalu
able the experience and play of
senior co-captain Alice Cathcart.
But it will be a team effort sim
ilar to the one that produced the
victory over Cal that will put the

Card over the top. Junior Julie
Baker and sophomore co-captain
Lindsay Tam came off the bench
during that game to score three of
the five goals.
"We need everyone to play well
— both the bench, who needs to
pick it up like Julie did against
Cal, and the starters, who need to
be at their best," Craiy said.
The Card is usually a first-half

team and will net*! to carry that
through the entire game in order
to hold its own against both
UCI.A and Cal.
"We need to be a great team,
and we can be a great team if we
can be consistent for four quar
ters," Quittner said.
If Stanford advances through
the semifinals, the finals will he at
1 p.m. Sunday.
