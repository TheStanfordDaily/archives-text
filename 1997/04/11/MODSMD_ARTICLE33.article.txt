# THE 						WAR MEMORIES OF A DISTINGUISHED VETERAN
## 
### 


It was fun being in uniform. People respected soldiers back then.


I was shot down over Germany and should have been
executed. However, Hitler let me off because I intro
duced him to the beauty of Wordsworth.


I got brain damage when I escaped from Germany. Luckily,
due to recent medical advances at the time, they were able
to replace my brain with a hamster on a treadmill.


I also got a medal for sucking all the snot out of Winston Churchill's nose in
time for the Yalta Conference.


When the pressure of war got too much for Gen. Eisenhower I
used to cheer him up by giving him a Wet Willy.

That's all I can remember.
