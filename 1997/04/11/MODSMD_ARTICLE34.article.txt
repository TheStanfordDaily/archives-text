My psychotherapist cklia cruz
and I were discussing (lie other day
how I could make myself useful to
society without causing severe burns
or dental harm to anyone. Celia suggested I take
up community service, but that sounded suspi
ciously like the sort of thing movie stars are sen
tenced to do when they drive into someone's
porch or got a blowjob in a residential area.
I told her maybe I should do something
along thf lines of starting a cult or perhaps
even get one of those things that people do
jobs. I think they're called. But Celia replied
that there are no jobs for people whose only tal
ent is bumping into stationary objects, so 1

(bund myself deeply depressed. I went home and watched the telly,
thinking I was just another demographic in some TV executive's
Nielsen pool, simply another stop in my mailman's route, another
name in the phone directory and so on; you my point.
Having reached rock bottom. I did what any other person would
do m my place: I called my psychic friend Recognizing my voice, she
pretended it wasn't her and that 1 had the wrong number. But 1 per
sisted. and she finally told me what 1 should do. It was so obvious I
almost wanted to get mv money back: She told me I should become a
resident assistant.
Of course! An R.V A vital part of Residential Education! An
instrument for carrying out the goals and missions of an essential
part of Stanford life. I was so happy to find such new direction in life
I accidentally dropped a bottle of acid on Pascha. my cat. the poor
dear. She has a big "X" now where her tail should be.
I got an application, arranged for a fake name and asked two of
my most recent one-night stands to provide recommendations I
wasn't sure if Res Kd would let a chemically unbalanced, mentally
disturbed, physically repulsive recovering alcoholic like me get a
position, so I decided to really impress them with my resume.

In mv essays 1 wrote about overcoming the
adversity of being the only girl in my middle
school whose last name stood for the violent,
barbaric, destructive tendencies of the human
psyche according to a major 20th-century
thinker. I was often teased about it, and my
teachers forced me to eat my meals alone at a
corner for fear that 1 might unleash havoc and
destruction in the playground.
I felt they were overzealous about it,
although 1 did once start a fire by squinting too
hard while reading a book. That was embar
rassing. especially since it happened on the
first day of school.
Anyway, 1 wrote a heartfelt application

essay, talking about my love and delight in curing dog illnesses
through alternative medicine and vampirie practices, related my
experiences in Africa as a nomadic palm tree and told them how 1
stopped out last quarter so 1 could recover from a major drug over
dose.
As educational programming. I suggested a voodoo-ritual work
shop. a panel with local gypsy queens and a variation on the Res Ed
game. "Crossing the Line." in which people who cross the line fall
into a bottomless hole and turn up in an Communist town wrecked
by civil war and deforestation.
I feel 1 would be such a lovely HA. although I do worry about
accidentally breaking a resident's neck by lifting him up with my
telepathic powers. 1 think I'm qualified and would definitely bring
diversity to the RA pool. 1 mean, how many RAs can claim that
they've been exorcised five times ami can read people's thoughts at
wili?
Of course, ultimately it will be up to Rt>s Ed to decide And if
they don't hire me. heck. 1 can always go back to practicing voodoo
ism and hitting people on their heads with bottles of Jack Daniels.
Because c i'st la vie,'
