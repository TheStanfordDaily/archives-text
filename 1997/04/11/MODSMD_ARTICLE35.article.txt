•Always beat up the fat kid. If there are two
fat kids, beat both of them up.
•If a girl asks you to play with her, push her
in a muddy puddle and stomp on her face.
•People getting hit in the crotch is the funni
est thing in the world. Farting noises are the
second funniest. People spewing liquid out of
their nostrils comes in a strong third.
•If you're unpopular that means you smell; if
you smell that means you're unpopular.
•There is nothing cooler than having an ear
piercing, apart from having two ear pierc
ings.
•People who are different are there for your
entertainment.
•Even though life is shit, people still claim
that these are the best years of your life.
