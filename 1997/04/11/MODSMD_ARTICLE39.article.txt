The 1997-98 resident fellows are ready to
take root.
A committee composed of current resident
assistants, RFs and Director of Residential Ed
ucation Jane Camarillo met during the last two
weeks of winter quarter to select the new live
in faculty.
Although many former RFs will be return
ing next year, there will be more than 15 new
faces when fall quarter commences.
Among those selected were Anne and Bob
Royalty. The couple, whose family includes 1-
year-old Virginia and 5-year-old Nolen, will be
living in Florence Moore East. Anne Royalty is
an assistant professor in the Department of
Economics, and her husband is a lecturer in
the Humanities track of Cultures, Ideas and
Values.
They expressed excitement about their fu-

ture involvement with the Stanford communi
ty.
"We love students," Bob Royalty said.
"We're interested in being part of the Universi
ty in a bigger way."
In preparation for fall quarter, the Royaltys
are presently sifting through a thick stack of
1997-98 RA applications.
"We'll have a staff of nine RAs," Bob said.
"We're putting a lot of our time and energy into
creating a really diverse staff."
Greg Beroza, a professor in the Geophysics
Department, and Eva Huala, a postdoctoral fel
low in plant biology at the Carnegie Institution,
will move into Rinconada, an all-freshman
dorm, in mid-August.
"I hope to create an environment that stu
dents will look forward to coming home to,"
Beroza said. "Part of our mission is to foster. . .
education outside of the classroom."
"I've been at Stanford for about seven years
now," Beroza, who co-teaches the ever-popular

"Natural Hazards and Man" course in the fall.
"I empathize with the more playful aspects of
learning."
Bob and Carrie Franciscus, who plan to re
side next year in Adams House, the human bi
ology theme dorm, settled at Stanford after
traveling the globe. Their journeys have includ
ed stays in Germany and Japan.
"Both of us are widely traveled," Bob Fran
ciscus said. "I'd like to bring some of those ex
periences to the house as well."
Franciscus, an assistant professor in the An
thropology Department, hopes to initiate a vari
ety of programs covering everything from the re
construction of life from the skeleton to bad B
movies.
"We hope to just get more involved in the
Stanford community," he said.
In taking up residence with the students, all
of the new RFs hope to both increase their own
involvement in the Stanford community and
enrich the lives of their student residents.
