# Values still inspire activism, Harris says

During the 19605, student ac
tivism reached an apex in scope
and power which many feel can
never be duplicated. But where
does this leave the current gener
ation of students? What are their
fights and how can they fight
them?
David Harris, who served as
Stanford's student body presi
dent in 1966-67 before resigning
to form an anti-draft organiza
tion called The Resistance, does
not pretend to have all the an
swers. Harris, an author and
journalist, spoke to an audience
of about 300 overflowing Tresid
der Union's Oak West Room last
night, stressing that students
still have the power to effect
change through personal values.
"We live in a world where you
have to deal with what is over the
horizon," he said. "Problems
today do not have the immediacy
that the [Vietnam] War did. But
what we choose to see, know and
value has immediacy. . . . Ad
dressing mundane things is not
dishonorable; it is the process
through which you make change
which is important," Harris said.
Harris displayed his convic
tion during the Vietnam War
conflict by returning his student
deferment, which would have al
lowed him exception to the draft,
knowing he would resist his sub
sequent drafting and go to jail.
He served two years in federal
prison.
The motivation for student ac
tivism during the '60s was not a
particularly sophisticated politi
cal consciousness, Harris said.
Instead, the drive came from
what students had been taught
was right or wrong, in part from
their high school civics classes.

These values inspired stu
dents at Stanford to travel to Mis
sissippi to help guarantee voting
rights for blacks and work to end
segregation, Harris said.
"We were operating under a
simple American truism — that
you should be able to vote with
out your life being threatened,"
Harris said. "In Mississippi, we
were able to take our values and
use them as a tool to tear down
segregation."
According to Harris, the expe
rience of his generation also
proves that those who feel that
they have little power in a society
can be the ones who create im
portant change.
Activists in the 1960s "were
not the people who sat at the top
of the pyramid, but rather the
people who at that point were the
most insignificant — people 19-,
20-, 21-years-old, most who
couldn't even vote yet," Harris
said.
Harris said his generation did
not start as pacifist, but was
rather "raised by John Wayne"
and the concept that Americans
"were defined by what they
fought for."
Comparisons between his
generation and today's youth and
the characterization of today's
youth as "apathetic" is unfair, ac
cording to Harris.
"I apologize to this generation
of students for the way my gener
ation ... has been used against
every generation of students that
has come through after us," Har
ris said. "Rather than be used as
a yardstick, I would hope that
what we did be used as a step
ping-stone."
According to Harris, students
face problems similar to those of
his generation today, including a
lack of representation in univer
sity power structures.
