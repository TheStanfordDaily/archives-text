Emily Andrus and Ben
Decker want to clean up
the ASSU from the inside
out.
Andrus, a junior candi
date for ASSU president,
and Decker, her vice-presi-

dential running mate and also a junior, want a lot
of things. They want better communication be
tween students and University administration.
They want a more active student government.
And they want it all under a guiding theme
that puts campus concerns first.
"We have a real common-sense vision of what
needs to be done on this campus," Andrus said.
An Andrus-Decker administration, she em
phasized, would take a realistic look at the
ASSU's capabilities and try to maximize the as
sociation's potential. "We want to ensure things
run smoothly and don't fall through the cracks,"
