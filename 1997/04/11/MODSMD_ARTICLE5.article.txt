### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Emily Andrus and Ben
Decker want to clean up
the ASSU from the inside
out.
Andrus, a junior candi
date for ASSU president,
and Decker, her vice-presi-

dential running mate and also a junior, want a lot
of things. They want better communication be
tween students and University administration.
They want a more active student government.
And they want it all under a guiding theme
that puts campus concerns first.
"We have a real common-sense vision of what
needs to be done on this campus," Andrus said.
An Andrus-Decker administration, she em
phasized, would take a realistic look at the
ASSU's capabilities and try to maximize the as
sociation's potential. "We want to ensure things
run smoothly and don't fall through the cracks,"

she said.
The candidates have ambitious
goals for the ASSU — including
group funding reform, a greater stu
dent voice in University affairs and
increased student services — and
they feel that all of them fall easily
into the scope of the ASSU's influ
ence.
If is rare, of course, to find a can
didate that admits he or she has set
unattainable goals. But Andrus and
Decker feel that their collective ex
perience gives their claims cre
dence.
Andrus played an active role in
the ASSII senate this year, chair
ing the Appropriations Committee
and serving on the Budget and Fi
nance Committee. Last year, she
served on the ASSU Program
Board. Outside of the ASSU, she
has had experience with dorm gov
ernment and leadership roles in
several student organizations, in
cluding the Asian American Stu
dents Association.
While never formally involved
with the ASSU, Decker draws polit
ical experience from the Interfra
ternity Council, dorm government
and a variety of academic organiza
tions.
Andrus feels that her experience
has given her |>erspective on what
the ASSU can and cannot do. And
while she has supported the current
president and vice president, Bill
Shen and Nick Thompson, in sever
al activist causes that reach beyond
the Stanford campus, her ASSU vi
sion deals more with internal issues.
said the main grwil of that
vision is "not focusingon big crusades
but getting the ASSI I in order."

Specifically, the duo wants to
better use the ASSU's existing re
sources. An example of this, Decker
said, is in the large number of un
filled seats on University adminis
trative committees that allow for
student representatives.
By not appointing students to
these committees, he said, the ASSU
sends a message of apathy to the ad
ministration that directly contra
dicts complaints that students have
little voice in University policy mak
ing.
Andrus also wants to tap the
ASSU's organizational skills and
financial resources to expand stu
dent services on campus. She
would like to see more action from
the ASSU on behalf of students,
both directly and in the form of
support for new student groups.
Such groups would follow the lead
of Stop Monopolies on Campus,
which was created earlier this year
by students to offer an alternative
to the Bookstore.
Oneway to make the ASSU more
efficient, Decker said, is to better
synthesize the office of the presi
dent with the ASSU Senate and
dorm governments. Decker said he
would tike an active role in coordi
nating these relationships.
Finally, Andrus and Decker said
their administration would work
to better communicate with stu
dents. They want students to feel
not only that the ASSU is open to
their suggestions but also that it is
actively seeking out student opin
ion.
In terms of communication,
Shen and Thompson "have done
good things," Decker said. "Their
office has been open, if people come
to the office."
But Andrus wants more than
just an open door. "We want to take
it out of the office," she said.
