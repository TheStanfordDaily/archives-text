# Andersen is casting the Net on campus
## Contest helps Bookstore 
### Corey Fugman Contributing writer 
Imagine going online, punch
ing in your courses und biking to
the Bookstore to pick up your en
tire quarter's reading list already
organized and waiting for you.
No more waiting in line for the
course materials binder? No more
saying "excuse me" as you push
past other students with your un
wieldy basket?
Sound impossible? Well, it
probably is, but someday soon,
buying course supplies could be
nearly this easy.
Through Andersen Consult
ing's Web Challenge contest,
Stanford undergraduates are in
vited to help make this pipe
dream a reality.
The premise of Web Challenge

is that students, in teams of two
to four, create demo World Wide
Web sites for the Bookstore. The
Internet sites will focus on fash
ioning and providing new student
and faculty services.
Brian Sprague, associate part
ner at Andersen and a 1982 Stan
ford graduate, organized the con
test and said these sites should be
thought of as "informational ve
hicles" that could provide brand
new services to the Stanford com
munity.
According to Sprague and
Bookstore CEO Peggy Mendel
son, sites created for the competi
tion could put much-needed in
formation, such as course book
lists, on the Web.
Other ideas include the possi
ble creation of sites that would
identify the times when lines are
shortest for customers and sites
on which students can submit
their course lists and have their
books waiting for them by the
time they get to the Bookstore.
Due to the work-intensive na
ture of the latter idea, it is the
prospect that is least likely to
happen. Mendelson said jokingly
that in order for this to work, she
would need "a bunch of little
elves."
Web sites for the contest might
also be focused on faculty-related
issues. For example, instructors
could submit course lists online
as well as check on availability of
books.
Despite already having a Web
site for their off-campus, for
profit outlet, the Bookstore has

not instituted a page for the main
store.
Mendelson said plans for a fu
ture site had been mentioned but
not finalized. When Sprague ap
proached them with the opportu
nity to create a campus-only Web
site, the Bookstore swiftly
agreed.
The student organization Stop
Monopolies on Campus already
has a Web site for book buyers as
an alternative to the Bookstore.
Junior Danny Bramzon,
founder of SMOC, commented on
Web Challenge's proposed Web
site. By following his organiza
tion's lead into cyberspace,
Bramzon said, the Bookstore
would be able "to better serve the
student community."
SMOC Vice President Eric
Friedman, a sophomore, agreed.
"I'm glad that they're looking to
provide more services to the stu
dents," he said. "I'm very inter
ested to see what comes out of it."
Mendelson was optimistic

about the possibilities that the
contest poses. "We are very excit
ed to be part of the challenge, and
we hope that some wonderfully
creative ideas will come along
that will help bring this Web site
to reality," she said.
Trish Keady, marketing man
ager at the Bookstore, said the
sites will offer many services. She
encouraged contestants to be cre
ative.
"We want to give people a
chance to work to their strengths.
. . . We are thrilled to see what
students will come up with," she
said.
There is $2,250 in prize money
available for winning sites; there
is $1,000 allotted for first place,
$750 for second and $500 for
third. Along with the cash prize,
contestants would have the op
portunity to eventually imple
ment their sites on the Web.
The Internet is being used as
the contest's medium because "it
is altering the way we work, shop

and play," Sprague said. "We are
finding that our clients are get
ting tangled in the Web."
According to Sprague, Web
Challenge will "make sure people
are aware of things that they can
do in a business environment."
Andersen has set up a Web
server dedicated to the contest.
Interested parties can find more
information by visiting
www.wwwchallenge.com. An in
formational meeting will be held
at Tresidder Union next Tues
day.
The contest will last only three
weeks, with final presentations
taking place in early May. Stan
ford professors, Andersen profes
sionals and outside technology
experts will be judging the com
pleted projects.
Teams are encouraged to be as
creative as possible and to ap
proach the contest as a real-life
opportunity. "This event will be a
microcosm of real-world applica
tions," Sprague said.
