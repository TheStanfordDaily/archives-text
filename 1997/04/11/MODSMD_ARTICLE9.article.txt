Rebels take Lubumbashi, issue ultimatum
GOMA, Zaire (AP) — Rebel leader Laurent Kabila gave Zaire's
president an ultimatum yesterday — three days to resign and
retreat to his home village — and announced that rebels have
taken the country's second-largest city.
Although fighting continued early yesterday on the outskirts of
Lubumbashi, Kabila declared a three-day "pause" in his military
advance to await a call from the capital indicating President Mobu
tu Sese Seko will resign.
"In three days, if we will not get good news from Kinshasa of his
willingness to depart to the north, then we will be forced to con
tinue the military advance," Kabila told reporters at a news con
ference at his Goma headquarters.
The rebel leader, who has captured one-third of Zaire since
September, refused to elaborate on his ultimatum, saying only:
"The loser is him if he doesn't take our advice."
U.N. staff reported gunfire and explosions in the general direc
tion of the Lubumbashi airport, spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt
said in New York.
"It seems there are pockets of resistance, but everything seems
to indicate that indeed the city has fallen to the alliance," he said.
The rebels today advised all foreigners to get out of Kinshasa as
soon as possible, claiming they were already in the capital.
Russia lambastes NASA
MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's space agency lashed back at NASA
yesterday, charging the Americans with exaggerating troubles
aboard the Mir space station and losing their nerve over minor
glitches.
"We would ask the Americans: What kind of experts are you to
think about deserting this unique space platform?" Viktor Blagov,
deputy chief of the Russian Space Mission Control Center, told
The Associated Press.
The Mir, the world's only manned space station, has had a run
of bad luck: a fire in February, the failure of the main oxygen-gen
erating system last month and leaking coolant loops that over
heated the main living module to 86 degrees last week.
But Russian officials insist those problems can be fixed soon
and don't mean the 11-year-old orbital outpost, designed to last
only five years, has become unsafe.
The two countries' space agencies have been at odds for
months, mostly over the Russians' failure to deliver on time a crit
ical piece of the international space station that will replace the
Mir.
But the Mir's accidents have worsened relations considerably, in
part because there is an American astronaut aboard and in part
because the Russians have been less-than-forthcoming with details.
