Advisory referendum
An advisory referendum that asks the Board of Trustees to give students
more of a voice in its decisions will be included on the ballot. It asks the
following questions:
•Should students and faculty have more input on decisions
made by the Board of Trustees?
•Should students be able to elect at least one voting member to
the full Board of Trustees, with full trustee privileges?
•Should students and faculty have voting privileges on the full
Board of Trustees?
