# Woods scores youngest Masters win
## At 18 under par, Woods posts lowest score in history of golf's Masters 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Ultimately, Tiger Woods' record-setting
Masters victory yesterday was more about .Jack Nicklaus than Jack
ie Robinson.
The rollicking cheers mid waves of affection that carried Woods
through the final few holes and onto the 18th green at Augusta
National Golf Club made that clear.
His golf game seemed to make it inevitable.
When the green jacket was draped over the shoulders of the 21-
year-old champion, golf greeted not just the first black to win a major
professional championship, but also a player of the talent, intelli
gence and discipline to achieve his goal of being the best to ever play
the game.
After making his final putt, Woods became a kid again, squeezing
his eyes tight, fighting back tears and hugging his father, Earl, who
taught him the game, and his mother, Tida.
"My dad said last night, 'If you play well and be yourself, it would
be the most rewarding round you've ever had."' Tiger said.
"Phenomenal performance," Nick Faldo, last year's winner, told
Woods. "Welcome to the green jacket."
Closing with a 69, Woods finished at 18-undor-par '270, the lowest
score ever shot in the Masters and matching the most under par by
anyone in any of the four Grand Slam events.
His 12-stroke victory over Tom Kite was not only a Masters record
by three strokes, but the greatest winning margin in any major since
Tom Morris Sr. won in the 18G2 British Open by 13 strokes.
And, for another record, the 21-year-old Woods became the
youngest golfer ever to win the Masters.
Entering yesterday with a nine-stroke lead over Costantino Rocca,
the final round was a mere formality which he handled perfectly.
"He's out there playing another game on a golf course he is going
to own for a long time," said Nicklaus, who won the Masters at 23
and has six titles-more than anyone else. "I don't think I want to go
back out and be 21 and compete against him."
What Woods did this week at Augusta means that anything is pos
sible.
The Grand Slam — winning the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open
and PGA in the same year — is not out of the question for Woods,
and breaking the record low score of 59 for a competitive round could
be only a matter of time.
A scintillating 66 followed by a (55 in the middle two rounds —
when only one other player could shoot a 66 — proved that, and
ended the tournament.
Woods' remarkable accomplishments as a golfer, however, almost
overshadowed yet another significant achievement:
His victory came just two days shy of 50 years after Jackie Robin
son became the first black to play major league baseball.
