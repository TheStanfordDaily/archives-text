# GOP awaits Reno's recommendation in fund-raising inquiry

WASHINGTON (AP) - Congress
should investigate Attorney General
Janet Reno if she rejects Republican
demands for an independent counsel to
look into Democratic campaign fund rais
ing, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
yesterday.
For his part, the chairman of the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, said the attorney general
"becomes a major issue" if she decides
there are no grounds to seek a special
counsel. There were even calls for her to
resign if that is her verdict.

Reno will announce her decision
tomorrow, which other GOP leaders
including Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, said
they expect to be that an independent
counsel should not be appointed.
The .Justice Department and both
chambers of Congress already are exam
ining Democratic fund-raising activities,
including possible illegal contributions
from foreign nationals. Republicans say
Reno should ask a court to appoint an
independent counsel, as she did for
Whitewater and three other scandals

involving Clinton administration offi
cials, to ensure against conflicts of inter
est.
The independent counsel law requires
evidence that senior executive branch
officials are involved before the attorney
general can move for a separate investi
gation. Indications are that Reno will
decide that stipulation has not been met.
"That's the sort of vibration I'm get
ting, too. I think she will say no," Hyde,
R-111., said on ABC's "This Week
Gingrich and other Republicans
promised consequences for such a deci

sion. If she says no, Gingrich said on
"Fox News Sunday," "I think at that
point I would ask Chairman Henry Hyde
to investigate what we can do." Hyde's
probe, Gingrich said, should include
investigating "Reno and what is the next
step we should take."
One step would be to ask her to
respond under oath as to why slit; didn't
tell President Clinton about FBI evidence
that China was trying to pour money into
last year's presidential election, Gingrich
said.
Gingrich also accused House

Democrats of trying to cover up what he
called "the most extraordinary act of sys
tematically violating American law."
Hatch said that Reno should at least
initiate a 90-day preliminary investiga
tion to determine whether an outside
investigation is needed.
Rep. Henry Waxinan of California,
reacted on CNN's "Late Kdition," saying
that for Gingrich "to question our patrio
tism is pretty pathetic."
Gingrich and the Republicans are
seeking to cover up "a partisan witch
hunt," Waxinan said.
