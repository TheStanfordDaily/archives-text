FDR memorial to open soon
WASHINGTON (AP) — FDR claimed not to want it, 40 years of
bickering delayed it, and now that it's here, there's still argument
about it. Despite all that, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial is
almost ready for visitors.
The clamor to build a memorial to the only president elected to four
terms began days after his death on April 12, 1945. But it was nearly
50 years later, in October 1994, that construction started.
Unusual for such an edifice, the memorial also will honor Eleanor
Roosevelt, the highly visible first lady who acted as her husband's eyes
and ears in her travels and also as his liberal conscience.
There has been controversy over whether Roosevelt should be
depicted in a wheelchair, given that he went to great lengths to conceal
his disability. None of the monument's three statues of Roosevelt sug

gests a wheelchair or the steel braces he wore;.
But the references to his disability are there. On the wall in room
four, in a listing of significant events, is this inscription: " 1921, Strick
en with Poliomyelitis. He never again walked unaided." And in the
memorial's entry building is an exact replica of one of FDR's
wheelchairs; nearby is one of two known photographs of him in one.
The memorial cost $48 million, $42.5 million from a federal appro
priation and the rest from private sources.
It is the first memorial in the nation's capital purposely designed to
be wheelchair accessible. As it should be.
