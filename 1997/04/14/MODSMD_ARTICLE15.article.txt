Proposed judicial charter,
although not perfect, is a
much-needed overhaul

Almost a year ago, the
Committee of 15 was charged
with a daunting task: rewrite
the University's Legislative and
Judicial Charter in such a way as to
affirm the importance of the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard,
guarantee students a role in estab
lishing judicial policy and protect
the rights of both the accused and
the accuser in the judicial process.
What the committee came up
with — the document on which the
student body will vote this Wednes
day and Thursday — addresses suc
cessfully the legal issues set before
it and establishes a judicial system
fair to all parties involved.
Existing problems
The committee's job was so
monumental in nature because
the judicial system it started from
was, to say the least, a mess.
Implemented in 1968 — a time of
political upheaval and massive
student protests — the old charter
did not ensure the rights of due
process to an accused student nor
did it give students any say in
adjudicating their peers' cases.
Under the old charter, students
could not even hope for a totally
impartial hearing if they were
accused of violating the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard
because the same person who was
prosecuting them would also be
advising them. This person would
also be the sole determiner of guilt
or innocence — a concept that
directly contradicts a sacred Amer
ican ideal, a jury of one's peers.
Without student involvement,
the old system failed to win the
trust of either students or faculty.
Lacking any faith in the system,
faculty often did not bother to file
complaints, and, even worse, stu
dents saw little importance of the
Honor Code in upholding the hon
esty and respect of the Stanford
community.
What's been fixed
Realizing that restoring student
involvement and trust was
paramount to the success of any
new system, the committee set out
to do just that. The new charter
ameliorates its predecessor's most
grievous errors in three ways: It
provides for greater impartiality,
individual rights and a responsive
ness to change.
Greater impartiality. This
area represents the greatest leap
forward in making the process
more equal and fair. In place of one
administrator who both advises
and prosecutes, there will be a
judicial adviser, who assists both
the accused and the complainant,
and a judicial officer, who gathers
both incriminating and exculpato
ry evidence and determines
whether the charges against a stu
dent are, in fact, valid.
This separation of powers should
give accused students far less rea
son to believe that the University is
"out to get them," and it is an
attempt to settle the matter in the
most effective way possible. On a
more practical level, two adminis
trators instead of one should
streamline the system; the commit
tee predicts that the entire judicial
process — from filing of charges to
notification of guilt or innocence to
students — should take about 10
weeks. Under the old system, a ease
could drag on for months.
In addition, a student's case will
be heard by a judicial panel, rather

than by a single administrator.
The panel will be composed of six
members, four of whom are stu
dents, and will be chaired by one of
the student members. This panel
will be selected from a larger judi
cial panel pool so that no one who
may have a conflict of interest in
the case will actually hear the case.
Also, those members of the pool
who are not hearing the case are
available to counsel the accused as
to their rights.
These measures place the great
est responsibility for the judicial
process on the shoulders of stu
dents. Considering that the Honor
Code is designed to enhance stu
dents' experiences at Stanford, it
is appropriate that students decide
how the Honor Code, or rather the
violations of the Honor Code, will
play out. The judicial panels and
the separation of administrators'
powers provide students with the
tools they need to ensure that the
Honor Code is upheld.
Individual rights. The new
charter also will give students
many of the rights defendants
enjoy in criminal and civil trials:
the right to a public hearing, the
right to confront and cross-exam
ine witnesses, the right to counsel
and the right to an appeal. More
over, the new charter has retained
the important "beyond a reason
able doubt" clause.
However, many of these rights
are defined vaguely in the charter
— a fact that correctly emphasizes
the administrative nature of these
judicial proceedings. For example,
the charter gives counsel the
ambiguous ability to "assist" a
client and protects witnesses from
undue embarrassment. Such
clauses will help prevent judicial
hearings from turning into lawyer
dominated proceedings and shield
witnesses from excessive harass
ment in delicate cases such as
those involving sexual assault.
Responsiveness to change.
The charter will create a standing
Board on Judicial Affairs com
posed of students, faculty and
administrators that will have the
power to modify bylaws under the
charter. This body will be able to
respond to significant student or
faculty issues that arise at any
time and then incorporate them
into the document. This flexibility
should prevent the need to insti
tute another set of year-long delib
erations when the charter must be
further updated and revised.
It deserves passage
Although the charter had its
detractors along the way, the final
version seems to address many
concerns — most notably it now
protects the accused's right to an
open hearing, as guaranteed by the
ASSU Constitution. There are still
some issues (defining counsel's
role) that need to be taken up by
the Judicial Board and other issues
(education about the Honor Code)
that haven't been addressed at all.
Nevertheless, the committee,
headed by Geophysics Prof. Mark
Zoback, has done a remarkable job
of incorporating student input into
the highly workable document that
ultimately emerged.
The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard are central to
fostering a community of respect
and trust, and the judicial char
ter's main purpose is to protect the
sanctity of this code.
The charter on which students
will vote this week upholds these
standards in a fair, equitable way
and allows them a tremendous
voice in determining the future of
these standards. Passing this new
charter will, at long last, provide
Stanford with a judicial system
that works.
