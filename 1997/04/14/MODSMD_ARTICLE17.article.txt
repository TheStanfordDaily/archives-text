## Excuse me, you got a clue? 
### 
IT IS MONDAY, which means I have
slept later because the crossword
puzzle is the easiest today. It gets
harder as the week goes on. No "metas
tasize" or "inculcate" or "prestidigita
tor" on Mondays. The morning will be a
little smoother and a little less satisfying
because of it. There is something to be
said, though, for crossword epiphanies,
the flushed sense of pride that comes
from figuring out something that was
meant to be figured out by someone with
a much fuller education.
It is difficult to write about cross
word puzzles simply because crossword
puzzles are something you write in, not
about. But I am trying, namely because
the puzzle is the most underappreciated
feature of this newspaper but perhaps
the most popular, even though it has no
student hook or overt connection to
anyone's life. Yet at 10:15, all across
campus, you can see people squinting at
little boxes, whispering to the person
sitting next to them in lecture, chewing
on the ends of pencils, trying to make
sense of the clues.
There are all sorts of crossword
enthusiasts. There are Sunday puzzle
people and People magazine puzzle peo
ple and Philosophy CIV puzzle people.
There are puzzle cheaters, the equiva
lent of athletes who take steroids, the
people who dial the 900 help number
and spend money on crossword dictio
naries. Crosswords are a serious busi

ness to be sure, but I draw the line at
investing in them.
I got serious about doing puzzles
when I worked in an office where the
lawyers spent their time making lots of
money and the legal staff spent their
time competing for the fastest cross
word finish. But I was inspired to start
them by the brilliant and beautiful
Shirley Chisholm, the first African-
American woman to enter Congress,
whom I had the pleasure to hear speak
at my school when I was 13. Chisholm
told her audience that she started doing
puzzles to improve her vocabulary. And
because she is still the most self-pos
sessed, well-spoken human being I have
ever come across, it seemed wise to pick
up a tip or two from her.
When I was 17, I had the great for
tune to interview her and perhaps the
nicest moment of the interview was
telling her that I had started doing cross
words. And as similar as our politics
were, we derived the greatest kinship
from a mutual appreciation of the ele
gance and intelligence of puzzles.
Friendships have been formed on
stranger things, I'm sure.
I like to think that there is a group of
us, millions and millions across the Unit
ed States, even the world — The New
York Times puzzle appears in the Inter
national Herald-Tribune — each with
our pen (I cannot use pencil, although it
does present certain advantages), trying

to remember the names of birds we have
never seen and silent film stars we are
too young to remember. We have a
strange but substantial vocabulary.
I like to think if you got us all togeth
er and said, "Three-letter word for hock
ey great," we would say "Orr," and if you
said, "Four-letter word for hockey
great," we would say "Howe."
There is a lesson to be learned here,
and it's not about hockey. I am someone
who thinks that language solves prob
lems, provides answers. In a very small
way, I get to see this happen each morn
ing. I start with a basic vocabulary, one
that is not large enough to encompass all
the answers. Then letters reveal
unknown words, phrases suggest larger
sentences.
It's similar to learning a new lan
guage. It's a shared language to be sure.
The reason so many people ask for help
on the puzzle is because so many others
are conversant in "clue," know how it is
encoded. For those of us who persist in
the dream of a common language, the
crossword presents possibilities in
spaces that previously were blank.

magazine before you got on the plane.
