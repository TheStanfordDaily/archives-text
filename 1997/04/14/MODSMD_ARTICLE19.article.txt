Set of three questions is
ill-defined, nebulous; still,
topic should be debated

IT'S AN OLD question: Do Stan
ford's trustees pay adequate
attention to student and faculty
concerns in making their high-level
decisions? The three referenda pro
posed by ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson constitute an attempt to
assess the opinion of the student
body as a whole on this topic.
And certainly it's a topic that
ought to be addressed. It often
seems that the trustees operate far
removed from the campus realities
they are affecting. But these three
questions am accomplish little to
address complaints with the board's
operation in any concrete way.

The first question is amazingly
nebulous and essentially meaning
less. What student would vote no to
a referendum asking whether stu
dents and faculty should have more
input on board decisions?
The other two questions are
more substantial but are exceeding
ly ill-defined. One asks whether stu
dents should be allowed to elect a
trustee but specifies neither
whether that trustee must be a stu
dent nor with whom the list of can
didates would originate. The last
asks if students and faculty should
be permitted to serve as trustees
but never specifies how many seats
should be open to those populations
and whether the student / faculty
trustee(s) would be selected by their
peers or by the board as a whole.
It's worth seeing what students
think about these topics, but they
should realize the results of their
votes will be largely meaningless.
