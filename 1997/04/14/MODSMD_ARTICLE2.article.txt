# One last 'Howl'
## Students, faculty remember Ginsberg 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Students and faculty gathered
on the steps of Dinkelspiel Audito
rium Friday afternoon to pay trib
ute to the life and work of Beat
poet Allen Ginsberg.
In addition to reading Gins
berg's poetry, students and facul
ty members affectionately re
counted anecdotes about Gins
berg for both die-hard fans and
passers-by. Those who spoke had
shared experiences with Ginsberg
ranging from brief conversations
to long-term friendships.

1 saw the best minds
of my generation
destroyed by madness.'
— Allen Ginsberg

Ginsberg's name became syn
onymous with political action as
well as eccentricity when he began
writing poetry about the bohemian
culture of the Ixiwer East Side of
New York around the mid-19505.
With his former classmates from
Columbia University, including
Jack Kerouac and William Bur
roughs, Ginsberg led the front wave
of the Beat generation.
In more recent years, his ac
tivism was less flashy, taking the
form of fund-raising for charities
and promoting the development of
and support for new American
poets and artists in general.
Through his openness with his own
sexuality, Ginsberg promoted tol
erance of all sexual orientations.
Although his visibility peaked in
the 19605, many say the message
left behind when Ginsberg died of
liver cancer April 5 is relevant today
in this country and around the
world.
English Prof. Albert Gelpi de
scribed Ginsberg's poetry as having
a "prophetic and visionary power,
filled at the same time with amaz

ing raw humbr."
Ginsberg sold writings and me
mentos, appraised at $1.2 million,
to Stanford's special collections
three years ago. Included in the
deal were some artifacts perhaps
indicative of the poet's uncommon
nature — diaries he began when he
was 11 years old, trimmings from
his beard and a pair of sneakers he
was wearing when he was thrown
out of what was then Czechloso
vakia.
He also provided several original
manuscripts, including masters of
one of his most famous works,
"Howl." In 1955, Ginsberg first
publicly presented the poem, which
begins with the now well-known
line, "I saw the best minds of my
generation destroyed by mad
ness. ..
Often focusing on humanity's
callousness and faults, Ginsberg's
writings draw from observations he
gathered while visiting different
places in the country. He based
poems most often in New York but
in the Bay Area as well. After work
ing in a Nob Hill advertising agency
during the late 19505, Ginsberg
lived to a cottage in Berkeley area.
English Prof. Marjorie Perloff
described the poetry of this period
as sorrttj of his loneliest and most
grim works. Years later, Perloff
met Ginsberg in an upscale super
market in San Francisco and talked
to him as they wove among the
aisles. "Afler our conversation, he
turned to me [and said], 'Now don't
you tell anyone you saw me in this
kind of place,' " Perloff said, imply
ing that Ginsberg's image as a
bearded ascetic could never have
withstood the rumor.
Another speaker recalled Gins
berg with quiet nostalgia. Doctoral
student Hilton Obenzinger de
scribed meeting Ginsberg at Co
lumbia while both were working to
raise money to help children in
Palestine.
"To think if he could have been
with us another 10 years, to think
what he could have written," Oben
zinger said.
