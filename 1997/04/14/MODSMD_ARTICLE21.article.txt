The amendments on this
year's ballot, except a few,
make positive changes

LAST YEAR, A new ASSU Con
stitution was passed by the vot
ers, and it seems as though this
year's batch of senators has gotten
rather caught up in change-the-con
stitution fervor; a total of 10 amend
ments are on this week's ballot.
Amendment 1 would ameliorate
a constitutional inconsistency that
is potentially very troublesome.
Currently, the terms "general elec
tion" and "special election" are used
with different meanings. In some
places the distinction is that a gen
eral election involves all students
while a special election involves only
a certain population. In other places
"general" refers only to the annual
spring-quarter election; any other
election is "special."
This amendment would clarify
and codify the three different types
of elections: the self-explanatory
"Association Spring Quarter Gener
al Election," the campuswide "gen
eral election" and the specific-com
munity "special election." To avoid
future confusion, this measure
should be passed.
Amendment 2 would create an
official hard copy of the ASSU Con
stitution, with amendments added
sequentially to its end, although the
working version of the document
will continue to contain the changes
incorporated into its main text. For
historical reasons, if for no others,
this idea is a useful one.
Amendment 3 contains two
very useful provisions. First, it cre
ates a mechanism for senators and
the president and vice president to
bring complaints before the ASSU's
Constitutional Council. (Currently
the council may only review matters
when one of its members wants to
or when 5 percent of the student
body signs a petition requesting
that an act by examined.) Second, it
allows the senate, by a 4/5 vote, to
remove a Constitutional Council
member. (Currently a seated council
member cannot be removed.)
. However, the third change con
tained in this amendment seems
exceedingly ill considered. Why
should the council be given the
right to refuse to consider any issue

brought before by it simply if a
majority of the council's five mem
bers deem it "frivolous"? If a group
of 700 students petitions to have an
act of the senate considered, for
example, the council ought to act
on that petition out of respect for
those students' concerns. Further
more, if the council may, by majori
ty vote, choose not to consider a
matter, what has happened to each
individual council member's right
to ensure that an issue is exam
ined? This provision of the amend
ment is poorly thought-out; it
should not be passed.
Amendment 4 changes the
ASSU Constitution's open-meeting
provisions. Currently, all meetings of
the senate and its committees — as
well as meetings of other ASSU com
mittees on which at least one senator
serves — must be open to the public
with certain exceptions. One excep
tion is that a meeting may be closed if
it concerns "the appointment, the
employment, the performance, or
the dismissal of an association
employee" other than senators, the
president and the vice president.
The amendment would allow
meetings to be closed if they deal
with the status of any association
employee or association member. In
other words, meetings discussing
Constitutional Council nominees
could be closed, as could meetings
concerning Nominations Commis
sion appointments. In both the situ
ations, the nominations being dis
cussed concern the appointment of
an association member, and in both
cases the meetings should remain
open. To ensure they do, this
amendment must fail.
Amendment 5 corrects a typo
graphical error. A misspelling,
"propietary," will become "propi
etary." For the sake of copy editors
and English teachers everywhere,
this measure should be passed.
Amendment 6 will simplify the
elections process for graduate sena
tors. The current language of the
constitution prohibits a senior who
knows that he will be attending
graduate school at Stanford the
next year from running in the
spring election to represent the
graduate department he'll be
attending. Considering how few stu
dents run for graduate senate (only
four in this election, for 15 seats), it
makes little sense to keep an inter
ested albeit wet-behind-the-ears
student from running.

Amendment 7 is largely unneces
sary. When the constitution was
passed last year, it included language
that specifies how graduate senate
seats would be apportioned "unless
and until the senate reapportions dis
tricts." The senate has reappor
tioned, and accordingly that language
is now moot. Passing this amend
ment will change no policies or proce
dures, but it will help clean up the
ASSU's governing documents.
Amendment 8 changes the
ASSU Senate's definition of quorum.
Currently the Constitution requires
that half the members of the senate
plus one be present for business to
transpire. In other words, to have a
quorum with a full senate of 31
members (including the vice presi
dent), 15.5 people, rounded up to 16,
plus 1, for a total of 17, must be pre
sent. This amendment returns the
senate to the traditional notion of
quorum as simple majority. Because
the measure will also allow the sen
ate just a bit more time at its meet
ings to conduct business before quo
rum is broken, it should be passed.
Amendment 9 might be a good
idea. The theory is that by reducing
the number of senators for which
each undergraduate may vote, it will
become more difficult for people to
win simply because they have amus
ing names. Those who run good
campaigns and address serious con
cerns, the theory continues, will be
rewarded with senate seats.
But since ASSU President Bill
Shen announced this idea in his
January State of the Association
address, no one within the senate or
outside of it has given much
thought or discussion to the propos
al — least of all the senators or
Shen. Is it fair to have 15 senators
serve as at-large represents, each of
them theoretically representing all
undergraduates, when the students
could only cast votes for five candi
dates? Probably not. Let's have
some real discussion of this sub
stantive and substantial change and
then vote on it again next year. This
time, though, it should fail.
Amendment 10 attempts to clar
ify the special-fee process. Currently
a group seeking a special fee must
submit a petition signed by a certain
percentage of the total student body,
regardless of whether the fee is
sought from undergraduates only,
from graduate students only or from
both. One provision of the amend
ment would in many cases lower, in

absolute terms, the number of signa
tures a fee-seeking group must col
lect by calculating the percentage
required based upon the specific
population from which the fee would
be collected. It's a sensible move;
only those who will be funding a
group should decide if that group
deserves to be in the running.
However, the second provision of
the amendment does not make as
much sense. This language would
strip the senate of its power to dic
tate which population a special-fee

group may apply to. It does not
seem unreasonable to suppose that
groups will seek the surest route for
funding (applying to undergradu
ates only) and disregard whether all
students actually benefit from their
programs. Such a trend has begun
this year — a trend detrimental to
undergraduate wallets — and it is
the responsibility of the senate to
ensure that this does not continue.
This amendment would strip sena
tors of the power to do so, and,
accordingly, it should fail.
