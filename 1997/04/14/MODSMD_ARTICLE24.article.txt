# New system
## Students asked to approve changes to judicial charter 
### 
The proposed judicial charter would greatly
change the system that deals with alleged viola
tions of the Honor Code, Fundamental Standard
and other University student conduct policies.
Primarily, it would change the way cases in
volving alleged violations are judged. Under the
current system, most cases are settled by Dean of
Students Marc Wais. The new charter would cre
ate a six-member judicial panel, comprised of four
students and two faculty or staff members, to hear
all cases.
Panel members would be selected from student
and faculty / staff pools. Student nominees to
those pools would have to be approved by the
ASSU Senate and faculty / staff members would
need Faculty Senate approval.

Primarily, it would change the way
cases involving alleged violations
are judged.

A new Board on Judicial Affairs, a standing
committee of six students, six faculty and three
staff members, will oversee all aspects of judicial
affairs.
The charter outlines a new procedure for deal
ing with alleged violations. Under its guidelines, a
complaint must be filed within 60 days of the date
the evidence of the alleged violation was discov
ered.
The student is immediately informed, and for
the next six weeks a judicial officer — a designated
person who presents evidence to the panel — in
vestigates the facts.
During a hearing, an accused student is allowed
to "answer the charges, call witnesses on his behalf
and cross-examine those giving testimony against
him." Five of the six judicial panel members must
agree that there is proof of guilt beyond a reason
able doubt in order to return a guilty verdict.
If the panel finds the student guilty, then sanc
tions, also determined by the panel, are imposed
and the student is notified. The entire process is
designed to take about 10 weeks.
