# What are the amendments changing?
## 
### 
Amendment 1
This amendment makes the constitu
tion internally consistent. If passed, it
will clarify several things, including the
definitions of various types of elections.
It specifies three types of elections: the
Association Spring Quarter General
Election, held during the second, third
or fourth week of spring quarter; a gen
eral election, which is directed at the en
tire membership of the association; and
a special election, which is directed at a
specific community such as undergradu
ates.
Amendment 2
The amendment outlines how constitu
tional amendments should be recorded.
If passed, it specifies that the constitu
tion will consist of its original text and
letters of acceptance, appended with
amendments and associated letters of
acceptance, all numbered sequentially.
Amendment 3
This amendment allows for a member of
the five-person council to leave after re
signing, ceasing to be a member of the
association or being removed by a 4 / 5
vote of the senate. (Currently, only re
signing or ceasing to be a member of the
association removes someone from the
council.) In addition, it changes the
manner in which the council is called
into session, requiring a petition from 5
percent of the members of the associa
tion, the written request of the presi
dent or vice president or a petition

signed by 5 members of the senate. A
majority of the council, however, would
be able to choose not to hear a case.
Amendment 4
This amendment clarifies which discus
sions by the senate may be closed to the
public. It allows for closed discussion of
the appointment, employment, perfor
mance or dismissal of any association
member or employee except the presi
dent, the vice president and members of
the senate.
Amendment 5
This amendment corrects the spelling of
the word "proprietary."
Amendment 6
This amendment specifies the con
stituency membership requirements of
senators. Whereas now an elected
member of the senate must be a mem
ber of the association and the con
stituency he represents both at the
time of his election and during his time
in office, the amendment would allow
for someone to be committed to being a
member — but not yet actually a mem
ber — of the constituency he wishes to
represent at the time of the certifica
tion of his election.
Amendment 7
This amendment removes from the con
stitution discussion of districting for the
election of graduate and professional

school representatives to the senate.
The senate this year approved a redis
tricting plan, making the reference to
"unless and until the senate reappor
tions districts" outdated.
Amendment 8
This amendment changes quorum re
quirements for the senate, specifying
that quorum consists of a majority of the
regular members of the senate. Previ
ously, quorum was half the members
plus one.
Amendment 9
This amendment changes the number of
votes an undergraduate member of the
association may cast for candidates for
undergraduate senate. Students now
may cast one vote for each of as many
senate seats are assigned to undergrad
uate representatives. The amendment
would dictate that students may vote for
no more than five candidates, including
write-in candidates.
Amendment 10
This amendment changes the popula
tion from which a special-fee-seeking
group must gather signatures on a peti
tion. If passed, the group will need to
gather signatures only from the popula
tion it is targeting, such as undergradu
ates. In addition, the amendment out
lines that after a group has delineated a
population from which to request a fee,
the senate does not have the power to
alter that choice.
