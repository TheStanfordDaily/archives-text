## Blowouts Netters win big 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
With one weekend of dual
match play left before the NCAA
Championships next month, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team, winner of 13 straight
matches, is really putting it
together.
The Cardinal (24-1, 8-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference South Division)
disposed of two prominent pro
grams this weekend with ease,
sending No. 8 Arizona State and
No. 14 Arizona packing with lop
sided defeats of 8-1 and 9-0,
respectively.
"These were our best two
matches of the year," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"We had consistent perfor
mances all the way through. We
are really hitting on all of our
cylinders."
Freshman Lilia Osterloh
headlined the weekend's activi
ties with two straight-set wins
over members of last season's
All-Pac-10 squad. Saturday
against Arizona State, Osterloh
took care of the 18th-ranked
player in the country, Sun Devil
Reka Cseresnyes 6-3, 6-4. The
previous day against the Wild
cats, Osterloh upset the third
ranked player in the nation,
junior Vicky Maes, 6-2, 6-4.
"She is one tough cookie,"
Brennan said. "She is really
determined, and she has the
game to back it up. Her oppo
nents are not losing to her; she is
beating them. When she makes
her mind up, she just reels off
three games. She has another
gear which allows her to pick it
up just a little bit more. She is a
great front-runner."
Against Arizona State, the
rest of the Cardinal was even
quicker off the court than Oster
loh, as freshman Anne Kremer
rolled over Stephanie Lansdorp
in the No. 2 match 6-4, 6-4.
Similarly, at No. 3 singles,
senior Katie Schlukebir bounced
back from a disappointing loss at
Cal by creaming Katy Propstra 6-
3, 6-1. In the No. 4 match, senior
Sandra De Silva had little trouble
with Alison Nash, cruising 6-4, 6-
1. It was the final regular-season
dual match at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium for both seniors.
Cardinal junior co-captain
Julie Scott rebounded from her
only singles loss of the dual
match season last week as she
took down Anna Moll 6-4, 6-3.
The Sun Devils (15-4, 6-3)
earned their only point of the
afternoon at the No. 5 singles
spot as Kerry Giardino, now 14-2
in dual-match play, upset Cardi
