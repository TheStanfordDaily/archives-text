## Blowouts Netters win big 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
With one weekend of dual
match play left before the NCAA
Championships next month, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team, winner of 13 straight
matches, is really putting it
together.
The Cardinal (24-1, 8-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference South Division)
disposed of two prominent pro
grams this weekend with ease,
sending No. 8 Arizona State and
No. 14 Arizona packing with lop
sided defeats of 8-1 and 9-0,
respectively.
"These were our best two
matches of the year," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"We had consistent perfor
mances all the way through. We
are really hitting on all of our
cylinders."
Freshman Lilia Osterloh
headlined the weekend's activi
ties with two straight-set wins
over members of last season's
All-Pac-10 squad. Saturday
against Arizona State, Osterloh
took care of the 18th-ranked
player in the country, Sun Devil
Reka Cseresnyes 6-3, 6-4. The
previous day against the Wild
cats, Osterloh upset the third
ranked player in the nation,
junior Vicky Maes, 6-2, 6-4.
"She is one tough cookie,"
Brennan said. "She is really
determined, and she has the
game to back it up. Her oppo
nents are not losing to her; she is
beating them. When she makes
her mind up, she just reels off
three games. She has another
gear which allows her to pick it
up just a little bit more. She is a
great front-runner."
Against Arizona State, the
rest of the Cardinal was even
quicker off the court than Oster
loh, as freshman Anne Kremer
rolled over Stephanie Lansdorp
in the No. 2 match 6-4, 6-4.
Similarly, at No. 3 singles,
senior Katie Schlukebir bounced
back from a disappointing loss at
Cal by creaming Katy Propstra 6-
3, 6-1. In the No. 4 match, senior
Sandra De Silva had little trouble
with Alison Nash, cruising 6-4, 6-
1. It was the final regular-season
dual match at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium for both seniors.
Cardinal junior co-captain
Julie Scott rebounded from her
only singles loss of the dual
match season last week as she
took down Anna Moll 6-4, 6-3.
The Sun Devils (15-4, 6-3)
earned their only point of the
afternoon at the No. 5 singles
spot as Kerry Giardino, now 14-2
in dual-match play, upset Cardi
nal junior Ania Bleszynski in
straight sets 6-2, 6-2.
Osterloh's win clinched the
victory for Stanford, however,
before the Sun Devils ever got on
the scoreboard.
"That's what we were hoping
for this weekend," Brennan said.
"Our goal was to get on track and
start dominating, i.e., winning in
singles. So if someone has a bad
day, fine. But never two people.
That makes a statement that we
can send to [No. 1 Florida in| the
Southeast."
Doubles spelled more trouble
for the Sun Devils, who have
dropped two of their four losses
this season to the Cardinal. Kre
mer and freshman Teryn Ashley,
playing up at No. 2 doubles for
the day, jumped all over Moll and
Nash in a 8-0 whitewash.
"They are playing very well
right now," Brennan said. "They
had that one bad loss to USC and
since then they have really gotten
it together. You sometimes need
a bad match like that to clear the
air."
Osterloh and Schlukebir con
tinued to click as a tandem, tak
ing No. 18 Lansdorp and Prop
stra 8-2.
"They have really established
themselves as a solid No. 1 dou
bles team," Brennan said. "They
beat USC and UCLA 16-0 last
weekend."
Scott and another graduating
senior Emily Burt teamed up in
the No. 3 doubles match to defeat
Cseresnyes and Giardino 8-3.

Against the Wildcats, it was
much of the same, straight-set
singles wins and doubles sweeps.
In addition to Osterloh's win,
Kremer, Schlukebir, De Silva and
Scott all rolled in straight sets.
Bleszynski just missed a straight
set win when Wildcat Betsy
Miringoff earned a split with a
tie-breaker win in the second set.
Bleszynski went on to win 6-4, 6-
7, 7-5.
In doubles, Kremer and Ash
ley cruised again 8-1. Schlukebir
and Osterloh did not take long
either, defeating Maes and Khris
ten Pietruoha 8-3. Bleszynski and
Scott completed the shutout with
a 8-5 victory of their own.

That's what we were
hoping for this week
end. Our goal was to
get on track and start
dominating, i.e.
winning in singles.'

The two wins extended the
Cardinal's conference winning
streak to 32 matches, dating back
to the 1994 season. The Cardinal
hits the road this week with
matches against No. 3 UCLA and
USC, both of whom Stanford
beat two weeks ago at home.
With two more wins, the Cardi
nal can secure its 10th consecu
tive league title and third
straight undefeated Pac-10 sea
son.
