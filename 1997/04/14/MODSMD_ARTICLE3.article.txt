# Measure seeks student voice
## Students asked in election whether they want Board of Trustees seat 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
A referendum that asks the
Board of Trustees to give students
more of a voice in its decisions will
be included on the ballot during
the upcoming ASSU Spring Gen
eral Election.
The referendum, proposed by
ASSU President Bill Shen and
Vice President Nick Thompson,
includes these three questions:
• Should students and faculty
have more input on decisions
made by the Board of Trustees?
• Should students be able to
elect at least one voting member to
the full Board of Trustees, with
full trustee privileges?
• Should students and faculty
have voting privileges on the full
Board of Trustees?
According to Thompson, mak
ing people think about this issue is
even more important than how
people vote. The goal of the refer
endum, he said, is to raise student
awareness about the relationship
between the board and the stu
dents.
"I don't think the current rela
tionship between students and the
Board of Trustees is satisfactory
at all," Thompson said. "It's sort
of like the Wizard of Oz. We have
no idea who is pulling the strings
or how. I want students to think
about this issue."
The debate began 30 years ago,
when then-ASSU President David
Harris urged the University to
abolish the Board of Trustees.
"That campaign went no
where, but this is a critical issue,"

Harris said during a visit to cam
pus last week.
Currently, students have no
input in the board member selec
tion process. Student representa
tives who serve on each of the
seven standing committees of the
board can raise attention to is
sues within the confines of the
committee but do not have any
voting power in the full board
meetings.
The group of students spear
heading the referendum, believe
that the board needs more ac
countability in the tasks that they
undertake.
The 35 trustees administer the
invested fund, set the annual bud
get and determine policies for op
eration and control of the Univer
sity.
Several trustees expressed
their hesitation about the referen
dum.
Trustee Isaac Stein said the job
of' a board member requires a
"long-term perspective with the
long-term health of the institution
in mind." Students, in his opinion,
see issues through the eyes of
someone passing through, as they
often have only a few years at
Stanford.
John Freidenrich, former chair
of the hoard, said input is always
welcomed from all, but he would
not comment on concrete ways to
include more student input.
Although the outcome of the
referendum will not have any im
mediate results, it will give the
newly elected ASSU president and
