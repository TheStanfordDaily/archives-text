# Baseball drops series
## Arizona State comes up with big hits

The coach said it could happen to anyone.
It did.
The No. 16 Arizona State (27-16, 12-12
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division) base
ball team swept the No. 2 Cardinal (27-11, 13-
5 Six-Pac) this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
While commenting on the strength of the
conference prior to this series, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess explained that it was
possible for any team to beat another in the
Six-Pac.
"That is just what makes the league so
exciting," Marquess said before the series.
Exciting? Heartbreaking? Frustrating?
"Disappointing," said freshman John Gall.
Entering the series against the Sun Devils,

the Cardinal was on fire, having won 17 of its
last 19 games. With 4-3, 16-5 and 5-3, losses,
the Card ends the weekend in a much differ
ent position than it started. All of a sudden,
the Six-Pac race is again close, and Stanford's
3 1/2-game lead is down to one over next
week's opponent, UCI.A.
With a combination of shaky defense,
inconsistent pitching and poor offense, no
team can win. It is difficult to win if, in three
games, the defense has 10 errors and the
offense scores only 11 runs, as Stanford did. It
is nearly impossible to win if a starter walks
six batters, hits one and has three wild pitches
in 2 2/3 innings, as Stanford learned Saturday.
However, the real difference in the series
was the heartbreaking ninth inning in Friday
