# Baseball drops series
## Arizona State comes up with big hits 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
The coach said it could happen to anyone.
It did.
The No. 16 Arizona State (27-16, 12-12
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division) base
ball team swept the No. 2 Cardinal (27-11, 13-
5 Six-Pac) this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
While commenting on the strength of the
conference prior to this series, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess explained that it was
possible for any team to beat another in the
Six-Pac.
"That is just what makes the league so
exciting," Marquess said before the series.
Exciting? Heartbreaking? Frustrating?
"Disappointing," said freshman John Gall.
Entering the series against the Sun Devils,

the Cardinal was on fire, having won 17 of its
last 19 games. With 4-3, 16-5 and 5-3, losses,
the Card ends the weekend in a much differ
ent position than it started. All of a sudden,
the Six-Pac race is again close, and Stanford's
3 1/2-game lead is down to one over next
week's opponent, UCI.A.
With a combination of shaky defense,
inconsistent pitching and poor offense, no
team can win. It is difficult to win if, in three
games, the defense has 10 errors and the
offense scores only 11 runs, as Stanford did. It
is nearly impossible to win if a starter walks
six batters, hits one and has three wild pitches
in 2 2/3 innings, as Stanford learned Saturday.
However, the real difference in the series
was the heartbreaking ninth inning in Friday

night's series opener. The Sun Dev
ils overcame a 2-0 deficit, scoring
fouf unearned runs in the tbp of
the-ninth inning. Going into the
ninth inning, junior starting pitch
er Kyle Peterson (6-2) was throw
ing a dandy. Allowing only three
hits over the first eight innings,
Peterson kept the Card in a game
in which Stanford's offense had
trouble simply getting started.
An RBI single by sophomore
third baseman Josh Hochgesang in
the first inning and another by Gall
in the fourth provided the majority
of Stanford's offense.
A walk, a two-base error by
junior second baseman Joe Kilburg
on a potential game-ending, dou
ble-play grounder, a sacrifice, a sin
gle and a misplayed ball gave Ari
zona State a 4-2 lead.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer's
ninth home run in the bottom of
the ninth wasn't enough for the
Card to stage a comeback, and the
game ended with the Sun Devils
and Ryan Bradley (6-5) on top 4-3.

Stanford was never able to
recover.
"We were flat on Saturday after
Friday's disappointing loss," Gall
said. "We let that loss get to us."
On Saturday, Arizona State
used 16 hits, nine walks and three
to jcrbfch the Cardinal 16-5.
After three innings, the Card was
already down 10-0 and was never
able to recover.
Sophomore starter Chad
Hutchinson (3-2) suffered the loss,
going only 2 2/3 innings in his
shortest appearance of the year.
Arizona State second baseman
Richy Leon had five RBIs on three
hits, including a double and his sec
ond home run. Third baseman
Andrew Beinbrink also added four
RBIs for the Sun Devils.
Gall was the only Cardinal play
er with more than one hit, con
tributing three in the losing effort.
"We had no offensive firepow
er," Gall said.
Trying to salvage at least one
win in the three-game series, Stan
ford sent sophomore Brent Hoard
(7-2) to the mound for his fourth
start in the weekend pitching rota
tion. Hoard was 3-0 on Sundays
prior to facing Arizona State.

Hoard went six innings allowing
only two earned runs but didn't
receive much support from his
team and suffered the loss.
The 5-3 setback was again evi
dence of the Card's struggling
offense. Unable to handle the Sun
Devils' power pitching all weekend,
Stanford managed 12 hits Sunday
but just one with men in scoring
position, leaving 10 runners on
base and grounding into three dou
ble plays.
The Card jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the third inning but was
silenced the rest of the way. In the
third, freshman right fielder
Edmund Muth drilled a two-run
homer. Sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut followed with a double
and scored on senior Luke
Quaccia's single up the middle.
Arizona State battled back with
runs in the fourth, sixth, seventh
and eighth innings, and Stanford
was shut out the rest of the game.
Kilburg, Muth, Gerut, Hochgesang
and senior left fielder Chris Clark
all had two hits, but the Card
couldn't piece its hits together.
Hochgesang extended his career
long hitting streak to 18 games.
As well as not producing offen

sively, Stanford played uncharac
teristically poor defense. Only 16 of
the 25 runs the Sun Devils scored
all weekend were earned.
The errors "worry me. The
thing we had been doing up until
this weekend was playing good
solid defense," Marquess said on
KZ9U.

The coach said it could happen to anyone.
It did.
The No. 16 Arizona State (27-16, 12-12
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division) base
ball team swept the No. 2 Cardinal (27-11, 13-
5 Six-Pac) this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
While commenting on the strength of the
conference prior to this series, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess explained that it was
possible for any team to beat another in the
Six-Pac.
"That is just what makes the league so
exciting," Marquess said before the series.
Exciting? Heartbreaking? Frustrating?
"Disappointing," said freshman John Gall.
Entering the series against the Sun Devils,

the Cardinal was on fire, having won 17 of its
last 19 games. With 4-3, 16-5 and 5-3, losses,
the Card ends the weekend in a much differ
ent position than it started. All of a sudden,
the Six-Pac race is again close, and Stanford's
3 1/2-game lead is down to one over next
week's opponent, UCI.A.
With a combination of shaky defense,
inconsistent pitching and poor offense, no
team can win. It is difficult to win if, in three
games, the defense has 10 errors and the
offense scores only 11 runs, as Stanford did. It
is nearly impossible to win if a starter walks
six batters, hits one and has three wild pitches
in 2 2/3 innings, as Stanford learned Saturday.
However, the real difference in the series
was the heartbreaking ninth inning in Friday


Garth Patil — Daily
Junior shortstop Jay Pecci tries to halt Arizona State's Mikel Moreno as he attempts
to steal second in the third inning of Saturday's 16-5 loss. Moreno was safe.
night's series opener. The Sun Dev
ils overcame a 2-0 deficit, scoring
fouf unearned runs in the tbp of
the-ninth inning. Going into the
ninth inning, junior starting pitch
er Kyle Peterson (6-2) was throw
ing a dandy. Allowing only three
hits over the first eight innings,
Peterson kept the Card in a game
in which Stanford's offense had
trouble simply getting started.
An RBI single by sophomore
third baseman Josh Hochgesang in
the first inning and another by Gall
in the fourth provided the majority
of Stanford's offense.
A walk, a two-base error by
junior second baseman Joe Kilburg
on a potential game-ending, dou
ble-play grounder, a sacrifice, a sin
gle and a misplayed ball gave Ari
zona State a 4-2 lead.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer's
ninth home run in the bottom of
the ninth wasn't enough for the
Card to stage a comeback, and the
game ended with the Sun Devils
and Ryan Bradley (6-5) on top 4-3.

Stanford was never able to
recover.
"We were flat on Saturday after
Friday's disappointing loss," Gall
said. "We let that loss get to us."
On Saturday, Arizona State
used 16 hits, nine walks and three
to jcrbfch the Cardinal 16-5.
After three innings, the Card was
already down 10-0 and was never
able to recover.
Sophomore starter Chad
Hutchinson (3-2) suffered the loss,
going only 2 2/3 innings in his
shortest appearance of the year.
Arizona State second baseman
Richy Leon had five RBIs on three
hits, including a double and his sec
ond home run. Third baseman
Andrew Beinbrink also added four
RBIs for the Sun Devils.
Gall was the only Cardinal play
er with more than one hit, con
tributing three in the losing effort.
"We had no offensive firepow
er," Gall said.
Trying to salvage at least one
win in the three-game series, Stan
ford sent sophomore Brent Hoard
(7-2) to the mound for his fourth
start in the weekend pitching rota
tion. Hoard was 3-0 on Sundays
prior to facing Arizona State.

Hoard went six innings allowing
only two earned runs but didn't
receive much support from his
team and suffered the loss.
The 5-3 setback was again evi
dence of the Card's struggling
offense. Unable to handle the Sun
Devils' power pitching all weekend,
Stanford managed 12 hits Sunday
but just one with men in scoring
position, leaving 10 runners on
base and grounding into three dou
ble plays.
The Card jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the third inning but was
silenced the rest of the way. In the
third, freshman right fielder
Edmund Muth drilled a two-run
homer. Sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut followed with a double
and scored on senior Luke
Quaccia's single up the middle.
Arizona State battled back with
runs in the fourth, sixth, seventh
and eighth innings, and Stanford
was shut out the rest of the game.
Kilburg, Muth, Gerut, Hochgesang
and senior left fielder Chris Clark
all had two hits, but the Card
couldn't piece its hits together.
Hochgesang extended his career
long hitting streak to 18 games.
As well as not producing offen

sively, Stanford played uncharac
teristically poor defense. Only 16 of
the 25 runs the Sun Devils scored
all weekend were earned.
The errors "worry me. The
thing we had been doing up until
this weekend was playing good
solid defense," Marquess said on
KZ9U.
