# Golf places second at home

### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
The beautiful weekend
weather and home-course
advantage wasn't enough for
the Stanford women's golf
team to win the Peg Barnard
California Collegiate.
The team led the tourna
ment on the first day by six
strokes but then fell 21 strokes
behind San Jose State in the
second and final round yester
day.
The Cardinal finished sec
ond behind the Spartans at the
weekend tournament held at
the 6,150-yard, par-73 Stanford
Golf Course.
Despite shooting a lackluster
second round, the Cardinal
players all finished in the top
25, with seniors Mhairi McKay
and Andrea Baxter leading with
second- and eighth-place finish
es, respectively.
San Jose State's Janice
Moodie, currently the nation's
second-ranked player behind
1996 national champion Marisa
Baena of Arizona, won the
weekend tournament with a 10-
under-par performance (70-66
- 136).
Cardinal co-captain McKay
posted seven birdies in a round
of 68, leading the tournament
on the first day. McKay dis
played an impressive first
round, shooting five consecu
tive birdies on the back nine for
a 5-under-par finish that day.
The turning point for
McKay's bogey-free back nine
came on the par-5 12th hole,
which features a huge oak tree
in the middle of the fairway.
She ripped the ball long onto
the middle of the fairway, shot
the ball over the hundred-year
old oak tree with a 3-wood and
chipped the ball 20 feet onto
the green for a 2-foot putt.

Freshman Jae Jean Ro drives the ball down the green at the
Stanford Golf Course during first-round action Saturday.
"I didn't try to think about all
the visual stuff," McKay said. "I
just tried to feel the shot more
when I swung."
However on Sunday, she fell
six strokes behind with 142 to
finish second behind Moodie.
"I was a little nervous at first
so I didn't swing as well on the
front nine," McKay said.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro, who
tied for 12th with 152, per
formed an impressive first
round, going 1 under par. After a
double bogey on the par-3 third,
she turned her game around
with five birdies.
"I was thinking too mechani
cally about my swing, so I let go
of the bad holes and started
playing aggressively," Ro said.
"Plus, having my parents there
to watch me play was good moral
support."
Baxter's parents flew in from
Idaho to watch her birdie two
par-3s.
On the second day, Baxter
was four strokes behind her
first-round showing, making
four bogeys for a round of 77
that put her at 150 for the tour
nament.
Other Cardinal players also
experienced some difficulty. The
ball wouldn't stick on the undu
lating greens for freshman Julie
Dunn. On the first round, Dunn
had a good drive on the 13th but
struggled to make the ball stick
as it rolled onto the apron and
then rolled too short for a double
bogey. Dunn finished 22nd after

shooting 78 on the first round
and one stroke better on the sec
ond.
Sophomore Michelle Sperry
also shot 155, with 77 in her first
round and 78 on the second.
While the team collectively
shot low numbers on the first
day, the second round was a
downer.
Head coach Caroline O'Con
nor said the team was on an
emotional high at the end of the
first round with the return of
teammate Baxter, who had been
out with a broken wrist. But
instead of remaining focused
and patient during the second
round, confidence ran low,
drives sailed wayward and balls
went bunker.
Players said that while they
were proud of their overall per
formance, they felt they put too
much pressure on themselves
during the second round.
Except for Dunn, each of the
scoring players shot significant
ly higher numbers on the second
day.
"I was thinking too much of
yesterday's round and not on the
[day's] round," said Ro, who
shot eight strokes behind her
first round of 72. "Instead of
taking one shot at a time, I'd
think about making birdie on
the hole."
Ro said she overshot a few 5-
and 6-foot putts and her
approach shots strayed from the
fairway.
With the start of the three
day Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships a week away, the team
will work on both short game
and course play to prepare for
the tournament.
