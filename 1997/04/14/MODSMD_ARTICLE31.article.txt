# Golf places second at home

The beautiful weekend
weather and home-course
advantage wasn't enough for
the Stanford women's golf
team to win the Peg Barnard
California Collegiate.
The team led the tourna
ment on the first day by six
strokes but then fell 21 strokes
behind San Jose State in the
second and final round yester
day.
The Cardinal finished sec
ond behind the Spartans at the
weekend tournament held at
the 6,150-yard, par-73 Stanford
Golf Course.
Despite shooting a lackluster
second round, the Cardinal
players all finished in the top
25, with seniors Mhairi McKay
and Andrea Baxter leading with
second- and eighth-place finish
es, respectively.
San Jose State's Janice
Moodie, currently the nation's
second-ranked player behind
1996 national champion Marisa
Baena of Arizona, won the
weekend tournament with a 10-
under-par performance (70-66
- 136).
Cardinal co-captain McKay
posted seven birdies in a round
of 68, leading the tournament
on the first day. McKay dis
played an impressive first
round, shooting five consecu
tive birdies on the back nine for
a 5-under-par finish that day.
The turning point for
McKay's bogey-free back nine
came on the par-5 12th hole,
which features a huge oak tree
in the middle of the fairway.
She ripped the ball long onto
the middle of the fairway, shot
the ball over the hundred-year
old oak tree with a 3-wood and
chipped the ball 20 feet onto
the green for a 2-foot putt.
