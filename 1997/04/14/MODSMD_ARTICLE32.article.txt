## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team fin
ished up its regular season home schedule
Friday and Saturday. The No. 4 Cardinal
('2l-3, 14-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), sporting an undefeated home record
going into the weekend's play, came away
from the two matches with the record still
unblemished and a lot of positive momen
tum.

"Over the last four or five matches of the
season, it is important to keep playing well,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves. "We need to
be sure that we have a lot of momentum
going into the first round of the tournament.
If you come into the tournament playing
poorly, without momentum, it is a lot harder
to get back playing well enough to win the
three games it takes to win the tournament."
If Stanford's goal for the weekend's
matches was to build momentum
going into the season's end, then
its match against San Diego State

Friday night was a strong step in
this process.
Stanford cruised to an easy
15-5, 15-8, 15-10 victory against
the hapless Aztecs. The outcome
of the match was never in doubt
as the Card played well for the
most part against the vastly

overmatched Aztecs (5-21, 1-16).
After defeating the Aztecs, the
Cardinal continued its attack on
the San Diego schools in an after
noon match, unusual for games at
Burnham, against UC-San Diego.
The Tritons were not able to offer
any form of stiff resistance to Stan
ford. The Cardinal attackers had
their way with the UC-San Diego
defense, propelling Stanford to a
dominating victory. Stanford,
which had beaten the Tritons (5-
19, 2-15 MPSF) in its first league
match of the season, defeated
them for the second time in three
games 15-7, 15-2, 15-10.
While Stanford has had differ
ent stars all year, the victory was
sparked by the play of four Cardi
nal seniors, three of whom are reg
ular stars and the fourth who was
able to showcase his stuff in one of
his last home matches.
Senior outside hitters Mike
Lambert and Matt Fuerbringer
put in the type of outstanding
showings to which fans have
become accustomed. Lambert
totaled 12 kills, hit .588 and set the
tone defensively for the Card, col
lecting 10 digs. But if
numbers were good, Fuerbringer's
were untouchable.
The senior recorded 13 kills
while hitting a perfect 1.000 for
the match. Along with Lambert
and Fuerbringer, senior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer led Stanford
to victory. One of the Cardinal's
mainstays in the middle all year
long, Hoefer led the team with 16
kills while hitting .485 and record
ing six blocks.
Although the play of Lambert,
Fuerbringer and Hoefer was out
standing, fans of Stanford volley
ball have become somewhat accus
tomed to performances of this sort
from these three. As a result, the
night really belonged to senior out
side hitter Aaron Garcia. Garcia,
playing in place of freshman out
side hitter Andy Witt, compiled 12
kills, hit .417 and led the Stanford
attack with three aces.
Stanford has Pacific as its sole
remaining regular-season oppo
nent in Stockton tomorrow before
it begins play as the second seed in
the opening round of the MPSF
tournament Saturday at home.
