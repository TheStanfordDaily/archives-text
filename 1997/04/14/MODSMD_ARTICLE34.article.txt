# Softball gets swept at Strawberry Field
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford Softball was unable
to get past No. 21 California on
Saturday, falling 10-2 and 8-7 in
a doubleheader at Berkeley's
Strawberry Field.
Although Stanford (19-19-1,
5-11 Pacific 10 Conference) is
comparable in size and talent to
the Cal squad, the team was
weakened by a early run by
Golden Hears in the first, game
and a strong third inning for the
Bears in the second.
The Pac-10 is packed wit h tal
ent, and the Card needs to come
away with at least a split against
teams like Cal (25-18, 8-8) to
earn a regional bid to the NCAA
tournament.
Game one was a one-sided
performance dominated by Cal.
The Bears scored three times in
each of the first three innings to
take a comfortable 9-0 lead. The
early lead was surprising, con
sidering that opposing teams
have rarely been able to light up
Stanford's pitching.
"Cal came out really swing
ing," said freshman catcher Kel
lie Wiginton. " They really hit the
ball hard and well."
Combined with a tough pitch
ing performance by sophomore
Marcy Crouch, the Card's hit
ting didn't come up as well as
Cal's did.
"Cal had the same pitcher in
both games, and we just didn't
make the adjustments on her
until the second game," Wigin
ton said. "And by then, it was
too late."
One of the few exceptions
came in the fourth inning when
Stanford scored its two runs of
the game off Molly Yost on a
home run by sophomore short
stop Michelle Schneider.
"We're not a home run-hitting
team so it was really exciting to

see two home runs hit this
weekend," said sophomore out
fielder Dawn Kobata. "Softball
is more pitcher-dominated than
baseball anyways, so it is a little
more surprising to see a home
run."
The other Stanford homer
came from sophomore outfielder
Michelle Acosta in game two.
In the second game Cal took
an early 1-0 lead. The top of the
third saw Stanford respond by
scoring three runs, temporarily
giving the squad a 3-1 lead.
Cal answered back, as it did
throughout both games, scoring
five runs in the bottom of the
third inning.
Acosta's home run came in
the top of the sixth inning and
ignited a three-run rally by the
Cardinal. With the game tied,
Cal scored two in the bottom of
(lie sixth and was able to main
tain the lead despite a Stanford
run in the seventh to record the
victory.
Stanford plays Wednesday at
San .Jose State. The players will
have a chance to warm up their
bats before traveling to Wash
ington to play the fifth-ranked
Huskies Sunday.
