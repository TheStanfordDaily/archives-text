# Final Four bound
## Women's rugby wins at regionals 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
With two commanding victories Saturday in the
Pacific Region playoffs, the women's rugby team
clinched its first-ever berth in the Final Four next
month at Penn State.
The Cardinal easily rolled past both Western
Washington and Reed College in the three-team
round-robin tournament at Maloney Field, negating
the need for the matchup between the other two
teams yesterday.
"I think this is a very well-deserved qualification,"
said head coach Franck Boivert. "They worked very
hard for this. This was a victory of the heart. [The
team was strong] with their support, keeping the ball
alive. They also had plenty of aggressiveness on
defense."
In their morning game against Western Washing
ton, the women, ranked third in the Pacific Region,
dismantled the top-seeded Vikings 54-7. Junior Suzie
Hoffman led the women with for tries and two con
verted kicks for 26 points. Freshman Karina Celaya,
seniors Claire Dacey and Megan Himan and sopho
mores .Judy Mahtaban and Bronwen Trice each
added another try in the rout.
The women breezed past Western Washington
with quick, efficient passing. The Vikings could not
keep up with the Cardinal's fast pace strategy.
The team also completed the job at the other end
of the field, stifling the Vikings whenever they
touched the ball.
The evening match against Reed was more of the
same. Himan opened the scoring five minutes into
the game with a short run. Thinking quickly, she
brought the dead ball into play before Reed could
gather themselves to defend the goal line.
