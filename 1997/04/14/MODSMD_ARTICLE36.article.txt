The Stanford track and field team continued
its brilliance with impressive individual perfor
mances in Berkeley over the weekend. Team
totals were not too shabby, either.
"We accomplished everything that we wanted
to accomplish," said head coach Vin Lananna.
The women's team ended up tied for first
with host California at the Pierce Golden Bear
with 135 points. The men's team finished fifth
with 50 points out of the 13-team field.
"I was very impressed," Lananna said. "I
wasn't even keeping track of totals during the
meet."
Junior Justin Strand showed off his strength,
pounding out a toss of 133 feet, 5 inches in the
hammer. The throw was long enough for Strand
to win the event as well as qualify for NCAA
Championships, surpassing the standard by 12
feet. This also was the longest throw in the
nation this season.
Junior Ryan McCalmon tallied another first
place finish for the Card by winning the 3,000-
meter steeplechase with a time of 9 minutes,
15.37 seconds â€” a personal best. Although he
was not scored for the event, senior Jose Fiero,
finished with a time of 9:24.37, good for fourth
place. Sophomore Jake Maas also raced to fourth
place in the 1,500 meters with a time of 3:52.99.
Freshman Toby Stevenson jumped 17-4 1/2,
which landed him a third-place finish in the pole
vault. Senior Brian Manning also was third in
the triple jump, leaping 48-1 1/4.
On the women's side, freshman Julie Tinker
ran 12.68 in the 100 meters, finishing fourth.
Junior Bernadette Armand and sophomore
LaShawndra Pace had second-place finishes in

the 100-meter hurdles and the 800 meters,
respectively. Sophomore Tracye Lawyer also had
a successful day, finishing third in the 100-
meter hurdles after crossing the line in 14.55
seconds.
The women's 4 x 400-meter relay team had a
good showing as well. The group finished third
with a time of 3:48.72.
The women put on a strong show in the 1,500
meters. Junior Sara Moore, although not scored,
finished ahead of the Stanford pack earning a
third-place spot with a time of 4:23.32. Only two
runners can be scored per event, and who they
will be is decided on before the race.
"Sometimes non-scored runners will just
beast-out and do really well," said sophomore
Mary Cobb, who finished just behind Moore with
a time of 4:23.39. Junior Monal Chokshi finished
fifth at 4:23.44. The times were quick enough for
all three to qualify provisionally for NCAAs.
Stanford women's throwers and jumpers
enjoyed a good day as well. Freshman Allison
Beatty and sophomore Tara Oettinger came
away with second place in the javelin and triple
jump, respectively. Beatty's toss of 149-5 quali
fied her for Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, and Oettinger jumped 38-3 1/2.
Junior Rhonda Witmer finished third with a
leap of 37-2 1/2 in the triple jump. Freshman
Summer Pierson hurled the discus 166-4, giving
her second place and provisionally qualifying
her for NCAAs as well.
It was all in all a successful weekend for the
hot track and field squad, who are, as the saying
goes, en fucgo.
"When it comes down to getting things done,
we have the team to get them done," Lananna
said.
