## Administrators reach out by teaching 
### Essan Ni Contributing writer 
To most students, Stanford
administrators may very well
dwell on Mt. Olympus. Once in
a while, some do descend to
teach the mortal students.
These teachers include
President Gerhard Casper,
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds. Aside
from getting divine education,

past student disciples experienced a revelation
that administrators are also approachable, nor
mal human beings.
This quarter, Edmonds lectures in Hum Bio
105, "Ethnogerontology." The course covers so
ciocultural aspects of aging in the African-
American, Asian-American and Chicano popu
lations, such as health, treatment and spiritual
ity-
Edmonds is a physical therapist, medical so
ciologist and social gerontologist with experi

ence teaching, researching and practicing. After
what she termed a "Ph.D. in the real world" and
a switch from academia to administration, Ed
monds is now teaching her first Stanford class.
"The ability to participate in the intellectual
life in an academic setting is gratifying," Ed
monds said. "You know that intellectually,

you're making a difference."
Edmonds said she wanted
to debunk stereotypes oft bo el
derly through this course, and
her personal goal is to have stu
dents respect them and their
rich oral histories.
She added that she would
also like to dispel myths about
administrators who have "is
sues and concerns, their own
dreams and passions."

"But I don't think students treat me differ
ently than a 'regular' pro I because when 1 go
into the classroom, I'm a faculty member and
what counts is what I can deliver," Edmonds
said.
In her delivery, Edmonds uses "an interac-

tive teaching style" as well as
different media. It is important
to her that students under
stand and that a reciprocal
feedback exists, she said.
"By teaching, you don't lose
touch with the academic enter
prise," Edmonds said. She
added that she wanted to teach
more in the future.
Casper and Rice also juggle

administrating along with teaching. (Jasper was
a professor of constitutional law at the Univer
sity of Chicago, and Rice has boon a Stanford po
litical science professor since I9HI In sopho
more college session taught, last summer,
Casper's seminar was "Constitutionalism" and
Rice's "The Fall of Communism and the New
World ()rder."
"It was the greatest teaching experience I've
ever had," Casper said. "And I've boon teaching
since 15)04, so that's saying a lot."
It wasa great experience for students as well.
