# Gerhard Casper grading you?
## Administrators reach out by teaching 
### Essan Ni Contributing writer 
To most students, Stanford
administrators may very well
dwell on Mt. Olympus. Once in
a while, some do descend to
teach the mortal students.
These teachers include
President Gerhard Casper,
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds. Aside
from getting divine education,

past student disciples experienced a revelation
that administrators are also approachable, nor
mal human beings.
This quarter, Edmonds lectures in Hum Bio
105, "Ethnogerontology." The course covers so
ciocultural aspects of aging in the African-
American, Asian-American and Chicano popu
lations, such as health, treatment and spiritual
ity-
Edmonds is a physical therapist, medical so
ciologist and social gerontologist with experi

ence teaching, researching and practicing. After
what she termed a "Ph.D. in the real world" and
a switch from academia to administration, Ed
monds is now teaching her first Stanford class.
"The ability to participate in the intellectual
life in an academic setting is gratifying," Ed
monds said. "You know that intellectually,

you're making a difference."
Edmonds said she wanted
to debunk stereotypes oft bo el
derly through this course, and
her personal goal is to have stu
dents respect them and their
rich oral histories.
She added that she would
also like to dispel myths about
administrators who have "is
sues and concerns, their own
dreams and passions."

"But I don't think students treat me differ
ently than a 'regular' pro I because when 1 go
into the classroom, I'm a faculty member and
what counts is what I can deliver," Edmonds
said.
In her delivery, Edmonds uses "an interac-

tive teaching style" as well as
different media. It is important
to her that students under
stand and that a reciprocal
feedback exists, she said.
"By teaching, you don't lose
touch with the academic enter
prise," Edmonds said. She
added that she wanted to teach
more in the future.
Casper and Rice also juggle

administrating along with teaching. (Jasper was
a professor of constitutional law at the Univer
sity of Chicago, and Rice has boon a Stanford po
litical science professor since I9HI In sopho
more college session taught, last summer,
Casper's seminar was "Constitutionalism" and
Rice's "The Fall of Communism and the New
World ()rder."
"It was the greatest teaching experience I've
ever had," Casper said. "And I've boon teaching
since 15)04, so that's saying a lot."
It wasa great experience for students as well.

"Every morning we walked to
the Hoover House, sat at his huge
meeting table, and he gave us juice,
soda and cookies," said sophomore
Ghazal Badiozamani, who was en
rolled in Casper's seminar.
Both Rice and Casper dined
with their class occasionally.
Casper said he also had a pool party
with his students.
In the beginning, however, most
students felt intimidated about
having either as a professor.
"One may start out thinking that
she wouldn't be accessible, that
she'd be condescending, but that's
not true at all," sophomore Paul Lee
said of Rice. His classmates, sopho
mores Nina Olman and Lisa Liao
agreed, stressing how personable
and approachable Rice is.
"It didn't hinder the student
mentor relationship just because

she's fm administrator," Liao said.
What struck Badiozamani was
Casper's ability to make people
comfortable quickly.
"He was always joking and never
made you feel like the answer you
give is wrong," Badiozamani said.
Casper commented that the ini
tial "wow aspect" for the students
disappeared fast, and Rice concurred
that her provost status did not
change her relationship to the class.
Administrators "are faculty
members first and foremost," Rice
said.
According to Liao, Rice was an
inspirational teacher effective in
guiding the learning process and
discussions.
Lee also appreciated how Rice
was able to provide behind-the
scenes insight. Rice served as the
special assistant to the president for
national security Affairs under for
mer President George Bush.
Lee, Liao and Olman all empha
sized the class's simulation of a
summit between the United States

and Russia. Students took on roles
of top leaders and discussed issues
such as NATO expansion.
"I learned the most from the
simulation; it was unique and very
useful," Olman said. "We went in
thinking we'll come out with quick
peaceful compromises, but we al
most started the Cold War again."
Badiozamani also considered
Casper an "incredible prof' and
learned not just from him but also
about him. Casper's stories of pres
idential duties and immense work
loads made her appreciate even
more his efforts to teach and inter
act with students.
"To see administrators who can
fulfill roles of both is impressive,"
she said. "It gives the University a
more academic feel and helps us see
the administration not as a sepa
rate entity but as people also."
To Casper, one aspect that
makes teaching, especially in semi
nars, different from being an ad
ministrator is the unpredictability
that arises from the students' dis

similar backgrounds, interests and
perspectives.
"You can teach the same materi
al to three groups and each class
will turn out differentlyâ€” that
makes it fascinating and challeng
ing," Casper said. "On the whole,
what occurs in administrative
meetings is often too predictable."
Aside from sophomore college,
Rice usually teaches one course in
political science during the school
year, such as 217R, "Seminar: The
Transformation of Europe," of
fered last quarter.
"I love teaching, and one reason
I continue to do it is because unless
I'm teaching, I don't have a good
idea of what's going on with the stu
dents," Rice said.
Otherwise, Rice added, her per
spective would be filtered through
administrative and other factors.
Casper offered another reason
for his enjoyment of teaching:
"Teaching gives me a break from my
other daily routines," he said. "It
takes me out; it's like leaving town."
