Editor's note: This the second article in a series that
looks at the three tickets runiting for ASSUpresident
and vice president.

If elected ASSU president
and vice president, Jim Fin
sten and Kelly Naylor want to
focus on what they think will
be the most important issue
open to them — improving the

educational experience of Stanford students both in
side and outside the classroom.
Finsten, a senior, and Naylor, a junior, have many
ideas on how student education can be improved, in
cluding strengthened support for undergraduate
teaching, interdisciplinary majors and student orga
nizations. Additionally, Finsten and Naylor would
like to see student representation on the Hoard of
Trustees.
These are goals Naylor and Finsten said they feel

Junior Kelly Naylor, a vice presidential candidate, and Senior Jim Finsten, who is run
ning for president, are focusing on a platform of student empowerment.
equipped to tackle. Both have ex
tensive experience as leaders of
student organizations: Finsten in
Stanford in Government, the Jew
ish Student Association and Sigma
Phi Epsilon fraternity, and Naylor
as a cabinet member of the ASSU
President's Office, in Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford
and in Alternative Spring Break.
Naylor is also currently working to
create a public service minor.
Finsten and Naylor see the
ASSU as a way to implement
"grass-roots democracy," at Stan
ford, according to Naylor. If elect
ed, she and Finsten plan to have an
active office that will depend on the
interest and participation of stu
dents.
During their term, Finsten and
Naylor would like to hold regular
office hours, set up e-mail distribu
tion lists and eat dinner regularly
with various dormitories in order
to remain in close contact with stu

dent concerns.
Their role would be as "advo
cates for student concerns to the
University and the community,"
Naylor said.
"Think of us as your union rep
resentatives," Finsten added.
Many of the improvements that
Finsten and Naylor envision in
volve resource allocation — what
the University decides to spend its
money on.
"What the University chooses to
support should reflect the values of
the community," Naylor said.
Finsten and Naylor want to
work with faculty members on a
possible system that would offer
merit-based pay incentives for pro
fessors recognized for excellent
teaching — an idea first recom
mended by a University committee
20 years ago, Finsten said.
"There aren't any core encour
agements for teaching, as there are
for research and administration."
Finsten said. The tenure process
currently favors research over
teaching, Finsten added.
Naylor and Finsten also want
the University to allocate more

funds for interdisciplinary majors,
which include human biology, pub
lic policy and international rela
tions. These majors suffer, Finsten
said, because they borrow faculty
from other departments and there
fore do not receive departmentally
based funding.
"Stanford is at the forefront of
higher education with IDPs. Re
sources are limited, but IDPs need
to come first," Finsten said.
Finsten and Naylor also want to
improve life outside of the class
room by guaranteeing a student
union that has space for student
organizations, full University
compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act and a full
time staff member for the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
Especially in light of recent anti
gay hate crimes, Finsten said, it is
important for the center's request
to be granted.
Placing a student representa
tive on the Board of Trustees is cru
cial to improving communication
between the University and stu
dents, Finsten and Naylor said.

"The members of the board are
wonderful people who care about
students and Stanford," Finsten
said. "It's just hard for [students]
to reach the Board of Trustees."
"It is hard for the board to keep
in touch with the needs of the com
munity," Naylor added.
Naylor and Finsten both serve
on committees to the board — Nay
lor on the Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility and Fin
sten on the Standing Committee
on Development. Although such
committees give students some
representation, there "isn't open
communication between the com
mittees and the board," Naylor
said.
While Naylor and Finsten are
concentrating on affecting change
at Stanford on a local level, they re
alize that decisions made at Stan
ford potentially can influence other
universities throughout the coun
try.
"We don't have a Utopian vi
sion, but we can improve the stu
dent experience and the role that
the University plays in society,"
Naylor said.
