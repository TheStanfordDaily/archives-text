## Pope arrives in Bosnia speaking of a peaceful future 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Pope John Paul II
arrived in the Bosnian capital on a
long-delayed mission of peace yes
terday, hours after police found at
least 23 mines, detonators and
plastic explosives on the route he
was to take into Sarajevo.
The Interior Ministry said the
explosives, found under a bridge,
were planted overnight. A
spokesman denied a report by the
official BH Press news agency,
which quoted police as saying they
were left over from the 3 1/2-year
war and Serb siege of Sarajevo.
"The danger has been
removed, and an investigation is
under way," said spokesman
Suad Arnautovic.
There was no indication who
planted the devices, but there has
been a series of explosions at
churches and mosques in Bosnia
in recent weeks. Officials have
said they appeared to be an effort
to heighten tensions and discour
age the pope from coming.
After arriving on schedule,
John Paul appeared at the door
way of his Italian Alitalia jet and
waved to the crowd before mak
ing his way slowly down the ramp
to kiss a box of Bosnian earth
handed to him by two youths.
Five helicopters were ready to
ferry the pope and his entourage
directly to the Roman Catholic
cathedral in downtown Sarajevo,
bypassing the stretch of road
where the explosives were found.
But the pope refused, insisting
he wanted to stick to the land

route to give him an opportunity
to see the city, his spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
The six-mile trip into the city
passed without incident. Outside
the cathedral, the pope waded into
the crowds jamming the tiny
square and narrow streets. Italian
sharpshooters with red berets
were stationed on nearby rooftops.
Twelve-year-old Stanislav Stje
povic, stunned by being so close to
the pontiff, said with wonder:
"It's like I started my life all over
again."
At the airport, the pontiff was
greeted by religious and political
leaders including Bosnian Presi
dent Alija Izetbegovic and Roman
Catholic Cardinal Vinko Puljic.
The war-damaged buildings
and pockmarked facades of Sara
jevo were clearly visible from the
air. In his arrival remarks, deliv
ered in Serbo-Croatian, John Paul
said: "Never again war. Never
again hatred and intolerance."
The pope's visit is intended to
help heal Bosnia's war wounds,
but it also highlights the divisions
that remain in the country.
Beneath a veneer of coopera
tion and goodwill, Muslims and
Roman Catholic Croats are bick
ering about their joint federation.
There was no Serb official on
hand to welcome the pope when
he arrived.
As part of his message of rec
onciliation, the pope told Bosni
ans that the "natural instinct for
revenge must yield to the liberat
ing power of forgiveness."
