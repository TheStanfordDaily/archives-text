### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The main suspect in the anti
gay vandalism that occurred at a
Suites eating club April 7 has ad
mitted a role in the incident, said
police, who expect charges to be
filed today.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said police would ask
the Santa Clara County district at
torney today to issue charges
against the suspect.
Asst. District Attorney Karen
Sinunu said she would decide after
today's consultation whether
felony or misdemeanor charges
were appropriate and whether the

incident could be designated as a
hate crime under state law.
Niemeyer confirmed earlier re
ports that police had questioned
two students, one a Stanford se
nior and one apparently a UC-
Berkeley student. .
Part of the graffiti written on
the wall of The Bollard eating club
ended in the phrase, "I'm from
Cal."
However, Niemeyer did not dis
close which student was the one
who made the admission.
He also said it is unlikely, bar
ring "a complete reversal," that
anyone will be charged other than
the student who already has come
forward.
