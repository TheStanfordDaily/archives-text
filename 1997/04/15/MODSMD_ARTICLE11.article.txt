McDougal gets lenient sentence
LI 1 TLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — James McDou
gal, the Clintons' former business partner, drew a
lenient three-year prison sentence yesterday for
18 felonies after the Whitewater prosecutor told
the court his cooperation led to information "pre
viously unknown to us."
McDougal could have received up to 84 years in
prison. He sent an ominous signal to the Clintons
by backing away from his statement a year ago that
he expected them to be absolved of wrongdoing.
"I wouldn't go to the bank on that," McDougal
said, drawing a crowd of reporters outside the court
room as he has often since emerging as the central
figure in the Whitewater affair five years ago.
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr said McDougal's help has led to a "fuller,
broader, deeper understanding" of the evidence
that led to the wide-ranging investigation of the
Clintons' finances.
"It has led us to both documents and it has led
us to witnesses," Starr said. He added that much
of information has been independently corrobo
rated.

Tax deadline arrives
WASHINGTON (AP) — As millions scrambled
to meet tonight's tax deadline, politicians engaged
in a related spring ritual: a lot of ideas for reform
and a little Internal Revenue Service bashing.
The Clinton administration proposed a package
of 60 mostly minor initiatives to simplify the tax
code, such as making tax payments with a credit
card and streamlining rules for claiming deduc
tions for dependent children younger than 19.
Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, geared up
for a week's worth of events making a case for dra
matic tax reform and focusing on allegations of mis
management and computer problems at the IRS.
Post offices in nearly every major city will
extend hours or offer late mail pickups tonight.
President and Mrs. Clinton did their filing
early and released the results yesterday. They
reported income of just over $1 million — nearly
three-fourths of it from Mrs. Clinton's book "It
Takes a Village" — and paid taxes of about
$200,000. They gave the book's proceeds to char
ity after taking out enough to pay for the taxes on
the book royalties.
