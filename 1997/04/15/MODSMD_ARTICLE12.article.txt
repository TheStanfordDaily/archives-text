# Reno wants career prosecutor
## Decision on campaign fund-raising investigation angers GOP 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Janet
Reno yesterday rejected Republican calls for an inde
pendent counsel to investigate campaign fund-rais
ing and said there is no specific, credible evidence
implicating the highest White House officials in
felonies.
"I am unable to agree, based on the facts and the
law, that an independent counsel should be appoint
ed to handle this investigation," Reno wrote Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah. She maintained that career prosecutors can
handle the probe.
"At this time we have no specific, credible evi
dence that any covered White House official may
have committed a federal crime," Reno said. She was
referring to a provision of the independent counsel
law that requires a counsel be named to investigate
evidence of felonies by the president, vice president
and their highest-ranking advisers.
The White House was low-key but obviously
pleased with Reno's decision, while Republicans in
Congress reacted angrily with Senate Majority Lead
er Trent Lott, R-Miss., calling Reno's decision "inex
cusable."
Reno reviewed some specific allegations:
• On Vice President A 1 Gore's solicitation of con

tributions from a White House office telephone,
prosecutors are investigating but she said his use of
a "government telephone, charging the calls to a
nongovernment credit card" is permitted under reg
ulations allowing "incidental use of government
property for otherwise lawful personal purposes."
• Concerning solicitation and contribution of so
called "soft money" donations to political parties for
advertising, Reno said in 1979 "over the objection of
the Department of Justice" Congress removed soft
money from most of the prohibitions in federal cam
paign law.
• On the use of overnight stays in the White
House's Lincoln bedroom or coffees there, Reno
noted that "there are private areas of the White
House that . . . fall outside *he scope of the law,"
because "this residence is still the personal home of
an individual."
• On possible foreign efforts to influence the U.S.
presidential and congressional elections, Reno did
not mention China, although prosecutors are inves
tigating possible Asian influence. There is no reason
Justice prosecutors cannot investigate this as they
did allegations of Korean influence-buying in the
19705, Reno wrote, adding that there is no evidence
of complicity by top U.S. officials.
