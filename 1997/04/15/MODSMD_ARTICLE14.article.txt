## Right combination 
### 
In field of three strong
presidential tickets,
Andrus' is the best

TOO MANY TIMES in elec
tions, citizens are forced to
choose between a candidate
they don't like and a candidate they
can't stand. American democracy
hasn't produced many high-caliber
candidates in the last few presiden
tial races, and that is reflected in
ever-lower voter turnout rates.
Democracy at Stanford, it
seems, has taken a much different
route. Rather than no qualified
candidates for next year's ASSU
president, there are three.
Emily Andrus, Jim Finsten and
Howard Loo each have put in
innumerable hours of service at
Stanford, working both inside and
outside the ASSU to effect
change. Each has a definite plan
in place for the year, and each
would make a good president to
lead the student body.
But one candidate stands above
the rest: Emily Andrus.
Andrus, along with her running
mate, junior Ben Decker, offers the
best combination of skills, experi
ence and charisma. She and Decker
will represent Stanford students
well to the administration, the fac
ulty and the nation.
Andrus, a junior, has served as
an undergraduate senator for one
year, taking time to chair the sen
ate Appropriations Committee
and work with the Budget and
Finance Committee. Prior to that,
she was a member of the ASSU
Program Board and participated
actively in dorm government and
community service programs, as
well as working in the Office of the
President and Provost.
Decker has spent his three

years at Stanford in dorm govern
ment, as a member of the Inter
fraternity Council executive com
mittee and as an employee in the
Office of the General Counsel.
Andrus' experience in particular
makes her well-prepared to be
ASSU president. She has proved
not only a dedication to Stanford
and its students but a talent at
leadership that indicates she will
be able to work with all the differ
ent people and organizations nec
essary to be an effective president.
Highly respected by her col
leagues at the ASSU, Andrus has
shown herself to be a leader of
integrity who has a clear vision of
what she wants to do. Further
more, she makes the important
admission that the ASSU Presi
dent's Office cannot work alone.
The ideas presented by Andrus
and Decker in their platform are
ones that students care about, as
much as they seem at first glance
to be a collection of catch phrases.
The Big Game Bonfire, for exam
ple, is perhaps not the weightiest
of issues that students in the
1990s face, but when asked, it's
what Stanford wants.
Many other issues, such as com
pleting a student course-review
guide and communicating better
with graduate students, are long
standing issues that the ASSU has
never had much success in dealing
with despite repeated promises.
Andrus and Decker have examined
these past failures and developed
their own idea about how to accom
plish their specific goals. With her
previous experience working with
students, administrators and facul
ty, Andrus especially has a good
chance of success.
In a field of three strong tickets,
Emily Andrus and Ben Decker
stand out. They have the experi
ence, the leadership and the vision
to effectively lead Stanford's stu
dent body through the 1997-98 year.
