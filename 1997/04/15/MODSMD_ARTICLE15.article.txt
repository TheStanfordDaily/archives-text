Facts were ignored in fee-amendment endorsement

I HAD THOUGHT that I was too cyni
cal to be shocked by anything these
days, but the scale of the ignorance
displayed by The Daily's constitutional
amendment recommendations proved me
wrong. I am the author of Amendments 3
("To rationalize the powers of the Consti
tutional Council") and 10 ("Special fee
sanity"), both of which were given nega
tive recommendations. Had The Daily
bothered to contact me before coming up
with these recommendations, they could
have avoided embarrassing themselves
with the kitty litter they printed.
The mistakes in The Daily's discussion
of Amendment 3 are plentiful, but 1 will
not dwell on them as they are clearly
reviewed in another letter. Fortunately,
the errors committed in The Daily's dis
cussion of Amendment 10 leave more than
enough material to fill the space I have
been allowed. The Daily complains that
"the second provision of the amendment
does not make much sense. This language
would strip the senate of its power to dic
tate which population a special-fee group

may apply to." The Daily seems ignorant
of the fact that the ASSU Constitution
already denies this power to the senate.
"Each student organization shall
determine from which population it will
seek funding for its Special Fee," the con
stitution states in article V, section 2,
subsection A.
Unless The Daily misread "student
organization" as "senate," it is unclear
where it got the idea that the senate has
the power to force special-fee groups to
apply to specific populations.
This issue came up in the senate last
quarter when special-fee groups were
being placed on the ballot. It was the con
sensus of the parliamentarian (myself),
the senate chair and then-Constitutional
Council nominee Robert Windom (who
was attending the meeting to see if he
would be confirmed) that the constitu
tion was fairly clear on this issue. This
exchange can be found in the minutes of
the 13th meeting of the First Senate, and
interested readers should refer to that
document for a more complete presenta

tion. Apparently, The Daily was unaware
of this information and did not see fit to
educate itself on the matter before
attempting to comment. So let me say it
again: This amendment does not take
away from the senate any power which it
presently possesses.
Given this, one is tempted to ask: If
this is already in the constitution, why is
an amendment needed? That The Daily
led itself astray is a good indication that
the section needs to be clarified, if only to
avoid a similar muddle in the future. And
surely clear language is to be desired,
especially in an issue as potentially con
tentious as funding.
But The Daily endorsement also states
that this amendment will encourage
groups to apply to undergraduates only.
This is probably true, but the force of this
"reasoning" is undermined bv the struc
ture of the special-fee system. If students
feel that too many groups are charging
them too much special-fee money, they
can and will request fee refunds. To sug
gest that the "solution" is instead to force

groups, in violation of even the current
constitution, to apply to both populations
seems insane at best. Evidently, The
Daily would rather have groups that have
nothing to do with graduate students
either fail at the ballots or be refunded to
the point of bankruptcy afterward.
I cannot reasonably expect The Daily
to print retractions of their severely
flawed recommendations, even though
they were based upon obvious factual
mistakes and relied on reasoning that
would embarrass a child. This is unfortu
nate: Stanford students deserve better
than, to use The Daily's own language in
a more appropriate context, these "ill
considered" and "poorly thought-out"
recommendations.
But I hope that I have made it clear
that these recommendations aren't
worth the paper on which they are print
ed, and I encourage students to vote for
these two important amendments.
