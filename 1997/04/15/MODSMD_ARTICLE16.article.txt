# Daily missed point of council amendment
## 
### 
1 read the Opinions page of yesterday's
Daily with shock and dismay when I dis
covered that The Daily was endorsing
against the proposed constitutional
amendment "To Kationnlize the Power of
the Constitutional Council."
The Kditorial Hoard completely
missed the point of the amendment. I'll

spell it out for you: Under the current
text of the ASSU Constitution, the Con
stitutional Council has the right to
bring any ease before itself that it wants.
This has been nicknamed "proactive
judicial review" — it means that the
Council can, if a majority of its members
want to, do anything.
They could strike down special fees;
they could knock down appointments to
the ASSU's boards and University com
mittees; they could bypass or rewrite any
and all senate legislation — all entirely on

their own initiative. Further, under the
current language of the constitution,
these people can't be removed ever, until
they resign or cease to be registered stu
dents. Do students really want that?
If anyone at The Daily had actually
asked the author of this amendment
about the bill and the motivations
behind it, they would have found this
out. Calling parts of the text "ill
thought-out" without actually asking
the author about them is irresponsible
journalism.

The proposed amendment fixes this
glaring lack of checks and balances. It
only allows the council to consider cases
brought before it by others. It also lets
the council decide whether complaints
brought by senators are frivolous. (Trust
me; having been in the senate for two
years, I know that's important.) I urge
the student body to vote for I-CA-3. It's
the only rational decision.
