## Scoffing at the republic 
### 
AHH . . . DEMOCRACY. Not so
long ago, I yearned to immerse
myself in the republic of Stan
ford. I had alphabet soup dreams of
COP and SCLC, and I was ready to con
vince the world that I would be "the
one" to make the ASSU more responsive
to the student body.
I guess I saw it as the first step in a
larger plan to eventually become a U.S.
president, possibly followed by supreme
overlord of the universe.
My hunger for political fame and for
tune was born during a trip to Washing
ton four years ago. On my last night in
that city of power ties and one-topic con
versation, I found myself staring up at
the Jefferson Memorial, thinking "God,
wouldn't it be cool if somebody made a
statue like this of me?"
Fortunately, my ego has moved on to
other means of self-fulfillment, like
being a Daily columnist. In fact, after
spending three months in the nation's
capital last year, I am disillusioned with
the policy process, and it has become
almost unfathomable to me why anyone
would want to dedicate their life to poli
tics, on campus or for the entire nation.
Call me crazy, but I wouldn't trade a
single run through the Foothills or a
round of beers at the Coffee House for
all the power, Post-It notes, personal
ized notebooks and massive time com
mitment that the ASSU presidency
could bring to me.

I'm becoming the stereotypical
senior, so apathetic about campus
events that I choose to forego the entire
voting process. After all, what has the
ASSU done for me lately? Why should I
choose to support the resume packers
who populate the ranks of student gov
ernment? Why should I accept another
year of quixotic tilts at the windmills of
the post office and the Bookstore?
I'm not the only one who feels this
way. Most of us here are "leaders," and
we don't like adopting the passive title
of "followers." Thus we chafe at those
who attempt to represent us. We take
care of ourselves and become awfully
complacent about our surrounding uni
versity and its unquestionably unrecep
tive administration. We scoff at the
republic and, in doing so, sacrifice
democracy.
When we do not participate in the
process, we implicitly say we don't care
about the issues. Rut our apathy doesn't
just save our precious time; it costs stu
dent groups the opportunity to pursue
their goals and dreams and prevents
students from ever achieving a consis
tent voice that University President
Gerhard Casper and the Hoard of
Trustees will heed.
Maybe there are students who can
overcome not only the political barriers
of the University but our collective stu
dent disinterest as well. In the midst of
swimming in an endless mass of slick

flyers and creative acronyms, I met one
of the vice presidential candidates, and I
saw the fire in her eyes when she talked
about her plans for a public service
minor. For a moment, I believed that
there may be something to that idea of a
"University for Students."
I want the community of a democra
cy, and if there are students willing to
devote themselves to the bureaucracy in
order to receive funding or popular sup
port, I will give that opportunity to
them. That's why I will vote "yes" for a
climbing wall that I may never use, and
I will take time to elect people who may
not be able to directly improve my life
here at Stanford.
Come Wednesday morning, I will
choose 15 senators out of the handbook,
I will cast my ballot for Jim Finsten and
Kelly Naylor, and I will write in David
Harris for the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council.
But most important, I will momen
tarily suppress my cynicism and vote.
Our fellow students who devote parts of
their lives to these causes and offices
deserve no less.
