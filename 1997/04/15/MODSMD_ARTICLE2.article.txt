# Graduate apathy weakening the ASSU special-fee process
## Population change 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Last year, the low student
turnout for the ASSU Spring Gen
eral Election caused many groups
to lose their special fee.
However, groups noticed that no
group who applied to only the un
dergraduate population lost their
special fee, while numerous groups
who applied to both the undergrad
uate and graduate populations lost,
including the Stanford Concert
Network, KZSU and MEChA.
Because of this, some of the
groups that applied to both popula
tions last year have redirected their
program efforts, aiming at under
graduates, and they are now asking
for special-fee money only from the
undergraduate population.
Last year, 18 of the 30 groups ap
plied to both populations for their
special fees. This year, only six of
the 30 groups applied to both popu
lations.
"Most groups are taking advan

tage of undergraduates," said
ASSU President Bill Shen. "There
will probably be a backlash in a few
years."
Graduate apathy
Last year was the first year that
groups were split in special-fee vot
ing. In that election, nine groups
lost their special fees even though
they got more than a majority of the
vote — almost 68 percent in one
case — because of the stipulation
that groups must also receive the
vote of 15 percent of the total popu
lation.
Because there was such low
voter turnout among graduate stu
dents, it was much harder for
groups applying to both groups to
get 15 percent of the total popula
tion to vote for them. Last year, all
nine of the groups that lost despite
a majority voting for them applied
to both populations.
"We felt very frustrated to see
the special fee get voted down due to
the lack of participation on the
graduate student side," said senior
Justin Davis, the student manager
of the Stanford Jazz Orchestra.
Last year, the group lost, despite
getting "yes" votes from 66.8 per
cent of those voting.
A number of the groups also
cited a shrinking amount of gradu
ate involvement in their program as
a reason for changing voting popu
lations.
"In past years, grads have been
more active," said junior Judy
Carza, the treasurer of the Barrio
Assistance program. "This year, we
have only one graduate student."
Changing to win?
In addition to the jazz orchestra,
four other groups that lost —
MECIiA, the Stanford American In
dian Organization, the Stanford
Solar Car Project and Project Moti
vation — changed voting popula
tions this year.
The Stanford Women's Collec
tive last year — the group that
funded the Women's Center — also
lost, after requesting funding from
both populations. This year, the
Stanford Women's Coalition, repre
sen ting a number of undergraduate
women's groups, requested funding
from the undergraduate population

only. The Women's Center itself is
now funded by the University.
Junior Bernadette Mahoney, the
treasurer of the Women's Coalition,
said the group changed because all
of the organizations requesting fees
through the coalition cater to un
dergraduates.
According to junior Stephanie
Surbida, financial officer of Project
Motivation, last year's loss was not
the main motivation to change pop
ulations for them either.
"We are promoting undergradu
ate education and for us, the deci
sion was very simple," she said. She
added that the majority of those
participating in the organization
are undergraduates.
Davis said the decline in gradu
ate student participation in the jazz
ensemble helped make the decision
easy. He said that while more grad
uates were members of the group
last year, only one member out of
about 30 this year is a graduate stu
dent. However, he said the loss of
the fee last year was the primary
reason.
"The overriding factor [to
change| was our ability to receive
funding without running into the
15-percent problem, to be honest,"
he said.
Junior Forrest Deuth, the Stan
ford team leader of the Stanford
Solar Car Project, also said their
loss last year led to their decision
this year.
"With the 15-percent rule and
graduate students not voting, we

can't risk losing the election again,"
he said.
Changing despite winning
In addition, four groups — the
Stanford Band, the Barrio Assis
tance program, the Stanford Home
lessness Action Coalition and the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network —
changed populations even though
they won their special fee last year.
"We thought about it," said
SHAC Treasurer Matt Bartels, a
doctoral student. "We realized that
for the past three or four years, I
have been the sole graduate stu
dent."
Bartels said the group has made
efforts to reach out to graduates in
the past, but they have had little
success.
However, Bartels said, "The
thing that really frightened us is
that a certain percentage have to
vote for us to win. Given the gener
al apathy among graduate students,
to have an absolute number stan
dard is a really high hurdle to over
come. If it were just a majority, we'd
be more interested in asking gradu
ate students."
Garza said the fact that only one
graduate student is active in the
Barrio Assistance program means
graduate students would not be
able to cast an informed vote. How
ever, she said the numerous special
fee losses last year also influenced
their decision.
"We obviously don't want to lose
our special fee, as it would seriously

hurt our program," she said.
However, senior Scott
McKissen, the manager of the Stan
ford Band, said the numerous loss
es last year were a worry, but the
main reason the Band's fee request
changed was because most students
participating in the Band are under
graduates.
Not allowed to change
While groups such as the Band
were allowed to change popula
tions, three organizations — KZSU,
SCBN and the Stanford Concert
Network — wanted to change popu
lations but were not allowed to.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Ghazal Badiozamani said, "The Ap
propriations Committee of the Sen
ate, which meets with groups and
discusses their budgets with them,
decided that SCBN and KZSU did
serve enough of the graduate popu
lation to warrant their placement on
the grad and undergraduate ballot.
was presented to the
groups as a recommendation, and
the groups agreed and changed
their request."
The concert network was also
recommended to have both popula
tions vote for them, despite their
wishes, according to Shen.
While KZSU General Manager
Sean Kennedy said he understood
the committee's reasons for having
the station appear on both ballots,
he was not happy.
"I was upset understandably be
cause last year, the split [voting]

was a major reason we lost the fee,"
Kennedy said. "Not enough grad
students voted."
Senior Trevor Gattis, the SCBN
station manager, said the station
had to live with the committee's
recommendation.
"There's really nothing we can
do," Gattis said. "We're trying just
to get everyone to vote for us. Even
if we get enough undergrads to vote,
we'll be fme, as long as we get 15
percent."
Reaching out?
This year, the ASSU is making
an effort to reach out to graduate
students to vote, according to Ba
diozamani.
"We have given elections hand
books to campus mailing to be dis
tributed via [interdepartmental)
mail," she said. "We have created
ads to be shown before Flicks and
Teleflicks, and SCBN is running a
reminder to vote. Hopefully, this
will increase grad interest and par
ticipation in the election."
She added that paper ballot sites
are also being added to get gradu
ates to the polls. In addition to the
balloting site at the Law School,
new sites will be set up at Tresidder
Union, the Med Student cafe and
the Graduate School of Business
courtyard
However, only six groups are re
questing fees from graduates. Sev
eral of the other groups are already
saying they will no longer reach out
to graduate students because the

graduates will not be paying for the
groups' special fees,
Davis said the jazz orchestra will
continue to allow graduate students
to attend their concerts, but they
will not make an effort to cater to
them.
"We will continue to play in un
dergraduate residences," he said.
"We will not put up fliers in solely
graduate housing, and we'll provide
our services explicitly to undergrad
uate dorms."
Bartels also said SHAC will also
target undergraduates more than
graduates, even though it will have
no policy of exclusion.
Such trends are disturbing,
graduate student representatives
said. ASSU Graduate Senator
Alane Murdock said that groups are
misinformed in their opinions that
graduate student apathy caused
last year's losses.
"The problem was low voter
turnout from both populations,"
Murdock said, adding that even
though the graduate turnout was
worse, "the fact that undergradu
ate was lower than normal" was
key.
Murdock also said she fears that
graduates will be excluded by stu
dent groups more than ever before.
" It gives them a real incentive to cut
graduate students out because that
way they can say that they're un
dergraduate-only when it comes to
special-fee time. It's sad that we
have a special-fee system that looks
to split populations so specifically."
Last year, the low student
turnout for the ASSU Spring Gen
eral Election caused many groups
to lose their special fee.
However, groups noticed that no

are undergraduates.
Davis said the decline in gradu
ate student participation in the jazz
ensemble helped make the decision
easy. He said that while more grad
uates were members of the group
last year, only one member out of
about 30 this year is a graduate stu
dent. However, he said the loss of
the fee last year was the primary
reason.
"The overriding factor [to
change| was our ability to receive
funding without running into the
15-percent problem, to be honest,"
he said.
Junior Forrest Deuth, the Stan
ford team leader of the Stanford
Solar Car Project, also said their
loss last year led to their decision
this year.
"With the 15-percent rule and
graduate students not voting, we

can't risk losing the election again,"
he said.
Changing despite winning
In addition, four groups — the
Stanford Band, the Barrio Assis
tance program, the Stanford Home
lessness Action Coalition and the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network —
changed populations even though
they won their special fee last year.
"We thought about it," said
SHAC Treasurer Matt Bartels, a
doctoral student. "We realized that
for the past three or four years, I
have been the sole graduate stu
dent."
Bartels said the group has made
efforts to reach out to graduates in
the past, but they have had little
success.
However, Bartels said, "The
thing that really frightened us is
that a certain percentage have to
vote for us to win. Given the gener
al apathy among graduate students,
to have an absolute number stan
dard is a really high hurdle to over
come. If it were just a majority, we'd
be more interested in asking gradu
ate students."
Garza said the fact that only one
graduate student is active in the
Barrio Assistance program means
graduate students would not be
able to cast an informed vote. How
ever, she said the numerous special
fee losses last year also influenced
their decision.
"We obviously don't want to lose
our special fee, as it would seriously

hurt our program," she said.
However, senior Scott
McKissen, the manager of the Stan
ford Band, said the numerous loss
es last year were a worry, but the
main reason the Band's fee request
changed was because most students
participating in the Band are under
graduates.
Not allowed to change
While groups such as the Band
were allowed to change popula
tions, three organizations — KZSU,
SCBN and the Stanford Concert
Network — wanted to change popu
lations but were not allowed to.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Ghazal Badiozamani said, "The Ap
propriations Committee of the Sen
ate, which meets with groups and
discusses their budgets with them,
decided that SCBN and KZSU did
serve enough of the graduate popu
lation to warrant their placement on
the grad and undergraduate ballot.
was presented to the
groups as a recommendation, and
the groups agreed and changed
their request."
The concert network was also
recommended to have both popula
tions vote for them, despite their
wishes, according to Shen.
While KZSU General Manager
Sean Kennedy said he understood
the committee's reasons for having
the station appear on both ballots,
he was not happy.
"I was upset understandably be
cause last year, the split [voting]

was a major reason we lost the fee,"
Kennedy said. "Not enough grad
students voted."
Senior Trevor Gattis, the SCBN
station manager, said the station
had to live with the committee's
recommendation.
"There's really nothing we can
do," Gattis said. "We're trying just
to get everyone to vote for us. Even
if we get enough undergrads to vote,
we'll be fme, as long as we get 15
percent."
Reaching out?
This year, the ASSU is making
an effort to reach out to graduate
students to vote, according to Ba
diozamani.
"We have given elections hand
books to campus mailing to be dis
tributed via [interdepartmental)
mail," she said. "We have created
ads to be shown before Flicks and
Teleflicks, and SCBN is running a
reminder to vote. Hopefully, this
will increase grad interest and par
ticipation in the election."
She added that paper ballot sites
are also being added to get gradu
ates to the polls. In addition to the
balloting site at the Law School,
new sites will be set up at Tresidder
Union, the Med Student cafe and
the Graduate School of Business
courtyard
However, only six groups are re
questing fees from graduates. Sev
eral of the other groups are already
saying they will no longer reach out
to graduate students because the

graduates will not be paying for the
groups' special fees,
Davis said the jazz orchestra will
continue to allow graduate students
to attend their concerts, but they
will not make an effort to cater to
them.
"We will continue to play in un
dergraduate residences," he said.
"We will not put up fliers in solely
graduate housing, and we'll provide
our services explicitly to undergrad
uate dorms."
Bartels also said SHAC will also
target undergraduates more than
graduates, even though it will have
no policy of exclusion.
Such trends are disturbing,
graduate student representatives
said. ASSU Graduate Senator
Alane Murdock said that groups are
misinformed in their opinions that
graduate student apathy caused
last year's losses.
"The problem was low voter
turnout from both populations,"
Murdock said, adding that even
though the graduate turnout was
worse, "the fact that undergradu
ate was lower than normal" was
key.
Murdock also said she fears that
graduates will be excluded by stu
dent groups more than ever before.
" It gives them a real incentive to cut
graduate students out because that
way they can say that they're un
dergraduate-only when it comes to
special-fee time. It's sad that we
have a special-fee system that looks
to split populations so specifically."
