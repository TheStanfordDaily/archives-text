# Graduate apathy weakening the ASSU special-fee process
## Population change 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Last year, the low student
turnout for the ASSU Spring Gen
eral Election caused many groups
to lose their special fee.
However, groups noticed that no
group who applied to only the un
dergraduate population lost their
special fee, while numerous groups
who applied to both the undergrad
uate and graduate populations lost,
including the Stanford Concert
Network, KZSU and MEChA.
Because of this, some of the
groups that applied to both popula
tions last year have redirected their
program efforts, aiming at under
graduates, and they are now asking
for special-fee money only from the
undergraduate population.
Last year, 18 of the 30 groups ap
plied to both populations for their
special fees. This year, only six of
the 30 groups applied to both popu
lations.
"Most groups are taking advan

tage of undergraduates," said
ASSU President Bill Shen. "There
will probably be a backlash in a few
years."
Graduate apathy
Last year was the first year that
groups were split in special-fee vot
ing. In that election, nine groups
lost their special fees even though
they got more than a majority of the
vote — almost 68 percent in one
case — because of the stipulation
that groups must also receive the
vote of 15 percent of the total popu
lation.
Because there was such low
voter turnout among graduate stu
dents, it was much harder for
groups applying to both groups to
get 15 percent of the total popula
tion to vote for them. Last year, all
nine of the groups that lost despite
a majority voting for them applied
to both populations.
