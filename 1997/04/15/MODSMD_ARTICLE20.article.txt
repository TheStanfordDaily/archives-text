# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
To make informed special-fee
endorsements, members of The Daily's
Editorial Board spent more than 30
hours over the past week and a half
carefully reviewing the budget and
Elections Handbook statement each
fee-seeking group submitted to the
ASSU. Whenever possible, the Editori
al Board also met with representatives
from each group and asked them ques
tions about the group 's goals, member
ship, outside funding and specific
budget line items.
Based upon both the written infor
mation and the interview discussions,
the Editorial Board reached a majori
ty decision on each. The board has
attempted to include as much infor
mation as possible on each group in
the endorsement explanations. Still,
The Daily encourages all students to
obtain a copy of the Elections Hand
book and read each group's budget
and statement for themselves.
THERE IS NO doubt that each
and every group requesting a
special fee provides a worth
while service that is valuable to some
group of people. Nonetheless, the fee
system is designed to provide funding
for groups that serve a significant seg
ment of the student body. Thus,
although all the fee-seeking groups
would spend their money on good caus
es, The Daily felt it could not in good
conscience endorse every group;
should they all pass, next year's under
graduates would be saddled with ASSU
fees totaling $108.50 for the year.
In making its endorsements on spe
cial-fee requests, the Editorial Board
used five guiding criteria, which were
published in an editorial on April 1:
• Does the group provide good value
for the dollar?
• Does the group make a conscien-

Alternative $16,414.00
Spring Break (UO $2.51)
®YES ONO
Alternative Spring Breaks sends more than
130 Stanford students during spring break to
explore issues including homelessness, AIDS
and HIV, and children, women and ethnic minori
ties in underprivileged areas. It's such an effec
tive program that some of its participants have
gone on to create groups like Spoon and SHAC.
The program requires participants to pay
$40 to help with its costs and raises more than
half of its money from outside sources. The
group doubled its budget from last year to
expand its offerings, but some of those addi
tions seem rather cost-ineffective. One need
not go all the way to New Mexico's Jemez
reservation to find a Native American commu
nity in need of community service.
Asian American $27,810.00
Students (UO $4.25)
Association
(DYES ONO
The 31 different groups under AASA's
umbrella count nearly 1,000 students among
their members. Beyond its own membership,
though, AASA successfully branches out to
include all of the Stanford community; its
Screw Your Sib Dance and Fashion Show
draw large numbers of people not associated
with AASA. While some may argue that these
events are social in nature and thus contradict
its mission of promoting culture and educa
tion, AASA's dances and similar activities are
mainly funded through ticket sales, not its spe
cial fee. But it is important that AASA stays
focused on its core mission — educational
and cultural programming — even as it contin
ues social events like the picnics and dances
that dot its budget.
AASA is expanding the number of its pro
grams and increasing its budget by about
$10,000 next year. But the group is expanding
its outside fund-raising efforts and is actually
requesting a smaller special fee.
ASSU Legal $89,861.00
Counseling (B $6.51)
(DYES ONO
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office offers
free and confidential legal advice to students
and their spousos. The fee pays for the ser
vices of a San Jose-based law firm and the
salary of an office coordinator.
In an ideal world, students wouldn't need
this service, but unfortunately our world isn't
ideal. And the special fee for Legal Counseling
ensures that someone will be there when your
world operates imperfectly.
ASSU Speakers $113,425.00
Bureau (B $8.21)
(DYES ONO
The ASSU Speakers Bureau brought Maya
Angelou, Gene Kranz, Dinesh D'Souza and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to campus so far this year.
The group also co-sponsors several other
speakers with other student groups throughout
the year. Students who have not refunded their
Speakers Bureau special fee are admitted free
to all its events.
Although the group provides an invaluable
service, it's unfortunate that its members have
stopped their fundraising efforts with the Stan
ford Fund. The group takes in outside revenue
through ticket sales to the people beyond the
Stanford campus, but it always seems benefi
cial to have another source of funds
Barrio $22,810.98
Assistance (UO $3.48)
DYES NO
Barrio Assistance brings roughly 70 low
income Chicano / Latino youths who are having
difficulties in school to campus for one-on-one
tutorials with Stanford students Each Saturday

tious and reasonably successful effort
to involve and serve a significant por
tion of the student-body population
that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate ini
tiative in self-funding; that is, does its
budget indicate that the group is
actively seeking revenue sources other
than the special fee?
• Has the group responded to its
refund rate and the results of last
year's election?
• Should the student-body popula
tion targeted to fund the group's spe
cial fee — and not the University, a
different population or other parties
be financing the group's?
Groups that met these criteria well
received a "yes" endorsement.
Groups that did not received a "no."
The annual cost per student for
each group's fee is indicated in paren
theses under the group's gross fee
request amount. The per-capita
amounts were calculated using regis
tration figures for fall quarter of this
year: 13,811 total students, of whom
6,550 are undergraduates and 7,261
graduate students. A "B" prior to the
amount indicates that the fee will be
assessed to both undergraduates and
graduate students; a "UO" indicates
that the fee will be assessed to under
graduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements from groups or stu
dents; they will be published tomor
row or Thursday on a space-available
basis.
Please submit letters as early as

for the past 25 years, this group has brought
the children to Stanford, fed them breakfast and
tutored them. This program benefits both the
children and students looking for local commu
nity-service opportunities.
The group has expanded its efforts and now
tutors seventh- and eighth-grade students as
well. Yet its fee request is only $1,000 larger
than last year's. To cover its growing costs, the
group recently secured a Wells Fargo grant for
more than $18,000. Not only does the grant
provide a significant source of outside revenue,
but as a condition of the grant, the group must
perform a self-study evaluating its efficacy.
Black $22,730.77
Student Union (UO $3.47)
(DYES ONO
For 30 years the Black Student Union has
served the cultural and political needs of Stan
ford black students, and its cultural events,
open to the entire Stanford community, often
attract a significant number of non-black stu
dents. The group organizes several such pro
grams throughout the year, such as Martin
Luther King Jr. Week, Black Liberation Month
and the Soul Food Dinner. BSU members also
work in the surrounding communities by men
toring black high school students and promot
ing achievement.
It's important to note, however, that the
group does little fund raising — only $1,000.
Other ethnic groups — particularly AASA —
attract much larger amounts of outside funding;
the BSU should work to do the same.
Club Sports $156,376.00
(B $11.32)
d>YES ONO
Traditionally one of the most popular spe
cial-fee groups, Club Sports serves more than
1,000 students, both undergraduate and gradu
ate. The group provides funding for 15 different
non-varsity athletic teams, this year adding
bowling and table tennis to its roster.
Anyone can participate in any sport, and
team members must pay dues to their clubs.
International $9,439.00
Undergraduate (U051.44)
Community
(DYES ONO
The International Undergraduate Communi
ty's purpose is to help integrate undergradu
ates from foreign countries into American soci
ety through trips, an orientation and support
through the year. It would seem that this
responsibility should fall on the shoulders of the
Bechtel International Center, but the University
entity has apparently been unwilling to broaden
its focus beyond international graduate stu
dents.
Certainly international undergraduates need
some amount of guidance on the ways of their
new country. Imagine going to a Stanford over
seas center and receiving no support; it's a
frightening prospect. The group also produces
a handbook that helps orient international
undergraduates to life in the U.S.. Its Interna
tional Wee" — which targets the entire student
body — is a celebration of the campus's cultur
al diversity.
KZSU $47,105.00
(B 53.41)
• YES NO
KZSU, Stanford's radio station, has had
some rough times after losing its special fee
last year It has spent nearly half of its reserve
funds and reduced capital expenditures by
almost 90 percent Another year without spe
cial-fee funding would likely leave the station
unable to stay afloat
But this financial dry spell has taught KZSU
some valuable lessons. It has increased the
amount of income they receive through under
writing — donations from local businesses in
exchange for an on-air mention. Furthermore
KZSU learned an important lesson by losing its
fee; it's asking for $37,000 less from the stu

dent body than it did last year
Although the number of loyal KZSU listeners
is not very big, the radio station nonetheless
provides valuable sen/ices to the Stanford com
munity. It broadcasts coverage of most major
sports and provides DJ training for those inter
ested in broadcasting. Perhaps most important,
the station will broadcast emergency informa
tion during an earthquake or other crisis.
Masque $14,286.00
(UO $2.18)
(DYES ONO
Masque, which bills itself as "an art and lit
erary journal of queer expression," hit campus
last quarter and has been produced with a pro
fessional quality largely unseen in other cam
pus publications. While it certainly deserves
special-fee funding to help it get started, its pro
fessional appearance should enable it to solicit
a good deal of advertisement revenue and
allow it ultimately to become self-sustaining.
It is curious, though, that Masque has elect
ed to apply for a special fee from undergradu
ates only. Graduate students comprise a signif
icant portion of its core staff are free to submit
work for publication and, most important can be
just as important a part of its readership as
undergraduates. Still, Masque's fee request
should not fail simply because it made an ill
considered decision on which community to
apply to.
MEChA $28,002.81
(UO $4.28)
®YES ONO
The work of MEChA benefits more than the
just the people on its membership roster. The
organization serves as a resource for Stan
ford's sizable Chicano / Latino community and
organizes cultural and educational events tar
geting the entire campus community such as its
Cesar Chavez commemoration, Cinco de Mayo
celebration and El Dia de Los Muertos.
MEChA's special fee will also help fund the
six groups under its umbrella, including
Mujeres at Stanford, a women's support group,
and Derechos, a pre law group.
The group also sponsors Raza Day Confer
ence, which provides hundreds of high school
students from around the Bay Area with expo
sure to Chicano and Latino culture.
The Mind's Eye $13,132.00
(UO $2.00)
(DYES ONO
The Mind's Eye, one of Stanford's few out
lets for general literary and artistic expression,
fills a huge void on campus. It publishes twice
a year and is hoping to increase the number of
copies it produces by 300.
While it is obviously difficult for a twice-year
ly literary magazine to obtain advertising it is
not impossible, and the group should attempt to
seek more revenue in that manner. Further, it
should try to seek more funding from the
English and art departments — something that
would be beneficial not just to the publication
but to those departments.
Project Motivation $8,728.00
(UO $1.33)
OYES (DNO
Project Motivation, which trios to steor
underprivileged youth toward higher education,
brings more than 1,400 high school and junior
college students to campus each year and
exposes them to college life. In sponsoring
workshops on the college admission process,
financial aid and self-esteem, Pro Mo helps
those unsure about a college education. Lead
ing those workshops provides the groups 40 or
so members with "pre-education" experience.
Still, other groups — such as various East
Palo Alto tutoring programs — do not receive a
special fee but instead pursue funding through
the Haas Center. Pro Mo should seek funds
through that avenue, as well as by working for
the Stanford Fund, a resource Pro Mo has yet
to utilize.
It's unclear how the program benefits Stan
ford students. Mentoring underprivileged
youngsters on campus can do a great deal to
boost their self-confidence, but it probably will
not have the lasting effect on them — or our
community at large — that more focused pro
grams like Barrio Assistance can.
SCBN $46,514.12
(B $3.37)
(DYES ONO
One of the purposes of the special fee is to
help fledgling organizations got off the ground,
and this is precisely what a special foe would
mean to SCBN. In the past two years, SCBN
has increased its number of on-air hours from
two to 12 daily, and it now boasts a staff of
more than 50 It has added new original pro
gramming for this year and has plans for yet
more next year. Most important to many, of
course, are the 96 different Teleflicks it shows.
Without a special fee, the station will not be
able to expand further. It does not have enough
money to buy even bare-bones audio-visual
equipment — the station has resorted to
recording over old, archived tapes for lack of
new ones. SCBN's request is large, but such a
large amount of money is needed to fund a
capital-intensive enterprise like television.
The ASSU Senate's Appropriations Com
mittee cut in half SCBN's first request, a near
doubling of last year's failed request, which
itself was a near quadrupling of the previous
year's failed request This initial request calls
into question the soundness of SCBN's man
agement; students must hope the group is
more responsible with the fee money it receives
than it was with requesting it.
Stanford $29,823.10
American Indian (UO $4.55)
Organization
(DYES ONO
SAIO does a very effective job of serving
both the 250-member Native American popula
tion on campus as well as the rest of the Stan
ford community Despite losing its special fee
last year, the group's annual event, Stanford
Powwow, still brought 35,000 people to cam
pus — 5,000 more than the previous year —
and is a valuable experience for every Stanford
student who attends. Stanford Powwow is the
largest event of its kind on the West Coast
Since losing its special-fee funding, this
organization has streamlined its budget, cutting
more than $6,000 from its request by cutting
programs and spinning off ancillary organiza
tions like SNAGS, the Native American gradu
ate student group.
Stanford $10,533.45
Axe Committee (U051.61)
• YES NO
An organization like the Axe Committee,

devoted solely to building school spirit, is pre
cisely the type of organization that should be
supported by students through the special fees.
The group puts on the annual Big Game Rally,
creates a handbook on Stanford traditions for
freshmen and runs an annual Frisbee golf tour
nament. It is also charged with protecting the
Axe when it resides, as it does now, at Stanford.
According to the group's leaders, a Big Game
Bonfire — the traditional focus of the Big Game
Rally that has been banned over environmental
concerns — has a real chance of becoming a
reality next year. If it does, we'll surely need an
active and well-funded Axe Committee to plan
that celebration of the 100 th Big Game.
Stanford Band $57,967.00
(LSJUMB) (UO $8.85)
CD YES ONO
From impromptu rallies to finely orchestrat
ed halftime shows, the Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band provides
music and mirth to an often humdrum campus.
The Band only receives Athletics Department
funding to cover travel expenses; accordingly, it
depends on special-fee funds for its survival.
The fee request is increasing by about $4,000
this year because the Band's membership has
increased by almost 70 people.
Although the Band only has four graduate
student members, it still provides entertainment
to the whole campus and really ought to be
applying to both populations. Nevertheless, the
Band wholeheartedly deserves its special fee.
After all, where would we be without the Tree,
the dollies and "All Right Now"?
Stanford Chaparral $16,087.00
(UO $2.46)
(DYES ONO
The Chappie, with its irreverent brand of
often-esoteric humor, may not always bend you
over in laughter, but it will surely allow you to
"get a different perspective on things." A Univer
sity institution since 1899, the Chappie plans to
expand it c . operations next year by printing six
issues — only four were printed this year — to
be delivered to all undergraduate residences.
The cost of printing the additional issues
will, for the most part, be passed on to under
graduates in the form of a sizable special fee —
the Chappie's request is almost twice last
year's. Rather than relying on the special fee,
the Chappie should work to increase its adver
tising revenue. Staff members do work for the
Stanford Fund, but additional fund raising
and thus a smaller special fee — might make
the humor a little easier to swallow.
Stanford Climbing Wall
$30,219.78/$60,439.56
(B $2.19/$4.38)
OYES <S)NO
The Stanford Climbing Wall is a group that
organized this year to build an on-campus
climbing wall for both recreational and compet
itive climbers. That the group has gotten as far
as it has — the Athletics Department has com
mitted space for the wall — is the result of the
combined efforts of the instructors of a Stanford
wilderness-skills class and members of the
Redwood outdoors club. Construction of the
wall would bo funded with the special fee.
The group applied for a $60,000 foe, but tho
ASSU Senate, arguing that tho Athlotics Depart
ment should foot half the bill, split the request
and put half of it — $30,000 — on the ballot. The
group's members filed petitions to get tho other
half put on the ballot, and, accordingly, studonts
will vote on two separate fees of $30,000 total
ing the original request of $60,000.
The group, representatives of which
declined to moot with tho Editorial Board,
claims that other major universities have climb
ing walls and that Stanford students interested
in tho sport are forced to travel to expensive
gyms in San Francisco or San Jose. But no evi
dence has been presonted showing that stu
dents truly want what amounts to an expensive
jungle gym. There are a lot of other fun things
Stanford doesn't have, and that's not a good
enough reason to ask for even $30,000.
Stanford $6,809.00
Community (U051.04)
Carnival
OYES (DNO
The Stanford Community Carnival provides
more than 1,000 elementary school studonts
with a free day of games, food and fun It also
serves as a forum for cultural awareness and
performance Although it's goals of creating a
community-sorvice environment in which Stan
ford students are able to contribute are well
meaning, there is no clear reason why studonts
should foot the bill through a special fee
Previously tho group was self-sustaining,
relying on its own fund raising and on dorm
donations to produce the event. The leaders of
the Community Carnival plan to expand the
event with special-foe money; they should work
to accomplish that admirable goal by further
tapping their traditional sources of revenue.
Stanford $61,816.00
Concert Network (B $4.48)
(DYES ONO
The Stanford Concert Network has provided
a groat oxample of how groups should respond
to a failed special-fee request Last year, the
Concert Network had poor programming, an
exorbitant budget and few plans to improve its
condition Its fee did not pass This year, the
group has proven it's in a better groove
Having already brought Cake and recent
Grammy-winner Beck to campus, tho Concert
Network is now working on two big programs
for this quarter — one is a much-improved Rm
cadelt line-up of Bay Area bands. Also, under
its new leadership, the Concert Network has
connected with radio stations to do off-campus
promoting, which increases ticket sales and
might ensure Stanford a more securo spot on
tour venues. And it has also put on several freo
on-campus concerts so far this year.
If its fee request fails again this year, the
Concert Network will no longer be able to oper
ate effectively, robbing Stanford of a revitalized
and qualified concert promoter.
Stanford Film $26,145.00
Society (UO $3.99)
OYES • NO
The Stanford Film Society is in its second
year of existence and still has much to learn
about providing appropriate value for the student
buck The society, representatives of which
declined to meet with the Editorial Board, has
doubled its budget since last year and, in its most
egregious feature, plans to spend part of its bud
get sending its own members to the Sundance
Film Festival in Utah More attention should be
paid to on-campus organizing before looking
beyond Campus Drive, let alone the state line

Stanford $8,521.00
Gospel Choir (UO $1.30)
OYES (§)NO
The Stanford Gospel Choir, according to
its statement in the ASSU Elections Hand
book, speaks of the group's "purpose of min
istry" and its "responsibility to try to represent
God." Regardless of the group's musical abil
ities or number of performances annually, it is
simply inappropriate to ask the student body
of a non-denominational institution to fund
such a clearly religious organization Repre
sentatives of the group declined to meet with
the Editorial Board.
Stanford $4,702.00
Homelessness (UO $.72)
Action Coalition
•YES UNO
SHAC is dedicated to ending homeless
ness through advocacy, education and orga
nizing. It's a noble cause, and the group's
efforts will inevitably improve the community
around us. While SHAC should look to the
Stanford Fund and the Urban Studies Pro
gram as possible other sources of funds, it
provides real value to Stanford at a minimal
charge to students.
SHAC's efforts to improve our society in no
way affect undergraduates more than graduate
students. Thus it seems illogical for the group,
representatives of which declined to meet with
the Editorial Board, to be applying to under
graduates only, particularly in light of its suc
cessful application last year for a fee from the
entire student body.
Stanford $27,943.48
in Government (UO $4.27)
(DYES ONO
For students looking to work in public policy
fields, SIG provides a number of valuable
resources. It offers a total of 26 public service
fellowships in Sacramento, Washington, and
elsewhere — all of which are funded with alum
ni donations. Closer to home, SIG sponsors a
public-policy forum which brings prominent pol
icymakers to Stanford to discuss issues rang
ing from gun rights to women's voting.
SIG, which raises more than $40,000 in out
side fundraising and donations, will offer all
these programs next year, even with a smaller
request than in the past.
Stanford Jazz $21,978.00
Orchestra (UO $3.36)
<S>YES ONO
The Jazz Orchestra is a valuable cultural
resource, as important to Stanford as the
Speakers Bureau and the Concert Network. It's
made up of two components: jazz education
performances by top artists and a collection of
Big Band-stylo student ensembles. This group
does heavy fund raising (nearly $13,000) but its
ticket sales hovor at about $2,500 and should
bo increased to meet this year's special-fee
increase of over $10,000.
The Jazz Orchestra, representatives of
which declined to meet with the Editorial
Board, is an important cultural resource for
Stanford's campus and, accordingly, ought to
be funded by the entire student body, not only
the undergraduate population as it has
roquested.
Stanford Project $5,082.00
on Nutrition (UO $.78)
®YES ONO
Spoon works with Dining Services to collect
unused food from dorms, Row houses and
Tresidder Union and then transports it to local
food pantries. Aside from providing thousands
of meals to the Bay Area's poor, Spoon is also
a model for other food salvaging programs
nationwide.
Althougti their request is relatively small,
Spoon members should try to do more inde
pendent fund raising. Also, oven though
Spoon's 80 members are mainly undergradu
ates, the service it provides to the entire com
munity should warrant a special-fee application
to both the undergraduate and graduate stu
dent communities.
Stanford Solar $29,670.00
Car Project (UO $4.53)
(•>YES ONO
Studonts involved in tlio Stanford Solar
Car Project competo every year at several
international competitions against bettor
funded college and corporate opponents and,
dospite the financial mismatch, consistently
place at or near the top of their field. The
group's purpose is not just to race but also to
build environrriont-friondly technologies that
will improvo future transportation methods.
Boyond that, the mernbors perform educa
tional outreach to local olernentary and sec
ondary schools.
Tho group raises an impressive $500,000 in
in-kind donations and more than $50,000 in
cash donations.
Stanford $21,700.00
Women's Coalition (UO $3.31)
• YES - NO
In ttie last year, the University has
assumed financial responsibility for the
Women's Center and the Graduate Women's
Network has been spun off as an independent
organization. It is thus curious that the
Women's Coalition is requesting a fee $4 000
larger than it did last year
Still, the Women's Coalilion an umbrella
organization providing funds to almost 20
women's groups directly serves 50 percent
of tho Stanford community and offers supple
mentary programming for the other half such as
Men in Solidarity, a new program this year
Students for $7,248.00
Environmental (UOS1.11)
Action at Stanford
• YES NO
SEAS, Stanford's environmental-awareness
group, coordinates traditional environmental
campaigns such as recycling, conservation and
the upcoming Earth Week by utilizing
resources including a dorm-based system of
environmental representatives This year's
budget includes an increase in programming
but a negligible rise in cost to students One
third of SEAS' total expenditures is paid for by
outside fundraising
Although SEAS gives students their
money's worth, it would be nice to see less
focus on international affairs and more empha
sis on environmental problems affecting Stan
ford and the surrounding area Furthermore, a
cleaner and healthier environment benefits all
students; there is no reason only undergradu
ates should be footing this bill
