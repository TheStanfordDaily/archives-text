## Netters light up desert, greet Cal 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
It was to be a hot and compet
itive weekend for the Stanford
men's tennis team Friday and
Saturday when it headed down
to play Arizona and Arizona
State.
But the Card, currently
ranked seventh in the nation,
appeared cool and calm in the
desert, ousting the Wildcats 7-0
and Sun Devils 6-1.
Such a showing is even more
impressive as the Card appeared
invincible without the aid of
their All-American junior Paul
Goldstein, who is currently
ranked seventh in the nation but
is sidelined with a foot injury.
"Everyone is playing well to
the challenge of having Paul
out," said head coach Dick
Gould. "They have really
stepped it up."
The Card's depth has been
exemplified in particular by
juniors Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek, who were a com
bined 4-0 on the weekend
against the Sun Devils and Wild
cats. *
"Both Misha in doubles and
Charles in the singles had great
weekends," Gould said.
On Friday, Stanford cruised
to a 6-1 victory over Arizona
State. Most impressive was the
squad's doubles play, as it swept
through all three matches.
Freshmen Bob and Mike Bryan
took out Arizona State's Ed
Carter and Sergio Elias 8-5,
while fellow freshmen Geoff
Abrams and senior Grant Elliott
disposed of Alex Osterrieth and
Casey Was 8-4.
Rounding out the doubles for
the Card were sophomore Ail-
American Ryan Wolters and
Palecek, who squeaked past Tim
Hammond and Gustavo Marcac
cio 9-7.
"I was really happy with our
doubles play this weekend,"
Gould said. "Last time against
the Arizona schools, we dropped
three doubles matches. This
time we really answered the
challenge."
Stanford had success in the
singles as well, particularly at
the No. 1 position, where 18th
ranked Wolters crushed Elias 6-
1, 6-1, increasing his dual record
to an impressive 16-2.
"Ryan is playing better and
better with every match," Gould
