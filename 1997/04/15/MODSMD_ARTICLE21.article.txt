## Netters light up desert, greet Cal 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
It was to be a hot and compet
itive weekend for the Stanford
men's tennis team Friday and
Saturday when it headed down
to play Arizona and Arizona
State.
But the Card, currently
ranked seventh in the nation,
appeared cool and calm in the
desert, ousting the Wildcats 7-0
and Sun Devils 6-1.
Such a showing is even more
impressive as the Card appeared
invincible without the aid of
their All-American junior Paul
Goldstein, who is currently
ranked seventh in the nation but
is sidelined with a foot injury.
"Everyone is playing well to
the challenge of having Paul
out," said head coach Dick
Gould. "They have really
stepped it up."
The Card's depth has been
exemplified in particular by
juniors Charles Hoeveler and
Misha Palecek, who were a com
bined 4-0 on the weekend
against the Sun Devils and Wild
cats. *
"Both Misha in doubles and
Charles in the singles had great
weekends," Gould said.
On Friday, Stanford cruised
to a 6-1 victory over Arizona
State. Most impressive was the
squad's doubles play, as it swept
through all three matches.
Freshmen Bob and Mike Bryan
took out Arizona State's Ed
Carter and Sergio Elias 8-5,
while fellow freshmen Geoff
Abrams and senior Grant Elliott
disposed of Alex Osterrieth and
Casey Was 8-4.
Rounding out the doubles for
the Card were sophomore Ail-
American Ryan Wolters and
Palecek, who squeaked past Tim
Hammond and Gustavo Marcac
cio 9-7.
"I was really happy with our
doubles play this weekend,"
Gould said. "Last time against
the Arizona schools, we dropped
three doubles matches. This
time we really answered the
challenge."
Stanford had success in the
singles as well, particularly at
the No. 1 position, where 18th
ranked Wolters crushed Elias 6-
1, 6-1, increasing his dual record
to an impressive 16-2.
"Ryan is playing better and
better with every match," Gould

said. "His serve is really picking
up as well."
At the No. 2 and 3 singles
positions, Bob and Mike Bryan
had little trouble with Arizona
State's Osterrieth and Marcac
cio, respectively, as both broth
ers claimed victories in straight
sets.
Stanford's only loss of the
day came at the No. 4 singles
position, when Arizona State's
Carter pulled out a three-set
win over Abrams 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
Rounding out the lineup at
the five and six positions, Elliott
cruised past Hammond 6-3, 6-3,
while Hoeveler pulled out a
three set win, outplaying Ari
zona State's Was 6-3, 5-7, 7-6.
Stanford's dominance contin
ued Saturday when it took on
Arizona. Once again, the Cardi
nal's doubles play was spectacu
lar, as the squad trounced the
Wildcats across the board.
The Bryans cruised past Tom
Haugland and Roland Kupka 8-
2. Abrams and Elliott were
again impressive at the No. 2
position when they crushed
Mike Mackay and Jerome Oli
vari 8-1. Wolters and Palecek,
the Card's newest doubles team
since Goldstein's injury,
appeared polished as they
knocked off Boris Polo and
Charlie Bachtell 8-3.
Stanford came out strong in
the singles as well, sweeping
Arizona again. Wolters cruised
past Haugland 6-2, 6-4, while
Bob Brvan took out Kupka 6-4,
6-0.
Mike Bryan and Abrams also
won easily in straight sets,
defeating Olivari and Mackay by
scores of 6-1, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-3,
respectively.
Elliott pulled out a victory in
the only three-set match of the
day, when he dispatched of
Bachtell 6-0, 4-6, 6-1. Hoeveler
soundly defeated Polo 6-2, 6-2.
The Card has little time to
rest on the laurels of its splendid
road trip, as the team takes on
California today at 1:30 p.m. in
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
In early play against Arizona
and Arizona State, Cal took the
Sun Devils 4-3 but lost to Ari
zona 4-3. Earlier in the season,
Stanford rolled over the Weenies
at Cal, crushing them in the sin
gles and taking the doubles point
with two doubles wins.
"We need to play well to beat
Cal," Gould said. "They will
come out smoking for us, so we
need to be prepared and focus
on this before we think ahead to
the weekend."
It will be difficult for the
Card not to look ahead to the
weekend, when Stanford takes
on 13th-ranked USC Friday and
top-ranked UCLA Saturday at
home.
