# Fourth is small consolation for water polo at MPSFs
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water polo team was
not able to muscle its way through to the final
this weekend and finished a disappointing
fourth in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion championship.

"Overall, playing-wise we did everything
right, hut we just did not put our shots away,"
said head coach Hen Quittner.
The Cardinal's run toward the title ended in
the semifinals with a 5-4 loss to nemesis Califor
nia. The squad had gone undefeated in prelimi
nary-round play to get to this point by beating
USC 8-4, Pacific 16-3 and San
Diego State 6-4. Because of its
semifinal loss, the Card faced San
Diego State in the consolation
final, losing a double-overtime
heartbreaker 8-7.
The loss to Cal came a little
more than a week after Stanford
beat the Golden Bears 5-4 in
deGuerre Pool. At the outset,
the team's play was a little too
rough for the Southern Califor
nia referees, who called three
four-meter penalty shots against
the Card in the first period
alone. Cal converted two of these
and led at the half 2-1.

Stanford trailed the entire
game until the beginning of the
fourth quarter, when freshman
hole-set Ellen Estes tied the
game at 4-4. But during a six-on
five situation, Stanford sopho
more Nicole Glazer was kicked
out with a penalty, and the Gold
en Bears scored once more with
1 minute, 18 seconds left on the
clock to put Stanford away for
good.
"We played well, but we need
to score more," Quittner said.
"We have a tough time scoring
against Cal because they play
very physical."
In the other semifinal, top
ranked UCLA defeated San
Diego State. As for Stanford, the
Cardinal had defeated a much
improved Aztecs team earlier in

the tournament 6-4, a victory
sparked by freshman Suze Gard
ner's hat trick. The opening
round game was much closer
than the three meetings of the
teams earlier in the season,
when the Cardinal won by at
least six goals each time. But
Stanford could not repeat such
success in the finals of the con
solation bracket.
"It is always tough against
SDSU," Quittner said. "They
have a lot of good shooters."
In double overtime San Diego
pulled off the upset against
Stanford, beating the Cardinal
8-7. The game was tied at 6-6
after the third quarter, and
when both teams failed to score
in the fourth, it went into over
time.

The Cardinal took the lead
early in the first overtime on an
outside shot by sophomore
Rachel Best. But when senior co
captain Alice Cathcart was
kicked out because of a foul, the
Aztecs tied the game. With the
score knotted at seven apiece
just before the second overtime,
Cathcart was again whistled for
a foul and was ejected.
With 1:37 left in the second
overtime San Diego State found
the back of the net for the game
winner.
"Overall in the tournament
we gave a fantastic effort," Quit
tner said. "We played very, very
hard. This is a very young team,
and they are getting tired
because it is a very, very long
season."
