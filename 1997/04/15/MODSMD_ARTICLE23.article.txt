# Women's polo falls in semifinals
## Christy wins award, men lose in first round of nationals 
### Erin Reilly Staff writer 
A week in Texas was worth it —
one Stanford polo player earned an
All-American All-Star status and
two earned All-Western All-Star
status at nationals held in Fort
Worth, Texas, last week.
Senior Ilia Christy was named
to the All-American squad, which
includes only the top four players
in the nation. Christy was named
to the All-Western All-Star team as
well and bestowed the highest
intercollegiate honor — the Connie
Upchurch Memorial Sportsman
ship Award, given to the best all
around athlete regardless of gen
der on the collegiate circuit. Con
sidered in the selection process in
addition to skill is a rider's involve
ment in his organization.
Christy's younger sister, Alexa,
was also named to the eight-person
All-Western squad, along with
senior Jason Knight on the men's
team. The Western squad takes
the top eight players in the region.
Coach Wes Linfoot indicated
that he was thrilled to have both
teams at nationals.
"It is very rare to have two
teams represented. The only other
teams to have both men and
women were Cornell and Universi
ty of Virginia — the powerhouses
of the East," he said.
In actual play, Stanford men

lost in the first round against Col
orado State 20-16. It may have
been more fair had the men not
gone straight from the airplane to
the polo field, but the budget trav
el arrangements were not accom
modating to a leisurely schedule.
"We outplayed them but fell
short on penalty shots," Lin foot
said. "But I am really proud
because we have really come a long
way since last year."
The Rams went on to lose to
Texas A&M — the team that even
tually took the national title.
Knight scored nine goals, while fel
low seniors JefT Heeder and Adam
Strom took four and three goals,
respectively.
"I blame myself," Knight said.
"We could've made it."
The women's team beat the No.
4 Aggies in the first round 16-14. It
was sweet victory for the fifth
ranked women after tying them
earlier in the season. It is the first
time a Cardinal polo team
advanced to the semifinals at
nationals. Ilia Christy scored seven
goals, senior Courtney Riggle
scored five goals and Alexa Christy
contributed four scores.
"It was a good close game. We
didn't play our best but we played
well," Alexa Christy said.
The Cardinal riders lost to No. 1
Cornell in the semifinals 18-12,
but Alexa Christy said it was the
best the team played all year. They

won the first and last chukkers but
lost the game in the middle with
the Hig Red gaining points on
fouls
"We had some horse prob
lems," Alexa Christy said. Ilia
Christy and Riggle, as well as
alternate sophomore Andrea
Avtjoglou, fell off their horses dur
ing the game. Riggle's fall was
feared to be a back injury, so
Avtjoglou played the last two min
utes. The same horse was respon
sible for both falls and subse
quently removed from play.
"It was frustrating but I was
more annoyed the (emergency
medical technician) made me come
out of the game," Riggle said. The
injury was a bruise and not seri
ous.
Cornell went on to lose to
defending national champion Con
necticut. Against the Big Red, Ilia
Christy scored 11 goals and Riggle
scored one.
Stanford closes its season with
players who had never played
polo prior to college. Every other
team in the nation has players
coming from extended polo back
grounds. The Cardinal is consid
ered an up-and-coming challenge
to the teams traditionally domi
nant in collegiate polo, primarily
the East Coast teams, who boast
strong traditions of arena polo
and endowments which pay the
team expenses.
