# Regular season comes to an end
## UOP hosts spikers 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Coming into tonight's match
at Pacific, the regular-season
finale for the squad, the No. 3
Stanford men's volleyball team
has a lot of momentum on its
side.
Riding an impressive 11-
match winning streak, including
convincing wins against top-10
opponents Pepperdine and
Hawaii, the Cardinal (21-3, 15-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) appears hungry to begin
the postseason. While it should
be very confident, the team must
be wary not to overlook the
Tigers.
No. 11 Pacific comes into the
match riding a three-game win
streak and is literally playing for
its life. The Tigers (16-9, 9-9) are
tied with USC for fourth place in
the Pacific Division of the
MPSF. If they win, they are
guaranteed a slot in the eight
team tournament regardless of
what USC does, due to a
stronger record within the divi
sion. However, if Stanford wins
and USC also wins, UOP's sea
son will be over.
"Pacific is playing to extend
its season," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "If they win, (hey
know that they are in. I expect
that they will play really hard."
In addition to this, 'nothcr
compelling fact about the Tigers
is that the team has only been
competing at the varsity level for
the past live years. Since then,
Pacific's volleyball ability has
experienced a meteoric rise from
cellar dweller in the early years
to one of the top teams in the
country.
The Tigers' rise to power is
reflected in the team's top play
er, 6-foot-7 senior outside hitter
Greg Wakeham, who has
improved right along with the
team. Like the Tigers, Wakeham
is a real force to be reckoned
with. An Ail-American last year,
he led the MPSF in kills per
game with 7.79. This year he has
picked up right where he left off
and is coming off a big match
against UC-San Diego in which
he recorded 41 kills.
"Wakeham's a really strong
attacker," said Nieves earlier in
the season. "He really hurt us
badly last year when they came

to liurnham and beat us. He had
40 kills in the match and really
dominated. We need to come up
with and then execute a blocking
scheme to contain him."
In the past Wakeham has
been its lone weapon, but this
year Pacific has three other top
players. First among these is
freshman outside hitter
Vladimir Andric. The 6-8 Croat
ian was one of the top five
recruits in the nation last year
and has proved he is worthy of
all these accolades this year.
Currently, Andric is second on
the team in kills per game with
3.77 and third in hitting at .315.
More important, he has helped
to take a lot of the offensive load
off Wakeham.
"Andric is the most heralded
recruit Pacific has ever landed,"

Pacific is playing to
extend its season.
If they win, they know
that they are in.'

senior outside hitter Sam
Crosson and 6-2 sophomore set

propel the Tigers past the Cardi
nal.
The composition of the two
teams, along with Pacific's need
to win the match, makes for
what should be some of the most
competitive matchups Stanford
has faced this year.
Wakeham, UOP's top player,
will face off against Stanford
senior outside hitter Mike Lam
bert, the Cardinal's top talent.
Crosson, the Tigers' other pre
mier senior outside hitter, will
face Matt Fucrbringer, also a
senior outside hitter. Andric will
face Andy Witt, the best recruit
in the land last year, and, like
Andric, an outside hitter. Final

Pacific and senior Stewart
Chong for the Card, both hail
