# Regular season comes to an end
## UOP hosts spikers 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Coming into tonight's match
at Pacific, the regular-season
finale for the squad, the No. 3
Stanford men's volleyball team
has a lot of momentum on its
side.
Riding an impressive 11-
match winning streak, including
convincing wins against top-10
opponents Pepperdine and
Hawaii, the Cardinal (21-3, 15-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) appears hungry to begin
the postseason. While it should
be very confident, the team must
be wary not to overlook the
Tigers.
No. 11 Pacific comes into the
match riding a three-game win
streak and is literally playing for
its life. The Tigers (16-9, 9-9) are
tied with USC for fourth place in
the Pacific Division of the
MPSF. If they win, they are
guaranteed a slot in the eight
team tournament regardless of
what USC does, due to a
stronger record within the divi
sion. However, if Stanford wins
and USC also wins, UOP's sea
son will be over.
"Pacific is playing to extend
its season," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "If they win, (hey
know that they are in. I expect
that they will play really hard."
In addition to this, 'nothcr
compelling fact about the Tigers
is that the team has only been
competing at the varsity level for
the past live years. Since then,
Pacific's volleyball ability has
experienced a meteoric rise from
cellar dweller in the early years
to one of the top teams in the
country.
The Tigers' rise to power is
reflected in the team's top play
er, 6-foot-7 senior outside hitter
Greg Wakeham, who has
improved right along with the
team. Like the Tigers, Wakeham
is a real force to be reckoned
with. An Ail-American last year,
he led the MPSF in kills per
game with 7.79. This year he has
picked up right where he left off
and is coming off a big match
against UC-San Diego in which
he recorded 41 kills.
"Wakeham's a really strong
attacker," said Nieves earlier in
the season. "He really hurt us
badly last year when they came

to liurnham and beat us. He had
40 kills in the match and really
dominated. We need to come up
with and then execute a blocking
scheme to contain him."
In the past Wakeham has
been its lone weapon, but this
year Pacific has three other top
players. First among these is
freshman outside hitter
Vladimir Andric. The 6-8 Croat
ian was one of the top five
recruits in the nation last year
and has proved he is worthy of
all these accolades this year.
Currently, Andric is second on
the team in kills per game with
3.77 and third in hitting at .315.
More important, he has helped
to take a lot of the offensive load
off Wakeham.
"Andric is the most heralded
recruit Pacific has ever landed,"

Pacific is playing to
extend its season.
If they win, they know
that they are in.'
— Ruben Nieves

Nieves said. "By signing him last
year, they became a major player
in the recruit in h ...... .ic ». ...
good as any freshman in the
country, and we have a pretty
food on'• • '
111 aUUlliOll i w . Vl.al IC, x
senior outside hitter Sam
Crosson and 6-2 sophomore set
ter KeAlli Alexander will look to
propel the Tigers past the Cardi
nal.
The composition of the two
teams, along with Pacific's need
to win the match, makes for
what should be some of the most
competitive matchups Stanford
has faced this year.
Wakeham, UOP's top player,
will face off against Stanford
senior outside hitter Mike Lam
bert, the Cardinal's top talent.
Crosson, the Tigers' other pre
mier senior outside hitter, will
face Matt Fucrbringer, also a
senior outside hitter. Andric will
face Andy Witt, the best recruit
in the land last year, and, like
Andric, an outside hitter. Final
ly, the two setters, Alexander for
Pacific and senior Stewart
Chong for the Card, both hail
from Hawaii and faced off often
as they grew up.
Stanford won the matchups
with UOP's top players in the
first match with the Tigers at
Burnham Pavilion, a 15-9, 15-10,
16-14 Stanford victory Feb. 21.
The Cardinal smothered Wake
ham and Andric with stifling
defense. The result was that
Wakeham hit minus-.065 and
Andric minus-.056 for the match.
Although the Tigers are very
good at the setter and outside
hitter positions, they appear to
lack the power at the middle
blocker positions that senior
Mike Hoefer and junior Keenan
Whitehurst provide the Cardi
nal. If Stanford's middles con
tinue to play as well as they have
been performing and like they
did in the first matchup between
the two schools, the Card's
prospects for a victory should be
good.
"We do seem to have the
advantage in the middle," Nieves
said. "Even though our guys are

better on paper, that doesn't
mean all that much. When they
beat us last year, we got badly
outplayed in the middle bv two
players who were not supposed
to be very strong. This year we
have to be strong in the middle
to win."
In addition, Stanford will
need a stronger offensive match
than it did in the teams' first
meeting, where Stanford hit a
low .258. Although the Card
managed to get a win by limiting
Pacific to .080, the season's best
effort, the team cannot expect to
win two matches against such a
talented squad with a weak
offense.
The match against a very tal
ented team in a must-win situa
tion should be a very good (une
up for Stanford as it heads into
the MPSF tournament. In the
tourney, Stanford will be facing
a team which will give every
thing to prolong the season.
MPSF quarterfinal action
begins Saturday at the schools
with the better seed. Stanford
will host the fourth-place team
from the Mountain Division at
Burnham Pavilion, and the win
ner advances to the semifinals
April 24.
