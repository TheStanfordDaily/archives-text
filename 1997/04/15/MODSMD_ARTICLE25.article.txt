A chance to got back on track. A chance to gain
momentnin entering the biggest series of the year.
A chance to show why they are considered one of
the best ballcluhs in the nation.
Tonight at 7 at Sunken Diamond, the No. 5
Stanford baseball team hosts the San Jose State
Spartans. This game will be no Cakewalk, however,
as the Spartans CM)-14, 15-6 Western Athletic
Conference) are atop the WAC, a conference also
housing No. 22 Fresno State.
The Card (27-11, 13-5 Pacific 10 Conference

Southern Division) is looking to head in the right
direction after losing all three games against Ari
zona State at home this weekend. In an uncharac
teristically poor performance, Stanford's lead in
the Six-Pac slipped from \/2 games to just one
game.
"A win lagainst the Spartans| gets us back on
track and helps to put the ASIJ series behind us,"
said senior left fielder Chris Clark.
It takes more than a few games, however, to
ruin the spirits of the ballcluh.
"Wo control our own destiny," Clark said. "We

have great team chemistry, so
bumps along the way are not
going to sidetrack us as a unit.
We know that if we play our
game, we can beat anybody.
Coach Marquess always tells us
to play like champions, and thet
is the motto we try to uphold as
a team, win or lose."
After a tough weekend, many
teams would be ready to make
changes to try to remedy a prob
lem. But the Cardinal is not
ready to make any drastic
changes yet.
"There is no point in chang
ing something after we've had
such success," said freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth.
"We had a couple off games, but
we don't need to totally
revamp."
While it is fun to play riding a
long win streak and creaming
the opponents, the Card realizes
no team can do that forever.
"Every team faces adversity
at some point in the season,"
Clark said. "It is how you
respond that counts."

There is no point in
changing something
after we've had such
success We don't
need to totally revamp.'

Although no drastic changes
will be made, hopefully the
offense will be able to change
something from its recent poor
performance. The Card pro
duced only 11 runs all weekend
against Arizona State, after
scoring 29 against USC, 25
against Arizona and 42 against
California in the previous three
series.
All nine starters, however,
are still hitting better than .300.
Muth leads the starters in hit
ting with a .424 average, and
sophomore center fielder Jody
Gerut has contributed a team
leading 48 RBIs. Sophomore
third baseman Josh Hochgesang
is also riding a career-high 18-
game hitting streak, dating back
to March 2.
San Jose State will challenge
Stanford with solid hitting and
pitching. The Spartans have a
.304 team batting average and
have posted an impressive 3.65
ERA.
Leading the Spartan offen
sive attack is senior first base
man Robert Berns, batting .410
with 52 runs scored, 49 RBIs
and 24 doubles. Outfielder Scott
Lewis is batting .357 for San
Jose State.
