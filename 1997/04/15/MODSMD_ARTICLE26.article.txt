# Crew beats weather, Cougars in Washington
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
Despite the extremely windy
and cold conditions at the Snake
River in Pullman, Wash., this
weekend, the Cardinal crews fared
well in all divisions with many
solid performances.
"It was pretty hilarious condi
tions out there; we felt like a
hunch of pirates blasting through
huge waves," said varsity men's
captain Mark Thomas, a senior,
after a commanding win over
Washington State. "I'm a white
water kayaker, and I was relying
on my kayaking skills more than
my rowing skills to survive today."
The varsity men added two
more victories to their win col
umn, improving their Pacific 10
Conference dual-meet record to 5-
0. The win over Gonzaga was
especially meaningful to the team
because it finished in a dead heat
the last time it raced in Pullman
two years ago.
"It was pretty satisfying to
have a decisive victory this time,"
Thomas said.
Also satisfied with the varsity
men's showing was head coach
Wieslaw Kujda.
"Finally the varsity boat is
looking like a varsity boat with a
good lineup of Mark Thomas'
power and leadership in the mid
dle |the engine room] of the boat,"
Kujda said.
The junior varsity men earned
a split this weekend, losing to
Gonzaga on the first race and
coming back strong to pull

through the Cougars with a com
manding two-boat-length margin
of victory. After the loss to the
Bulldogs, the junior varsity boat
fdled with water. However, Kujda
made a crucial tactical move
between the races, using duct tape
across the riggers of the boat to
shield the water from splashing in
and thus making the boat lighter
for the second race.
Nevertheless, Kujda still gave
the credit for the win to the JV

oarsmen's turnaround perfor
mance.
"The JV really got together and
showed their stuff on the second
race after the loss to Gonzaga," he
said.
Like the varsity, the novice
men's boat is still on a winning
streak. However, first-year novice
men's coach Josh Burgel is still
pushing his team to become faster
before Pac-lOs.
"I thought it was a pretty suc
cessful race as far as winning is
concerned, but we haven't
improved much in the last two
weeks," Burgel said. "And we need

to improve much more before
showing up in the Pac-lOs."
The women's crews matched
their male counterparts this week
end with flawless performances by
the varsity and novice boats arid
much improvement by the junior
varsity boat.
"All three boats really showed
who is toughest and who is willing
to make the best out of the situa
tion," said women's head coach
Aimee Baker, who was concerned
about the disadvantage that her
boats might have had due to the
strong headwind.
The varsity women remain per
fect this season in dual-meet com
petition, beating Gonzaga and
Washington State. The squad had
lost to the Cougars earlier in invi
tational competition, finishing
behind Washington State at the
San Diego Crew Classic.
The win over the Cougars
"means a lot to us after finishing
seventh and not making into the
grand finals in the San Diego
Crew Classic," Baker said. "It was
payback a little bit, and it allowed
the athletes to know that we could
have made it to the grand finals if
we had a better heat."
The JV women lost to the
Washington State crew but did
not go home without a fight. The
Cardinal was tied with the
Cougars at the midpoint of the
race and cut the time difference
between the two squads to four
seconds less than it had been in
their last meeting.
The novice women matched
the performance of the varsity

by walking away from the
Cougars' boat in the last 300
meters and easily defeating Gon
zaga.
"I thought we rowed really well
considering the conditions today.
The power was there all the way
as well as the intensity," said
freshman novice captain Tami St.
George. "We knew they were out
to get us in this race since we only
beat them by two seconds in San
Diego."
Women's novice coach Kristine
Franson was very pleased with the
race as well. Like Burgel, however,
her goals are set on preparation
for Pac-lOs.
"They showed a lot of heart,
went out and fought. However, I
don't necessarily think it was a
test of speed due to the conditions
given" because in choppy waters,
it is difficult to come back once a
boat is behind, Franson said.
"However, I have seen a lot of
improvement in this young team,
and I see more improvement in
the future as well."
The Stanford crews have
already begun preparing for Pac
10s.
"Now we have to start to work
them kind of hard so it makes it
tougher for the crews to win these
weekend races," Baker said. "But
it's something we have to do in
order to prepare them for the
championships."
After two long weekends on the
road, the Cardinal crew is coming
back home to Redwood Shores in
Redwood Cityto face Oregon and
Oregon State Saturday.
