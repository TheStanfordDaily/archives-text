# Hectic nine days pushes men's golf
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Anyone who thinks student
athletes should not be awarded
such large scholarships might look
at the Stanford men's golf tourna
ment schedule for last week. On
the road Saturday through Tues
day and again Thursday through
Sunday with a single day to catch
up, the squad was truly pushed to
the limit, both on and off the
course.
Nevertheless, it doesn't seem to
have affected the team's play. Fin
ishing fifth and placing one golfer
in the top three at the Cougar
Classic Tournament in Provo,
Utah, ending Saturday, the Cardi
nal golfers proved their determi
nation to carry on.
"During spring break, we spent
every daylight hour on the
course," said Dusty Brett. "Now I
think our extra practice is coming
through."
The freshman placed third at
the Cougar Classic with consis
tently solid scores of 71, 71 and 70,
totaling a 212 in three rounds of
play.
"Coming off Pasa Tiempo (in
Santa Cruz), this course in Utah
played much easier," Brett said.
"The greens were way easier —
not as fast or undulating. Howev
er, it was cold; we haven't played
in temperatures like that all year."
Approaching 25 degrees, the
course reached its coldest in the
mornings.
Senior Conrad Ray also felt the
team responded well to its hectic
schedule.
"We had a fairly good outing as
a team and a productive week — it
was a good tournament to mea
sure how we're doing," he said. "It
was good to see Dusty and Scott
Wang both playing much better."
Sophomore Wang finished 14
strokes back, with a score of 226.
"It was a big step for me," Brett
said of his finish. "It was my first

tournament where I played solid
all three rounds."
Despite Brett's and Wang's suc
cess, Stanford's top two golfers
finished lower than usual. Sopho
more Joel Kribel, who occupies the
top spot on the starting five, fin
ished eighth overall.
"Joel and I were playing off our
norm, but hopefully we can learn
from it and prepare better for next
week," Brett said.
With the U.S. Intercollegiate at
Stanford Golf Course April 25-26
as the final determinant of the
Cardinal's regional standing,
preparing for next week will be of
the essence for the team's success
this season.
"We have to keep the same seri
ousness and not lose sight of that
even though we have a two-week
break now," Brett said. "We must
stay focused on our goal for this
season, which is making it to
regionals."
Specifically, Ray noted that the
team needs to practice its short
game.
"We're going to stay focused
and work on our short game the
most," he said. "It's good to be able
to rely on a strong short game so
you can still shoot good scores
when you're not hitting as well."
And while Tiger Woods left the
program after last season, seeing
their ex-teammate breeze through
the greatest tournament in golf,
the Masters, finishing 12 strokes
ahead of everybody, was also no
small inspiration.
"We were all pumped to see
Tiger win, and it's helped us focus
on our own victory," Ray said. "We
can't ride on any one player's coat
tails anymore — it's going to be a
team effort."
The Stanford tournament will
seal the Cardinal's fate and also be
an exciting event to watch. Unlike
many other sports, the golf team
only has a couple chances a year to
play at home and receive strong
support from the Cardinal faithful.
