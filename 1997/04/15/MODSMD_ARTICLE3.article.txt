# WWW a weird wide world
## Alumnus publishes book an world's wachiest pages 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
You know these guys. You've
seen them flinging butter onto the
ceiling in the dining hall, catapult
ing fruit long distances with rubber
tubing slingshots or building high
speed potato launchers to study the
vaporization of vegetables.
Now imagine that these same
people create a World Wide Web site
dedicated to their pursuits, and you
have an idea of what Hank Duder
stadt chronicles in his new book,
"The World's Weirdest Web Pages
and the People Who Create Them."
Published by No Starch Press, a
tiny San Francisco publishing
house, the book lives up to its
grandiose title by offeringan assort
ment of the most zany, eclectic and
often seriously twisted Web sites
out there.
The author is a 1980 Stanford
grad who majored in English and
was a four-year member of the
Stanford Band; "which, if you've
seen the book, is rather appropri
ate," he said.

Duderstadt credits his Stanford
Band experience with helping de
velop his already off-beat sense of
humor. "I've always had an ability
to find the more unusual side of
things," he said,
After leaving the Farm, Duder
stadt worked for the TV show "PM
Magazine" in Des Moines, lowa,
where he did "hard-hitting inves
tigative reports on chicken-leash
laws, combine demolition derbies
and a man who bred wolves with
dogs."
With such a background, Duder
stadt was naturally drawn to the
more bizarre sites when he first
stepped onto the Internet. Duder
stadt now works as a multimedia
consultant and teacher. He met his
publisher at No Starch Press, Hill
Pollack, at the Cyber salon, a regu
larly occurring multimedia party in
San Francisco.
"Hill was talking about a book he
wanted to do about strange Web
sites and wondering who would
have a weird enough sense of
humor to write it," Duderstadt said.
"In unison, four of my friends

turned to me and .said, 'You!' "
Duderstadt's offbeat sense of
humor is evident in his book,
where he shows a fond fascination
for the strangeness of people who
immortalize their obsessions on
the Web.
Take, for example, the Naked
Llama. Under the heading "Ani
mals" (others include "Body
Parts," "Food" and "Religions") is a
listing for The Naked Dancing
Llama Homepage.The page
(http://www.execpc.com/~cfeyr
er/ndl.html) was created by Chris
Feyrer, a Web designer at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, whose stated
goals in creating his page were to
"dance, dance, dance like a llama
would dance," to provide a site un
like any other and to give some
funny udviceon how to cheer people
up. The llama, you see, answers e
mail questions.
In the same category are Chia
Pet Zoo, the Dead Cat page — which
suggests in the event of a "removed
eyeball or severed limb, simply re
turn your dead cat to our dead cat
vet for free repair" — and the Sea

Monkey Worship Page.
Hut the fun doesn't stop with
just animals. Under the subject of
food, there's the Spam Haiku
archive (http://www.naic.edu
/~jcho/spam/sha.html), where over
4,000 examples of "Spamku" are
available to ddlight the literary

palate. Reading a gem like:
A SPAM loaf quivers.
Salivary glands juice up.
Anticipation.
Makes you just want to jump in
your air and go buy a crateload of
the pink stuff, doesn't it?
More entertainment awaits
with pages like Strawberry Pop-
Tart 13lowtorches (what happens
when you tape a Pop-Tart into a
toaster and then turn it on?),
Bubba's BBQ Chip Collection and
MeatMation, which chronicles the
adventures of a cannibalistic fami
ly sculpted entirely out of ham
burger meat.
Stephanie Rose, the creator of
MeatMation, regularly appears
with Duderstadt to demonstrate
her craft.
"It's terrible, though," Duder
stadt said. "She has the hardest
time (in the Bay Area) finding ham
burger meat with enough fat in it to
sculpt with."
For those who want to interact
with their Web pages, there's Abuse-a-
Tron (http://www.xe.net/upstart/

abuse), where you click a button that
says "Heap Abuse Upon Us" and get a
response like, "You carry pieces of
garbage in your pocket for ID, you
drooling, pus-gulping, elephant-feel
ing, vacillating begetter of an incestu
ous politician."
This device would be perfect to
get for your potato-mutilating
friends — except it would give them
too many new ideas.
"I try a lot of these things at
home," Duderstadt said. "I even
beat the T.W.1.N.K.1.E. page —
their Twinkie lasted 1:20 minutes
in the microwave, but mine stayed
in for five whole minutes!"
Duderstadt interviewed most of
his subjects by e-mail. "Many of
them are graduate students, which
says something really ominous
about our graduate population," he
said.
He added, "The more you wan
der the Weird Wide Web, the more
you realize that there are a lot of
people out there with way too much
time on their hands."
Reaction to the book has been
favorable: It will be featured in
Playboy's May issue, and Duder
stadt is hoping for a second print
run after the initial printing of
7,000 copies.

Senior Aashish Didwania, a bi
ology major inclined to his own cre
ative experimentation with vegeta
bles, loved the book.
"I think it's amazing," Didwa
nia said. "You always wonder, am I
the only person who thinks these
things? I'm glad to know there are
people out there as weird as I am —
now I can just go to the Web and
look these guys up."
His friend and fellow fruit
flinger, senior Mike Hoefer, a com
puter science major, agreed.
"It's good to know that there's a
book that weeds through all the
crap on the Web and gets down to
the good stuff," Hoefer said. "The
Web can be a twisted tool."
The author agreed that the In
ternet can be corrupted but still
thinks one of the best things about
it is its accessibility.
" I was amazed at how easy it is to
make a Web page," he said. "I can't
program my way out of a paper bag
— really, anyone can learn it."
"It's getting harder and harder
to get published" in the print mar
ket, Hoefer said. "But the Web is
still wide open; anybody, no matter
how crackpot their idea, can make
a Web page — or do a book — and
put his work out there.
