You know these guys. You've
seen them flinging butter onto the
ceiling in the dining hall, catapult
ing fruit long distances with rubber
tubing slingshots or building high
speed potato launchers to study the
vaporization of vegetables.
Now imagine that these same
people create a World Wide Web site
dedicated to their pursuits, and you
have an idea of what Hank Duder
stadt chronicles in his new book,
"The World's Weirdest Web Pages
and the People Who Create Them."
Published by No Starch Press, a
tiny San Francisco publishing
house, the book lives up to its
grandiose title by offeringan assort
ment of the most zany, eclectic and
often seriously twisted Web sites
out there.
The author is a 1980 Stanford
grad who majored in English and
was a four-year member of the
Stanford Band; "which, if you've
seen the book, is rather appropri
ate," he said.

Duderstadt credits his Stanford
Band experience with helping de
velop his already off-beat sense of
humor. "I've always had an ability
to find the more unusual side of
things," he said,
After leaving the Farm, Duder
stadt worked for the TV show "PM
Magazine" in Des Moines, lowa,
where he did "hard-hitting inves
tigative reports on chicken-leash
laws, combine demolition derbies
and a man who bred wolves with
dogs."
With such a background, Duder
stadt was naturally drawn to the
more bizarre sites when he first
stepped onto the Internet. Duder
stadt now works as a multimedia
consultant and teacher. He met his
publisher at No Starch Press, Hill
Pollack, at the Cyber salon, a regu
larly occurring multimedia party in
San Francisco.
"Hill was talking about a book he
wanted to do about strange Web
sites and wondering who would
have a weird enough sense of
humor to write it," Duderstadt said.
"In unison, four of my friends

turned to me and .said, 'You!' "
Duderstadt's offbeat sense of
humor is evident in his book,
where he shows a fond fascination
for the strangeness of people who
immortalize their obsessions on
the Web.
Take, for example, the Naked
Llama. Under the heading "Ani
mals" (others include "Body
Parts," "Food" and "Religions") is a
listing for The Naked Dancing
Llama Homepage.The page
(http://www.execpc.com/~cfeyr
er/ndl.html) was created by Chris
Feyrer, a Web designer at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, whose stated
goals in creating his page were to
"dance, dance, dance like a llama
would dance," to provide a site un
like any other and to give some
funny udviceon how to cheer people
up. The llama, you see, answers e
mail questions.
In the same category are Chia
Pet Zoo, the Dead Cat page — which
suggests in the event of a "removed
eyeball or severed limb, simply re
turn your dead cat to our dead cat
vet for free repair" — and the Sea

Monkey Worship Page.
Hut the fun doesn't stop with
just animals. Under the subject of
food, there's the Spam Haiku
archive (http://www.naic.edu
/~jcho/spam/sha.html), where over
4,000 examples of "Spamku" are
available to ddlight the literary
