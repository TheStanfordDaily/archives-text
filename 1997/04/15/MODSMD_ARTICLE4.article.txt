# New draft of charter onto ballot
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
A little more than a day before the polls open for the
ASSU Spring General Election, the ASSU Senate final
ly put the proposed new Stiinford Judicial Charter on
the ballot.
In an early-evening meeting yesterday, the senate
unanimously voted to submit its own revised version of
the charter for voter approval in the two-day election
beginning tonight at midnight.
That action capped a two-week period of senate de
bate that included the formation of an ad hoc commit
tee, chaired by ASSU Senator M ichael Colon, to consid
er the proposed charter and reconcile senators' dis
agreements.
On Friday, that committee released its findings in
the form of the revised charter that will appear on the
ballot. It includes several changes from the original
charter, authored by the Committee of 15, that appears
in the Elections Handb<x>k. The revised charter may be
viewed at http://assu.stimford.tKlu.
The latest "compromise" version of the charter has
drawn praise from both the drafters of the initial docu
ment and the charter's early critics.
"I think that the core reforms are intact and that the
proposal presented to students is something that all
students should be proud of," Committee of 15 member
and ASSU Senator Howard Loo said. "This is a classic
example of compromise."
The committee's main opponents, meml)ers of the
group Students Have Rights, also gave the new version
their approval. In a written statement, group co
founder and UC-Berkeley Prof. Yale Braunstein
dropped his objections to the charter.
"This revised proposal corrects most of the flaws in
the original proposal," he wrote. "The ASSU Senate
and the Colon committee deserve everyone's thanks for
the changes they helped bring forth.
This new charter includes both the
procedural changes and rights
guarantees that are needed."
"We're ecstatic," he said in an in
terview yesterday. "Every single
issue we raised and every issue the
(Colon) committee raised was dealt
with."
Colon, a doctoral student in com
puter science, was pleased with how
well his committee worked under
time constraints. Initially, he said,
committee members formed a list of
54 complaints about the original
document. The vast majority of
those complaints — Colon esti
mates 90 percent — were quickly re
solved by his committee and the
Committee of 15.
The remaining complaints were
grouped into three main issues:
open hearings, right to cross exam
ination and right to legal counsel.
Compromises on all three are in
cluded in the new version of the
charter.
First, the Colon committee and
the Committee of 15 agreed on a
provision that would give the ac
cused the ability to choose, one
week before appearing before the
Judicial Panel, to have that hearing
open. Under the original charter,
all hearings would have been
closed.
Second, a provision allowing
written testimony — which would
have limited a defendant's ability to
cross-examine his or her accuser —
was replaced with one that would
allow the Board of Judicial Affairs,
which oversees the judicial process,
to denote "limited" evidence as per
missible in writing. Such a distinc
tion would have to be listed in the
board's bylaws, which are subject
to veto by the ASSU Senate, the
Faculty Senate or the University
president.
The third and perhaps most
contentious term of the charter
concerned legal counsel. In an ef
fort to keep hearings from being
controlled by lawyers, the original
document allowed a defendant to
have an adviser but prevented that
person from speaking on behalf of

the accused at a Judicial Panel
hearing. The new version retains
that language but adds a section
authorizing the board to pass by
laws governing counsel at hear
ings.
Braunstein was especially en
couraged by the changes in those
three areas. By allowing the board
to create bylaws that are essentially
under ASSU Senate control, the
new language "puts the burden on
students to be responsible for their
own rights," he said. "That's what
we've been saying all along."
Dean of Students Marc Wais,
who resolves most student judicial
cases under the existing system,
also favors the new charter. "I am
supportive of the new changes ar
ticulated by C-15," he said, "in that
they articulated the issues identi
fied by the ASSU, while also main
taining the new judicial process as
being student-centered and pro
moting an academic environment
noted for its integrity, respect and
trust."
If the charter passes, he said, the
University's role in the process will
become less judicial and more edu
cational. The Committee of 15 "has
created the explicit expectation
that the University increase and
enhance the educational outreach
component of the judicial process,"
he said.
Sally Cole, who served for nearly
15 years as Stanford's judicial af
fairs officer, also supports the char
ter.
"After reading with care and in
terest the proposed new charter,"
she wrote in a letter submitted to
The Daily, "I can say with confi
dence that it is a vast improvement
over the current governing docu
ment. Most importantly, the pro
posed process involves students in
the daily workings of student disci
pline."
Colon did express some concern
at the timing of the document's re
lease but stressed that the changes
between the old and new versions
are "easy to recognize."
In an effort to make up for the
late changes, ASSU President Bill
Shen plans to send out an e-mail
this morning to every Stanford stu
dent, informing them of the new
charter and urging them to look at
it themselves.
