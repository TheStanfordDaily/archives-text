### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
Ever wanted to give the
ASSU a piece of your mind?
Presidential and vice presiden
tial candidates Howard Loo
and Solomon Lefler want to en
sure that you can.
Vowing not to run on a laun-

dry list of specific issues, the duo is instead empha
sizing greater student involvement in drafting policy
and the development of a strong working relationsh ip
with the administration.
Focusing neither on major national campaigns
that "tangentially" touch the lives of students, nor
solely on "visible material services," Loo and Lefler
want students actively involved in developing propos
als to address policy issues affecting current and fu
ture students.
"I want to carry on a dialogue with students and
actively engage them in helping us solve problems,
rather than dictate policy to them, " said Loo.

Senior Howard Loo (right), who is running for president, and Solomon Lefler, who is
running for vice president, are focusing on grass-roots policy making and principled
In order to achieve this, Loo and
Lefler plan on hosting open forums
and policy debates. They are also
encouraging dormitories to write
newsletters expressing their
thoughts and concerns about
major campus issues. Finally, they
are considering replacing the dorm
representative system to the ASSU
with a system in which the ASSU,
both the executive and senate, hold
meetings in dormitories.
Along with their much-touted
"grass-roots civic involvement,"
Loo and Lefler promise to offer
"nuanced, complex and well re
searched" proposals to the admin
istration.
Noting the great potential for
the ASSU to serve as a voice for the
students, Loo bemoaned the pre
sent method of attempting to dic
tate policy to the administration.
"The antagonistic relationship
between the ASSU and the admin
istration is apparent, and we need
to try to work on it if we are going
to best serve students," Loo ex
plained.
The third principle guiding
their campaign is a promise to
choose integrity over political gain.
While Loo said that "it would have

been so much easier to run on a few
issues," he noted that they
wouldn't consider their campaign
a success "if we ran and told people
what they want to hear."
Citing that his record in the sen
ate supports his principled leader
ship, Loo noted that his adminis
tration would "avoid taking easy
stands when we know they aren't
right."
Lefler added that their cam
paign has focused on principles be
cause students are ultimately vot
ing "for human beings, and we
want students to know our val
ues."
Both emphasized that their
"45-Day Plan" was developed
based on the underlying principles
of their campaign. The "45-Day
Plan" calls for reform of the Uni
versity housing Draw, the restruc
turing of the relationship between
dorm government and the ASSU
and the creation of a World Wide
Web site that contains a compre
hensive overview of Stanford activ
ities.
Loo and Lefler indicated that
they would continue to pursue
these projects even if they were not
elected. While emphasizing that
ASSU executive position would
ease implementation of the "45-
Day Plan," Lefler stated that none
of the projects are beyond the scope
of students.

Loo and Lefler, both political
science majors, have had experi
ence with the ASSU. Prior to Loo's
two terms in the senate and
Letter's service as senate parlia
mentarian and as a member of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, both showed an interest
in the organization.
Loo added that he and at
tended almost every Senate meet
ing during 1994-95 and wittily ex
claimed, "We were there more
than the senators."
Loo and Lefler have already cre
ated a division of labor for their ad
ministration. Loo will concentrate
on seeking student opinion and
working with the administration,
while Lefler will meet with student
groups and serve as an indepen
dent arbiter in resolving conflicts
among student groups.
Loo explained the strength of
the team, noting their complemen
tary skills.
"I am good at coming up with in
novative, exciting ideas and moti
vating people; Solomon is good at
making them become a reality,"
said Loo.
Lefler concurred, indicating
that "you need someone to take
mental risks and come up with
broad visions to improve student
affairs, but you have to have real
ism and an understanding of ob
stacles and limitations."
