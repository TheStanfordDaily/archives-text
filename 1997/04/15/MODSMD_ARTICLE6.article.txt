# Decision on Gupta likely in two weeks
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A decision may be reached be
fore May 1 on Asst. Anthropolo
gy F'rof. Akhil Gupta's appeal of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences' ruling to deny his
tenure.
Meanwhile, campus and na
tionwide movements continue to
support his cause.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he is hoping for a de
cision by the end of the month on
the appeal. Before that, he
should receive a petition started
yesterday by a student move
ment in favor of Gupta's tenure.

Backers nationwide recently cre
ated a legal fund for Gupta's
case.
Shoven said lie is waiting to
hear from a grievance officer
who is investigating specific
points in Gupta's complaint.
Shoven declined to name the
grievance officer but said such a
job generally is done by current
or retired faculty members
whose knowledge of the issues
involved is widely respected.
Shoven said his own decision
would be based on whether it ap
peared there was anything irreg
ular with the process by which a
dean's committee rejected a
unanimous endorsement of Gupta
by an Anthropology Department
committee.
Shoven's final decision will most
likely contend that there was either
nothing wrong with the process or
that it was flawed and should be re
peated, rather than being a unilat
eral decision to grant Gupta
tenure.
Gupta himself had no comment
on the issue, but the student move
ment supporting him is looking for
further backing of the petition
drive that began yesterday.
Monica DeHart de Galicia, a
doctoral student in anthropology,
said the petition "incorporates all
the concerns" of student groups
such as the Tenure Akhil Gupta
Committee and faculty, both at
Stanford and elsewhere, who pub
licly have supported Gupta's
tenure.
The petition, written by DeHart
de Galicia, lists three major con

cerns. It calls Gupta "a vital mem
ber of an already understaffed An
thropology Department," saying
his continuing participation in the
new Program in Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity is
"imperative to the project's feasi
bility and ultimate prosperity."
It also says that as a South Asian
scholar, Gupta's presence on cam
pus is a "critical contribution to the
general scholarly and academic di
versity of the Stanford campus."
The petition is hanging outside
of Room 112 A in the Anthropology
Department and is circulating on
campus e-mail lists.
In addition to this support on
campus, Gupta is supported by a
legal fund. UC-Irvine Anthropolo
gy Prof. James Ferguson is in
charge of the fund, which he said
has raised about $5,000 since its
start last month.
Gupta already had run up sub
stantial fees for legal consultation
before the fund was created, Fergu
son said, although he added that
the $5,000 more than covers all ex
penses to date.
He said Gupta is, at his own re

quest, not receiving any informa
tion about the source or amount of
donations. The decision to base the
fund off campus was due in part to
a wish to insulate Gupta and his
Stanford colleagues from the
process.
Ferguson noted the possibility
of legal action if all appeals are de
nied and said having legal help is a
frequent practice in tenure appeals
and "does make the administration
pay attention."
Any money remaining after the
issue is resolved will be refunded.
"None of the money will go to
anything but [Gupta'sJ case," Fer
guson said.
He added that donors come
from all over the country as well as
abroad and include many people
not personally associated with
Gupta.
The effort at Stanford is being
overseen by Sameer Pandya, a doc
toral student in modern thought
and literature. He said campus
fund raising had been "moving in
tandem" with nationwide efforts
since last month but that he has yet
to send the proceeds to Ferguson.
