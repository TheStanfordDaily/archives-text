# Representation, not taxation
## Candidates debate student role, voice 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Student representation at
the ASSU and administration
levels was one of the most
prominent issues in a debate
last night among the three
ASSU presidential tickets.
Candidates answered ques
tions from a three-member
panel and a substantial audi
ence in Branner Lounge; many
of the inquiries drew responses
about how the ASSU repre
sents students and how to en
sure effective student repre
sentation on University com
mittees.
Senior Jim Finsten, a presi
dential candidate, repeatedly
called for a student seat on the
Board of Trustees. Finsten is a
student representative on the
board's development commit
tee, but students at this point
cannot be present when the
board meets as a whole.
He stressed that all issues in
the ASSU election — to be held
tomorrow and Thursday — in
volving the administration
would be much better ad
dressed were the board made to
listen to a student voice.
"When it comes to their ed
ucation, students' opinion
isn't worth a damn," Finsten
said.
Emily Andrus, a junior also
running for president, echoed a
concern she attributed to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, that students "are not
taking advantage of the re
sources we already have, par
ticularly student seats on Uni
versity committees."
She noted that the current
nominations process frequent

ly does not fill all the student
spaces and that a seat on the
Board of Trustees would be a
more realistic prospect if stu
dent input increased through
current channels.
Senior Howard Loo, the
third presidential candidate,
also mentioned his concern
about the current nominations
process and pledged to put
more effort as president into
the nominations process. He
advocated a greater role for the
ASSU in informing University
committees of student con
cerns.
Loo mentioned this as part
of a "45-Day Plan," which he
and his running mate, junior
Solomon Lefler, have pledged
to enact by June 1 regardless of
election results. It would, in
part, tie dorm governments in
with ASSU policy making.
Another major issue was re
forming undergraduate educa
tion, addressed most specifical
ly by Finsten's running mate,
junior Kelly Naylor, who
stressed the role of interdisci
plinary programs and student
designed classes.
Andrus also cleared up a
major question on many stu
dents' minds: the triangle on
her campaign posters.
She said it is an attention
getting device borrowed from
her senate campaign last
year.
For those determined to find
meaning, she suggested a "styl
ized A for Andrus or ASSU," a
Greek delta for her running
mate, junior Ben Decker, or a
diagram with the administra
tion, faculty and students at
the corners.
