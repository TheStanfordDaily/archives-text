An Open Letter to Stanford Students
Dear Fellow Student:
On Wednesday and Thursday of this week, you will be asked to
cast a vote on everything from the Student Body President to Class
Presidents, from Special Fees to Senators, from Constitutional
Amendments to Referenda. It's easy to get lost in a ballot with so
many decisions - and even easier to glance by them with the point
and click of a mouse.
There is one vote on this year's ballot that is unlike any Stanford
students have seen in years. It's a vote on University policy, and for
once the decision is up to us.
The Stanford University Judicial Charter spells out our rights in a
Fundamental Standard and/or 1 lonor Code violation proceeding.
Whether you are accused of cheating, accuse someone of sexual
harassment, or even if you've simply witnessed a crime, the Judicial
Charter determines what protections you are entitled to within the
Judicial Affairs Process.
This year, we are being asked to approve a new Charter. This
new Charter puts students at the center of decision making and
intends to strengthen student rights while streamlining a complicated
bureaucracy.
We ask that you spend some extra time to read through the new
Charter and understand its implications. Most importantly, we ask that
you think through it, talk about it, and cast an educated vote.
it's not everyday that we're asked to decide University policy —
let's cio it right.
You can review the new Judicial Charier at...
