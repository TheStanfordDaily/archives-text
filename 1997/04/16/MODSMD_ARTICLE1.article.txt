# Donations help fund fellows
## $200M endowment campaign more than halfway to its goal 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
More than half the funding is now in place for
a $200-million campaign to endow Stanford
Graduate Fellowships in sciences and engineer
ing, University President Gerhard Casper an
nounced yesterday.
Beginning next year, 100 doctoral candidates
annually will receive three-year fellowships. The
initiative is designed to make up for decreased
and more uncertain federal funding in science
and engineering.
Casper, speaking at a news conference in
Tresidder Union yesterday, called the $108 mil
lion already donated "an important milestone"
because the program was announced less than a

year ago. The first $100 million was raised from
a total of six donations.
Board of Trustees Chair Robert Bass, who do
nated $10 million of the first $100 million,
praised the new fellowships for decreasing Stan
ford's reliance on government money.
He also commended the fellowships for allow
ing students more flexibility than federal grants
in regard to the line of research they can pursue;
he called them "an ambitious front-line program
to train and develop leaders."
Even with what he called the "heartening en
dorsement" of generous donations, Casper
stressed that it is still "simply impossible ... to
do major research in science and engineering
without government playing a major role."
He pointed out that even if it were possible to

raise a billion-dollar endow
ment for research, that would
still only yield $f>o million an
nually, as opposed to the near
ly $400 million a year the Uni-

versity receives in federal research support.
"We cannot privatize the research enterprise
in the United States," Casper said.
Even so, the 100 fellowships a year, which
give each student $12,000 a year in tuition aid
over three years and a $16,000 annual stipend,
will account for about a quarter of the doctoral
candidates per year in the affected departments,
according to Charles Kruger, dean of research
and graduate policy.

The fellowships will be depart
mentally allocated. Out of 150
nominations for 100 places next
year, Kruger said 75 went to the
School of Engineering and 20 to the
School of Medicine, primarily in
basic science research. In the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
he identified the Chemistry De
partment as a major participant.
Kruger said the first year's nom
inations were based on how much
departments were dependent on
various types of federal funding
and the number of doctorates they
awarded.

Casper said the decision to ad
dress federal cuts by supporting in
dividual students rather than
whole research projects was a delib
erate course taken after consulting
the various deans affected by the
changes.
"Ten million dollars goes a long
way in supporting students,"
Casper said. "It does not go a long
way in supporting research projects
as such."
He also said the new money wjis
specifically targeted at areas that
are losing federal funds. Therefore,
they will go overwhelmingly to
ward basic science and engineering
research.
Resesirch in the humanities does
not receive comparable federal
funding to scientific research, and

graduate students in the humani
ties are already funded through the
University rather than through the
government.
The six donations that make up
the first $100 million are designed
to be matching funds for more nu
merous but smaller donations that
will constitute the second $100 mil
lion. During its first few years, the
program's funding is guaranteed
by a donation from the President's
Fund, Kruger said.
One of the expected major
sources for the remaining $92 mil
lion will be Silicon Valley. Among
the original six donors, the Califor
nia electronics industry was repre
sented by John Morgridge, chair of
Cisco Systems, who donated jointly
with his wife, Tashia.

Speaking about the growth in the
local electronics industry over the
past few decades, Morgridge called
Stanford "a cornerstone in this
unique economic miracle." Stanford
was valuable both for training fu
ture Silicon Valley employees and
entrepreneurs and for carrying out
research in basic science.
In addition to Bass and Mor
gridge, who received MBAs from
Stanford in 1974 and 1957, respec
tively, the six contributors of the
first $100 million to the program
included the Packard Foundation
and three anonymous donors.
Morgridge said he hoped to help
the University reach the full $200
million by "tapping into those who
have so generously benefited from
the Valley miracle."
