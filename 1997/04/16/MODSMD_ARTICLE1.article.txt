# Donations help fund fellows
## $200M endowment campaign more than halfway to its goal 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
More than half the funding is now in place for
a $200-million campaign to endow Stanford
Graduate Fellowships in sciences and engineer
ing, University President Gerhard Casper an
nounced yesterday.
Beginning next year, 100 doctoral candidates
annually will receive three-year fellowships. The
initiative is designed to make up for decreased
and more uncertain federal funding in science
and engineering.
Casper, speaking at a news conference in
Tresidder Union yesterday, called the $108 mil
lion already donated "an important milestone"
because the program was announced less than a

year ago. The first $100 million was raised from
a total of six donations.
Board of Trustees Chair Robert Bass, who do
nated $10 million of the first $100 million,
praised the new fellowships for decreasing Stan
ford's reliance on government money.
He also commended the fellowships for allow
ing students more flexibility than federal grants
in regard to the line of research they can pursue;
he called them "an ambitious front-line program
to train and develop leaders."
Even with what he called the "heartening en
dorsement" of generous donations, Casper
stressed that it is still "simply impossible ... to
do major research in science and engineering
without government playing a major role."
He pointed out that even if it were possible to

raise a billion-dollar endow
ment for research, that would
still only yield $f>o million an
nually, as opposed to the near
ly $400 million a year the Uni-

versity receives in federal research support.
"We cannot privatize the research enterprise
in the United States," Casper said.
Even so, the 100 fellowships a year, which
give each student $12,000 a year in tuition aid
over three years and a $16,000 annual stipend,
will account for about a quarter of the doctoral
candidates per year in the affected departments,
according to Charles Kruger, dean of research
and graduate policy.
