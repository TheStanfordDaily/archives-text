# There's no place like home?
## While their parents move, students fight mixed emotions 
### Joann Liao 
What would it be like to leave
home knowing you were never
coming back? For a number of
Stanford students, this scenario
is more than hypothetical. As
they pack to leave for college,
their parents are packing too.
Thinking it is easier on their
kids, many parents wait for their
children to enter the hallowed
halls of Stanford before changing
their place of residence.
However, in most cases their
well-meaning ploy fails. Students
still find themselves struggling
with the difficulties of relocation.
Freshman Jason Sanchez re
counted how his parents moved
from Tempe, Ariz., to
Owensville, Ky., two weeks after
he left for Stanford.
Owensville "is a small town,
maybe 800 people, a shock from
the 150,000 or so in Tempe,"
Sanchez said. "When I was there,
I was bored, extremely. But I
have family living in Kentucky
already, as well as old friends, so
I guess I'm not a total outsider."
For others who are not fortu
nate enough to know anyone in
their parents' new home, adjust
ing proves to be more difficult.
"I feel completely out of place

in my parents' house. After all,
that's how I refer to it. I still con
sider Philadelphia my home,"
said sophomore Gabriela Duno,
whose parents moved from Bryn
Mawr, Pa., to Monterrey, Mexi
co.
Duno said her father moved
first while she, her sister and her
mother stayed behind in Penn
sylvania. She and her sister
wanted to graduate with their
friends, Duno said.
Now, however, "more and
more, though, I am starting to
think of Stanford as my home be
cause it is the most permanent
residence to me," Duno said.
Junior Andrew Martinez-
Fonts, whose parents are in the
process of moving from San An
tonio to El Paso, agreed.
"At this point, I think Stan
ford is my home," he said.
For Martinez-Fonts, being at
college did somewhat soften the
blow of having his parents move.
"I'm glad I had a chance to
spend a few years getting used to
living on my own and less depen
dent on having to be 'home' to
have friends," said Martinez-
Fonts.
Currently, his father is also
learning the meaning of two
homes, Martinez-Fonts said. His

father makes a long commute
each week, flying to El Paso to
work and returning to San Anto
nio on the weekends.
Junior Patrick Weekes no
longer has the option of commut
ing between his two homes.
"It was the parents moving
away from me, not me moving
away from the parents. It only
hurts on weekends, when I real
ize that I can't just go home and
hangout anymore," said Weekes,
whose parents moved from
Pleasanton, Ca., to Madison,
Wis.
Weekes added that he felt
being away at Stanford made it
easier to deal with his parents'
move.
"I think it made it a little bet
ter since it wasn't as much of a
shock for me," Weekes said.
However, for freshman Jack
Hamilton, being away made it
more difficult.
"My first reaction when I
heard they were moving is that it
couldn't have come at a worse
time," Hamilton said. "I kept
thinking how coming home from
college wouldn't really seem like
coming home at all."
This struggle to redefine
home is characteristic for many
whose parents have moved.

"If we had moved earlier, I
may have built some attachment
to Monterrey, but it's so hard for
me to keep in touch with people
and really feel like I have a place
to call home," Duno said.
The concept of home is not
necessarily geographical.
Sanchez still returns to Ari
zona to visit old friends during
winter and spring break.
"Arizona is still my home, al
though maybe not technically.
Kentucky is more of an after
thought than anything else,"
Sanchez said.
