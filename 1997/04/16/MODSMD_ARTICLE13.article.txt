Dow Jones rebounds from slump
WASHINGTON (AP) — Wall Street staged a
remarkable rebound yesterday, with soaring
stocks and bonds reflecting investors' enthusiasm
about better-than-expected corporate earnings
and benign inflation news.
Ihe Dow Jones industrial average shot up
135.26 points to close at 6,587.16. It was the sec
ond-biggest point gain on record, bested only by a
186.84 point rally in October 1987, two days after
the market had plunged by 508 points.
In percentage terms, the 2.10 percent gain
was the best one-day showing in three years. On
Monday, the Dow average had risen by 60.21
points, fueled by investor enthusiasm over
strong first-quarter earnings reported by a num
ber of companies.
The rally gained new strength yesterday fol
lowing a Labor Department report that con
sumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in March, eas
ing fears that the strong economy was causing
inflation to rise as well.
Analysts termed the performance amazing
given that on Friday the Dow average of 30 indus
trial stocks had plunged by 148 points, putting
stocks 9.8 percent below their record close on
March 11. It was the biggest correction since the
current bull market began in October 1990 and
had raised widespread concerns that perhaps the
record runup in stocks was finally ending.

Jackie Robinson honored
NEW YORK (AP) — Fifty years after Jackie
Robinson became major league baseball's first
black player, the nation remembered yesterday
what his accomplishment meant to the game and
to people of color everywhere.
Robinson's grandson, Jesse Sims, threw out
the ceremonial first pitch at Shea Stadium before
the game between New York Mets and the Los
Angeles Dodgers. President Clinton and Robin
son's widow, Rachel, were to speak during the
fifth inning.
On the scoreboard was a picture of Robinson in
his Brooklyn Dodgers uniform coming down the
third base line, daring a pitcher to do something
about it. Next to it was a message: "He was the
handsome, heroic giant of our youth who taught
us determination, taught us perseverance and
finally, taught us justice."
Clinton told ESPN during the game: "I hope
that all Americans, as we start a new century .. .
go back to the lessons of that Dodger team."
A 5-mile long thoroughfare leading from
Brooklyn to the stadium in Queens, which passes
through the cemetery where Robinson was buried
in 1972, was renamed Jackie Robinson Parkway.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called it "a small
thank you to the man who paved the way for
greater equality and opportunity for African
Americans in this country."
