# FBI lab work errors revealed
## Mistakes made in Oklahoma City bombing case, report says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI crime lab agents pro
duced flawed scientific work or inaccurate testimony
in major aises such as the Oklahoma City bombing,
the Justice Department inspector general said yester
day. He recommended discipline for five agents and
transfer of the original whistle-blower.
But Inspector General Michael Bromwich conclud
ed in his report that agents of the world-renowned
crime lab did not commit perjury or fabricate evi
dence.
Bromwich criticized lab management and the
qualifications of agents in its explosives unit, where
he recommended that only scientists be employed.
He emphatically endorsed the FBl's current effort to
get the lab accredited by outside experts for the first
time.
In a typical criticism of work on high-profile cases,
Bromwich blasted lab supervisor David Williams'
1993 testimony that a 1,200-pound urea nitrate bomb
damaged New York's World Trade Center. FBI
chemists found no explosive residues at the site.
Williams' testimony was "inaccurate and incom
plete" and appeared to be "tailored to the most
incriminating result," Bromwich said.
The FBI accepted nearly all of Bromwich's recom
mendations. To avoid any conflict, the Justice Depart
ment, not the FBI, will rule on Bromwich's proposals
to punish agents and transfer the chief whistle-blow
er, scientist-agent Frederic Whitehurst.
"There was a clear and serious failing in not ade
quately detecting these problems and, in many

instances, not moving swiftly enough to resolve
them, I 1 HI Deputy Director Bill Ksposito said. "The
improvements ... must and are being made."
Bromwich said Whitehurst, who triggered the
investigation, should he transferred because his
"overstated and incendiary" allegations have poi
soned his relations with other lab workers.
In the Oklahoma bombing, Bromwich said explo
sives unit supervisor Williams decided a 4,000-pound
ammonium nitrate-fuel oil bomb was used based on
the defendants alleged purchases rather than on sci
entific evidence.
Bromwich said Williams should be transferred
from the lab because he "repeatedly reached conclu
sions that incriminated the defendants without a sci
entific basis."
The report also found that explosives unit chief J.
Thomas Thurman did not properly review Williams'
work and said Williams and Thurman "merit special
censure" for their Oklahoma work.
Federal prosecutors have removed Williams from
their list of expert witnesses at the trial of Timothy
McVeigh (or the ()klahoma bombing. They say anoth
er FBI export can present the explosives evidence, but
defense attorney Stephen Jones had indicated he will
attack the lab's work.
Christopher Mueller, a law professor at University
of Colorado Law School, said .Judge Richard Matsch
may at most allow only limited portions of the report
into evidence — and may bar it completely if the pros
ecution relies on scientists who weren't criticized.
