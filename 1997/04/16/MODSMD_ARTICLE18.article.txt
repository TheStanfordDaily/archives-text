## Beating Gen X to death 
### 
IF I HEAR the term "Generation X"
one more time I think I will puke. I
think I will start hunting down those
sniveling ad-execs who think they have
their finger on the 20-something Zeit
geist and remind them, obscenely, that I
am not the attention-defecited, cyber
dyed, teflon-hipped girl of their target
market. I am tired of being patronized. I
am tired of my every whim and desire
being tracked and mass-marketed. I am
tired of hip irony, and I am tired of gyrat
ing MTV fly girls.
If I remember correctly, Douglas Cou
pland's 1991 book was not about our gen
eration at all but instead about what he
saw as the particularly rootless, zombie
kids born in the lato '50s and '60s. Need
I point out this generation is in ij,s
30s now? It's kind of a moot point
because some of the media powers that
be have decided that we too are rootless
zombie kids with the attention spans of
Jenny McCarthy on speed. So new 20-
something magazines, like Swing, have
sprouted up — advertising vehicles that
are about as intelligent and subtle as a
ton of bricks. Even college applications
include essay questions on students' atti
tudes toward the "Gen X" label.
I guess what got me started on this
rant was the six free introductory issues
of Swing that I somehow got duped into
ordering a couple of months ago. If you
haven't seen it yet, Swing is like a classier
version of U. Magazine (the one that

comes with The Daily periodically), start
ed by David Lauren, Ralph Lauren's son.
(Tip: If you're going to start a magazine,
it doesn't hurt to be related to a major
source of ad revenue.)
In its illustrious one-year career,
Swing has published such gems as:
"America's Most Powerful 20-Some
things," "The 20-Somethings Corporate
America Can't Live Without," "Necking
in the '90s: The New 20-Something Social
Scene," and many other puke-inducing
tidbits about the "paradox generation."
It's not too clear to me just what
Swing thinks the paradox of our genera
tion is — maybe it's the fact that we're
college-educated yet apparently too
mindless to handle more than a sound
bite headline and a bunch of shallow,
two-paragraph articles. Maybe it's the
fact that, yes, many of us were weaned on
television, but still, somehow, we man
aged to grow brains. Maybe it's inherent
ly paradoxical to try to define an entire
generation in the first place.
Why does it bug me so much? I don't
know. Maybe it's the unnerving fact that
our generation is being defined for us
instead of by us. Not only our generation
but every generation — the Donna Reed
generation and the flower children and
the disco kids and so on. There's an ad and
TV niche for every age group, political per
suasion and ethnic group. Gen X-perts,
says Swing, are indispensable to corporate
America, mining out every trend from Doc

Martens to wifebeater tank-tops. It's not
simply that I feel misunderstood but that
I feel overly understood.
So overly understood that even writ
ing about it seems trite — my frustration
has already been mined by the vultures
and turned back on itself with the same
flip irony that has co-opted and deflated
everything from protest movements to
generational rebellion itself. Witness the
recent "victory" for sweatshop laborers
proclaimed by corporations who've
signed on to improve working conditions
overseas. I can just see all the new P.C.
"No Sweatshop" marketing campaigns
that will claim to have liberated the
oppressed laborers (though they still
won't earn a living wage).
What would it mean to try to defy the
bland workings of the culture machine
that keeps spewing out new versions of
ourselves — and our generation — for
endless recontemplation? I guess it would
be pretty futile. Pretty soon the Gen-X
image will get old, like plastic Madonna
bracelets, and someone will reinvent us in
a new and shiny reincarnation that reeks
the same patronizing pop stench.

Rula Razek, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, couldn't bear to
put an ironic, self-referential, Gen-X-type
sound bite in this space.
