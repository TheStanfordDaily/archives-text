IN THE Daily's Monday endorse
ments on amendments to the
ASSU Constitution, the "no" rec
ommendation for amendment 10 was
based on an inaccurate understand
ing of the regulations that govern the
special-fee application procedure.
The amendment would explicitly

ban the ASSU Senate from dictating
from which community a group may
seek its fee. But the senate is not
afforded that power under the cur
rent language of the constitution.
The amendment's provisions are
beneficial; they simplify the peti
tion-gathering process for fee-seek

ing groups by reducing proportion
ally the number of signatures that
must be collected by groups apply
ing for a special fee from only one
sub-population, either undergradu
ates or graduate students.
This worthwhile amendment
should be passed.
