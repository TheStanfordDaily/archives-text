New programs at the
heart of Film Society's
plans for next year
In response to The Daily's criticism of
the Stanford Film Society and its "no"
endorsement, I would like to clarify two
points made in yesterday's comments.
First, the article was wrong in stat
ing that the film society is going to be
using special-fee money for a trip to
Utah's Sundance Film Festival. On the
contrary, the group does its own fund
raising to subsidize travel costs to make
the trip more accessible. The remainder
of the costs (lodging, food, etc.) is paid
for by the students themselves. This
information was stated in the detailed
budget itemization (submitted with the
budget itself), and ignoring it shows
apparent carelessness by The Daily in
its recommendations.
Second, I would like address The
Daily's assertion that "more attention
should be paid to on-campus organizing."
This is the precise reason for the increase
in our special-fee request. Because this
was only our second year, we were previ
ously unaware of the potential for film
society activities on campus. The realiza
tion of this potential is reflected in the
budget outlined this year.
Next year we hope to continue the
successful Coffee House series, which
was started halfway through this year
and showcases student films and
acclaimed shorts free of charge. We also
hope to increase the impact of the
"Crossing Communities" series, a series
dedicated to bringing different student
groups together for educational films, by
screening the films in conjunction with
larger, existing community festivals.
Our third major change for next year is
the debut of the first student film festi

val on the West Coast. It will be held
annually on Stanford's campus and
organized solely by Stanford students.
This event would be open to all Stanford
filmmakers and students, as well as
other students across the country.
The film society declined an interview
with The Daily's Editorial Board this
year in hopes of avoiding the oversights
in the process that were revealed last
year. It appears that such oversights
plagued this year's recommendations as
well, with respect to the film society and
other student groups. We hope this clari
fication emphasizes the value of the film
society to Stanford's campus and the
community it serves.

inclusion of students
I was Stanford's Judicial Affairs Offi
cer for almost 15 years, until about a
year ago, and I am now executive direc
tor of The Center for Academic Integri
ty, a consortium of colleges and univer
sities that works to raise the level of
student honesty on our respective cam
puses and nationwide.
I met with the Committee of 15 early
on in its deliberations and shared with
its members my candid views about the
deficiencies of Stanford's current stu
dent-disciplinary process, both from the
perspective of one who worked around
those deficiencies for many years and one
who has seen better systems in operation
at a variety of schools across the country.
After reading with care and interest
the proposed new charter, I can say

with confidence that it is a vast
improvement over the current govern
ing document. Most important, the pro
posed process involves students in the
daily workings of student discipline.
While this is not exactly fun, it is
important and educational for all con
cerned. The proposed process also
emphasizes that the rules are students'
rules and that students, rather than
administrators, concern themselves
with their fair enforcement.
The proposed charter also does a
good job of simplifying an unnecessarily
complex and legalistic process. Those
characteristics made sense in the topsy
turvy days of 1968, but in 1997 they
are merely burdensome and deserve to
be abandoned.
In summary, the committee has done
an excellent job with a difficult assign
ment, and I hope that the ASSU and
other constituencies will applaud and
support their work â€” not only with affir
mative votes over the next few weeks but
with the energy and commitment that
will make the new system a success and a
credit to the University and its students.

Climbing Wall seeks
all types for new kind
of athletic adventure
I was shocked by the misinformation
used in denying the Stanford Climbing
Wall a special-fee endorsement. These
misunderstandings are exactly what we
are trying to overcome by building the
climbing wall. The sport of climbing's
rich history has recently boomed into a
major international sport that might
well be part of the next Olympics.

Despite the availability of world-famous
climbing four hours away in Yosemite
National Park, the sport has not
received the attention it deserves on the
Stanford campus.
Here I encourage you to take another
look at the climbing wall request. Upon
closer inspection, the climbing wall does
indeed meet The Daily's criteria for spe
cial-fee endorsement. I hope you will also
agree that the climbing wall would be a
great asset to Stanford, to be enjoyed by
the entire Stanford community.
First, let's clear something up: There
seems to be a common misconception
that the climbing wall would only serve
a small community of elite climbers.
While it is true that Stanford is home to
some world-class climbing talent, the
climbing wall and the sport of climbing
in general are things that can be
enjoyed by everyone.
The Stanford Climbing Wall will offer
instruction for those new to the sport and
will welcome dorms, houses and depart
mental groups that have had to rely on
expensive commercial gyms for climbing
outings. The current climbing communi
ty at Stanford is already a diverse group
numbering in the hundreds. Hut the
untapped interest of the student body is
enormous. A survey conducted at the
freshman fair showed that more than 500
of the incoming students wore interested
in learning climbing skills, and more than
2,000 students signed the petition to get
the climbing wall on the ballot. There is
even talk of climbing becoming a club
sport. Clearly, once built, the climbing
wall will serve a large portion of the Stan
ford community, including you.
As far as the climbing wall being a
"good value for the dollar," which is of
course highly subjective, I argue that the
wall is indeed a good value. Consider that
the per-student special-fee cost amounts
to only half of the cost of going to a typi
cal commercial gym a single time. The

Stanford Climbing Wall will offer current
students free access to the wall through
out their entire stay at Stanford. Fur
thermore, the special fee is a one time
only request and is suited perfectly to the
purpose of the special fee: It offers Stan
lord students something that is tangible,
highly enriching, can immediately bene
fit everyone and will be a permanent part
of the Stanford community, regardless of
future ASSU funding cycles.
The Daily's description of the climb
ing wall as "what amounts to an expen
sive jungle gym" is like describing a
swimming pool as an expensive puddle
of water. While both a puddle of water
and a jungle gym offer a fun place for
the young at heart to play, a swimming
pool and a climbing wall both offer a
place for serious athletes to train, a
place for anyone to work out and a
place for everyone to meet, build trust
and have a great time.
One might argue t hat like a swimming
pool, the climbing wall should l>e support
ed by the Athletics Department. 1 would
agree and point to the fact that the Ath
letics Department has already committed
space for the wall and has offered to sup
port our staffing efforts. This support
could easily come to equal the contribu
tion from student fees. Wi> have also been
exploring outside donations as an addi
tional funding source. The Athletics
Department has offered its share; now
we're asking for the students' support.
The Stanford Climbing Wall will ben
efit the entire Stanford community. If
you've already been climbing, you know
how much fun it is, how climbing chal
lenges and trains you physically, men
tally and interpersonally. If you've
never climbed, we'll show you how. So
vote "yes" for both Stanford Climbing
Wall special fees.

space for the wall and has offered to sup
port our staffing efforts. This support
could easily come to equal the contribu
tion from student fees. Wi> have also been
exploring outside donations as an addi
tional funding source. The Athletics
Department has offered its share; now
we're asking for the students' support.
The Stanford Climbing Wall will ben
efit the entire Stanford community. If
you've already been climbing, you know
how much fun it is, how climbing chal
lenges and trains you physically, men
tally and interpersonally. If you've
never climbed, we'll show you how. So
vote "yes" for both Stanford Climbing
Wall special fees.
