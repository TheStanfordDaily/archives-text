Faster and more efficient facial peels

For people with sun-damaged skin and wrin
kles, a new laser hand piece makes facial peels
faster and more efficient while avoiding the com
plications and imprecision of traditional surgical
methods.
Stanford Asst. Surgery Prof. James Koch
reports after a six month study that the new hand
piece for a carbon dioxide laser used in facial peels

removes skin 33 percent faster than other laser hand pieces
while giving the doctor precise control.
The new hand piece, a pen-like device, emits a wide diameter
laser beam, allowing the doctor to quickly sweep the face.
As the laser removes damaged skin, it also causes the skin to
contract while tightening the underlying collagen, a fibrous pro
tein that gives skin its elasticity. This skin tightening effect is
like a "mini-face lift."
"Laser treatment produces dramatic results," Koch said.
When new skin grows back, "people really do have a firmer, new
layer. It is a rejuvenation procedure."
The laser works by emitting pulses of energy that target the
water in skin and slowly burn away thin layers of the skin.
The laser procedure compares favorably to chemical peels
where strong chemicals are used to burn away the skin or der
mabrasion where the skin is sanded away.
"The results are better than with the traditional chemical
peels and dermabrasion because the doctor can accurately con
trol the depth of the skin removal," Koch said.

Protein treatment raises helper T-cell counts

Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases report that injections of the
immune system protein, IL-2, can create dramatic
increases in the level of CD4+ helper T-cells in peo
ple infected by HIV.
IL-2, produced naturally by T-cells, helps in the
production and maturation of T-cells and other
immune system cells.

CD4+ T-cells are helper cells vital for identifying viruses in
the body. After they find a virus or infected cell, they activate
other immune cells in the body to eliminate the infection.
In patients infected with HIV, the level of CD4+ T-cells drops
from the normal level of 1,000 cells per cubic millimeter of blood.
In the study led by Dr. Richard Davey, patients had a starting
CD4+ T-cell count of about 350 cells per cubic millimeter. This
number increased after treatment with IL-2, signaling an
improvement of the immune system.
IL-2 has previously been given to HIV patients by an intravenous
method. The new treatment can be self-administered by the patient.
Used with standard HIV treatments, IL-2 has the potential to
enhance the therapeutic effects of standard treatment alone,
Davey said.
