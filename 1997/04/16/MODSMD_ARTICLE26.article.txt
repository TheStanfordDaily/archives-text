# The 						little machines that could
## Scientists pioneer new manufacturing process

With the advent of integrated circuit
technology, Silicon Valley and personal com
puters were born. Building several chips on
a single silicon wafer was the key technology
for building a computer's central processing
unit. Now, Stanford's Rapid Prototyping
Lab has pioneered the mechanical equiva
lent to integrated circuit technology.
Using a process of Shape Deposition Man
ufacturing, a new mechanical design called
"massively parallel mechanical systems"
could replace conventional jet engines and
satellite thrusters with a series of micro
components.
"We have a process where you can build
integrated assemblies, not only one of a kind
but potentially massively parallel struc
tures. When you build a computer chip, you
don't go the store and buy a million transis
tors and assemble them together — you
build them in an integrated fashion," said
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Friedrich
Prinz.
SDM involves building a device layer by
layer. The material is deposited and shaped
at each step. Using this process, the poten
tial to create highly sophisticated, complex
and numerous devices on a "micro" level is
possible.

So far, the lab has only built simple
devices such as a miniature four-bladed pro
peller that measures 5 millimeters across.
Eventually, researchers hope to build com
ponents that measure only one-tenth of a
millimeter across.
"We are talking about building devices
and structures which would be impossible to
build with conventional fabrication tech
niques." said Prinz. "For example, it is pos
sible to build cooling channels where you
can deliver air or fluid into regions that
would be difficult to access. The capability
of being able to build channels of arbitrary
geometric complexity is inherently very
attractive."
Building several small mechanical devices
rather than a large one has both advantages
and disadvantages. Power density is greatly
improved with massively parallel mechani
cal systems, but efficiency is reduced. There
are, however, many instances when this
trade-off is worth it.
"For a rocket you have to deliver some
thing in a certain period of time, efficiency is
not the most important thing, power densi
ty is," Prinz said.
One of the major advantages of parallel
systems is reliability. "Given the fact that
you have redundancy built into the system,
overall performance is at a very high degree
of reliability," said Prinz. For example, if

one of the components fails, the built-in
redundancy will ensure that the system is
backed up.
Prinz and his colleagues have proposed
several devices that could be built with this
new manufacturing process. They have pro
posed a new satellite thrustor system that
utilizes a massively parallel systems design.
In the past, the conventional thruster
only allowed a single thrust at a time. With
several miniature thrusters, the output can
be controlled on both an individual and col
lective level.
Another project that they have proposed
is a virtual reality interface that allows a
person to feel a virtual object. This "haptic"
interface is constructed with an array of
millimeter-square pins tightly packed
together. A computer program could move
these pins up and down to give the illusion
of a solid texture. With many pins spaced
closely together, this interface would feel
very realistic.
For example, a person could rest his hand
on a pad made of thousands of these pins
and feel the shape and hardness of a com
puter generated surface.
Although massively parallel mechanical
systems technology is still in its infancy, the
potential benefits in reliability and power
density make it a powerful complement to
conventional manufacturing technologies.
