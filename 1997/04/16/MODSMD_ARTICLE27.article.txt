# Stanford hosts 6th International World Wide Web Conference

### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
The Sixth International World Wide
Web Conference, held April 7 to 11 at
the Santa Clara Convention Center,
drew a crowd of 1,800, including the
designer of the World Wide Web, a for
mer astronaut and University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper.
Although the conference was primar
ily a forum for international academics
to present their research on the Web,
many "peripheral" events occurred
simultaneously, said Christine Quinn,
the event's co-organizer.
The theme of this year's conference,
which was hosted by Stanford Universi
ty and the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, was the world-wide accessibility
of the Web.
Mae Jemison, a former astronaut
who spoke at last year's commence
ment ceremonies, gave a presentation
on society's obligation to offer every
one equal access to the Web. This
includes the disabled, people from
lower socioeconomic backgrounds and
people accessing from modems with
low band-widths.
Quinn said the conference's agenda
was set one year ago, but accessibility to
the Internet really had not been a "hot"
topic before.
"It wouldn't have happened then and
there if it hadn't been for the conference,"

Quinn said. "We started the ball rolling."
Quinn and her team worked to help
participants interact with one another
before the conference began through an
Interactive Conference Environment.
When a person registered for the
conference, a personal home page was
automatically established on the Web.
Participants could modify their
page, including personal information
and interests, to help them get in
touch with others in their field. The
page also contained a personal
itinerary for the week, so participants
could change the events they wanted
to attend at any time.
Organizers also experimented with
intra-conferencing through a separate
conference e-mail network that proved
to be popular among many participants.
"We wanted to explore technology
and how it could be used in a conference
environment," Quinn said.
One of the week's highlights includ
ed a panel of six members. Only half of
the panelists were in Santa Clara. The
other three were seated halfway around
the world in Southampton, England, in
conjunction with a similar conference
called Hypertext '97.
People who could not attend the
conference in person could access it
live via the Weh. Stanford students
designed real-time cameras that could
be manipulated by the Web user to
move in different directions. In addi

tion, Audio Net's "Pat and Mike WWW
Radio Show" was broadcast in Real A
udio over the Web.
As with any high-tech event of this
magnitude, glitches were bound to
come up.
The weekend before the conference,
organizers discovered that the confer
ence center's house wiring could not
support all of their networking needs.
"The convention center was not
ready for event that was networked to
this extent," Quinn said.
Organizers resorted to laying out
extra wiring in the hallways and taping
it down.
"Everyone that comes here expects
everything to be fully networked,"
Quinn said.
Despite high collision rates through
out the week, Quinn said that the
majority of wiring glitches were worked
out by Monday afternoon.
More than 250 academic conference
papers were submitted to the confer
ence's program committee chaired by
Assoc. Computer Science Prof. Michael
Genesereth. Sixty-two papers were
presented.
Keynote speakers appeared
throughout the week, including
Howard Rheingold, editor of the online
magazine "Hot Wired," Douglas Engel
bart, inventor of the mouse and Ted
Nelson, the man who coined the term
"hypertext."
