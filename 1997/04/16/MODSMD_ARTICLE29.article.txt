# Bug explains Teflon-coated pans, atomic bombs and sticky eggs
## 
### Anthony Engel 
Q. The last time 1 cooked eggs,
* they stuck to the pan.
* Any suggestions?
A # Have you checked out pans
* coated with polytetrafluo

methylene? There I go again with
the scientific lingo. You probably
know it as Teflon.
It was discovered by accident
by Roy Plunkett and Jack Rebok
in 1938. DuPont and General
Motors set up a research laborato
ry that focused on the research,
development and commercializa
tion of chlorofluorocarbons.
Teflon came out of research on
freon, that refrigerant we no
longer use.
Even though it was discovered
in 1938, it wasn't used commer
cially until 1946, and even then, it
was only used in industrial appli
cations. Why? Well, it turned out
that Teflon was extremely diffi
cult to work with. Thankfully, its
interesting properties kept it on
the back burner.
Teflon is slippery and impervi

ous to most corrosive chemicals.
In 1941, when the United States
was building the atomic bomb,
scientists developed a method to
separate two isotopes of uranium.
This was accomplished with ura
nium hexaflouride, a highly reac
tive chemical.
The government needed some
thing that could coat the insides
of tubes and gaskets that would
not paten away by the uranium
hexaflouride. Teflon's properties
seemed perfect. With the funding
of the government, the difficulties
of working with Teflon were over
come, and the rest is, as they say,
history.
"This is great," you say, "but
what is Teflon, and why does it
keep egg from sticking to the pan?"
Well, because Teflon is made
up of only carbon and fluorine

atoms, it is called a fluorocarbon.
This is what gives it its amazing
nonstick properties. You see, oils
and fats have no chemical attrac
tion to fluorocarbons. This is
why most foods don't stick to
Teflon pans.
The question of how Teflon got
onto pans in the first place is a dif
ferent story. In the early 19505,
Marc Gregoire, a resident of
Paris, used Teflon on fishing wire
to keep it from tangling. His wife
thought that it might be a good
idea to use it on pots and pans. He
tested her idea and it was a suc
cess.
Teflon did not originally stick
to pans very well. Great care was
needed to keep the Teflon from
chipping off. Like the other prob
lems with Teflon, these too have
been ironed out.

Before the Teflon coating is
added, a pan is first sandblasted,
making it rough. Primer is then
applied and the Teflon becomes
stuck in the primer. Even though
the Teflon it is very slippery, it
becomes caught in the nooks and
crannies of the rough surface.
The applications of Teflon

today includc more than just, pots
and pans. Its slipperiness makes
it an ideal lubricant It is even
used in surgical implants because
it's inert and doesn't react with
the body.
So when; have you been for the
last 40 years? Go out and buy a
new set of cookware.
