# Dial-in modem access to be limited on campus next year

Some students on campus will soon have to
change their way of connecting to the Stanford net
work.
Beginning fall quarter, students who live in cer
tain on-campus residences will no longer be able to
dial into the University network resources using a
modem. These students will have to purchase an
Ethernet card or some variation thereof in order to
communicate over keyboard. Only 14 campus resi
dences will be allowed dial-in access.
Last year, the decision was made to limit central
modem-pool access to off-campus and on-campus
students whose residences do not offer guaranteed
in-room connections. The modem pool had been
overloaded by on-campus users who monopolized
the resources.
Resident computer coordinators have been e
mailing their residents about the change.
The University wanted to get this information
about in-room connections out to students in time

for the Draw, said Chip Haven, the acting director of
Networking Systems. "We are working with the
housing office and ResComp to try and share this in
formation," he said.
According to Haven, the original recommenda
tion for limiting modem pool access was made by a
faculty body that advises Computing and Communi
cation Services, part of Information Technology Sys
tems and Services.
"The problem we were facing was a big increase in
the number of people using the modem pool, causing
a period of time when the modem pool was fully sub
scribed," Haven said. The central modem pool has
more than 300 modems that can connect at a maxi
mum rate of 14.4 Kbps â€” technology that is old in
comparison with new ones that operate at 28.8 and
33.6 Kbps.
Before making the decision, other alternatives for
lowering on-campus usage of the dial-in modem ac

pool and increasing the number of modems in the
