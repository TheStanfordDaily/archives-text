# Dial-in modem access to be limited on campus next year
## 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
Some students on campus will soon have to
change their way of connecting to the Stanford net
work.
Beginning fall quarter, students who live in cer
tain on-campus residences will no longer be able to
dial into the University network resources using a
modem. These students will have to purchase an
Ethernet card or some variation thereof in order to
communicate over keyboard. Only 14 campus resi
dences will be allowed dial-in access.
Last year, the decision was made to limit central
modem-pool access to off-campus and on-campus
students whose residences do not offer guaranteed
in-room connections. The modem pool had been
overloaded by on-campus users who monopolized
the resources.
Resident computer coordinators have been e
mailing their residents about the change.
The University wanted to get this information
about in-room connections out to students in time

for the Draw, said Chip Haven, the acting director of
Networking Systems. "We are working with the
housing office and ResComp to try and share this in
formation," he said.
According to Haven, the original recommenda
tion for limiting modem pool access was made by a
faculty body that advises Computing and Communi
cation Services, part of Information Technology Sys
tems and Services.
"The problem we were facing was a big increase in
the number of people using the modem pool, causing
a period of time when the modem pool was fully sub
scribed," Haven said. The central modem pool has
more than 300 modems that can connect at a maxi
mum rate of 14.4 Kbps â€” technology that is old in
comparison with new ones that operate at 28.8 and
33.6 Kbps.
Before making the decision, other alternatives for
lowering on-campus usage of the dial-in modem ac
cess such as charging students for using the modem
pool and increasing the number of modems in the
pool were considered.
However, according to Haven,
the fee would have been about
$20 a month, which is higher
than several other commercial In
ternet services such as Netcom,
which has a fee of $15 a month.
"The alternative of charging
students was not an especially
palatable idea," Haven said.
The University also had nei
ther the resources nor the funds
to increase the number of connec
tions the modem pool could han
dle.
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof.
Douglas Brutlag, the chair of the
University's Committee on Acad
emic Computing and Information
Systems said, "It was unfair to
off-campus users, and there were
also a few faculty who wanted to
use the Internet in their courses
but felt they couldn't if the stu
dents were unable to get access. It
was largely a student equity prob
lem."
Brutlag said the strategy for
the modem pool also included
outsourcing the higher speed con
nections and new technologies to
companies such as CompuServe

and America Online. A reduced
fee service is also available from
Ricochet, which provides wireless
access to students.
In addition, although students
have to pay for commercial ser
vices, off-campus students would
reap the benefits of having a local
call to access the University net
work from most places rather
than having to make a non-local
call to campus.
Modem pool access will be
blocked for all dial-in attempts
from residences where in-room
connections are available for all
residents. Last summer, the Uni
versity completed installing in
room connections with a large
number of residences; it will
make further progress with in
stalling more in-room connec
tions this summer.
Haven said about 3,000 con
nections installed in Escondido
Village last fall also helped allevi
ate the problem and lowered the
number of complaints. Bill Cleb
sch, associate director for Distrib
uted Computing and Communi
cation Systems, followed up on
the committee's recommenda
tions, tracked the usage and num
ber of complaints from the
modem pool and observed that
the devised strategy seemed effec
tive, according to Brutlag.
