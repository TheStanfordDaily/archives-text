Recipe: Add 15 hits, 12 runs and
zero errors to a sweet pitching perfor
mance. Makes: A victory.
Last night at Sunken Diamond the
No. 5 Stanford baseball team followed
this exact recipe against the San Jose
State Spartans (30-15). The 12-6 vic
tory put the Cardinal (28-11) back on
track after three Pacific 10 Confer
ence losses this weekend against Ari
zona State.
Before this nonconference game,
senior left fielder Chris Clark articu
lated what the Cardinal needed to be
successful.
"The keys for our success are very
simple," Clark said. "We need to play
solid defense and pitch well. Offen
sively, we have to apply pressure

inning to inning. If we do those
things, we win."
Stanford played according to this
game plan, and the result was a victo
ry.
"We didn't push the panic button,"
said sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang, the owner of a 19-game
hitting streak after going 3-for-5.
"We were positive and know that if
we can control what we do, we will
win."
Sophomore Tony Cogan (6-1)
recorded a victory in the first start of
his career. The lefty, who has been
outstanding in the closing role all sea
son, went four innings, allowing only
one run on three hits. Finishing the
pitching duties for the Card were
sophomore Adam Harris and junior
Josh Koons.
Key in the Card's victory was early

offensive production. Stanford
jumped on Spartan pitcher Jason
Farias (5-3) early with four runs in

the Spartan closer, was also making
his first start of the year.
After the first two Stanford bat
ters of the game were retired, sopho
more center fielder Jody Gerut sin

gled and stole second. Senior Luke
Quaccia, batting cleanup, followed
with a bomb over the right-center
field fence. The first baseman's sec
ond home run of the year cleared the
trees outside the stadium, bounced
off the sidewalk and landed on the
football practice field. Quaccia later
doubled, going 2-for-3.
Following Quaccia's monster shot,
Hochgesang singled, extending his
career-high hitting streak to 19
games. Freshman designated hitter
John Gall continued the show, driv
ing the ball over the left-field fence
for his fourth home run. Gall finished
the day 2-for-4 with three RBIs.
Stanford scored in all but two
innings, including three runs in the
fourth and two in the fifth. All nine
