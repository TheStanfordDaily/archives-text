# Caring Keri — Monahan's heart inspiring
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Only a few can detect the immense energy, deter
mination and willpower accumulated in Stanford
gymnast Keri Monahan's petite 5-foot frame at first
glance. However, those who know the junior co-cap
tain well — both on and off the mats — understand
that these are the foundations of everything Monahan
does.
"To me, Keri was the heart of the team this year,"
said head coach Lisa Izzi. "As captain, she put herself

out there on the edge and stood up for the team and
for what she thought it should do."
The biggest risk Monahan took for the team this
season symbolizes her devotion and determination.
Three weeks ago, Monahan went up on the bars
apparatus at the NCAA West Regionals just two weeks
after suffering a severe ankle injury. Although she was
not physically fit to compete, Monahan's strong men
tality told her she was psychologically ready to pull
through.
Unlike most gymnasts at Monahan's level, the well
rounded athlete grew up leading a balanced life,

attending school full-time and living at home while
undergoing daily training at a New Jersey gymnastics
club.
"I don't know how I did it, but I pretty much decid
ed if I was going to be successful, I was going to do it at
home with my own coach," Monahan said. "If some
thing important came up, I'd schedule my workouts
around it."
Some events that called for Monahan to take a
timeout from the gym included an induction ceremo
ny for the National Honor Society, junior and senior
high school proms and an annual week-long family
vacation to the beach.
Monahan took up gymnastics at age 4, when her
best friend, who took lessons at a nearby training cen
ter, declared she could do the best cartwheels.
"She bragged that she could do a better cartwheel
than me," Monahan said. "So I had to learn one
myself."
But Monahan did much more than simply learn a
perfect cartwheel. She awed instructors by quickly
working her way up to higher levels of gymnastics —
as a sixth grader, Monahan had already earned a spot
on the U.S. junior national team, and by 11th grade,
she found herself on the senior national training team.
Since arriving at college, Monahan has continued to
strive upward as a part of the Stanford athletics pro
gram.
Referring to Monahan as one of the "most inspira
tional and motivational people" she's ever met, sopho
more co-captain Amy Murakami said being able to
work side by side with Monahan was one of the best
things about co-heading the squad.
"She is someone to look up to for guidance and lead
ership," Murakami said. "Being sophomore co-cap
tain, I didn't really know exactly what to do, but I tried
to be like Keri — she cares more than anybody about
the team."
While guiding the Cardinal squad to leaps and
bounds this year, constantly resetting school records
and winning individual all-around titles, Monahan has
also engaged in community services and pursued her
interest in health psychology.
When she is not tumbling into the spotlight, Mona
han enjoys hanging out with her friends and speaking
at elementary schools, sharing her experience as an
athlete.
While the human biology major does not see herself
pursuing a career in gymnastics after Stanford, Mon-

Junior Keri Monahan has had little trouble enjoying life both with and without gymnastics.
ahan said the sport is too much a
part of her to leave behind.

'I'm going to do
everything in my
willpower while I am
here for the team to
get the national title.'
—Keri Monahan

"I'll probably always stay
involved in gymnastics in some
way," Monahan said. "But I think
there are other parts of me that

need to be developed."
Monahan is currently looking
into attaining a masters in psychol
ogy while planning an early career
that would involve "helping peo
ple," most likely counseling at a
school or a hospital on the East
Coast near her family before possi
bly pursuing a doctorate.
While looking forward to apply
ing her full energy and drive out
side the gymnastics arena, Mona
han, with just a year remaining in
her gymnastic career, remains as
dedicated to the sport as the day
she stepped through the door of
her first gym in New Jersey.
"I'm going to do everything in
my willpower while I am here for
the team to get the national title,"
Monahan said. "There's an incred
ible amount of talent on the team,
and I'd like to see just how far we
can go."
