Four of Stanford's finest rid
ers qualified for nationals last
weekend in the zone and region
al competition held at the Stan
ford Red Barn and Spring Down
Equestrian Center in Woodside.
After a day of emotion and
surprise, junior Amanda Hoche
and sophomores Vanessa
Bartsch, Mark Gundersen and
Mandy Gillett emerged as Stan
ford's representatives at Mt.
Holyoke College in Mas
sachusetts May 3-4. More than
100 teams will be represented.
A celebrated win by Western
rider Gundersen makes him the
third consecutive walk / jog com
petitor to take the zone berth
under coach Karine Bodouin.
"At the beginning of the sea
son I thought about the title a
lot," Gundersen said, "but when
I actually went out there, I
didn't think of it at all. I don't
know what more I could have
done."
Western team president
Bartsch qualified in intermedi
ate stock seat after placing sec
ond at regionals. Bartsch noted
that the caliber of riders from
Fresno State, Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, UC-Davis, Cal Poly-
Pomona, UC-San Diego, USC
and San Diego was extremely
competitive, which raised the
stress levels.
At nationals, she will find her
self under dual pressure because
competition will be held in Mas
sachusetts â€” her home state.
"Now I need a flashier shirt to

wear," Bartsch said. "I need
sequins for luck."
English team president Hoche
said Spring Down Equestrian
Center was the ideal competition
facility for the English phase.
"They let us use their horses,
and it is a beautiful stable," she
said. "The jumps were nice as
was the arena. And they had a
great sound system."
Although emotions ran high
as in the novice division, three of
four competitors in regionals
were Cardinal riders and only
two could qualify for zones, mak
ing it difficult for all involved.
"I was ecstatic for those who
qualified and wanted to cry for
those who didn't," Hoche said.
Sophomores Kathleen Gilbert,
Lynne Chou and Ann Carney
were vying for two regional spots.
Only Carney qualified by win
ning second place. But at zones,
Carney narrowly missed qualify
ing for nationals by one place,
finishing third.
Team members were sur
prised that Gilbert didn't qualify
for nationals after she skillfully
contended with a tough horse
who bucked throughout the class
and tested her control. But
Gilbert neglected to halt as part
of the test, a mistake that
dropped her to fourth place.
"Kathleen is an all-around
solid rider," Hoche said. "She
really held it together in the
class. She was totally determined
and persistent despite the crap
[the horse] was giving her."
