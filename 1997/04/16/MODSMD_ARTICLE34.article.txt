After a long road trip last weekend against Ari
zona and Arizona State and with visions of top
ranked UCLA and USC in the near future, the
Stanford men's tennis team still found time to
knock off another Pacific 10 Conference rival as it.
cruised by California yesterday (>-1 at Tan he Fam
ily Tennis Stadium.
The Card's dominance began in doubles, as it
swept Cal across the board. At the No. 1 position,
freshman brothers Hob and Mike Bryan breezed
past David Sutton and Chris Santoso 8-.'}.
In the other two doubles matches of the day,
senior Grant Elliott and freshman Geoff Abrams
outplayed Nathan Jackmon and Alex Seuer 9-7.
Juniors Misha Palacek and Charles Iloeveler eked
out a win as well, taking out Adam Cross and
Minh Le 9-7.
In singles, Stanford won three matches easily

said. "But Bob and Mike won
easily in the singles, and we got
those first points pretty fast."
The Bryan brothers, as well
as Elliott, cruised past the Bears
in straight sets in singles. Bob
Bryan knocked off Seuer 6-1, 6-
1, while Mike Bryan cruised by
Jackmon 6-3, 6-2. Elliott had an
easy day as well, defeating Le 6-
3, 6-3.
At the No. 1 position, Wolters,
ranked 12th in the country,
fought back from a 6-4 loss in
the second set to finish off San
toso 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Abrams bat
tled to victory from behind as
well, when he overcame a first
set loss to defeat Sutton 2-6, 7-5,
7-5.
Rounding out the singles for
the Card was Hoeveler, who fell
to Fernando in three sets 7-6, 3-
6, 6-4.
The victory for the Card

improved its record to an
impressive 20-2, while Cal fell to
9-11. The squad also boosted its
Pac-10 mark to 9-1.
While the Card may not have
enjoyed its best day against the
Golden Bears, it was good
enough, as the squad looked to
save its energy for the big
matches this weekend against
UCLA and USC. The Bruins
handed Stanford its only confer
ence loss of the season during
the squad's trip to Westwood
earlier this month.
"Not everyone is feeling well
today; a few of the guys have
been a little sick, and I think we
are definitely thinking about
next weekend," Elliott said.
That's easy to do, considering
it is the biggest weekend of the
Card's home season. Stanford
will host its final matches at
home against USC Friday at
1:30 p.m. and Saturday against
UCLA at noon. Both will be key
matches for Stanford's record
with the NCAA Championships
approaching in mid-May.
