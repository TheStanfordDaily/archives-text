Freshman Lilia Osterloh has wasted little time estab
lishing herself as one of the Pacific 10 Conference's top
singles threats. Playing at the No. 1 spot for the second
ranked Cardinal (24-1, 8-0 Pac-10 South), Osterloh led the
squad to a pair of victories over No. 8 Arizona State and
No. 14 Arizona last weekend. On Friday, she toppled the
third-ranked singles player in the nation, cruising past
junior Wildcat Vicky Maes 6-2, 6-4. Osterloh dispelled any
notions of a fluke upset the following day by dispatching
the Sun Devils' top player, No. 18 Reka Cseresnyes, 6-3, 6-
4 for a second consecutive straight-set win.

On a team full of stars, senior Matt Fuerbringer dis
tinguished himself this week by being not merely good
but perfect. Playing at outside hitter for the No 4 Car
dinal (21-3, 15-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation),
the All-American has shined all season. However in Sat
urday afternoon's 15-7, 15-2, 15-10 victory over I'd
San Diego, Fuerbringer was untouchable, hitting a
flawless 1.000 for the match. He recorded 13 kills, the
second highest on the>squad behind only senior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer's 16 as Stanford completed a per
fect regular season at home.
