# Softball travels to San Jose State
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The softhall team hopes to
use today's games against San
Jose State to get back on track
after a pair of losses last week
end at the bands of 20th-ranked
California. The Cardinal will
play a twinbill against tbe Spar
tans at Twin Creeks in Sunny
vale witb tbe first game begin
ning at 2 p.m.
Stanford suffered a key setback
in last weekend's doubleheader,
witb its normally outstanding
pitching staff getting bit hard by
the Golden Bears.
Cal "bit tbe ball well, and every
time they bit it solid, tbe ball
found the gaps," said sophomore
pitcher Marcy Crouch.
The Golden Bears scored a
total of 18 runs in the two games,
which featured a number of Stan
ford errors. The Card had been
virtually error-free in the previous
lew games.
In addition, Cardinal pitchers
often found themselves behind in
the count, giving the Cal hitters a
daunting advantage.
"I wasn't getting the calls on a
lot of pitches that were on the cor
ners, and this allowed the Cal
players to wait for their pitches,"
Crouch said.
Sophomore pitcher Becky
Blevins and Crouch have been
strong on tbe mound almost the
entire year, and last weekend's
pitching problems should prove an
anomaly. Expect the Cardinal to
be strong on tbe mound today.
At the plate the squad is defi
nitely coming around, a few minor
setbacks are part of the process of
finding their offensive rhythm. In
game one against the Bears, the
Card could only muster two runs,
coming off a home run by sopho
more shortstop Michelle Schnei
der.
In game two however, tbe

squad stepped up its production,
hammering out seven runs in a
one-run heartbreaker. In the last
seven or eight games the team's
run production has increased, yet
the general consensus among the
players is that there is still room

for improvement.
San Jose State has done well
recently, playing second-ranked
Fresno State tough in recent per
formances. Today's game should
be intense, with the Cardinal
needing a pair of wins to keep the

prospect of regionals alive.
"I think we all still feel we are
in strong contention to make
regionals," Crouch said. "We just
have to win the rest of our non
conference games and some of our
conference ones."
