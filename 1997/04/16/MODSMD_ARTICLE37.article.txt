### Allison Hays 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team (10-9) ral
lied this weekend at the Western States Tourna
ment in Santa Cruz, Calif., winning two of its four
matches to finish fourth. There were 38 teams at
the tournament, which ran Saturday and Sunday.
The field included a wide variety of opponents in a
range of states from the South to the West, repre
senting a growing interest in the tournament in
general.
The Cardinal played three of its tournament
games on Saturday, first battling Colorado State, a
much weaker team, and winning easily 15-4. Stan
ford's strong start in the tournament helped it play
aggressively throughout. The first match was high
lighted by the play of freshman center Janet Lewis,
whose agility and ball control resulted in three
goals, two assists, three ground ball recoveries and
four draw controls. Freshman Hedy Born, a consis
tently potent player, had a perfect shooting game,
converting all four of her attempts into goals.
The Cardinal next had a heated showdown with
UC-Davis, whom it bitterly lost to the previous
weekend. The game was close throughout, and with
the score tied 4-4 in the remaining five minutes of
the game, the Aggies scored to steal a 5-4 win. Still,
senior goalkeeper Susan Fan defended 15 of 20
attempts in one of the best games of her career.
Although Stanford lost to Davis, the team was
satisfied with its advances in playing.
"The team that played against Davis last Satur
day and the team that showed up this weekend were
two completely different teams," said assistant
coach Heidi Connor. "It seems as though the team
has jelled and really come together as a group in one
week's time."
Sophomore Carey Jones shares her optimism at
the improved play.
"Our defense was better, and our offensive down
field passing was better than it's been all year," she
said.
Stanford was defeated 8-4 by the NorCal Club in
its last match Saturday. The loss was largely due to
the level of play of the Card's competitors, who were
mostly post-collegiate athletes graduated from high
caliber East Coast programs. Outstanding in this
game were freshman defender Christina Gilyutin
and Born, who led the team in scoring.

The Cardinal topped off the tournament with a
win against Colorado 12-5. The domination of the
Buffaloes was aided by freshman Merete Rietvald,
who stunned the field with one goal, two assists, five
ground balls, and two interceptions.
Overall, Stanford had a strong showingin the
tournament. The Cardinal's next game is at Cali
fornia April 19. The outcome will determine
which team gets the No. 2 seed in the Western
Women's Lacrosse League playoffs.
