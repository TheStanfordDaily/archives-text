# Miscommunication, staff problems contribute to yearbook delay
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
As memories of college wane in the
years after graduation, yearbooks revive
lost years. Last year's seniors, however,
better hope that their memories can last
for a few more months without the Stan
ford Quad.
The 95-96 yearbook will come out in
mid-June this year, about seven months
late. Yearbooks from the previous acade
mic year are usually released in Novem
ber of the following year, so that com
mencement photos can be included.
It is unclear what effect last year's
delay will have on this year's book. Al
though those involved currently are opti
mistic, some students see the delay of last
year's book as indicative of greater prob
lems in the way in which the yearbook is
produced.
According to senior Bobby Chen, last
year's yearbook editor, the delay was
caused by problems of staff management

and miscommunication with Jostens, the
printing company.
The yearbook's staff has traditionally
been small, Chen said. His staff last year
included only seven or eight people during
the year. During the summer Chen and
Tony Lin, this year's editor, were left to
finish the book.
One of the problems, Chen said, is that
dropout rates among staff are high.
"It is difficult to recruit new staff,"
Chen said. "With all of their other com
mitments, people see yearbook as not that
important. We had a problem with [re
maining] people having to take on more
than they could."
According to junior Garth Patil, who
was one of two photo editors for last year's
Quad, the yearbook was "really under
staffed."
There were only two photographers for
the entire yearbook, Patil said. He added
because the Quad is mostly photos, and 10
shots are usually needed to ensure one
good print, each photographer took be

tween 5,000 and 10,000 photos during
the course of the last academic year and
summer.
In addition, "there were problems with
the management of staff," said Nanci
Howe, director of the Office of Student
Activities, which oversees all student or
ganizations, including the Quad.
"Tony and Bobby have been working
together to address these problems,"
Howe added.
The already-delayed yearbook was
slowed further when, because of miscom
munication with Jostens, many proofs
sent during the summer were lost last
quarter. The proofs were sent to a mai 1 -
box that the Quad normally does not use.
According to Chen, the proofs then sat
in the mailbox for weeks until anotuer
person informed him that they were
there.
The yearbook has also been plagued by
financial problems for the past five to six
years, debts that it hopes to absolve, Lin
said.

Yearbook editors "have been trying to
minimize the deficit," Lin said, although
editors could not prevent another deficit
four years ago.
"We've been in the red since then,"
Chen said.
In order to cut costs, the staff of the
Quad, including Lin, will no longer be
paid.
Despite last year's delays and budget
problems, Lin predicts that this year's
yearbook will be on time. He feels ready to
meet his first deadline at the end of this
month, despite the fact that last year's
book has "pushed [this year's book] back"
in production.
"The most important thing is that the
book comes out on time," Lin said. How
ever, we don't want to compromise quali
ty, either."
Because of debt and the delay, this
year's book "has to be simple," Lin added.
Patil, with 10 other people including
freshman Jennifer Zwarich, junior Mark
Leibowitz and junior Sally Rosen, is in the

process of writing a proposal to Howe and
the senior class that calls for greater stu
dent participation in the yearbook, coordi
nation between the yearbook and the se
nior class presidents and more marketing
of the Quad to alumni.
"The yearbook should be a student-in
volved project," Patil said. "There has
never been a major effort to get students
involved. The Quad doesn't hold open
meetings or go to activities fairs."
Howe said she would "like to see more
communication between the yearbook
and the senior class and alumni."
Meanwhile, the task of talking to angry
alumni, students and parents who want
their yearbooks has fallen on Lin, Chen
and Howe.
Refunds will be given to those who re
quest them, Lin said.
"We have no right to keep their money
if they no longer want the book," Lin said.
However, people have been accommo
dating and no one has requested a refund
at this point, Chen said.
