# Charges filed in graffiti case
## Senior Lunn faces a misdemeanor in Suites eating club vandalism 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Stanford senior and track team
member Jason Lunn now faces
charges for the April 7 anti-gay van
dalism of a Suites eating club. Police
said he has admitted his role in the
incident, and they expect him to
turn himself in, perhaps as early as
today.
Asst. Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney Karyn Sinunu said a
misdemeanor vandalism complaint
was filed against Lunn yesterday
and that the maximum sentence
would be a year in prison and a
$1,000 fine.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said Lunn's bail would be
set at $1,000 once police have him in
custody.
Sinunu said the crime could not
legally be designated a hate crime
because the damage cost less than
$5,000 to repair and therefore can
not be considered a felony, which in
turn precludes hate crime charges.
"I believe it is a hate crime, but
there's no I legal 1 provision for
that," Sinunu said. "It's with deep
regret that I can't charge a hate
crime."
She added that "the public is

going to be dissatisfied" that hate
crime charges are not filed.
She said her official complaint
against Lunn contained verbatim
several of the anti-gay slogans that
appeared on the walls of The Bol
lard eating club. This inclusion as
sures that, if convicted, Lunn's per
manent record will include evidence
of the nature of the vandalism, Sin
unu said.
Although this would mark
Lunn's first offense, Sinunu said
she hoped he would serve time in jail
if convicted.
"The person who did this de
servos to be punished," Sinunu said.
Lunn declined to comment on
the charges.
If indeed a Stanford student
committed the vandalism, it could
constitute a Fundamental Stan
dard violation.
1 )ean of Students Marc Wais said
his office "has been notified of this
development," and that "the Office
of Judicial Affairs will immediately
begin its investigation to determine
wlu>t her this alleged activity consti
tutes a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard."
Wais said it would be inappropri-
