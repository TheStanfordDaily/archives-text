# Exorbitant costs for housing turn off some faculty
## 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
Stanford prides itself on hav
ing some of the best professors in
the world. However, some junior
and visiting faculty say Stanford
may be driving away promising
young faculty by not offering aid
in renting houses in the area.
Due to the high-priced housing
market in the Stanford area,
many faculty need assistance in
finding and paying for housing.
While the Faculty / Staff I lousing
Office provides substantial help
for those looking to buy, it offers
little or no help to those looking
just to rent.
The office recognizes the prob
lems high housingcosts in the May
Area create for residents, and it
working on ways toombat the
problem.
The University "leaves you to
the free market wolves," said Dale
Maharidge, a visiting lecturer in
communication.
From Columbia to Stanford
Maharidge taught at Columbia
University before coming to Stan
ford five years ago. Hesaid the dif
ference in the assistance he re
ceived there was staggering.
"When I was at Columbia, they
bent over backward," Maharidge

said. "Here, I was laughed at
when I asked if there was
any help for renting."
At Columbia, Maharidge was
rented an apartment on the west
side of Manhattan with a beauti
ful view, he said. His rent at the
time was only $6(50 per month —
well below the market value.
"At Columbia, they wanted to
help their professors," he said.
Stanford provided much less
help. The University let him rent
in Pearce Mitchell, an area of fac
ulty condominiums across from
the Row. He said he had to pay
much more for rent compared to
Now York.
Recently, he moved to an even
smaller apartment when he was
told his rent would be raised to
$1,400 per month. According to
Maharidge, the University forced
his landlord to sell the apartment
to Stanford as his landlord owned
more than one apartment in the
complex. When the University
said they would raise his rent, he
was forced to move into another
unit. In the smaller apartment, he
is still paying about $1,100 per
month.
"How can new faculty with a
lower salary schedule afford to
come here?" Maharidge asked.
"This angers more than it sad-
dens me. Maybe a lot of faculty
won't come here."
Stanford's lack of assistance
Like Maharidge, many faculty
and staff have found little comfort
from the faculty and staff housing
office.
Some faculty renters say they
received little or no financial help
from the faculty and staff housing
office. Several faculty said the of
fice even suggested the faculty ask
their parents for financial assis
tance.
Yet, many of the young faculty
still have their college loans, which
they cannot pay off immediately.
Some have only a single income,
and even those with a double in
come still cannot afford the high
rates in purchasing a home.
"They presume that you can af
ford to purchase a home," said
Asst. Prof, of Spanish and Por
tuguese Claire Fox. "But many of
the young faculty cannot afford
to."
The housing office does not
deny their lack of assistance in cer
tain of these situations. They do
feel, however, that they offer the
best advice and help possible.
Expensive housing market
Some of the housing problems
are linked to the fact that San Jose
and the Bay Area are both expen
sive places to live. A 1991 analysis
by the San Francisco Chronicle in
cluded three area counties — San
Francisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties — as having the
most expensive homes in Califor
nia. According to a recent analysis
of the Des Moines Register, San
Jose topped the list as being the
metropolitan area with the high
est rental rates.
Many faculty say the University
does not help faculty enough to
overcome these high costs.
The problem of trying to find a
reasonable place to rent is more
prevalent with junior faculty.
Many do not have the money to
buy a home, and others arejust not
ready to purchase a home.
According to Carolyn Sargent,

manager for the Faculty / Staff
Housing Program, the housing of
fice has no authority to do any
thing to change the lack of rental
housing available. She also says
that the small number of rentals
controlled by the faculty and staff
housing must follow the market.
"Things have to be at the mar
ket rates or else it results in tax
consequences," Sargent said.
Without a reasonably priced
place to live, faculty may be forced
to commute.
"I think it's important to be
around," Maharidge said. "Profes
sors can give a quality education
for students when they can meet
with students more often. If I live
far away, my students are going to
suffer."
Other schools
Other universities say their fac
ulty housing is subject to market
forces as well. However, they make
a conscious effort to help out their
renting faculty.
Princeton University Asst. Di
rector of Housing for Faculty and
Staff Coe Evans said at Princeton,
some units are below the market
price, but most are not.
"We charge about what's
charged in the commercial range.
It used to be a real deal, but it has
gradually changed over the last 10
to 15 years," Evans said.
Harvard University's rental
rates also coincide with the mar
ket. The Harvard Planning and
Real Estate Office also finds prob
lems among the junior faculty.
However, Harvard provides a sub
sidy for rentals for thejunior facul
ty.
In contrast, Columbia Univer
sity offers lower rental rates to
their faculty, according to Colum
bia's Asst. Director of Housing Re
ferral Services Laura Scrota. The
university owns a lot of real estate,
Serota said, and rent rates are
lower than rates for similar hous
ing in the surrounding area.
Columbia also offers a discount
in rent for assistant professors.
This temporary assistance is avail
able for each professor for seven
years. The rates are then in
creased.
Faculty rentals
Although Stanford has no spe

cial programs for renters, it does
offer a listing of rentals available
on campus and in the surrounding
area. However, this may not be
enough.
"I need more assistance than is
currently available," Fox said. She
used the housing office to help find
apartment listings in campus and
around the area but received no
further help from them.
The University has 864
dwelling units for their faculty, ac
cording to Housing Programs
Manager Barbara Klein. These
units are located in Pearce
Mitchell, Peter Coutts and other
condominiums. Robinson & Co, an
outside contractor, has been desig
nated by the University to manage
the University-owned rentals on
campus. Other rentals are private
ly owned and managed by Stan
ford affiliates.
The area of faculty housing
roughly between Page Mill Road,
Campus Drive and Junipero Serra
is informally referred to as the fac
ulty ghetto. The Faculty / Staff
Housing Office views this name as
a "term of fondness," according to
Sargent.
According to Klein, of the 1460
current active faculty, 787 own
their dwelling place and 89 rent.
Of the owners, 490 own a resi
dence on campus. The other 584
are not accounted for because they
have not sought any assistance
from the University.
Buying in the area
For those faculty members who
wish to purchase a home, Stan
ford's programs to assist in buying
a home can be very attractive and
helpful, according to some profes
sors who have participated in the
various programs.
The first of three programs is
the Housing Allowance Program
— a taxable fringe benefit that,
under special conditions, provides
additional compensation to newly
hired faculty and senior staff for
nine years after their initial home
is purchased. The home must also
be within a 15-mile radius of the
university.
The second program, the Down
Payment Assistance Program,
provides a loan of up to half of the
minimum required down pay
ment.

Another program, the Lathrop
Loan, is a second mortgage with
low but escalating current inter
est payments and contingent in
terest based on property apprecia
tion. To qualify for these pro
grams, a person must first meet
eligibility requirements.
Ted Glasser, assistant profes
sor of communication, bought a
house three years ago in Palo Alto
using the Down Payment and the
Second Mortgage plans. He said he
found the housing programs enor
mously helpful.

"I couldn't have otherwise af
forded real estate in this area,"
Glasser said. "It made every differ
ence."
The reason that it so much eas
ier to buy than to rent is a decision
reached by the Provost's office, ac
cording to Sargent.
"The University must allocate a
scarce resource," she said, adding
that because the University does
not have the funds to provide both
purchase and rental assistance,
they feel one must be chosen over
the other. Their feeling is that it is
most effective to provide buying
assistance in recruiting and re

taining faculty and staff.
Although some other universi
ties are more helpful when it
comes to renting, Stanford's buy
ing programs seems to be one of
the best offered.
For example, Harvard has no
housing specifically for faculty.
The university owns 2,300 apart
ments that are available for gradu
ate students, faculty and staff.
Harvard helps its faculty decide
where to buy through a program
with local real estate agents, ac
cording to Susan Keller, director of
residential real estate at the Har
vard Planning and Real Estate Of
fice.
Columbia also works with out
side businesses to provide help for
their faculty. They have no specif
ic university programs, but they
have a local mortgage lender that
offers special rates to the faculty
and staff at Columbia. Other
lenders also provide competition
and offer special rates.
Current projects
Presently, the Stanford's Fac
ulty / Staff Housing Office said
they are working on several pro
jects.
Sargent said the office will be
conducting a survey to see how
they are doing. It also plans to look
at different programs at other uni
versities.
"Our basic purpose is to serve
our clients," Sargent said. "But we
have tight guidelines that we have
to follow."
The office especially wishes to
cut down on the possibility that
good faculty could be lost due to
the high cost of area housing.
"We are concerned about it,"
Sargent said. "It is a problem re
cruiting and retaining people be
cause of housing."
The Faculty and Staff Housing
Office also plans to investigate in
creasing the amount of rentals for
junior faculty.
"Our philosophy is to help, not
to subsidize," Sargent said. "We
try to customize special needs."
Despite recent complaints, Sar
gent says 80 to 90 percent of those
surveyed rate their experiences as
very good or excellent.
"We can't reach 100 percent,
but we can reach the vast majori
ty," Sargent said.

For example, Harvard has no
housing specifically for faculty.
The university owns 2,300 apart
ments that are available for gradu
ate students, faculty and staff.
Harvard helps its faculty decide
where to buy through a program
with local real estate agents, ac
cording to Susan Keller, director of
residential real estate at the Har
vard Planning and Real Estate Of
fice.
Columbia also works with out
side businesses to provide help for
their faculty. They have no specif
ic university programs, but they
have a local mortgage lender that
offers special rates to the faculty
and staff at Columbia. Other
lenders also provide competition
and offer special rates.
Current projects
Presently, the Stanford's Fac
ulty / Staff Housing Office said
they are working on several pro
jects.
Sargent said the office will be
conducting a survey to see how
they are doing. It also plans to look
at different programs at other uni
versities.
"Our basic purpose is to serve
our clients," Sargent said. "But we
have tight guidelines that we have
to follow."
The office especially wishes to
cut down on the possibility that
good faculty could be lost due to
the high cost of area housing.
"We are concerned about it,"
Sargent said. "It is a problem re
cruiting and retaining people be
cause of housing."
The Faculty and Staff Housing
Office also plans to investigate in
creasing the amount of rentals for
junior faculty.
"Our philosophy is to help, not
to subsidize," Sargent said. "We
try to customize special needs."
Despite recent complaints, Sar
gent says 80 to 90 percent of those
surveyed rate their experiences as
very good or excellent.
"We can't reach 100 percent,
but we can reach the vast majori
ty," Sargent said.

The University provides some
housing for faculty, such as
these Pearce Mitchell apart
ments just off Mayfield Avenue.
Stanford prides itself on hav
ing some of the best professors in
the world. However, some junior
and visiting faculty say Stanford
may be driving away promising
young faculty by not offering aid
in renting houses in the area.
Due to the high-priced housing
market in the Stanford area,
many faculty need assistance in
finding and paying for housing.
While the Faculty / Staff I lousing
Office provides substantial help
for those looking to buy, it offers
little or no help to those looking
just to rent.
The office recognizes the prob
lems high housingcosts in the May
Area create for residents, and it
working on ways toombat the
problem.
The University "leaves you to
the free market wolves," said Dale
Maharidge, a visiting lecturer in
communication.
From Columbia to Stanford
Maharidge taught at Columbia
University before coming to Stan
ford five years ago. Hesaid the dif
ference in the assistance he re
ceived there was staggering.
"When I was at Columbia, they
bent over backward," Maharidge

said. "Here, I was laughed at
when I asked if there was
any help for renting."
At Columbia, Maharidge was
rented an apartment on the west
side of Manhattan with a beauti
ful view, he said. His rent at the
time was only $6(50 per month —
well below the market value.
"At Columbia, they wanted to
help their professors," he said.
Stanford provided much less
help. The University let him rent
in Pearce Mitchell, an area of fac
ulty condominiums across from
the Row. He said he had to pay
much more for rent compared to
Now York.
Recently, he moved to an even
smaller apartment when he was
told his rent would be raised to
$1,400 per month. According to
Maharidge, the University forced
his landlord to sell the apartment
to Stanford as his landlord owned
more than one apartment in the
complex. When the University
said they would raise his rent, he
was forced to move into another
unit. In the smaller apartment, he
is still paying about $1,100 per
month.
"How can new faculty with a
lower salary schedule afford to
come here?" Maharidge asked.
"This angers more than it sad-
dens me. Maybe a lot of faculty
won't come here."
Stanford's lack of assistance
Like Maharidge, many faculty
and staff have found little comfort
from the faculty and staff housing
office.
Some faculty renters say they
received little or no financial help
from the faculty and staff housing
office. Several faculty said the of
fice even suggested the faculty ask
their parents for financial assis
tance.
Yet, many of the young faculty
still have their college loans, which
they cannot pay off immediately.
Some have only a single income,
and even those with a double in
come still cannot afford the high
rates in purchasing a home.
"They presume that you can af
ford to purchase a home," said
Asst. Prof, of Spanish and Por
tuguese Claire Fox. "But many of
the young faculty cannot afford
to."
The housing office does not
deny their lack of assistance in cer
tain of these situations. They do
feel, however, that they offer the
best advice and help possible.
Expensive housing market
Some of the housing problems
are linked to the fact that San Jose
and the Bay Area are both expen
sive places to live. A 1991 analysis
by the San Francisco Chronicle in
cluded three area counties — San
Francisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties — as having the
most expensive homes in Califor
nia. According to a recent analysis
of the Des Moines Register, San
Jose topped the list as being the
metropolitan area with the high
est rental rates.
Many faculty say the University
does not help faculty enough to
overcome these high costs.
The problem of trying to find a
reasonable place to rent is more
prevalent with junior faculty.
Many do not have the money to
buy a home, and others arejust not
ready to purchase a home.
According to Carolyn Sargent,

manager for the Faculty / Staff
Housing Program, the housing of
fice has no authority to do any
thing to change the lack of rental
housing available. She also says
that the small number of rentals
controlled by the faculty and staff
housing must follow the market.
"Things have to be at the mar
ket rates or else it results in tax
consequences," Sargent said.
Without a reasonably priced
place to live, faculty may be forced
to commute.
"I think it's important to be
around," Maharidge said. "Profes
sors can give a quality education
for students when they can meet
with students more often. If I live
far away, my students are going to
suffer."
Other schools
Other universities say their fac
ulty housing is subject to market
forces as well. However, they make
a conscious effort to help out their
renting faculty.
Princeton University Asst. Di
rector of Housing for Faculty and
Staff Coe Evans said at Princeton,
some units are below the market
price, but most are not.
"We charge about what's
charged in the commercial range.
It used to be a real deal, but it has
gradually changed over the last 10
to 15 years," Evans said.
Harvard University's rental
rates also coincide with the mar
ket. The Harvard Planning and
Real Estate Office also finds prob
lems among the junior faculty.
However, Harvard provides a sub
sidy for rentals for thejunior facul
ty.
In contrast, Columbia Univer
sity offers lower rental rates to
their faculty, according to Colum
bia's Asst. Director of Housing Re
ferral Services Laura Scrota. The
university owns a lot of real estate,
Serota said, and rent rates are
lower than rates for similar hous
ing in the surrounding area.
Columbia also offers a discount
in rent for assistant professors.
This temporary assistance is avail
able for each professor for seven
years. The rates are then in
creased.
Faculty rentals
Although Stanford has no spe

cial programs for renters, it does
offer a listing of rentals available
on campus and in the surrounding
area. However, this may not be
enough.
"I need more assistance than is
currently available," Fox said. She
used the housing office to help find
apartment listings in campus and
around the area but received no
further help from them.
The University has 864
dwelling units for their faculty, ac
cording to Housing Programs
Manager Barbara Klein. These
units are located in Pearce
Mitchell, Peter Coutts and other
condominiums. Robinson & Co, an
outside contractor, has been desig
nated by the University to manage
the University-owned rentals on
campus. Other rentals are private
ly owned and managed by Stan
ford affiliates.
The area of faculty housing
roughly between Page Mill Road,
Campus Drive and Junipero Serra
is informally referred to as the fac
ulty ghetto. The Faculty / Staff
Housing Office views this name as
a "term of fondness," according to
Sargent.
According to Klein, of the 1460
current active faculty, 787 own
their dwelling place and 89 rent.
Of the owners, 490 own a resi
dence on campus. The other 584
are not accounted for because they
have not sought any assistance
from the University.
Buying in the area
For those faculty members who
wish to purchase a home, Stan
ford's programs to assist in buying
a home can be very attractive and
helpful, according to some profes
sors who have participated in the
various programs.
The first of three programs is
the Housing Allowance Program
— a taxable fringe benefit that,
under special conditions, provides
additional compensation to newly
hired faculty and senior staff for
nine years after their initial home
is purchased. The home must also
be within a 15-mile radius of the
university.
The second program, the Down
Payment Assistance Program,
provides a loan of up to half of the
minimum required down pay
ment.

Another program, the Lathrop
Loan, is a second mortgage with
low but escalating current inter
est payments and contingent in
terest based on property apprecia
tion. To qualify for these pro
grams, a person must first meet
eligibility requirements.
Ted Glasser, assistant profes
sor of communication, bought a
house three years ago in Palo Alto
using the Down Payment and the
Second Mortgage plans. He said he
found the housing programs enor
mously helpful.

"I couldn't have otherwise af
forded real estate in this area,"
Glasser said. "It made every differ
ence."
The reason that it so much eas
ier to buy than to rent is a decision
reached by the Provost's office, ac
cording to Sargent.
"The University must allocate a
scarce resource," she said, adding
that because the University does
not have the funds to provide both
purchase and rental assistance,
they feel one must be chosen over
the other. Their feeling is that it is
most effective to provide buying
assistance in recruiting and re

taining faculty and staff.
Although some other universi
ties are more helpful when it
comes to renting, Stanford's buy
ing programs seems to be one of
the best offered.
For example, Harvard has no
housing specifically for faculty.
The university owns 2,300 apart
ments that are available for gradu
ate students, faculty and staff.
Harvard helps its faculty decide
