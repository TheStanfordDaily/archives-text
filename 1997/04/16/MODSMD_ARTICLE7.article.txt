# Exorbitant costs for housing turn off some faculty

Stanford prides itself on hav
ing some of the best professors in
the world. However, some junior
and visiting faculty say Stanford
may be driving away promising
young faculty by not offering aid
in renting houses in the area.
Due to the high-priced housing
market in the Stanford area,
many faculty need assistance in
finding and paying for housing.
While the Faculty / Staff I lousing
Office provides substantial help
for those looking to buy, it offers
little or no help to those looking
just to rent.
The office recognizes the prob
lems high housingcosts in the May
Area create for residents, and it
working on ways toombat the
problem.
The University "leaves you to
the free market wolves," said Dale
Maharidge, a visiting lecturer in
communication.
From Columbia to Stanford
Maharidge taught at Columbia
University before coming to Stan
ford five years ago. Hesaid the dif
ference in the assistance he re
ceived there was staggering.
"When I was at Columbia, they
bent over backward," Maharidge

said. "Here, I was laughed at
when I asked if there was
any help for renting."
At Columbia, Maharidge was
rented an apartment on the west
side of Manhattan with a beauti
ful view, he said. His rent at the
time was only $6(50 per month â€”
well below the market value.
"At Columbia, they wanted to
help their professors," he said.
Stanford provided much less
help. The University let him rent
in Pearce Mitchell, an area of fac
ulty condominiums across from
the Row. He said he had to pay
much more for rent compared to
Now York.
Recently, he moved to an even
smaller apartment when he was
told his rent would be raised to
$1,400 per month. According to
Maharidge, the University forced
his landlord to sell the apartment
to Stanford as his landlord owned
more than one apartment in the
complex. When the University
said they would raise his rent, he
was forced to move into another
unit. In the smaller apartment, he
is still paying about $1,100 per
month.
"How can new faculty with a
lower salary schedule afford to
come here?" Maharidge asked.
"This angers more than it sad-
