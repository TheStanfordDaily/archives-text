## 
### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
With events today through May 2, the
Women's Coalition and the ASSU will
sponsor Herstory, a series of events fo
cusing on women at Stanford and
around the world.
Events will include musical perfor
mances, speakers, movies and auto
maintenance classes, all of which are free
and open to the public.
"The pur ose of the series is to get the
Stanford a ..munity to celebrate women
and their acc> mplishments," said sopho
more Cathy Rion, one of the principal or
ganizers of Herstoiy.
The two-week series officially begins
on Friday with an opening ceremony at

noon in White Pl&za. However, there will
be two musical performances the night
before, including "Funky Folk Night" to
morrow, which features Stanford alum
na Allette Brooks.
"We hope that these are events that
people will enjoy," Rion said, "but which
will also get them thinking and encour
age them to get involved. Hopefully, the
program will expose people to things and
issues that we don't normally think
about."
Accordingto Rion, the annual Hersto
ry series will be more focused than in pre
vious years, centering around the theme
of women and image.
"The issue of image, which includes
the physical image of women, the way
women are portrayed in the media and

the way that they perceive themselves, is
one that touches everybody," Rion said.
"We definitely encourage both women
and men to attend since this is important
to everyone."
The keynote speaker will be Jean Kil
bourne, a media critic, writer, filmmaker
and award-winning lecturer. Kilbourne
will speak on April 23 in Memorial Audi
torium about the portrayal of women in
advertising and the effects that this por
trayal has on women's self images.
Because Herstory coincides with
Stanford Admit Weekend, there will be
several programs directed at potential
Stanford students. Admit Weekend is co
sponsoring "Funky P'olk Night" and a
Saturday panel titled "DE:Sumption
Women Beyond Labels."

The increased focus on the female
image is possible because of funding that
the Women's Center received from the
University in the past year.
"Now we are able to hold events year
round," Rion said, "which means that
with Herstory, we can focus more on spe
cific elements, such as body image. These
two weeks are when we actively reach
out to the Stanford community."
Another new addition to Herstory
this year is the broad range of support
from groups besides the Women's Coali
tion. Such diverse groups as Stanford
NOW, IJnidas, the Stanford Film Soci
ety, the Stanford Israel Alliance, the Cre
ative Writing Program, the Intersorority
Council and Sisters at Stanford are all
sponsoring 1 lerstory events.
