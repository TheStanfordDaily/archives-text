# Grad students fight depression

Sarah Smith, a third-year doc
toral student, has lived in a fog
most of her life. The numbness
has blocked out the traumatic
events of her childhood. Once the
fog finally lifts, the pain and de
pression begin.
Among Stanford students,
Smith (who requested that her
real name not be used) is not
alone.
Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services serves between 1,300
and 1,500 students per year.
"Most of the time, people come
in because they're experiencing a
stressful situation or having
trouble with themselves," said
Alejandro Martinez, the director
of CAPS. "Sometimes, it's al
most like people have dark glass
es and that's how they see the
world."
Martinez estimated that 60
percent of the students who ven
ture up to the second floor of Cow
ell for psychological treatment are
graduate students.
The darkness
Many students face temporary
periods of feeling blue, but for
some, the darkness lingers for
weeks, even months at a time.
"For two months, I was so
tired, I couldn't even get out of
bed," said electrical engineering
doctoral student Masumi Ya
mashita.
While Yamashita's condition
was an intense one-time event,

many students come to Stanford
with prior psychological problems.
"I think it started a long time
before Stanford," Smith said,
comparing her lack of emotion to a
fog. "The depression kind of fits
with other things. I guess I basi
cally had kind of a hard childhood.
I didn't quite realize this wasn't
normal. I was always sort of feel
ing very little."
She discovered different ways
to cope with her trauma.
"Eating and sleep would be my
comfort. Also, doing very well in
school was important."
Being at Stanford actually
made her more depressed.
"I came here and it got much
worse," Smith said. "The support
system was really lacking. Every
one was temporary. My first year
was quite bad. I began to realize I
was depressed."
The support networks
Martinez said the high propor
tion of graduate students seeking
guidance at CAPS may be attrib
uted to two main reasons: their
willingness to seek help and their
weak support networks, which
may exacerbate depression.
"The kind of life support that is
available for undergrads is more
communal," Martinez said. "They
can just drop by and talk |with
friends and dormmates|. Gradu
ate students are so much more in
dependent in their living situa
tions. They're often sharing space
rather than sharing their lives to
gether. They don't have the same
