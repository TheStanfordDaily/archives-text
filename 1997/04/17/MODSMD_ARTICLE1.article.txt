# Grad students fight depression
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Sarah Smith, a third-year doc
toral student, has lived in a fog
most of her life. The numbness
has blocked out the traumatic
events of her childhood. Once the
fog finally lifts, the pain and de
pression begin.
Among Stanford students,
Smith (who requested that her
real name not be used) is not
alone.
Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services serves between 1,300
and 1,500 students per year.
"Most of the time, people come
in because they're experiencing a
stressful situation or having
trouble with themselves," said
Alejandro Martinez, the director
of CAPS. "Sometimes, it's al
most like people have dark glass
es and that's how they see the
world."
Martinez estimated that 60
percent of the students who ven
ture up to the second floor of Cow
ell for psychological treatment are
graduate students.
The darkness
Many students face temporary
periods of feeling blue, but for
some, the darkness lingers for
weeks, even months at a time.
"For two months, I was so
tired, I couldn't even get out of
bed," said electrical engineering
doctoral student Masumi Ya
mashita.
While Yamashita's condition
was an intense one-time event,

many students come to Stanford
with prior psychological problems.
"I think it started a long time
before Stanford," Smith said,
comparing her lack of emotion to a
fog. "The depression kind of fits
with other things. I guess I basi
cally had kind of a hard childhood.
I didn't quite realize this wasn't
normal. I was always sort of feel
ing very little."
She discovered different ways
to cope with her trauma.
"Eating and sleep would be my
comfort. Also, doing very well in
school was important."
Being at Stanford actually
made her more depressed.
"I came here and it got much
worse," Smith said. "The support
system was really lacking. Every
one was temporary. My first year
was quite bad. I began to realize I
was depressed."
The support networks
Martinez said the high propor
tion of graduate students seeking
guidance at CAPS may be attrib
uted to two main reasons: their
willingness to seek help and their
weak support networks, which
may exacerbate depression.
"The kind of life support that is
available for undergrads is more
communal," Martinez said. "They
can just drop by and talk |with
friends and dormmates|. Gradu
ate students are so much more in
dependent in their living situa
tions. They're often sharing space
rather than sharing their lives to
gether. They don't have the same
extensive support network that
undergrads do."
Smith said she stayed at home
for three weeks "and no one no
ticed. That's the amazing thing.
No one wants to talk about emo
tions."
She lived in Rains her first
year at Stanford. With its palm
trees, she said it reminded her of
Melrose Place. However, she
soon found out that it was far
from her idea of an ideal living
situation.
"People don't want to bond,"
she said. "People are really serious
about their work. It's just a really
different atmosphere than the un
dergraduate atmosphere.
Last quarter, Peter Danczkay,
a master's student in petroleum
engineering, said he had cyclical
depressions about what he was
doing at Stanford, but the thought
of a Stanford degree kept him
here.
"You tend to overlook the
short-term hardships. I'm not
alone. Most people tend to stick it
out," Danczkay said.
Some people, however, find it to
be too much to handle. Yamashita
said she knew many students suf
fering clinical depression in si
lence.
"In the worst cases, they disap
pear," Yamashita said. "They
don't even know that they can
reach out. They're so deprived of
energy that they can't even
move."
A few of the students who seek
help are advised to focus less on
school and more on the other as
pects of life.
"Sometimes, they have to take
•some personal time away from
Stanford," Martinez said.
This may include stopping out
or transferring.

The pressures of graduate life
The transition from under
graduate to graduate life, where
the orientation programs and so
cial opportunities are not as exten
sive, may contribute to the isola
tion and loneliness that can aggra
vate depression. Many new gradu
ate students feel they are moving
into a new stage of life alone.
"I think students certainly feel
challenges of graduate life, the
first year in particular," Martinez
said. "I don't think it's particular
ly being at Stanford.
"A lot of what | graduate stu
dents] are doing is on their own,"
Martinez said. "Again, there's a
lot of isolation and loneliness."
For upper-level graduate stu
dents who spend most of their
time writing dissertations, their
adviser's opinion may be the only
performance measurement they
have.
"Emotions are not highly val
ued. People doing work are highly
valued, no matter what kind of
mess your life is in," Smith said.
Yamashita agreed. "We are
constantly worried about how our
adviser will evaluate us. We want
some authority to consider us
good enough. I think most Stan
ford students expect a lot from
themselves."
The treatment
Smith sought out a counselor at
CAPS her first year at Stanford.
Through therapy, her fog lifted —
but contrary to her expectations,
the depression didn't. She needed
long-term treatment. Students
are only allowed 10 CAPS sessions
per academic year. CAPS referred
her off-campus for further coun
seling.
"It's so unfair that I couldn't
get help," Smith said. "You're re
ally sick and you want someone to
help you. That's all I did some
weeks was to go to therapy. That, I
think, was a life-saver."
Depression is often linked with

other illnesses, such as eating dis
orders, substance abuse and anxi
ety disorders, which sometimes
makes it difficult to diagnose.
During her depression two
years ago, Yamashita saw three
doctors. Two diagnosed her with
depression and told her to take
anti-depressant medication. The
third said she had a virus that dis
played depression-like symptoms.
"Probably, it was very much
stress related," Yamashita said.
For some people, the root of the
problem has not been as easy to
identify.
"When I look back, I realized
how depressed I was, but I
couldn't express it," Smith said.
She said she has just started to
feel more emotion within the last
six months, but it has been a
painful road.
"I was in a fog for such a long
time, and I'm just starting to
break out," she said.
Between 80 and 90 percent of
people with clinical depression re
spond to treatment, which may in
clude prescribed medication com
bined with therapy.
Smith has tried many different
medications, but she could never
tell if they had any direct effect.
"I guess some people feel mirac
ulous changes," Smith said.
Yamashita said she responded
well to her medication. However,
she was quick to point out that the
medication alone solved nothing.
She had to make changes in her
life in order to get at the root of her
depression.
"In my case, my situation actu
ally improved," Yamashita said. "I
switched my adviser. That was the
real difference for me. It was the
difference between black and
white."
Martinez said the CAPS staff
looks at the person's social re
sources — the quality of relation
ships, friendships, family and ad
visers.
"That lets us know whether

things may get better," Martinez
said.
"A very serious depression can
happen to anyone. Very few people
are immune to an episode of de
pression," Martinez said.
However, he said, the staff pays
close attention to people with a
family history and vulnerability to
depression.
The gender gap
Nationwide, one in four women
and one in 10 men will develop de
pression during their lifetime.
Along with the high proportion
of graduate students frequenting
CAPS, 60 percent are also female.
"I think, generally, men and
women deal with demands and
pressures and stress differently,"
Martinez said. "Women experi
ence additional stress at this uni
versity and in general."
Men outnumber women in Stan
ford's graduate programs two-to
one, which may cause women with
depression to face an additional
pressure — to surpass society's ex
pectations.
"I don't want to be a weak fe
male," Smith said.
The stigma
For some, one of the hardest
parts of depression is coming for
ward and seeking help because of
the negative stigma attached to
mental illness.
"If someone had cancer. . . it's
something defined and real to peo
ple," Smith said.
Mental illness is not as clearly
defined, she said. People are afraid
of how others will view them.
She said she has had a difficult
time attending group therapy ses
sions although her therapist rec
ommended it.
"I can sit and listen to other
people, but I can't really talk. It
just doesn't feel safe," Smith said.
However, moving beyond their
spheres of safety may be the answer
for those who are lost in the darkness.

No one wants to talk about emo
tions."
She lived in Rains her first
year at Stanford. With its palm
trees, she said it reminded her of
Melrose Place. However, she
soon found out that it was far
from her idea of an ideal living
situation.
"People don't want to bond,"
she said. "People are really serious
about their work. It's just a really
different atmosphere than the un
dergraduate atmosphere.
Last quarter, Peter Danczkay,
a master's student in petroleum
engineering, said he had cyclical
depressions about what he was
doing at Stanford, but the thought
of a Stanford degree kept him
here.
"You tend to overlook the
short-term hardships. I'm not
alone. Most people tend to stick it
out," Danczkay said.
Some people, however, find it to
be too much to handle. Yamashita
said she knew many students suf
fering clinical depression in si
lence.
"In the worst cases, they disap
pear," Yamashita said. "They
don't even know that they can
reach out. They're so deprived of
energy that they can't even
move."
A few of the students who seek
help are advised to focus less on
school and more on the other as
pects of life.
"Sometimes, they have to take
•some personal time away from
Stanford," Martinez said.
This may include stopping out
or transferring.

The pressures of graduate life
The transition from under
graduate to graduate life, where
the orientation programs and so
cial opportunities are not as exten
sive, may contribute to the isola
tion and loneliness that can aggra
vate depression. Many new gradu
ate students feel they are moving
into a new stage of life alone.
"I think students certainly feel
challenges of graduate life, the
first year in particular," Martinez
said. "I don't think it's particular
ly being at Stanford.
"A lot of what | graduate stu
dents] are doing is on their own,"
Martinez said. "Again, there's a
lot of isolation and loneliness."
For upper-level graduate stu
dents who spend most of their
time writing dissertations, their
adviser's opinion may be the only
performance measurement they
have.
"Emotions are not highly val
ued. People doing work are highly
valued, no matter what kind of
mess your life is in," Smith said.
Yamashita agreed. "We are
constantly worried about how our
adviser will evaluate us. We want
some authority to consider us
good enough. I think most Stan
ford students expect a lot from
themselves."
The treatment
Smith sought out a counselor at
CAPS her first year at Stanford.
Through therapy, her fog lifted —
but contrary to her expectations,
the depression didn't. She needed
long-term treatment. Students
are only allowed 10 CAPS sessions
per academic year. CAPS referred
her off-campus for further coun
seling.
"It's so unfair that I couldn't
get help," Smith said. "You're re
ally sick and you want someone to
help you. That's all I did some
weeks was to go to therapy. That, I
think, was a life-saver."
Depression is often linked with

other illnesses, such as eating dis
orders, substance abuse and anxi
ety disorders, which sometimes
makes it difficult to diagnose.
During her depression two
years ago, Yamashita saw three
doctors. Two diagnosed her with
depression and told her to take
anti-depressant medication. The
third said she had a virus that dis
played depression-like symptoms.
"Probably, it was very much
stress related," Yamashita said.
For some people, the root of the
problem has not been as easy to
identify.
"When I look back, I realized
how depressed I was, but I
couldn't express it," Smith said.
She said she has just started to
feel more emotion within the last
six months, but it has been a
painful road.
"I was in a fog for such a long
time, and I'm just starting to
break out," she said.
Between 80 and 90 percent of
people with clinical depression re
spond to treatment, which may in
clude prescribed medication com
bined with therapy.
Smith has tried many different
medications, but she could never
tell if they had any direct effect.
"I guess some people feel mirac
ulous changes," Smith said.
Yamashita said she responded
well to her medication. However,
she was quick to point out that the
medication alone solved nothing.
She had to make changes in her
life in order to get at the root of her
depression.
"In my case, my situation actu
ally improved," Yamashita said. "I
switched my adviser. That was the
real difference for me. It was the
difference between black and
white."
Martinez said the CAPS staff
looks at the person's social re
sources — the quality of relation
ships, friendships, family and ad
visers.
"That lets us know whether

things may get better," Martinez
said.
"A very serious depression can
happen to anyone. Very few people
are immune to an episode of de
pression," Martinez said.
However, he said, the staff pays
close attention to people with a
family history and vulnerability to
depression.
The gender gap
Nationwide, one in four women
and one in 10 men will develop de
pression during their lifetime.
Along with the high proportion
of graduate students frequenting
CAPS, 60 percent are also female.
"I think, generally, men and
women deal with demands and
pressures and stress differently,"
Martinez said. "Women experi
ence additional stress at this uni
versity and in general."
Men outnumber women in Stan
ford's graduate programs two-to
one, which may cause women with
depression to face an additional
pressure — to surpass society's ex
pectations.
"I don't want to be a weak fe
male," Smith said.
The stigma
For some, one of the hardest
parts of depression is coming for
ward and seeking help because of
the negative stigma attached to
mental illness.
"If someone had cancer. . . it's
something defined and real to peo
ple," Smith said.
Mental illness is not as clearly
defined, she said. People are afraid
of how others will view them.
She said she has had a difficult
time attending group therapy ses
sions although her therapist rec
ommended it.
"I can sit and listen to other
people, but I can't really talk. It
just doesn't feel safe," Smith said.
However, moving beyond their
spheres of safety may be the answer
for those who are lost in the darkness.
