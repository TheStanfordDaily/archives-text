tions, Greenpeace activist
Christopher Childs told a group
of about 30 people in Cubberley
Auditorium last night that envi
ronmentalists must find a way to
reach people at a deeper level.
"If you want to create a better
planet, one of the keys to that is
relationship," Childs said. While
it has been easy to gain public
support for campaigns to save
whales, this is not the case for
many other environmental con
cerns.
"Sentiment is not enough,"
Childs explained. It is hard to re
cruit people emotionally on be
half of sharks, for example, even
though human activities kill at
least 10 million of them each
year, he said.
Childs also emphasized the im
portance of never yielding in
one's efforts to improve the envi
ronment. "If you compromise the
best you can end up with is part of
what you wanted," he said.
"Don't budge from the vision.. ..
Reality will move."
Childs also spoke extensively
about energy consumption.
"We're using about three times as

much energy as we need," he
noted. An overwhelming propor
tion of the best scientists in the
world now agree that global
warming is taking place and
human activity is playing a role.
Childs warned against the no
tion that nuclear energy is the an
swer. Switching to nuclear power
will not do much to reduce total
carbon dioxide emissions and it is
an unsafe technology, he said.
Instead Childs offered wind,
solar and hydrogen power as
more promising alternatives.
Wind power already yields
enough energy in California to
support a city the size of San
Francisco and another town of a
100,000 people.
"In a sense, the future is al
ready here," Childs said.
"There's no implicit limitation to
what humans can create."
At the same time, Childs
warned of placing too much faith
in innovation. "It won't do just to
advance our technology unless we
advance our ethics." He pointed
to the placement of toxic dumps in
poor and predominantly minority
neighborhoods as evidence of con
tinuing failure in this regard.
Comparing the earth to a work
of art, Childs concluded, "It's the
sum of our small and large choic
es that makes the work of art:" '
