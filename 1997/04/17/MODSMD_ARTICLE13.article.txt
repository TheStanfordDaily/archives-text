# Tobacco giants may settle
## Talks between government, two largest tobacco companies could yield blanket protection, $300 billion in compensation 
### 
Abandoning their all-out defense of cigarettes, the
nation's two biggest tobacco companies now seem will
ing to cut their legal losses for up to $300 billion and
retire Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man if the govern
ment backs off its threat to regulate nicotine.
RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris are in early talks
with the attorneys general of eight states in hopes of
winning blanket protection from lawsuits over smok
ing-related health problems, it was disclosed yester
day.
In return, the cigarettes companies would pay hun
dreds of billions of dollars and agree to cut back on ads,
especially ones like Joe Camel that appeal to children
and those that depict people, such as the Marlboro
Man.
The cigarette companies' willingness to even con
sider such concessions marks a startling turnaround.
For decades, the tobacco industry has fought a no
retreat battle on all fronts.
In the past few years, however, the industry has
been ban-aged with lawsuits filed by 22 states and
countless individuals, and the litigation is hurting

stock prices and taking management attention away
from the business of selling cigarettes.
"I think the tobacco industry is in big trouble and
they know it, so they are finally beginning to come to
the table," Minnesota Attorney General Hubert 11
Humphrey 111 said.
A sticking point is whether the Food and Drug
Administration would get the right to regulate the
nicotine levels in cigarettes to make them less addic
tive.
The tobacco companies adamantly oppose such reg
ulation for fear that once the FDA gets the power to
regulate tobacco, it will try to ban it.
News of the talks, first reported yesterday by The
Wall Street Journal, sent cigarette company stocks up
10 percent, reflecting investor hopes that an industry
wide settlement of tobacco lawsuits would lift a cloud
hanging over companies.
Industry analysts have .said that tobacco compa
nies, which had revenue of about $45 billion last year,
could finance a big settlement simply by raising
cigarette prices.
