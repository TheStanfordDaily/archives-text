TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — In a move that could bring
down the Israeli government and snarl the peace pro
cess, police have recommended indicting Prime Minis
ter Benjamin Netanyahu for breach of trust in an influ
ence-trading scandal.
Although scandals in Israel are not infrequent, the
recommendation jx>lice handed to state attorney Edna
Arbel yesterday was the harshest ever against an Israeli
government. Arbel was expected to announce by early
next week whether to indict Netanyahu.
Police recommendations are not binding or always
followed. Yet this one has the potential to break apart
Netanyahu's coalition — more brittle than ever since
the allegations surfaced in January.
An indictment would ruin chances of bringing the
opposition liabor Party into the government, a plan
Netanyahu has been contemplating as a way of rescuing
the disintegrating Middle East peace process.
The scandal started with Netanyahu's appointment
of a political crony as attorney general. Jerusalem

lawyer Roni Bar-On resigned after only a day in office
under criticism that he was a legal lightweight chosen
for his political connections.
Days later, Israel TV claimed the appointment was
pin t of a conspiracy by senior officials who expected Bar-
On to end the corruption trial of Aryeh Deri, leader of
the religious Shas Party. Deri, in turn, would ensure the
two Shas Cabinet ministers gave Netanyahu the neces
sary backing for the Israeli troop pullback from most of
the West Bank town of 1 lebron.
Netanyahu denied the allegations and called the
inquiry. After 12 weeks and the questioning of 60 wit
nesses, including Netanyahu, investigators on Tuesday
handed the state attorney their 995-page report.
The police did not make their findings public Tues
day.
Yesterday, however, lx)tb Israeli TV stations report
ed that police had recommended charging Netanyahu
himself with fraud and breach of trust. < )flicials con
firmed the reports.
