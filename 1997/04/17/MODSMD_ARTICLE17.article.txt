# Special-fee requests
## 
### 
TO MAKE INFORMED special-fee endorsements, members of The Daily's
Editorial Board spent more than 30 hours over the past week and a half
carefully reviewing the budget and Elections Handbook statement each fee
seeking group submitted to the ASSU. Whenever possible, the Editorial Board
also met with representatives from each group and asked them questions about
the group's goals, membership, outside funding and specific budget line items.
In making its endorsements on special-fee requests, the Editorial Board used
five guiding criteria, which were published in an editorial on April 1:
• Does the group provide good value for the dollar?
• Does the group make a conscientious and reasonably successful efTort to involve
and serve a significant portion of the student-body population that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate initiative in self-funding; that is, does its bud
get indicate that the group is actively seeking revenue sources other than the spe
cial fee?
• Has the group responded to its refund rate and the results of last year's
election?
• Should the student-body population targeted to fund the group's special fee
and not the University, a different populat ion or other parties — be financing
the group?
The annual cost per student for each group's fee is indicated in parentheses
under the group's gross fee-request amount. The per-capita amounts were cal
culated using registration figures for fall quarter of this year: 13,811 total stu
dents, of whom 6,550 are undergraduates and 7,'261 graduate students. A "B"
prior to the amount indicates that the fee will be assessed to both undergradu
ates and graduate students; a "UO" indicates that the fee will be assessed to
undergraduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its endorsements from groups or students;
they will be published tomorrow on a space-available basis.
Please submit letters as early as possible; only those received by 5 p.m. will be
considered for publication. Please submit letters via e-mail addressed to endorse
