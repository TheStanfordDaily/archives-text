## You can kiss my ASSU 
### 
IF AN ASSU campaign flier falls off a
bulletin board and nobody's around to
pick it up, does anyone care? The ques
tion's cliched, and the answer is obvious. I
find myself asking it every spring quarter,
and every April I discover how useless and
ineffectual the ASSU and its election pro
cess seem to be.
Reporters at The Daily tell me how stu
dent senators refer to the ASSU as a train
ing camp for political bickering. Some
thing like high school model Congress.
Picture 31 students debating for three
hours on whether or not to ask the post
office to be kinder and gentler to students.
It's no surprise.
It's not like we have a lot to fight for as
a student body. We are in one of the best
schools in the country. We are considered
privileged to have the faculty and
resources that we possess. Everything
seems hunky-dory to me, and I speak from
four years experience.
So why all the ballyhoo eveiytime elec
tions roll around? For one thing, we can't
really have an election if there's nothing
to vote for. The candidates need problems
to solve and if you try hard enough you
can find a problem in anything, even the
Sistine Chapel.
Candidates promise to improve things
like Sunday Flicks, SSE Lecture Notes
and Polio's. What is there to improve? Do
we need a new projector or waterproof
paper? Maybe spicier salsa is a priority for
some people, but I'm more concerned

about getting a good education.
The issues aren't the only thing lacking
in the campaigns. Have you taken a gan
der at some of the flyers and Web pages?
With the exception of one campaign,
Loo / Lefler, all I see are generalized polit
ical promises without structure or speci
ficity. If the goal of the ASSU is to prepare
students for professional political careers,
then this pandering to the masses is a step
in the right direction.
Meaningless advertisements for sena
torial hopefuls litter hallways and mask
kiosks. One pictures a candidate dressed
like Princess Leia; others reference the
Nike swoosh and the Budweiser frog. One
even shows a potential male senator seat
ed on a couch bare-chested, wearing a bra.
I'm not saying I don't enjoy the entertain
ment value, but these advertisements
serve as further illustration to the parody
that is the ASSU.
The only important thing to come out
of the ASSU these days is money. And lots
of it. The student government looms over
us like some bastard child of the FDIC,
doling out funds to the chosen few. Even
our sticky-pad fetishist, ASSU President
Bill Shen, calls his organization "a big
bank."
Special fees are the most heated voting
issues in each election, but why should we
have to vote for them? Instead of funnel
ing your funds through the ASSU, why
not just divvy up your refund dollars and
donate them to the groups you like on

your own. There's a sense of empower
ment the candidates claim they can give
you.
And what is all this bullshit about stu
dent empowerment? Did we forget the fact
that we worked our asses off to get the
best college education in order to make
something of ourselves in this game called
life? I'd say just going to Stanford is four
years of empowerment right there.
Candidates talk about a need for better
student / faculty communication or a
change to a grassroots system of student
government. These things are already a
part of Stanford's daily life. Students are
able to approach, write or talk with
administrators and faculty whenever they
need to, and student groups have shown
how effectively they can organize and
broadcast important messages to the right
people.
I'm not saying Stanford is without its
conflicts, mostly stemming from special
interest groups and political coalitions,
but it is in the administration's interest to
listen to us and pay heed to our concerns.
Without us, Stanford would be a dried up
think tank, and we already have one of
those across from Memorial Auditorium.

munication and drama, thinks controver
sy is, for lack of a better word, good.
