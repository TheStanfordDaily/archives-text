SCBN's fee request
reflects only its
most basic needs
In The Daily's endorsement for
SCBN, it theorizes that "This initial
request [for money] calls into question
the soundness of SCBN's management;
students must hope the group is more
responsible with the fee money it
receives than it was in requesting it." It
is unfair for The Daily to make unfound
ed statements about things that it does
not know about and has not researched.
The Daily failed to mention that three
years ago, SCBN asked for about
$50,000 and missed it by only 2 percent
of the vote. In realizing that we were so
close to getting a special fee that year,
we decided to cut the amount we were
asking for in order to help ensure that
we would get our fee the following year.
We still needed the items we were cut
ting, but we figured that getting some
thing was better than getting nothing.
Cutting the budget did not work, nor
did cutting our budget again the follow
ing year. During those years we had at
most two shows being produced and only
two to four hours of programming a day.
In these past three years many things
have changed. This year alone we
increased our number of student pro
ductions; we now have eight-plus shows
in the works ("Love Links," "The Oval,"
"The Call-in Show," "The Weekly
News," "Music Makes Me High," "It's
All Good" (a cooking show), "Shortz!," a
sports show, a political talkshow and a
movie review show).
In addition, we are constantly filming
events around campus, our program
ming schedule has increased to 12 hours
a day, and we have more members who
demand more equipment to accomplish
all of these activities. Over three years,
critical equipment has broken down
beyond repair, forcing us to have to pur
chase new equipment.
What are we really asking for? Three
cameras and the equipment that goes
with them, two video mixers, a sound
board, some tapes to record on, monitors
to replace the ones that have stopped
working, some video cable and some
dubbing equipment so we can quickly

fulfill student groups' requests for
copies when we film their events. The
three cameras, soundboard, video mixer
and a few monitors are solely for the
events crew.
Currently we have to either cancel
one of our shows or cancel the filming of
an event because we can't do two at the
same time — there's not enough equip
ment. Shows we produce in our studio
will still have to suffer from using old
equipment, and they will still be of bad
video quality. The ASSU Senate's
Appropriations Committee cut from our
budget new equipment that would make
the quality of these shows better.
Soundness of management? Look at
the facts. We've never asked for frills.
We've only requested the basics.

Daily's system for
fee endorsements
is unfair to groups
Several months ago, a small group of
students began to meet to discuss The
Daily's tradition of evaluating groups
that request special fees.
Each year, when student groups
apply for special fees they are asked to
meet with The Daily for a brief inter
view that determines whether or not
they get "recommended." Invariably,
student groups struggle to communicate
their mission and achievements in the
20 minutes allowed.
We have been involved with this pro
cess in different capacities for several
years and are consistently incensed by
The Daily's assumption that its Editori
al Board has the knowledge, back
ground, experience and right to judge
the work of their peers.
We are not a group of disgruntled stu
dents whose organizations consistently
receive a negative recommendation.
Rather, we are a group of students truly
concerned that the majority of groups
are not fairly represented in The Daily,
even when they are endorsed favorably.
Proof of this can be found in the numer
ous letters The Daily receives each year
correcting glaring misinformation print

ed in its endorsements.
Furthermore, we are not the only stu
dents who believe that this process is
wrong and needs to be reformed. We
researched The Daily's recommenda
tions from the past three years and
arrived at the following conclusions
which we e-mailed to current student
group leaders:
• The Daily has inconsistently applied
its criteria to student groups.
• The Daily is not in the position to
judge the value of a student group's
work. The Editorial Board members' ill
conceived definitions of service to Stan
ford and the surrounding communities
adversely influence their perceptions.
• A 20-minute interview is not
enough to assess a year of work by a
group. In addition, questions are steered
by The Daily and dominated by the pre
conceived notions of its Editorial Board.
Only selective information is used to
judge the validity of a group's special-fee
request. As such, The Daily often prints
information regarding groups that is
incorrect because it lacks any real con
textual and conceptual knowledge of the
groups.
In the weeks following this initial e
mail, an electronic dialogue continued
among student leaders. All of the feed
back we received was in support of our
position that The Daily's process is
wrong. We considered a boycott by stu
dent groups in which student leaders
would decline to meet with The Daily,
thereby refusing them the opportunity
to give either a "yes" or "no" recommen
dation. Because student groups need
publicity, however — and the risk of
refusing to meet could Jae too large —
most groups conceded to meet.
Tuesday's Daily claimed that its judg
ments are "based upon both the written
information and the interview discus
sions." Yet they proceeded to judge even
the groups that refused to meet with its
Editorial Board. Proper journalistic pro
tocol would require that The Daily
refrain from passing judgment on
groups with whom it did not meet.
In past years, The Daily has acted in
accordance with this protocol and with
held recommendations regarding groups
that did not interview. However, this
year it changed this policy with neither
explanation nor notification to student
groups and the Stanford community. We

firmly believe this was intended to send
a message to student groups that the
process will continue even without stu
dent group cooperation.
Although the elections this year are
winding down, this promises to remain
an issue until the system is eliminated.
We are committed to ensuring the devel
opment of a fair process and will be
holding an open forum for further dis
cussion. In the meantime, we encourage
the voters of Stanford to look past the
personal views of The Daily's Editorial
Board and to develop their own opinion
of the worthiness of each group's spe
cial-fee request.

It's un fair to call
graduate students
an apathetic group
I would like to respond to the apathy
charges levied against graduate stu
dents. There are many reasons for the
perceived apathy. I say perceived
because graduate students are a lot
more involved in their communities
than an undergraduate may think.
First, most of the graduate-student
population is made up of master's stu
dents. What does that mean? It means
they come to Stanford and pay $30,000.
After a year, they have a master's degree
and hopefully a better-paying job. Well,
being at a school for only a year leaves
little time to really get involved and
become knowledgeable about all the
campus has to offer. As a doctoral stu
dent, it took me a year to really find out
everything that's available. Master's stu
dents are looking forward to and plan
ning for "real life." They are involved in
the world outside the University. I don't
know the numbers for master's vs. doc
toral students but would guess that they
are around one to one. So we have lost
more than half the graduate-student
population to a revolving door mentality.
Now, the grad students who tend to
be most involved are the doctoral stu-

dents. Stanford housing is deliberately
stacked against them, and hence many
live off campus. Living off campus, their
lives aren't that involved with the cam
pus itself. They are citizens of Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Mountain View, etc., and
their lives are like those of ordinary citi
zens. They are involved in these commu
nities, and they live in the "real world"
even though they are still attending col
lege. That again cuts into the on-campus
active graduate-student population.
There are also the graduate students
with families. They do not have time to
be really involved with the campus com
munity. They are involved in their chil
dren's schooling, family activities and a
host of other family-related issues. Their
needs and desires are much different
from those of a typical single undergrad
uate living in a dorm. Imagine your par
ents on campus. Would they be involved
in as many activities as you?
Finally, that leaves the 10 to 20 per
cent of doctoral students who are single,
living on campus and able to find time
to get involved in activities. These are
the graduate students involved in an
undergraduate organization. They have
the time and desire to be involved, but
again they are not involved in every
thing. I am in this group, and I'm
involved in parts of the campus commu
nity. Hut I don't limit myself to campus.
I consider myself a member of the Bay
Area community, and I'm involved in
that community — of which Stanford is
just a part. I don't look at only The
Daily and say, "Wow, that looks like
fun!" I read the San Francisco Chroni
cle or San Jose Mercury News and say,
"Wow, look what's happening in San
Francisco!"
Therefore, this letter is to point out
that graduate students have different
needs and desires. They may be apathet
ic in an undergraduate's world, but that
world is relatively small when one looks
at the many different communities that
surround Stanford. Graduate students
should not be automatically excluded
from the undergraduates' world. Even
though graduate students are involved
in many activities outside Stanford, they
do not exclude the Stanford community
entirely. Rather they are more selective
about the activities they choose to join.
