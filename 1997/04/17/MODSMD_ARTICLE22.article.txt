### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Two members of the Cardinal
women's gymnastics team will put
their skills to the test at the NCAA
Championships in Gainesville,
Fla., tonight. Summoning nearly
100 of the nation's top college
gymnasts, this final competition of
the collegiate gymnastics season
will determine the best team and
individual athletes over the next
three days.

'We had a good
week of workouts.
We want to concen
trate on doing our
best L being relaxed
and having fun.'
â€” Katie Fitzpatrick

Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick
and freshman Larissa Fontaine,
who tied for third place in the all
around category at the NCAA
West Regional Championships,
will be representing the Stanford
squad at the national champi
onships. The Cardinal, which fin
ished fifth as a team at regionals,
will not be among the 12 squads
participating in the event hosted
by Florida.

Tonight's preliminary round
will crown the all-around queen as
well as qualify the top six squads
into finals tomorrow. In addition,
gymnasts marking the top four
scores will move on to the final
round of individual event titles
Saturday.
Fitzpatrick and Fontaine will
battle for the all-around and
individual event titles with 10
other gymnasts who qualified to
compete individually as well as
the gymnasts from each of the
12 teams from around the
nation.
Head coach Lisa Izzi said
although as many as 84 gymnasts
will go up on each apparatus, both
Fitzpatrick and Fontaine have
"plenty of competition experience"
and may very well emerge as Ail-
Americans, if not the all-around
champion. Gymnasts producing
the top eight scores on each event
will be named Ail-Americans.
"They've had great practices,"
Izzi said. "They are as ready as
they'll ever be."
Enjoying three days off of prac
tice after regionals, Fitzpatrick
said she and Fontaine were fairly
well-rested and should be in good
physical condition to compete for
the last time this year.
"We had a good week of work
outs," Fitzpatrick said. "We want
to concentrate on doing our best,
being relaxed and having fun."
