# Softball splits with Spartans
##

The softball team suffered bouts of schizophrenia
yesterday, looking like completely different teams in a
doubleheader against San Jose State in Sunnyvale.
Stanford (20-20-1) got drilled in the first game 10-1,
but came back convincingly in game two with a 9-0 vic
tory.
In game one, the Spartans (19-29) exploded for six
runs in the first inning, the highest run total sopho
mpre pitcher Marcy Crouch (10-8) has allowed in one
inning. The Sharks had 10 hits spread out over four
innings, with the mercy rule being called after the top
of the fifth. Crouch did not have her customary power
while on the mound, recording only one strikeout in 3
2/3 innings. Junior pitcher Jessica Schulman had her
first pitching performance since returning from an
injury earlier in the season. Schulman retired the only
batter she faced.
"We made errors, some of them mental, and we
didn't hit well at all," said sophomore pitcher Becky
Blevins. "Sometimes, you need to get beat like that in
order to realize that it's time to get going and take
charge — we can't come out flat like that."
The Cardinal's hitting was severely limited by Spar
tans pitcher Sabrina Quintero (9-9) in game one. Stan
ford scored its only run in the third inning and record
ed a mere five hits over five innings. Sophomore second
baseman Jennie Foyle had a solid game at the plate,
going 2-2. The other Cardinal's recording hits were
sophomore shortstop Michelle Schneider, sophomore
outfielder Kelly Yablonski and Crouch.
Game two involved the Cardinal exploding for four
runs in the first inning and nine runs for the game.
The Spartans' starting pitcher, Lindsey Jarrell lasted
just a third of an inning, being knocked out early by the
Cardinal hitting onslaught.
Reliever Jennifer Whelen fared no better, giving up
five runs in 4 2/3 innings pitched. The assault on San
Jose's pitchers was led by senior third baseman Aman
da Renteria, who went 3-for-4 in the game with two
runs batted in. Stanford had 12 hits in five innings,
which included a double by Crouch and a triple by
Yablonski.
"It was like we were a different team the second
game, it was really weird," Blevins said. "I think we
just realized that we're a better team than that and we
needed to pick it up."
Blevins performed well on the mound, only giving
up three hits in five innings of work. Blevins also
had two strikeouts and no walks, improving her
record to 10-12. With a big lead on her side early,
Blevins felt more comfortable while on the mound.
The game eventually ended after five innings
because of the mercy rule, this time with San Jose
State falling victim.
Stanford's next game is at Washington Sunday at 3
p.m. The Huskies (28-10, 2-4
Pacific 10 Conference) are one of
the best teams in the Pac-10 and
in the country, ranked consistent
ly in the top 10. Due to the numer
ous ranked teams in the Pac-10,
the Cardinal has struggled to get
conference wins, and Washington
will pose a formidable challenge.
Stanford needs to achieve at
least a split to keep its regional
hopes alive. Additionally, Cardinal
head coach John Rittman served
as the assistant coach at Washing
ton last season, and the team
wants to showcase what Rittman
has accomplished.
"We know we have to beat
Washington for our regional
hopes, and we want to play for our
coach because he wants to win,"
Blevins said.
Often the Cardinal is at a disad
vantage because of its sheer lack of
numbers. "We need to come out
mentally prepared for every game,
and we play with heart," Blevins
said. "We have talent and a lot of
what other teams have we have to
make up with heart.
"Every game is a battle, accord
ing to our coach, and if we don't
come out ready to play then things
like the first game can happen."
