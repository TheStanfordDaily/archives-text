# Men's gymnastics team heads to Iowa for national championships
## 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
It's been a struggle all year for
the men's gymnastics team.
It seems like the season just
began yesterday for the Cardinal,

as it dealt with early injuries to
several team members.
And now that same Stanford
squad, against all odds, is heading
to the NCAA Championships that
begin tonight at lowa. Tonight's
semifinal competition will decide

which three teams make it to the
finals tomorrow night.
Usually early struggles are fol
lowed by rehabilitation and
revival, but instead an endless
series of injuries has plagued the
team, and the overall damage will
be gauged directly from tonight's
performance.
On the same day that the Cardi
nal regained the full services of
senior All-American Jamie Ellis, it
lost another senior All-American,
lan Bachrach. Ellis dislocated his
shoulder in late February but
recovered to contribute to the
team effort.
"Whether it's become a game or
not, I've convinced myself that I
am OK," Ellis said. "I've spent all
my life trying to prepare for meets,
and I'm definitely going to do that
for this one."
At West Regionals two week
ends ago, Bachrach injured his
knee while performing the floor
exercise and was sidelined. But
Bachrach will see action on the
rings and high bar tonight, albeit
with watered-down landings.
Junior Gabe Edelman will (ill in
for Bachrach on the vault and
floor. However, Bachrach will not
be able to defend his individual
title on the floor exercise nor can
he seek to recapture the title he
won on the vault in 1995.
Ranked 11th in a field that
included the No. 2, No. 3, No. 4
and No. 10 teams in the nation,
Stanford managed to find its way

into the top three in the West for a
spot at the NCAA Championships.
Now the Card faces even
greater odds as it takes on teams
one through six in the ranking,
minus No. 3 Nebraska — No. 1
Ohio State, No. 2 California, No. 4
Oklahoma, No. 5 lowa and No. 6
Penn State.
However, observers have
learned never to sell this team
short. Two years ago, the team
overcame early adversity and a
national ranking of Nth to win the
national championship — its third
in the last five years.
This time around, things will be
much tougher as key contributors
are nursing injuries, but another
national title is by no means out of
the question.
After all, the Stanford team,
which placed third at last year's
NCAA finals, is returning the most
Ail-Americans — Ellis, Bachrach,
senior Keith Wiley, junior
Clarence Miao and redshirt sopho
more Jeremy Herman — of any
squad.
Additionally, the Cardinal has
added new talent since last year,
freshman Jason Katsampes, fresh
man Craig Nesbitt and redshirt
freshman David Ludlow will each
bolster the Card's chances of
bringing it home.
Head coach Sadao Hamada
deemed Katsampes one of the most
talented gymnasts that he has ever
coached. Katsampes stepped in and
immediately found a spot as an all

arounder. Nesbitt has also come
through for the team in tough
times, picking up new events on
short notice, like pommel horse
when Ellis was injured. Now Nes
bitt will vie for one of the six posi
tions on pommel horse with Ellis
back in the running.
And despite having his fair

share of bad luck, Ludlow has
overcome two surgeries and a
recent back injury to put up solid
scores on the high bar and work
toward full recuperation.
The one constant through all
of the turmoil has been Wiley.
Although last year Wiley had his
ups and downs, the senior co
captain has finally found his
groove. Wiley has consistently
posted the top numbers for the
team and placed at the front of
the pack of all-arounders at

almost every meet the Card has
competed in this year.
Wiley, a current U.S. national
team member, placed second in the
nation in the all-around last year.
While he led the West all year in
the all-around, he took second
place in the West Regionals this
year due to a miss on his high har
routine. Wiley's name has also
been mentioned for the Nissen
Award, which recognizes the top
senior gymnast in the nation.
"I think West Regionals made

everyone realize that we do have a
shot at winning," Wiley said. "We
definitely had a lackluster perfor
mance and even then we quali
fied."
The nature of the Stanford
team has never been like that of
any other. After all, what other
team enjoys being the underdog,
prepares solely for NCAAs and
trains to peak in those two days?
"For other teams (being the
underdog is) not a good thing,"
Bachrach said. "Through my expe

rience here on the Stanford gym
nastics learn, it i.s always better for
us to come in as the underdog
because people will never know
what to expect."
And this year, they are some
what underdogs, they've made it
to nationals and they haven't
peaked yet. Although the perfor
mance at regionals was good
enough to make it, there is still
room for improvement.
Hamada has spent the last two
weeks putting the squad through a

double dose of practices starting at
7:.'}() a.m. and has also worked on
convincing the men that they are
not underdogs.
"I made sure that they are opti
mistic," he said. "There is not rea
son to bo negative. With their qual
ity, there is no way we can be an
underdog.
"I think we have a way to sneak
into the final three — as long as I
can beat one of the schools from
the West. And after we sneak in
anything can happen."
