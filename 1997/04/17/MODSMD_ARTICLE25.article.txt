# Men's gymnastics team heads to Iowa for national championships
## 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
It's been a struggle all year for
the men's gymnastics team.
It seems like the season just
began yesterday for the Cardinal,

as it dealt with early injuries to
several team members.
And now that same Stanford
squad, against all odds, is heading
to the NCAA Championships that
begin tonight at lowa. Tonight's
semifinal competition will decide

which three teams make it to the
finals tomorrow night.
Usually early struggles are fol
lowed by rehabilitation and
revival, but instead an endless
series of injuries has plagued the
team, and the overall damage will
be gauged directly from tonight's
performance.
On the same day that the Cardi
nal regained the full services of
senior All-American Jamie Ellis, it
lost another senior All-American,
lan Bachrach. Ellis dislocated his
shoulder in late February but
recovered to contribute to the
team effort.
"Whether it's become a game or
not, I've convinced myself that I
am OK," Ellis said. "I've spent all
my life trying to prepare for meets,
and I'm definitely going to do that
for this one."
At West Regionals two week
ends ago, Bachrach injured his
knee while performing the floor
exercise and was sidelined. But
Bachrach will see action on the
rings and high bar tonight, albeit
with watered-down landings.
Junior Gabe Edelman will (ill in
for Bachrach on the vault and
floor. However, Bachrach will not
be able to defend his individual
title on the floor exercise nor can
he seek to recapture the title he
won on the vault in 1995.
Ranked 11th in a field that
included the No. 2, No. 3, No. 4
and No. 10 teams in the nation,
Stanford managed to find its way

into the top three in the West for a
spot at the NCAA Championships.
Now the Card faces even
greater odds as it takes on teams
one through six in the ranking,
minus No. 3 Nebraska — No. 1
Ohio State, No. 2 California, No. 4
Oklahoma, No. 5 lowa and No. 6
Penn State.
However, observers have
learned never to sell this team
short. Two years ago, the team
overcame early adversity and a
national ranking of Nth to win the
national championship — its third
in the last five years.
This time around, things will be
much tougher as key contributors
are nursing injuries, but another
national title is by no means out of
the question.
After all, the Stanford team,
which placed third at last year's
NCAA finals, is returning the most
Ail-Americans — Ellis, Bachrach,
senior Keith Wiley, junior
Clarence Miao and redshirt sopho
more Jeremy Herman — of any
squad.
Additionally, the Cardinal has
added new talent since last year,
freshman Jason Katsampes, fresh
man Craig Nesbitt and redshirt
freshman David Ludlow will each
bolster the Card's chances of
bringing it home.
Head coach Sadao Hamada
deemed Katsampes one of the most
talented gymnasts that he has ever
coached. Katsampes stepped in and
immediately found a spot as an all
