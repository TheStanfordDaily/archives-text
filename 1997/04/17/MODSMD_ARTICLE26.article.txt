# Peterson leads talented pitching squad
## Professional career may be on horizon 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
Kyle Peterson still remembers one of his first
baseball games. He remembers the baseball dia
mond surrounded by a distant fence, the cheers of
the local Little league crowd and, most of all, the
grand slam he hit.
"I didn't realize that you didn't have to run
fast around the bases if you hit a home run,"
Peterson said. "So I was running as fast as I pos
sibly could."
In a sense, Peterson has never stopped run
ning, never abandoned that intensity that com
pels him to persevere.
Now 21 and one of the best college pitchers in
the nation, Peterson, a junior majoring in com
munication, is the Friday starter for this season's
explosive Stanford baseball team (27-11, 13-5
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division).
Under the blazing lights that illuminate
Sunken Diamond on Friday evenings, Peterson
paces the mound, regularly clocking fastballs in
excess of 90 mph, hurling his atypical change-up
and maintaining an eerily deceptive calm under
pressure.
Peterson first blasted onto the Stanford base
ball scene in 1995, when, as a freshman, he led his
team to a surprising bid for the College World
Series title.
The moment it happened has become leg
endary.
Under an ominous Wichita sky that promised
an impending torrent of rain, Peterson pitched
an almost surreal game against top-seeded Texas
Tech. After only two days of rest Peterson threw
146 pitches, holding the nation's best-hitting
team to a mere four earned runs on 10 hits and
11 strikeouts in a 6-5 victory. After he pitched
the final strike and his teammates rushed the
field, the sky broke and the rain came pouring
down.
"It was something that I don't think anybody
expected except maybe us," Peterson said. "That
was an amazing course of events."
Hut how would those who know him best
describe Peterson, who claimed national fresh
man of the year honors for his efforts in 1995?
"Competitive," said junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer. "He just really does not like to lose."
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess agreed
with this assessment.
"I think what impressed us most about him
was that he was very competitive," Marquess
said.
And just exactly how competitive is Peterson?
"I heard his freshman year that a couple guys
had bet him or he made a bet with a couple guys
that he could drink an entire gallon of milk," said
senior first baseman Luke Quaccia, who then

played at Modesto Junior College. "I don't know
if it was an hour or half an hour or what, but he
ended up getting the whole thing down."
Peterson's ambitious drive was fostered at a
young age in the small town of Elkhorn, Neb.,
where he was raised by parents Monnie, an
employee at a label-producing company, and
Susan, a real-estate assistant.
"My mom said I always had a bat in my hand
from the time I was little," Peterson said. "She
used to roll me those big balls you can buy in the
grocery store .. . and I'd hit them with a big plas
tic bat."
Growing up in the virtual backyard of the Col
lege World Series, Peterson developed an early
devotion both to Stanford and to the national pas
time.
"Stanford won the national championship in
'87 and '88 in baseball, and I was at both of
those," Peterson said. In fact, he still owns a care
fully preserved program booklet signed by former
Stanford players and Marquess.
After his sophomore year at Creighton Prep
High School, Peterson composed a letter to Mar
quess outlining his athletic and academic capabil
ities.
"Stanford had made an early impression on
me," Peterson said. "When I came out here and
actually saw it, it was too good to turn down."
In just two seasons on the Farm, Peterson
has established himself as one of the best pitch
ers in Stanford baseball history. He currently
appears on four of Stanford's career and single
season top-10 lists — wins, winning percentage,
strikeouts and innings pitched. He was also
selected as a second-team preseason Ail-Ameri
can by Baseball America and third team by Col
legiate Baseball.
Peterson has already surpassed former Stan
ford pitcher and current Baltimore Oriole Mike
Mussina in career wins with 30. Mussina man
aged to tally 25 in the 1988-90 seasons. He
became the fourth Cardinal pitcher to record 30
career wins after a crushing 15-9 victory over
USC two weeks ago.
Peterson's Stanford career, however, will
almost certainly conclude with the final pitch of
the 1997 season. He plans to turn pro in time for
the June draft.
"I think he'll be a high draft pick in June,"
Marquess said. "I think he'll be successful."
"I would like to know at the earliest point in my
life if baseball is going to be my career," Peterson
said. "I think the two expansion teams (Arizona
and Tampa Bay) offer a reallyli good opportunity
because they're just starting up. But that's some
thing where I'm not very picky. It's just whoever
and whenever and then hopefully I'll get my shot."
When Kyle Peterson receives his opportunity,
it will almost certainly be a grand slam.
