# Rugby heads east for regionals
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Despite having to travel to the East Coast for
the Regional Playoffs in West Point, N.Y., this
weekend, the men s rugby team hopes to secure a
berth in the t inal Four at Berkeley May 3 and 4.
The team will face Catholic University from
Washington, D.C., on Saturday, and if Stanford
wins, it will take on the victor of the other semifi
nal match between Army and Truman (Mo.) State
on Sunday.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation, was
very successful throughout most of the season.
Stanford's only major loss was to No. 1 California,
and that came after the team defeated then-No 2
UC-Davis.
The team has been practicing to regain the pace
it had lost after weeks without practice because of
winter quarter finals and spring break. The
squad's tour through Canada at the end of the
break resulted in two heavy losses at the hands of
the Universities of Victoria and British Columbia.
1 he Cardinal has been focusing on "getting
our plays down, said freshman Dez Croan.
"We've been doing a lot of running and training,
getting ready to endure for the long matches
ahead. Our practices are getting better; we're
getting quicker and more prepared. I think the

spirit on the team is really high right now, and
we're expecting to do a lot of damage in New
York."
Head coach Franck Boivert is also emphasizing
a strong defensive game in anticipation of facing
teams which are physically larger.
"Technically, we've been concentrating a lot on
putt ing heavy pressure on defense because we're
going to be facing teams who are physically supe
rior to us," Boivert said. "The only way to stop
that is to be in their face all day long."
Practice during the last three weeks has also
focused on getting the players back in sync with
each other. In Canada, the Cardinal's teamwork
was not up to par, and this seriously disrupted its
pace and execution, Boivert said.
"The last two weeks have had very hard prac
tices; therefore, the players are very tired so they
cannot perform as well," Boivert said. "I think it's
mainly mental. Mentally they have the desire."
Also figuring to be factors are jetlag due to the
three-hour time difference and the cold weather
in New York. The team has been adjusting its
practice routine in order to prepare for these con
ditions.
"We practice early in the morning just to get
used to the difference in time," Boivert said.
"Also, we have to adapt according to the weather
conditions. This is going to be our priority."
