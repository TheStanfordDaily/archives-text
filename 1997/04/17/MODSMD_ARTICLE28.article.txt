Tuesday night in Stockton, in its regular-season
finale against Pacific Division rival Pacific, the
Stanford men's volleyball team continued its win
ning ways. In beating the Tigers three games to one,
the Cardinal won its 12th match in a row in con
vincing style, 15-8, 13-15, 15-7, 15-13.
Going into the match, Stanford knew it would
have its hands full with the Tigers. And Pacific
knew that with a win it would be guaranteed a berth
in the postseason Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion tournament, a date with Mountain Division
champion and first-ranked UCLA Saturday. As a
result, the Cardinal, which had beaten the Tigers
early in the season when neither team played par
ticularly well, knew only a very good effort would
produce a victory.
The Tigers "felt they had to win to guarantee that
their season would be extended," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "They had their backs to the wall and
really played hard, as I thought they would."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, two of its players
elevated their games in a response to Pacific's inten
sity. Senior outside hitter Mike Lambert played an
outstanding match for Stanford. Lambert had one
of his best matches of the season and was dominant
offensively. He had 40 kills for the match, a number
considerably higher than recent matches against
weaker opponents in which the Cardinal has not
had to look to him for a lot of production.
"Lambert really was at the top of his game,"
Nieves said. "As Tiger Woods would say, he brought
his 'A game.' This match definitely ranks among the

top three or four matches that he has played all
year. Like his other great matches, this one came at
a time when we as a team really needed him to step
forward and carry us for a while. He was
ly outstanding in games two and four, which were
the most competitive games of the match."
Meanwhile, as Lambert was proving to be
unstoppable from the outside, fellow senior Mike
Hoefer, a middle blocker, provided power in the mid
dle. Hoefer finished the match with 18 kills and led
the team in hitting at .500. However impressive
these stats may be, his most valuable contribution
may have been in an area in which the team rarely
looks for him to excel â€” digging. Time after time,
Hoefer prolonged rallies by retrieving balls and get
ting them back into position for the Cardinal attack.
He finished the match with nine total digs.
"Mike had a great match," Nieves said. "Even
though he was not our dig leader, he had many of
what I thought were the best digs. It was probably
the best digging match of his career and one of the
best matches overall that he has played."
Although Pacific was defeated, the Tigers will
still play this weekend because both USC and Cal
State-Northridge, the teams with whom UOP was
contending for the tournament's eighth seed, both
lost. As a result, the eight-team field is complete,
with the pairings as follows: No. 1 UCLA will play
No. 8 UOP, No. 2 Stanford will play No. 7 Pepper
dine, No. Brigham Young will play No. 6 Hawaii
and No. 4 Long Beach State will play No. 5 UC-
Santa Barbara.
Stanford's match against the Waves will be in
Burnham Pavilion, where the Cardinal is a perfect
11-0 this season, at 7 p.m. Saturday.
