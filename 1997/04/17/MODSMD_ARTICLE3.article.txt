Tresidder Union will
be whirling with activ

new Jamba Juice be
gins blending its fa
mous fruit concoc

Favorites such
as Strawberries Wild,

Peach Pleasure and Guava
Mambo will be available with all
the regular additives, including
ginseng, bee pollen and spirulina,
a blue-green algae.
Located in the space formerly
occupied by Stanford 1 lairstyling,
Jamba Juice features the same
menu as any neighborhood Juice
Club.

When walking into Jamba
Juice, customers are greeted by
bright colors, natural wood cabi
nets and counters and tiled floors,
all of which add to the store's
inviting atmosphere.
The Tresiddcr Union Advisory
Board, consisting of students, fac
ulty and staff, chose Jamba Juice
from a group of three competing
vendors, including Odwalla and
Juice-It.
Dean of Students Marc Wais,
who worked closely with the Advi
sory Board, said he is looking for
ward to the opening of Jamba
Juice.
"We're very excited about

community," Wais said. "We're

students, faculty and staff with an
exciting Tresidder experience."
In addition to offering the Stan
ford community its unique prod
uct, Jamba Juice will be almost ex
clusively staffed by 26 Stanford stu
dents.
Sophomore Kelly Price, who has
signed up to work Jamba Juice
through spring quarter, said she's
eager for her new job.
"There's so much fun and ener
gy at those late-night shifts," Price
said.
Another sophomore, Elisabeth

Riedmueller, also said she was ex
cited to be working at Jamba Juice.
"It should be crazy," Ried
mueller said.
Jamba Juice founder and Chief
Executive Officer Kirk Perron
noted that Stanford's is the first
Jamba Juice on a university cam
pus.
"We are really excited to be com
ing to the campus scene. We feel
veiy fortunate that we're going to
be there," Perron said.
Perron also said he was especial
ly grateful to Stanford students for
choosing Jamba Juice to be the ven
dor on campus.
"We really believe that cus
tomers give us the opportunity to
grow," Perron said. "They decide
whether or not we stay in business.

Retailers sometimes forget that by
not providing customers with the
best choice."
Perron, a cyclist, said he found
ed Jamba Juice in 1990 because he
felt there were not enough healthy
food choices available to the public.
"We wanted something that
wasn't high in fat," Perron said.
"When I think back, the purpose of
our company was to improve the
quality of our customers' lives with
fruits and vegetables.
"Things have changed over the
last five years. Look at the grocery
store aisles today â€” the number of
food items that speak to fat."
Jamba Juice, which offers four
to seven servings of fruit per drink,
reflects Perron's vision of good
health.

"What we eat today is generally
too high in proteins and animal
foods. We need to eat more plant
products," Perron said.
Jamba Juice additives, such as
wheat bran, wheatgrass and
lecithin, are designed to provide the
drinks with extra nutrients.
So as the temperature rises this
quarter, expect to see the familiar
Jamba Juice cups in hands across
campus.
"We're hopeful Jamba Juice de
velops a cult following among the
Stanford community, similar to
that experienced at the Town and
Country location," Wais said.
The grand opening of Jamba
Juice, planned for May 2, will fea
ture a ribbon-cutting ceremony
and a band.
