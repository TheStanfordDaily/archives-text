Statistics Prof. lain Johnstone and Asst. Music
Prof. Melissa Hui recently were named recipients of
the 1997 Guggenheim Fellowship Awards.
Among 2,876 applicants for the award, 164
artists, scholars and scientists were chosen as re
cipients based on distinguished achievement and
exceptional promise for future accomplishments.
The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Founda
tion is in its 73rd year, and this year's recipients
will receive a total of $4,890,000.
Hui began teaching at Stanford in 1994 and was
promoted to assistant professor and appointed a
dean's fellow this year, Music Department Chair
Chris Chafe said.
After a portfolio of her compositions was
judged and the feasibility of her proposed project
confirmed, Hui was awarded the fellowship to
pursue the composition of a large-scale orchestral
work.
"The fellowship award is a wonderful opportuni
ty for me to pursue projects that I've been wanting
to pursue with the financial support that I need,"
she said.
Hui currently is teaching a graduate composi
tion seminar and a course in world music. She also
is working on a string quartet commission, piano
works and a film score for the National Film Board
of Canada.
"She has been excelling as an instructor of com
position and also as a champion of the inclusion of
world music offerings in the Music Department,"

Chafe said. "We are fabulously pleased to have her
as a colleague both for her contribution to the de
partment and as an emerging composer who
strengthens the music program at Stanford."
For Hui, broadening the department's focus was
important.
"I draw more inspiration from different music of
the world than the Western tradition in which I was
raised," she said. "These new sound worlds open me
up to new ways of thinking about music. World
music is also another way to understand different
cultures and the function of music in society."
Johnstone's fellowship work will consist partly
in writing a book that summarizes some of his and
his colleagues' work.
The Statistics Department chair, he said he
plans to "use wavelets and the tools of statistical
theory to describe and understand efficient ways to
average out noise from signals of scientific interest.
"The fellowship will be a great chance to free up
some time to work on an extended project, which
would otherwise be difficult to do with the pressure
of research and teaching," he added.
Johnstone works closely with the biostatistics
group in the School of Medicine as well as with the
Statistics Department in finding a wide range of
statistical application, said fellow Statistics Prof.
David Siegmund.
"His work of over three years with [Statistics]
Prof. David Donoho has been important in statisti
cal theory and application, and he is certainly very
deserving of this award," said Siegmund.
Johnstone is scheduled to take a sabbatical leave
next year.
