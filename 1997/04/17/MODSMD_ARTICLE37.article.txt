"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again"
David Foster Wallace;
Little, Brown and Company, 1997
Metafiction, according to David Foster Wallace, is look
ing for a successor, and the alarmingly blatant subtext
of his "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never I )o Again" is
the impassioned speech of a long-shot candidate running for
the office. In the wake of the likes of Pynchon, Delillo,
Barthelme and, more recently, Mclnerny and I eyner, Wallace
makes the case in his new book of essays, for himself as "best
man for the job."
What on the surface is simply a collection of Wallace's jour
nalistic (and densely footnoted) forays is more accurately a
carefully selected and rendered argument supporting the crit
ical acclaim that his 1996 novel "Infinite Jest" received. In some
ways a manual tor reading that book and in others a handbook
for writers at the cusp of the millennium, "A Supposedly Fun
Thing" reads like the more self-referential portions of James

Joyce's "A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man."
This comparison is not without justification. A cursory
overview of the essays contained demonstrates how inter
leaved this work and his supposedly autonomous "Infinite
Jest" really are. In "A Supposedly Fun Thing," the topics are
writing, tennis, film, America in the 19905, leisure and acade
mia — six essential nutrients in the Wallace food pyramid.
More intimately, these essays explain why Wallace is so ob
sessed with these subjects and more important, why he is The
Man to write about them.
In the introductory essay, "Derivative Sport in Tornado

haps the most compelling book I've read save Ulysses, its clear
predecessor. An intricately woven tale of tennis, film and ad
diction, it satirizes, performs and otherwise creatively dis
mantles / disembowels the hypocrisy and other postmodern
casualties of the ever more absurd 19905. This is just about the

Alley," Wallace elaborates on his own foiled tennis
career and subsequent love of the sport. Tennis, as
readers of "Infinite lest" know in nearly porno
graphic detail, is to Wallace as boxing was to Hem
ingway: a man's sport. Moreover, in the other tennis
essay in "A Supposedly Fun Thing," Wallace invokes
literary patriarch James Joyce to explicate his own
and his characters' relationship to the artist, mod
ernism and all things avant garde / canonical. In this
piece, "Tennis Player Michael Joyce's Professional
Artistry as a Paradigm of Certain Stuff about (Choice,
Freedom, Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie, and Human
Completeness," without explicitly referring to "Infi
nite Jest"', Wallace makes it clear that I lal Incanden

striking similarities to über-cin
-9 emachine David I.ynch. This was
perhaps the most genuine and in
sightful of the essays in "A Suppos
edly I un Thing," and the least sell
aggrandizing — only in this essay is

the subject treated with reverence and not somehow
diminished in authority or authenticity by implicit

comparison to Wallace himself. This essay also begins Wal
lace's plummet into gender trouble. This is where we begin to
see that Wallace is maybe not all the candidate he claims to be,
where we see that maybe some of his self-described paranoia
of being a dork really has to do with his troubled relationship
to the other sex that ends in the masculini/ation of his work.
He writes around women, never about women. Women are
excluded, denigrated or masculinized in troubling ways
throughout his oeuvre. But because Wallace has be deemed

most lavish praise I have ever had the chance to lavish on a book,
so trust me on this one, it's worth every one of the trees that died
for its 1,079 pages.
2. Accomplished mostly through Irish/Joyce references,
Hero and Modern Hero discussion and a unique subterfuge
of voguing or posturing to the effect that he explicitly denies

the heir to the legacy of mctafiction at the tui n of the millen
ilium, this is simply not acceptable.
Mostly, "A Supposedly 1 un Thing" is a sell indulgent book
of essays by and about a really disturbingly talented young
writer. II you go for that kind ol thing, cool, but otherwise I
would pick up liis landmark collection ol short fiction, "(iirl
With Curious I lair" or "Infinite Jest" before buying this slim
$23 hardback.
