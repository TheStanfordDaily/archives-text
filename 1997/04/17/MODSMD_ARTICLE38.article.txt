# WHY DID THE MECHANICAL MAN CROSS THE ROAD?
## Breast cancer survivor Yvonne Rainer's films more than exercises in esotericism 
### 
INI VI K KNOW WIIAI IOIXI'H I WHI-N I VII W A I lI.M
. AI A MUSI UM.
I recently saw a film at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York that showed a Smurl si/.ed mechanical "man"
slinking like a combat spy at toss a busy street in Manhat
I.in as tar alter car alter car drove by.
finally, .1 t ire smashed it.
And that transfixed the viewers in the room for 20 mill
utes.
With this and other strange experiences of museum
lil ms in hand, I had no idea wli.it to expect of Yvonne Rain
er's new film, "MURDKR and murder" — the first of her
seven films now showing at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. Clanging from what I had seen in art classes
and at other museums, I thought I was in for two hours of
either strange music or non-plot video.
However, all seven are feature films and tell stories that
are humorous yet have a direct political agenda.
Hente, this line from the opening scene for "MURDI-R
and murder": "I love eating pussy."
I his line aptly sets the stage for a movie that focuses on
the issues in a lesbian relationship from the difficulty
one lover, Doris (Joanna Merlin), has in this, her first gay
relationship, to the bickering that occurs between all
lovers, to the challenge Doris and Mildred (Kathleen Chal
fant) lace when Doris discovers she has breast cancer and
undergoes a mastectomy.
Deadpan statements like, "Statistics show that lesbians
are chronic late returners of library books," relieve the se
riousness til the subject matter, however.
Rainer also mixes her honest, real portrayal with histor
ical tacts and statistics to such an extent that after show
ing her newest film to some friends, "There was a com
plaint over the great overload ol statistics . . . so I took a
great many out," she said.
At this statement, the audience almost gasped in disbe
lief, because "MURDKR and murder" still contains what
seems to be an "overload" of statistics — mainly about
breast cancer.
Rainer is not afraid to lay the numbers on thick, howev
er, just as she is not afraid to give voice to lesbians, who tra
ditionally have been oppressed both for their sex and their
sexuality.
"As much as l llen is coming out all over the place," Rain
er said, referring to TV sitcom star 112 lien DeCieneres, "there
is this backlash from the right to bring back something-
God knows what."
Despite the political bent, the movie, made with 11011

professional actresses (as are all her films), also engages
with emotions that are plainly true to life — not glamor
ized.
Rainer herself makes appearances throughout the film
to narrate and give her personal story. At one point, she
pulls down the left side ol the robe she is wearing, exposing
the left side of her chest — void of breast.
"That taut feeling never quite disappears," says Rainer at
this point, as she runs her hand over her flat ribs.
The audience expressed an audible sympathetic sigh at
this moment, and I felt sure that all eyes were on Rainer,
who was present at the screening. Hut the drama was only
in the audience's reaction; the moment in itself is very sim
ple. What could have been so easily dramatized is simply
revealed and accepted.

The movie's final scene underscores the idea that "real
people confront these issues. After dealing with homosex
uality and breast cancer, "MURDER and murder" ends
with a depiction of the two lovers, Doris and Mildred, eat
ing chicken soup.
"I didn't want a happy ending or a sad ending. I wanted
a very banal ending," Rainer said. "And chicken soup?
What could be more ordinary?"
The political and emotional impact of "MURDER and
murder" fits with the characteristics of her previous films,
which also deal with hard-hitting political and emotional
issues.
"Kristina Talking Pictures," one of the films being
shown this weekend, plays with traditional male and fe
male roles. The main character, Kristina, played by Rainer,
is a lion tamer whose ex-lover, a sailor named Raoul
(played by Rainer s real-life brother, Ivan), comes back
after ditching her.
Rainer interweaves historical allusions, from concent ra
tion camps to draft dodging, with a simple plot line to
demonstrate how interconnected people's lives are to
world events.
Similarly, " The Man Who Envied Women" fuses tlu*
story of a professor recently separated from his wife with
documentary footage of political activist events in which
Rainer participated.
Rainer puts great personal stake in her work, as shown
by her willingness to expose the side of her chest that breast
cancer so neatly erased. Likewise, "Journeys from Berlin ,'
being shown in two weeks, focuses on a year that was a sig
nificant one tor Rainer — after almost ending her own life,
she switched careers.
Having gained fame in the early 1960s as a founder of
the avant-garde Judson Dance Theater in New York, slu
decided in 1971 to leave the world of dance to work in film.
Of the final three films being shown, "Eilm about a
Woman Who . . ." is considered by some to be her master
piece, as it set her on the filmmaking map and gained her a
loyal audience. I his film explores the position that women
must take "in the world, on stage and on screen," according
to film scholar B. Ruby Rich.
And the museum has appropriately chosen this year,
being the 25th anniversary of Rainer's first venture into
film, to give people a chance to learn or re-learn the im
portant position that this short-haired, bespectacled
woman has had in the world, on stage and on screen as
well. Q
