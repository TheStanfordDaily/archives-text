# Kiss me, I'm dead
## 
### 
I run in, 15 minutes late for an interview with Lynne
Stopkewich, the director, co-writer and co-producer of
the film "Kissed." I'm afraid for the worst: She's a stuck
up snob irritated at a college student's inability to manage
time.
Fortunately, Stopkewich proved to be the complete op
posite, which may sound like the prototypical start of an in
terview with a movie star, but in this case it's entirely true
(which un-disillusioned me a little with the movie busi
ness). Between bites of a tunafish sandwich, Stopkewich
talked about her motivations, role models, future plans and
her most recent project, "Kissed," which premiered at the
Toronto International Film Festival in 1996. "Kissed" was
among five Canadian features showcased at the Indepen
dent Feature Film Market in New York.
Stopkewich grew up in suburbia Montreal. As a kid, she
wanted to be a writer and planned to go into journalism.
But at the age of 12, she took a film course, picked up a cam
era and made her first Super-8 film, titled "Pencils in Ac
tion," set to Elton John's "Bongo Rock." After that, she said,
"1 was encouraged that I might have some kind of talent or
some kind of vision with the visual arts. I'd always studied
painting, drawing, photography and sculpting . . . so it was
sort of a natural progression for me to want to tell a story vi
sually."
Among the next eight films that Stopkewich made were
"The Flipped Wig," a musical comedy about a girl's first trip
to the gynecologist, and"The $3 Wash & Set," an lonesco
like trip through a 1960s beauty salon. Both of these films
won festival awards in New York and San Francisco.
Stopkewich said that she couldn't imagine not making
movies. "I like to say it's like playing Barbies with adults (on)
the biggest live Barbie set in the world," she said. "It's a lot of
fun — that's really why I got into film in the first place. Now,
it's a lot about having to do with wanting to tell intelligent
stories. Right now, I'm interested in telling stories from the
perspective of female protagonists, but ultimately (I'm inter
ested in) making really interesting and engaging cinema."
"Kissed" fits that criterion in its portrayal of a young
woman named Sandra who discovers through an unusual
sexual obsession with the dead that love can "cross over" the

barrier of life. I he feature is
based on the short story
"We Seldom Look on
Love" by Canadian writer
Barbara (lovvdy.
"Initially I was drawn to
the strong and sensitive
voice of the main character,
a girl-next-door type,"
Stopkewich said. "After dis
covering the story, I
couldn't get her out of my
mind. I lere is a woman who
delivers an unapologetic
monologue describing the

development of her deviant
sexuality, yet nonetheless retains our interest and sympathy.
I loved that contrast, and the more 1 thought about it, the
more I saw it cinematically."
Immediately after she made the decision to adapt the
work for the screen, Stopkewich consulted with (iowdy and
started writing a rough draft.
The story "has a great sense of humor and irony to it that
1 wanted to maintain with the translation to the film," she
said. "It's easier to draw people into the film if they have a
chance to engage through humor and laughter."
Stopkewich later collaborated with screenwriter Angus
Fraser on several other drafts until they and (iowdy were
satisfied. During the next two years, she found investors to
fund the project. The investors, however, decided halfway
into the process that they would rescind their offer, leaving
Stopkewich to figure out another way to make the movie.
Between taking care of the business and practical aspects,
she shot the film in a record nine weeks.
Luckily, Stopkewich planned from the start that she would
be involved with "Kissed" at every level of the production:
" Though it was really difficult that way, at least I knew 'OK,
this is it. I'm making a movie now. No one's going to pull the
rug out from under me. I'm just going to do it.' "
And that made every moment all the more intense and ex
citing for her. "It was a riot," she said. "I had the best time.
One of the most rewarding parts was shooting the movie.
We'd be cracking jokes all the time, sort of in the face of death.
The other was sharing the film with my family, who I was ter
rified to tell what the film was about for the longest time.
"Telling (them) what the film was about ended up start
ing these conversations about death, mortality and life, ex
periences that they shared with me from their childhood.
And I'd never had a conversation like that with them. It was
just fantastic. So it takes going out and making a necrophile
movie to bring you closer to your family," she joked.
Stopkewich made the point that she is not altogether
comfortable with the subject of necrophilia. "It's quite re
pulsive; it's not a natural need," she said. "It was really chal
lenging material, and a fine line to walk between people
being repelled and not overly romanticizing (Sandra by say-

"I wish I was as bravo as sho is," sho said. "What I can ro
lato to is hoi c uriosity. Being a lllmmakor, I'm always curi
ous about now characters or now stories Irom another per

ify. I wish I could sit down and have coffee with her."
In the film, the term "crossing over" is used to describe
Sandra's sexual experiences with the dead. "I don't really
understand crossing over," Stopkcwich said, "because I'm
not the character.
"What we were trying to convey with that was the idea
that she's not only breaking a taboo, but she's trying to
achieve some sort of transcendence over death. Ami I think
that for her, she truly is transported somewhere else in those
moments ... in the way that we're taken somewhere else
when we make love with someone." U
