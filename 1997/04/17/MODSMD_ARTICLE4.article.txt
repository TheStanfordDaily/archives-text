# Farm workers gain student sympathy
## Spring break study trip, union rally bring attention to pickers' issues 
### Douglas Cajas 
The problems of agricultural workers in the
Central Valley are stirring up wide student in
terest in the real issues of "life on the Farm"
an interest that has inspired some to spend
spring break in a farm community and others to
join a unionization march.
MEChA, a Chicano/ Latino student group,
arranged to bus 84 people, most of them Stan
ford students, to Watsonville, Calif, for a
march last Sunday supporting efforts by the
United Farm Workers to organize local straw
berry pickers.

The purpose of the rally, as described by the
union and the AFL-CIO, was to support the
working rights of the 20,000 strawberry work
ers in California. Specific issues include lack of
clean water, clean bathrooms and health insur
ance.
The Stanford supporters of this drive joined
tens of thousands of people who marched
through Watsonville's downtown streets and af
terward heard speeches by, among others, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney and IJFW President Arturo Rodriguez.
Stanford junior Brian Babcock was among
the marchers and said it was "inspiring to be

around so many people."
He said the rally gave him hope and "will at
least open the eyes of the growers," who employ
the workers the union is trying to organize;.
MKChA co-chair Lubia Sanchez, a senior,
pointed out the campaign's slogan, "Five cents
for fairness." This refers to a UC-Davis study
that found that a five-cent per pint increase in
the retail price of strawberries would make it
possible to increase worker wages by about half.
"Five cents is nothing," Sanchez said. "We
see a nickel on the ground, but we don't neces-
sarily pick it up."
MEChA will continue to support
the union's efforts by lobbying at a
nearby Lucky's supermarket,
which has not yet signed the
pledge to support farm workers.
Delfina Garcia, a strawberry
picker, said she was marching be
cause of intolerable working con
ditions and wages. She described
picking strawberries for eight to
10 hours a day and being repri
manded by foremen for taking her
allotted work breaks.
She was optimistic about the
union's chance for success.
"Let's see how long the bosses
can stand without planting," Gar
cia said.
However, few of the marchers

actually appeared to be farm
workers. Many workers did watch
from the sidewalk; some of those
said they wouldn't march because
of the possible repercussions of
participating in the unionization
march.
Others were unsure of the ben
efits and success of the union, not
ing they had only had a five-cent
per hour raise over the course of
three years.
Looking at the same situation
through a different lens, six stu
dents visited strawberry pickers
and growers in Southern Califor
nia as part on a spring break trip
organized by Stanford Associated
Ministries.
Jim Burklo, a minister of the
United Campus Christian Min
istry, said the visit was intended to
explore how the farm workers'
struggles "relate to our commit
ment of faith.

"It means asking: 'Are we on
the side of the struggling small
farmer who is committing these vi
olations, or on the side of the farm
worker?' " some of whom contend
their rights are violated by these
family-run operations.
The small farmer is often at the
mercy of the companies in charge
of the cooling, marketing and dis
tribution of strawberries, Burklo
explained.
"I came out actually more con
fused," said senior Brooke Silvers,
because she discovered "some ex
aggerations on both sides."
Despite the complexity and
contradictions of the problem, Sil
vers did conclude that something
is clearly wrong.
After her visit to the farm coun
try, Silvers said she asked herself,
"How can this place that looks so
serene be surrounded by so many
dark issues?"
