" m % i F FRENCH ACTRESS SOPHIE MARCEAU WERE EVER STRANDED on a de
' ) sorted island with only five books, she would take works by William
Shakespeare, Franz Kafku and William Faulkner, Georg Stendhal's "Le
Roufje et Le Noir" and Leo Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina."
Little surprise, then, that Marceau recently played the famous Russian adul-

tress herself in the newest film version of "Anna
Karenina," her third American film.
Murceau is probably best known to American au
diences for her role as the beautiful French princess
who falls in love with Mel Gibson in "Braveheart."
Her most recent American film, "Firelight," will be re
leased next fall.
Seated in the lounge of the Prescott Hotel in San
Francisco, Marceau struck me as someone who
speaks from the heart, takes her life and work seri
ously and follows her own philosophies.
And yes, she is very beautiful in real life, though
I'm pretty certain I wouldn't recognize her if I saw her
walking down the street.

Intermission: Bernard Rose, the director of "Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina," de
scribed Anna as being someone who "could communicate a great deal without a histo
ry — who had a gorgeous, eloquent face and a mystery about her; aristocratic yet vul
nerable. A woman who could drive a man to a grand, dangerous adoration, but who
seemed to live without any calculation."
Sophie Murceuu: I think it is very true. I think she's a very noble character in
that she's like any other human being. She's not u superwoman who's able to do
things that nobody's able to do. Rut when people meet her, they feel there is
something very obstruct about her—- it's like being high on a cliff, you feel ver
tiyo.
That's why it's interesting to be involved with this kind of character, because
you have to go a little further than where society normally asks you to, because
nowadays society wunts you not to feel too much, not to say too much, not to act
too much.
I think she's a very well-educated woman, so she's not going to shout in the
middle of the room. But on the other hand, she's like anyone else, so she's ut
tracted by the physical aspect of a man; she's sexual. She's not a saint. She's a
very normal woman who loves. It's a very natural reflex.
A lot of women have lovers and say to themselves that time will cure every
thing and everybody will forget it. But she can't because she gives it too much
weight. When something goes wrong, she prefers to die rather than be that kind
of woman.
But I don't consider her death as something terrible. It's a choice and it's what
makes people different, because we are all made of the same pattern. What
sometimes is disturbing is easiness, lightness.
I like people who are heavier, who are a real pain in the neck, exigent, because I
think they have better results, and they bring out from you better results. Someone
who asks you to be better, to be more true, and that's the way she is.

I: I understand you have a 1
1/2-year-old son. In the movie,
Anna has a child she's really
attached to, but she ends up
giving up this child, Serezha,
for her lover, Vronsky. How do
you feel about her decision?
SM: It's q dramatic situa-

tion that's very hard to deal with, but I never wanted to do it in a dramatic way.
I wanted to keep the mother and son's relationship light, to show that they ure
complice. They understand each other.
Even though they know the situation is heavy and difficult, when you are a
mother, you keep it to yourself. You don't want to put this heaviness on your son's
shoulders. You don't have to explain that the situation is dramatic. It is terrible,

so you will not overact that.
This is what tragedy is. Tragedy only happens to happy people. |Anton)
Chekhov is tragic because it happens to a happy, quiet family in a very nice
house in the countryside and then suddenly, bam! Something irreversible.

You can't change it. Ahh . . . this is tragedy.
/: l)oyou think Anno made the right choice, then?

SM: I don't want to be a judge. She wasn't expecting a love affair.
She's not that kind of person. She had a good life with her husband.

child, and she's not running after young boys.
But then it happens, and how can you deal
with that?

I'm not sure we can resist love's effect,
even if it's exactly the opposite of what
you imagined it to be. You might say to
yourself, 'I will never have a mistress;
I will never have a lover.' But then
suddenly you see him and he sees
you, and there's something — chem
istry — which is maybe short and not
for the rest of your life, but you can't re-

sist.
Maybe it's just sexual, but I don't think
so. I think it's more than that. That's why
Anna's age is important. She's 28, and it's
also in a woman's life a kind of crossroads.
For Anna, she's already a mother — the
feeling that youth is behind and not in front
of you. So there is the necessity to feel desir
able to someone, or something new must
happen because you feel you are getting
older.
1 know as a woman of 30 years, that at
this age something new must happen.
Sometimes 30-year-old women, they'll cut
their hair. I'm sure there are cycles in peo
ple's biology.
I: It can also be your background, too, your
ideals, the way you build your dreams as you are
growing up....

SM: Yeah, this is the point when every
thing is more exposed, and it's the moment
when you have to make a choice. Anna is a
lover. She is a good wife. She is Mrs. Kareni
na. She has everything. And maybe she
missed something when she was younger.
Maybe she got married too young, she

was in love too young.
And now she has the need for
something to happen, or she
thinks, 'I'm going to be an old
wife, an old mother, for the rest
of my life.'

I: So do you feel that
you are at a crossroads right
now?

"I think literature is the highest form of egression, [higher] than paint
ing, than music; than cinema, which is a much louier art."
— Sophie Ularceau

They like each other. Maybe they love each other. She's very happy with her

SM: I wus, but my life is different in ci way because I became a moth
er at the point when Anna was already one. My crossroads was
being a mother, and it's like having a second life, having a big
boost in my life, tor her, it is the opposite. Maybe it happened to
her too young, and so at her crossroads, what were the possibili
ties for her at 28?

I: At the point of Anna's suicide, there is a shot of a little girl who is
falling into a pool of water. I'm supposing that this little girl represent
ed Anna as a child. What is your interpretation of that scene?
SM: 1 believe everything is related to our childhood. 1 am ab
solutely convinced about that. I'm not a Freudian. I don't believe
the sexual side ot it at all. But 1 really do believe that all our ways of
[comprehending] life come from childhood, how we are loved, how
we were raised. I'm sure we were made from almost 80 percent of
that.

The best way to direct the actor, if you want something
very emotional, is to go to his childhood. You can feel the fail
ure come from that moment. If you talk to people, right in
their eyes about this moment you can see. They can reject
it, but you can see that this is where it's coming from.
So suddenly this figure of Anna Karenina, she is

lonely like this little girl who falls into the water. How
can you hurt a child? They are innocent, and you for
give everything to a child.

I think that scene was a kind of compassionate
gesture just to say, 'We love you, we understand you
are so brittle now.' We have been fighting or loving
life or understanding life from this period in our lives.

/: How do you feel about books being translated into
film? Do you feel a film can bring something to the au
dience that a book can't?
SM: I think it's a very impossible exercise to

|make] a good film from a good book, because lit
erature is so much more powerful and freer and
intelligent than cinema is. So it's always very
frightening.
On the other hand, 1 do think that it is pos-

sible if you put a good book between someone's
very smart hands, like Bernard's, not to adapt,
because it's difficult to be more intelligent than
Tolstoy, but to just trust Tolstoy's observation
and advice about human nature. Not to be
smarter than him. You really can't. He really
knows what he's talking about.
We were always in contact with the book,

but we were also all so happy to be free from
the book. We cannot pretend to put the book
on the screen. It's impossible. You really have
to decide, 'OK, this is my film now.' But for
that you have to first be very sincere, very in
volved emotionally with this story and to also
have a very strong point of view.

In the book, the strength of Tolstoy is his writing,
his words. That's his way of translating his knowl
edge about everything. And in making a film you also
have the facility to formulate what you think and what

you are in some other art, which is the camera. You can
make this film your own film.
If you are a good painter, you can make a wonderful

painting on Anna Karenina, and you are going to be the best
on painting. Tolstoy is the best as the writer, and 1 think
Bernard did a great job as a director. 1 think literature is the
highest form of expression, Ihigher] than painting, than music;
than cinema, which is a much lower art.

I: Why lower?
SM: It's much lower because we depend on many things:
technology, a crew, an actor, a story, a reality. Books have
nothing to do with that. I mean it's just you. You can be very
involved in a film but you are so dependent on so many
things. There's no limit in writing. You can reinvent a

whole world. Cinema needs money. Literature costs nothing.
/: / understand you wrote a book culled "Menteu.se" ("liar"). How do you
feel about it since you believe that writing is the highest form of expression?
SM: Oh, 1 felt that exactly. 1 hat's why it's so difficult because you are
so free you get lost, and literature is how you make walls and how you
drive yourself where there is nothing. It's like reinventing the universe,
eternity, time, everything.
1 mean, well, it's hard to put the first word on the page, because every
thing is possible. Literature comes from nothing, emptiness. Hut 1 think
writing is a discipline, and the only way to write is to sit for an hour, for
10 minutes, for a whole day.
First you have to write with your ass and then with your mind
(laughs). I don't know what's going to come out. Hut it's wonderful. And
it's pain tul. I needed lour years to write this book. I didn't write every day.
I wrote on a typewriter that was very (imitates a typewriter) 'tchum,
tchum, tchum, tchum.'
I: Do you thinkyou will be doing any other American films?
SM: 1 don't know. It's a question ot what kind ot things they're asking me
to do. I'm not interested in American film perse; I'm interested in good film.
I: Do you like historical films.'
SM: Yeah, but for me it doesn't make a difference, historic al or mod-

em. For me, "Anna Karenina" is as modern as the stories you see now.
Even maybe more modern. It's just that we have costumes or corsets.
Historical films seem to give me more choices, especially in the Amer
ican business. It's a good way to be introduced to American cinema be
cause in a modern |film| they wouldn't need a French actress if the part
was American, except if they c hanged one line: 'Yeah, my brother was
French; my father was French,' then people would understand.
Otherwise there is no reason. But in "Anna Karenina" there was a rea
son.
I: There's a very international cast in "Leo lolstoy's Anna Karenina."
SM: Most are English, some Russians, two Americans, and French.
/: I think that makes it more interesting. It shows that it is a universal story,
that you don't have to be Russian to understand it.
SM: Yeah, I agree with you. I spoke with a Russian journalist in Chic a
go, and he was very, 'How dare they. They're not Russian.'
And 1 said, 'Listen, you're right. It was written by Tolstoy and I under
stand you. But it's more than only Russian. I'm French and I don't belong
to high society, but when I read it, she was me. Don't tell me she's only Russ
ian!'
She doesn't need to be only Russian. She can be whatever, and that
makes the book so much more interesting. That's true that it's Russian
society, and it's good if you can also make a good film about Russia.
But it doesn't explain all the psychology. It's more universal than
that. II
