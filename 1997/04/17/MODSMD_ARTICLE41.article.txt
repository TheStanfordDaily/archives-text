## Cory Cullinan "My Oyster" 
### 
Slick production, slightly offbeat humor
and Pink Floydian shifts in direction make
Menlo Park resident (lory Cullman's new
album .in amusing first listen. But one time
through is plenty because the transparent
artistic sensibilities of this album quickly be
come bland, uninteresting and confusing.
Cullman has a fantastic voice that he
uses in three ways. The lirst is as crooner
frontman ol a lounge act, the second is as
part ol a small ensemble ol trained
thoiisingers and the third is in duet. These
vocal arrangements lose their appeal
through unending repetition, and from the
constant use ol vocal exclamations tor
sound ellec I, it is painfully clear that (!ory
never recovered from his a cappella college
days.
This album has no modest sense of ac
complishmcnt to it. As il it wasn't clear, the
liner notes explain the title reference with a
trite definition ol "my oyster seemingly
taken Irom .1 dictionary. And if the three
pictures of c lean -faced smiling (iory (iulli
nan in the packaging did not trumpet his
sense of self worth and achievement
enough, the disc itself has .1 picture of the
world on it, on top of which is stamped
"(!ory t 'ullman My ()yster."
This album really is not a pearl. The hi/
/are splicing of rap clips in "My Oyster"

and archived television reports in "Little
Rock Don't Break" seem to hint that Cory
Cullinan has some sense of how musical
genres influence each other. Unfortunately,
the rest of the album fails to substantiate
that theory. He is mostly interested in
grand, roaring sounds and transitions to
distant places that mimic epic ballads by
rock acts like I'ink Floyd

and the Moody Blues.
The same sensibilities
that find pleasure in self
complacency over med
iocre artistic creation fail to
find a consistent musical
style for backing the promi
nent vocals. Big band and
bluegrass are thrown to
gether in "My Oyster,'" an
attempt to funk is made on
"Without You," a reach for
I c haikovskyesque violin to
tell a love tale is used on
" lake Some Time," and
there's even a horns-led
wait/ / march on "Never
Shatter You."
This lack of consistency
reinforces the sense that
Cory either wants to en
compass all genres or has no

clear idea about what type of sound lie real
ly wants to hack his vocals. Which is too had
because if he focused his musical support
and really worked at it, Cory Cullinan
could showcase his voice properly. And
maybe then his self-gratification would be
less obvious.
