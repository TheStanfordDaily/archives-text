## "Handsome" 
### 
It there is .1 portrait band for MTV's Alter
native Nation, its Handsome. Where did
these guys come from? Were they created lor
the sole purpose of opening for Bush, Silver
chair and Screaming Trees? I say we send 'em
home. I landsomc is definitely not the answer
for l )0s rock.
Ilandsoinc's sound involves .1 consistent
wavy, Hanger ish distortion that weaves to
gether all instruments into one big basket of
psychedelic solt core metal. It sounds incrcd
ibly professional my hat goes off to pro
ducer, engineer ami mixer lorry I )ate because
it seems that he makes I laiulsome sound . ..
more handsome using nitty studio tech
niqucs.
lb give credit where credit is due, the in
struincntals on the album are pretty interest
ing. loin ( apone and I'etor Mengede's gui
tars screech, warp and throb, while Iddie
Nappi's bass bubbles along with I'cte Mines'
drums in perfect sync, 100 bail the drums
bounce back and forth between mediocrity
and spastic torn rolls.
"doing to Panic" is carried by sludge pit
gutter bass and "get up and go" sledgeham
iner drums. It is one of the few songs 111 whith
I fines stops being la/y and starts playing.
The songs don't all sound the same either;
thev range from car stereo summer vacation

soundtracks to background music for
Sunkist commercials. "Left off leaven" is Def
Leppard 011 acid, while "Waiting" is kind of a
happy party radio song without the annoying
pop twist.
Handsome has metal aspirations but is
held back by medium-tempo rhythms and
go-nowhere vocals. It rocks OK, but it's not
like you just can't wait to hear what's next.
I he group does what it's supposed to do
the timing is good and the record has variety
but not very well. Date's tricks just aren't
i|uite enough to push Handsome over the
edge. I he album doesn't leave any sort of last
ing impression.
I here is a likableness to the group, but in
part this stems from the knowledge that
there's been much worse. Singer leremy
(lhatelain isn't as tough as he wants to sound;
besides, he does the same thing over and over,
producing self induced anger while hiding
behind a tone box. Boring vocals like "You
can't touch them / you can't reach
them / they want you / they need you" don't
do much for the record either.
On "Quiet Liar," the music slows down a
bit, which is good for Chatelain because it
frees him up to do what he does best — sing,
not shout. "I den C'omplex" starts out sound
ing unique, but ( hatelain can only do so

much with it. The distorted vocals just don't
cut it the 11th time around. On "Swimming,"
the vocals sound like they're performed by a
13-year-old hoy in a talent show.
Handsome, anyone? Thanks, hut no
thanks.
