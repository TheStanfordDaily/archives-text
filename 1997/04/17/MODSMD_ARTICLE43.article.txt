## "Get Some" 
### 
1 wasn't sure exactly what to expect
when I picked up Snot's new album,
"Get Some," but 1 knew it wouldn't be
pretty. It wasn't just the name of the
album; song titles like "Stoopid," "Get
Some," "Get Some O'Deez," "My Balls''
and the inventively named "Snot" made
me think I might not have a true master
piece on my hands. I was only half sur
prised.
Take 50 percent Rage Against the Ma
chine and 40 percent Pantera, add 10
percent Digital Undergound, and you've
got Snot. With funky bass lines and
drums that alternately thrash and
groove, you think, "It's gotta be Rage."
The Tom Morello-esque guitars only re
inforce those suspicions.
When lead "singer" Lynn Strait shows
his stuff, switching between nasal rap
ping a la Digital Underground and the
enraged scream of Pantera's Philip
Anselmo, you're not quite sure anymore.
It sure as hell confuses you, but the
sound really grabs you and makes you
want more.
Snot's strength definitely lies in its
thrash, as songs like "Deadfall" and "Joy
Ride" throw you directly into the mosh
pit. "Stoopid" is moderately catchy, with
a guitar riff ripped straight from Rage.
"Mr. Brett" is a pissed off "fuck you"
aimed at pseudo-punks.
Some of the slower tracks on the
album, however, truly bite. "Unplugged"
starts promisingly, with choppy guitar
augmented by Strait's screech. Disap
pointment sets in when the verse begins:
The tempo decreases, and guitarists
Mike Doling and Sonny Mayo slowly
pick minor chords (think Pantera's "This
Love," only not nearly as good).
In fact, one wonders why Snot both
ers to slow down at all; not only can't
Strait sing, but the band's attempts at
achieving any sort of groove are truly pa
thetic.
Lyrically, Snot is painfully abysmal.
The juvenile song titles don't hide any
deeper meaning: "My Balls" starts out
with Strait screaming, "My balls, your
chin!" and proceeds downhill from there
at full gallop. "Joy Ride" is about fast
cars, and most of the other lyrics are
equally trite or unintelligible.
One line that comes through loud
and clear and suggests what Snot is real
ly all about is from"I lust Lie": "I just lie
like you're taught, tellin' you what you
want to hear. What do you take me for?
That's what you need to feel before you
spread your legs for me."
That pretty much says it all: Snot can
thrash and rock like Rage and Pantera,
but unless you want to buy into their id
iotic misogyny, this album ain't for you.
