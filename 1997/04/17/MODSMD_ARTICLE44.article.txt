## Ani DiFranco "Living in Clip" 
### 
Ani DiFranco has been called many
things in her recent rise to stardom, from
diva to poetess to brilliant entrepreneur. But
here's something no one has thrown in the
mix: sellout? With the release of a live album
and rumors about a video deal with MTV,
some of Di Franco's early fans are skeptical.
Still, no one plays guitar like DiFranco
and she's a damn good poet — so let's put
hesitations aside for the moment and look at
her album.
"Living in Clip" is a double CM) released
(like her first six albums) on her own label,
Righteous Babe Records. II you haven't
heard anything by this folksy/ funky/ ass
kicker feminist / one-of-a-kind punkstress
before, you should get out there and see what
you think. If you have, this album is still
worth its weight.
"Living" captures the rawness of DiFran
io's voice and distinctive guitar playing, the
same qualities that make her live perfor
mances so electric. Her songs are quite dif
ferent in concert: The rhythms of her lyrics
are less forced and she sometimes screams,
sometimes whispers, especially on such clas
sics as "Willing to Fight," "Anticipate" and
"Fire Door."
There's also some new stuff on this
album, including two songs and some of her
quasi-serious cultural and artistic commen
tary. This femme fatale has a sense of humor,
and "Living" showcases her conversational
style with the audience (and her critics).

Speaking of her recent romantic release,
"Dilate," she savs that "all the righteous
babes, no just a couple of them that got their
panties on a little too tight, they're like all in
a twitch because they're like . . . they're like.
What happened to your politics, you just
gonna sell out? Is this a conscious move awa\
from overtly political songwriter la de da
de-da? and I'm like, 'No, man, it's just, it's
like, I got kind of. . .distracted.'"
Well, the new tunes on "Living" are sufli

ciently angry and righteous. "Hide .nul
Seek" tracks the history ol a young girl in the
neighborhood with Dilranco's signature
thoughtful irreverence, "(navel" is the surly
tale ol the end ol a relationship, sort ot a
twist on the earlier "Used to You," Iroin her
15)93 album "Puddle I >ive."
"Ama/ing (irace" and "both I lands" were
recorded \\ ith the Hull.ilo I'hilhai monic ()r
chestra conducted In Ihu Severinsen.
Ama/ing (irace" gains nothing Iroin this

reinterpretation ol her original reinterpreta
lion (she's so postmodern), aiul "Hoth
I lands" becomes a little more melodramatic
it ii.is its good moments, hut the original
is hettei. As sell proclaimed commander in
chiel ol her one woman army, l>ilranco
sounds best when she stands alone (with hei
guitar).
I he hest th ing .ihout I his allium, t hough,
is that the old l>il ratuo remains. She he
gins what is perhaps hei most touching
song, Tin No I Icroine," ipiietb and builds
the song ,is the audience follow s, Aon think
I wouldn't have them unless I could have
them In the halls / You think I nisi dish it
out, you don't think I take it at all / You

the rest / You think I'm usuallv wearing the
pants just cu/ I rarelv / weai ,i dress.'
So h.u k to the original question. A li lend
