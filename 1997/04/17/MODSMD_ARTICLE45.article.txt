# Natacha Atlas
## "Diaspora" 
### 
I wouldn't normally call myself a fan of world
music, hut there's something about the way this
album blends Western dance beats with Kastern
melodies and lyrics that makes it really cool.
The band includes the usual instruments — gui
tars, bass, drums, keyboards, violins and a few wind
instruments — plusa host of instruments I can't even
pronounce, let alone identify. Still, you can tell when
these other-worldly instruments are being played in
various songs: They add a rather mysterious quality
to the music, at least to my "Westernized" ears.
"Leysh Nat'arak" is a chant-like song that features
repetition without a dulling effect, beginning with a
simple refrain of strings setting the beat and entering
into vocal melody with percussive and choral hack
ground. A sequence of key changes keeps things in
teresting, and an instrumental solo helps to break up
the song and keep it from monotony.
The title song, "Diaspora," brings in a darker feel,
with a moving bass line keeping the rhythm and the
wavering voice of Natacha Atlas in the higher regis
ters. A low male voice recites the lyrics in Fnglish
( most of the album is not in English), but it is some
how not as annoying as the token low-talker in most

modern music of the Real Mc( loy genre.
Larry Whelan masterfully twists the sound capa
bilities of a clarinet on "Duden," so you don't even
recognize the instrument .it first. The song opens
with his solo and then moves into keyboard-accom
panied vocals and steady drum beats.
The lyrics in English are simple and yet strangely
compelling: "Remember when stars fell from the
sky / Fallen like words of love spoken / Too
true? /When you are with the one yon love/Your
nights shall last forever and .1 day. The romance is
only amplified by the foreign language (which I don't
recognize) in which the lyrics are sung.
Perhaps the strangest song on the album is "Inn
Does Not Exist.'' The title in English, but the only
words in English are "112 un, baby, does not exist. This
song still fits in musically with the rest of the album,
but the message is very cryptic and downright weird.
Still, the album as a whole captures beautifully the
traditional feel of world music and adds to its mys
tique with modern dance rhythms. It is definitely a
different sound for those who .ire looking for a dif
ferent sound.
