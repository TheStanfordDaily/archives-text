## Chasing Amy 
### 
Wli.it il the woman yon love had a past you couldn't handle?
That is the question addressed by "Chasing Amy," the
third and final installment in writer-director Kevin Smith's
"Mew Jersey" trilogy, which began with the hilarious "(Jerks
and continued with the slicker but less funny "Mallrats."
"(Phasing Amy" is more of an attempt at understanding
relationships than its predecessors. It's about I loklen (IWn
Affleck) and Hanky (Jason l.ee), childhood best friends and
co-creators of the popular comic book, "Bluntman and
( limine." ( The comic book's name should be some indica
lion that despite its dramatic intentions, "(Phasing Amy" is
by no means without Smith's trademark humor.)
I loklen and Banky are virtually inseparable until I lolden
meets the beautiful comic book artist Alyssa (ones (Joey
Lauren Adams) and immediately (.ills for her. Banky is, of
course, scornful, angry and hurt, especially when he finds
out that I lolden is completely in love with Alyssa despite the
fact he knows she's a lesbian. Hanky's overt animosity calls
into question the nature of his friendship with I lolden.
The rest of the movie explores the dynamics among these

three characters as they attempt to sort out their feelings for
each other. Because "(Phasing Amy" is supposed to be a love
story, we art- subjected to the requisite I-was-a-lesbian
until I met-you speech from Alyssa, which is embarrassing
in its assumption that Alyssa lias basically been biding her
time with women while waiting for 1 (olden to come along.
I'hcre is a definite chemistry between the characters, and
Affleck, Lee and Adams fit into their roles perfectly. Smith
has infused "(.basing Amy" with the same characteristically
raunchy, sarcastic and juvenile humor seen in his previous
two films. However, because Smith is actually attempting
drama in this effort, Ins jokes about lesbianism, female gen
italia and sexual experimentation end up leaving a bad taste
in your month.
"(Phasing Amy" is not a bad film — it's just a problemat
ic one. Smith attempts to explore the complexities ol love
and human relationships, but he can't seem to reconcile his
desire to make this movie a comedy. The result is a film as
confused as its characters.
