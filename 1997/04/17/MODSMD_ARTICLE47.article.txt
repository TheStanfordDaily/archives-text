# Keys to Tulsa

Some films leave you feeling uplifted; others
leave you in awe. but "Keys to I'ulsa," a prolessed
dramatic comedy by I eslie (ireil, leaves you won
del ing "whyi*" Why would anyone bother to pro
duce I 13 meaningless minutes?
Ihe lilin is about Richtei boudreau (Hie
Siolt/), .1 M) something rich kid who still runs to
mom ( Mary lyler Moore) lor money and obsesses
over his high school girlfriend, Vic kv Stover (I >eb
orah Kara I'nger). Vicky's oil tycoon parents died
shortb alter disowning her loi marrying Ronnie
(lames Spader), an abusive, stripper chasing dope
dealer. With N icky out ol the wilt, her brother,
Keith, a i rude, gun happy psychotic, runs the lam
ib estate, which doubles as a haven lor longtime
buddy Richtei and other wayward drunks.
So wh.it is the plot, you ask'f I here isn't one.
I Ins film is an unintriguing portrait of sex-crazed,
small town losers engaging in a string ol mean
inglcss events, doing drugs and playing u ith guns.
Nearly all the characters are introduced within the
liist 10 minutes, leaving the audience confused
about each person's part in the story. This confu

sion is never cleared up, however, because there is
mo concrete plot in which the characters can as
sume a role.
I he only coherent line in the film is a money
making scheme proposed hy Ronnie. Alter get
ling fired from his job at the Tulsa Journal and cut
of! by his mother, Richter agrees to help him
blackmail yet another rich kid, Bedford Shaw
(Marco I'erella), lor murdering I.aria (Lauren
Rochelle), who was the best friend of Ronnie's fa
vorite hooker, Cherry (loanna (ioing). Richter,
who owes Ronnie money, has no apparent role in
the plan except to house Cherry, who witnessed
the murder, 111 Keith s mansion.
It would be generous to call this a plot, howev
er. I lie scheme isn't even mentioned until the film
is well underway and the details are nonexistent.
I lie only function this plan has is to help Richter
reali/e he is in love with Ronnie's hooker, not his
seductive high school sweetheart.
I found it impossible to empathize with Richter
as lie, Vicky and the rest of the cast slept their way
through Tulsa in a mess of cigarette smoke and
more sweat than in "A lime

to Kill." Although there is
.111 attempt to give these
characters real emotions,
the two-dimensional acting
and inadequate direction
tail to provoke any senti
ment in the audience.
It amazes me that the
cast and crew were willing
to make this picture. The
story is empty and the
script poorly written. It is
an embarrassment to
movie making, and will he
an embarrassment to those
who spend $7.50 to see it.
