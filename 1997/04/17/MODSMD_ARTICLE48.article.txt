# Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina
## 
### 
It's not easy translating great works
of literature into film, especially if that
literature was written by Leo Tolstoy, the
Russian author known for spinning his
tory, philosophy, politics, morality, so
cial commentary and a darn good story
into an 800-page novel.
"Oh, not another period piece!" you
sigh, expecting to see the typically lavish
European scenery and exquisite 19th
century costumes. You know the plot:
Hoy meets girl. Girl longs to be rescued
from her stuffy parlor life. Boy and girl
fall in love. Boy suddenly leaves girl be
cause of society and / or family disap
proval. Girl is left utterly confused and
abandoned.
In the end, they either a) reunite and
get married (Jane Austen) or b) drift
apart and she commits suicide
(" Mada me Bova ry ").
So what makes the newest version of
"Anna Karenina" different? Unfortu
nately, I'm still trying to figure that out.
The complex story of the famous
Russian adulteress has been pared down
to a simple message of love. The movie
opens with Levin (Alfred Molina), the
"disillusioned but wealthy landowner,"
who reaches a crisis in his life when he
realizes that if he doesn't get married
soon, he might go through life without
ever having known love. The source of
warmth and hope in his life is Kitty (Mia
Kirshner), a "jilted society girl" who at
first refuses his advances because she has
her eyes set on Count Vronsky (Sean
Bean,"( ioldeneye"), "a dashing military

man with a noble title and a passionate
heart."
Vronsky runs into Anna Karenina
(Sophie Marceau, "Braveheart") at the
railroad station. Mrs. Karenina, mind
you. They pause. She eyes him regally
from behind her veil. 11c thinks, "I must
have this woman." And the rest is history.
"Anna Karenina" manages to break
away from the formula by contrasting
the tragedy of Anna and Vronsky with
the parallel story of Levin and Kitty.
Levins story seems tacked on, silly al
most, in comparison to the drama be
tween Anna and Vronsky.
Levin's self-discovery was an impor
tant moment to Tolstoy, and the film at
tempts this by having Levin sign Tol
stoy's name at the end of his narration.
But the message is lost in the translation.
Although the social-politics-translat
ed-into-dance take has become cliche
(see "Sense and Sensibility" and
"Emma"), the ballroom scene in "Anna
Karenina" is well done in terms of chore
ographing Kitty's realization that she has
lost Vronsky's favor, as well as Anna's fear
and exhilaration of being a married
woman in love with another man.
The Tchaikovsky waltz in the back
ground is an uplifting change from the
otherwise heavy material. For a minute
you are inside Anna's soul. But it is only
for a minute. I wanted the story to come
alive for me in a way that the book didn't,
but instead I left the theater dismissing
the film as "just another period piece."
