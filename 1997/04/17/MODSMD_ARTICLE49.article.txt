## Kissed 
### 
Having sex with dead people? Sure everyone wants to
watch a movie about that — yeah, if you're a psychopathic
nymphomaniac or a curious teenager out for a thrill. Even
with the recent trend of movies about unusual sex fetishes
witness "Crash" — a film centered around a necrophil
iac pushes the limits of daring and good money-making
acumen. Fortunately for those brave and interested
enough, "Kissed" reaches beyond its disturbing subject to
tell a powerful story about a woman who is unafraid of en
tering into the extremes of love, sex, death and the places
where they intersect.
The movie opens with Sandra Larson (Molly Parker),
your typical adolescent girl-next-door, sitting alone at a
party. She spends the summer with a friend dressing up
and burying dead animals that they come across. Un
known to her friend, Sandra returns to the burial spots at
night and digs up the animals to perform proper rituals.
I ler fascination with death continues through high school

and leads her to seek employment in a funeral parlor.
Here she finally understands how life can cross over into
death.
While she is studying embalming, Sandra meets Matt
(Peter Outerbridge), an eccentric medical student who ac
cepts her and her secret. And in his growing need to share
all ot the aspects of her life, he enters into her obsession by
watching her during her nightly visits to the funeral home.
It's true that "kissed is not for the faint ol heart, but it
you can get beyond some disturbing scenes, the film chal
lenges conventionality and the concept ol barriers in a sub
tle, thoughtful way. In addition, the director, l.ynne Stop
kewich, lightens the heavy scenes with a thread of self dep
recating humor. And as an added bonus, it's hard not to like
Sandra; she embodies strength and sell respect. II it
weren't tor her unusual, little . . . uh . . . interest, you might
even wish you were like her.
