At Alondra, Wednesday evening ac
tivities don't end with the weeklv house

meeting. The residents of the all-freshman
dormitory in Florence Moore Hall spend
the rest of the night turning the Stanford

campus into their campground through a
program called "Weekly Wilderness
Wednesdays."

"This is a chance to sleep under the stars,
in a different setting from normal dorm life,"
said junior Alex Young, a resident assistant
in Alondra and main organizer of the pro
crrnm

gram.
Young said that his idea to expose
freshmen to an outdoor setting was

rooted in his experience at the Stan
ford Sierra Camp last summer. His

hope is that they'll have the chance
to visit unfamiliar places and get
to know each other in a se- +

eluded environ
ment.

"The dorm is
usually crowded
and hectic, so it's nice

to relax with a small
group of people," fresh
man Caroline Sumpf

said, one of the regulars
to Weekly Wilderness
Wednesdays.
Each outing is at-

tended by six to 10 peo
ple. According to
Young, the trips are or-

ganized informally; he
gathers the students
about an hour after

the house meeting
adjourns. Depend
ing on the dis-

tance, they walk
or drive to their
campsite. They

take sleeping bags,
warm clothes, ground
cover, munchies, water

and occasionally something
to read aloud.
The students nor-

mally reach their site
around midnight, and
they stay up talking until 2

or 3 in the morning, Sumpf said.
Around 7 a.m., they awake to the rising sun —
or Young's portable alarm clock — and return
to the dorm in time to resume their busy
schedules.
"It doesn't matter where we go as long as
we get the chance to hang out with other peo
plein the dorm," Sumpf remarked.
The place the Alondra residents visit sets
the atmosphere for the evening. Their first
trip, for example, was simply an outing to fall
quarter intramural signups outside Roble
Gym. According to freshman Cara Dow, near
ly 20 people, a full third of the dorm, were
there.
"It was great," Dow said, remembering that
evening. "We played a hunch of' Get to Know
You'-type games."
The students have since gone camping by
the Mausoleum and the Rodin Sculpture (Jar
den, said Young. Toward the beginning of the
year, they slept out on the Flo Mo catwalks and
watched a lunar eclipse. They even camped in
the middle of Lake Lagunita when it was still
empty. Their most recent trip was a return to
IM signups for spring quarter.
