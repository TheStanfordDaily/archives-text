### Rito Treviño Contributing writer 
At Alondra, Wednesday evening ac
tivities don't end with the weeklv house

meeting. The residents of the all-freshman
dormitory in Florence Moore Hall spend
the rest of the night turning the Stanford

campus into their campground through a
program called "Weekly Wilderness
Wednesdays."

"This is a chance to sleep under the stars,
in a different setting from normal dorm life,"
said junior Alex Young, a resident assistant
in Alondra and main organizer of the pro
crrnm

gram.
Young said that his idea to expose
freshmen to an outdoor setting was

rooted in his experience at the Stan
ford Sierra Camp last summer. His

hope is that they'll have the chance
to visit unfamiliar places and get
to know each other in a se- +

eluded environ
ment.

"The dorm is
usually crowded
and hectic, so it's nice

to relax with a small
group of people," fresh
man Caroline Sumpf

said, one of the regulars
to Weekly Wilderness
Wednesdays.
Each outing is at-

tended by six to 10 peo
ple. According to
Young, the trips are or-

ganized informally; he
gathers the students
about an hour after

the house meeting
adjourns. Depend
ing on the dis-

tance, they walk
or drive to their
campsite. They

take sleeping bags,
warm clothes, ground
cover, munchies, water

and occasionally something
to read aloud.
The students nor-

mally reach their site
around midnight, and
they stay up talking until 2

or 3 in the morning, Sumpf said.
Around 7 a.m., they awake to the rising sun —
or Young's portable alarm clock — and return
to the dorm in time to resume their busy
schedules.
"It doesn't matter where we go as long as
we get the chance to hang out with other peo
plein the dorm," Sumpf remarked.
The place the Alondra residents visit sets
the atmosphere for the evening. Their first
trip, for example, was simply an outing to fall
quarter intramural signups outside Roble
Gym. According to freshman Cara Dow, near
ly 20 people, a full third of the dorm, were
there.
"It was great," Dow said, remembering that
evening. "We played a hunch of' Get to Know
You'-type games."
The students have since gone camping by
the Mausoleum and the Rodin Sculpture (Jar
den, said Young. Toward the beginning of the
year, they slept out on the Flo Mo catwalks and
watched a lunar eclipse. They even camped in
the middle of Lake Lagunita when it was still
empty. Their most recent trip was a return to
IM signups for spring quarter.

Almost every resident has been
to at least one of the Weekly Wilder
ness Wednesdays. The group al
ways varies, but Youngand a "core"
of four or five die-hard frosh out
doorsmen try to go every week.
Once in a while a friend or two from
outside the dormitory will tag
along.
Surprisingly, the people who go
on the trips haven't had many
gripes about the fact that they hap
pen in the middle of the school week.
"Wednesday is actually an ideal
night," Young explained. "People
get caught up in other social events
during the weekends, and the be
ginning of each week is more in
tense academically."
Freshman Jit Bhattacharya
agreed. "It's best in the middle of
the week because it's a release from
the pressures of school. You camp
out, relax for a while and come back
to start things all over again."
The camping trips have been
done on a regular weekly basis,
with weather being the only hin
drance. On some nights, it's just too
cold and rainy for even the best of
the Alondra outdoorsmen, accord
ing to Young. They had to postpone
the program during the entire win
ter quarter. On the other hand,
they've never actiuilly been rained
out of a trip once it was started.

The participants of the trips
have taken many memorable expe
riences with them. The trip to the
Mausoleum, for example, has stood
out in many of their minds. That
was the first night that they took
the initiative to bring poetry and
prose to read to the group.
"We brought candles and in
cense, and we ended up lying with
our heads together in a kind of star
formation," Sumpf said.
"It's been so long since I've read
aloud," Young noted. "It meant a
lot to them, and it's definitely some

thing that I'd like to do again."
The residents of Alondra have
an entire quarter ahead of them,
with opportunities to camp out in
new places. They're considering
trips to Flo Mo field, the Quad, the
Oval, the Dish, and possibly a real
beach. The dormitory is also plan
ning a major camping trip to Big
Sur.
"It's one of the best things that
I've experienced at Stanford,"
Bhattacharya said. "The nights are
always beautiful."
