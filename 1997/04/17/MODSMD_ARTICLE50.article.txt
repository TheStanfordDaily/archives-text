# Anaconda

### 
A disclaimer: Siskel and Ebcrt gave this one
"two thumbs up." Either there is something
terribly wrong with me, or I saw a totally dif
ferent film than they did. Better yet, maybe
they're just full of it.
"Anaconda" winds its way down the Ama
zon in search of a native tribe that appears to
he the focus of an upcoming documentary
film. The opening scene, much like the dra
matics found in the beginning of "Twister"
and "Jurassic Park," did interest me a little. 1
thought that perhaps the upcoming conflict
between man and snake might turn into an in
teresting parlay into the deep jungles outside
of civilization.
The first half of "Anaconda" introduces us
to the paper-thin characters, who are played
by a relatively well-known cast. Mysterious
snake-hunter Paul Sarone (Jon Voight, the
had guy in "Mission: Impossible") is rescued
by the film crew, which includes a sensual di
rector (Jennifer Lopez, "Selena"), a toughened
cinematographer (Ice Cube), a knowledge
able anthropologist (Eric Stoltz), and a snob
bish Brit (Jonathan Hyde, "Jumanji")

Attempting to add
to the tension of hav
ing speedy, man-eat
ing snakes around arc a
few predictable sub
plots. first, a bit of sex
ual uneasiness devel
ops between Lopez's
film director, named
Terri Florez, and
Sarone, and this is later
used to trap him The
captain is incapacitat
ed by a poisonous sea
creature, thus forcing

Flore/, into the position of guiding the ship.
Last of all, Sarone convinces Flore/, to take
a shortcut through a dangerous portion of
the Amazon without telling the crew about
his true intentions: to get tons of money by
catching an anaconda on videotape. Alter a
couple of hit-and-miss opportunities with
the 40-foot snake, the travelers eventually
find themselves in the heart of anaconda
country.

By this point, the film st.irts getting lucli
crously silly. The crew begins to lost' its mini
hers due to the coils ol one particularly evil
snake. Nobody seems to die very easily, and
the result is a neatly packaged, regurgitated
piece ol filmic (or is it human?) material.
Please believe me and not the popular two
critics on TV when I say thai Anaconda" is
truly a waste <>l c inematic time and cllort.
