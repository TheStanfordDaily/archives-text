new to filmmaking. I hey've been
workingon movies ever since Joel got
his start editing horror movies like
"I lie fvil Dead" in I SMI. They write
their screenplays together, and Joel
takes the credit for directing while
I than does the producing (in reality
they mix those roles i|uite often).
Their first movie, "Blood Simple"
(198-1), starred lohn (ietz .is a bar

tender who gets caught sleeping with
his boss's wile (Iranccs McDormand). The
bar owner (I )an I ledaya) hires .1 sleazy pri
vale iletei live (M. I ininett Walsh ) to kill the
two ol them, hnl things don't go as planned.
This movie hints .it the (,'oens' emerging
weirdness, hi 11 il lacks the inventive style ol
I heir later work. Il runs like a typical SOs
horror / thriller, and the lack <»l dialogue is
irritating.

"Raising Arizona" ( was a bigger hit
and has become a comedy classic. Here, a
young Nicholas Cage and I lolly I lunter are
.in ill matched couple who decide to kidnap
a baby from a local celebrity business owner
because they can't have one of their own.

While the directing is jumpy, the writing
flows much more smoothly. T his movie is
terrifically funny due to a mix of slapstick
and surrealism.
"Miller's (Tossing" (1990), is set in the
crime world of the 19205, (i.ibriel Byrne
plays .111 adviser to a crime boss (Albert
I inney) who gets in trouble again for
sleeping with the boss's girl and finds
himself in the rival Italian mob. This movie
is an homage to old gangster movies, and it
gave the ( oens recognition as strong stylists.
In "Barton I ink (1991), John Turturro
is a playwright turned Hollywood screen
writer who checks into a cheap hotel in an
attempt to escape the madness of l.os Ange
les. I here he suffers from a classic case of
writer's block, meets a former idol and runs
into an aggressive insurance salesman (lohn
(ioodman). "Barton l ink ' captures the rich

style of the 19405, includes some great act
ing and explores the symbolic realms of
screenwriting and social images.
Then there's "The Hudsucker Proxy"
(1994), one of my favorite sleeper films. It
stars Tim Kohbins as Norton Barnes, the
naive proxy-president of Hudsucker Indus
tries. The Hudsucker executives' plan to
send their stock plummeting is ruined when
Barnes invents the Hula Hoop and starts a
national craze. This movie has .1 perfect
blend ot fast-paced writing, stereotypical
and melodramatic characters and fantastic
imagery of late 1950s New York.
Finally, the Coen brothers created
"Fargo" (1996), based on a true story and set
in their native Minnesota. It's about a des
perate car salesman (William 11. Macy)
whose plan to collect the ransom on his own
wife's kidnapping goes wildly out of hand.
I'he kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter
Stormare) leave behind a bloody path of
death and destruction to be investigated by
the pregnant police chief (Frances McDor
mand) of Brainerd, Minn.
"Fargo" li.is some great moments of
comedy and tragedy. It reveals to us the
quirkiness of everyday life ( just listening to
the Midwesterners speak is a trip) and the
harsh consequences of simple actions. Mc-
Dormand, who now happens to be Joel's

wife, won the Oscar for best actress.
The Coen brothers have achieved much
for American filmmaking with a small,
powerful repertoire of movies. T heir next
film, "The Big Lebowski," will be released
later this year. But for now, you can find all
six of their films on video.
