## A 						time to record

What's the big deal about video?
I was pondering this one day on my way to
San Francisco when I came across a mother
filming her little boy who was trying in vain to
bicycle around using training wheels.
Then it occurred to me that I'd found the
answer to my question: The purpose ofvideo is
to record every pointless little moment of our
miserable lives until our homes are filled to the
brim with raw footage of ourselves and those
we love watching television, eating dinner and
sitting around bored at the birthday parties of
children who may or may not appeal to some
ideal of "cuteness" that resides in our collective
consciousness.
Also, it's an art form. Countless adults and
teens use video to save those special moments

after foreplay and before the Pall Malls for pos
terity. So 1 say "Live on, video! You are the jewel
in the crown that is my life, and I am glad to have
known you. So glad!" Or something like that.
But on a more somber note, video is good in
that it brings film as an art form to the masses.
This is both a blessing and a curse. By trying to
make movies in the style of Quentin Tarantino,
the amateur filmmaker learns about the neces
sity of extras and stuntmen, a good script and
adequate lighting.
More important, however, video helps the
amateur filmmaker learn to appreciate what
Quentin Tarantino does (not including "From
Dusk till Dawn" or any other movie in which
Tarantino showcases his acting skills).
And yes, I do know the difference between

film and video. My point is that video is the
poor (actually middle and upper-middle class)
man's film. By making art, we learn to decipher
it. We develop our palates as viewers and as
thinkers and grow in some abstract way. At
least sometimes. Those of us who do not glean
such benefits from video cameras at least have
a good time.
So it's a double-sided dollar bill. Video cam
eras allow every Tom, Juan and Sarah to make
shoddy movies about that morning's flossing.
They also serve as a cheap way for every Tom,
Juan and Sarah to make documentaries about
the state of gypsies in Spain, the tenets of their
religion so they can be accurately broadcast on
the evening news and any black men being
beaten by racist police officers.

Take a look at the movie "Fresh," for in
stance. Try making something along the cal
iber of "Fresh" using your Sony camcorder. If
you can do it, 1 applaud you.
But it's more likely that you just can't do it.
You don't have the patience or technical
prowess (or money) to do it. And even if you
did have all of those things, you would still be
an infinite number of steps away from what it
took to think up that lovely beginning.
Now don't you appreciate "Fresh"? Now
don't you appreciate video? Video is like that
machine that Zaphod Beeblebrox steps into in
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galax/': It tells us
how small we really are compared to some and
how large we are compared to whoever was in
charge of "A lime to Kill."
