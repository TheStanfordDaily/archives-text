# Violinist lectures on battle with epilepsy

### Saurabh Prakash 
Students attending Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's Psychology 1
class yesterday morning listened
intently to professional violinist
Martha Curtis play and speak
about overcoming epilepsy.
Curtis, an epileptic since age
3, appeared in Zimbardo's class
to discuss how her passion for
music has sustained her despite
her grave illness.

In between interludes of per
formance that filled the roon
with poignant and stirring airi
by Johann Sebastian Bach, Cur
tis described her struggles.
Before a packed auditorium
Curtis said, "It was my relation
ship with rny violin that kept. .
me driving forward the whoh
time." Introduced to music ii
early childhood, Curtis decider
to become a professional violin
ist at age 11.
As she grew older, her epilep
sy matured from "icky feelings"
into violent convulsions. She
had difficulty convincing sym
phony orchestras to let her play,
as her epileptic seizures would
sometimes interrupt recitals and
performances.
As her condition declined, the
medication in her blood ap
proached toxic levels, and Curtis
decided to undergo an operation
that would remove the parts of
her brain responsible for bring
ing on her seizures.
After three unsuccessful op
erations, "the doctors did not
want to do it," said Curtis. They
feared that removing the amyg
dala, a portion of the brain's
right temporal lobe responsible
for emotion, would destroy her
musical ability. Only her em

phatic and insistent prodding fi
nally convinced them to operate.
Although she lost more than
half of her amygdala, Curtis said
she plays better now.
"She's got a real zest for life,"
said Jim Hammel, a teaching as
sistant in Zimbardo's class. "She
gets up there and gives an enor
mously human element to
epilepsy."
In her determination to be her
own advocate, Curtis "is an ex
ample of how we should all be as
patients," said Zimbardo. That
spirit has paid off, and her musi
cal career has blossomed. Only a
few weeks ago she accompanied
violinist Yitzhak Perlman. Hol
lywood has plans to produce a
movie based on her life, Zimbar
do added.
Curtis sends "a message of
how people can triumph over ad
versity," Zimbardo said.
Sophomore Jennifer Test, a
student in the class, said Curtis
"makes me think of carpe diem\
she really did seize the day."
As a child, said Curtis, she

feared "being tied down in a
mental ward, fed and drugged
until I died." Epilepsy "was so
charged that I never said it out
loud."
When a former boyfriend dis
covered she had epilepsy, he told
her point-blank that he associat
ed epilepsy with leprosy. "I just
walked out of that room," Curtis
said.
Curtis "is a person who expe
rienced the most fearful traumas
but was never self-deprecating,"
said Zimbardo. Her boundless
energy and her core of self-confi
dence has given her the addition
al role of a healer. Speaking at
seminars and hospitals around
the country, Curtis spreads her
message of hope to people suffer
ing from epilepsy as well as to
those who are not.
Her struggle to deal with
epilepsy and its associated stig
ma was an exhausting daily bat
tle. "Victories had to happen
every day," she said. "I just keep
playing pieces that cadence in
victory."
