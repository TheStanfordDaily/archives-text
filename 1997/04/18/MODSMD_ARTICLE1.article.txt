# Casper launches Web site to rival U.S. News
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Stanford plans to create an alternative
centralized data source to supersede the
need to release information for U.S. News
& World Report's undergraduate rankings,
University President Gerhard Casper will
announce today.
This year, the University will release the
"objective" information about Stanford,
Casper said in today's statement that is

highly critical of the weekly newsmagazine.
The statement was obtained by The Daily
yesterday afternoon.
In the next year, University officials will
lobby other schools to release statistics to a
World Wide Web database, run by the Santa
Clara-based Web search engine Yahoo!, in
an attempt to create a viable alternative to
U.S. News' "misleading and inaccurate"
system of rankings, according to the state
ment.
"With such information, students and

their families would be able to review and
compare schools' programs and resources
directly, without the distortion of informa
tion that occurs in U.S. News' ranking sys
tem," Casper said.
The University today will unveil its own
undergraduate information — consisting of
statistics on enrollment, admissions rates,
graduation rates, class sizes, financial aid,
faculty and academic opportunities — on its
Web site (http://www.stanford.edu
/home/statistics).

Information on the Web is free, current
and "straight," said Terry Shepard, direc
tor of University communications. "You as
a student can decide how to compare
(schools) rather than using U.S. News' se
cret recipe."
"I think it's an excellent step," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson. "1
hope they'll make efforts to recruit other
schools to join in doing so. It will show just
how subjective U.S. News is."
Thompson, who started the Forget U.S.

News Coalition last fall, said next year's
coalition director will send a press release
today to other schools encouraging them to
lobby their administrations in favor of the
new system.
James Fallows, editor in chief of U.S.
News, said any source of information bene
fits students and parents in making their
decisions.
"We have always believed that more in-
formation is better. I would never
dream of students relying solely on
the U.S. News rankings," he said.
Many prospective freshmen and
parents who arrived yesterday at
Stanford for Admit Weekend said
they do not rely solely on the rank
ings or do not consider them at all.
"I have looked at it and have
friends who know each ranking,"
said Laura Horwitz, a prospective
freshman. "It hasn't really affected
my decision."
Most parents said th.it if infor
mation had been available on the
Web, they probably would have re
viewed it.
IJnevaluated information, how
ever, should not necessarily be be
lieved, said A 1 Sanoff, managinged
itor of U.S. News' annual rankings.
He questioned the credibility of the
proposed database.
"If all they're going to do is take
the information and put it on the
Web site without cross-checking
and vetting as we try to do, I'm not
sure just how credible all the infor
mation will be," he said.
Casper seriously considered
withholding all information from
the magazine this year, but after
discussions over the last month, he
decided only to withhold surveys
leading to other schools' "academic
reputation" ranking.
Academic reputation, which de

termines 25 percent of schools'
overall assessment by the maga
zine, is determined by votes of uni
versity presidents, chief academic
officers and directors of admis
sions. Each is asked to rank hun
dreds of schools on a scale of one to
five.
Neither Casper, Provost Con
doleezza Rice nor Dean of Under
graduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid James Montoya will sub
mit their forms this year. Casper,
who called the data "subjective,
reputational votes," has not sub
mitted his form for the last few
years, Shepard said.
This year, Stanford attempted
to convince a number of universi
ties to announce jointly their in
tent to withhold information.
"There was a lot of sentiment
we were right. But there was not a
critical mass of people who could
make the jump to not giving [U.S.
News] information," Shepard
said. "No one wanted to be in the
situation to say, 'We don't want to
give data out.' "
Next year, however, Stanford
will withhold all data from the
magazine if there are no changes
in the magazine's survey system
and if there exists an alternative
source of information for students
and parents, Shepard said.
Casper said three changes are
necessary to the survey practices:
• That the magazine eliminate
its rankings of colleges "like auto
mobiles or toasters."
• That the magazine not draw

"inappropriate conclusions" from
data. Casper criticized the maga
zine's new "value-added" catego
ry, which compares predicted
graduation rates based on SAT
scores and actual graduation
rates.
• That the magazine not substi
tute data in place of official univer
sity statistics. "It is surely a viola
tion of the standards of journalism
to invent 'facts,' " Casper said.
U.S. News does plan to change
parts of this year's rankings, which
will be released in August, Sanoff
said. However, the magazine will
not abolish the rankings and "those
discussions and the decisions that
flow out of them will not be changed
by this statement," he said.
Sanoff, who called the language
used in criticizing the ranking sys
tem "specious and spurious," said
colleges typically shun any attempt
by non-academics to evaluate acad
emia.
"Somehow, people in higher ed
ucation seem to think that we are
distorting the very nature of educa
tional institutions by what we do,"
he said. "We reject every such con
tention."
Yesterday's exchange of barbs
likely will not continue, as Stanford
is not "at war" with U.S. News,
Shepard said.
But in the future, Shepard said,
he and Casper will try to solicit sup
port only in large group situations,
such as meetings of the American
Association of Universities.
