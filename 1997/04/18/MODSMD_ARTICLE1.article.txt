Stanford plans to create an alternative
centralized data source to supersede the
need to release information for U.S. News
& World Report's undergraduate rankings,
University President Gerhard Casper will
announce today.
This year, the University will release the
"objective" information about Stanford,
Casper said in today's statement that is

highly critical of the weekly newsmagazine.

cret recipe."
"I think it's an excellent step," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson. "1
hope they'll make efforts to recruit other
schools to join in doing so. It will show just
how subjective U.S. News is."
Thompson, who started the Forget U.S.

News Coalition last fall, said next year's
coalition director will send a press release
today to other schools encouraging them to
lobby their administrations in favor of the
new system.
James Fallows, editor in chief of U.S.
News, said any source of information bene

decisions.
"We have always believed that more in-
