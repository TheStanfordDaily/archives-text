## Israeli prime minister says he'll remain in office despite allegations of fraud and influence peddling 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Defiant in the face of an
influence-peddling scandal, Benjamin Netanyahu
vowed yesterday to hang tough through calls for his
resignation. "We're not going anywhere," he told
supporters.
The government, and efforts to revive the peace
process, have virtually stopped while Israelis wait to
find out whether prosecutors will follow police
advice and charge the prime minister with fraud and
breach of trust.
The police recommendation that Netanyahu and
three key allies be charged in the scandal has fueled
speculation about — and calls for — an early end to
his stormy 10-month reign. Prosecutors' decision
was expected by Sunday.
At his Likud Party's headquarters in Tel Aviv,
Netanyahu suggested his government was under a
politically motivated attack for its policies to keep
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and all of
Jerusalem under Israeli rule. He told his cheering
supporters that "the truth will be victorious."
"We are not going anywhere," Netanyahu said.
"We are staying in the place where the people and his
tory put us, and we will continue to lead this people."
The scandal stems from Netanyahu's decision in
January to appoint Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On
as attorney general. Bar-On resigned after a day in
office amid a storm of criticism that he was unquali
fied.
Days later, Israel TV alleged that the appoint
ment was part of a conspiracy by senior officials who
expected Bar-On to end the corruption trial of Aryeh
Deri, head of the Shas religious party. Deri was to
ensure in return that the Shas' two Cabinet minis
ters gave Netanyahu the majority needed to approve
the Israeli troop pullback from most of the West
Bank town of Hebron.
Netanyahu denied the allegations and called for
the inquiry. After a 12-week investigation, police
handed in their 995-page report Tuesday.
In addition to recommending that Netanyahu be
indicted, they advised that Deri be charged with black
mail and that Netanyahu's aide, Avigdor Lieberman,
and Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi be charged with
breach of trust. Lieberman allegedly relayed Deri's
threats to Netanyahu and Hanegbi is accused of mis

leading the Cabinet about Bar-On's qualifications.
The crisis has overshadowed the latest mission by
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross, who has met with
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
try to revive the disintegrating peace process.
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said little progress was expected until
prosecutors make a decision.
Arafat — whose relationship with Netanyahu
often has been antagonistic — reportedly was receiv
ing half-hour updates on the crisis.
The development nipped budding efforts to estab
lish a Likud-Labor coalition that would be freer than
Netanyahu's current right-wing coalition govern
ment to make concessions to the Palestinians.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres,
who had been the leading proponent of such a union,
called the police accusations a "political earthquake"
yesterday. Labor's Knesset caucus, meeting in Tel
Aviv, said Netanyahu had "lost his moral basis to
rule" and should resign immediately.
Even Moshe Katsav, the transport minister and
Netanyahu's deputy premier, said that if an indict
ment is brought, "then certainly the government
will not be able to continue functioning."
Netanyahu, 47, would not be obliged to resign
even if convicted. But several allies have hinted they
may bolt the ruling coalition and deprive Netanyahu
of his parliamentary majority.
There are, however, several scenarios that could
bring new elections:
• If no charges are pressed, Netanyahu could call
a vote to clear his name and campaign as a victim of
the media and elites who never could accept him.
• If charges are brought, Netanyahu might resign
or he could be impeached by a vote of 61 Knesset
members. Either would force elections.
• If charges are brought and Netanyahu insists on
remaining in office, the Supreme Court could force
him to resign or suspend himself.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court rejected a request
by liberal lawmaker Avraham Poraz to have the
court require Netanyahu's immediate suspension.
Commentators suggested that self-suspension
coupled with a quick trial ending in acquittal would
be Netanyahu's best bet to clear his name.
