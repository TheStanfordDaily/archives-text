# Bob Dole gives Gingrich $300,000 to pay ethics fine
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a startling bid to close
the books on his ethics case, Speaker Newt Gingrich
announced yesterday he would borrow $300,000 from
retired Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to pay a sanc
tion imposed for violation of House rules.
Gingrich told a rapt audience in the House chamber
he had a "moral obligation" to make the payment him
self. Anything else, including establishment of a legal
defense fund, he said, "would simply be seen as one
more politician shirking his duty and one more exam
ple of failing to do the right thing."
With his wife, Marianne, looking down from her
seat in the visitors' gallery, Gingrich took responsibil
ity for his case., and said, "To the degree I have made
mistakes, they have been errors of implementation
but never of intent."
Documents released by the speaker's office said the
loan was for a term of eight years, with simple interest
at an annual rate of 10 percent. J. Randolph Evans,
Gingrich's attorney, said no payment is required until
the loan is due in 2005. Gingrich, no longer eligible to
be speaker by then, could well be out of Congress and
able to earn substantial money as a private citizen.
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Mis
souri released a statement saying the "unusual loan
arrangement" should be reviewed by the ethics
committee — a process that Gingrich's office said
was already under way.
Several other Democrats were far more critical,
noting that Dole now works for a law firm that lobbies
for a long list of corporate clients.
Officials said Dole, the losing GOP candidate in last
fall's presidential campaign, offered to lend the money

to Gingrich two or three weeks ago. The two men —
antagonists who became political partners over the
course of two decades — signed the loan papers Tues
day evening on Gingrich's private balcony overlooking
the Washington Mall.
"I wanted to help the Republican party and to
help Newt Gingrich get this behind him . . . and
move ahead with the Republican agenda," Dole told
reporters. He said the money would come from his
own savings.
Republicans chorused support for Gingrich's deci
sion and said it was time to nut the ethics case to rest.
"He decided to hold himself to the highest standard
possible," said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
A few Democrats lined up to shake Gingrich's hand
and offer congratulations after he completed his
remarks to the House. Others, though, swiftly
renewed their attack on the first Republican speaker
in 40 years.
"What average American could walk into their
local bank — take out a commercial loan for $300,000
with no collateral and no payments due until 2005?"
asked Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, Gingrich's
most vocal critic. "And on top of that, he wants to bor
row the money from a former politician who recently
signed on with one of the largest lobbying firms in
Washington."
Associates have warned Gingrich for months he
risked his hold on power if he turned to campaign
funds or a legal defense fund to make his payment.
It has only been in the past week that Gingrich
came to accept that advice, according to Republican
associates.
