### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The tobacco industry
may lose a nearly 10-year-old shield against person
al injury lawsuits in California.
By a 28-9 roll call, the Senate yesterday sent the
Assembly a bill that would drop tobacco from a
statute that bars suits against manufacturers and
sellers of consumer products that are widely known
to be inherently unsafe.
"This is a serious subject for a good many individ
uals," said the measure's author, Sen. Quentin Kopp,
I-San Francisco. "(Prior) law should be restored."
But Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Temecula, complained
that the Senate was singling out an unpopular prod
uct for special treatment.
"There is no question that tobacco is inherently
unsafe," he said. "Alcohol is inherently unsafe. Sugar
has the capability of hurting people, particularly if
you are a diabetic. Butter can clog your arteries.
"But we are only removing tobacco because tobac

co is the politically incorrect product du jour.
"We should not be giving money to people who
engage in irresponsible behavior," he added. "They
ought to suffer the consequences if they smoke."
Another opponent, Sen. Pete Knight, It-Lancast
er, noted that sunlight can cause skin cancer. "And
yet the state of California encourages scantily clad
people to lounge around on the beaches. What are
we going to do with this one?" he said, asking if the
state should close its beaches.
"If cigarettes are that had and we cannot afford
them, let's make smoking illegal," lu? added.
Hut hill supporters said tobacco is different from
some other unsafe products because of its addictive
and deadly nature and because tobacco companies
have UHed deceptive marketing practices.
"If you drink too much castor oil, you might get a
case oi diarrhea," said Sen. Mike Thompson, IJ-St.
Helena, "If you smoke cigarettes, you die."
