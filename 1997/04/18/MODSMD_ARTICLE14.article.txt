Jets nearly collide over Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two jumbo jetliners
nearly collided over the city while approaching
Los Angeles International Airport after a pilot
failed to follow controller instructions, officials
said yesterday.
A Brazilian VASP MD-l 1 veered in front of a
KLM Dutch Royal Airlines Boeing 747-B about
12:30 p.m. Wednesday, forcing the KLM jet into
an evasive maneuver. Loth aircraft landed safely.
A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
did not know how close the airliners came to each
other, but an air traffic controllers union
spokesman said it was a matter of several hun
dred feet.
The aircraft were 200 to 400 feet apart at one
point about 10 miles east of the airport over
densely populated South Central Los Angeles,
said Kevin Mcfirath, a National Air Traffic Con
trollers Association spokesman.
"The two targets merged on the radar scope,"
McGrath said. "The controller watching this was

helpless. The individuals working the aircraft
were pretty shook up about it."
The FAA said the distance remained under
investigation.
Surgery will not faze Terminator
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger's elective heart surgery shows the brawny
star is vulnerable in real life, but it is unlikely to
affect his action movie career, colleagues and fans
said yesterday.
"Arnold is Arnold," said moviegoer David
Williams of Newport Leach. "As long as he looks
the same on the outside, I don't care what's on the
inside."
Schwarzenegger, 49, was recovering yesterday
after undergoing replacement of a faulty aortic
valve the day before and was listed in stable con
dition, spokeswoman Catherine Olim said.
The bodybuilder-turned-actor was expected to
return to full health without any changes in bis
lifestyle or need for further treatment, Olim said.
