## Editorial Welcome to the Farm 
### 
Here's why this year's
admits should join
the Class of 2001

FIRST OP 1 ALL, congratula
tions. Only 15.5 percent of
applicants to Stanford were
mailed that magic package this
year — and those 2,604 prospec
tive freshmen from all over the
country and the world have a
wonderful opportunity in front of
them.
Of course, you have to make
the big decision first. That's why,
we assume, many of you came to
visit the Farm this weekend. We
know you are going to have a
great time as pro fros (please do
not use the title "Stanford Admit
Weekender") but we also know
that some of you are still weigh
ing your options.
Here's why you should go to
Stanford:
• The weather: Don't say you
haven't noticed. It's beautiful
here. Sure, there's always the
possibility of some rain and the
temperature sometimes falls into
the 50s — but at least we can
guarantee that you will never
have to trudge to class in snow.
(Try to get that kind of promise
from The Harvard Crimson).
And for those of you who
appreciate the occasional
snowflake, no worries — Tahoe
and all the snow you could want
are just a few hours away. And the
beach is just a short trip in the
other direction. Start thinking
about those dorm trips next year.
• The people: They're nice.
Stanford students are all
extremely intelligent, but most of
us are also down-to-earth and
relaxed. We like to work, but we
like to have fun, too. It's all part
of the Stanford experience.
Although we study hard, Stan
ford doesn't suffer from the cut
throat competitive environment
that you find at some other

schools.
• The location: We're in Califor
nia, for pete's sake. OK, some of
you East Coasters might be a bit
skittish about things like earth
quakes, floods and fires, but you
can't argue with the statement
that it's the most exciting state in
the Union.
Stanford is less than an hour
from San Francisco, a city that
everyone should agree is at least
. . . interesting. Don't forget you
can catch a train up to the City at
a station right near campus. Plus,
we're far enough away from
Berkeley to be safe from catching
that Weenie disease.
More generally, Stanford's Cal
ifornia location places it on the
edge of the most dynamic area in
the world — the Pacific Rim.
Believe us, the world is changing
fast, and Stanford is poised to
move right along with it. Don't
even try to argue that New Jersey
is where the action is nowadays.
• Campus life: To provide a
common freshman experience
you'll spend your first year in a
dorm, but after that you'll have
lots of options — the Greek sys
tem, small houses and co-ops,
suites and, of course, more dorms.
There's always something to do
on the Farm, ranging from sport
ing events to all-campus parties
to hanging out at the Co Ho (ask a
student about what that means).
Plus, Stanford's campus is very
safe — at what other school is
bicycle theft the most common
crime?
The only thing East Coast
schools have on us is age and tra
dition. If you want to live in dilap
idated dorms at a school that brags
about the fact that it produced 10
presidents, go for it. But if you
want to be a part of a tradition of
great academics combined with
stellar athletic and extracurricular
activities, check "yes" and mail in
that letter to Dean Montoya today.
Better yet, go to Old Union right
now and tell him in person you'll
be coming here in the fall.
You won't regret it.
