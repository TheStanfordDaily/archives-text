Campaign for ASSU Senate reeked of self-parody

WERE I NOT running for ASSU
Senate this week, I wouldn't
have agreed much with Jordan
Gelber's column yesterday, titled "You
can kiss my ASSU." As it is, I don't fully
see eye to eye with Gelber's points con
cerning the practicality of the ASSU, yet
his remarks concerning the impropriety
of the various campaigns are ones I (and
many others) have come to echo
throughout this election week.
At a university with some of the
brightest students in the world, it's
frightening to witness (and experience)
what it takes to win a seat in the ASSU
Senate. Granted, the senate doesn't

exactly save the world with each majori
ty vote; it does, however, act seriously
towards the students' best interests.
Once elections are over, that is.
If you've taken a look at your dorm's
hallway or White Plaza this week, and
you've been hit in the face with a massive
gob of fluorescence and 72-point type. It
doesn't matter if your dorm is flier-free; I
guarantee you it's been wallpapered.
Catchy slogans and funny wordplay
abound. Sometimes pictures. Anything
for one to differentiate itself from the
tens of other advertisements. Few and
far between are the posters with actual,
pertinent issues. Most likely they've

been covered up by the latest output
from Candidate So-and-So urging you to
vote because he puts up neon flyers and
has a memorable name.
But these tactics are absolutely neces
sary in an election where you're allowed
to vote for 15 candidates from a list of 30-
plus. Unless you've got a reputation a
mile long, you're going to have to distin
guish yourself from the rest of the crowd.
There has to be something to make your
name stand out on that ballot.
It's absurd that candidates have to
resort to such methods; without them,
however, losing the election is nearly
inevitable. As such, I (and most of the

other senate hopefuls) have spent a
week trying to outdo one another with
our creativity and ability to rhyme our
last names with something recognizable.
Until the voting process is altered,
perhaps via a representative system
(e.g., four senators per class), the flurry
of slogans and neon will continue every
year. The candidates with the best slo
gans, not necessarily those who are most
qualified or have the best ideas, will con
tinue to win. Perhaps this is the cause
for the lack of productivity Gelber
detects in the ASSU.
