# Health Services gives us too much to read
## 
### 
A couple of weeks ago the postman car
ried to our door — and presumably to the
doors of may other retired professors — a
gigantic cardboard box containing many
pounds of catalogs and a free totebag with
"Stanford Health Services" imprinted on
it. In the current celebrated spirit of free
enterprise, the catalogs touted various
health care plans. Photos on glossy paper
of carefree, well-scrubbed, healthy seniors

bursting with energy were intended, one
supposes, as leavening agents for the
mind-boggling details of medical services
offered — and not offered. To read
through a fraction of this monster would
mean postponing all other activities
including flossing for at least one week.
Wouldn't it be wonderful for every
one, including the trees, if, as putative
members of the "Stanford family," we
could trust Stanford Health Services to
provide us with the best possible health
plan, set out in understandable English?
