# Limited modem access puts financial burden on students' shoulders
## 
### 
How kind of the University to block
our access to the modem pool starting
next year. Those of us on campus find
ourselves being coerced into investing
$45, plus hardware, for an in-room con
nection because, as the Wednesday artick
stated, "The University had neither the
resources nor the funds to increase the

number of connections the modem pool
could handle."
In other words, given the choice
between (A) spending a few hundred or
a few thousand dollars on new dial-in
hardware so that more than a few stu
dents could have network access free of
charge or (B) spending nothing on new
hardware and as a result getting more
students to pay them for in-room
access, the University chose (B). Tough
choice.
