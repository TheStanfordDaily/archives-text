### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate discussed
the possible merger of four policy
oriented programs yesterday while
reauthorizing several interdiscipli
nary curricula including the pro
grams in Science, Technology and
Society and East Asian Studies.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll, the
director of the Public Policy Pro
gram, announced that internation
al relations, international policy
studies, public policy and urban
studies are exploring the potential
of combining their forces.
If the integrated policy program
forms, it would likely offer an un
dergraduate degree as well as a
coterminal program. In terms of
numbers of students, it could cre
ate one of the largest programs of
its kind in the nation, Noll said.
Such a program would have a
"special strength" at Stanford,
Noll added, because of the Univer
sity's leadership in the fields of
modern information technology,
decision theory and institutional
design.
Discussion about the possible
integration is continuing, Interna
tional Policy Studies Chair and
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Ju
dith Goldstein said after the senate
meeting. Consequently, "lots and
lots of relevant faculty will have an
opportunity to weigh in on the de
cisions."
"International relations and

urban studies are not disappear
ing," she cautioned. "We are ex
ploring ways to make each of our
programs stronger by working to
gether."
Stephen Haber, associate dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, echoed these sentiments.
"We are having broad conversa
tions with faculty members about
the possibilities," Haber said. He
also noted that no formal proposal
has yet been submitted.
For now, the four policy-orient
ed programs will move to the same
physical location in Building 60,
Goldstein said.
Noll's announcement came
amid the senate's review of under
graduate interdisciplinary pro
grams. The Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommended
that the senate reauthorize the
East Asian Studies Program; the
Program in Science, Technology
and Society; the honors program in
education and the Public Policy
Program. Every one of the recom
mendations met unanimous ap
proval.
According to undergraduate
studies committee chair Anne Fer
nald, a psychology professor, the
Humanities and Sciences Curricu
lum Committee had recommended
the termination of East Asian
Studies. It felt the curriculum did
not put sufficient emphasis on so
cial sciences and suggested that it
