# Fac Sen reapproves IDPs
## Profs also discuss program merger 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate discussed
the possible merger of four policy
oriented programs yesterday while
reauthorizing several interdiscipli
nary curricula including the pro
grams in Science, Technology and
Society and East Asian Studies.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll, the
director of the Public Policy Pro
gram, announced that internation
al relations, international policy
studies, public policy and urban
studies are exploring the potential
of combining their forces.
If the integrated policy program
forms, it would likely offer an un
dergraduate degree as well as a
coterminal program. In terms of
numbers of students, it could cre
ate one of the largest programs of
its kind in the nation, Noll said.
Such a program would have a
"special strength" at Stanford,
Noll added, because of the Univer
sity's leadership in the fields of
modern information technology,
decision theory and institutional
design.
Discussion about the possible
integration is continuing, Interna
tional Policy Studies Chair and
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Ju
dith Goldstein said after the senate
meeting. Consequently, "lots and
lots of relevant faculty will have an
opportunity to weigh in on the de
cisions."
"International relations and

urban studies are not disappear
ing," she cautioned. "We are ex
ploring ways to make each of our
programs stronger by working to
gether."
Stephen Haber, associate dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, echoed these sentiments.
"We are having broad conversa
tions with faculty members about
the possibilities," Haber said. He
also noted that no formal proposal
has yet been submitted.
For now, the four policy-orient
ed programs will move to the same
physical location in Building 60,
Goldstein said.
Noll's announcement came
amid the senate's review of under
graduate interdisciplinary pro
grams. The Committee on Under
graduate Studies recommended
that the senate reauthorize the
East Asian Studies Program; the
Program in Science, Technology
and Society; the honors program in
education and the Public Policy
Program. Every one of the recom
mendations met unanimous ap
proval.
According to undergraduate
studies committee chair Anne Fer
nald, a psychology professor, the
Humanities and Sciences Curricu
lum Committee had recommended
the termination of East Asian
Studies. It felt the curriculum did
not put sufficient emphasis on so
cial sciences and suggested that it
could be covered by the Depart
ment of Asian Languages and in
ternational relations.
In May 1996, the senate had
reauthorized East Asian studies
for one year and placed a moratori
um on undergraduates declaring it
as a major.
After considering an appeal and
reviewing other relevant informa
tion, the undergraduate studies
committee, as well as the deans of
Humanities and Sciences, recom
mended a two-year reauthoriza
tion period, allowing East Asian
studies to make curricular
changes. The senate also lifted the
moratorium on declaring an East
Asian studies major.

Center for East Asian Studies
Director Peter Duus also noted
that the program's faculty may de
velop a new introductory "gateway
course" for undergraduates in ad
dition to possibly reconfiguring the
major itself.
The viability of the STS pro
gram came into question last year,
when, according to Senior Assoc.
Dean of the School of Engineering
John Bravman, it was undermined
by "the lack of significant, sus
tained faculty involvement."
However, the program received
"enthusiastic support from cur
rent students and alumni," who or
ganized an effort to reach out to
faculty, Fernald said.
Haber reported that a search for
a new permanent STS director is
under way and "will continue with
all due haste." Discussions with
one potential candidate are ongo

ing, but no decision has been
reached, he said.
The senate approved a recom
mendation to extend the STS pro
gram until August 1999 and lifted
the moratorium on declaring STS
as an undergraduate major.
In addition, the honors program
in education received a five-year
reauthorization from the senate.
Fernald called the program's par
ticipants "happy campers" and
conveyed a recommendation from
the committee to expand the pro
gram.
The Public Policy Program was
likewise praised by Fernald. The
program is "a model IDP" and
"embodies the qualities of commit
ment to teaching and curriculum,"
she said.
The program received the sen
ate's reauthorization for eight
years.
