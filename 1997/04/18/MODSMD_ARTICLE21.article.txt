CARLOS IMMIGRATED TO Moun
tain View from El Salvador when we
were both 16. He grinned shyly. My
crush was instant.
Carlos gradually gained a tough walk.
He wore his baggy pants and his tight
white tank top. But our greetings in the
halls were innocent flirtations. They
seemed to me to be somehow saturated
with a sense of potential. In our world of
tangential circles, maybe we could grab
hands at the point where the circles met.
That November, Prop. 187, a measure
denying health care and education to ille
gal immigrants, was voted into law. In
most of my classes, students fidgeted while
teachers lectured. In the English as a Sec
ond Language classrooms, everyone not
crying sat rigidly still. "Yo quiero matar
este Pete Wilsonl" said one student. "I
want to kill t"he governor."
"No," said Carlos, "el quiere matarnos
a nosotros. He wants to kill us."
A week ago Thursday, declaring "open
season against gang violence and juvenile
crime," Wilson passed another resolution
against Carlos. Among Wilson's recom
mendations are one that will allow the
courts to treat 14-year-old violent offend
ers as adults and one that makes those
who engage in gang-related homicide eligi
ble for capital punishment. Junior-high
school-age adults on death row. Wilson
said that we should even try some 13-year
olds as adults.
At the same time, of course, he counsels

us that "we need every ounce of compas
sion we can muster for those kids who are
at risk and who we can save before they
make the wrong choice of gang life." These
"wrong choices" being made are leading to
an increase in violence, Wilson says. I
agree, although I believe we would
describe such "wrong choices" differently.
We need all the compassion we can muster,
Wilson says. I agree, though it smacks of
empty rhetoric. We need to save those chil
dren who have not yet crossed over into
gang life, Wilson says.
I disagree. Even the Lost Boys in Never
Never Land were brought back. Angels
and devils, righteous and damned, inno
cents and criminals. Human beings are
only that two-dimensional when described
by bad journalists and Band-Aid legisla
tors. „
I saw Carlos about a week into the sum
mer after senior year in high school. He
beckoned for me to come over. "Hola," I
greeted him, "tComo estas?"
He didn't smile. "Hablame en ingles,"
he told me, "We in America."
I was surprised. "Do you understand
when I speak in English?"
He didn't respond. He shrugged his
shoulders and looked down in frustration.
Then he looked up, "Y ique quiere una
chica de Los Altos con un pandillero sal
vadoreho 't What does a Los Altos girl want
with an El Salvadoran gang member?" He
stared at me and then, without another
word, got on his bike and rode away.

Carlos didn't alienate himself. He didn't
choose to join a gang to commit some trea
son against humankind. Perhaps he joined
to find the friendship, community, loyalty
that weren't handed to him on a silver
palate. Evil people don't want friends;
lonely people do. Laws that create justice
by extending a clenched fist or an accusato
ry finger are not conducive to handshakes.
Visit a Boys and Girls Club. Visit an on
campus tutoring program, even. The rea
son these programs haven't made a bigger
dent in youth violence is not because they
have a faulty premise. Projects that extend
warmth, trust and responsibility to all
youth, regardless of the blankness of their
slates, make a deep impact. „They stretch
out their hands in respect, but their arms
are too short to reach everyone. They are
consigned to be small-scale and upstart so
long as we allocate the funds they need to
Wilson's checkbook.
In Carlos' eyes, mine was the face of a
system that hated him. That is why he
rode away. There are solutions to the
issues of violence and crime, but they don't
include capital punishment and jail. There
are people to hold accountable, but they
are not 14 years old.

Jocelyn Wiener, a sophomore majoring in
urban studies, hopes Pete Wilson will pro
tect her from the Communists, too.
