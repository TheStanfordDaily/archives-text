# All but one get special fee

The celebratory shouts rang out for nearly an hour
as the returns from the ASSU General Election re
vealed that all but one of the groups requesting funds
won approval.
Thirty special fees, totaling $1,009,465.40, won the
15-percent student approval necessary to receive
funds, the most since 1993-94.
Undergraduate students will pay a record $136 in
ASSU fees during the next school year. Graduates will
pay $70.
Of the 31 fee requests, only the Climbing Wall pro
ject suffered defeat at the hands of voters. Its budget
had been divided into two halves â€” that which had
been approved by the ASSU Senate and that which
had not. The unapproved portion was rejected.
Most jovial among the winners was KZSU General
Manager Sean Kennedy, who climbed a ladder to kiss
Elections Commissioner Ghazal Badiozamani.
"We were really worried that if we lost this year's
fee we wouldn't be broadcasting next year," Kennedy
said. The radio station lost its campaign for funding

last year for the first time in its history. It was forced
to spend a large portion of its reserve to stay afloat.
"Now that we have the $47,000 that we were asking
for, we have enough money to go through the next
year. Its not going to be as much as we've asked for in
the past, but its basically going to leave us on good foot
ing," Kennedy said.
SCBN Station Manager Trevor Gattis also found
reason to celebrate. His television station won its first
special fee ever.
"We had hardly any tapes to record on," Gattis said.
"We can do so much more now."
According to Gattis, SCBN will be able to purchase
more remote cameras, expand its student-run pro
gramming and enhance its general services.
"One big improvement will be in our events crew,
the events that we film for student groups around
campus. They will be of much better quality," Gattis
said.
A large undergraduate turnout boosted returns and
swept many groups to victory. Last year, only 19
groups won. To garner a special fee, a group must re
ceive both a majority and the approval of 15 percent of
the population from which they requested the fee.
