Abe Osheroff, an 82-year-old
social activist and veteran of the
Spanish Civil War, screened his
documentary on fascism in mod
ern Spain, "Dreams and Night
mares," yesterday afternoon in
the Lane History Corner. He
spoke of his involvement in the
war and the potential of students
to affect the course of history.
In 1937, Osheroff joined the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade after
dictator Francisco Franco led the
Spanish military in a revolt
against the democratically elect
ed officials of the Spanish Repub
lic. The brigade was an American
group that combined forces with
several international battalions
to fight this rise of fascism.
Osheroffs documentary tells
the story of the Spanish Civil War
and the American involvement in
fascist Spain. According to his
documentary, Osheroff decided to
fight against fascism because he
"believed that unless fascism was
stopped I in Spain), it would lead to
disaster" throughout the world.
However, as Osheroff ex
plained in a post-screening dis
cussion with the 50-member au

dience, the American government
did not look kindly on American
involvement in the Spanish Civil
War, and fighters in the brigade
were viewed as "a bunch of god
damn Red bastards" because the
U.S. government believed that
those who opposed fascism were
Communists.
"I find it tragic that I, as an
American citizen fighting fas
cism, could not carry an American
machine gun .... That is a blot
on our country's history," Os
heroff said of the U.S. govern
ment's refusal to aid the Spanish
Republican resistance.
In fact, American corporations
like Texaco, DuPont and General
Motors aided the Fascist military
with valuable supplies of gaso
line, weapons and trucks. Under
Franco's repressive regime, at
least 200,000 people were shot by
firing squads and more than
500,000 people were imprisoned
because they were suspected of
opposing the dictatorship. Half of
the prisoners died, and most were
tortured.
Osheroff's larger message,
however, addressed what he
views is a need for students to
"make a meaningful life" for
themselves instead of acting as

passive observers of history.
"Every one of you is in histo
ry," Osheroffsaid. "Itshapesyou,
and if you open your eyes and
you're lucky, you have the chance
to shape it." He also emphasized
the need for all people, especially
students, to live their lives with
passion. "Without passion there's
no human life," he said. "Passion
is the locomotive of history.
"When you have a powerful
feeling, don't deny it," Osheroff
continued. "I could not have
made Imy | film if I had not al
lowed this passion to take over
me."
Osheroff encouraged students
to challenge their government
when it is unjust.
"Where would we be in history
if" nobody had ever broken the
law? We would still be in
caves. . . . We would still have
slavery in America,"he said.
"Whenever you get into a scrape
and you have to choose between
what's right and what the law
says, if you choose to follow the
law, you have lost a part of your
self.
"If you have a strong sense of
your own self worth, it makes you
a very strong person and nobody
can take that away from you."
