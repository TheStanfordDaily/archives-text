## Baseball fights UCLA for first 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
Can you feel it?
Excitement is in the air. The players know it
is big. The coaches know it is big. The fans
know it is big.
How big is it?
"This is the biggest series of the year," said
Stanford senior left fielder Chris Clark.
Though it is still the middle of April, with
the College World Series more than a month
away, the No. 5 Stanford baseball team (28-11,
13-5 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
will be playing the most pivotal series of the
season starting today at 7 p.m. against No. 2
UCLA (32-10-1, 12-6).
Tonight's game will feature two of the coun
try's finest pitchers in UCLA's Jim Parque
(11-0, 2.27 ERA) and Stanford's Kyle Peterson
(6-2, 3.67). The weekend games will begin at 1
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford is sitting on top of the Six-Pac,
leading UCLA by one game. These three games
between the leading two teams in the confer
ence are crucial in determining who will be the
champion. Whoever wins this series will lead
the Six-Pac, with three weekend series remain
ing. But if Stanford takes at least one of three,
it can be no worse than tied for the top spot.
"Every game is automatic ground," said
senior co-captain and first baseman Luke
Quaccia. "Everything is right in our hands."
Led by Gary Adams, UCLA's winningest
coach ever, the Bruins are coming off an
impressive sweep of the Arizona schools. The
Bruins trounced the Wildcats 13-3, 13-6 and
11-3, using a powerful offensive lineup and
solid pitching. The club will be well-rested, as
UCLA has not played since Sunday.
Averaging 10.2 runs per game, UCLA has
clubbed 93 home runs, while allowing only 29,
to throttle its opponents. The Bruins have
homered in 38 of 43 games, drilling nine grand
slams. The NCAA record for most grand slams
in a season is 12, set last year by Oklahoma
State.
First-team Ail-American Troy Glaus leads
UCLA with 21 home runs. The junior short
stop is also batting .416 with 60 RBIs and 69
runs. Junior Peter Zamora, who splits time at
first base and pitcher, is batting a team-leading
.434 with 14 home runs and 53 RBIs. Five of
the Bruins' nine starters have 10 or more
home runs.
Along with its immense offense, UCLA has
an excellent pitching staff. Scheduled to start
against Stanford are Ail-American junior Par
que, sophomore Tom Jacquez (8-1, 2.31 ERA)
