There is no place like home.
This is what the Stanford's men's
tennis team, ranked fifth in the nation,
hopes to prove this weekend in the
final showdown of the regular season
at the grand opening of its new stadi
um.
"Just like basketball, baseball and

football, there is a home-court advan
tage in tennis," said head coach Dick
Gould.
Stanford has many reasons to shine
this weekend when it takes on No. 13
USC today at 1:30 p.m. and top-ranked
UCLA tomorrow at noon in Taube
Family Tennis Stadium. The Card has
not lost a match at home all season and
has lost only once to a Pacific 10 Con
ference team, when the Bruins

squeezed past Stanford April 4 in
Westwood 4-3.
But Stanford could sing a different
tune this weekend on its home turf.
"Our goal is to win both matches,"
said Grant Elliott, the captain and sole
senior on the Cardinal squad. Against
UCLA in early April, Elliott was out of
the lineup.
