# Tennis opens Taube to No.1 UCLA
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
There is no place like home.
This is what the Stanford's men's
tennis team, ranked fifth in the nation,
hopes to prove this weekend in the
final showdown of the regular season
at the grand opening of its new stadi
um.
"Just like basketball, baseball and

football, there is a home-court advan
tage in tennis," said head coach Dick
Gould.
Stanford has many reasons to shine
this weekend when it takes on No. 13
USC today at 1:30 p.m. and top-ranked
UCLA tomorrow at noon in Taube
Family Tennis Stadium. The Card has
not lost a match at home all season and
has lost only once to a Pacific 10 Con
ference team, when the Bruins

squeezed past Stanford April 4 in
Westwood 4-3.
But Stanford could sing a different
tune this weekend on its home turf.
"Our goal is to win both matches,"
said Grant Elliott, the captain and sole
senior on the Cardinal squad. Against
UCLA in early April, Elliott was out of
the lineup.
He will be playing the final
two dual matches of his career
this weekend, but more impor
tantly, his final ones on the
Farm.
"These are definitely big
matches for me, as it will be my
last two matches at home," he
said. "The whole team is ready
for these matches. We are pre
pared for sure, and we have been
building up for these two match
es all season."
Stanford will still be without

the aid of junior All-American
Paul Goldstein, who remains
sidelined with a foot injury.
However, juniors Misha Palecek
and Charles Hoeveler have
stepped into the lineup and per
formed impressively. Earlier in
the season against the Bruins,
Hoeveler and Palecek knockcd
off UCLA at the No. 3 doubles
position.
While Stanford hopes to take
both matches against the Bruins
and Trojans, it will regardless
attend the NCAA Champi
onships beginning May 17, host
ed by UCLA. However, the out
come of the matches this week
end could greatly improve the

Card's seeding in the tourna
ment.
"Ideally, we would like to be
on the opposite side of the draw
than UCLA," Gould said. "The
later that we play them in the
tournament, the better, espe
cially since the matches are on
their home couH."
After the weekend's grand
opening, Taube Family Tennis
Stadium will host the women's
NCAA Championships next
month as a state-of-the-art, $5.8
million facility.
"The new seats will be open,"
Gould said. "Everyone can come
out and watch some great tennis
in the sun."
