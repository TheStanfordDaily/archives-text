# Graduate draw has improved options
##

In response to concerns ex
pressed by graduate students about
on-campus housing assignment
procedures, Housing and Dining
Services will implement two new
policies in this year's graduate
housing lottery.
The first is a returning resident
priority, which will allow single
graduate students living in on-cam
pus housing during spring quarter
to obtain priority for being reas
signed to housing of the same resi
dence for the fall. Second, a new
housing contract will allow gradu
ate students to remain in their resi
dences for a full calendar year as op
posed to an academic one. Current
housing procedures require them to
reapply for summer housing.
Graduate students often stay on
campus through the summer to
continue research. In the past, some
have had to move at the end of a
school year to summer housing and
then move again in the fall to their
assigned housing for the next acad
emic year.
"These changes are things that
have been asked for quite some
time," said Kathleen Bransfield,
acting manager of housing assign
ment services. "These changes are
definitely in response to students'
requests."
Housing and Dining Services
was unable to create these new pro
cedures until this year due to a lack
of adequate graduate student hous

ing and inequality between the var
ious housing options available to
students.
In past years, there have been
300 to 500 graduate students who
were unable to receive on-campus
housing when they requested it.
But this year's housing lottery will
offer two new housing options: the
Lyman Graduate Residences and
the Schwab Residential Center.
These new complexes will house
more than 400 students.
Renovations on Escondido Vil
lage are also close to being complet
ed. Thus, there is now more equali
ty of facilities between the various
graduate housing options.
Without the new housing op
tions and the equality of existing
housing, Housing and Dining Ser
vices could not consider policy
changes like returning resident pri
ority because it would have been un
fair to students who have never had
University housing. The presence of
returning residents would have de
creased their chances of getting a fu
ture assignment.
"We have reached a point where
returning resident priority makes
sense now," said Rodger Whitney,
associated director of Housing and
Dining Services.
The two policies were recom
mended by the Graduate Housing
Issues Protocol and Policies Com
mittee, which is comprised of ad
ministrative staff from both Hous
ing and Dining Services and the
graduate student residence offices.
The Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee, a body made up of
ASSU-appointed graduate stu
dents, reviewed the policies commit
tee's recommendations and provid
ed their input to improve the pro
posed policy changes.
Materials science and mechani
cal engineering graduate student
Brian Holloway, an advisory com
mittee member, explained that the

policy changes will allow students to
say, "If I like where I'm at, I'll be
able to stay here and add continuity
to my life."
Holloway cited a lack of continu
ity in housing as a major complaint
among graduate students. "I think
that both changes are positive," he
said.
According to Bransfield, many of
the students who have already sub
mitted their lottery forms for next
year have opted to use the returning
resident priority.
The priority applies only to single
graduate students and couples
without children because students

with children are guaranteed hous
ing during their stay at Stanford.
In addition, the new housing
contract will allow students to stay
in their residences September
through August, unless a termina
tion of occupancy is filed during
spring quarter.
"I think these are exciting
changes," Whitney said. "I'm very
glad that we've been able to imple
ment both changes. I think they will
improve the housing environment
for graduate students and allow for
continuity. The new yearly contract
will also make the process less cum
bersome and complicated."
