# Lacrosse falls to Cal 13-9, enters playoffs
## 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's
lacrosse team (6-7) was out
matched by California last
Saturday, losing 13-9. The
squad was defeated not
because it was an inferior
team, but because there were
several instances when the all
around team confidence was
lowered.
The team started off
strong, scoring several goals
against the Golden Bears'
tough defense. However, the
Cardinal's confidence deterio
rated when its opponents
bounced right back with a
series of aggressive offensive
plays, and as a result, Stan
ford lagged behind for the rest
of the game.
The Cardinal's solid
defense was led by master
strategists Guillermo Garcia
and John West, both senior
captains.

"We had problems with our
one-on-one defense and low
success in shooting," West
said.
As a senior, West has had
much experience fending off
an aggressive offense and
demonstrated his skills Satur
day. Garcia, known for his
deft stick maneuvers, cited
"communication problems"
with the team as a possible
source of downfall.
Halfway through the
match, starting midfielder and
fellow senior captain Ali Dis
ston was put out of commis
sion by a foot injury. Fortu
nately, he will be available to
play tomorrow.
This event threw the Cardi
nal off slightly; however, this
was turned around slightly by
star attack, junior Ronald
Rhea, whose coordination and
aggressive offense earned him
five goals.
Stanford, a member of
Northern Division 1 of the West
ern Collegiate Lacrosse League,
is now seeded fourth and headed
to the playoffs. It will confront
Sonoma State tomorrow at 1
p.m. in a predictably tough road
match. The Cossacks (7-2) are
seeded second in the same divi
sion and are renowned for their
potent offense. This represents a
significant battle for Stanford. If
the team succeeds, it could qual
ify for the Final Four in San
Diego at the end of the month.
The victor of the first match will
challenge the winner of the heat
ed Santa Clara / UC-Santa Bar
bara contest.
For the playoffs, head coach
Peter Bijesse wants the team to
be unified mentally and decide
what kind of game they want to
play.
"The team will succeed espe
cially if the offense clicks and
plays as a unit," said junior mid
fielder Ryan Page. "We just
have to improve our ball control
and transition game."
The Cardinal was originally
scheduled to have a rematch
against UC-Davis, but the
Aggies ended their season pre
maturely due to misconduct on
a road trip to Utah.
