# Gymnastics' season ends
## Men fall at NCAAs 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
lOWA CITY, lowa — Sometimes
things just don't fall into place. No matter
how hard you try.
The Stanford men's gymnastics team,

whose hard work and heart brought the
squad all the way to the NCAA Champi
onships, placed sixth in yesterday's pre
liminaries at Carver-Hawkeye Arena and
failed to advance to the NCAA finals.
The results went as follows: California
232.50, Oklahoma 231.55, lowa 231.325,
Ohio 231.275, Penn 228.975 and Stan
ford 228.65.
This marks the first time in six years
that the team hasn't made the final
round, in a season plagued with injuries
and cursed with inconsistent perfor
mances.
The Cardinal turned in one of its
strongest performances of the year, post
ing a score of 228.65, but still fell short of
outdoing itself. The performances wore
good, not great. And the final outcome
was all too disappointing.
Stanford may still get a shot at win
ning some championships, though, as
both senior Keith Wiley and sophomore
Scott Finkelstein qualified for event
finals on the pommel horse to be held
tomorrow night.
This team gave it their all. The men
practiced nonstop for weeks, they ignored
persistent injuries to do their part and
they never gave up even to the very end.
Things just didn't fall into place.
From the very start, the team did well,
but not outstanding. On
the first event of the night, head coach
Sadao I lamada made a strategic move,
opting to substitute freshman Craig Nes
bitt for redshirt freshman David Ludlow.
Both Ludlow and Finklestein missed
their routines at regionals, but Hamada's
moved was made for the sake of
consistency. Nesbitt's routine was
not as complex, but more consis
tent. The team posted a total of
38.57 on the high bar, which put
Stanford in second place after the
first rotation.
Unfortunately, the first round
was the last point in which the
team stood a chance of making it
into the top three. On the floor
exercise, an uncharacteristic miss
by freshman Jason Katsampes put
the Cardinal in jeopardy with no
exceptional scores by other team
members to balance the effort.
Then, Finkelstein scored 9.65 and
Wiley followed, also with a 9.65.
The final routine was a 9.45 per
formance by senior Jamie Ellis,
bringing the team total to 38.12.
The Card then moved to fourth
place going into the third rotation.
The third event for the night for
the Cardinal was supposed to be its
strongest, the pommel horse. The
team tallied two of its highest
scores all night — Finkelstein with
9.725 and Wiley with 9.75. Despite
these scores, the rest of the squad
could not come up with sufficiently
high scores to give Stanford a boost
in the rankings. The team total of
38.42 dropped the Card to fifth,
ahead of only Penn State.
The team continued to lose
ground throughout the fourth
rotation, rings, which is by far the
weakest event for the Cardinal.
The gymnasts had expected to lose
ground, but low scores and lacklus
ter performances put a damper on
the m<x>d of the Stanford sqaud.
And then they were sixth. Trail
ing Cal by over two points, Stan

ford had one last hope — a stellar
showing on the vault. Hamada
later admitted that he instructed
his gymnasts to shift from a con
servative attitude to an aggressive
one. Bachrach risked further irri
tating his knee and went up on the
vault, but his performance was not
good enough to land him a place in
the top seven for spot in the indi
vidual event finals.
As was the case all night, things
didn't fall into place. The team did
well in the vault, but no gymnast
solidly landed nor did anyone post
a score upwards of 9.7.
The team moved up slightly to
fifth place only to fall to Penn State
in the last event, the parallel bars.
The last three events were sloppy,
especially vaulting and parallel
bars
"I told the guys, 'You cannot be
conservative any more,' " Hamada
said.
Hamada was the man with the
master plan. Hut this time it fell
through. Or, as Hamada asserts, it
was not properly executed.
"My plan was to hit everything
about 95 percent," Hamada said.
"If everybody came up with about
95 percent, we would have scored
231-232 — just enough to get us
in,"he said. The Stanford team
performed at about 85 percent,
according to his estimate, which
was simply not good enough.
The wisdom in Hamada's ways
is evidenced by the statement made
by Cal head coach Harry Weiner
after the competition.
"Actually, if anything I've mod
eled my team after the Stanford
team," he said. "I really admire
coach Hamada."
Of the three teams in the finals,
Cal is considered the favorite.
However, lowa will benefit from
the home-arena advantage again.
