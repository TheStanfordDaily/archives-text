# Women eliminated
## 
### 
The season ended for Stanford
women's gymnastics last night in
Gainesville, Fla., when its two repre
sentatives at NCAA Championships,
freshman Larissa Fontaine and
sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick, failed
to advance to individual event finals.
However, Fontaine was named a sec
ond-team All-American in three
events.
Fontaine finished 14th of 23 gym
nasts in all-around competition due
to her struggles 011 the beam, in
which she placed 40th out of 43 com
petitors with 0,275. But she finished
tied for 10th in vault with a 9.875
and tied for seventh on parallel bars
(9.875) and floor exercise (9.8).
Fitzpatrick did not fare as well.
Her 37.925 placed 23rd as she was
doomed by poor showings on vault
(9.25, 42nd place) and floor
(9.225, 39th place). However, Fitz
patrick finished in the middle of
the pack on bars (9.75, tied for
24th) and 9.7 on beam (9.7, 29th).
