# Spikers take on Waves

### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Tomorrow night at 7 p.m., in what fig
ures to be one of the most exciting matches
Burnham Pavilion has seen, the Stanford
men's volleyball team begins its "second
season" when play in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament commences.
The Cardinal, ranked third nationally and
seeded second in the tournament behind
top-ranked UCLA, will play Pepperdine,
ranked fifth nationally and seeded seventh
in the tournament due to its fourth-place
finish in the loaded Mountain Division.
The match appears to feature two teams
that are very even. Although Stanford (22-
lfi-.'i MPSF) won the teams' only meeting
this year March 27 at Pepperdine, it was a
close match. In the match, which Stanford
won 9-15, 15-8, 15-13, 15-7, the Cardinal's
two senior outside hitters, Matt Fuer
bringer and Mike Lambert, both had out
standing matches. The combined efforts of
the two likely All-Americans and first-team

all-MPSF selections propelled the Cardinal
to the win. It will take an equally strong
effort on Stanford's part if it is to gain
another victory over the Waves (18-8, 13-6
MPSF).
"In the last match against Pepperdine,
Lambert and Fuerbringer had the best
match they have had as a pair all season,"
said head coach Huben Nieves. "Time after
time when wo had to kick the ball outside,
they came up with kills. Also, when we dug
the ball, they were great in transition and
capitalized on opportunities for points.
"We'll definitely have to have some of
that on Saturday."
Pepperdine will look to counter Stan
ford's outside combination with an oppos
ing set of outside players of its own. ()utside
hitters George Roumain, a sophomore, and
Kevin Harnett, a senior, are Pepperdine's
stars. Roumain, a first-team all-MPSF
selection, is third in the conference in kills
per game at (>.75). Harnett's jump serve has
placed him second in service-ace average at
