# Spikers take on Waves
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Tomorrow night at 7 p.m., in what fig
ures to be one of the most exciting matches
Burnham Pavilion has seen, the Stanford
men's volleyball team begins its "second
season" when play in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament commences.
The Cardinal, ranked third nationally and
seeded second in the tournament behind
top-ranked UCLA, will play Pepperdine,
ranked fifth nationally and seeded seventh
in the tournament due to its fourth-place
finish in the loaded Mountain Division.
The match appears to feature two teams
that are very even. Although Stanford (22-
lfi-.'i MPSF) won the teams' only meeting
this year March 27 at Pepperdine, it was a
close match. In the match, which Stanford
won 9-15, 15-8, 15-13, 15-7, the Cardinal's
two senior outside hitters, Matt Fuer
bringer and Mike Lambert, both had out
standing matches. The combined efforts of
the two likely All-Americans and first-team

all-MPSF selections propelled the Cardinal
to the win. It will take an equally strong
effort on Stanford's part if it is to gain
another victory over the Waves (18-8, 13-6
MPSF).
"In the last match against Pepperdine,
Lambert and Fuerbringer had the best
match they have had as a pair all season,"
said head coach Huben Nieves. "Time after
time when wo had to kick the ball outside,
they came up with kills. Also, when we dug
the ball, they were great in transition and
capitalized on opportunities for points.
"We'll definitely have to have some of
that on Saturday."
Pepperdine will look to counter Stan
ford's outside combination with an oppos
ing set of outside players of its own. ()utside
hitters George Roumain, a sophomore, and
Kevin Harnett, a senior, are Pepperdine's
stars. Roumain, a first-team all-MPSF
selection, is third in the conference in kills
per game at (>.75). Harnett's jump serve has
placed him second in service-ace average at
.629 per game and helped land him
on the league's second team. The
offensive power of these two has
lifted Pepperdine's team hitting
percentage to .347, second in the
conference behind Stanford's .378.
"Pepperdine has two of the
league's top hitters," Nieves said.
"Roumain and Barnett match up
against anyone. They hit well
against us last time, but like Greg
Wakeham (a senior outside hitter
from Pacific, whom Stanford faced
Tuesday) we were able to stop
them just enough to get the win."
Indeed, if Stanford is going to
win, it will have to rely on players
other than Fuerbringer and Lam
bert. While this may be a limitation
to some teams, Stanford should
not have trouble finding another
star to rise to the occasion.
All of Stanford's starting six
players received all-league recogni
tion (no other team had more than
four). However, of the four players
left after Lambert and Fuer
bringer, look for middle blockers
Keenan Whitehurst, a junior third
teamer and the conference's leader
in hitting percentage at .463, and
senior honorable mention recipient
Mike Hoefer, the No. 4 hitter in the
conference at .424, and the fifth
best blocker at 1.79 per game, to
step forward.

"I think that we have the advan
tage in the middle," Nieves said.
"We certainly have an edge offen
sively. The blocking should be pret
ty even. Also, I think that we have
a slight advantage at setter; (sec
ond-team all-MPSF senior) Stew
art (Chong) is more experienced
and consistent. I feel so good about
Stewart this year that I feel, at the
very least, that setter is a wash
regardless of whom we play."
However, while Stanford may
have the edge on paper, it will
have to have a very strong match
against Pepperdine if it is to
extend its win streak at home to
13 straight and avoid losing in the
first round like it did last year
against UC-Santa Barbara. The
Card's 12-match winning streak,
combined with Pepperdine com
ing off two five-game losses at
Brigham Young should also favor
Stanford.
However, the element that will
be most in Stanford's favor is the
home crowd. While students will
have to pay a league-mandated $1
fee to gain admission to the match,
a large turnout is expected.
"I expect that we will have the
biggest crowd of the year," Nieves
said. "Although we have the pres
sure of knowing that our season
will be over if we lose, I feel that
same way about this match that I
do any time we play anyone: If they
play their best and we play our
best, we will win. There shouldn't
be any surprises."
