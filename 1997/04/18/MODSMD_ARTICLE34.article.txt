# Riding 11-match streak, tennis takes on No.3 UCLA, USC
## No.2 women look for third conference sweep 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
In its last weekend of the
dual-match season, the No. 2
Cardinal women's tennis team
has some spring cleaning to do.
With wins at No. 3 UCLA
today and USC tomorrow, Stan
ford can sweep the Pacific 10
Conference for the third straight
season. The Cardinal will also be
looking to extend its overall win
streak to 13 and its conference
win streak to 34. And adding to
the list, the Cardinal has already
clinched at least a tie for the Pac
-10 title, its 10th straight crown.
Thus, although the Cardinal
(24-1, 8-0 Pac-10 South) defeat
ed UCLA 6-3 and USC 7-2 at
home just two weeks ago, the
team shouldn't have a problem
getting up for these matches.
Against the third-ranked Bru
ins (14-4, 6-2) two weeks ago, the
Cardinal took four of the six sin
gles matches, all in straight sets.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh, living
up to all of her expectations, led
the way with a 6-2, 7-6 win in the
No. 1 spot against UCLA sopho
