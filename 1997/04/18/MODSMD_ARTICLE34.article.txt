# Riding 11-match streak, tennis takes on No.3 UCLA, USC
## No.2 women look for third conference sweep 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
In its last weekend of the
dual-match season, the No. 2
Cardinal women's tennis team
has some spring cleaning to do.
With wins at No. 3 UCLA
today and USC tomorrow, Stan
ford can sweep the Pacific 10
Conference for the third straight
season. The Cardinal will also be
looking to extend its overall win
streak to 13 and its conference
win streak to 34. And adding to
the list, the Cardinal has already
clinched at least a tie for the Pac
-10 title, its 10th straight crown.
Thus, although the Cardinal
(24-1, 8-0 Pac-10 South) defeat
ed UCLA 6-3 and USC 7-2 at
home just two weeks ago, the
team shouldn't have a problem
getting up for these matches.
Against the third-ranked Bru
ins (14-4, 6-2) two weeks ago, the
Cardinal took four of the six sin
gles matches, all in straight sets.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh, living
up to all of her expectations, led
the way with a 6-2, 7-6 win in the
No. 1 spot against UCLA sopho

action.
more Katie Kocsis, the No. 9 sin
gles player in the nation. Oster
loh, who also upset No. 3 Vicky
Maes last week against Arizona,
is now 6-0 since being moved to
the No. 1 spot in the lineup.
In doubles, UCLA pulled off a
win in an upset victory against
Stanford juniors Ania Bleszyns
ki and Julie Scott, the top
ranked team in the nation.
Absent from the lineup
against the liruins was Stanford
freshman Anne Kremer, who

won two matches in straight sets
last weekend against Arizona
and Arizona State.
Despite a dismal conference
record, the Women of Troy (8-
13, 0-8) proved to be worthy
opponents the following after
noon for the Cardinal. Trojans
Ditta Huber and Pam Trump
extended their Stanford oppo
nents into three-set matches in
the No. 1 and No. 6 matches,
respectively.
In doubles, USC's Jacqui
Hoyd and Karolina Baklarova
escaped with a victory at the No.
3 position where Kreiner was
missing, while Bleszynski and
Scott eluded another scare by

winning in a 9-8 tie-broaker.
The two matches this week
end represent the final regular
season action for the Cardinal
women, who can secure a No. 2
seed in NCAA Championships
with two victories. Only No. 1
Florida, the only team to beat
Stanford back in February, will
be seeded ahead of the Cardinal
come tourney time.
After the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Ojai next week, the
Cardinal will have three weeks
off while the rest of the nation
fights for a berth in t.lu? NCAA
Championships, to be held May
15-23 at Stanford's Tan be Fami
ly Tennis Stadium.
