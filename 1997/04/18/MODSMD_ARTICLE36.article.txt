# Mt. SAC meet on deck for runners
## 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team will be spending the weekend
in sunny Southern California,
competing against some of the
best athletes in the world.
The Mt. SAC relays are touted
as the "world's largest track and
field event" by organizers. Mt.
SAC stands for Mt. San Antonio
College, which is in Walnut. More
than 300 schools will be represent
ed at the event. The meet will also
feature some noncollegiate ath
letes in open divisions, perhaps
most notably Carl Lewis, who
runs with a club in Santa Monica.
"This is by far our biggest invite
all year," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "We will see excellent
competition, especially in the mid
dle distances."
The Cardinal will send 42 ath
letes to Mt. SAC. Represented will
be schools such as UCLA, known
for its strong throwers, Arkansas
and Colorado, known for middle
distance power, and USC, noted
for strength in sprinting. Such top
programs will be good for the Car
dinal to compare to. However, the
meet is not scored, so individual
performance is Stanford's focus.

Key events today for Stanford
include the women's 3,000 meters,
which will feature senior Amanda
White and junior Monal Chokshi.
Tomorrow night will feature
the 5,000 meter runs. Running for
the men will be juniors J.J. White
and John Weldon and sophomores
Brad and Brent Hauser. Juniors
Sarna Renfro and Kortney Dun
scomhe and sophomore Mary
Cobb will represent the women.
Also taking place tomorrow will be
the throwing events.
The weekend culminates in a
huge invitational Sunday, show
casing the best athletes in the
nation in their respective fields.
Junior Justin Strand, whose latest
hammer toss of 233 feet, 5 inches
is tops in the nation, is one of the
Cardinal notables.
The Card will also be represent
ed by four multi-event athletes at
the Azusa Pacific Decathlon / Hep
tathlon competition which began
yesterday and will finish tonight.
On hand for Stanford are junior
Katrinka Jackson, sophomore
Tracye Lawyer and freshmen Jes
sica Tinker and Joy Goff. The
women should see excellent com
petition. This also is a last oppor
tunity to meet Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championship standards.
