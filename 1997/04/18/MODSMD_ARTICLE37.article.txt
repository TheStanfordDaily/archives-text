# Crew out for revenge
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
After two long weekends on the road, the
Cardinal oars are coming home tomorrow to
Redwood Shores to face Oregon State.
The Stanford varsity men anxiously wait
to settle the score with the Beavers, since
the Pacific 10 Conference rivals from Cor
vallis have been victorious the past two
encounters with the Cardinal crew.
"We really want a victory vs. OSU this
weekend," said Oregon native and senior
varsity captain Mark Thomas. "They've
really nipped us the last two years."
Although Stanford is prepared to face
Oregon State, Thomas recognizes that the
Beavers will not be an easy group to beat.
"I believe that they are technically the
best crew in the West Coast," Thomas said.
Beaver head coach David lieischman also
does not underestimate the Cardinal's
potential for this weekend's race.
"Stanford has always been a competitive
race for us," he said. "They are certainly one
of the faster crews on our schedule and on
the coast.
"We always consider ourselves fortunate
to be racing them, and we cannot afford to
overlook this crew."
On the men's novice race, Stanford coach
Josh Burgel has faith that his squad can
walk away victorious from the young
Beaver oarsmen this weekend.
"I am pretty confident we can win, and 1
like to do it with style and good technique,"
Burgel said. "And come away with a con
vincing win that shows who is in control."
Freshman Michael Antonsen agrees with
Burgel's assessment of tomorrow's regatta.

"I think we will do well this weekend
since we have been working a lot on tech
nique," he said. "We know that we have
some of the power required to move past
Oregon State this weekend, but we also
need more finesse as we improve towards
the championships."
Like Thomas, women's head coach
Aimee Baker also foresees the varsity
women's race to be a challenging one. And
like last weekend against the Cougars,
Baker believes that this will be another test
to prove that her squad would have been in
the grand finals of the San Diego Crew Clas
sic had it been in a more favorable heat.
"OSU will be a huge race for us," Baker
said. "OSU qualified for the varsity grand
finals in Sim Diego and we did not, so it
would be nice for us to beat them because I
think we can.
"It will be tough since we are pretty even.
It will be a close race."
Women's novice coach Kristine Franson
believes that not only will this weekend's
showdown be a close one, but that the next
few races as well will be extremely challeng
ing for her crew.
"I think they have to go out and have the
same kind of attitude going into the race as
they did last weekend," Franson said. "I
think any of these Pac-10 schools are pretty
equal in speed, which has made Pac-10 rac
ing step up a notch."
Both Stanford varsity squads are enter
ing this weekend's contest with a perfect
record of 5-0 in Pac-10 dual meets. Tradi
tionally, both Stanford and Oregon State
have had close races, which will make
tomorrow's performances anything but
lacking in excitement.
