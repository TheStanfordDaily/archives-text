# Ultimate tunes up at invite
## Men, women prepare against tough club squads 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Last weekend, both the men
and women's Ultimate Frisbee
teams traveled to UC-Davis to
compete in the Davis Ultimate
Invitational.
The men did fairly well Satur
day, splitting four games to com
pile a 2-2 record. The next day,
they lost in the quarterfinals to
101st Airborne, an Oakland club
team.
The women's team played well,
said captain Abby Hoover. Super
fly, the women's A team, won its
pool, beating the first- and second
seeded teams. It played in the semi
finals Sunday and lost to another
Bay Area club team, Home
brewed.
The two-duy tournament was
the last in a series of club tourna
ments before postseason play

begins.
Captain Jim Schoettler antici
pates that the first of these colle
giate tournaments will be "pretty
easy," and "things will come easier
playing against college teams"
than club teams. Ija Familia, the
men's A team, has a 19-1 record
against college teams and a 4-8
record against noncollegiate teams.
Schoettler believes that these
club tournaments are good prepa
ration for the upcoming collegiate
tournaments.
"They provide a level of play
that we need to be challenged,"
Schoettler said.
Sunday's sectionals will be held
in Pleasanton. The teams expect
the fields to be quite nice there,
possibly because there are a lot of
cows in the area.
The women's team has no rea
son to be nervous about sectionals.
It is a small section so all the

squads playing in it will qualify for
regionals. This tournament will
only determine bow each team will
be seeded in the regional to
ment that will be held May 3-4 at
Stanford and Santa Cruz.
The other teams that will be
playing Sunday are California, UC-
Santa Cruz, UC-Davis, Las Positas
and Sonoma State.
In order to get into top shape for
the postseason tournaments, the
women's team has begun morning
practices in addition to condition
ing and afternoon practices. The
sacrifice on the part of the team
seems to have paid off. Their suc
cess in the recent tournament at
Davis shows that they have a veiy
strong team.
"We're really excited about bow
we're playing," I loover said.
"We're confident we'll qualify for
regionals and do well at nationals if
we try our best."
