Q: So do you think it's true about the new ASSU president?


"Yeah, and I saw the
photos to prove it!"

"Absolutely. I've seen
the president on the
Afro-trucking circuit
dressed as a Mongol."


"Personally, we have our
doubts that anyone could be
that limber."


"Ungarr!!!!"


"I hate to jump to
conclusions, but the
hoof prints were
pretty incriminating."
