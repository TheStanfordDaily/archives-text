## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
By the slimmest of margins, ju
nior Emily Andrus was elected as
ASSU president last night. She and
her running mate, junior Ren
Decker, won 50.1 percent of the
vote.
The announcement came at 3
a.m. after paper ballots had been
counted. Andrus and Decker re
ceived just enough votes to avert
the mandated run off election (hat
would have occurred had no ticket
received 50 percent of the vote.
"I'm overwhelmed by the sup
port we had, and I am pleased and
inspired by the election turnout,"
said Andrus. Turnout among un
dergraduates was more than 10
percent above last year; it was
slightly higher than last year
among graduate students.
Andrus noted that among her
first, tasks "will be gathering the
new senators together and talking
with (ASSU President) Bill (Shen)
and (ASSU Vice President) Nick
(Thompson) about the ins and outs
of the office."
"We also hope to revamp the
funding system in time for the
fall," Andrus added.
Andrus and Decker both em
phasized their respect for their fel
low candidates and their pleasure

with the tone of the campaign.
"There has been a tremendous
election turnout and the election it
self was a more substantive one
than there has been in while, "
Decker said.
"I really respect (presidential
candidates) 1 loward (Loo) and Jim
(Finsten), and I was pleased that
the campaign was veiy profession
al and issue oriented." added An
drus.
Noting the other candidates
contributions to the campaign and
to Stanford as a whole, Decker con
tinued, "We would like to work
with Howard and (his vice presi
dential running mate) Solomon
(Lefler) on their "45-Day Plan,"
and we hope that Jim will help us to
gain representation on the Board
of Trustees and that (Finsten's
running mate) Kelly (Naylor) will
continue her many student orient
ed endeavors including the public
service minor."
Finsten and Naylor received
27.8 percent of the student vote,
and Loo and Lefler received 19.1
percent.
"We feel we ran a solid cam
paign, and we feel really proud of
what we've accomplished and the
fact that we ran our campaign on
issues important to students," said
Finsten.
The other major story of the
evening was in the Senate as all five
Stop Monopolies on Campus candi
dates or SMOC-affiliated candi
dates were elected to undergradu
ate senate seats.
"It is a sweep," said SMOC orga
nizer Danny Bramzon, a junior. "It
shows that there is a mandate for
change."
SMOC senator-elect Tim Beard,
a freshman, echoed this notion.
"When we see such egregious price
gouging at the Bookstore, we need

to take a stand, and tonight stu
dents proved that they stand with
us."
Bramzon noted that the success
of the SMOC slate was due to the
fact "that we demonstrated that we
are going to do things for students."
Freshman Matt Spence, a
SMOC affiliated candidate, re
ceived the most votes.
Crediting his success to the hard
work of friends and a campaign
based on ideas, Spence said he
hopes to "improve student services
and create a true student union.
"This will be a senate that will
leave a legacy," said Spence adding
that it is ultimately not about him
"but what we can do as a Senate."

Current undergraduate sena
tors Maren Norton and Jesus Gon
zalez, both sophomores, were re
elected.
Andrus and Decker expressed
their eagerness to work with the
Senate, in particular with the
SMOC senators.
"A tremendous senate has been
elected, and the students are really
interested in changing the cam
pus," said Decker, who in the posi
tion of the vice president has the op
tion of presiding over the senate.
Decker added that the ASSU ex
ecutive and the SMOC senators
would work well together "as im
proving student services is also a
major SMOC issue."
