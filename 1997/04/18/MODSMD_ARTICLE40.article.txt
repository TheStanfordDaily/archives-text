Old T.S. got it wrong: April's not the cruelest month.
It's the coolest. After the dreary winter months, even
Stanford administrators want to show their more fabulous
sides. Here, four prominent University figures model the

latest in Stanford fashion.

'Nothing relaxes us like a little group yoga in
the afternoon. And we've found you can really
stretch and concentrate in linen slacks (Oscar
de la Renta, $520) and cashmere turtlenecks
(Moschino Boutique, $466). Say pooh-pooh to
stiff suits and ties — let's blow the endow
ment on Fifth Avenue!'

'When I wear 'The Napkin'
(Calvin Klein, $1,200), I'm
ready for anything from a
sophomore seminar to a
summit with Boris Yeltsin.

It's versatile, it's under
stated and, best of all,
when I'm eating one of

. those messy burritos from
I Polio's, all I need to do to

■keep clean is dab my

■mouth with the hem of my

■dress.'



'Wheeeeeee! Retiring from my position as vice provost makes me feel as
giddy as a schoolgirl. These days, I just throw on a silk pantsuit (Dolce and
uabbana, $800) and a pair of boots (Manolo Blahnik, $2/5), and I'm out the
door. Forget that take-lonqer-and-do-it-right philosophy I'm always espous
ing; my new motto is quick, quick, quick!'
