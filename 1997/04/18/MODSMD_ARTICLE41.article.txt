SECRET DIARIES
OF AIMEE
THANATOGENOS,
BUT YOU SHOULD
READ IT ANYWAY.

This lias boon a very hard week for
Aimee Thanatogenos. Pity me. Sun
day, 1 had to attend a funeral â€” a
friend of mine who died from inhaling
too much helium while blowing up a balloon
at his clown-training retreat. He blew himself
to death, the poor dear. At the graveyard cer
emony, I had a few shots of tequila to calm
down, but when it came time for me to deliv
er the eulogy, I got confused and performed a
can-can routine instead. Afterward. I acciden
tally fell on his grave and everybody started
clapping, thinking it was all part of some per
formance-art act.
The next day. I showed up a wee bit intoxicat
ed to my RA interview, and before I knew what I
was doing, I found myself sitting on Ann l'orteus
lap. telling her about a botched liposuction I had.
When she asked me which house I wanted to work
in, I said. "No, I don't want to work tlicm: I want
them to work me." So that went beautifully. 1 have
five more interviews to go. which means five more
chances to redeem myself with Res Kd.
Finally, on Wednesday, I had a little tete-a-tete
with my boss. Kli/abeth (loldman. who told me to
stop bringing my raccoon to work or else I'd be
fired. Next thing you know she'll be forcing me to
take a drug test. Man. it takes more than good
grammar to hold on to this job. my dears. It takes
class, diplomacy and the ability to hide one's track
marks.
Rut the worst thing of all actually happened
Thursday, during the live airing of my television
show. "Thanatos. The show's named after me. of

course, and the premise is that every week 1 per
form a different act of violence on a passerby in
White Plaza. I was about to grab this tour-guide
chick by the hair and throw her to the ground when
one of those pesky SMOC people, trying to prevent
me from having a monopoly on violence on campus,
tied me to the Claw and slapped me silly.
Alter all these terrible things happened. I
found I had no choice but seek the help of my friend
Mryce (VShaughnessy. who works as a research
assistant in a chem lab. They're trying to find a
cure for blandness. Thank goodness he gave me
some under the counter action, if you know what I
mean.
And so. happily sedated and properly put out of
mischief. I hibernated the rest of the week, only
getting up once to take another Valium but never
pausing to consider the folly of tm ways. For that,
there's alwavs next week.


Aimee on a bad hair
day.
