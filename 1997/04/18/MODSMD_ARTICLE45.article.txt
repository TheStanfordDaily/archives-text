# Students forming committee to work on teaching reform
##

A group of about 30 students is currently in the
process of forming a University committee on teaching
reform made up of faculty, administrators and students.
To that end, the group, which is being initiated by
ASSU members and other interested students, held a
public meeting last night with former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who has worked at Stanford for
37 years, to get his historical and professional insight
into the possible revision of teaching practices.
Kennedy, a biology professor, touched on a variety of
related issues concerning teaching reform, including
historical trends in college instruction and past efforts
made by Stanford to improve its quality of education.
Kennedy opened the later part of the meeting to ques
tions and discussion in order to offer possible solutions
and reasoning for any teaching with which students
may be dissatisfied.
Mentioning that the topic of teaching reform is one
that has been repeatedly raised and debated over the
years, Kennedy said he thought "one of the most impor
tant things I can do is to provide some historical con
text."
According to Kennedy, the University is now "cer
tainly in an era of change.
"There is more talk now than I can ever remember
about how teaching should be, how to evaluate it and
what role it should play in an institution," Kennedy said.
This collective concern — together with the advent of
new technology that provides better communication
services between students and instructors, such as e
mail — has the potential to create a better educational
environment, he added.
Kennedy explained that the movement to improve
teaching has made "notch-by-notch progress" since the
19605, when the idea of having students evaluate facul
ty was still considered "radical" by some instructors.
However, he acknowledged that there are members in
the Stanford faculty still "quite absent" in efforts to bet
ter their teaching skills. He commented that some fac
ulty members simply did not seize opportunities to im-

prove their teaching skills.
Kennedy said that creating a culture in the academ
ic community that rewards more serious attention to
teaching is necessary to produce any permanent
change.
"To be available, to take their concerns seriously and
to answer hard questions responsibly — these are just as
well a part of good teaching as lecturing is," Kennedy
said. He also stressed the importance of "basing lectures
on inquiry, not just delivering answers."
Commenting that "there is a lot of power in personal
persuasion," Kennedy advised a student in the audience
who complained about one of his current instructors to
"initiate polite objection followed by a line of complaints
to the department" if there was a teaching problem.
"You can make a lot of big change if you work at it,"
Kennedy said.
To support his point, Kennedy provided the audience
with an anecdote involving the Chemical Engineering
Department.
According to Kennedy, the faculty of the Chemical
Engineering Department got together 15 years ago after
having been "dumped to the bottom of the pie" in the
School of Engineering as the result of negative student
evaluations.
The entire faculty "went over to the Center for
Teaching and Learning and availed themselves to their
services," Kennedy said. "The next year, they rose well
above the median."
According to junior Monica Klement, who organized
the gathering, the unofficial group hopes to "move the
University" forward in teaching reform.
"It's definitely not an anti-faculty or anti-adminis
tration" group, said Klement. "There's infinite room for
improvement [in the quality of teaching], and we realize
that there are people like Don Kennedy [in the faculty
and administration] who also want to bring the Univer
sity together."
Klement also added that the group has already begun
talking with interested members of the faculty and ad
ministration, including Education Prof. Lee Shulman
and Hoover Institute senior research fellow Larry Jay
Diamond.
