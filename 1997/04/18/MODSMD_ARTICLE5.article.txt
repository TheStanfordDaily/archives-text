# Judicial charter passes by margin of 77.2 percent

### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
In a landslide vote an
nounced early this morning,
Stanford students approved a
new judicial charter for the
first time since 19(58.
The approval of the charter,
which won by a margin of 1,704
to 219 — "yes" votes earning
88.0 percent — headlined a
vote characterized by the virtu
al inability of undergraduates
to say "no" to anything.
In addition to the charter,
nine out of the 10 proposed
constitutional amendments on
the ballot passed. Voters also
approved 30 special-fee re
quests, and only one request —
one of two on the ballot for the
Climbing Wall — was turned
down. (Please see related story,
page 6).
The judicial charter governs
alleged violations of the Honor
Code, Fundamental Standard
and other rules of student con
duct. The new charter would
replace the current adminis
tration-dominated judicial sys
tem with one that includes six
member judicial panels, com
prised of four students and two
faculty / staff members, to
hear cases.
ASSIJ Senator Howard Loo,
a senior who sat on the com
mittee that drafted the pro
posed judicial charter, was
pleased with the results. "I'm
really happy that the students
saw the advantages the charter
brings," he said. "This is a big
step in making the judicial sys

tem a process that students are
centrally involved in."
The charter now faces two
final hurdles before it can go
into effect. It must be approved
by both University President
Gerhard Casper and the Facul
ty Senate, which is expected to
vote on the charter at its May 1
meeting.
Loo believes that the diffi
cult part of the fight for ap
proval is over. "This was our
hardest battle," he said.
ASSU President Hill Shen
echoed Loo's enthusiasm for
the victory. "Students have
spoken," he said. "It's over
whelmingly positive. It's not
often that you get 90 percent of
Stanford students to agree on
anything."
Shen, a longtime proponent
of the judicial charter, earned
an even political split for the
evening. Senate Bill I-CA-9,
which Shen first proposed in
his February "State of the As
sociation" address, was the
only one of the 10 constitution
al amendments to fail at the
polls. That amendment would
have reduced the number of
senators for which undergrad
uates could vote from 15 to
five.
Despite that measure's fail
ure, Shen wasn't disappoint
ed. He said he "didn't expect
the amendment to pass this
year," and he hopes the senate
looks at the issue in the near
future.
