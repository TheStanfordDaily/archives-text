and other viruses. Here, you'll be a
part of a company that takes pride
in its achievements, knowing that
patients may benefit from the prod
ucts we create. Come join us id any

Research Biologist, Virology
You will investigate lIIV drug resistance at the molecular level by i haracterizing
pile not y pic properties of clinical HIV isolates. You will also construct recombi
nant viruses and determine their drug susceptibilities in vitro. In addition, you
will analyze the growth kinetics, enzymatic activities .uul phcnotypic properties
to determine drug resistance mechanisms. Requirements include a Bachelor's
degree in a relevant discipline and at least I year of technical research experi
ence in tissue culture of mammalian cells, basic molecular biology/virology, I'CR
and DNA sequencing.
Statistical Analysts
As a member of our Biometrics group, you will explore and exploit the relative
strengths of SAS anil (.'lmirials 4 0 to prepare and implement an efficient pro
gramming infrastructure for automated tracking and reporting for clinical trials.
I bis will include creating a library of SAS macros and resalable tools and main
taining a seamless interface between t .'lintrials, word processors and SAS and con
nectivity for remote SAS users. You will also create a (illl report interface lor clin
ical and data management users and provide users the ability to browse CRFs, data
listings and summaries. Along with a Master's in Statistics and 5 years' relevant
experience, we require strong skills m these areas SAS macros; SAS-AF; SAS
KIS; SAS-(iraph, SAS-FSP; structured | programming; UNIX. Fxcellent analytical,
writing and communication skills are also essential. Iwo positions available.
