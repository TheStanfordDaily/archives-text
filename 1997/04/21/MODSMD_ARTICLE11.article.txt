Disasters continue in N. Dakota
GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) — Slowed by
streets submerged in icy, sewage-fouled floodwa
ter from the rising Red River, firefighters yester
day wrestled a blaze under control after it ravaged
parts of three downtown business blocks.
The flames were under control by midday yes
terday after helicopters dumped 2,000-gallon
buckets of muddy water on the fire. But firefight
ers were checking for flare-ups.
"Six buildings are a total loss," Deputy Fire
Chief Peter O'Neill said. At least three others
were damaged, he said.
Police said the Red River, bloated by the melt
ing of the winter's snow accumulation, had flowed
into more than 70 percent of the city by yesterday.

Senate wants Reno to testify
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate committee
intends to put Attorney General Janet Reno
under oath to explain why she decided not to seek
an independent counsel to investigate Democratic
campaign fund raising, Sen. Orrin Hatch said yes
terday.
"I believe she's going to have a very difficult
time justifying" the decision, Hatch, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on "Fox
News Sunday."
Hatch, R-Utah, said Reno will appear before
the panel April 30 — unless she appoints an inde
pendent counsel before then. Asked if the com
mittee will put Reno under oath, Hatch answered,
"There's no question about that."
