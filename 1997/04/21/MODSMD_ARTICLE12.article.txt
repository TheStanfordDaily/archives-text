JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu escaped indictment in an influence-ped
dling scandal yesterday, with prosecutors saying
they lacked evidence to try him on charges of fraud
and breach of trust despite his "puzzling" conduct.
However, Netanyahu still faced a political crisis
with coalition allies threatening to bolt his govern
ment and his personal reputation and credibility
damaged.
"The decision is to close — for lack of sufficient
evidence — the case against the prime minister,"
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein told a news
conference.
Rubinstein said evidence provided by police did
suggest that Netanyahu might have appointed Roni
Bar-On as attorney general to satisfy a coalition ally
who is facing a corruption trial.

Netanyahu's actions "raised puzzling questions,"
he said. "From the evidence there is suspicion that
there were other (than legitimate) considerations"
in the appointment. "But we don't think this can be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
Rubinstein also rejected a police recommendation
to indict Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi. He said
prosecutors still were weighing charges against
Arieh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party,
who is suspected of trying to engineer the appoint
ment of Bar-On in exchange for a plea bargain that
would keep Deri out of jail. Israeli media had report
ed an indictment against Deri was certain.
Rubinstein said that Netanyahu's top political
aide, Avigdor Lieberman, and a contractor who is
close to Netanyahu, David Appel, would face further
investigation.
