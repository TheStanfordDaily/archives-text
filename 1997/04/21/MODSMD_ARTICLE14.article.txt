As modem access is
blocked, students' costs
must be considered

AT THE BEGINNING of the
school year, Distributed
Computing and Communi
cation Services unveiled its plan
for limiting student modem-pool
access to certain residences. It
claimed that on-campus and off
campus dial-in users were over
whelming the 300-odd modem
pool and that those residents who
have access to high-speed in-room
connections should be forced to
use them, thus freeing up limited
dial-in access for off-campus stu
dents who don't have the choice
of using Ethernet connections.
In effect, this change requires
residents of certain dorms who
already own modems to not only
purchase Ethernet equipment
but also pay an annual $45 regis
tration fee if they want to be able
to use Stanford's network.
Wednesday, DCCS announced
it will shut off dial-in access to
even more residences by next
year, leaving only 14 able to
access the modem pool.
This policy shift is an unfair
one to students, but it is nonethe
less obvious that the University is
committed to it and that more
and more dorms will be blocked
from dial-in access.
Even as it continues to imple
ment this plan, however, Stanford
must consider those modem
using juniors and seniors who are
suddenly finding their modem
investments obsolete and now
face a weighty one-time cost for
new network equipment that will
be of limited usefulness.
The purpose of the modem pool
is to allow call-in access to com
puter functions — like e-mail
accounts, Axess, class news
groups and World Wide Web sites,
Folio — that are essentially

required for daily existence as a
Stanford student.
As more and more on- and off
campus students began to spend
more and more time using these
resources, the telephone lines
into the modem pool were
increasingly tied up, and busy sig
nals became commonplace. Either
the modem pool needed to be
expanded — meaning more Uni
versity resources dedicated to
modems and telephone lines — or
on-campus students needed to
stop using dial-in access in favor
of Ethernet connections.
While DCCS's plan was pre
pared with plenty of input from
networking officials, Residential
Computing officials and a faculty
advisory group, little attention
has been given to student con
cerns. Many students will sud
denly find themselves without the
correct equipment — and possibly
without the means to purchase it
— to connect to the network.
Furthermore, students will
have little use for the hardware
necessary to make network con
nections once they leave Stan
ford; very few apartments come
with in-room connections. So
while expecting incoming stu
dents to make an investment in
networking equipment they will
be able to use for four years is not
unreasonable, asking next year's
seniors to do so is.
Through 1993, Residential
Computing rented out Ethernet
cards for $50 per year. Paying
$200 over four years for an Ether
net card is a bad investment when
buying your own card is often sig
nificantly cheaper. But to get a
card that you'll only use for one
year, $50 ain't a bad price.
If providing rental cards isn't a
possibility — it may be that the
pre-1993 rental units are obsolete
or broken or thrown out — the
University must come up with an
alternative. To leave current stu
dents facing the costs of an
administrative policy shift is sim
ply not fair.
