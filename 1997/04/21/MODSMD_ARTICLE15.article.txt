Causes not the same for all grad student depression

I AM WRITING this letter to express
my dismay with an article that
appeared in Thursday's Daily. The
article concerned the large number of
graduate students who are having trou
ble in their lives.
According to the director of Stan
ford's student counseling center, Coun
seling and Psychological Services, gradu
ate students are having enough trouble
to seek help at a rate of at least 750 stu
dents per year. This statistic clearly jus
tifies the writing, but I am disappointed
by the fact that your article took several
distinct problems and inappropriately
placed them under a single heading.
It was nice to see The Daily list the
three items that most frequently cause
emotional problems for graduate stu
dents. To summarize, they are clinical
depression, social isolation and profes
sional stress.
These difficulties are disjoint; each
has its own causes and its own solutions.
A student body, like any other communi
ty of sufficient size, is certainly going to

have instances of people who suffer from
the psychologically based disease of clini
cal depression.
Social isolation, however, is an entire
ly different condition. It is caused by an
extreme lack of support systems, which
is a common part of the graduate school
experience. It was good that the article
contrasted the communal lifestyle of an
undergraduate with the independent
lifestyle that is thrust upon graduate stu
dents. But a statement like "isolation
and loneliness aggravate depression" is
not helpful to people with either problem
because it confuses their treatments.
Lonely people are helped by fostering
an environment that builds social net
works, whereas clinically depressed peo
ple are best treated through therapy
and medication. Finally, students suf
fering from professional stress, such as
problems with one's adviser, are best
helped by addressing the specific source
of the stress.
Graduate students are the backbone
of the academic system, but sadly their

needs are often neglected by universi
ties. Stanford does little for those suf
fering with clinical depression (you
stated a limit of 10 counseling sessions
despite high success rates), and the
University does even less for those
with either of the other two problems
listed above.
For example, while one graduate stu
dent quoted in The Daily's story
expressed both depression and profes
sional stress, she was only able to
receive support for the former, even
though she said that the most benefit
came from addressing the latter.
Although I am fortunate not to have
either of those two problems, I can per
sonally testify to the fact that Stanford
does not adequately encourage social
activity among graduate students.
Despite my best attempts, I have been
quite lonely ever since starting school
here.
The CAPS director said that his staff
"looks at the person's social resources"
as a regular part of their counseling

procedures. This is an indication that
because Stanford does nothing to com
bat social isolation, graduate students
with this problem have been turning to
CAPS. But because CAPS is an organi
zation that only provides clinical help
and not help forming social connections,
it is not capable of giving these students
the kind of support they need and
deserve. Clearly, Stanford needs to con
sider establishing organizations that are
alternatives to CAPS, organizations
that are more appropriately focused on
dealing with social isolation and profes
sional stress.
The Daily can also do better. Your
paper shouldn't follow Stanford's
neglectful lead by clumping all forms of
emotional trouble into one category
labeled "depression." Instead, you could
pressure the University administration
into forming alternative organizations to
CAPS that would better fit the more
diverse needs of graduate students.
