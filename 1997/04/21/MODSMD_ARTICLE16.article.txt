# Recipients of deans' awards deserved more substantial coverage
## 
### 
I would like to comment on the
recent article in The Daily about the
deans' awards. Not only was the article
superficial in its treatment of this high
ly prestigious award but it also con
tained factual errors.
Regrettably, I cannot comment on
all of the students because I am not
familiar with their work, but I feel obli
gated to correct errors concerning
Matthew Old and Catherine Liu. Both
of these students work for the Depart
ment of Pediatrics, Infectious Disease
Division.

It has been my privilege to work
with Old for the past three years, and I
feel well qualified to comment on the
scope of his work with poliovirus. His
unique nucleic acid probe for specific
identification of the Sabin type 3 vac
cine strain of poliovirus, coupled with a
nonradioactive sequencing procedure
allowing for direct visualization and
quantitation of revertant strains of
Sabin type 3 poliovirus is the first of its
kind to rely totally on nonradioactive
techniques. The entire vaccine strategy
for eradication of poliovirus was altered
in the United States this year because
of the problem of vaccine-associated
paralytic poliomyelitis. Matt's findings
will have a major impact on vaccine
strategies worldwide and will be a key
element in the worldwide eradication of
poliovirus.

Liu was honored both for her labora
tory work at Stanford and for her work
in Africa. Catherine first became inter
ested in health care issues in Sierra
Leone through the community writing
service component of her freshman
English class. For several years she
maintained a relationship with a non
governmental organization in this
country and ultimately visited this area
as part of her honors project the sum
mer of her junior year.
Her thesis focuses on the causes of
the high infant and child mortality
rates in Sierra Leone. This study was
distinct from her laboratory work at
Stanford, which involved an evaluation
of the immune responses to varicella
vaccine in bone marrow transplant
recipients as well as a study on the age
related immunological differences

between adults and children to vari
calla (chicken pox).
I realize that space did not allow a
detailed description of each student's
work, but I feel that the superficial
manner in which this event was han
dled along with the numerous inaccura
cies did a disservice to these incredibly
talented students. Their work was
extraordinary and exemplifies the kind
of scholarship that should inspire other
students. It should be stressed that
their efforts have global impact.
There always seems to be plenty of
room for sports coverage in The Daliy.
Isn't it too bad that exaordinary schol
arship can't be recognized with at least
this much space, if only for one day?
