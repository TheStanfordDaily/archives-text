## Youthful considerations 
### 
WEDNESDAY I'LL TURN 22,
and so I inevitably think of
Spain. I was in Spain for my last
birthday, on a completely decadent week
end jaunt away from the Stanford in
Oxford house. It was a big event because
my birthday is a holiday in Europe — St.
George's Day, for the dragon slayer —
and so everyone is having a party to cele
brate it. I turned 21 in the Plaza Mayor
in Madrid, dewy and deserted in the dead
of night with three perfect people and a
bottle of champagne apiece. I feel safe in
saying that it will be difficult for any
birthday to match it.
Which parallels my feelings about my
quarter in Oxford as well. It is surprising
and ironic that my favorite quarter at
Stanford happened far, far away from
Stanford. My friend Katie thinks that the
reason we were all so happy was because
we were drunk all the time. Which
accounts for a lot of good memories. But
not all.
It is more than an alcohol-induced
haze which makes the quarter look so
perfect. It was the confluence of 51 peo
ple, most of whom had never met (before
it starts to sound like the Real World, I
should mention that there was probably
one degree of separation between anyone
at Stanford and anyone at Oxford. My
roommate and very dear friend Marisa
Pick accounts for most of this one degree)
and all of whom, in varying states, had
the feeling they had been given permis

sion to play hooky for 10 weeks.
It is a strange and wonderful thing to
watch people forget who they have been,
to take tremulous steps or big leaps
toward what they have always suspected
they might be. And perhaps, to bring
that back, along with Euro Cup posters
and the Oasis CD. Work and play in
their proper perspective, which is not
necessarily work first. This is not to say
we didn't work; I wrote about 65 pages
of my thesis. I'm just not sure exactly
when. I went to Spain and then to Spain
again, and to Amsterdam and to Vienna,
and in the middle I read a lot of Virginia
Woolf. I went to Morocco after term, but
that's another story, and it's one that
requires about 35 minutes, Greg, my
traveling companion, and a lot of hand
gestures to tell properly.
It was not a perfect quarter; real life
crosses the Atlantic divide just as it
enters Stanford's ivory tower. In the
middle of small crises — tortilla short
ages, food poisoning from Ahmed's
Doner Kebab van, fluctuating exchange
rates — came larger ones. I found out a
friend had AIDS when I was in Oxford,
right before my birthday. I wanted to
come home, badly. But I didn't. Some of
my best memories of Oxford come from
staying, from stopping at the old church
across the street to light a candle each
day. It was a quarter when life got
much more precarious and then, much
more precious.

It has stayed with me, in little ways
and big ones. A whiff of Tuscany per
fume or a glimpse of a black pea coat
sends me right back to High Street,
walking to Blackwell's for a book I didn't
need or to Parmenter's for a Greek salad
sandwich. I can't listen to Janis Joplin
without thinking of the May Day night a
group of us stayed up, dancing and
drinking Wild Turkey and going out to
Magdalen Bridge at 6 a.m. to listen to
the boys' choir. I have a scandalous sil
ver clubbing dress that I still can't
believe I actually wore out of the house.
And I have a perspective that I might
not have gained here at home. In the
architecture class I took, we learned
that it took 200 years (from 1200-1400,
I believe) to bring the form of the arch
from Italy to England. In America, 200
years constitutes the entire history of
democracy and its effects. Nowhere I
have ever traveled has made me feel
both my own youth and the youth of my
country as much as being in England.
We both have a lot of growing up to do.
From my time in England, I learned
quite a lot about how I would like to go
about it.
