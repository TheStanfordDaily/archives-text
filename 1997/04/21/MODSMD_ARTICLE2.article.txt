Africa Week 1997 begins today, launching a se
ries of speeches, discussions and performances. The
yearly celebration offers the campus an opportunity
to sample African music and food as well as learn
more about the continent's culture, politics and eco
nomics.
"We're basically trying to educate the larger com
munity about contemporary issues in Africa," se
nior Ije Ude explained.
"Because we're Africans, we have unique advan
tages in bringing forth information about Africa
that the University as an educational institution

values," said Aniefiok Akan-Etuk, a doctoral stu
dent.
African youth marks the theme of this year's
events. With all the talk about the coming of the
year 2000, the group that will lead Africa forward
into this next century is an obvious topic, said Duru
Ahanotu, a doctoral student.
"It'd be a good idea to know what the concerns,
hopes and aspirations of the youth are," Akan-Etuk
explained.
"There are a lot of issues about African youth
that aren't addressed," Ude said, adding that youth
are often the ones who suffer the most because of
the unrest in parts of Africa.
At the same time, that unrest
can be overreported. "A lot of
times, the news Americans get
[about Africa] is not from
Africans themselves," Ahanotu
said.
Ahanotu also spoke of other is
sues facing contemporary Africa.
He said that although Africa is
significantly behind East Asia in
terms of development, "a lot of in
vestors are realizing . . . that the
market [in East Asia] is becoming
saturated. ... A lot of eyes are
turning to Africa."
Telecommunication and infor
mation technology are entering
rural areas now, Ahanotu ex
plained. "Africa should see some

pretty good development," he said.
Ude said she sees important
signs of social progress. Most no
tably, "I feel that there's a lot of
pride in Africans themselves,"
she said. Whereas many Africans
previously bought into the myth
that they were lazy and incapable
of governing themselves, now
most believe they can manage
successfully on their own.
The University has hosted
Africa Week activities since the
Stanford African Students Asso
ciation established the event in
the 19705. Past celebrations have
focused on issues such as educa
tion and health and have brought
speakers such as noted Kenyan
writer Ngugi Wa Thiong'o.
This year's keynote speaker is
Hafsat Abiola, the daughter of
Nigeria's jailed president-elect,
Moshood Abiola. She will speak
tonight on the "Promise of

African Youth in Africa's Future
Development."
The week's festivities will offi
cially kick off at noon with the
Oriki Theater Drumming Cere
mony in White Plaza.
Bechtel International Center
will hold a panel discussion on
African youth and entrepreneur
ship at noon on Wednesday.
Thursday night will feature a va
riety of musical and dance perfor
mances as well as skits and story
telling at Tresidder Union.
The celebration will culminate
on Saturday with Africa Night,
featuring a speech by Lawrence
Esin on African entrepreneur
ship, followed by performances
and a dance party.
The Bookstore is also partici
pating in the festivities. It will ex
hibit African history, art, litera
ture, travel and children's books,
and maps throughout the week.
