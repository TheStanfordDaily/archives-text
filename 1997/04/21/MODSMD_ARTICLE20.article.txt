"Now we are here; next year may we be in
the Land of Israel. Now we are slaves; next
year may we be free men."
— The Passover Haggadah
NEXT YEAR, I will be in the Land of
Israel. I just found out this week
that come fall I will have the
chance to travel there and to work and
study at someone else's expense, and it all
sounds pretty good to me.
Almost. After all, like anyone who has
turned on the nightly news or seen the
angry letters flying across The Daily
recently on the issue of Israel, the Pales
tinians and peace, I have some observa
tions, and I have some concerns. So for
what it's worth, I'd like to talk about them
for a minute.
In all honesty, I haven't ever really been
sure why The Daily decides to let me
assemble the 5,000 or so characters that
appear in this corner every Monday. For
my part, I try to be mildly entertaining,
sometimes mildly informative, and so far

they've invited me back every week. But
this time I want to try a little deeper reflec
tion.
As the sun sets tonight, the Jewish hol
iday of Passover begins. All over the world
Jews will gather to recount the Biblical
tale of the Exodus, to tell of how Moses
lead the Israelites out of the slavery of
Egypt and into the freedom of the desert,
where they wandered for 40 years because
Moses wouldn't ask for directions. Then
we will partake in that most salient sym
bol of Passover, the matzo. This dry,
cracker-like substance commemorates the
unleavened bread eaten by the ancient
Israelites, who, forced to flee before their
own dough could rise, had only enough
time to stop off at Safeway for a few boxes
of Manischewitz.
Among all the ceremonial storytelling
and ritual mastication, the message of the
moment should not be lost. The story of
Passover is a story of redemption from
slavery with a subtext that says any and all
stories of slavery can end in freedom when

faith and hope are sustained. This message
is as important now as ever, severely so in
the area of the world where its original
narrative is set.
For me, the scary part of picking up
any newspaper story on the Middle East
is not so much the reports of new hostili
ty as the sense of hopelessness that's hid
den in every headline and laced through
every lead. Headings that announce the
"continuing collapse" of the peace pro
cess do nothing to explain or acknowl
edge how the process has come as far as it
has. Stories that spout how the "hope for
peace has been derailed" do nothing to
answer the plea of the young rock-throw
ing Palestinian in Hebron who was quot
ed as saying, "I don't want to fight them,
but what do I do?"
And where's the hope when politicians
and leaders seemingly acknowledge that
terrorism and uprising are just so many
political tactics? I want to yell out every
time I hear some official spokesperson —
from either side — announce that the lat

est political developments "could lead to
violence," almost as if they want it, or at
least have no plans to stop it. I want to
scream that they just don't get it.
Maybe this call for hope is naive. After
all, Exodus itself is a violent story. The
Israelites "plagued" their enemy until they
got what they wanted. But the story also
relates how the Israelites were pursued,
and they persevered as the violence of the
Egyptians was drowned out at sea. For
what it's worth, I'll stick by it.
On March 21, a Palestinian bomber
blew himself up in Tel Aviv's Cafe Apro
pos, killing himself and three young Israeli
women — one died pregnant, another fell a
few feet from her infant daughter. All in
all, a grisly act of terrorism.
Only this time, it seems, Israel wasn't
terrified. In a contrast to past terror
aftermath, the nation opted for solidari
ty over despondency. Tel Aviv Mayor
Roni Milo intended to cancel the city's
upcoming Purim festivities, but public
reaction changed his mind. Within 48

hours Cafe Apropos was back in busi
ness, memorial candles and all.
I want to see this response as a promis
ing realization that amid the recent
tragedies and deaths, the larger hope can
not die. It is the only way to extricate the
process from its current quandary.
Israeli columnist Ze'ev Chafets wrote
that "if, in the future, the families of the
victims are allowed to mourn in private
while the rest of us go about our business,
it will do more to defeat... terrorism than
a thousand policemen." And then, hopeful
ly, there will be no more victims for fami
lies to mourn.
For what it's worth, let this be my
Passover offering.

chology, promises that from here on, ht
will only write alxnit things that are, if run
meaningless, at least light-hearted.
