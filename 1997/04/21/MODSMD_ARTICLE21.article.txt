## Another Pac-10 title Women cruise by Bruins, Trojans 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team put the icing on a
rather impressive cake this week
end by finishing the regular season
with yet another undefeated con
ference mark.
The Cardinal (26-1,10-0 Pacific
10 Conference South Division)
clinched a 10th consecutive Pac-10
crown and a third straight unblem
ished Pac-10 season by drowning
No. 5 UCLA 8-1 Saturday and No.
33 USC 6-1 Friday.
"I think that is a big deal,"
Brennan said. "When you have
Arizona starting the season at No.
4, UCLA sitting at No. 3 for a part
of the season and everyone else in
the top 10 at some point, I think it
is an accomplishment just to win
the Pac-10. To go undefeated I
think is pretty amazing."
Stanford, winners of 15 straight

dual-matches and 34 straight Pac
-10 clashes, pulled no punches with
the Bruins and Trojans, winning
both of them in singles.
Against the fifth-ranked Bru
ins, the Cardinal swept all six sin
gles matches, five of them in
straight sets. Freshman Lilia
Osterloh once again proved her
worth at the No. 1 singles spot by
beating UCLA sophomore Kati
Kocsis 6-3, 6-2.
Osterloh's win marked the sec
ond time in three weeks that she
has beaten Kocsis, the No. 10 sin
gles player nationally, in straight
sets. In between, Osterloh upset
the No. 3 player, Arizona's Vicky
Maes.
However, the top-ranked sin
gles player in the country, Stan
ford senior Katie Schlukebir, was
busy steamrolling through her
UCLA opponent two single spots
below Osterloh. Schlukebir demol
ished Annica Cooper 6-1, 6-0.
In the No. 6 spot, Stanford
freshman Teryn Ashley gave Bran
di Freudenberg a similar beating,
rolling over the UCIA sophomore
6-1,6-0.
Also winning in straight sets
were freshman Anne Kremer at
the No. 2 singles spot and senior
Sandra De Silva in the No. 4 spot.
Kremer defeated Elizabeth
Schmidt 6-3, 6-2 while De Silva
had little trouble with Kelly
Rudolph, winning 6-1, 6-2.
The only UCLA singles com
petitor who could hang on long
enough to break a sweat was fresh
man Katia Roubanova, who
extended junior Julie Scott into a
three-set match at No. 5 singles.
Scott held on, however, for a 6-2,5-
7, 6-2 victory.
In doubles, UCLA saved some
face by earning an upset win at the
No. 1 doubles spot. Roubanova and
Schmidt, ranked 22nd nationally,
got the best of No. 12 Osterloh and
Schlukebir 8-6.

The remaining doubles squads
emerged unscathed from upset,
however. Scott and junior Ania
Bleszynski, the No. 2 squad in the
country, defeated Cooper and Koc
sis 8-3. No. 58 Kremer and Ashley
beat Rudolph and Freudenberg 8-5.
Absent from the singles lineup
this weekend was junior Ania
Bleszynski, the No. 5 competitor
for the Cardinal.
"There are a couple of little
things with Ania," Brennan said.
"She has had some foot problems
and has been struggling. She just
needed a little bit of a rest. Teryn
has been playing great, so we want
ed to get her a little more experi
ence."
The No. 33 Trojans were no
match for the Cardinal either.
USC did manage to earn one win
in singles, although the Women of
Troy dropped the remaining five in
straight sets. Osterloh continued
her winning ways with a 6-3, 6-1
win over Ditta Huber. Kremer,
who missed the homestand against
UCLA and USC with strep throat,
made her presence felt with a 6-4,
7-6 win over Karolina Baklarova.
Schlukebir rolled against USC
as well, defeating sophomore Eva
Jimenez 6-2, 6-2. Scott and Ashley

cruised as Stanford usually does at
the bottom of the lineup, winning
6-2, 6-4 and 6-4, 6-1, respectively.
Veronika Safarova earned the
upset of the day, however, beating
De Silva in three sets 7-6,1-6, 7-6.
"Sandra was just a little spacy
that day," Brennan said. "It was
just one of those days where she
couldn't concentrate. Everybody's
allowed a lousy match every once
in awhile."
The only doubles match of the
afternoon took place on the No. 2
court, where Bleszynski and Scott
disposed of Baklarova and Boyd 8-
4.
With the two wins, the Cardinal
virtually wrapped up the No. 2
seed in the NCAA Championships
at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
Stanford's only loss of the season
was a 4-3 defeat at the hands of
No. 1 Florida, who will earn the
top seed. The Cardinal and the
Gators met in last year's NCAA
title match, which Florida won 5-2.
"I was very pleased with this
weekend," Brennan said. "I think
everybody's clicking. I really think
we are coming together as a team.
I had a lot of questions throughout
the season, but I think we are
finally in place now."
