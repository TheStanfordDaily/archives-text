## Another Pac-10 title Women cruise by Bruins, Trojans 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team put the icing on a
rather impressive cake this week
end by finishing the regular season
with yet another undefeated con
ference mark.
The Cardinal (26-1,10-0 Pacific
10 Conference South Division)
clinched a 10th consecutive Pac-10
crown and a third straight unblem
ished Pac-10 season by drowning
No. 5 UCLA 8-1 Saturday and No.
33 USC 6-1 Friday.
"I think that is a big deal,"
Brennan said. "When you have
Arizona starting the season at No.
4, UCLA sitting at No. 3 for a part
of the season and everyone else in
the top 10 at some point, I think it
is an accomplishment just to win
the Pac-10. To go undefeated I
think is pretty amazing."
Stanford, winners of 15 straight

dual-matches and 34 straight Pac
-10 clashes, pulled no punches with
the Bruins and Trojans, winning
both of them in singles.
Against the fifth-ranked Bru
ins, the Cardinal swept all six sin
gles matches, five of them in
straight sets. Freshman Lilia
Osterloh once again proved her
worth at the No. 1 singles spot by
beating UCLA sophomore Kati
Kocsis 6-3, 6-2.
Osterloh's win marked the sec
ond time in three weeks that she
has beaten Kocsis, the No. 10 sin
gles player nationally, in straight
sets. In between, Osterloh upset
the No. 3 player, Arizona's Vicky
Maes.
However, the top-ranked sin
gles player in the country, Stan
ford senior Katie Schlukebir, was
busy steamrolling through her
UCLA opponent two single spots
