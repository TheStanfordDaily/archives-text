# Volleyball trounces Pepperdine at home
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team opened play in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment with a three-game victory
Saturday over Pepperdine. At
stake in the tournament is an
automatic berth to the NCAA
Championships to be held in
Columbus, Ohio, next month.
Although Stanford was the
tournament's second seed and the
No. 3 team in the land coming into
Saturday's match, it had a very
tough test in the opening round, a
matchup with national No. 5 Pep
perdine (18-9,13-6 MPSF), a team
that many believed had all of the
weapons to win a national title.
However, as in every other match
at Burnham Pavilion this season, a
powerful opponent came in with
high hopes only to be handled eas
ily by Stanford.
In Saturday's match, the Cardi
nal (22-3,16-3 MPSF) played some
of its best volleyball of the year.
Stanford defeated the Waves 15-
13, 15-9, 15-13, gaining a berth in
the semifinals at UCLA against
Brigham Young and putting an
end to Pepperdine's season.
Stanford's offense was very well
balanced. Senior outside hitter
Matt Fuerbringer led the Cardinal
with 21 kills. In addition to Fuer
bringer, Stanford's outside attack
was strengthened by freshman
outside hitter Andy Witt and
senior outside hitter Mike Lam-

Bert, who had 19 and 17 kills,
respectively.
But Stanford did not rely solely
upon its outside hitters for offense.
Middle blockers Mike Hoefer, a
senior, and Keenan Whitehurst, a
junior, who have been mainstays
of the Stanford attack all year, con
tinued their superb play. Hoefer
totaled 11 kills while Whitehurst
chipped in 10 of his own.
The balance of inside and out
side, combined with Stanford's
ability to spread the ball to all of its
hitters proved too much for Pep
perdine. The fourth-place team in
the Mountain Division was simply
unable to stop the Pacific Division
champions. The moment that it
appeared the Waves had stopped
one Stanford player, another rose
to the forefront, picking up kills at
critical times in the match.
"We had real good offensive bal
ance," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "I thought that Fuer
bringer in particular had a very
strong match. Aside from the one
stretch in the match where we
gave up four aces in a row, his ser
vice receive was outstanding, as
was his attacking. Andy Witt also
played a great match. He really got
us going early and set the tone for
us because he was so aggressive in
going after Pepperdine."
The victory, Stanford's 13th in
a row and the team's 12th in 12
tries at Burnham this year puts
Stanford into the tournament's

second weekend. On Thursday,
the Cardinal will face BYU, one of

only three teams to beat Stanford
all year.
The other two teams that will be
joining Stanford in next weekend's
play are host UCLA, who achieved
an easy three-game victory over
Pacific and UC-Santa Barbara,

who defeated Long Beach State in
three games.
"We have two weeks left in our
season," Nieves said. "Our main
concern is to be sure that we enter
every match healthy and sharp for
each opponent."
