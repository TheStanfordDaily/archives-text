They were solid gold without the gold.
In front of hundreds of animated fans,
through rain delays, sun, roars and heck
ling, the Stanford men's tennis team daz
zled its way to victory this weekend, oust
ing USC and then knocking off No. 1
UCLA.
Energy emanated through the Card's
brand new stadium while "Goldy" — a key
component of the two-time national cham
pion squad — looked on. All-American
junior Paul Goldstein, ranked 11th in the
nation, cheered anxiously as he watched
his team take out the top-ranked Bruins.
"This was a huge weekend for us," said
freshman Mike Bryan. "The team looks
really strong for the NCAAs, even without
Goldy."
Hours of intense tennis became particu
larly nerve-racking early on in the week
end, as rain drenched the Card's new sta
dium Friday afternoon, forcing the
match's conclusion to be postponed until
early Saturday morning.
As the Card went home, visions of Tro
jans danced in their heads, as Stanford
trailed USC 3-2 with two third sets loft to
complete the next morning.
Stanford dropped the doubles point to
the Trojans before the rain delay, as fresh

men Hob and Mike Bryan fell to George
Bastl and Kyle Spencer 9-7, and sopho
more Ryan Wolters and junior Misha Pale
cek fell to Patrick Gottsleben and
Johannes Mueller 8-4. Senior Grant
Elliott and freshman Geoff Abrams' victo
ry over Fernando Samayoa and Akram
Zaman was not enough, as Stanford went
into the singles trailing the Trojans 1-0.
When the rains hit, Wolters and Bob
Bryan had already fallen to Bastl and
Gottesleben, respectively, while Mike
Bryan had cruised past Mueller 6-1, 6-4,
and Geoff Abrams had knocked off USC's
Spencer 6-3, 6-2.
That left Stanford's Elliott and junior
Charles lloeveler to finish their matches
Saturday morning at 9:15 a.m. Elliott led
Samayoa 6-4, 4-6, 4-2 at the delay, while
lloeveler lot! Zaman 7-6, 1-6, 5-2.
"Mike and 1 were talking about how we
could not sleep, thinking about how
Charles and Grant had to finish," said Bob
Bryan. "I had nightmares."
Yet Saturday came, with sunshine and
Stanford, as lloeveler and Elliott finished
off the Trojans to give the Cardinal a 4-3
victory. Stanford increased its record to
22-2 while USC fell to 15-6.
"It.was pretty early in the morning, so
there were not many people there," said
Boh Bryan. "Just us, a few fans and USC."


Sasha Mitelman — Daily
Sophomore Ryan Wolters celebrates Stanford's
upset of top-ranked UCLA after his three-set win
clinched the victory Saturday.
But as the afternoon came, so
did the crowds, as Stanford hosted
the top-ranked Bruins in a day of
spectacular collegiate tennis.
Stanford fought back from
behind when the Cardinal lost two
out of the three doubles to the Bru
ins. Mike and Bob Bryan fell to
Kevin Kim and Eric Lin 8-5 while
Matt Breen and Jason Cook beat
Wolters and Palecek 8-4. Elliott
and Abrams won at the No. 2 posi
tion, taking out Eric Taino and
Alex Decret 9-8.
Trailing 10 going into the sin
gles, Stanford fans watched the
scoreboard intently as all six sin
gles matches remained tight bat
tles in the first set. As Wolters
broke Taino to go up 5-4 in the

first set and then took the set, Bob
Bryan fought back on court two.
The freshman was trailing 4-1 but
broke back to turn around and
take the first set and then the
match against Decret 7-6, 6-1.
Excitement continued as tem
pers flared on court 3. At 2-1,
UCLA's Kim trailed Mike Bryan,
slashing at the net as Bryan con
trolled the match. The Cardinal
freshman cruised to victory
against 29th-ranked Kim 6-4, 6-3.
"I knew I just had to stay tough
and pumped because every match
counted," said Mike Bryan. "We
had to get four singles."
Stanford now led 2-1, but
UCLA would not go away as Cook
took out Hoeveler 7-5, 6-2. Elliott,
in the last home match of his Stan
ford career fought back from a 5-2
deficit in the second set but could
not hold on, losing in the third to
Breen 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.

When Stanford's third starting
freshman claimed victory in the
third set as Abrams took out Vin
cent Allegre 6-7, 6-4, 6-1, crowds
cheered and all eyes looked to court
one, as 23rd-ranked Wolters and
ninth-ranked Taino battled for the
victory and the match.
"Wolters played really clutch
tennis," Bob Bryan said. "We all
rushed the court when he took the
match."
Stanford fans exploded as
Wolters took Taino in the third 6-
4, 5-7, 6-4.
"It must have been like deja vu
for Taino," Bryan said. Earlier in
the season at UCLA, Wolters and
Taino played for the match and
UCLA claimed victory.
But Saturday was all Stanford,
as the Cardinal now looks toward
the championships next month —
without Goldy — but with talent,
depth and determination.
