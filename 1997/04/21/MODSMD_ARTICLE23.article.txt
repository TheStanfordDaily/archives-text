They were solid gold without the gold.
In front of hundreds of animated fans,
through rain delays, sun, roars and heck
ling, the Stanford men's tennis team daz
zled its way to victory this weekend, oust
ing USC and then knocking off No. 1
UCLA.
Energy emanated through the Card's
brand new stadium while "Goldy" — a key
component of the two-time national cham
pion squad — looked on. All-American
junior Paul Goldstein, ranked 11th in the
nation, cheered anxiously as he watched
his team take out the top-ranked Bruins.
"This was a huge weekend for us," said
freshman Mike Bryan. "The team looks
really strong for the NCAAs, even without
Goldy."
Hours of intense tennis became particu
larly nerve-racking early on in the week
end, as rain drenched the Card's new sta
dium Friday afternoon, forcing the
match's conclusion to be postponed until
early Saturday morning.
As the Card went home, visions of Tro
jans danced in their heads, as Stanford
trailed USC 3-2 with two third sets loft to
complete the next morning.
Stanford dropped the doubles point to
the Trojans before the rain delay, as fresh

men Hob and Mike Bryan fell to George
Bastl and Kyle Spencer 9-7, and sopho
more Ryan Wolters and junior Misha Pale
cek fell to Patrick Gottsleben and
Johannes Mueller 8-4. Senior Grant
Elliott and freshman Geoff Abrams' victo
ry over Fernando Samayoa and Akram
Zaman was not enough, as Stanford went
into the singles trailing the Trojans 1-0.
When the rains hit, Wolters and Bob
Bryan had already fallen to Bastl and
Gottesleben, respectively, while Mike
Bryan had cruised past Mueller 6-1, 6-4,
and Geoff Abrams had knocked off USC's
Spencer 6-3, 6-2.
That left Stanford's Elliott and junior
Charles lloeveler to finish their matches
Saturday morning at 9:15 a.m. Elliott led
Samayoa 6-4, 4-6, 4-2 at the delay, while
lloeveler lot! Zaman 7-6, 1-6, 5-2.
"Mike and 1 were talking about how we
could not sleep, thinking about how
Charles and Grant had to finish," said Bob
Bryan. "I had nightmares."
Yet Saturday came, with sunshine and
Stanford, as lloeveler and Elliott finished
off the Trojans to give the Cardinal a 4-3
victory. Stanford increased its record to
22-2 while USC fell to 15-6.
"It.was pretty early in the morning, so
there were not many people there," said
Boh Bryan. "Just us, a few fans and USC."
