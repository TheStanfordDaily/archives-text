# Baseball loses two in series vs. UCLA
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division crowned a new
king this weekend: the UCLA
Bruins. It's just too bad the for
malities had to come at the
expense of Stanford.
The No. 2 Bruins (34-11-1,14-
7 Six-Pac), meeting Stanford in
the first of two series this season,
took two of three games from the
No. 5 Cardinal (29-13, 14-7) this
weekend at Sunken Diamond,
allowing them to tie Stanford for
the top spot in the standings.
"We just made the rest of the
season a lot harder on ourselves
than we wanted to," said sopho
more third baseman Josh
Hochgesang. "We're really going
to have to focus now."
The Six-Pac tie with UCLA
should make the last series of the
regular season, when Stanford
travels to Jackie Robinson Stadi
um, more important than anyone
could have fathomed.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer
disagrees.
"The people who made the
schedule must have been able to
tell the future," he said. "Why
else would we have all our games
against UCLA in the last half of
the season, and our last ones in
L.A.?"
Stanford's weekend started
prophetically, as Friday night's
game was rained out and
rescheduled as the first half of a
doubleheader Saturday.
In Saturday's first game,
Stanford ace Kyle Peterson (7-2)
outdueled Olympian Jim Parque
(11-1) to hand the junior his first
loss of the season.
After giving up two UCLA
runs in the first, Peterson set the
Bruins down in order in the sec
ond, striking out senior designat
ed hitter Chad Matoian for his
300 th career strikeout. The
junior is only the fourth Stanford
pitcher ever to reach that mark.
Peterson was able to cruise for
the rest of the game, giving up
only single runs in the third and
fifth. Sophomore Tony Cogan
took over for him in the eighth,
allowing only a lonely double in
the ninth to get his third save.
Peterson logged 7 2/3 innings,
giving up only five hits and set
ting down six players on strikes.
Stanford gave Peterson con
sistent support, spreading seven

runs over four innings.
The launching pad for Stan
ford occurred in the bottom of the
third, when the offense was able
to break a 3-3 tie. After consecu
tive singles by freshman desig
nated hitter John Gall and Scha
effer put runners at first and sec
ond with no outs, sophomore cen
ter fielder Jody Gerut's sacrifice
bunt moved the runners over.
Then Hochgesang hit a grounder
to second to score Gall, putting
the team ahead 4-3.
Stanford caught a break to
pull ahead even further. When
senior first baseman Luke
Quaccia grounded to first, the
ball was stopped, dropped, picked
up, then dropped again by
UCLA's Peter Zamora. Quaccia
had plenty of time to reach first
and, more importantly, Schaeffer
had plenty of time to scamper
across the plate to increase Stan
ford's lead to 5-3.
From there, Stanford was able
to add one in the fourth and one
in the seventh, never trailing.
But after the opener, the tide
turned against Stanford, which
lost the nightcap 8-5 before a sea
son-high crowd of 2,494.
Sophomore starter Brent
Hoard, despite pitching 8 1/3
innings and giving up only seven
hits, couldn't keep the ball in the
park, and gave up eight runs.
In fact, Hoard couldn't even
get past the first batter, as he
gave up back-to-back home runs
to senior left fielder Jon Hein
richs and junior right fielder Eric
Byrnes to start the game.
Byrnes finished with two
home runs.
The lone hopeful moment for
Stanford was when Quaccia sent
a ball over the fence for a two-run
home run, his second towering
shot this week.
But in the end, Stanford had
to choke down a bitter 8-5 loss.
The win put UCIxA only one
game behind Stanford in the Six-
Pac, with a shot to tie yesterday.
At the beginning of yester
day's game, Stanford obviously
had different ideas, jumping
ahead quickly in the first inning.
After senior left fielder Chris
Clark singled, Gall swung at a
fastball that rolled off his bat like
string cheese. Gall, apparently
thinking the ball was foul, stared
at the slow grounder without
moving until freshman third
baseman Aldo Pinto began to

bear down on it. Gall took off and
beat the throw from Pinto by a
step, sending Clark to third and
setting the table for Schaeffer.
Schaeffer took the hint and
slammed the next pitch over sec
ond base and up the middle for a
single, sending Clark home for
the first run of the game.
In the bottom of the second,
Stanford scraped out another run
on a few lucky bounces.
Hochgesang started it off by
hitting a high chopper over the
pitcher, reaching first when
junior second baseman Nick

Theodorou tried to borehand the
ball. After Qunccin hit a ground
hall and freshman Edmund
Muth struck out, junior Jay Pecci
hit a hard grounder to third that
seemed destined for an out. But
on its second bounce, the ball
landed on the rim of the grass,
scooting underneath the out
stretched glove of Pinto and into
left field, allowing Ilochgesang to
score from second.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
UCLA's junior pitcher Peter


Sasha Mitolman — Daily
Junior Kyle Peterson cjets ready to fire one in the fifth inning of
Stanford's 7-4 opening-game win in Saturday's doubleheader.
Zamora bore down after the sec
ond, limiting the Cardinal to three
more hits the rest of the way.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
spread five runs over five innings
mid chipped their way into the lead.
Stanford added a run in the bot
tom of the ninth, but the rally
wasn't enough to avert a 5-3 loss.
"They really took it to us," Scha
effer said. "But we didn't play our
best."
The losses put the Bruins and
Cardinal neck and neck in the Six-
Pac with less than a month to play.
"We play our last series against
UCLA, but that doesn't mean we
can look past the next two weeks,"
Schaeffer said. "We need to win the
next two series before UCLA. That
way, we can roll into the last
series."
Hochgesang pointed out that
the next two series against Califor
nia and Arizona count as much in
the standings as the UCLA games.
"We have to understand the
importance of 'one game at a
time,' " Hochgesang said. "We can't
look past these next two series."
Stanford plays its njcxt game at^,

Sunken Diamond tomorrow night
at 7 p.m. against Sacramento
State, in a primer for the series
against Cal next weekend.
