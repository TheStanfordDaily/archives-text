lOWA CITY, lowa — Two members of the
Stanford men's gymnastics team competed Sat
urday night in the event finals at the NCAA
Championships at the University of lowa.
Both senior Keith Wiley and sophomore
Scott Finkelstein qualified for to compete for
an individual and All-American honors on the
pommel horse.
Finkelstein performed an outstanding rou
tine. He posted a 9.7875 - third behind Ohio
State's Drew Durbin with 9.9125 and New
Mexico's Kendall Schiess with 9.825. However,
Wiley had a break in his routine and scored
9.325, placing ninth.
"I was pleased with my performance and
with the outcome, finishing third was definite
ly a satisfying accomplishment,' Finkelstein
said.
Coming away from lowa with only one All-

American title was somewhat of a disappoint
ment for this team, which entered the competi
tion with the most All-Americans.
There was Wiley, who took second in the all
around in last year's meet; senior lan
Bachrach, first on floor and second on vault and
high bar; senior Jamie Ellis, first on the paral
lel bars; junior Clarence Miao, fourth on vault;

and redshirt sophomore Jeremy Herman, fifth
on pommel horse.
With this much talent, how could this team
go wrong?
The Cardinal finished sixth in team compe
tition Thursday night, failing to advance to the
team finals. California won the
team finals with a 233.825, fol
lowed by Oklahoma with 232.725
and lowa with 231.8.
How could they fail to advance
to final round of team competition
with much of last year's third
place team still in place?

For starters — Bachrach, Ellis
and Herman were nursing
injuries. Ellis dislocated his shoul
der, Bachrach tore cartilage in his
knee and Herman hurt his back.
"Because of injuries, we
couldn't do enough routines before
this competition," said head coach
Sadao Hamada.
And many of the gymnasts sim
ply had off nights. Wiley was not
performing up to par, and Miao
peaked two weeks ago.

Also, the judging was not in the
Card's favor. Good routines were
consistently undervalued while
precious momentum was lost.
Regardless of why or how, the
team can take these lessons and
experience with them as the
squad looks toward the future.
On the surface the future looks
grim for the Stanford team that
will lose its top three gymnasts —
Wiley, Ellis and Bachrach — to
graduation.

These three seniors led and
inspired the team all year. Wiley's
strong and consistent perfor
mances gave the team a solid foun
dation to build upon all year, while
the determination of Ellis and
Bachrach to compete despite
injuries gave the team emotional
inspiration.
But now these three have
retired from the sport, and the
next generation of All-Americans
must learn to lead the team.
