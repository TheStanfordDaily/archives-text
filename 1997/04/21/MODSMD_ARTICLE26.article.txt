# Women look ahead to '98
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The season officially closed for the
women's gymnastics team when two mem
bers of the Cardinal ended their quest for the

individual title at the NCAA Championships
held in Gainesville, Fla., Thursday. The Car
dinal, which finished a surprisingly low fifth
place at NCAA Regionals two weeks ago, was
not able to qualify into the meet as
a team.
Carrying the hopes of the entire
team, sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick
and freshman Larissa Fontaine
fought against nearly 100 gym
nasts in the preliminary round.
Neither Fitzpatrick nor Fontaine
were able to move on to the final
round Saturday.
While both gymnasts struggled
on the balance beam, Fontaine
emerged from stiff competition as a
second-team Ail-American for the

three remaining events. Taking
seventh place on the bar and floor
events and placing 10th on the
vault, Fontaine placed 14th overall.
"For Larissa to place as high as
she did is just incredible," head
coach Lisa Izzi said. "She and sev
eral girls were capable of doing that
all year long — but to actually do it
is amazing."
Izzi said the number of ties —
although more than usually seen
on the first day of competition — is
somewhat expected at such a cut
ting-edge, high-level meet.
Although Fontaine's score of
9.875 was the second-highest score
marked on the vault, nine gym
nasts tied for first place with a

slightly higher score of 9.9.
And despite Fontaine's 9.875 on
the bars and 9.8 on the floor, the
third- and fifth-highest scores (not
counting ties), she was unable to
squeeze past the preliminary cuts.
"It was unfortunate that there
were so many ties," Fontaine said.
"But I am very pleased with my
routines. Except for the beam, they
were some of the best routines I've
done all year."
The fall off the four-inch appa
ratus on her combination series
was the only significant mistake
Fontaine made at the meet; howev
er, it proved critical as the 9.275
she received on the apparatus left
her with a score of 38.825 points

total, just short of earning first
team All-American honors as an
all-around gymnast.
Fitzpatrick, who finished in
23rd place with a total of 37.925,
gave strong performances on the
bars and floor, marking high scores
of 9.75 and 9.7, respectively. She
was not named an All-American.
"Katie had a good day, but she
had a couple of minor mistakes,"
Izzi said.
While she felt the level of gym
nastics was "very good" at the
meet, Fontaine still confirmed the
Cardinal team's skill.
"Watching the teams, I realized
we should be right up there next
vear," she said.
