# Women's golf starts Pac-10s

Trees may be nice to look at, but
for a golfer, they're not so nice to
play in.
The Stanford women's golf
team and others will be expected to
hit out of the woods, as they play
the first round of the Pacific 10
Conference Championships today.
The par-73 Tacoma Country
Club, at about 6,000 yards in
length, is well-known for its dense
ly populated arboreal course. The
Washington golf course has hosted
every major U.S. Golf Amateur
women's event; and it is sponsor
ing the 54-hole tournament.
The Pac-10 showcases a strong
field of NCAA contenders includ
ing Arizona State, UCLA and Ari
zona.
Among the 50 players was Ari
zona's Marisa Baena, who eagled a
hole in sudden death to help the
Wildcats win the national champi
onship last year. Baena is current
ly ranked the top collegiate golfer
with a 73 stroke average.
UCLA's top players, Amandine
Vincent and Jeong-Min Park
clinched top-10 finishes at last

year's Pac-lOs, held at the Raven
Golf Course in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal, led by seniors
Andrea Baxter and Mhairi McKay,
is another strong Pac-10 and
NCAA contender. Co-captain Bax
ter is currently ranked second
behind Baena with a 73.21 stroke
average. McKay is ranked fifth
nationally with 74.7.
The Card is coming off a strong
second-place finish at the Peg
Barnard Collegiate, which helped
boost the team's confidence. But
while the women are ready to rip
their drives, chip their bunkers and
strut their putts, they must be
wary of course management.
The heavily tree-lined course is
reminiscent of the Ford Ord-Bayo
net Course in Monterey. Tree-lined
courses are not the Cardinal's spe
cialty. The team played the Mon
terey course in early March, where
players struggled to hack balls out
of the trees for a mediocre 10th
place finish.
Built in 1894, the Tacoma
course is one of the oldest west of
the Mississippi. Its classic layout
features hundreds of old oak and
fir trees, which adds to its tradi
tional character.

During practice last week, the
team worked on its trick shots in
anticipation of hitting out of the
Tacoma woods. For example,
golfers will need to work around
oak trees on the par-3 15th.
Players practiced crouching and
gripping way down on the club
shaft for a low swing in order to
avoid hitting the branches.
Using 5-irons on the trick shots
and focusing on short game will be
a key strategy for a strong team
score, McKay said.
The heavily bunkered greens,
although relatively flat, are small
and tight. The speed of the greens
run about 9.5 step-meters.
The first and fourth holes, both
par-4s, run long fairways with
tight greens.
While the team said it will treat
the Pac-10 tournament like any
other season tournament, psycho
logically the stakes are higher
because the tournament serves as
a precursor for the NCAA West
Regionals and the national champi
onship.
"We've been working so hard all
season for these next three tourna
ments," McKay said. "So it's now
or never."
