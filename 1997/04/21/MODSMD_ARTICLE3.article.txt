# Tennis, anyone?
## Renovated center is largest in California 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
After $5.8 million worth of ren
ovations, the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium formally opened this
weekend as the largest outdoor
tennis venue in Northern Califor
nia.
The new tennis facility adds
about 1,300 seats to the existing
tennis stadium's seating capacity
of 1,130. The center also features
a full competition-sized champi
onship indoor court, a new ticket
booth, a concession stand, men's
and women's restrooms, an out
door courtyard and room for fu
ture office space.
"It's a really nice, beautiful sta
dium," said Stanford men's coach
Dick Gould, now in his 31st season
with the Cardinal. The Center's
completion "is a gigantic source of
satisfaction."

The renovated stadium was
funded completely by more than
400 private donors, with nearly
$2.5 million donated by the Tad
Taube family, Gould said.
Taube — a businessman and
Stanford alumnus who received
his bachelor's in 1954 and his
master's in 1957 — is a good
friend of Gould's and has a strong
affinity for tennis. The developer
and philanthropist remains active
in the University, serving on the
Hoover Institution's Board of
Overseers and on the Advisory
Board for Jewish Studies at Stan
ford. He is most renowned for
founding the now-defunct United
States Football League.
Gould noted that many private
donations also came from former
tennis players.
The stadium took nearly a year
to complete. During construction,
many tennis matches were played
on the outdoor courts and the
three stadium courts despite the
noise.
"During the construction peri
od, all existing 11 courts remained
open for use by the tennis players
for practice and matches," said Ju
nior Project / Construction Man
ager Mike Sprecher of the Facili
ties and Operations Division.
Besides the renovation of the
stadium, Sprecher said the most
important new addition is the in
door competition-sized court for
use during bad weather.
The upgraded stadium gives
Stanford the opportunity to host
showcase events such as the
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onship, which comes to the Uni
versity later this year. Could also
hopes the new center will attract
even bigger events such as early
rounds of Davis Cup competition
and World Team Tennis.
"We are humbled and excited
about the opportunities our entire
donor base has provided, and it is
our responsibility to capitalize on
the amazing support," Gould said.
