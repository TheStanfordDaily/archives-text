Marcos Diaz Gonz&lez, a senior majoring in urban
studies, recently won the Quad Award in Architectural
History for his honors thesis, "The Linear City of Ar
turo Soria y Mata."
The award, administered by Prof. Paul Turner, hon
ors "the best paper written by a Stanford undergradu
ate on a subject in architectural history." It comes with
a monetary prize worth $100.
Diaz's paper explores and documents Spanish archi
tect and urban planner Soria's vision of a linear city.
The major buildings in a city organized in this fashion
are all arranged along a single m£yor thoroughfare that
functions as a "spine of the city," said Diaz.
For example, he said, the linear placement of build
ings along Serra Mall shows signs of Soria's architec
tural ideas, although Soria's significance to the history
of modern urban planning, however, is only now being
recognized.
Faced with such a dearth of material available in
English, Diaz traveled to Spain on an Undergraduate
Research Opportunities grant to study Soria's original
writings.
Once there, he interviewed Soria's descendants and
managed to convince them to let him view their collec

tion of beautifully preserved turn-of-the-centuiy books
published by Soria and commentators about the linear
city.
Diaz was the first person to translate much of Soria's
original work into English. One of these translations,
in which Soria proposed the linear city as the ultimate
urban solution, will appear in a nine-volume antholo
gy of urban-studies writings titled, "Classic Texts in
the History of Urban Planning," due for publication
soon.
Diaz "will have helped to enlarge the whole world's
understanding of Soria, Soria's work and the history
of urban planning theory," said Frederic Stout, lectur
er in urban studies. "This is truly scholarship at its
best."
Earlier this year Diaz received the prestigious
Deans' Award for Academic Achievement, also for his
groundbreaking research on Soria and the linear city.
According to URO Director Laura Selznick, who as
sisted in selecting the recipients of the awards, "This is
an example of the excellent interdisciplinary work that
Stanford undergraduates can do — it's art, its architec
ture, its international."
The Quad Award in Architectural History is made
possible by an endowment from Eileen and Josoph
Michels.
