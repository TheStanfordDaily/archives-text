# Athletic facility to fill last space in Tresidder
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Burritos and smoothies may be
the newest arrivals at Tresidder
Union, but a proposed 2,930-square
foot recreation center will be the next
— and even more visible — step in
the effort to make Tresidder the so
cial center of campus.
The vacant space created by Pulse
Copy moving one door over in May
will leave enough room for the place
ment of an athletic center, said se-

nior Kevin Barenblat, chair of the Tresidder Advisory
Board.
"The actual floor plan hasn't been worked out,'"
Barenblat said. "But it will be run by the Athletic De
partment and open to everyone — students, faculty
and staff." Use of the facilities will be free.
On April 17, the advisory board, which includes
students, faculty and staff, presented a proposal to
Dean of Students Marc Wais addressing a perceived
desire within the community to increase facilities
available to recreational athletes.
Those who use the Ford Center, Arrillaga Family
Sports Center and Roble Gym facilities often com
plain of lack of space and faulty equipment. In addi
tion to this, gyms are open mainly for Stanford team
athletes during prime hours.
Sophomore Rebecca Wahl, a self-described recre
ational athlete, said, "The concept is a good idea, be
cause the Ford Center is always crowded and Arrilla
ga has weird hours. But it's a bizarre place to put it —
the Coffee House, Polio's and a gym."
However, plans are still in the making. "We've al
ready met with officials from the Athletics Depart
ment," Wais said. "Cheryl Levick (the senior associate

director of athletics) and I will be calling on students
throughout the campus community to provide us with
input as to the design of this proposed fitness center."
Wais said the proposal includes three major areas.
The first will be a cardiovascular fitness area with
equipment such as Stair Masters and Lifecycles. A sec
ond area will focus on weight training and stock nu
merous Nautilus machines. The third will be reserved
as a separate space for activities such as aerobics.
While the combination of facilities may be unusual
compared to other college unions full of restaurants
and pool tables, "the goal is to build community feel
ing, increase traffic in the building and make Tresid
der the hub of activity on campus," Wais explained.
Wais said the proposal must still undergo a thor
ough review and approval process before funding can
be determined and the actual equipment purchased.
But the plan is to have the empty space occupied by
the first day of fall quarter classes.
"We're very excited about this idea," Wais said. "I
think it achieves a lot of benefits by helping to address
the concern some have of limited facilities and access
to those facilities."
Barenblat agreed, adding, "This may not be a solu
tion to the lack of student recreational facilities on
campus, but it's a step in the right direction."
Law student Melissa Bianchi echoed Barenblat's
sentiments. Bianchi, who often uses the existing ath
letic centers on campus, said, "We have good facilities
already but not in terms of aerobics and space for non
varsity athletes. I n Tresidder, it wil 1 certainly be a cen
tral location, and I can't imagine it not being well
used."
Those working on the project highly anticipate
Tresidder's next service. "We've been working for
three years trying to get it fully occupied with ten
ants," Barenblat said. "We hope everyone is as excited
about its new face as we are."
