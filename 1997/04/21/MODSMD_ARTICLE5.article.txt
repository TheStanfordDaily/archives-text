# Oxford votes not counted
## Miscommunication could have altered presidential race 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
A miscommunication between the ASSU elections
committee and officials at Stanford in Oxford prevented
about 53 students from voting in the spring general
election last week, a move that could have altered the re
sults of the ASSU presidential race.
Presidential candidate Emily Andrus and her run
ning mate, Ben Decker, won 50.1 percent of the vote in
Thursday's election, avoiding a runoff by just two votes,
said Elections Commissioner Ghazal Badiozamani, a
junior.
The final tally, however, did not include ballots from
students at the University's Oxford campus. Despite
questions that surround the decision, runnerup candi
dates Jim Finsten and Howard Loo have chosen not to
challenge the election.
The elections committee voted at 2 a.m. Friday not to
accept Oxford's ballots — which were due to be cast Fri
day after students returned from a field trip — because
the committee members felt that counting them would
violate the ASSU Constitution.
According to Badiozamani, confusion over the Ox
ford ballots began last Monday, when a student at the
Oxford campus e-mailed her to request absentee ballots.
Badiozamani said the message explained that students
would be on a field trip Wednesday and Thursday and
would be unable to vote nt the regular time.
Badiozamani was unable to grant the request then;

the ballot was not finalized, as the ASSU Senate had yet
to decide whether or not to put the proposed Stanford
Judicial Charter before voters. Instead, Badiozamani
said she agreed to open an Oxford-only online votingsite
Friday.
"The number of Oxford voters was so small that I
didn't think I their votes) would make a difference," Ba
diozamani said.
As votes came in on election night, however, Ba
diozamani realized that the Oxford votes could likely
make a difference in the presidential race. She also real
ized, she said, that opening the polls a day late in Oxford
would violate the ASSU Constitution.
The polls closed at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, and a few
hours later, Badiozamani said, she convened the elec
tions committee, which is made up of four students: Ba
diozamani and sophomores Shannon Pierce, Stephen
Chien and Marcella White. At that meeting, the com
mittee decided that Badiozamani's promise of a third
day of balloting would violate Article 2, Section 2.A. 1,
which states that the general election "shall Ik; held on
two consecutive weekdays during the second, third, or
fourth week of spring quarter."
"We decided that any votes cast hy those student
wouldn't be counted," Badiozamani said, noting that
preliminary election results would have been made pub
lic on Friday. "They wouldn't have been correct votes."
Senior Jim Finsten, who finished second in the
presidential race, was disappointed by the committee's
decision.
"We were very, very saddened
and upset by the way the Oxford sit
uation unfurled," he said. "I think
that it is just tragic that a mistake
was made.. .that clearly influenced
the results of the election."
Senior Howard Loo, the presi
dential candidate who finished in
third place, expressed uncertainty
over the Oxford situation. The
ASSU Constitution can be inter
preted many different ways, he said,
but "from that one provision, it
seems like they were justified in not
counting the Oxford ballots."
President-elect Emily Andrus, a

junior, said she thinks the candi
dates are obliged to respect the rul
ing made by the Elections Commis
sion. "The Elections Commission
er is under tremendous pressure.
She made the best decision given
the circumstances, taking into con
sideration the interests of this cam
pus.
Finsten said he will not contest
the election when the senate votes
to validate the results this week.
According to the ASSU Bylaws,
the senate can choose not to validate
parts of an election "should circum
stances warrant." In other words,
the senate could validate all parts of
the election except the presidential
race.
The senate also is required to cer
tify the election results at the meet
ing following validation.
