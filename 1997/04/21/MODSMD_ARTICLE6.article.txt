# Rape Awareness Week marred by vandalism
## Event represents disurbing trend 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
Continuing a recent trend of
vandalism on campus, the
Clothesline Project was defaced
with the feces of an unidentified
animal last week.
The project — which consisted
of 50 shirts decorated in February
by survivors and victims of sexual
assault and their friends — was on
display in White Plaza as part of
Rape Awareness Week, an event
sponsored by the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault.
The group in charge of the pro
ject left it on Thursday evening
and found about five of the shirts
smeared with "large clumps of
feces" when they returned the
next morning, according to sopho
more Marian Hammond, a coali
tion member.
The defaced shirts were then
moved to the Survivor's Art Pro
ject, another display in White

Plaza that was part of Rape
Awareness Week.
"We moved them (instead of re
moving them altogether) because
we wanted to address what had
been done," Hammond said. At
the same time, those overseeing
the project wanted to "separate
them from the message of the
shirts" remaining on the clothes
line, said Hammond.
Sophomore Cathy Rion, volun

teer coordinator at the Women's
Center, said, "It was really dis
turbing that (the vandals! didn't
even have respect for our thoughts
on sexual assault."
The project has several purpos
es: First, it was meant to bear wit
ness to survivors and others af
fected by sexualiz.ed and relation
ship violence and second, to ease
the healing process of survivors
and those who have lost partners,

family members and friends. The
display was also meant to educate
people about assault and show its
impact on Stanford's community.
Other goals included the pro
motion of peace and equality in re
lationships and the creation of a
zero tolerance atmosphere at
Stanford when it comes to as
sault, harassment and sexism.
