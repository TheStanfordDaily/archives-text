"No one has done more to improve the image of women in the media than Jean
Kilbourne."
—Elaine LeGaro, in presenting Dr. Kilbourne the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists' Women's Image Now (WIN) award
"Hearing Jean Kilbourne is a profound experience. Audiences leave her feeling that they
have heard much more than another lecture, for she teaches them to see themselves and
their world differently."
—Carole Beebe Tarantelli, member of the Italian Parliament
"The importance of your research has not been lost on the Harvard Business School
students...The entire presentation will stand out as a highlight of our education here."
—From a letter from several Harvard Business School students
"After listening to Jean Kilbourne, I would never doubt her intellectual honesty. While
she bills herself as a critic of advertising, she is more akin to a prophet calling out in the
wilderness for fundamental change in the way we communicate publicly with one an
other."
—From an AdWeek editorial
