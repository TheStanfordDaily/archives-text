## Award and survey online to reach graduate students 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate's Committee
on Academics, Research and Eval
uation has spent April advancing
two online-based initiatives: the

ASSU's annual
teaching award
and a survey on
graduate student
life.
The teaching
award, in its sec
ond year, is the
only such honor
administered en
tirely by students.
Members of

the committee will read and evalu
ate all the nominations in May, said
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson, the
committee chair.
"We'll be looking for people who
are doing really exceptional things.
We need more than, 'This person is
really nice and gives neat assign
ments,' " Natelson added.
Last year, the award's $500
cash prize went to Asst. Physics
Prof. Charles Marcus. This year's
award will be presented at a cere
mony in June.
Natelson, however, has longer
term plans for the graduate stu
dent survey, the first such online
survey ever commissioned.
"A lot of people have expressed
interested in the survey data,"
which spans multiple aspects of
graduate student life, Natelson
said.
He mentioned that Assoc. Dean
of Graduate Policy Tom Wasow is
interested in the data on graduate
compensation.
"There are indications of pay
disparities," said Natelson, a
physics doctoral student. "Things
are not necessarily dictated by who
you work for and what you do but
by what department you're in."
Survey data will also be collect
ed on graduate attitudes toward
their academic environment,
housing and the University com
munity.
"There are some questions
about how well academically the
grad students are being taken care
of," Natelson said.
In fact, the idea for the survey
stemmed from the ASSU Course
Guide for undergraduates.
"A member of our committee
jokingly suggested that we should
put out a guide to graduate advis
ers," Natelson said. "Although we
knew that idea wasn't very con
structive, we saw an opportunity to
collect general information on the
quality of graduate life at Stan
ford."
The survey allows graduate stu
dents to respond to issues ranging
from required course work to the
Bursar's Office to parking. Respon-


Natelson
dents will also be entered in a draw
ing for a $50 gift certificate for the
Stanford Store.
The final data will be compiled,
summarized and presented to the
ASSU Senate, Wasow and other
University administrators by the
end of the quarter, Natelson said.
Both surveys can be accessed
until May 1 at http://www
