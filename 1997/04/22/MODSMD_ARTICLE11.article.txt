## Saddam orders Iraqi helicopters into no-fly zone U.S. says it will 'respond appropriately' to Hussein's decision to assist religious pilgrims

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam
Hussein ordered his helicopters into the
U.S.-patrolled no-fly zone yesterday, say
ing he intended to fly home weary Iraqi
pilgrims returning from Mecca. Oil prices
rose because of worries about possible
disruptions in oil supplies if the United
States retaliated.
Any U.S. action threatening the air
craft or the pilgrims "will be met with the
suitable response to deter aggression,"
the state-run Iraqi News Agency warned.
The United States urged Iraq to stay
out of the no-fly zone or face unspecified
retaliation. "We will respond appropri
ately, but we're not going to shoot down
civilian helicopters," presidential press
secretary Mike McCurry said.
On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, crude oil for May delivery rose

47 cents to $20.38 a barrel. Analyst Ger
ald E. Samuels at ARB Oil Inc. said any
conflict is unlikely to seriously disrupt
the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, but
investors are taking no chances.
Western allies set up the no-fly zone
after defeating Iraq in the 1991 Gulf
War. Western forces patrol the skies over
southern Iraq to protect the people there
from Iraqi reprisals for a failed rebellion.
The zone was extended in September
to punish Saddam for sending his army
into northern Iraq to support one Kur
dish faction against another. It now cov
ers an area stretching from the southern
suburbs of Baghdad down to Iraq's bor
ders with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
The Iraqi News Agency said the heli
copters would begin ferrying "sick and
exhausted" Muslim pilgrims from the

Iraqi-Saudi border yesterday. It did not
say how many aircraft would be involved
or give the number of the pilgrims. Pre
sumably, the flights would be on military
helicopters.
By nightfall, there was no word on
whether any flights had taken place.
The decision to use helicopters to ferry
home the pilgrims was announced after a
meeting yesterday of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the leadership of
the ruling Baath Party — Iraq's highest
bodies. Saddam chaired the meeting.
On April 9, Saddam sent an Iraqi Air
ways jet carrying 104 pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia for the pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi
Arabia, site of the holiest shrine in Islam.
The flight defied a U.N. ban on (lights
in and out of Iraq — one of a broad set of
sanctions imposed in 1990 for Iraq's

invasion of Kuwait. The helicopter
flights would violate the sanctions as
well.
"If they truly are interested in the wel
fare of the Muslim pilgrims and if they're
not just trying to score cheap political
points, they will go to the (U.N.) sanc
tions committee and ask for an exemp
tion," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said in Washington.
"And we believe the United Nations
exemption committee would probably
give such an exemption," he added.
The United States failed to persuade
the U.N. Security Council to condemn the
April 9 Iraqi flight as a violation of the
sanctions, settling instead for a mild
rebuke. The council's response was a diplo
matic embarrassment for Washington.
Yesterday's announcement is the lat

est of several attempts by the Iraqi lead
ership to test the resolve of the interna
tional community, particularly the Unit
ed States, to maintain Iraq's isolation
under the 1990 U.N. sanctions.
In addition to extending the no-fly
zone, the United States fired missiles at
Iraqi military targets in September to
punish Saddam for sending his army into
Kurdish areas, where Gulf War allies also
enforce a no-fly zone.
The sanctions are to be lifted only
when U.N. war monitors are satisfied
that Iraq destroyed its weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles.
Rolf Ekeus, the chief U.N. arms moni
tor, said in remarks published Sunday
that Iraq appeared determined to keep its
ability to produce weapons of mass
destruction.
