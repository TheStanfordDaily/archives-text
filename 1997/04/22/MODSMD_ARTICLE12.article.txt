# Record floods continue
## Lack of fresh water causes major problems in Midwest

GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) - With a record
flood filling most of the city with fdthy water, city
officials said yesterday they were considering string
ing a hose up to 22 miles across the prairie to bring
in clean water so people could at least wash their
hands.
"What people take for granted day to day, like
taking a shower and washing clothes, isn't going to
happen for quite a while," said National Guard Capt.
Greg Bowen. "The sanitary conditions arc primitive
at best."
The Red River that had flooded 75 percent of the
city also shut down the municipal water treatment
plant, and there was no water service for the esti
mated 10 percent of the city's 50,000 inhabitants
who hadn't left yet.
"The toilet part is the worst," said Richard
George. "We just flush it with melted snow. We were
melting snow on the barbecue grill."
Portable bathrooms and drinking water stations
were scattered throughout the city's still-dry
extreme west end.
In public and motel restrooms, the stench built
up until crews could periodically come by with flush
ing water.
The city also supplied most of the water for
Grand Forks Air Force Base, where more than 2,000
of the city's refugees were staying.
The base still had a reserve of clean water, was
pumping some water from a nearby small town and
planned to bring in 20 large tanker trucks, said a
spokesman, Gapt. Byron Spencer.
In the meantime, he said: "We're asking people
not to use the washing machine, limit their shower

usage, things like that."
President Clinton planned to fly over the flooded
area and visit the Air Force base today, the White
Mouse said.
City officials held a meeting yesterday afternoon
to discuss the proposal for a long water pipeline.
The city water treatment plant and sewer system
are expected to be flooded for weeks, and Bowen said
the temporary hose or pipeline also could be used to
speed up the process of restoring service once the
flood ebbs.
The city uses about 8 million gallons of water a
day.
The hose, probably about (> inches in diameter,
would be made of a rubber-like material with
enough flexibility to conform to the contour of the
land, officials said.
However, there were no decisions yet on where
the pipeline would be placed or even exactly where
the water would come from.
Across the river in East Grand Forks, Minn.,
Mayor Lynn Stauss said his city of 9,000 was "basi
cally covered all the way."
"Some of the homes are floating off their founda
tions," he said.
Upstream at Fargo, N. 1)., however, the water was
beginning to recede.
There have been minor problems with several
dikes, "but for the most part, things are holding
together," said Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness.
North Dakota Gov. Fd Schafer said the cleanup
alone would easily cost more than $40 million. And
Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the cost of repairs
could exceed $1 billion.

Downtown Grand Forks, N.D., is covered in water, due to continued flooding of the Red River, which is
25 feet over flood level. At least 13 downtown buildings sustained fire damage when firefighters could
not control a blaze due to the flood waters.
