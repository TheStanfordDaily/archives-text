Court won't hear discrimination case
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an action hailed as a victory for sexual
equality, the Supreme Court refused to free Brown University of rul
ings that the Ivy League school discriminated against female ath
letes.
Although yesterday's court action is not a decision and therefore
sets no legal precedent for other universities and colleges, the practi
cal effect may be enormous.
"I think the message that goes across the entire country today is
that those who have been dragging their feet are duly warned that the
time is now," said Christine Grant, athletic director for women's
sports at the University of lowa. "It's a very clear message and long,
long overdue."
Lawyers for Brown had argued that lower court rulings in its case
could require schools nationwide to offer varsity opportunities for
women based on "a stark numerical quota."

Those courts had ruled that Brown violated a 1972 law known as
Title IX.
The law, credited hy many with changing the face of women's
sports and influencing society's attitudes about women, bans dis
crimination in education based on sex. All government-run schools
and private schools that receive federal money are covered by the law.
Even before learning of the high court's denial of review, Brown
officials yesterday submitted forafederal trial judge's approval apian
for complying with Title IX.
Democrat questions contribution
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate's investigation into campaign
finance abuse should look into Republican assistance to a Japanese-
American businessman who contributed $500,000 to the party, a key
Democrat said yesterday.
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Michael Kojima should be a focus of

the investigation because a Republican campaign official in 1992
wrote Japan's prime minister on his behalf after he pledged $500,000
to the party.
The donation embarrassed Republicans when it was learned Koji
ma had large unpaid debts and failed to make child-support pay
ments.
Kojima, president of a Los Angeles company, got a seat near
then-President Hush at a Republican dinner for his large contribu
tion.
Levin handed out a March 9, 1992, letter from a Republican Party
official to then-Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on Koji
ma's behalf. The letter's author, Lisa DeGrandi, was head of the
Presidential Roundtable — a GOP senatorial campaign group for
major party contributors.
The Senate has approved an investigation into political fund-rais
ing problems in both parties, and Levin is trying to ensure that the
bipartisan scope turns into reality when hearings begin.
