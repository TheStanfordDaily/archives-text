Results of ASSU election
must stay in place for the
sake of the student voters

WHEN THE ASSU Senate
decides tonight whether to
validate last week's elec
tion in light of the fact that 53
Stanford in Oxford students were
not able to vote, the governing body
should take a hint from another
formidable English group: Let it be.
Although the disenfranchise
ment of any portion of the Stan
ford student body is reprehensible,
the senate should not ride this
issue all the way to another elec
tion but rather let the results from
last week stand as they are. Anoth
er election could, in fact, cause a
run-off in the presidential race,
but the interests of the entire Uni
versity would best be served if the
total number of 1997 ASSU elec
tions remains at one.
The decision to deny the Oxford
students the opportunity to vote
was not merely the result of mis
communication, as ASSU officials
will have you believe. Rather, it also
resulted from a general ignorance
of the ASSU Constitution and a
hefty dose of poor decision making
on the part of both the Elections
Commission and the senate.
The trouble started when
Oxford students requested absen
tee ballots from Elections Commis
sioner Ghazal Badiozamani, who
couldn't grant the request because
the ballot was not yet finalized.
Then, once a decision to let the
Oxford students vote after the on
campus polls closed was found to
be unconstitutional, the Elections
Commission declared that the
Oxford students would not have an
electoral voice this year.
These actions were marred on
three fronts. First of all, Badioza
mani initially said the Oxford
votes would make little difference
in the outcome of the election. No

official, even the elections commis
sioner, has the right to decide
which groups of students will
make a difference in the election
— every group makes a difference.
Second, the ASSU Constitution
guarantees every student the right
to vote in a campus-wide election,
something of which the Elections
Commission was obviously
unaware. And third, the senate, in
its failure to approve a final ballot
earlier than two days before the
election, did not give the Elections
Commission enough time to
ensure everyone's right to vote.
However, despite these trans
gressions, the senate should not
make another error by refusing to
validate the election. Granted, the
constitution was not followed to
the letter, yet the integrity of the
election, which ran fairly smoothly
except for these oversights, was
not wholly violated.
True, the presidential race —
which was won by Emily Andrus
with only two votes over the 50-
percent barrier needed for victory
— could be forced into a run-off
with a new election. Yet, it's
important to remember that
Andrus won the election by 25
percent of the total votes. It's
questionable whether a run-off
would, in any way, alter the out
come of this election. Even the
presidential runners-up are not
challenging the election.
On the other hand, another elec
tion could jeopardize the rest of the
electoral process. Second elections
consistently draw fewer students to
the polls, and without a consider
able number of voters, the special
fee groups would be in danger of
losing their funding. And on a more
superficial level, another election
would make the entire ASSU seem
particularly ridiculous in adminis
tration and student eyes.
Tonight, the senate will have
the choice of either focusing
myopically on procedural minutiae
or upholding an otherwise success
ful election. For everyone's sake,
let's hope they choose the latter.
