## Bring me a higher being 
### 
I BELIEVE THAT Ralph Reed is the
Anti-Christ.
I believe that if a truly omnipo
tent spiritual force or figure exists, She
would not have created me with the
need to worship Her.
I believe that I will never baptize my
baby as if he somehow possesses origi
nal sin of which he needs to be cleansed.
I believe that someday I will look into
a woman's eyes and see straight into
her soul.
A few months ago, this space was
filled with another columnist's lament
of the prevalence and irrationality of
atheists on the Stanford campus. He
suggested that "atheists should kill
themselves," for without a belief in
God, there could be no purpose to their
lives. He wanted to save us from Our
ignorance.
Those were the words of a dema
gogue, and I don't take them seriously.
However, I was reminded of a nag
ging concern I have had about the aver
age pious person's perception of athe
ists. Some people often equate atheism
with a lack of spirituality or an absence
of awe and humility toward the world
around us. They consider someone like
me to be flawed because I don't place
my faith in a higher being.
They think that I don't really believe
anything.
Growing up it was sometimes diffi
cult to cope with the well-meaning con

descension that came from my religious
peers. I was born the son of a Unitarian
minister and a Hindu mother, which
means I was given a tremendous
amount of freedom to develop my
beliefs and explore various religions,
philosophies and modes of thought
throughout my childhood and adoles
cence.
My friends would laugh at my multi
denominational confusion, and they
scoffed at my lack of dogma, as if by sac
rificing orthodoxy I gained only igno
rance.
It's true; it is difficult for me to give
my Christian friends a simple thumb
nail sketch of my belief system. I tell
them about my inspirations, but they
get offended when I compare the Ser
mon on the Mount to Walden. I can only
hope that they will observe my actions
and use my intentions to form their per
ception of me.
I want so badly to be a theist. Theism
is easy. It provides one with an instant
community of people ostensibly linked
by a common code and life focus. It
assuages fears of dying and rationalizes
suffering so that we can deal with the
massive world around us. It explains
away uncertainty and brings order from
the chaos.
I want to feel like I have found the
ultimate answer â€” what an amazing,
powerful experience that would be.
But I haven't reached that point.

Instead, I revel in the natural beauty
I see around me every day. I search for
the many heavens on earth, and I find
my mouth agape every time I watch the
sun set.
I worship the benevolent acts of my
community, and I pray to the people
closest to me that they will help me find
my way to spiritual fulfillment.
I hope that someday I will find the
solution to my confusion and uncertain
ty. But until then I invite people to join
me in exploring our sets of beliefs with
each other and ask ourselves what a
person must believe to earn our true
respect.
I don't need to be saved from any
thing.
Judge me and my rationality, if you
must. And ask yourself why my spiritu
ality and my beliefs are worse than
yours.
I believe that we save ourselves and
each other.
I believe in the Holy Trinity of won
der, empathy and passion.
I believe.

Rahul Young, a senior majoring in pub
lic policy, will spend Sunday worship
ping at the Church of St. John Coltrane
in San Francisco. He expects it to be a
truly religious experience.
