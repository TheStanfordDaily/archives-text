Elections commissioner's attitude is inexecusable

HAVING BEEN AT Stanford for
four years now, I didn't think
that my opinion of the ASSU
could sink any lower. But that was
before I read the story of the disqualifi
cation of the Stanford in Oxford stu
dents' votes.
The fact that a mistake was made is
not so hard to understand; after all, the
election process is complicated and there
was no clear solution to the Oxford stu
dents' dilemma. What is truly reprehen
sible is the attitude of the elections com
missioner, Ghazal Badiozamani, which

led directly to the confusion.
Even the fact that Badiozamani vio
lated the ASSU Constitution (or rather,
was ignorant of it) is not so surprising;
we've come to expect no less from the
ASSU. But Badiozamani justified her
actions by stating that "the number of
Oxford voters was so small that I didn't
think [their votes] would make a differ
ence. "
Even for someone accustomed to
ASSU-think, this statement is shocking
Basically, the elections commissioner
decided not to worry about the Oxford

votes because she thought they would be
irrelevant. The fact that someone with
this attitude was appointed elections
commissioner is beyond belief.
The elections commissioner's job is to
ensure that students' votes are properly
recorded. Badiozamani's incompetence in
attempting to allow the Oxford students
to vote is unfortunate but excusable; her
cavalier attitude toward their votes is not
excusable. What if Badiozamani had
decided that the votes from students in
Kimball Hall wouldn't make a difference
and didn't bother to count them?

The handling of the problem after
the fact has been as fair as can be
expected. Constitutionally, the votes
must be disallowed. Again, this is
unfortunate but excusable. At the very
least, however, Badiozamani owes an
apology to the candidates and to the
students whose votes "didn't make a
difference." She deserves censure for
encouraging voter apathy and for her
inexcusable attitude toward the voting
process.
