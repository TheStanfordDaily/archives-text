# Recent vandalism has strengthened one victim's resolve
## 
### 
Mine was one of the T-shirts on dis
play as part of the Coalition Against Sex
ual Assault's Clothesline Project, which
was vandalized last week. This was actu
ally the first real threat I've ever felt to
my beliefs. And even though this was
anonymous and probably not directed at
me personally, 1 took it personally.
It may seem odd to some people that as
a woman — and a bisexual woman at that
— I have never come across any direct dis
crimination but I live in a pretty tolerant
society (tolerant because I'm white, mid
dle-class and relatively closeted). I guess
this is whv seeing mv T-shirt defaced with

feces hit me so hard; I became aware (not
necessarily for the first time) how false a
lot of that tolerance is.
I wrote on my T-shirt that I had more
than two cents to put in because I had
been saving up for so long. Perhaps the
vandals hoped to turn me back into an
unbreakable piggy bank, but it's too late
for that. My silence has already been
shattered. Their ignorance and cow
ardice has just made me see that I have
to shout all that much louder.
I realize this is starting to sound like a
broken record. There's an instance of van
dalism, then a story in The Daily or an
angry letter from the assaulted, and then
it happens again. Hopefully, this repetition
is far from numbing because I think that
until we're heard — and, more important,
understood — we can't let even the small
est incident pass by unnoticed.
Maybe one good thing has come of

this. It has inspired me to tell people my
thoughts in a much more direct format
than an anonymous T-shirt. Speak out
now — silence no longer!
