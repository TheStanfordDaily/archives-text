# IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE
## Hum Bio students travel to Peru to study conservation 
### Susan Bradford 
Pink dolphins, black water
and a sea of trees can all be found
amid the natural beauty of
Peru's Amazon Rain forest.
A call to visit these natural
wonders brought together 14
Stanford students, alumni and
friends last November. Led by
Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
Stanford's 1996 Amazon Field
Seminar visited the Amazon
Biosphere Preserve and the sur
rounding communities nestled
along the Napo River, a tributary
of the mighty Amazon.
A main highlight of the
group's trip was experiencing the
hanging canopy walkway at the
Amazon Center for Environmen
tal Education and Research.
Walking amid the lush treetops
in a hammock-like structure,
students and alumni viewed a
stretch of rain forest that spans
from the Andes to the Atlantic
coast of South America — cover

ing an area the size of the United
States.
Up in the treetops, toucans,
tree frogs and brilliant bromeli
ads abound. From the highest
platform, the scarlet fires of the
Amazonian sunset can be seen
setting over the sea of green tree
tops. Senior Chris Carlson de
scribed his experience as amaz
ing. "Standing on the walkway
120 feet above the ground at sun
set looking out into Brazil from
Peru — it was a spiritual mo
ment," he said.
The Stanford group traveled
to the Amazon to do more than
observe nature's wonders. Par
ticipating in Durham's course on
conservation and community de
velopment, students, alumni and
friends combined visiting nature
with studying the potential for
conservation of the Amazon rain
forest through community-based
development initiatives.

Students traveled lo Peru last November on Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham's 1996 Amazon field
seminar.
Each night after eco-touring, the
Stanford travelers broke into small
groups to discuss potential ways to
conserve the Amazon. Group dis
cussions largely focused on sus
tainable development with empha
sis on the Integrated Conservation
Development Project model. The
project model focuses on conserv
ing nature by offering local peoples
sustainable and economically vi
able ways to achieve the economic
development they need. Alterna
tives like agroforestiy, the collec
tion of nontraditional forest prod
ucts such as oils and resins for out
lets like the Body Shop and sus
tainable community-based timber

production were all explored in
group discussions.
These nightly discussions
broadened many travelers' views
of conservation efforts. To some
the word conservation had always
implied the preservationist style of
conservation found within the
United States. America's national
park system operates in terms of
fence it off and protect it. Yet in
areas where people depend upon
the land for their daily means, as is
the case in much of the developing
world, the preservationist "push
the people out" system is not a vi
able solution.
Junior Robyn Nordstrom said,
"Before taking 'Conservation and
Community Development,' I be
lieved that straight preservation
was the best way to deal with the
Amazonian rain forest. However,

seeing the open air houses of the
riverinos living along the river
banks reminded me to consider the
human implications of such a
stance. Any project that hopes to
have a chance a success will need to
address the economic needs and
concerns of these people."
This realization is especially
critical in areas like the Amazon
where nearly every acre has been
claimed as homeland to indigenous
peoples. How these people living in
the rain forest choose to use their
land determines what becomes of
it in the future. After discussing
such issues in the nightly group
meetings, many students were
prompted to talk to the locals
about the recent changes and con
cerns.
In the group's visit to the town
of Manitee to meet schoolchildren,
junior Julia Bryson, a human biol
ogy major, spoke with a grand
mother. Bryson said that as she
cradled her baby granddaughter in
her arms, the woman told her
about "the changes in the area
over the last few years." The
changes she mentioned included
"rising hunger due to over fishing
and over hunting of the land, as
well as a growing desire among the

young people to move to the city
where they think life will be easi-
t$
er.
Bryson worried that the migra
tion to the city, Iquitos, could allow
the large-scale timber companies
to gain access to the area. She sug
gested that "efforts to involve the
local people in a community-based
development projects like rotation
al agriculture may be an effective
way to provide the incentives for
the local people to inhabit and pro
tect the forest."
One recent Stanford graduate is
already working on these issues.
Haley Mitchell, who graduated in
1996 with a bachelor's in anthro
pology, is working on a proposal for
an integrated conservation devel
opment project with two groups of
indigenous people in north eastern
Brazil, includingthe Tembe people
of Para and the Ka'apor people of
Marahao.
She said she hopes to help the
neighboring people overcome log
ging companies' pressure to cut
down old growth forests by work
ing with the local people to find a
viable alternative that earns them
the money they need to support
their traditional ways of life,
Mitchell said.
