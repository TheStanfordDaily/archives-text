# IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE
## Hum Bio students travel to Peru to study conservation

Pink dolphins, black water
and a sea of trees can all be found
amid the natural beauty of
Peru's Amazon Rain forest.
A call to visit these natural
wonders brought together 14
Stanford students, alumni and
friends last November. Led by
Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
Stanford's 1996 Amazon Field
Seminar visited the Amazon
Biosphere Preserve and the sur
rounding communities nestled
along the Napo River, a tributary
of the mighty Amazon.
A main highlight of the
group's trip was experiencing the
hanging canopy walkway at the
Amazon Center for Environmen
tal Education and Research.
Walking amid the lush treetops
in a hammock-like structure,
students and alumni viewed a
stretch of rain forest that spans
from the Andes to the Atlantic
coast of South America — cover

ing an area the size of the United
States.
Up in the treetops, toucans,
tree frogs and brilliant bromeli
ads abound. From the highest
platform, the scarlet fires of the
Amazonian sunset can be seen
setting over the sea of green tree
tops. Senior Chris Carlson de
scribed his experience as amaz
ing. "Standing on the walkway
120 feet above the ground at sun
set looking out into Brazil from
Peru — it was a spiritual mo
ment," he said.
The Stanford group traveled
to the Amazon to do more than
observe nature's wonders. Par
ticipating in Durham's course on
conservation and community de
velopment, students, alumni and
friends combined visiting nature
with studying the potential for
conservation of the Amazon rain
forest through community-based
development initiatives.
