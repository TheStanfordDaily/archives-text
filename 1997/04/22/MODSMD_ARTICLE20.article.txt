# Contemporary events in Israel should not he put in Biblical context
## 
### 
I found Victor Wishna's piece yester
day very irritating, particularly in that it
follows a naive, well-worn and above all
American editorial tradition. (A.M.
Rosenthal would be proud.) Placing mod
ern occurrences in Israel in a Biblical con
text may be OK for heated sentimental

arguments in back rooms, but when dis
guised as some sort of serious journalistic
observation, it comes across as puerile.
It is horrible that a suicide bomber
killed three people in a Tel Aviv cafe.
And perhaps the decision of the Jewish
community not to cancel Purim festivi
ties could be seen as perseverance in the
face of extreme adversity, which is what
VVishna seems to be saying. This type of
perseverance, however, strikes me as a
rather "soft" variety, perhaps akin to
that of a white guy from Beverly Hills
who, undeterred, decides to play golf the
day after the L.A. riots.
The real perseverance, in my mind, is
that of the Palestinians, who are under
going a persecution that is very real, and
quite "Biblical" in character, at the
hands of an immense military power.
