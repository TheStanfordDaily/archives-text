# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## Reflections on elections: Who has the right to choose? 
### 
Everyone on this campus who
has not been locked, Rapunzel-like,
in their dorm rooms for the past few
weeks is well aware that Thursday and Fri
day saw the annual ASSU election.
For most it's a matter of trifling con
cern. Even for those students who bother
to vote (and most don't), it's a question of
which potential senators have the catchi
est names and which groups asking for
special fees have the slickest fliers.
The questions on most students' minds:
Will Matt Spence really deliver the Domi
no's pizza? Is there a man who can, in fact,
do it better than Khan can? And what's up
with that triangle — are Emily and Ben
gay? (Not, in the immortal words of
Messrs. Seinfeld and Costanza, that
there's anything wrong with that.)
There are some of us, though, for whom
the questions at election time are a lot
deeper and taken much more seriously.
For the candidates, obviously, that's the
case. For the sponsors of constitutional
amendments and other similar measures
that's the case. And, most notably, for
leaders of the various groups seeking spe
cial fees, that's the case.
What may take many people by sur
prise, though, is that there are a group of
us here at The Daily who take the election
tremendously seriously. I don't particular
ly want to get into the news coverage; I

want to stick with the area I know: The
Daily's endorsements.
I've now completed my second election
cycle on The Daily's Editorial Board, play
ing a role in deciding what this paper
endorses, and I can tefl you it's not a fun
experience. This year, for example, we
spent nearly 12 hours in interviews with
the presidential tickets and representa
tives of fee-seeking groups, and then we
spent another 10 hours or so making deci
sions. (I had it easier than the rest of the
board: Because I did not participate in the
presidential endorsement decision, I was
excused from a few hours of meetings.)
There were another few hours spent
drafting the endorsements' text and about
12 more hours spent on editing, laying out
and proofing that text and the final pages.
And then, of course, is the least pleasant
part: the responses.
Special-fee groups are always the most
unhappy. The presidential race, after all, is
a zero-sum game. The Daily can only
endorse one ticket, and the candidates who
don't get endorsed, even if they think we
clearly made the wrong choice, recognize
that we had to pick someone.
The special-fee system, though, is open
ended. Every fee can pass, no matter how
high that will make the following year's
ASSU fees. leaders of fee-seeking groups
would probably like it best if that happened

— the burden of a higher bill is worth tak
ing to insure against the possibility that
yours might be the group to get negged.
When The Daily endorses against a
group's request, its leaders are generally
quite upset — and not unjustifiably.
Their standard complaints about the
endorsements, though, are unjustified. I'm
only one member of the Editorial Board,
and I obviously can't speak for the other
(quite opinionated) members in justifying
what we do. But I firmly believe that The
Daily not only has the right to issue
endorsements on special-fee requests, but
in fact it has an obligation to do so.
Three students wrote a letter printed in
The Daily on Thursday of election week.
They were "incensed by The Daily's
assumption that its Editorial Board has
the knowledge, background, experience
and right to judge the work of their peers,"
and that statment concisely sums up all
the similar complaints.
The fact, though, is that we currently
have a funding system that asks students
to make a choice about each fee request.
I'm forced to wonder, then, if the students
who sit on The Daily's Editorial Board
don't have a right to make a decision about
whether a group deserves funding, who is?
Perhaps no one. But it seems to me
that's a fault with the system, not with
The Daily's endorsements.

In fact, the people who sit on the Edito
rial Board are probably among the most
qualified to make a decisions about
whether a group deserves its fee request.
Before a decision is made, the members of
the board carefully read the group's state
ment in the ASSU Elections Handbook
and examine in detail the budget the
group has submitted with its request. Few
voters, I'm sure, take the time to do that
before voting. And yet that's the only
information provided to the voter on
which to make his choice.
So if after reading those two documents
The Daily is unable to make a valid,
informed decision about a group's fee
request, then I guess that's the group's
own fault. They should have submitted
more comprehensive information — after
all, that's all the voters are getting.
The interviews that the Editorial Board
attempts to conduct with each fee-seeking
group is an opportunity for the group to
expand upon written information that
should already be complete.
The letter-writers say that "student
groups struggle to communicate their mis
sion and achievements in the 20 minutes
allowed." That's 20 minutes more than the
group will spend talking to each voting stu
dent, and it's a time that should be used to
expand upon what's already known about
the group, not simply to regurgitate it. If a

group's goals are so ill-defined that they
can't be articulated in a handbook state
ment and 20 minutes of speaking time
then, frankly, 1 don't think the group
deserves my money.
Nearly no one on campus will actually
bother to examine carefully till the materi
al that's presented to them as part of the
election process, and it is the duty of any
responsible newspaper to help distill that
information for voters. That's what The
Daily is doing in making its recommenda
tions on special-fee requests.
I don't think that groups' complaints
are really about The Daily. Rather, I think
their complaints are about a system that
requires students who often have little or
no vested interest in a given group to deter
mine that group's funding.
No one wants their group's request to
fail, and, unfortunately, that's a real possi
bility with the current funding system.
The criticism about The Daily's fee
endorsements is simply because we have
the audacity to point out that a fee's pas
sage is not inevitable.

Jesse Oxfeld, a junior majoring in commu
nication, does not necessarily cast his votes
the way The Daily tells him to.
