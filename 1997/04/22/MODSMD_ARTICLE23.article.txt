## Earth Day '97: Forests for the Future Virgin forests threatened Earth Day promotes alternatives to logging 
### Nina Chinosornvatana Contributing writer 
The theme for Earth Day '97 is
"Forests for the Future." With 97
percent of the United States' vir
gin forests destroyed, concern
over the state of the wildlife,
plant life and ecosystems in those
regions has grown tremendously.
In response, Stanford and var
ious Bay Area organizations have
proposed major initiatives such as
encouraging the public to use
alternative forms of paper.
This year's focus on forests
comes when only 2 percent of Cal
ifornia's original redwood forests
remain.
Timber companies are buying
huge tracts of land in the Santa
Cruz Mountains. Logging in this
area has quadrupled from 7 mil
lion to 27 million milled board
feet in the past 10 years. Lumber
companies have managed to work
around enforcement to strip as
much as they can off the land.
Earth Day Coalition, a group
of 40 environmental organiza
tions in the Bay Area, has advo
cated several programs to protect
trees. They hope to encourage
area businesses to use less paper,
use other paper sources and recy
cle more.
They are also advocating the
recycling of old wooden buildings
and lobbying to support the Save
America's Forests Act. This bill
will protect native biodiversity on
all federal forestlands by elimi
nating the practice of clearcutting
while promoting environmentally
compatible and economically sus
tainable logging.
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford sponsored
Earth Action, a week of environ
mentally focused activities. This
included seminars, speakers,
active clean-ups and information
sessions culminating in an Earth

Fair where organizations and
vendors were able to present their
products and knowledge. Along
with Bay Area Action, SEAS also
passed out samples of a new paper
made partly from discarded
wheat straw and waste paper.
The company selling this tree
free paper, Arbokem, is based in
California and Canada. It oper
ates a prototype mill to process
something they call "agri-pulp."
They propose to use leftover
straw from wheat, rice, corn and
grass crops as a source of pulp.
Present-day paper industries
manufacture paper by mechani
cally or chemically grinding wood,
grasses and rags into pulp, then
compressing it onto a screen and
drying it on rollers.
In contrast, when paper was
first invented in China in the first
century, a combination of hemp
and bark was used. The Earth
Day Coalition is stressing a
return back to this preparation of
paper and an expansion into
alternative pulp materials such as
kenaf, a fiber from a tropical Asi
atic plant.
Using this straw would not
only save trees but also reduce
waste, as most of the current
straw surplus is either burned or
left in fields to decompose.
"Using paper made from agri
cultural waste not only saves
trees, but also helps prevent air
pollution caused by burning these
waste products in the field," said
Bay Area Action Special Projects
Coordinator Laura Stec.
This process does not elimi
nate the need to recycle paper in
order to reduce the amount of
paper ending up in landfills.
The use of agri-pulp to pro
duce paper is not as costly as
some might think. While the
production process might cost
more than the standard wood
based one, the initial straw

material only costs a third of the
price of wood.
The market for tree-free paper
has grown as businesses become
more environmentally conscious.
Already, companies like the Gap,
Esprit and even Bank of America
have expressed interest in using
environmentally safe products.
