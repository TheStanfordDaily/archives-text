# Bioremediation boosts bacteria's natural ability to eat pollutants

Never underestimate the power
of the microbe.
Microorganisms such as yeast,
fungi and bacteria are capable of
degrading pollutants like
petroleum and chlorinated sol
vents to less toxic compounds. Sci
entists and engineers refer to
these biological cleaning processes
as bioremediation or natural
attenuation.
Studies at Superfund sites —
the most heavily polluted areas —
indicate that this process is of con
siderable environmental and eco
nomic importance.
Shortly after midnight on
March 24, 1989, the largest tanker
spill in U.S. history occurred when
the Exxon Valdez ran aground on
Bligh Reef in Prince William
Sound, Alaska, and spilled almost
11 million gallons of crude oil, con
taminating 1,200 miles of shore
line and 3,000 square miles of
ocean water.
In the initial six-month clean
up, Exxon spent more than $1 bil

lion and 17 million personnel
hours to return the beaches to an
environmentally stable condition.
In the process, they discovered
that traditional mechanical clean
ing methods such as rock-washing
were not successful in many areas
and caused further damage to the
environment.
Searching for alternatives,
Exxon tested bioremediation, rely
ing on naturally present microor
ganisms to degrade the oil to car
bon dioxide and water.
To stimulate growth of the oil
eating microorganisms, the con
taminated area was spray eel with
fertilizers rich in nitrogen and
phosphorous. Within two weeks of
applying the fertilizers, 70 percent
of the oil was degraded and the
rest disappeared within the next
two weeks.
Bioremediation was much
more efficient than rock washing
machines. It was also significantly
cheaper.
Large spills like the one from
the Exxon Valdez are ecologically
devastating and their cleanup

costs staggering, but leaking
underground fuel tanks may pose
a much bigger threat to the envi
ronment.
In 1986, the Environmental
Protection Agency estimated that
35 percent of the nation's 2 mil
lion fuel storage tanks were leak
ing, contaminating the soil and
ground water adjacent to the
tanks with a mixture of toxic
petroleum products.
"That corresponds to one in
three gas stations on El Camino
Real. It is a bigger problem than
the contamination at a Superfund
site," said Asst. Civil Engineering
Prof. Alfred Spormann.
For Spormann, the solution is
to adopt an interdisciplinary
approach, drawing on expertise
from areas as disparate as engi
neering and microbial physiology.
To further collaboration among
researchers interested in ground
water bioremediation, McCarty
founded the Western Region Haz
ardous Substance Center in 1989.
This center, one of five nation
ally supported by the EPA,

includes scientists from Stanford
and Oregon State University.
Their goal is to use information
gained from laboratory and con
trolled field studies to improve the
cleanup of contaminated aquifers.
Although bioremediation has
been observed at many contami
nated sites, researchers do not
sufficiently understand the pro
cess to forecast the time required
for a cleanup. Many variables
affect the rate and extent of the
attenuation at a given site, includ
ing the quantity and toxicity of
the contaminants, the site condi
tions and the kinds of microor
ganisms present.
Initially scientists believed that
microbial decomposition of hydro
carbons required oxygen. Because
contaminated soil is often anaero
bic, or lacking oxygen, engineers
had to devise methods of deliver
ing the gas to the contaminated
area.
Special injection wells, called
bioventing systems, pump air
into the soil. Before bioventing
can be implemented, a detailed
survey of the site must be per
formed to determine the num
ber, location and depth of the
injection wells.
Alternatively, liquid hydrogen
peroxide can be used to deliver
soluble oxygen to the contaminat
ed soil. Because hydrogen perox
ide is itself a toxic chemical, this
process can only be used at sites
where the ground water is already
contaminated.
Much of this, however, may not
even be necessary. In the mid
1980s, Civil Engineering Prof.
Martin Reinhard made a signifi
cant discovery that changed the
way contaminated oil spills were
remediated.
While studying a municipal
landfill contaminated with
petroleum products, Reinhard
observed the attenuation of toxins
in the absence of oxygen. Rein
hard's only explanation was that
anaerobic microbes present at the
site must be consuming the con
taminants.
Thanks to Reinhard, it is now
widely accepted th«it microorgan
isms can use a variety of com
pounds, not just oxygen, to
degrade fuel hydrocarbons to car
bon dioxide and water.
Reinhard's work has spurred
further studies on anaerobic

degradation. Spormann's lab
focuses on the initial biochemical
reactions involved in toluene,
ethyl benzene and xylene degrada
tion. They have identified anaer
obes that use novel biochemical
reactions to degrade ethyl benzene
and toluene and are currently try
ing to purify the enzymes that
carry out these reactions.
"Our goal is to understand
nature's biochemical toolbox,"
Spormann said. "These bacteria
have novel enzymes which cat
alyze novel reactions. They may

have interesting and useful indus
trial applications in the future."
The ultimate goal of bioremedi
ation is to clean up a spill in a
timely, safe and cost-effective
manner. "Most waste products are
taken care of naturally, but the
time-scale for the cleanup may be
lengthy," McCarty said.
Reinhard added: "We aim to
provide recommendations for
accelerating the attenuation pro
cess. We are interested in amend
ments which will enhance degra
dation at a particular site."
