# Ehrlich reveals his views on natural disasters, economists
## 
### Bruce Wang 
Paul Ehrlich is a professor of biology who has been
working on issues ranging from checkerspot butterfly
population to human population. In the 19605, he lost
a famous bet to a University of Maryland economist
that the price of metals would increase as various
commodities became scarcer. Despite some criticism,
he has received wide recognition for his achievements
in 1994 he and his wife, Anne, won the Heinz
Award in the Environment.

Q: It's been almost 30years since
you published your book, "The Pop
ulation Bomb," in 1968. Many peo
ple attribute the rise of the modern
environmental movement to your
efforts on the issue of human popu
lation. Do you think society has
made enough progress in this area
since then ?
A: Society has made enormous
progress since "The Population
Bomb" was written. For instance
we've put in place a whole suit of
environmental laws that are some
of the best in the world. Most sensi
ble people in our society no longer
doubt that we have serious popula
tion and environmental problems.
Unfortunately, our progress has
been small compared to the
progress we've made to destroy our
life-support system.
What gives me hope more than
anything else is that we do know
that societies can change extremely
rapidly at times. I was told in the
'60s by social scientists that we
wouldn't reach replacement repro
duction, that is get down to a two
child family, until past the year
2000, even with government inter
vention. We hit it in 1972 without
any government intervention.
So what gives environmentalists
hope is that we may get that kind of
change in attitudes and actions on
overpopulation, over-consumption,
the things in our society that need
order for us to get on the road
instead of the road down the drain.

lack of equity —
to be changed in
to sustainability

Q: Do you believe that there is a definite carrying
capacity of the Earth, and if so, have we reached it?
A: There's no question at all that there is a carry
ing capacity to the Earth since you cannot have infi
nite growth on a finite planet. The issue of where the
carrying capacity is depends on our lifestyle. The

planet can hold fewer Hollywood moguls than it can
subsistence farmers. There is not the slightest ques
tion that with current patterns of behavior and
lifestyles we are far beyond the carrying capacity of
the planet, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist
to understand why.
We're using up our agricultural soils, fossil ground
water and biodiversity at much higher rates than
they're being replenished. We are like the idiot child
who has gotten a vast inheritance and is spending it
more and more every year and just keeps bragging
that every year he can write a bigger check but never

looks at the balance.
Q: This past winter, Washington and Oregon suf
fered disastrous mud slides. Are these natural disas
ters connected to human activities?
A: That is a good example of failure of what we call
"ecosystem services" or "nature's services." Most peo
ple don't understand that our lives are supported hy
whole series of services supplied by natural ecosys
tems without which we could not survive.
These are billions of dollars of services that we get
for free. When you upset them like when you over

harvest trees on slopes, then you worsen the mud
slides and floods in those watershed. That's what's
happened in the Northwest this year.
Q: What steps can we take to prevent these overuses
of our ecosystem ?
A: We have to do basically three things. We have to
stop the growth of the human population, part icular
ly in places like the U.S., where the population is
made of individually vast over-consumers. We have to
stop human population growth as rapidly as we can do
it humanely. That is, by lowering the birth rate below

the death rate. And then get a gradual shrinkage of
the world population back to a size that can provide
everybody with a decent lifestyle.
We've got to help poor countries avoid the mistakes
we made. We should be helping China and India right
now to power their development with solar energy
rather than with coal. So we've got to hit population,
we've got to hit consumption, and we've got to use
more environmentally benign technologies to service
that consumption.
Q: Most of your detractors are economists. They say

your predictions of mass population die off in the
1980s never came true, and they point to the advance
ment of technology as the reason why.
A: First of all, it is clear that the level of famine
that we predicted was not correct. But I don't think
we have a record to be proud of. We've lost roughly
250 million people to hunger since "The Population
Bomb" was written. We have almost a billion people
in hunger today.
There's no question that the "Green Revolution"
technology spread faster than agriculturists had pre
dicted. It was enough to temporarily change the situ-

ation. It has actually, in a long tech
nological discussion, put us in worse
shape today.
But frontline economists and
frontline ecologists are working
together these days and understand
tbr situation. Business economists,
the editorialists of The Wall Street
Journal and random idiots who
don't know anything about eco
nomics and ecology are the ones out
of it, and what can I say?
One of the cheeriest (hings that's
happened over the last 10 years —
and it's been centered right here in
Stanford — is the working together
of frontline economists and front
line ecologists. We have weekly sem
inars in which economists and ecol
ogists get together to deal with
these issues. The detractors just
don't understand how far ahead
Stanford is on these issues.
Q: What advice do you have for
Stanford students on how we can
better protect our environment ?
A: What you can do is learn basic
environmental science. There are
many places where you can get it on
the Stanford campus. You're at an
institution where you don't have to
learn where your food comes from
and things that are really critical
because we don't require it of all
our students. Wo ought to. The

very first tiling to do is to educate yourself on the
issues you learn to think about.
You've got to first learn about these issue. They're
complicated sometimes, but if you're not willing to
put 10 percent of your time into trying to save the
world then you're going to get the world you deserve.

science was prepared by Anne Kuimy.
