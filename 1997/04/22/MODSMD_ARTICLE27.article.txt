Earth's usable nitrogen levels double

Stop! Before applying a handful of fertilizer to
your backyard vegetable garden, read this first.
Largely because of agricultural use of nitrogen
based fertilizers, humans have increased the
amount of fixed nitrogen in the environment, caus
ing damage to human health, killing plants and
fish and generally wreaking havoc on the bio
sphere.

Nitrogen is naturally abundant; about 78 percent of the
atmosphere is pure nitrogen gas. However, most organisms can
not use nitrogen in its gaseous form. It has to be "fixed," a pro
cess naturally performed by lightning and certain bacteria,
which creates usable molecules like ammonium and nitrate out
of the atmospheric nitrogen.
Although fixed nitrogen is beneficial for most organisms,
humans have nearly doubled the amount of fixed nitrogen in the
ecosystem and have begun to cause major problems. According to
Biology Prof. Peter Vitousek, "Fixed nitrogen is essential for all
life, but the added nitrogen is literally too much of a good thing."
Humans have pumped millions of tons of nitrogen into the
biosphere through pollution from automobiles and industrial
smokestacks. This results in smog and the destruction of fish
eries and other marine habitats, as well as an increase in the
greenhouse effect.
In some places, like northern Europe, the amount of nitrogen
has increased tenfold. "The rain there supplies all the land with
as much fixed nitrogen each year as many farmers apply to their
crops," said Vitousek.
Although bringing nitrogen levels back to normal is difficult,
Vitousek suggests that some steps can be taken. More efficient
fertilizer use, particularly in developing nations, could reduce
the amount of nitrogen pumped into the ecosystem. Restoration
of wetlands, which decrease the amount of nitrogen flowing into
streams and estuaries, could also help solve the problem.

Environmental resources at Stanford

Everyone knows that Stanford has among the
best business, engineering and law schools in the
country. Add Stanford's graduate ecological
research program to that prestigious list.
Contributing to Stanford's strength in this field
is the wide variety of resources and the large
amount of interdisciplinary programs that include
faculty from varied fields like engineering, law,

economics and medicine. The availability of these resources and
programs have allowed Stanford researchers to push the enve
lope of environmental study, doing things like collaborating
with experts in public policy to solve social and economic prob
lems caused by environmental degradation.
One of the many resources unique to Stanford is the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, a 1,200-acre outdoor laboratory.
Jasper Ridge allows scientists to conduct long-term experiments
in an environment free from human interaction. Current
research at Jasper Ridge includes topics related to global change
and biodiversity led by biology professors Chris Field and
Harold Mooney, among others.
Environmental researchers have many more Stanford
resources open to them: the Center for Conservation Biology,
the Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, the
Global Environment Program, the Program in Global Ecosys
tem Function, the Western Region Hazardous Substance
Research Center, the Energy Modeling Forum and the Environ
mental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory.
The Earth Systems Program, which is offered as an under
graduate major, allows undergraduates to experience ecological
studies.
