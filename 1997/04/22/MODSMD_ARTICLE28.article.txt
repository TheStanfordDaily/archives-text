# Housing services to phase out halogen lamps
## 
### Laura Lane Editorial staff 
The University has been work
ing to improve lighting efficiency
on campus by replacing power-guz
zling light fixtures with more effi
cient modes of lighting. As a sym
bolic gesture in support of these
efforts, a small group of students
gathered in White Plaza Saturday
afternoon to bury a halogen lamp.
Low-cost and exceptional
brightness have convinced many
students to purchase a halogen
torchiere lamp. These 300 to 500
watt lamps are so energy inefficient
that the heat they generate has
touched off many fires across the
country. Rules restricting the use
of halogen torchieres in campus
housing will be enforced next fall.
Working with the Stanford Util
ities Department, Lawrence Berke
ley Labs and EM ESS Lighting
Manufacturers, Student Housing
Services developed the compact flu
orescent torchiere. These lamps
use 67 watts of energy to produce
light that is 20 percent brighter
than that of the halogen lamp.
"It's exciting that Stanford is at
the forefront of the new technology
of compact fluorescence and show
ing a commitment to energy con
servation while understanding stu
dent lighting needs," said senior
Greg Wright, student coordinator
for Saturday's event, which was
sponsored by Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford.
To begin distribution of the new
torchieres, housing services creat-

Ed the swap program in which stu
dents in Mirrielees and Lamda Nu
houses may exchange their halogen
torchieres for one of the first 150
new lamps arriving on campus.
These dorms were found to have
the highest percentage of halogen
lamps per student.
"We didn't want to take any
thing away from students, we
wanted to give them something bet
ter," said David Frost, energy man
ager at Student Housing Services.
The new fluorescent torchieres
will be in stores, including the
Stanford Bookstore, by fall.
For the last four years, the utili
ties division of Facilities Project
Management, along with housing
services, has been involved in
replacing every fluorescent lamp
on campus with newer T-8 fluores
cent lamps. These newer lamps use
less energy while emitting a
brighter and higher quality light
than the older fluorescent bulbs.
The University is also replacing
many light switches with lights
operated by occupancy sensors.
These sensors detect motion and
sound by using infared energy and
sound waves. Scott Gould, energy
engineer at the utilities division of
Facilities Project Management,
hopes to circumvent the problem of
lights being left on unnecessarily.
"Power plants in California are
burning natural gas, giving off
wasteful emissions into the atmo
sphere," Gould said. "By using
energy more efficiently, we're mak
ing better use of our resources and
not polluting the atmosphere."
