# Bug explains why rotting gunk is good for you

Q # / want to do my part to
• observe Earth Day and
siart composting. Why should I
compost, and is there anyway to
keep it from stinking?
A .Composting is an excellent
• way of dealing with organic
wastes and reducing the amount
of solid waste that you throw
away every day. It has been esti
mated that organic matter,
which is suitable for compost
ing, comprises almost one-quar

ter of the solid waste thrown
away in this country.
Furthermore, these organic
wastes which are disposed of
through regular methods are
usually incinerated or buried in
landfills. Incineration is bad
because moist organic materials
burn poorly and create more pol
lution. Burying the waste is also
pretty ineffective because
decomposition is slowed by the
lack of oxygen, which can lead to
nasty smells and even more pol
lutants.
Composting waste offers
many benefits. The end-product
of composting organic waste is
humus, a natural fertilizer
which is cheaper and arguably
better than commercial, chemi
cal fertilizers.
You see, farmers got all excit
ed when chemical fertilizers
were developed because they
thought they could just keep
dumping them in the ground
and plant crops forever and
ever.
Well, then the cows came
home (figuratively), and people
started noticing the fertilizers
leaching through the soil into

waterways and lots of erosion.
Humus can prevent these prob
lems by retaining moisture and
nutrients and releasing them at
an appropriate rate to the vege
tation planted within the soil.
So not only does composting
mean you have to lug less trash
out for the garbage, but you can
also get some good soil to plant
your, urn, vegetable garden in.
Hut you probably still have this
vision of a steaming pile of
stinky, rotting gunk sitting in a
pile outside your window.
First of all, you don't have to
put your compost pile outside
your window. It's perfectly all
right to hide your compost pile
away from sight, like out behind
the tool shed, behind some trees,
or maybe you could even clean
out that closet with all the
clothes you haven't washed
since the Reagan administration
and stick it in there. Then you
might not even notice the differ
ence if your compost pile stinks.
Actually, the smell of a com
post pile is controllable. The
stuff doesn't have to stink, and a
malodorous compost pile may be
an indication that something's

wrong. Inside a compost pile
microorganisms decompose
organic material through many
different methods.
Especially important, though,
is whether oxygen is available to
the microorganisms involved. In
an efficiently operating compost
pile, oxygen is readily availahle
and aerobic metabolism of the
organic waste proceeds happily
with plenty of heat generated by
the blissful decomposers.
Under low-oxygen conditions,
or anaerobic conditions, those
nasty-smelling chemicals are
generated and lead to compost
stench. This indicates that
something is wrong with the
composting conditions, and
everyone knows that an unhap
py compost pile leads to an
unhappy composter.
Some ways of getting more
oxygen into the pile are by turn
ing the compost periodically and
introducing fillers that enhance
air circulation and reduce mois
ture.
That's good news for your
future compost pile, but unfor
tunately, it doesn't work as well
for your dirty laundry. Sorry.
