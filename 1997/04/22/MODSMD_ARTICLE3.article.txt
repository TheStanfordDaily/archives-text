## Seniors planning for graduation time capsule 
### Jessica Lan 
By the time this year's seniors are senior citi
zens coming back for their class reunion, they
may have a chance to peek into the time cap
sule underneath the bronze plate, worn
smooth by years of students walking through
the Quad. Memories come flooding back

when the bronze is peeled back to reveal... a tiger sala
mander?
"We're the first class that hasn't had a bonfire at
Lake Lag, so we were thinking about putting a tiger
salamander in... or, well, at least a picture of one," said
senior Nima Farzan, the class president in charge of the
class plate and time capsule.
The tradition was started by the class of 1896 on its
graduation.
According former University president Donald
Kennedy, the bronze plates won't wind back around to
the front of Memorial Church until the class of 2492
graduates, 600 years after the first plate was laid.
Each year, the graduating class decides what will be
buried in its capsule. There are always some traditional
items, such as a copy of the Stanford Quad, the campus
yearbook, a class shirt, a Big Game ticket and some
Daily clippings, but the rest of the items reflect the grad

uating class itself.
Classes oflen choose to put in things reflective of the
time period. The class of 1977 decided to bury certain
objects — vials of saccharine, fossil fuel, water and a
birth control pill — they thought would be obsolete in
the future. The class of 1982 chose to put cocaine para
phernalia in their time capsule.
In order to decide what will go in the capsule this
year, the class presidents have been talking informally
to other seniors to find out what they think is signifi
cant, Farzan said.
Farzan said this year's class would be putting in
things that are meaningful to seniors in terms of their
Stanford experience, not just the time period.
"We were joking about putting in a hard hat or some
thing else that is reminiscent of the construction be
cause it seems like that's all that has been going on for
the past four years," Farzan said.
The class is so far planning to put in a class shirt, tick
ets to Rig Gai , Pub Crawl and the senior formal, but
"nothing's r» ' decided yet," Farzan said.
Senior Micl el Turner said he would also like to
see campus-related items, such as a menu from Polio
Rev in the time capsule, but also some non-Stanford
