## Seniors planning for graduation time capsule 
### Jessica Lan 
By the time this year's seniors are senior citi
zens coming back for their class reunion, they
may have a chance to peek into the time cap
sule underneath the bronze plate, worn
smooth by years of students walking through
the Quad. Memories come flooding back

when the bronze is peeled back to reveal... a tiger sala
mander?
"We're the first class that hasn't had a bonfire at
Lake Lag, so we were thinking about putting a tiger
salamander in... or, well, at least a picture of one," said
senior Nima Farzan, the class president in charge of the
class plate and time capsule.
The tradition was started by the class of 1896 on its
graduation.
According former University president Donald
Kennedy, the bronze plates won't wind back around to
the front of Memorial Church until the class of 2492
graduates, 600 years after the first plate was laid.
Each year, the graduating class decides what will be
buried in its capsule. There are always some traditional
items, such as a copy of the Stanford Quad, the campus
yearbook, a class shirt, a Big Game ticket and some
Daily clippings, but the rest of the items reflect the grad

uating class itself.
Classes oflen choose to put in things reflective of the
time period. The class of 1977 decided to bury certain
objects — vials of saccharine, fossil fuel, water and a
birth control pill — they thought would be obsolete in
the future. The class of 1982 chose to put cocaine para
phernalia in their time capsule.
In order to decide what will go in the capsule this
year, the class presidents have been talking informally
to other seniors to find out what they think is signifi
cant, Farzan said.
Farzan said this year's class would be putting in
things that are meaningful to seniors in terms of their
Stanford experience, not just the time period.
"We were joking about putting in a hard hat or some
thing else that is reminiscent of the construction be
cause it seems like that's all that has been going on for
the past four years," Farzan said.
The class is so far planning to put in a class shirt, tick
ets to Rig Gai , Pub Crawl and the senior formal, but
"nothing's r» ' decided yet," Farzan said.
Senior Micl el Turner said he would also like to
see campus-related items, such as a menu from Polio
Rev in the time capsule, but also some non-Stanford

objects as well.
"I think we should have Stanford
items, but we should also include
things which relate to significant
world events," Turner said.
Senior Nick Mahrt agreed.
"I definitely want things repre
sentative of the University buried in
the capsule — but traditional things
that happen year after year lose
meaning after 100 years," Mahrt
said. "I would rather see things of our
four years that are symbolic of these
incidences." He said that he would
rather see items that represents
unique events and suggested a I lait
ian flag or a bunch of wax grapes.

The senior class also decides
when to unearth the capsule. So far,
none lias been unearthed except one
brought out in 1980 as a conse
quence of construction.
It was once speculated that the

capsules would be opened at the
100 th reunion, or 100 years after
graduation, but so far, none has
been scheduled.
Far/an said he would rather not
plan a specific date to open the time
capsule.
"I think it would be best if we
didn't set a date. That way, there is
more of a mystery to it,"he said.
Although many alumni cannot
even remember what went into the
capsules underneath the class
plates, it seems that the physical
contents of the capsule are not what
is important. Perhaps for gradu
ates, the capsules will capture mem
ories of their Stanford years.
"Senior year has definitely been
my best year," Farzan said, "and I
think the plaque will serve as a re
minder of that."
