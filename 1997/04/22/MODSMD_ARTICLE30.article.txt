## Top finishes at Mt. SACs Track and field fares well 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
In 1976, Tony Sandoval cemented his name in
the Stanford record books by finishing the 5,000
meters in 13:53.52. This weekend, the record book
was rewritten.
At the Mt. SAC relays in Walnut this weekend,
freshman Brent Hauser eclipsed Sandoval's record
by nearly 14 seconds, running the 5,000 meters in
a blazing 13:39.75.
Hauser managed to secure his name in the
record books and qualify himself for NCAAs. His
twin brother, Brad, also ran faster than the record
time, finishing with a time of 13:42.49, also quali
fying for NCAAs. Senior Rob Reeder hit the NCAA
standard in the 5,000 meters, too, crossing the line

at 13:52.67 — a time that also beats the old record.
The "Distance Carnival," aptly named by the
events organizers, also included impressive perfor
mances in the women's 5,000 meters. Sophomore
Mary Cobb ran 16:04.2, finishing seventh and
securing a spot at NCAAs. Junior Sarna Renfro
checked in with an NCAA-provisional qualifying
mark of 16:23.07.
Junior Monal Chokshi hit the NCAA-provision
al standard in the 3,000 meters with a time of
9:22.80, finishing in fourth place. Senior Amanda
White set a new personal best in the 3,000 meters,
finishing at 9:44.97.
Freshman Michael Stember finished the 800
meters in 1:49.33, fast enough to qualify provi-
sionally for NCAAs. Also, among
a field including one other colle
giate athlete, Stember's time
placed him eighth for the race.
Freshman Cynthia Morman
ran a personal best of 2:10.88 in
the 800 meters on the women's
side. The mark is also good
enough for qualification to the
Pacific 10 championships.
Junior Ryan McCalmon ran
the 5k in 14:23, enough to finish
ninth and to qualify for Pac-lOs.
Junior Justin Strand tossed the
hammer 217-07 feet, good
enough for a sixth place finish.
"Great performances. We had
a tremendous weekend at Mt.
SAC," said head coach Vin
Lananna.
Mt. SAC was not the only
place to find track and field
action over the weekend. Four
Cardinal athletes competed in
the Azuza Pacific Heptathlon
Invitational in Azuza. "They had
superb performances," Lananna
said.
Sophomore Trayce Lawyer
topped the Cardinal field, total
ing 5,604 points and finishing
third in the heptathlon competi
tion. This score is enough to
qualify Lawyer for NCAAs. The
mark also meets the Olympic
trial standard of last year.
Freshman Joy Goff totaled
4,910 points, followed by junior
Katrinka Jackson with 4,893
points. Both qualified for Pac
10s. Freshman Julie Tinker
competing in her first-ever hep
tathlon, finished with 4,390
points, missing the Pac-10 quali
fying mark by just 10 points.
