# Men's rugby wins regional playoffs, makes Final Four
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
With two decisive victories in
the regional playoffs in West
Point, N.Y., last weekend the sec
ond-ranked men's rugby team
clinched itself a berth in the Final
Four in Berkeley May 3 and 4.
The Cardinal rolled over
Catholic University of Washing
ton, D.C., 55-5, on Saturday,
then held off a small second-half
comeback by Truman State on
Sunday to win the tournament
55-27.
The team has improved its
"open" style of play, according to
head coach Franck Boivert.
"They have a very open style
because we have a lot of mobile
players," Boivert said. "We have

to work on the little mistakes
over the next two weeks, but
that's a lot of time to correct
those."
The men's teamwork and pace
were positive parts of the week
end. Since spring break the Car
dinal has been trying to get itself
together while maintaining its
high-speed play.
The team was also helped by
key performances by individual
players. Junior Greg Guinney
and freshman Miguel Sanchez
both rose to the occasion with
aggressive play.
"Miguel tackled hard on a lot
of plays. He was very dynamic
and very effective in defense,"
Boivert said. "Greg was very cre
ative on offense. He played with a
lot of pace and class.

"They both played extremely
well, and of course two of our key
players, Isophomore) Don Don
ester and [seniorl Jason White
both played very well."
The men jumped out to a 38-0
lead in the finals, but Truman
gave 4 bom t r light score, 'brent
ening to come back.
"The ref saw that it was
becoming a one-sided match and
20 h<> tried to play the equalizer,"
Boivert said. "He did a poor job of
calling the game in the second
half. So when we should have
been celebrating our trip to the
Final Four, we ended up very irri
tated by the official."
The team knows that despite
these strong wins, there's a
tough road ahead. The Cardi
nal's opponent for the first
round of the Final Four will be a
strong Penn State team. If Stan
ford wins, it will have to face the

winner of the UC-Davis / Cali
fornia match. The Cardinal has
already faced both teams,
defeating the then second
ranked Aggies 31-24 on Jan. 24
and losing to the defending
national champion Bears 41-24
on March 9.
"I think we have a lot of work
ahead of us," Sanchez said. "We

did well enough to beat the teams
at regionals, but the level of the
teams ahead are much better.
"We're playing together, but
sometimes we're getting ahead of
ourselves," he said. "That
showed up in the last game
lagainst Truman State]. We
sometimes get overconfident, and
we'll have to work on that."
