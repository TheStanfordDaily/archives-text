# Softball loses two games to Huskies
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Softball's road trip to Wash
ington this weekend fell just
short of producing a split, with
9-8 and 9-0 losses.
Although the team badly
wanted to pull out a victory
against Stanford head coach
John Rittman's former team,
the ultimate outcome proved
bittersweet, with a strong per
formance in game one and a
lackluster showing in game two.
Rittman served as an assistant
coach for Washington last year.
Game one proved to be a see
saw battle that was ultimately
won by Washington's speed on
the bases. The Cardinal had

more hits than the Huskies, but
Washington's ability to move its
baserunners into scoring posi
tion by virtue of stealing bases
was a huge advantage. Washing
ton had nine stolen bases in the
game, by far the most stolen
bases against Stanford all sea
son.
"Washington is near the top
in terms of stolen bases for a
team," said sophomore Marcy
Crouch. "They were by far the
quickest team we've played
against, and it kept us a little off
balance."
Stanford had a 4-] lead going
into the bottom of the fourth
inning, lead by senior third
