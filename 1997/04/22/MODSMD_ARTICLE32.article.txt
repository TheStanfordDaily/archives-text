# Softball loses two games to Huskies
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Softball's road trip to Wash
ington this weekend fell just
short of producing a split, with
9-8 and 9-0 losses.
Although the team badly
wanted to pull out a victory
against Stanford head coach
John Rittman's former team,
the ultimate outcome proved
bittersweet, with a strong per
formance in game one and a
lackluster showing in game two.
Rittman served as an assistant
coach for Washington last year.
Game one proved to be a see
saw battle that was ultimately
won by Washington's speed on
the bases. The Cardinal had

more hits than the Huskies, but
Washington's ability to move its
baserunners into scoring posi
tion by virtue of stealing bases
was a huge advantage. Washing
ton had nine stolen bases in the
game, by far the most stolen
bases against Stanford all sea
son.
"Washington is near the top
in terms of stolen bases for a
team," said sophomore Marcy
Crouch. "They were by far the
quickest team we've played
against, and it kept us a little off
balance."

inning, lead by senior third

baseman Amanda Renteria's
stellar performance at the plate.
Renteria went 4-4 in the game
and logged one stolen base.
In the bottom of the fourth,
Washington rallied on a few hits,
breaks and stolen bases to score
six runs. Stanford was able to
come back and score four runs in
the top of the fifth, but one-run
innings for the Huskies in the
fifth and seventh innings
allowed them to prevail 9-8.
Both coaches deployed their
entire pitching staff in game
one, with Stanford and Wash
ington each using three pitchers.
Blevins pitched the majority of
innings, allowing eight runs in
five innings pitched. Blevins also
allowed seven walks, which
proved lethal when combined
with Washington's quickness.
"Washington really only had

a few solid hits in both games,"
Crouch said. "A lot of their hits
just found the gaps, with their
results being compounded by a
few more breaks."
In game two Stanford was
shutdown offensively, only
recording three hits, compared
to 12 hits in the first game. On
the defensive end, Stanford
played well but had a bad fourth
inning in which Washington
scored six runs. If it weren't for
that, the game would have been
tight.
Crouch pitched the entire
game, giving up two hits and
nine runs, six of them earned.
Stanford has had several
recent doubleheaders with one
solid game and one poor outing.
"It seems like we're having a
tough time with 14 innings in
one day," said Crouch. "That is a
problem (considering) the cal
iber of teams we're playing."
In one sense, it has been
encouraging to see the young
Stanford team able to compete

against the top teams in the
country. On the other hand,
Stanford cannot afford mental
lapses for even one inning if the
women expect to beat these
teams.
"We're improving in all
areas," said freshman catcher
Kellie Wiginton. "We're looking
forward to playing some of these
teams at home in the coming
weeks. It should be exciting."
