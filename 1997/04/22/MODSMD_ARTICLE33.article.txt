### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Stanford senior Jamila Wide
man has signed to play profession
al basketball with the Women's
National Basketball Association,
the league announced yesterday.
Wideman, a 5-foot-6 guard and
four-year starter and captain
with the Cardinal basketball
team, reportedly received a one
year contract with an option for a
one-year extension if the league
so desires. She is now eligible for
the WNBA draft to be held next
Monday.
"I can't say enough great
things about Jamila," said WNBA
President Val Ackerman. "In
addition to having outstanding
basketball skills, Jamila has
tremendous appeal as a leader
and a role model, and we are
thrilled that she will be part of
the WNBA."
Wideman said some of the
determining factors in her deci
sion to play with the WNBA
rather than opting to join the
American Basketball League,
which just finished its inaugural
season, were the "immeasurable
potential and resources of the
NBA" and that the WNBA's val
ues "are in line with my visions of
women's basketball.
"I'm excited to be part of the
WNBA," Wideman said. "It's an
u i edible tne of opportunity in
women's basketball, and I'm
humbled to be part of this experi
ence."
In her four years at Stanford,
Wideman accumulated a record of
118-14 while guiding the Cardi
nal to three consecutive Final
Four appearances. In her senior
season, Wideman averaged 8.6
points, five assists and 2.3 steals
per game in addition to being
named the NCAA West Regional
