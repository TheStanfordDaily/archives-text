# Baseball team faces Hornets tonight

### Ben Freda Staff writer 
For Stanford baseball, the time has come
to put up or shut up.
The Cardinal (29-13, 14-7 Pacific-10
Conference Southern Division), after losing
a crucial series to UCLA this weekend, has
dropped five of its last seven games and fall
en into a tie with UCLA for first place in the
Six-Pac.
That makes the last two weeks of regula
tion play a scramble for the No. 1 spot. Stan
ford's first chance to try to pull away from
the crowd will be in this weekend's series
against league rival California.

However, a single loss might let UCLA
take the top spot away from Stanford for the
first time this season.
But before that, the arrival of the Cal
State-Sacramento Hornets (13-31, 6-1(5 Hig
West Conference) at Sunken Diamond for
tonight's 7 p.m. game has given the Cardi
nal one last non-league chance to tune up.
Despite calling the team's recent perfor
mance solid, junior catcher Jon Schaeffer
thinks Stanford needs to work on timing
issues.
"We're just having trouble putting two
and two together," he said. "When we
have the hitting, we don't have the pitch
ing. When we have the pitching, we just

can't hit."
Those problems worked into several
recent losses.
In Sunday's 5-3 loss to UCLA, sopho
more starter Chad Hutchinson had
arguably his best outing of the season, going
fj 1/.'} innings and giving up only three runs
while striking out eight. Hut the team
wasn't able to give him any support, slap
ping only seven hits, all singles. The team
eventually lost 5-3.
"It was a good outing for Chad," Schaef
fer said. "We need him to pitch like; that if
we're going to go anywhere. Hut it's too bad
