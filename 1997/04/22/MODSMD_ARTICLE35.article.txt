# Ultimate undefeated at sectionals
## 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Superfly, the women's ultimate Frisbee team, and
La Familia, the men's team, breezed through sec
tionals in Pleasanton Sunday without a loss to mar
the weekend's record.
They were joined in their success by Department
of Corrections, the men's B-team, which upset UC-
Santa Cruz in a stellar performance.
The women defeated Las Positas College 15-2 in
the semifinals, while the men defeated Las Positas

Collegels-0 in the quarterfinals and then UC-Davis
15-2 in the semifinals.
Both the men's and women's teams played Cali
fornia in the finals, winning their games 15-5 and
15-4, respectively.
Although the weekend's matches didn't exactly
challenge the squads, there were some exciting
plays. The plush fields made several layouts possi
ble. (Layouts are throws that are caught by players
who are horizontal in the air and land on their
chests or side.)
The ultimate teams will
advance to the regional tourna
ment May 3-4. The first matches
will be held at Stanford, and the
second day will be in Santa Cruz.
Women's coach Jennifer Don
nelly said she expects the regional
tournament to be very competi
tive.
Highlights for the women this
weekend included great plays
from senior Abby Hoover, sopho
more Mary Hunt Martin and
freshman Camille Yu.
Senior Dominique Fontenette
also continues to be one of the key
players of the team, throwing
about 40 percent of its goals.

Juniors Martita Emde and
Andrea Johnson are other players
essential to the Superfly offense,
according to Donnelly.
"The thing great about this
team is that many players step up
and play great," Donnelly said.
In order to be successful in the
upcoming tournaments, Donnel
ly feels that the team must
reduce turnovers and polish its
offense.
"When we don't have turn
overs, we win the game," she said.
Also they have to be able to
"call that (tough) mental state
up" whenever they play, be it a
game, a practice or even a Friday
afternoon.
"This is the mark of a champi
onship team," Donnelly said.
On the men's side, other fac
tors have contributed to the wins.
La Familia credits this weekend's

success to the "youthful sounds of
the Spice Girls," said sophomore
Omer Atesman, which got the
group in gear during warmups.
"The Spice Girls were key fac
tors in our win against Cal," Ates
man said.
In the upcoming regional tour
nament, La Familia expects to
face its toughest competition
against UC-Santa Bar bare, with
whom Stanford has a 1-1 record,
and University of British
Columbia, whom Stanford hasn't
played this year.
Only two teams from regionals
qualify for nationals, so the men
are focused on beating these two.
In order to prepare for region
als, the team is stocking up on
Powerbars, especially the oat
meal-raisin flavor, according to
Atesman. At this weekend's tour
nament, the supply ran low.
