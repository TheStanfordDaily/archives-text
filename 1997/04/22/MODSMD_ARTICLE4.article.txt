# Merger plan for IDPs considered
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The possibility of a merger of
four policy-based interdepartmen
tal programs has faculty opti
mistic about the strength of the
combination but has elicited a
wide range of reactions from stu
dents.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll an
nounced last week in the Faculty
Senate that the program he heads,
public policy, is looking into merg
ing with the programs in interna
tional policy studies, urban stud
ies and international relations.
In an interview yesterday, Noll
said that "among a very small group
of people ... we have an agreement
in principle." Administrators, facul
ty and students within the pro
grams are now considering the ac
tual auricular implications of such
a move.
The only definite move so far is
that the programs are all about to
move into the same building, said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Judith
Goldstein, head of international
policy studies, which offers only a
master's degree. "I'm still not con
vinced that we'll be able to do it,"
she said.

Were they to merge, however,
the combination would be among
the biggest interdisciplinary pro
grams on campus, almost as large as
the Program in Human Biology.
Some students were concerned
that having a program of this size
would undermine many basic as
pects of interdisciplinary programs,
including close faculty interaction
and student involvement in re
search.
"The strength of IDPs is their
size," said ASSU President Bill
Shen, a junior and public policy
major.
Senior Michael Putnam, a sci
ence, technology and society major,
said he was "all for the new organi
zation if it means that IDPs can be
strengthened while maintaining
their independence."
Putnam is a leader of Save STS,
the student movement that
emerged last year when it appeared
the program would be abolished.
He stressed that any successful
merger must have meaningful stu
dent involvement throughout the
process rather than just at the end.
The Faculty Senate feels similarly,
he said, as evidenced by a resolution
it passed last year objecting to
changing programs without proper
student consultation.
Senior Greta Rieber, an urban
studies major, saw the issue of size
as one of "insuring the long-term
viability of urban studies."
She noted that many smaller in
terdisciplinaiy programs have had
to struggle to survive and that
many people in urban studies think
it is only a matter of time before
their program encounters such
problems.
She acknowledged that the inti
macy of a small program is valuable
and that a larger one would, she
hoped, preserve some of those as
pects.
While agreeing that preserving
close student-faculty interaction is
a possible problem, Noll noted two
advantages of a larger program.
The first is "enormous
economies of scale" that would
mean the program had "more bud
get left over to spend on the stu
dents."
A larger program will also help
faculty in "collaborating on causing
courses to be taught" and making
sure that departments provide the
requisite courses for interdiscipli
nary programs.
Exactly what courses will be re
quired for any combined major is a
complicated issue, given that public
policy currently has more quantita
tive, mathematical content than in
ternational relations or urban stud
ies.
Civil Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who heads urban studies,
said his program is working to de
velop a "relatively modest" number
of core courses, mainly in econom
ics, sociology and political science,
that might be the basis of a com
bined curriculum.
He also said any such core would
mean a greater number of required

units for urban studies majors.
Combining with public policy
would also increase the quantita
tive content of his program, Or
tolano said, although it will still not
have as much focus as public policy
on, for example, statistics.
Under this plan, Ortolano said,
urban studies will be "more quanti
tative, more rigorous, but it will not
be the public policy program."
He said that requiring such
courses as Economics 51 or 180
would put students at an advantage
in graduate urban planning or ar
chitecture programs, where such
skills are often necessary but not al
ways required.
He added that students might
have difficulty relating some of the
more advanced economics to their
urban studies interests. A possible
solution, Ortolano said, would be
an optional tutorial designed to run
along with the economics courses
and demonstrate their relation to
urban situations.
He said being able to offer such a
course would be an advantage of
the greater resources of a larger
program.
Ortolano acknowledged that the
increased emphasis on quantitative
skills would result in some reduc
tion in more area-oriented, qualita
tive courses.
Because many urban studies
majors have a heavy focus on archi
tecture, Ortolano said the pro
gram's student-faculty committee
is working on a way to excuse them
from some the possible new re
quirements.
Rieber noted that urban studies
majors who focus on planning al
ready take a lot of economics and
that the increase in technical re
quirements would really mean
"broadening that requirement to
include all majors."
As for public policy, Noll saw two
specific possible changes, those
being a "substantially more com
parative" emphasis so that stu
dents interested in, for example,
health policy, would have more op

portunities to study health policy in
foreign countries.
He also said that if international
relations becomes more analytical,
that would eliminate the need for
the current international track in
the public policy major.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Scott Sagan said he had no com
ment yet on what a combination
might mean for the curriculum of
international relations, which he
heads.
He and Noll both mentioned the
possible benefits to faculty whose
work may extend into more than
one of the currently defined pro
grams.
Students had a range of views on
the curricular changes. Shen said
he is skeptical.
"I'd like to see what the interdisci
plinary connection between these in
terdisciplinary programs i5.... I'm
concerned that a 'supermajor' would
lack a coherent focus," Shen said.
Other students saw advantages
in moving the curricula toward
each other.
"It's good for international rela
tions people to be more quantita
tive, and it's good for public policy
people to be more international,"
said public policy major Julie John
son, ajunior.
She added that adding a gradu
ate aspect to the program through
international policy studies would
be attractive for public policy ma
jors who find themselves overpre
pared for graduate programs at
other schools.
Putnam also noted that bring
ing in a graduate program is a good
way to incorporate research into in
terdisciplinary programs and make
them more attractive to faculty.
According to Goldstein, adding a
domestic-focused track to interna
tional policy studies would be rela
tively easy, as opposed to several
parts of the combination that she
said looked more difficult.
"I see [a combined program |
more as a dream than as I reality. I
hope it happens," Goldstein said.
