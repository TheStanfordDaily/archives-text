# Merger plan for IDPs considered
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The possibility of a merger of
four policy-based interdepartmen
tal programs has faculty opti
mistic about the strength of the
combination but has elicited a
wide range of reactions from stu
dents.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll an
nounced last week in the Faculty
Senate that the program he heads,
public policy, is looking into merg
ing with the programs in interna
tional policy studies, urban stud
ies and international relations.
In an interview yesterday, Noll
said that "among a very small group
of people ... we have an agreement
in principle." Administrators, facul
ty and students within the pro
grams are now considering the ac
tual auricular implications of such
a move.
The only definite move so far is
that the programs are all about to
move into the same building, said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Judith
Goldstein, head of international
policy studies, which offers only a
master's degree. "I'm still not con
vinced that we'll be able to do it,"
she said.

Were they to merge, however,
the combination would be among
the biggest interdisciplinary pro
grams on campus, almost as large as
the Program in Human Biology.
Some students were concerned
that having a program of this size
would undermine many basic as
pects of interdisciplinary programs,
including close faculty interaction
and student involvement in re
search.
"The strength of IDPs is their
size," said ASSU President Bill
Shen, a junior and public policy
major.
Senior Michael Putnam, a sci
ence, technology and society major,
said he was "all for the new organi
zation if it means that IDPs can be
strengthened while maintaining
their independence."
Putnam is a leader of Save STS,
the student movement that
emerged last year when it appeared
the program would be abolished.
He stressed that any successful
merger must have meaningful stu
dent involvement throughout the
process rather than just at the end.
The Faculty Senate feels similarly,
he said, as evidenced by a resolution
