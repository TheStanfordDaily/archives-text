The Stanford Institute for Research on Women
and Gender recently announced an endowment to
fund its director. The bequest, given by a donor
whose name has not yet been released, totaled $ 1 mil
lion.
Associate board member Mary Anna Matsumoto
said that although the University supplies the insti
tute with some funding, it must raise about $60,000
every year from outside sources, and the endown
ment will be an immense help.
The new endowment was announced at a gala held
by the institute to celebrate its 22nd anniversary.
The dinner, which included a keynote address by
Provost Condoleezza Rice, honored the contributions
of the institute's departing director and professor of
pediatrics, Iris Litt.
The institute's mission, said Matsumoto, "is to
conduct and encourage interdisciplinary research on
women and gender." Toward this end, the institute
aids promising interdisciplinary graduate and faculty
research on women's issues through a number of fel
lowships.
Litt has been responsible for much of the
progress of the institute, according to Matsumoto.
Under Litt's leadership, the institute began award
ing fellowships such as the Associates Faculty Re
search Fellowship, which annually awards one fac-

ulty member $10,000, and the Graduate Assistance
Fellowships, which awards five students $1,000
each.
The purpose of last night's dinner, said associate
board member Elkie Muller, was to foster support for
research on women's issues. The funds raised by the
dinner endowed the newly established Iris F. Litt
Fund at the institute.
According to Matsumoto, the institute "was
founded by a group of graduate students who just
wanted to talk" about gender issues. At the time of its
inception in 1974, the institute was the first of its
kind at any campus in the country. Subsequently,
universities nationwide have established similar or
ganizations.
The institute's mission, however, is not just to en
courage research on women's issues, Matsumoto
added.
Although the institute's primary purpose is to
sponsor research, another function is "to educate the
academic and general public on that research," Mat
sumoto said.
The institute presents the Jing Lyman Lecture Se
ries, which invites students, faculty and the public to
learn about the innovative research Stanford schol
ars conduct on issues of women and gender.
The institute has received strong support from
within the University. Rice particularly, Matsumoto
said, "has been very supportive."
