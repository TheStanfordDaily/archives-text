# Stanford is high in Title IX rankings
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
Figures published in the Chron
icle of Higher Education earlier this
month listed Stanford as one of the
schools that most successfully com
plies with Title IX — a federal law
enacted in 1972 that mandates
equal opportunities for men and
women in high school and college
athletics.
At Stanford, women account for
50 percent of the undergraduate
population and 45 percent of the
athletes, resulting in only a 5 per
cent difference. At other schools,
ratings ranged from the U.S. Air
Force Academy, which had 11 per
cent more female athletes than fe
male students, to Arkansas State
University, which had a 36 percent
fewer female athletes than female
students.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
said, "We've added three
(women's) sports — water polo,
lacrosse and synchronized swim
ming" in the six years that he has
been here. He also said that finan
cial support has increased for these
new programs.
Many schools, when faced with
both a limited athletic budget and
the risk of violating Title IX, cut ex
pensive, non-revenue generating
men's and women's sports teams

such as golf, gymnastics and water
polo. Schools choose this option as
an alternative to decreasing fund
ing for the expensive but more rev
enue generating sports such as bas
ketball and football.
Varsity wrestling coach Chris
1 lorpel said, "Title IX is a great law,
but recent interpretations have
hurt some men's programs. The
reason it hurt them is because it
sometimes requires discrimination
against men.
"In high school, there is a two to
one ratio of men vs. women ath
letes," Horpel continued. "When
you go from high school to college,
you have to even it out and elimi
nate a lot of men. A better solution
is to bring women up and encour
age the participation until girls and
women participate at the same
level. Don't cut anything. We need
to not eliminate opportunities but
enhance them."
"We've been lucky here and not
had tocutatall to build the women's
programs," Leland said. "Some pro
grams probably had some scholar
ship limitations, but none was rli
rectly related to Title IX."
"People all over try to get ath
letic directors to pit male sports vs.
female ones, which is inappropri
ate," Leland added. "We have a
compatible department and more
in common than outside people
think."
Some athletes, who feel that
their sports do not receive suffi
cient support, blame it on factors
other than gender. They cite low
student interest as a potential
cause.
Aloha Jamias, a freshman who
plays varsity women's water polo,
said, "I don't feel that the Athlet
ics Department gives us enough
support. Our head coach (Ben
Quittner) is not even a full-time
coach. He only coaches water polo
part-time and has to work another
job.
"We also have to do a lot of our
own fund raising for traveling.
We're not a money-making sport,

but maybe if we do well at nation
als, we'll get more support from
the department," Jamias added.
When the Athletics Depart
ment set its goals for gender equi
ty several years ago, the aim was
to increase female participation in
sports from 37 percent to 45 per
cent because 45 percent of stu
dents were women. Today, that
goal has been achieved, but the
representation of female under
graduates has increased to 50 per
cent, resulting in a continued dis
crepancy.
"We are still well ahead of most
people. The proportion in the un
dergraduate population has
changed, but we feel very good
about what we tried to do," Leland
said.
"There is so much undergradu
ate interest in participation that
there really is no reason to talk
about cutting any sports" at the
expense of others.
