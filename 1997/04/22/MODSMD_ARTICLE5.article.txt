# Stanford is high in Title IX rankings

Figures published in the Chron
icle of Higher Education earlier this
month listed Stanford as one of the
schools that most successfully com
plies with Title IX — a federal law
enacted in 1972 that mandates
equal opportunities for men and
women in high school and college
athletics.
At Stanford, women account for
50 percent of the undergraduate
population and 45 percent of the
athletes, resulting in only a 5 per
cent difference. At other schools,
ratings ranged from the U.S. Air
Force Academy, which had 11 per
cent more female athletes than fe
male students, to Arkansas State
University, which had a 36 percent
fewer female athletes than female
students.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
said, "We've added three
(women's) sports — water polo,
lacrosse and synchronized swim
ming" in the six years that he has
been here. He also said that finan
cial support has increased for these
new programs.
Many schools, when faced with
both a limited athletic budget and
the risk of violating Title IX, cut ex
pensive, non-revenue generating
men's and women's sports teams

such as golf, gymnastics and water
polo. Schools choose this option as
an alternative to decreasing fund
ing for the expensive but more rev
enue generating sports such as bas
ketball and football.
Varsity wrestling coach Chris

but recent interpretations have
hurt some men's programs. The
reason it hurt them is because it
sometimes requires discrimination
against men.
"In high school, there is a two to
one ratio of men vs. women ath
letes," Horpel continued. "When
you go from high school to college,
you have to even it out and elimi
nate a lot of men. A better solution
is to bring women up and encour
age the participation until girls and
women participate at the same
level. Don't cut anything. We need
to not eliminate opportunities but
enhance them."
"We've been lucky here and not
had tocutatall to build the women's
programs," Leland said. "Some pro
grams probably had some scholar
ship limitations, but none was rli
rectly related to Title IX."
"People all over try to get ath
letic directors to pit male sports vs.
female ones, which is inappropri
ate," Leland added. "We have a
