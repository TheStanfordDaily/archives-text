# Rep. Matsui talks trade and tactics
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
U.S. Rep. Robert Matsui discussed trade legislation
and budget issues before a crowd of 50 students at the
I laas Center for Public Service yesterday.
Matsui, who represents a California district that in
cludes Sacramento, is the ranking Democrat on the
I louse Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.
Since being elected to Congress in 1978, he has
gained an international reputation as a leader in trade,
tax policy, social security, health care and welfare re
form, according to a statement from Stanford In Gov
ernment, which sponsored the event.
Matsui told the students that although Congress
started the year optimistic about balancing the budget
and achieving bipartisan cooperation, the nation's cap
ital is turning increasingly skeptical.
Matsui declared that although the budget deadline
was April 15, Congress is not close to agreeing on a bud
get.
Matsui blamed the situation on severe partisan
ship and Republican apathy. "Many Republicans al
most lost this election and now don't want to do much
that is controversial; they just want to get re-elected,"

said Matsui.
He elaborated on the budget
gridlock by noting that a balanced
budget by the year 2002 requires
$150-$2OO billion cuts in domestic
discretionary spending. At the
same time, President Clinton and
congressional Republicans would
like to cut taxes by as much as $160
billion.
One suggestion for reducing the
deficit is to adjust the way inflation
is measured so that the figure is
lowered to what many economists
say is a more representative num
ber.
In practice, Matsui said, this
would result in higher tax levels for
the middle class because many tax
exemptions are indexed to infla
tion.
Another possibility is generat
ing revenue by reducing the capital
gains tax, suggesting that the
lower tax rate would stimulate the
movement of assets and create
more jobs.
Matsui replied that one must be
wary of assuming macroeconomic
effects of microeconomic changes,
as simply too many variables are in
volved to warrant any assumptions.

"Cutting the capital gains tax
now," argued Matsui, "will result
in an overall revenue loss over the
six-to-seven year period."
Another potential long-term
difficulty for balancing the budget
involved the rising cost of health
care for an increasing number of
retirees. "The number of workers
for each retired individual is declin
ing," said Matsui.
Although Matsui stressed that
there is cause for concern, he also
warned that all of the numbers
used in discussing this issue are
based on projections that may not
be true.
"With continuation of this
growth, the deficit may for the
most part take care of itself," added
Matsui.
If the deficit does not take care
of itself, however, Matsui was less
optimistic about what he saw as
necessary steps toward containing
it, particularly restructuring Social
Security.
"Right now touching Social Se
curity is a kiss of death," said Mat
sui. He added that the American
public needs to be educated before
the issue can be resolved.
Trade issues and concerns relat
ed to Asian-American communi
ties also figured in Matsui's agen
da.
After the event, Matsui voiced

his support for maintaining
China's most favorite nation
trading status. "I have been lead
ing the Democratic side on this
issue for seven years," said Mat
sui.
Matsui argued that China rep
resents 22 percent of the world
population and cutting trade with
China would have no impact on its
human rights policy.
The discussion toward the end
of the speech centered around
Asian-American issues and the im
pact of recent White House scan
dals about campaign contributions
on the image of the Asian-Ameri
can community.
"The only state where the
Asian-American vote has an im
pact is California, and even here
the impact is minimal," Matsui
said.
He added that Asian Americans
cannot view themselves as victims,
but must instead actively deal with
the negative image.
"The negative impact on the
Asian-American community may
take an election cycle to remedy,"
said Matsui.
Matsui ended the discussion by
calling on students to get involved
in the political process. "You have
to have passion, a reason, a goal,"
said Matsui. "We have got to get
good people into politics."
