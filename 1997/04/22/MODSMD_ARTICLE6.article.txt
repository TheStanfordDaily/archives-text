U.S. Rep. Robert Matsui discussed trade legislation
and budget issues before a crowd of 50 students at the
I laas Center for Public Service yesterday.
Matsui, who represents a California district that in
cludes Sacramento, is the ranking Democrat on the
I louse Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.
Since being elected to Congress in 1978, he has
gained an international reputation as a leader in trade,
tax policy, social security, health care and welfare re
form, according to a statement from Stanford In Gov
ernment, which sponsored the event.
Matsui told the students that although Congress
started the year optimistic about balancing the budget
and achieving bipartisan cooperation, the nation's cap
ital is turning increasingly skeptical.
Matsui declared that although the budget deadline
was April 15, Congress is not close to agreeing on a bud
get.
Matsui blamed the situation on severe partisan
ship and Republican apathy. "Many Republicans al
most lost this election and now don't want to do much
that is controversial; they just want to get re-elected,"
