# Law School joins fight
## Dean Brest says Stanford will help lobby against U.S. News' rankings 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Stanford Law School and 150
other law schools across the coun
try are publicly urging editors at
U.S. News & World Report to stop
ranking law schools in their maga
zine.
Although the University has re
cently focused its objections on the
weekly magazine's undergraduate
rankings, Law School Dean Paul
Brest said yesterday that he will
work through a number of law
school associations to lobby U.S.
News to curb its rankings alto
gether.
"There's simply no formula by
which you can take eight or 12 dif
ferent rankings, not to mention
the ones that are purely subjec
tive" and return a reliable esti
mate of an entire school, Brest
said.
Brest's rationale mirrors the
language used by University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper Friday,
when he announced that Stanford

would encourage other colleges
and universities to create a cen
tralized World Wide Web database
of college statistics. The Web site
would aim to supersede the need to
release information to U.S. News.
Casper also called for the maga
zine to end the rankings.
In a recent letter sent to U.S.
News editors, 150 law school
deans asked the magazine to re
duce the number of schools it
ranks from 25 to 20 next year, with
a long-term goal of eliminating the
rankings altogether.
"It is the case that each of us,
even those of us listed in your 'top
tiers,' has serious problems with
the general enterprise of ranking
law schools," the deans wrote, call
ing the rankings "an embarrass
ment to youi magazine." In U.S
News' most recent rankings, Stan
ford Law School was ranked third.
Brest said t hat although he con
curred that the rankings should be
eliminated, he did not sign the let


Brest
ter out of deference to protests
from a number of schools ranked
last year below 20.
"I've agreed with the basic part
of the letter from the very begin
ning," he said.
Like Casper, Brest did not sub
mit personal rankings of each of the
176 accredited law schools this
year, which are used in determining
schools' "academic reputation."

A 1 Sanoff, managing editor of
the magazine's college rankings
sections, said editors will take
the letter into consideration
when evaluating possible
changes to next year's law school
rankings.
"People in academia just are
averse to the idea of outsiders as
sessing the quality of institu
tions," Sanoff said. "While we're
mindful and concerned about how
higher education views what we
do, our primary function is to serve
prospective students and their
families."
