Jury chosen for bombing trial
DENVER (AP) — An anonymous jury was seated in the Okla
homa City bombing trial yesterday, with the judge using a bingo
style system of numbers to keep the identities of the panelists
secret.
Lawyers used peremptory challenges to select 12 jurors and six
alternates. The makeup of men and women was not immediately
known.
The jury will be sworn in tomorrow morning before opening
statements, U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch said.
Matsch and attorneys in the case questioned 99 potential
jurors over more than three weeks of jury selection.
During the final phase, potential jurors who had been identi
fied by number were redesignated with letters and numbers such
as B-6 and D-l.
"Like bingo, your honor," lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler
quipped.
"It's a lot more serious than a bingo game," Matsch said.
By renumbering the jurors, Matsch is creating an anonymous
jury because reporters and the public will not be able to link indi
viduals with answers they gave during questioning.
Most who made the final pool from which the jury was selected
were white and well-educated and have ties to the military. They
remembered the bombing, but few recalled details of the evidence
against McVeigh.
Clinton expands pollution regulations
WASHINGTON (AP) — Recycling a proposal from last year,
President Clinton marked Earth Day by expanding an "early
warning system" for reporting release of toxic chemicals in the
environment.
Under new rules for the decade-old "Community Right to
Know" law, seven additional industries and 6,100 new industrial
facilities will be forced to report to the public the levels of toxic
chemicals they release into the air, water and land.
"By expanding community right-to-know, we're giving Ameri
cans a powerful, very powerful early-warning system to keep their
children safe from toxic pollution," the president said. "We're giv
ing them the most powerful tool in a democracy — knowledge."
Clinton scrapped a planned Earth Day appearance in Washing
ton to travel to the flood-ravaged upper Midwest. Before depart
ing for Grand Forks, N. 1)., he outlined the regulations for
reporters and wondered aloud whether global warming was to
blame for this year's severe floods.
"We do not know for sure that the warming of the earth is
responsible . . . but many people believe that it is and we have to
keep looking into it," Clinton said.
