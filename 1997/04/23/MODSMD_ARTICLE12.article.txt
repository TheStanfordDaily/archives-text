# Peru crisis ends as hostages are freed
## In daring move, government troops invade rebel stronghold 
### 
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Amid gunfire and
explosions, Peruvian forces stormed the rebel
held Japanese ambassador's residence yester
day and pulled dozens of hostages to safety.
Jubilant soldiers ripped the rebels' flag from
the compound roof.
Local news media estimated that at least 30
of the 72 hostages had been taken out of the
compound. Peruvian Foreign Minister Fran
cisco Tudela, one of the hostages, was carried
out on a stretcher.
Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, also a
hostage, smiled and waved from an ambulance
at a police hospital. Local radio reported that
Aoki was wounded, but did not say how seri
ous his injuries were.
Several soldiers also were wounded in the
raid and were carried out on stretchers.
Occasional explosions continued for about a

half hour as the military played martial music
to celebrate its victory through loudspeakers
set up outside the residence. Soldiers cheered
and punched their fists in the air.
Smoke billowed from the roof of the com
pound, where about 15 guerrillas of the Tupac
Amaru rebel movement have been holding 72
hostages since they stormed a cocktail party to
mark the Japanese emperor's birthday Dec.
17.
Peruvian and Japanese news media report
ed yesterday that all of the leftist rebels had
been killed during the assault.
The raid was carried out by Peruvian
troops, who poured into the compound
through the front gate. For weeks, the diplo
matic residence has been guarded only by
police. It was not immediately clear when the
troops moved into position for the assault, or

what triggered their attack.
A huge explosion rocked the building at
3:39 p.m. (1:39 p.in. PDT) and smoke poured
out from the compound. Ambulances rushed
to the scene, and a police helicopter was in the
air.
Soldiers in uniform aimed their weapons
from the roofs of the compound and from
neighboring buildings.
A local television station reported as many
as 80 soldiers had entered the compound, but
that report could not be confirmed.
The leftist rebels seized hundreds of
hostages on Dec. 17 during a party at the resi
dence. Most hostages were released over the
next few days. But the rebels continued to hold
12 men to press the government to release
hundreds of their jailed comrades.
The government refused to release any
jailed rebels, and direct negotiations to end t h<>
standoff peacefully broke down on March 12.
The hostage crisis had sparked a political
crisis in Peru as well, and Peru's interior min
ister and national police chief stepped down
over the weekend to accept blame for security
lapses that allowed the takeover.
President Alberto Fujimori said Monday
that there was no crisis in his government,
despite resignations.
"They're saying all over the place that this
restructuring (of the Cabinet) reflects a con
flict inside the government," Fujimori said.
"There's no such conflict."
Interior Minister Juan Brumes, an army
general, said when he resigned that he and
police commander I it. Gen. Antonio Ketin
Vidal were assuming political responsibility
for the hostage crisis, now into its fifth mont h.
The pair was replaced by hard-line army
generals Cesar Saucedo and Fernando Dian
deras, who were named interior minister and
national police chief, respectively.
Many people gathered yesterday at a near
by military hospital where many of the wound
ed were taken said the government had no
choice but to attack.
"We're here to applaud the hostages and
police for their bravery," Edith Gonzalez said.
