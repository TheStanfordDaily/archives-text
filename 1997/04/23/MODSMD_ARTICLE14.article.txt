New Tresidder fitness
facility will well serve
the recreational athlete

DEAN OF STUDENTS Marc
Wais seemed to have a mis
sion from the moment he
stepped onto Stanford's campus —
to increase traffic at Tresidder
Union and to make it more of a
"hub of student activity." There is
little doubt that the recent restau
rant additions have made Tresidder
a much more booming place.
Presumably campus unions
should reflect student desires and
concerns, and certainly Jamba
Juice and Polio's meet this
demand. Moreover, the Tresidder
Advisory Board's recent decision to
include an athletic facility in
Tresidder's last vacant spot should
be applauded as a sign that the
University is willing to listen to the
campus's concerns.
The Stanford community has
complained for years that the ath
letic facilities on campus are not
only inadequate in terms of the
available hours but also house poor
quality equipment in comparison to
the facilities of other universities.
Compelling arguments have
been made in the past few years
that the current facilities in Ford
Center, Arrillaga Family Sports
Center and Roble Gym cater to
the varsity athletes' needs. The
gyms are open mainly for Stan
ford team athletes during the
prime afternoon hours.
It is pleasant to see that the advi
sory board recognized this need and
is willing to delegate a somewhat
unconventional location to support
it. The proposed facility will be
located in the space that Pulse cur
rently occupies in Tresidder Union.
According to Wais, the 2,930-
square-foot recreation area will
address three central student and
faculty athletic concerns: cardio
vascular fitness, weight training

and lack of space for activities
such as aerobics.
In addition to equipment such
as Stairmasters, Lifecycles and
several Nautilus machines, a sepa
rate activities space that might be
reserved for group activities like
aerobics will be included in the
facility, and use of it will be free. It
is important, though, for the Uni
versity to take care of the
machines after they've been
installed to ensure the facility
remains top-notch.
Although the proposal is far from
finalized and funding is far from
secure, Wais has predicted that the
empty space will be occupied by the
first day of fall quarter classes.
Certainly Tresidder is a rather
odd location for a athletic facility.
The term "bizarre" has even been
used to describe the new situation
— a coffee house, a copy center, a
Mexican restaurant, a ticket office,
a juice bar and ... a gym.
Even Wais admits that the
combination of facilities may be
"unusual compared to other uni
versities." Nevertheless, Tresid
der's central location ensures
that the new facility will be well
used — regardless of Tresidder's
other tenants.
For the sake of the poor, unsus
pecting diner just wanting to enjoy
some fast-food fare, the facility
will hopefully be isolated enough
so that other Tresidder customers
will not be required to watch peo
ple sweating over the Stairmaster
during their excursions to Tresid
der. The athletic facility should be
designed in a way that will not sac
rifice student and staff enjoyment
of other Tresidder businesses. In
other words, the all-window layout
of Arrillaga would not be appropri
ate for Tresidder.
The proposal will undergo a
thorough review in the coming
months and all of the specific
details will be ironed out then.
During this time, the board must
listen to the community's athletic
needs, just as it has done so
admirablv thus far.
