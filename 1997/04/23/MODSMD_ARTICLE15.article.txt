'True leadership'at stake in ASSUelection validation

I AM EXTREMELY upset after read
ing The Daily's Tuesday editorial
encouraging the ASSU Senate to vali
date the election.
The editorial makes the assertion
that another election would not serve
the "interests of the entire University."
I do not believe that allowing the valida
tion of an election whose outcome is
seriously in doubt serves the interests of
the Stanford community at all. In fact, it
is quite detrimental.
Trust of the ASSU has long been an
issue among students, especially regard
ing our elected representatives. As it
stands now, the 1997 election process
has made the students even more dis
trustful. Mistakes were made; that I can
understand. Nothing and nobody can be
expected to be perfect, and the Elections

Commission has worked very hard.
But trust is built when the involved
parties stand up, acknowledge their
errors and take strong, decisive action to
fix the problems. That is true leadership.
That is what I expect from ASSU offi
cials. Anything short of guaranteeing the
fairness of this election will further serve
to lower the students' trust of the ASSU.
The Daily's editorial correctly points
out that every group's votes is critical to
an election. This ASSU presidential elec
tion has shown us that every individual
vote is critical as well.
The editorial also examines a long list
of ASSU constitutional issues surround
ing this year's election, specifically with
regard to the votes from Oxford. The
Daily places the highest premium on fol
lowing the constitution in its elucidation

of the errors committed. But then turns
that argument 180 degrees and says that
since there was a 25-point margin of vic
tory, we do not need another election.
How can The Daily proclaim the sanctity
of the ASSU Constitution in one para
graph and then callously toss it to the
wind in the next one?
According to The Daily's logic, every
piece of the const itution should be fol
lowed. This includes a runoff election in
the event that a candidate not receive the
necessary 50 percent of the vote. It is
unclear that the leading candidate in this
election got 50 percent of the total votes
cast by Stanford students.
The editorial goes on to say, "Even
the presidential runners-up are not chal
lenging the election." Come on. Are you
kidding? Any attempt by Jim Finsten or

Howard Loo to make such a public state
ment would appear as sour grapes.
The Daily would like very much for its
endorsed candidate to be elected presi
dent of the ASSU â€” and I'm not talking
about The Daily's faith in Emily Andrus'
leadership capabilities. To this end, The
Daily has an interest in seeing the ASSU
Senate validate the election.
Finally, The Daily editorial says,
"Another election would make the entire
ASSU seem particularly ridiculous in
administration and student eyes." You
are wrong; it looks ridiculous now. I
want to trust the ASSU. Students and
administration will respect sincere effort
to correct these mistakes and ensure a
fair election. That is true leadership.
