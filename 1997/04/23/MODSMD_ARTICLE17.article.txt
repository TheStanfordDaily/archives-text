## Power for the forgotten 
### 
LAST WEEK, I went to a public hear
ing in San Francisco to listen to the
testimonials of more than 30
women, mostly prostitutes and strippers,
testifying about the brutality they had
experienced as sex workers. They talked
about brutalization and rape at the hands
of clients and cops. They talked about how
they were victimized, arrested, beaten,
ignored, harassed, stereotyped, criminal
ized, imprisoned and left for dead. They
talked and talked because for once, people
were listening to them. And most of them
said, without hesitation, that decriminaliz
ing prostitution would be the first step
toward improving prostitutes' lives.
Do laws against sex work dehumanize
prostitutes? Would decriminalization
empower sex workers, or would it simply
legalize one of the most insidious forms of
violence against women? And why should
Stanford students care?
The decriminalization debate is not new.
Margo St. James, an internationally known
prostitutes' rights advocate, founded COY
OTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) in
1973. Since then, groups advocating legal
ization have sprouted up nationally and
internationally, year, San Francisco
considered a measure that would decrimi
nalize sex work, but it was struck down —
as were similar measures in New York,
Toronto, San Diego and Miami.
But decriminalization deserves a seri
ous look. As long as prostitutes remain
criminals, they run a higher risk of being

brutalized and raped by johns and police
officers, and they are far less likely to
report the abuse. Some street prostitutes
are raped eight to 10 times a year or more,
but only 4 percent report the rape to police,
mainly for fear of recrimination. Because
prostitutes are criminals, they are not
worth protecting in society's eyes. In the
Los Angeles Police Department, crimes
against prostitutes are referred to by the
acronym NHI — No Humans Involved.
We should reverse laws that prioritize
enforcement over health and social ser
vices. These women need education, jobs,
health care and substance abuse counsel
ing, not jail. Criminalization only exacer
bates violence and drug abuse and further
marginalizes prostitute women. In legal
ized venues — strip clubs, phone sex
switchboards and erotic films — sex work
ers have recently unionized and have
taken legal recourse against exploitative
management. I think prostitutes should be
empowered to do the same.
It is a great irony that while prostitutes
are continually targeted by law enforce
ment officials, their customers hardly ever
are. Instead of penalizing prostitutes for
doing what they have to do to survive, we
should be penalizing abusive johns and
pimps. We should ensure that women who
engage in the world's oldest profession
have the rights of any other profession —
health services, education, job placement
and recourse to the law to punish those
who threaten them.

The hearing was a wake-up call for
me, especially as it came in the middle of
Herstory and Rape Awareness Week here
at Stanford. When we discuss images of
women in the media, in exploitative porn
magazines and movies, I think we tend to
forget sometimes that the women in
them are real people. Like it or not, sex
work is their job. We sometimes forget,
too, that porn and prostitution are the
only industries in which the pay gap is in
women's favor.
I think that the sex industry is one of
the symptoms of a sexist society, and I cer
tainly don't want to legally sanction the
abuse that many prostitutes experience. I
do believe, however, that part of the prob
lem lies in our society's attitudes towards
sex: Sex is seen as nasty and dirty and
shameful, and sex workers are treated to
that stigma every day. In an ideal world, no
one would have to sell sex for money. But
in the real world, a lot of people are doing
whatever they can to survive. These
women deserve to be treated fairly. They
deserve services and respect. And decrimi
nalization might just be the way to do it.

thought and literature, encourages every

and think about ways we can improve
women's lives.
