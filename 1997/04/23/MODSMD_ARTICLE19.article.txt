# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Why stop at Oxford? Why not screw everybody?

"We decided that any votes east by those
students wouldn't he counted."
— ASSU Elections Commissioner
Ghazal Badiozamani
THAT'S THE ONE really idiotic
part about elections — the fact
that you have to count everybody.
Ghazal Badiozamani had it right when
she decided that the 53 students who
made the fateful decision to attend Stan
ford in Oxford were not only destined to
eat British food for months but also were
not worthy enough to cast votes in last
week's ASSU election.
Besides, as she told The Daily over the
weekend, "The number of Oxford voters
was so small that I didn't think I their
votes) would make a difference."
I mean, someone's got to decide who
should and shouldn't he counted, right?
Think about it. It makes perfect sense to
ignore Oxford. First of all, they are in an
entirely different country. And, if that
weren't enough, the "Fated 53" would
have been attempting to vote from not
just a different country but from a coun

try we beat the crap out of 200 years ago
so they wouldn't have any say in our elec
tions. But why stop at Oxford? Personal
ly, I think there are plenty of other
groups of Stanford students that we
should exclude in addition to the "Fated
53" over in jolly ol' England.
llow about English majors? I don't
think English majors should get to vote
in the elections because they read too
much. I mean, seriously, with all that Poe
and Dickinson and Chaucer running
around their analytical little brains, do
you think they could find the time to
understand the issues? I'm sure Badioza
mani would back me up here — their
votes would probably not even "make a
difference." Besides, English majors
should be looking for jobs, not spending
all their time voting.
I think we should exclude political sci
ence majors as well because politics is
what they study every quarter. Poli sci
majors probably know too much about
the elections anyway, and they would just
make the rest of us look bad for failing to
pass "Climbing Wall B."

I think we should also not allow votes
from guys named Rusty. I once knew this
guy named Rusty in second grade, and he
was the kind of guy who would eat any
thing he could get his hands on —
erasers, chalk, paper, glue. You name it,
and good old Rusty would scarf it down. I
thought it was cool at the time, but look
ing back I think it's pretty disgusting.
Therefore, I think any Rustys (Rusties?)
on campus should be completely barred
from the election process.
Stupid people should also not be able
to vote. There are enough stupid people
in politics to begin with; we obviously
don't need even more stupid people vot
ing to get them into office. The ASSU
should appoint a Stupid People Com
mittee to go to each dorm and find out
who should be placed on the "Stupid
List," so that the elections commission
er can decide which votes are deemed
"stupid" and shouldn't he counted. But
no worries, those on the Stupid List
don't deserve to vote anyway, and I'm
sure, after all, they wouldn't "make a
difference."

Freshmen shouldn't vote either
because some of them aren't even old
enough to buy cigarettes. And seniors
shouldn't vote since they aren't even
going to he here next year to pay for
Climbing Wall A. Juniors shouldn't vote
because they should be studying, and
sophomores shouldn't vote because
sophomore means "wise fool" in (Jreek,
and I think anything (Jreek shouldn't
get to vote because I don't like feta
cheese.
So I guess that rides out fraternities
and sororities, too. And how about
other student organizations? Anyone
involved in the arts shouldn't be count
ed either because they are too "artsy."
Anyone involved in the sciences
shouldn't be counted because they are
too "sciencey." Anyone in a "club"
should he clubbing and anyone in a
"sport" should he sporting. People
already in the ASSIJ Senate shouldn't
be able to vote because they vote all (he
time and if they voted I'd have to read
another article about it on the front
page of The Daily.

Graduate students? Come on, grad
students need to be doing those things
that grad students do that takes up their
time and keeps them from doing those
things that the rest of us undergraduates
are doing. Besides, their votes wouldn't
"make a difference."
I guess that just leaves just antisocial
coterms who are neither overseas,
English majors, political science majors,
Greek, named Rusty or stupid enough to
make it onto (he Stupid List.
Or instead, we could pay attention to
the rules in something as basic as an elec
tion and make sure that no votes are
counted before everyone eligible to vote is
given the opportunity to vote.
But that would've been too easy. And
besides, it probably wouldn't have made
a difference.

Jeremy Desmon, a senior majoring in
public policy, should never have been
allowed to vote.
