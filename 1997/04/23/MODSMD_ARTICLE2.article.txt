Asst. Biology Prof. Liqun Luo
and Asst. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Nick McKeown each received
a prestigious fellowship last week
that will support them in research
at the frontiers of their respective
fields.
Awarded by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the research fellow
ship gives two-year, $35,000
grants to 100 young faculty mem
bers every year on the basis of their
promise to contribute to the ad
vancement in the fields of science
and economics.
Twenty-one past recipients of
the award have received Nobel
prizes, while hundreds of other
Sloan Fellows have attained vari
ous other prestigious awards and
honors.
This year's Sloan Fellows — av
eraging 32 years of age — repre
sent 49 institutions in the United
Suites and Canada and were nomi
nated by department chairs and
other senior scholars familiar with
their respective fields.
"The goal is to really support
the development of the most
promising young candidates," said
John Hennessy, dean of the School
of Engineering and a member of
the fellowship's committee that re
views nominees.
Commenting that the Sloan

grant is "competitive and tough to
win," Hennessy said McKeown's
outstanding research plans and let
ter of recommendations, together
with the prominence of his field,
made the young faculty member an
ideal candidate for the fellowship.
McKeown, a leading figure in
high-speed communications, is
currently heading a project that
aims to build a new high-tech net
work switchboard. With his prior
experience working in the net
working industry, McKeown's re
search has received wide attention
from both the academic and indus
trial fields.
The grant "will fund some of my
new ideas" on the next genera
tion's 1 nternet and high-speed net
works, McKeown said. "I'm de
signing ideas which will reduce
congestion on the Internet."
Luo, a biological scientist spe
cializing in elementary neurology,
said winning the award was a great
way to get his research going at
Stanford.
"I just started at Stanford a few
months ago," Luo said. "A lot of
people who have received the
award in the past have done well.
It's good to hear that I got it."
Luo added that the money from
theSloan Foundation will help him
purchase new equipment for his
current research which focuses on
how neurons communicate with
each other to form the brain.
