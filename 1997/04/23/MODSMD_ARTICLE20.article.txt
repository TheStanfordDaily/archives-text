## Starbird says Seattle's best Hoops star inks ABL deal 
### Robin Davidson Ed Guzman Senior staff writers 
Their Stanford careers are over and, starting now,
their respective professional careers are taking very dif
ferent turns.
Stanford senior basketball star Kate Starbird
announced yesterday that she has signed an exclusive
three-year contract with the American Basketball
League. Starbird's announcement comes just one day
after senior teammate Jamila Wideman announced her
decision to sign with the Women's National Basketball
Association and represents the ongoing struggle
between the two leagues to obtain the nation's top col
legiate players.
"I think the ABL has reached new heights," ABL
CEO Gary Cavalli said of signing Starbird. "We're
thrilled to have one of the most talented and exciting
players in the world.
"With the two leagues starting up, we are both com
peting for some of the best players. But there's only one
national player of the year, only one Naismith Award
winner and only one Kate Starbird."
Starbird's decision may have something to do with
playing in familiar territory, as the Tacoma, Wash.,
native has signed to play for the Seattle Reign. Starbird
said both leagues "had nice things to offer," but the
final decision hinged at least partially on the ABL's
more conventional, lengthier winter season (40 games)
as opposed to the WNBA's shortened summer schedule
(28 games).
"I would rather play more basketball," Starbird said.
"I would like to spend the majority of the year plnving.
This league has a year under its belt. They have lots of
great players, and I was really impressed with the com
petition level they showed."
Starbird leaves Stanford and heads to the AB L as
one of the most decorated players in Cardinal history.
In addition to being named the 1997 Naismith player of
the year, she was twice awarded the Pacific 10 Confer
ence player of the year and was the top receiver of votes
for this year's Associated Press All-America team.
"Everyone who has seen Kate Starbird play realizes
what a fantastic basketball player she is," Cavalli said.
"And everyone who's had an opportunity to meet Kate
knows what an outstanding individual she is as well.
There's no mistaking that she is the top graduating
senior women's player this season. We're thrilled that
she has made a three-year commitment to the premier
women's basketball league in the world."
Starbird is Stanford's all-time leading scorer and
owns just about every major scoring record in school
history including most points in a single season (753)
and a single game (44). This season she guided the Card

to its third straight Final Four
while averaging 20.1 points per
game and shooting better than 50
percent from the field.
"This is a big step for us," Cav
alli said. "Kate Starbird was a play
er we had to have. She will certain
ly be a tremendous draw here and
around the ABL. It's a great day
for Seattle and the ABL."
The terms of the deal were not
disclosed, but Cavalli said Star
bird's contract was equal to those
of other top players in the league
and were "numbers one would

expect a college player of the year
to get."
Starbird seemed equally pleased
not only with her contract but with
the opportunity to return to her
home to continue her basketball
career.
"I'm really excited to be in Seat
tle," Starbird said. "I'm really
happy to be coming back.
"The Bay Area fans have been
great, and I loved my four years at
Stanford. But I feel at home in the
Seattle-Tacoma area. It's going to
be fun to be playing in front of my
hometown, and I feel I'm a good fit
for the team and the organization
in Seattle. I still love the San Jose
area, so it's going to be exciting to
come back and play the Lasers."
