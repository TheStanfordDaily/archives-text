# Beavers chew up crew at Redwood Shores
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
Hard breathing, aching legs and
bowed heads were a common sight for
the Stanford crew team after its meet
against Oregon State this weekend.
The Beavers came down to the
waters of Redwood Shores and swept
the Cardinal crew in all divisions.
"We had a good day racing," said Ore

gon State coach David Reischman. "It is
always a good opportunity to race a crew
like Stanford, and we are a little bit for
tunate that we won."
Reischman credits the victories this
weekend to a good week of practices for
all of his crews. However, he is still care
ful with complacency before the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
"We expect Stanford to be faster as
Pac-lOs come around," e said.

Beaver varsity captain Robert Carter
also enjoyed the win, which brought the
senior's career dual-meet record to 3-1
against Stanford.
"It was a nice win," Carter said. "We
enjoyed the competition we have against
Stanford since wo look forward to this
race every year."
While the Beavers were celebrating
their victory this weekend, the Stanford
oarsmen had their minds set on the

upcoming Pac-lOs, less than a month
away in Sacramento, Calif.
"I was pretty disappointed about last
weekend, but we've been working hard
and did not taper for the weekend so
obviously the work has taken its toll,"
said men's novice coach Josh Burgel.
"However, we are still looking forward
to Pac-lOs, where we will be tapered,
rested, ready and much better."
Despite the loss, men's head
coach Wieslaw Kujda was very
pleased with the novices' perfor
mance this weekend.
"Definitely the novice eight did
the best this weekend," Kujda said.
However, Kujda was disappoint
ed with the varsity's efforts Satur
day morning.
"We have to prove to ourselves
â€” either we can row really bad or
we can row really well. It's a matter
of a choice," Kujda said. "If we
choose to row well, we will get up
with Oregon State and Cal and
have a chance at a title; if we
choose to row bad, we will be in
fourth place with Gonzaga."
On the women's side, head
coach Aimee Baker was pleased
with the efforts put up by the
junior varsity and novice women
this weekend.
"I think that the JV and the
novice, according to their times,
have made good improvements [of

10 seconds] and the boats are mov
ing well," Baker said.
Like Kujda, B.iker and the var
sity women were not so satisfied
about their showing this weekend
against Oregon State.
"The varsity women were disap
pointed since they had a scattered
race and couldn't settle down,"
Baker said. "This week we are
emphasizing settling right off the
start and most importantly build
ing the team confidence back up."
Although the Beavers placed a
dam in the seasons of both varsity
squads and the novice men, the
Cardinal rowers still have their
heads up since, as Baker said,
"Nothing matters until Pac-lOs."
In crew, the Pac-10 champi
onship determines the final rank
ings for the league squads. The
Pac-lOs also determine who will
move on to the nationals, while the
purpose of the dual meets and invi
tationals are to give the coaches a
sense of where they are before the
big one.
And the Cardinal crews are
working double practices almost
every day for the next two weeks
toward the championships May 18.
