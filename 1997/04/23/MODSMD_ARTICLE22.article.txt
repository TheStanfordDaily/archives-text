In a weekend full of tough matches, freshman Geoff
Abrams emerged as the only Stanford player unscathed,
winning all four of his matches against USC and No. 1
UCLA. On Friday, Abrams teamed up with senior Grant
Elliott to score the only Cardinal doubles win before
cruising past the Trojans' Kyle Spencer in straight sets 6-
3, 6-2. In the main event against the Bruins the next day,
Abrams and Elliott once again brought home the only
doubles win. In his singles match, Abrams displayed poise
and perseverance, recovering from a tie-breaker loss in
the first set to pull out a win against Vincent Allegre and
bring the Cardinal within one match of victory.

Perhaps the most tolling praise of senior All-American
Katie Schlukebir would be simply to say that her play
this week was no different than in any other. I he top
ranked singles player in the nation displayed her usual
dominance in Los Angeles, dispatching a pair of oppo
nents without dropping enough games to lose a single
set. Against USC Friday, she crushed Kva Jimenez 6-3,
6-2, and Saturday's encore performance was similarly
masterful as she nearly blanked UCLA's Annica Cooper
6-1, 6-0.
