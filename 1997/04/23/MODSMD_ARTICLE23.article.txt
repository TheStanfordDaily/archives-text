In last night's game at Sunken Diamond,
Stanford baseball had more to fear from the
inclement weather and threatening clouds
than hapless opponents.
I lowever, the rain held off long enough to
allow Stanford (30-13, 14-7 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) and junior pitcher
Josh Koons to roll to a 9-3 victory against
Sacramento State (13-32, 6-16 Big West Con
ference Northern Division).
The lopsided win helped Stanford get its
offensive house in order by slamming 13 hits
and scoring nine runs in the victory over the
slumping Hornets.
"It was nice to get some runs," said head
coach Mark Marquess, "especially after Sun
day's game against UCLA."
Stanford lost 5-3 in Sunday's contest.
Sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut
explained Stanford's hitting slump sis just the
nature of the game.
"All teams go through cycles of slow hitting
during the season," Gerut said. "We happened
to be going through one when we hit UCIA
this weekend."
But Stanford quickly led behind the slow
hitting woes, jumping on the scoreboard first
in the bottom of the second. With one out,
senior first baseman Luke Quaccia slammed
the ball deep into left-center field. The ball
rolled to the wall as Quaccia slid into second for
a double.
After sophomore Josh Hochgesang flew
out, freshman designated hitter .John
slapped a pitch into short right for a solid sin
gle. Quaccia scored easily to take the wrapping
off the game 1-0.
Hut the Cardinal held off until the third
