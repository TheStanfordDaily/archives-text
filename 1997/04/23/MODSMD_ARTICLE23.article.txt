# Koons shuts down CSUS
## 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
In last night's game at Sunken Diamond,
Stanford baseball had more to fear from the
inclement weather and threatening clouds
than hapless opponents.
I lowever, the rain held off long enough to
allow Stanford (30-13, 14-7 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) and junior pitcher
Josh Koons to roll to a 9-3 victory against
Sacramento State (13-32, 6-16 Big West Con
ference Northern Division).
The lopsided win helped Stanford get its
offensive house in order by slamming 13 hits
and scoring nine runs in the victory over the
slumping Hornets.
"It was nice to get some runs," said head
coach Mark Marquess, "especially after Sun
day's game against UCLA."
Stanford lost 5-3 in Sunday's contest.
Sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut
explained Stanford's hitting slump sis just the
nature of the game.
"All teams go through cycles of slow hitting
during the season," Gerut said. "We happened
to be going through one when we hit UCIA
this weekend."
But Stanford quickly led behind the slow
hitting woes, jumping on the scoreboard first
in the bottom of the second. With one out,
senior first baseman Luke Quaccia slammed
the ball deep into left-center field. The ball
rolled to the wall as Quaccia slid into second for
a double.
After sophomore Josh Hochgesang flew
out, freshman designated hitter .John
slapped a pitch into short right for a solid sin
gle. Quaccia scored easily to take the wrapping
off the game 1-0.
Hut the Cardinal held off until the third
inning to let everything fly at the
Hornets. Juniors Jay Pecci and Joe
Kilburg started things off by draw
ing walks off Hornet starter Kris
Reed (2-1).
The deluge began when Stan
ford caught a break on freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth's long
fly to center. Hornet center fielder
Eddie Taylor, badly misjudging the
hit, started to run in on the tower
ing fly. Taylor quickly halted and
started to backtrack.
Hut his dive backward at the
sinking pill was inches short, and
Muth's hit rolled to the wall for a
double, scoring Pecci from second
to raise the score to 2-0. Kilburg
was thrown out attempting to take
third from first.
With one out, Heed issued the
third walk of the inning to sopho
more center fielder Jody Gerut.
The next batter, junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer, made him regret it,
launching the hall over the right
center field fence for his team-high
10th home run of the season, scor
ing three more for Stanford to
bring the tillly to 5-0.
Hut Stanford was just warming
up. A walk to Quaccia and double
by sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang scored another. Two
straight singles by Gall and senior
left fielder Chris Clark scored the
final run of the inning, putting
Stanford ahead 7-0.
Stanford extended its lead to 9-0
in t he fourth against Hornet pitch
er Scott Merin. Muth beat out a
hard grounder to third, bringing
Gerut up to the plate for the second
time. I le didn't disappoint, sending
Merin's first offering into the night
sky over the right-field fence for his
sixth home run of the year.
Meanwhile, Koons (4-2) carved
through the Sacramento State line
up like it was a Thanksgiving
turkey. Koons was never threat
ened, giving up only two hits in five
innings of work.
Marquess is planning for Koons

to figure into the last three weeks
of the season.
"Koons is going to be able to help
us in long relief," he said. "It was a
good thing he got some work
tonight."
The Hornets got two runs back
in the top of the sixth off freshman
reliever Geoff Linville when second
baseman Harvey Hargrove hit his
22nd home run of the season, a
two-run shot that brought the Hor
nets to within seven at 9-2. The
Hornets scored another in the
eighth off sophomore Tony Cogan
to finish up the scoring at 9-3.
Despite the win, freshman out
fielder Nick Day was quick to look
past the game to focus on this
weekend's series with California.
"We basically need to win every
Six-Pac game we have left," Day
said. "Cal will be ready."
The Cardinal opens the series
Friday at 2:30 p.m. at Evans Dia
mond in Berkeley.
