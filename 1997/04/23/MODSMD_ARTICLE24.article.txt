## 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
The women's lacrosse squad faced n disappoint
ing defeat Saturday to California, losing 11-8. The
scoring was tight throughout the game, with Stan
ford coming within one goal of Cal in several
instances.
Stanford approached the game with u confident
attitude hut started off slowly. Because of incredi
ble pressure by the Golden Bear offense, Stanford
emerged from the first half trailing 6-3. One
unusual factor that dictated the Cardinal's weak
start was the field, which was turf instead of the
usual grass.
"The field took a lot of adjustment, since games;
on turf are much faster," said sophomore Carey
Jones. "Berkeley's speed advan
tage, plus the fact that they were
playing at home and had tons of
fans, got them out in front first."
Stanford picked up, however,
after the first half. Freshman
.Janet Lewis led the offense with
three hard earned goals against
Cal's tough defense. Sophomore
attack Alexis Patrizio dazzled the
fields with her ability, at one point
bringing her team within reach of a
win. An overall outstanding perfor
mance earned her two goals, two
assists and four ground ball recov
eries. Fellow offensive players
Hedy Born and Carey Jones each
stood out with scoring and all
around aggressive play.
The Cardinal's defense was led
by freshmen Cabby Duno and
Dana Katter, who both played

intense games. Duno's speed
allowed her to cover an enormous
ami as goalie, at times leaving her
post to aid the defense. Katter's
strategic defensive moves ham
pered Cal's efTorts on several occa
sions. Her stamina proved to be an
essential part of Stanford's defen
sive success.
But these efforts were not quite
enough.
"This was an incredibly disap
pointing loss for us," said assistant
coach Heidi Connor. "We have
everything it takes to beat this
team. I guess we will just have to
come out next Sunday ready to
prove that we can be the better
team."
This game places Stanford third
in the Western Women's Lacrosse
League going into the playoffs. The
team heads to UC-I )avis for rounds
one and two of the playoffs Satur
day. Stanford will first challenge
UC-Santa Cruz and then face a
rematch with ('al.
