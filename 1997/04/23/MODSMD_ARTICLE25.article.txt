# Macho golfers are the new craze on the links
## 
### 
Show me a man who says golf
is not a real sport, and I'll
.show you one truly had
golfer.

Golf is one tough game to play,
but it's long been characterized as
a shi-shi sport. It's not a game of
brute strength that requires you
to knock out your opponent silly
or that involves major lung power
resulting in profuse sweating,
grunting and panting.
Back in the 1970s Stanford
alumnus John Brodie, an avid
golfer, had a hard time getting his
friends to play golf with him. The
former San Francisco 49er start
ing quarterback, who also played
professional golf, couldn't got any
of his teammates to venture out
onto the links.

Nowadays, you can catch Joe
Montana chipping Titleists at the
Stanford driving range or Jerry
Rice playing a round at the
course.
Golf is a game of manicured
precision, detail and form. Most of
all, golf is a game of egos. It is a
mental game, a power trip, mak
ing it the king, nay, the Big
Bertha of macho sports.
But it is only recently that the
sissy, genteel golfer image has
given way to a new Mr. Cool
image, thanks to a former Stan'
ford golfer named Tiger Woods.
The sheer distance Woods can
hit his second shot on a par 5 with
a 9 iron while most pros require a
3-wood has inspired a new move
ment of macho golf.
(Jolf ain't just for plaid-panted
pops anymore.
The old image of potbellied
orthopedic surgeons smoking tor
pedo shaped stogies in one hand
and steering a golf cart in the
other is being replaced with a new
image of hip-hop listening, base
ball cap- wearing twentysome
things who say, "Dude, did ya see


Yi-Wyn
Yen
bow far I ripped my drive?"
These guys are the ones at the
driving range grabbing the club
like a baseball bat and squeezing
the grip so tight that their palms
redden and knuckles whiten.
"Guys just want to hit it far,"
said Stanford graduate student
Mike McDevitt, a former college
golf player at California. "I call
Igolf'l blastball because you can
take your caveman swing and get
it out there."
When McDevitt plays a friendly
round with friends, how far he
drives the dimpled ball becomes
an "ego thing."
"YVe all hit the ball about the
same distance," he said. "But as
we walk down the fairway, there's
a lot of discussion and taunting
about who hit the ball the far
thest. Your ego's on the line."
The macho culture of golf is
flourishing beyond the confines of
tin 4 course and driving range.
Everywhere you go, you can find
guys practicing their golf swing on
campus or stroking their chins in
class for that oh-so-pensive putter
look.
Just this weekend I was at a

party where a guy tried to impress
my friend and me. We were having
a pleasant conversation about the
last week's episode of "The X-
Files" when out of nowhere, he
busted out in a golf swing. Not
only were we not impressed, bis
left arm wasn't even straight.
Golf is a sport that transcends
all sports. Stanford football play
ers practice their drive on the
range during the offseason. The
assistant women's swimming
coach, Ross Garry, likes to prac
tice his swing on the pool deck
And Sadao Hamada, the men's
gymnastics coach, currently
teaches beginning golf on campus.
1 welcome the enthusiasm and
interest people find in the sport.
Hut as golf continues to grow
exponentially like a logarithmic
curve, 1 hope the bizarre machis
mo fad will die off.
You can drive your ball 250
yards, but it won't do you anv
good if you hit it in the creek.
In the macho world of golf, it is
a game about distance. But if you
want to score well, it is a game
about accuracy, consistency and
putting, putting, putting.
Now caddy, hand me my titani
um driver.

Yi-Wyn Yen denies she has a secret
stash of green jackets in her closet.
