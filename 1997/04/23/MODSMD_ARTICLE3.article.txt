# ASSU validates 1997 election
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
After a heated debate about the validity of the
presidential results from last week's spring gen
eral election, the ASSU Senate last night validat
ed by a 6-4-4 vote that the election procedures
were properly handled.
Discussion focused principally around the
disenfr;inchisement of 53 Stanford in Oxford
students and the issue of whether or not votes
for invalid write-in presidential slates should be
considered in tallying the total vote count.
Issues of possible campaign financing viola
tions by ASSU President-elect Emily Andrus
and ASSU Vice President-elect Ben Decker were
also explored. However, that discussion was
ended when it was determined the topic was not
relevant to the validation procedures.
Senior Jim Fincten, a presidential candidate

who was present at the meeting, said afterward,
"I believe that Ben and Emily have in their
minds broken no rules, and at this point... al
though there are some questions related to their
funding, I accept their word."
The senate considered the election validation
in four parts — validation of the presidential
race, of the senior class presidents race, of the
undergraduate senate and of "everything else."
The grouping was designed in this manner to ac
count for areas in which Oxford votes could have
affected the outcome.
The senate quickly ratified the items in the
"everything else" category, namely special fees,
graduate senate, amendments, the sophomore
and junior Judicial Charter and the Student
Conduct legislative Council.
However, debate over validation of the presi
dential election intensified when Senator Alane
Murdock introduced a bill that would have

forced a run-off election.
"My only purpose I in producing this bill] is to
find a solution to the problems we have to clear
up," Murdock said. "I think that if we just vali
date this election in spite of these questions that
it will really effect Emily and Ben's ability to run
a respected office. It is in the interest of the
ASSII to protect itself."
Senator Bruce (Jibney concurred with Mur
dock noting that "there was gross procedural
error."
Senator Joe Kreund countered such state
ments, noting t hat voter turnout is usually quite
low in run-off elections.
"(Mearly, the points that have Ixxmi raised are
debatable," Kreund said. "However, by doing the
election again, we will disenfranchise more Ipeo
ple| than we enfranchise and will reduce the le-
gitimacy of the election by calling a
second one."
ASSU President Bill Shen added
that while it may be an issue of le
gitimacy as concerning the require
ment of a majority of votes neces
sary to avoid a run-off, "the election
is not an issue of legitimacy in the
eyes of students."
Noting the complexity of the
issue involved. Senator Harris

Shapiro said, "We somehow have to
maintain legitimacy in spite of
gross procedural errors. I have
trouble forcingthe most convenient
possible solution in the face of the
most difficult possible terms for le
gitimization."
Gibney affirmed this notion
stating, "I don't buy arguments
about legitimacy and low voter
turnout. Itisnotan issue of expedi
ency; it is about right and wrong. In
the long term, it is better to be true
to what we've written down rather
than to work based on a whole lot of
flexible morals."

Senator Howard Loo, who came
in third in the presidential race, in
terjected, "What the hell are we
afraid of? Why don't we just throw
it back to the students? Why are we
afraid of the electorate?"
However, as the evening wore
on, pressure to vote on the issue
mounted, culminating in the nar
row passage of the bill. Three sena
tors and ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson abstained.
The validation of the class presi
dents and the undergraduate senate
followed. The senate will next need to
certify the election in a later meeting.

The senate also voted to add to
one validation bill an amendment
drafted by Senate Chair Don Aing
worth and Loo to censure The Stan
ford Daily for "maliciously withhold
ing information regarding the status
of Oxford votes and for placing bets
on the outcome of the elections."
Editor in Chief Elizabeth Gold
man said there was "absolutely no
malicious intent on the part of The
Daily in any election coverage.
"If The Daily suffers attacks as
part of fulfilling our responsibility
as a newspaper, we accept that,"
she said.
