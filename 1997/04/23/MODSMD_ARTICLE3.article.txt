After a heated debate about the validity of the
presidential results from last week's spring gen
eral election, the ASSU Senate last night validat
ed by a 6-4-4 vote that the election procedures
were properly handled.
Discussion focused principally around the
disenfr;inchisement of 53 Stanford in Oxford
students and the issue of whether or not votes
for invalid write-in presidential slates should be
considered in tallying the total vote count.
Issues of possible campaign financing viola
tions by ASSU President-elect Emily Andrus
and ASSU Vice President-elect Ben Decker were
also explored. However, that discussion was
ended when it was determined the topic was not

Senior Jim Fincten, a presidential candidate

who was present at the meeting, said afterward,

affected the outcome.
The senate quickly ratified the items in the
"everything else" category, namely special fees,
graduate senate, amendments, the sophomore
and junior Judicial Charter and the Student
Conduct legislative Council.

"My only purpose I in producing this bill] is to
find a solution to the problems we have to clear
up," Murdock said. "I think that if we just vali
date this election in spite of these questions that
it will really effect Emily and Ben's ability to run
a respected office. It is in the interest of the
ASSII to protect itself."
Senator Bruce (Jibney concurred with Mur
dock noting that "there was gross procedural
error."
Senator Joe Kreund countered such state
ments, noting t hat voter turnout is usually quite
low in run-off elections.
"(Mearly, the points that have Ixxmi raised are
debatable," Kreund said. "However, by doing the
election again, we will disenfranchise more Ipeo
