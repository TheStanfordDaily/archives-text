# Tourney honors former brother

Amid the warmth of a summer
day in 1994, former Stanford stu
dent and Sigma Chi pledge Bart
McCormick quietly died in his
home in Carmel, Ind. Monday, as
the sun graced the links of the
Stanford Golf Course, members of
the Alpha Omega Chapter of the
Sigma Chi fraternity honored their
late brother by sponsoring the
third annual Bart J. McCormick
Memorial Golf Tournament.
McCormick suffered from
osteogenic sarcoma, a form of can
cer which originated on the bone of
his leg during his 10th grade. The
cancer later metastasized to
McCormick's lungs, intensifying
the painful chemotherapy treat
ments, femur and knee replace
ments, bone marrow transplants
and five lung surgeries.
Throughout the heartbreaking
disappointment of the failed surg
eries, McCormick maintained a
positive determinism and ready
smile, matriculating into Stanford
in the fall of 1993 and pledging
Sigma Chi in the spring of 1994.
"Everybody loved him," said
Gavin Turner, Class of '96, a close
friend of McCormick's and former
Sigma Chi. Turner readily recalled
McCormick's ebullience and pas
sion for life.
"We had a formal spring quar
ter our freshman year," Turner
said. "He sort of danced the night
away. You would have never
known this was a guy with lung

cancer. He was so happy."
When news of McCormick's
death reached Turner later that
summer, he and his fellow brothers
at Sigma Chi organized to establish
the tournament, which benefits
cancer research at the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital.
The first year the tournament
was held at the Palo Alto Municipal
Golf Course and about 25 golfers
participated. By contrast, this
year's tournament attracted 100
people and garnered $5,000.
Putting on this golf tournament
"takes a tremendous amount of
time," said junior Mike Axt.
Axt and his fraternity brothers
spent more than two months orga
nizing the tournament, making
numerous phone calls to potential
sponsors, asking for prize dona
tions, registering golfers, publiciz
ing the event and overseeing the
setup for the tournament.
The excitement of the success of
this year's event was shared by
representatives from the hospital.
"We are most appreciative of the
tremendous efforts made by the
tournament's organizers ... to
make this year's tournament the
most successful ever," said Mau
reen O'Donnell of the Corporate
Development ()ffice at the hospital.
"I thought it was a great day,"
said senior Conrad Ray, a member
of the golf team and one of three
Sigma Chis who played Monday.
"I've played all three years. It's
changed a lot but I think for the
better. Hopefully, we can continue
(the tournament] in the future."
