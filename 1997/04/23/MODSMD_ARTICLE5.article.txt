# Program to send volunteers to Haiti
## Tet Ansanm brings attention to issues involving violence-ridden country 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
In a program inspired by the vision of I laitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, three Stan
ford students will spend this summer volunteer
ing in Haiti in the Tet Ansanm Haiti-U.S.A.
Summer Delegation.
During his visit to Northern California in
1994, Aristide suggested the possibility of a stu
dent con? to work with grass roots organizations
in Haiti, said the Rev. Herb Schmidt of Universi
ty Lutheran Church.

In February 1995, Schmidt
and leaders of other college min
istries went to Haiti. With tin;
help of high-ranking I laitian of
ficials, they "decided to go for it"
and organize Tet Ansanm.
Tet Ansanm which means
"heads together" in Haitian
Creole — is a group students
from Stanford, UC-Davis, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz and

Santa Clara University. Fourteen students will
be participating in this summer's program.

Last year's delegation met, with Aristide
twice.
"Aristide himself has taken a personal inter
est in this project," Schmidt said.
Students spend their first 10 days in Haiti
going through orientation. They meet with dif
ferent government and grassroots organizations
in t he capital and make at least one t rip to the
countryside.
"Rural life really permeates the national psy
che," Schmidt said. I leestimated that 70 percent


Schmidt
of Haiti's population lives in rural
areas.
Most of the students' work in
Haiti involves participating in in
ternships in health care, agricul
ture, reforestation, child care, jour
nalism and human rights.
Senior Rose Ducasse, Tet
Ansanm's student coordinator,
spent the summer after her sopho
more year working at a health clin
ic vaccinating women and children
in the Haitian countryside. Twice a
week, she would walk two hours
over hilly terrain to the vaccination
site. She said 200 to 300 people
would be waiting in line for their
vaccinations by the time she ar
rived .
Participants are strongly en
couraged to learn Haitian Creole
before their trip. Stanford alumnus
Paul Namphy, who has participat
ed in the delegation the past two
summers, is currently teaching a
course in Creole on campus.
In addition to overcoming a lan
guage barrier, students must also
help raise tin; $2,000 it costs for

each student to participate in the
program.
"Tet Ansanm is a secular effort,
but we do receive a lot of support
from religious groups spanning the
religious spectrum," Namphy said.
Other campus organizations,
departments and dormitories have
helped students in their fund-rais
ing efforts.
Although Tet Ansanm is only
operational in five Bay Area
schools, its leaders talk of eventual
ly expanding the program nation
wide.
"Logistically, it would be a
nightmare," Schmidt said. "After
next year, we may extend [the pro
gram J out."
Recently, however, a wave of vi
olence has struck Haiti. The
group's organizers speculated that
the violence was brought on by the
recent democratic elections.
"Even before the election,
things had subsided. That just
proves it was election-related,"
Ducasse said.
Nevertheless, the group will ex
ercise caution on its trip. If more vi
olence breaks out in Haiti within
one month of the July 5 departure
date, the trip may be canceled, ac
cording to Ducasse.

"The rural areas in Haiti tend to
be quite safe," Namphy said. "For
eigners are basically 99-percent im
mune to violence."
He added that violence is usual
ly directed toward other Haitians.
One of Tet Ansanm's primary
goals is to build solidarity between
young Americans and Haitians.
"It's also a consciousness-rais
ing experience for them. We work
to make Americans... more aware
of the problems our own govern
ment has helped to create,"
Schmidt said. "There is evidence
that the CIA actually knew of the
coup against Aristide. We have also
always been in a close relationship
with the ruling class, and this has
had a terrible influence on what
has happened over the years in
Haiti."
As part of their ongoing effort to
educate the Stanford community
on Haitian issues, Tet Ansanm,
along with other campus organiza
tions, will host Moise Jean-
Charles, the democratically elected
mayor of Milot, Haiti. Jean-
Charles has fought for land and po
litical reform through his member
ship in Mouvman Peyizan Milo or
the Movement of the Peasants of
Milot.

"He's trying to institutionalize
these changes. He's met with a lot
of resistance," Namphy said.
Two months ago, Jean-
Charles's office burned down.
Namphy said, It's clear that his po
litical opponents "were responsible
for this arson — people who do not
want change in Haiti...."
While in the United States,
Jean-Charles has plans to meet
with government, agricultural, re
ligious and tourist officials.
Jean-Charles will speak tonight
at the University Lutheran Church
at 7:30 to address "Justice, Peace
and Land: Alternative Develop
ment in Haiti."
Tomorrow, he will speak at
Bechtel International Center at
noon about grassroots participa
tion and political reform in Haiti.
Jean-Charles' final campus ap
pearance will be Tuesday at noon in
Bolivar House. He will speak on
Haitian administrative and land
reform.

istry at Stanford, the Peninsula
