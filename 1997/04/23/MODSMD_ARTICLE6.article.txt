# Dealing with rejection
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
Editor's note: The following is the fourth and final
article in an occasional series documenting the college
application process of an "average" high school senior
living in Silver Spring, Md. Katie Nelson, 18, applied to
Stanford last December and hoped to become a member
of the class of2ool.
Kiitie Nelson will not be kissed during Full Moon on
the Quad. She will not fall asleep in CIV, eat fro yo at the
CoPo, listen to lectures hy Philip Zimhardo or John
Taylor Join the Sixth Man club, jog up to the Dish or at
tend boat dances with some cheesy guy from I>arkin.
Recently denied admission to the class of 2001, Nel
son is disappointed but not devastated she will not at
tend Stanford. "I figure it could have gone either way,"
she said.
Although Nelson has a 3.97 grade-point average, a
combined score of 1,350 on her SAT and a slew of ex
tracurricular activities, the competition was stiffer this

year than it has been for a decade. According to the Of
fice of Admissions and Financial Aid, only 15.5 percent
of applicants, most of whom had even higher SAT
scores and CPAs than Nelson, gained acceptance.
After receiving the bad news from Stanford, Nelson
said, "I was really upset and got in my air and drove for
five or six hours, and then I was fine." She said she is
still not exactly sure where her drive took her. "I was
out in the farmlands," she said.
The rejection letter itself did little to assuage Nelson.
"It was just kind of mean," she said. "It was the curtest
letter I'd ever received. It basically said, 'Don't call, be
cause the decision is final.' " Nelson was also rejected
from Brown University but found Brown's letter less
harsh.
Accepted at Macalester College, VVesleyan Uni
versity, Rice University and the University of Mary
land and wait listed at Pomona College and Amherst
College, Nelson will probably attend Macalester.
However, in the last few months, she has become
increasingly interested in the idea of deferring accep

tance for a year, regardless of where she eventually en
rolls.
In this interim Ix'tween high school and college, she
would like to take classes in Quito, Ecuador. After
studying Spanish for four years, "1 want to learn how to
speak Spanish (fluently)," she said. "I've heard Quito is
the most beautiful place in the whole world. It's 10
miles from the equator and surrounded on all sides hy
volcanoes. I decided I want to climb a volcano."
A friend who works at the YMCA where Nelson is ;i
lifeguard has traveled to Quito several times and ex
tolled its virtues to her; additionally, two of her class
mates are originally from Guatemala and also have vis
ited Quito and spoken highly of it.
Nelson said her interest in deferring college is not re
lated to a wish to re-apply to schools. She visited
Macalester — located in Minnesota between St Paul
and Minneapolis — during the second week of April and
"absolutely fell in love with it," she said.
Yet, in a sentiment that seemed at odds with thepos
itive feelings she expressed about Macalester, Nelson

r e p e a t (• d 1 y
lamented the;
fact that she
thinks she
would he a
stronger col
lege applicant
now than she
was in the fall.
"Right now,
all of my activi
ties and all of
my interests
are starting to
come together
more what I

like, what I'm interested in. I feel like I could present
myself as a lx;tter package... I'm frustrated that
everything seems so clear to me now. My essay could !*■
