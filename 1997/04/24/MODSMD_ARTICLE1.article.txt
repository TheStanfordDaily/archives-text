'Everyone in America
feels personally
exempt from
advertising. But no
one escapes.'
— Jean Kilbourne

"Everyone in America feels per
sonally exempt from advertising,"
she said. "But no one escapes."
Kilbourne's speech and slide
presentation built on Herstory's
overall theme of "Women and
Image." Herstory is a series of pro
grams sponsored by the Women's
Coalition and the ASSU that this
year includes a line of film screen
ings, health workshops and infor
mative panels scheduled through
next Friday.
An open forum discussing Kil
bourne's speech will be held at
noon today in the Women's Center.
Kilbourne, who is nationally
recognized as a dynamic presenter
and was recently featured in The
New York Times Magazine as one
of the three most popular speakers
on college campuses today, cited
developments in popular culture
that suggest the influence of adver
tising over our daily lives.
"Elementary school kids swap
Absolut vodka ads as they do base
ball cards," Kilbourne said "Old
Joe Camel has become more recog
nized by elementary-aged children
than Mickey Mouse "
The prevalence of calculated
manipulation and harmful stereo
types in alcohol and cigarette ad
vertisements, she said, "lowers

one's self-esteem and reaches our
most vulnerable children "
She argued that the cigarette in
dustry is "an industiy that spends
$6 billion per year in advertising"
while claiming that it primarily
aims to "persuade adults onl> to
switch brands." However, she said
it is also responsible for hooking
significant numbers of young peo
pie.
"When you have a customer
base built on people who die, you
have to target your next con
sumers," she said. According to
Kilbourne, 3,000 children per day
must take up smoking to replace
the older smokers who die.
Kilbourne called for changes in
policy and implementation of
counter-advertising. No stranger
to health policy issues, Kilbourne
served as an adviser to the surgeon
general and has testified before
Congress on such issues.
But the difficulty in revamping
images in the media, she said lies
in the way cigarette and alcohol
companies control well-known
conglomerates. Entanglements
caused by a need to please commer
cial sponsors and to report accu
rate information forces newspa
pers, magazines and television to
exercise internal censorship.
"We rely on the media for our
health information, but the con
tent of the media is primarily for
the purpose of getting ads," she
said. "What we get is censorship of
the press by huge corporations."
Kilbourne explained that the
Partnership for a Drug-Free Amer
ica - the advertisers who created
the, "This is your brain This is
your brain on drugs" campaign
is connected with companies in
eluding Miller, R.J. Reynolds, An
heuser-Busch and Virginia Slims.
Therefore, their public service
announcements and any programs
associated with thqm, never men
tion the negative affects of legal
drugs sold by these companies, Kil
bourne said
The need for increased govern
ment regulation is not necessarily
a call for big government, she said
"It's the government vs corporate
greed. This is an issue of public
health, not political debate," she
said.

the ASSU Speakers Bureau and
