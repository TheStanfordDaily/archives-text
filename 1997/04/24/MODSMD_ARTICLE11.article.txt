California term limits thrown out
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Term limits for Cal
ifornia lawmakers, approved by the voters in
1990, were ruled unconstitutional Wednesday by
a federal judge.
U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken said the
state may be able to restrict the number of con
secutive terms a legislator can serve. But she said
the California initiative, Prop. 140, went too far
by imposing a lifetime ban on lawmakers who
have reached their term limits — three two-year
terms in the Assembly, two four-year terms in
the state Senate.
"California's extreme version of term limits
imposes a severe burden on the right of its citizens
to vote for candidates of their choice," Wilken wrote.
She agreed to suspend her ruling during the
state's appeal. That probably means term limits
will remain in effect for the 1998 elections.
Attorney General Dan Lungren, whose office
defended the initiative, said he was disappointed
that "the clear will of California voters" had been
overturned.
"Today's decision fuels the frustration citi
zens harbor toward a judiciary that all too often
extinguishes their mandates," Lungren said in a
statement.

Former Assemblyman Tom Bates, a Berkeley
Democrat who sued when term limits prevented
him from seeking re-election, said "I'm elated that
I have had the opportunity to stop an undemo
cratic law. People who live in an assembly district
should be able to choose their own representative
for as long as they want to."
Wild horses gain federal protection
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The federal
government announced tougher regulations yes
terday aimed at protecting wild horses and bur
ros on public land. The changes come 3 1/2
months after The Associated Press detailed
abuses in the program designed to find homes for
the animals.
"We're going to be checking in on more
adopters to make sure horses are properly cared
for, we're going to spot-check slaughterhouses to
make sure they comply with the law, and we're
going to keep better track of horses and adopters,"
said Sylvia Baca, acting director of the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management.
The AP had reported that the $16 million-a-year
program has allowed thousands of wild horses and
burros to be slaughtered and that BLM employees
are among those profiting from the slaughter.
