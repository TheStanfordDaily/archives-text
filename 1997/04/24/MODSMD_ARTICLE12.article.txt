# Newt ponders tax write-off
## Speaker's lawyers think ethics fine might be deductable 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Newt
Gingrich is exploring whether he can take a tax
deduction for the $300,000 he must pay to settle his
House ethics case.
"The tax attorneys that I've talked to indicated that
it's deductible," lawyer Handy Evans said in an inter
view. Asked if Gingrich had decided to take that route,
he said, "We have not yet.. .. We have looked into it."
Last week, Gingrich announced he had arranged
for a loan from former GOP presidential candidate
Bob Dole to cover the $300,000 he is to pay to cover
costs of the investigation of his fund-raising activi
ties. He also admitted violating House rules and
received a reprimand in the case.
Evans said he and Gingrich plan to investigate
the tax-deduction possibility further after drafting
the loan documents and presenting the agreement to
the House ethics committee for approval.
Some corporate tax accountants say the Georgia
Republican could have a case to deduct the payment
as a business expense. But others say the case is far
from clear.
The tax code permits people to deduct expenses
related to their professions — if the money is not
designated to pay a fine or a penalty. Thus, the ques
tion could turn on how the government defines the
payment.

Gingrich has been insistent in describing the
$300,000 as a reimbursement of costs of the ethics
panel's investigation, not a penalty or a fine. While
there is some dispute over the issue, the Jan. 17
ethics committee report refers to the payment as a
"sanction."
The report quotes special counsel James Cole as
saying the "appropriate sanction for the conduct. . .
is a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward
the cost of the preliminary inquiry." The report says
Gingrich and his attorney agreed to this language.
Gingrich and his allies have their own interpreta
tion of the report. Lawyer Evans pointed to com
ments of Rep. Steven Schiff, R-N.M., who said dur
ing Gingrich's sanctions hearing in January, "We
thought of a fine as a penalty to deprive somebody of
a personal gain. Hut Mr. Gingrich never gained per
sonally from this effort."
Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who was chairman of
the investigative subcommittee in the Gingrich case,
said, "You could argue either way" over whether the
payment was meant, as a penalty.
Pointing out the ethics committee was silent on
this issue, Goss said that in his view "it was not
meant as a penalty, it was meant as a reimburse
ment to taxpayers" for incorrect information sup
plied by Gingrich.
