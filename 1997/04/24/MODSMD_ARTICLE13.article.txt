Additional publicity and
outreach necessary to help
those suffering depression

IT'S NO SECRET that people
are, on occasion, depressed. Ajid
it's also no secret that Stanford
students are, in fact, people. Yet in
our ivory tower, it's often difficult to
make the logical connection that
problems which affect all people will
often affect Stanford students too.
Last week The Daily reported on
depression among Stanford stu
dents and particularly among grad
uate students. In that article were
some interesting numbers. Roughly
1,500 people visit Cowell Student
Health Service's Counseling and
Psychological Services each year. It
has been shown that one in four
women and one in 10 men experi
ence depression. That means poten
tially 2,200 Stanford students are
depressed and 20 percent of them
aren't being treated for it.
The University — and particu
larly Residential Education — must
make a greater effort to ensure that
all students are aware of the coun
seling options available to them.
Stanford students are fortunate.
Two counseling resources are avail
able to them on campus, free of
charge. Any registered student may
make an appointment with one of
CAPS' professional counselors and

have 10 free consultations. CAPS
also provides 24-hour crisis counsel
ing. (CAPS' number is 3-3785.)
The Bridge, staffed by student
volunteers, is a less-structured
counseling environment. It is seen
as a model of an effective peer-coun
seling program for colleges and uni
versities nationwide, and it wel
comes drop-in counseling visits
daily from 9 a.m. to midnight. Peer
counselors on call for telephone con
sultations 24 hours a day.(The
Bridge's number is 3-3393.)
It's clear that both services are
important and useful ones. What's
less clear is how aware students are
that they exist. The Bridge's "Yeah
right" bathroom stickers may not
be as übiquitous as it sometimes
seems, and, furthermore, it's the
responsibility of the University to
see to it that students are aware of
the group's existence. CAPS, with
out any bathroom stickers, is even
less advertised than is The Bridge.
Providing information about
the two programs should be a part
of New Student Orientation and
included in the materials given to
returning students — both under
graduate and graduate — at the
start of the year. Residence staff —
and particularly peer health edu
cators — should make a more con
certed effort to ensure that stu
dents are aware of these resources.
It seems likely, though unfortu
nate, that those most in need of
counseling will be the least aggres
sive in finding it.
