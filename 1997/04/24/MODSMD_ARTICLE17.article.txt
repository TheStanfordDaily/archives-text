## Never judge a bike by its rust 
### 
I HAVE A piece-of-shit bike. The rubber
handle bars are frayed, the rust-coated
frame has the half-life of uranium-238,
and the pine-infested wheels emit more
hot air than Nick Thompson at a U.S.
News & World Report editorial meeting.
If it weren't so shitty, I wouldn't love it
so much.
I have a bike with character. The wheels
may be sagging, but they're so goddamn
huge that one hardly notices. It's true. My
mountain bike has big-ass wheels the size
of two circus midgets. Every time I sit atop
the hulking mass I feel like a driver at a
monster truck rally:
Gruff, Hick Announcer: Sunday! Sun
day! Sunday! See Billy Joe Mack Bob
Hank Johnson take on "Big Bad-Ass"
Jake Jr. in a big wheel race for all the grits
they can eat! Cringe when "Jerky " Jordan
Gelber takes on the flaming tires of death
in the Trek 700, Bike-asauras Rex!
So what if the kickstand isn't stable?
All those gashes in my left calf from its
rusty edge seem worth it just to have the
sound of that metal prod knocking
against the steel spokes as I pedal. "Clack
ity-clackity-clackity-clack." Kids in the
'50s had to buy a pack of playing cards to
get the annoying sound that my bicycle
makes naturally.
What do I care if the speed gauge is
nonexistent? It's much more exciting
when I have to guess if I'm in first speed
or third. Sometimes the chain doesn't
even respond when my thumb changes

gears, and sometimes my bike just isn't in
the mood to do anything. It will tell me so
by dropping its chain while I am pedaling
up a steep hill.
Every trip to class becomes an adven
ture.
Not even the pedals have remained
intact. The left one is cracked, and the
right one has been missing its front half
for more than a year. Only I know the spe
cial placement of feet necessary to rotate
those handicapped hunks of plastic. It's
like I am entering a secret physical code
each time I apply my feet to the pedals.
Whenever it rains, the brakes make
this wonderful nail-biting screech every
time I need to stop. People waste money
on bells and horns, but my bike has built
in aggravating-as-hell brake pads. It fills
me with joy each time I come to a full
stop at corners and watch people cover
their ears or fall to the ground with a
heart attack.
I'm glad my bike is a piece of shit. I
don't really need to buy a lock for it or
worry about it when I'm away for long
periods of time. There's always a nicer
bike nearby in case someone wants to steal
one. My bike can sit there, slumped
against a tree, for the next century and
nobody would think to remove it except to
beautify the area.
The lock that I have came with the
bike, and is as rusty and hard to manage
as the bike which it protects. Rather than
the smooth turn and click that most peo

pie lock their bikes with, my lock requires
a strong thrust and jolt to make that key
work in that cumbersome lock. Needless
to say, I start every day with a rush of
frustration, which helps me more than
any cup of coffee. Anger motivates more
than caffeine.
If my bike were a horse, you'd put it to
death. If it were a hospital patient, you'd
consider euthanasia. But my bike has a
way of surprising even me, by continuing
to work and getting me from A to B. The
choo-choo train of storybooks says,"I
think I can, I think I can." But my bicycle
says,"I know I can, and screw you for
doubting me."
I like to think of my bike as a precious
artifact. It may be ugly and decrepit, and it
may not be too efficient by today's stan
dards. But every time I ride it I am remind
ed of all the times we've been through
together: the pedestrians we've hit, the
falls we've taken, the curves we forgot to
slow down on, the bruises we've collected.
My bike is more than just a piece of shit.
It represents all the shit we've been
through together.

munication and drama, warns pedestri
ans to get the hell out of his way or suffer
the consequences, such as near-hits and
the finger.
