Election improprieties threaten legitimacy of the ASSU

I WILL NOT recognize the presidency
of Emily Andrus and Ben Decker.
Not because 1 have a problem with
{.he Andrus-Decker platform, not
because I think that they are devoid of
integrity, not even because I think they
would not do good jobs as president and
vice president. I will not recognize them
because their election to the ASSU pres
idency is not only highly illegitimate but,
even more clearly, unconstitutional.
The ASSU Constitution states that in
the event that a candidate does not
receive the necessary 50 percent of the
vote, a runoff must lx> held. It is unclear
whether Andrus and Decker received 50
percent of the total votes cast by Stanford
students. Therefore, simple logic tells one
that a runoff would not only clearly
denote the students' choice, but it would
also legitimate the election process.

Some may argue, "Oh, we don't want
to put this university through another
election. Students won't vote. They've
made their choice." They claim that
another election will further disenfran
chise voters, making the election illegiti
mate because of a low voter turnout. This
is a weak argument. An illegitimate presi
dency like the one we see before us — one
where the voices of one segment of the
student body are ignored or muzzled — is
one surefire way to disenfranchise voters.
ASSU President Bill Shen could never be
more incorrect than with his assertion
that "the election is not an issue of legiti
macy in the eyes of students."
Oh, quite the contrary, Billy Boy!
If we are going to elect someone to an
office, let's do it right — let's not do it
half-assed. Is this junior high? Everyone
who wants to vote and does should be

counted; it's that simple. What's so diffi
cult about that? When you ignore one
section of the Stanford population,
regardless of size or importance, that
sends the student body a message: Your
vote may not actually be worth anything.
And the ASSU fears disenfranchising
voters.
The ASSU Senate's decision to vali
date last week's election is a grievous
fault but one that can be remedied. If
Emily Andrus is as respectable as I
think she is, she will not accept her
"elected office" without a runoff. I
really don't see how one as honorable
as Andrus can assume such an
esteemed position under such shady
circumstances as last week's election
— while at the same time being regard
ed as one full of respect, honor and
high character. It shall be only after a

runoff — initiated by Andrus' refusal
to accept her office — that legitimacy
and respect can be returned to the
ASSU presidency and senate.
Without such a runoff, I cannot rec
ognize the new ASSU government as
legitimate. I will oppose every decree
this group enacts. And I will issue my
complaint to the Board of Trustees, ask
ing that they not recognize the ASSU as
a representative of the Stanford student
body but rather recognize this most
insolent and shameful body of neophytes
as the offenders they truly are and dis
solve the Associated Students of Stan
ford University.
Now talk about disenfranchising
voters.
