# Stanford's Armenians urge all 'to remember and learn' from genocide
## 
### 
We are quite fortunate to be at Stan
ford — a place dedicated to education
and research, which prides itself on
diversity. Our student body is so mixed
and unique that it supports numerous
ethnic student organizations.
As a meml>er of one such organization,
the Armenian Students' Association, I feel
compelled, «ls does the rest of our union,
to educate and inform the Stanford com
munity about our culture and history.
Armenia is a small country in the
southern part of the former Soviet Union.
It was the first country in the world to
declare Christianity as its national faith,
in A.D. 301 In fact, Armenia's Mount
Ararat is the Biblical landing site of
Noah's Ark Although its ancestral lands

have spanned far greater areas than the
map reveals, Armenia today is confined
the Caspian and Black Seas, just
north of Iran and east of Turkey.
Today is a day of remembrance for all
Armenians, as it must be for all humani
ty. It is the 82nd commemoration of the
Armenian genocide, and this is why our
association has chosen to submit a letter
for publication on April 24.
In 1915, under the guise and global
confusion of World War I, the Armenian
people were decimated by the expanding
rule of the Ottoman Empire. Historians
have shown that more than 1.5 million
Armenians were murdered throughout
the country. Numerous atrocities have
been documented by historical records
and accounts from survivors which are
too heinous to recount and too painful to
mention. The goal of that Turkish
regime was to erase the Armenian people
from history and assume control of their
lands. Today, a large part of ancient
Armenia still lies in eastern Turkev.

The reasons for writing this letter are
not to blame the Turks of today. They
are not the misguided leaders who once
perpetuated such barbarism. However,
we continue our plea for the acknowledg
ment of these truths by both the Turkish
and the U.S. governments. We, like all
educated people, feel that history should
not be repeated. People must learn from
the mistakes of the past. We learned the
price of such ignorance during World
War II: In many historical chronicles,
Hitler is quoted as saying, "Who today
remembers the Armenians?" as he ratio
nalized the Jewish Holocaust.
The sadness April 24 brings lies with
many. It rests with the Turkish govern
ment even today for not acknowledging
this mass murder of millions. It is
found in the eyes of bystanders, such as
the citizens and government of the
United States, who refuse to act against
current crimes against humanity
around the world. It is unfortunate
that such pain can arise from neglect

and can be so easily remedied through
understanding. It remains within the
survivors of the genocide in saying
good-bye to loved ones once again. And
of course it stays in the hearts of each
and every Armenian today.
A pastor named Niemoller once said:
"First they came for the Jews, and I
did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
"Then they came for the communists,
and I did not speak out because I was
not a communist.
"Then they came for the trade union
ists, and I did not speak out because I
was not a trade unionist.
"Then they came for me, and there
was no one left to speak out for me."
All that we ask today is for an oath to
remember and learn from the Armenian
genocide and to speak out before you
become the last.
