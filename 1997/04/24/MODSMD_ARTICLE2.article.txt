The success of Stanford's largest ethnic
groups in their requests for the special fee this
year reflects increased student support for
funding student groups
Since 1994, the percentage of students that
have voted for special fees for the Black Stu
dent Union, Asian American Students Associ
ation, Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student
group has steadily increased.
Junior Maria Bleavins, co-chair of the
BSU, said, "I think a lot of it has to do with the
fact that a lot of the people running the orga
nizations are juniors, and we came in fresh
man year when a lot of our groups didn't
have" the special fee, Bleavins said. "So we
can empathize with what it's like not to have
funds.
"It's like people realizing that 'Hey the
Universit} is for everyone, and even though I
may not be in rock climbing or whatever,
these groups that work hard have a right to
have their fee ;is long as they're doing legiti
mate work for the student body, " Bleavins
added

Bleavins also said the success of the special
fee groups may be due to the 1995 Common
Sense Fee Reform, which allows groups to re
quest a fee from either undergraduate or
graduate students only or both graduate and
undergraduate constituencies.
Andrew Chiang, vice president of AASA,
said the positive results of the special-fee elec
tion this year reflects student generosity and
enthusiasm
"1 think it says a lot about the Stanford
community that people care enough to go out
and vote and are feeling generous enough to
contribute ... to each of the special-fee
groups," he said.
"I think it's really also a reflection of very
hard work, hard campaigning and ;i unified ef
fort this year by the ethnic communities to get
the special fee," Chiang added.
Sophomore Bianca Ling, issues chair of
AASA, said the special fee is important to eth
nic groups because "it's important to recog
nize the cultural and political issues that, the

different ethnic communities each bring to
the entire Stanford community "
Bleavins emphasized the inclusiveness of
programs put on by African-American stu
dent groups.
"I think there's a myth out there that we're
exclusive, that we don't want interaction from
the rest ofthe Stanford community, but that's
completely untrue," she said.
Bleavins cited the BSU's organization of
the annual Kwanzaa a holiday in December
celebrating African-American values as an
example of an event attended by many outside
not only the African-American community,
bnl also outside Stanford About 250 to 300
people from Stanford, ;is well as children from
local schools and people from neighboring
areas, participate in the event, Bleavins said.

In addition to Kwanzaa, the BSD
also organizes the annual Soul Food
Dinner and Malcolm X Week in the
spring.
"The BSU provides a unique and
valuable perspective through its ac
tivities," said BSU co chair Lamar
Baker, a junior It "reaches out to all
students who come to programs or
choose to get involved in some way "
Bleavins said this quarter the
BSU Ls planning tc hold a meeting
to discuss the upcoming changes to
the African and Afro American
Studies Program as its classes are
incorporated into the program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity
"The ethnic communities and
organizations do a lot to try to unify
our communities, to create an at
mosphere of respect for the diversi
ty that exists and to educate the
community about the different per
spectives and issues facing our en
tire community," said Chiang.
Sophomore Joe Freund, deputy
ASSU senate chair, agreed that the
activities put on by ethnic organiza
tions were inclusive to the entire
Stanford community.
"Zoot Suit Week is an event that
many students outside of the
110 community benefit from. I my
self have gone every year," Freund
said.
"You won't find any student ser
vice that is used by every student,
but the fact is that most students —
whether or not they get involved in
each community -- should appreci
ate having those groups on cam
pus," he said.
Senior Sonia Herrera, treasurer
of MEChA, said the activities of eth
nic organizations are about "cele
brating our differences and finding
commonalties as well."
According to Herrera, this is the
first year MEChA acted as an um
brella organization on the special
fee ballot for the other six Chi
cano / Latino student groups
MEChA did not win its special-fee
request in last year's election.
Herrera said MEChA and the six
groups under its umbrella will be
putting on more events next year
than they were able to this year be
cause they will no longer be limited
to annual funding offered from the
ASSU through students' general
fees.
"The fund-raising efforts for the

different events we all put on will be
greatl> reduced, so we can focus on
the actual planning of events," she
said.
"Also ill these different groups
apply foi the same type of [annual
funding) so we all fight for the same
resources Having the special fee
makes us more united because we
don't have to compete," Herrera
said
Senioi Patty Ferguson co-chair
of the Stanford American Indian
Organization, also said the special
fee funding will make next year
much easier in terms of planning
events.
"I think a lot of people's energy
got depleted fall quarter because we
had to raise funds for the Powwow
and different events," Ferguson
said.
"You're able to do more things
when you have more resources.
It enriches the University because
it brings lots of people from the Bay
Area to different events," she said.
Some of the larger events put
on by SAIO include the annual
Powwow and Native American
Awareness Week, Indigenous Peo
ple's Day. a speakers series and tu
toring programs for Native Amer
ican high school students. In addi
tion, a new journal called "Rising
Spirit" will publish its first issue
this year

Senior Clay Akiwenzie, co
chair of SAIO, said the organiza
tion is trying to increase student
involvement in the development
of Native American education, in
line with the establishment of
CSRE.
"We want to get more students
involved in the state and direc
tion of Native American education
— what kind of things are valuable
to people living on reservations, di
rection for academic careers, etc.,"
Akiwenzie said.
"A lot of SAIO's role on campus
is [to bej an educating force," he
said 'When people think of Amer
ican Indians it's kind of old stereo
typed images, i.e. mascots. So 1
think SAIO's job is to direct its
programming to (educating] the
entire campus."
According to senior Lubia
Sanchez, co-chair of MEChA, some
of the largest events put on by the
Chicano / Latino community in
clude Zoot Suit Week, La Gran
Posada, the statewide MEChA
conference, the Cinco de Mayo cel
ebration and Raza Day, which is
aimed at encouraging Chicano /
Latino high school students to
ward higher education.
"What I like about IRaza Day I is
that it's very diverse," Sanchez
said. "For me, empowering our
youth is something not only Chi

canos should do That conference
means a lot to me because a lot of
students come out" to help
The events AASA hopes to con
tinue and expand upon according
to Chiang, include the Listen to
the Silence conference in the fall,
which addresses Asian American
political, cultural and social is
sues; Asia Pacific Islander Her
itage Month, Asian Images a
speakers series that brings in
Asian Americans from occupa
tions such as journalism politics
and community activism; and Ex
travaganza, which celebrates the
diversity of Asian American cul
ture and food
"In relationships in general,
there has to be dialogue/ which is
sometimes difficult when cultures
differ, Sanchez said "We have to
take proactive roles in this, be
cause it's not institutionalized
"The University is a microcosm
of the society as a whole What
we're trying to do through our
events is say, 'here is a part of
American culture that is not repre
sented in it,' " Sanchez said.

The success of Stanford's largest ethnic
groups in their requests for the special fee this
year reflects increased student support for
funding student groups
Since 1994, the percentage of students that
have voted for special fees for the Black Stu
dent Union, Asian American Students Associ
ation, Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student
group has steadily increased.
Junior Maria Bleavins, co-chair of the
BSU, said, "I think a lot of it has to do with the
fact that a lot of the people running the orga
nizations are juniors, and we came in fresh
man year when a lot of our groups didn't
have" the special fee, Bleavins said. "So we
can empathize with what it's like not to have
funds.
"It's like people realizing that 'Hey the
Universit} is for everyone, and even though I
may not be in rock climbing or whatever,
these groups that work hard have a right to
have their fee ;is long as they're doing legiti
mate work for the student body, " Bleavins
added

Bleavins also said the success of the special
fee groups may be due to the 1995 Common
Sense Fee Reform, which allows groups to re
quest a fee from either undergraduate or
graduate students only or both graduate and
undergraduate constituencies.
Andrew Chiang, vice president of AASA,
said the positive results of the special-fee elec
tion this year reflects student generosity and
enthusiasm
"1 think it says a lot about the Stanford
community that people care enough to go out
and vote and are feeling generous enough to
contribute ... to each of the special-fee
groups," he said.
"I think it's really also a reflection of very
hard work, hard campaigning and ;i unified ef
fort this year by the ethnic communities to get
the special fee," Chiang added.
Sophomore Bianca Ling, issues chair of
AASA, said the special fee is important to eth
nic groups because "it's important to recog
nize the cultural and political issues that, the

different ethnic communities each bring to
the entire Stanford community "
Bleavins emphasized the inclusiveness of
programs put on by African-American stu
dent groups.
"I think there's a myth out there that we're
exclusive, that we don't want interaction from
the rest ofthe Stanford community, but that's
completely untrue," she said.
Bleavins cited the BSU's organization of
the annual Kwanzaa a holiday in December
celebrating African-American values as an
example of an event attended by many outside
not only the African-American community,
bnl also outside Stanford About 250 to 300
people from Stanford, ;is well as children from
local schools and people from neighboring
areas, participate in the event, Bleavins said.

In addition to Kwanzaa, the BSD
also organizes the annual Soul Food
Dinner and Malcolm X Week in the
spring.
"The BSU provides a unique and
valuable perspective through its ac
tivities," said BSU co chair Lamar
Baker, a junior It "reaches out to all
students who come to programs or
choose to get involved in some way "
Bleavins said this quarter the
BSU Ls planning tc hold a meeting
to discuss the upcoming changes to
the African and Afro American
Studies Program as its classes are
incorporated into the program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity
"The ethnic communities and
organizations do a lot to try to unify
our communities, to create an at
mosphere of respect for the diversi
ty that exists and to educate the
community about the different per
spectives and issues facing our en
tire community," said Chiang.
Sophomore Joe Freund, deputy
ASSU senate chair, agreed that the
activities put on by ethnic organiza
tions were inclusive to the entire
Stanford community.
"Zoot Suit Week is an event that
many students outside of the
110 community benefit from. I my
self have gone every year," Freund
said.
"You won't find any student ser
vice that is used by every student,
but the fact is that most students —
whether or not they get involved in
each community -- should appreci
ate having those groups on cam
pus," he said.
Senior Sonia Herrera, treasurer
of MEChA, said the activities of eth
nic organizations are about "cele
brating our differences and finding
commonalties as well."
According to Herrera, this is the
first year MEChA acted as an um
brella organization on the special
fee ballot for the other six Chi
cano / Latino student groups
MEChA did not win its special-fee
request in last year's election.
Herrera said MEChA and the six
groups under its umbrella will be
putting on more events next year
than they were able to this year be
cause they will no longer be limited
to annual funding offered from the
ASSU through students' general
fees.
"The fund-raising efforts for the

different events we all put on will be
greatl> reduced, so we can focus on
the actual planning of events," she
said.
"Also ill these different groups
apply foi the same type of [annual
funding) so we all fight for the same
resources Having the special fee
makes us more united because we
don't have to compete," Herrera
said
Senioi Patty Ferguson co-chair
of the Stanford American Indian
Organization, also said the special
fee funding will make next year
much easier in terms of planning
events.
"I think a lot of people's energy
got depleted fall quarter because we
had to raise funds for the Powwow
and different events," Ferguson
said.
"You're able to do more things
when you have more resources.
It enriches the University because
it brings lots of people from the Bay
Area to different events," she said.
Some of the larger events put
on by SAIO include the annual
Powwow and Native American
Awareness Week, Indigenous Peo
ple's Day. a speakers series and tu
toring programs for Native Amer
ican high school students. In addi
tion, a new journal called "Rising
Spirit" will publish its first issue
this year

Senior Clay Akiwenzie, co
chair of SAIO, said the organiza
tion is trying to increase student
involvement in the development
of Native American education, in
line with the establishment of
CSRE.
"We want to get more students
involved in the state and direc
tion of Native American education
— what kind of things are valuable
to people living on reservations, di
rection for academic careers, etc.,"
Akiwenzie said.
"A lot of SAIO's role on campus
is [to bej an educating force," he
said 'When people think of Amer
ican Indians it's kind of old stereo
typed images, i.e. mascots. So 1
think SAIO's job is to direct its
programming to (educating] the
entire campus."
