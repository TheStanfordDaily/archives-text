The success of Stanford's largest ethnic
groups in their requests for the special fee this
year reflects increased student support for
funding student groups
Since 1994, the percentage of students that
have voted for special fees for the Black Stu
dent Union, Asian American Students Associ
ation, Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student
group has steadily increased.
Junior Maria Bleavins, co-chair of the
BSU, said, "I think a lot of it has to do with the
fact that a lot of the people running the orga
nizations are juniors, and we came in fresh
man year when a lot of our groups didn't
have" the special fee, Bleavins said. "So we
can empathize with what it's like not to have
funds.
"It's like people realizing that 'Hey the
Universit} is for everyone, and even though I
may not be in rock climbing or whatever,
these groups that work hard have a right to
have their fee ;is long as they're doing legiti
mate work for the student body, " Bleavins
added

Bleavins also said the success of the special
fee groups may be due to the 1995 Common
Sense Fee Reform, which allows groups to re
quest a fee from either undergraduate or
graduate students only or both graduate and
undergraduate constituencies.
Andrew Chiang, vice president of AASA,
said the positive results of the special-fee elec
tion this year reflects student generosity and
enthusiasm
"1 think it says a lot about the Stanford
community that people care enough to go out
and vote and are feeling generous enough to
contribute ... to each of the special-fee
groups," he said.
"I think it's really also a reflection of very
hard work, hard campaigning and ;i unified ef
fort this year by the ethnic communities to get
the special fee," Chiang added.
Sophomore Bianca Ling, issues chair of
AASA, said the special fee is important to eth
nic groups because "it's important to recog
nize the cultural and political issues that, the

different ethnic communities each bring to
the entire Stanford community "
Bleavins emphasized the inclusiveness of
programs put on by African-American stu
dent groups.
"I think there's a myth out there that we're
exclusive, that we don't want interaction from
the rest ofthe Stanford community, but that's
completely untrue," she said.
Bleavins cited the BSU's organization of
the annual Kwanzaa a holiday in December
celebrating African-American values as an
example of an event attended by many outside
not only the African-American community,
bnl also outside Stanford About 250 to 300
people from Stanford, ;is well as children from
local schools and people from neighboring
areas, participate in the event, Bleavins said.
