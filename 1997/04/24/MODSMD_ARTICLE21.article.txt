## Making a choice about whether to remember or forget

"Remember the day on which you went
forth from Egypt, from the house of
bondage, and how God freed you with a
mighty hand."
— Exodus 13:3
IT IS PASSOVER, and this year, as
every year, Jews come together to
recount their exodus from slavery
under the Egyptians. This past — though
it occurred several thousand years ago
(and indeed may never have occurred) —
is supposed to be as vivid as if it had hap
pened yesterday.
In fact, as told in the Passover Seder,
it is only the wicked child who asks,
"What is this observance to you?" For as
everyone knows, Passover celebrates
"what God did for me when I went forth
from Egypt. For me, that is and not for
you . . . for had you been there, you would
have not known redemption.
So thus, several thousand years after
the fact, I am still reliving my exodus
from slavery.

Not every culture or religion or coun
try shares this emphasis on the distant
past. In fact, one could argue that such
remembrances lead to terrible hatred and
violence. Just look at Bosnia or Northern
Ireland or Israel.
It's hard to argue that demonizing
Egyptians every year at Passover has no
effect on views of Arabs in general. When
the Seder tells us that we were once
slaves, we think that even though we are
not slaves now, and are indeed very pow
erful, we could easily be slaves again.
Thus, Jews must remain strong in order
to resist those who are out to destroy
them. This rhetoric, whether right or
wrong, is not very conducive to peace and
harmony.
But on the other hand, there are
examples of places where people seem to
want to forget the past as soon as possi
ble.
When I was in Berlin, the site most
recommended for me to visit was not the
relatively well-known Brandenburg Gate

or the Reichstag, but the infobox at the
Potsdamer Platz. The Potsdamer Platz,
the busiest intersection in Europe 60
years ago, was long a deserted site, sand
wiched between East and West Berlin.
Now, it is again alive as the largest con
struction site in the world. The infobox
provides a panoramic view of cranes and
hard-hatted workers busily constructing
new buildings. The dream is that when
the construction is completed, the square
will again be the bustling locale it once
was.
It is a daunting task but is symbolic of
the major reconstruction occurring all
over Berlin and East Germany in general.
In Leipzig, in the square where the
groups used to protest daily for democra
cy during the twilight days of the old
regime, a crane now stands sentry
instead of East German police.
The construction is proceeding at
breakneck speed. This is not just due to
problems with decaying buildings that
were ignored under Communism. Sure,

there are still buildings with shell holes
from World War II in them, and there
were large pieces of empty property
which were formerly no-man zones along
the borders.
But there is more to it. Otherwise,
why would Berlin's city government
bankrupt itself? And that is exactly what
it's doing. The costs of all the new con
struction are so immense that the city
could not afford to fill the fountains in
the Charlottenburg palace last year.
So why do they build? It is as if the
past can be erased if the holes caused by
the Wall are filled. Those staying in the
new hotel right near the Brandenburg
Gate are probably not even aware that
they would have been shot if they had
been in that spot just 10 years ago.
Perhaps if all of the physical
reminders of the DDR-Zeit (as the time of
East Germany is called) are erased, then
it will be forgotten.
That's why the Berlin city government
has tried to remove all symbols of two

separate cities, even to the extent of stan
dardizing all the pedestrian traffic sig
nals. That's why in Leipzig, when build
ings are renovated, the old facades are
kept even as the interior is gutted. This is
because the outside is from pre-World
War II times. That's why the former
offices of the Stasi, the East German
secret police, although open to the public,
are not well publicized. Tucked away in
the suburb of Lichtenburg, they are out
of sight and thus out of mind.
As George Santayana said, those who
forget the past are doomed to repeat it.
However, keeping the memories alive can
also be problematic.
So forget or remember? Each option
may lead to slavery.
I don't like either choice.
