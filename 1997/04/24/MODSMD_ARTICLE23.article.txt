## Volleyball vies for Final Four berth 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
The second weekend of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion's postseason men's volley
ball tournament opens play
today with two matches. The
matches at Pauley Pavilion on
the UCLA campus feature four
of the nation's top five teams.
In the first match, Stanford,
ranked third in the nation and
seeded second in the tournament
will battle Brigham Young,
ranked fourth and seeded third.
In the nightcap, the host Bru
ins, ranked and seeded first, will

face off against UC-Santa Bar
bara, ranked fifth nationally and
seeded fourth. All four teams
will be battling for the right to
play for an automatic berth to
the Final Four in the MPSF final
Saturday.
For Stanford, the match with
BYU will be a true test of how far
the team has progressed this sea
son. Early on in the season, the
then-No. 1 Cardinal traveled to
Provo, Utah, for a match against
the Cougars. In the match played
on Valentine's Day, Stanford fell
in five games 13-15, 15-11, 15-4,

Hi-17, 15-12, losing its No. 1
ranking to the Cougars in the
process.
If Stanford is to avoid losing to
BYU, a loss that would almost
certainly end the Cardinal's sea
son, the squad will have to
improve two areas of its game,
areas that suffered in the teams'
first meeting. In the first match,
Stanford served 11 aces but put
up 32 service errors, giving the
Cougars 32 free sideouts. Sec
ond, the bigger, stronger Cardi
nal front line will have to do a
better job against the smaller,
quicker Cougars. In February,

the Stanford front line, a group
which has been dominant all sea
son, recorded just nine blocks to
the Cougars' 29.
"We did not play that well,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves
after the February match. "We
served strong with the aces, but
we can't have as many errors as
we did. We were not firing on all
cylinders."
While Nieves was concerned
about the team's inability to put
it all together in February, this
has not been a problem for the
Cardinal of late. The squad has
won 13 matches in a row and is
coining off an outstanding effort
against Pepperdine, a team many
felt was as good as any in the
land. While the entire Stanford

team may be on a roll, there is no
single Cardinal player enjoying
the type of season that BYU
senior middle blocker Ryan Mil
lar is having.
Millar, the national player of
the year, was 10th in the confer
ence in blocks per game with 1.62
and fifth in the conference in
kills per game at 6.49.
"We think that they have
moved him out to opposite,
where he can get more sets,"
explained Nieves. "That way,
they can get him more sets. He is
a very versatile hitter, good
enough to play in the middle or
on the outside. He can hit from
anywhere on the court, in combi
nations, from the back row,
quick sets and from the outside.

He is a real force and a great
player.
"We will try to make some
adjustments, but with players
like Millar, you don't try to stop
them, you try to slow them down
enough so that they can't beat
you."
But don't look for a team with
as many as six potential Ail-
Americans to give anything up.
Stanford has been on a quest all
season to capture its first NCAA
title, and the only way that it
can assure that it will get the
opportunity to compete for the
title is by winning the next two
matches.
"We have two weeks left in our
season," Nieves said. "I don't
expect any surprises."
