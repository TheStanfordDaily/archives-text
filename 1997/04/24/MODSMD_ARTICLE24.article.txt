# Tennis teams go south for Pac-10s
## Individual, doubles titles up for grabs 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
Coming off a magnificent weekend when the
Cardinal ousted both the Trojans of USC and the
top-ranked Bruins of UCLA in its final matches of
the season, the fifth-ranked Stanford men's ten
nis team hopes for the same individual success at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships in Ojai,
Calif., beginning today.
The individual championships will be the last
opportunity for the Card to compete against its
Pac-10 rivals before heading to the NCAA Cham
pionships next month, where Stanford will most
likely be a high seed.
The Pac-lOs are divided into two tournaments.
In the two separate divisions, which consist of the
main draw and the invitational, the Cardinal has
multiple entries in the singles and the doubles in
each event. Each team in the Pac-10 will send
four players into the singles draw to battle for the
title.
The Pac-lOs will be a showdown of many
UCLA, USC and Stanford players. In the open
draw, the Card has four singles entries as well as
two doubles teams. The top seed for this event is
UCLA's Eric Taino, but Stanford's Ryan Wolters
is close behind as the No. 2 seed. Last Saturday,
Wolters beat Taino in three sets to claim the vic
tory for the Card over the Bruins in the dual
match at Stanford.
Other entries for Stanford in the main draw
include freshman twins Bob and Mike Bryan, as
well as senior Grant Elliott. Bob Bryan is seeded
fourth in the event, while USC's George Bastl is
the No. 3 seed.

Senior Grant Elliott will lead the Cardinal Into the Pac-10s this weekend.
In the open doubles draw, Bob
and Mike Bryan are the No. 3
seed behind UCLA's Kevin Kim
and Eric Lin and USC's Bastl
and Kyle Spencer, the No. I and
No. 2 seeds, respectively. Also
entered in the open doubles draw
will be Wolters and junior Paul
Goldstein. This will be the first
competition Goldstein will see
since his foot injury, which has
kept him sidelined for the second
half of the season.
"As long as his foot stays
healthy, we will see Paul playing
in the doubles," said head coach

Dick Gould.
In the invitational, Stanford
will enter three singles and two
doubles teams. Freshman Geoff
Abrams will compete in the sin
gles draw and is the top seed in
that event. Juniors Misha Pale
cek and Charles Hoeveler will
also play in the open singles.
In the doubles invitational,
Elliott and Abrams are the No. 1
seed. Elliott won the invitational
in the doubles event last season
with then-senior Ricky Becker.
Also entered in the doubles invi
tational are Hoeveler and Pale
cek.
The Pac-10's run through
Sunday. Stanford will then come
home to prepare for the NCAA
regionals, which begin May 9.
