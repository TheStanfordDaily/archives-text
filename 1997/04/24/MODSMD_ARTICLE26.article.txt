# Grant Elliott: The Card's silent star
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
Perhaps if you linger at the home of the
two-time defending national champion Stan
ford men's tennis team you will observe the
obvious ingredients that make for such an
exquisite squad: two returning All-Americans
who are ranked in the top 15 in the nation
and three talented starting freshmen who
have had a profound influence on the Card's
splendid 22-2 record this season.
If you stick around a little longer, perhaps
you will notice that guy on court six, who only
dropped two dual matches all season — the
final starter of the team but also the captain,
who displays leadership, athleticism and com
passion on and off the court.
Grant Elliott is the sole senior on this
year's squad, currently ranked fifth in the
nation. Elliott has been a veteran and role
model for the young squad as Stanford looks

to capture a third consecutive national cham
pionship.
"Grant has been a leader and a crucial part
of the team ever since the first day we got to
Stanford," said freshman teammate Mike
Bryan. "Any time there is a big match, Grant
always has great advice on how to prepare.
When we go up against the big teams like
UCLA, Grant always has advice, because he
has been there."
To say the senior has had ample experience
in tight matches would be an understate
ment. In his freshman year, Elliott was there
when the team just missed winning a nation
al championship. He has learned resilience
and the strength of a fighter, as he turned
around and served as a crucial part of the
team when the Cardinal clinched the title the
past two seasons.
Now as May approaches, so does another
baUle for the NCAA title, with Elliott silently
guiding the way of his young and talented

squad. Elliott's record exemplifies his experi
ence, as he posts an impressive record at
Stanford, including more than 80 career wins,
as well as a 15-match winning streak this sea
son, with an impressive 19-2 dual-match
record this year.
But Elliott has been more than the glue
which has held a talented team together. It
has been Elliott's influence on the team
which has had a great impact on the young
but talented squad all season.
"Much of the success of the three talented
freshmen who replaced the three starting
seniors has been due to Grant's influence,"
said Dick Gould, in his 31st season as the
head coach of the team.
"Itarely have we had an athlete and young
man who has meant so much to our pro
gram," Gould said.
Indeed, Elliott's influence on the program
is perhaps a reflection of his
demeanor as a genuine individual
who is the quintessential leader by
example.
"Grant is just a tremendous
athlete who would excel at any
sport he tried on for size," said his
fraternity brother and friend,
Jonah Steinhart, who met Elliott
at age 6.
"In second grade he was on the
soccer team, and everyone just
could see he was at a different
level athletically. Grant could pick
up any sport and excel. He says
after tennis is over, he wants to
ski. There is no doubt in my mind
that he will be an expert in no
time."
Elliott's athleticism and deter
mination shined at Palo Alto High
School, where in his senior year he
was the leader of the undefeated
tennis team as well as the starting
point guard of the undefeated bas
ketball team, which captured the
state championship.

"In high school, I was crushed
when he gave up baseball for bas
ketball and tennis because I
thought he would make it to the
major leagues," Steinhart said.
But what makes Elliott the hid
den gem of the Cardinal squad on a
tennis team bursting with talent is
the genuine human being which
stands behind the extraordinary
athlete.
"Grant is the nicest guy I
know," Steinhart said. "He is not
only a athlete, but a genuine friend
and an extremely intelligent indi
vidual."
As his impressive career comes
to a close here on the Farm, the
silent star will have one more
opportunity to lend advice to his
young squad as it look toward the
NCAA Championships. But last
weekend were the final dual
matches he will play on the Farm.
"These last two matches are
really big for me since they will be
the last I will play at home for
Stanford," Elliott said prior to the
weekend.
Little does Elliott know that it
also means a lot to Stanford: the
coaches, teammates, fans and

friends who will miss his presence
next season. At the end of his final
weekend, Stanford tennis had ti
moment where tribute was given to
the veteran, as his name came
down off the scoreboard for the last
time — one of the few occasions
where the talented senior held the
spotlight on a team filled with
young players.
With someone such as Elliott,
however, perhaps hiding behind
this pool of talent is his greatest"
asset. Throughout the season,
when asked what makes for such
an amazing team, impressive
comeback or fabulous record,
Elliott would always point to his
talented teammates.
"The talent and energy of our
freshmen is amazing — they bring
so much to the team," he would
say, or Elliott would point to the
impressive play of Ail-Americans
Ryan Wolters and Paul Goldstein,
who have posted amazing colle
giate careers as well.
Yet it will be Elliott whose lead
ership, experience, friendship and
presence will be missed when the
team returns next season without
its silent star.
