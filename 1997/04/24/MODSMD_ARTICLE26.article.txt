# Grant Elliott: The Card's silent star
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
Perhaps if you linger at the home of the
two-time defending national champion Stan
ford men's tennis team you will observe the
obvious ingredients that make for such an
exquisite squad: two returning All-Americans
who are ranked in the top 15 in the nation
and three talented starting freshmen who
have had a profound influence on the Card's
splendid 22-2 record this season.
If you stick around a little longer, perhaps
you will notice that guy on court six, who only
dropped two dual matches all season â€” the
final starter of the team but also the captain,
who displays leadership, athleticism and com
passion on and off the court.
Grant Elliott is the sole senior on this
year's squad, currently ranked fifth in the
nation. Elliott has been a veteran and role
model for the young squad as Stanford looks

to capture a third consecutive national cham
pionship.
"Grant has been a leader and a crucial part
of the team ever since the first day we got to
Stanford," said freshman teammate Mike
Bryan. "Any time there is a big match, Grant
always has great advice on how to prepare.
When we go up against the big teams like
UCLA, Grant always has advice, because he
has been there."
To say the senior has had ample experience
in tight matches would be an understate
ment. In his freshman year, Elliott was there
when the team just missed winning a nation
al championship. He has learned resilience
and the strength of a fighter, as he turned
around and served as a crucial part of the
team when the Cardinal clinched the title the
past two seasons.
Now as May approaches, so does another
baUle for the NCAA title, with Elliott silently
guiding the way of his young and talented

squad. Elliott's record exemplifies his experi
ence, as he posts an impressive record at
Stanford, including more than 80 career wins,
as well as a 15-match winning streak this sea
son, with an impressive 19-2 dual-match
record this year.
But Elliott has been more than the glue
which has held a talented team together. It
has been Elliott's influence on the team
which has had a great impact on the young
but talented squad all season.
"Much of the success of the three talented
freshmen who replaced the three starting
seniors has been due to Grant's influence,"
said Dick Gould, in his 31st season as the
head coach of the team.
"Itarely have we had an athlete and young
man who has meant so much to our pro
gram," Gould said.
Indeed, Elliott's influence on the program
