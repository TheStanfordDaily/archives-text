The Stanford track and field
team began competition in
Philadelphia, Pa yesterday at the
Penn Relays. This is the 102 nd
anniversary of the event, and the
Cardinal sent eight men and 11
women to the competition.
"This is a big one. There will be
over 40,000 people there," said
head coach Vin Lananna
The event began yesterday and
will continue through Saturday.
The focus will be on the middle
distance and distance relays.
"In Texas we showcased our
men; at Penn it's the women's
turn," Lananna said.
The Card will compete in the
men's and women's 4x1,500-meter
and 4xBoo-meter relays as well as
the distance medley. The distance
medley consists of 1,200-, 400-,
800- and 1,600-meter legs. In addi
tion, the women will compete in the
4x400-meter relay. The relays will
showcase the talented group of dis

tance runners on this year's squad,
many of whom were members of
the national champion cross coun
try teams that competed this fall.
The women's 1,500-meter team
will consist of juniors Monal Chok
shi, Sara Moore and Sama Renfro
along with sophomore Mary Cobb.
Moore and Chokshi will serve dou
ble duty, running in the 4xBoo,
joining teammates sophomore
LaShawndra Pace and freshman
Cynthia Morman.
Pace and Morman will team up
with junior Heather Miller and
freshman Jayna Smith for the
4x400. The distance medley will
consist of Pace, Miller, Morman
and Renfro, who will anchor the
race.
Also competing this weekend
for the women will be freshman
Summer Pierson in the discus.
Senior Amanda White made the
trip and will compete in the 3,000
meters.
The men will have little rest
between races, and many will be
competing in more than one event.

Given the most to do is junior J.J.
White. White will compete in the
5,000 meters, as well as the 4x400,
4x1,500 and the distance medley
relays.
Joining White in the 4x1,500
will be freshmen Brad and Brent
Hauser and Michael Stember.
Stember will join White in the
4xBoo along with junior Ryan
McCalmon and freshman Jake
Maas. White, Maas, McCalmon
and junior Jonathan Weldon make
up the distance-medley team.
Sophomore Nathan Nutter will
compete in the 10,000 meters and
McCalmon will participate in the
3,000-meter steeplechase.
The Cardinal will also compete
at the California State Champi
onships in Northridge. Competi
tion begins Saturday and ends
Sunday.
"We're going to treat this one
like the Bear meet, more of an invi
tational," Lananna said. "We're
sending very good people."
