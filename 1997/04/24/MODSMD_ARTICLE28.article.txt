# McKay takes title
## Women's golf comes in fourth 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
For the first time, senior co-cap
tain Mhairi McKay was crowned
the top-ranked women's golfer in
the Pacific 10 Conference yester
day. But it certainly wasn't the
first time she has proven she
deserves top honors.
Considered one of the best
women collegiate golfers in the
country, McKay won the Pac-10
championship after scoring a
career-low 207 (68-69-70), 12
under par.
With enough birdies to fill a pet
store, McKay toured the 6,004-
yard layout as the only player to
score below 70. Fifty team players,
including some of the nation's best,
participated in the 54-hole tourna
ment held at the par-73 Tacoma
Country and Golf Club.
The Stanford team finished

fourth overall with 892. Arizona,
who won last year's NCAA title,
won with three players claiming
top-five finishes. The Wildcats tal
lied 867, followed by Arizona State
at 882 and UCLA with 883.
McKay and freshman Julie
Dunn, both with subpar finishes,
led the team into third place on the
first day. On the second day, the
team held on to its third-ranked
spot, with all five players scoring a
1-over-par or bitter.
The team dropped to a fourth
place finish after all the players
posted their worst scores on the
last day. In earlier tournaments,
the team tended to get off to a slow
start, performing its best on the
last round for a top finish. In its
past two tournaments, however,
the team has reversed its perfor
mance, playing best in the begin
ning and faltering in the end.
Dunn, who tied for ninth, shot

her lowest .stroke average this year.
Her 221 finish (72-74-75) helped
her earn honorable mention All-
Pac-10 honors.
"I'm happy with how I've been
hitting the ball, especially my short
putts," Dunn Haid.
Dunn, who can unofficially
drive the ball farther than any
other female collegiate player, has
been working hard on her short
putts all season.
The practice paid off on the first
round when she shot a 1-under-par
for a career low. She sank all putts
that came within five feet of the pin.
Dunn sputtered briefly on the
front nine with two bogeys but
came back with two birdies and
seven pars on the back nine during
the first round.
Although she shot a higher
score on the second round, Dunn
managed to impress herself on the
15th and 17th par-3s.
"Par-3s are my least favorite,
but I did better than I expected,"
she said. "I usually have trouble
hitting my irons, but I made some
solid shots."
While viewing the shallow
green on the 15th and bunkers off
the left on the straightaway 17th,
Dunn said to herself, "It'd sure be
nice to par this."
Sure enough, Dunn did better
than par with birdies on both
holes, using a 9-iron on the 130-
yard 15th and a 4-iron on the 165-
yard 17th.
While the classic-style course
built in 1894 was Uned with trees,
teammates said it was nothing like
the Ford-Ord Bayonet course in
Monterey. The team struggled on
that course for a lOth-place finish
at a tourney last month.
But the lush fairways and
weathered oak trees at Washing
ton did little to instill confidence
and calm the nerves of some play
ers. Despite roomy fairways and
smooth, flat greens, freshman Jae
Jean Ro said she could not hit her
ball well.
"It's pretty nice and all, but I
found it very frustrating," Ro said.
"I couldn't get my [shots] up and
down on the greens."
Ro, who finished '25th with 232
(79-74-79), fared her best on the
second round when she scored 1-
over-par 74.
Teammate An Irea Baxter also
tied Ro with 232 (77-73-82). The
senior, ranked second nationally,
also earned All-Pac-10 honors at
the tournament.
Sophomore Michelle Sperry,
who scored 240 at last year's Pac
10s, finished 39th with 239 (80-74-
85).
The team will now prepare for
the upcoming NCAA West Region
als in Tucson, Ariz.
