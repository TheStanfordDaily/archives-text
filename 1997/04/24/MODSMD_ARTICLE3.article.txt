## Evangelical student organizations show a variety of membership and methods 
### Julia Beeson 
The diversity of religious
practice at Stanford is re
flected in one of its largest
faiths, Christianity. Even in
this one religion, there are
many different fellowships

that celebrate their faith in distinct
ways
There are about 20 Christian orga
nidations on campus that offer Bible
study groups, retreats and other com
munity-building activities. Besides the
group setting, the fellowships also offer
opportunity for individual spiritual
growth.
Michelle Atkins, who graduated

with a bachelor's in psychology in
1993, is the current campus director of
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship She
said the fellowship exists to "provide
students with opportunities to take a
fresh look at the Jesus of their Sunday
School upbringing or theii CIV section
and to decide how they want to respond
to him "
The nondenominational fellowship
one of the larger groups on campus, has
about 150 members
"Intervarsity also provides a setting
for students desiring to grow in their
relationships with Jesus to do so to
gether," Atkins said
Freshman membei Annie Liu
agreed that the fellowship brings fel

low Christians together to celebrate
their faith.
"The purpose of Intervarsity is to
provide the student community of
Stanford with a group of fellow believ
ers to promote the growth of a Christ
ian's spiritual life and to commune
.vith others who share similai beliefs
said Liu
When Liu was selecting a fellow
ship she visited other Christian
groups on campus, including Campus
Crusade foi Christ, Harvest Christian
Fellowship and Fellowship in Christ at
Stanford, she said She chose Intervar
sit} because she en joyed its large group
setting.
Atkins pointed out thi different

faces of Intervarsity fellowship
"IV\s primary focus is on the small
groups that meet weekly foi Bible
study sharing, praying and hanging
out 'Atkins* said The.'entire fellowship
meets onc< - month foi a large group
celebration jo n sis ting of worship and
.1 .-ipeakcrand quarterly foi weekend
conferences off'campus
"Much of oui activity though hap
pens informally when groups of us get
togethei foi all kinds of fun and mean
ingful outings, Atkins said
Despite some differences, there is
interaction among the different Chris
tian fellowship. l it Stanford Recently

Intervarsity co-sponsored a win
ter conference in the Santa Cruz
Mountains with Campus Crusade
and Athletes in Action, two other
Christian groups on campus.
"Beyond that (winter confer
ence), we participate in many of
the joint activities other campus
fellowships sponsor, and we are
connected more significantly
through friendships among the
staff and students," Atkins said.
Another Christian fellowship
on campus, the Asian American
Christian Fellowship, is open to
all students but is primarily aimed
at Asian Americans.
"The purpose of AACF is to
provide a place of fellowship for
Christian students, to develop
student leadership and to evange
lize the good news of Jesus
Christ," said staff member Ken
Fong.
Besides its obvious focus on
the Asian-American student, the
Asian-American fellowship also
encourages student initiative and
leadership. One distinguishing
factor of this specific fellowship is
the role of the Asian-American
fellowship staff.
"Staff workers, paid or volun
teer, have more advisory roles as

opposed to leadership roles," Fong
said.
The Asian-American fellow
ship is one of the smaller fellow
ships on campus, with a member- 1
ship of about 25 people.
" AACF at Stanford typically at-;
tracts Christians who are more
comfortable in smaller groups,"!
Fong said.
The fellowship holds weekly,
large group meetings, various(
small groups for Bible or topical'
study, meal groups, various social
activities, an annual retreat and
occasional activities with Asian-
American fellowships from other
campuses.
Like Intervarsity fellowship,
Asian-American fellowship inter
acts with other evangelical Christ
ian groups on campus.
"AACF maintains a formal re
lationship with its parent organi
zation, Japanese Evangelical Mis
sionary Society as well as many in
formal relationships with church
es in the community who support
us with speakers, teachers and
prayer," Fong said.
Athletes in Action is a Christ
ian group on campus gives Christ
ian athletes at Stanford an oppor
tunity to share their faith with
teammates and other athletes.
The fellowship holds monthly
large group meetings, called "Life
in the PAC-lOs," and weekly Bible
studies.
