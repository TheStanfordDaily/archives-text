# Fellowships of faith
## Evangelical student organizations show a variety of membership and methods 
### Julia Beeson 
The diversity of religious
practice at Stanford is re
flected in one of its largest
faiths, Christianity. Even in
this one religion, there are
many different fellowships

that celebrate their faith in distinct
ways
There are about 20 Christian orga
nidations on campus that offer Bible
study groups, retreats and other com
munity-building activities. Besides the
group setting, the fellowships also offer
opportunity for individual spiritual
growth.
Michelle Atkins, who graduated

with a bachelor's in psychology in
1993, is the current campus director of
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship She
said the fellowship exists to "provide
students with opportunities to take a
fresh look at the Jesus of their Sunday
School upbringing or theii CIV section
and to decide how they want to respond
to him "
The nondenominational fellowship
one of the larger groups on campus, has
about 150 members
"Intervarsity also provides a setting
for students desiring to grow in their
relationships with Jesus to do so to
gether," Atkins said
Freshman membei Annie Liu
agreed that the fellowship brings fel

low Christians together to celebrate
their faith.
"The purpose of Intervarsity is to
provide the student community of
Stanford with a group of fellow believ
ers to promote the growth of a Christ
ian's spiritual life and to commune
.vith others who share similai beliefs
said Liu
When Liu was selecting a fellow
ship she visited other Christian
groups on campus, including Campus
Crusade foi Christ, Harvest Christian
Fellowship and Fellowship in Christ at
Stanford, she said She chose Intervar
sit} because she en joyed its large group
setting.
