### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team (6-8) was stunned by Sono
ma State 28-13 in the first round
of the playoffs for the Western
Collegiate Lacrosse League. This
game proved particularly bitter
because it was the final game of
;i somewhat successful season.
Stanford entered the playoffs
seeded fourth, while Sonoma
State was favored and seeded
second. Because Stanford trav
eled to Sonoma for the game, it
was overwhelmed by the
tremendous support of the Cos
sack fans.

The Cardinal began the game
strongly, building a 5-4 lead by
the first quarter. The early part
of the game was highlighted by
the enormous solo effort by
sophomore midfielder Brian
Auld. With a series of deft
maneuvers he scored the crucial
goal with an approach from
behind the goalie.
Unfortunately, Stanford was
unable to maintain the lead. The
team began to lose confidence
when the Cossacks began a
lengthy scoring run in the sec
ond quarter. This shook the Car
dinal, and several problems
occurred as a result. Stanford
did not have possession of the

ball for long periods, and many
of the leading players failed to
capitalize on key opportunities.
Sonoma's 11-point scoring
run lasted into the third quar
ter, and Stanford was unable to
rebound. Coach Peter Bijesse
attempted to rebuild the team's
confidence by the half, and this
resulted in Stanford's improve
ment by the last quarter.
"As a team we matched their
physical abilities and aggressive
attitude, but they had good interi
or passing and played an all
around better game," said junior
midfielder Ryan Page. He played a
solid game and contributed to the
offsetting of the Cossacks' run.

Senior captain Clay Akiwen
zie and junior Ronald Rhea who
each scored several goals against
Sonoma's brutal defense toward
the end of the contest.
Although Stanford ended its
season with a loss, the Cardinal
did achieve success in being the
first Stanford team in four years
to qualify for the playoffs. Many
players feel optimistic about
next season.
Although five players are
leaving, including the four cap
tains, Bijesse is actively recruit
ing new players. As a new coach,
he has made substantial
advances in the team's playing
ability and attitude.
