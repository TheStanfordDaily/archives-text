# Three from Farm taken in NFL draft

### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Last weekend, while the
Stanford football team was busy
preparing for the 1997 season
with spring drills, four departing
seniors celebrated the extension
of their football careers, as signi
fied by their selection in the 1997
NFL draft.
Tight end Greg Clark, a third
round pick of the San Francisco
49ers (77th pick overall), was the
first Stanford player chosen and
went the highest of any Cardinal
player since 1993, when corner
back Darrien Gordon was a first
round choice (22nd overall) of
the San Diego Chargers. Wide
receiver Brian Manning and
offensive linemen Brad Badger
and Nathan Parks were also
taken.
The 49ers traded up nine
spots in the third round to nab
Clark, a 6-foot-4, 262-pounder
who is expected to step in as the
backup to starting tight end
Brent Jones. Clark, who served a
two-year Mormon mission and
then played at Ricks Junior Col
lege in Idaho before transferring
to Stanford in 1995, is already
older than many NFL players,
having turned 25 on April 7.
He is a strong blocker with
good hands who also doubles as a

long snapper. Clark caught 48%
passes for 537 yards in two years
at Stanford, including bowls. <
The biggest surprise of the**,
four was undoubtedly Manning,
who was benched five games
into the 1996 season because of;
a bad knack for dropping passes. *
Manning, who nonetheless fin
ished his Stanford career among
the school's top 10 in several
receiving categories, elevated his <
draft stock with sparkling per
formances in the East-West
Shrine Game — where he won"
MVP honors — and at the Indi
anapolis scouting combine. Sun
day he was rewarded with a,
sixth-round selection by the *
Miami Dolphins.
Badger, a 6-4, 285-pound,
guard, went to the Washington'
Redskins in the fifth round. He!
wus the anchor of an offensive
line riddled with injuries in»
1996. One of those injuries
belonged to Parks, a 6-6, 302-
pounder who missed three
games last season but stills
impressed scouts enough to earn
a seventh-round selection from
the Kansas City Chiefs.
Not since 1993 have more
Stanford players been selected in •
the draft. Offensive tackle Jeff
Buckey, a seventh-round pick of,
the Dolphins, was the lone selec- -<
tion in 1996.
