## Cahill travels past the Peruvian jungle, the North pole and literary genius 
### 
"Pass the Butterworms"
by Tim Cahill
Villard Books, 1997
Some layout editor with a very strange sense of humor
decided to inscribe the words, "Praise for Tim Cahill" at the
top of the back cover of CahiU's most recent book, "Pass the
Butterworms: Remote Journeys Oddly Rendered." Sadly,
like most back covers, the "praise" is misleading at best.
According to the sources quoted (and reputable ones at
that), Cahill's book is the tie plus ultra in travel / adventure
literature: "wonderfully funny and observant," "rare," "the
life of adventure." Although "Pass the Butterworms" is
quaint and interesting, these quotes are excessive.
"Pass the Butterworms" is the latest in a string of travel
adventure books by Cahill, who also wrote the enigmatical
ly titled "Jaguars Ripped My Flesh," "A Wolverine is Hating
My Leg" and "Pecked to Death by Ducks." In "Pass the But-

terworms," Cahill con
tinues his tradition of
describing his various
adventures around the
world, from the plains
of Mongolia to the ice
fields near the North
Pole.
All of Cahill's so
journs are interesting,
though sometimes a
tad long-winded. For
example, he spends
pages and pages de
scribing the emotion
al trauma his friend,

Paul, suffered while tramp
ing through the Peruvian
jungle in search of his son's
killer. Sad? Terribly so. Fas
cinating for readers? Not

quite.
In other parts of the book, Cahill presents random ad
venture fantasies that again are interesting but not what a
reader might expect. At one point, he imagines that he's in a
small commuter plane when Freddy the pilot declares, "I
think 1 ate some had fish last night" and passes out. What to
do? Cahill goes through an entire fantasy in which the Na
tional Guard sends a plane to escort him to a safe landing.
Afterward, he imagines that he's "married to Sharon Stone"
and has "won millions of dollars in a multistate lottery." Yes,
this is random.
Other than the long, boring parts and the unexpected
randomness, "Pass the Butterworms" is not a had book.
There's lots of humor, particularly in Cahill's entertaining
tales about encounters with various strangers and animals.
His experience with unfriendly monkeys in the jungles of
Honduras could send anyone into convulsions of laughte : .
These are not your typical monkeys. From hiding spots in the
trees, they launch their "fecal depth charges" with incredible
accuracy. Where else can you read about monkey bombs?
When Cahill really gets into it, his stories come to life. He
wants people to imagine that they are traveling with him
when they read his words, and sometimes, it actually hap
pens.
His trip to the North Pole on a Russian icebreaker is an
example of his more successful tales. Cahill's everyday lan
guage manages to glue the reader to the page. You can almost
imagine standing on the deck of the ship, looking out upon
the frigid wasteland of the Arctic, listening to him describe

.
to you the intricacies of "blocks of ice the size of football|
fields, of whole city blocks, of entire cities."
Cahill also provides fascinating historical and political
information on the areas he visits. While in Mongolia, he
discusses the life and achievements of Genghis Khan. In the
Aleutian Islands, he goes back to 1741, when Vitus Bering
sailed two ships into the Aleutians. In Central America, he
offers insight into the turbulent political situation. He ac-
complishes all of this without the wordy pomp of other his-
torical and political writers.
Unfortunately, everyday language is a double-edged
sword in Cahill's hands. While it brings his tales to life in
some parts, it also plagues the book with intermittent grade-
school verbiage, strange descriptions and incomplete sen-
tences. For instance, as you skim along a fascinating section
about kayaking in the Pacific Northwest, a sentence without
a verb pops up. Whether this peculiarity is the fault of the
writer or the editor is debatable, but the effect is nevertheless
disconcerting.
Ultimately, "Pass the Butterworms" is a fun book to read
though not quite a work of literary genius. It probably caters
to a very targeted audience — readers of outdoorsy maga-
zines like "Outside," of which Cahill is a founding editor.
The style of his writing is extremely similar to that of maga-
zine articles, particularly airline in-flight magazines. So if
you enjoy that kind of reading, you'll probably enjoy "Pass
the Butterworms."
