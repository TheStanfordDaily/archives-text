of the many health care issues of
children so as to lead the advoca
cy component of the founda
tion," Behrman added.
In a letter to the board,
Behrman said "The search com
mittee clearly felt that [Peeps'l
combination of senior public af
fairs and fund raising experi
ence, together with his immedi
ate standing in both the local and
University committees, would
serve the foundation well in
building bridges and establish
ing strategic partnerships."
Peeps is currently associate
vice president for development at
Stanford. He has also served as the
associate vice president for public
affairs and has worked in the Of

fice of Medical Development.
Peeps said he is leaving Stan
ford, where he earned his under
graduate degree in 1974 and
worked for the next 23 years, for
a combination of reasons. His
motivation, he said, came both
from the fact that this appoint
ment was a "professional oppor
tunity to build something from
the ground up" and from his
"deep personal interest in the
cause."
Peeps also added that there is a
very personal reason for his deci
sion to accept the position dealing
with children's health care. "My
wife and I had a baby girl a year
ago who spent the first week of
her life in the children's hospital's
intensive care unit," Peeps said.
"I have no doubt that our lit
tle girl would not be a year old if
she did not have the benefits of
what the hospital provides."
