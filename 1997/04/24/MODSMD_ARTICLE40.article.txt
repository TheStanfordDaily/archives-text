# 40th San Francisco International Film Festival Preview
## TAKE A SNEAK PEEK AT THE OLDEST, BOLDEST FILM FESTIVAL IN AMERICA. 
### 
When writing about this year's San Francisco International Him
Festival, there are some numbers one can't help but mention: the
number of films (191), the number of countries represented (39),
the number of years it has run (40, making it the oldest festival in
North America) and the number of actors / directors / producers
attending (150, averaging 10 a day).
Hearing these statistics, it's easy to teel overwhelmed. However,
this event is not to be feared but taken advantage of. In that spirit,
here's a preview of the 15-day long festival that starts today.
Let's begin with the movies. These are generally divided into two
categories. The first is comprised of Golden (late Award-winners
short films, documentaries and television productions chosen
by Bay Area juries for merit in genres as varied as biographies,
music videos and public service announcements. Sixty-one of
these will be shown this year, including the Oscar-winning animat
ed short "Quest" and the Oscar-nominated "Canhead" (animated
short), "La Salla" (animated short) and "Mandela" (documentary).
Although all of these Golden Gate awardees deserve viewing, peo
ple following the actor-turned-director phenomenon may be par
ticularly interested in Anjelica Huston's directorial debut, a TV fea
ture titled "Bastard Out of Carolina."
The second category is comprised of new films, retrospectives,
awards and tributes. These make up the bulk of the festival. Many
films are simply new or having their U.S. or world premieres. But
some "new" films are actually freshly restored or rediscovered
prints of old films, such as the 75-mm restoration of "Vertigo"
(1958), shown last year, or this year's "The Matinee Idol" (1928), a
recently recovered and restored film by Frank Capra.
Old films will have their day as well (their second, actually) at
this year's "Indelible Images" series, a retrospective of past festival
favorites chosen by Bay Area notables such as Danny Glover and
Francis Ford Coppola. Other oldies will be shown at award presen
tations and tributes, including "The Grifters" at the Peter). Owens
Award presentation to Annette Bening. "Lucky Luciano" will be
shown when Italian director Francesco Rosi receives the Akira
Kurosawa Award for lifetime achievement, and "Conspirators of
Pleasure" will accompany Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer's re
ceipt of the Golden Gate Persistence of Vision Award for lifetime
achievement in the arena of shorts, documentary and television.
For the first time, the Mel Novikoff Award will be given to two re
cipients for promoting public appreciation of world cinema: film
critic Judy Stone and the Bay Area nonprofit Film Arts foundation.
Films will be shown at those ceremonies as well.
Of the 150 guests coming to present or toast films, some will cer
tainly spill stardust all over the audience. France will loan us resi
dent goddess Catherine Deneuve to promote her new movie, "Ge
nealogies of a C Time," and I long Kong will send fenune fa tale Mag
gie Cheung with her two latest films, "Irma Vep" and "Comrades,
Almost a Love Story."
Although groveling is well and good, after you get up from the
tloor be sure to make a beeline for the directors and producers
whose films you saw. Such an opportunity to talk to the people re
sponsible for what you've just watched is highly gratifying, as well
as hard to come by.
As Rachel Rosen, a festival programmer, put it, "To walk into the
(AMC) Kabuki and see |a local filmmaker] hanging out with Wern
er I ler/og, some audience members and a film star — that's an op
portunity that doesn't come around very often. It really adds a di
mension of life to the films and makes going to see them so much
more than just going to see a movie II

What

"Dream with the Fishes'* (U.S.) Shot in San Francis
co, this wild fantasy-fulfillment of two unlikely
companions says something — I'm still deciding
what — about going out with a bang.
"Love Serenade" (Australia) Reminding us that tin
best stories can happen in the middle of nowhere,
this slightly surreal comedy tracks the journey to
enlightenment of two sisters, who mistakenly think
the sage of their dreams is their new hippie D)
neighbor.
"Love! Valour! Compassion!" (U.S.) This is a Tony
Award-winning play translated to the screen, actors
and all — plus Jason Alexander of "Seinfeld." Mo\
ing, incisive and incredibly funny, this story about
the relationships of eight gay men is a must-see. Ad
vance tickets are sold out, but it opens in theaters on
May 16.
"Pour Rire (Just for Laughs!)" (France) Infidelity
reigns in the lives of everyone here, making for
many comic situations. But there's definitely a les
son behind the laughter, and some insight into
human nature as well.
"La Promesse" (Belgium) A realistic look into the
lives of illegal immigrant workers and their ex
ploiters, this film tells the story of a young boy
learning ethics the hardest, ugliest way possible.
Hope is not far away, however, as he learns to make
choices for himself.
"When the Cat's Away" (France) Based on a true
story, this "kitsch trash" (director's own words) film
is a reflective sigh on all the weird things that hap
pen to us when we're least expecting them — espe
cially in romance.
