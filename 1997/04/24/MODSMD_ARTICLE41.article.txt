## Medeski Martin and Wood brings modern jazz to the Fillmore 
### 
THE NEW YORK JAZZ-GROOVE TRIO
Medeski Martin and Wood played a superior set to a
sold-out Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco Friday
night, touring to support its Fifth and newest album, "Bub
blehouse." Without any serious radio airplay, Medeski Martin
and Wood has still managed to build a cross-country fan base
through frequent touring, bootleg trading (they allow free tap
ingot their shows), the Internet and word-of-mouth. More and
more people are discovering the "modern jazz aesthetic" the
band embodies, as John Medeski put it in an after-show inter

view.
MMW, as the band is known to its burgeoning audience,
blends jazz, hop, dance, funk and rock together into a capti

vating groove. The hand relies on the Quaalude-smooth

rhythm section of bassist Chris Wood and drummer

Hilly Martin to supply backdrops ranging from classic

jazz to tranced grooves. Keyboardist John Medeski
experiments over those varied sounds on a variety

of electric pre-digital keyboards that includes a
Hammond B-3 organ, a clavinet and a Wurl-

c — - - — — -
itzer electric piano.
Medeski clearly carries the weight of re

sponsibility in the band. MMW chose to es
chew vocals in the style of some classic jazz
combos, which means Medeski s task of
maintaining melodic leads and improvis
ing solos is that much more important.
Bassist Wood occasionally stepped up to
play lead lines and solo but seemed content
to let Medeski do most of the virtuoso work.
Martin held down the fort with dazzling
rhythmic drumming and left his kit only to

shake rattles and pound percussion instru
ments arrayed behind him for spacey improv
jams during which all three band members

went in different musical directions.
Friday night's set showcased Medeski's techni

cal excellence and artistic vision, which opened

with a jazzy groove centered around a single descend
ing riff from Wood. Seated between five different key

boards, one of which was a baby grand piano, Medeski
stabbed at his instruments to create percussive effects and

swung solos on the baby grand, even reaching into the piano's
guts to rake the strings with his hands.
The subdued blue and red lighting at the Fillmore gave the
room a sensual, jazz-club feel, reinforcing the sense that the
band was focused on the sophistication and emotion of its
music and not concerned with the rock-star egos that modern
jam-bands often fail to suppress. When Martin made band in
troductions in his thick New York accent, Medeski and Wood
bowed stiffly and smiled awkwardly at the thunderous audi
ence reception, betraying an

honesty and modesty that
is rare in professional mu
sicians and makes the sin
cere artistry of MMW's
music even more attrac
tive.
The crowd ranged

indicator of MMW's wide
spread appeal. The hand picked up the pace with the second
tune, a blistering funk-jazz number that not only reached its
infectious fingers into the audience but also had the band
members grooving and shaking over their instruments.
The third song of the set was a cacophonous jazz freak-

out that bled into a bluesy groove in which Wood played a com
manding electric solo while Martin jammed on a tambourine.
Wood then picked up an acoustic bass lor the next tune, pluck
ing a funky line while Medeski jazzed a repetitive line into an as
tral, ambient tog and Martin put down a tribal backdrop of rat
tles and other percussion. Unable to retrain from jamming with
the band, the audience began clapping in time with the languid
jazzy bass groove that fol
lowed.

The set

ended with the explo
sive "Bubhlehouse," a rhythmic exploration of
tempo that is also the title track of the new five-song
EP. "Bubhlehouse" is straight off of MMVV's recent
fourth full-length release, "Shack-man," which also
includes original recordings of "Spy Kiss" and"I >rac
ula," two tracks that are remixed on the new IP.
The remixes done by several different New
York DJs bearonly slight resemblance to the orig
inal recordings and move into very different
realms with varied success. The legendary John
Zorn contributed alto saxophone to the impres
sive trance-groove "Dracula Remix" done by I)J
Logic, which stands out among the other tracks.
"Mancha," another track from the new I P, is a
blistering New Orleans funk tune, and MMW
played it as the first of two encores Friday. The
Crescent City funkiness blended into a mellow,
loungy groove to end the evening, and Martins
"Buena noche" to the crowd was warmly received,
despite mutterings about the set's brevity. U
