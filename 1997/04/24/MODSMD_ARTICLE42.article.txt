Mat-moving for the gymnastics team. Selling Valentine's Day flowers. Subjecting their impressionable
minds to warping psych studies. The Rinconada frosh have put themselves through hell for our enjoy
ment. Why? As tradition dictates, Rinc residents have been slaving away since the start of winter quar
ter to bring the 20th annual Rinc-A-Delt to life.
