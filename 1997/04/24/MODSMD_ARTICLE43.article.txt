### 
Souls of Mischief is one successful part of a hip-hop dy
nasty, you could say. Hieroglyphics, a consortium of Bay
Area hip-hop artists including the group, is coming out with
a record this summer titled, "Hieroglyphics Family Album."
Two of the other members of Hieroglyphics, Del and Casu
al, will perform with Souls at Rinc-A-Delt, bringing some of
the family talent to campus.
Souls consists of rappers Tajai, Opio, Phesto and A-I'lus.
They've been together since 1989.

"We grew up in Hast ()akland as friends; rapping was a hobby since elementary school," said A-Plus,
who is also a writer and producer for Souls. "We were raised on hip-hop culture.... It's damn near like
a religion. Ever since we were kids. Even if people asked me what I was going to be when I was 9 years old
I would say a rap star. I lip-hop is just a way of life. It's a blessing."
After releasing two albums with a major label, Souls, along with the other members of Hieroglyph
ics, formed their own label.
We own it. We finance it. We make all the money," said A-Plus. "Now we're utilizing the audience
| the majors] helped us create."
As part of the international hip-hop underground, he said, the group has something "kind of like a
Grateful Dead following."
We create mischief on the mike. I hat s how we come off," said A-Plus, describing the origin of the
group's name. "We're not related, but we're old souls, you know?
Our main focus is making stuff tor our fans. We can't really put into words how much we appreci
ate our fans. We're not just out here trying to be stars. We like hip-hop culture as much as the fans do."
This Saturday, you can look forward to unusual hip-hop. A-Plus described it as "progressive — not
what everybody else is doing. It has a certain edge."

"WE WERE RAISED ON HIP-HOP CULTURE IT'S DAMN NEAR LIKE A

RELIGION. EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS. EVEN IF PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT I WAS
GOING TO BE WHEN I WAS 9 YEARS OLD I WOULD SAY A RAP STAR. HIP-HOP IS
JUST A WAY OF LIFE. IT'S A BLESSING. "
