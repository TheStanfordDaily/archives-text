# Rubberneck

### 
Rubberneck makes funky, jazzy and
very danceable music with sparse vocals.
Kicardo (like Madonna), who started
the band and plays guitar and provides
some of the vocals, calls it "funk music
with a Latin twist." The musicians can
easily switch from a relaxed, jazzy sound
with plenty of improvisation to a pol
ished, groovin' rhythm.
Ricardo's brother, Pablo Ojeda, plays
bass in Rubberneck, and the other

members are John Morrow (a.k.a. Silky Love) on saxophone; Mike Barber (a.k.a. M&M or Money Mike — because, as Ricardo
[nit it, lie takes care of the money ); Joe Porter, who does keyboard and vocals; and Bryan Foxworth, who also does vocals as well
as drums. While the band is 5 years old, the present line-up is 2 years old, and Foxworth has been with Rubberneck for only about
a month.
Rubberneck's difficult to categorize sound may be a result of the band's eclectic tastes. Ricardo said that each member likes dif
ferent kinds of music: Everything from John C.oltrane to bob Marley. The old school stufi like James Brown and Sly Stone."
I heir name has nothing to do with car accidents.
We used to check out the old Motown videos — the band would be moving their heads back and forth and biting their lips,
rubbernecking," Ricardo said.
The band is currently working on an album because there has been some label interest.
I think that the future |of theband |is going to be dictated by 1997-98,"said Ricardo. But despite its success, he said, "We don't
t.ike it too seriously. We try to have a good time.... I think that we re on one big field trip, like to the zoo, but we just haven't got
ten there yet. A lot of people are unhappy, but we're happy with what we do."
Ricardo said students can look out for "real good dancing music" on Saturday.
We party, that s all, said Ricardo. Its .ill original.... We don't wear funny 70s clothes. We just play our shit."

"I THINK THAT WE'RE ON ONE BIG FIELD TRIP, LIKE TO THE ZOO,
BUT WE JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET."
