## INXS "Elegantly Wasted" 
### 
Hvery band has to screw up at least once in
their career, and luckily INXS has already filled
its quota. The hand has mellowed out from the
angst-ridden and repetitive juvenile ramblings
of "Full Moon, I )irty I learts." In its most recent
effort, "Klegantly Wasted," INXS has returned

to the dark, reflective style of "Welcome to
Wherever You Are," while keeping some of the
vibrant energy that carried "Kick" and earlier
albums through the '8()'s.
I.ike "lull Moon," "I legantly Wasted"
is a '90s experiment in different styles, but it

still keeps to the basic elements of
the distinctive INXS sound. If
nothing else, the band has taken a
turn for the stranger, as is evident
in the absurdist liner note photos.
(One features a policeman head
butting a red firebird.)
"Don't Lose Your Head"
picks up with somesped-up bluesy
bass rhythms and some uncon
trolled shout-singing, while
"Searching" features soulful Mar
vin (iaye-esi|ue melodies and a
quiet but slightly funked up guitar.
The title track contains all
the classic INXSelements heavy,
deliberate guitars and deep, thick
vocals with steady moving bass line
and simple drum beats. Showing
the band's conversion to the '90s,
the song presents yet another fatal
istically cynical view of the world:
"We run / We hide / We wait and we
want / Ihe good life / Aw sure /
You're right / I his ain't the good
life."
Few of the songs are more
optimistic, but "(.irl on I ire" does
include a lively horn section. This

song is a little too reminiscent of "Disco Infer
no," however, as lead singer Michael Hutchence
chants the chorus "baby burn, hum, burn."
Break out the polyester bell-bottoms.
On an untraditional ballad, "We Are
Thrown Together," the hand seems to
throw together snippets from a hunch of
different songs, giving this one an exotic
and eerie sound. The elements work well
together to create a romantic and
thoughtful tune.
"Shake the Tree" is borderline heavy
metal, and almost makes you worried that
you've bought an Alice Cooper CD. In a bit of
recycling, the song uses the same eastern chant
effect that begins "Questions," the first track on
"Welcome," but other than that, it carries itself
very well with creative rhythms and accompa
niment.
Although the album exudes energy and a
renewed creative effort on the part of INXS, a
few melodies and structural ideas hint vaguely
of reuse. The very beginning intro sequence of
"I)on't lose Your I lead' almost had me think
ing I was listening to Simon and Garfunkel's
"The Boxer," and many of the other chorus
lines mirror the band's older songs.
This album could not compare to either
"Kick" or "Welcome," but it is a gratefully re
ceived retreat from the bomb that was "Full
Moon." As Hutchence proclaims in "She is
Rising," "She is rising above this world / She is
heading for an open door." INXS has defi
nitely started to climb again.
