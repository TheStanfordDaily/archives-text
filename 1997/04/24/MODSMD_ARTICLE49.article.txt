## "Blur" 
### 
for com lortable ami weathered Mlur fans,
the fnglish pop outfit's latest is nothing less
than shocking. (lone are Mini 's catchy cho
rns hooks and snappy lightheaded lyrics.
Amazingly, Mini has undergone a facelift
th.it lew will understand.
for confused listeners, "eclectic" may be
the verbal medication needed to ease there
cenl growing pain. "Mlur" is the antithesis of
the concept alhuin and delves into the aged
rockers' fantasies ol uninhibited genre hop
ping. "Song 2,' the album's single, is domi
nated by Pavement style guitars, driving
with relentless rilling and lacking any
melodic sweetness.
Yet far cries have never been so close to
one another. "Meetlebum," the opening
track on this uiulassifiahlc opus, is a mod
erni/ed classic era tune that may be more
comlortahic on the Meatles Anthology than
as Mritain's latest. With |ohn I ennon resur
reeled by Mini frontman Damon Alharn,
"Meetlebum" c|uickly becomes territory well
explored. The follow ingtrack, "t ountrv Sad
Mallad Man" is, ,h unexpected, a twangy
country style ditty.
Of course, no discussion about Mini is

complete without a discussion of the group's
recent thrashing at the hands of the in
domitable Oasis. In the current pop envi
ronment, perhaps a post mortem challenge
to pronounced champs may seem desperate.
Simply stated, poppy hook laden choruses
in the typical Mlur style may be old and tir
ingly defeated. Yet for Mlur, the recent explo
sion of Oasis 011 both sides of the Atlantic
may prove to be beneficial — an opportuni
ty to dismiss petty sparrings and explore
other avenues of musical expression.
Though few critics seem willing to warm
to Mini's latest stab at grace, there are cer
tainly redeeming aspects to this album.
Americanized as it is, Mlur oddly seems com
tollable in their new element. (Surprise,sur
prise a group of Mritish melody-makers
actually turn out to have a complex and di
verse musical outlook!) "On Your Own," a
complete hybrid of Mrit pop and main
stream alternative, comes complete with
vocal harmonies and quirks, unexpected
sound effects and a rediscovered eccentrici
ty. I he tune ends up as a pleading chant, "So
take me home, don't leave me alone / I 'm not
that uood, but I'm not that bad."

As confusing as this album is, perhaps
such a plea may be just the thing: Try it — it's
not that good, but it's not that bad, either.
— Paul Resnikoff
