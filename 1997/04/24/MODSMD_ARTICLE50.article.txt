# The
						Make-Up
## "Sound Verite" 
### 
Occasionally, you hear a song and you
know the album is going to be mind-blow
ipg. "Have U Got the New look?" off of
The Make-Up's latest album, "Sound
Verite," is such a song. The soothing pop
woven by guitar, organ and feathery drums
is the perfect counterpart to lan Svenonius'
plaintive wails, making the song a master
piece. And as I explored the rest of the
album, my instinct was validated.
Before I sat down to write my review, I
had to overcome a few mental blocks.
First of all, Svenonius, along with drum
mer Steve Gamboa and guitarist James
Canty, used to be members of Nation of
Ulysses, who were undoubtedly "too hip
for this planet." However, The Make-Up
probably would come in a close second if
the two bands had a hipness contest.
Second, the liner notes warned me not
to review the album if "the review would
inevitably lead to the subject being assim
ilated into the vulgar world it proposes to
assassinate, isolating it for defusing, reab
sorption, and ultimate recuperation."
Seven other intense conditions joined
forces with this one, forcing me to swallow
hard as I sat down at the keyboard.
The Make-Up successfully join raw
proto-funk with shimmery indie pop,
tossing in Svenonius' painful, almost
screeching vocals to give their sound just
the right balance of angst and emotion.
While "Have U Got" is the most distinc
tive avatar of this "sound verite," there arc
plenty of gems on the album.
On "If They Come in the Morning,"
Svenonius shrieks his conspiracy-laden
warning over slow, rhythmic, stripped
down drums and bass joined by intermit
tent notes from a dubbed out organ. The
paranoia continues on "Tell It Like It Will
Be," with Svenonius moaning "There's
somebody watching me / I'm telling you!
Somebody's after me! / Somebody's after
me" over lazy bass and drumming that
sounds as if Gamboa were using a table
top for his instrument.
Possibly the most musical piece on the
whole album is "What's the Rumpus?" an
instrumental variation on "Have You
Got." It features energetic fuzzed-out gui
tars layered over drums and organ and
fades into a slow, melancholy, space-rock,
sitar-like guitar solo at the end.
Perhaps, though, you should get the
album so that you can "understand that
the struggle of culture vs. MAKE-UP is
the struggle vs. destiny, the struggle to
stop history itself."
