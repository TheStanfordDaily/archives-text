## "Shaming of the Sun" 
### 
The electrified energy of the Indigo C .iris'
new album, "Shaming of the Sun," does indeed
shame the sun.
In their sixth album, the Indigo Ciirls (Amy
Ray and Emily Saliers) add new color to the
pure voices, intricate guitar playing and poetic,
yet political lyrics that have always distin
guished their music from other folk duos.
I displaying a range of song types — from a
moving, woeful ballad to a folk-ified take on a
hip-hop pulse — this album, in stores April 29,
couples a diversity of musical styles with the
simple acoustic sound they have established as
their own.
Incorporating an eclectic variety of differ
ent instruments such as a string ensemble,
laos drums and a Native American vocal
group, the Indigo Girls manage to innovate
without diverging too far from their past work.
One notieable difference is that Saliers'
songs — usually more melodic and accessible
move with a new, harder edge, although for
the most part, they still retain an elegant vocal
purity
The album jump starts with the single
Shame on You," which is 100 percent pure
hied pop material yet still faithful to the style
lor which the Indigo Ciirls became famous. Its
upbeat tempo belies the political content, as
exemplified by this line sneaked in at the end:
blue lights flashin' down the long dirt road /
when they ask me to step out / they say we be
looking for illegal immigrants can we check
your car /1 say you know its funny I think we
were on the same boat back in 1694."
Ihe catchy, dance-y quality of the tune also
marks the following song, "Ciet Out the Map,"
by Saliers. Backed by a chorus, it is reminiscent
of the second song on their last album, "Least
(Complicated," and deserves to be just as popu
lar.
"Shed Your Skin" departs from the pop-ish
flavor of the first two songs and llirts with hip

hop instead. More monotone than melodic, it
rocks the listener with a hard-driving rhythm
that alternates with variations on the grooving
beat.
"It's Alright," an example of Saliers trying
her hand at composing with a more solid rock
teel, is one of the weaker songs on the album
at least in comparison to what she can do when
she makes voice and melody the focus of the
song. Luckily, this is what happens in the next
song.
"Caramia" brings together vivid, dream
like imagery, instrumental innovation and the
harmonized duet voices that make the Indigo
Ciirls so recognizable. Saliers' clear voice, with
Ray's huskier one, texturize words like these:
"For three nights straight now I dream I keep
both of my shoes but / I've forgotten my lines
and I've misplaced my cues, and there's / a sea
full of faces and a show to goon, and I'm struck
mute at / entrance with nothing to draw from."
Also particularly notable for its emotion
and evocative lyrics is Saliers' ballad, "Leeds,"
which begins, "It's dark at 4 p.m. in Leeds the
steeples pierce the skylight till the last of it
bleeds." Accompanied only by a piano, a hurdy
gurdy and a few light background vocals,
Saliers' voice, inflected and nuanced at every
word and chord, carries the listener into her
emotions: "Whatever this madness is in me
spinning like a top on a bed of / anxiety over a
deep dark drop down into nothingess into
withoutyouness."
Ray, an old pro with her unique female
rock style, pulls out a few more daz/.lers, like
"Scooter Boys." Here, she sounds like Peter
Garrett of Midnight Oil, and the lyrics are as
blatantly political as those of that Australian
band.
Diverse, innovative and emotive, these 12
songs will reaffirm old fans' love for this pair
and lure new listeners as well.
