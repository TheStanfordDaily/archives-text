## "Roll with the New" 
### 
Ladies and gentlemen, the nuilti tal
en ted comedy sensation, (lliris Rock. " Roll
with the New, ' Rock's latest venture, is not
a typical comedy album — about half of
the recording is taken from Rock's stand
up show at the Tacoma Theater in Wash
ington, D.(while the other hall isa series
of brief comic sketches.
The most hilarious short on "Roll" is
"Cheap Pete," a dialogue between Rock
and a used car salesman. "$7OO lor .1 imi
chim• that conditions the air?" questions .1
baffled Rock. "How about I give you $14,
you put a block of ice in the back seat?"
Pete also has .1 tough time understanding
the value of dual airhags. "Is there a prize
in the h.ig? Is it like .1 hig ol' cracker jack
bag? What the luck in the bag, slut. Mow
bout I give ya $8 you fill up two hefty bags
with some Jell-O. You know why I want
Jell O? Cause il I get in .1 crash, I wanna
have a little snack before the ambulance
comes."
In the standup routine, Rock goes
straight lor D.C.'s jugular, questioning
mayor Marion li.irry's appearance at the
Million Man March. "You know what that
means? It means that even in our finest
hour, we got a crackhead on stage!" lie
w,mts to know how Harry w.is re elec ted in
the first place. "If you smoke crack at Mc
Donald's, you can't get your job back!" he
reasons.
Kock has <1 field day with the ().J. Simp
son trial: "I ain't seen white people that

angry since I hoy car it clod M 4 A 4S4 11," says
Rot k." Black people way 100 happy, like
llry! Wc won! Wc won! Yny! Wc won! What
the jack did we win;' Everyday I look in I he
mailbox lor my (). J. prize. ... Null in'." The
true basis ol the trial, according to Rock,
was lame, not race. "II O.J. drove a bus, he
wouldn't even be ().|. I le'd be ()renlhal the
bus I >rivin' Murderer," s.iys Rock.
The album even lias a spool of content
porary R&B music, "Champagne." Ihe
song has ,i 11 the trademarks ol lousy R&B
music: c heesy synthesizers, .1 whiny female
lead, a "lough guy talking trash in the
batkground between lyrics and a male rap
vocal thrown in the middle lor 110 appar
cut reason. On "Another lace Song, a
woman sings about her broken heart and
late welfare c hecks.
Rock also touches on relationships in
Ins routine. Men don't have platonic
friends; wc just have women we haven I
fucked ycl," says Rock. You know what ,1
platonic friend is to a woman? It's like a
dick 111 a glass case. In case ol emergency,
break open glass."
" Roll" is succssful because it doesn't gel
old, even alter your roommate plays it
every day lor .1 week. Rock follows in the
footsteps of previous 110 holds barred
comics Richard I'ryor and I ddic Murphy
with Ins outrageous monologues, 100 bad
he couldn't have asked 111 I'eiiny to make
an appearance.
