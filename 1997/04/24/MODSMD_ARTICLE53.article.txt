# Muddy Waters
## "His Best, 1947-1955" 
### 
Muddy Waters was my introduction to the blues, and I still
think of him as the blues. Waters, born McKinley Morgan-
Held, worked picking cotton in Mississippi for the early years
of his life, playing Delta folk blues in the style of Son House at
weekend juke joints and rent parties. 1 le was 32 years old and
twice married before he moved to Chicago and recorded his
first single for Chess Records.
His first sides were basically the same folk blues he'd per
formed in Mississippi, only played on an electric guitar. It was
the same thing John Lee Hooker was doing in Detroit and was
aimed at homesick blacks who had moved north from the
Delta looking for work after World War 11. In a short time,
however, Waters was drastically altering the sound of the
blues, adding harmonica, bass, piano and drums. In doing so
he created modern urban blues and served as a catalyst for the
emergence of rock 'n' roll.
"His Best" is a compilation put together by the folks .it
( licss to celebrate the 50th anniversary of those first sessions.
All 12 ol the songs from the old "Best of Muddy Waters"
album are included here, and the CD is the perfect introduc
tion to this quintessential bluesman. 112 rom the sparse sound of
Muddy's early tracks, the sound gets progressively meatier as
lie adds more musicians. Almost all the songs feature the in
comparable Little Walter on harmonica, making John Popper
look like a clime store hack.
All the songs included here were written by Waters or by
blues mythos-maker supreme Willie Dixon, and are filled
with classic images of mojos, black cat bones, John the Con

queror root and a heaping mess of sex. Women cheating on
Waters, women Waters can't resist, women Waters should stay
away from lest their husbands kill him, and Waters telling the
world that no woman on God's green Earth can resist him and
even if they all lined up outside his door tomorrow he'd satis
fy every one and still have time for a good night out drinking
with his buddies.
Much has been made of Waters' role as the midwife for
rock V roll. After all, his song "Rollin' Stone" served as the
name for a band and a magazine you may have heard of, but
even if Elvis had stayed a truck driver and Hill Haley a coun
try warbler Waters would be well worth remembering.
While he may not have been as shrewd a storyteller as
Sonny Hoy Williamson or possessed the sheer ferocity of
I lowlin' Wolf, he had a passion and emotional delivery that
is unsurpassed. From the plaintive lament of "Long Dis
tance Call" to the cockswagger bravado of "I'm Your
1 loochie Coochie Man" Waters is in your face, pleading for
your sympathy, warning you about the ways of women or
ready to punch you out: "I'm drinkin' 'I NT. I'm smokin'
dynamite. I hope some screwball starts a fight!"
So for those of you who think you're a blues fan because
"The Blues Brothers" is your favorite movie or because Zep
pelin is rad, the time has come for you to put aside childish
things, fake out a picture of your most and least favorite girl
friend, buy a bottle of gin and this CD, and let Muddy preach
it to you.
