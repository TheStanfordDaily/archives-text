## "Disciplined Breakdown" 
### 
for Collective Soul, a "Disciplined
Breakdown" is not .1 mechanized way to get
lunkv. The group's latest, No. 3 in a hard to
categorize career, continues along themes of
salvation and soul searching. Combined
with the group's sonorous and inspiring in
strumental textures, the resulting mood is
near ethereal.
Such an outcome seems a hit out of char
acter with the group's main musical inllu
ences, which include Aerosmith, the Cars
and R.H.M. Vet underneath the apparent
paradox lies a Baptist pedigree, rooted in the
earthy nest of Stockbridge. Singer song
writer I'd Roland's success with these some
what alool rockers lies in his ability to com
bine loose lipped rock with enlightening
lyrics.
Yet even the most wholesome choirboys
are fair game to temptation. "Precious I >ecla
ration" opens "I )isciplined Breakdown" like a
Twisted Sister concert, driving with a hip hop
beat and sexy guitar. Yet underneath this grit
ty motif lies Roland's sangfroid demeanor:
"Once I jumped through hoops of fire / High
and tar as you required / I was blind but now
I see / Salvation has discovered me."
Is Roland simply rebounding heavily

into his prayerbooks? Unlikely, especially
when "Disciplined Breakdown" is viewed in
its entirety. On "Full Circle", a funky jazz riff
leads the way for Rolands healthier perspec
tive on romance: "I believe that love comes
round and round," elaborating his declara
tion by prophesizing, "One fine morning, I'll
awake/ Then reaffirm/ One fine morning, I'll
awake/ To love's return."
An even more wholesome and well
rooted lyrical philosophy is revealed on
some ot Collective Soul's other songs. On
"Maybe," Roland exhorts, "This blessed
ness of life / Sometimes brings me to my
knees / I call on thee." And in "Blame" he
sings, "When you unveil a conscience / and
with peace you agree / when love is your
constant / then lay that blame on me."
Net the real juice behind this group's
success lies in seamless and convincing
musical arrangements. Harmonies and
melodies were meant for one another, and
Roland harnesses the potentially unwieldy
horn section and synthesizer with tact.
"Disciplined Breakdown" is very listen
able, and holier themes are only meant for
those who really want to hear them.
