# The 						Boo Radleys
## "C'mon Kids" 
### 
Put The 800 Radleys in their Rock
field Studios in Wales and what do we
get? C'mon kids, what do we get?
That's right, "C'mon Kids" is the latest
CI) released by British export The 800
Radleys. This album comes after their
most successful album to date, "Wake
Up!" which was the last step in their long
climb to pop stardom. The single of the
same name was a smash hit in the United
Kingdom — no other song had more
radio airtime in London.
Prior to their latest release, The 800
Radleys have released five full-length
albums in addition to numerous sin
gles. Each one has successively in
creased their popularity in Europe and
the United Kingdom. The last album
was commonly thought by fans in the
UK to be the album of the year. Unfor
tunately, 800 did not win any popular
awards.
"C'Mon Kids" will probably not fare
any better than "Wake Up!" The pop /
rock style from "Wake Up!" has been di
luted with more experimentation. (Mar
tin, the band's frontman, does insist he's
much improved from the last experimen

tation album, "Giant Steps") About half
of the tracks on the CD are of the rock/
pop / alternative-ish genre. The others
fall into various new age, techno or even
folk song categories. Strangely, there is a
cohesion to all the tracks, even with such
diverse styles.
Their name will carry their new album
pretty far where they are already popular.
The 800 Radleys have not enjoyed as
much fame in the United States as they
have in the United Kingdom, and while
"C'Mon Kids" will certainly expand their
fan base in the United States, they will
not be ascend to the upper limits of the
U.S. pop scene with this album. The 800
Radleys know it's difficult to gain popu
larity in the United States, as they com
mented in an interview: "1 don't know,
I've got no idea about you Americans, I
really don't. You never know with
records."
Once he does know, that is, about us
Americans, he can be assured of success.
"The industry dictates you have to do
well in America because that's where the
money is."
