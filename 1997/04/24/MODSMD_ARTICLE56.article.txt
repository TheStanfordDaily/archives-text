## Paradise Road 
### 
Even though it's sentimental, Bruce Berestbrd's "Paradise
Road" counteracts potential sap with a good dose of history.
Periodically, a World War II movie comes out that explores
some surprising aspect of the war. "Schindler's List," for example,
told the story of a supposed Nazi sympathizer who saved many
Jews from the gas chamber. A little-seen film — but a very good
one — called "Come See the Paradise" brought to the screen an
interracial love affair challenged by the internment of Japanese
Americans.
In "Paradise Road," the newest addition to the genre, Ameri
can and European women interned in Sumatra find strength and
hope in music by forming a vocal orchestra. With documentary
like coldness, the film horrifies and saddens us with scenes ofbru
t.ilities committed by the Japanese against women and children,
hut it lacks a central focus.
I he cast sports a strong group of talented actresses, including
(ilenn Close as Adrienne Pargitcr, the founder and conductor of
the group, and recent Oscar-winner Frances McDormand as Dr.
Verstak, a somewhat mysterious and cynical character complete
with a German accent. Other players include Julianna Margulies
of "ER" fame as the only American in the bunch and Jennifer Ehle
as the wife of a British officer.

1 he problem is that these women only represent four of a myr
iad good actresses. The film has many characters with many ex
periences and mil enough time for their complete stories. This is
one of those rare films that should he a tad longer, even though it
already runs for about two hours. While Close gets top billing, the
film does not focus on her much more than any of the other char
acters. It's like being within reach of a smorgasbord but not being
allowed to taste anything.
In this case, the music could have been .1 great way to unify the
characters, themes and plots, especially because it served to unify
and reinforce the spirits of the women in real life. There is, how
ever, too little music. Although ('lose isa classically trained singer,
even she doesn't get to warble much.
On the whole, we are kept fairly distant from the Japanese
characters. Captors are shown entering the camp from the per
spective of the women, from behind the fence. I lowever, some ol
them are portrayed in a sympathetic light. In one particularly
poignant scene, one of the captors sings (Hose a Japanese lullaby.
Watch this movie for a fairly balanced view of history and not
for character development. Instead of being heartwarming, "Par
adise Road" is a history lesson — but it's one worth learning.
