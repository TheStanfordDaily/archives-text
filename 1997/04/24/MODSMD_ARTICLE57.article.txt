# Til There Was You
## 
### 
We go to romantic comedies expecting two
hours of corny mishaps and love-struck souls.
Unfortunately, "Til There Was You" doesn't
exactly fit this formula.
The film takes the approach of "Sleepless in
Seattle," keeping the lovers apart until the end.
But it loses one thing along the way: feeling. In
their attempt to create a new level of romantic
comedy, one in which the characters teeter be
tween a superficial depth and traditional light
headedness, director Scott Winant and
screenwriter Winnie Holzman lose our com
passion and leave us frustrated.
Gwen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is a 30-some
thing romantic who has always pictured meet
ing her dream man. After a history of disas
trous relationships, she has almost lost faith in
love. Little does she know her dream man has
been floating in and out of her life since she was
a child, and she is finally about to meet him.
That man is Nick (Dylan McDermott), a

handsome architect involved with his child
hood crush, sitcom has-been Francesca (Sarah
Jessica Parker). Francesca isn't deep enough
for Nick, and the film attempts to create a par
allel between Nick's profundity and (iwen's
sensitivity. Nick's and Gwen's characters, how
ever, are not developed enough to be elevated
above the others and definitely not light
enough to be likable and comedic.
Nick and Gwen have no emotional connec
tion to one another aside from a series of near
encounters and a number of typical Los Ange
les ties. Apparently, the filmmakers saw these
coincidences as sufficient reason for the two to
tall in love. But by the time Nick and Gwen
meet, we've become impatient with the slow,
unengaging story and distracted by an entan
glement of serious and heart-wrenching sub
plots (like the plight of an old, senile woman
and her home of 50 years).
Aside from a few key performances, the act

ing is marginal, Parker has sonic good mo
ments as the affected ex-child actor and Mi
Dermott charms us, although more with his
looks than his talent. The most vital scene is .1
heart-to-heart between ( iwen and her father
(Michael Tucker). Although Tripplehorn
nearly ruins it with her theatrical neurosis,
Tucker holds true to the scene .ind gives the
film its one shining moment.
This scene, however, is not powerful enough
to save the rest of the picture. The main charac
tersare not dynamic, and the desire to see them
together doesn't invade our hearts as ii did in
"Sleepless in Seattle." The whole point ol the
"Sleepless" plot is that we fall in love with the
characters, so much that we .ire unable to con
tain our desire for them to finally meet. " I il
There Was You" combines an unemotional
story with confused characterization to create a
work that falls short ol its intentions.
