# Murder at 1600

### 
Without revealing too many of the twists and turns
in this well-made action-adventure, 1 will try to de
scribe "Murder at 1600" as best as I can.
Washington police Det. Harlan Regis (Wesley
Snipes), a history buff, is called in to investigate the
White I louse murder of(larla Town, a mysterious, at
tractive government employee who has been closely
watched by the Secret Service. Acting as Regis' liaison
to the White House security force, Olympic-sharp
shooter turned Secret Service agent Nina Chance
(Diane lane) slowly guides the suave detective
through the bowels of White House security. At one
point, she even breaks into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
with Regis at her side.
first term president lack Neil (Ronny ( ox) now has
two serious problems on his hands: There is an on
going hostage crisis in North Korea, and there was a

murder in his house. Many of his closest associates, in
cluding National Security Adviser Alvin Jordan (Alan
Alda), push him to take action and attempt to bring
home all of the hostages. The president, however hesi
tates to make a decision on the North Korea issue.
Behind all the security cameras in the executive
mansion is Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), the
adamant head of White House security. We assume
that he has the videotape which reveals Town's killer.
Unfortunately, that footage is out of the hands of Regis,
who employs various means to try to get that restricted
evidence.
We are also introduced to Pet. Stengel (Dennis
Miller), Regis' sidekick. He provides mild amounts of
humor hut essentially is a throw-away character.
With this assortment of characters in place, the mys
tery behind Town's death begins to unfold. Accusations

arc thrown all over the place in order
to mask the true killer, and truth
seeking Regis — against White
I louse orders — decides to take mat
ters into his own hands. All of the lit
tie quirks of Regis and Chance's
characters play a role in their long
search for the murderer.
Smartly used in this highly realis
tic movie are stylistic camera angles,
intelligent political jargon and
sounds of pervading rain. The result
of this foray into the secrets and lies
of Washington is satisfactory. I can
not emphasize how tough it is, in my
opinion, to make an original action
movie, and "Murder at 1600" more
than fulfilled my expectations.
