# 8 Heads in a Duffle Bag
## 
### 
If the death of comedy signals the
downfall of civilization, Armaged
don is near. "8 Heads in a Duffle
Bag" is just as bad as its title suggests.
With a plot that hardly holds togeth
er, completely unlikeable characters,
no-name actors doing nondescript
acting, a poor musical score that
doesn't correspond to the action in
the film and no beautiful people to
watch, there is absolutely no reason
to waste your hard-earned $7.50 plus
gas to go stare at a large screen.
Here's the basic plot: Tommy
Spinelli (Joe Pesci) is a mob guy on
the verge of retiring. Before he moves
to the next stage of life he has one last
job to do: bring a bag of severed
heads by plane to his boss in San
I )iego as proof of a completed trans
action. His plane is booked solid,
and all of the stowage areas are com
pletely packed, but Spinelli tries his
damnedest to make sure that his bag
o' heads remains with him during his
(light by moving around the luggage
of other passengers.
lust before the plane takes off, a
hospital worker carrying live human
organs to be transplanted in a bright
orange bag hops on the plane, and
decides that he needs to use the over
head baggage space that Spinelli
worked so hard for. Spinelli finds his
bag relegated to being checked under
the plane. Someone else on the plane

has a bag identical to Spinelli's, so
when Spinelli arrives in San Diego
and sneaks off with what he thinks is
a bag of heads, he is sorely mistaken.
Here is where the "comedy" starts.
David Spade makes the movie
with his characteristic strain of "I'm
smarter than you" humor, and Pesci
has his moments, but not even these
two could excuse a film filled with
blatantly stereotypical characters,
poorly timed over-the-top humor
(try laughing at alcoholism — it's
pretty hard), and a storyline that
even suspension of disbelief can't
help (as if someone carrying live or
gans for an imminent transplant
would ride in the coach section ot an
airplane!). There are too many de
capitated head jokes. The movie
manages to parody blind people,
Mexicans, women over and under
the age of 40, college students, envi
ronmentalists and airport security,
but not one of these categories gets
parodied well.
It's a movie ofgood intentions and
poor delivery. I had a hard time be
lieving that Tom Schulman, who
wrote the screenplay for "Dead
Poet's Society," was depressed
enough to create this painful excur
sion into humorland.
My advice to you: Wait for video.
Better yet, wait for beta.
