# Video Column
## Lions, puppies and Frenchmen 
### 
Probably the best-looking new
video out this month is "The (■ host
anil the Darkness," .1 true story
about two lions that kill more than
100 people who are building a rail
road bridge in Alrica. The scenery
and music are stunningly beautiful,

and I lus movie does an excellent job
of transporting the viewer back in
time. Michael Douglas and Yal
Kilmer play the hunters of the lions,
but the supporting cast turns in bet
ter performances. I lie story is slow
paced, but the lac t that il is based 011
true events makes it intriguing to
watch. I bis mov ie will probably be
most enjoved In those who like to
gather around the camplire to listen

to stories about amazing I'eats in faraway
lands.
I his month, a good suspense stor\ can
be louiul in " I lie Kkli Man's Wile. I«>sie
(Halle Merry) casually tells a strangei 111 a
har that she sometimes wishes her husband
were dead. Shot, kingly, her husband is bru
tall\ murdered a lew weeks later, and the
man from the bai shows up .it her house.

I le tells her that there's nothing she can do
against him because he could easily con
vince the police that she paid him to com
111 it the murder. As she seeks help from her
friends, losie slowly learns that there is no
one she can trust — she has to face her
enemy 011 her own. I ike in"The Usual Sus

pects,"
a nice
pIo t -
twist is

dished out at the end.
One of the best new video releases this
month is the Trench comedy " I lie Visi
tors." (lodefroy, a 12th century knight, and
Ins servant, |aci]uouille, are accidentally
transported to modern-day Trance by a
c ra/\ magician. Until they find shelter with
(iodefroy s descendants, the duo has to
deal with 20th century realities like cars,
hotels and even plumbing. A good deal of
comedy conies from the fact that (iode
froy 's descendants think they have found
their mentally ill nephew, who was lost in
the rainforests of Bra/il. The most comical
situations, though, are a result of the dif
ference 111 class between (lodefroy and
lacuouille. To his great displeasure, (lode
froy s castle has been turned into a resort
by his servant's pompous descendant. This
film was such .1 hit that both a French se-

quel and an American remake are already
in the works.
Two other comedies out this month are
"Emma" and "101 Dalmatians." fane
Austen's "Emma," the story of a young
woman meddling in other people's love
lives and finally falling in love herself, is
quietly enjoyable. The comedy in this film

is light, but it is definitely present in the
supporting characters. Disney's live-action
"101 Dalmatians" is like "Home Alone"
with 99 puppies instead of one kid. The ad
vantage is that you will feel more inclined
to root for the puppies than you were for
the spoiled kid.

You wouldnl find this picture of Michael Douglas (I) and Val Kilmer (r) so funny if you were a lion.
