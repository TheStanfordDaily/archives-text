Them: "So you're a DJ at KZSU, huh? That
must be cool."
Me: "Yep, I enjoy it a lot."
Them: A) So what's KZSU's frequency again?
B) You know, every time I tuned in to KZSU
you guys were playing really strange music so 1
stopped listening.
C) So why don't you guys play stuff that
most students like to listen to — you know,
more like Live 105?
I'm not saying these are the only respons
es I get in this situation. In fact, I find many
people who are supportive of KZSU and even
listen to it on a somewhat regular basis.
On the other hand, I do talk to many peo
ple whose comments about the station fall
into the above categories. The criticism that I
think lies behind many of these comments is

the feeling that because KZSU is Stanford's
radio station, it should be directed at and
serve students, which they feel isn't the case.
While I agree with the belief that KZSU, as
the University's radio station, should be de
signed with the aim of serving students, 1
don't accept the claim that KZSU isn't doing
this now. But, you might say, KZSU obvious
ly isn't playing music students like — Joe Stu
dent listens to KOME, KM EL, KSJO but not
KZSU — and KZSU should try to be more
like those other stations so students will listen
to it.
Well, there's no reason for KZSU to try to
sound like those stations.
First of all, we don't have nearly as much
money, equipment or staff members, and we
would merely be a poor imitation. More im
portant, those stations already exist and are

filling their particular niches.
Instead of attempting to occupy a previ
ously filled niche, KZSU aims to create its
own, providing an outlet for independent
music and programming of all kinds.
Although KZSU doesn't sound like the
stations Joe Student favors, it doesn't neces
sarily follow that KZSU doesn't play music
students like. I would argue that while many
DJs at KZSU play artists Joe may not recog
nize, we do play music that he likes — in
cluding classical, blues, jazz, folk, punk,
country, hip-hop and on and on.
(In fact, many artists featured on those
"other" radio stations were played on KZSU
several years ago. 1 lell, Green Day played live
in our studio back when it was a struggling
punk band before MTV picked it up.)
In addition to serving the entire campus,

KZSU, just like any other student organiza
tion, is particularly directed at serving those
students who join. KZSU allows any student
on campus to learn about the many aspects of
non-commercial radio, including producing
and airing news reports and public affairs
talk shows, independently DJing a three
hour music show and doing play-by-play or
color commentary for any of five different
Stanford sports. The things I've learned
through my involvement with KZSU for the
last four years have been an invaluable part of
my Stanford experience.
So if you haven't tuned in to KZSU yet, or
if you did a few years ago but didn't recognize
any of the artists, give us a chance.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Our frequency is
90.1 I'M.
