# Students sponsor a day of service in EPA

Members of the Stanford community will
join residents in beautifying East Palo Alto
neighborhoods on Saturday for Building Com
munity Day, a one-day service project begun by
students in the Law School and Graduate
School of Business last year.
Last year, Stanford students planted flow
ers and trees, painted and put in a sand volley
ball court at Bell Street Park.
Building Community Day drew more than
100 students from Stanford last year. Organiz
ers hope for an even larger turnout this year
and have encouraged all members of the Stan
ford community, including staff and faculty, to
participate in the event.
This year, volunteers will meet in Bell Street
Park and spread throughout the town to work
with East Palo Alto's block organizations â€”
groups formed by residents to deal with issues
in their neighborhoods.
"As successful as Building Community Day
was last year in refurbishing Bell Street Park,

the one complaint I heard was that there was not
enough interaction with East Palo Alto resi
dents," said Suzanne McKechnie, a law student.
"This year, we are pairing up with the al
ready-active block clubs and will be working in
smaller groups on specifically what the resi
dents want," she added.
"We think it will be a good day because we're
doing it with the residents and they had it or
ganized," said law student Noah Sachs.
The day begins at 8:30 a.m. when partici
pants gather for breakfast and receive free T
shirts.
After some introductions, volunteers will
break off into groups to work with the block or
ganizations. The day will end with music and
refreshments in the park.
"Students in the Law School and Business
School felt the need to provide students with a
one-time volunteer opportunity," said law and
business student Roy Vella, who took part in
street projects that allowed people the opportu
nity to participate without making a long-term
commitment.

Law student Clara Shin took part in Ameri
corps and wanted to help students get more in
volved with the service effort.
"We had the goals of providing the opportu
nity for direct service and strengthening the
community with East Palo Alto and between
the various schools, which seem so departmen
talized," Shin said.
The Public Interest Law Students Associa
tion, the Public Management Program and the
Haas Center for Public Service played a major
role in starting the program. However, stu
dents in the undergraduate, graduate and pro
fessional schools all contributed in planning
the event.
Four subcommittees have been working on
various aspects of the project for two months.
In addition to the Law School, Business School
and the School of Education, a number of law
firms in the area are sponsoring the event.
Home Depot donated gardening tools and sup
plies, and various food merchants will provide
breakfast, lunch and refreshments for partici
pants.
