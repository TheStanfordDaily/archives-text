# Elementary school students get health advice
## Stanford volunteers teach Redwood City fifth-graders about science and risk behavior 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
About 50 fifth-graders spent
the day at the University yester
day exploring dormitories, playing
on soccer fields and even ventur
ing into computer clusters. Their
field trip was organized by the
Stanford Health Corps, a student
volunteer group focused on health
education.
The organization's goal is to
teach pre-adolescent students
about biology, risk behavior and
sex education. Currently, volun
teers teach a different science-re
lated topic each week at Taft Ele
mentary in Redwood City.
Topics include human anato
my, nutrition, exercise, sleep,
smoking, drugs, alcohol and sexu
ally transmitted diseases.
Tien-wen Wiedmann founded
the Stanford Health Corps when
she was a professor at the School
of Medicine six years ago.
She emphasized that the course
doesn't just tell students about the
consequences of sex and risky be
havior; it also vividly shows them
the negative effects these actions
have on the body.
By using the University's re

sources, the Stanford Health
Corps can supplement its lessons
with demonstrations and experi
ments. Students studied the lung
specimens of a smoker and non
smoker under a microscope to bet
ter understand the effects of
smoking. Other activities have in
cluded dissecting a lamb's heart
and examining a dog with nar
colepsy — a sleeping disorder that
also occurs in humans.
"The hands-on activities are
not only fun for the students but
also have a powerful impact on
the their memory," Wiedmann
said.
Prevention is the most impor
tant factor of the program, said
Ruth Snyder, a teacher at Taft.
The elementary school students
"need this information to make ed
ucated decisions," she said. Some
students will still make harmful
choices, but at least they'll know
what they are getting into."
The volunteers can reach the
students in a way that teachers
cannot. In an environment of
gangs, drug abuse and violence,
the students often don't realize
that there are other options, Sny
der said.
"The Stanford students serve

as role models," she added. "The
kids are fascinated with the real
life of the college students. Sud
denly college is not some far away
thing."
College did not seem far away at
all to some of the 112 fth-graders who
were sitting around the Claw yes
terday morning talking about
what they wanted to do when they
grew up.
"I want to come to Stanford and
study computer science," Vince
Mozie said.
Abre Aguilar expressed similar
sentiments, saying he wanted to
become a professional video-game
tester.
Elementary school students
can also ask volunteers questions
they may be too embarrassed to
ask a teacher in a formal class
room setting, said Stanford
Health Corps co-leader Vivian
Chou.
The volunteers often split the
class into small groups according
to gender especially for this pur
pose, she added.
Wiedmann began the Stanford
Health Corps in 1991 when she
saw the social problems in the
area and recognized the tremen
dous capital and human resources

that the University had to offer.
She recruited two medical stu
dents, Louise Walter and Bernice
Man, to research and prepare a
curriculum for the project. This
eventually grew into a service or
ganization involving 45 under
graduates.
Currently, the Stanford volun
teers spend fall quarter planning
and revising the curriculum for
the following two quarters, which
are spent primarily in the class
room.
"Once the material is ready, we
can rapidly expand the program to
other public schools and to other
age groups as well," Wiedmann
said. "We just need more student
volunteers who can use their per
sonal imagination to get the mes
sage across."
Next year, the Stanford Health
Corps plans to expand its program
to Hoover Elementary School, also
in Redwood City. The organiza
tion is not restricted to premedical
or undergraduate students, but it
especially needs volunteers who
speak Spanish.
