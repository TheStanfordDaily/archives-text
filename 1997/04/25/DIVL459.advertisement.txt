In addition to our Graphic Designer/Illustrator and Software
Designer/Developer positions, these are available:
Web Designer: (10 Immediate openmgs) for talented web designers to
use our new Web tool. Our Java-based product allows designers
tremendous power and flexibility, but also caters to novices so it is easy
to use. Designers will be designing actual sites, a great opportunity to
fine tune their skills at our expense. Designers will help us hone the
product, as well as find bugs. Hourly compensation DOE, and may
extend to full time employment.
Activity Writers: (5 Full time/summer internships) One component of
KartoffelSoft's Virtual Village project is guided, theme-based computer
learning. Users are led through a series of steps, collectively called an
Activity, which helps them achieve some specific ends. Examples of
Activities might be common tasks such as "Doing Your Taxes" or
"Creating a Christmas Card" or more outlandish things like "Doctoring
a Family Photo" or "Writing a Ransom Note." In general, the most
creative path is used to take the user through a useful sequence of
steps, and the tone of the Activity is always creative and fun. Activities
are written instructions augmented by a variety of multimedia support,
such as pictures, Screen Cam and sound. Applicants must have
excellent written and verbal communication skills, an aptitude for
teaching, and software experience. A bit of programming experience
would serve very well here. This position is a great way for competent
non-techies to get in the door of an exciting technical company.
