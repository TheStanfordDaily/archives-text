### Erika Check Contributing writer 
About 100 people gathered last nigbt outside the
Palo Alto City Hall to protest the city's recently
passed sit-lie ordinance, which went into effect yes
terday.
The protest started at 7 p.m. in front of City 1 lull,
where members of the Palo Alto community spoke
against the ordinance. The protest then moved to
University Avenue, where Palo Alto citizens and
Stanford students sat on the sidewalk in opposition
to the ban, which prohibits sitting or lying on Uni
versity Avenue during business hours.
The crowd cheered as speakers criticized t he law.
Danny Dayc, who works for Urban Ministry,
called the ordinance a "pointless poison of our spirit
of community."
Other speakers included Faith Bell, the owner of
Bell's Books on Emerson Street; I'aul Gilbert, the di
rector of the local ACLU chapter; Aggie Robinson, a
former school board member; Trina Lovereheck, a
former member of the Palo Alto City Council's
Human Relations Commission; and Dick Roe, an in

terfaith minister.
Protesters carried candles in paper cups and hand
made signs with messages like "Sit / lie is offensive,"
and "There are better solutions." Some chanted slo
gans like "People on your feet, sit on the street" and
"Shame on Palo Alto." Protesters reconvened in Tyt
ton Plaza after the sitting.
Most protesters said t hey oppose the ordinance he
cause they feel the Palo Alto City Council has been
dishonest about the actual intent of the law. While
members of the council maintain that the ordinance
addresses an issue of public safety, protesters believe
that the law is a thinly veiled attempt to remove
homeless people from the streets of Palo Alto.
The protest was organized by a group of Palo Alto
citizens who met three weeks ago because they were
upset by the passage of the sit-lie law last month. The
group includes Stanford faculty members Ellen
Christensen, administrator in the Anthropology De
partment, and Tom Wasow, dean of research and as
sociate dean of graduate policy. Wasow said he re
garded (he sit-lie law as a "symbolic measure."

From left to right: Freshman Cliff Chen, sophomore Lisa Chen, Palo Alto homeless advocate Cary-An
drew Crittenden, freshman Sarah Reidenbach and junior Lenita Ellis protest the new sit-lie ordinance in
downtown Palo Alto last night on University Avenue.
"It is a symbolic way of saying
to a certain constituency, 'We're
tough.' They've had their symbol
ic statement. We regard this
protest as our answer," said
Wasow.
Protesters last night echoed
Wasow's hope that the demon

stration would send a signal to the
community and to the City Coun
cil.
David "Cadillac" Wormley,
who serves on the executive board
of representatives for the Board of
Urban Ministries, said he was at
tending the rally as a patriot who
wanted to make the council
"aware that they're doing the
wrong thing."
Wormley, who is homeless, also
stressed the need for people to

work together to oppose the ban.
Palo Alto citizen Andy Pierce
took part in the demonstration by
sitting outside Walgreen's.
Pierce, also a member of the City
Council's Human Relations Com
mission, said he thought the
protest expressed the opinion of a
majority of people in Palo Alto
who "do not want the community
to be divided up into two groups of
people — acceptable and unac
ceptable."
