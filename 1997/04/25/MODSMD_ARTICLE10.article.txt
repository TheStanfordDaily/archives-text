Fairness was top priority of Elections Commission

Throughout the last few
days, the Elections Commission
has been the target of a number of
accusations of incompetence. I would
like to address some of these claims.
First, there has been a great deal of
distress voiced in letters to the editor
and articles / columns about the per
ceived lack of value placed on student
votes. There has been a great deal of
misquoting and manipulation of words
that has led to this perception.
Enabling the voice of the students to be
heard is our primary objective in orga
nizing an election. Increasing participa
tion in the election was the sole motiva
tion for a greatly increased number of
paper ballot sites and an extensive pub
licity campaign. In fact, voter turnout
for undergraduates this year was a
remarkable 58 percent, a huge increase
from previous years. Our sole purpose
is to make sure that the voters have
enough information and a reasonable

opportunity to make an informed vote.
No vote is without value.
The Daily has accused the Elections
Commission of "general ignorance of the
ASSU Constitution" when dealing with
students from Oxford. In actuality,
every decision made by the Elections
Commission has been in accordance
with the constitution and the ASSU
Bylaws. According to Article 1V.8.G.2,
any request for an absentee ballot must
be submitted to the commission two
working days before the start of the elec
tion. I was not contacted by anyone until
about 4 p.m. on Monday — hardly two
working days before the opening of polls.
I realize that not very many students
are aware of the particulars of the
ASSU Constitution. In my quest to
accommodate as many students as pos
sible, I told the representative of that
group that I would try to find a way for
them to vote on Friday. I never made
any promises to any Oxford students.

Once the Elections Commission had a
formal meeting, it was decided that
there was no way for the students at
Oxford to cast a vote on the Friday fol
lowing the election for two reasons:
First, the polls would have been open
for three days in Oxford, clearly violat
ing the constitutional mandate that the
election be held on two consecutive days.
Second, the preliminary results had
been released. Allowing Oxford stu
dents to vote on Friday would therefore
have violated Article 1V.9.D.1, which
does not allow votes to be cast after any
tally has been released.
At this point we were faced with the
two options: trying to fulfill a vague
promise or upholding the constitution.
As a commission of the ASSU, we are
bound to the constitution and bylaws.
There was no way that the Oxford stu
dents could have been allowed to vote
without violating the constitution and
subsequently invalidating the entire

election process. A very difficult yet nec
essary decision was made.
This whole unfortunate web is a
direct result of my attempt to accom
modate as many voters as possible. As
one senator pointed out at Tuesday
night's ASSU Senate meeting, if I had
just said, "No" — which would have
been perfectly constitutional — this
would not be an issue.
The Elections Commission stands
behind all decisions made throughout
the course of the election. We have acted
in accordance with the constitution and
have conducted the election in a com
pletely nonpartisan manner. All results
are completely valid.
If anyone has any further questions
or concerns about the manner in which
this election was run, I urge you to
speak to me directly.
