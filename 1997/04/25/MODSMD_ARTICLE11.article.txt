# ASSU's insignificance is established again by election blunders
## 
### 
Like countless others, I have been
watching the aftermath of the ASSU elec

tions with exasperation. It's been a week
since 4,000 students put enough faith in
the ASSU to vote, and Emily Andrus is
still not officially president. Wednesday, I
read that we'll have to wait another week
until the presidency is confirmed.
Apparently, even after the election
has been deemed valid by the ASSU
Senate, some individuals with an

extraordinary amount of free time on
their hands are launching a crusade to
show that some candidates misstated
copying costs. It is precisely this pen
chant for the trivial that has earned
the ASSU its reputation for insignifi
cance. If these shenanigans can occur
after an election where the victor got
nearlv twice as many votes as the clos

est runner-up, imagine what might
happen next year if the race is vaguely
close. I urge all other Stanford stu
dents to stand up to the overzealous
politicians and join me in demanding
that the senate stand behind the 4,000
Stanford students who voted.
