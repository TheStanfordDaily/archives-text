## Poking fun at ourselves 
### 
WHEN MY YOUNGEST brother
was 5 years old, he was somewhat
fascinated with the word "penis."
He would attempt to engage the stern
woman in line ahead of us at the super
market in casual conversation about it. He
would make imaginative rhymes fusing it
with the name of the pizza delivery kid
who would smile uncomfortably, grab the
tip and inch away. He would put it to
music. He would make up jokes about it.
He found it to be really very interesting.
And he got one hell of a reaction.
One day, after an especially prolonged
outburst of enthusiasm, I took it upon
myself to explain to him the physiological
significance and otherwise relative unim
portance of said biological feature. I
esteem the 5-year-old intellect, especially
of a 5-year-old as precocious as my tiny
kinsman. Most kids don't get the guts to
yell "penis" until eighth grade.
"Look," I said, " 'penis' is not a bad
word or a funny word or a naughty word.
It's just a regular old word." I looked
around me for a simple illustration of my
point. I needed a noun, and I reached for
the first one I could get my hands on.
"Airplane," I said. "See, the word 'penis'
is just like the word 'airplane.' " He
looked over to where I was pointing. He
looked back at me and then back up at
the sky. I gave him a minute to fully
absorb the content of the conversation.
Finally, he turned around once more.
"Yes," he said, and I gave myself a

mental pat on the back for breaking his
cute little habit. "Yes," he continued, "if
you cut the wings off of an airplane, it
looks just like a penis."
No doubt, the fruitlessness of this con
versation resulted from the skewed
socialization process undergone by every
child in the Wiener family. My last name
has two synonyms: hot dog and the other
one. Both were the scourge of my ele
mentary school career. In third grade,
my classmate Greg Mocelin surpassed
Shakespeare and Shel Silverstein with
"Neener, neener, neener, you are a
Wiener." I attempted to ward off taunts
by starting false rumors that Oscar
Meyer was my grandfather, but it was
not until seventh grade that the certified
existence of my great uncle Harry
allowed me to inch myself up a notch
above the bottom of the popularity totem
pole. In 11th grade, I discovered that my
first name was a good gerund to describe
my last name. Jocelyn Anne became
Jostling A, and my presence took on an
entirely different connotation.
I know the logical solution to silencing
my brother's phallic outbursts would
have been to Crazy Glue his lips shut.
But after spending an entire childhood
trying to convince torturous peers that
my last name wasn't really that funny, I
felt some sort of moral obligation to be
objective for my young protege. Mine has
been a lifelong battle to destigmatize the
reproductive vocabulary of our sexually

repressed society. It has been a lifelong
battle to preserve the integrity of my
family name which was slapped onto my
great grandparents' immigration docu
ments in place of "Pevavov." And it is
just a word. It is just a name.
But society has yet to catch on. We're
still repressed. So, ridding one child of the
tendency to candidly converse about the
subject at hand won't make him lose his
interest. It will just create in him the ten
dency to make fun of sweet, innocent little
boys and men who go by Dick instead of
Richard. As long as this fascinated unease
remains firmly entrenched, we might as
well direct it in a more useful manner.
Big business, boring education,
detached policy-makers — our society is
already replete with real repression. A
phallic conception of life is naturally
ridiculous. But it could be the perfect
response. Giant winged wieners soar
overhead. Joe Camel's head begins to
look strangely familiar. Shakespeare gets
slapped with an NC-17. And we see what
it's done to the image of Hoover Tower. If
we must remain stigmatized, let's at least
use our own repression to create bad
puns and uncomfortable situations.

Jocelyn Weincr, a sophomore majoirng in
urban studies, would like to apologize to
TWA, Shakespeare and the city of Vienna.
