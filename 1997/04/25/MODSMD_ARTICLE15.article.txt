Housing for disabled
students is a major
Stanford commitment

I am writing in response to the April
11 Daily article on disability access
issues, both to correct some inaccuracies
and to provide information on current
and planned accommodations in housing
for students with disabilities, as part of
our long-range Housing Access Plan,
which has been in effect for more than
three years.
In 1993, a committee of Stanford
housing administrators and students was
convened by Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and chaired by
Housing Assignment Services, which
developed a comprehensive plan for sig
nificantly improving access to student
residences. In the past five years, we
have renovated 24 separate residences to
make them accessible for living as

defined by the Americans with Disabili
ties Act. That is in addition to the 11
houses that were already living accessi
ble, bringing the total to 35 living-acces
sible undergraduate houses.
Additionally, many graduate apart
ments have been renovated to be fully
accessible to students who use
wheelchairs for living on the first floor.
This means that parking spaces, build
ing entries, student rooms, bathrooms,
computer clusters, laundries, dining
rooms, study spaces and lounges are all
wheelchair accessible. In co-ops, it also
means that kitchens are accessible. Most
of these houses have also been upgraded
to respond to the concerns of sight- and
hearing-impaired students, as well.
In addition, 46 of our undergraduate
residences have been made accessible for
visitors who use wheelchairs. That
means that building entries, lounges,
dining rooms and at least one guest
bathroom are accessible to wheelchairs.
While a few additional residences have
older ramps and other accommodations,

they are not included in the preceding
counts because they do not meet our
current definition of "accessible"; how
ever, they could be deemed "informally
accessible" at the present time.
Ground-floor wheelchair access and
other improvements for a wide range of
disabilities in virtually all undergraduate
residences and in a significant number
of graduate student spaces, considered
phase one of the plan approved in early
1994, will be achieved by the end of the
12-year Housing Capital Improvement
Program, now in its fifth year. Currently
three undergraduate and seven existing
graduate residences, plus two new grad
uate residences to open in fall 1997, all
have elevators. Vertical accessibility in
even more residences across housing was
established as phase two of the plan, to
be achieved with the next wave of fund
ing after first-floor accessibility is
achieved in the next few years.
Since the first year of the CIP, we have
spent about $3.5 million on accessibility
related renovations, and the projected

budget for the balance of the program's
accessibility work is more than $4 million.
In addition, we spend approximately
$40,000 annually on additional "tailoring"
of accommodations to meet individual stu
dents' specific needs. For example, a bath
room that is fully compliant wit h building
codes derived from the Americans with
Disabilities Act may not, in fact, meet a
particular student's needs — in that case,
we will make the needed modifications.
Student Housing Services' managers
work closely and collegially with the
Disability Resource Center and the Uni
versity compliance officer from the
Office of Multicultural Development to
ensure that students with all kinds of
disabilities — mobility, hearing, vision,
severe allergies, psychiatric, etc. — are
able to live safely and comfortably in
student housing and participate fully in
residence life at Stanford.
As has been pointed out, the Stanford
campus, including its older residences,
was designed a century ago, with little or
no awareness of the needs of students

with disabilities. As much as we would
like to transform these older structures
overnight, we do not have the resources
to do so as rapidly as we would all like,
but we do have a formal plan (since
1994) in Housing and Dining Services
that is guiding us toward our goals for
accessibility, and progress is steady. I am
pleased with how much we have been
able to achieve in student housing in just
the past few years, and I look forward to
implementing our full-scale plan over the
next few years of the CIP. From conver
sations with colleagues at other universi
ties, 1 believe we are in the vanguard in
the effort to accommodate students with
disabilities in our residential facilities.
Our managers and staff in Student
Housing Services remain committed to
achieving the goals described above with
all possible speed and quality and wel
come inquiries from any interested Stan
ford community member.
