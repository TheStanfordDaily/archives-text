# Bravman named to Bing Centennial professorship

### Ben Freda Staff writer 
John Bravman, professor of materials science and
engineering, has been named to the Bing Centennial
Professorship, one of the University's highest honors
for teaching.
In a letter to Bravman, Provost Condoleezza Rice
wrote that the professorship was granted on the
unanimous recommendation of the deans of the
Schools of Humanities and Sciences, Earth Science,
and Engineering. This was"in recognition of your ex
traordinary record of teaching excellence, your com
mitment to undergraduates and your dedication to
making Stanford the best education institution it can
be."
Bravman said he thought the professorship was
granted to him because he has put so much effort into
his teaching both in and out of the classroom.
"I've worked very hard at being an effective and un
derstanding teacher," he said. "However, I personally
consider that I have a lot to learn about teaching. As
far as standing up and talking is concerned, I think I'm
above average but not great."
Much of Bravman's acclaim comes from his ex
haustive preparation for class.
"His handouts really are better than the textbook,"
said junior Wendelin Wright, a materials science
major. "He's always making new handouts and slides,
even for classes that he has taught for years."
Arriving on campus every day before 5 a.m., Brav
man admits to spending long hours on computer

drawings, handouts and lecture materials.
"I've had to realize that different students learn in
different ways," Bravman said. "I've also tried to make
it a little interesting, not just for the students but for
me as well."
"Bravman is a terrific example of the blend of inter
ests that all professors would like to be," said Franklin
Orr, dean of the School of Earth Sciences. "But it was
his undergraduate teaching performance that was the
real reason for his selection."
Orr pointed out that Bravman has been able to bal
ance service to the school — he is the head of the Ma
terials Science and Engineering Department and a se
nior associate dean of the School of Engineering —
with his efforts in undergraduate teaching.
"It says a lot about him that he would take the
time to put so much effort into undergraduate
teaching, even with all his other positions," Wright
said.
The three-year professorship, established in Stan
ford's centennial year of 1991, began with a $5 million
endowment from Helen and Peter Bing. It offers an
annual stipend of $ 15,000. In addition, the professor's
department receives $10,000 per year.
Bravman will have control of all the funds because
he is chair of his department. However, he has no clear
plan for the use of the funds at this time.
"One idea is to use the money to get Engineering 50
and Engineering 60 on tape," Bravman said. "That
way, we could make those classes available overseas,
making it possible for more engineering students to go
overseas."
