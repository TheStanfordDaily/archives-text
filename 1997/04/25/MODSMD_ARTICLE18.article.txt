## Spikers in MPSF final Cougars lose, men advance 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
When it comes down to the end of the season and
teams are vying for league and national titles, a
team s ability to win under any circumstances
becomes critical. Teams that are able to do whatev
er is needed to win, regardless of whether it is what
they are accustomed to, are the teams that win
titles. In last night's match against Brigham Young
in the semifinal round of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament, the Stanford men's
volleyball team showed that it could do just that.
In gaining a three-game victory, 16-14,16-14,17-
15, against the Cougars, the second-seeded Cardinal
(24-3, 18-3 MPSF) played a style of volleyball unfa
miliar to most who have watched Stanford play this
season. The Cardinal will face UCIA tomorrow
night in the MPSF Championship for an automatic
bid to the Final Four.
Although there were a number of huge kills and
big serves from the likes of senior outside hitters
Mike Lambert and Matt Fuerbringer, as well as
freshman outside hitter Andy Witt, offensive lire
works did not win the day for Stanford. Lambert,
Fuerbringer and Witt had 25, 23. and 17 kills,
respectively, but only Fuerbringer, who hit .452,
was above his season average. Rather, it was a sti
fling defense, something that Stanford is not known
for, that won the day.
"It was a defensive battle," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We outblocked and outdug BYU, a
very good defensive team. We didn't have a veiy
good match offensively, but we slowed them down
more than they slowed us down."
Senior Mike Hoefer and junior Keenan White
hurst, both middle blockers, deserve much of the
credit for the defense that held the Cougars (20-6,
15-6 MPSF) in check throughout the match. Hoefer
had 13 block assists with only one error. While
Whitehurst's stats were not as impressive, his pres
ence in the middle was no less imposing.
