## Spikers in MPSF final Cougars lose, men advance 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
When it comes down to the end of the season and
teams are vying for league and national titles, a
team s ability to win under any circumstances
becomes critical. Teams that are able to do whatev
er is needed to win, regardless of whether it is what
they are accustomed to, are the teams that win
titles. In last night's match against Brigham Young
in the semifinal round of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament, the Stanford men's
volleyball team showed that it could do just that.
In gaining a three-game victory, 16-14,16-14,17-
15, against the Cougars, the second-seeded Cardinal
(24-3, 18-3 MPSF) played a style of volleyball unfa
miliar to most who have watched Stanford play this
season. The Cardinal will face UCIA tomorrow
night in the MPSF Championship for an automatic
bid to the Final Four.
Although there were a number of huge kills and
big serves from the likes of senior outside hitters
Mike Lambert and Matt Fuerbringer, as well as
freshman outside hitter Andy Witt, offensive lire
works did not win the day for Stanford. Lambert,
Fuerbringer and Witt had 25, 23. and 17 kills,
respectively, but only Fuerbringer, who hit .452,
was above his season average. Rather, it was a sti
fling defense, something that Stanford is not known
for, that won the day.
"It was a defensive battle," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We outblocked and outdug BYU, a
very good defensive team. We didn't have a veiy
good match offensively, but we slowed them down
more than they slowed us down."
Senior Mike Hoefer and junior Keenan White
hurst, both middle blockers, deserve much of the
credit for the defense that held the Cougars (20-6,
15-6 MPSF) in check throughout the match. Hoefer
had 13 block assists with only one error. While
Whitehurst's stats were not as impressive, his pres
ence in the middle was no less imposing.
BYU was never able to get
beyond the Stanford defense, as it
hit a paltry .196 as a team for the
match. More significant, Stanford
held senior outside hitter Ryan
Millar, the MPSF player of the
year, to .157 hitting, a very poor
performance for him.
"Hoefer and Whitehurst did a
great job," Nieves said. "They real
ly slowed down Millar. Even
though he led them with 20 kills
he only hit .157."
Stanford needed all the
defense that it could muster, as it
had to battle back from deficits as
big as 10-5 in the second game
and faced a 14-13 deficit in both
games one and three. In both
games one and three, Stanford
sided out seven consecutive times
with the Cougars serving for the
game.
"I think that the story of the
match was mental toughness at
the end of each game," Nieves
said. "Even though Lambert

didn't have a great hitting night,
he came up big at the end of all
three games, as did Andy Witt,
who got the kill on game point in
games one and three and served
an ace on game point in game
two."
While outstanding defense
mixed in with some strong offense
was enough to get by the scrappy
Cougars, Stanford will have to
have every facet of its attack going
in the finals of the MPSF tourna
ment tomorrow. The Cardinal will
square off against the host Bruins
of UCLA, winners last night over
UC-Santa Barbara in easy fash
ion, 15-7,15-11, 15-6.
For Stanford, this may be a
preview of what is to come in the
Final Four, as most people
believe that both of the teams in
tomorrow's game have already
qualified for the right to go to
Columbus, Ohio, to play for the
national title. For the Bruins (23-
3, 19-2 MPSF), ranked first in
the country, trips to the NCAA
title game have become habit.
The Bruins have won 16 crowns
since 1970, including the last two
in a row, and heading into their

50th meeting against the Cardi
nal boast a record of 45-4.
UCLA plays a style very similar
to Stanford's. The Bruins are
huge. They average taller than 6-
foot-7 as a starting six. The Bru
ins, who have won 21 of 22 match
es coming into tomorrow's match,
are led by four players. Senior
Paul Nihipali, a 6-7 outside hitter,
is one of the leading candidates for
player of the year with more than
2,000 career kills. He is comple
mented in the middle by junior
middle blocker Tom Stillwell, who
stands 6-8, and freshman middle
blocker Adam Naeve, looming a
monstrous 6-10. Setting these
three guns up will be freshman
setter Brandon Talliaferro, stand
ing a diminutive 6-5.
"UCLA is a really big, strong,
physical team," Nieves said. "The
match is for the automatic bid, but
most people do feel that both of us
are already in; that doesn't change
anything. There is a lot on the line
â€” a league championship and,
more importantly, next time the
two of us play, a lot more will prob
ably be on the line, most likely a
national title."
