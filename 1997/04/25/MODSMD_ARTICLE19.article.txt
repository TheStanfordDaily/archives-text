# Football readies for spring showdown

At this time last April, Stanford freshman
quarterback Todd Husak was in his final
semester at Southern California's St. John Bosco
High School, four months away from his first
undergraduate steps on the Farm.
Fast forward a year and suddenly Husak —
who came into his freshman year no better than
a third-stringer — has the spotlight all to himself
heading into tomorrow's Cardinal and White
Game, Stanford's annual intrasquad scrimmage
that is the culmination of three weeks of spring
drills. The game gets underway at 11:30 a.m. at
Stanford Stadium.
"I really couldn't have imagined myself last
year at this point right now," Husak said. "I
couldn't have asked for anything more, how
everything worked out. It's been pretty exciting."
Husak has been piloting the Stanford offense
all spring in the absence of starter Chad Hutchin
son, who has been preoccupied with his duties as
a starting pitcher for the No. 5-ranked Stanford
baseball team. Hutchinson has sat in on meetings
this spring but taken no part in drills.
That's cleared the way for Husak, who started
fall practice third on the depth chart behind
Hutchinson and senior Tim Carey. But Carey
transferred to Hawaii when Hutchinson was
named the starter, and Husak ended up playing
in four games, completing 19-of-39 passes for 202
yards and a touchdown.
"It's been a really good chance for me," Husak
said. "I've improved personally a lot since last
year."
Spring practice allows coaches to take a close
look at players who will be competing for starting
jobs in the fall. The biggest question marks for
the Cardinal this season are on the offensive line
and at the nose tackle, tight end and safety posi
tions.
With sophomore Andrew Currie sidelined with
minor knee surgery, nose tackle has been a two
way competition between freshman Willie
Howard, who redshirted this year, and junior
Anthony Willis. It's even more crowded at tight
end, where freshmen Steve Coughlin and Russell
Stewart and juniors Tommy Hanson and Derek
Hubbard are all battling for time. They will be
hard-pressed to fill the shoes of Greg Clark, who
