## SEAS stages Arco protest for Burma 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
Members of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford
staged a protest yesterday at the
Arco garage at 1963 El Camino
Real in hopes of combating corpo
rate involvement in Burma.
About a dozen SEAS members
stood outside the Arco garage,
protesting the company's invest
ments in Burma, in addition to
giving leaflets and letters to the
station manager and pamphlets to
customers.
Sophomore Jill Shenker, a co
coordinator of SEAS, said, "Arco
is involved in Burma with Unocal
and Texaco to build a natural gas
pipeline through Burma into

Thailand. All the money would go
to SLORC, a totally military dicta
torship.
"Basically, slave labor builds
the pipeline, and it also destroys
forestation. There are incredible
human rights violations,"
Shenker said.
SEAS staged the protest in con
junction with Three Days for
Burma, a national event spon
sored by the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers International
and the Free Burma Coalition.
The purpose of the event, held
April 22 to 24, was to speed the
restoration of democracy in
Burma.
"Hopefully, the managers will

send the letters and pamphlets we
give them to their corporate of
fices," said Sage Van Wing, the
other co-coordinator of SEAS.
"Last year, we went and hiked
around to all the local Texacos and
Arcos and gave similar forms,
mostly letting the corporations
know there-is public outcry
against what they're doing.
"We strongly believe in the
link between respect for the envi
ronment and the people, that you
can't have one without the
other," Van Wing elaborated.
"We're always looking to create
coalitions, and it's also really im

pressive that [Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers International]
have taken up the issue. It all has
to do with consumers. We hope to
educate more people so that hope
fully they won't buy gas from
companies like Arco," she added.
Steve Sullivan, an internation
al representative of Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Internation
al, worked with SEAS to orches
trate the protest.
"We were involved in trying to
go ahead to get some of our union
members on the Peninsula" to go
to the protest, he said.
Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers International, though a
small union at about 90,000 mem
bers, has always been involved in
social causes.
"We can't ignore the issues of

human rights," Sullivan said. "We
recognize that we have a responsi
bility in the companies we work
for."
In addition to the protest,
SEAS recently held a teach-in at
Kimball Hall, where members
gave information about the cur
rent situation in Burma.
"We are certainly willing to do
other presentations" to educate
people, said Van Wing.
SEAS also supports the Califor
nia State Legislature's efforts to
pass AB 888, a bill that would ban
state contracts with companies
that do business in Burma. The
bill would follow in the footsteps of
the federal bill President Clinton
just signed last week banning new
investments by American compa
nies in Burma.
