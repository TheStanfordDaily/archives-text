## 
### Courtney Mann Jeremy Stone Senior staff writers 
The Stanford women's tennis team has
some serious defense to play this weekend at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships in
Ojai, Calif.
In the past three seasons, two of the three
Pac-10 singles champions have come from
the Cardinal lineup, and both of those play
ers, senior Sandra De Silva and junior Julie
Scott, are back in the draw again this season.
Last season as a sophomore, Scott, Stan
ford's No. 6 singles player, pulled off a series
of upsets to steal the Pac-10 title. Three
years ago, as a freshman, De Silva did the

same. De Silva was also in the bottom half of
the Cardinal's lineup.
Also representing the Cardinal is fresh
man Lilia Osterloh. Perhaps the hottest play
er in the conference, Osterloh has gone unde
feated at the No. 1 spot in seven straight con
ference wins as Stanford finished off its third
straight undefeated Pac-10 season.
While senior Katie Schlukebir rested for
the weekend, junior Ania Bleszynski battled
injuries and competed. Both are expected to
be strong for the NCAA Championship next
month at Stanford.
The Cardinal faced some not-so-familiar
faces in the first round of action, but had lit
tle trouble regardless. Defending champ
Scott jumped all over Washington's Zeta

Wagner in her opener with a straight-set
win, 6-1, 6-1.
Osterloh took care of Oregon's Ali Napier
in straight sets 6-0, 6-3. De Silva took care of
her business in straight sets as well, beating
Andrea Reisz from Washington State 6-3, 6-
4. Bleszynski battled by Arizona State's Katy
Propstra 6-2, 6-7, 7-6.
But in the second round, the Cardinal sur
vivor list was cut in half as De Silva and
Bleszynski were eliminated. Bleszynski gave
top-seeded Vicky Maes of Arizona a scare,
but Maes pulled out a 6-0, 3-6, 6-1 win.
UCljA's Katia Roubanova went three sets to
top De Silva 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Scott continued to pursue a
repeat title against UCLA junior
Kellv Rudolph, the Bruins' No. 4
competitor. Rudolph lost for the
second time in as many weeks to
a Stanford player, 6-3, 0-4, set
ting the stage for Scott's battle
with Arizona State's top player,
Reka Cseresnyea, at 9:HO a.m.
today.
Osterloh met Cal freshman
' lane Curran, who had lost
twice tu Stanford in three sets in
previou matches. The Bears'
No. 1 player was no match for
t he Cardinal rookie, who breezed

to a 0-3, 0-1 win. Next up for
Osterloh is Arizona State's
Stephanie Lansdorp.
In the invitational portion of
the tournament, Stanford did
not fare quite as well. Of four
Cardinal players competing, only
freshman Tervn Ashley rolled
unscathed through the first day.
The undefeated Ashley
bngeled UCLA's Shana (Jray 0-0,
(5-0 before crushing Washing
ton's Jenny Svanfeldt 0-1, 0-1.
She will take on Arizona's
Monique Allegre today.
Freshman Jennifer Ileiser
breezed through USC's Stacy
Smith 0-1, 0-2 but fell in the sec
ond round to Arizona's Hot ay
Miringhoff 0-3, 0-3. Juniors
Heidi St alia and Sophy Wood

house did not get by the first
round. Stalin fell to Washing
ton's Peggy VVu 6-4, 6-4, and
