### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team will look to take a first
step toward the national cham
pionship this weekend in the
Western Regional Qualifier at
Berkeley.
"I expect in the next two tour
naments to he in the champi
onship game," said head coach
Ben Quittner.
Stanford will need to he one of
the top seven of 11 teams in the
tournament in order to advance
to the national championship. All
the teams in this weekend's qual
ifier are from the West, including
top-ranked UCLA.
The Cardinal begins first
round play today at 11:30 a.m.
against UC-Santa Barbara. The
squad will then face a weak team
it has not seen all season, Oregon,
later that afternoon. The Card
will finish off opening-round play
bright and early tomorrow at 7:30
a.m. against (JSC.
Stanford has yet to lose to any
of these teams all season and
should advance fairly unscathed
into the second round. It is there
that competition will stiffen as
the Cardinal will more than likely
face host California, with which
Stanford has been trading games
all season, in Spieker Aquatics
Complex.
If Stanford advances out of
this semifinal game tomorrow at

4:30 p.m., it will be in the finals
Sunday at 1 p.m., facing in all
probability either UCLA or No. 4
San Diego State. The Card has
yet to beat the Bruins and lost to
San Diego State just two weeks
ago after beating the A/tecs all
season.
The Cardinal is coming off a 7-
2 victory last weekend against
UC-Davis. Stanford played solidly
against the Aggies, when senior
co-captain Alice Cathcart and
freshman Suze Gardner had two
goals apiece to spark the Stanford
squad.
"We wanted to have a good
game and play confidently to get
ready for next weekend, and we
did that," said sophomore co-cap
tain Lindsay Tam.
Stanford has been relying all
year on the trio of Gardner, Cath
cart and freshman Ellen Estes to
lead the team offensively. One key
difference in the Card at this
point in the season is its ability to
call on other players besides this
triple-edged sword. Stanford has
been getting quality minutes out
of sophomores Nicole Glazer and
Tam.
"I think we have been playing
well," Quittner said. "We are
looking forward to this weekend
and to nationals."
The Cardinal's main goal this
weekend is simply to advance to
the championships. Stanford can

ensure that it will move on by
winning its bracket and should
gain confidence from a strong
showing this weekend.
"The players are ready to
play," Quittner said. "They are
pulling together and know what
they need to do to win."
