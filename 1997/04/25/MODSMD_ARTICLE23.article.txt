The Curdinal men's golf
team has waited all year for a
tournament like the U.S. Inter
collegiate held at Stanford Golf
Course today and tomorrow.
Sitting on the brink of its goal
to play in the upcoming NCAA
Regionals and entering into
competition with several
regional rivals, the Cardinal
golfers will need all the fan sup
port Stanford can spare to cheer
them on in this showdown.
"I feel our team's got a lot
of momentum right now," said
junior Jake Poe. "We're in
control of our destiny; this is

squad will have its hands full

Washington State, Oregon, Ore
gon State, California, UCLA,
USC, Arizona State, San Fran
cisco, Nevada, Idaho, San Jose
State, UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-Irvine all in attendance,
there will be no shortage of
regional rivals.
"We just have to protect our
position," Poe said. "But many
of the other regional teams real
ly need to do well, and we also
have to be aware of that."
Because only the top 12
teams in District 8 will travel to
the regionals and because the
U.S. Intercollegiate will be the
last determinant of standings for
the Pacific 10 Conference, this
tournament promises to be espe
cially competitive and intense.
"Right now, we're ranked
about 11th — right on the bub
ble — although we'd really have
to fall on our face not to make it
to regionals now," said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "Our
qualifying rounds are as good as
they've ever been, even with
