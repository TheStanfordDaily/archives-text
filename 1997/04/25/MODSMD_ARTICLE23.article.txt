# Golf hosts U.S. Intercollegiate
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Staff writer 
The Curdinal men's golf
team has waited all year for a
tournament like the U.S. Inter
collegiate held at Stanford Golf
Course today and tomorrow.
Sitting on the brink of its goal
to play in the upcoming NCAA
Regionals and entering into
competition with several
regional rivals, the Cardinal
golfers will need all the fan sup
port Stanford can spare to cheer
them on in this showdown.
"I feel our team's got a lot
of momentum right now," said
junior Jake Poe. "We're in
control of our destiny; this is
our tournament. And once
you're into regionals, any
thing's possible."
Accompanying Poe in the
tournament are sophomore Joel
Kribel, senior Conrad Ray,
freshman Dusty Brett, sopho
more Scott Wang and senior
Pete Ligotti. Playing as indepen
dents will lx; freshman Michael
Weimer, Poe, senior Eri Cnim
and freshman Tylar Lunke.
Despite recent successes for
the team at Pasa Tiempo and

the Cougar Classic in Utah, the
squad will have its hands full
this weekend. With Washington,
Washington State, Oregon, Ore
gon State, California, UCLA,
USC, Arizona State, San Fran
cisco, Nevada, Idaho, San Jose
State, UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-Irvine all in attendance,
there will be no shortage of
regional rivals.
"We just have to protect our
position," Poe said. "But many
of the other regional teams real
ly need to do well, and we also
have to be aware of that."
Because only the top 12
teams in District 8 will travel to
the regionals and because the
U.S. Intercollegiate will be the
last determinant of standings for
the Pacific 10 Conference, this
tournament promises to be espe
cially competitive and intense.
"Right now, we're ranked
about 11th — right on the bub
ble — although we'd really have
to fall on our face not to make it
to regionals now," said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "Our
qualifying rounds are as good as
they've ever been, even with
only one All-American this year
Joel Kribel.
"Our rhythm the.se last couple
weeks has been good. The last
tournament wo played in at BYIJ
was the best tournament of' the;
year for the team."
Brett said the team has tried
recently to improve its game when
shots approach the pin.
"We've focused mostly on our
short game the hist few weeks
pitching, chipping, putting — our
long game is secondary," Brett
said. "It's a matter of being able to
capitalize when you hit a good shot

with, say, ;i birdie pud, and saving
yourself and scrambling lor par
when you hit a bad shot."
Itegardless ol" one's short game,
there will be no easy pars on the
6,786-yard, par-71 Stanford Coif
Course. The pin placements will be
difficult for putting, the fairways
are fast, the greens are mowed
down to a sjjeed of about 9.5 (mod
erate to semi-fast), and the long
rough will favor the golfer who hits
the fairway.
"Coach always spices up the pin
placements to favor the better
players — we'll see who that is, I
guess," Wang said.
Although the Cardinal will have
a distinct knowledge of its home
course, this awareness is not
always helpful. "It's a first-look for

a lot of player ;, I nil we're alino: I ;il
a disadvantage bcean: <> wr come in
with expectat ions when I be course
is laid out differenlly than we're
used to," I.igotti said "Still, I'm
not gonna be surprised il we win
this thing."
The golfers will have to j;ive
their home course the respect, it
deserves and also hope for the
home-team support they deserve.
The tournament will consist of .'l6
holes of compel ition today mid IH
holes tomorrow. The weather
should be nice (about HO decrees
on Saturday), the Stanford (Joll
('onrse is on a beautiful and rarely
seen side of Campus, the men's golf
team only plays at Stanlbrd twice a
year, and tournaments t his impor
tant and excit inj; are rare.
