# Baseball travels to Berkeley this weekend
## Cal looking to knock Cardinal from top 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
For the Stanford baseball team,
today's 2:.'{() p.m. game at Evans
Diamond against California is the
first game: of the rest of its life.
Mired in tlie classic late-season
tight division race, No. 5 Stanford
(30-13, 14-7 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) is tied for the
top spot in the Six-Pac with UCLA
(35-11-1, 14-7). Three crucial
weekends remain.
"We have to at least match
IJCLA until we go down there in
the last weekend of the season,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"It would also be nice to begin to
pull away a little bit in the stand
ings."
It's a safe bet that any losses to
the Colden Bears this weekend
would put huge roadblocks in the
Cardinal's way and give UCLA,
which faces streaky USC this
weekend, the potential to take over
sole possession of first. The teams
will travel back to Sunken Dia
mond tomorrow at 1 p.m. and close
the series in Berkeley the same
time Sunday.
The last-place Bears (17-31, 3-
21) slipped further south in the
standings this week after being
swept at Arizona State last week
end and losing to San Jose State in
a nonconference game Tuesday
night. Four straight losses have
put them 12 1/2 games behind
Stanford and UCLA in the division
rankings, and they have already
clinched last place.

Despite the Bears' ineptitude,
sophomore second baseman Brian
Oliver has been able to salvage a
respectable season find might pose
a threat against Cardinal pitchers.
Leading the team in almost every
offensive category, Oliver added to
his totals in Tuesday's loss to the
Spartans with four hits in five at
bats.
But Oliver — despite his .371
batting average and .517 slugging
percentage — hasn't been able to
spark the rest of the team. lie is
one of only three Cal starters bat
ting better than .300.
At Stanford, on the other hand,
every starter is batting at least
.316.
Despite the Cardinal's offensive
prowess, its performance last Sun
day against UCLA raised some red
flags when the team was only able
to squeeze out three runs and
seven hits, all singles. But Stanford
put those concerns to rest in Tues
day's game against Sacramento
State, exploding for nine runs and
hitting two home runs.
Sophomore center fielder Jody
(Jerut, who hit a two-run homer in
the fourth inning, said the game let
the Cardinal work out all itskinks
:il I lie plate.
"It felt good to get back into the
groove," he said. "Hitting is conta
gious."
Stanford junior hurler Kyle
I'eterson (7-2, 3.76) will start Fri
day's game opposite Cal pitcher
Drew Fischer (3-5, 5.46). Last
weekend against UCLA, Peterson
notched his 300 th career strikeout

en route to a 7-4 victory against the
Bruins, holding them to four runs
and five hits over 7 1/3 innings.
Peterson's six strikeouts that
day gave him 305 for his Stanford
career. He trails all-time leader
Jack McDowell by 32 with three
starts left in the regular season.

Stanford sophomore Brent
Hoard (7-3, 4.98) will face Jon
Shirley (2-6, 4.97) in tomorrow's
game at Sunken Diamond. Then
the teams will travel back to Berke
ley so sophomore Chad Hutchin
son (3-3, 6.42) can face Brad Steele
(2-4, 6.55) Sunday.
