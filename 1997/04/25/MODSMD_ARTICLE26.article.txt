# Softball gets set for must-wins at home

The soflball team starts off a 12-game home
stand this weekend when Stanford competes
against Santa Clara, St. Mary's and top-ranked
Arizona. The Cardinal (20-22-1, 5-I.'} Pacific 10
Conference) is looking to continue season-long
progress and find more consistency at the plate
on a game-by-garne basis.
The team faces the Broncos today atp.m.,
hoping to post two wins in strong fashion and
set the tone for the rest of the weekend. Stan
ford will battle the Gaels tomorrow and Wild
cats Sunday, both at I p.m. Santa Clara and St .
Mary's are perhaps two of the weaker teams
the Cardinal will play this season, but don't

expect Stanford to let up.
"At this level you have to take each game
individually and go from there," said head
coach John Eittman. "My job as a coach is to
get the emotion going for each game the team
plays."
Stanford played very well in its previous
encounters with the Gaels, winning both games
handily, 7-1 and 8-0. Blevins recorded a no-hit
ler- in the team's shutout victory and is looking
to have more strong performances this week
end.
Stanford's only conference games this week
end are Sunday against perennial power Ari
zona (44-4, 1(5-1). Earlier in the season Stan
lord fell to the Wildcats, but expect the games
to be closer this time around. The Card has

plenty of tough games under its belt, having
survived two-thirds of a tremendously difficult
schedule, and the team wants to play the best,
especially at home.
"If you're gunning to be the at the top you
have to play the best," Rittman said.
The Wildcats feature player of the year can
didate and two-time defending Pac-10 player of
the week Alison Johnsen in center field.
Johnsen leads the conference in average, hits,
runs and stolen bases. Leah Braats-Cochrane
has belted 15 homers and 56 RBIs to pace the
Pac-10, and Lety Pineda shares the long-trip
per lead with her in addition to splitting the
catcher and designated player duties with her.
While Arizona has the best aver
age (.385) in the conference by 40
points, the Wildcats get it done in
the circle as well. Nancy Evans (25-
1) paces the staff with a 77-5 career
record, and she just saw her ERA
climb over 1 as she leads the Pac-10.
But the pitching staff of Stan
ford has been strong all year long
as well, posting a 2.67 ERA. The
Card's usual rotation of sopho
mores Becky Blevins and Marcy
Crouch has been made even

stronger with the recent utiliza
tion of junior Jessica Schulman,
giving the team a very capable
pitching staff.
The team's early-season hitting
woes have become much more
infrequent as the season has pro
gressed, with strong performances
coming from sophomore shortstop
Michelle Schneider, sophomore
outfielder Michelle Acosta, senior
third baseman Amanda Renteria
and Crouch.
"We're a young team, and the
biggest thing for us to do this year
is to end strong," Rittman said.
"Right now we're gaining a lot of
valuable experience."

If the team finishes strong,
winning its six nonconference
games and going at least .500 in
the remaining conference games,
then postseason play is a realistic
possibility. One of the toughest
problems the Cardinal have to
overcome is not the other teams,
but the inconsistency which has
hindered Stanford this season.
"Achieving consistency is just
part of the maturing process,"
Rittman said. "The team has
given a lot of effort, and I am
extremely pleased with the way
things have gone and the
improvement that we've made
this season."
