"The team's chances are very
good in all events," said fresh
man Chris I lales.
Each of the eight players will
compete in t wo of the three tour

women's side, the teams are Lily
('hen and freshman Katie Mal
oney, and Keznek and senior
Olivia Wang. There are two
mixed doubles teams. Wong and
Maloney will play together, as
will Lo and Wang.
Each person will play a total
of four t<• five matches a day dur
ing the two day tournament.
The average time of each match
is about .'HI minutes, Hales said.
However, he has played matches
that lasted 90 minutes, as well as
some that were over within 10
minutes.

The Stanford team placed sec
ond in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Badminton League.
There are nine other schools in the
league, including Sacramento
State, California, DC-Davis and
San Jose State.
This time, the Cardinal will
only he missing sophomore co
captain Jeff Ho, who is sidelined
by knee problems. Other players
arc beset by injuries as well,
including Reznek, who has shin
splints, and Lily Chen, who has
shoulder problems.
The team sports some very
impressive players. Maloney and
Hales are both junior national
champions. Hales is hoping to
compete in the 2000 or 2004
Olympics. Lily Chen appeared in
Sports Illustrated for Ikm- bad
minton accomplishments.
While only eight players will
be traveling to the tournament,
the team is actually much larger.
Although its size varies from
quarter to quarter, there are as
many as IH) team members.
The squad meets two to four
times a week for three-hour
practices. During these prac
tices, team members do 00-90
minutes of drill and (50-90 min
utes of game and game like situ -
ations.
Head coach Hill Pickthorn lias
been challenged by the fact that
there are many levels of players
on the team. Some have never
touched a racket before, while
some are Olympic hopefuls.
Despite such difficulties, (he
team has had little trouble meet
ing the needs of all its players,
Reznek said.
"He's very insightful, and
knows the game very well,"
Hales said.
Reznek and others on her
team grew up playing badminton
in clubs. Reznek's brother
played, and both of Hales' par

ents played. In fact, both his
mother and father were national
champions in the 19705. Last
year, Hales trained at the
Olympic Training Center in Col
orado Springs.
Hales thinks that the tough
est competition he will face this
weekend might be from his
father, sort of. His father trains
a player in Ohio, Sharik Ajiji,
who will also be competing at
nationals.
