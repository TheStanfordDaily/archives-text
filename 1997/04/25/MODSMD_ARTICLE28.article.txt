# Montgomery talks hoops at Kimball
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Stanford men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery dis
cussed the past, present and
future of his team at an informal
meeting in the Kimball Hall
main lounge last night.
Before coming to the Farm,
Montgomery spent 10 years at
Montana. In his 11-year tenure
here, Montgomery has turned
the program from relative
obscurity into a national power.
"When we came first came
here, the consensus was that
you couldn't win at Stanford,"
Montgomery said. "But the
opportunity to come to Stanford
came along, and it was like a
dream come true. I thought
working hard could do any
thing."
Montgomery's efforts paid off
right away. He finished his first
season with a winning record
and followed that with an
appearance in the postseason
NIT the next year. His third
year was even more successful,
with the team making its first
NCAA tournament appearance
in more than 40 years.
"That raised a lot of expecta
tions for this community, the
students and this University,"
Montgomery said. "We had
nothing to sell 11 years ago. I
would go off on academics, and
people would look at me and say,
'OK, Coach, you made your
point an hour and a half ago.' "
The team gradually improved
over the years after former
coach Tom Davis departed for
lowa. It made five postseason
appearances in Montgomery's
first seven years, including two
in the NCAA tournament.
Then the acquisition of one
player helped Montgomery
change the face of Stanford bas
ketball forever.
In the 1992-93 season, the
squad lost most of its players to
graduation, and Montgomery
was actively pursuing a point
guard to help lead the team.
"We were really hurting for a

point guard," Montgomery said.
"It was a good year for [high
school] point guards on the East
Coast.
Current senior Brevin
Knight "was 5-feet-8-inches,
140 pounds," Montgomery said.
"We had seen him play and we
liked him. And of course he went
to Seton Hall Prep. He had good
coursework and grades, and his
parents were interested in him
having a good education, so we
had a selling point there."
In taking Knight, Mont
gomery stole a prospect that no
one else saw as much potential
in. The only other school heavily
recruiting Knight was Manhat
tan.
Knight quickly became the
crux of the Stanford offense. His
dribbling skills and ability to cre
ate offense quickly made him a
respected opponent and have
helped bring Stanford into
prominence, gearing a near
upset of top-seeded Mas
sachusetts in the second round
of the 1996 NCAA tournament.
This year, Knight led the
team past senior Naismith
Award-winning center Tim
Duncan and Wake Forest and
into its first Sweet 16. The team
just came up short of the Elite
Eight in an overtime loss to
Utah.
"Brevin was fun to watch,"
Montgomery said. "At times he
was stubborn and emotional,
and we had some interesting
times, but he could do things
nobody I've ever seen do with a
basketball on the court."
Now Knight is preparing for
the NBA draft. Montgomery
said the Denver Nuggets have
contacted Knight and showed
interest in inviting him to prac
tice for the team. Another
rumor has the Boston Celtics
taking Duncan with their poten
tial No. 1 overall pick and then
selecting Knight with their sec
ond first-round pick, which
could be as high as No. 6.
With Knight graduating,
Montgomery is gearing to change
the style of Stanford's play. With
the recruitment of twins Jjiron and
Jason Collins from Harvard-West
lake and point guard Mike McDon
ald from Long Beach Poly High,
Montgomery is ready to institute a
much more aggressive game.
"Next year we have a better
team top to bottom, one to 13, then
we've ever had. We'll have more of
an inside game," Montgomery said.
"We'll move | junior forward Petel
Sauer to the three position. That
might slow us down, and I don't
know if he'll be able to keep up with
some of the quicker guys there."
The Collinses, who measure (5-
foot-10 and 6-foot-11, will help the
team establish a much stronger
force in the paint, something Stan
ford has had trouble maintaining,
especially with sophomore center
Tim Young's chronic back injuries.
Hut the worries at tin? point posi
tion remain.
Sophomore Arthur Lee is
"doing well, but he just doesn't
have the same natural knack that
Brevin had," Montgomery said.
"We knew that when we got in
trouble we could just get it to
Brevin and he'd do something with
it. He was a great solution to a lot
of problems.
"We're going to have to estab

lish a press-breaker, which is
something we haven't had to do in
three years."
The team's rise to prominence
in the national eye is also resulting
in national television coverage and
tougher matches, something very
attractive to prospective recruits.
With the televised successes
against California and UCIA (the
worst loss in Bruins history) at
Maples Pavilion, students nation
wide could see not only the level of
talent but also the enthusiasm of
the student body.
'To have recruits see the atmo
sphere for the Cal game was what
we need," Montgomery said. "The
same with the UCLA game. To be
on national TV and then beat them
by 48 points was great; that hel|x*l
us with trying to recruit national
ly. We're getting great feedback."
After what many consider a
weak preconf'erence schedule this
year, the team will face many
prominent opponents at the start
of next year.
Stanford will participate in a
Thanksgiving weekend tourna
ment along with Oklahoma, New
Mexico and Wisconsin. The Cardi
nal will receive national coverage
on CBS when it takes on (Jeorgia
in the John Wooden Classic in the
Anaheim Pond and when it. travels
to take on Connecticut. Stanford
will also have a home-and-home
against the Utes.
Along with the rise of the team
comes a rise in interest for Mont

gomery as a coach. I le had receivod
several offers from other schools
before deciding to remain on the
Farm.
"I benefit from having Stanford
on my resume," lie explained. "I
have a reputation as being some
what clean. I've never had so much
as an NCAA inquiry.
"I looked at great interest with
Virginia because it's part of the
I Atlantic Coast Conference!, and
then? are a lot of prominent teams
there," Montgomery said.
He is also trying to draw more
student support, especially after
witnessing I he success of the Sixth
Man Club, which has exploded in
membership over the years.
Alt hough lie has no intention of
quickly instituting programs such
as Midnight Madness, a night time
rally for the students to see the
team on the first possible NCAA
approved day of prac( ice (()ct. 15),
Montgomery does want to hold
some type of festivities.
"Initially, the whole purpose;
was to got, an early start, on every
body else. Now it's just, gotten into
a marketing thing," Montgomery
said. "Actually, I'm afraid that it 'll
fall fiat on its face.
"I'm thinking about maybe a
Friday night promot ion with slain
dunk contests and 'I lot Shot' coin
petit ions. Maybe we can get some
people to donate stuff for that. At
some point, we'll have to take some
chances and try something like
that."
