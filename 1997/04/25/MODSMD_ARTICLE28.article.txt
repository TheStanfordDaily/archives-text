# Montgomery talks hoops at Kimball

### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Stanford men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery dis
cussed the past, present and
future of his team at an informal
meeting in the Kimball Hall
main lounge last night.
Before coming to the Farm,
Montgomery spent 10 years at
Montana. In his 11-year tenure
here, Montgomery has turned
the program from relative
obscurity into a national power.
"When we came first came
here, the consensus was that
you couldn't win at Stanford,"
Montgomery said. "But the
opportunity to come to Stanford
came along, and it was like a
dream come true. I thought
working hard could do any
thing."
Montgomery's efforts paid off
right away. He finished his first
season with a winning record
and followed that with an
appearance in the postseason
NIT the next year. His third
year was even more successful,
with the team making its first
NCAA tournament appearance
in more than 40 years.
"That raised a lot of expecta
tions for this community, the
students and this University,"
Montgomery said. "We had
nothing to sell 11 years ago. I
would go off on academics, and
people would look at me and say,
'OK, Coach, you made your
point an hour and a half ago.' "
The team gradually improved
over the years after former
coach Tom Davis departed for
lowa. It made five postseason
appearances in Montgomery's
first seven years, including two
in the NCAA tournament.
Then the acquisition of one
player helped Montgomery
change the face of Stanford bas
ketball forever.
In the 1992-93 season, the
squad lost most of its players to
graduation, and Montgomery
was actively pursuing a point
guard to help lead the team.
"We were really hurting for a

point guard," Montgomery said.
"It was a good year for [high
school] point guards on the East
Coast.
Current senior Brevin
Knight "was 5-feet-8-inches,
140 pounds," Montgomery said.
"We had seen him play and we
liked him. And of course he went
to Seton Hall Prep. He had good
coursework and grades, and his
parents were interested in him
having a good education, so we
had a selling point there."
In taking Knight, Mont
gomery stole a prospect that no
one else saw as much potential
in. The only other school heavily
recruiting Knight was Manhat
tan.
Knight quickly became the
crux of the Stanford offense. His
dribbling skills and ability to cre
ate offense quickly made him a
respected opponent and have
helped bring Stanford into
prominence, gearing a near
upset of top-seeded Mas
sachusetts in the second round
of the 1996 NCAA tournament.
This year, Knight led the
team past senior Naismith
Award-winning center Tim
Duncan and Wake Forest and
into its first Sweet 16. The team
just came up short of the Elite
Eight in an overtime loss to
Utah.
"Brevin was fun to watch,"
Montgomery said. "At times he
was stubborn and emotional,
and we had some interesting
times, but he could do things
nobody I've ever seen do with a
basketball on the court."
Now Knight is preparing for
the NBA draft. Montgomery
said the Denver Nuggets have
contacted Knight and showed
interest in inviting him to prac
tice for the team. Another
rumor has the Boston Celtics
taking Duncan with their poten
tial No. 1 overall pick and then
selecting Knight with their sec
ond first-round pick, which
could be as high as No. 6.
With Knight graduating,
