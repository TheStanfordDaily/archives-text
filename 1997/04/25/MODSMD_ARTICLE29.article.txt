### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
After an intimidating sweep by ()regon State
last weekend, the Cardinal squad is looking to
bounce back in tomorrow's showdown against
Sacramento State on the home waves of Red
wood Shores.
"We are feeling pretty positive and good after
a tough week of practice," said senior varsity
captain Matt Miller.
Miller sees this weekend as an opportunity
for his team to got together and build up confi
deuce after the loss against the Beavers.
"OSIJ was our lowest point of our season,
but we've made adjustments and improvements
for this weekend, and it will be a good step
toward building up the confidence and facing
|OSU| again at Pac-lOs," Miller said.
Head coach Wieslaw Kujda also believes the
race will be a good step for the varsity boat.
"The varsity will build confidence and go
really fast since Sac State is a fairly com
petitor," he said. "However, (he key is to |>er
i'orm the same or better despite the lack of pres
sure this weekend and thus carry that same
intensity and pressure over to the next race in
two weeks against Cal."
Like last weekend, the novice team has not
tapered for this weekend's race because it is

preparing for the conference championships.
"It is going to be tough to win since our boats
will be tired from this week's practice," said
novice coach Josh Burgel.
Uurgel's squad will have an exhausting
weekend ahead of it, heading down to Newport
Regatta the day following the race against the
I lornets.
The Newport Regatta will include San Diego
Crow Classic fourth-place finisher Orange
Coast College and Pacific 10 Conference rivals
I)('I iA and I JSC', plus UC-San Diego, UC-Irvine
and lIC-1 )avis.
Stanford "will be tired, but I think we should
win if everything goes right," Burgel said.
On the women's side, head coach Aimee
Baker has high hopes for her varsity and junior
varsity boats to |>erform well this weekend.
"They've been working really hard this
week, and they will be really tired in this week
end's face off against Sac State," Baker said.
"I lowever, Sac State should not be any problem
for the varsity and the.lV eight since we are sig
nificantly faster."
However, Baker sees this race as not just a
mark in the win column but a way to bring the
Cardinal oarswotnen's heads up after the loss
against the Beavers.
"This race will be good to bring the confi
dence back to our boats after the loss to OSU,"

she said.
Senior varsity captain Nancy Bergsteinsson
agrees with Baker's views of tomorrow's race.
"I think both the varsity and JV should win,"
Bergsteinsson said. "It will be a good race for us
after not exhibiting our full potential against
OSU and before facing Cal."
All Stanford boats should not have any prob
lems rowing through the I lornets this weekend
except for the novice women's squad. The Sac
State novice boat finished third in the invita
tional in San Diego a few weeks ago.
"Sac State will be a tough race since they are
only two seconds off Cal, and they never let up,"
Baker said. "However, I think |Stanford hasl
improved tremendously, and it would be inter
esting to see how close they can be."
After a hard and exhausting week of prac
tices, freshman Kerry Danahy also has big
hopes for her team.
"Sac State has a strong novice women's
boat, and we're ready for that," Danahy said.
"We're trying to work through that fatigue to
still row well so that later in the season when
we're tapered, we can make everything come
together."
The white and cardinal oars are hoping to
make a splash past Sac State tomorrow in
preparation for next weekend's Big Row against
California.
