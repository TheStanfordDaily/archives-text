Reiko Osaki and Becky Novotny, sopho
mores Michelle Tsuda and Emily Roley and
junior Mickayela Beatty danced their way
into the forefront of Stanford familiarity at
the 1997 Dollie Splash.
"It was even more amazing than I thought
it would be," Roley said. "My friends all made
signs, and my parents Hew in this morning
from Oregon."

As I lie band began to strike up a tune near
the 1 Lane History Corner, however, nerves
struck.
"All of a sudden, it sunk in," Roley said.
Osaki, who was trained by an ex-Laker
(lirl and whose dance background includes
jazz, hip-hop, funk and "a little modern,"
agreed.
"I was really nervous. ... I couldn't sleep
last night," Osaki said. "Weall have different
dance backgrounds, but we've never per
formed together."
Tsuda, who participated in jazz, ballet,
tap and cheerleading while growing up, had
family present and ready with the camera.
"They came all the way from Hawaii,"

Tsuda said
The new dollies have been training inten

break. They practiced up to three hours
every day for their nine dances on Thursday.
"We've worked pretty hard so far," Novot

exciting year."
Senior Claire Bacher, next year's band
manager and the official "dollie mama," ex
pressed enthusiasm about the new dollies.
"I I hink I his year's group is a great group.
I'm looking forward to working with them,"
Bacher said. "They've worked awfully hard
to do the . . . dances they did today, and it's
pretty amazing."
