The Stanford cycling team
will compete in its last regular
season races in Cupertino and
Morgan Hill this weekend.
Looking to improve its rank
ings and accumulate more sea

sonal points before the West
Coast Cycling Conference Cham
pionships next month, more
than 20 riders in seven cate
gories will participate in the race
hosted by San Jose State.
Each regular race acts as a
point-getter which puts top
ranked teams at an advantage
for the postseason. The Cardinal
currently ranks third place after
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
UC-Santa Barbara.
While new riders are expected
to show off their pack-handling
skills in the criterium race — an
event that requires sprinting
and out-of-corner tactics — Sun
day, more experienced riders will
lead the team in the hill-climb
time trial tomorrow. The hill
climb event, demanding long
term power output, generally
lasts around 20 minutes for men
and 30 minutes for women.
The Stanford men's A, B, C
and I) teams and women's A, B
and C teams will face cyclists
from more than 20 California
schools in both races.
"The team is looking to scor
ing a couple of wins," said junior
Mark Leibowitz. "If wo race well,
we'll have a chance to be compet
itive against the other teams."
Coach Art Walker said the
Cardinal is aiming to gain more
points with the hill-climb event
and prepare the younger mem
bers for (he postseason races in
the criterium.
"If we happen to improve our
standing, that will be good — but

that's not as important," Walker
said.
While the Card has succeeded
in attaining a "nice consolidated
base of points with conservative
tactics" necessary to start the
season, Walker said he hopes to
see the team take more risks this
weekend.
"It'll be nice to see the riders
gamble a little bit," Walker said.
"There are more points to be
gained by someone finding skills
they didn't know they had
before; it could open up new
opportunities for them."
Walker said experienced Car
dinal riders expected to "score
exceptionally well" in the hill
climb event include graduate
students l'ete Armitage and
Dario Falquier, who earlier in
season enjoyed a victory on the
Cupertino course.
Armitage, the team captain,
will also lead the Cardinal in the
criterium with graduate stu
dents Takeshi Doi and Russell
Mead.
While medical student captain
Cynthia Ferguson will represent
the card in the A team for both
events, first-year rider Marie
Kirk, a law student, is expected
to put a strong race for the
women's B team.
Walker also mentioned fresh
man Will Park, sophomore Chris
Ilooyman and graduate student
Mike Cummer as some of his
new riders expected to perform
well in the criterium.
