RIGHT NOW IT'S a bad time for me to talk because
I'm in the middle of a paternity suit. I'm trying to
prove to Calvin Klein that I'm his illegitimate
daughter, the product of a one-night sit-down
between him and a cactus flower in the bathroom of Studio
Calvin refuses to acknowledge me as his love-child, even
though 1 bear a striking resemblance to a lamp shade in his
master bedroom. II this doesn't work, I might sue him for
copyright infringement. The whole "Obsession" commercial
thingics with Kate Moss are nothing but imitations of some
home videos made bv my boyfriend of me at a bulimia retreat
camp last year.
Aside from that, there's my ongoing battle with The
Daily to prove that I'm mentally fit to be an editor here.
Turns out that some snotty little busybody faxed chief Eliza
beth copies of my criminal record, and now she thinks I'm
some sort of shoplifting, obscenity-yelling, red-light-running
follower of the Church of Macadamia Nuts. Well, I mean, all
of the above is true, but I was in a really foul mood that day,
having accidentally set fire to a 5-year-old on my way to
I Jenny's.
This job thing has become a personal battle for me. I
want to prove to all those navsavers out there that I'm not
just ;i cheap hooker with a fondness for underage boys and a
weakness for hard liquor. No, I'm a civic-minded person. I
once donated money to charity. Wait. Actually, now that I
think of it. I used the money instead to get myself some sushi
the other day. But it was really good sushi.
Hut anyway. I can be useful to society. When I'm not
working at The Daily, I'm busy doing public service as a sex
guidance counselor. Aimee knows she's the best person to
address quest ions of sexual etiquette, especially because she's
had every disease imaginable, from scabs to gonorrhea, and
had s«*x with hundreds of people, some of whom were not
even alive (or humant.

Anyway, this
girl Jen called in
one day to ask if
she should sur
render her vir
ginity to her
boyfriend, who's
been pressuring
her to do the
deed. Well Jen,
my advice is this:
Go ahead and do
it. but if I were in
your place, I
would charge a
lot. But why ;ill
this fuss about
losing one's vir-

Aimee on a rare moment of sobriety,
thinking about those fields of gold that
Wordsworth talked so much about.

ginitv? Sox is a bit like breaking the law. The first time you
do it. it's kinda scary, but once you get used to it, it just comes
naturally.
Finally. Aimee wants to talk about something serious.
Some people have been saying that Aimee is a bad influence
on the youth of today, considering all the binge-drinking and
cocaine-sniffing and what not. Aimee understands all that
and is willing to repent. Hut Aimee needs money for that.
Rehab these days cost a lot. especially if you're going some
where posh, like the Betty Kord. So 1 have started a fund; it's
called "Save the Aimee," and 1 have already diverted funds
from more than Hi different charity organizations and envi
ronmental agencies. Help me in my battle to save my body
(and maybe even my soul) by sending a check or money order
or even plastic to The Stanford Daily, attn: Aimee
Thanatogenos. Contributions in form of body parts or
obscene photography will be enjoyed but not returned.
