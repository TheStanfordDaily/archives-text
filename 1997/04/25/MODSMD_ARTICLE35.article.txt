FROMTHE "IF COMEDIANS
MINGLED WITH DICKENS" FILES:
Ok, let me tell you about my first guest.
Some of you may already know him. His
name is Oliver, and, gosh, he's so cute
(laughing). I'm sorry, I can't help myself. He
totally reminds me of Parker. Parker is my 2-
ycar old. Oliver Twist, that's his name. He's
the one who s.ivs (doing soft, small voice)
"Please sir, may I have some more?" Isn't
that cute. He's a cereal commercial waiting
to happen. Yes, you may, Oliver! Yes, you
may. Here you go. He's so sweet. Love va.
I ove va! He's gonna be iust like Tom Cruise
when he grows up. Yeah, when loin and I
are married, we'll adopt you, Oliver. And
then me, you and Penny will go to k mart
and get you one of those cute little sailor out
fits. Oh. but by then you'll be all grown-up.
Rut that's Ok, because K-mart has a great
junior men's collection. Yeah, you didn't
know that, did va ? Well you know now. And
did vou also know that "Oliver" is a musical?

Yeah. Oliver can sing! Who knew? But I
wasn't in it. I was in the other one, "Grease,"
with an exclamation mark. Had a lot of tun
in that show. (Sings:) "There are worse
things I could do, than go with a hoy or
two. Yeah, I've also done movies. Saw "The
Flintstones ? I was in it. But anvwav, let's
welcome Oliver to our show! (Oliver enters.)
Mou re you doing, Oliver? Boy, you look so
skinny. People will see you and me next to
