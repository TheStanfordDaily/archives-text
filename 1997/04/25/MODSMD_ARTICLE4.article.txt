# Music prof contests allegedly unfair firing
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
Grover Sales, a jazz history lecturer, is charg
ing an unfair firing attempt in an appeal to Dean
of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven
against the Music Department.
For some years, Sales has taught a winter
and-spring-quarter sequence, Music 18, which
surveyed several decades in the history ofjazz.
In June, Christopher Chafe, th<; Music De
partment chair, informed Sales his courses will
not be offered in the 1996-97 academic year din
to a reorganization of the music curriculum.
Chafe also noted concerns ahout Sales' handling
of certain student complaints.
After a meeting with Ombudsperson Ellen
Wax man, Chafe placed the decision to offer the
courses before the Music Department faculty,
which decided to continue offering the winter

course only. "I wiis fired without a hearing and
without ;i warning," said Sales, who filed a griev
ance against Chafe in February.
A March 24 report by Drama Department
Chair Charles Lyons, the appointed grievance
officer, largely supported Chafe's actions.
Lyons concluded that the procedures Chafe
"employed in notifying [Sales) that his appoint
ment would not be renewed for 1996-97 followed
University guidelines." I le also suggested strate
gies for avoiding misunderstanding in such situ
ations.
Sales described the decision by Lyons as a
"whitewash of the Music Department" reached
by "committee of one." He likcnÂ«*d the report's
conclusions to former President Gerald Ford's
pardon of Richard Nixon and decried the differ
ence between procedures used to remove acade
mic staff as opposed to tenured faculty.
In reviewing Sales' grievance, Lyons cau

tioned that "the part-ti .e lecturer category at
this University offers its incumbents no rights of
continuing employment beyond the time limits
of the appointment."
The primary reasoning behind declining to
reappoint Sales was programmatic, Lyons con
cluded. "The intention to reconfigure the jazz
curriculum, in consultation with the faculty,
constituted an appropriate and understandable
base fort hat decision," he wrote.
Sales called the reorganization reasoning
"spurious."
Noting that the new course offerings would
include a course on Duke Ellington, Sales
stressed that he had l>een personally acquainted
with the jazz legend, did publicity for him and at
tended his rehearsals and performances.
"I didn't get this out of a book," said Sales,
who is 77 years old, about his exper
(ise in jazz history. "I lived this."
"Neither Prof. Lyons nor Prof.
Chafe had ever heard me lecture,
;iii(l for eight years the vast majori
ty of student evaluations have
ciillod my course not only excellent
but 'unique' and 'inspirational'."
Sales indicated that more than
two dozen students have written
letters protesting his dismissal.
According to Lyons' report, a
student alleged that a comment
made by Sales in class has drawn
attent ion to her East Indian origin.

Lyons concluded that the refer
ences "to the student's ethnicity
were not malicious, that they did
not self-consciously use a racial
stereotype, but that they were un
fortunate, and, as it turned out, of
fensive to the student."
Responding that anybody who
knows him would consider an alle
gation of racism a "palpable absur
dity," Sales recalled that he men
tioned East Indian culture in the
context of a fable.
"This has carried political cor
rectness to bizarre extremes," he
said, "Members of the junior facul
ty cannot function with this Sword
of Damocles of PC hanging over
their heads."
Most jiizz musicians studied in

his course are African-American,
Sales noted, and material includes
socio-economic as well as music his
tory.
According to Sales, the other
student complaints dealt with his
grading policies. He has main
tained that students are evaluated
on basis that leaves "no doubt as to
who has done the work and who
has not."
Because the grievance process is
still under way, Chafe has declined
to comment on any issues sur
rounding the status of Sales.
Sales has also offered a number
of courses through the continuing
study program and is also the au
thor of a widely used textbook,
"Jazz: America's Classical Music."
