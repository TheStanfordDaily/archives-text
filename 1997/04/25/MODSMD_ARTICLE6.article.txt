Chemical weapons ban faces vote
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bidding to win ratifica
tion for a global chemical weapons treaty, President
Clinton offered assurances yesterday he would
withdraw from the pact if it inadvertently results in
the spread of banned weapons.
The treaty bans the development, production or
stockpiling of all chemical warfare agents and
requires destruction of existing stockpiles over the
next decade. It will take effect next week, whether
or not the United States ratifies it.
Clinton's assurances were designed to win the
support of wavering lawmakers who say the treaty
could inadvertently result in "'rogue states" such as
Iraq or Libya obtaining access to American technol
ogy through third countries.
The treaty, which was negotiated under former
Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, has already been ratified by 74 nations and
signed by more than 160.

S.F. garbage collectors strike
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — About 600 garbage
collectors walked off the job yesterday in San Fran
cisco's first garbage strike in 57 years.
According to Robert Morales, the union's secre
tary-treasurer, workers have been without a con
tract since Dec. 31. The union voted — 95 percent to
5 percent — to strike yesterday night.
Officials at Norcal Waste Systems, which oper
ates the two companies that pick up the city's
garbage, said they offered a boost in benefits and
wages.
But the main problem, according to Morales,
concerned pension improvements.
Morales said the job's demanding physical effort
resulted in "lots of injuries" to workers over 50
years old.
"Every mzyor hotel, medium hotel, hospital,
every school and home will be affected" by the
strike, Morales said.
