# McVeigh trial underway
## Prosecuter condemns 'act of terror' on trial's first day 
### 
DENVER (AP) â€” Timothy McVeigh blew up the
Oklahoma City federal building with a truck bomb
to unleash his hatred for the government and see
"blood flow on the streets of America," a prosecutor
said yesterday.
"In plain, simple language, it was an act of ter
ror," Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Hartzler told
jurors in his opening statement. "The man commit
ting this act is sitting in this courtroom behind me."
McVeigh, wearing a blue plaid shirt, showed little
reaction in court, sometimes leaning forward on his
elbows, then leaning back in his chair.
The 29-year-old Gulf War veteran could face the
death penalty if convicted of murder and conspiracy
in the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil: the April
19, 1995, blast that killed 168 people and injured
hundred more.
Hartzler said McVeigh selected April 19 "to
avenge deaths that occurred at Waco." It also is the
date the opening shot was fired in Concord and Lex

ington to begin the Revolutionary War.
"He envisioned he would bring liberty to this
nation," Hartzler said. "Well, this was not just talk
for McVeigh. He was ready for action. He knew from
literature how to make a bomb and how to get the
ingredients."
McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, was expected
to assert that the government's case was flawed
from the beginning, when investigators started col
lecting evidence the day of the bombing.
In Oklahoma City, an overcast sky seemed to sum
up the somber moods of about 150 bombing sur
vivors and relatives who took shuttle buses to the
Federal Aviation Administration headquarters to
watch a closed-circuit teli of the trial in a the
ater-style auditorium.
The anonymous panel of 12 jurors and six alter
nates, which will not be sequestered, was selected
Tuesday for a trial that could last four months or
more.
