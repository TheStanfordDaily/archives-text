Creation of Web site
is successful way to
rebel against rankings

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Gerhard Casper intro
duced a plan last week to
create a World Wide Web site pro
viding a central, objective pool of
University information for
prospective students and others.
The proposed Web site, Casper
explained, would represent a fair
way of presenting information
about colleges and universities,
unlike the annual rankings in U.S.
News & World Report that have
recently proved so controversial.
Since last fall, a student effort
headed by ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, called the Forget
U.S. News Coalition, has worked to
encourage universities around the
country, including Stanford, to
stop submitting data to U.S. News.
Starting a separate Web site was
an innovative and bold move on
Casper's part. An alternative to
U.S. News is something to which
students have shown a lasting
commitment. It's welcoming to see
administrators and students mov
ing in the same direction.
It's also welcoming to see Uni
versity administrators taking
definitive action rather than mere
ly passively refusing to submit
statistics to U.S. News. Through
out next year, University officials
plan to lobby other schools around
the nation to join Stanford in post
ing information on the Web site,
which would be run by Santa
Clara-based Yahoo!
Although the Forget U.S. News
Coalition initially called for the
University to withhold all statis
tics, Casper, after careful consider
ation, submitted the information
U.S. News requested — except for
the surveys that are used to create
the nebulous "academic reputa
tion" ranking.

This move may seem like a cop
out, but Casper's decision was a
good one. He submitted informa
tion necessary for Stanford to be
represented as fairly as possible
while at the same time taking a
stance against the part of the pro
cess to which so many people object.
Plans call for withholding all infor
mation next year if U.S. News does
not change its evaluation process.
As far as the new Web site is
concerned, while it's a wonderful
idea, it is one that ought to be
approached with a good deal of
caution. Because the Web is such
an informal source of information
and because it is so easy to post
information on the Web, some
kind of check needs to be placed on
the project.
The point of creating a new
source of information about col
leges and universities is to provide
a fair picture of individual schools,
a picture untainted by U.S. News
or any other group. It's important
then that in managing the Web
site, Stanford and Yahoo! finds
some mechanism for checking the
information submitted by individ
ual colleges and universities.
While we must assume that uni
versities are run by honest adminis
trators, we must also recognize that
universities engage in cut-throat
competition for the nation's best
students. An independent source
should be found to verify all the uni
versities' data before its posted.
Even U.S. News does cross checks
before publishing its information.
So as University officials work
to get this project off the ground
they should remember the pur
pose of the project: To provide sim
ple, clear and truthful informa
tion. It is the obligation of Univer
sity officials to make sure that
schools who join Stanford in this
crusade submit information with
the utmost integrity and honesty.
After all, a failure to maintain
the highest possible standards
would place the University on the
same level as, well, U.S. News &
World Report.
