# Fire breaks out in Mem Aud
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
A fire in Memorial Auditorium, possibly
involving the building's boiler system, closed
the building Friday. No injuries were report
ed.
The facility will remain vacant until the
fire's cause and the structural damage to the
building can be determined.
The two-alarm incident tripped warning
devices at 12:20 p.m., calling to the scene on
campus units of the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment and supporting officers from the Menlo
Park Fire Department.
The fire, which began in the basement of
the 60-year-old structure, was extinguished
by 4:30 p.m.

Safety concerns, however, disrupted
events scheduled for Stanford's largest-ca
pacity indoor theater.
The annual Bhangra by the Bay festival, a
celebration of East Indian culture and dance,
to take place in the facility on Saturday was
moved to Frost Amphitheater. Stanfor Stu
dent Enterprises Flicks' Sunday night pre
sentation of "Swingers" was relocated to
Cubberley Auditorium after adding a third
showing to accomadate demand in the
venue's smaller seating size.
Flicks Project Director Matt Garling
house, a junior, said that no plans had been
made to move the weekly second-run movie
showings beyond this week, and he hoped to
return to Memorial Auditorium by next Sun
day.

Palo Alto Police Sgt.Tim Hanrahari indi
cated that although the exact cause of the fire
had not been determined, the boiler system
was the focus of early speculation and that
arson was not suspected.
"Judging from the reports, it would indi
cate that this was an accident," Hanrahan
said.
Further investigation of the incident will
be handled by the Palo Alto fire marshal.
The facility will remain closed until in
vestigator's have ruled the building safe to
occupy, which could come as early as this
week.
Until that time, patrons of events sched
uled for Memorial Auditorium are encour
aged to contact event organizers or Stanford
Events, which manages the facility.
