Weenie faces Tree-beating charges
BERKELEY (AP) — A UC-Berkeley yell leader
faces disciplinary charges for allegedly orchestrat
ing an attack on the Tree.
Scott Landry is accused of yelling "Kill the
Tree!" after the Nov. 23 Big Game, which Stan
ford won 42-21.
Landry's shouts apparently prompted numer
ous Cal students to attack Stanford junior Chris
Cary, who was wearing the Tree costume.
Cary was kicked, punched and dragged but not
seriously hurt. The tree costume was ripped.
During a hearing Friday before a three-member
campus committee, student conduct manager
Doug Zuidema said Landry, as head yell leader, "lit
the fuse that gave hundreds of students license to
rush the field and attack a human being."
The campus committee, made up of two profes
sors and a student, was expected to make a deci
sion on the matter in 10 days.

Landry, 21, faces several student conduct vio
lations, ranging from disrupting a university
activity to damaging and destroying property. He
could be ordered to perform up to 30 hours of
community service and pay $300 — a quarter of
the Tree costume's value.
Earthquake aftershocks hit L.A.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Another late after
shock from the deadly 1994 Northridge earth
quake hit Southern California early yesterday
morning, a day after a wave of quakes hit the same
area. No injuries or serious damage were reported.
An earthquake expert called the unusual 24-
hour turnaround "mildly surprising."
The 4.9-magnitude quake yesterday was cen
tered about 13 miles northwest of the 1994
Northridge earthquake, the same location as
some of Saturday's quakes, said Steve Bryant, a
seismologist at Caltech.
