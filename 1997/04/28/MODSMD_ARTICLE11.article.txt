EAST PALO ALTO (AP) — Investigators began
sorting through evidence yesterday in connection
with a house fire that killed nine people, mostly
children, and said they had not ruled out arson as
the cause.
The probe into the blaze that began early Saturday
in a carport and quickly engulfed the home was being
treated as a homicide case, said San Mateo County
sheriff's Sgt. Donald O'Keefe.
"It's being listed as suspicious because of the ori
gin," he said. "It was six in the morning. No one was
out there working in the carport area. No one had a
barbecue going."
O'Keefe said investigators were examining evi
dence taken from the carport to determine if an accel
erant had been used. Neighbors and victims' relatives
were also being questioned.
But, O'Keefe said, "We don't have any leads at
this point."
The victims, including five small children, were
trapped by security bars on windows. Firefighters'
rescue efforts were thwarted by a burning car near

the front door and two pit bulls and a 60-pound Rot
tweiler at the rear of the dwelling.
The bodies were found in hallways, bedrooms
and closets.
In addition to t hose killed by the blaze, seven peo
ple, including three firefighters, suffered injuries.
O'Keefe said all were recovering Sunday.
Among the injured was the home's owner, 78-year
old Verna McKean, who escaped from the home with
her face and arms burned and a singed nightgown.
She screamed to neighbors, "Call the lire department;
my house is on fire and everyone is in there."
Quoting a neighbor, the San Jose Mercury News
reported that McKean had suffered several deaths in
her family recently, including the loss of a daughter
and brother to illness and a grandson to a shooting.
"There were always a lot of children over there,"
the neighbor said. "It will be sad not to see them."
One neighbor told the Mercury News that it was
unlikely anyone would harm McKean, who report
edly lived in the home with three daughters, a son
and nine grandchildren.
