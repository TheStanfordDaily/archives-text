Student body should
not decide which groups
get fees from the ASSU

Although all 30 groups
seeking special fees this year
received at least part of their
requested money, the fee process
continues to call into question
whether having students vote on
requests is the most effective sys
tem of distributing funding.
The current fee system reflects
reforms made two years ago that
allow groups to choose whether to
request a fee from undergraduates
only, from graduate students only
or from both groups. In addition to
that change, many other reforms
have been attempted, and even
more ideas have been tossed out.
Through all the changes, though,
the special-fee process remains fun
damentally flawed. Instead of per
petuating the futile efforts to come
up with a sensible fee system, the
ASSU Senate should take action to
eliminate the system.
In its place should be a more sub
stantial allocation to the three gen
eral fees charged to students each
year — money that goes to the Pub
lications Board, Program Board and
Community Service Board.
The ASSU Senate and members
of those boards, then, would be
responsible for allocating the money
in the manner in which they see fit.
Before the implementation of the
Common Sense Fefßeform, groups
were required to request a fee from
both all students; as a result, many
requests failed because graduate
students were more averse to pay
ing astronomical fees.
But the effect of that reform is
that very few groups ask for any
money at all from graduate stu
dents. Groups have rearranged
their governing structures or sepa
rated their graduate-student ele
ments so they can plausibly argue
that only undergraduates should be

responsible for the fee. And you can
hardly blame them: Last year, 10 of
11 groups that failed to win a special
fee did so because not enough grad
uate students voted.
But although they're saving
money, graduate students are losing
under this system as well. Sure,
they aren't being forced to fund the
International Undergraduate Com
munity's activities, but they are
being grouped on one side of an
ever-more definable line between
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents at Stanford.
This year nearly all groups
applied to undergraduates only, and
because they all passed, next year's
voters are unlikely to be so free with
their money. Not as many groups
will get funded for the 1998-99
school year, and the senate will once
again wonder what went wrong.
Having the senate and its Appro
priations Committee instead deter
mine who deserves a fee and how
much they deserve would be a more
effective system — but it would
have to be implemented carefully.
High voter turnout on a regular
basis would be of utmost impor
tance. The senators students elect
will ultimately be responsible for
what students are charged. They
will serve on the Appropriations
Committee, and they will approve
the nominations of students to the
program, community service and
publications boards.
It will be necessary for students
to trust the senators with this
responsibility so they don't have to
be worried about exorbitant fees or
partisan funding. In entrusting the
distribution of fees to these groups,
students will be giving up their
rights to refunds, making a fair,
diverse and well-educated elected
body even more important.
There inevitably will be draw
backs, too, to a system that doesn't
allow students to vote on groups'
fee requests individually. But years
of work have shown that special
fees aren't the answer to providing
student groups with funding. It's
time to admit that.
