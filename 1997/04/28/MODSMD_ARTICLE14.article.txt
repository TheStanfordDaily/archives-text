Politicos must realize that elections can't be flawless

MOST STUDENTS DON'T care
much who wins the race for
ASSU president.
They should.
The student body president oversees
all ASSU operations including Sunday
Flicks, Lecture Notes and all special-fee
funding. In one way or another, the presi
dential election affects every one of us.
That's why we thought it essential to
create a framework for representative stu
dent government when we wrote and
sponsored a new ASSU Constitution last
year. Despite the existence of an indepen
dent Elections Commission to oversee the

election, the ASSU Senate now may over
turn the votes of nearly 4,000 students
and hold a new presidential election.
Elections are always controversial.
Two years ago, the winning Council of
Presidents slate faced allegations of rmy'or
rule violations. That slate won by a mar
gin of just 10 percent, compared with
Emily Andrus' 23-point margin this year.
Nonetheless, the Elections Commission
felt that year's election was conducted
fairly, and the senate certified the results.
Two years ago, students in Oxford
couldn't vote. Last year students in Kyoto
apparently didn't get to vote. Every year,

losing candidates make allegations of
exorbitant spending by the victors. Every
year, the Elections Commission carefully
reviews these complaints.
We designed the new constitution to
ensure a reasonably fair elections process.
But the system is only as good as the stu
dents who serve in student government.
And if past experience is any guide, we'd
put our money on the spaceship following
Comet Hale-Bopp before betting on the
ASSU conducting a flawless election.
Over the past two weeks, as in previous
years, the senate has come under fire
from one of the losing presidential candi

dates who hopes to overturn the election
and give himself another shot at winning.
The Elections Commission exists to
prevent students with these kinds of polit
ical aims from disrupting the elections
process.
The commission has ruled the election
valid. We now urge the senate to put aside
political objectives and certify the results.
