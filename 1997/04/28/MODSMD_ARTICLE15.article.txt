# Candidate's printing costs put validity of election into doubt
## 
### 
Until the recent uproar over the
ASSU election I must admit I was oblivi
ous to the true nature of campus politics.
I thought them to be an arena of sincere
if largely futile efforts to simulate democ
racy while pursuing the common good.
That opinion is poised to change.
Enough ink has spilled this week over the
inexcusable disenfranchisement of 53 stu
dents at the Oxford campus. Never mind,
therefore, that the whole election was
flawed from the outset. Instead, I write to
express my concern that the presidential
election was defiled by a failure on the
part of at least one campaign to obey the
designated spending limits.
Common sense led me to suspect that
certain color posters cost more than $300,
the limit candidates could spend on pub
licity. A trip to Kinko's — where this cam
paign claims to have produced the posters
— confirmed my intuition. According to
the printer, many of that campaign's
posters, that it says were produced on a
personal printer for less than $3 each —
could not have been made for less than

$15 per square foot on what is known as
an oversized "thermal dye sublimation"
printer costing upward of $40,000.
These materials were not mere color
photocopies nor are their other posters,
which clearly come from a two-color off
set printing press. Hun a wet finger over
one of them and watch the ink run.
It is not toner. Scrutinize it under a
microscope, observe its impeccable resolu
tion: at least 600 dots per inch. These are
beautiful pieces. I admire them as art.
Perhaps we should remember that ccr
tain presidential candidates had access to
a professional graphic designer — in fact,
that this designer was one of their moth
ers. My compliments to the family. I sus
pect that we cannot dismiss this factor as
we undertake a thorough examination of
the problems surrounding the election.
In truth, I find it reprehensible that
no one has truly raised the flagrant vio
lations of campaign spending limits to
the light of critical analysis. This indi
cates a widespread disrespect for the
intelligence and integrity of the Elec
tions Commission and for the entire
Stanford community.
As a business owner for four years,
each spring I mail out a brochure. Let
me tell you, if these presidential candi
dates could negotiate the price of their
poster portfolio to a figure under $300,
they have achieved the impossible.

I need their help in designing and
printing my new brochure — or access
to their mothers, at least.
I do not intend this letter as an accu
sation but as an evocation of my con
cern that Stanford students are being
both ignored and deceived. I implore
The Daily, the ASSU and my fellow
scholars to seek out the truth of this
election before it enters Stanford histo
ry as a tragedy of logistical errata,
intentions gone awry and ineffective
ethical questioning.
