# Lie-in to demonstrate community solidarity
## 
### 
Most of you have probably heard
about some of the recent homophobic
incidents on campus. These include the
vandalism of The Bollard eating club
with anti-gay graffiti, the removal or
defacement of pro-queer symbols from
people's doors and cars and the assault of
a student during an attempt to remove
rainbow and Mexican flag stickers from
his door. I am sure most of you share my
disgust at these acts of hate directed at
members of the Stanford community.

It's time to do something about it.
We need a strong statement by all stu
dents, faculty and staff (straight, queer,
questioning, whatever) that homophobia
will not be tolerated. Today at noon we
will make this statement in the form of a
lie-in in White Plaza. We will spend one
minute lying on the ground in silence for
recognition and reflection.
The lie-in will send a powerful mes
sage to people who may commit acts of
hate in the future, whether as a joke or
deliberately hurtful. These actions will
not be tolerated.
The lie-in will show support for queer
and questioning students who feel
threatened or violated bv these acts. The
majority of this campus is disturbed by
these occurrences, and we need to let
those who are hurting know that. We all
deserve to feel safe.
The lie-in will demonstrate solidarity
with communities affected by acts of hate.
The marginalization of all groups is con
nected, and we make a strong statement
when we stand up (or lie down) together.
We will be meeting at noon today to
lie-in at 12:1.5. The minute of silence will
be followed by a party for those who wish
to stay and celebrate. This is your chance
to make a statement against hateful
actions. Confront homophobia and lie-in.
