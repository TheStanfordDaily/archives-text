## A 						long and winding road 
### 
WHAT WITH THE crackdown on
red-light runners and the
toughening of standards on the
DMV test, bad drivers are the hot but
ton issue of Bay Area talk. In Los Ange
les, which is where I learned to drive,
the roads are not half so dangerous
because no one is moving. But people in
Northern California, who look with
great disdain upon Southerners and our
deeply painful attachments to our cars,
seem to pride themselves on their vehic
ular independence. They have their
BART and their CalTrain and their
bicycle lanes. Here everyone apologizes
for having cars, although I don't see
anyone getting rid of them.
I am not sure that driving would enjoy
such a bad reputation here if it weren't
for all of the terrible drivers that the
DMV is so worried about. Stanford is
home to some of the worst driving that I
have ever seen — and I've been to
France. To be fair, this is not all the fault
of the drivers. There are the bicycle peo
ple, careening through stop signs, dart
ing in front of cars in the pitch-black of
night. There is the construction, which
has made people so frustrated they are
forced to come up with innovative short
cuts like driving on the sidewalk.
The latest atrocious development is
the transformation of May field Avenue
from convenient street to enormous
blind spot. Everyone who is unhappy
with those miserable parking spaces that

make it impossible to see bikers, pedes
trians or other cars while leaving the
Tresidder parking lot, send e-mail to my
friend Ken Ho (kenho@leland), trans
portation office intern extraordinaire.
Even though it was not his idea to put
the spaces in, he doesn't think they are
such a bad thing, which, in the court of
public opinion, makes him guilty as
charged. Also, I know him and because
he's not taking classes, maybe he'll even
answer your mail.
But it's not just transportation office
policy which needs fixing. Making the
driver's test harder does not seem to be
the best way of improving things. Know
ing the rules is not the same thing as
knowing how to follow them. My grand
mother has a friend who won't go in
reverse (How does she park, you ask. She
circles. For a long, long time.) Not every
thing in the world can' be traced to a
shortage of common sense, but the driv
ing situation seems ripe for it.
There are places where students
aren't allowed to graduate high school
without driver's training. Not just read
ing the manual — actually going out on
the road. How simple and brilliant this
is, the recognition that there are skills,
common-sensical, necessary skills that
make a person an educated human
being. They shouldn't stop with driving.
Someone ought to make every high
school teach a class on life skills. For
girls and boys, both.

This is what they would learn how to
do: change a flat tire, fill out a tax form,
fix a toilet, cook a balanced meal that
does not come from a box, balance a
checkbook, wash laundry, put on a con
dom, defend yourself from a personal
attack and drive a car. That seems to
cover all the basics: personal safety, emo
tional and physical well-being, fiscal sol
vency and transportation. The freedom
to move and the abilities to do it.
Driving is one of the few pleasures
left that has not been declared illegal or
immoral. The people in the driver's seat
know the pure, unadulterated high of
an open window, a long stretch of road
and a song that makes you take your
hands off the wheel and dance like a
spirit possessed.
But more than the rush of it, there is
the freedom to come and go, fully self
determined. For those who are curious
and intrepid, lost and then found, driving
encourages a self-confidence in move
ment and a desire to go beyond what is
known. There is both the keen logic of
maps and the dazzling originality and
improvisation of shortcuts. Sometimes,
creativity is fueled by language, but
sometimes it's fueled by gasoline.
