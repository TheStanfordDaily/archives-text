## Spring Migration attracts dance fans

Students, alumni, faculty and aficionados
flocked to campus this past weekend for
Spring Migration, an annual gathering of di
verse dance styles.
Presented by the Stanford Dance Division,
performances were held this weekend and
continue this Friday and Saturday at 8:30

talent on campus, hut most of them are not

Participants in this year's show range from
Stanford graduate Brenton Chang, this year's
