## Spring Migration attracts dance fans 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Students, alumni, faculty and aficionados
flocked to campus this past weekend for
Spring Migration, an annual gathering of di
verse dance styles.
Presented by the Stanford Dance Division,
performances were held this weekend and
continue this Friday and Saturday at 8:30
p.m. in Roble Dance Studio.
From flamenco to '80s dance to tap, the
program showcases a wide variety of Stan
ford's talent.
"Stanford isn't thought of as a dance
school, but many alums are making a mark
and proving Stanford as a magical place where

dance takes place," said Stanford dance in
structor Tony Kramer, the co-director of
Spring Migration along with Drama Lecturer
Diane Frank.
Now in its 19th year, Spring Migration
began as an opportunity for Stanford alumni
to return to campus to showcase their dance
talents and has evolved into a collaboration in
volving students, faculty and alumni.
Kramer said the only requirement for par
ticipants is that their piece be original in its
meaning.
"We'd like to see a lot of the artist and cre
ator involved. We encourage students to avoid
the correct way to dance but to go into them
selves," he said.
Frank said what is most remarkable about

this year's dancers is the diversity of interests
they display.
"There is an enormous amount of dance
talent on campus, hut most of them are not
dance majors," she said. "Dance is a secret life
that takes up a Rood number of their hours in
any given day. They are deeply committed."
Participants in this year's show range from
Stanford graduate Brenton Chang, this year's
winner of the May Edith Clifford Choreogra
phy Award, to first-time dancers.
Senior Issac Roth, a beginning dancer, com
pared dancing to a process of discovery and
learning about one's body.
"It's like giving the audience a window into
a moment of our lives, and as such, it requires
a lot of confidence in oneself and,
in that relationship, to perform,"
he said.
Sophomore Lisa Talma will
perform "Fabulous Feet," a tap
piece, in the hopes of bringing tap
dance to Stanford.
"There is a pretty strong dance
atmosphere on campus, but it is

missing some key elements," she
said. "I was so surprised that they
didn't have [tapj here. There real
ly isn't anything quite like it."
Spring Migration also extends
to other types of artists within the
Stanford community. Seniors
Yasmin Craig and Pamina Kim
will perform a live accompani
ment of Bartok's "Duo for Two
Violins" during the second week
end of performances.
Craig said there is a special
dynamic between dancer and

musician.
"Through looking at their
movement, I can read their bodies
as a score," she said. "What I do
influences how they move their
body."
Kramer hopes the concert will
educate the Stanford community
about dance.
"We would like to let everyone
find their proper expression in
dance," he said. "Dance is an
amazing container for culture and
the expression of information."
