# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Yuppie chow and pompous-granates? Aisle six, please 
### 
Sometimes we can discover a
whole new universe in our own
backyard. Or just beyond it if we
have a car. Such a discovery was recent
ly mine to make. A friend and I were
baking brownies when darn it if we
didn't run out of matzo meal (we all
know how that feels, eh?), and suddenly
our recipe had to be remedied.
Don't worry, this isn't another column
about Passover. It's about food. Whole
Foods to be exact, as in Whole Foods Mar
ket, which my friend innocently men
tioned as the means to our end.
But what started out as a quick short
age-ending sortie turned into an odyssey
of Homeric proportions as I found myself
sweeping through the automatic doors of
no return. I entered and, immediately,
something felt wrong. One step into the
joint and I realized that I should have
just played it Safeway. One step and I
realized that I didn't belong.
That's not to say I was unwelcome —
my entrance was met cheerfully by the
courteous staff. One step and I was
awash in a torrent of warm greetings and

free samples — the gentle lovebombing
exercised to perfection by any good cult.
"Ha ha, no tahini for me," I said
politely. "Just had a big lunch." I patted
my empty stomach.
The offering employee nodded good
naturedly but knowingly. "He's that
kind," she was probably thinking. "The
kind that has a big lunch." She smiled.
"OK, just let me know if you need any
help."
Or did she say "hemp?" I couldn't tell
for sure.
Organic honey creme. Organic smooth
and crunchy nut butter. Unsweetened
lemon mayonnaise. Raw wheat germ
flakes. Jamaican ginger root.
Strange creatures whose names I had
never known called out to me from their
perches high on polished ledges as my
curiosity sucked me down one aisle and
spit me out into another. I was especially,
uh, moved by one section I'll just call
Fiber Fest USA. Strolling down the aisle
was like revisiting the evolution of Meta
mucil. It must be good for business to
have so many regular customers.

Carob non-dairy rice beverage. Bee
pollen energy shake. Chlorophyll liquid.
Organic plum and banana baby food.
Wheat-free brown rice bread.
Bread without wheat? What kind of
people shop here?
Well, that I can sum up for you in just
two stereotypes: The middle-aged clien
tele can probably trace their fancy for
natural wheat germ and rice puffs back
to their youth when they opposed unnat
ural things like abstinence and bombing
Cambodia. Meanwhile, you'll find
younger customers pulling up for a snack
in their Cabriolet convertibles, flashing
smirky smiles that let you know they're
too chic for Juice Club. Sprinkled among
them, a few normal types. I noticed no
old people or children.
Of course, there were also a few home
less sorts — you know, the ones Palo Alto
keeps trying to get rid of, but goshdarnit
if they just won't go away. And who can
blame them? Free food is free food, even
if it is organic. Besides, with its comfy
clapboard cafe booths and carpeted aisles,
Whole Foods is a great place to sit or lie.

Now, don't let any of my bitter intona
tions betray me. I'm really not sorry that
I made the trip. Anything's worth doing
once, and just the few minutes alone I
spent in the organic beer section intro
duced me to a Whole new world. At times,
it was exciting and even a little sinful. I
was almost tempted to lunge out for an
Almond Raisin Nookie Bar that clearly
wasn't kosher for Passover.
But as I was leaving I realized the
source of my discomfort. The Whole
experience had strikingly recalled for me
the great dividing line that stands
between all that which is Yuppie in this
town and that which is Not.
This, of course, is no revelation.
Everybody knows that Palo Alto means
"tall tree," not "college town." We've got
some nightspots that close at twilight,
and when people go out, it's usually to
Blockbuster. And during the day, on the
weekend, where you gonna go? Yosh for
Hair? Not my hair.
Whole Foods is likewise "upscale"
and therefore seems taboo. Everyone I
talked to had been there "lib, once,

maybe" or not at all.
"Whole Foods?" reacted one friend in
confusion. "What do they sell at Whole
Foods? Whole cows? Whole pigs?"
But at the same time, despite our
complaints, Palo Alto's yuppie facade
does much to shape the image and self
image of our campus. The little galleries
and boutiques on University Avenue
represent a line that we all wouldn't
mind crossing. And maybe Whole Foods
aroused some cognitive dissonance
because, though I laugh now, I secretly
hope one day to support a lifestyle
where I can be that particular about my
basic needs.
Or maybe I was just mad they were out
of matzo meal.

Victor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, has nothing against eating
healthy. When he was little, his mom
never let him eat sugared cereals, and he
never complained, not once.
