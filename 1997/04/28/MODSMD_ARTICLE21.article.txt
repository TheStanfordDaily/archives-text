## Card tennis teams rock Pac-10s Stanford men sweep all categories of the competition 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
There was only one problem for
the Stanford men's tennis team as
it dominated the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships this past
weekend in Ojai, Calif.: It needed
more events to win.

The finals of the four draws
were more reminiscent of a Cardi
nal tennis practice than a tourna
ment including the best players L
the Pac-10, as Stanford had a
miraculous weekend, sweeping all
four events and facing its own
teammates in two of the final
matches.

"This is about as good as it
gets," said head coach Dick Gould.
"The guys did an amazing job."
The two-time defending cham
pion took the entire Pac-10 by
storm, thrashing its rivals across
the board as six of the Card's top
eight players reached the finals in
at least one event.

Freshman Bob Bryan, current
ly ranked 23rd in the nation, added
another impressive title to his list
of accomplishments as a Cardinal,
defeating sophomore teammate
Ryan Wolters 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 to claim
the Pac-10 individual title.

Bryan earned an impressive
win against UCLA's Eric Taino,
the top seed in the tournament
and the No. 9 player in the nation
6-3, 6-4 before reaching the finals.
Wolters took out USC's George
Bastl 6-4, 7-5 to reach his team
mate in the finals of the open
event.
"Ryan and Bob were devastat
ing in the semifinals, taking out
Bastl and Taino," Gould said.
"Those are huge wins for us."
In the doubles, Stanford fared
well again. Alec Decret and Taino
of UCLA took out Stanford fresh
men Bob and Mike Bryan in the
semifinal, 6-2, 6-3. Meanwhile, in
the other half of the draw Wolters
and junior Paul Goldstein, in his
first tournament appearance
since his foot injury in March,
knocked off Kevin Lin and Eric
Kim of UCLA to reach the finals.
The two Stanford Ail-Americans
crushed Decret and Taino in the
finals 6-2, 6-1 to claim the Pac-10
doubles title.
"This was a tremendous win in
the doubles for Ryan and Paul,
and it is great to have Paul back in
the lineup," Gould said.
"We are extremely pleased that
everyone seems pretty healthy
coming out of the weekend."
Freshman Geoff Abrams had
a spectacular weekend of tennis
as well, when he took home two
titles in the invitational draw of
the tournament. Abrams cruised
past Akram Zaman of USC to
reach the finals of the invita
tional 7-5, 6-2. Abrams' team
mate, junior Charles Hoeveler
breezed by Washington's Nick
Quatyrochi 6-3, 6-3 to create
another Stanford vs. Stanford
final. Abrams defeated Hoeveler
in the final 6-4, 6-4.
In the doubles of the invitation
al, Abrams teamed up with senior
Grant Elliott to claim the fourth
and final title for the Card.
Abrams and Elliott pulled out the
win against USC's Fernando
Samyoa and Akram Zaman 6-3, 3-
6, 6-0.
Stanford will return to the
Farm to do more of what it did
at the Pac-10 Championships in
Ojai: play its teammates and
begin to prepare for the pinnacle
of its season when it heads
south again to UCLA for the
NCAA Championships, begin
ning May 17.
