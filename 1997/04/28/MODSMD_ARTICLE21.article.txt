### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
There was only one problem for
the Stanford men's tennis team as
it dominated the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships this past
weekend in Ojai, Calif.: It needed
more events to win.

The finals of the four draws
were more reminiscent of a Cardi
nal tennis practice than a tourna
ment including the best players L
the Pac-10, as Stanford had a
miraculous weekend, sweeping all
four events and facing its own
teammates in two of the final
matches.

"This is about as good as it
gets," said head coach Dick Gould.
"The guys did an amazing job."
The two-time defending cham
pion took the entire Pac-10 by
storm, thrashing its rivals across
the board as six of the Card's top
eight players reached the finals in
at least one event.

Freshman Bob Bryan, current
ly ranked 23rd in the nation, added
another impressive title to his list
of accomplishments as a Cardinal,
defeating sophomore teammate
Ryan Wolters 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 to claim
the Pac-10 individual title.
