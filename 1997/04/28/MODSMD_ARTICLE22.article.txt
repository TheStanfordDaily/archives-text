# Julie Scott takes second straight Pac-10 individual title

### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
For the second straight year,
junior Julie Scott went from the
bottom of the Stanford women's
tennis lineup to the top of the
Pacific 10 Conference in just one
weekend.
Scott earned her second straight
Pac-10 singles title this weekend in
Ojai, Calif., by defeating Arizona's
top player Vicky Maes in straight
sets 6-2, 6-3. Maes is the No. 3 sin
gles player in the country and last
year's Pac-10 player of the year.
"I hadn't really thought about
Irepeating] as a goal," Scott said. "I
just looked at it as an opportunity
to get some more good matches in
before NCAAs. I really was just

looking to play quality tennis."
Scott, who has lost just one
match the entire season, could not
have been more quality this week
end. The win in the finals marked
the third straight match in which
Scott, the No. 6 player in the Stan
ford lineup and the No. 16 player in
the country, upset a No. 1 player
from the toughest conference in
women's tennis.
"I guess I just get really psyched
to play those matches," Scott said.
"Playing at No. 6, you don't really
get a chance to play in those
matches."
Scott made a name for herself a
year ago at Pac-lOs. Coming from
the Cardinal's No. 5 spot and not
ranked very high, Scott emerged
from relative obscurity to win last

year s crown.
"I think the difference was that
this year I won some really good
matches against the top competi
tion," Scott said. "Last year, a lot of
the top players lost in the early
rounds. This year I got to play
them."
In the semifinals, Scott met a
familiar face, teammate Lilia
Osterloh. The freshman, who
was recently assigned the No. 1
position for the Cardinal, took
the first set from Scott. The
junior co-captain fought back,
however, advancing to the finals
with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.
"It's always tough to play a
teammate," Scott said. "It was
good for me because I never got a
chance to challenge for the top

spots with Lilia. But all the pres
sure was on her to win, and I could
just go out and play tennis."
The third giant to feel Scott's
wrath was Arizona State's Reka
Cseresnyes. Ranked No. 18 in the
country, Cseresnyes fell to Scott in
straight sets 6-3, 6-3.
Scott cruised in the first two
rounds, earning wins over UCIA's
Kelly Rudolph and Washington's
Zeta Wagner.
Osterloh enjoyed success until
meeting the eventual champion in
the semifinals. Coming into the
tournament with an unbeaten
streak in Stanford's last six Pac-10
dual matches, Osterloh continued
her tear, beating ASU's Stephanie
