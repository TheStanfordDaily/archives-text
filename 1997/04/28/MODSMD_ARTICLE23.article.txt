# Baseball takes three from Cal
## 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Stanford and USC would make a great team. At
least, the Cardinal baseball team would tell you so.
The Card's weekend sweep of California, coupled
with the Trojan's taking two of three from UCLA,
allowed Stanford to take over sole possession of first
place in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
"We were expecting USC to take only one from
UCLA — maybe," said senior first baseman Luke
Quaccia. "They certainly did more than we ever could
have hoped."
UCLA is now two games behind the Cardinal with
only one weekend left before the two teams match up
at Jackie Robinson Field for the last series of the sea
son.
In the meantime, Stanford is determined to make
the most of the rest of the schedule.
In Friday's game Stanford (33-13, 17-7) made
short work of Cal in a contest that quickly turned into
a homerun derby.
Stanford pounded a total of 16 hits in nine innings
against six Cal pitchers en route to smashing seven
home runs. The Card rode the wave to a 14-2 victory.
Junior Jon Schaeffer and sophomore Josh
Hochgesang both went deep twice for the Cardinal.
Senior Chris Clark, sophomore Jody Gerut and fresh
man Nick Day also added to the pile with a homer
each.
The day of the long ball rubbed off on Cal's Aaron
Gordnier, as the junior designated hitter lofted a pair
of solo shots off Stanford starter Kyle Peterson. But
the rest of the Cal squad was reluctant to follow
Gordnier's example, and Peterson held the team to
two runs over eight innings. Peterson gave up eight
hits while striking out four in eight innings of work.
Junior Josh Koons breezed through the ninth for
the save.
Saturday's game was more egalitarian — Stanford
only won by eight in a stunning shutout of the Gold
en Bears.
The game started slowly, as Stanford starter Brent
Hoard traded outs with Cal starter Jon Shirley for
the first three innings.
But sophomore Jody Gerut's RBI single in the
fourth gave the Card a one-run lead, and two monster
homeruns by Quaccia and Clark gave Stanford a ten
tative 3-0 lead by the end of the fifth.
Cal's biggest threat came in the top of the next
inning, when Gordnier started the sixth inning off by
slapping a single find was able to advance to second on
an error by second baseman Joe Kilburg. But two
outs later, Hoard had masterfully guided the Cardi
nal through the only rocky terrain of the game with
two straight strike outs.
In the bottom of the inning Stanford broke the
game open. After Kilburg was hit by a pitch, fresh
man Edmund Muth followed by slapping a single into
right field. Then, when Cal catcher Jason Hill let
Shirley's first offering scoot through his legs, Kilburg
and Muth advanced to second and third with no outs.
Then Cal seemed to settle down as Shirley was
able to strike out Gerut with a screaming curve that
Gerut didn't even swing at.
With one out, Shirley induced Schaeffer to pop the
ball up in foul territory. But the
fates started to turn against Cal
when Hill, facing into the sun, lost
the ball allowing it to fall safely
foul. Schaeffer went on to draw a
walk, loading the bases for Quaccia.
Quaccia extended his tear
through Cal pitching, sending a
laser shot screaming through the
legs of shortstop Ivan Lewis to
score Kilburg and Muth and send
Schaeffer to third. Quaccia finished
3-for-4 with two RBI, two runs
scored, and a homerun.
Schaeffer scored one batter later
on a grounder to second by sopho
more Josh Hochgesang, increasing
the Card's lead to 6-0.
Stanford added two more runs
in the eighth, to finish out the game
8-0.
Meanwhile, Hoard cracked
down on the Bears, giving them
only four hits and putting only two
runners on base after the fourth
inning. He hurled all nine innings
of the contest to notch the first
complete game of his career, get
ting seven strikeouts and walking
four.
"Definitely my best outing of the
year," Hoard said.
Hoard credited the prodigious
offense for a chunk of his success.
"Our hitters are doing a great job.
It really takes away the pressure on
the mound if a pitcher has a lead to
work with," he said.
Stanford completed the sweep of
a beleaguered Cal corps with a 12-6
victory yesterday.
Stanford starter Chad Hutchin
son, despite giving up six runs
including a grand slam, was able to
guide the Cardinal past Cal for the
third straight game. Hutchinson
pitched the whole game, giving up
six runs on seven hits and striking

out seven in nine innings of work.
Stanford's offense was bolstered
again by Schaeffer, who had his
second two-homerun performance
of the series. The duo of Quaccia
and Clark again blasted towering
homers to solidify the lead for
Stanford. The Cardinal never
trailed.
But Quaccia thinks the offense,
despite the success this weekend,
hasn't found it's maximum height.
"We're running pretty good
right now," he said, "but we cer
tainly can get better."
Stanford will have its next
chance tomorrow night in a non
conference matchup with Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo at Sunken Dia
mond.
