# Men's volleyball beats UCLA in three
## Final Four berth ahead 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
If the crowd of 1,648 who
watched Stanford's dismantling
of UCIjA on Saturday are not
convinced that Stanford has the
best volleyball team in the land,
it must be living in some sort of
pro-Bruin la-la land.
For those firmly planted in
reality, there is a strong senti
ment that the season should end
now and the athletic depart
ments of Penn State, Ball State
and UCIA — the other teams
that will be traveling to Colum
bus, Ohio, to play Stanford for
the NCAA title — should save
themselves the plane fare and
collectively chip in to pay for the
cost of shipping the trophy to
Palo Alto.
Sure, no big deal that the Car
dinal (25-3, 21-3 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) beat the
Bruins (23-4, 18-4 MPSF) in
three games 15-11, 15-2, 15-10.
Stanford has beaten up oppo
nents all year. However, not
every foe is IJCIiA. The Bruins
have been as dominant in volley
ball over the past three decades,
winning 16 championships
including the past two, as any
team in any other sport over the
same period.
This year, despite being
ranked second behind Stanford
at the season's outset, few would
have been surprised if UCLA had
captured the MPSF title. As the
year went on, it seemed that the
Bruins had once again positioned
themselves to claim another title.
The Bruins had defeated Stan
ford in four games, beaten then-
No. 1 Brigham Young in two con
secutive matches and not shown
any signs that they wen? ready to
let anyone assume the mantle of
the nation's top collegiate volley
ball team.
"This was a great match for
us," said senior setter Stewart
Chong. "It's been four years and
waiting."
"It is great to beat a top team
at their gym," said head coach
Ruben Nieves.
While everyone prepared to
crown the Bruins, the Stanford
squad was busy amassing an
impressive record of its own.

Never ranked below fourth, the
Cardinal stiffened after its loss to
UCI.A earlier this season. Since
that weekend, Stanford has not
lost a match. This streak
includes wins over numerous
top-10 teams, including BYU
Thursday. The Cougars are the
country's No. 4 team, and one of
only three teams, along with
UCLA and USC, to have beaten
Stanford all year.
Few, however, seemed to feel
that the Cardinal would beat the
Bruins. It appeared, after Stan
ford's victory Thursday night all
but guaranteed it a berth in the
Final Four, that the Cardinal's
season might Ik; a repeat of 1992,
where Stanford reached the final
game only to fall to MPSF foe
Pepperdine.
Nobody could have been
blamed for placing IJCLA on
such a pedestal, seeing as the
Bruins are the country's most
physically imposing team, aver
aging well over 6-feet 7-inches as
a starting size and carrying a
whole lot of experience and tradi
tion on their side.
Stanford clearly was not con
vinced or intimidated by the Bru
ins. All season long the Cardinal
has played with purpose. For
senior starters Chong, Matt
Fuerbringer, Mike Lambert and
Mike Hoefer, this is the last time
they have a chance to win it all.
The play of these seniors along
with that of freshman phenom
Andy Witt and junior Keenan
Whitehurst, a seasoned starter,
have succeeded in knocking
UCLA off of its pedestal and plac
ing Stanford there.
In the match on Saturday,
Stanford outplayed the Bruins in
every aspect of the game. While?
outside hitter Fuerbringer was
the only Stanford attacker that
had a particularly strong hitting
match, collecting 17 kills and bit
ting .556 for the match and con
tinuing his outstanding tourna
ment play, the (Cardinal managed
to excel it) nearly every other cat
egory.
The Cardinal served well,
compiling eight aces and only IK
errors, out-dug the Bruins 42-27,
outblocked the bigger IJCLA

squad and outhit it .351 to .164.
However, the most telling stat
for the Cardinal may be Stanford's
one service receive error. This area
of Stanford's game has been possi
bly the Cardinal's only glaring
weakness all year — it was not at
all evident Saturday.
"I think the big difference was
our service game," said Chong.
"We didn't miss many serves.
When we serve well, we give our
block time to get set, that's a huge
advantage. Nobody can beat us

when we get our serve in."
"Serving set the tone," said
Nieves. "We got their passers into
trouble so that they never really
got into a rhythm. Their quick hit
ters were not much of a factor. We
also received very well."
Stanford did a huge defensive
job on UCLA's big guns. Nihipali,
the Bruins' star senior outside hit
ter was stymied. While he did col
lect a team-high 14 kills, Stanford
limited him to .275 hitting.
For Stanford, the win gives it
the automatic berth to the Final
Four, to be held next weekend in
Columbus, Ohio. It also makes the
Cardinal the team to beat in
Columbus. In all likelihood, Stan

ford will have to beat the Bruins
again if it is to fulfill the prophecy
of the various polls and prognosti
cators who, at season's outset,
picked the Cardinal to narrowly
edge out the Bruins for its first
title. If this is the case, Stanford
will surely have many fewer
doubters this time around.
"I feel the same way I have felt
all year," said Nieves. "Whomever
we play, if both teams play well, we
will win. If both teams play badly,
we will win. If we play badly, the
other team will still have to play
well to beat us. If another team
plays badly and we play well, the
outcome of the match will be lop
sided like it was in this match."
