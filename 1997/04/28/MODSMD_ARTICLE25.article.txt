# One-two golf punch
## Kribel, Ray take team to second 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
With its postseason hopes on
the line, the Stanford men's golf
team delivered a clutch second
place finish in this weekend's U.S.
Intercollegiate at the Stanford Golf
Course, virtually guaranteeing
itself a spot at regionals. No. 4 USC
won, finishing eight strokes ahead
of the Card's 859 strokes.
Headlining Stanford's perfor
mance, sophomore Ail-American
Joel Kribel ran away with the indi
vidual title for the second consecu
tive year, scoring a five-under-par

-208 and outpacing his closest com
petitor by four strokes.
After a sparkling first round 67
Friday, Kribel led the field. Howev
er, a 75 in the second 18 holes
dropped him to 10th and seeming
ly out of contention.
"I was playing really well for the
first 24 holes, but I just lost it men
tally for awhile," he said. "I felt
that I was playing well, though,
and that if I could just get things
back together, I could come back."
And if Kribel was the only one
with such faith on Friday, Satur
day's third and final round left no
unbelievers. Roaring out of the

gate with five birdies in the first
seven holes, Kribel caught up with
second-round leader Roger Tam
bellini of USC, then promptly left
him in the dust en route to a tour
nament-low 66. Tambellini fin
ished tied for second at one-under
par.
"I was playing in the group
right behind him and kept seeing
him head straight to the hole," said
senior Conrad Ray. "It was neat to
be able to watch him do so well."
Ray himself, playing in hLs final
tournament on the Farm, pro
duced no less stellar of a perfor
mance, firing a 69-70-73 to record
a career-best 212 and finish tied
for second with Tambellini and
Arizona State's Scott Johnson.
"Traditionally, I've felt really
comfortable here at home," he
said. Ray notched a pair of fourth
place finishes in his two previous
tournaments on the Stanford Golf
Course.
Freshman Dusty Brett rode a
second-round 68 into a tie for 23rd
place. Sophomore Scott Wang's
three solid rounds left him in a tie
for 68th. No. 5 man senior Pete
Ligotti recovered nicely from a
first-round 83 to finish tied for
82nd. The Cardinal was also repre
sented by several individual
entries, most notably freshmen
Tylar Lunke and Michael Wiemer,
who tied for 50th and 61st, respec
tively.
Going into the weekend, the
team's chances for making region
als was precarious, with Stanford
ranked ninth in a close competi
tion for 12 spots from its district.
The system of ranking the teams is
based on head-to-head competition
with a stroke-average tiebreaker.
Stanford defeated seven of the
nine teams ahead of it, with only
the Trojans and Arizona, which
was not competing, escaping the
Cardinal surge.
"It was a good field," said junior
Jake Poe, who competed as an
individual. "USC could be the best
team in the country, the way
they've been playing this winter
and spring."
For the Cardinal, its success

was more gratifying than sur
prising, as the team has intensi
fied training since spring break
with the addition of morning
practices.
"It's a combination of hard
work and just peaking at the right
time," Ray said. "It's how Stanford

golf is typically known, and it's a
credit to coach [Wally Goodwin]
and the hard work of the players
that we're doing so well.
"We'd like to ride through Pac
10s with this momentum. Hope
fully, we can turn some heads
there before regionals."
