### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
With its postseason hopes on
the line, the Stanford men's golf
team delivered a clutch second
place finish in this weekend's U.S.
Intercollegiate at the Stanford Golf
Course, virtually guaranteeing
itself a spot at regionals. No. 4 USC
won, finishing eight strokes ahead
of the Card's 859 strokes.
Headlining Stanford's perfor
mance, sophomore Ail-American
Joel Kribel ran away with the indi
vidual title for the second consecu
tive year, scoring a five-under-par

-208 and outpacing his closest com
petitor by four strokes.
After a sparkling first round 67
Friday, Kribel led the field. Howev

dropped him to 10th and seeming
ly out of contention.
"I was playing really well for the
first 24 holes, but I just lost it men
tally for awhile," he said. "I felt
that I was playing well, though,
and that if I could just get things
back together, I could come back."
And if Kribel was the only one
with such faith on Friday, Satur
day's third and final round left no
unbelievers. Roaring out of the

gate with five birdies in the first
seven holes, Kribel caught up with
second-round leader Roger Tam
bellini of USC, then promptly left
him in the dust en route to a tour
nament-low 66. Tambellini fin
ished tied for second at one-under
par.
"I was playing in the group
right behind him and kept seeing
him head straight to the hole," said
senior Conrad Ray. "It was neat to
be able to watch him do so well."
