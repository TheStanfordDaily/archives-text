### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford softball (24-24-1, 5-15
Pacific 10 Conference) had a
strong weekend, acquiring two
wins each against Santa Clara and
Saint Mary's and playing tight
with No. 1 Arizona before losing
two close games to the Wildcats.
In game one against Santa
Clara, Stanford combined strong
pitching and well-dispersed hitting
to obtain a 4-1 victory. Sophomore
pitcher Becky Blevins shut down
the Broncos, allowing no hits,
walks or runs in six innings.
The Card had nine hits in the
game, led by two-hit performances

from sophomore shortstop
Michelle Schneider and sophomore
outfielder Kelly Yablonski. The
team scored twice in the second
inning and twice in the fiflh, giving
its pitchers a nice lead. It was a
solid game for Stanford, setting the
tone for the entire weekend.
Game two saw some fireworks
set off by Stanford's hitters, with
sophomore outfielder Michelle
Acosta and sophomore pitcher
Marcy Crouch both hitting home
runs in the game. Acosta's home
run allowed the squad to explode
for six runs in the first inning, and
the homer by Crouch ignited a five
run inning in the third. It was the
highest run total by the Cardinal

this season, and the most power
shown by Stanford in a game.
Yablonski added a double and the
team had 10 hits through five
innings when the game was called
due to the mercy rule.
Crouch and junior Jessica
Schulman shared the pitching
duties, with Crouch going three
innings and Schulman pitching
two and giving up only one hit.
Stanford showed continued
overall dominance against noncon
ference teams in Saturday's games
against St. Mary's. In the first
game Stanford defeated the Gaels
10-0. Blevins picked up the win for
