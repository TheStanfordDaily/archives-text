## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford softball (24-24-1, 5-15
Pacific 10 Conference) had a
strong weekend, acquiring two
wins each against Santa Clara and
Saint Mary's and playing tight
with No. 1 Arizona before losing
two close games to the Wildcats.
In game one against Santa
Clara, Stanford combined strong
pitching and well-dispersed hitting
to obtain a 4-1 victory. Sophomore
pitcher Becky Blevins shut down
the Broncos, allowing no hits,
walks or runs in six innings.
The Card had nine hits in the
game, led by two-hit performances

from sophomore shortstop
Michelle Schneider and sophomore
outfielder Kelly Yablonski. The
team scored twice in the second
inning and twice in the fiflh, giving
its pitchers a nice lead. It was a
solid game for Stanford, setting the
tone for the entire weekend.
Game two saw some fireworks
set off by Stanford's hitters, with
sophomore outfielder Michelle
Acosta and sophomore pitcher
Marcy Crouch both hitting home
runs in the game. Acosta's home
run allowed the squad to explode
for six runs in the first inning, and
the homer by Crouch ignited a five
run inning in the third. It was the
highest run total by the Cardinal

this season, and the most power
shown by Stanford in a game.
Yablonski added a double and the
team had 10 hits through five
innings when the game was called
due to the mercy rule.
Crouch and junior Jessica
Schulman shared the pitching
duties, with Crouch going three
innings and Schulman pitching
two and giving up only one hit.
Stanford showed continued
overall dominance against noncon
ference teams in Saturday's games
against St. Mary's. In the first
game Stanford defeated the Gaels
10-0. Blevins picked up the win for
the Cardinal, allowing only three
hits in five innings. Senior first
baseman Summer Lee had one of
her strongest offensive perfor
mances of the season, going 2 for 3
with three RBIs. Lee's two hits
included a clutch double to bring in
two runs. For the second game in a
row, the mercy rule was imple
mented with Stanford up 11-0.
Game two against St. Mary's
ended early as well because of the
mercy rule, with the Cardinal win
ning in six innings 10-0. Crouch
recorded the win for Stanford,
improving her record to l' 2-9 for
the season. Crouch pitched five
innings, allowing only two hits and
striking out three. Schulman came
in to relieve Crouch in the top of
the sixth inning to end the game.
On the offensive end, Acosta
and worked in tandem to lead
the attack. Acosta went 2 for 3 and
had 2 RBIs. Lee had two hits,
which included a double, that
brought in 2 RBIs. Lee shined on
Saturday, hitting .667 with 5 RBIs.
On Sunday, the Cardinal ran
into a wall called Arizona, the top
ranked team in the country.
Although Stanford lost both
games, 5-1 and 3-0, it was definite
ly an improvement over the team's
previous meetings with the Wild
cats.
"The team played with a lot of
heart today lagainst Arizona], and
to play the No. 1 team this close
shows how much we're improv
ing," Blevins said. "In one respect,
I'm disappointed that we lost
today, but I'm really happy about
our play this weekend."
Both games were well-pitched
by Stanford. Blevins pitched the
first game, holding Arizona to two
runs until the seventh inning.
Stanford actually held the lead in
game one, scoring first in the bot
tom of the second.
In the second game, Crouch had
a strong outing on the mound,
holding the Wildcats to one run all
the way up to the seventh inning.
The Cardinal had trouble at the
plate, having only one hit in the
entire game. Sophomore outfielder
Dawn Kobata recorded the only hit
for Stanford in the game and was
the only Cardinal to have a hit in
both games.
Stanford improved its record to
24-24-1 this weekend and kept its
regional hopes alive.
"We needed to win all our games
against Santa Clara and St. Mary's
in order to keep postseason play a
possibility," Blevins said. "And to
play Arizona this close says some
thing about our ability to com
pete."
