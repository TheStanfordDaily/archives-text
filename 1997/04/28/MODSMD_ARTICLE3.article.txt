# Casa Italiana marks 20 year anniversary

### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Standing in an empty plot of
land on the far corner of Mayfield
Avenue, Annamaria Napolitano,
senior lecturer in the French and
Italian Department, had a vision
of a house dedicated to Italian cul
ture and language.
Twenty years later, amid green,
white and red balloons and glasses
of wine, University President Ger
hard Casper, faculty members and
past and present house staff and

residents celebrated La Casa Ital
iana's second decade as a piece of
Italy on the Stanford campus.
French and Italian Prof.
Alphonse Juilland first suggested
the idea of an Italian theme house to
Napolitano. With a core group of stu
dents, Napolitano worked to bring
the plan to fruition. I>a Casa Italiana
became the first Italian theme house
in the Bay Area, although it was later
imitated at UC-Berkeley and Santa
Clara University.


Casper
Napolitano, known as "la
Mamma della Casa" remembered
early years at the house, when en
thusiasm was high although fund
ing from Residential Education
was low. Napolitano said she
"stole" chef Maria Catena from
the Italian consulate in San Fran
cisco. Catena's authentic Italian
dishes were so delicious, according
to Napolitano, that students
would form a line outside of the
house hoping to be invited in for
dinner.
La Casa Italiana house manag
er David Hay and financial manag
er Jeremy Smith presented the
first annual "VIP" or "Very Italian

Person" awards to Napolitano and
Classics Lecturer Patrick Hunt. It
was Napolitano's second award
from La Casa Italiana â€” she re
ceived her first in 1977, in the year
La Casa Italiana was established.
Hunt was recognized for his
archeological research in the Ital
ian Alps, which focuses on follow
ing Hannibal's famous marc Alps
with elephants. Hunt is the direc
tor of the Stanford Alpine Project,
which brings undergraduates to
the Alps to help at the archeologi
cal site.
Casper spoke of his own love for
Italy in a toast for La Casa Italiana,
saying "Italy has the most beauti
ful landscape, the best art and the
most wonderful food in Europe."
"I have always said that if you
can't live in Tuscany, the next best
place is the Peninsula," Casper

said, adding that he had tried to
add an Italian flavor to campus by
planting five cypress trees in front
of Hoover House, his residence.
He praised all those who have
worked to maintain La Casa Ital
iana for the past 20 years for
"bringing a bit of Italy to the Stan
ford campus." Casper finished by
saying, in Italian, "I hope that the
coming years of the casa will be as
magnificent as the first ones."
Carmen Nocentelli-Truett, who
with her husband, Sam Truett,
has been a resident fellow at La
Casa Italiana for two years, echoed
Casper's sentiments.
"We've grown tremendously in
the three years that I have been at
Stanford. I know that we will be as
vital and exuberant in future years
as we have in the recent past," No
centelli-Truett said.
