### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Standing in an empty plot of
land on the far corner of Mayfield
Avenue, Annamaria Napolitano,
senior lecturer in the French and
Italian Department, had a vision
of a house dedicated to Italian cul
ture and language.
Twenty years later, amid green,
white and red balloons and glasses
of wine, University President Ger
hard Casper, faculty members and
past and present house staff and

residents celebrated La Casa Ital
iana's second decade as a piece of
Italy on the Stanford campus.
French and Italian Prof.
Alphonse Juilland first suggested
the idea of an Italian theme house to
Napolitano. With a core group of stu
dents, Napolitano worked to bring
the plan to fruition. I>a Casa Italiana
became the first Italian theme house
in the Bay Area, although it was later
imitated at UC-Berkeley and Santa
Clara University.
