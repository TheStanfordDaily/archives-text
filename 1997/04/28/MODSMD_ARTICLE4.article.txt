# Protest of hate crimes planned
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Demonstrators in White Plaza
today hope to vividly respond to
what many see as an increasingly
public wave of anti-gay incidents.
Junior Rene Zermeno, the pro
gram co-ordinator of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, said protesters will lie down in
White Plaza at noon for five min
utes of silence, after which they will
pass out literature identifying the
problem of anti-gay incidents and
suggesting positive ways for indi
viduals to respond.
According to n statement from
the center, organizers expect more
than 200 people to attend and take
"a stand to reject all forms of hatred
on this campus,"senior Stephanie
Dittmer said.
An incident of vandalism at the
Suites on April 8 has focused atten
tion on anti-gay sentiment, but Zer
meno said he has continually expe
rienced prejudice since he came to
Stanford.
Recently, Zermeno said, the
door of bus room in Mirrielees was
vandalized by someone who re
moved posters and wrote racist and
anti-gay slogans. These increasing
ly obvious incidents stem from a
pattern that is less visible but still
hiis an effect, Zermeno said.
Organizers hope the demonstra
tion will show the opinion of the
wider community, which is that ha
treds and prejudices of any sort are
unacceptable.
"In my opinion, we really need
the entire Stanford community to
come together on this," Dittmer

said.
One positive way to help demon
strate such solidarity, Zermeno
said, is through stickers the demon
strators will pass out with "con
front homophobia" written on
them.
Zermeno said he hopes people
will display these stickers visibly,
both to start dialogue and to "make
queer people feel they're in a safe
place."
"It has to start on the individual
level," he added.
While much may be up to indi
viduals, many other campus orga
nizations have efforts under way to
educate or raise awareness.
Multicultural Educator Tommy
Woon said he and Ann Porteus, as
sociate director of the Office of Res
idential Education, were working
with residence staff on "opportuni
ties to Ik? proactive in restoring a
safe environment."
Efforts include a campaign to
display rainbow banners on apart
ments in Mirrielees. Woon estimat
ed that about one-third of residents
have taken part.
Woon also said he had made a
documentary film called "Not in
Our Town" available to .staff and
community centers. The film de
scribed an instance where residents
of a town rallied to display Jewish
symbols in their homes in solidarity
against a spate of anti-Semitic inci
dents.
So far, Woon said, he has re
ceived two requests for the film.
Educational efforts are also un
derway in the Athletics Depart
ment. The only suspect charged in
the incident, senior Jason Lunn, is a
track team member.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
said his office is acting in many of
the same ways it did when several
athletes were found guilty of defac
ing a "Gay Liberation" statue in
1994. At that time, the response in
cluded speakers and information
programs carried out through

coaches, Leland said.
"All of us in athletics feel terrible
about this," Leland said, noting
that, including club sports, about a
quarter of undergraduates "consid
er themselves athletes" and that
their reaction should not be espe
cially different from the rest of the
campus.
Dermitt, a crew team member,
said her teammates were outraged
by the vandalism and that she ex
pected half of them to attend
today's demonstration.
Another effort to confront the
problem came from the Rev. Mau

rice Charles, a dean of religious life
and member of an LGBCC advisory
board. He preached a sermon on
April 20 that he said reflected his
conviction that "no form of hate
speech is innocent."
Charles said, however, that in
his ongoing ministry, "most of my
efforts are directed toward being a
support for gay and lesbian people.
"It's difficult to raise people's con
sciousness until something like [the
Suites vandalism] happens," Charles
said, adding that once the immediacy
of such an event goes away, "after a
while, people tune out."
