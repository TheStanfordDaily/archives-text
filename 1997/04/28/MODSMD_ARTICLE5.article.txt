role in discovering the tau lepton,
said he felt it was a great honor.
Perl, who has been with the
Physics Department at Stanford
since 196.'} and currently works at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said he hopes to continue
to conduct research on character
istics of the tau lepton and to work
with old material, such as mete
orites, in attempting to find a cer

Bernheim also said he was
thrilled about his election to the
academy.
"It feels terrific," said Bern

honor."
Bernheim, who returned to

natural sciences, social sciences,
arts and humanities. The academy
also conducts a varied program of
