## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Sophomore Raphael Nendel-Flores, co-presi
dent of Stanford's True I/>ve Waits, had the op
portunity to sit on stage with Gov. Pete Wilson
last Thursday when Wilson announced a now
campaign encouraging responsible parenting.
Nendel-Flores was joined in Sacramento's
Arco Arena by about 100 other supporters of the
governor's plan, including Sacramento Kings
point guard Mitch Richmond, the cast and pro
ducers of the television series "Dangerous
Minds," corporate sponsors, executives of youth
organizations and even a representative from the
San Francisco Zoo. "Basically, there was this
hodgepodge of people," Nendel-Flores said.
The other co-president of the Stanford chap

ter, senior Ma ran Haugen, and the former co
president, engineering nnd philosophy graduate
student Vincent Mooney, accompanied Nendel-
Flores to the media kickofl I'hecampaign, which
is under the auspices of the California State Ue
partment of Health, is called "Partnership for
Responsible Parenting."
A nonpartisan organization that stresses sex
ual abstinence until marriage, True Love Waits
has existed at Stanford since 1994.
In an April 2'i letter to the Democratic Party,
Nendel-Flores stated, "I consider myself a very
literal and progressive Democrat, and Mr. Wil
son and I prohably do not agree on much. How
ever, he and I should and do agree on the issue of
abstinence."
Wilson unveiled a five-pillar campaign pro
moting responsible parenting. The first portion

to Ixi carried out emphasized public awareness
and commitment to the problems of teenage and
unwed pregnancies and promotion of sexual ab
stinence among teen.s.
At the conference, Wilson said h<? will attempt
to enforce statutory rape laws more strictly.
Many of the partners of unwed Uonage mothers
are more than 18 years old.
In addition, Wilson's office will launch an ad
vertising campaign promoting responsible par
enting that will target different demographic
groups.
"Responsible parenting is also spending more
time with youth," Mooney said.
According to information provided by Wil
son, 70,000 teenagers gave birth in California
last year. This amounts to one birth every eight
minutes.
"The overlying message for
[teenagers] was to take responsibili
ty for your actions," Nendel-Flores
said. "In college, but especially in

high school, people feel pressured to
fit in."
"I suppose both parties have
made an effort to concentrate on
family values," Haugen said.
She said she was glad to see that
abstinence was included as one of
the campaign's pillars.
"I was impressed by the empha
sis on abstinence rather than on

passing out condoms," Haugen said.
"I guess we feel that the safer sex
message has a lot of weaknesses."
Emotional side effects are just
one weakness, she said. In addition,
no birth control is 100-percent effec
tive.
"I think abstinence is a compo
nent to prevent irresponsible par
enting," Mooney said.
