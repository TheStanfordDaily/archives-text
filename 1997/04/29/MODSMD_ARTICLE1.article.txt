### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
More than 300 students gath
ered in White Plaza yesterday at
noon to rally against homophobia,
racism and sexism on campus.
"Hate breeds, and so long <is
people allow things to go past
them, it's going to continue," said
doctoral student Suzie Walker,
one the organizers of the event.
Walker added that the rally's
purpose was "to combat all hate
crimes."
The crowd joined hands in what
senior Rebecca Gould called a "big
circle of love" around White Plaza,
blocking it off from passers-by.
The Women's Center held a si
multaneous protest against the de
facement of the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault's "Clothesline Pro
ject" exhibit last week.
"The plague of the '90s is not
AIDS; it's self-absorption," said
law student Grace Pasigan. "All
hate is the same hate. If we don't
stand together, we will stand
alone."
Pasigan, the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center's
student administrator, said one
important goal of the rally was to

cuill fora professional director for
the center. The LGBCC is the only
campus community center with
out a director.
After joining hands in the circle,
students participated in a minute
of silence to recognize people suf
fering under hate crimes.
"Anti-gay rhetoric is not OK.
Racism is not OK. Sexism is not
OK," freshman Elly Matsumura
told the crowd. "We are here. We
are united. We stand together."
Following the lead of the orga
nizers, students chanted, "We're
here, we're queer, we will not
stand for fear; we're here, we're
straight, we will not stand for
hate" and"The community united
will never be divided."
Senior Stephanie Dittmer and
junior Rene Zermeno, organizers
of the event, said they were pleased
with the turnout for the rally.
"It totally stood against |the
stereotype of| Stanford apathy.
There were so many people,"
Dittmer said after the rally.
" I was really pleased that a lot of
people came and left empowered to
do something," said Zermeno.

More than 300 students rallied yesterday in White Plaza against the recent hate crimes that have occured on campus.
beth also said he was encouraged
by the turnout for the rally.
"This is what needs to happen
every time," Macbeth said.
"I think homophobia is dis
gusting. This and other hate
crimes on campus show how in
general the political climate is
that the bosses and politicians use
oppression to divide people," he
said.
"What we need is a coalition
made up of student groups that
can fight hate crimes," Macbeth
added.
"Stanford students are not ap
athetic," said junior Kristi Weiss,
an organizer of the rally. "I was
impressed and moved by the
strong show of support today, of
students standing against homo
phobic, sexist and racist hate
crimes on this campus."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
also expressed satisfaction with
the event's message.
"I thought today's rally was im
portant and successful in symbol
izing and articulating both the
[lesbian, gay and bisexuall and the
greater Stanford community's
concern regarding acts of discrim
ination and persecution of our
LGB community," Wais said in an
interview after the rally.
"Acts that demean others are
unwelcome and unacceptable at
Stanford, and the University will
do what is in its power to prevent
such incidents," Wais added.
Still, not everyone was happy
with the turnout.
"It's good because people saw
(the rally), but it wasn't big
enough. It's the others who

should've been here — the people
who aren't invested in it, who
have no attachment," said fresh
man Casey KaufTman.
"People are afraid to stand up
and say something they would be
lieve but are too afraid to say," he
added.
After the rally, students orga
nizers encouraged people to sign a
hate crimes registry and the peti
tion fora director at the center.
Zermeno said the hate crimes
registry is a log of all hate crimes
that will be kept at the center as
concrete evidence of hate crimes
on campus.
"The formal route that exists
now — going to the police — is so
intimidating because you're
taught not to say anything," said
Dittmer.
"It needs to be turned around,"
she said. "The focus shouldn't be
on the victim; it should be on the
victimizer."
Students handed out fliers de
tailing recent hate crimes and
stickers saying "confront homo
phobia."
One flier, distributed by the
LGBCC, was titled "Not on our
campus?" and described incidents
of homophobia that have occurred
at Stanford during the past few
years, including the vandalism of
the "Gay Liberation" sculpture in
1994 and the recent anti-gay graf
fiti in The Bollard eating club at
the Suites. Other fliers advertised
upcoming Women's Center and
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Days events.
Distributed by an unidentified
soUrce, another flier described an
incident Saturday night at a
Kappa Sigma party where fresh
man Nick Kelley was allegedly
asked by two men at the door if he
was a "fag" and was then barred

from the party.
"Two large men carded me at
the door around 11:30 p.m.," Kel
ley said, "and when I showed my
ID, they noticed I was wearing
blue nail polish and asked 'Are you
a fag?' They physically barred the
door and communicated to me
that I was not allowed in. I
grabbed the card and left."
The flier passed out in White
Plaza yesterday says, "Saturday
night, a Kappa Sig declared: No
Fags allowed."
Kappa Sig resident assistant
Jason Herthel said his fraternity
regrets any harm the homophobic
incident "may have caused any in
dividual Stanford student."
He added that because party se
curity was taking care of another
problem, they briefly were not at
the door when three individuals
not affiliated with the fraternity
made remarks to the incoming
guests.
"Kappa Sigma finds this alarm
ing behavior entirely unaccept
able. We have always welcomed
every member of the Stanford

campus regardless of their race,
gender or sexual orientation at
our house and at our parties,"
I lerthel said. He added that he un
derstood the flier was not sanc
tioned by the LGBCC.
Kelley did not implicate the
members of Kappa Sig. "I under
stand the Kappa Sigs' frustra
tions, but the fact is it should not
have happened at their doorstep,"
Kelley said. "They are no* the vic
tims in this situation."
Wais said the Dean of Students
Office was informed of the alleged
activities at Kappa Sig early yes
terday afternoon, and the Office of
Student activities was investigat
ing the events. "If there is any
substance to the allegations, we
hope to identify responsible indi
vidual or individuals and take ap
propriate action," Wais said.
"In addition, the University is
making a concerted effort to pro
vide educational opportunities to
increase and enhance community
awareness regarding respect, ci
vility, diversity and
inclusiveness."
