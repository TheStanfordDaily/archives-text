More than 300 students gath
ered in White Plaza yesterday at
noon to rally against homophobia,
racism and sexism on campus.
"Hate breeds, and so long <is
people allow things to go past
them, it's going to continue," said
doctoral student Suzie Walker,
one the organizers of the event.
Walker added that the rally's
purpose was "to combat all hate
crimes."
The crowd joined hands in what
senior Rebecca Gould called a "big
circle of love" around White Plaza,
blocking it off from passers-by.
The Women's Center held a si
multaneous protest against the de
facement of the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault's "Clothesline Pro
ject" exhibit last week.
"The plague of the '90s is not
AIDS; it's self-absorption," said
law student Grace Pasigan. "All
hate is the same hate. If we don't
stand together, we will stand
alone."
Pasigan, the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center's
student administrator, said one
important goal of the rally was to

cuill fora professional director for
the center. The LGBCC is the only
campus community center with
out a director.
After joining hands in the circle,
students participated in a minute
of silence to recognize people suf
fering under hate crimes.
"Anti-gay rhetoric is not OK.
Racism is not OK. Sexism is not
OK," freshman Elly Matsumura
told the crowd. "We are here. We
are united. We stand together."
Following the lead of the orga
nizers, students chanted, "We're
here, we're queer, we will not
stand for fear; we're here, we're
straight, we will not stand for
hate" and"The community united
will never be divided."
Senior Stephanie Dittmer and
junior Rene Zermeno, organizers
of the event, said they were pleased
with the turnout for the rally.
"It totally stood against |the
stereotype of| Stanford apathy.
There were so many people,"
Dittmer said after the rally.
" I was really pleased that a lot of
people came and left empowered to
do something," said Zermeno.
