## Refugees emerge from hiding 
### 
BIARO, Zaire (AP) — Thousands of Rwandan
Hutu refugees emerged from hiding in the jun
gles of eastern Zaire yesterday, their hunger
more powerful than their fear of the mobs that
drove them from squalid camps a week ago.
Aid workers estimated seeing 5,000-10,000
refugees, frightened, exhausted and desperate for
food, heading toward an abandoned camp at
Biaro, south of Kisangani. Until yesterday, inter
national officials could account for only a few
hundred of the at least 80,000 missing.
U.N. workers worked to bring in tons of food
for the starving Rwandans, while U.N. officials
argued for the refugees' immediate airlift back to
Rwanda — something Zaire's rebels have repeat
edly blocked.
"This is the only way. These people have to go
home," said Filippo Grandi of the U.N. refugee
agency.

"If I could go only today," refugee Sosthene
Ntirampaga said as he emerged from a week of
hiding and wandered into the camp.
Refugee camps housing about 80,000 Rwan
dans near Kisangani were found deserted last
week, five days after rebels fighting to oust Pres
ident Mobutu Sese Seko sealed the area to for
eign aid workers and journalists.
The refugees are among 1 million Rwandan
Hutus who fled into Zaire to escape retaliation for
the nation's 1994 genocide of a half-million Tutsis.
Most have returned; the Rwandans who remained
in Zaire camps increasingly were at odds with local
Zairians and rebels, many of them Zairian Tutsis.
Last week, Zairian mobs allegedly attacked the
camps with machetes, blaming the refugees for
the murders of six villagers. The mobs killed hun
dreds at one camp alone, and rebels also opened
fire there, the refugees say.
