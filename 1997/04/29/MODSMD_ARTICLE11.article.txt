# Standoff continues
## Leader claims Texas is independent 
### 
FORT DAVIS, Texas (AP) -
For months Richard McLaren has
been letting the world know he was
spoiling fora fight.
A pistol at his side and armed
guards at his back, the leader in
the Republic of Texas secessionist
movement seemed ready to make
good on his claims that he would
fight off any attempt to arrest him.
"These boys are asking fora
total military assault," McLaren
said last month in an interview
with The Associated Press. "Our
defense forces will fire because we
would consider it an invasion."
With images of Waco and Ruby
Ridge in their heads, sheriffs
deputies were in no hurry to arrest
McLaren. But after three of his fol
lowers took two people hostage
Sunday, law officers found them
selves in what they had hoped to
avoid all along: an armed standoff.
The Republic of Texas sepa
ratist group seeks to re-establish
Texas as a sovereign nation. To
that end, the organization has
waged "paper terrorism" against
the legal system, clogging the
courts with countless liens and
other dubious claims.
The county sheriff and the U.S.
Marshal's Service said it was not a
priority to serve two outstanding
warrants for McLaren's arrest, one
accusing him of contempt of court
for filing bogus liens, the other
charging him with burglarizing a
neighbor's house.
McLaren said federal, state and

local authorities were conspiring to
silence his claims. "They get a hold
of me and you won't see me for the
rest of my life," he said,
And last month, he threatened
to fight back, comparing his situa
tion to fatal standoffs at Waco and
Ruby Ridge.
"It's disgusting. I don't under
stand," resident Suzanne Parch
man said of the delay in attempting
to take McLaren into custody. "I
can't speed down the highway
without getting arrested."
When asked why the state had
not moved sooner to arrest
McLaren, Department of Public
Safety spokesmar Mike Cox would
only say that the warrants were
not issued by the state, and that
his department did nothing to
incite the raid and hostage-taking
on Sunday.
"The state did not come after
him," he said. "This was a criminal
act. We had no forewarning."
McLaren has long been consid
ered a thorn in the side of the com
munity. He had harassed residents
for years by filing bogus liens
against their property, residents
and officials say.
"He's trying to get something
for nothing. His operation is total
ly illegitimate. He's been involved
in one land-grab after another.
He's a total (expletive deleted) as a
neighbor," said Joe Rowe, who was
held hostage along with his wife by
McLaren's followers. Both were
released early yesterday.
