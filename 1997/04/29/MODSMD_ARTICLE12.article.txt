Flooding subsides in N. Dakota
PEMBINA, N.D.(AP) — After more than three
weeks, the end was in sight. The Red River's flood
crest — 30 miles of muddy, greasy water laden with
sewage, garbage and farm runoff — had all but
passed into Canada yesterday.
Its departure signaled the end to the worst of
what has been called a once-in-500-years flood.
"Good riddance," said Susan Fagerholt of
Hoople, summing up the sentiments of tens of
thousands of people on the northern Plains who
were driven from their homes during the Red's
250-mile flood course.
There was no jubilation, just relief, in this for
mer fur-trading town, the oldest community in
North Dakota. The people of Pembina fought off
the Red by bolstering the dike encircling their com
munity on the Canadian border, keeping it dry for
its 200 th birthday year.
"I wouldn't call it a victory. I wouldn't know
what you would call it. We lost some and we won
some. The town itself, I think we won," said Tim

Wilwand, 38, a farmer and store owner who helped
save the community that is the hub for 640 people.
His farm was under water.
"This is something else," said James Moris, 66, a
farmer whose family has been in the area since 1879.
Indeed, the town was an island in the middle of a
lake, its water whipped into white caps by the wind.
And there, overseeing things, was the Coast Guard,
amid the greatest stretch of plains in America.
"It's really weird," said Seaman Eddie Terre
bonne. "It's something you don't expect to see in
North Dakota."
The water was expected to take weeks to recede,
but now the heaviest flow was on its way to its ter
minus at Lake Winnipeg, about 60 miles away.
"I just pray to God that what happened to Grand
Forks doesn't happen to anybody in Canada,"
Fagerholt said.
The crest was expected to reach the city of Win
nipeg this weekend and take maybe two days to
pass. The city's floodway was expected to protect
Winnipeg's 660,000 people, but 17,000 others have
been evacuated from small towns to the south.

Mass. politics sees busy week
BOSTON (AP) — A week of tumult has re
shaped the Massachusetts political landscape,
throwing next year's campaign for governor wide
open and once again spotlighting the Kennedy men
and their relationship with women.
In less than seven days:
• Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy 11, the front-runner
among the potential candidates for governor next
year, watched his ex-wife kick off a nationwide tour
promoting a book in which she attacks his effort to
annul their marriage.
• Michael Kennedy, another son of Robert F.
Kennedy, was confronted with allegations he had an
affair with his family's teen-age baby sitter. He is 39.
• Gov. William F. Weld, a moderate Republican,
said he plans to step down to join the Clinton
administration as U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
• Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., emboldened by his re
election victory over Weld last fall, took a baby step
toward becoming a presidential candidate in 2000.
"This is what makes Massachusetts politics so

interesting," said state House Speaker Thomas
Finneran. "You never know what's going to happen."
After all, this is a place where James Michael
Curley once served as mayor of Boston while in jail.
As has been the case since John F. Kennedy's
rapid rise to the presidency 36 years ago, the
Kennedy family is at the center of the turmoil.
Joseph Kennedy, the eldest son of Robert F.
Kennedy, saw his poll numbers dip jus his ex-wife,
Sheila Rauch Kennedy, began publicizing her book.
Not only does she complain about how Kennedy
notified her of his plans to seek an annulment (the
Archdiocese of Boston did so while the congressman
was on a Caribbean vacation with his new girlfriend),
but she also says granting it would be hypocritical
afler their nine-year courtship and 12-year marriage.
Of course, the Kennedy men have always faced
political fallout from their relationships with vari
ous women. That happened most notably when
Sen. Edward M Kennedy's presidential aspira
tions were dashed after Mary Jo Kopechne
drowned in a car Kennedy had driven off a bridge
on Chappaquiddick Island, Mass.
