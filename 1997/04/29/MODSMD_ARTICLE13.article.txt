# Ruling will shield localities from some civil rights suits
## Supreme Court also says tobacco billboards can be banned 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court made local govern
ments less vulnerable to civil rights
lawsuits yesterday as it voted 5-4 to
throw out the $818,000 won by an
Oklahoma woman severely injured
by a sheriffs deputy.
The court ruled that Bryan
County, Okla., wrongly was held
liable fora 1991 incident in which
Jill Brown was thrown to the
ground with such force that she
has had four operations and ulti
mately will require total knee
replacements.
Brown sued under a much
used federal law, and a jury found
that reserve deputy Stacy Burns
used excessive force. The county
was punished because Burns'
uncle, Sheriff B.J. Moore, hired
him despite a long record of mis
demeanor convictions.
The nation's highest court set
aside that jury verdict as Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote:
"Congress did not intend munici
palities to be held liable unless
deliberate action attributable to
the municipality directly caused a
deprivation of federal rights."
She said the county "is not
liable for Sheriff Moore's isolated
decision to hire Burns without
adequate screening, because
(there's no proof of) a conscious
disregard fora high risk that
Burns would use excessive force."
The court's dissenters said the
decision waters down a line of
decisions, dating back to 1978,
that open local governments to
civil rights lawsuits when individ
uals' rights are violated.
The ruling could have a big
impact. New York City officials
had told the justices that between
1993 and 1995 the city had to pay
$18 million to people who filed civil
rights lawsuits over the conduct of

police officers and prison guards.
"This is a real victory for load
governments and for taxpayers,"
said Richard Samp of the conserva
tive Washington Legal Foundation.
But Rocio Cordoba of the NOW
Legal Defense Fund said the rul
ing "raises concerns because it
could insulate municipalities that
violate civil rights."
In other matters yesterday, the
court:
• Left intact Baltimore's prohi
bitions on billboard ads for
cigarettes and alcoholic beverages
despite arguments that the bans
violate free-speech rights.
Although not a ruling, the action
was good news for President Clin
ton's proposed crackdown on
tobacco advertising.
• Ruled in a Minnesota case
that states can bar political candi
dates from appearing under more
than one party banner on ballots.
• Said police armed with court
warrants to search for drugs can
not always enter homes without
knocking and announcing them
selves. The decision in a Wiscon
sin case said police must knock
unless they can show they rea
sonably believe a suspect would
be dangerous or destroy evidence
if alerted.
In the excessive-force case,
Brown and her husband, Todd,
were returning to their Bryan
County home in the early hours of
May 12, 1991, when they noticed
a police checkpoint ahead of them.
Todd Brown, who was driving,
decided to avoid the checkpoint
and headed back to Texas.
Although county officials and
the Browns gave differing accounts
of what happened next, the
Browns' truck was pursued and
stopped by Bryan County deputies
about four miles from the check

point in Grayson County, Texas.
They were ordered out of their
truck at gunpoint by deputy
Robert Morrison. Burns, who was
unarmed, pulled Mrs. Brown
from the passenger seat and
threw her to the ground.
Police reportedly found a loaded
rifle and . J.vrer in the truck's cab,
but Mrs. Brown never was charged
in connection with the incident.
In discounting the county's
financial liability for Burns' hir
ing, O'Connor said the necessary
"deliberate indifference" can be
found "only where adequate
scrutiny of an applicant's back
ground would lead a reasonable
policy-maker to conclude that
the plainly obvious consequence
of the decision to hire the appli
cant would be the deprivation of
a third party's federally protect
ed right."
She was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Jus
tices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer
dissented.
Souter accused the court of
creating a new standard that
"does raise the threshold of
municipal liability."
The court in 1978 ruled for the
first time that a local government
as opposed to local officials —
can be liable for violating a per
son's constitutional rights.
Municipal liability exists, the
court said then, only if the injury
flows from an official policy or
practice.
In a 1980 ruling, the court said
a "policy" can be established by a
single decision if it is made by a
policy-maker on a matter within
the scope of his or her position.
