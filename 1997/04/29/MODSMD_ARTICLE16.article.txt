When it comes to recent
hate crimes on campus,
people must give a damn

YOU PROBABLY SAW the
rally in White Plaza yesterday
to protest hate crimes and
discrimination. And you probably
read about the graffiti in The Bol
lard eating club that called for gays
to kill themselves. You probably
heard about the animal feces that
was smeared on the five T-shirts
made for Rape Awareness Week and
designed as symbols of the pain felt
by survivors of sexual assault.
But you probably didn't do any
thing about it.
You probably were taken back,
stopped fora moment on your day's
journey and then carried on. After
all, there are many important
things to do: go to classes, run
around Campus Drive, save foreign
lands from environmentally inept
despots. Even if the acts of vandal
ism did enter into that vast expanse
known as the soul of the Stanford
student, they seem not to have
stayed there for long.
While some small groups have
protested these moral vulgarities,
the majority of the Stanford com
munity has been conspicuously
silent on this issue. Apathy is as
common to Stanford as sunshine,
but the recent lack of outrage has
been frighteningly appalling.
It has been about two weeks
since these most recent hate crimes
touched our campus, and their
effects seem to have already dissi
pated. Granted, a barrage of e-mail
has flown over computers express
ing students' sadness and anger
over these events. There was a dis
cussion of the T-shirts' desecration
at the conclusion of the Take Back
the Night march, an annual event
created to help empower victims of
sexualized violence and continued
effort by the Coalition Against Sex
ual Assault to improve campus

awareness. And of course, there
was yesterday's rally.
But all of these responses have
stayed mainly within the confines
of the groups that were most direct
ly affected — the Women's Center
and the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center — and this is
where the problem lies.
Why all of Stanford is not
enraged at these crimes of insensi
tivity and weakness is not consis
tent with its fascination with oh-so
important issues. A coalition can be
assembled to protest college rank
ings and a hullabaloo can be raised
over a student government election,
but when the integrity and respect
of students with whom we live and
attend classes is insulted, there is
little to no response. (The Daily has
received countless letters regarding
the ASSU election; there have been
two regarding the hate crimes.)
It is always hoped that unpleas
ant events will encourage decisive
action, but this does not seem to be
the case. The student who
scrawled the eating club vandalism
did come forward of his own accord
— an act of courage after a night of
drunken cowardice — but the T
shirt vandals are still unknown. No
one has come forward with any
leads or information. Obviously no
one has thought enough about
those who were hurt in this matter
to leave the comfort of their own
rooms and say something.
The solution to such a problem
will not lie in the University's
hands. Residential Education will
have its programs and its speakers,
but an entire army of informed res
ident assistants will not be able to
push the hearts of disinterested stu
dents into the most relevant issues.
So you will not be able to rely on
anyone but yourselves to increase
campus awareness and ensure that
hate crimes cease. You will have to
retreat from your holes of self
interest if you still believe that a
campus community can exist with
out fear and attacks in the night.
That's assuming you still want
that. That's assuming you care.
