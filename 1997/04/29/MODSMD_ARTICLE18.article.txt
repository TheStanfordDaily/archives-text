## An ode to your mother 
### 
"Your mom is so fat. (How fat is she?) We
crawled up on her back to get some burg
ers from Wendy's / And her skates went
flat /1 got stuck in her butt crack / They
thought I was lost, but 1 was caught in
the G-strap."
â€” The Pharcyde, "Ya Mama"
LET'S TALK ABOUT your mom.
Mom jokes come from many parts
of society. They are as rampant in
popular media as they are in junior high
boys' locker rooms. My roommate Zanja
is a secular Jew, his name means "irriga
tion ditch" in Spanish, and he is on his
way to getting a doctorate in the philoso
phy of physics. He too understands the
intelligence and poignancy of mom
humor. He can get as raunchy as anyone,
but my favorite of his mom insights goes
something like: "Your mom knows all
about bra vectors in dual space."
There is even a history, or an etymolo
gy, if you will, to mother humor. Anthro
pologists say that mom jokes first struck
a chord sometime around the Nean
derthal / Cro-Magnon transition period,
when it suddenly became taboo for early
man to sleep with his own mother.
Are you laughing? Maybe not. After
all, in these days of rampant misogyny
and the objectification of women, why
should jokes like this be funny? Should
pop culture, my drawmates and I be
branded assholes for finding mirth in the
verbal degradation of each others'

maternal figures? Maybe.
I'll be the first to admit that I'd be
embarrassed if my mom heard me say
some of things I say about Zanja's mom,
and that if Zanja directed one of his gems
to my mom's face, I'd feel obligated to
kick his ass.
My foot would probably fall off if it
touched your mom's ass.
There are other reasons to suspect
that there might be a problem. Though
my male friends and I try to integrate
women into our circle of insults, they
usually throw a token barb and exit post
haste. I've tried to redirect the humor to
a different level, like taking shots at
Zanja's dad. But that doesn't work
either. For some reason, we're so very
focused on our mothers.
Your mom wishes Oedipus Rex was
your autobiography.
Freudian humor aside, I believe that
most of us have a unique connection
with our mothers. Whether that link
stems from the womb or the peanut but
ter sandwiches she made for me when I
had the chicken pox, I love my mother
more than I love anything else in this
world. I am a mama's boy.
Direct a mom joke at someone who is
estranged from his parents or who just
doesn't care about his mother, and you
will get silence or a shrug of the shoul
ders. Take a shot at someone who you
know who loves his mother, and after
the initial shock subsides, in my experi

ence, most likely you'll get laughter.
Mom jokes are at the vanguard of
vulgarity. They are such pathetic
attempts at humor that we can laugh at
their very creation. They depart so far
from the reality of our feelings that
they exist as a caricature.
When we laugh at a mom joke, like an
ethnic joke, we are mocking the people
who actually have the biases and igno
rance to believe that women are sex
objects or that WASPy whites are
supreme.
I will not tell you that words do not
matter. I will not say that humor never
contains an element of the truth. But by
telling mom jokes, perhaps I am testing
our security in our maternal relation
ships. I am saying that the idea of my
mother as being a pure sex object is a
farce. I am saying that judging her or any
one else by their physical characteristics is
shortsighted and stupid. I am saying that
the idea of my mom having any interest in
an intimate encounter with a pimply
faced repressed college boy is such a
departure from reality that it is laughable.
In fact, it's downright funny.

what he'll be giving your mom.
