# Club Sports keeps Stanford's athletics on top of Title IX
## 
### 
I AM WRITING in response to the arti
cle in Tuesday's Daily titled "Stanford
is high in Title IX rankings."
In that article, Stanford's Depart
ment of Athletics is duly praised for its
compliance with the 1972 federal law
mandating equal opportunities for men
and women in high school and college
athletics. Athletic Director Ted Leland is
quoted as saying, "We've been lucky
here and not had to cut at all to build
the women's programs." I think that
there is more to this success though
than luck. In particular, a thriving Club
Sports program has been invaluable in
Stanford's compliance with Title IX.
That this fact was not mentioned is
indicative of the Athletics Department's
actions as it has moved to turn general
use athletic facilities into specific varsity

venues. The department has shown a
general disregard for non-varsity athlet
ics. The purpose of this letter, then, is to
recognize the important role played by
Club Sports in Title IX compliance and
ask that the Athletics Department
acknowledge this support by providing
general-use fields to replace the ones
lost to development of varsity sports.
The largest sport in college athletics
is still football, and it is played only by
men. Because of this huge appropriation
to men with no female corollary in sight,
Title IX puts an athletic department in a
difficult position. Stanford's strong tra
dition in Club Sports has played a key
role in complying with the law. Since the
passage of Title IX, several club sports
have been upgraded to varsity. On the
women's side these include water polo,

lacrosse, synchronized swimming, soft
ball, sailing, crew, soccer and volleyball.
Club Sports provided the athletes, the
organization, the tradition. The Athlet
ics Department simply designated them
varsity and appropriated the funds con
sistent with this designation. Should the
Athletics Department need more repre
sentation from women, it can return to
the well and "bring up" rugby as well.
In light of the important role of club
sports to Stanford athletics, I find it very
ironic that as the Athletics Department
appropriates general-use fields, there is
no plan for replacement of this field space
for use by Club Sports, intramurals and
less formal uses by students, faculty and
staff. In 1984 there were 32 general-use
fields (100 yards by 40 yards) on the
Stanford campus. Next fall there will be

six. Leland should realize there was more
to Title IX compliance than luck.
The strong Club Sports program at
Stanford has allowed the Athletics
Department to stand out in the Title IX
rankings. The current field-space crisis
is a slap in the face to club and intramu
ral athletics that have supported the
athletic department from below for the
past 25 years. I urge the Athletics
Department to put into action a plan to
restore general-use field space to campus
by the fall so that Stanford's strong tra
dition in club sports and intramurals
can be maintained.
