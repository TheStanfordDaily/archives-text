# No wait on the Web
## Business alums put dining delivery service online 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
For busy people tired of long lines and
the hassles of fast food, two Graduate
School of Business alumni have an appe
tizing alternative.
World Wide Waiter, a World Wide
Web-based take-out ordering system, de
buted in 1995 and has grown to include
the complete menus of more than 600
California restaurants.
Users of the system are able to select
their city or ZIP code and view the take
out and delivery options of a number of
local establishments, catalogued by type
of food and location.
Operation hours, maps and contact
information are included for those mere
ly browsing fora meal, and online order
ing capability is available for all restau
rants at no additional charge to the cus
tomer.
"We want to be the ATM of the food

world," said Craig Cohen, a 1994 graduate.
Hungry Web surfers can use pull
down menus and comment windows to
customize their dining options, which
are then available for pickup or delivery
— if offered by the restaurant — at the
time they request.
According to Cohen, the procedure
gives patrons the opportunity to provide
far more detailed instructions than they
could over the phone.
Stanford area users can chose from
more than 100 restaurants within dri
ving distance, including Polio Rey in
Tresidder Union.
According to Francisco Sanchez, man
ager of the Tresidder Polio's, the Web
based system makes serving customers
much easier.
"They make it work for you," he said.
"When they print the order and tell you
how they like it, we can make it just the
way they like it."
Orders submitted via the online form,

he said, are immediately faxed to his
restaurant.
"I have probably 25 percent of my cus
tomers using that system," Sanchez said.
"Whenever they send it in, we have
their food ready for take out or delivery
when they want it,"he added.
Cohen and his partner, Michael Adel
berg, a 1993 graduate, intend to expand
the online system as long as technology
exists to support it.
"We're trying to follow where the In
ternet access is good — areas where the
people who are on the Internet are on the
Internet all the time, so it's convenient
for them to order," Cohen said.
Currently the service has centers in
Northern and Southern in California.
In addition, some participating
restaurants offer discounts of up to 10
percent to both Stanford students and
World Wide Waiter users.
