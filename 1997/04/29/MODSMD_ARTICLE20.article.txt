# Closeted students need more resources made available on campus
## 
### 
This letter is directed primarily to the
many closeted men and women on cam
pus but also to the campus community
at large — particularly to those adminis
trators with the power to make a differ
ence in establishing a carefully-selected,
full-time director for the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center.
My thanks and respect go out to the
organizers of yesterday's rally against
hate crime, as well as to all of t hose who
joined in the circle of unity. I was happy
to be one of the more than 300 people in
that circle, but 10 years ago when I was
a student, I would have passed it right

by, as many did yesterday.
Ten years ago, I was one of the hun
dreds of closeted gay and lesbian students
on this campus. I was an active, athletic,
popular guy who rushed Phi Delta Theta
and would have taken the bid if I hadn't
gotten a resident assistant position. I
would look at groups like the outspoken
one assembled in White Plaza yesterday
and think. "That's just not me."
I could not relate to a group "like
that" — even though they were bravely
standing up for my rights. Instead my
thoughts were: "I am not an activist. I
don't want the world to know about my
sexuality. I do not consider myself
'queer.' I am not 'loud and proud.' " To
these people, I now apologize for my
hang-ups and shortsightedness.
Today, I am a well-adjusted,
immensely happier individual with no
cancer eating away at my psyche. My

preconceptions of what it does and
doesn't necessarily mean to be gay are
gone. However, I do not have this cam
pus to thank for that. I did not feel that
there was a sensitive, welcoming
resource for "someone like me," and I
don't see that this has changed.
Behind the secure anonymity of e
mail, I have had dozens of closeted cur
rent students and just-out young alums
(notably, almost all of them fraternity
brothers) talk to me about their sexual
confusion and frustration, and their
reactions have been virtually all the
same. "Who can I talk to? What can I
do?" Working for the Alumni Associa
tion, I have clearly seen that coming out
is something that tends to happen after
one leaves Stanford. And this is a
shame. No one should live a lie.
So I put it to you, the closeted men
and women of campus: What could be

done to make it easier for you to work
through your current feelings and be
yourself? Is there a forum or resource
you would welcome to privately discuss
your feelings? Please share your
thoughts with a confidential response.
And I put it to you, the campus com
munity: Confront homophobia, as well
as racism and sexism. Hate crimes are
the result of ignorance. What can you do
to help combat ignorance? Shouldn't
that be one of the goals of a great uni
versity? Please support the lobby fora
full-time director for the center.
My thanks and respect go out to all
who lead the fight against ignorance, and
my apologies to anyone I have inadver
tently offended by my choice of words.
