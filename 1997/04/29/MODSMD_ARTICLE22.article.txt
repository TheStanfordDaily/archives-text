## Corporate conglomeration or intellectual institution?

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, I think,
is having an identity crisis. Certainly
Gerhard Casper is having one. In
fact, both may be having many identity
crises, but the one that's most obvious has
been caused by differing conceptions of
what the University should be.
Stanford is an academic institution, a
place that should thrive on the free flow of
ideas and the most daring social theories
of the day. Stanford is also a multi-billion
dollar private corporation, a place that
strives to increase its revenues and attract
a larger and higher-paying customer base
to shop at its mall, work on its leased prop
erties and be treated in its hospital.
Gerhard Casper is the president of a
leading university, overseeing depart
ments and schools that are on the cutting
edge of research and education, regularly
breaking new ground and providing the
analysis that helps our society grapple
with the implications of many of those
breakthroughs. Gerhard Casper is also the
president of an organization that runs
extensive income-generating operations
and that annually raises nearly $100 mil
lion in non-capital donations.
The University as educational institu
tion should be encouraging the various
people associated with it to openly and
frankly discuss the pressing issues of the
day. The University as corporation, for

fear of losing income, should be discourag
ing internal quibbles and objectionable
statements. Casper as academic leader
should use his bully pulpit to speak out on
the important issues of national concern;
Casper as chief fund-raiser must keep his
views to himself lest he repel donors.
It's an impressive identity crisis, really.
I'd love to have a University presi
dent who felt free to comment loudly
and authoritatively pressing national
issues. It's a grand tradition — running
from Woodrow Wilson, who took on all
comers as Princeton's president through
James B. Conant, who as Harvard's
president instructed the world on the
role of science, and to even Donald
Kennedy, Casper's "provocative and
outspoken" predecessor, according to
The New York Times.
It would be wonderful to have a presi
dent who could lend his influence to a
slew of political concerns — whether
investment in Burma is acceptable,
whether the Clinton administration's
coddling of China is defensible, whether
the recent welfare reform was moral. In
fact, though I'd disagree vociferously, it'd
be refreshing even to have a president
who told us that Burmese tyranny, Chi
nese repression and welfare's reform are
good. At least he'd be taking a stand.
But I also realize that it would be

impossible for Stanford's president to
do so. He's simply got too many other
constituencies applying pressure on him
to allow him the ability to take a stand
on just about anything. He can't be a
publicly musing intellectual; he's
required to be a CEO.
Thus you end up with university pres
idents who sound no different than a
Fortune 500 businessmen. George Rupp,
for example, the president of Columbia
University — referred to by some faculty
members on the Manhattan campus as
"The Invisible Man" — is often known to
speak in newspeak befitting a downsiz
ing executive. Asked in an interview
about his plans to merge Columbia's eco
nomics department with its business
school, he reproached the reporter for
using the term "consolidate."
"Collaboration is the metaphor, not
consolidate," he corrected. "Or I would
call it enhancement — putting a positive
spin on it."
Vartan Gregorian, Brown University's
president, acknowledged to The Times
that a university president is so perpetual
ly seeking donations that he simply cannot
afford to offend anyone. "It's not natural
for me, but I must speak with tact and
diplomacy," he said.
Casper flatly refuses to speak on issues
that do not directly affect Stanford. "I

feel I must speak out on issues that con
cern the University," he has said, "but I
was not appointed to speak out on a
whole range of social issues because when
I do there will be those who disagree."
And those who disagree will be those who
don't give money.
The big question, then, is whether
this identity crisis can be resolved and, if
so, how.
My suggestion: Acknowledge the corpo
rate nature of a modern university. In Wil
son's age and in Conant's, universities
were not the financial behemoths that
they now are. It's time to call a spade a
spade and structure Stanford accordingly.
For the sake of intellectual honesty, a
nonprofit holding corporation — Stanford
Inc. — should be created. Most of its vari
ous divisions — Stanford Management
Co., Stanford Medical Center, the Office of
Development — will all be revenue gener
ators. One of the divisions — Stanford
University — will be a cost center. The
profits of the other divisions will fund the
one money-losing operation.
It's essentially the system we have now,
but it will allow the University, free of the
constraints imposed by running the con
glomerate, to make some noise and take
some stands. It's true that the higher-ups
in Stanford Inc. will probably pay little
heed to the pleas — for investment

responsibility, for student involvement in
the running of the corporation — made by
the folks over at Stanford University. But
at least the University won't be forced to
stifle legitimate, if unpopular concerns.
The University's identity crisis will not
be rectified, but at least it will be acknowl
edged and institutionalized. And Casper's
identity crisis will disappear. He can either
be the lacoccan president of Stanford Inc.
or he can be the Conantian president of
Stanford University. But he will no longer
have to try to be both.
Of course, as an activist friend pointed
out, if such a structure existed, one of the
best moves Stanford Inc. could make to
burnish its corporate image and differen
tiate itself from the other conglomerates
of the world would be to take the brilliant
PR step of calling the entire operation
Stanford University.
Which I guess you could argue is what's
already going on. Which I guess brings us
back to square one.

Jesse Oxfcld, a junior majoring in com
munication, wonders who really believed
that people like Marsh McCall would actu
ally follow Stanford Inc. 's Strategic Com
munications Plan.
