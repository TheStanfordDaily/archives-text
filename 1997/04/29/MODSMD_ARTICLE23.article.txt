## Runners shine at relays 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team had a busy weekend, with
some competing at the 103 rd
annual Penn Relays in Pennsyl
vania, while several others com
peted at the California / Nevada
State Championships in
Northridge, Calif.
The Penn Carnival is compa
rable to the recent Mt. SAC
relays in both competition and
sheer numbers of competitors
and spectators. The event was
held at Franklin Field located at
the University of Pennsylvania.
More than 800 high schools, 200
colleges and 50 post-college club
teams were represented.
Cardinal runners fared well
at the four-day event. Junior
Ryan McCalmon finished first in
the college men's 3,000-meter
steeplechase with a time of
8:58.00, which was fast enough
to qualify him for Pacific 10
championships. Junior J.J.
White finished 10th in the col
lege men's 5,000 meters, finish
ing with a time of 14:19.01.
Sophomore Nathan Nutter ran
the college men's 10,000 in
29:26.87, finishing sixth and
provisionally qualifying for
NCAAs.
The men's 4x1,500-meter
relay team finished third overall
with a time of 15:08.95, just
behind Arkansas and Michigan,
both of whom the Cardinal beat
at the Texas Relays earlier in the
season. Running for the Cardi
nal were freshmen Brad and
Brent Hauser, Michael Stember
and junior Jason Lunn. The
men's 4xBoo-meter relay team,
consisting of sophomore Jake
Maas, Stember, Lunn and White
finished 11th in 7:35.41.
The women's 4x1,500-meter
relay team ended up in fourth
with a time of 17:43.14. Running
for the Cardinal were juniors
Sara Moore, Monal Chokshi and
Sarna Renfro and sophomore
Mary Cobb. The distance medley
relay team consisting of Cobb,
Moore, Chokshi and senior Tyra
Holt finished 11th with a time of
11:31.59. Junior Heather Miller,
sophomore LaShawndra Pace
and freshmen Jayna Smith and
Cynthia Morman combined for
the 4x400-meter relay team,
