# Card takes on Cal Poly
## No. 3 sluggers look to maintain momentum 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
With less than three weeks
left in the regular season, Stan
ford baseball is in prime posi
tion to leap into postseason
play. Now, it's just a matter of
staying there. The next step for
the No. 3 Cardinal is to face Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, who
comes to Sunken Diamond
tonight at 7 p.m.
The No. 5 Cardinal (33-13,
17-7 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) boosted its
cause last weekend with a
sweep of California, blowing
out lackluster California (17-
34, 3-24) three games in a row.
The victories, coupled with two
UCLA losses at the hands of
crosstown rival USC, has the
Card sitting atop the Six-Pac
with a two-game buffer to pro
tect its lead. Only six confer
ence games remain.
Senior first baseman Luke
Quaccia, who finished the last
series with a pair of home runs,

beamed about an attack that
played inspired ball this week
end against Cal.
"We played really aggres
sively, no matter how badly we
were beating them," Quaccia
said. "We're really pleased
right now with the offense."
In part because of prolific
offensive support, few reliev
ers were needed in the series.
On Friday, junior starter Kyle
Peterson pitched eight
innings, leaving one for junior
reliever Josh Koons. That was
all the action the bullpen saw
for the whole weekend, as
sophomore Brent Hoard went
the distance Saturday at the
helm of an 8-0, four-hit
shutout, and sophomore Chad
Hutchinson followed suit with
a complete game in Sunday's
12-6 victory.
It all adds up to a bullpen
that should be fully rested and
ready for duty in the next two
crucial series, as well as tonight
against the Mustangs.
"I look forward to Tuesday

games," said sophomore center
fielder Jody Gerut after last
week's 9-3 pounding of non
league foe Sacramento State.
"The level of pressure is lower
than on the weekend, and it
lets you focus and work on spe
cific things."
Cal Poly (32-15, 11-13 Big
West Conference) is not a team
to scoff at despite being in
fourth place in the Big West.
The Matadors are 21-2 in non
conference games this year.
A veteran club with 14
seniors, the Mustangs have hit
their offensive stride with a
vengeance. The team is batting
a collective .343 and has
notched 87 home runs, a new
school record.
Senior Scott Kidel, Cal
Poly's premier offensive star,
has a chance to make history
Tuesday night. With 86 hits on
the season, he has tied a school
record. Kidel is also hatting a
whopping .422.
