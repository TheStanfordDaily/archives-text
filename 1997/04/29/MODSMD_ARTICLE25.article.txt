## 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
As expected, the Stanford bad
minton team returned from Davis
this weekend with the collegiate
national title. The squad won the
tournament very convincingly,
placing first in all five events.
Freshman Chris Hales and
senior Lily Chen won men's and
women's singles, respectively.
Hales and senior Jerry Wong
placed first in men's doubles, while
freshman Katie Maloney and Chen
finished first in women's doubles.
Maloney and Wong made up the
winning mixed doubles team.
Four Stanford players won two
medals each. However, as coach
Bill Pickthorn noted, all eight play
ers contributed to the win.
"It was a team effort that won us

the team trophy," Pickthorn said.
The Stanford squad amassed 33
points. The second-place team, Cal
ifornia, mustered a meager 12
points, as did third-place UC-Davis.
The most exciting part of the
tournament involved the mixed
doubles team, which had placed
third in its pool but then fought
back to win first place in the event.
In badminton, a match is won
by winning the best of three games.
Games are played to 15 points. The
only exception is women's singles,
which is played to 11 points.
Most schools at the tournament
were from California. Five schools
— Bryn Mawr, Albright, Swarth
more, College of Wooster and
Houston — were from out of state.
Despite its strong badminton
program, Stanford did not attend
nationals hist year. As a club sport,

the team did not have enough
funds to go to the Kast Coast. The
team was pleased with the nearby
location of this year's tourney.
Badminton's status as a non
varsity sport may not last for
long. The NCAA considers bad
minton one of nine emerging
sportsthat might be introduced so
schools can comply with Title IX.
California seems to be leading
the country in terms of making
badminton a varsity sport. Many
high schools in California field
teams. In fact, there arc; more high
school badminton players in Cali
fornia than in the other 49 states
combined, Pickthorn said. Ilellect
ing this widespread interest in the
sport, California community col
leges are starting varsity programs
in 1999. Some Division 111 teams
already have varsity programs.
