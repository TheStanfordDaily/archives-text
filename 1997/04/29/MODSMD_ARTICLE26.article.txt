## Riders climb with strong weekend 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Placing first in the hill-climb race
and second on the criterium, the Stan
ford cycling team gained solid ground
for the postseason in its last regular
season race this weekend.
While experienced riders led the
Cardinal in the hill-climb time trial
race, held on the Montebello course
Saturday, the rookie force showed off
its strong sprinting skills in the cri
terium, which took place Sunday in
Morgan Hill.
The Stanford squad, ranked third,
acquired 222 points in the hill-climb
and 200 points in the criterium, clos
ing in on No. 1 Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and No. 2 UC-Santa Barbara.
The total points gained for all regular

season races determine the field in the
postseason championships in two
weeks.
"We h?»d a great overall perfor
mance," said masters student Mike
Cummer, who placed first in the hill
climb and third in the criterium for
the men's B team category. "Hopeful
ly we'll maintain our energy and stay
pumped up."
Coach Art Walker said Cummer,
who took a risk by breaking off from
the pack and going in front in the cri
terium, greatly helped put the Card in
good spirits and in the lead for the
race.
"I wanted to have a good solid race
all the way through," Cummer said,
adding that he thinks he got lucky
with the breakaway.
"I thought it was still early enough

in the race that I could still recover
even if it didn't work out," he said.
While other experienced riders
such as graduate students Dario
Falquier and co-captain Peter
Armitage, both competing for the A
team, finished in third and seventh
places, respectively, and brought in
extra points for the Card, young riders
also boosted the squad with energetic
performances.
Freshman Will Parks and sopho
more Chris Hooyman, riding for the B
team, displayed strong long-term tac
tics, bringing in a combined 37 points
by taking third and eighth places,
respectively. Along with the 43 points
obtained in the A-team race by
Falquier and Armitage, the Card
placed itself at the top of the pack
for the event. Cal Poly placed a
distant second with 164 points,
while California trailed closely
behind with 161 points. UC-
Santa Barbara finished fifth with
80 points behind UC-Davis,
which acquired 131 points total
for the hill-climb.
In the criterium, the Gauchos
took first place with 243 points and
the Aggies placed third with 167.
Other new Stanford riders
who showed strong long-term
output included master's student
Marie Kirk, who improved her
personal record for the hill-climb
by more than five minutes. Kirk
placed second in both the criteri
um and the hill-climb for the
women's B team.
"She had outstanding and
exceptional races on both days,"
Walker said. "Most people who
have been training with much
diligence knocked off around a
minute" from their records.
Co-captain Cynthia Ferguson, a
medical student, also placed sec
ond in the women's A team for
both events behind California's
Teri Balser. Cathy Norbutas,
another medical student showing
strong power output and careful
race-planning skills, took third
place for the hill-climb race.
