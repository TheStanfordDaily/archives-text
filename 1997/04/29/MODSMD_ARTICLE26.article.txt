### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Placing first in the hill-climb race
and second on the criterium, the Stan
ford cycling team gained solid ground
for the postseason in its last regular
season race this weekend.
While experienced riders led the
Cardinal in the hill-climb time trial
race, held on the Montebello course
Saturday, the rookie force showed off
its strong sprinting skills in the cri
terium, which took place Sunday in
Morgan Hill.
The Stanford squad, ranked third,
acquired 222 points in the hill-climb
and 200 points in the criterium, clos

race.
"I wanted to have a good solid race
all the way through," Cummer said,
adding that he thinks he got lucky
with the breakaway.
"I thought it was still early enough

in the race that I could still recover
even if it didn't work out," he said.
While other experienced riders
such as graduate students Dario
Falquier and co-captain Peter
Armitage, both competing for the A
team, finished in third and seventh
places, respectively, and brought in
extra points for the Card, young riders
also boosted the squad with energetic
performances.
Freshman Will Parks and sopho
more Chris Hooyman, riding for the B
team, displayed strong long-term tac
tics, bringing in a combined 37 points
by taking third and eighth places,
respectively. Along with the 43 points
obtained in the A-team race by
Falquier and Armitage, the Card
