# Crew cuts through Hornets, ends home slate with wins
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend, the Cardinal closed its
home season, showing who was in control
of the waters of Redwood Shores with
many commanding wins against Sacra
mento State.
After last week's upsetting loss to Ore
gon State, the Stanford crews brought the
team back together and moved ahead of the
Hornets by several boatlengths of open
water.
The only Cardinal boats that did not win
this weekend were the women's novice A
eight-person boat and men's novice B four
person boat.
The men's varsity extended its record to
6-1 in Pacific 10 Conference dual-meet
competition with Saturday's win.
Junior Grant Cutting credits this week
end's victory to the speed coach, new
equipment that measures the boat's speed.
"Due to the addition of the speed coach,
we were able to concentrate on our own
race plans and not worry about what the
other boat was doing," Cutting said. "We

were able to get a steady race pace and
move on from there."
Cutting has been a valuable member for
the varsity boat in the past few weeks, pro
viding the fuel in the middle of the boat,
better known as the powerhouse.
Like their male counterparts, the
women rowed through Sac State, finishing
four boatlengths ahead to extend their Pac
-10 dual-meet record to 6-1.
"It was a successful race as a comeback
after a hard defeat to OSU," said junior
Anona Dutton. "And we are planning to
take what we learned in our defeat to OSU
as well as our win last weekend to help us
push through the next few weeks until
Pac-iOs."
On the novice side, both the women's B
and men's A eights were victorious, finish
ing with substantial distances between
their boats and Sac State's.
Despite an accident between the
women's boat and Hornets' boat during
the warmup that caused minor injuries to
four Cardinal rowers, Stanford plowed
through Sac State and did not
look back.
"We kept right on walking,"
said women's novice coach Kris
tine Franson, as she observed her
squad taking the lead and extend
ing it even further.
After being notified that the
race was a personal-best perfor
mance this season, junior Sarah
Lamanuzzi said, "It felt wonderful
to know that we've pulled every
thing together in the face of a
major setback and gave 120 per
cent."
Like the men's and women's
varsity, the men's novice A had its
race decided very early on, as the
Card finished four boatlengths
ahead of the Hornets and
improved its record to 6-1.
Freshman Ted Grantham is
hopeful for his team's future
showdowns due to the squad's
recent successes.
"Our times have been improv
ing with each race," Grantham
said. "And with our wins this
weekend, I am excited to see how
we match up with Cal in the Big
Row."
While the rest of the team was
taking their one day of the week
off, the novice men quickly took a
plane down to Newport Beach
Sunday to participate in the 32nd

annual Newport Regatta against
six other schools, including con
ference rivals UC-Irvine and UC-
San Diego.
Host school Orange Coast Col
lege had taken the Marscellas
Cup, awarded to the winner of the
novice eight A race, for the past
four years and 11 out of 15 years
since the cup was first established
in 1981.
Stanford came out of the start
in third place and shifted gears to
move into first in the midpoint of
the race to earn its first Marscellas
Cup title and end the Pirates'
streak at four.
Orange Coast's novice head
coach Steve Morris was very
impressed at Stanford's come
from-behind win.
Orange Coast "rowed a very
tough race, but [Stanford's] rates
were very high — higher than we
ever rowed before," Morris said.
"Obviously we paid the price at
the end."
The Cardinal rowers shared
Morris' enthusiasm over the vic
tory.
"The guys raced great," said
freshman coxswain Dan Matross.
"It was a fun race to cox since the
guys pulled really hard and when
asked fora little more, they gave a
little more."
The Cardinal oar blades are
ready to cut through the waters of
rival territory as Stanford pre
pares to take on California in the
Big Row on Sunday.
