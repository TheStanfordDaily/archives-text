## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water polo
team gained momentum this weekend
for the upcoming national champi
onships, earning a hard-fought victory
over San Diego State fora third-place
finish at the West Regional Qualifier in
Berkeley this weekend.
"San Diego State was a great win com
ing off a loss to Cal," said sophomore
goalkeeper Heather Crary. "Finally
things just turned our way."
The Cardinal finished the weekend 4-
1 by winning each of its opening-round
games and the third-place game. The
only loss was against California in the
semifinals 6-4.
Stanford failed to advance to tin; finals
because of the loss to Cal. The Golden
Bears and the Card began the game by
trading goals. A second goal put Cal up
by one at the half, but shortly into the
third quarter sophomore Nicole Glazer

scored to even the game at 3-3.
After that it was all Cal as the Golden
Bears scored three unanswered goals
before the end of the third quarter. The
Card scored once more in the fourth to
bring the game to within two, but that
was as close as it would get.
"We did not accomplish our goals
against Cal. We know just what it's going
to take to do it," Crary said. "Wo just
have to play one more quarter. We have
the confidence."
Because of the loss, Stanford played in
the consolation final against San Diego
State, which had beaten the squad for
the first time all season just two weeks
earlier. The Card would have no more of
that and defeated the; Aztecs in a very
physical match 7-4. The closely fought
battle was tied at 4-4 midway through
the fourth quarter before Stanford came
alive and scored three times to open up
the game. Playing without Glazer, whose

ejection helped to spark the Car
dinal run, freshman Ellen
Estes, sophomore Lindsay
Welsh and senior co-captain
Alice Cathcart each contributed
a goal in the second-half run to
ensure the Cardinal victory.
"Right after Nicole majored
(was ejected) something clicked,
and we did not look back," said
Stanford head coach Ben Quit
tner.
"We won this game because
we were patient and gave a com
plete team effort."
The Cardinal began play Fri
day against UC-Santa Barbara.
What was supposed to be an
easy opening-round contest
proved a little closer than
expected for the majority of the
game.
Stanford managed only a 3-2
lead going into the fourth quar
ter, but from then on it was all
Cardinal as Stanford scored
three straight goals in the final
frame to put the game out of the
Gauchos' reach.
"In the first game we were
struggling a little bit," Quittner
said. "We seemed to have a little
bit of first-game jitters."
But the lapse did not last for
long, as the Card had its way
with the next two opening
round games. Stanford crushed
Oregon 27-3 with two freshmen,
Aloha Jamias and Lyndsey Dar
row, leading the offensive effort
with six and five goals, respec
tively. The Cardinal then shift
ed gears, defeating USC 4-2 in a
defensive battle. Stanford led
the entire game but could only
find the net four times in 30
tries.
The Cardinal is one of seven
West Coast teams that will
advance to the national champi
onships May 9-10 at Michigan,
where Stanford will be joined by
five other schools from the rest
of the country to round out the
12-team tournament.
