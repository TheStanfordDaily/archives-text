The Stanford women's water polo
team gained momentum this weekend
for the upcoming national champi
onships, earning a hard-fought victory
over San Diego State fora third-place
finish at the West Regional Qualifier in
Berkeley this weekend.
"San Diego State was a great win com
ing off a loss to Cal," said sophomore
goalkeeper Heather Crary. "Finally
things just turned our way."
The Cardinal finished the weekend 4-
1 by winning each of its opening-round
games and the third-place game. The
only loss was against California in the
semifinals 6-4.
Stanford failed to advance to tin; finals
because of the loss to Cal. The Golden
Bears and the Card began the game by
trading goals. A second goal put Cal up
by one at the half, but shortly into the
third quarter sophomore Nicole Glazer

scored to even the game at 3-3.
After that it was all Cal as the Golden
Bears scored three unanswered goals
before the end of the third quarter. The
Card scored once more in the fourth to
bring the game to within two, but that
was as close as it would get.
"We did not accomplish our goals
against Cal. We know just what it's going
to take to do it," Crary said. "Wo just
have to play one more quarter. We have
the confidence."
Because of the loss, Stanford played in
the consolation final against San Diego
State, which had beaten the squad for
the first time all season just two weeks
earlier. The Card would have no more of
that and defeated the; Aztecs in a very
physical match 7-4. The closely fought
battle was tied at 4-4 midway through
the fourth quarter before Stanford came
alive and scored three times to open up
the game. Playing without Glazer, whose
