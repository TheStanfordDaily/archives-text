Like many Stanford freshmen, Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta did not have his future career set in stone by the
time he was 18 years old. Unlike most students however,
Gupta had already completed an undergraduate degree and
was pursuing a master's.
At 38, Gupta, who is currently appealing the dean of hu
manities and sciences' decision to deny him tenure, can still
be mistaken fora graduate student, with his down-to-earth
demeanor and bike helmet in hand. He is an eternal student,
with a passion for learning and for teaching.
Gupta, who grew up in Jaipur, India, immigrated to the
United States in 1976 after finishing high school. He joined
his parents in Kalamazoo, Mich., to study mechanical engi
neering at Western Michigan University
Fortunately for Stanford, Gupta abandoned his "techie"
lifestyle in order to further explore technological issues in de
veloping countries, a subject he first began researching for his
undergraduate honors thesis on solar energy.
"There was a point when I said, 'I'm not doing engineering
for the rest of my life,' " Gupta said. "While I was at MIT, I
couldn't imagine waking up and saying 'Yes! I'm going to go
out and solve another differential equation.' "
Grateful that he took the time to find out what he was re
ally interested in, Gupta said he thinks anthropology is the
most open, congenial place to explore his interest in the prob
lems of poverty and technology.
After completing both his undergraduate and graduate de
grees in mechanical engineering, Gupta ventured west to
Stanford for further education. This time, his goal was an in
terdisciplinary degree in development studies.
Gupta, who spent a year living and researching in India,
wrote his dissertation on the technical change in agriculture
and the hybrid varieties of wheat in north India. It was at this
point that he was introduced to the anthropological way of re
search.
