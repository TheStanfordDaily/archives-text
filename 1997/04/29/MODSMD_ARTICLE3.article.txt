# Gupta mixes in yet stands out

Like many Stanford freshmen, Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta did not have his future career set in stone by the
time he was 18 years old. Unlike most students however,
Gupta had already completed an undergraduate degree and
was pursuing a master's.
At 38, Gupta, who is currently appealing the dean of hu
manities and sciences' decision to deny him tenure, can still
be mistaken fora graduate student, with his down-to-earth
demeanor and bike helmet in hand. He is an eternal student,
with a passion for learning and for teaching.
Gupta, who grew up in Jaipur, India, immigrated to the
United States in 1976 after finishing high school. He joined
his parents in Kalamazoo, Mich., to study mechanical engi
neering at Western Michigan University
Fortunately for Stanford, Gupta abandoned his "techie"
lifestyle in order to further explore technological issues in de
veloping countries, a subject he first began researching for his
undergraduate honors thesis on solar energy.
"There was a point when I said, 'I'm not doing engineering
for the rest of my life,' " Gupta said. "While I was at MIT, I
couldn't imagine waking up and saying 'Yes! I'm going to go
out and solve another differential equation.' "
Grateful that he took the time to find out what he was re
ally interested in, Gupta said he thinks anthropology is the
most open, congenial place to explore his interest in the prob
lems of poverty and technology.
After completing both his undergraduate and graduate de
grees in mechanical engineering, Gupta ventured west to
Stanford for further education. This time, his goal was an in
terdisciplinary degree in development studies.
Gupta, who spent a year living and researching in India,
wrote his dissertation on the technical change in agriculture
and the hybrid varieties of wheat in north India. It was at this
point that he was introduced to the anthropological way of re
search.

Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta said he was drawn to Stan
ford because of its high quality of students.
"I spent a lot of my time doing
a very detailed survey of agricul
tural production and economic
data," Gupta said. "But the
terms, categories and concepts I
used in my survey didn't have
much relation to the lives of the
people I was surveying."
For example, when Gupta
asked the farmers how much fer
tilizer they were using, they re
sponded that it didn't matter.
"They used a completely different
conceptual apparatus. Culture is
important in thinking about pub
lic policy and technology," Gupta
said.
"I didn't have a social science
degree, but by then the bug had
hit," he said of his interest in an
thropology.
While obtaining his doctorate
from Stanford in engineering
economic systems, Gupta said he
was attracted to anthropology be
cause the field asks questions
about culture and power and"it
pays attention to the poor."
"Growing up in India, I never
imagined that I would end up
teaching anthropology," Gupta
said. "Frankly, I didn't even know
what anthropology was until I
came to Stanford to do my Ph.D."
After graduating from Stan
ford in 1987, Gupta taught South
Asian studies and international
studies at the University of Wash
ington. Two years later, he re
turned to the Farm to join the An
thropology Department.
"It's important for me to re
late the conditions of poor peo
ple," Gupta said. "I became con
vinced I wanted to teach once I
was here working on my Ph.D.
And I also wanted to be in a pro
fession where I can do my own re
search."
Gupta said he was drawn to

Stanford because of its high qual
ity of students. "Teaching here is
never a chore, and I have an excel
lent set of colleagues who are in
terested in similar issues," he
said. "It's been a really rewarding
experience so far."
Having Gupta as a professor
has been rewarding for his stu
dents as well. "He is an amazing
professor. He's always willing to
take out time to work with his
students," said senior Nisha
Varia, one of Gupta's advisees.
"He is very supportive of his stu
dents. As a teacher, he helps us
think, to question and to ana
lyze."
Varia, a Fulbright scholar, will
spend the next year in India,
where she will study income gen
eration and women's organiza
tions. "I feel really fortunate to
have had the opportunity to work
with him. He's phenomenal."
The decision on Gupta's
tenure is expected to be an
nounced by May 1.
"It's important to have
[Gupta] here as a resource in
order for second generation
[South Asians] to learn about our
past," said junior Aly Remtulla,
who is active in Undergraduates
for the Tenure of Akhil Gupta.
Remtulla did research for Gupta
last summer on Gupta's book on
post-colonial developments in
India.
Gupta is completing three
books that are in press. When he
is not working, he enjoys explor
ing different San Francisco neigh
borhoods with his wife, Purnima
Mankekar, who also teaches in
the Anthropology Department.
The couple met as graduate stu
dents at Stanford and married in
1984 while Gupta was doing field
work in India. Both put long in
hours in the Anthropology De
partment.
"We're two assistant profes
sors. We don't have time for
kids," he joked.
