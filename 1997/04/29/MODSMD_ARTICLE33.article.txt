# Lacrosse loss to Bears ends Final Four hopes
## 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
Women's lacrosse came out even this
weekend, first winning against UC-Santa
Cruz 16-1 before losing to California 10-4.
The game in the Western Women's
Lacrosse League playoffs against Cal was
the last of the season as the defeat pre
vented Stanford from advancing to Final
Four.
In the first game, the third-seeded Car
dinal's win against the sixth-seeded
Banana Slugs was quick and decisive. The
team started out aggressively and main
tained this level of play throughout the
match, keeping Santa Cruz under con
stant pressure. This effort and critical
team intensity allowed Stanford to cruise
ahead relatively early.
Much of the team's success was due to
the outstanding offensive play of fresh
man Hedy Born, junior captain Alexis
Patrizio and sophomore Carey Jones.
Born and Jones dazzled the field with five
goals each, while Patrizio aided in the
attack with two goals and three assists.
The team left UC-Santa Cruz reeling,
notching 10 goals to the Banana Slugs'
one after the first half. On defense, senior
goalkeeper Susan Fan shined with seven
saves.
The game against Cal's second-seeded
Golden Bears proved to be far more physi
cally and mentally challenging. The con
test was actually a rematch of last week
end's Stanford-Berkeley battle, which the
Cardinal lost. The Stanford players knew

they had to raise the intensity of this game
as well as meet the physical challenge of
keeping up with Cal.
"We were unable to surmount the chal
lenge, and we lost," Patrizio said. "The
score of the game doesn't really indicate
how close it was, though.
"We played better against them today
than we did last weekend, maintaining
better control of the ball."
Because of the Golden Bears' speed,
Stanford's defensive strategy was critical.
Jones and fellow freshmen Janet Lewis and
Andrea Suh provided the much-needed
speed, successfully matching up with Cal's
fastest players. Freshman Gabby Duno also
yielded a superior performance, posing a
major threat all over the field.
Due to Stanford's slow start in the
game, the Cardinal failed to score until
relatively late, with goals by Lewis,
Patrizio and freshman Merete Rietveld.
Once again, Fan played a solid game in
goal, racking up 12 saves and keeping it as
close as it was. However, the sheer volume
of shots was overwhelming, as the Bears
converted 10 to post a double-digit offen
sive output.
Overall, Stanford had a surprisingly
good season, considering the youth of the
team. Because it is comprised of 13 fresh
men, future prospects look good. Although
many players were disappointed that the
team just missed its goal of the Final
Four, the squad remains optimistic about
its future.
"We can basically pick up from where
we left off and go forward," Jones said.
