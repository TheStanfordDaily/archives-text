# MUN hosts conference
## Old tradition brings area high schoolers 
### Jennifer Wang Contributing writer 
Rebuilt last year by o group of students
dedicated to promoting knowledge of inter
national affairs, Stanford Model United Na
tions revive*! the annual tradition of hosting
high school simulations this weekend.
Security General Itafael Nendel-Flores
was responsible for planning and organizing
the event."It was really successful for what
we wanted to do," Nendel-Flores said.
" I Jopefully, it wiII be a stepping stone U) hav
ing a bigger one next year."
Alvin Adams, former ambassador and
president of the UN Association of the Unit
ed States, gave the keynote speech Friday af
ternoon. Adams served in the foreign service
for 25 years. As ambassador to Haiti, he
made significant contributions to human
rights and to the first free, democratic elec

tions if l the country's history. Adams re
ceived the; State Department's Award for
Valor in 1992 for saving the life of the 1 lait
ian president while sustaining a gunshot
wound himself.
The conference, which divides up dele
gates from each school to represent two to
three countries, is designed to simulate the
workings of the actual international peace
keeping force. Students work together to
form resolutions, always keeping in mind
the unique situation of the country they rep
resent.
Committees included the security coun
cil, international security, economics and fi
nance, and social, humanitarian and cultur
al issues.
Nendel-Flores said he was pleased with
the level of debate and dedication of the stu-
dents, saying "they clearly did a lot
of research on their countries."
Six out of the eight registered
high schools showed up, most from
Southern California. About 120
students attended the conference,
a relatively small number com
pared to the larger simulations
held at UC-Irvine and Harvard
University.

With only two chairs heading
each of the four committees, a head
coordinator overseeing the process
and technical coordinator respon
sible for setting up Internet access
for research during the delibera
tions, Nendel-Flores had less man
power than most other well-estab
lished clubs for coordinating the
details of the large project. "This
was why we felt that starting out
on a small scale would be wiser," he
said.
In addition to hosting high
school groups, the Stanford Model

United Nations club also attends
college simulations. On the nation
al level, students have traveled to
Harvard, and on the international
level, they have flown all the way to
Budapest, Hungary, to represent
Stanford.
After returning to campus after
a long hiatus, the club currently
has about 300 members and is con
tinuing to grow. Its organizers
hope to take advantage of the pub
licity of the successful conference
to begin a series of other events.
In addition to trips to local

schools to promote awareness of
international issues and help set
up high school Model United Na
tions clubs, the club would like to
host panel discussions involving
professors and students and bring
speakers onto campus. Also in its
plans are coordinating a debate
with the Berkeley Model United
Nations.
Club president Sanu
Puthankatil is optimistic about the
future of the club and regards the
high school conference a good
start.
