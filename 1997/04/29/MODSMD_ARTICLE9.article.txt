FOR THE RECORD...
An editorial in yesterday's Daily incorrectly stated than 10 of 11
groups requesting a special fee last year lost because of low voter
turnout among graduate students. In fact, that affected nine of 11
losing groups.
An article in last Tuesday's Daily incorrectly stated that the
Faculty Senate had passed a resolution objecting to changing aca
demic programs without student input. The ASSU Senate, not the
Faculty Senate, passed that resolution.
Information in the April 18 Daily incorrectly stated that the sec
ond half of the Stanford Climbing Wall special-fee request was re
jected by 57.3 percent of the student body. It was rejected by 55.3
percent of students.
