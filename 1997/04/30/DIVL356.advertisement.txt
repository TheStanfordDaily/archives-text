the
Ethics
in Society
Program
The Ethics in Society Program encourages students to reflect on fundamental
issues of moral and political philosophy. Such issues include: the nature
and implications of treating people with equal dignity and respect; the scope of
liberty; the legitimacy of government; and the meaning of responsibility. The
program poses these issues, and others, in the context of debates which have
arisen in our common public life. Students write honors theses on topics which
use moral and political philosophy to address practical problems. Previous
theses have considered such questions as the just distribution of health care, our
obligations to future generations, the role of moral values in education, the
moral implications of genetic engineering, and the relationship between gender
inequality and the structures of work and family. Many of our students have
won scholarships to graduate study including Marshall, Rhodes and Fulbright
Fellowships. Others have taken the step from moral analysis to moral
commitment, pursuing careers of public service

Satz, or visit the Program Office located in Building 90, Room 91C.
