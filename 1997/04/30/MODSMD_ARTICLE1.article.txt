# Anger sparked by Sawislak's tenure denial
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
A group of students is planning protest action
against the denial of tenure to Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak.
Citing Sawislak's excellence in teaching and schol
arship, as well as the University's controversial record
of tenure for women, the group is focusing on publiciz
ing the issues through writing letters and researching
faculty promotion trends.
Sawislak "is such a strong candidate, that anyone
familiar with her scholarship would find it unimagin
able that she would be turned down for tenure," said
doctoral student Sarah Stein, adding that more than
50 students have joined the group because Sawislak is
also an "excellent teacher and adviser."
Although the History Department voted almost
unanimously — one person abstained — to promote
Sawislak to tenure, the deans of the School of Human
ities and Sciences declined to approve the depart
ment's decision. In addition to his or her department,
a candidate must win support from the deans, the
provost and an advisory board in order to complete the
tenure process successfully.
According to Chuck Carlson, a doctoral student and
one of the group's organizers, consensus among facul
ty is so difficult to achieve that the deans' approval
should have been "a rubber stamp."
Carlson also noted that junior facultj' members have
to balance a disproportionate share of teaching and ad
vising with "superstar" expectations of the deans, who
"expect the first published work of a tenure candidate
to revolutionize his or her field," Carlson said.
The deans are in the process of officially notifying
Sawislak of their decision, said Jane Hawthorne, staff
associate for faculty affairs at the School of Humani
ties and Sciences. Sawislak would then be able to re
quest a summary of her tenure file and file a grievance
based on procedural errors.
"If Sawislak believes that improper criteria or im
proper procedures were used," she may appeal to Dean
of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven, said Senior
Assoc. Provost for Faculty Affairs Kathryn Gillam.
Some students currently involved in protesting the
recent denial of tenure to Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta attended the meeting and warned about
possible delays in acquiring the file. It took several
months to receive Gupta's file, they said, and a similar
pause in Sawislak's case could stall it until the sum
mer.
Overall, the group stressed the importance of cross
ing department boundaries to express a broad disap
proval of the deans' actions. Efforts were also made to
maintain a graduate-undergraduate coalition in rais
ing awareness of Sawislak's tenure status.
Carlson urged students to articulate their personal
frustrations with the deans' position through letters
addressed to University administration. The group is
coordinating outreach to local and campus media. In
addition, it will organize a fact-finding committee to
study the University's history of tenuring women and
faculty who are involved in research that is at odds
with academic tradition.
Students at the meeting cited a
statistic that was included in the
report of the Provost's Committee
on the Recruitment and Retention

of Women Faculty in 1993, which
placed Stanford third from the bot
tom in percentage of women facul
ty, above only MIT and Caltech.
However, Provost Condoleezza
Rice told the Faculty Senate on
March 6 that she has found "no
gender effect" in the tenure
process.
The student group contacted

Rice last week to set up a meeting.
Because a grievance process by
Sawislak would have to begin with
Shoven, Rice answered that such a
meeting may not be appropriate at
this time.
Shoven's office has referred the
student's request for a meeting to
John Etchemendy, associate dean
for humanities.
