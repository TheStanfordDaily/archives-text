Development officer leaves
University — and student
groups — in better shape

IT WAS ANNOUNCED last
week that Stephen Peeps, asso
ciate vice president for develop
ment, will leave the University in
May to take on the top job at the
Lucile Salter Packard Foundation
for Children. Peeps' move is a good
one for him personally, but his gain
is the University's loss. Since being
appointed to his current position in
1991, Peeps has overseen some
major changes in the Office of
Development that have had positive
repercussions both for the Universi
ty and for students.
In 1994 the Office of Develop
ment did a survey of undergraduate
alumni to determine why they felt
little or no connection to the Uni
versity after graduation. As the for
mer executive director of Stanford's
Centennial Operating Committee,
Peeps was well qualified to lead an
effort to increase alumni's feeling of
involvement with the University,
and the results have paid off.
Last year, Stanford raised more
than $313 million in donations,
breaking the school's gift record for
the third consecutive year. It was
also more money that any other
university amassed in that year; we
even edged out Harvard's $311.5 in

contributions. More important,
though, the portion of Stanford
alumni now making annual dona
tions to the University stands at 34
percent — 42 percent more alumni
than gave annually in 1992.
The instrument for soliciting
those annual gifts is the Stanford
Fund, the success of which points to
an important opportunity for stu
dent groups that arose from the
Development Office two years ago.
Before that time, the Stanford
Fund did not exist. After a new
fund-raising plan was announced in
November 1994, Peeps worked with
the group of ASSU leaders and Stu
dent Affairs administrators that
ultimately devised the plan under
which student organizations receive
money from the Development
Office in exchange for members
doing work like writing thank-you
notes to gift-giving alumni.
In an ideal world, the University
would make money available to any
student group that it. But ours is
not a perfect world, and while stu
dents must provide whatever effort
the Development Office requires in
order to raise money for their
groups, the policy has given groups
a more-or-less guaranteed method
of receiving funding.
The Office of Development has
accomplished a great deal in the last
few years. And while everyone who
works in that department deserves
credit for its achievements, as Peeps
departs we must note his contribu
tions and wish him well.
