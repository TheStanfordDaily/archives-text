THAT WAYWARD fraterni
ties are sometimes placed on
social probation in atone
ment for their sins is a practice not
new to Stanford in the 19905.
This week in 1955, the now
defunct Alpha Delta Phi fraternity
was given social probation, result

ing in the cancellation of all frater
nity parties, dances and overnights
planned for the rest of the year.
As part of their punishment,
each Alpha Delt had to complete
16 hours of public service to the
University.
The crime: a water fight.
