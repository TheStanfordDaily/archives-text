Housing is not as accessible as you might think

I AM WRITING in response to Rodger
Whitney's letter printed in Friday's
Daily concerning disability access to
housing. While it is evident that Hous
ing and Dining Services is working to
make the housing facilities more accessi
ble, the fact remains that many dorms
on campus are not very accessible at all.
Currently, many dorms are accessi
ble, as Whitney said, but only for
"ground-floor" access. Other dorms are
completely inaccessible. Roble, for
instance, is a hopeless case for anyone in
a wheelchair or anyone who is blind.
While a ramp leads up to the door, it is
almost always blocked by bikes. Once in
the door, a wheelchair user is confined
to the dining hall, the lounge, one
restroom and the lower computer clus
ter. They cannot get to any dorm rooms,
the downstairs common room, the laun
dry room, the downstairs study and
music practice rooms or the computer
cluster with the laser printer in it. A
blind student faces different challenges

because Roble has no Braille signage.
Like many other dorms, all the signs are
painted above the doors.
But dormitories are not the only
source of concern. Some buildings in
the Quad have no elevators which
means that mobility-impaired students
cannot get to their professors' office
hours. Some lecture halls, like Braun
Auditorium, have no integrated seating.
In Braun, students in wheelchairs must
sit at the very back of the auditorium,
and wheelchair users cannot get down
to the instructor.
Some "disabled access" leads to a
locked door and a telephone that sup
posedly calls someone at the front desk
of the building. But what happens, for
instance, if the disabled student has no
arms? Even if the telephone does work,
which is often not the case, the atten
dant at the front desk may not have a
key to unlock the door. Memorial Audi
torium is a prime example of this pseu
do accessibility.

Community centers, like the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
the entire campus ministry office com
plex and the Clubhouse complex in Old
Union are completely inaccessible.
Library stacks cannot accommodate
wheelchairs, and the campus maps post
ed all over, though pretty, are useless to
a blind visitor trying to get around.
Whitney said that "Currently, three
undergraduate and seven existing grad
uate residences, plus two new graduate
residences due to open in fall 1997, all
have elevators." One of those elevators
is in Florence Moore, another is in Mir
rielees and the third is in Synergy. So,
if students in wheelchairs want a dorm
with singles, underclassmen and a non
vegetarian menu, they would be con
fined to the first floor of a dorm. The
Americans with Disabilities Act stipu
lates equal access, so why is it that so
many housing options are off limits to
disabled students?
It has been pointed out that Stan-

ford's campus was built at a time when
little, if any, thought was given to the
disabled. When the Manzanita complex
was built in 1989, the disabled commu
nity at Stanford asked the designers to
include an elevator. When the complex
opened, there were no elevators. The
University promised to retrofit the
dorm with an elevator. This has not
happened, almost a decade later. This
turns the valid point about the age of
the campus into a poor excuse for lazi
ness and stinginess.
I challenge Housing and Dining Ser
vices to prove its claim of trying to help
by installing elevators in every single
dorm that comes up for the Capital
Improvement Program. I challenge the
University to make the campus accessi
ble. This is one of the greatest universi
ties in the entire world, and I love it
here. It is unfortunate that my physically
disabled friends cannot enjoy it as I do.
