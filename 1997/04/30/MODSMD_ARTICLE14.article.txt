On behalf of every member of Kappa
Sigma, we would like to extend our sin
cere regret for the homophobic con
frontation that occurred at our recent
Punk Party. That homophobia contin
ues to exist on this campus is of deep
concern to all of us at Kappa Sig, partic
ularly now that it has hit so close to our
own home. We wish to convey to every
member of the Stanford community that
at no time did any member of our frater
nity condone or participate in the alarm

ing behavior that characterized this inci
dent. Our house and parties have always
been — and will continue to be — open
to all Stanford students regardless of
race, gender or sexual orientation. To
have one of our guests harassed and
subsequently turned away from our
party on any of these grounds is abhor
rent and unacceptable to all of us.
We acknowledge that an unfortunate
lapse in our own party security allowed
for this homophobic encounter to occur.
While two of our members were called
away from their posts to handle an alter
cation in our backyard, three individuals
who are not members the fraternity
posed as doormen and began checking

the IDs of incoming guests. It is during
this period that one of our guests was
asked, "What are you, a fag?" and
denied admission to the party. Regret
tably, no member from our house was
present to hear this confrontation or to
rectify its consequences. Under normal
circumstances, when our system of party
monitors and doormen is working opti
mally, this affront never would have
occurred, and the guest would have been
admitted to the party without question.
We apologize to the guests and the larg
er Stanford community offended by
these individuals for the circumstances
that allowed this incident to occur.
Kappa Sigma has always been proud of

its tradition of openness and discourse on
political and humanitarian issues. We are
concerned that our commitment to toler
ance and healthy dialogue has been
unjustly sullied in recent days by inaccu
rate information. Despite this publicity to
the contrary, our house will continue to
work closely with the University and gay
community over the coming days to bring
justice to this matter and to ensure the
future safety and comfort of all students,
both at Kappa Sigma and at Stanford.
