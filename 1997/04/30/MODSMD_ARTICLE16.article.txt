## We're just a bunch of freaks 
### 
AT STANFORD 39 years ago, Ken
Kesey was a Stegner fellow, owned
a house on Perry Lane — an old
artsy-bohemian neighborhood where acid
was dropped and Jerry Garcia and others
hung out — and became part of a note
worthy social experiment called the
19605. Today, Perry Lane is buried under
the Stanford Golf Course and they've
built a new Bloomingdale's, which tells
you something about subcultures at Stan
ford: They're pretty hard pressed.
As a prospective freshman, I read "The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," the story of
Ken Kesey, and I was full of fantasies
about San Francisco and Stanford. Some
how I imagined that San Francisco was
closer, geographically and mentally, to
Stanford, that the '60s spirit of social
experiment had survived, at least in some
form. This wasn't really true, although 1
did find a pretty diverse array of subcul
tures at Stanford but not the ones I had
expected. I was flipping through an old
Approaching Stanford once — those info
books they send to all the frosh — and I
was amused to see Stanford advertising
itself as "The only university in the coun
try with a Nordstrom on campus." So
much for alternative lifestyles.
In the info-books, everyday Stanford is
charming and campy, rife with anecdotes
about opening night a capella concerts and
dorm outings. But for me, the pleasures of
Juice Club en masse and tawdry '80s
themed dorm parties quickly lost their lus

ter. Even the newness of Bloomie's faded,
and you do get tired of leering grad stu
dents coming on to you in Social Dance I.
At first glance, it seems that a furious ren
dezvous with the Ford Center Stairmaster
might be your only respite from banal
study breaks and the nightly core crowd at
Sweet Hall — pale, pasty-mouthed and vis
ibly ulcered. But what else is there?
As someone who's been around for four
years and had friends of just about every
social persuasion you can think of — from
Chi Omegas to stoner babes to people who
dress up in medieval garb and stage duels
every weekend — I can tell you that alter
native lifestyles are alive and well at Stan
ford, sort of. I can tell you that while Jerry
might be dead, there are still quite a few
freaks around campus. I can tell you what
I have heard, and what I have seen:
I have seen Pi Phis in slick black rubber
short-shorts play dominatrix to a bunch of
Sigma Chis in chinos and loafers.
I have had three members of a Stanford
a capella group explain to me the intricate
web of sexual deception that they called "a
capella-cest."
I have been offered free mushrooms at
more than one party at the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest, but I won't tell you if I
accepted.
I have noticed that many Stanford
women jog around dinner time, and I have
wondered if they are skipping it.
I have seen pictures of a Stanford
Review editor posing in front of the Con

federate flag with a porn calendar in one
hand and a beer in the other.
I have had the opportunity to join the
Cowell Cluster lesbian clique in their
weekly sauna ritual at ATO, swimsuit
optional. By invitation only.
I have heard that Synergy residents
like to call themselves Synners. But I find
it odd, because Synergy residents have
been, if anything, angels whispering in my
ear. "Eat vegan," they urge. "Stop multi
national investment."
I have had members of Chi-O, Delta
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta and Tri-Delt
tell me in all honesty that their sorority is
the "non-sorority sorority."
I have endured the exhortations of a
few Bible beaters in Wilbur.
I have gone to a Senior Pub Nite, taken
one look insid, and decided to leave.
I have, all in all, decided that while
Stanford may not be the mini-bohemia of
the Perry Lane days, there's certainly no
lack of lifestyle alternatives. And that the
Farm, as the guidebooks call it (though no
one else seems to), hasn't really been
paved over with bland Bloomingdale's cor
poratism. Smoothie, anyone?

heard you do many things and may just
write about it someday.
