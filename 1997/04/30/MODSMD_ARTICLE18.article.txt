THE FIRST CASSETTE tape I ever
owned was "Purple Rain" by
Prince and the Revolution. This
was before compact discs, before Prince
lost the Revolution (and his name) and
before I even owned a tape deck. But some
days when my sister wasn't home, I would
sneak into her room to play "I Would Die
4 U" and / or "When Doves Cry" as loud
as I could on her boombox before my mom
screamed up the stairs, "Your sister's
home from soccer practice!"
Nowadays, people see Purple Rain
tucked in among my cassettes and think
I'm a complete freak for actually owning
an Album Currently Known As Prince.
So here's my thought-provoking ques
tion of the week: When did the contents
of someone's music collection become a
method for rating them on that all
important Scale O' Cool? You know what
I mean. You walk into someone's room
and your eyes immediately check out and
start grading their music collection. It
seems that anyone who owns "Achtung,
Baby'' or "Billy Joel's Greatest Hits"
rates "hella cool," and someone with

"Ten" or "Scynchronicity" rates "kinda
nifty." But if you've got "Use Your Illu
sion I & II" sitting in plain view, you rate
"complete loser."
As if we all haven't rocked out with
Axl and Slash to a little "November
Rain."
I can't tell you how many times I've
looked through someone's little black,
portable CD case and heard them make
an apology about one or more of the CDs
in their collection, even when I wasn't
making a single comment. "Those aren't
all of my CDs," they will say, as if I were
thinking, "Gosh, I can't believe his entire
CD collection is just 100 alphabetized
CDs!" They'll point to a CD, saying,
"That one's just a joke. I can't believe I
actually have it in there." As if we all
don't know multiple people who own
either the "I'm Too Sexy" single (with
the Spanish version on Side B) or a tech
no version of "Macarena."
Then there is my favorite excuse for
owning a particular CD: "Oh, that one?
Ummm... Columbia House sent it cause I
forgot to send back that little card ... and,

well, you know ... I was too lazy to send it
back." As if Roy Orbison were that bad.
And I wasn't even asking for excuses!
People automatically feel that the quality
and quantity of their CD collection says
something very important about who and
what they are deep down inside. Just
because you have "Dookie" doesn't mean
that's what you are. And, of course, this
doesn't even account for what people feel
when someone notices that they actually
have audiotapes in their collection. Vinyl
is cool and 8-Tracks are antiques. But
cassettes? I'll say it here and now: I
haven't thrown away or hidden my tape
collection, and I own fewer CDs than
there are continental states. There, I said
it. And if you think less of me, so be it.
Personally, I don't really trust a per
son's CD collection if there isn't some
thing in there that is either just plain
embarrassing, ridiculous or a dated relic
left over from our collective childhoods.
Just because I have both Tiffany and
Young M.C.'s debut albums doesn't make
me (particularly) weird. It means that
I'm comfortable enough with my own

identity that I can "Bust A Move" with
someone at any time, and that I can
immediately show off my sensitive side
with a little "Could've Been." And just
because my roommate has an Anthrax
album tucked away in his lower-left desk
drawer doesn't mean he has bad taste.
Well, OK, bad example.
But you know what I mean. Remem
ber back before we could drive (for some
of us, that wasn't that long ago), and
Mom would take us to the CD store, and
we'd wander the aisles for 20 minutes
while Mom either sat in the car reading a
magazine or embarrassed us by looking
in the "Oldies" section? Well, we all
bought some doozies, and right now we
feel like we need to apologize for them,
being dishonest to ourselves and our
friends. And we all know that denial is
the first symptom. Of what, I don't know,
but we need to band together and stop
hiding important parts of ourselves.
That is why I believe today should be
National Crappy Compact Disc Day
(NCCDD). Everyone on this campus
should reach deep into desk drawers or

that box in the bottom of the closet or call
Mom and have her Fed Ex a CD or audio
tape that we are all too embarrassed to put
into our stereos. And then blast them loud.
I want to be able to walk by Flo Mo and
hear some Jets or Mr. Big or Extreme. I
want to be sauntering by Roble and hear
those melodious guitar strains of Nelson
floating to meet me as a pass by. I want to
meander by Wilbur and hear MTV Dance
Parties and Celebrity Christmas albums
wafting down Escondido. From the
foothills of Stanford to the mountains of
Tahoe let "Freedom '90" ring!
And then maybe we'll realize that we
should judge each other by the content of
their characters, not the content of their
collections. Unless they have something
like "Totally Devo" on tape. Then feel
free to laugh your ass off.
