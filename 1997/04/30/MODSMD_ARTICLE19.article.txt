Diabetes is an insidious disease.
Beverly Dyck, the diabetes clinical nurse specialist
at Stanford Medical Center, doesn't look happy as
her eyes scan the list of statistics provided by the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kid
ney Diseases.
"It's such a sad disease," she said, slightly surprised
that the diy pages of numbers referring to diabetes
patients can still affect her in this way, despite work
ing with diabetics for the past three years.
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not pro
duce or properly use insulin, a hormone that allows
glucose to enter cells from the bloodstream. In
healthy, non-diabetic individuals, the pancreas regu
lates the amount of glucose in the blood and automat
ically produces the right amount of insulin to move the
glucose from the blood into the cells. In diabetic
patients, glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into
the urine and passes out of the body, ultimately
depriving the body of its main source of fuel.
Toxicity due to high concentrations of glucose and
an associated "thickening" of the blood are the cause
of the myriad seemingly unrelated medical conditions
suffered by diabetics.
Sixteen million people in the United States have
diabetes. Ten percent have type 1 diabetes (insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus) and 90 percent are type
2 diabetics (non-insulin dependent or mature-onset
diabetes).
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in
which the insulin-producing beta cells of the pan
creas are destroyed. Symptoms usually develop over
a short period. However, beta cell destruction is a
gradual process of deterioration than can begin years
earlier. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs daily
injections of insulin.

In type 2 diabetes the pancreas usually produces
insulin, but the body cannot use the insulin effective
ly, producing the same end result of glucose build-up
in the blood.

People suffering from either type of diabetes need
to closely monitor their blood glucose levels. It's not
surprising, then, that diabetes patients are excited
about the possibility of non-invasive blood glucose

monitoring. Type 2 diabetics often test their blood glu
cose levels daily, but Type 1 diabetics must check their
blood up to eight times per day, each time pricking a
finger to raise a drop of blood.
To this end, Assoc. Pediatrics Prof. Darrell Wilson
is involved in the development of devices that can
read glucose levels without taking a blood sample. He
is also the local principle investigator of a nationwide
clinical trial to determine if type 1 diabetes can be pre
vented in those who have an increased risk for devel
oping the disease.
To identify those at high risk, the Diabetes Preven
tion Trial — Type 1 is testing close relatives of people
with type 1 diabetes. People who meet the criteria can
take a free test to see if their blood contains beta cell
autoantibodies. Individuals in whom antibodies are
detected qualify for enrollment in the clinical trial,
which is hoping to determine whether type 1 diabetes
can be prevented with pro-active administration of
insulin injections or insulin capsules.
Since only 3 percent of all relatives of individuals
with type 1 diabetes will be at risk for developing the
disease, it is estimated that at least 80,000 people will
need to be screened to complete the trial, and Wilson is
still searching for more participants. Stanford Medical
Center is one of 10 medical centers in the United States
taking part in the study.
Dyck is also supervising part of a national research
study. Dyck's research project focuses on the in-hospi
tal care of diabetes patients who are primarily admit
ted for a medical condition such as heart attack or
pneumonia. Patients with diabetes stay in hospital
two days longer than non-diabetic patients with the
same condition and are prone to more medical compli
cations.
The aim of the study is to identify opportunities for
improvement in the hospital management of diabetes
as a secondary condition.

The pancreas produces two hormones that regulate blood glucose. One is insulin, which decreases
blood glucose levels. Another is glucagon, which increases blood glucose levels. Diabetes adversely
affects the production and usage of insulin in the body.
