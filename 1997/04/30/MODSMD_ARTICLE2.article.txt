# Casper takes tea
## Hate crimes, tenure issues main topics of discussion 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper announced an im
portant finding of the Greek Af
fairs Task Force last night at a
"Tea and Cookies with Gerhard
Casper" event that otherwise fo
cused heavily on recent out
breaks of anti-gay sentiment.
Casper said the task force re
port, which has yet to be re
leased to the public, will recom
mend that sororities be allowed
to apply for housing in the next
academic year. Casper said he
supported this finding.
The announcement came in
response to a question from ju
nior Lisa Rubin, president of the
Intersorority Council, who said
afterward that she is "highly en
thusiastic." However, she de
clined to comment further until
the Greek community has had a
chance to discuss these findings
with the administration later
this week.
The question of sorority
housing came up only at the end
of the 90-minute session. Many
of the remaining questions came
from members of the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community
and others concerned about a
perceived rise in the frequency
and visibility of hate crimes and
other forms of anti-gay activity
on campus.
One repeated, specific re
quest was that the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Cen
ter have a director supported by
the University. This was one of
the recommendations of a dean
of students report on lesbian,

gay and bisexual issues released
in 1995.
The LGBCC "needs to see
that we are being taken serious
ly," said senior Bari Mandel
baum.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
responded by suggesting that
these concerned students sub
mit a new proposal that outlined
"what lyourl needs are and how
you see a director as responding
to those needs."
Wais said a new proposal
would be appropriate because he
sensed that concern about anti
gay incidents had increased in
the past two years. He also noted
that 47 of the 90 recommenda
tions made in the report have
been enacted. Progress has been
made on another 21, he added.
Casper also spoke several
times on the anti-gay issue; he
made several remarks before
questions began.
"No university can thrive un
less each member is accepted as
an individual. . . without regard
to labels or stereotypes," he said.
He added, however, that the
University faced limits in the
disciplinary action it could take,
particularly given the court deci
sion in 1995 that struck down
the University's speech code, a
decision Casper disagreed with
at the time. The code, called the
Grey Interpretation of Stan
ford's Fundamental Standard,
was issued in 1990 and prohibit
ed students from using "gutter
epithets and symbols of bigotry"
against an individual or small
groups of people based on race,

sex, disability, religion or sexual
orientation.
"With regard to 'pure speech,'
we do not have the means we once
thought we did," Casper said.
He added later that any con
cerns the gay community might
have about safety or security
should certainly be handled by the
University. However, he also em
phasized that students had impor
tant, independent ways "to make
sure that debate on this campus is
uninhibited and open."
In his opening speech, Casper
also responded to a column in yes
terday's Daily regarding whether
he should take public stands on so
cial issues.
He said he is frequently asked
to take such stands but that if he
were to do so, it would be taken as
an official University position.
Consequently, it might have a
negative effect on free discussion
and dissent.

He also responded to a student
group that — according to doctor
al student Sarah Stein — included
about 60 students supporting the
tenure application of Asst. Histo
ry Prof. Karen Sawislak, who was
recently turned down for tenure
by a dean's committee.
Stein stressed both that Sawis
lak was "a scholar of the highest
excellence" and that Stanford's
record of giving tenure to women
was one of the worst in the coun
try, in spite of assurances from the
administration that giving women
tenure is a high priority.
Casper had no specific com
ment on the case, saying he had
read neither Sawislak's work nor
the file on her tenure. Any further
appeal still had several stages to
go through before it could ever
reach his desk, he said.
He said, however, that the
process of awarding tenure at
Stanford is "mostly based on the
notion that if there are doubts
[about a candidate's qualifica
tions] these doubts are not re
solved in favor of the candidate."
Another group who raised a

collective issue comprised 48 resi
dents from the Department of
Surgery. They had all signed a let
ter, which was presented to
Casper by resident George Yang.
The letter addressed the de
cline in resources and financial
support allocated to the Surgery
Department and asserted that "fi
nancial considerations have now
so dominated the decision-making
process that it is to the detriment
of the academic mission."
Casper accepted the letter but
defended the current priorities in
the running of the medical center.
"We are engaged in what is re
ally in many ways a struggle for
survival. ... Nobody — nobody —
wants to support academic medi
cine," he said, citing particularly
the growth of health maintenance
organizations.
"The University has no busi
ness being in the business of
health care. The only reason we
have clinics and a hospital is our
academic mission," said Casper.
"The only reason we look to busi
ness concerns is that we have to
have revenue."
