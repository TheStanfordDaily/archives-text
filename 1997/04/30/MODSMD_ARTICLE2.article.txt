# Casper takes tea
## Hate crimes, tenure issues main topics of discussion 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper announced an im
portant finding of the Greek Af
fairs Task Force last night at a
"Tea and Cookies with Gerhard
Casper" event that otherwise fo
cused heavily on recent out
breaks of anti-gay sentiment.
Casper said the task force re
port, which has yet to be re
leased to the public, will recom
mend that sororities be allowed
to apply for housing in the next
academic year. Casper said he
supported this finding.
The announcement came in
response to a question from ju
nior Lisa Rubin, president of the
Intersorority Council, who said
afterward that she is "highly en
thusiastic." However, she de
clined to comment further until
the Greek community has had a
chance to discuss these findings
with the administration later
this week.
The question of sorority
housing came up only at the end
of the 90-minute session. Many
of the remaining questions came
from members of the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community
and others concerned about a
perceived rise in the frequency
and visibility of hate crimes and
other forms of anti-gay activity
on campus.
One repeated, specific re
quest was that the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Cen
ter have a director supported by
the University. This was one of
the recommendations of a dean
of students report on lesbian,

gay and bisexual issues released
in 1995.
The LGBCC "needs to see
that we are being taken serious
ly," said senior Bari Mandel
baum.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
responded by suggesting that
these concerned students sub
mit a new proposal that outlined
"what lyourl needs are and how
you see a director as responding
to those needs."
Wais said a new proposal
would be appropriate because he
sensed that concern about anti
gay incidents had increased in
the past two years. He also noted
that 47 of the 90 recommenda
tions made in the report have
been enacted. Progress has been
made on another 21, he added.
Casper also spoke several
times on the anti-gay issue; he
made several remarks before
questions began.
"No university can thrive un
less each member is accepted as
an individual. . . without regard
to labels or stereotypes," he said.
He added, however, that the
University faced limits in the
disciplinary action it could take,
particularly given the court deci
sion in 1995 that struck down
the University's speech code, a
decision Casper disagreed with
at the time. The code, called the
Grey Interpretation of Stan
ford's Fundamental Standard,
was issued in 1990 and prohibit
ed students from using "gutter
epithets and symbols of bigotry"
against an individual or small
groups of people based on race,
