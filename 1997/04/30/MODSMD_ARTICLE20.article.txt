# Bug talks about taste

### Anthony Engel 
Q»l'm a senior who has lived
• in Flo Mo for four years.
I'm worried that I haven't experi
enced enough of the world to
have real skills. Will I be able to
get a job?
A .Well, I understand your
• Worry. But you'd be sur
prised — you may have skills you
never realized before. Have you
ever considered a job such as ice
cream tasting? There are few
prerequisites, and as I recall,
Florence Moore Hall serves ice
cream at every meal, so I'd bet
you've got experience, too.
Let me give you a little more
background before you make up
your mind. First off, do you
know what taste really is? (I'm
not talking about the clothes
clashing type of taste — this is a
serious issue of biology.) It's a
common error to confuse taste
with flavor. Sure, they sound like
the same thing, but taste is real
ly just a part of flavor.
When you get a cold and you
can't smell, food just doesn't
"taste" right. This is not because
your taste is impaired but
because your ability to perceive
flavor is.
You see, you need to be able to
smell and taste to get the most
out of your food. Flavor is actual
ly composed of the sensations of
taste, texture, temperature and
aroma.
The different tastes that we
sense are commonly grouped as
sweet, bitter, salty and sour. Dif
ferent things have different
tastes based on their chemical
composition.
Sweet foods generally contain
sugars and alcohols. Bitter foods
are often poisonous. Saltiness
comes from ionic substances
such as sodium. Sourness comes
from solutions containing hydro
gen ions. Spiciness is not a taste

but a reaction from the pain
fibers surrounding your taste
buds.
You may have learned that
you can only taste certain tastes
in specific areas of your tongue.
This may or may not be true.
Recent research suggests that
the regional specificity is not
nearly as well defined as previ
ously thought.
There are about 9,000 taste
buds in the human mouth. Most
are located on the tongue, but
they can also be found on the
lips, the inside of the cheeks, the
roof of the mouth and the back of
the throat.
The structure of taste buds is
segmented, similar to the
appearance of an orange or
grapefruit. Fifty to 150 cells of
four or five different types make
up a whole taste bud.
The cells are "neuroepithe
lial," which means they are relat
ed to skin and sensation. The
cells are intricately interconnect
ed and communicate with one
another. All taste buds look the
same regardless of what taste
they sense best.
The exact mechanism of taste
is still unknown. It is an
extremely complex process
because it involves many sys
tems.
One thing that is known is
that taste is a secondary sensory
system. This means that it is not
nerves that sense, but the neu
roepithelial taste bud cells. This
makes sense because taste buds
need to be replaced every 10 days
or so. The nerves that are con
nected to taste buds live for a
long time and just make connec
tions to the new taste buds.
When food is partially dis
solved in the mouth, its con
stituent chemicals are released.
Some of them enter the taste
pores (the point of entry into the
taste bud). The molecules that
enter stimulate microvilli (fine

The Science Bug

hairs) in the cells that initiate a
nerve impulse. The central ner
vous system decodes the infor
mation and interprets the taste.
Serous glands near the taste
buds secrete saliva, which in
addition to breaking down food,
also serves to wash the taste
buds so they will increase in sen
sitivity.
Taste buds are highly adap
tive. For instance, with constant
stimulus they quickly reduce the
amount of information they
transmit.
This is a major reason why
chewing gum loses its flavor so
quickly — while the sugar is
being used up, the mouth is also
becoming less sensitive to it. The
extent of this effect varies by
individual. Some people, after
adjusting to sour tastes, will find
that pure water tastes sweet for
a short while.
So, if you're still thinking
about that ice cream tasting job,
you should probably consider a
few things first. John Harrison is
the official taste tester at the
Edy's / Dreyer's Ice Cream Com
pany.
To maintain his top-notch
tasting ability, he doesn't eat
spicy or hot foods, drink alcohol
or smoke. Do you think you're
ready for that kind of commit
ment?
One last word: You should
probably check out a different
company if you're interested —
Harrison's taste buds are
insured by his company for $1
million.
