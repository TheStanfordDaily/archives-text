# Gene therapy stops tumor growth
## 
### Rollin Hu Contributing writer 
As an advance in the multi
pronged approach toward curing
malignant brain tumors, Stanford
researchers have discovered that
gene therapy can stop the growth
of tumors in rats.
Gerald Silverberg, professor of
neurosurgery at the Medical
School, led the project, which
found that introducing tumor-sup
pressant genes into rat brain can
cer cells could substantially stop
the malignant growth. "Our work
is an effort to find a palliation for
one of the most deadly of cancers,
which is presently untreatable,"
Silverberg said in a statement.
Silverberg's lab focused on a rat
tumor that is substantially similar
to human glioblastoma, which is
the deadliest human brain cancer.
It occurs most frequently among
men between the ages of 40 and 60.
Up to half of all malignant brain
tumor patients suffer from
glioblastoma.
The new study revealed that

introduction of certain genes could
cause rat tumors to stop growing.
These genes, called p53, p2l, pl 6
and pRb, express proteins that stop
cell division.
After introduction into tumor
cells, the genes express their sup
presser proteins and cause the cells
to stop replicating. According to
Victor Tse, chief neurosurgery res
ident at Stanford Hospital and a
PhD molecular biologist working
in Silverberg's lab, "The genes
don't kill the cell. They just cause
them to sit there doing nothing."
The genes were introduced into
the rat tumors by using retrovirus
es as "vectors." In simple terms,
the virus was used as a kind of
mailman, delivering its package of
genes to tumor cells.
The genes were first attached to
the viruses, and then the entire
virus was injected into the tumor.
The viruses proceeded to infect the
tumor and insert their attached
genes into the cells. Once inside the
tumor cells, the tumor-suppres
sant genes could do their work.
In the rat tumors, introduction

of the pl 6 gene seemed to be the
most effective at making the tumor
cells "sit and do nothing." It
reduced formation of new malig
nant cell colonies by 98 percent,
tumor volume by 90 percent and
growth rate by 60 percent. Treated
rats lived three times longer than
untreated rats.
The p2l gene was also effective,
reducing colony formation by 91
percent, tumor volume by 67 per
cent and growth rate by 66 percent.
Treatment with p2l also prolonged
the rats' lives.
Gene therapy also enhanced the
effectiveness of radiation therapy.
Therapeutic radiation treatments
were able to kill 93 percent of
tumor colonies infected with p2l.
According to Tse, this is because
gene therapy "slows down the
repair of cells."
Normal cells are often able to
repair themselves after being irra
diated. However, since gene thera
py interferes with the cell cycle,
tumor cells treated with p2l can
not repair themselves quickly
enough. As a result, they die.
"What we can't cut out we can
make more susceptible to radia
tion. That's why we're so excited
about the radiation tie," Tse said.
Silverberg and Tse suggest that
their findings could lead to future
clinical applications. After stan
dard surgery removes most of the
tumor, neurosurgeons can inject
the brain with a gene-carrying
virus that will halt the growth of
the remaining, unseen malignant
cells. "It's almost like molecular
surgery. What we can't get with
the knife we can get with molecules
produced by the tumor suppresser
genes," Tse said in a statement.
However, both Silverberg and
Tse emphasize that their research
is at an early stage and still far
from any clinical human trials.
"We don't want people to under
estimate how preliminary we
are," Tse said. "This really is an
early stage."
