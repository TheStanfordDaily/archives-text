# Memory centers in brain identified
## 
### 
Stanford scientists under the direction of Asst. Psy
chology Prof. John Gabrieli have identified two distinct
structures in the human brain responsible for the encod
ing and retrieval of memory.
In studies of adults using functional magnetic reso
nance imaging, Gabrieli's team discovered that retrieval
of memories prompted greater neural activity in a
region of the brain called the hippocampus, while the

encoding of memories activated neurons in a region just behind the
hippocampus called the parahippocampus.
"The hippocampus is really a set of highly interconnected structures,
so it has been hard to tell which one plays what role in memory,"
Gabrieli said.
The sensitivity of the MRI has enabled Gabrieli to resolve small dif
ferences in the amount of blood oxygen — a signal of neural activity —
flowing through parts of the brain separated by as little as a millimeter.
To identify the region of the brain involved in memory retrieval, sub
jects in the study were shown drawings of objects and animals before
they would have to recall those images. While the functional MRI
scanned their brain, they were shown words and asked to remember if
the objects named had previously been shown.
In addition to contributing to our understanding of memory and the
brain, Gabrieli's findings could lead to a more effective treatment of
Alzheimer's disease.
At present, doctors cannot predict the advent of Alzheimer's disease
until the patient manifests symptoms. Gabrieli hopes that by imaging
the brain's memory system using functional MRI, doctors may be able
to detect signs of Alzheimer's disease early enough to administer pre
ventative medical treatments.
