# Exercise recommended for seniors
## 
### 
A team of Stanford researchers lead by Abby King,
assistant professor of health research and policy, discov
ered that senior citizens need to supplement the tradi
tionally encouraged strength and endurance workout
with one that develops stretching and flexibility.
In one of the first systematic, randomized, long
term studies comparing these two types of workouts,
King and her colleagues found that both types of exer-

rise have their own particular benefits. More than 100 seniors par
ticipated in this study.
After a year, members of the group concentrating on strength
and endurance exhibited improved cardiovascular fitness as well as
increased strength. The stretching group failed to improve in these
two areas but they reported less pain and higher flexibility.
"The bottom line," King said, "is while moderate-intensity
endurance and strengthening exercises are indeed important to the
health and functioning of seniors, benefits from stretch and flex exer
cises in the area of daily pain shouldn't be underrated since pain has
a major impact on people's quality of life."
The study encouraged participants to exercise four times every
week, twice in class and twice at home. "The use of both class and
home-based formats for both types of programs was especially help
ful," King added. The mix of classes and practice at home helped
seniors learn safe exercise techniques while maintaining the conve
nience of practicing at home.
"Now that we know what the components of exercise can do, we can
figure out good ways to combine them to provide an optimal approach
for seniors," King said.
