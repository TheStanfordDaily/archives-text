## Softball tailgate is a wacky affair 
### 
There's a definite art to being
a softball fan. It's a relaxed
game, and it requires a
relaxed frame of mind.
You can't go in expecting high
action drama or even constant
action. If you do, the only thing
that will happen is you'll end up
sitting in the hot sun for two hours

waiting for that one exciting play
that's over in about 30 seconds.
And no matter how exciting
that play is (and believe me, it's not
always that exciting), you end up
wondering if it was worth that
much of your time.
Once you've established that as
a softball spectator you are not in
the stands to be captivated by the
action, you can eryoy the game for
the fine art it is meant to promote:
obnoxious yelling at the opponent,
or, more technically, heckling.
This has to be the greatest
invention of sports like softball and
baseball. I mean, what else do you
think that down time between
actual hits and plays is for? And it's
not like golf or tennis, where prop
er etiquette looks down on unruly
behavior. On the contrary, in soft
ball, it's a true sign of a fan who
knows how to enjoy the game.
I used to pride myself as being a
world-class heckler. I'm definitely
loud enough, and I can be as obnox
ious as the next person. But I must
confess that I've lost my touch.
I spent last season as a fledgling
reporter covering the softball beat,
and being the consummate profes
sional (with the minor exception of
that preview article), I played it
straight. I couldn't really consider
myself a dignified sportswriter (if
there is such a thing) and continue
to heckle as I did in my early years.
So I limited my game behavior
to saying positive things — cheer
ing for the Stanford players and
not giving the other team too much
trouble when it screwed up.
And sadly enough, at the start
of this season, I continued my pos
itive cheering rather than revert
ing to proper form. Yes, I'm
ashamed, but it was easy to do.
There weren't a lot of vocal fans at
the games, and when you are the
only one yelling rude things to peo
ple who are bigger than you and
have aluminum bats, you start to
wonder how sane you really are.
But recently, my heckling urges
returned, and I conceived a plan:
Invite lots of people to a game, feed
them, offer them beer, and let
them be loud. OK, my original plan
was just to have beer at a game, but
when I thought about it, I realized
it would be more fun with more
people. And if I made it a bigger
event, I could probably get my
dorm to pay for it.
Hence the birth of the Robinson
House Tailgate.
It was an easy sell — I said both
Jessica Schulman and Katie Beat
tie, who live in Robinson, deserved
our support. Then I said we'd have
beer and food, and everyone
thought it was a great idea.
We picked Saturday against St.
Mary's. The weather was predicted
to be great, and the team definitely

had a good chance to win. I let my
roommate make fliers. Big mistake.
She said it was a tailgate for Jess
and Katie and we were playing St.
Mary's starting around noon. She
didn't mention the fact that it was
even a Softball game, and I'm cer
tain that explains the poor turnout.
Nevertheless, the tailgate was
by all standards (and there really
aren't any because I've never had a
Softball tailgate) a success. We
started on time and set up camp in
center field, and people actually
showed up, probably because I
spent the three days prior to the
game inviting everyone I saw.
But people were there for the
start of the game and even got to
hear an amazing rendition of the
national anthem. We couldn't
actually hear the singer from cen
ter field (again, I blame my room
mate for the speakers being turned
the wrong direction), but we lis
tened to an equally impressive ver
sion from one of our tailgaters.
Once the game started the obvi
ous target of our heckling was the
Gael center fielder. Poor' Ana. By
the end of the game, she had moved
to left. But not without shouts of
"Come back, Ana! We miss you."
I'm sure she felt the love.
At least the love was flowing
because that's more than I can say
for the beer. It was a little foamy.
Although I hate to blame my room
mate again, it really was her fault.
(Sorry to lay all this blame on you,
Becky, but you tapped the keg.)
It's OK though: I managed to
consume the foamy beer. Unfortu
nately, I was the only one, and by
day's end, we hadn't done much
damage to the keg. But that's OK,
too. Having a cold, tapped keg
served me well at work Sunday
night. But back to the tailgate.
Somehow I ended up being the
authority on softball. Maybe that's
because most of the people haven't
been to many games, but at any
rate, I attempted to answer all
their questions. And if it was some
thing I didn't know, I made it up.
So let me just correct a few of
the things I might have misled you
on. Shorts are cooler than pants
and if you know how to slide prop
erly you don't screw up your legs,
plus you wear kneepads. (I got that
one right.) A player wearing the
number 11 can be referred to as
"eleven" or "one, one," but you can
also call her "sticks."
The name bullpen has nothing
to do with actual bulls, and the
teams do hit home runs from time
to time. The fence in the outfield is
break-away. But that's not meant
to promote crashing through the
fence, although Dawn Kobata has
made a habit of it. Collisions do
occur, most often at the plate, but
occasionally between fielders as
well. Finally, the Gaels do practice.
Now that I've cleared that up,
let me just say, I'm glad to have
gotten back into heckling, and I
owe it all to those obnoxious tail
gaters at Saturday's game. There
were even a few who came back for
Sunday's game against Arizona,
although I don't think they real
ized the danger they were in by
heckling just yards away from the
Arizona dugout.
The heckling at last weekend's
games was as good as it's been all
year, and I'll definitely be heading
out to the field today to pick up
where I left off against Cal. I mean,
as exciting as the third-inning triv
ia has become with television's
greatest hits, it's just not a game
without a few obnoxious fans.
