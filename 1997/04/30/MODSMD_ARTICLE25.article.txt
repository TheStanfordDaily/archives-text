# No.3 Stanford edges Cal Poly
## Gerut's shot lifts Cardinal to win 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
When the Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Mus
tangs rode into town for last night's contest
against the Cardinal, they probably could figure
what Stanford had planned for them — and it
rhymes with "quillotine." After last weekend's
pounding of California in a remarkable offen
sive explosion, even the best team setting foot
in Sunken Diamond would have knocking
knees and chattering teeth.
Despite its fear, Cal Poly (32-16) put up a
valiant fight against the No. 3 Cardinal (34-13,
17-7 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
in last night's game and ended up making the
game one of the tightest of the year for Stan
ford.
Stanford was able to prevail 4-3, but only
after a thrilling home run by sophomore center
fielder Jody Gerut in the bottom of the ninth
inning.
Stanford had rolled into top of the ninth
with a flimsy 3-2 lead. Sophomore reliever Tony
Cogan, who had blanked the Mustangs in the
seventh and eighth to protect Stanford's lead,
was on the mound to try to close out the game.
But left fielder R.J. Radler, the first batter
Cogan (7-1) faced in the inning, immediately
sliced the ball through the middle of the infield
and into center field for a single.
Cogan quickly settled down, getting the next
two batters to drive Cal Poly down to its last
out.
Then plans changed.
With pinch runner Andrew Watt still on
first, second baseman Scott Kidd smashed a
two-strike pitch from Cogan hard and fast
toward the center-field fence. Gerut fled into
deep center, giving chase, but the ball hit the
top of the fence in left center and fell for a dou
ble, scoring Watt from first to tie the game.
The hit was the 87th of the season for Kidd,
setting a new Cal Poly record.
The game went into the bottom of the ninth
tied at 3-3.
That set the stage for Gerut, who smashed
an offering from Mustang reliever Mike Zirelli
(9-4) over the left-center field fence to win.
Zirelli is normally the team's top starter.

Sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut strokes a second-inning single in last night's
game against Cal Poly. He hit the game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth.
The game had started slowly as
the two teams traded zeroes in the
first two innings.
After the Mustangs blew the dust
off the game in the top of the third
on a home run by center fielder
Ryan Brennan, senior first baseman
Luke Quaccia answered back with
one of his own in the bottom of the
inning to tie the game at 1-1.
For Quaccia, it was the third
home run in four games and his fifth
in the last two weeks.
"I've just been trying to get the
ball in the air more recently,"
Quaccia said. "I've been hitting it
hard all year; they have just been
going for doubles in the gap instead
of homers."
The Cardinal chipped further to
ward victory in the next inning
when junior catcher Jon SchaefTer,
the Six-Pac player of the week, hit a
fluke double and was driven in by a
single Gerut, putting the Cardnial
ahead 2-1.
The teams traded runs again in
the sixth, bringing the score to 3-2.
Cogan blanked the Mustangs
until the top of the ninth, setting up
the tie.
Gerut, who finished with two
hits and two RBIs, was quick to look
forward to this weekend's series
with Arizona.
"They have three good starting
pitchers," he said. "Offensively,

we're going to have to solve the puz
zle early in the game. We couldn't do
that tonight."
This weekend's series against
Arizona (32-23, 13-14), the last
home games of the regular season
for the Cardinal, is one of the most
important of the season. The Cardi
nal is holding tightly onto a two
game lead over UCLA in a tight Six-
Pac division race.
"It's going to be tough this week
end," Quaccia said. "Arizona wants
all those games against us, and we
need to win to stay in close proximi
ty to Los Angeles. It would be nice to
have this cushion over them when
play UCLA."
