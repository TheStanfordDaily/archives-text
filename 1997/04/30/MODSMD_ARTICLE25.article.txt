# No.3 Stanford edges Cal Poly
## Gerut's shot lifts Cardinal to win 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
When the Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Mus
tangs rode into town for last night's contest
against the Cardinal, they probably could figure
what Stanford had planned for them â€” and it
rhymes with "quillotine." After last weekend's
pounding of California in a remarkable offen
sive explosion, even the best team setting foot
in Sunken Diamond would have knocking
knees and chattering teeth.
Despite its fear, Cal Poly (32-16) put up a
valiant fight against the No. 3 Cardinal (34-13,
17-7 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
in last night's game and ended up making the
game one of the tightest of the year for Stan
ford.
Stanford was able to prevail 4-3, but only
after a thrilling home run by sophomore center
fielder Jody Gerut in the bottom of the ninth
inning.
Stanford had rolled into top of the ninth
with a flimsy 3-2 lead. Sophomore reliever Tony
Cogan, who had blanked the Mustangs in the
seventh and eighth to protect Stanford's lead,
was on the mound to try to close out the game.
But left fielder R.J. Radler, the first batter
Cogan (7-1) faced in the inning, immediately
sliced the ball through the middle of the infield
and into center field for a single.
Cogan quickly settled down, getting the next
two batters to drive Cal Poly down to its last
out.
Then plans changed.
With pinch runner Andrew Watt still on
first, second baseman Scott Kidd smashed a
two-strike pitch from Cogan hard and fast
toward the center-field fence. Gerut fled into
deep center, giving chase, but the ball hit the
top of the fence in left center and fell for a dou
ble, scoring Watt from first to tie the game.
The hit was the 87th of the season for Kidd,
setting a new Cal Poly record.
The game went into the bottom of the ninth
tied at 3-3.
That set the stage for Gerut, who smashed
an offering from Mustang reliever Mike Zirelli
(9-4) over the left-center field fence to win.
Zirelli is normally the team's top starter.
