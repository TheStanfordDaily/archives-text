# Personal touch draws prep star Fasani
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
He could be the best quarter
back to come out of California in
years. By the time he's through, he
may have made Stanford fans for
get about names like Elway, Plun
kett and Stenstrom. He is being
called a once-in-a-lifetime player.
He is... a senior in high school.
Stanford, meet Randy Fasani —
blue-chip, can't-miss, mercilessly
over-hyped prep quarterback from
Loomis' Del Oro High School, near
Sacramento. Fasani is a 6-foot-3,
215-pound gun-slinger arid the
gem of the Cardinal's 1997 recruit
ing class, one of its best in years.
Fasani, of course, needs no
introduction to Stanford. He has
been well acquainted with the
Farm since the summer of 1995,
when he so impressed Stanford
coaches at their annual summer
camp that assistant coach and
recruiting coordinator Dave Tipton
told Fasani — only half-jokingly —
that he would be Stanford's next
Heisman Trophy winner.
And the story gets even better.
Picture this scene:
Stanford Hospital, January
1996. Fasani has just come out
from under the knife, having
undergone surgery to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament suffered
in the final game of what was an
attention-grabbing junior season.

So whose grinning faces does
Fasani land his drowsy eyes on
when he wakes from his anesthe
sia-induced slumber? Not his
mom, not his dad, not his high
school coach or guidance counselor
or priest, but rather Tipton and
offensive coordinator Dana Bible.
"The Stanford coaches were
standing right there over my bed,"
Fasani said in a phone interview
this week, "and I was like, 'Oh, my
gosh.' So I knew they liked me a lot
— I guess that's what recruiting's
all about."
It may seem to some like an
unlikely match. On the one hand,
there's Fasani — the hot-shot Ail-
American (the nation's No. 1 over
all prospect, according to Super-
Prep) being courted by every mtyor
college in the country — and
there's Stanford on the other, a
blue-collar Pacific 10 Conference
program without even a Rose Bowl
appearance in the last 25 years.
The courtship began that first
summer, when Fasani was, by his
own admission, a wide-eyed sopho
more looking to generate some
recruiting interest at Stanford's
summer camp.
"I was impressed with coach
(Tyrone) Willingham, the way he
talked to the players and the way
he taught the game of football,"
Fasani said. "They said if they had
a chance, if 1 was old enough,
they'd give me a scholarship right

there."
The injury came that fall, in the
Sac-Joaquin Section Division II
Championship Game against
Sonora. Fasani's knee gave out,
but he returned for the next series
and promptly completed a 53-yard
pass inside the Sonora 10-yard
line. But back at the line of scrim
mage, Fasani was in a heap, his leg
having collapsed on the follow
through.
The diagnosis was a torn ACL,
and Stanford coaches wryly con
vinced Fasani to let Michael
Dillingham — San Francisco
49ers' team physician and director
of sports medicine at Stanford
Health Services — perform the
procedure.
The tactic worked. Fasani's
seven-month rehabilitation pro
cess brought him periodically back
to Stanford, and eventually the
young passer was sold.
"And as I kept on coming down
for therapy," Fasani said, "I felt at
home at Stanford, even though I
wasn't a student there."
There was only one hitch. Both
of Fasani's parents attended a cer
tain public university across the
Bay, and at first, his mother, Mari
lyn, was uneasy with Randy's
apparent leaning toward Stanford.
But one bike ride around campus,
and she, too, was in love.
"When I had to choose between
Cal and Stanford, my parents were

totally open," Fasani said. "They
said that they knew that Stanford
was a better school."
At Stanford, said Fasani, "I
could play for a Division I football
team that's going to be a power
house in the Pac-10 and in the
country, as well as get a top-of-the
line education at the same time."
Fasani and fellow incoming
freshman Joe Borchard of Camar
illo, Calif, will make it a crowd at
quarterback this fall. Redshirt
freshman Chad Hutchinson, the
likely returning starter, sparkled
in the latter half of a 1996 season
as the Cardinal closed the season
with five straight wins. With
Hutchinson occupied by baseball,
freshman Todd llusak ran the
offense during spring drills, gaining
valuable experience and leadership.
As a result, Fasani will likely
spend his freshman year jus a red
shirt, learning the offense behind
Hutchinson and Husak.
Hutchinson "has a lot of skills
that will maybe even keep him
going to the NFL," Fasani said. "I
watched Todd Husak this spring
and that guy is also a great quar
terback. Coach Bible did wonderful
things with him. I'm just going to
go in and try my best."
If his best is as good as adver
tised, Fasani's time at quarterback
could come even sooner than
expected. And that's not to men
tion the Heisman.
