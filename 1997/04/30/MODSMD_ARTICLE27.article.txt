# Softball looks to upset No.24 Bears
## 
### Ryan Chavez Robin Davidson Contributing writers 
No. 24 California comes to campus
today at 1 p.m. to play two games against
a hungry Stanford softball team. The
Cardinal (24-24-1,5-15 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) needs a good showing to keep its
NCAA regional hopes alive.
With only today's game and this week
end's contests against Washington and
San Diego State left before a final road
trip to Oregon, the Cardinal needs every
win it can notch to have any chance at
making NCAA regionals.
"We need to win because we lost to
them twice at their place, and we need to
make up for that," said sophomore pitch
er Becky Blevins. "We need to do well in
the rest of our games to keep the hopes of
a postseason alive."
Stanford had trouble with California
(29-21, 8-11) earlier this season, when it
lost both games of a doubleheader at
Berkeley. The Card lost the first contest
10-2 but bounced back in the second
before losing a heartbreaker 8-7. Stan
ford had its chances in that game, with
three runners getting thrown out at the
plate.
"We should have won the second game

[against Cull and just fell a little short,"
said senior third baseman Amanda
Renteria. "And I think that will be one of
the things that motivates us. 1 know I feel
like we got cheated out of a game."
Stanford had been playing well prior
to its April 12 encounter with the Bears,
having split with then-No. 2 UCLA and
having taken three out of four games
from the Oregon schools. But the Card
had its momentum suddenly snapped by
a hard-hitting Cal team that produced 18
runs in the two games.
It was one of the few series this season
in which the pitching staff got rocked.
The Cardinal pitching has shown few
signs of weariness or weakness, and the
squad's defense has continued to lessen
the number of errors that it allows.
"I would say it's probably our most
important game," Renteria said. "In gen
eral this weekend is the most important
weekend for us, and it starts with Cal and
building momentum. Cal is one of the
teams we're competing against for a spot
[at regionals), so it's crucial to play well
against them."
Stanford definitely brings momentum
into today's game. After taking two
games apiece from Santa Clara and St
Mary's by impressive scores last Friday

and Saturday, the Card played some of its
best softball of the season as it sUiyed
close to No. 1 Arizona on Sunday.
Offensively, the team has improved
since its previous meeting with Cal. The
Cardinal hasoutscored opponents U6-9 in
its last six games and is showing signs of
ofTensive consistency that it hits been
searching for all season. Several players
on the team have stepp<>d up their offen
sive contributions as of late, and sopho
more offensive stars Marcy Crouch and
Michelle Schneider have continued to
provide solid games at the plate.
The key to Stanford's success may Ik
whether it can put up runs early. The
team has had the most trouble producing
runs in conference games, especially in
the later innings.
"I think the fact that we did play Ari
zona close and beat both Santa Clara and
St. Mary's gives us momentum," Rente
ria said. "Just knowing wo played the No.
1 team that close gives us confidence.
"Stanford soflball, in general, is fight
ing for respect. And if we continue to play
the No. 1 team close and beat Cal and
Washington and Oregon I we'll get that I. I
think we've been underrated all year
long, so it's important it's a respect
issue."
