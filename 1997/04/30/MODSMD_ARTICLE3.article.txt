# Asia / Pacific scholars program to begin fall quarter
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
Fall quarter will herald the inau
gural year of the Asia / Pacific Schol
ars Program, which will benefit gradu
ate students whose studies involve
Asia. The two-to-three year program,
which University President Gerhard
Casper first suggested in 1994, is in
tended to be similar to the Rhodes
Scholarship.
Michel Oksenberg, a senior fellow

in the Institute for International
Studies, said, "When I joined Stan
ford, I found that [Casper and 11 had a
similar vision — namely to nurture a
sense of the emerging Pacific commu
nity among a talented group of Stan
ford graduate students.
"By that, we mean on the substan
tive side, a knowledge about diverse cul
tures of the region and the underlying
dynamics of economic, technological,
political and social change," Oksenberg
added. "In the nonsubstantive side, we

want to enable this group to form
friendships that will last a lifetime."
The program aims to bring people
together from diverse parts of the Uni
versity to focus on various aspects of
Asian culture through lectures and
readings. The first year of the program
will be more academically rigorous; in
the second year, participants will act
as mentors to incoming scholars.
The program initially will accept 20
Asia / Pacific scholars. Five or six will
be first-year doctoral or master's stu

dents from China or Hong Kong.
About, 10 will be already-enrolled
graduate students from Asian coun
tries, and as many as live will bo cur
rent Stanford graduate students wbo
plan to pursue careers that involve
Asia. Members of the latter group may
be enrolled in any one of Stanford's
seven graduate schools.
Oksenberg, wbo chairs the inter
departmental committee which helped
shape the scholars program, said
the details have been decided on
by an interdepartmental commit
tee with representatives appoint
ed by the deans of every school,
donors and the Board of Trustees.
The eventual goal of the pro
gram is to have full scholarships
for all participants. Steve Suda, a
development officer, is heading
the effort to raise $50 million in
endowment funds. So far, the pro
gram has raised about $8 million,
according to Oksenberg.

"We have succeeded in raising
money for full scholarships for
the Chinese participants through
the generosity of several people in
Hong Kong," Oksenberg said.
"We have not yet raised money for
full scholarships for students
from elsewhere, including the
United States. Those students
will receive a more modest
stipend. Hopefully, they will be
interested in applying because of
the enormous benefits that can be
derived, as well as the prestige."
Oksenberg added that the com
mittee is in the midst of securing
applications from various schools
within the University to fill the
non-Chinese student slots. "If we

end up strictly with people who
are already familiar with the
(Asia / Pacific] area, then we have
not gotten exactly the group di
versity" originally aimed for, he
said.
The program is not a degree
program in and of itself. Instead,
it is intended to be a supplemental
program for graduate students in
their intended fields, Oksenberg
said. Students who are interested
should apply to their chosen de
partments.
