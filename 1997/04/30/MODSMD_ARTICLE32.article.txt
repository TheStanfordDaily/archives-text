# Talisman wins championship
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
After performing at the Olympics, where's the
best place for Talisman's next big show? The answer
turned out to be Carnegie Hall.
After the group won the college a cappella West
ern Division semifinal round at Brigham Young Uni
versity Feb. 20, it went on to compete at the finals,
which were held at Carnegie Hall in New York last
weekend. Once there, the group seized first place at
the National Championship of College A Cappella
competition.
Participating groups hailed from the University
of North Carolina, the University of Illinois, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, Brown University and
Boston University.
Talisman member Paolo Resmini, a freshman,
credited the group's victory in part to its repertoire of
traditional African and African-American songs.
Talisman's genre of music made the group stand out
among other competitors, who sang the more usual
"East Coast style a cappella" of oldies and pop music,
Resmini said.
"I think it came down to originality," he said.
Maybe the repertoire "pushed us over. It's powerful
music."
The victory was especially rewarding in light of
the fact that Talisman has been penalized in the past
for its unconventional style. They have previously
encountered problems resulting from having a
Congo drum accompaniment, junior Kamron Hack
said. Some people thought this violated the rule of a
cappella — that only voices are used.
This year, Talisman performed without its drum
mer.
"I was shocked when we won," said sophomore
Lisa Anfield, one of the group's managers. "It really

hasn't sunk in yet. We are all really excited."
The group received a standing ovation after its
performance of three African songs and one African-
American spiritual. The set is the same one Talisman
performed at the Stanford a cappella competition
earlier this year.
After winning, the group sang an encore —
"Babe than daza," a South African chant that re
peats the phrase, "Our mothers, women of old, used
to pray. Things are as they are now because of
prayer."
The championship, members said, was not fo
cused on competition among groups but was "an op
portunity to share music with more people," Hack
said. After the performance, Talisman members
went out to dinner with No Strings Attached, the
group from Illinois.
Members also had the opportunity to go to Cen
tral Park and meet singer Bobby McFerrin, whose
influence has broadened the genre of a cappella,
Hack said.
Members of the group credited relatives and
friends as helping relieve their nervousness while
singing in front of the nearly sold-out audience.
Hack, the soloist for the spiritual "When I Die To
morrow," said, "I was nervous, but no more than
usual because of the support of my family."
"We are grateful for the support from a cappella
groups on campus, Talisman alumni and (Vice
Provost for Student Affairs) Mary Edmonds, who
helped us with funding and support," Hack added.
Talisman received a trophy and $2,000. The
singers plan to use the money to record their
fourth album, due out next year, and to fund a fu
ture East Coast tour.
The Stanford community will have a chance to see
the award-winning group perform at its spring show
May 21.
