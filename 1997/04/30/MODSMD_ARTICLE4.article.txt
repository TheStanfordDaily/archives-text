# Casper answers ASSU questions
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate did a lot of talking at its meeting
last night, passing six bills, but the meeting's most no
table moments came when the group was listening.
University President Gerhard Casper and ASSU
Elections Commissioner Ghazal Badiozamani ad
dressed the senate last night; the former to answer
senators' questions and the latter to give a report on
the 1997 ASSU Spring General Election.
Casper began his remarks by congratulating the
senate on passing the new judicial charter. Students
ratified the charter by a wide margin in the April 16-
17 election.
If the charter is approved by the Faculty Senate to
morrow, Casper said he will give it final approval. "It
represents an important change in the role of stu
dents at Stanford University," he said.
Casper then fielded student questions that focused
on four areas: graduate student issues, student input
on the Board of Trustees, administrative response to
campus hate crimes and concerns of student skate
boarders.
Addressing several questions posed by graduate
students, Casper promised to study terminal gradu
ate registration requirements, pricing of University
graduate housing, funding for doctoral students in
the School of Humanities and Sciences and more
parking spaces to replace those eliminated by con
struction. He also said the University is upgrading the
equipment in the Arrillaga Family Sports Center
weight room.
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson asked
Casper about his stance on increased student input
on the Board of Trustees, specifically focusing on the
three questions put before students in the spring
election. Casper said students need to put more
thought and discussion into the issue, pointing out

that students are already represented on board com
mittees.
Casper also promised to investigate the implemen
tation of a law that makes skateboarding inside the
Campus Drive loop a misdemeanor.
In a brief report on the spring election, Badioza
mani focused on the actions of the Hearings Commit
tee. The committee met Monday to informally inves
tigate allegations of campaign finance violations by
President-elect Emily Andrus and Vice president
elect Ben Decker, Badiozamani said, but "they decid
ed there was not enough evidence to bring any
charges."
After hearing the two speakers, the senate turned
to legislative matters, passing six bills. The measures
included two bylaw changes, three allocations of
funds and a motion to ask the University to create a
committee to examine its relationship with the Re
serve Officers Training Corps.
The first by-law "patch" removed several outdated
references to the Council of Presidents. After several
minutes of debate, the senate removed a provision
from the bill that would have mandated that write-in
votes be tabulated only if they are cast for Stanford
students. That move effectively means that protest
votes cast for nonstudents will count toward final
election tallies.
The second bylaw change clears up a procedural
ambiguity that will allow the senate to certify the
spring election at next week's meeting by removing a
clause that required a vote on certification to occur at
the meeting following validation. The bylaws also
stipulated that certification must take place two
weeks after va 1 lation.
Controvert,, arose because last night's meeting,
the first after va. dation, took place only a week after
validation. The new provision allows certification to
take place at any meeting two to four weeks after val
idation.
