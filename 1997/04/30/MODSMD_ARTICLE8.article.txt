Opposing Zairian leaders to meet
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Mobutu Sese Seko
assured a U.S. ambassador yesterday that he is
ready to meet with the rebel leader who controls
half of Zaire, but the envoy did not say whether
he was trying to arrange the president's graceful
exit from power.
"There can be no military solution to this cri
sis. President Mobutu and rebel leader (Laurent)
Kabila must meet face-to-face without delay," Bill
Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said after an hour-long meeting at Mobu
tu's hilltop palace in the Zairian capital.
"President Mobutu assured me he is ready to
meet Mr. Kabila immediately," Richardson said.
Kabila, too, is ready for a meeting, his foreign
minister, Bizima Karaha, said in the southern city
of Lubumbashi. The meeting will take place "some
where in the Atlantic Ocean," he said, apparently
indicating acceptance of a South African offer to

provide a naval ship for the meeting.
"We are not going there to discuss a cease
fire," Karaha said. "We are going there to discuss
the end of the war — a complete end of the war
— and a complete end of the war can only come
about when the man who brought the war is no
longer there."
AIDS vaccine successful in chimps
NEW YORK (AP) - An experimental AIDS
vaccine made from HIV genes has protected chim
panzees for more than a year, raising doctors'
hopes the approach will work in humans.
Two chimps got the vaccine and then a stiff
dose of HIV — 250 times the amount needed for
infection.
It's the first time that a so-called DNA vaccine
has squared off against HIV in chimps.
"We're encouraged but cautious," said David B.
Weiner, senior author of the study.
