ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. (AP) -
A drill instructor was convicted yesterday of raping
six women trainees in the most serious case yet to
come out of the sex scandal that has rocked the
Army.
Staff Sgt. Delmar G. Simpson, 32, could get life in
prison for his conviction on 18 of 19 rape counts.
The 6-foot-4 soldier stood at attention, unflinch
ing, as the verdicts were read in rapid-fire succes
sion by the head of the military jury. Simpson, who
has been behind bars since his arrest in September,
left the courtroom holding hands with his wife, who
is stationed at an Army post in Virginia.
Prosecutors said Simpson raped the women while
he was a drill sergeant at Aberdeen in 1995 and
1996, mostly by intimidating them with his size, his
superior rank and implied threats of harm or pun
ishment. One trainee said Simpson threatened to

kill her if she told about having sex with him.
Women's advocates — who considered the court
martial a test of how serious the Army is about sex
ual misconduct — said the case underscores the
need for an independent review of how the military
handles such complaints.
"I think there's a lot of denial going on in the sys
tem and a lot of minimization," said Karen Johnson,
a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and vice presi
dent of the National Organisation for Women.
The jury of five men and one woman, all of supe
rior rank, will decide Simpson's sentence after hear
ing additional testimony, beginning Monday.
Simpson already has pleaded guilty to having
consensual sex with 11 trainees, including five of the
rape victims. He could get up to 32 years in prison
on those charges and five sexual-harassment offens
es he admitted.
