Chelsea Clinton is coming to
Stanford for good.
After a brief weekend visit to the
Farm, her mother's press office an
nounced in a brief statement that
the Clintons' only daughter will
matriculate at Stanford in Septem
ber.
"The president and Mrs. Clin
ton announced today that their
daughter Ch2lsea will enter Stan
ford University this fall as a mem
ber of the Class of 2001," the terse
statement said.
Clinton, 17, is a National Merit
semifinalist and standout student
at Maryland's Sidwell Friends
School. She hopes eventually to
study medicine.
She will become the second
child of a sitting president to at
tend Stanford. President Herbert
1 loover's son Allan, Class of' 29 at
tended Stanford while his father,
himself a Stanford alumnus, was
president.
Aside from the statement, the

Clintons declined to make any fur
ther comment on the decision.
Throughout her father's four
years in office, aides have attempt
ed to preserve Chelsea Clinton's
privacy as much as possible.
"The Clintons have asked us to
be respectful of Chelsea's privacy
and that's what we're trying to
do," said Neel Lattimore, Mrs.
Clinton's press secretary.
A friend of Chelsea Clinton said
yesterday that the first daughter
likely would not comment because
she hopes to be treated like a regu
lar student.
Although Stanford was always
under consideration, Clinton was
expected to study closer to home.
In addition to Stanford, more than
3,000 miles away from the White
House, Clinton also considered
Princeton, Yale and Brown univer
sities.
"Planes run out there and
phones work out there. E-mail
works out there, so we'll be all
right," the President said yester
day.
Stanford officials were equally

surprised to learn that Clinton vis
ited campus over the weekend,
sparking hopes that she would at
tend. While at Stanford, she at
tended a dance concert and a fra
ternity party and purchased a Boy
senberry Bliss from Jamba Juice.
