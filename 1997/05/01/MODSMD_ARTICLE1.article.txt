## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Chelsea Clinton is coming to
Stanford for good.
After a brief weekend visit to the
Farm, her mother's press office an
nounced in a brief statement that
the Clintons' only daughter will
matriculate at Stanford in Septem
ber.
"The president and Mrs. Clin
ton announced today that their
daughter Ch2lsea will enter Stan
ford University this fall as a mem
ber of the Class of 2001," the terse
statement said.
Clinton, 17, is a National Merit
semifinalist and standout student
at Maryland's Sidwell Friends
School. She hopes eventually to
study medicine.
She will become the second
child of a sitting president to at
tend Stanford. President Herbert
1 loover's son Allan, Class of' 29 at
tended Stanford while his father,
himself a Stanford alumnus, was
president.
Aside from the statement, the

Clintons declined to make any fur
ther comment on the decision.
Throughout her father's four
years in office, aides have attempt
ed to preserve Chelsea Clinton's
privacy as much as possible.
"The Clintons have asked us to
be respectful of Chelsea's privacy
and that's what we're trying to
do," said Neel Lattimore, Mrs.
Clinton's press secretary.
A friend of Chelsea Clinton said
yesterday that the first daughter
likely would not comment because
she hopes to be treated like a regu
lar student.
Although Stanford was always
under consideration, Clinton was
expected to study closer to home.
In addition to Stanford, more than
3,000 miles away from the White
House, Clinton also considered
Princeton, Yale and Brown univer
sities.
"Planes run out there and
phones work out there. E-mail
works out there, so we'll be all
right," the President said yester
day.
Stanford officials were equally

surprised to learn that Clinton vis
ited campus over the weekend,
sparking hopes that she would at
tend. While at Stanford, she at
tended a dance concert and a fra
ternity party and purchased a Boy
senberry Bliss from Jamba Juice.

"Certainly it doesn't hurt when
someone this prominent and well
qualified chooses Stanford over all
of her other choices," said Terry
Shepard, director of University
Communications. "But you could
say that of all our students."
When news of her furtive cam
pus visit reached Washington
Tuesday, the press corps demand
ed that Mike McCurry, the White
House press secretary, confirm
Stanford was Clinton's choice. He
declined all comment until yester
day.
The White House called Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper late
Tuesday.
The University yesterday said it
was pleased with Clinton's decision
and will make every opportunity
for her to be a "regular Stanford
student."
"We start by treating her the
same as everybody else," Shepard
said. The University does not com
ment about specific admissions de
cisions.
Today is the official deadline for
responding to Stanford's admis
sions offer.
The weekend visit was Clinton's
second to campus. Clinton and her
mother took a campus tour and
met with three administrators in
November. Clinton made second
visits to two other campuses beside
Stanford.

At her weekend visit, students
report hat two Secret Service
agents provided security for Clin
ton at a distance.
The Secret Service declined to
comment on any security proce
dures for Clinton next year. The
agency will work with Stanford's
Department of Public Safety,
Shepard said.
The Secret Service presence
should not have an effect on more
than Clinton's dormitory, howev
er. Should Clinton attend a party
where alcohol is being served to
minors, Secret Service agents
would not take action, as they are
only responsible for federal offens
es. Both minor in possession and
sale of alcohol to minors are state
offenses.
"There's an amazing amount of
discretion given to Secret Service
agents," said William Clancy, spe
cial assistant to the chief counsel of
the Secret Service.
Clinton will be the most high
profile student to come to Stanford
in recent years. Other students in
clude junior Fred Savage and Tiger
Woods. Although both received
wide-eyed stares at first, their rela
tions with other students quickly
normalized.
Aside from security, however,
Shepard does not expect much to
change with Clinton's arrival.
"If Stanford were unknown,
something like this would change
everything," Shepard said. "This
will have some effect in some ways
that remains to be seen."
