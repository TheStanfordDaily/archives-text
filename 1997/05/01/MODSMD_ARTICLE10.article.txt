## Britain: Election day arrives 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Someone has to lose
Britain's national election today: the governing
Conservatives or the pollsters.
Tony Blair's Labor party ended the campaign
with a fat lead in the polls, while Prime Minister
John Major gamely struggled to convince voters
there was still hope for his Conservatives.
"I understand why some people find the argu
ment for change attractive," Major said yesterday
at the start of a last day of dogged campaigning.
"Eighteen years is a long time . . . and it's easy to
overlook the achievements."
Blair told a rally in Stockton-on-Tees: "The
pundits may have written this election off and
said it's all over, the media may say that, the
Tories may have given up, but I tell you, this elec
tion is not over until it is over."
At six weeks, it was the longest British cam
paign in memory. Major's calculation was that
Labor would crack under the pressure, and that a
growing, low-inflation economy would spread
cheer among wavering voters.

Throughout the campaign, however, the polls
have shown a strong tide running against a Conser
vative Party that has won the last four elections and
dramatically changed the British political landscape
since Margaret Thatcher's first win in 1979.
The polls showed Labor ahead five years ago,
too, but not on the scale of recent surveys: three
opinion polls published yesterday put the Labor
lead at 18, 20 or 22 points. Give or take the 3 per
centage points in the margin of error, Labor's lead
was securely in double digits.
Only one poll in the campaign fanned Conserva
tive hopes — an ICM survey for The Guardian
newspaper a week ago pegging Labor's lead at 5
points.
Major, 54, who seemed relaxed and confident as
he roamed the country, scrapped some of the party's
prepared television broadcasts to put himself in
front of the camera, speaking in the soil tones of a
doctor pleading with an unreasonable patient.
Blair, 43, an edgy performer and nervous at the
start, radiated energy and determination at the end.
