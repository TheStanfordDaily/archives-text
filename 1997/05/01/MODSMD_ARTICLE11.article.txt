# U.N. airlifts Zaire refugees

KISANGANI, Zaire (AP) â€” The United Nations
flew 236 children home to Rwanda yesterday after
rebels unexpectedly dumped truck- and trainloads
of sick and hungry refugees on unprepared aid
workers in Kisangani.
"This is chaos," U.N. refugee spokesman Kilian
Kleinschmidt said of the refugees' sudden arrival
from camps in northeastern Zaire. "As far as I know,
we could have 10,000 people here tomorrow "
After weeks of balking at United Nations plans
for the biggest refugee airlift ever attempted in
Africa, the rebels are now pressing to complete the
operation in 60 days.
The first flight of 186 refugee children reached
Kigali, the Rwandan capital, yesterday afternoon,
followed by a second flight of 50 more children.
U.N. workers hoped to fly 1,200 more refugees
home today.
Aid workers were shocked when the rebels began
bringing hundreds of sickly refugees to Kisangani
on trucks and trains from refugee camps south of
the city.
The rebels, who have taken control of the eastern
half of Zaire in a seven-month campaign to oust Pres
ident Mobutu Sese Seko, have given the United
Nations a 60-day deadline to get the 80,000 Rwandan
refugees south of Kisangani back home.
"They want repatriation, but under their rules,"
said Pierce Gerety, a top U.N. representative in
Kisangani. "We are happy (that the airlift has start
ed) but not necessarily in the way it is being carried
out."
Last week, the refugees fled into the jungle when
Zairian mobs attacked them, reportedly killing

hundreds. Rebels sealed off the area to aid workers
for nearly a week, making it impossible to bring in
food or medicine. Some refugees say rebel troops
fired into the camps.
Faced with mounting evidence of massacres,
rebel chief Laurent Kabila assured U.S. envoy Bill
Richardson that anyone found responsible for
killings would be punished.
Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, toured a transit camp yesterday near Kisnn
gani. He appeared visibly distraught at the sight of a
refugee mother still clinging to her dead baby.
The U.S. envoy then headed to Kinshasa, the cap
ital, and announced that Mobutu and Kabila would
meet tomorrow on a South African naval ship for
talks chaired by the United Nations and attended by
other African presidents.
"This is an historic occasion that hopefully will
lead to peace in Zaire," Richardson told reporters
after meeting with Mobutu.
Thousands of refugees emerged from hiding in
Zaire's dense forests only to find there was little food
or medicine yesterday. Before they fled the camps, 60
refugees a day were dying from starvation and dis
eases as malaria and cholera.
Kleinschmidt said all the U.N. trucks in the region
were being used to transport refugees from Kisangani
to the airport, leaving none to take food to the camps.
Brenda Barton of the World Food Program said
the situation was desperate at Biaro, 25 miles south
of Kisangani, where at least 1 (),()()() refugees have
gathered in the last few days.
"People are definitely in desperate need of food.
They were fighting over biscuits," she said.
