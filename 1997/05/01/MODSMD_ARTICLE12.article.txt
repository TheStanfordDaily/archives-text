# Scientists create 'supermice'
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — With a single genetic switch,
scientists have created a strain of supermice two to
three times more muscular than usual, with hig,
broad shoulders and massive hips.
The genetically altered giants can't outpace
speeding locomotives or leap much of anything in a
single bound. But their creators believe the mice
could spur a revolution in the treatment of muscu
lar dystrophy and similar diseases and perhaps even
transform the livestock industry, where bigger mus
cles would mean more meat.
The supermice were made by Se-Jin Lee, Alexan
dra McPherron and Ann Lawler, molecular biologists
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in
Baltimore. The researchers created the mice by delet
ing a single gene that appears to limit muscle growth.
"They do look a little strange," McPherron said.
She and her colleagues describe the mice in today's
issue of Nature, a British scientific journal.
Though they seem stronger than their peers, the
supermice are gentle giants. "When I poke them
they don't run away as fast as a normal mouse,"
McPherron said Tuesday. "They don't seem to be
bothered by it."
Aside from their musculature, the mice are physi

cally identical to their scrawnier kin.
The Hopkins scientists created the burly beasts by
knocking out the gene for a growth factor they discov
ered. Growth factors are proteins that either stimu
late or suppress the growth and division of certain cell
tyjx\s, such as bone or nerve — or muscle.
It turns out the growth factor the Hopkins
researchers found, myostatin, inhibits muscle growth.
The researchers found that out as soon as they saw
the mice they had bred without the gene.
The result — totally buff. And promising.
Drugs could bo developed that block the action of
myostatin, for example. Those drugs might coun
teract some of the muscle wasting that occurs in
diseases such as muscular dystrophy and cachexia,
a muscular deterioration that accompanies AIDS
and some forms of cancer.
The researchers still haven't shown that
humans and other animals also have the mouse
myostatin. They hayen't shown that blocking the
action of the protein has the same effect as geneti
cally preventing its creation. And they haven't
shown that bulking up muscle mass by blocking
myostatin would actually help people with muscu
lar dystrophy and other diseases.
