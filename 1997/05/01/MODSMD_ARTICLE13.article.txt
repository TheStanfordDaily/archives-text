Plan for merger of IDPs
must be considered with
input from students

Economics prof. Roger
Noll, director of the Public
Policy Program, recently
announced that a proposal has
been made to integrate his pro
gram with the Urban Studies
Program, the International Rela
tions Program and the Interna
tional Policy Studies Program in
order to increase their individual
resources and maintain their
strength in the face of cutbacks
affecting interdisciplinary pro
grams.
While it is unclear what this
plan will even look like — let
alone what the particulars of
Noll's suggestion might mean for
the independence of these pro
grams — it is imperative that
Noll and those who eventually
might work on this consolidation
issue learn from the recent
brouhaha about the Science,
Technology and Society Pro
gram's future.
So far, it seems he has: Noll's
early announcement will provide
both the time and the opportuni
ty for proper handling of the pro
posal.
While there is not enough
information available yet to judge
the merit of his idea, there is cer
tainly room for comment on how
to proceed.
Of top concern to the students
of these four programs, one of
which — international policy
studies — is a graduate program,
is their stability, in terms of both
content and individuality. It
wasn't long ago that STS nearly
saw its demise due to a lack of
resources. What was most fright
ening about that crisis was the
program suffered no shortage of
student interest whatsoever. It is
that perplexing logic — that pop

ular programs facing resource
dilemmas should be cut further
— that Noll and company should
guard against.
In this sense, the program
directors are hedging their bets
with this proposal. With a greater
base of resources for all four pro
grams, Noll hopes to free up more
resources to dedicate to those
students who are currently and
who might potentially be
involved.
After last year's STS crisis, the
ASSU Senate passed a resolution
that such weighty decisions
should never be made without
first consulting the students who
would be affected. This resolu
tion should be enforced through
out the planning process on the
consolidation of these interdisci
plinary programs.
Will the new integrated
"super-IDP" combine all four
into one comprehensive pro
gram?
There's no telling what effect
this will have on the identity of
the programs. It would be unfor
tunate to have the choices be sim
plified to only one major with dif
ferent concentrations. The pro
grams might be able to share a
common core, each certainly has
its own flavor and this should not
be lost throughout the process,
especially given the academic and
professional excellence all four
programs enjoy. Defining an inte
grated entity for these four pro
grams is a monumental task with
serious repercussions.
Noll's proposal has prompted
several questions that can't be
answered at this point, and the
proposed consolidation is not set
in stone — right now it is simply
an option to develop and consider.
Nevertheless, it is the responsi
bility of all involved to incorpo
rate student participation into
the planning process, not only to
make their voices heard but also
to ensure a smooth and fair tran
sition process if this proposal
becomes formal.
