CALL ME A FOOL, but I believe in
the goodness of man. Call me sim
ple-minded, but I see decency on
the rise. But whatever you do, don't call
me ignorant, for I am aware of all that is
yet to be accomplished.
These past two weeks at Stanford, we
have been witness to the blackest cancer
of our community: prejudice. Hate
crimes in any form mark a malignancy in
our society, a tumor waiting to be radiat
ed out of our system. And I think a
majority of us here at Stanford are
aware of this fact.
Needless to say, when The Daily accus
es me and my fellow Stanfordites of out
and out indifference, tarring and feather
ing us with the title "Apathetic," I take
great offense and wish to know how the
editors of our mainstream newspaper
have come to such a conclusion.
Because I do not shout aloud in White
Plaza, I do not care? Because I do not
write a passionately charged letter to
The Daily, I have no concern? To charge
us with apathy because we do not show
our anger is just as ignorant as the mes
sages contained in the vandalism that

has plagued this campus.
As members of academia we must
choose our words carefully. Otherwise,
we risk proliferation of a skewed self
perception. I cannot count the number of
times someone has said Stanford stu
dents are apathetic. Politically unmoti
vated, perhaps. Too busy to become
involved, maybe. But all these descrip
tions and more have been replaced and
codified into one concept: apathy. It was
even the title of a student-written musi
cal a few years back.
The Daily accuses us of not being
"enraged at these crimes of insensitivity
and weakness." I take it that The Daily
has an ongoing Gallup Poll on campus to
determine who does and does not have
these feelings. Or perhaps we are just a
little too quick to label students as apa
thetic every time there isn't a mass out
cry or hundreds of letters pouring into
The Daily's mailbox.
You might ask, "How can I tell you
care if you don't do anything?" Isn't lis
tening an action? Or learning to under
stand? When we stop and watch 300 peo
ple in White Plaza holding hands in a
social message of pride and celebration,
are we not active participants in observ
ing this ritual? Even if we can only stop
briefly on our way to class?
If everyone stood on a soap box, who
would be left on the sidewalk to listen?
It is true: We all have our own agen
das at this school. We all have homework

to do, activities to partake and places to
be. But let us not belittle the capacity of
our minds or emotions by saying that
with all these things to do there is no
room left for concern or thought in
response to these hate crimes.
At a pre-eminent school like ours any
action will almost certainly have a reac
tion to it. But in a community like ours
not everyone has the actual time or ener
gy to be involved in every protest or pub
lic gathering he or she supports. Some
times all that can be accomplished is
signing a petition, or a kind word in pass
ing expressing support or sympathy.
These actions may not be as grand or
publicly effective as a mass protest, but
we cannot — and we should not — deny
them their importance. One person's
supportive remarks to a friend is just as
important as 100 people saying the same
thing to a community.
If you take a look at the beginning of
this column, you'll see the synonyms and
antonyms for apathy. I put them there as
a reminder of what the word actually
means and implies. After all, we wouldn't
want to be apathetic about what we're
talking about here, now would we?

drama and communication, wishes his
sister a happy 17th birthday.
