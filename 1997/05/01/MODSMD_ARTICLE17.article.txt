Women and gays aren't the only victims of harassment

IT IS UNFORTUNATE that a few
bad seeds in society always have to
rock the boat and create controver
sy. The recent outcry by the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community against
hate crimes is a prime example of what
a few individuals can create.
Yes, hate is wrong, but is that really
the issue? I think the real problem, the
real issue, is people feeling violated. As
usual, in this instance the actions of a
few persons violated the rights and feel
ings of a large group.
But the gay community is not the

only group that gets violated. I am on
the Stanford wrestling team, and we
are constantly being harassed, not only
sexually but politically as well. We have
been targeted and tagged by the gay
community as a gang of homophobes.
Unfortunately, their community sees
only one side of the story, the actions of
a few bad seeds.
I am writing this letter because on
April 21a want ad in The Daily was a
blatant violation of my rights as a
human and as an athlete. The ad called
for Stanford wrestlers between the ages

of 18 and 23 who would like to receive a
number of different sexual acts from a
gay man.
This was totally uncalled for and
should have never been allowed to be
printed.
If I were to run a similar ad, asking
for these same sexual acts from a spe
cific women's athletic team, it would be
politically incorrect. This is plain and
simple sexual harassment.
How can The Daily have the audacity
to write editorials denouncing hate
then run an ad such as this one? I can

only look at that ad and wonder why
people perform crimes of "hate." Maybe
they are provoked. The entire story
needs to be told. Sure, these gay indi
viduals that harass us are only a few
bad seeds. But it looks like that is
enough to rock the boat.
Congratulations, Daily! You have
contributed to the spread of hate and
violated human rights by allowing such
an ad to run. From now on be journal
ists, not endorsers for causes.
