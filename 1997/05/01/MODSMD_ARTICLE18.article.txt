# Daily editorial underestimated the value of Monday's hate protest
## 
### 
On Monday, the largest student
protest of the year took place in White
Plaza. It was a wonderful vocalization of
outrage about a recent spate of hate
crimes on campus. The Daily responded
with an editorial Tuesday decrying apa
thy over the issue.
After remarking sarcastically about
some of the more visible and successful
student campaigns on campus this year,
the editorial ended with: "You will have
to retreat from your holes of self-interest
if you still believe that a campus commu
nity can exist without fear and attacks in
the night. That's assuming you still
want that. That's assuming you care."
It is absurd to criticize good cam
paigns simply because a new campaign
is needed. It is even more absurd when
that needed campaign (i.e., the one to
protest hate crimes) already exists in
spectacular fashion. "Hole of self-inter
est" seems a better description of The
Daily than of student life.
