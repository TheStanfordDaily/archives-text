It began at 7:26 a.m.
"Chelsea Clinton, 17, will attend Stanford Univer
sity, White House says," The Associated Press re
ported in a news alert usually reserved for key leg
islative votes and breaking news.
But for the national media and the White House
press corps, this was breaking news.
In the next 34 minutes, more than 24 people called
the University Communications office, clamoring for
University spokesman Terry Shepard to say some
thing like, "Yeah, we think it's awesome and really
cool that Chelsea decided to come out West. Like,
she's the daughter of the president."
Instead Shepard, with a three-line statement in

hand, sat down with reporters, gave television inter
views and did the radio talk show circuit from Cali
fornia to Pennsylvania the entire day yesterday, try
ing to reiterate the statement in as many different
ways as he could.
"You better not flunk out the president's daugh
ter," one Regis-and-Kathy-Lee-like talk show host
said, hoping Shepard would respond, "actually, part
of the offer is all As every quarter."
"I said, 'warning accepted' and went on to the next
question," Shepard said.
CNN was the first to arrive. Then the local news
stations. Then the national gang.
By 11 a.m., there were more television dishes in
the Oval than people, and students walking to class

Television crews from Good Morning America visited Stanford yesterday to interview students, includ

had to avoid more media members
than bikes.
The frenzy was the biggest sin
gle-day total in the last decade.
Shepard received 99 phone calls be
tween 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. He
gave seven television interviews
and had journalists in his office
until the doors were locked at 5
p.m.
All for a 17-year-old freshman
to-be.
News media flocked to various
points on campus including White
Plaza, Tresidder Union and The
Daily office to interview students.
"A lot of the editors and writers
here are baby boomers with kids

making college choices," Shepard
said, adding that there have been
several stories in mayor newspa
pers on making college decisions
and paying for college.
Let's not forget, though, that
this one involved the daughter of
the president of the United States.
Shepard finally saw a positive
story about Stanford hit the na
tional wires that was not generat
ed by University Communica
tions. And he couldn't even com
ment on it.
"We are very pleased that
Chelsea will attend Stanford,"
Shepard's statement read. Oh,
we're more than pleased. But, of
course, if he said, "We're seriously
psyched she's coming," there
probably would have been 10 more
East Coast editors sending re
porters out to the Farm.
