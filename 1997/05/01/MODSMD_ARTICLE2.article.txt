It began at 7:26 a.m.
"Chelsea Clinton, 17, will attend Stanford Univer
sity, White House says," The Associated Press re
ported in a news alert usually reserved for key leg
islative votes and breaking news.
But for the national media and the White House
press corps, this was breaking news.
In the next 34 minutes, more than 24 people called
the University Communications office, clamoring for
University spokesman Terry Shepard to say some
thing like, "Yeah, we think it's awesome and really
cool that Chelsea decided to come out West. Like,
she's the daughter of the president."
Instead Shepard, with a three-line statement in

hand, sat down with reporters, gave television inter
views and did the radio talk show circuit from Cali
fornia to Pennsylvania the entire day yesterday, try
ing to reiterate the statement in as many different
ways as he could.
"You better not flunk out the president's daugh
ter," one Regis-and-Kathy-Lee-like talk show host
said, hoping Shepard would respond, "actually, part
of the offer is all As every quarter."
"I said, 'warning accepted' and went on to the next
question," Shepard said.
CNN was the first to arrive. Then the local news
stations. Then the national gang.
By 11 a.m., there were more television dishes in
the Oval than people, and students walking to class
