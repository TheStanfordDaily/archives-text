## Stanford softball splits with Bears 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
The Cardinal settled for a split
against 24th-ranked California in
two exciting softball games yester
day at Stanford. The Cardinal
remains at .500 overall after los
ing the first game 1-0 in eight
innings before taking a 2-1 victory
in the late contest.
In the first game, Stanford (25-
25-1, 6-16 Pacific 10 Conference)
saw a strong pitching perfor
mance by sophomore Becky
Blevins (12-15) wasted, as she
pitched a complete game, striking
out five and allowing one walk. It
was a tough loss for Blevins and
the team, considering the oppor
tunities the Cardinal had at sever
al points in the game to bring in a
run.
Cal first baseman Melanie
McCart singled in the eighth, and
a sacrifice, passed ball by Stanford
sophomore catcher Kellie Wigin
ton and base hit by second base
man Lisa lane in gave the Golden
Bears (30-22, 9-12) the win.
"It's tough losing a close game
like that, especially when we had
some good chances to win the
game," said head coach John
Rittman. "We had to make sure
we didn't get emotionally down
after the first game. We chal
lenged ourselves to come out and
win the second one."
The . team responded to
Rittman's challenge, providing
enough runs to support the
superb pitching of sophomore
Marcy Crouch.
A solo home run in the first
inning by Wiginton got the Cardi
nal off on the right foot offensive
ly. It answered Cal's lone score on
three singles in the top half of the
inning, and the Cardinal was able
to score again in the second on
foUr base hits, including the
game-winner by junior left fielder
Dawn Kobata.
Going into the sixth inning,
Crouch (13-10) looked like she
was going to cruise to victory. A
hit; or two by Cal players, com
pounded by the umpire Lori

Stolo's sudden stinginess in hand
ing out strikes, made the game
more interesting. In the top of the
sixth, Cal put a runner on second
with one out. An excellent basket
catch reminiscent of Willie Mays
by sophomore center fielder Kelly
Yablonski allowed the Cardinal to
escape the inning with its lead
intact.
After being retired 1-2-3 in the
bottom of the sixth, Stanford took
the field, needing to stop the Bears
in order to take home the victory.
After getting two quick outs, Cal's
Jenny Ackley knocked a solid hit.
With Cal's best hitter to bat,
McCart, Stanford made the deci
sion to intentionally walk her,
moving the tying run into scoring
position.
"McCart is a consensus Ail-
American, and she's had success
against us in the past," Rittman
said. "We decided that we weren't
going to let her beat us."
The choice put runners on first
and second for Cal's next-best hit
ter, starting pitcher Holly Yost. A
solid scouting report showed that
Yost had not been hitting well
recently, and that pitching as fre
quently as she does may be having
an effect on her offensive perfor
mance.
"Yost is a great player, but we
knew that she may have been tir
ing from having to do so much,"
Rittman said.
A beleaguered Yost hit a
grounder to senior third baseman
Amanda Renteria, who made the
play to end the game. It was a solid
performance by the whole team,
satisfying because it was a victory
over Cal and allowed Stanford to
remain hopeful for postseason
play.
"We were really excited to win
the second game against Cal," said
sophomore outfielder Michelle
Acosta. "At the same time, we feel
disappointed that we lost the first
game, especially because we feel
we played better ball."
The split puts Stanford three
games behind Cal in the confer
