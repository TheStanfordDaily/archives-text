# Spikers poised to enter Final Four
## Stanford meets Ball State in semis 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Finally, the day that Stan
ford men's volleyball players,
coaches and fans have been
waiting for all year, if not for
the past five years, is here.
Tonight marks the NCAA Final
Four, with the first match pit
ting the top-ranked and No. 1-
seeded Cardinal against No. 6
and fourth-seeded Ball State at
3 p.m. PDT. The match will be
broadcast live on KZSU, and
highlights will air at 9:30 p.m.
on ESPN2 (STV Channel 53).
The second match features
Penn State, ranked and seeded
second, and the UCLA Bruins,
the nation's third-ranked team
and the team seeded third in
the tournament at 5 p.m. PDT.
The tournament will be held at
St. John Arena on the Ohio
State campus in Columbus,
Ohio. On Saturday at I p.m.
PDT the two semifinal winners
will battle for the national title.
For Stanford (25-3), this
marks the program's third
appearance in the Final Four.
Stanford's other two trips, in
1989 and 1992, both ended in
losses in the national finals.
The Cardinals (27-7) are mak
ing their 14th appearance in the
final four, second only to
UCLA's 20 trips yet are seeking
a win to prevent going 0-14 in

first-round matches in the
Final Four.
If Stanford is to prevent Ball
State from winning its first
ever national semifinal, it will
have to contain the Cardinals'
outstanding senior setter
Eduardo Ferraz, a native of
Brazil. Ferraz has already been
named the Midwest Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association's
player of the year and a first
team All-American. In addition
to these honors, he was a first
team All-American in 199(5 and
a second-teamer in 1995. The
senior will be looking to have a
big match against Stanford in
order to add to these impressive
awards.
"Eddie does it all," said
33rd-ycar Ball State head coach
Don Shondell. "He digs. He
spikes. He blocks. He serves
and, most importantly, he is
extremely intelligent as a set
ter. Eddie can play any position
on the court.
"He is the best passer and is
also one of our best hitters. We
could easily pull Eddie out of
the setting position and into
another if we are having pass
ing problems. Eddie knows
what it is to be a tremendous
leader, and the whole team
knows that he is going to some
how come up with a win."
