# Spikers poised to enter Final Four
## Stanford meets Ball State in semis 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Finally, the day that Stan
ford men's volleyball players,
coaches and fans have been
waiting for all year, if not for
the past five years, is here.
Tonight marks the NCAA Final
Four, with the first match pit
ting the top-ranked and No. 1-
seeded Cardinal against No. 6
and fourth-seeded Ball State at
3 p.m. PDT. The match will be
broadcast live on KZSU, and
highlights will air at 9:30 p.m.
on ESPN2 (STV Channel 53).
The second match features
Penn State, ranked and seeded
second, and the UCLA Bruins,
the nation's third-ranked team
and the team seeded third in
the tournament at 5 p.m. PDT.
The tournament will be held at
St. John Arena on the Ohio
State campus in Columbus,
Ohio. On Saturday at I p.m.
PDT the two semifinal winners
will battle for the national title.
For Stanford (25-3), this
marks the program's third
appearance in the Final Four.
Stanford's other two trips, in
1989 and 1992, both ended in
losses in the national finals.
The Cardinals (27-7) are mak
ing their 14th appearance in the
final four, second only to
UCLA's 20 trips yet are seeking
a win to prevent going 0-14 in

first-round matches in the
Final Four.
If Stanford is to prevent Ball
State from winning its first
ever national semifinal, it will
have to contain the Cardinals'
outstanding senior setter
Eduardo Ferraz, a native of
Brazil. Ferraz has already been
named the Midwest Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association's
player of the year and a first
team All-American. In addition
to these honors, he was a first
team All-American in 199(5 and
a second-teamer in 1995. The
senior will be looking to have a
big match against Stanford in
order to add to these impressive
awards.
"Eddie does it all," said
33rd-ycar Ball State head coach
Don Shondell. "He digs. He
spikes. He blocks. He serves
and, most importantly, he is
extremely intelligent as a set
ter. Eddie can play any position
on the court.
"He is the best passer and is
also one of our best hitters. We
could easily pull Eddie out of
the setting position and into
another if we are having pass
ing problems. Eddie knows
what it is to be a tremendous
leader, and the whole team
knows that he is going to some
how come up with a win."

Four-time All-American Matt Fuerbringer will try to dig up Stan
ford's fourth national title of the year at the Final Four, which
begins today at Columbus, Ohio.
While Ferraz is the center of
the Cardinals' attack, Stanford
will look to attack with a more
balanced offense. All year long
the Cardinal has relied on its
entire starting six to win match
es. This ability to look to differ
ent players on different nights is
one of the major reasons Stan
ford carries a 15-match winning
streak, including 10 wins in
three games.
While Stanford has had no
single star over the course of the
year, senior outside hitter Matt
Fuerbringer has been Stanford's
most exceptional player in the

postseason. One of two four-time
All-Americans in NCAA history,
Fuerbringer was overshadowed
much of the year by Stanford's
other two outside hitters, fellow
senior outside hitter Mike Lam
bert, a second-team All-Ameri
can who returned this year from
the Olympics, and freshman sen
sation Andy Witt. Fuerbringer
admitted that it was a real
adjustment early on.
"I have had to get used to get
ting fewer sets because of Mike
and Andy," Fuerbringer said. "I
have to make the most of the
sets I do get."
In all of Stanford's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation wins,
he has done just that. In Stan
ford's final two wins, in which
the Card avenged earlier losses

to BYU and UCLA, Fuerbringer
collected 34 kills, 16 digs and 10
blocks while hitting .500. This
level of play gained him national
player of the week honors. If he
continues this torrid pace, Stan
ford may be as unbeatable as it
has been in its last 15 matches.
For the six seniors on this
year's team, four of whom are
starters, this is the last chance to
win a national championship.
The team established this as its
goal at the season's outset and,
now that it has only two wins to
go to claim Stanford's first title,
the players are eagerly anticipat
ing today's match.
"I guess you could say that it
has been four long years and
waiting," said senior setter
Stewart Chong.
