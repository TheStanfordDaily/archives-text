# Ultimate prepares for West regionals
## 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
The Stanford men and women's Ultimate
Frisbee teams will be competing at regionals
this weekend. On Saturday, the women will be
playing at Stanford on Roble Field and the men
will be in Santa Cruz. All of Sunday's games
will be played at UC-Santa Cruz.
This region is the most competitive in the
country. For both the men and women, four of
the top five teams in the nation will be at this
tournament. However, this does not seem to

bother Superfly, the women's team, or
Familia, the men's squad.
The women's competition will feature No. 1
Stanford, No. 3 University of British Columbia,
No. 4 California and No. 5 UC-Davis. Only No.
2 Wilmington must compete in the East.
Both teams have high hopes going into
regionals.
"We will be disappointed with anything less
than going undefeated," said men's captain
senior Jim Schoettler.
"If everything goes as planned we should
place first in regionals," senior Martita Emde

said of the women's team.
In preparation for this event, the elders of
La Familia have begun stretching and will con
tinue to take their vitamins. The team has been
tapering for the last couple of weeks, doing less
conditioning so that players can conserve their
energy for the tournament.
The women have been waking up with the
sun Tuesdays to perform their Frisbee rituals.
A\so, they ht\vÂ§ played a scrimmage to perfect
their movement#. Last year they had many
traveling calls, and they wish* to
avoid that this year.
Spice Girls are essential
Familia's preparations for 'this
weekend. Their lyrics are
inspirational to us, kind oPnJur
bible," said captain Jim SchoefcCJgr.
At times, however, their devafcSfm
to the Spice Girls has gotten crtijfof
hand. At a recent party, m&iy
members of La Familia were dahc
ing a bit too hard, and
injuries resulted.
Forging the conscience of this
new race is sophomore Omer
Atesman, who has brought about
the "birth of the Spice Girls
renaissance," Schoettler said.
