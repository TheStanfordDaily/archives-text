# Sailing teams make nationals in late May
## Women win, coed team 2nd at PCCs 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
Last weekend, the Stanford
sailing team qualified for
nationals by placing second in
the Pacific Coast Champi
onships in Honolulu. The No. I
women's team also advanced to
the national competition with a
first-place finish in the women's
PCCs two weekends ago at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
The Cardinal coed team com
peted in two disciplines, team
racing and fleet racing. With a
second-place finish in the team
discipline, Stanford will send
three boats to nationals. A dis
appointing third-place finish in
the fleet racing means that
Stanford's fleet racing is fin
ished for the season, as only the
top two finishers advance to the
next level of competition.
Women's competition is limited
to fleet racing.
In the team-racing discipline,
two schools compete against
each other at a time, each team
with three boats in the water.
Whichever boat crosses the fin
ish line first wins. The regatta
began with a round-robin com
petition in which all seven teams
competed against each other.
With strong trade winds compli
cating the race, Stanford won all
but one of its races, with the loss
coming against eventual cham
pion Hawaii.
The four teams with the best
round-robin record advance to

the Final Four. The weekend's
top four squads included Stan
ford, Hawaii, USC and UC
Irvine. Stanford made it to the
final race, again losing to the
Rainbows. Other schools in the
competition included California,
Cal Maritime and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"We are one of the best in the
country at team racing," said
head coach Steve Bourdow.
The Card did not fare as well
in the fleet-racing discipline, fin
ishing in third place out of 11
teams. In fleet racing, all teams
enter one boat in both an A and
B race. All boats race at the
same time, the winner again
being the first to cross the finish
line. The overall fleet winner is a
determined by a combined score
of the A and Braces. Stanford's
A boat finished a disappointing
fifth, but senior Danny Ximhaldi
in the 15 boat won his race hand
ily, pulling the team finish up to
third.
In the women's competition
at Cal Poly two weeks ago, Stan
ford captured the title. Compet
ing for the women were seniors
Alice Manard and Sybil Diver,
junior Mara Holian, sophomore
Taylor Robinson and freshmen
Anika Leerssen and Katie
Gregg. The team is now gearing
up for nationals.
"We are the strongest team in
the West," Bourdow said. "We
have a shot at winning and are
hoping for at least top-five finish
at nationals."
