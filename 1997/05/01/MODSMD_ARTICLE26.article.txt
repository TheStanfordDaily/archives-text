# Tracye Lawyer: two-sport heptathlete
## 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
It's generally accepted that
most Stanford students don't
have a lot of free time. Sophomore
Tracye lawyer is no exception.
Lawyer divides her time
between competing for the soccer
and t rack and field teams at Stan
ford. The rest of her time is spent
tackling the workload that comes
along with being a soon-to-be biol
ogy major.
Lawyer is a California native,
raised in Santa Barbara. She grew
up in a sports-oriented environ
ment. Her two older brothers
attended Boise State and compet
ed for the Broncos' track team,
lawyer started competing at age
10 in track and field but also
played volleyball and soccer.
Like most dedicated athletes,
her summers were not a time to
relax but were spent competing
with area track clubs. "There is a
lot of exposure" in Southern Cali
fornia, she said.
Lawyer had plenty of encour
agement from home, too.
"My dad is my No. 1 fan. He's
a little crazy sometimes but never
overboard. He's really involved,
jilways checking in with me. My
brothers are always interested."
Lawyer's dad also made sure
that she kept things up on the
academic end as well. She
attributes her time-management
skills to her dad.
"When I was growing up it was
always come home from practice,
eat dinner, then go do my home
work," Lawyer said. "Afler my
homework was done I could have
free time. I was always taught
school's first. That's what's going
to be there after track. Track is
not what I'm going to do for the
rest of my life."
Lawyer's longtime dedication
and hard work in track and field
and school paid off. She was

recruited for track teams across
the country. She was also recruit
ed for several soccer teams.
"I really liked Princeton,"
Lawyer said. But "afler my visit
[to Stanford], I just knew that I
wanted to come here."
The self-described West Coast
girl was attracted to the campus
and Stanford's academics.
"When I was young, I always
wanted to be a pediatrician,"
Lawyer said. "Today, I still want
to do that. [My goal] hasn't
changed. I'm not really interested
in anything else."
Apparently classes and track
weren't enough to satisfy Lawyer.
She walked on to the nationally
ranked Stanford soccer team her
freshman year. Junior Rita Her
miz said Lawyer has been an
important addition to the squad.
"Tracye is a key player for us,"
Hermiz said. "She played a lot for
us this past season. She is an
important part of our team."
The good news for the soccer
squad is that Lawyer enjoys soc
cer and is able to take advantage
of the situation as well.
"I really enjoy soccer," Lawyer
said. "It's more of a team sport. It
takes a lot of individual pressure
off. It also gives me a break from
track. If I had to do [track] all year
I'd go crazy."
At this point, however,
Lawyer's energy is focused on
track. At the recent Azusa
Decathlon / Heptathlon Invita
tional, Lawyer scored 5,604
points in the heptathlon to win
the event and qualify for NCAAs
and for USA Nationals in June.
"I don't think that I'm going to
compete at |USA| Nationals this
year. NCAAs are June 4-7, and
nationals are the next weekend. I
really need a full week to recover."
Although NCAAs are on her
mind, Lawyer hasn't dismissed
this weekend's Big Meet. The Car
dinal women have lost to Cal the

last three years. doesn't
want that to happen again.
"The women are really confi
dent," Lawyer said. "We've
improved so much and have a
lot of potential. The captains
have really pumped us up."

Lawyer has a busy weekend
ahead of her despite the lack of a
heptathlon, which leaves her free
to compete in several individual
events. It's safe to assume that
busy is nothing new to Lawyer,
making this weekend life as usual.
