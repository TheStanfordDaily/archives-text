# Women swimmers to add top recruits
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Despite failing to defend its
national championship this
year, the Cardinal women's
swimming and diving team land
ed one of the best recruiting
classes in recent memory.
Four of the top female high
school swimmers in the United
States, including world-record
holder Misty Hyman, have
agreed to attend Stanford begin
ning in the fall, head coach
Richard Quick announced last
week.
"The 1997-98 freshman class
is one of the most outstanding in
Stanford history," Quick said.
"Misty Hyman is an extremely
exciting addition to the [team],
and her versatility and experi
ence will make her a factor at
the NCAA Championships as a
freshman."
Hyman, currently a senior at
Shadow Mountain High School
in Phoenix, will enter Stanford
as the world-record holder in the
short-course 100-meter butter
fly and as the 1995 world cham
pion in the short-course 100-
meter backstroke. She is also
the sixth-fastest American
woman ever in both the 100 and
200 butterfly.
Hyman is not the only new
comer to have already made
waves in national and interna
tional swimming events. She is
joined in the recruiting class by
Anne Aristeo of Stevenson High
School in Livonia, Mich., Ashley
Chandler of The Westminster
Schools in Atlanta and Lauren
Thies of Lincoln High School in
Portland, Ore. — all of whom
have extensive national team
experience.
"The class is led by three
women who missed the 1996
Olympic team by just one place

at the trials," Quick said. "To be
that close to making the
Olympic team as a high school
junior should give confidence to
Misty Hyman, Lauren Thies
and Ashley Chandler and moti
vate them toward the 2DQO
Olympics." k \
Chandler made a name for
herself at the 1996 Olympic Tri
als by finishing fourth in the 50
free and seventh in the 100 frele,
just missing the Summer Gam£s
in both events.

'The class is led
three women who
just missed
Olympic team by just
one place at the
trials.'

Thies is a three-time U.S.
national champion who finished
ranked 14th in the world in the
800 free and 22nd in the 400
free. She also won the 200 free
at the 1996 Summer Nationals,
and the 100 and 200 free at the
1995 Spring Nationals.
Quick said Aristeo could ;also
have an impact on the team in
her freshman year, as she also
has been a national finalist in
several events. She was a silver
medalist in the 200 butterfly at
the 1995 Olympic Festival.
Next year's freshman class
seems to be the first step for the
Cardinal in regaining the
national championship — a .title
Stanford had owned for -five
years before USC dethronecl*ttie
champions five weeks ago in
Indianapolis.
