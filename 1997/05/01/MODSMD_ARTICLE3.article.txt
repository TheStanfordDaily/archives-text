Just hours after Bill and Hillury Clinton an
nounced that their daughter Chelsea will enter
Stanford University this fall, the campus was al
ready buzzing with the news.
The reaction of the students on the matter was
positive, with many expressing enthusiasm at the
opportunity to attend school with the president's
daughter.
"I think it'll be so cool to maybe be in the same
class with her," sophomore Ashley Clark said. "I
definitely want to get to know her."
Clark added that she thought Clinton's presence
on campus will "give Stanford a better name."
Senior David Herrera agreed, calling the news "u

very national and publicized rejection of Harvard
over Stanford." In addition to Harvard, Clinton
had been accepted to Yale, Princeton, Brown,
Georgetown universities and Wellesley.
Sophomore Kevin Chen said that, even while she
was visiting, he had assumed Clinton was going to
stay on the East Coast and was surprised at the
good news.
"She's welcome to come up to the house again
and hang out with us anytime," he said. Chen is a
pledge at Kappa Sigma, where Clinton attended a
party Saturday during her weekend visit to Stan
ford.
While the campus will most likely keep hum*
ming with the news, many said they hoped the talk
will quiet down soon and ex
pressed concerns that Chelsea will
not be able to have
a normal Stanford experience.
Mentioning that other student
celebrities have been able to min
gle in with the student body in the
past, junior Sonny Kelly said he
thinks Clinton's presence could
eventually come to seem ordinary
over the course of her four-year
stay.
"It'll be tough because every
one will know her and she'll have
Secret Service with her all the
time," said Kelly.
However, he added, "I think a
lot of people are going to try to
treat her like everyone else, and

she seems like a warm person, a
kind of person that would attract a
lot of friends anyway."
Freshman basketball player
David Moseley, who met Clinton
at the Kappa Sigma party, said he
"just treated her like a normal per
son" and intended on doing so,
adding that he would like to invite
her to a basketball game next year.
"She's very down-to-earth and
articulate," Moseley said.
Kevin McElroy, also a fresh
man, commented that although he
welcomes and looks forward to
meeting Clinton, he would only
base his interaction with the presi
dent's daughter on her personali
ty.
He said he didn't mind the se
curity that would be present on
campus with Clinton.
"I think it'll make the campus a
safer place for everyone," he said.
