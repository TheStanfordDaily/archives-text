The recently unveiled World Wide Web site, a pro
duction of the Stanford Virtual Directory, offers the
University community an online database of campus
events and activities. Information gathered from cam
pus groups about upcoming events appears catalogued
by date as well as by such categories as lectures, sports,
community service and arts.
"The campus has been calling for something like
this," said junior Dawn Woo, editor of the site. Woo esti
mates almost 200 of about 400 organizations on campus
contribute information about upcoming events to Cam
pus Calendar.
Some of the events listed for today include a work
shop for people interested in identifying the components
of an automobile engine, a lecture on healing with ener
gy and a women's music night and poetry reading at the
Coffee House.
"The No. 1 complaint of students is that people are
not informed of campus events," said Virtual Directory
Project Manager Lewis Lin, a sophomore. But for stu
dent groups, said Lin, "even with advertising it's hard to
reach eveiyone." Lin envisions the calendar as bridging
this information gap.
Several online variants of the Virtual Directory's

Campus Calendar are available to the Stanford commu
nity, but none have been as comprehensive as Campus
Calendar," Lin said. About 12 staff members in the Vir
tual Directory, a project run by Stanford Student En
terprises, the business arm of the ASSU, work on Cam
pus Calendar. Some of these employees are assigned to
specific "beats," or clusters of student groups, and con
tact publicity representatives about new events.
However, contacting the hundreds of campus orga
nization has proved difficult. Unlike event guides at
some other universities, Campus Calendar does not re
ceive funding from either the ASSU or the University.
"Something of this magnitude requires lots 0f... re
sources — more resources than we have," said Lin.
Woo said the organization hopes to spread the word
so campus groups will realize the calendar is a valuable
tool in publicizing activities. Groups can submit infor
mation about upcoming events to Campus Calendar at
its home page, and within hours these events appear in
the database.
The idea for Campus Calendar "has been floating
around theASSU for two or three years," said Woo. Em
ployees at the Virtual Directory have worked on the cal
endar since May, although the prototype for Campus
Calendar only began to evolve at the end of last quarter
as employees became available to work on the project.
Ultimately, the value of the calendar to the Stanford
community depends on how much it is utilized by both
students groups and individuals. The more people con
tribute to it, the more valuable it becomes," Lin said.
