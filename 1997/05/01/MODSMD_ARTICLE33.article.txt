# Go climb a rock

Spider-man's superhuman wall-climbing skill
inspired us all as kids. Perhaps it is his skill that in
spired the growing number of students interested
in rock climbing.
"Rock climbing has been around for a long time,
to say the least. People have been making ascents
in the Alps for centuries," said freshman David
Murphree. "However, modern rock climbing, as we
now know it, has only been around for around 50 or
so years.
"I would definitely say that it has experienced a
recent surge in popularity."
Responding to this interest, a loose organiza
tion of rock climbing enthusiasts are planning
construction on a wall after students voted to allo
cate special-fee funding to the project in the ASSU
Spring General Election.
"We want to bring climbing to Stanford. We
want to give the students a chance to give it a try,"
sophomore Andrea Silva said.
Students got their first taste of what the pro
jected climbing wall would be like earlier this
month in White Plaza, where a plexiglas wall rent
ed from Compwall in San Francisco was erected.
However, the wall that will be built on campus will
not be plexiglas, but instead would feature a simu
lated rock face, according to Silva.
According to sophomore Trevor Bezdek, one of
the students most active in working toward ob
taining a wall here on campus, the proposal sub
mitted to the Department of Athletics envisions a
20-to 30-foot wall that will bo located in deGuerre.
Their goal is to have the wall ready by winter quar
ter of next year.
"We tried to build a wall about four years ago,
and we'd gotten money from Students Environ
mental Action at Stanford, but the idea wasn't sup
ported by the University. There were liability is
sues and athletics wasn't supportive," Bezdek said.
This time, however, "athletics was amazingly
supportive. I think what's changed is that climb
ing has become a much more accepted sport," he
said.
Bezdek added that climbing has been given
more attention recently. Sophomore Christine
Chang agreed.
"I was surprised once I started at how popular
a sport it is," Chang said.
Bezdek offered some possible explanations for
the popularity spurt.
"Growth of gym climbing has made it so much
more accessible," Bezdek said. "Also, it's one of

the easier sports to pick up. I think
climbing is really intuitive behav
ior."
Junior Tanya Laidman said
climbing still requires a certain
amount of training.
"I climb maybe three times a
week for two hours â€” when I'm
training hard, maybe 15 hours a
week. If you're on a trip, you're
climbing sunrise to sunset,"
Laidman said. j

Laidman said the majority
of competitions are held in
doors, and the winner is the
one who can climb the highest

on a marked route up the wall.
Competitions are sponsored by the American
Sport Climbing Federation.
Laidman does much of her training at Mission
Cliffs, an indoor climbing gym in South San Fran
cisco.
Stanford students have several off-campus
climbing options. There are three other climbing
gyms within an hour of Stanford: Twisters in
Mountain View, Planet Granite in Santa Clara
and Pacific Edge in Santa Cruz.
"Planet Granite has greatly improved since the
time I started going there in 1995," Chang said.
"The staff is friendly and helpful and the environ
ment is very comfortable."
Laidman said she feels there are some draw
backs to indoor climbing gyms.
"They are prohibitively expensive for a lot of
students. A day pass ranges from $12 to $15, not
including equipment," Laidman said.
The benefit is that indoor gyms are incredibly
safe, Laidman added. Contrary to public opinion,
climbing is not a high-risk sport.
"Occasionally people will develop elbow ten
donitis," Laidman said.
Murphree said, "Anything is dangerous if you
practice it without training, experience and com
mon sense."
There are a few programs on campus that can
provide some of the experience and training. One
of the outdoor education programs, Geological
and Environmental Sciences 7, taught by volun
teer instructors and faculty adviser Dennis Bird,
is offered every quarter. In addition, the Redwood
Outdoors Club recently founded a climbing sub
chapter on campus.
And in the future, students can look forward to
a new climbing wall. Spiderman would be proud.
