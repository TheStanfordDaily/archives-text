is set in Venice, where we learn that one of
two newly married gondolier brothers was
stolen in infancy and is actually the king of
Barataria and already married to the
daughter of the duke and duchess of Plaza
Toro. Set to some of Sullivan's sunniest
music, full of Italian and Spanish dancing
rhythms, "The Gondoliers" contains de
lightful duets, quartets and quintets. Per

urday, both this weekend and next, with a
2:30 matinee on May 11. General admis

chanting new production of the bard's
popular romantic comedy, "Much Ado

the ear in this perennial favorite. The show

THUR* 1 - MAY *24
"Evocation of a Dream" is a group instal
lation combining ideas of time, tlux and
changing patterns captured on film and
realized in sculpture. The installation pro
posal states that "our work coalesces into
a rhythmic unit without conveying a con
crete narrative." "Evocation of a Dream"
offers a unique opportunity to experience
the work of South Bay artists Margaret
Michel, John Reily and Terry Kreiter simul
taneously as "a vibrant transformation of
light through space ... a fertile atmos
phere for the transference of thought."
The work is on display at WORKS / San
Jose. Call (408) 295-8378 for details.

Film
THUR'l
Chilean-born director Raul Ruiz has been
a major international figure since his first
feature, "Three Sad Tigers," won the
Grand Prix at the Locarno Film Fest. His
films are visually stunning, laced with irony
and a runaway imagination, combining
equal parts realism and fantasy. His films
are described as "surrealist," "baroque"
and "postmodern," but ultimately Ruiz
characterizes himself as "a monomaniac
with several manias." Ruiz's latest, "Ge
nealogies of a Crime," starring Catherine
Deneuve, will be screened at 6:30 p.m. at
the AMC Kabuki 8 Theatres, 1881 Post St.,
San Francisco. Tickets are $10; call 552-
8760 for details.
