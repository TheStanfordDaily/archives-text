"Art Objects: Essays on Ecstasy and Effr6ntery "
Jeanette Winterson;
Vintage International

"Art Objects: Essays on Ecstasy and Effrontery" gathers 10
essays by novelist Jeanette Winterson on paintings and
books. Winterson firmly places the stress on the second syl
i lable of "objects," energizing the typically flaccid noun to
function as an active verb and emphasizing the need for art
to function as illumination, not wallpaper.
| The book begins with the title essay about Winterson's
I first explorations of art On a snowy Christmas Day in Am

sterdam, Winter
son sees a painting
of "a haunted
woman in blue
robes pulling a
huge moon face
through a subter
ranean waterway."
After a life spent
in ignorance of
art, she turns to
the familiar medi
um of books to
guide her through
the difficult work
of learning how to
become articulate
with images. "We
have to recognize

that the language of art, all art, is not our mother tongue," she
writes.
In exploring art, Winterson inquires into issues of canon

icity, cheerfully razzing the muse
um-goers whose only concerns are
"Is the painting Authority?" and
"Where is the tea-room / toilet / gift
shop?" Instead of relying on the
monetary valiu ot a work, Winter
son urges art-lookers to muck about
in velvet-roped galleries and dusty
ateliers, creating .1 sense ofwhat jolts
us out of complacency.

When

Throughout the book, Winterson sloughs off the precon
ceptions that soften the sharp edges of old works. In the sec
ond part of "Art Objects" she discusses the Modernists, with
whom she clearly aligns herself and her own writing. She
captures the work of the poet as "not to build the (Chinese
Wall of a private language and not to slip into conversation
al slackness," heralding Virginia Woolfand T.S. Eliot as poets
who succeed at this mission.
Clearly, Winterson defines herself as a New Modernist,
and although she emphasizes the balance between cabalism
and transparency, her tendency is towards the former, 112 ur
ther, her glittering, fiercely opinionated prose is ideal in fic
tion yet a trifle grating in expository essays. The sell assur
ance that succeeds when mediated through the role of a
speaker in her novels is different when it's the naked "I" of
Winterson herself telling the reader that, yes, 1 )avid I lockney
is a genius, and you'll realize it too il only you contemplate
his painting for long enough.

Cockiness aside, though, it's impossible to capture or dis
pute the vigor and dog-whistle distinctiveness of Winterson's
voice. When writing about her, I'm tempted to assemble a

catalog» qu('tat "ii> .is the ilea .seed ' • 011.i i> important I

Language became her raison d'etre, a knowledge that makes

Though she leaves little space for dissension, Winterson s
opinions are strongly presented and certainly catalyze rigoi
ous thought on the role of art and writing in society, liach
essay explores how to think, what to think, how to live and so
011; each essay provides a fortnight's worth of ruminations.
As fodder for thought and creativity, there is no work more
beautiful or inspiring.
