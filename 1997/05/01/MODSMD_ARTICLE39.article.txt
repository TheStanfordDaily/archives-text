## Talking trash with Bill Paxton 
### 
At one point during my interview with Bill Pax
ton, his 3-year-old son (sent by his publicist) tod
dles into the room, saying, "Arc you Bill Pullman?"
The room explodes into laughter at the joke,
but the fact remains that most of America still
thinks that Paxton's greatest role is the president in
"Independence Day" Alternately, there are those
who consider it blasphemy to not have every line
uttered by Paxton in "Aliens" committed to mem
ory. I guess that's what it means to have a cult fol
lowing.
Sitting down to talk with Paxton about "Trav
eller" is sitting down with a man who is very proud
of his new film. Almost the first words out of his
mouth arc, "I've made a lot of films, and this is a
quality movie." Paxton has, indeed, inade4o-plus
fill . over the course ol his career — films ranging
from "Weird Science" to "Tombstone" to "The
Evening Star." But to him, "Traveller" is special. It
marks Paxton's first outing as a producer, and it is
what he calls most definitively "a labor of love."
Paxton is bound and determined to promote
"Traveller," as is its director, Jack (ireen, who joined
Paxto for its premiere at the 40th annual San Fran
cisco International Film Festival. The two men
share an obvious camaraderie and frequently ex
pounded on the merits of the film and behind-the
scenes tales of how it came about.
Paxton's wife found the script for "Traveller"
four years ago, at a time when he wanted to get in
volved again with independent filmmaking. After
a long series of big budget, studio films, Paxton was
eager to go back to small, independent produc
tions.
"I wanted to follow up "One False Move,'" he
said, referring to the low-budget film he made in
1993. "It was a great role for me. It [gave me] some
of the best critical notices I got. (Then) I'm work
ing on 'Twister.' I'm finally in a political position
with my partners to go out and raise the $5 mil
lion."
Both Paxton and Green stressed the difficulties
of mounting their own production. Paxton had
dreamed 22 years of becoming a producer, and
(ireen harbored a similarly unfulfilled dream of
being a director.

The two met on the set of "Twister," where
Green, Clint Eastwood's cinematographer, was
brought in to "shore up production." Equally frus
trated by what Green described as feeling like a
bridegroom left at the altar, the two were finally
able to fulfill their longtime goals in collaboration.
Paxton described their drive as thinking: "We're
going to make this; we're going to make it our way."

He said that he and (ireen felt re
ally lucky as filmmakers because the
financiers of the film took the atti
tude of "make the film you want to
make." A different studio involved
early in pre-production was already
"starting to impose its controls over
us," Paxton said. "If we had gotten
into post-production with these
people, this picture would have been
gutted like a deer."
Paxton was reluctant to cling to
the vast differences between big
budget studio films and smaller in
dependent movies in terms of
money or effects. While he acknowl
edged that "Twister" wasn't exactly a
complex character study, he pointed

out that movies like "Apollo 13" or the upcoming
James Cameron, $180 million water-fest "Titanic"
are character driven, as are many independent
films.
"The studio can't make |character-driven
movies | cost-effectively anymore," Paxton said. He
credited the current "renaissance" in independent
filmmaking (case in point: the 19% Oscars dedi
cated almost solely to " The English Patient") with
creating an "opportunity for guys like us to go out
and make our own film."
Both Paxton and Green agreed that the casting
of the movie was relatively quick. Paxton's long
time acting coach, Vincent Chase, was given a sup
porting role, and the other roles were filled with
similar ease. Although many actors read for the
part eventually won by Mark Wahlherg, Paxton
said Wahlherg was "just the guy" for it. Paxton
called his own character, Bokky, "complex" and
"interesting."
Neither Paxton nor Green could say enough
about how perfect the process of making this film
was. Said Green: "We were so fortunate to have all
the right people for all the right reasons." Paxton
said Green "created an atmosphere so relaxed, so
supportive. We were all able to do the best work
we've ever done in a movie."
The two men didn't seem to have a single ill
word to speak of the entire experience, although
they did wish that screenwriter Jim McGlynn could
get more recognition.
Paxton said he didn't need to research his char
acter and the Travellers, a group of Irish-Ameri
cans, because "it was really all in the script." He
said, "Jim McGlynn wrote a really good screenplay.
He did that work. So for us, [Green] had to get on
with mounting the production, and I had to get on

with playing this character of Bokky'
Paxton admitted that the film does not aim for
historical truth, noting that his own research was
limited to television documentaries that painted
the Travellers in a "harsh light." He was the first to
note that "We've definitely kind of romanticized
them," a comment that evoked an assenting chuck
le from Green.

Factual inaccuracies notwithstanding, 1 was still
waiting for some kind of sign of negative feeling
about the production. Where were the stories of
star temper tantrums or demands for Evian
bathing water? As the interview went on, 1 realized
I was to be disappointed. (ireen rhapsodized about
the support he has received from his mentor, Clint
Eastwood, mentioning the tributes to Eastwood
hidden in the film.
Paxton went as far as to say that getting bad re
views isn't so tough now that they are taking re
sponsibility for making their own film — a re
sponsibility he said he enjoys. As he put it, "We
can't say, ' The studio made us do this ending. The
studio made us cast this person.' " Nevertheless, he
was quick to note the positive critical reinforce
ment the film has engendered, such as the oft
sought-after thumb-fiesta from Chicago.
"We have been vindicated, regardless of what
the film does commercially," he said.
Paxton's use of the word vindicated isanother il
lustration of the uphill climb that becominga pro
ducer was for him and that becoming a director
was for Green.
For the time being, they are focusing on getting
the word out on "Traveller," a movie that represents
dream realizations and artistic achievements that
clearly have them (to judge by the judicious
amount of high-fiving between the two) awfully
excited. And as 1 resign myself to a dearth of gossip
and mud slinging, Paxton and Green prepare for
the nationwide opening of their film and settle into
their newfound hyphenations. The actor-produc
er and the cinematographer-director are living
proof that if you in fact have something nice to say,
say it as much as you can. H
