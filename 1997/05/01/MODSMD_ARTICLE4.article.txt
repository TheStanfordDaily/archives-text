### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate is
expected to approve the
new student judicial char
ter and discuss recom
mended changes to the
Area One requirement
today.
After winning approval
by the ASSU Senate and
the student body, the char
ter needs the support of the

Faculty Senate and University President
Gerhard Casper.
Brought to the senate by the Committee
of 15, a group formed to review the Univer
sity's judicial process, the charter addresses
procedures for handling violations of the
Honor Code, the Fundamental Standard
and other student conduct policies.
According to Geophysics Prof. Mark
Zoback, the committee, which he chairs, will
ask the senate to approve the charter with
out making any changes, even friendly ones.

In a memorandum to the senators,
Zoback noted that any revisions may require
the charter to appear on the ballot again in
the next ASSU spring general election be
fore it is finally approved.
The charter gained support of 88.6 per
cent of student voters in the general election
on April 16 and 17.
In expectation of today's meeting, Zoback
said he is "cautiously hopeful that things
will go well."
Recognizing that the charter is not per
fect and may need to be reformed at some fu
ture date, Zoback suggested revisions be
made after the campus has had some experi
ence under the new charter.
"Let's wait until we've tried out the sys
tem before amending it,"he said.
Under the charter, which seeks to involve
students more fully in the judicial process,
formal charges will be heard by panels of
four students and two faculty members or
University administrators.
The senate will also continue its consider-


Zoback
ation of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies' recommenda
tions for changes in the Area One
requirement, which is now ful
filled by Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues Program.
The recommendations involve
a transition from the current
three-quarter structure to a se
quence of a one-quarter course

emphasizing "general modes of
humanistic inquiry" followed by
two quarters focusing on more
specific themes.
According to Academic Secre
tary Susan Schofield, the senate's
steering committee will suggest
that the senate examine the Area
One requirement in a two-stage
process, first discussion and then
action.
If the two-stage approach is
used, no formal votes on the rec
ommendations will be taken
today.
