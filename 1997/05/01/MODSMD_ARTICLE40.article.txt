# MAGAZINE XY
## RIDING THE WAVE OF REVOLUTION How one man has impacted young gay males around the world 
### 
SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE a few months back,
a provocative magazine called XY that featured on its
cover a teenage boy in a seductive, "come hither"
pose. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but I was in
trigued.
1 discovered I was not alone in my in curiosity. Since re
leasing the first issue in March of last year, XY has had one of
the most successful magazine launches in modern history.
Where tour of every five magazines fails within the first three
years of publication, XY is selling out every edition it prints
and plans to double its national circulation to 80,000 for the
next issue. It's enough to make any venture capitalist jump
for joy, clamoring to get on board.
But talking with the magazine's 30-something publisher
and founder, Peter lan Cummings, it's obvious that money
and glamor are far from his list of priorities — an apparent
anathema in the gay world seemingly obsessed with bodily
and material perfection.
After working on other gay-oriented publications and
lamenting the popular media's tendency to lump all gay men
into a homogeneous group, he saw the need and the means
to mobilize a key constituency, that of gay males under 30.
"i started XY with a social agenda in mind," said Cum
mings. "Certainly, things have gotten better tor gavs, but
while there are people who say things are going smoothly
overall... I wanted to point out there are very real problems
within the gay community itself."
When I first saw XY, the stories inside proved the pictures
were only a hook and not the main course, as is the case with

so many other magazines on the rack. XY is less about a
bunch of sexy images strung together than about meaning
ful and well-written stories ranging from the serious, like de
tailing the roots of fundamentalist Christian opposition to
gay rights to an irreverent and amusing article on how a reg
ular Joe survived a gay circuit party in Palm Springs.
It's because these stories and photos — which are really
no more provocative than what's found in a Versace or
Calvin Klein ad — don't appeal to the entire spectrum of gay
life and are not sanitized for the PC police that controversy
has surrounded XY.
"Ninety percent of our readership is young gay men
under 30. We have a natural set of interests, and we shouldn't
apologize for it," said Cummings.
By rallying against what Cummings calls the traditional

gay establishment, he and XY have raised a lot of questions
within the gay community itself. The magazine has helped
many young gay males come to grips with their sexuality and
question what it means to be gay. But in the process, XY has
drawn criticism for being overly sexual by some members of
the gay community and media.
Cummings is unrepentant about the format of XY, which
is a combination of fashion and social commentary, like
Vogue and The New Republic smashed together.
"Rather than doing stories on feel-good subjects, I want
ed to draw attention to what was going on within the com
munity — that gay teens are still killing themselves at six

times the rate of
regular teens, high
schools are still ter
rible places for gay

teens, that everything is not OK."
Indeed, Cummings' first love killed himselfat 14. On a re
cent trip back to his high school in Bethesda, Md., he found
little had changed in terms of attitudes and policies. Cum
mings says in many ways, XY is dedicated to his first love.
Cummings finds it particularly galling when mainstream
publications try to sanitize and standardize a gay lifestyle for
mainstream (i.e., straight) consumption, even among gay
publications like the Advocate and Out. Recently, Out pub
lished a stinging critique of XY, calling it a "dubious achieve
ment."
But because other gay media are beholden to advertisers,
it would not be prudent to piss any of them off. As such,
Cummings feels the traditional gay press compromise their
goals of serving the gay community — and in trying to

please everyone, they end up serving no one.
Unlike all other gay publications, Cummings
and his staff adhere to a very strict policy of re
fusing ads from tobacco and alcohol compa
nies, 9(H) numbers and 21-and-over night
clubs to uphold editorial independence.
I lence the $5.95 cover price.
I found Cummings' reason for opposing
tobacco ads hilariously caustic. With every
stinking puff, he explained, gays are indirectly
contributing to one of tobacco's most ardent
supporters — and a friend of gays everywhere
-— Jesse Flelms.
As for night clubs, Cummings says they
foster and perpetuate an unhealthy atmos
phere of socializing for the under-21 crowd.
He seeks to promote alternatives to the club
scene and also refuses to cover any club parties.
But one surprise has been the resistance of

clothing designers whose homoerotic ads are splashed on
the sides of buses and billboards. Many, including < lalvin
Klein have refused to advertise in XY. Ironic, Cummings
says, "seeing how our demographic probably buys more «>l
their stuff than anyone else."
Cummings says the lack of advertisers has not hint the
bottom line because the magazine is able to sell so well on
newsstands and in bookstores. Chain stores like Borders and
Barnes & Noble initially agreed to carry XY, and the maga
zine's enthusiastic reception has put it on t licit priority list ol
magazines to stock, scoring a brilliant vie tory against corpo
rate censorship.
"Being gay is not about copying straight people's
lifestyles," said Cummings. "It's fine to want to gel married,
the picket fence and shopping-mall, suburban lifestyle, but
we should not give up our right to enjoy our sexuality and

express ourselves," he said. Gay youth should determine the
merits of XY, not older gay men.
Cummings grew up in a very traditional, old line East
Coast family. After attending Vassar (College and completing
a masters degree in journalism at Northwestern University,
he flew to London on a cheap ticket, intending to stay two
weeks, but liked it so much he stayed for nearly 10 years,
"There are many things I liked about England, the gener
ally healthier nature of gay culture there.... You see a lot less
of the problems like ageism and negative sexuality," he said.
I lomesickness drove Cunynings back to the United States.
On returning in 1994, he settled in San Francisco. Alter years
of working in the magazine business, starting one of his own
was the furthest thought in his mind. Hut with strong encour
agement from friends, (.ummings went ahead. Working end •
less shifts at a photo shop and subsisting on bread for a year,
he saved up enough cash to get issue one off the ground by
himself without debt and with almost nonexistent ad revenue.
"The first two issues were produced entirely out of my
bedroom," he explained
XY is changing the lives of gay youth and families every
where, including Cummings' own family. Originally, they had
been very conservative and openly homophobic. Now "at our
yearly family reunions family mem tars flip through XY and
congratulate me on the job I've done." Cummings never
thought that would happen as family members and readers of
XY view him as being the on the edge of a social revolution.
With XY growing so fast, Cummings has been able to hire
a staff of five and has set up offices in the heart of San Fran
cisco's Castro district. By next issue, XY's newsstand circula
tion should be second only to that of arch antagonist Out
magazine.,.. Sweet revenge for the upstart "dubious
achievement" and the young generation. ||
