# To sleep, perchance to screen a dialy of the other san francisco

nsidc the AMC Kabuki movie theatre in San Francisco, tables overflowed with free
champagne, hors d'oeuvres, biscotti and Newman's Own organic pretzels. So why was
there a line at the concession stand?
That was my question opening night, along with where were the directors of the
evening's four films, and where was Danny Glover, who a theater employee told me was
upstairs? But as I wove in and out of the wine-sipping, freebie-toting people, any direc
tor I might have passed blended right in with everyone else. Danny Glover probably
camouflaged himself with that same wide-eyed, roving look the rest of us had. I did spot
Mayor Willie Brown by the steel drum band, but he left soon after the time requisite for
V

an "appearance."
After the film screenings came the opening night celebration at the War Memorial
Veterans Building. There was hot food, a live band, friendly schmoozing and a beautiful
building to enjoy it all in, but my memories are of other lone journalists wandering
around, as well as two security guards who turned out to be guarding the bathrooms.
After that night, I figured I would leave the responsibility of my meeting filmmakers in
the capable hands of festival publicist Caroline Libresco, who helped arrange all my in
terviews. Here are some people 1 talked with. U

JO MKNELL •
I mot J<> Menell, co-director of the Oscar-nominated documentary "Mandela" at Mario's Bo
hemian (ligar Store (]afe. (They do sell cigars, but get this — you can't smoke inside). The first thing
I wanted to know was how lie got Mandela to agree to seven months of being followed, seven
months that, incidentally, included his historic presidential inauguration.
"Well, that was extraordinary," he said. "Because I met him at (my brother's) wedding in '93, and
I was talking about his autobiography. I said, 'So, who's doing the film?' And he said, 'What film?'
and I said, 'The film ofyour life.' I le said, 'No one.' 1 said, 'Really?' 1 le said, 'No one.' "
"I took a deep breath and said, 'Well, I'd like to do it.' Anil he looked at me long and hard and he
said, 'Yes, that seems OK.' "
Menell started fund raising immediately, even enlisting the help of friend Jonathan Demme,
whose exact words were, "I )ude, I'd be honored to produce it. (Menell first met Demme through
mutual friend and legendary director Bernardo Bertolucci, but that's another story).
Menell wanted to show Mandela the man vs. Mandela the icon as captured in personal scenes of
Mandela shaving and recounting his boyhood experience of being circumcised. Mandela's role as a
political figure is, ol course, inescapable, but MenelPs desire to explore his many facets meant also
showing his role as husband to wives Kvclyn and Winnie.
Mandela" plays at 7 p.m. Saturday at the AM( Kabuki, with a post-screening party afterwards. For
tickets, call (415) 441-7373.

FINN TAYLOR
Finn Taylor had been up until 4 a.m. celebrating the screening of his film when I met him eight hours later at a
cafe. But Taylor is no stranger to 16-hour days, which he averaged during the shooting of the film he wrote and
directed, "Dream with the Fishes." (I think the guy cutting pipe next to our table kept us awake, too.)
So what made him write a story about the adventures of a suicidally depressed voyeur (David Arquette) and a
terminally ill heroin addict (Brad Hunt)?
"It's loosely autobiographical," Taylor said. "I had this friend, Mike, who would do things I would never do in a
million years. We d travel around, and 1 d watch him do the things I wouldn't do. But we got in a big fight in New
Orleans and went our separate ways, and I went to Europe. While I was in Europe, I got word that he was sick and
I came back and used the money I had been saving to help him live out some of his fantasies in his last few weeks."
Because it was a personal story and because of a bad Hollywood treatment of his earlier script, "Pontiac
Moon," Taylor decided to make this film independently. The decision to direct it himself— he had never directed
before — came about differently. Originally, someone else was going to do it.
But, Taylor said, "I was hiking in the hills and I was listening to the radio, and Mike liked really bad music —
he liked Meatloaf and Billy Joel. I was listening to the radio, saying 'Should I do this, or should I not?' I lis favorite
billy Joel song came on. Then I switched channels and Meatloaf was being interviewed, and then his favorite
Meatloaf song was played. So I kind of took that as a sign."
The experience was rewarding for Taylor, even though arrangements for all his major locations fell through the
night before shooting.
Filmed in 54 locations around the Bay Area in an amazing 26 days, "Dream with the Fishes" opens in July.

LUCAS BEI.VAUX
I was glad to hear that "Pour Rire! (lust for Laughs!)," Lucas Belvaux's
dramatic comedy about marital infidelity, was not a personal story, seeing
that Madame Belvaux was sitting t>nly a lew feet away from the French di
rector. Instead, "Pour Rire!", which Belvaux wrote and directed, is a new
take on an old theme.
"It is like a jazz standard," Belvaux said. "You have the same melody, hut
you play it your own way."
And, indeed, a plot summary of the film couples travails would be dull.
But using Belvaux's carefully crafted dialogue and controlled comic mo
ments, actors lean Pierre Leaud and Ornella Muti miraculously resuscitate
the drama. Belvaux, himself an actor, wrote the role of the desperate hus
band especially lor Leaud, who is best known for his work with Truffaut.
Belvaux's intent was to show the humanity of all the characters. His ap
proach to doing this, however, was opposite from that of most directors,

who try to create sympathetic characters. But Belvaux doesn't want the au
dience to identify with characters in his films.
I take pains to put a distance between the audience and the characters,"
he said, lb really understand a story, you have to be able to be outside the
story. 1 here is an expression in chess that says, Ihe spectator sees better
what is happening on the board.'"
I didn t argue, but, speaking for myself and probably other viewers, I
think his movie works because the audience can be both on the inside and
on the outside. After all, who hasn t laughed at someone in a movie and at
the same time felt, "that's just like me"?
Nevertheless, Belvaux has produced a great film, and he plans to write
and direct more in the future. 1 le will continue to act as well but not in his
own films. He has his own philosophy about that. "Working with actors is
part of the fun of being a director and vice versa," he said. "By doing both,
I'd lose the fun of both."

B I A IJESSA AND HA NY ROUND
1 he first guests to arrive at the festival, Bia I essa and I )any Roland were happy to he out of Brazil for a
respite from their many projects. They even thought they might get some sleep. They were so energetic
when we talked, though, that I would he impressed to see them fully rested.
I heir film, shot with only an K mm camcorder and edited digitally, is a colorfully vibrant recreation of (ier
man novelist I homas Mann s story,' Ihe 1 loly Sinner.' A tale about sin and redemption in the lives of a family
fraught with Freudian complexes, they chose this story because they felt that "all stories are in this story."
(Originally, the play was only supposed to be a theater workshop with people from the hacklaiuls of Brazil
as actors. But one day, someone loaned them a camera to record the workshops.
Ihe videotaping wasn t just a registration, a record, l.essa said. It actually hail .111 aesthetic opinion, li
had its own value independent of the research that it represented." -
So l.essa and Roland bought their own camera and created a film from the workshops and final perlor
mances. And the images, framed with an emphasis on the surrounding environment, lend an off kilter but
wonderfully complementary look to the subjective mood of the story.
I he tone is also set by a string orchestra that plays continuously in the background, which they said "had
a really wonderful out-of-tune quality" (not that it isn't pleasant to listen to). I bis extensive use of the or
chestra, however, was actually a result of bad luck turned good. l.essa and Roland had recorded volumes of
ambient sound and other songs for the soundtrack, but someone broke into their hotel room and stole
everything. Because there was no way to recreate the sound, they started to experiment with music. The end
result, they were delighted to discover, tied the fragments of the film into a unified whole.
So today we really thank the robbers because otherwise we would have gone down a path that wouldn't
have given much clarity to the story," l.essa said.
After they leave San Francisco, l.essa and Roland will remain busy, working on .in exhibit of (Ihristian
Lacroix couture, an opera, a film ... perhaps even a musical ouverture for the World (aip soccer game. J just
hope they get some sleep on the plane.

I EAN-PIERRE A N P LUC PAR DEN N E
Speaking of sleep, the Dardenne brothers certainly didn't got much. They
were slightly jetlagged from their flight from Belgium the night before, but I was
happy to get some good answers before they lapsed into the monosyllabic yes
and no.
"La Promesse," written and directed by both I hardennes, is a difficult story of
a teenager's initiation into the shrinking world of ethics and shared humanity.
Igor, the teenager, is his father's apprentice, learning to run the business of illegal
immigrant smuggling and labor. A vicious business that is currently a very real
problem in Belgium, it provided the perfect setting for the questions the I Ard
ennes wanted to ask: How can people stay human in situations like this? How
can people oppose injustice? How do people deal with evil?
Loaded questions, yes, and key to the development of the characters in the
story. The style and mood of the film smack of bleak realism, but the story is
particularly effective in its evolution ol hope in the midst of an ugly situation.
Unlike many stories where the solution can be seen a mile away, the turn of
events and ol characters occur with realism and without prediction.
And no, the Pardennes rarely light; and yes, they plan to make more movies
together.
The third feature film from the 1 )ardenne brothers, who started off making
documentaries, "La Promesse" opens on June 4 at the Roxie (anema in San
Francisco.

PH I I.I PPK COHKN-SOI A 1.
Suddenly taken ill, Yolande Zauberman, writer and diret toi of"( lubbed
to 1 )eath," had to lly hack to Paris lor medical treatment. So I talked instead
with (.ohen Solal, who worked with her lor almost two years as a sort ol I )|
ol the III in s soundtrack. Actually, during the interview, /.auherman called
Philippe from the airport to complain ahout the airline personnel. Appar
ently, she had run into the same unfriendly lolks iliey had encountered on
their way over. Lesson?
"I )on't take Air I ranee," (.ohen Solal said.
Incidentally, it was quite fitting to interview (ohen Solal bet a use music is
the driving force of the film. It is so pervasive, and olten so pounding, that I
thought the film's title might be referring, tongue in t heck, to club music
overkill.
Not so. "(ilubbcd to I )eath" is actually the nameol the main track ol the
movie. A mix ol classical and electronic music, it mesmerized < ohen Solal
when he first heard it and entranced the rest of the crew as well, /auherman
wanted to use music to introduce the audience to the feeling of hcingat a rave.
(lohen Solal explained that the music almost plays a fifth role, creating .1
near-religious experience in the club that carries Lola and l inn to a freedom
that is both personal and shared.
I he music, however, leaves little room lor dialogue and mile li needed si
lence. The story is essentially a messy love triangle, and the two destined
lovers — Lola and Lrnir — meet .it a clubone strange,drug tripped night. It
is a simple story, but the motivations of I .ola and l .mir are unfathomable
and hazy at best. I hey and the other people in the film seem to ac I purely on
drugs — or is it the air?
Whew. Well, I'm going to act on my stomach and line up at the conces
sion stand for some food, which is definitely a theme (il only a secondary
one) of this festival.
Speaking of themes, I think I'll take a nap too.


Unsuspecting Jo Meneil relaxes with a paper.
Little does he know that a reporter will soon
bombard him with lots and lots of questions.


These magazines have nothing to do with
Finn Taylor or his movie. I merely admired
them for their photographic value.

And, indeed, a plot summary of the film couples travails would be dull.
But using Belvaux's carefully crafted dialogue and controlled comic mo
ments, actors lean Pierre Leaud and Ornella Muti miraculously resuscitate
the drama. Belvaux, himself an actor, wrote the role of the desperate hus
band especially lor Leaud, who is best known for his work with Truffaut.
Belvaux's intent was to show the humanity of all the characters. His ap
proach to doing this, however, was opposite from that of most directors,

who try to create sympathetic characters. But Belvaux doesn't want the au
dience to identify with characters in his films.
I take pains to put a distance between the audience and the characters,"
he said, lb really understand a story, you have to be able to be outside the
story. 1 here is an expression in chess that says, Ihe spectator sees better
what is happening on the board.'"
I didn t argue, but, speaking for myself and probably other viewers, I
think his movie works because the audience can be both on the inside and
on the outside. After all, who hasn t laughed at someone in a movie and at
the same time felt, "that's just like me"?
Nevertheless, Belvaux has produced a great film, and he plans to write
and direct more in the future. 1 le will continue to act as well but not in his
own films. He has his own philosophy about that. "Working with actors is
part of the fun of being a director and vice versa," he said. "By doing both,
I'd lose the fun of both."

B I A IJESSA AND HA NY ROUND
1 he first guests to arrive at the festival, Bia I essa and I )any Roland were happy to he out of Brazil for a
respite from their many projects. They even thought they might get some sleep. They were so energetic
when we talked, though, that I would he impressed to see them fully rested.
I heir film, shot with only an K mm camcorder and edited digitally, is a colorfully vibrant recreation of (ier
man novelist I homas Mann s story,' Ihe 1 loly Sinner.' A tale about sin and redemption in the lives of a family
fraught with Freudian complexes, they chose this story because they felt that "all stories are in this story."
(Originally, the play was only supposed to be a theater workshop with people from the hacklaiuls of Brazil
as actors. But one day, someone loaned them a camera to record the workshops.
Ihe videotaping wasn t just a registration, a record, l.essa said. It actually hail .111 aesthetic opinion, li
had its own value independent of the research that it represented." -
So l.essa and Roland bought their own camera and created a film from the workshops and final perlor
mances. And the images, framed with an emphasis on the surrounding environment, lend an off kilter but
wonderfully complementary look to the subjective mood of the story.
I he tone is also set by a string orchestra that plays continuously in the background, which they said "had
a really wonderful out-of-tune quality" (not that it isn't pleasant to listen to). I bis extensive use of the or
chestra, however, was actually a result of bad luck turned good. l.essa and Roland had recorded volumes of
ambient sound and other songs for the soundtrack, but someone broke into their hotel room and stole
everything. Because there was no way to recreate the sound, they started to experiment with music. The end
result, they were delighted to discover, tied the fragments of the film into a unified whole.
So today we really thank the robbers because otherwise we would have gone down a path that wouldn't
have given much clarity to the story," l.essa said.
After they leave San Francisco, l.essa and Roland will remain busy, working on .in exhibit of (Ihristian
Lacroix couture, an opera, a film ... perhaps even a musical ouverture for the World (aip soccer game. J just
hope they get some sleep on the plane.

I EAN-PIERRE A N P LUC PAR DEN N E
Speaking of sleep, the Dardenne brothers certainly didn't got much. They
were slightly jetlagged from their flight from Belgium the night before, but I was
happy to get some good answers before they lapsed into the monosyllabic yes
and no.
"La Promesse," written and directed by both I hardennes, is a difficult story of
a teenager's initiation into the shrinking world of ethics and shared humanity.
Igor, the teenager, is his father's apprentice, learning to run the business of illegal
immigrant smuggling and labor. A vicious business that is currently a very real
problem in Belgium, it provided the perfect setting for the questions the I Ard
ennes wanted to ask: How can people stay human in situations like this? How
can people oppose injustice? How do people deal with evil?
Loaded questions, yes, and key to the development of the characters in the
story. The style and mood of the film smack of bleak realism, but the story is
particularly effective in its evolution ol hope in the midst of an ugly situation.
Unlike many stories where the solution can be seen a mile away, the turn of
events and ol characters occur with realism and without prediction.
And no, the Pardennes rarely light; and yes, they plan to make more movies
together.
The third feature film from the 1 )ardenne brothers, who started off making
documentaries, "La Promesse" opens on June 4 at the Roxie (anema in San
Francisco.

Suddenly taken ill, Yolande Zauberman, writer and diret toi of"( lubbed

with (.ohen Solal, who worked with her lor almost two years as a sort ol I )|
ol the III in s soundtrack. Actually, during the interview, /.auherman called
Philippe from the airport to complain ahout the airline personnel. Appar
ently, she had run into the same unfriendly lolks iliey had encountered on
their way over. Lesson?
"I )on't take Air I ranee," (.ohen Solal said.
Incidentally, it was quite fitting to interview (ohen Solal bet a use music is
the driving force of the film. It is so pervasive, and olten so pounding, that I
thought the film's title might be referring, tongue in t heck, to club music
overkill.
Not so. "(ilubbcd to I )eath" is actually the nameol the main track ol the
movie. A mix ol classical and electronic music, it mesmerized < ohen Solal
when he first heard it and entranced the rest of the crew as well, /auherman
wanted to use music to introduce the audience to the feeling of hcingat a rave.
(lohen Solal explained that the music almost plays a fifth role, creating .1
near-religious experience in the club that carries Lola and l inn to a freedom
that is both personal and shared.
I he music, however, leaves little room lor dialogue and mile li needed si

is a simple story, but the motivations of I .ola and l .mir are unfathomable

Whew. Well, I'm going to act on my stomach and line up at the conces

one) of this festival.
Speaking of themes, I think I'll take a nap too.

Philippe Cohen-Soiai makes himself at
home in America. "Now all we need is some
house music "
nsidc the AMC Kabuki movie theatre in San Francisco, tables overflowed with free
champagne, hors d'oeuvres, biscotti and Newman's Own organic pretzels. So why was
there a line at the concession stand?
That was my question opening night, along with where were the directors of the
evening's four films, and where was Danny Glover, who a theater employee told me was
upstairs? But as I wove in and out of the wine-sipping, freebie-toting people, any direc
tor I might have passed blended right in with everyone else. Danny Glover probably
camouflaged himself with that same wide-eyed, roving look the rest of us had. I did spot
Mayor Willie Brown by the steel drum band, but he left soon after the time requisite for
V

an "appearance."
After the film screenings came the opening night celebration at the War Memorial
Veterans Building. There was hot food, a live band, friendly schmoozing and a beautiful
building to enjoy it all in, but my memories are of other lone journalists wandering
around, as well as two security guards who turned out to be guarding the bathrooms.
After that night, I figured I would leave the responsibility of my meeting filmmakers in
the capable hands of festival publicist Caroline Libresco, who helped arrange all my in
terviews. Here are some people 1 talked with. U
— story and photos by Michelle Chai

JO MKNELL •
I mot J<> Menell, co-director of the Oscar-nominated documentary "Mandela" at Mario's Bo
hemian (ligar Store (]afe. (They do sell cigars, but get this — you can't smoke inside). The first thing
I wanted to know was how lie got Mandela to agree to seven months of being followed, seven
months that, incidentally, included his historic presidential inauguration.
"Well, that was extraordinary," he said. "Because I met him at (my brother's) wedding in '93, and
I was talking about his autobiography. I said, 'So, who's doing the film?' And he said, 'What film?'
and I said, 'The film ofyour life.' I le said, 'No one.' 1 said, 'Really?' 1 le said, 'No one.' "
"I took a deep breath and said, 'Well, I'd like to do it.' Anil he looked at me long and hard and he
said, 'Yes, that seems OK.' "
Menell started fund raising immediately, even enlisting the help of friend Jonathan Demme,
whose exact words were, "I )ude, I'd be honored to produce it. (Menell first met Demme through
mutual friend and legendary director Bernardo Bertolucci, but that's another story).
Menell wanted to show Mandela the man vs. Mandela the icon as captured in personal scenes of
Mandela shaving and recounting his boyhood experience of being circumcised. Mandela's role as a
political figure is, ol course, inescapable, but MenelPs desire to explore his many facets meant also
showing his role as husband to wives Kvclyn and Winnie.
Mandela" plays at 7 p.m. Saturday at the AM( Kabuki, with a post-screening party afterwards. For
tickets, call (415) 441-7373.

FINN TAYLOR
Finn Taylor had been up until 4 a.m. celebrating the screening of his film when I met him eight hours later at a
cafe. But Taylor is no stranger to 16-hour days, which he averaged during the shooting of the film he wrote and
directed, "Dream with the Fishes." (I think the guy cutting pipe next to our table kept us awake, too.)
So what made him write a story about the adventures of a suicidally depressed voyeur (David Arquette) and a
terminally ill heroin addict (Brad Hunt)?
"It's loosely autobiographical," Taylor said. "I had this friend, Mike, who would do things I would never do in a
million years. We d travel around, and 1 d watch him do the things I wouldn't do. But we got in a big fight in New
Orleans and went our separate ways, and I went to Europe. While I was in Europe, I got word that he was sick and
I came back and used the money I had been saving to help him live out some of his fantasies in his last few weeks."
Because it was a personal story and because of a bad Hollywood treatment of his earlier script, "Pontiac
Moon," Taylor decided to make this film independently. The decision to direct it himself— he had never directed
before — came about differently. Originally, someone else was going to do it.
But, Taylor said, "I was hiking in the hills and I was listening to the radio, and Mike liked really bad music —
he liked Meatloaf and Billy Joel. I was listening to the radio, saying 'Should I do this, or should I not?' I lis favorite
billy Joel song came on. Then I switched channels and Meatloaf was being interviewed, and then his favorite
Meatloaf song was played. So I kind of took that as a sign."
The experience was rewarding for Taylor, even though arrangements for all his major locations fell through the
night before shooting.
Filmed in 54 locations around the Bay Area in an amazing 26 days, "Dream with the Fishes" opens in July.

LUCAS BEI.VAUX
I was glad to hear that "Pour Rire! (lust for Laughs!)," Lucas Belvaux's
dramatic comedy about marital infidelity, was not a personal story, seeing
that Madame Belvaux was sitting t>nly a lew feet away from the French di
rector. Instead, "Pour Rire!", which Belvaux wrote and directed, is a new
take on an old theme.
"It is like a jazz standard," Belvaux said. "You have the same melody, hut
you play it your own way."
And, indeed, a plot summary of the film couples travails would be dull.
But using Belvaux's carefully crafted dialogue and controlled comic mo
ments, actors lean Pierre Leaud and Ornella Muti miraculously resuscitate
the drama. Belvaux, himself an actor, wrote the role of the desperate hus
band especially lor Leaud, who is best known for his work with Truffaut.

I'd lose the fun of both."
