## The 						Velvet Underground "Loaded" 
### 
The Velvet Underground, founded by Lou
Reed and John dale, is one of the most influ
ential bands in rock 'n' roll — providing the
foundation for almost all forms of "alterna
tive" music, including punk, grunge and even
the droning rhythms of techno and industrial.
In its four albums the band explores widely
different musical styles, such as the raging
metal of "White l ight / White Heat" and the
acoustic ballads of "The Velvet Underground."
"Loaded," the fourth and last album, is

their most deliberately pop-oriented effort,
digging into American traditions of blues,
rock and doo-wop. The latest version is a two
disc, digitally remastered reissue of the origi
nal. Unfortunately, the original remains
somewhat incomplete because Reed walked
out before production (to his later regret) and
because it does not feature drummer Maureen
Tucker, who was pregnant at the time of the
recording.
I lowever, the songs are some of the group's

finest and most upbeat, each one a hymn to
rock 'n' roll suffused with a sense of the salva
tion that is only possible through music.
The oft-covered "Sweet lane," featuring one
of the most irresistible chord progressions in
rock history, exults in the freedom of music:
"Jack is in his corset, and Jane is in her vest,
and me, I'm in a rock V roll band," while pro
viding sly political commentary on the end of
the '60s "Jack plays ... The March of the
Wooden Soldiers ... All you protest kids?"
The album itself has few flaws. One is its
song order, which weighs the second half
down with three melancholy songs in a row,
including the apocalyptic "Oh! Sweet
Nuthin'." Reed also inexplicably allowed
bassist Doug Yule to sing some of the songs,
which works well on the Beatles-esque "Who
Loves the Sun" but fatally flaws "New Age."
Unfortunately, the reissue is a bit excessive.
The second disc — alternate takes of the songs
and some demos — is worth listening to once
or twice but will not receive heavy rotation.
The only particularly interesting demos are
the "Heroin" remake "Ocean," and the early
versions of "Satellite of Love" and "Oh Gin,"
which would later appear on Reed's solo al
bums.
However, despite these flaws, the reissue
is still a must-have because of its digitally re
mastered sound and extended versions of
"Sweet Jane" (including the "heavenly wine
and roses" bridge) and "Rock & Roll."
"Loaded," while not the best Velvet Under
ground album, is still a vital part of any rock
'n' roll collection.
