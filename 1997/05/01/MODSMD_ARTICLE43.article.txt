# DeDeche Mode
## "Ultra" 
### 
It's a long way from "People arc People,"
hut I >epeche Mode's new release is the neither
new nor revolutionary: It's simply Depeche
Mode Version 10.0 (or whatever album num
ber this is). Like a software upgrade, this disc
highlights Depeche Mode's new features:
minus one musician, post suicidal and hero
in rehabilitated (for the time being). The
"beta release" metaphor is particularly apt for
this 11 -track platter, rich as it is in I)M's char
acteristic synthesizer voicings, creative appro
priation ol technology and streamlined pro
duction. Oh,and it's called "Ultra,"as in post
super, post extra strength: ultra.
But as in most commercial products, the
new packaging fails to deliver any dramatic
changes in quality or content. Unlike fellow
supergroups U2 or RI M, Depeche Mode
never really goes out on a limb or packs any
surprises. But it's hard to fault them for stick
ing with what works. And it's hard to accuse
them of bandwagoneering a la U2's"Pop."
I ack ol direction and pioneering notwith
standing, "Ultra" swings with the best of De
peche Mode's releases. Packed full of senti

mental ballads and radio-friendly units, it's
still a good disc. Kicking off with the already
hit single "Barrel of a Gun," there's plenty of
bumping synth to please on this disc. And in
the throbbing and syrupy "Home" there's
plenty of euro-dance thumping going on; I
can just imagine the swarms of international
teenagers who will be bouncing to this tune in
the packed all-night discotheques of the
Greek Isles.
My favorite tracks are probably the two in
strumental: "Uselink" and "Jazz Thieves."
These both have mature and interesting beats
and music; both are intricate segues into
"Useless" and"The Bottom Line," respective
ly-
Sure, the band has been through a lot. Dave
Gillian's heroin addiction and recovery is no
laughing matter, and the seriousness of his re
habilitation shows in some of the tunes' emo
tional, albeit cliched lyrics. While "Ultra" is
no revolutionary disc, recovery is no revolu
tionary theme. But it's deeply personal and
very intense, and the beauty of this album is
that thev can lav it on the line and still make

the music moving in classic DM fashion.
