# Silverchair
## "Freak Show" 
### 
When Silverchair's music
came to the United States in
1995, it was welcomed by listen
ers and radio stations who could
not get enough of their Pearl
Jam-ish sound.
Adding to their novelty was
the fact that these three Aus
tralians were only 16 years old.
Their age and sound combined
to sell albums, and the hit single
"Tomorrow" ventured danger
ously close to overplay on
nascent mod-rock stations
across the country.
The logic in the music indus
try ran something like this: "If
they can be that good when
they're 16, imagine how good
they'll be when they're 20 or 25."
Expectations were high for
the band's sophomore release
"Freak Show." The operative
word here is "sophomore."
"Freak Show" is a musical septic
tank.
Though it has its moments of
mediocrity, for most of the
album you would swear that the
garage band in your neighbor
hood (a la "Wyld Stallions") had
sneaked into a studio. The stu
dio afforded Silverchair the op
portunity not only to sound bad
but to sound bad and over-pro
duced, a deadly combination in
a '90s music scene that is mov
ing toward the acoustic.
Silverchair seems to have
three hopes on this album: One,
that no one will notice that it's
not young anymore; two, that
no one will actually listen to the
lyrics; and three, that everyone
will be too busy moshing to re
alize that the music sucks. All
three hopes will be dashed.
Recycling is a major concept
on "Freak Show." The melodies
are recycled. The rhymes are re
cycled. The lyrical despair feels
like an unending cycle.
("Buddy, you're upset. I get the
point.")
The aforementioned flashes
of mediocrity occur on the
more cleanly instrumented
"Abuse Me," "Cemetery," "Pop
Song for Us Rejects" and"The
Closing." (I told you the subject
matter was cheery.) The rest of
the album is a mess of unin
spired lyrics and over-used dis
tortion.
