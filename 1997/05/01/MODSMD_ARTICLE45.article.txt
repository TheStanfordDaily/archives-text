# Tom Pacheco
## "Woodstock Winter" 
### 
I'm going to try to be fair to this album even
though I'm in a bad mood. Why am I in a bad
mood? one might ask. Listen to "Woodstock
Winter," and you'll understand.
This is the album that's going to be the answer
to the trivia question, "On what album recorded
at Levon Helm's studio in Woodstock, N.Y., in
the winter of 1996, did members ofThe Band in
cluding Helm, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson
supply backing vocals?" Indeed, the support of
those celebrated rock musicians makes this
album's failure that much more of a tragedy.
What is good on this album is Tom Pacheco's
strong vocals and the bluesy feel he imparts to
his pop-rock. And to his credit, Pacheco wrote
all of the tracks on this album except "Christmas
on Times Square." I'm not sure that's something
anyone would necessarily want to have on their
resume, though. Or maybe Tom is too hip to
have a resume.
Pacheco certainly seems to believe that he is
qualified to determine what is hip and what isn't.
In the first track, "The Hills of Woodstock," he
attempts to establish his legitimacy as one of the
original crowd of counterculture rockers, one of
the guys who was there "in the time they called
the golden days." Sorry, Tom, but there isn't a 20-
something hippie kid who considers Woodstock
to be one of the hip places of the "golden days."
There was a big concert, man, but that's about it.
It sure wasn't San Francisco in the 19605.

In tact, I'm not sure anyone, hippie or not,
would call the 1960s the "golden days." But that
is exactly the sort ot narrow self-complacency
that sinks this album's lyrics over and over again.
On the folk-rock "A Women's Tear," Pacheco
contuses mysogynistic sentiment with a celebra
tion of women; in the down-home rockin' "Real
Americans?" he condemns Timothy McVeigh
for the Oklahoma City bombing. Show some
taste, Tom. Wait for the trial, alright?
I am confused by the confluence of themes in
the songs 011 this album. On one side is Pacheco's
fierce patriotism ("Real Americans?" and the
pop ballad "Nobody Ever Killed Billy the Kid")
and his adamant Christianity (expressed solely
through pop-rock on "The Sacred," "Four An
gels" and"The Snowstorm"). But these would
seem to conflict with his avowed hippie sensibil
ities ("The 11 ills of Woodstock," "Jerry's (lone").
And yet, without resolving this presentation of
himself, Pacheco demands that we accept the
paradox of his sensibilities as a nationalistic,
dogmatic liberal.
Fuck that. The only song that pulls its weight
on this track is the romping blues tribute "I ley
I ley Robert Johnson" (infinitely better than the
above mentioned tribute to the late Grateful
Dead front man Jerry Garcia). But one track
does not an album make. And that's all this
album's got.
