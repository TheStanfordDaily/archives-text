# Outhouse
## "Welcome" 
### 
Outhouse kicks oft "Welcome" with
some good old fashioned sound check
like leedhack. l air enough. A simple hass
rill keeps the song pumping, while a
medium tempo makes "Cienius Boy"
catchy. The instrumentals in the song al
ternate between pop and experimental,
while the vocals stay strong and consis
tent.
Next up: "Bleed." The formula doesn't
work quite as well as it did the first time,
although there is some cool Smashing
Pumpkins-esqe psychedelia. (Remember
the solo from "Mayonnaise"?) The album
picks it up again with "Savior," but by now
the listener has Outhouse figured out.
The group takes basic chords and re
dundant rhythms, then heaves on butter
scotch, chocolate chips, candy sprinkles
and ... presto! You've got Outhouse. It
works OK, but it's been done before.
"Familiar" is a tribute to the fabulous
metal singers of the l9H()s, while lacklus
ter lyrics like "We could c.ill it I'amil
iar / We could call it anytime / We could
call it familiar / Or we could call il a tie"
make the failure of "l-ainiliar" complete.
The entire album is a battlefield in an epic
struggle between easy hooks anil actual
musical expression. Fxpression puts up a
valiant ef fort, the kind that does the I 'nit
ed States proud, but its front lines are
overwhelmed by the fourth song. Il

makes tor sonic interesting listening,
though. Vou can't help hut root for Out
house along the way and hope that they
pull it out of the hat.
The tunes kiiul of grow on you. My the
time you gel to "Strange I yes," the ear fig
ures, "well, it you can't heat 'em, join
cm." 1 vcryone needs to hear a little alter
na cheese every now and again, hut it still
isn't that good.
Meanwhile, hack in the trenches, a
Stone Temple Pilots like "Army Ants'
guitar and stronger vocals drive the title
track, "Welcome. "Undressed leatures
brick heavy distortion, hut it's too little,
too late. Plus the hass chorus only consists
of two notes. The winner is . . . easy
hooks, in the 11 th round.
C )ulhouse's liner notes include a photo
ol fates smoking three cigarettes at once.
II he keeps it up, one ol two things will
happen, father his voice gets a little harsh
er and the vocals won't he as annoying the
second time around or he loses his voice
altogether. This reviewer finds hoth
equally appealing. Ihe group has onlv
been around for two years; perhaps a
good live years ol touring and old age will
kit k the rookie sound out ol them.
"Welcome" is worth listening to, hut it
isn't worth $1 V I gave them an extra hall
star for elfort.
