## "Waikiki" 
### 
I lie liner notes to Fluf's new album,
"Waikiki," proudly proclaim that "there's no
denying the genius of this trio; it's all right
here." No matter how often 1 read self-laud
ing CD jackets, and no matter what the band,
it always strikes me as an unnecessary ego
boost. In this case, however, Fluf is only ex
aggerating the truth slightly â€” not com
pletely distorting it.
Combining elements from fellow San
Diego bands Rocket from the Crypt and
Uncle Joe's Big Old Driver, Fluf creates a
crunchy, semi-hardcore (think pop-core)
sound, offset by melodic harmonies. While
the band undeniably rocks like nobody's
business, the overall effect is, we 11... fluffy.
"Skip Beat," the first song on their fourth
album, jumps right in your face with a grind
ing guitar line as lead singer () (pronounced
"oh") belts out the lines, "Say what you like
when I walk by, but your words won't make
me die." This track somehow manages to
achieve a Rocket-like dissonance without
sacrificing melody.
The next track, "Got Everything," mellows
things out, and the chorus is a catchy, Uncle
Joc's-esque rebuttal to spoiled rich kids: "How
can you cry when you've got everything?"
"Bump" calls to mind Dinosaur Jr., and"The
Chooser" makes me think of Veruca Salt's

"Seether" for some reason (maybe it's the cho
rus: "Save me from the loser /1 don't wanna
be the chooser").
The last track also showcases Fluf's silly
sense of humor with a short intro in whit li a
computerized voice announces, "Welcome
to the fourth I luf album called 'Waikiki,' you
ass-munching pig."
Overall, O's lyrics are more serious; failed
relationships and fame are the topics of
choice. As he sings on "Pipe Bomb," a tribute
to friends who have overdosed (such as Sub
lime's Brad Nowell, to whom the album is
dedicated), "I'm not like you /1 never wanna
be that cool." One is left unsure if O is assert
ing his immunity to fame or il lie's just in de
nial.
When waxing poetic about women, as he
does on "(ihocolate" (nonetheless one of the
best tracks 011 the album), O often ends up
sounding trite or simply ridiculous: "Ciirls
are like chocolate, can't you see/and they
melt inside of me / sweet for a moment, then
they're gone/try and figure what went
wrong."
Surprisingly, the lyrics don't get in the way
of the music at all on "Waikiki"; the words O
sings seem to matter less than the harmonies.
In spite of a couple of less-than-inspired

tracks, "Waikiki" is truly .111 excellent album.
Whether Fluf s members are musical genius
es remains to be seen, but this album firmly

establishes them as one of the foremost
hands of the growing San Diego scene.
