112 low to tell between love and sexual desire?
"All Over Me," the debut film by the Sichel sisters, is an in
tense look at the relationship between two high school girls
who are each learning to deal with a sexuality that doesn't net
essarily make sense to either of them. Take I lien Clara Subkoff):
She's beautiful (using the (Jen X definition), and her skinny
platinum blond visage constantly flits across the screen wearing
this or that skimpy outfit. Then there's Claude (Alison Folland):
She's tall, not-so-skinny, baggily-clothed and absolutely in lovi
with l.llen. As HI lens relationship with her new boyfriend
Mark, sinks / soars to new levels of intimacy and violence, her
relationship with Claude grows strained. The film centers
around Claude learning to define and accept how she feels
about Ellen.
Hxpertly shot, the film has the same sort of live-action cam
era feeling that "kids" and "C oris Town" boasted but with less
focus. The cast of characters is diverse and believable, but there
are too many of them. There's Claude and l.llen and Mark, but
you also get introduced to Mark's friends, Claude's mother's
boyfriend, a young lady with pink hair who plays in a grrrl

band, a young man who lives downstairs, and Claude's boss and
co-worker in the pizza parlor. All these people are related to the
plot but it i- not absolutely necessary that they are there.
My the same token, the film hints at other stories without ac
tually going into them. There's too much information. Claude's
mother's boyfriend seems interested in Claude sexually, but this
doesn't get followed up at all. There are a lot of very stagnant
scenes of Claude roller skating through New York at night.
A big plus to the film is that it deals with coming-of-age for
the queer community without coming across like some sort of
lecture. Furthermore, the Sichel sisters manage to insert mo
ments of humor into an otherwise very sobering film without
ruining it, the musical score is great (Ani DiFranco and Patti
Smith fans will be pleased), and the acting is superb. Generally,
this film represents a great deal of good decision making in
terms of casting and script but poor decision making in terms
of editing. (Nearly, the director was afraid of making a long film,
and it shows. Too much goes on in a short period of time.
People who get into "chick llicks" will definitely like this one,
as well as anyone interested in coming-of-age films. The story

takes many interesting turns and will impress both the
moviephile and non-moviephile alike, if only for the cine
matography and acting.
