# Commandments
## 
### 
lor .111 assortment of reasons, this high-concept
film just did not work for me. Typically, I get easily
drawn into movies that have characters who, say,
can't lie for 24 hours or who have to save a town
from an active volcano. Hut "Commandments,"
whith works under the premise ol a desperate man
trying to break .ill 10 commandments, is largely
unrealistic and unfunny.
Ii .ill starts out innocently enough as we are first
introduced to the downtrodden Seth Warner
(Aidan (,>1111111) lacing Job like trials, Set Ii has re
cently lost his wile 111 .1 drowning accident, and
soon he'll lose his job, his house and almost his
own life. Acting .is the narrator is the sardonic
I larry I ucc (Anthony I al'aglia). I le agrees, along
with his wife, Rachel (Courteney Cox), who is
Seth s sister in law, to t.ike Seth into their home.
These three characters now begin to discover a
series of things about themselves 111 the harsh

world ol New York
( ity. Rachel is try
ing to negotiate
with .1 pious elderly
couple who gave
away .1 large sum ol
money that had
mistakenly been
placed in their sav
ings account.
I larry, who is a
doctor, realizes
that be is unintcn
tionally breaking
several of the com
mandments on a
daily basis. I ventu
ally, he tragically
(.ills from his "per
feet" life and sym
bolically begins to
trade places with

the more holy Seth. In the meantime, Seth makesa
checklist of the commandments, and we see him
systematically go about his business of breaking
them as though he were going grocery shopping.
I will admit that the idea of a person trying to
break those holy rules sounded like it could be
come a grandiose farce. Religious matters are diffi
cult to manage in a comedy, but I was hoping that
this concept could be handled in a smart and funny
manner.
I was wrong. Instead, I got three characters who
merely look like they are going through the routine
of daily life. The biblical allusions mixed into the
story feel like they are thrown in just to lit the reli
gious subject matter. "Commandments" felt like
one holy mess, and I am almost positive that any
one, from Moses to the pope, who saw this movie
would commandcth thee not to see it.

Guess how many commandments Aidan Quinn (r) is breaking in this scene.
