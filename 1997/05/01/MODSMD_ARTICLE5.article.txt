## Twelve new Knight Fellows coming for 1997-98 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Twelve U.S. journalists will take a year
off to go back to school, after being awarded
John S. Knight Fellowships at Stanford for
the 1997-98 school year.
The winners' backgrounds range from
Johannesburg bureau chief of the Los Ange
les Times to news correspondent for MTV.
While at Stanford, fellows will research a
journalism topic of their choice by enrolling
in classes and special seminars and will take
a leave of absence from their current jobs.
The fellowships are funded primarily
from a grant from the John S. and James L.
Knight Foundation.
Although the fellows will not earn any
academic credit or degrees through their
work, the program's director, James Risser,
said the fellowships offer participants an in
valuable opportunity.
"They have an opportunity for a year of
refreshment from work and for intense

learning at Stanford," said Risser. "It will
make them even better journalists than
they already are."
New fellow Gary Polakovic, an environ
mental writer for the Riverside, (Calif.)
Press-Enterprise, said the program offers a
unique chance to "rejuvenate and reflect"
after 12 years of environmental journalism.
"This is a good time to stop in midstream
and assess where I want to take the rest of
my career," he said. "I want to finish it off
and do it right. This is a really great oppor
tunity to strive to the next level."
Polakovic plans to study market-based
environmental solutions by studying the
role of business and economics in the envi
ronment.
James Bettinger, deputy director of the
program, said the fellows are encouraged to
contribute to campus life through interac
tion with students.
