# Journalism fellows named
## Twelve new Knight Fellows coming for 1997-98 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Twelve U.S. journalists will take a year
off to go back to school, after being awarded
John S. Knight Fellowships at Stanford for
the 1997-98 school year.
The winners' backgrounds range from
Johannesburg bureau chief of the Los Ange
les Times to news correspondent for MTV.
While at Stanford, fellows will research a
journalism topic of their choice by enrolling
in classes and special seminars and will take
a leave of absence from their current jobs.
The fellowships are funded primarily
from a grant from the John S. and James L.
Knight Foundation.
Although the fellows will not earn any
academic credit or degrees through their
work, the program's director, James Risser,
said the fellowships offer participants an in
valuable opportunity.
"They have an opportunity for a year of
refreshment from work and for intense

learning at Stanford," said Risser. "It will
make them even better journalists than
they already are."
New fellow Gary Polakovic, an environ
mental writer for the Riverside, (Calif.)
Press-Enterprise, said the program offers a
unique chance to "rejuvenate and reflect"
after 12 years of environmental journalism.
"This is a good time to stop in midstream
and assess where I want to take the rest of
my career," he said. "I want to finish it off
and do it right. This is a really great oppor
tunity to strive to the next level."
Polakovic plans to study market-based
environmental solutions by studying the
role of business and economics in the envi
ronment.
James Bettinger, deputy director of the
program, said the fellows are encouraged to
contribute to campus life through interac
tion with students.
"Dorms often draw on fellows through
asking them to speak on their par
ticular specialty," he said.
The fellows are chosen through
a rigorous application process.
They must submit samples of
their work, letters of recommen
dation and essays about their ca
reers and intended study plans at
Stanford.
The program will also include
six international Knight Fellows,
who will be announced next
month.
In addition to Polakovic, the
other U.S. Knight Fellows are:
Alvin Bessent, an editorial writer

for Newsday; John Boudreau, a
reporter for the Contra Costa
Times; Bob Drogin, the Johannes
burg bureau chief of the Los Ange
les Times; Ann Grimes, the
deputy national editor of the
Washington Post; Curtis Krueger,
a reporter and columnist for the
St. Petersburg Times; Kevin
McKenna, the editorial director of
The New York Times Electronic
Media Co.; Robert Oster, the pro
ducer of Dateline NBC; Debra
Shapiro, the senior producer for
special projects at WCVB-TV,
Tabitha Soren, a senior political
correspondent for MTV News;
Susan Warner, a business re
porter for the Philadelphia In
quirer; and Harriet Washington, a
freelance medical writer.
