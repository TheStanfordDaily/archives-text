# Romy and Michele's High School Reunion
## 
### 
On the eve of their 10th high school
reunion, Romy and Michele are
sprawled out on their couch, stuffing
their faces into a depressed stupor.
Why? Because, when their reunion
survey forces them to take stock of
their lives, they discover that they have
very little of which to take stock. And
so to the couch they go, deciding that
if you're an unemployed ex-salesper
son (Michele) and / or a cashier at a
car dealership (Romy) and you aren't
engaged or married, then it's just bet
ter not to go to your reunion at all.
But Romy and Michele are not so
easily beaten. With their awe-inspir
ing naivete, they decide that people at
the reunion will perceive them as
being as successful as long as they look
successful. You aren't what you eat.
You are what you wear. So off to the re
union they go, reinvented as success
ful businesswomen, the inventors of
the Post-It note. "Everyone's heard of
Post-Its!" exclaims Romy as she tries
to convince a skeptical Michele that
this invention is an admirable enough
feat.
As played by Mira Sorvino and I.isa
Kudrow, respectively, Romy and
Michele are a hilarious, lovable pair.
This is not an unpredictable movie,
but Sorvino and Kudrow make sure
that you overlook that. They are en
dearingly stupid, and there's never ac
tually a time when vou think, "What

idiots!" because you're too busy root
ing for them.
If Sorvino and Kudrow's dumb
and-dumber antics become too much
for you, the always-funny Janeane
Garofalo appears as a jaded, deadpan
classmate who went from being an all
black-wearing, chain-smoking loser
to being an all-black-wearing, chain
smoking success story, the inventor of
fast-burn cigarettes for "people on the
go." For every dose of Romy and
Michelle's bright spring pastels, we
thankfully get a dose of Garofalo's sar
castic wit, keeping everyone happy.
The most notable strength of
"Romy and Michele's" is its ability to
not take itself seriously. It has no pre
tensions of being anything more than
a goofy formula movie, so it aims to be
the best goofy formula movie it can
be. It succeeds on almost all counts,
complete with hilarious '80s high
school flashbacks (with Romy over
weight and Michele in a back brace),
nasty "popular" people and the geek
who succeeds. At one point, Romy
and Michele don shiny pastel sheaths
and hit the dance tloor with this geek
who made good, and the three of them
perform a sort of interpretive dance to
"Time After Time," proving for once
and for all that the Romvs and
Micheles of the world are not so easily
beaten.
