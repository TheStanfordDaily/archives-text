# Volcano
## 
### 
If you thought that the only hazards associated with living in
the Hay Area were earthquakes and computer-code theft, think
again. Even though the chance is extremely small, there is the
possibility that lava could break through the tectonic plates in
the event of an earthquake. In "Volcano," Los Angeles, the city
ofdisasters (and cool special-effects movies), becomes the first
metropolis to sit right on top of such an instant volcano.
If this sounds too much like "Dante's Peak," despair not. "Vol
cano" benefits from much quicker action. It starts off with an
earthquake that causes minor damage to some tunnels near the
l a Brea tarpits. When a crew goes in to evaluate the damage,
nearly all of them are steamed to death. When a lake above this
tunnel system is found to have heated up 10 degrees in a single
day, Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones), head of the Office of Emer
gency Management, realizes there may be a serious problem.
All hell starts to break loose when another earthquake sets
off the volcano. Lava flows down the crowded streets of down
town L.A., destroying everything in its path. Moments after a
tire truck gets hit by flying debris, causing it to flip and eject the
driver, a car actually melts away. It was stunning but shocking
to see a human being liquefy in the lava, especially considering
the fact that (once again) not a single dog in this film dies.
After Roark temporarily averts the danger by building a wall,
the volcano continues to rage under the city. By flowing

through tunnel systems, the lava heads for the hospital where
thousands of people have gathered for shelter, liven though
Roark's daughter is among those at the hospital who are about
to become toast, the acting never gets overly dramatic. This is
probably what sets "Volcano" apart the most from "Dante's
Peak": There are no poorly developed relationships to distract
you from the action.

I his movie is also very appealing because it deals with a
major disaster in an urban area, a place where most people
assume that they are protected Irom natural disasters. II you
enjoyed " Twister," "Dante's Peak" or "Independence Day,"
you're certain to enjoy the more original concept ot "Vol
cano."
