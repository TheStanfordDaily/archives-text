"Dukes of Hazard" meets "The Godfather."
Tasy Rider" meets "The Sting." Bill Paxton
meets Marky Mark. If we lived in the world of
"The Player," "Traveller" could lie pitched as
any one of these things. Then again, if we lived
in the world of "The Player," a small indepen
dent movie with a first-time director and an
actor-turned-producer would probably not
exist. Unfortunately, rather than being a tri
umph of artistic integrity, "Traveller" ends up
being flatly predictable and fairly unenjoyable.
The Travellers are a group of Irish-Ameri
can grifters who shun the outside world and
make their living by sending out the men to
con their way across the South. At the heart of
I lie Travellers is Paxton's Bokky, a secretly
kind-hearted con man with a past. When the
leader of the Bokky Bunch, Boss Jack (Jack
Palance-twin Luke Askew), ostracizes an out-

sider, Bokky takes the young man under his
wing and they set off. Bokky's young protege,
Pat, is played by Mark Wahlberg (here thank
fully covering the tighty whities we know to be
lurking beneath), who does a respectable job
with a one-dimensional character.
The problem isn't the performances, which
are all fine — especially the gruffly funny
James Gammon and the luminous Julianna
Margulies. First-time director Jack Green,
Clint Eastwood's longtime cinematographer,
also does a good job. The problem is the script.
The dialogue is at best trite, and the plot is pre
dictable to the last minute. Bokky remains
fuzzy throughout, and his relationship with
Pat never goes below the surface. Similarly,
Bokky's romance with Margulies' Jean is re
flective of the distance between the characters
and the audience; it is hard to care about char

actcrs who are not given much to do.
The heart of the plot, a scam involving the
much derided (and inexplicably so) gypsies, is
also the most unfortunate aspect of the film
an abrupt transition to stock violence and
uninspired slow-motion direction. This not
only serves to emphasize the lack o! audience
interest or emotion these characters have
evoked but also is almost laughably pre
dictable.
"Traveller" attempts to enter a world entire
ly outside our own, but it never manages to
give us much of a glimpse of it. Instead, it me
anders between a road movie and .1 gangster
film and never really feels comfortable as either
one. By seeking to define themselves as making
a "character driven" film, the producers juggle
genres instead of seeking new ground.
