### 
If ever there was an actor who in
spired the phenomenon of group
renting videos, it is John Cusack. Le
gions of teens, particularly female
ones, have conquered weekend what
do-you-guys-want- to-do- tonight

boredom by heading out to the local
video store to scavenge for whatever
Cusack videos have not already been
scooped up by like-minded adoles
cents. Of course, graduation from high
school did not signify the end of such
nights of boredom. But before you set
out for a Cusack group-renting, keep
in mind that the combination of
videos you choose is significant. So

keep your fingers crossed next time
you're at the video store and hope that you're
able to rent some of these.
"Better Off I )ead," "The Sure Thing" and
"Say Anything," also known as the I loly ( u
sack Trinity, will have you on a Cusack high
for weeks. The characters he plays — I ..me
Myer, Walter Gibson and the extraordinary
l.loyd I )obler — are perhaps the best repre
sentatives of that whole '80s anust thing,

where the lovable underdog gets, among
other things, the girl. (In the event that you
can only find "Better Off Dead," be sure to
look for "One Crazy Summer," which could
be considered its thematic sequel, complete
with many of the same actors and ridiculous

sight
gags.)
The only
real the
matic tie

to "The Journey of Natty Clann," "bight Men
Out" and"The Grifters" is that all three are
dramas. However, there's a nice progression
in Cusack's acting that's visible when these
three are watched together. In "Natty Gann,"
Cusack's character befriends Meredith
Salinger's NattyCann on her search lor her fa
ther. Cusack plays baseball player buck
Weaver in "bight Men Out," a drama about
the Chicago White Sox's plot to throw the
1919 World Series. And in"The (irifters," ( ai
sack plays .1 con man who gels sold out by
both his girlfriend (Annette bening) and his
mother (Anjelica I iuston).
"The Map of the I luman I leart," "Bullets
()ver Broadway" and "( ity I lall" are excellent
examples of (lusack's range, even though each
also exhibits his characteristic portrayal of an
ideologue's rude awakening. For example, in
"City Hall," Cusack plays Kevin Calhoun, a

deputy mayor of New York who uncovers cor
ruption in the city government. Al Pacino,
Danny Aiello and Bridget Fonda are included
in the ensemble cast.
"Sixteen Candles," "Stand By Me" and
'The Flayer" are the I'm-desperate-for-any
thing-with-John-Cusack-in-it category. All
three are well-known, high-quality movies
that you'd initially rent independent of the
fact that Cusack makes small cameos in each.

But Cusack's appearance in "Sixteen Candles"
as Anthony Michael Hall's sidekick, Bryce, is
reason enough to rent this movie once more.
The above movies are merely a smattering
of the films that mark Cusack's excellent ca
reer. Provided that your local video store is
willing, Cusack provides enough material to
keep the group-renting remedy to boredom
alive and well.
