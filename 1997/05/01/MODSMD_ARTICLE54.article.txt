## Waiting for a show 
### Zachary Roberts 
As I sit writing this piece, Rinc-A-Delt 1997
comes to another indistinguishable close on
that tract ofland known as either Wilbur Beach
or Wilbur Field. Yes, it's spring again, and the
only venue that the Stanford campus can sup
ply for a band is Wilbur Field.
1 low has this happened? This school used to
have a reputation for its influence and promi
nence as an indicator of college students' musi
cal tastes. But no more. It's certainly not because
of a lack of suitable places for shows. Or is it?
Frost Amphitheater: Frost, reopened a few
years ago from its spell of Loma Prieta repairs,
has not hosted any big bands since the Univer
sity banned the Grateful Dead from playing
there in 1989 after the 1980s witnessed eight

years of two-day consecutive shows. Aside
from Rinc-A-Delt a few years back, no band
has visited this venerable site.
Memorial Auditorium: The acoustics aren't
that bad but the seating is. The concert net
work scored points by bringing Beck there last
quarter, and acts like the Jesus and Mary Chain
have performed there in the past. But as any
one who's seen a show there can attest, it's just
not a good place to groove.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium: The only reliable
spot on campus for good sound and good acts.
Muddy Waters, Louis Bellison and Cake have
all put on great shows at Dink. So why the long
wait between the movers and the shakers?
Kresge Auditorium: Undergraduates swal

lowed some of their resentment toward the
Law School when Ben Harper tore up Kresge
last year. And since then it's just grown back
and grown back some more.
Braun Auditorium: The Music Department
keeps Braun reserved for "serious" musicians
who play "real" music.
The Coffee House: The only spot on cam
pus that can accommodate acts ranging from
Aquarium Rescue Unit and Melissa Ferrick to
students playing solo folk guitar. Too bad it
doesn't approximate a real hangout like a real
bar does.
White Plaza: Good crowds for free
lunchtime shows generally by local acts that
amuse even if they don't entertain.

KZSU: The weekly Wednesday Night Live at
9 makes KZSU's studio the hottest spot on
campus for live concerts. Bummer that you
can't actually see the hands, though. And hum
mer that Battle of the Bands winner Lifskada is
getting screwed out of their prize, a slot on the
show.
EBF, Synergy, the Deke house: Three stu
dent residences that have semi-regular parties
with live bands instead of the prom-night DJs
that dominate Row parties. Not bad for a
bunch of stoned kids.
Maybe there is a reasonable range of venues
on campus to support whoever comes our way.
So my question is, why doesn't anybody come
our way?
