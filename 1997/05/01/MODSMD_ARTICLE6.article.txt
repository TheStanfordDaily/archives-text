# Nike founder speaks at Biz School
## Defends labor practices and encourages would-be entrepreneurs 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
Stanford graduate and Nike founder
and CEO Philip Knight defended his
company's much-maligned labor record
yesterday afternoon to a packed audi
ence at Bishop Auditorium.
While Knight was at the Graduate
School of Business in the 19605, he
wrote a business plan for the shoe com
pany he later started, earning an A on
the paper and in the class.
"One of the myths is that Nike
makes a huge margin on its products,"
Knight said. The margin is roughly the
same as that of Reebok and Converse,

who have not attracted the same bad
publicity as Nike, he said.
"We basically make our profit on vol
ume," Knight explained. It works out
on average that one out of two Ameri
cans buys a pair of Nike shoes every
year.
Contrary to media depictions of
Nike's factory in Vietnam as a sweat
shop, Knight said there are buildings
for prayer, a post office, a "huge park,
great athletic facilities," dormitories,
and other amenities.
While Knight acknowledged that
wages paid in the Southeast Asian cou n -
tries are low by Western standards, lie
said the amounts are higher than what

the workers made before.
Knight said he talieved people are
better off today in countries such as
Vietnam and Indonesia and wages will
continue to grow there.
Nevertheless, nongovernmental or
ganizations often attack Nike to get
publicity, Knight said. To prevent labor
abuses, Nike has contracted Krnst and
Young, a major public accounting firm,
to monitor its factories in these coun
tries.
It has also hired former lIS Am has
sador to the United Nations, Andrew
Youmr, to review implementation of

Students and community members protested Nike's labor record yesterday in front of Bishop Auditorium.
Nike's code of conduct, Knight ex
plained.
Not satisfied with these efforts,
about 40 protesters, including
Stanford students and other ac
tivists, marched outside Bishop
Auditorium. They carried a variety
of signs and chanted, "Hey, hey,
what do you say. Work for Nike, get
no pay."
Noting that Knight's speech
was a part of a lecture series called
"View from the Top," one protest
er, Kevin Danaher, asked sarcasti
cally, "top of what... numbers in
a bank account?"
"There are other ways of mea
suring success, like love and jus
tice," he said.
Danaher also said Knight is per
sonally worth more than $5.2 bil
lion, and Nike makes huge profits
at the expense of workers in coun
tries such as China and Indonesia
where labor union rights are se
verely restricted.
"Nike has been a pioneer in
seeking low-wage labor," he said.
Danaher disputed the defense

that Nike was nonetheless creating
jobs. "African Americans had full
employment under slavery," he
said.
Besides defending Nike's repu
tation, Knight fondly described the
growing pains his company experi
enced during the 19705.
"If those were difficult days,
they were also the most fun ones I
had," he said. Today, Nike moti
vates new workers by telling them
about the challenges that the com
pany had to overcome to succeed.
Knight called the mid-1980s a
major turning point for Nike.
"When we hit a bump we really had
to define who we were," he said. To
succeed, Nike needed more than
just a great product and great ath
letes wearing its stuff".
Nike dramatically intensified
its marketing efforts, expanded to
sports apparel and equipment,
and improved its customer service
and distribution channels, Knight
said.
Knight said building Nike "has
been a ride of great joy. ... It's
what I really wanted to do." He ex
horted students to "have a pas
sion. ... Have you ever met a 45-
year-old lawyer who didn't wish he
was doing something else?"
