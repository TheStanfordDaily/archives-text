# Nike founder speaks at Biz School
## Defends labor practices and encourages would-be entrepreneurs 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
Stanford graduate and Nike founder
and CEO Philip Knight defended his
company's much-maligned labor record
yesterday afternoon to a packed audi
ence at Bishop Auditorium.
While Knight was at the Graduate
School of Business in the 19605, he
wrote a business plan for the shoe com
pany he later started, earning an A on
the paper and in the class.
"One of the myths is that Nike
makes a huge margin on its products,"
Knight said. The margin is roughly the
same as that of Reebok and Converse,

who have not attracted the same bad
publicity as Nike, he said.
"We basically make our profit on vol
ume," Knight explained. It works out
on average that one out of two Ameri
cans buys a pair of Nike shoes every
year.
Contrary to media depictions of
Nike's factory in Vietnam as a sweat
shop, Knight said there are buildings
for prayer, a post office, a "huge park,
great athletic facilities," dormitories,
and other amenities.
While Knight acknowledged that
wages paid in the Southeast Asian cou n -
tries are low by Western standards, lie
said the amounts are higher than what

the workers made before.
Knight said he talieved people are
better off today in countries such as
Vietnam and Indonesia and wages will
continue to grow there.
Nevertheless, nongovernmental or
ganizations often attack Nike to get
publicity, Knight said. To prevent labor
abuses, Nike has contracted Krnst and
Young, a major public accounting firm,
to monitor its factories in these coun
tries.
It has also hired former lIS Am has
sador to the United Nations, Andrew
Youmr, to review implementation of
