## Labor victorious in Britain Poorest showing for Conservative Party since 1832 
### 
LONDON (AP) — The Labor Party surged
toward a landslide election victory yesterday night
that would restore it to power for the first time in a
generation and make 43-year-old Tony Blair the
youngest British prime minister in 185 years.
Moments after the polls closed, a BBC exit poll pro
jected that Labor would take 47 percent of the vote,
compared to just 29 percent for the Conservatives —
the poorest Conservative showing since 1832.
Independent Television News said its exit poll pro
jected a huge Labor victory, with 159 more seats in the
659-seat House of Commons than any other party.
That would mean a bigger Labor win than the one
that swept Winston Churchill out of office in 1945.
"It looks like we're going to win in very good fash
ion indeed," said Labor's deputy leader, .John
Prescott, savoring the first exit poll reports.
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo refused to con
cede defeat on the basis of the exit polls, although he
acknowledged that his party was hurt by internal
squabbling. "I think what the party needs to reflect
upon is that it has done itself no good by showing its
divisions," he said.
In power since Margaret Thatcher ousted the last
Labor government, in 1979, the Conservatives were
battered by divisions over Britain's future role in
Europe and a widespread sense they had simply been
around too long.
Hlair and his party fougl. i disciplined, slick six
week campaign from the political center after dump
ing a raft of socialist policies and adopting the Con

servatives' pro-business and low-tax policies.
"We've got to get these Tories out," said publish
er lan Walden, who voted in the comfortable market
town ol Saffron Walden, 35 miles from London.
Police searched Britain's 45,000 polling stations
following bomb hoaxes and small explosions by the
Irish Republican Army during the campaign. Armed
officers stood by as Blair voted near his home in
Trimdon, 235 miles northeast of London.
He smiled broadly, but sounded cautious: "It
depends on the people."
In Northern Ireland, which will have 18 seats in
the Commons, a series of bomb threats — believed to
come from pro-British paramilitaries — closed roads
and disrupted traffic in Belfast.
Across Britain, voters turned out steadily in bril
liant sunshine, and officials predicted a traditionally
heavy turnout. In 1992, the turnout was 78 percent.
Nearly 44 million people were eligible to vote, and
more than 3,700 candidates ran. A party needs 330
seats for a parliamentary majority to form the next
government.
With most official results due early today, Major,
54, could be out of his official Downing Street resi
dence by the end of day.
Blair would be the youngest prime minister since
the 42-year-old Lord Liverpool in 1812. He and his
wife, Cherie, a lawyer, have three children.
The new Parliament convenes Wednesday, and
t he government will lay out its program a week later
in a speech read by Queen Elizabeth 11.
