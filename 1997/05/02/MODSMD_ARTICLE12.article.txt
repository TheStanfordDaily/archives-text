Mobutu fails to show
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Without explanation, President Mobutu
Sese Seko failed to show up yesterday for a flight to talks with the rebel
leader who has seized half his country. Mediators and Zairian officials
insisted the meeting is still on, but it might be delayed.
It was not the first time Mobutu has hedged on attending talks,
which mediators hope will lead to his peaceful resignation. For the past
week, he has committed to meet Laurent Kabila and then reneged.
With talks set for today, Mobutu's no-show at the Kinshasa airport
left the status of negotiations unclear — as are many things in Zaire
these days.
Zairian Cabinet ministers and other officials waited for Mobutu at
the airport yesterday, ready to depart for the talks to be held on a
South African naval ship departing from Gabon. Sources close to
Mobutu said the situation was "confused" and that the meeting may be
postponed until tomorrow.
As diplomats scurried to keep the meeting on track, aid workers in
northeastern Zaire flew more than 1,500 Rwandan refugees home yes
terday and reports emerged that troops and tanks from Angola were
helping the rebels ir. their march toward Kinshasa, the capital.
South African officials insisted Mobutu would meet Kabila on today,

while a rebel spokesman said nothing would happen until Sunday.
"The end of the war will be on Sunday when Mobutu decides to
leave," spokesman Bizima Karaha told reporters in the southern,
rebel-held city of Lubumbashi.
Mobutu, 66, has insisted he would never bow to Kabila's demand to
resign, but he is ill with prostate cancer and under intense interna
tional pressure to step down.
The United States and other countries want a cease-fire in Zaire's
civil war, the establishment of a transitional government that includes
rebels and opposition parties, and a plan for free, fair elections.
Clinton, Congress near compromise
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton and congressional lead
ers worked into the night yesterday polishing final details of a pact to
balance the budget by 2002 while trimming taxes by about $ 135 billion.
With a conclusive handshake seemingly near, both the White House
and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill made plans for announcing a
deal today.
The GOP and White I louse negotiators were haggling over whether
the current bargainers or Republican-dominated congressional com
mittees later on would define the details of tax cuts, and what their 10-

year price tag would be. Also in play was whether Clinton would get all
of the extra $70 billion he wants over five years for education and other
domestic programs.
At one point late in the day, Clinton spoke by telephone to Senate
Republican leader Trent Lott — with 1 louse Speaker Newt Gingrich in
the room with Lott. House Republicans were to meet later.
Administration officials were all over Capitol I lill making the case
for a deal to Democrats, some of whom were making their displeasure
clear. Leading the effort were Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
White House chief of staff Erskine Howies.
Hut the deal was nearly done — so close that GOP leaders were
preparing the Capitol's Rotunda, a cavernous room beneath the Dome,
to be the site of an announcement. And one administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected a deal to be
announced before Clinton flies to Baltimore at noon today for a meet
ing with Senate Democrats.
Publicly, both sides were optimistic but guarded. While House
spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton was "encouraged" by progress
but cautioned that more work remained. I/)tt, R-Miss., said a deal could
occur shortly, but he added, "We're still working out the numbers."
The compromise, if completed, would mark a watershed in the deficit
wars the two parties have waginl since the beginning of the Reagan era.
