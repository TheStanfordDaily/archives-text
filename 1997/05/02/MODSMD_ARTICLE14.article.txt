Online syllabi should
make class shopping
a bit more palatable

PROBABLY ONE OF the last
things on the minds of stu
dents right now is their
schedules for fall quarter of next
year. With midterms and papers
due, few people have the time or
the desire to think about the
courses they'll be taking.
Yet the funny thing is that most
of us don't even know what we'll
be taking when the new quarter is
only a couple days away. Other
students don't decide until a week
or two into the quarter. Even
though the date to file study lists
allows for sufficient time to shuffle
around classes, the beginning of
the quarter "shopping" period is
essentially nonexistent — a prob
lem that can be remedied by sim
ply using our newest surrogate
teacher, the World Wide Web.
Take for example, professors
who assign reading for the first
day of class. They would argue,
perhaps, that Stanford's quarter
system demands this setup. After
all, we all know that Stanford
courses are designed to cram a
semester's material into just 10
weeks.
For a student trying to shop
around, however, this makes for a
very busy first week. Now that's
not to say that all students com
plete the work assigned right
away, but for many on campus,
these early assignments demand
extra time.
One possible solution is for pro
fessors to put their syllabi on the
Web prior to the first day of class.
Already, students often peruse
the Bookstore shelves for the
books ordered for classes they are
considering. With the addition of
the syllabi to the Web, those extra
studious students would have an
extra chance to skim the reading

assignments prior to the first day
of class.
Second, students would be able
gauge the degree of their interest
before the class begins. Consider
ing that there are hundreds of
courses from which to choose, and
considering that each student has
myriad academic interests, it is
often difficult to quickly narrow
down one's class selection. A quick
outline of each course — in the
form of a syllabus — would hope
fully allow students to clarify their
choices and make their shopping
period a more manageable one.
Another problem with the cur
rent system is that professors often
fail to print an adequate number of
syllabi for the first class. Almost all
of us have experienced the frustra
tion of walking into a tiny room
containing 15 syllabi — and more
than 50 potential students.
Posting syllabi on the Web
would also eliminate this problem
to some degree, but it is also the
responsibility of the professor to
ensure that she or he has enough
syllabi available for the first day.
For some classes, the second meet
ing is not for a week after the first
one. Students who have not
attended the first class and have
yet to retrieve a syllabus would be
oblivious to their assignments
while their workload piles up.
We are not asking professors to
cut down on the amount of work
that is assigned each quarter for
that would hurt everyone
involved. We are just requesting
that professors simply stop and
think about the other our side,
about how frustrating it is for us
to leave that first class session
with as much ambiguity as we had
when we entered.
The addition of syllabi would be
a time consuming effort on the
part of the professor; however, its
value would be immeasurable to
the average student "shopper."
It's early to be demanding syl
labi for next quarter's classes, but
we just wanted to give the profes
sors a little time.
