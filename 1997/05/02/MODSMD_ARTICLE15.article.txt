Civic dialogue key to eliminating societal bigotry

WE ARE WRITING as the Dean of
Students staff and as University
representatives to express our
concern about the hate incidents at Stan
ford directed at the lesbian, gay and bisex
ual members of our community and at
women. We also wish to express our con
cern about civility and safety for all mem
bers of the Stanford community. These
incidents and ones against other commu
nities in recent years remind us that prej
udice lurks beneath the surface and that
strengthening the bonds of community is
a vital responsibility that should not be
postponed in our daily lives.
First, we wish to acknowledge those
who are in pain and to communicate our
commitment to support healing. Second,
we are cognizant of the real and per
ceived danger of an escalation of hostili
ties between members of the Stanford
community and wish to diminish this
threat. Third, we are aware that many
in the lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity wish to have a full-time director for
their community center and welcome
their pursuit of this initiative through
appropriate University channels.
Each of us is responding to these inci
dents in a number of ways, but we do
not have all the answers. We ask for
everyone's help in finding ways in which
we can create civic dialogue that will
reduce the tensions that produce slurs
and vandalism.
Some on campus may feel that a few
incidents are not representative of the
community at large and that we should
not rouse a c< ..lmunitv after every inci
dent. Others may feel discussions are use
ful but may only exacerbate tensions. Yet
others may be reluctant to participate in

discussion for fear of unfair judgments
about their beliefs. However, we believe
that a learning community that cannot
respond with civic dialogue endangers
itself. We do not believe we should wait
until any further deterioration of civility
occurs before we respond.
We also wish to support The Daily
and University President Gerhard
Casper in their wish to see everyone in
this community taking the initiative to
strengthen the bonds of our community
rather than relying only on institutional
responses. We know ending bigotry is a
long-term project, but it is everyone's
responsibility to pursue it vigorously. As
a community we must work in partner
ship to overcome the challenges we face
in holding civic dialogue.
We, as a Dean of Students staff, wish
to promote civic dialogue as an important
first step in our goal to eliminate bigotry.
By civic dialogue we refer to discussion
between members of the Stanford com
munity that is respectful and tolerant of
differences of opinion and beliefs. We wish
to engage students in a partnership to
make the campus safer for everyone.
Therefore, we wish to propose a Cam
paign to Promote and Reaffirm Civic Dia
logue by offering to coordinate and facili
tate discussions about homophobia, sexu
al orientation and other challenging
issues. In the next few days we will devel
op a strategy for coordinating forums
where we can meet in small and large
groups, in residences and community cen
ters, to have open dialogue about the inci
dents that have plagued us this spring.
We are aware that such activities are
already taking place and that they are
challenging to construct. Nevertheless we

wish to try to make a difference. If you
are already holding discussions, please let
us know about the results of your discus
sions by contacting Tommy Woon,
the University's multicultural educator,
at tlw@leland.stanford.edu or by speaking
to any of the signers below so we can
learn from one another.
We will continue to take a proactive
approach to eliminating the societal big
otry that we cannot escape at Stanford
by working to strengthen the resources
and infrastructure to ensure a safe and
inclusive campus community. We will
also review and strengthen our protocol
so our responses will continue to be
effective and appropriate if and when
these events occur again. However, we
believe it is very important to ask every
one to focus their energies on restoring
institutional safety for the lesbian, gay
and bisexual community and the
women's community at this moment.
We invite the entire Stanford commu
nity to join us in these endeavors.
