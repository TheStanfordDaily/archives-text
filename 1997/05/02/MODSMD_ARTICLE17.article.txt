## It's not easy being lean 
### 
FIFTH GRADE WAS a chicken-pox
year, a broken-wrist year, an
androgenous bowl haircut year. It
was one of too many awkward, am-I-sup
posed-to-like-boys-yet? years. But, though
I didn't realize it at the time, fifth grade
was first and foremost my chubby year.
In fact, it took a sixth-grade diploma
before I could even recognize my pudgy
past for what it was. I had just joined the
swim team some four months before and
was running around on the deck, recon
ciling the am-I-supposed-to-like-boys
yet? aspect of my existence. "Jocelyn?"
one of the swim coaches called to me,
"you certainly have slimmed down a lot
from swimming. You look great."
It was an innocent comment, really,
from a strong, modern woman. But, in its
fifth-grade flawfulness, I had largely
taken my body as a given. That day, I was
reintroduced to it as an entity now sepa
rate from myself. An out-of-body experi
ence, maybe. My Enlightenment.
And so it began that, in seventh grade, I
learned to feel guilty about ice cream cones
and to feel proud of small frozen yogurts.
In eighth grade, I wrote myself notes not to
eat too much. I would write them in code,
to be sure, so that friends and parents
wouldn't worry. In ninth grade, I learned
to do sit ups and jog an extra mile even
afler three hours of swim practice.
Did I think somehow these endeavors
would make me prettier, which would
make me more popular, which would

make me happier? Not consciously.
Because in 10th grade, when I learned
that movie theater popcorn had 80 grams
of fat, I also learned that anorexia can
cause heart failure. And I listened as a
pretty friend who thought her hips were
too wide told me she was afraid to race
the 500-yard freestyle because the cold
might give her a heart attack. I saw with
wide eyes just how narrow a 26 inch
waist can be. But I couldn't figure out
how to open my mouth until she was on
life support at the hospital.
Did I think that purging one's way to
a washboard stomach brought physical
cleanliness or spiritual health? Not logi
cally.
Because in 11th grade, when I learned
that celery has negative calories, I also
learned that bulimia scars your fingers
and stains your teeth. And I offered
internal prayers when a normal-sized
friend disappeared to the bathroom for
five minutes at the end of every lunch
recess. And I blinked as gastric acid
burned the smile from her eyes. But I
couldn't come up with the joke that
would make the topic comfortable until
long after the scar tissue had sealed the
tears in her throat.
Did I think that weight loss was empow
ering, that it would bring with it assertive
ness and control? Not realistically.
Because in 12th grade, I learned that
thumb-twiddling burns 80 calories an
hour, and I felt the knot around my wrists

pull tighter. "You've lost a lot of weight
recently. You look great." And 1 almost
screamed as an innocent, forward-minded
girl told my best friend that so many
months with no food had paid off huge
dividends. But I crumpled up 100 con
cerned notes because I didn't want to pry.
I was too timid to force feed doses of love
to friends gagging on self-hate.
There is a girl in my house right now
who stops eating in honor of summer
vacation. It's too bad her ribs show when
she wears a bikini. There is a girl in my
class right now who eats one plain tortilla
for dinner. It's too bad she wears size two
since she stands 5'7". There are thou
sands of girls at this school alone who
have love-hate relationships with food.
We aren't all getting rushed off to the
hospital. We've formed subtler habits.
I spent days biting my lip and nights
crying in bed for words I couldn't bring
myself to say. My friends were too young
for gray hair but just the right age for
gray skin. Somewhere between Teen and
Newsweek, they started subscribing to
life without chubby years. It wasn't con
scious or logical or realistic, but some
where along the way, I started quietly
reading over their shoulders.

urban studies, doesn't think mirrors work.
