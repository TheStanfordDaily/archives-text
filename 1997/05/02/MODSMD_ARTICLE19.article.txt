## It's a big meet Cal invades Cobb Track 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
When Stanford plays California, whatever the
sport may be, there always seems to be a little
more adrenaline flowing among competitors.
Also associated with the rivalry is the friendly
trash talking that goes on between athletes
before and during the contest. Tomorrow's Big
Meet will demonstrate both as the Cardinal will
be hosting the Golden Bears for the first time on
Cobb Track and Angell Field this Saturday.
The Bears started early with a little bit of
"friendly" fire at a press conference Tuesday.
"I want to make sure that I'm not a member of
the class that lost to Stanford," said Cal senior
Clarence Phelps. Phelps currently has the sec
ond-highest pole vault jump in the Pacific 10
Conference.
The Cardinal men's team has come up short in
the annual dual meet the last 25 years. The mar
gin of victory has been decreasing steadily. Head
coach Vin Lananna is optimistic about the week
end.
"We've done a good job preparing our athletes
for Big Meet," Lananna said. "Our team is very
excited, very enthusiastic."
The women's team has a done slightly better
than the men's team but has a three-year losing
streak going into the weekend. Cal's Chantal
Reynolds shares Phelps' sentiment.
"I don't want to go out my last year like that,"
Reynolds said.
Regardless of the result tomorrow, the Cardi
nal has enjoyed a stellar season. Stanford has 25
men and 41 women who have met the qualifica
tions for the Pac-10 Championships. In addition,
the Cardinal boasts 14 men and 13 women who
have met NCAA provisional qualifying marks for
the upcoming NCAA Championships.
Furthermore the Card has five athletes who
have qualified for NCAAs. Freshmen Brad and
Brent Hauser have qualified in both the 5,000
and 10,000 meters. Junior Justin Strand has met
the mark in the hammer toss. Sophomore Tracye
Lawyer has qualified for the heptathlon.
Former Stanford coach and Hall of Famer
Payton Jordan had a lot to say about the meet
and track in general.
"This is going to be an exciting event," Jordan
said. "You can't just stay home and read about
this in the papers."
Part of the excitement will be due to the new
facilities. There will be an official dedication of
the field before the 4x400-meter relay honoring
former Stanford track athlete Chuck Cobb for his
