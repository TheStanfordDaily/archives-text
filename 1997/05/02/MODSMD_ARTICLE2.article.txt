The Department of Communi
cation awarded master's student
Vicky Anning the $10,000 Read
er's Digest Award for Academic
Excellence last Thursday.
Anning, who is from Britain,
was chosen for the prize from
among the seven master's stu
dents in the department. Stan
ford, along with 13 other schools
with graduate programs in jour
nalism, annually awards the prize
to the student with the best acad
emic record.
Anning said she wa3 surprised
when she received news of the

award at a Faculty Club lunch last
week. Surrounded by the entire
Communication Department, she
opened the envelope notifying her
of her achievement.
"It was amazing. They buried
the lead and didn't mention the
$10,000 until the end of the let
ter," Anning said.
According to Communication
Prof. James Risser, Anning "has a
very strong sense of what is news,
has a strong interest in social
issue reporting and has the ability
to write very clearly and analyti
cally."
Since entering the master's
program in journalism last fall,
Anning has written for The Daily
and The Palo Alto Weekly, focus
ing on issues such as homeless
ness. Her master's thesis is on
the media coverage of East Palo
Alto.
After graduating this June, An
ning will begin a four month in
ternship with Mother Jones, ?n
investigative journalism maga
zine based in San Francisco.
"It will be interesting for me
because Mother Jones takes a
strong interest in social issues,"
Anning said. "It's right up my
alley." Anning has had a few job

offers and is not certain about
what is in her future. But she does
know she would like to stay in the
Bay Area and continue investigat
ing social issues.
Anning came to Stanford with
limited journalism experience —
aside from her writing in college at
Bristol University in England.
Following college, she worked as a
book editor and has long been in
terested in words and writing.
"I was always looking at other
people's words and wanted to
write my own," Anning said.
While she worked for the Pots
dam Institute of Pharmacoepi
demiology in Germany, the com
pany was caught up in a public
health controversy involvingjour
nalism.
"I began to see the story be
hind the story and thought, 'I can

probably do this better,' " Anning
said.
With her knowledge of French
and German from her studies in
college, Anning worked for the
company as a conference organiz
er, translator and research coordi
nator. When her boss was relocat
ed to the Bay Area, Anning was of
fered the opportunity to join the
company here as well, but she ex
pressed her desire to study jour
nalism. Anning's boss suggested
she work for him part-time while
attending Stanford.
"The best decision I ever made
was coming to Stanford," Anning
said. "In a small program like this,
one of the benefits is personal at
tention. I hadn't written a lot be
fore, and the people here have re
ally helped me develop my writ
ing."

A committee of four faculty
members from the Communica
tion Department — Ted Glasser,
DaleMaharidge, Francois Bar and
Risser — reviewed the records and
determined the student display
ing the highest academic excel
lence.
"There aren't that many
awards of this type that provide a
monetary award," Risser said. "It
is encouraging to reward academ
ic excellence in journalism. I don't
think (journalism] is a hard field
to get into, but the beginning pay
is quite low and that discourages
people from going into the profes
sion."
The award relieved Anning's
anxiety about her financial situa
tion this summer because the
Mother Jones internship can pro
vide only a small stipend.
