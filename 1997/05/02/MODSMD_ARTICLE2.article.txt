The Department of Communi
cation awarded master's student
Vicky Anning the $10,000 Read
er's Digest Award for Academic
Excellence last Thursday.
Anning, who is from Britain,
was chosen for the prize from
among the seven master's stu
dents in the department. Stan
ford, along with 13 other schools
with graduate programs in jour
nalism, annually awards the prize
to the student with the best acad
emic record.
Anning said she wa3 surprised
when she received news of the

award at a Faculty Club lunch last
week. Surrounded by the entire
Communication Department, she
opened the envelope notifying her
of her achievement.
"It was amazing. They buried
the lead and didn't mention the
$10,000 until the end of the let
ter," Anning said.
According to Communication
Prof. James Risser, Anning "has a
very strong sense of what is news,
has a strong interest in social
issue reporting and has the ability
to write very clearly and analyti
cally."
