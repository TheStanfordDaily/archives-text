# Volleyball poised for first NCAA title
## Stanford spikes Ball State in three games 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - "Good
evening and welcome to St.
John Arena. The Ohio State
University is proud to host the
1997 NCAA Men's Volleyball
Championship."
With these words, Stanford's
first Final Four since 1992
began yesterday in Columbus,
Ohio. With threatening sub-40-
degree weather outside and the
wind howling, fans took refuge
inside the arena, anticipating
two great volleyball matches.
Stanford made quick work of
Ball State in a 15-6, 15-9, 15-10
victory, and No. 3 UCLA won a
seesaw battle against No. 2
Penn State in the later match,
winning 15-13, 13-15, 15-4, 10-
15, 15-10.

The St. John Arena, with its
wooden seats, ancient construc
tion and banner-laden rafters is
the college world's version of
Boston Garden and provided
the ideal backdrop for matches
of such importance.
While the facility is one of
the biggest that the Cardinal
has played in all year, Stanford
— the nation's top-ranked team
and the tournament's No. 1
seed — was not fazed. From the
end of the national anthem, the
Card took charge. Stanford
raced out to a 3-0 lead, but Ball
State, ranked sixth nationally
and seeded fourth in the tour
ney, took the lead at 4-3.
However, the Cardinal domi
nated the rest of the game.
Stanford outscored the Cardi
nals 11-2, winning 15-6 and tak
ing a 1-0 lead in the match on

senior middle blocker Mike
Hoefer's service ace.
Riding the momentum pro
duced by the win in game one,
the Cardinal jumped out to a
quick 9-4 lead in the second
game of the match. Although
Ball State rallied and got as
close as 13-9, the lead proved to
be too much for the Cardinals to
overcome, and they surrendered
for the second time when fresh
man outside hitter Andy Witt
hammered a kill to the arena
floor for a 15-9 win.
After going down 2-0, the
Ball State squad held a meeting
in one of the arena's walkways,
trying to regroup and looking to
head coach Don Shondell's 33
years of experience to find a
chink in the Stanford armor.


Kwqsi Loggott — Dally
Senior outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer spikes on
Ball State's front line in Stanford's Final Four win
over the Cardinals yesterday in Columbus, Ohio.
When the Cardinals emerged to
start game three, it appeared as
though they might have found
something, rallying from an early
7-4 deficit to take the lead for
just the third time in the match
at 10-8. The lead, however, was
short lived, as Stanford
regrouped to take the next seven
points and close out the Cardi
nals in an easy three-game match
when 6-f'oot-9 Hall State senior
middle blocker Phil Eatherton's
spike went wide.
"Ball State has a couple of
good hitters," said senior outside
hitter Mike Lambert. "Our goal
was to shut them down and shut
them down early. I think we exe
cuted that well."
In gaining its third trip to the
NCAA title game since 1989, the
Cardinal used a formula that has
become typical during the post
season. Once again, Stanford hit
below its season-average, hitting
.324 for the match. While the
Cardinal's hitting may not have
been at its best, Stanford was
dominant in every other aspect of
the match. The Card defense
held Ball State to .134 hitting for
the match, an outstanding effort.
Stanford's service game was

much stronger than Ball State's,
as Stanford recorded eight aces
and just 16 errors to only three
aces and 13 errors for Ball State.
Finally, Witt and senior outside
hitter Matt Fuerbringer, Stan
ford's primary passers, had
another great match, totaling
just two receive errors between
them.
Although this formula of out
standing serving and defense is
somewhat different from that
which' Stanford used during the
regular season, one cannot argue
with the results — four 3-0 victo
ries over four of the nation's top
10 teams.
"We think . . . what happened
out there was that their jump
serve . . . was so effective, we
were never able to get into our
offense," Shondell said. "We
were scrambling all night."
"It is definitely not something
that we have done by design, hit
ting lower," Nieves said. "The
key to our success this past
month has been our increased
point-scoring ability. We have
gotten better at blocking, serving
and passing. We have always
been a great team siding out, but
our point-scoring is a lot better."
Fuerbringer, only the second
man to be named a four-time All-
American, continued his out
standing postseason play. He was
second on the team with 15 kills

and led the squad in hitting at
.462. Additionally, he was perfect
serving, contributing onf ace
without any errors and in service
receive.
"Fuerbringer's increased level
of play is a case of a player rising

to the occasion," Nieves said. "He
is one of those players who can
dig down and turn their game up
another notch.
"He's been waiting his entire
career for this. I think we have
several of that type of players."

Stanford's service game was

much stronger than Ball State's,
as Stanford recorded eight aces
and just 16 errors to only three
aces and 13 errors for Ball State.
Finally, Witt and senior outside
hitter Matt Fuerbringer, Stan
ford's primary passers, had
another great match, totaling
just two receive errors between
them.
Although this formula of out
standing serving and defense is
somewhat different from that
which' Stanford used during the
regular season, one cannot argue
with the results — four 3-0 victo
ries over four of the nation's top
10 teams.
"We think . . . what happened
out there was that their jump
serve . . . was so effective, we
were never able to get into our
offense," Shondell said. "We
were scrambling all night."
"It is definitely not something
that we have done by design, hit
ting lower," Nieves said. "The
key to our success this past
month has been our increased
point-scoring ability. We have
gotten better at blocking, serving
and passing. We have always
been a great team siding out, but
our point-scoring is a lot better."
Fuerbringer, only the second
man to be named a four-time All-
American, continued his out
standing postseason play. He was
second on the team with 15 kills

and led the squad in hitting at
.462. Additionally, he was perfect
serving, contributing onf ace
without any errors and in service
receive.
"Fuerbringer's increased level
of play is a case of a player rising

to the occasion," Nieves said. "He
is one of those players who can
dig down and turn their game up
another notch.
"He's been waiting his entire
career for this. I think we have
several of that type of players."
