# Volleyball poised for first NCAA title
## Stanford spikes Ball State in three games 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - "Good
evening and welcome to St.
John Arena. The Ohio State
University is proud to host the
1997 NCAA Men's Volleyball
Championship."
With these words, Stanford's
first Final Four since 1992
began yesterday in Columbus,
Ohio. With threatening sub-40-
degree weather outside and the
wind howling, fans took refuge
inside the arena, anticipating
two great volleyball matches.
Stanford made quick work of
Ball State in a 15-6, 15-9, 15-10
victory, and No. 3 UCLA won a
seesaw battle against No. 2
Penn State in the later match,
winning 15-13, 13-15, 15-4, 10-
15, 15-10.

The St. John Arena, with its
wooden seats, ancient construc
tion and banner-laden rafters is
the college world's version of
Boston Garden and provided
the ideal backdrop for matches
of such importance.
While the facility is one of
the biggest that the Cardinal
has played in all year, Stanford
— the nation's top-ranked team
and the tournament's No. 1
seed — was not fazed. From the
end of the national anthem, the
Card took charge. Stanford
raced out to a 3-0 lead, but Ball
State, ranked sixth nationally
and seeded fourth in the tour
ney, took the lead at 4-3.
However, the Cardinal domi
nated the rest of the game.
Stanford outscored the Cardi
nals 11-2, winning 15-6 and tak
ing a 1-0 lead in the match on

senior middle blocker Mike
Hoefer's service ace.
Riding the momentum pro
duced by the win in game one,
the Cardinal jumped out to a
quick 9-4 lead in the second
game of the match. Although
Ball State rallied and got as
close as 13-9, the lead proved to
be too much for the Cardinals to
overcome, and they surrendered
for the second time when fresh
man outside hitter Andy Witt
hammered a kill to the arena
floor for a 15-9 win.
After going down 2-0, the
Ball State squad held a meeting
in one of the arena's walkways,
trying to regroup and looking to
head coach Don Shondell's 33
years of experience to find a
chink in the Stanford armor.
