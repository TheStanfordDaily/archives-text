# No.3 UCLA gets rematch tomorrow

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Let's get ready to rumble.
While these words of Michael Buffer, the world's
most famous ringside announcer, are normally
applied to boxing, they are no less appropriate for
tomorrow's men's volleyball NCAA Championship
match between Stanford and UCLA at 1 p.m. PDT
on KZSU. The two teams have split this year, with
UCLA capturing the first meeting 8-15,15-8,16-14,
15-13 in early March. Stanford won the second
match, played last weekend in the league champi
onship, 15-11, 15-2, 15-10. Tomorrow figures to be
quite a rubber match.
For Stanford, the question is whether or not it can
repeat the performance of last weekend. Will Stan
ford continue to play stifling defense and maintain
its impeccable service game? If the Cardinal is able to
do so, then UCLA should not prevent Stanford from
bringing home its first title.
However, while Stanford has been awesome late
ly, the Bruins are not looking to put in a solid effort
and go back to Los Angeles as good losers. Head
coach A 1 Scates is not used to losing. He is the leader
among active coaches with 16 Division I titles to his
credit.

"The UCLA confidence is still there, and A 1 Scates
is on the bench," said Penn State head coach Mark
Pavlik after his team's loss. "When A 1 is on the
bench, they just have an intangible. Overall, you look
at this team, and they are going to have strong mid
dle blockers, a big banger and a smart setter."
In UCliA's victory, all of these elements of the
Bruins' squad were evident. Freshman Adam Naeve,
a 6-foot-10 middle blocker, torched the Nittany
Lions, leading the Bruins in kills with 28 and hitting
.595 for the match.
In senior Paul Nihipali, the Bruins have a solid
outside hitter. He had 27 kills against Penn State.
Finally, the third element of the trio is freshman set
ter Brandon Talliaferro. Although Talliaferro spent a
fair deal of energy yapping at the Nittany Lion fans
and players throughout the match, he saved enough
of himself to add 84 assists to the Bruins' cause.
Unlike Penn State, Stanford has an abundance of
players with strongjump serves, something that has
given UCLA trouble all year. If Stanford serves well,
it is very likely that Talliaferro will get much poorer
passes and not be as successful in setting up the mid
dle blockers who have been so successful for the Bru
ins. In the three-game clinic that Stanford put on for
the Bruins in Pauley Pavilion last weekend, this was
the big difference, said Stanford head coach Ruben

Nieves.
"We serve very aggressively," Nieves said. "We
serve to put the other team in trouble. We have con
fidence in our Hideout game knowing that if we miss
a serve it is no big deal — we are going to go hack and
get the next sideout anyway."
While Stanford is concentrating on what it is
