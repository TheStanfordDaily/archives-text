# No.3 UCLA gets rematch tomorrow
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Let's get ready to rumble.
While these words of Michael Buffer, the world's
most famous ringside announcer, are normally
applied to boxing, they are no less appropriate for
tomorrow's men's volleyball NCAA Championship
match between Stanford and UCLA at 1 p.m. PDT
on KZSU. The two teams have split this year, with
UCLA capturing the first meeting 8-15,15-8,16-14,
15-13 in early March. Stanford won the second
match, played last weekend in the league champi
onship, 15-11, 15-2, 15-10. Tomorrow figures to be
quite a rubber match.
For Stanford, the question is whether or not it can
repeat the performance of last weekend. Will Stan
ford continue to play stifling defense and maintain
its impeccable service game? If the Cardinal is able to
do so, then UCLA should not prevent Stanford from
bringing home its first title.
However, while Stanford has been awesome late
ly, the Bruins are not looking to put in a solid effort
and go back to Los Angeles as good losers. Head
coach A 1 Scates is not used to losing. He is the leader
among active coaches with 16 Division I titles to his
credit.

"The UCLA confidence is still there, and A 1 Scates
is on the bench," said Penn State head coach Mark
Pavlik after his team's loss. "When A 1 is on the
bench, they just have an intangible. Overall, you look
at this team, and they are going to have strong mid
dle blockers, a big banger and a smart setter."
In UCliA's victory, all of these elements of the
Bruins' squad were evident. Freshman Adam Naeve,
a 6-foot-10 middle blocker, torched the Nittany
Lions, leading the Bruins in kills with 28 and hitting
.595 for the match.
In senior Paul Nihipali, the Bruins have a solid
outside hitter. He had 27 kills against Penn State.
Finally, the third element of the trio is freshman set
ter Brandon Talliaferro. Although Talliaferro spent a
fair deal of energy yapping at the Nittany Lion fans
and players throughout the match, he saved enough
of himself to add 84 assists to the Bruins' cause.
Unlike Penn State, Stanford has an abundance of
players with strongjump serves, something that has
given UCLA trouble all year. If Stanford serves well,
it is very likely that Talliaferro will get much poorer
passes and not be as successful in setting up the mid
dle blockers who have been so successful for the Bru
ins. In the three-game clinic that Stanford put on for
the Bruins in Pauley Pavilion last weekend, this was
the big difference, said Stanford head coach Ruben

Nieves.
"We serve very aggressively," Nieves said. "We
serve to put the other team in trouble. We have con
fidence in our Hideout game knowing that if we miss
a serve it is no big deal — we are going to go hack and
get the next sideout anyway."
While Stanford is concentrating on what it is
going to take to beat the Bruins,
UCLA has been doing its best to
outtalk its interconference rival.
Talliaferro, who has played against
Stanford freshman phenom and
outside hitter, Andy Witt, had this
to say about the rivalry:
"I have been rivals with him
ever since eighth grade, He was
always on the other team, and we
played a lot of matches against

each other. It's been a lot of fun
beating him."
Scates was not exactly forth
coming with praise for Stanford
either.
"The last time we played Stan
ford we were a little flat. We only
had two bad matches all year,
against Pepperdine and Stanford. I
can't explain it; we just did. I am
not worried. I haven't even started
thinking about Stanford yet. I'm
going to take my wife and mother
out to dinner and then start think
ing about Stanford. I have a folder
about a foot thick about them so

most of the work is already done."
Despite what Scates and Tallia
ferro have to say, it will likely take
a monumental effort from the
Bruins combined with an average
match from Stanford. Unlike past
years, in which teams may have
been taken out of their games by
the Bruins' mystique, Stanford
should not be fazed.
"We are familiar with UCLA,"
Nieves said. "We think that we are
the best team here so it is nice to
play a team that we know so we
don't have to worry about any sur
prises."
