Rooting for Cal?
When was the last time anyone
affiliated with Stanford was pulling
for Cal, ready to give an arm and a
leg for the Bears to rack up wins?
While the No. 3 Cardinal (34-13,
17-7 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division) baseball team battles
Arizona (32-23, 13-14) in its last
home series of the regular season,

host Cal (17-35, 3-24) will try to
restrain No. 4 UCLA (37-13-1, 15-
9) and avoid matching the Six-
Pac's all-time worst league record.
Entering this weekend's series
which begins tonight at 7 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond, Stanford has a
two-game lead over the Bruins in
the Six-Pac, and next weekend the
Card and Bruins will meet face-to
face at UCLA's Jackie Robinson
Stadium. The conference title will
most likely come down to a

thrilling fight in Westwood, and if
Stanford stays even with the Bru
ins this weekend it will need to win
just one of three in Los Angeles to
take home the Six-Pac crown.
But before the Card thinks
about battling the Bruins, it must
take on the Wildcats for three
games, including Fan Appreciation
Weekend with games tomorrow
and Sunday at 1 p.m.
"We are not looking past this
weekend yet," said sophomore co

captain Jody Gerut. "We are taking
it one game at a time."
Arizona will be no piece of cake.
This is the last series of the year for
the Cats, and they are fighting to
make it into postseason play. Victo
ries against Stanford would cer
tainly help Arizona's chances of
making the playoffs, and the Cats
are hot after taking two of three
last weekend on the road at No. 13
