Rooting for Cal?
When was the last time anyone
affiliated with Stanford was pulling
for Cal, ready to give an arm and a
leg for the Bears to rack up wins?
While the No. 3 Cardinal (34-13,
17-7 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division) baseball team battles
Arizona (32-23, 13-14) in its last
home series of the regular season,

host Cal (17-35, 3-24) will try to
restrain No. 4 UCLA (37-13-1, 15-
9) and avoid matching the Six-
Pac's all-time worst league record.
Entering this weekend's series
which begins tonight at 7 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond, Stanford has a
two-game lead over the Bruins in
the Six-Pac, and next weekend the
Card and Bruins will meet face-to
face at UCLA's Jackie Robinson
Stadium. The conference title will
most likely come down to a

thrilling fight in Westwood, and if
Stanford stays even with the Bru
ins this weekend it will need to win
just one of three in Los Angeles to
take home the Six-Pac crown.
But before the Card thinks
about battling the Bruins, it must
take on the Wildcats for three
games, including Fan Appreciation
Weekend with games tomorrow
and Sunday at 1 p.m.
"We are not looking past this
weekend yet," said sophomore co

captain Jody Gerut. "We are taking
it one game at a time."
Arizona will be no piece of cake.
This is the last series of the year for
the Cats, and they are fighting to
make it into postseason play. Victo
ries against Stanford would cer
tainly help Arizona's chances of
making the playoffs, and the Cats
are hot after taking two of three
last weekend on the road at No. 13
Arizona State, ending the Sun Dev
ils' eight-game Six-Pac win streak.
"They play well on the road,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"That they have a veteran team
helps them."
Prior to this season, the Wild
cats' big question mark was their
pitching, but the staff has proven
itself solid. A trio of sophomores,
right-hander Darrell Hussman (4-
7, 5.28) and lefties James Johnson
(4-6, 4.89) and Rob Shabansky (8-
5, 3.73), will start for Arizona.
Stanford will counter with
junior Kyle Peterson (8-2, 3.64)
and sophomores Brent Hoard (8-
3, 4.29) and Chad Hutchinson (4-
3, 6.24). With both Hoard and
Hutchinson pitching complete
games against Cal last weekend,
the bullpen is well rested. Lefty
sophomore closer Tony Cogan (7-
1) leads the Six-Pac with a 2.17
ERA. The entire staff has the

second-lowest league ERA at 4.32.
The Cardinal has continued its
balanced offensive attack with dif
ferent players stepping up at differ
ent times. Against Cal it was junior
catcher Jon Schaeffer who was on
fire, blasting four home runs in
three games. Schaeffer has a team
leading 14 home runs. On Tues
day, Gerut drilled a game-winning
home run in the bottom of the
ninth, giving the Card a 4-3 victory
over Cal Poly-San Luis Obsipo.
Gerut leads Stanford with 59 RBIs.
When the Card was struggling a
few weeks ago, its defense was
inconsistent. Stanford has gotten
back on pace, however, and boasts
the best fielding percentage in the
Six-Pac. The Cardinal has commit
ted 23 errors fewer than any other
team in the conference.
Although it is now crunch time,
the players are not nervous.
"We have been practicing and
working hard for this all year," said
senior co-captain Luke Quaccia.
"This is not time to think about it
and change anything. We will just
go about our business."
