# Ruggers hope to upend Cal
## Penn State is next for Cardinal in Berkeley 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Hoping to bring a pair of national
championships back to the Farm, both
the men's and women's rugby teams will
travel to the rugby Final Four tourna
ments that begin tomorrow.
The men will square off at Berkeley's
Witter Field this weekend, and their
first match could prove to be more emo
tional than usual for players from last
year.
The team faces Penn State at 11 a.m.
in a rematch of last year's national semi
final match. The Nittany Lions upset

the Cardinal last year 42-29.
"I know a lot of people see it as
revenge for last year, but it's not,"
Franck Boivert, the men's rugby coach,
said. "We are just very happy to be at the
Final Four. There is a very positive atti
tude towards the game, and we want to
enjoy ourselves a lot."
Stanford rival and six-time defending
national champion Cal will take on UC-
Davis in the other semifinal match at 1
p.m. Although it is not looking beyond
its first-round match, the Cardinal is
wary of both teams. The squad beat the

action.
Aggies 36-24 earlier this season,
but Davis has always been one
of the team's biggest rivals and
gave the Cardinal its only con
ference loss last year. Cal hand
ed the men its only loss to an
American team this year 42-29
last month.
However, the team is coming
off two big victories at the
regional semifinals in West
Point, N.Y., where, in two
games, it totaled 110 points,
winning by an average of 39.
"We had a good performance
at West Point with a lot of
points and a lot of big victo
ries," Boivert said. "Stylistical
ly they played excellent rugby."
The Cardinal men's strategy,

which had a profound impact
upon the competition in New
York, mirrors their female coun
terparts' in its fast-paced style.
"The Eastern teams were
very impressed by this type of
running rugby," Boivert said.
"It's very complex with lots of
passes. We disorganize the
defense with lots of passes and
excellent running."
Perhaps more important
than the tempo will be the Car
dinal's ability to win possessions
on lineouts. A terrific offensive
strategy will do no good if the
jumpers are not able to get the
ball to their teammates.
"The most important part of
the game will be the lineups,"
Boivert said. "Our jumpers are
going to have to perform
extremely well. If our lineup
people provide us the ball, we're
going to win those games."
