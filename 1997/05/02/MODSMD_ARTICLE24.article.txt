Returning to the tournament after sit
ting out last year, the women's rugby team
will travel to Penn State to play in Plate
Division of the Final Four.
The Cardinal will take on Marquette
tomorrow at 9 a.m. PDT, with Virginia Tech
and Florida State facing off at 11 a.m. PDT
in the other semifinal match. The two losers

will play in the consolation bracket Sunday
morning, and the two winners will compete
in the championship game Sunday after
noon.
The women, who have played an
extremely up-tempo, fast-paced game all
year, will continue to use that strategy to
counter the aggressive and head-on styles of
the Eastern teams.
