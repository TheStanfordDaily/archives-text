### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Returning to the tournament after sit
ting out last year, the women's rugby team
will travel to Penn State to play in Plate
Division of the Final Four.
The Cardinal will take on Marquette
tomorrow at 9 a.m. PDT, with Virginia Tech
and Florida State facing off at 11 a.m. PDT
in the other semifinal match. The two losers

will play in the consolation bracket Sunday
morning, and the two winners will compete
in the championship game Sunday after
noon.
The women, who have played an
extremely up-tempo, fast-paced game all
year, will continue to use that strategy to
counter the aggressive and head-on styles of
the Eastern teams.
"They are going to use the same
tactics" strategically, said head
coach Franck Boivert. "They'll be
going around the defense instead of
going head on. We will try to take
advantage of our superior tech
nique and skills."
Boivert, who also coaches the
women's national team, feels he
can help the Cardinal succeed
despite its inexperience facing
these types of squads.
"I know how rugby is played in
that part of the country," Boivert
said. "If we are able to implement
our game plan and physically exe
cute then we will come back to the
Farm with a trophy."
The team will also have to be
ready to adjust to the play of its

opponents in case the current
strategy does not execute efficient
ly enough.
"I think it's more about focus
ing on what the other teams are
doing," said senior Keiko Suda.
"We have to figure out what our
ideal type of play woidd be.
"We're going to watch videos
tonight of the other teams. Hope
fully that will help us visualize how
we want the games to go to work in
our favor."
But the mental level of its game
may prove the deciding factor for
the Cardinal. Functioning as a
cohesive unit and being aware of
the entire team on the field are nec
essary for success.
"They have been preparing
extremely well, they are super fit
and extremely ready physically,"
Boivert said. "But they are emo
tionally ready to go. This is a very
close, tight group."
