# Card takes on Huskies and Aztecs
## Softball readies for seniors' home finale 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Coming off a split Wednesday
against California, Stanford soft
ball hosts its final home games
against eighth-ranked Washing
ton tomorrow and San Diego
State on Sunday at 1 p.m. The
games have significance on sev
eral levels; a strong showing will
keep the possibility of postseason
play alive, anil it will be the last
games at home for seniors Aman
da Renteria, Summer Lee and
Katie Beattie.
Currently, Stanford's record
is 25-25-1 and (i-lfJ in the Pacific
10 Conference. This weekend the
team would like to see its record
go several games above .500 in
order to make postseason play
within reach. Considering the
difficult schedule and age of the
team, a winning record would be
a big accomplishment.
"Right now we're at .500,
which is not bad considering the
teams we've played," said head
coach John Rittinan. "Hut the
committee for determining who
makes the playoffs is not going to
let in any team with a .500 or
below record. Therefore the next
few games are very important."
Tomorrow's games against
Washington (40-10, 11-4 Pac-10)
will prove extremely difficult.
The team fell just short of
achieving a split against the
Huskies when Stanford traveled
to Seattle about two weeks ago.
Washington asserted itself as one
of the fastest teams that Stan
ford has played against, stealing
a total of 16 bases in the two

games. If Stanford wants to limit
the opportunities it allows Wash
ington, sophomore pitchers
Becky Blevins and Marcy Crouch
will have to pitch some of their
best games of the season. Limit
ing the number of hits and walks
allowed is crucial, because a run
ner on first usually means a run
ner in scoring position because of
Washington's speed.
Stanford's Sunday games
against San Diego State are defi
nitely not a given, as the Aztecs
(29-21) are a very capable team.
Both Stanford and San Diego
State have hovered around the
25th ranking all season long,
continuously receiving votes for
being two of the better teams in
the country. However, San Diego
State has enjoyed much more
success on the road (11-3) than
at home this year.
Stanford seems to have the
edge, though, as its pitching staff
has shown fortitude against the
best hitting teams in the coun
try. Stanford's hitting has also
improved, with both individuals
and the team becoming stronger
offensively.
Regardless of whether or not
the team wins the games and
makes regionals this year, the
games this weekend are impor
tant because they will be the
final homestand for the team's
seniors.
They have had a unique expe
rience compared to other Stan
ford athletes in that they have
watched and been part of a grow
ing program.
"Seeing the program develop
has been something very special
for me," Renteria said. "The
seniors and the team this year
really believed in the program
and what it wanted to accom
plish, and to see it actually begin

to happen means a lot."
The softball program has
taken on a completely different
appearance since the three
seniors first took the field for
Stanford. The addition of a new
head coach and the building of a
new softball stadium this year
signaled Stanford's intention to
build a first-rate softball pro
gram. The team's performance
has validated this with a solid

record and strong showings
against the nation's best teams
being among the squad's accom
plishments.
"In one respect, it's sort of sad
to see the program go to that
next level while realizing that
my involvement with the team is
almost over," Renteria said.
"I've enjoyed it and I really
wouldn't want it to end any
other way."
