# Card gets up for Big Row
## 
### 
Coming off a confidence-boost
ing rout of Sacramento State last
weekend, Stanford hopes to wrap
up its Pacific 10 Conference sea
son with a win against Cal in Big
Row.
Tomorrow's festivities get
underway at 9 a.m. in Redwood
Shores.
"Cal's pretty good competi
tion," said freshman coxswain
Dan Matross. "They're second in
the Pac-10 so we're trying to
catch up with them."

The Golden Bear men and
women are coming off a tight loss
at the Montlake Cut in Seattle to
the Pac-10's top squad, Washing
ton. While Stanford's men are
underdogs tomorrow, the
women's race is a tossup.
After 64 battles for the
Schwabacher Cup, Cal leads 46-18
and has lost just twice in 24 years.
The Stanford women trail 12-9
but have won the last two years.
"They get recruits so they're
always tough," Matross said.

"They have so much strength we
have to beat them on technique."
Stanford is putting a solid
dual-meet record in the Pac-10 on
the line. The Cardinal lost at
home two weeks ago to Oregon
State before rebounding to wallop
the Hornets in both varsity divi
sions.
Both Stanford and Cal will
turn their attention after Big Row
to the Pac-10 Championships in
Sacramento on May 18.
