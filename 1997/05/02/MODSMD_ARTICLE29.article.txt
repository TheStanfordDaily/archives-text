Those who know
Aimee are aware of
the fact that I'm orig
inally from Croatia,
but the government there
deported me when my bad
hygiene was deemed a public
health hazard. So yep, English
is my second language, and I
still have problems communi
cating and understanding
people, and I'm not talking
about New York cabbies and
math professors.
Hut the worst is when I'm
at a formal social function,
and 1 say something without
meaning to. Last week, for
instance, I was giving a speech
at a fund-raising charity din
ner at the Faculty Club, ner
vous as usual, when 1 ended

up thanking all the big "boners"
out there who kepi people like me happy and
satisfied. 1 meant, of course, "donors." I got
really embarrassed, and instead of finishing
my speech, I yelled "Fire!" and ran for the
door. I think I may have stepped on the body
of a University trustee on my way out.
Hut actually, mispronunciation is only the
tip of the iceberg. I made a fool of my little self
yesterday in section for my "Sexual Perver
sions in Greco-Roman Literature" class, when
I mentioned how Sophocles kept the ending of
his plays very "umbilical." The section leader
praised my Freudian take on Oedipus Rex, but
what 1 meant to say was "ambiguous."
And speaking of Sigmund, I am especially
prone to Freudian slips. Like the time 1 went
to my plastic surgeon and asked him for a
"blow job." He was about to get on his knees
when 1 corrected myself, "Nose job! Nose job!"
I turned crimson then. I think he was embar
rassed too, because instead of fixing my nose
he accidentally operated on my ear, adding an
extra lobe. Hut by then 1 was too embarrassed
to mention it and just left after writing my
check.
Another time I got in trouble was during

my French tutorial. 1 meant to ask my profes
sor, "When is the paper due?" but it came out,
"You luscious French women are nothing but
sluts and drive all red-blooded Americans
crazy with lust and horniness."
Finally, I must mention my limited vocab
ulary, which makes viewing hard when the
television is on. For a long time 1 thought The
Clapper had to do with the venereal disease,
and that the Home Shopping Network only
sold real estate.
I don't know what I can do to fix this
problem. Someone suggested having a throat
culture operation, so that even if 1 mispro
nounced something, it would come out in a
gorgeous New England accent, and who would
know the difference? Hut that's OK. Although
I do think my issues with language make me
the most incompetent Daily editor, closed to
the dynamics of an evolving language, com
pletely deaf to the nuances of a sentence,
applying all sorts of mixed metaphors and
impure alliterations.
Doesn't matter. As long as 1 can excom
municate with people 1 meet. Ill be just fine.


Sometimes Aimee likes to
relax by pretending she's a
political prisoner in a South
American island.


Other times she likes to
pretend she's the daugh
ter of a high-ranking pub
lic official.
