America has Mother's Day and
Father's Day, and now it even has
Children's Day — at least on the
Stanford campus.
This weekend, Stanford Univer
sity Nikkei — Stanford's Japanese-
American cultural group — will
bring a holiday traditionally cele
brated in Asia to the Farm.
For the first annual Children's
Day, children from the Bay Area
will enjoy an afternoon of Japanese
games, food and cultural perfor
mances. Children's Day is tradi

tionally celebrated on May 5
throughout a number of Asian
countries. Nikkei decided to host
the event Sunday — a day early
so more children and their parents
could participate, said co-chair
Daniel Lin, a sophomore.
"It's a novel idea in America,"
Lin said. "It's often overlooked that
children should be celebrated as
well."
The event will feature a variety
of booths for Japanese arts and
crafts — including origami, paint
ing, calligraphy and fish printing —
