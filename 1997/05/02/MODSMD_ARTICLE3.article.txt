# Stanford to celebrate first Children's Day
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
America has Mother's Day and
Father's Day, and now it even has
Children's Day — at least on the
Stanford campus.
This weekend, Stanford Univer
sity Nikkei — Stanford's Japanese-
American cultural group — will
bring a holiday traditionally cele
brated in Asia to the Farm.
For the first annual Children's
Day, children from the Bay Area
will enjoy an afternoon of Japanese
games, food and cultural perfor
mances. Children's Day is tradi

tionally celebrated on May 5
throughout a number of Asian
countries. Nikkei decided to host
the event Sunday — a day early
so more children and their parents
could participate, said co-chair
Daniel Lin, a sophomore.
"It's a novel idea in America,"
Lin said. "It's often overlooked that
children should be celebrated as
well."
The event will feature a variety
of booths for Japanese arts and
crafts — including origami, paint
ing, calligraphy and fish printing —
as well as food, traditional games
and performances. In addition,
Mixed Company a cappella and the
Stanford Band will perform.
"What we're aiming for is to be
able to share Japanese culture with
children as well as the Stanford
community," said sophomore Kari
Kokka, historian of Nikkei.
"The primary aim is to make chil
dren happy, and on a secondary level
it's important to make people... see

that this is a beautiful aspect of
Asian culture," Lin said.
Sophomore A.J. Oxley, Nikkei
treasurer, called the event a
"mishmash" of various cultures.
"It really makes it unique because
you'll find influences of both pure
Japanese and pure American cul
ture in the events we're doing," he
said.
"We really want [children] to
have exposure to one of the customs
that Japanese and Japanese-Amer
ican people celebrate," Oxley said.
"I lopefully they'll have fun but also
.. . take away a piece of Japanese
culture with them."

Lin said the event is intended to
"unite a lot of different groups and
try to get people of different inter
ests together because celebrating
children is the underlying theme."
Freshman Leah Peachey, a vol
unteer for the event, said she hopes
the event will "be successful
enough to allow more children's
programs to come to campus.
"I think it's a good way to expose
children to different cultures," she
said.
However, the event is not only
aimed toward teaching children
about culture. According to
Peachey, it's also about learning

from them.
"Any time you work with chil
dren, you learn. They have a lot to
teach us," she said.
Students from various elemen
tary schools in the area and organi
zations such as the YMCA and the
Girl Scouts were invited to attend.
The Dean of Students Office, the
Asian American Students Associa
tion and the Community Service
Hoard helped Nikkei fund the
event.
The event, which is free of
charge to all participants, will be
held Sunday afternoon from 1 to 5
p.m. in White Plaza.
