### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
After 10 hours of competi
tion, the Stanford Bridge team
upset York University in the
semifinals of the National Col
legiate Bridge Championship
before losing to a more experi
enced Harvard University
team.
The team, captained by se
nior Danny Zeibert, also includ
ed freshman Lewis Steckler, ju
nior Kathy Donaghy and senior
Emil Aalto.
"We were confident at the
beginning that our team could
go pretty far," said Donaghy.
In fact, Stanford can also
claim a little share of the first
place glory: Stanford doctoral
student Joel Singer, a member
of the U.S. junior team, played
for Harvard.
"I was originally not going to
play," said Singer, but he re
ceived an invitation from a
friend at Simmons College in
Boston to play for Harvard.
"It's great to see undergradu
ates get involved."
The tournament, which fin
ished on Saturday, was Inter
net-based; Stanford's team con
nected into the tournament
program from the Sweet Hall
cluster.
"It's nice to get a whole
bunch of people together from
all over the country, without
having to go anywhere. ... In
the future, I expect to see a lot
more tournaments online,"
Steckler said.
Singer noted that in previous
years, participants were flown
to tournament headquarters in
Memphis, Tenn.
"They decided to save money
and hold it over the computer
network," he said.
Singer was actually in Sweet

Hall with the Stanford team
during the finals. "We were on
different terminals," said
Singer. "I didn't want to look at
their cards."
Stanford players surprised
themselves with their victory
over York University in Toron
to. According to Steckler, the
York team was seen as the most
likely winner of the tourna
ment.
"We just played solid," said
Steckler. "We didn't have any
superstars on the team."
Donaghy said the team was
excited to beat York in the semi
finals. Zeibert agreed. "After
seeing how well we did in the
first round, we knew we were in
for the long haul," Zeibert said.
At times, the tournament
moved extremely slowly for the
players.
"There was a lot of en
durance involved because you
couldn't make a mistake,"
Steckler commented, referring
to the nature of the tourna
ment. "It was originally sched
uled for three hours."
"It was intense," he added,
"but it was a very friendly com
petition." The tournament
"wasn't cutthroat at all,"
agreed Singer.
"We were a little quiet, a lit
tle intense, but we were having
fun, too." Donaghy found it to
be "a challenging experience. I
was a little bit nervous at first,
but you can't be nervous for 10
hours. The nervousness ended
when the playing got started."
Stanford won the tourna
ment in 1995 and placed third
in 1996, when Aalto and Singer
both played on the Stanford
team. All members of this year's
team are members of the Stan
ford Bridge Club. However,
Donaghy said, tbclub accepts
players at all levi is.
