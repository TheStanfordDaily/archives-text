# Judicial charter passes
## Fac Sen agrees unanimously on changes 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The new student judicial char
ter gained its final endorsement
yesterday after a unanimous vote
from the Faculty Senate and sub
sequent endorsement from Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Casper said he expected to give
his official approval "promptly" as
soon as he was able to determine a
date when the charter would go
into effect. He said the date would
be early in the next school year but
not necessarily September 1.
Before the senate unanimously
approved the document, it exten
sively discussed what faculty
members' responsibilities current
ly are and what they will be under
the new charter.
Specifically, discussion hinged
around two related questions.
The first addressed the standards
by which faculty should deter
mine whether a suspicion of a pos
sible honor code violation should
be reported to a judicial officer.
The second dealt with defining
the point at which faculty are
obliged to report an incident, as
opposed to dealing with the prob
lem privately.
Both Geophysics Prof. Mark
Zoback, who chaired the Commit
tee of 15 that wrote the charter,
and Jennifer Perkins, the judicial
affairs officer, counseled faculty to
bring forward all cases with sub
stantial evidence. This was to en
courage them not to "take unilat
eral action . . . as judge, jury and
executioner," Zoback said.
Arthur Veinott, professor of en
gineering economic systems and
operations research, suggested it
is "wisest to leave some judgment
in the hands of faculty," because
students may be more willing to
confess if there was no threat of a
formal process.
This point led to renewed dis
cussion of determining when fac
ulty had an obligation to report ev
idence such as a confession.
The Honor Code, as Chemistry
Prof. John Brauman pointed out,
obliges all community members to
act on any knowledge they have of
a violation.
Although the charter has no
provision for faculty obligations,
Casper suggested that cases of fac-

ulty not report
ing a known vio
lation might
come under fac
ulty disciplinary
procedures, al
though he said he
did not know of
such a thing ever
happening.
Franklin Orr,

dean of earth sciences, suggested
that a professor who confronts a
student about a possible violation
should make it clear in advance
what his possible obligations

might he.
Zoback and Perkins suggested
greater education for faculty on all
points of the judicial process, in
cluding their obligation to report
violations, the clarification of the
degree of collaboration permissi
ble on assignments and other is
sues.
Orr ' 1 .)rated on this idea by
suggesting that a "pamphlet-sized
document he put together and
distributed to faculty and teaching
assistants. It would consist of sev
eral examples of situations and ap
propriate courses of action.
