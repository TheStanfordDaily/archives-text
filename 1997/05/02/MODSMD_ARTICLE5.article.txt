# Fac Sen discusses new CIV
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Faculty Senate
discussion to revamp the cur
rent Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program had a tone that was
less confrontational than what
has been the norm since the con
troversial reforms were first
proposed.
The senate took no action on
the measure but did hear from
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Anne
Fernald, the chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, about some revisions her
committee had made to tin; orig
inal document that emerged
from English Prof. Rob Polhe
mus' CIV Review Committee.
The main revisions proposed
to remove the limit on the num
ber of large lecture courses that
make up the first quarter of the
new "one-plus-two" format.
They also aimed to change (lie
review committee's language re
quiring the diversity of works
studied and wanted to encour
age current CIV professors to
continue teaching in their re
spective tracks. However, these
professors would have to make
the necessary changes for the
new program structure.
The idea that current CIV
tracks might be able to continue
in a modified form attracted a
112 avorable response both fVom in
side and outside the senate.

Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education Ramon Saldivar
said he had heard from faculty
in several tracks — including
Europe and the Americas, Liter
ature and the Arts and Great
Works — "about the way the
change to this new format can
help them do what they do."
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall,
who lectures in the Humanities
CIV track and spoke out against
the reform the last time the sen
ate discussed it, was absent from
the meeting. I lowover, he said
in a letter that the change
"seems to have opened up the
necessary flexibility," and he
looked forward to having u rolo
in the new program.
Another senator who spoke
against the reform at the last
meeting was Philosophy Prof.
John Perry. At yesterday's
meeting, he expressed continu
ing reservations about changing
the name of the program hut
said "it can be the basis of an im
proved requirement" in its re
vised form.
The issue of how the new pro
gram should ensure that stu
dents studied a variety of cul
tures was also discussed. Except
for some language changes, Fer
nald said, her committee agreed
with the CIV Review Commit
tee's decision to stop mandating
tracks to extensively discuss is
sues of race, gender and class.
However, a requirement of one
work per quarter explicitly ad
dressing such issues would be
maintained.
Fernald said the curriculum
outside of CIV had changed in the
years since 1988, when the re
quirements for race, gender and
class discussions were included.
She pointed out that redesigned
distribution requirements and the
Program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity had in

creased students' exposure to
these issues.
She added that the mandate
had contributed to generating
common student complaints of
"tokenism" and "snippetization"
and claims that the non-Western
sources used were often incom
plete or incoherent.
Helen Brooks, a senior lecturer
in English who has taught in both
CIV and its predecessor, Western
Culture, interpreted the com
plaints of tokenism differently.
"I think the students want to
examine these issues in greater
depth," Brooks said, noting that it
was hard to make the requirement
more inclusive while reducing the

number of texts students have to
read.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy supported removing
the mandates because, he said, it
was an attempt to avoid both of the
problems he associated with CIV
and Western Culture.
He said Western Culture had
been too restrictive of whose voices
were studied, while the CIV man
dates had too many prescriptions
on issues which should be dis
cussed.
Specifically, Abernethy said,
the emphasis on race, gender and
class had meant playing down
other factors, such as religion and
nationality. Similarly, he said,

stressing cultural diversity pulled
attention away from the common
human experience of all cultures.
The senate was considering the
proposal under special rules that
barred any vote yesterday, but the
issue is on the agenda for the next
meeting on May 15 and will be
voted on either then or at the next
regular meeting two weeks later.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven also an
nounced at the meeting that he
was nominating Assoc. Drama
Prof. Harry Elam to chair the Area
One Program, which oversees the
CIV requirement.
Elam would replace Paul
Seaver.
