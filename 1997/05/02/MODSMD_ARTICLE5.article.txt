Yesterday's Faculty Senate
discussion to revamp the cur
rent Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program had a tone that was
less confrontational than what
has been the norm since the con
troversial reforms were first
proposed.
The senate took no action on
the measure but did hear from
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Anne
Fernald, the chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, about some revisions her
committee had made to tin; orig
inal document that emerged
from English Prof. Rob Polhe
mus' CIV Review Committee.
The main revisions proposed
to remove the limit on the num

make up the first quarter of the
new "one-plus-two" format.

review committee's language re
quiring the diversity of works
studied and wanted to encour

meeting, he expressed continu
