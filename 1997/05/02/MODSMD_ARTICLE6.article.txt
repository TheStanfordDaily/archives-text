### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Forty-eight residents from the Department
of .Surgery presented a letter to high-ranking ad
ministrators on April 21 outlining their con
cerns about the lack of a permanent department
chair as well as a more general lack of financial
support.
The surgical department generates a signifi
cant amount of revenue for the hospital, accord
ing to surgical resident George Yang. "We actu

ally pay for our own expenses and our salaries
with a little extra" left over, he said. Yang said
that all departments are important hut that the
surgical department is pulling more than its
weight financially â€” without adequate compen
sation.
Christopher Zarins, the department's acting
chairman since July 1995, disputed Yang's and
other residents' claims.
"Each department is responsible for its finan
cial integrity," Zarins said.
However, Zarins agreed with the surgical

residents' complaints that the department is
understaffed. He stated the need for more sur
geons and a chief director of general surgery.
"Surgery is a growing department," Zarins
said. "I think we have new recruitment
needs."
The residents said having the department un
derstaffed while holding it responsible for a sig
nificant portion of the hospital's income could
lead to the "robbing Peter to pay Paul" phenom-
