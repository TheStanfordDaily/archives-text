# State of Surgery Dept. upsets residents
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Forty-eight residents from the Department
of .Surgery presented a letter to high-ranking ad
ministrators on April 21 outlining their con
cerns about the lack of a permanent department
chair as well as a more general lack of financial
support.
The surgical department generates a signifi
cant amount of revenue for the hospital, accord
ing to surgical resident George Yang. "We actu

ally pay for our own expenses and our salaries
with a little extra" left over, he said. Yang said
that all departments are important hut that the
surgical department is pulling more than its
weight financially — without adequate compen
sation.
Christopher Zarins, the department's acting
chairman since July 1995, disputed Yang's and
other residents' claims.
"Each department is responsible for its finan
cial integrity," Zarins said.
However, Zarins agreed with the surgical

residents' complaints that the department is
understaffed. He stated the need for more sur
geons and a chief director of general surgery.
"Surgery is a growing department," Zarins
said. "I think we have new recruitment
needs."
The residents said having the department un
derstaffed while holding it responsible for a sig
nificant portion of the hospital's income could
lead to the "robbing Peter to pay Paul" phenom-
enon.
"We feel like we're losing more
than what is required," Yang said.
"Our feeling Ls that, in the long
term, it will be a detriment to the
Medical School."
Residents also expressed con
cern about the pending merger of
Stanford Health Services with
UC-San Francisco Medical Cen
ter. While the schools' hospitals
are merging, the medical schools
are not. Because the two are so in
terrelated, Yang said, "It's hard to
say where the lines will be drawn.
"The Medical School demands
scholarship from our faculty," he

said. "The hospitals demand clini
cal activity. Realistically, it's very
difficult for them to please both
sides."
The residents fear that their
concerns have not been represent
ed in high-level decision making.
"We feel the Department of
Surgery does not have a voice in
what the future . .. will he," Yang
said. The other residents joined
Yang in suggesting that the de
partment find a permanent chair,
someone who could "look out for
us and our department."
"We do have a need for a per
manent chair of surgery," Zarins
said. "I'm pleased the dean of
medicine has instituted a search
for such a candidate."
Dean of the Medical School Eu
gene Bauer proposed Wednesday

that a search committee be
formed for a permanent chair.
The decision about faculty serving
on the committee has not yet been
confirmed. Zarins hopes the de
partment will consider him for the
position.
"We fully support Dr. Zarins in
what he's trying to do," Yang said.
"We would like to see leadership
continue without any disruption."
Administrators in the Medical
School are beginning to take ac
tion in other ways as well.
"The school is going to make
every attempt to be responsive to
their concerns," said Bauer, who
commended the residents on the
thoughtfulness of their letter.
"We will be carrying out a review
of the department," he said. "We
will invite external consultants

from outside institutions, as we
often do with (reviews of) other de
partments."
Yang attended Tuesday's "Tea
and Cookies with Gerhard Casper"
to approach University President
Gerhard Casper about the resi
dents' concerns.
"He specifically didn't address
our concerns as a department, but
he hadn't read the letter yet," Yang
said.
He added that several residents
have made an appointment to
speak with Casper about these is
sues.
In addition to Casper, residents
sent the letter to Provost Con
doleezza Rice, CEO of UC-Stanford
Health Care Peter Van Etten and
members of the Board of Trustees,
among others.
