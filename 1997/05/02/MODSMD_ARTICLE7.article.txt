# Speaking in tongues

You're traveling to Mongolia to study the agricul
tural methods used by Mongolian farmers. Suddenly,
out on the steppe you realize you don't know the first
thing about speaking Khalkha.
Perhaps the Special Languages Program could
give you direction. The program has been providing
language and cultural instruction for Stanford stu
dents since 1972. In the last 10 years, more than 80
languages have been offered. The "special" in the pro
gram's title refers to the fact that these are languages
that are not as customarily taught at colleges as lan
guages such as French, Spanish and Italian.
The reasons students seek these courses are as var
ied as the languages themselves.
Doctoral student Kathryn Barrett-Gaines has
been taking Luganda, a language spoken in central
Africa, for the past two quarters. Barrett-Gaines is
getting her doctorate in African history and is doing
her dissertation on the social history of Kampala, the
capital of Uganda. In order to complete her research
she is learning Luganda to interview some of the city's
inhabitants.
" The Special language Program has been amaz
ing," Harrett-Gainessaid. "I looked around and found

a man from Kampala, and Stanford hircni him. I am
the only one in the class. I feel almost spoiled."
Kdward Trail, a master's student, focused on the
cultural aspects of language. He is Vietnamese and
Russian-Jewish and has been taking Vietnamese for
four years.
"Learning Vietnamese has been a very good expe
rience for me because it, taught me a lot about myself
and my family's background," Tran said.
I .earning the language motivated him to visit Viet
nam on two occasions. During his second visit, Tran
participated in a developmental program focused on
helping the country through its transition from a
tate-led communistic modelofgovernmenttoa more
open system.
"I feel that the school is more Western-focused so
it's great that the Special Languages Program offers
languages focused on Asia," Tran said. "The program
adds a lot of breadth to the University, and it's a valu
able and necessary part of education."
. Sophomore Hemanth Parasuram echoed Trail's
sentiments.
"This is an opportunity I don't see myself getting
ever again," said Parasuram, who has been taking


Jacqui Frank Daily
Tamil, a language spoken in south
ern India, for one year.
Because Tamil is Parasuram's
mother tongue, he wanted to im
prove his speaking, reading and
writing skills. Stanford did not offer
a chiss in Tamil so Parasuram de
cided to join with others to find a
teacher. He has also been studying
ancient Tamil literature as an inde
pendent project and is finding that
his language classes are helpful in
his studies.
"The Special Languages Pro
gram shows that there is aesthetic
exploratory learning at Stanford
and that Stanford is open to differ
ent activities that students are in
terested in," said Parasuram
The instructors of the program
classes can be visiting professors,
fellows or any qualified individual
who not only speaks the requested

language but also is able to teach it
to students in an effective manner.
In most cases, the lecturers are
from the area where the language
originates.
Senior lecturer Khalil Barhoum
teaches his native language, Arabic,
to students interested in learning
the language for a variety of rea
sons. According to Barhoum, stu
dents come to him with a desire to
learn Arabic because of religion,
culture or curiosity. He added the
number of students taking his
classes has risen.
Lecturer John Mugane grew up
speaking Swahili, a language of
East Africa, and has been teaching
the language for four years.
"I wish to foster understanding
about African people, their history,
cultures, aspirations, our surpris
ing and repeated victories and our
contribution to humanity," Mu
gane said.
Ravi Dhillon, teaches a language
that comes from northern India
called Punjabi. Originally from

India, Dhillon been teaching at
Stanford since 1986.
"The first generation was too
busy getting settled to teach their
children the language, therefore
the language was neglected,"
Dhillon said. She is hopeful that her
classes will culturally as well as lin
guistically educate students whose
have an interest in the Punjabi lan
guage.
In addition to language instruc
tion, Dhillon and her students cele
brate cultural holidays and festivals
together such as Lohri, the winter
festival, which she, her class and
more than 300 people celebrated at
Lake Lagunita in January.
Program Director Eva Prionas
has been teaching Modern Greek
since she was a graduate student.
She frequently receives requests
from students wanting to learn
unique languages â€” at times, it is
diificult to find an instructor. In
most cases, a minimum of five stu
dents must show an interest in a
language before an instructor is

sought, but there have been excep
tions, Prionas said.
"We are here to serve the stu
dents for academic purposes, so
that they have a unique experience
at Stanford," Prionas said. "I hope
that this experience will lead to a
global education instead of a limit
ed education that provides only a
narrow version of what the world
has to offer."
Until September 1996, the pro
gram was a part of the Department
of Linguistics, but it is now associ
ated with the Stanford Language
Center.
Other special language classes
offered this spring quarter are:
Shona, Turkish, Hebrew,
Haitian / Creole, Hindi, Indone
sian, Quechua, Thai and American
Sign Language.
In addition to academic in
struction, the program also offers
aid to hospitals in need of transla
tors who serve to bridge the lan
guage gap between patients and
doctors.
