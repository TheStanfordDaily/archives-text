# Speaking in tongues

You're traveling to Mongolia to study the agricul
tural methods used by Mongolian farmers. Suddenly,
out on the steppe you realize you don't know the first
thing about speaking Khalkha.
Perhaps the Special Languages Program could
give you direction. The program has been providing
language and cultural instruction for Stanford stu
dents since 1972. In the last 10 years, more than 80
languages have been offered. The "special" in the pro
gram's title refers to the fact that these are languages
that are not as customarily taught at colleges as lan
guages such as French, Spanish and Italian.
The reasons students seek these courses are as var
ied as the languages themselves.
Doctoral student Kathryn Barrett-Gaines has
been taking Luganda, a language spoken in central
Africa, for the past two quarters. Barrett-Gaines is
getting her doctorate in African history and is doing
her dissertation on the social history of Kampala, the
capital of Uganda. In order to complete her research
she is learning Luganda to interview some of the city's
inhabitants.
" The Special language Program has been amaz
ing," Harrett-Gainessaid. "I looked around and found

a man from Kampala, and Stanford hircni him. I am
the only one in the class. I feel almost spoiled."
Kdward Trail, a master's student, focused on the
cultural aspects of language. He is Vietnamese and
Russian-Jewish and has been taking Vietnamese for
four years.
"Learning Vietnamese has been a very good expe
rience for me because it, taught me a lot about myself
and my family's background," Tran said.
I .earning the language motivated him to visit Viet
nam on two occasions. During his second visit, Tran
participated in a developmental program focused on
helping the country through its transition from a
tate-led communistic modelofgovernmenttoa more
open system.
"I feel that the school is more Western-focused so
it's great that the Special Languages Program offers
languages focused on Asia," Tran said. "The program
adds a lot of breadth to the University, and it's a valu
able and necessary part of education."
. Sophomore Hemanth Parasuram echoed Trail's
sentiments.
"This is an opportunity I don't see myself getting
ever again," said Parasuram, who has been taking
