# Volleyball brings home NCAA title
## Dramatic victory over UCLA earns Card its first championship 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Stanford men's
volleyball team, which had staked its claim to
the national title all year, saw its dream
achieved Saturday at Ohio.
Beneath the dusty rafters and faded ban
ners of St. John Arena, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (27-3) defeated fellow Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation member UCLA (24-5),
earning the school's first-ever championship

in the sport and fourth of the academic year.
Appropriately, the historic 15-7, 15-10, 9-15,
6-15, 15-13 victory came at the expense of the
second-ranked Bruins, the most celebrated
men's collegiate volleyball program in the
land. Coming into the match, UCLA had won
16 NCAA titles and had amassed a record of
45-5 against Stanford.
In the first two games of the match, Stan
ford played as though it were playing against
perennial MPSF doormat UC-San Diego, not
the Bruins.

Fast Start
The Cardinal showed absolutely no jitters,
nor seemed the least hit awed by UCLA's lega
cy, quicklyjumpingout in the first game to a 3-
1 lead behind the serving of senior outside hit
ter Mike Lambert and the attacking power of
freshman outside hitter Andy Witt, forcing
UCIxA coach A 1 Scales to call a timeout. Al
though the Bruins regrouped and tied the
score at 4-4 with freshman setter Brandon

leyball championship.
Taliaferro's kill, Stanford held the
lead from then on.
A string of UCLA errors made
the score 9-4, leading to another
UCLA timeout. After the timeout,
sophomore setter Tyler Neal, serv
ing for senior middle blocker Mike
Hoefer, put together a string of
four straight points, punctuated
by a kill from Witt to run the score
to 13-5. A brief UCLA rally was
cut short by Lambert's service ace
to make it 14-7, and the Cardinal
captured the game 15-7 on a block
by junior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst and Witt.
In the second game, the Bruins
came out fired up and jumped on
Stanford early, storming to a 4-1
lead because of numerous Cardi
nal attack and service errors.
Stanford closed the gap to 5-4 on a
kill by tournament MVP Lambert,
inducing a UCLA timeout. The
Bruins ran off a string of three
points, all because of Stanford
errors, to extend their lead to 8-4.
Stanford began to close the gap,
using improved serving and
attacking.
Although the Bruins led as late
as 10-8 in the game, they stalled
there, allowing the Card to get the
next seven points of the match.
Stanford's run was punctuated by
four straight points on senior out
side hitter Matt Fuerbringer's

serve. Four consecutive UCLA hit
ting errors allowed this string of
points and handed the Cardinal a
15-10 victory in the game and a 2-
0 lead in the match.
Bruin Comeback
Just when it appeared that the
Bruins were Finished, badly beat
en in both of the first two games
by Stanford, they mounted a huge
comeback.
UCLA's resurgence began
slowly. After jumping out to a 5-2
lead on a Lambert error, the Bru
ins allowed Stanford to take the
lead 7-5 on a Lambert ace.
However, from that point on,
the Bruins owned the game. The
Bruins used a familiar duo of
Stanford attacking and serving
errors to build a 14-8 lead before
capturing the game 15-9 when
sophomores Danny Farmer and
Fred Robins, a middle blocker and
an outside hitter, respectively,
teamed up to block Witt.
Although Stanford lost game
three, the outlook for Cardinal
fans was still rosy. Led by sopho
more Sarah Neal and junior Deb
bie Lambert, themselves accus
tomed to capturing champi
onships in women's volleyball and
sisters of Tyler and Mike, the
Stanford cheering section did all it
could to exhort the Cardinal on to
victory.
However, after trading sideouts
and coming to a tie at 2-2, the
Stanford side began to crumble.
Timeouts at 4-2 and at 8-3 were

not able to stop the Bruin
onslaught. Numerous Cardinal
errors led to Bruin points, and
even when Stanford succeeded in
getting a kill, it was never without
a Bruin touching it on its way to
the floor.
Although the Cardinal attempt
ed another late rally, it was only
able to close to 9-6 before UCLA
ran off five straight points behind
the serve of junior outside hitter
Ben Moselle to build a 14-6 lead.
UCLA eventually captured the
game 15-6, to even the match.
During this string of UCLA
points, Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves made critical moves,
replacing Lambert and Hoefer
with juniors Devin Poolman, an
outside hitter, and Tad Hoffman,
a middle blocker. Recognizing that
both Lambert and Hoefer
appeared tired, Nieves essentially
conceded the game to UCLA, sav
ing his starters' energy for the
deciding game.
"I was wary being up 2-0
against UCLA," Lambert said.
"When you think UCLA, they are
so used to being in finals, and they
are not going to go down easily. I
thought we were prepared, but
they gave it a great stretch. Every
time I play those guys I try to bat
tle like them, and I really respect
them."
Game 5
After being blown off the
court in the fourth game, the
Cardinal retreated to its locker

room to regroup. The team that
emerged was far different from
the one that went in. The faces of
frustration were replaced with
steely resolve, and the team that
began dragging appeared to have
found new energy.
Unlike the other four games of
the match, in which Whitehurst
had started out serving, Stanford
sent Fuerbringer to the service line
first. The four-time Ail-American
and 1997 all-tournament selection
responded by staking the Cardinal
to a 2-0 lead in the rally-scored
game. Eventually, however, UCI.A
climbed back. The Bruins stopped
Fuerbringer's serve with a timeout
and captured six of the next eight
points to go ahead 6-4. After calling
a timeout of its own, Stanford
responded, going ahead 7-6 behind
inspired play from Lambert.
The two teams traded points
unfcittfaff fame was tied at' 13-13,
with UCLA senior outside hitter
Paul Nihipali, an All-American and
all-tournament selection, serving.
Nihipali promptly put his serve
into the net, giving Stanford the
chance to serve for the match.
After watching Lambert carry the
team for most of the game, Fuer
bringer stepped up to win it.
With senior setter Stewart
Chong serving, Fuerbringer fol
lowed Nihipali, and when Nihipali
went for the kill, Fuerbringer was
there. The biggest block in Stan
ford men's volleyball history gave
the Cardinal the game 15-13, and
the match and secured its first
national championship.

"If I get a block at 1-1 in a game
I go pretty crazy," said Fuer
bringer, who had 12 kills and
seven block assists to go with his
one solo block. "It felt good, and it
feels real good. I was disappointed
with my play up to that point, but

after that my mind released total
ly; it let go of everything. I got all of
that one."

game 15-6, to even the match.
During this string of UCLA
points, Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves made critical moves,
replacing Lambert and Hoefer
with juniors Devin Poolman, an
outside hitter, and Tad Hoffman,
a middle blocker. Recognizing that
both Lambert and Hoefer
appeared tired, Nieves essentially
conceded the game to UCLA, sav
ing his starters' energy for the
deciding game.
"I was wary being up 2-0
against UCLA," Lambert said.
"When you think UCLA, they are
so used to being in finals, and they
are not going to go down easily. I
thought we were prepared, but
they gave it a great stretch. Every
time I play those guys I try to bat
tle like them, and I really respect
them."
Game 5
After being blown off the
court in the fourth game, the
Cardinal retreated to its locker

room to regroup. The team that
emerged was far different from
the one that went in. The faces of
frustration were replaced with
steely resolve, and the team that
began dragging appeared to have
found new energy.
Unlike the other four games of
the match, in which Whitehurst
had started out serving, Stanford
sent Fuerbringer to the service line
first. The four-time Ail-American
and 1997 all-tournament selection
responded by staking the Cardinal
to a 2-0 lead in the rally-scored
game. Eventually, however, UCI.A
climbed back. The Bruins stopped
Fuerbringer's serve with a timeout
and captured six of the next eight
points to go ahead 6-4. After calling
a timeout of its own, Stanford
responded, going ahead 7-6 behind
inspired play from Lambert.
The two teams traded points
unfcittfaff fame was tied at' 13-13,
with UCLA senior outside hitter
Paul Nihipali, an All-American and
all-tournament selection, serving.
Nihipali promptly put his serve
into the net, giving Stanford the
chance to serve for the match.
After watching Lambert carry the
team for most of the game, Fuer
bringer stepped up to win it.
With senior setter Stewart
Chong serving, Fuerbringer fol
lowed Nihipali, and when Nihipali
went for the kill, Fuerbringer was
there. The biggest block in Stan
ford men's volleyball history gave
the Cardinal the game 15-13, and
the match and secured its first
national championship.

"If I get a block at 1-1 in a game
I go pretty crazy," said Fuer
bringer, who had 12 kills and
seven block assists to go with his
one solo block. "It felt good, and it
feels real good. I was disappointed
with my play up to that point, but

after that my mind released total
ly; it let go of everything. I got all of
that one."

match in game five.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Stanford men's
volleyball team, which had staked its claim to
the national title all year, saw its dream
achieved Saturday at Ohio.
Beneath the dusty rafters and faded ban
ners of St. John Arena, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (27-3) defeated fellow Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation member UCLA (24-5),
earning the school's first-ever championship

in the sport and fourth of the academic year.
Appropriately, the historic 15-7, 15-10, 9-15,
6-15, 15-13 victory came at the expense of the
second-ranked Bruins, the most celebrated
men's collegiate volleyball program in the
land. Coming into the match, UCLA had won
16 NCAA titles and had amassed a record of
45-5 against Stanford.
In the first two games of the match, Stan
ford played as though it were playing against
perennial MPSF doormat UC-San Diego, not
the Bruins.

Fast Start
The Cardinal showed absolutely no jitters,
nor seemed the least hit awed by UCLA's lega
cy, quicklyjumpingout in the first game to a 3-
1 lead behind the serving of senior outside hit
ter Mike Lambert and the attacking power of
freshman outside hitter Andy Witt, forcing
UCIxA coach A 1 Scales to call a timeout. Al
though the Bruins regrouped and tied the
score at 4-4 with freshman setter Brandon


Kwesi leggett Daily
Senior Matt Fuerbringer is mobbed by his teammates after recording the block that beat UCLA and gained Stanford its first men's vol
leyball championship.
Taliaferro's kill, Stanford held the
lead from then on.
A string of UCLA errors made
the score 9-4, leading to another
UCLA timeout. After the timeout,
sophomore setter Tyler Neal, serv
ing for senior middle blocker Mike
Hoefer, put together a string of
four straight points, punctuated
by a kill from Witt to run the score
to 13-5. A brief UCLA rally was
cut short by Lambert's service ace
to make it 14-7, and the Cardinal
captured the game 15-7 on a block
by junior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst and Witt.
In the second game, the Bruins
came out fired up and jumped on
Stanford early, storming to a 4-1
lead because of numerous Cardi
nal attack and service errors.
Stanford closed the gap to 5-4 on a
kill by tournament MVP Lambert,
inducing a UCLA timeout. The
Bruins ran off a string of three
points, all because of Stanford
errors, to extend their lead to 8-4.
Stanford began to close the gap,
using improved serving and
attacking.
Although the Bruins led as late
as 10-8 in the game, they stalled
there, allowing the Card to get the
next seven points of the match.
Stanford's run was punctuated by
four straight points on senior out
side hitter Matt Fuerbringer's

serve. Four consecutive UCLA hit
ting errors allowed this string of
points and handed the Cardinal a
15-10 victory in the game and a 2-
0 lead in the match.
Bruin Comeback
Just when it appeared that the
Bruins were Finished, badly beat
en in both of the first two games
by Stanford, they mounted a huge
comeback.
UCLA's resurgence began
slowly. After jumping out to a 5-2
lead on a Lambert error, the Bru
ins allowed Stanford to take the
lead 7-5 on a Lambert ace.
However, from that point on,
the Bruins owned the game. The
Bruins used a familiar duo of
Stanford attacking and serving
errors to build a 14-8 lead before
capturing the game 15-9 when
sophomores Danny Farmer and
Fred Robins, a middle blocker and
an outside hitter, respectively,
teamed up to block Witt.
Although Stanford lost game
three, the outlook for Cardinal
fans was still rosy. Led by sopho
more Sarah Neal and junior Deb
bie Lambert, themselves accus
tomed to capturing champi
onships in women's volleyball and
sisters of Tyler and Mike, the
Stanford cheering section did all it
could to exhort the Cardinal on to
victory.
However, after trading sideouts
and coming to a tie at 2-2, the
Stanford side began to crumble.
Timeouts at 4-2 and at 8-3 were

not able to stop the Bruin
onslaught. Numerous Cardinal
errors led to Bruin points, and
even when Stanford succeeded in
getting a kill, it was never without
a Bruin touching it on its way to
the floor.
Although the Cardinal attempt
ed another late rally, it was only
able to close to 9-6 before UCLA
ran off five straight points behind
the serve of junior outside hitter
Ben Moselle to build a 14-6 lead.
UCLA eventually captured the
game 15-6, to even the match.
During this string of UCLA
points, Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves made critical moves,
replacing Lambert and Hoefer
with juniors Devin Poolman, an
outside hitter, and Tad Hoffman,
a middle blocker. Recognizing that

thought we were prepared, but
they gave it a great stretch. Every

Unlike the other four games of
the match, in which Whitehurst

The two teams traded points
unfcittfaff fame was tied at' 13-13,
with UCLA senior outside hitter
Paul Nihipali, an All-American and
