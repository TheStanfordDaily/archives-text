### Parker Hume Staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio â€” The Stanford men's
volleyball team, which had staked its claim to
the national title all year, saw its dream
achieved Saturday at Ohio.
Beneath the dusty rafters and faded ban
ners of St. John Arena, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (27-3) defeated fellow Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation member UCLA (24-5),
earning the school's first-ever championship

in the sport and fourth of the academic year.
Appropriately, the historic 15-7, 15-10, 9-15,
6-15, 15-13 victory came at the expense of the
second-ranked Bruins, the most celebrated
men's collegiate volleyball program in the
land. Coming into the match, UCLA had won
16 NCAA titles and had amassed a record of
45-5 against Stanford.
In the first two games of the match, Stan
ford played as though it were playing against
perennial MPSF doormat UC-San Diego, not
the Bruins.
