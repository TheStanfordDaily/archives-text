Women winners in UK election
LONDON (AP) — Ann. Margaret. Harriet.
Clare. Marjorie. On and on the list went, 120
women's names in all.
Britain's election was not just a victory for the
opposition Labor Party but for British women,
who nearly doubled their numbers in Parliament.
Prime Minister Tony Blair has already named
five women to Cabinet posts, including to one of
the toughest slots, Northern Ireland.
"It is good news for democracy because women
in the country will see women in Parliament,"
said Labor lawmaker Harriet Harman, who was
appointed to the Cabinet Saturday as head of
social security.
Although Margaret Thatcher became Europe's
first woman prime minister in 1979, British poli
tics has been a male bastion. Thatcher did not
have a single woman in her Cabinet and her sue

cessor, John Major, had only two.
A record 685 women were among the 3,718
candidates in Thursday's election. Labor fielded a
record 158 women candidates and its landslide
victory catapulted 102 women into the House of
Commons. The Conservatives will have only 13
women lawmakers.
Cease-fire agreed to in Zaire
POINTE NOIRE, Congo (AP) — The rebel
leader who has seized most of Zaire agreed to a
temporary cease-fire as a "gesture of good will"
before meeting yesterday with President Mobutu
Sese Seko.
During a news conference with a grim-faced
Mobutu and smiling rebel leader Laurent Kabila,
U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun told reporters
aboard a South African naval ship that Kabila had
agreed to halt his troops before the meeting.
