# Some taxes cut in budget deal
## Breaks for investors, families with kids key parts of package 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Early winners in the
balanced budget deal's $85-billion tax-cut package
seem to be investors and families with children,
including those in college.
Precisely who wins and to what extent, however,
won't be known for some time.
Treasury Secretary Robert llubin said most of
the package "will be used to fund programs that will
benefit middle-income people."
But Republican congressional leaders and the
White House offered few specifics on taxes in the
ground-breaking budget deal announced Friday.
Filling in much of the detail appears to have been
left to Congress' two tax-writing committees.
The broad outline is for $135 billion in tax cuts,
offset by $50 billion in new revenues, for a net $85
billion in tax cuts over five years. The package calls
for tax cuts ; n five areas: lower capital gains and
estate taxes, education tax breaks, a per-child tax

credit and expanded Individual Retirement
Accounts.
Budget negotiators got a big boost at the last
minute with word that the strong state of the econ
omy would allow them to figure in an extra $200
billion over the five years. That shielded Social
Security from changes in its cost-of-living index,
eased the president's proposed cuts in Medicaid and
added billions to domestic spending programs.
Although the deal had relatively strong biparti
san support, one principal, Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., the Finance Committee chairman, expressed
reservations over its tax package. "I am, of course,
disappointed that the tax cut is very limited," said
Roth, who wanted $193 billion in tax cuts.
To pay lor the tax cuts, the agreement will raise
$30 billion by continuing the 10 percent tax on
domestic air passenger travel as well as related air
line taxes.
