Non-partisan committee
has cleared the way for
election to be certified

IN A FIRESTORM of e-mail that
was confined to the computers
of a select few, allegations were
leveled last week against ASSU
President-elect Emily Andrus and
Vice President-elect Ben Decker
over whether they violated cam
paign finance regulations. The
ASSU Hearings Committee, the
body charged with evaluating
potential violations of the campaign
practices code, decidedly dismissed
all of the allegations Saturday.
Why all of this matters, of course,
is that the ASSU Senate will vote
tomorrow on whether to certify this
spring's elections and, in so doing,
will officially send the Andrus/
Decker ticket either into power or
packing. In light of the Hearing
Committee's findings, it is impera
tive that the senate put such specu
lative allegations aside and uphold
the student body's overwhelming
support for Andrus and Decker.
The bulk of the allegations dealt
with the amount of money Andrus
spent on posters. She was accused
of not paying "fair market value"
for her printing expenses and for
seriously underestimating the costs
of producing banners. Such allega
tions effectively suggested that
Andrus had committed financial
fraud in winning the election.
It is important to note that these
allegations did not come out of left
field. After all, most of Andrus'
declared expenses seemed a bit
questionable to any curious stu
dent. For example, it is difficult to
believe, without any explanation on
Andrus' part, that two seemingly
professionally made banners could
cost only about $9.
Fortunately, though, the ASSU
has a system in place that does not
take all allegations at face value.
And the hearings committee, a

group composed of students select
ed from the entire student body by
the non-partisan Nominations
Commission, is the manifestation of
that system. Fortunately for every
one, the hearings committee let
Andrus speak for herself.
Responding to charges that she
did not specify how she spent some
$200 on posters, Andrus produced a
letter from the manager at her local
Kinko's (at which she did the copy
ing over spring break) detailing the
expenses. When asked why she only
declared $150 of the $200 spent at
Kinko's, Andrus explained that the
extra $50 was spent on fliers set
aside to be used in case of a run-off
election. And those infamous ban
ners? Andrus explained that she
bought leftover scraps from a tent
maker for $9 and created the ban
ners from them, without the help of
a professional design team.
Upon hearing this testimony, the
hearings committee felt no formal
reprimand or punishment was ap
propriate for Andrus' slate and thus
determined the issue to be over.
It might seem a little silly to bick
er over Kinko's costs and banner
fabric, but a refusal to follow cam
paign regulations that are designed
to promote fair election campaigns
would undermine a candidate's
credibility and, more important,
make that person an ineffectual
leader of the student body.
Yet when the senate makes its
decision tomorrow night, it must
understand that no campaign rules
were violated nor was there any per
version of the elections process.
There are likely to be, of course,
some students who will continually
question Andrus' tactics and strate
gies. But the senate should not, at
least officially, have that luxury.
After all, that body created the
hearings committee to determine
the validity of charges brought
against students and the committee
has found that Andrus did nothing
wrong. To not follow its recommen
dations, and thus not validate the
election, would be a gross violation
on the senate's part.
