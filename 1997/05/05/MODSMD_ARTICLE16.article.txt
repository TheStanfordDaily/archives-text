## Take me to your mentor 
### 
THIS IS NOT about tenure per se,
primarily because I have already
written about tenure, and clearly
that column had no noticeable effect on
the number of women being hired. (Why
Stanford even hires women in the first
place is the flip statement that is not so
flip anymore.) Right now,though, I am
worried about what the lack of these pro
fessors will mean.
A tenured professor I know says the
dean's tenure committee looks mostly at
letters and reviews from outside faculty.
For junior faculty, this means you are
judged less on what you do for the quali
ty of your students' lives than for the
impact you have on your colleagues'
work.
It is often junior faculty teaching CIV,
coaxing indolent freshmen into loving
Shakespeare or Woolf. Junior faculty
take on the bulk of senior theses, coach
ing students with a kind of empathy that
comes from a remembered anxiety. They
serve as resident fellows, taking students
to the hospital with alcohol poisoning,
barbecuing with them in the backyard.
One of the problems that the tenure
trouble has made manifest is an institu
tional indifference to the practice of men
toring. It is difficult to argue that Stan
ford places a high value on fostering fac
ulty-student relationships. (Look at the
horror that is freshman advising.) I know
an astounding number of people who say
that their departmentally assigned advi

sors don't recognize them in the hallway.
It can be hard to approach faculty, so
many of whom never seem to fumble for
a word or fail to articulate a perfectly
ripened thought.
My sister, who is a frosh, asked me
how to get a professor to be her advisor.
"Go to office hours and talk to him," I
said.
"But what do I say?" she asked back.
How well I remember that feeling of
anxiety in approaching faculty, unsure of
what I had to say to someone with far
more knowledge and self-confidence. How
grateful T am that I knocked on that first
office door, not even realizing how many
more doors it would open up for me.
Where to find a mentor: a seminar, a
colloquium, an ethnic center. The faculty
found in these places are not always
tenured but show a great deal of desire to
work with and to get to know students.
Students might find a Lou Roberts in col
loquy, who took a student's thesis that
was sprawling and, with a few scissor
quick comments, helped the student dis
cover exactly what she wanted to say. Or
they might find a Laura Smoller, whose
undergraduate seminars are known for
their complex, quick-witted discussions
and their long student waiting lists.
I cannot think of anyone who has had
more of a profound effect on my academ
ic and personal life than Sharon Hol
land, who rekindles my activism, chal
lenges my beliefs and helps me to pub

lish the writing that comes from all of
this. Sharon speaks often of the late poet
Audre Lorde as a touchstone for a
panoply of people. If anyone embodies
that kind of talismanic spirit, it is
Sharon, taking on the role of mentor
from the English department to the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, the women's center to the ethnic
centers. The phrase "she's one of ours"
comes up all the time and it's a revela
tion to see how different the people are
who say it.
I would like to know how many times
the quality of student life is going to be
sacrificed in the name of the University's
reputation, a reputation which is appar
ently good enough for the First Daughter.
Sir Isaac Newton, who did not publish
enough to make him eligible for tenure,
once said, "If I have seen further than
others, it is because I have stood on the
shoulders of giants." Many of the wonder
ful members of the senior faculty, people
who advise my thesis and enrich my life,
will be retiring soon. Tell me, John
Shoven and committee, are you leaving us
any shoulders on which to stand?

Teri Stein, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, threatens to write
about tenure again if things do not
improve.
