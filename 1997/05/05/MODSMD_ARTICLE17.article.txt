Sawislak's tenure denial proves glass ceilings still exist

LAST MONTH, THE School of
Humanities and Sciences' deans'
committee refused tenure to one
of the History Department's brightest
stars. Karen Sawislak, an Americanist
specializing in labor history, is beloved
by her students and admired by her col
leagues. This letter is our statement of
protest against the deans' decision. It is
a decision that has, in one stroke, failed
to acknowledge Sawislak's merits as a
scholar and as a teacher. It is a decision
that we believe has no reasonable
grounds.
The decision against Karen Sawis
lak comes on the heels of another
equally illogical ruling by the deans'

committee. Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta was also recently denied
tenure. Like Sawislak, he is an out
standing scholar and teacher. Like
Sawislak, he received the unanimous
support of his department. And, like
Sawislak, his rejection has provoked
outrage and anger among both col
leagues and students.
We are incensed by the refusal to
grant tenure to both Gupta and Sawis
lak. These decisions by the deans evi
dence a callous disregard for the
departments in question. By ignoring
the unanimous recommendation to
tenure made in both cases, the deans
have shown the very slightest regard

for Stanford University's faculty.
Perhaps more important, the failure
to grant tenure to Gupta and Sawislak
is part of a disturbing trend. Stanford
is among the least hospitable universi
ties for both women and minorities. In
both the sciences and the humanities,
Stanford has not fulfilled its stated
commitments to significantly increas
ing the proportion of tenured women
faculty. In fact, the levels of women
and minority faculty are startlingly low
in comparison with other universities
of Stanford's caliber. It would be
extraordinarily easy, in reviewing these
tenure denials, to come the conclusion
that Stanford is intentionally restrict-

ing the advancement of individuals
from certain groups.
Whatever one's opinion on these
issues, both Gupta and Sawislak
deserve tenure. The deans' choice to
deny them is arrogant and unjust, and
it will only have negative repercussions
