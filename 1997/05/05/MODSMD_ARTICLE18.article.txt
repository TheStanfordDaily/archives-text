# Daily contributed to Stanford's general lack of support for the arts

Are Stanford's national champions
entitled to a front-page article or a last
page article?
The Daily usually does a very good job

at giving NCAA champs the coverage they
deserve, which is why I was so disappoint
ed with Wednesday's article describing
Talisman A Cappella's national champi
onship, which they won at Carnegie Hall
the previous weekend. Talisman's achieve
ment was comparable to that of any sports
team. Groups from schools such as second
place University of Illinois and Brown
University had full-page articles written
about them in their school newspapers.
Not onlv did (he article on Talisman mis

quote two members, but it appeared on
the very last page of The Daily.
The fact is that the fine arts aren't sup
ported as much at Stanford as they tire at
other schools, particularly those in the Ivy
Ix'ague. Our music and art departments
are vigorously underfunded, and groups
which try to enhance the arts such ;is
Ram's Head have less money than many
high school programs. The result of this
lack of support by the University commu
nity is that many talented musicians and

art ists decide not to attend our school.
As several newspapers have suggest
ed, it may well be that Chelsea Clinton
decided to come to Stanford because our
students are "well-rounded." I've heard
that Chelsea is a ballerina. I hope she
does not want to pursue her interest in
the arts at our school. If she does, maybe
she'll realize that we're not as well
rounded as we seem.
