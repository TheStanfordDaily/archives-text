## Final Four loss ends rugby season 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Hoping to gain a berth in the
national collegiate champi
onships at Berkeley yesterday,
the men's rugby team hit a
familiar detour the day before
the title game.
The Cardinal (15-5) was
downed by Penn State 22-17 in
its semifinal match. This was
the same Nittany Lion team who
last year knocked the Cardinal
out of its first-round Final Four
game 42-29.
"We were absolutely not
clear-headed," said head coach
Franck Boivert. "We kept mak
ing horrible decisions because of
a lack of concentration. It dis
played a huge breakdown in dis

cipline. They got nervous for
reasons we can't explain."
The men struck first about 35
minutes into the first half, when
Doug McDonald forced his way
through into the left corner of the
end zone for a 5-0 Cardinal lead.
But the Lions were able to
take the lead with two minutes
left in the half when they pinned
the Cardinal near the end zone.
Penn State senior Jesse Erway
intercepted a pass and scored
the try right up the middle. Matt
Duncombe converted the kick to
give Penn State a 7-5 lead.
The Cardinal came on strong
to open the second half when
sophomore Don Donester scored
three minutes in to give the Car
dinal a 10-7 lead. They extended
the lead to 10 points when junior

Tom Efird scored from the
seven-yard line, and junior Dave
Warter made it 17-7 with the
converted kick.
The rest of the match was all
Penn State as the Nittany Lions
slowly came back. After a try
and three-point penalty kick by
Duncombe, the Cardinal found
the Lions right on their heels 17-
15.
Penn State sealed the win
with a try bv Kurt Shuman with
only four minutes left in the
match.
The men went on to lose their
consolation match to UC-Davis
yesterday 52-31. Boivert juggled
the lineups and put in many
younger players in order to get
them experience with playing at
this level.

"Wo changed the team around
a lot," Boivert said. "We're look
ing to next year. It's time to turn
the page."
The Aggies jumped out to a
26-0 first-half lead before the
Cardinal cut the deficit to 16 at
the intermission. The teams
exchanged tries for most of the
second half, with Stanford never
coming close enough to seriously
threaten.
"This is a tough way to go,"
said senior captain Joe Clayton.
"But there's a lot of potential in
the young guys. I think today
they picked up a lot of pointers
for the future."
Cal went on to defeat the
Lions in the finals yesterday 41-
15 to capture its seventh consec
utive collegiate title.
