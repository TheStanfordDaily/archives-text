Whiplash.
Arizona's center fielder Diego
Rico must have a severely sore
neck after watching eight home
runs sail over the fence of
Sunken Diamond this weekend.
The Stanford baseball team (37-
13, 20-7 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) swept three
games from the Wildcats (32-26,
13-17) in impressive fashion,
winning 9-2 in the opener, 13-9
Saturday and 12-1 in the finale
yesterday.
Stanford's lead over UCLA in
the Six-Pac grew to three games,
clinching at least a tie for the
title. The Cardinal still need to
take one from UCLA on the Bru
ins' home soil next weekend to
earn the Six-Pac's spot in the
Pac-10 championship series in
two weeks. The Bruins (38-15-1,
17-10) took two of three from Cal
(18-37, 4-26), not allowing Stan
ford to clinch outright.
The pieces are falling into
place at just the right time for
Stanford. Consistent defense,
fabulous pitching and powerful
hitting combined to make the
Cardinal a force to be reckoned
with.
"We are doing everything
right," said junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer, who is batting .531
and slugging a phenomenal 1.375
with 17 runs and 19 RBIs in the
Cardinal's eight-game winning
streak, in which Stanford has
slugged 25 home runs. "We have
been playing consistently well
and are putting things together."
The Cardinal began its home
run romp Friday, hitting three
dingers to put Arizona away 9-2
in the first game of the set.
After Arizona jumped out
ahead in the top of the first,
Schaeffer became the first Stan
ford hitter to send a ball out of
the park, homering in the first off
of Wildcat starter Darrell lluss
man (4-8) with two runners on to
give Stanford a 3-1 lead. The
home run was the 15th for the
Six-Pac player of the week.
Hussman's luck didn't get any
better. He gave up another home
run in the fourth when freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth
launched a ball over the right
field fence to score two more and
put the Cardinal up 5-0.
But the long-ball hitting
wasn't over until senior first
baseman Luke Quaccia had a

turn. Already on a home-run tear
left over from last weekend's Cal
series, he sent his seventh out of
the park to put the Card ahead 9-
1.
Arizona's only other run came
in the eighth off sophomore
reliever Tony Cogan.
Junior starter Kyle Peterson
(9-2) held the Wildcats to five hits

and one earned run over seven
innings to turn the game into his
ninth win. His 10 strikeouts gave
him 319 for his career, putting
him third on the Stanford all
time list.
But exquisite pitching prowess

wasn't a prerequisite for beating
the Wildcats, as Arizona's nine runs
in game two weren't enough to boat
the streaking Cardinal.
After pitching a complete game
strikeout against Cal last weekend,
sophomore starter Brent Hoard
struggled Saturday. But the Card's
explosive offense and stellar relief
pitching made up the difference.
With a two-run double in the
first and a home run by junior first
baseman Kenny Corley in the
fourth, the Wildcats had powered to
a 6-3 lead.
But in came sophomore reliever
Jeff Austin (3-2) to take over for
Hoard. He clamped down on the
Wildcats, allowing nothing but
three inconsequential unearned
runs in the ninth, far after it mat
tered. He finished with 5 2/3
innings, one late walk and seven
strikeouts.
Behind Austin's solid pitching,
the Cardinal, sparked by another
home run by Schaeffer, sprinted to
four runs in the fifth and five in the
seventh. Muth and freshman John
Gall also contributed long balls for
the Card.
The excitement didn't stop iifter
game two, as Stanford easily dis
posed of the Wildcats again yester
day. With four runs in the first
inning, the Cardinal never looked
back. Aided by homers from sopho
more second baseman Tony
Schrager and Schaeffer, his eighth
in the last eight games, Stanford
recorded a 12-1 victory.
Schrager started for the second
consecutive game in place of junior
Joe Kilburg, who was hit by a 1 luss
man pitch Friday and kept out the
remainder of the weekend. It was
Kilburg's first missed start since
1995.
But sophomore Chad Hutchin
son (5-3) stole the show and pitched
a dandy, allowing only one run on
six hits in 7 2/3 innings. Most
impressively, Hutchinson did not
walk a single Wildcat. Cogan closed
out the game without allowing Ari
zona a hit.
Hutchinson's performance gave
the 2,337 spectators on Fan Appre
ciation Day reason to cheer as Stan
ford wrapped up its home slate with
a 23-8 record. Quaccia, left fielder
Chris Clark and manager Sam Sta
pleton were honored as seniors
before the game.
