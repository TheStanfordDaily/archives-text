# Softball racks up three wins
## 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Softball did what it needed to in order
to keep it's name among those hopeful to
receive a position in the regional tourna
ment. On Saturday, Stanford (28-26-1, 7-
17 Pacific 10 Conference) split with
Washington (42-12, 13-6) with a 1-0,
nine-inning win and a 2-0, 10-inning loss.
On Sunday it swept San Diego State (30-
26) 3-1 and 1-0.
Saturday's games against Washington
were duels between the teams' pitchers,
with both games going into extra innings.
In game one Stanford sophomore ace
Becky Blevins (13-15) pitched a master
ful game, lasting all nine innings. She
allowed only five hits and no walks in her
shutout. Blevins has been dependable all
season long, and with her pitching, the
team knows it only has to produce a few
runs to have a good chance of winning.
Washington's Jennifer Spediacci (12-
4) proved difficult to hit as well, with an
arsenal of pitches to keep Stanford hit
ters off balance. She had a nasty screw
ball to help her record five strikeouts.
The game came down to who would
capitalize on the first scoring opportuni
ty, and Stanford did this in the bottom of
the ninth. With the bases loaded, senior
first baseman Summer Lee came to bat

looking to drive in the winning run. The
team had loaded the bases with two hits
and a walk. I/ee produced a solid ground
hall which was handled deep enough in
the infield so freshman catcher Kellie
Wiginton could score from third.
In game two against the I luskies, both
pitchers produced some major heat to
keep the hitters at bay. Sophomore pitch
er Marcy Crouch (13-11) was near perfec
tion for nine innings, getting into very
few jams and working her way out of the
ones she incurred.
Neither team produced any significant
scoring opportunities after nine innings.
In the 10th the rule that puts a runner on
second to start the inning was imple
mented.
Washington quickly got runners on
first and second after Crouch hit the first
batter, Spediacci (now the designated
player). After an out and a walk, the
bases were loaded for shortstop Rosie
Leutzinger. Her third hit gave Washing
ton a 2-0 lead. Stanford had one opportu
nity to tie it in the bottom of the 10th but
failed to rally.
Stanford came back yesterday to post
two big wins, using several extra-base
hits to win l>oth contests. In game one,
Stanford jumped to an early 3-1 lead
which was never relinquished by Blevins.
The defense behind h»>r was magnificent

as well. Diving plays by Wiginton and
sophomore second baseman Jennie Foyle
extinguished the few potential opportu
nities that the Aztecs had.
"We had some great defensive plays
today that really complemented our
pitching," said head coach John Rittman.
On the offensive end, back-to-back
doubles by sophomore Michelle Acosta
and Ix?e allowed the Cardinal to strike
first in the second inning. San Diego
State would tie the game at 1-1 in the top
of the fourth, but the Cardinal took the
lead in the bottom of the inning. A triple
by Acosta brought in Crouch, who had
singled, and an off-the-wall double by
sophomore outfielder Dawn Kobata
scored Acosta. The remainder of the
game went scoreless.
In game two, Stanford scored once in
the second inning and then watched as
Crouch provided a shutout to achieve the
win. The only run came from a single by
Kobata. She brought in Lee from second,
who had doubled earlier in the inning.
For most of the game, both the Stanford
and San Diego State players seemed off
in their timing while at the plate.
"Washington had some pitchers that
threw some heat while the San Diego
State pitchers threw a lot of off-speed
pitches," Rittman said. "They did a
good job of keeping our hitters a lit
tle off balance."
With the strong performance
this weekend, Stanford still needs
to finish in Oregon with at least
three wins out of four games. In
the first weekend of April, Stanford
swept Oregon State 3-2 and 7-0
and beat Oregon 2-1 before losing
to the Ducks 3-2 in 10 innings.
