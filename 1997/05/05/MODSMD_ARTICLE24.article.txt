# Golfers head for Pac-10s
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
With a second-place team finish in the
U.S. Intercollegiate and tin; two big indi
vidual titles under its belt, the Stanford
men's golf team will be looking for some
fresh blood this week at the Pacific 10 Con
ference tournament at Eugene Country
Club in Eugene, Ore. The tournament will
host the Cardinal today through Wednes
day for a total of four rounds and 72 holes.
The tournament will use a six-count
four format, in which each team brings in
six scores and counts four. The top six
golfers for Stanford will bo sophomore Joel
Kribel, senior Conrad Kay, freshman Dusty
Brett, sophomore Scott Wang, senior Pete
Ligotti and freshman Michael Weimer.
What will be unique about Pac-10s this
year is that they will not count toward
regional standings for any of the competi
tors. Stanford's district, District 8, will
send 12 teams to compete with the top six
teams from District 7 (the Rocky Mountain
District) in the NCAA West Regional next
week. Stanford is currently ranked ninth in
its district and will travel to the regional
tournament in San Diego regardless of its
finish at Pac-lOs.
"Regionals are already decided; the
rankings are already set and that's ;iII that
matters," Kribel said. "Still, it will be

preparation for us and also good for brag
ging rights."
"It's a big pride issue," Brett said. "Still,
we're basically preparing for regionals."
The squad will face almost the same
competition as last week, when Stanford
placed behind only USC at the U.S. Inter
collegiates and hopes to place even higher
in this tourney.
"We're playing against basically the
same field if you add Arizona and take
away some of the smaller District 7 teams,"
Ray said.
Stanford will receive its most difficult
competition from USC, Arizona and Ari
zona State. Other tough competitors will
include Oregon, California, UCLA and
Washington. Most of the competing teams
will also play at regionals.
Ray and the golfers remain undaunted
by the field.
"We're looking to win this week," he
said. "We've been trying to peak at the
right time, and now (before regionals) is
the time to win this tournament."
One advantage the Stanford squad will
have is a prior knowledge of the course,
having placed 10th in The Duck Tourna
ment hosted by Oregon during the winter.
Although the Card experienced climatic
adversity in the form of heavy rains, the
golfers hope to avoid the rain and
finish even higher this time.
"Joel and I felt pretty good
about our finishes up here last
time, and a couple other guys
played well, too," Kay said. "I
think this will tfive l|s some
advantage."
Even if the I'uc-10 tournament

this year will count for little more
than practice and bragging rights,
the golfers are approaching it
with as much seriousness and
enthusiasm as any competition.
"Every tournament we play in
is good for us in that it gives us
more experience," Kay said.
"We've been trying every tourna
ment to better our play, and not
only will Fac-lOs be good practice
for us but it will get us in the
competitive mode for regionals
one week away."
