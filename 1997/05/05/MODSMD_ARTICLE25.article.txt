# Season in review: volleyball weathers early troubles and meets expectations
## 
### Parker Hume Staff writer 
Finally, after three years, the
reign is over. A new king has
been crowned in the realm of

men's volleyball.
In winning its first-ever crown
Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
capped a dream season and
ensured that it, and not 16-time

national champion UCLA, would
be the honored guest at the coro
nation.
Stanford's season began early
last fall, nearly 9 months ago,
when the team traveled to Hawaii
during the fall to scrimmage the
Rainbows, last year's national
runner-up and a team that would
serve as the stick against which
Stanford could measure its
chances for the coming year.
After a successful trip to the
islands, the Card returned home
to train for the rest of the fall in
preparation for the season's start
in January.
Stanford, picked in nearly
every poll to win the national
championship and ranked
accordingly in the preseason
polls, felt the pressure of being
the national frontrunner early
on. While it would be unfair to
say that the team ever struggled,
the results, at the outset, were
mixed.
The Cardinal began its season
the same way that it would end it,
traveling to Columbus, Ohio, to
participate in an NCAA Preview
tournament. In Columbus, Stan
ford recorded wins over Indiana-
Purdue-Fort Wayne and Ohio
State, two of the top teams in the
Midwest Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association. In the two
matches, both of which Stanford
won in three games, senior out
side hitter Mike Lambert led the
team. His 66 kills during the two
matches made it clear to the rest
of the country that the senior,
just off his time in Atlanta with
the U.S. Olympic team, would be
a real force to be reckoned with.
"Lambert had two really
strong matches," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "He played really
well when we needed him most
and carried us at crucial spots

throughout both matches. We
will need him to do more of that if
we are to be successful for the
rest of the year but we can't rely
on him like that every night."
After cleaning up in the
nation's heartland, Stanford
returned to the West Coast to
begin play in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation. The Cardi
nal's first dates were in San
Diego against UC-San Diego and
San Diego State, two of the
league's worst teams. Stanford
trounced both the hapless Tri
tons and Aztecs 3-0. Lambert
once again provided the high
lights, totaling 21 kills, six digs
and five blocks, while hitting .548
against San Diego State.
Stanford hit the road once
again the following weekend,
returning to Southern California
to face USC and Long Beach
State. Going into the match
against the Trojans, Nieves was
concerned, citing USC's mercuri
al performances in past matches
and fearing that a strong effort
from the Trojans would be
enough to defeat the Card.
Nieves' prediction held true,
as USC sent Stanford to its first
loss of the season. Stanford
totaled 29 service errors en route
to losing 3-1.
"Although USC played really
well, we really hurt ourselves,"
said assistant coach John Kosty.
"In the past, we looked to have
one or two errors for every ace;
this time our number of aces was
not enough to overcome the great
number of service errors."
Stanford rebounded with a
strong effort against the 49ers of
Long Beach State, gaining a 3-0
victory. In the match, Stanford
hit .429 as a team. The Card was
led on to victory by the play of
junior reserves Tad Hoffman, a

middle blocker, and Tyler Neal, a
setter, who together provided
Stanford the defensive power
that it needed.
For the third weekend in a
row, Stanford hit the road, this
time traveling to play No. 2
Brigham Young on the Cougars'
home court in Provo, Utah. Once
again, visiting a tough team on
the road, Stanford fell, this time
in a heart-breaking five-game
m of r» Vt

12-15 in the fifth. In losing, the
Card relinquished its No. 1 rank
ing to the Cougars, falling to
fourth in the land.
Stanford returned home for
its first league battle of the sea
son at Burnham on Feb. 19. UC-
Santa Barbara and Pacific came

to Palo Alto for the weekend's
action. Stanford won both
matches in three games, making
the Gauchos look particularly
bad in the process. Senior out
side hitter Matt Fuerbringer col
lected 18 kills while hitting a
blistering .536 in the match
against hapless UC-Santa Bar
bara.
After thrashing the Gauchos
and Tigers, Stanford welcomed

match that was never close.
laking a break from league
play, the Cardinal next hosted
MIVA member Loyola-Chicago.
I he Ramblers, not expected to
challenge Stanford, put up a

light, running Stanford to five
games but eventually falling to
the Card. Reserve junior outside
hitter Devin Poolman was the
star of the match, collecting 21
kills in his first start of the sea
son.
Following the Loyola match,
the squad took to the road once
again, traveling southward again
for five of its next seven match
es. The road trip began with a
tough match against UCLA in
which the Cardinal beat itself,
falling to the Bruins 3-1.
Although nobody knew it at the
time, it was to be the last Stan
ford loss of the season.
The squad rebounded against
Loyola Marymount, sending the
Lions to a 3-0 defeat. Junior mid
dle blocker Keenan Whitehurst
led the attack with another out
standing performance, collecting
12 kills and hitting and outstand
ing .800.
The Card returned briefly to
Burnham to face Ball State, a
team that Stanford beat in rela
tively easy fashion 3-1, fulfilling a
goal by topping all of the MIVA
teams on its schedule. Fuer
bringer led the charge, collecting
24 kills and a career-high 18 digs.
"It was a real nice win for us,"
Fuerbringer said. "We had want
ed to beat all of the Midwest
teams we played."
Follwing Ball State, the team
faced an easy test in Cal State-
Northridge. The Matadors fell in
front of Witt's .577 hitting and 17
kills.
The team hit the road for its
next three matches. Against I C-
Santa Cruz, a nonleague oppo
nent, sophomore setter PK Diff
enbaugh led the way with 40
assists, three digs and two blocks
as Stanford cruised. 1 he Card
continued its roll against Pepper

dine, one of the country's top
teams. Lambert erupted for 36
kills and again carried Stanford
to a 3-1 victory. The squad fin
ished its road trip with an easy
win against UC-Irvine in which
Witt hit .870 and collected 21
kills, leading Stanford to a 3-0
win.
After returning home, Stan
ford welcomed the Rainbows for
two matches. The two teams
squared off in one of the best
matches of the year on the first
night — a five-game thriller that
the home team won. Senior setter
Stewart Chong totaled 109
assists, the third-highest total in
Stanford history. Witt led Stan
ford to a win on the second night,
gaining player of the week honors
in the process.
The roll at Burnham contin
ued, as Stanford finished up the
season at home with straight for
ward wins in 3-0 fashion over Cal
State-San Bernardino, San Diego
State and UC-San Diego. The San
Bernardino match saw sopho
more outside hitter Pat Klein
pick up a season-high seven kills.
Against UC-San Diego senior out
side hitter Aaron Garcia delight
ed the crowd in his last regular
season home match with 12 kills,
four digs, four blocks, three aces
and .417 hitting.
The Card finished up its sea
son on a high note with a 3-1 vic
tory at UOP in which Lambert
led the way with 40 kills.
Stanford began what would be
a remarkable postseason run
with a 3-0 victory over Pepper
dine. Fuerbringer led the way
with 23 kills and .531 hitting.
Stanford relied heavily on Fuer
bringer for the rest of the MPSF
tourney, as he added 17 kills
against BYU and capped off a
week in which he was named

player of the week with a .556
hitting performance at UCLA,
which ended the Bruins four
year stranglehold on the league
title.
After winning the MPSF title,
the Card was ranked No. 1 and
seeded accordingly going into its
first NCAA tournament since
1992. Resolved to come home a
winner, Stanford demolished
fourth-seeded Ball State behind
46 kills from the combination of
Fuerbringer, Lambert and Witt
and setting up a rubber match
with the Bruins. The result
against the Bruins, a 3-2 victory
that brought Stanford its first
national title, cannot be justified
in a few sentences in a season
profile.
Whitehurst saved his best for
last, totaling 17 kills, nine blocks,
and hitting .615. In addition,
sophomores Jeremy Bart and
junior Tyler Neal, both setters,
came off of the bench to provide
timely digging and serving.
For the Cardinal, who gradu
ates seven seniors including mid
dle blocker Brian Moore, who
sustained a season-ending knee
injury before the season began,
the season was indeed a dream.
From Lambert's 66 kills in the
team's first two matches to the
combined efforts of Chong and
Hoefer against Hawaii and con
cluding with Fuerbringer's block
that will forever be linked with
Stanford's crowning as a national
volleyball power, the team was
led by this strong core. However,
with the combination of Witt and
Whitehurst working on the inside
and the outside, the future is
bright as well.
"We achieved a goal, and any
time you can achieve a goal in
your life, it is pretty sweet,"
Fuerbringer said.

player of the week with a .556
hitting performance at UCLA,
which ended the Bruins four
year stranglehold on the league
title.
After winning the MPSF title,
the Card was ranked No. 1 and
seeded accordingly going into its
first NCAA tournament since
1992. Resolved to come home a
winner, Stanford demolished
fourth-seeded Ball State behind
46 kills from the combination of
Fuerbringer, Lambert and Witt
and setting up a rubber match
with the Bruins. The result
against the Bruins, a 3-2 victory
that brought Stanford its first
national title, cannot be justified
in a few sentences in a season
profile.
Whitehurst saved his best for
last, totaling 17 kills, nine blocks,
and hitting .615. In addition,
sophomores Jeremy Bart and
junior Tyler Neal, both setters,
came off of the bench to provide
timely digging and serving.
For the Cardinal, who gradu
ates seven seniors including mid
dle blocker Brian Moore, who
sustained a season-ending knee
injury before the season began,
the season was indeed a dream.
From Lambert's 66 kills in the
team's first two matches to the
combined efforts of Chong and
Hoefer against Hawaii and con
cluding with Fuerbringer's block
that will forever be linked with
Stanford's crowning as a national
volleyball power, the team was
led by this strong core. However,
with the combination of Witt and
Whitehurst working on the inside
and the outside, the future is
bright as well.
"We achieved a goal, and any
time you can achieve a goal in
your life, it is pretty sweet,"
Fuerbringer said.

Finally, after three years, the
reign is over. A new king has
been crowned in the realm of

men's volleyball.
In winning its first-ever crown
Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
capped a dream season and
ensured that it, and not 16-time

national champion UCLA, would
be the honored guest at the coro
nation.
Stanford's season began early
last fall, nearly 9 months ago,
when the team traveled to Hawaii
during the fall to scrimmage the
Rainbows, last year's national
runner-up and a team that would
serve as the stick against which
Stanford could measure its
chances for the coming year.
After a successful trip to the
islands, the Card returned home
to train for the rest of the fall in
preparation for the season's start
in January.
Stanford, picked in nearly
every poll to win the national
championship and ranked
accordingly in the preseason
polls, felt the pressure of being
the national frontrunner early
on. While it would be unfair to
say that the team ever struggled,
the results, at the outset, were
mixed.
The Cardinal began its season
the same way that it would end it,
traveling to Columbus, Ohio, to
participate in an NCAA Preview
tournament. In Columbus, Stan
ford recorded wins over Indiana-
Purdue-Fort Wayne and Ohio
State, two of the top teams in the
Midwest Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association. In the two
matches, both of which Stanford
won in three games, senior out
side hitter Mike Lambert led the
team. His 66 kills during the two
matches made it clear to the rest
of the country that the senior,
just off his time in Atlanta with
the U.S. Olympic team, would be
a real force to be reckoned with.
"Lambert had two really
strong matches," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "He played really
well when we needed him most
and carried us at crucial spots

throughout both matches. We
will need him to do more of that if
we are to be successful for the
rest of the year but we can't rely
on him like that every night."
After cleaning up in the
nation's heartland, Stanford
returned to the West Coast to
begin play in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation. The Cardi
nal's first dates were in San
Diego against UC-San Diego and
San Diego State, two of the
league's worst teams. Stanford
trounced both the hapless Tri
tons and Aztecs 3-0. Lambert
once again provided the high
lights, totaling 21 kills, six digs
and five blocks, while hitting .548
against San Diego State.
Stanford hit the road once
again the following weekend,
returning to Southern California
to face USC and Long Beach
State. Going into the match
against the Trojans, Nieves was
concerned, citing USC's mercuri
al performances in past matches
and fearing that a strong effort
from the Trojans would be
enough to defeat the Card.
Nieves' prediction held true,
as USC sent Stanford to its first
loss of the season. Stanford
totaled 29 service errors en route
to losing 3-1.
"Although USC played really
well, we really hurt ourselves,"
said assistant coach John Kosty.
"In the past, we looked to have
one or two errors for every ace;
this time our number of aces was
not enough to overcome the great
number of service errors."
Stanford rebounded with a
strong effort against the 49ers of
Long Beach State, gaining a 3-0
victory. In the match, Stanford
hit .429 as a team. The Card was
led on to victory by the play of
junior reserves Tad Hoffman, a

middle blocker, and Tyler Neal, a
setter, who together provided
Stanford the defensive power
that it needed.
For the third weekend in a
row, Stanford hit the road, this
time traveling to play No. 2
Brigham Young on the Cougars'
home court in Provo, Utah. Once
again, visiting a tough team on
the road, Stanford fell, this time
in a heart-breaking five-game
m of r» Vt

12-15 in the fifth. In losing, the
Card relinquished its No. 1 rank
ing to the Cougars, falling to
fourth in the land.
Stanford returned home for
its first league battle of the sea
son at Burnham on Feb. 19. UC-
Santa Barbara and Pacific came

to Palo Alto for the weekend's
action. Stanford won both
matches in three games, making
the Gauchos look particularly
bad in the process. Senior out
side hitter Matt Fuerbringer col
lected 18 kills while hitting a
blistering .536 in the match
against hapless UC-Santa Bar
bara.
After thrashing the Gauchos
and Tigers, Stanford welcomed

laking a break from league
play, the Cardinal next hosted
MIVA member Loyola-Chicago.
I he Ramblers, not expected to
challenge Stanford, put up a

light, running Stanford to five
games but eventually falling to
the Card. Reserve junior outside
hitter Devin Poolman was the
star of the match, collecting 21
kills in his first start of the sea
son.
Following the Loyola match,
the squad took to the road once
again, traveling southward again
for five of its next seven match
es. The road trip began with a
tough match against UCLA in
which the Cardinal beat itself,
falling to the Bruins 3-1.
Although nobody knew it at the
time, it was to be the last Stan
ford loss of the season.
The squad rebounded against
Loyola Marymount, sending the
Lions to a 3-0 defeat. Junior mid
dle blocker Keenan Whitehurst
led the attack with another out
standing performance, collecting
12 kills and hitting and outstand
ing .800.
The Card returned briefly to
Burnham to face Ball State, a
team that Stanford beat in rela
tively easy fashion 3-1, fulfilling a
goal by topping all of the MIVA
teams on its schedule. Fuer
bringer led the charge, collecting
24 kills and a career-high 18 digs.
"It was a real nice win for us,"
Fuerbringer said. "We had want
ed to beat all of the Midwest
teams we played."
Follwing Ball State, the team
faced an easy test in Cal State-
Northridge. The Matadors fell in
front of Witt's .577 hitting and 17
kills.
The team hit the road for its
next three matches. Against I C-
Santa Cruz, a nonleague oppo
nent, sophomore setter PK Diff
enbaugh led the way with 40
assists, three digs and two blocks
as Stanford cruised. 1 he Card
continued its roll against Pepper

dine, one of the country's top
teams. Lambert erupted for 36
kills and again carried Stanford
to a 3-1 victory. The squad fin
ished its road trip with an easy
win against UC-Irvine in which
Witt hit .870 and collected 21
kills, leading Stanford to a 3-0
win.
After returning home, Stan
ford welcomed the Rainbows for
two matches. The two teams
squared off in one of the best
matches of the year on the first
night — a five-game thriller that
the home team won. Senior setter
Stewart Chong totaled 109
assists, the third-highest total in
Stanford history. Witt led Stan
ford to a win on the second night,
gaining player of the week honors
in the process.
The roll at Burnham contin
ued, as Stanford finished up the
season at home with straight for
ward wins in 3-0 fashion over Cal
State-San Bernardino, San Diego
State and UC-San Diego. The San
Bernardino match saw sopho
more outside hitter Pat Klein
pick up a season-high seven kills.
Against UC-San Diego senior out
side hitter Aaron Garcia delight
ed the crowd in his last regular
season home match with 12 kills,
four digs, four blocks, three aces
and .417 hitting.
The Card finished up its sea
son on a high note with a 3-1 vic
tory at UOP in which Lambert
led the way with 40 kills.
Stanford began what would be
a remarkable postseason run
with a 3-0 victory over Pepper
dine. Fuerbringer led the way
with 23 kills and .531 hitting.
Stanford relied heavily on Fuer
bringer for the rest of the MPSF
tourney, as he added 17 kills
against BYU and capped off a
week in which he was named

player of the week with a .556
hitting performance at UCLA,
which ended the Bruins four
year stranglehold on the league
title.
After winning the MPSF title,
the Card was ranked No. 1 and
