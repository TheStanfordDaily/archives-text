# Stanford Savoyards perform spring play
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
This week, a story of mystery,
fate, royalty and gondolier life is
unfolding on the Farm. And it
doesn't even involve Chelsea Clin
ton.
Performed by the Stanford
Savoyards, "The Gondoliers" will
show at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
May 9 and 10 and in a matinee per
formance on May 11.
The comedy was written by
Gilbert and Sullivan, whose influ
ence has been instrumental for
the Savoyards. Organized in 1973,
the Savoyards take their name
from the Savoy Theatre in London
built in 1881 specifically for
Gilbert and Sullivan.
The cast and crew of the Savo
yards originally were mostly com
munity members, but today major
roles are played by anyone with
talent — students, faculty and
community dabblers. This pro
duction has cast the voice of Music
Lecturer Claire Giovannetti in a
cameo appearance.
Sophomore Shanee Williams,
who sings the role of Giulia and is
also a member of the chorus, said
students play many of the lead
roles and serve as assistant music,
stage and choreography directors.
"There are an incredible num
ber of students in important jobs,"
she said.
Actor and Savoyard publicity
chair Ed Glazer, a community
member agreed that the opportu
nity for direct student involvement
is what makes the group unique.
The Savoyards "provide out lets
for theater students in directing,
set, lighting and costume design."
he said.

With an equal mix of challeng
ing music and drama, putting to
gether "The Gondoliers" has re
quired rehearsals several days a
week since late January. Cast
members say the work has paid
off.
"The performance level and at
titude are professional," said se
nior Koeun Rha. "I really enjoyed
working with and learning from so
many experienced people."
The Savoyards normally pre
sent only two full Gilbert and Sul
livan works annually. However,
they are currently holding adjunct
rehearsals for additional perfor
mances of "The Zoo," which they
performed in the fall. This time,
they will perform it for the June
International Gilbert and Sulli
van Festival in Berkeley.
"The Gondoliers" perfor
mances are also part of a larger
theatrical event — "Britain Meets
the Bay," a three month festival
celebrating the cultural, political
and economic ties between the
United Kingdom and the Bay
Area.
As for play itself, "the story is a
very comical political satire,"
Glazer said. The penniless Duke
and Duchess characters peddle
themselves and do commercial en
dorsements throughout the play.
Although written in 1889, the sit
uation is reminiscent of a current
duchess, the Duchess of York
Sarah Ferguson, Glazer said, who
is most visible these days as an au
thor of an autobiography and a
spokesperson for Oceanspray
Cranberry Juice.
General admission for the play
is $13, with senior discounts avail
able for $8.50. The performance
opened Friday.
