# Greek housing recommended

Included in the Greek Task
Force's report, which was released
Friday, were recommendations for
group housing eligibility for sorori

campus beginning in the early
years of the University but were
banned from campus in 1944 by
the Board of Trustees. According

sororities were reinstated in 1977,

Asst. Director of the Office of Stu
