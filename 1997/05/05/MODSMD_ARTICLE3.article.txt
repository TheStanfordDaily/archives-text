# Greek housing recommended
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Included in the Greek Task
Force's report, which was released
Friday, were recommendations for
group housing eligibility for sorori
ties and unhoused fraternities,
strengthened relationships be
tween the administration and
Greek organizations and increased
meeting space for Greek and other
student groups.
Currently unhoused Greek or
ganizations will be able to apply for
group housing next year, with the
possibility of housing starting in
the 1997-1998 school year. Priority
will be given to sororities, which
have not had University housing
since the 19405.
However, the task force report
states that "it is neither our inten
tion nor our hope that these recom
mendations result in a significant
expansion in the number of stu
dent residences allocated to Greek

organizations." Rather, the report
states the task force's belief that
expansion should be "rather mod
est."
Housed sororities existed on
campus beginning in the early
years of the University but were
banned from campus in 1944 by
the Board of Trustees. According
to the task force report, female stu
dents requested the ban because of
what they perceived to be the divi
sive nature of sororities. When
sororities were reinstated in 1977,
it was under the condition that
they would be unhoused.
Recently, sorority members and
others have argued that giving fra
ternities housing while denying it
to sororities is unjust.
"For me, one of the most impor
tant goals of the task force was to
establish equity in housing," said
Asst. Director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities Heather Dunn, who
served on the task force.
According to Dunn, housing
sororities will also benefit non-
Greek women, because it will give
women equal opportunity for the
same types of housing as men by
balancing draw numbers. Current
ly, men are favored in the draw over
women because of the spaces left by
men who live in fraternity housing.
Junior Amanda Bardin, a mem
ber of Delta Delta Delta sorority
who served on the task force, said
that she is "pleased to see support
for sorority housing."
"It's about time," she added.
However, Bardin stressed that
she does not anticipate any imme
diate change in University housing.
"Its going to take a lot more
work to turn recommendations
into policy," Bardin said.
Intersorority Council President
Lisa Rubin, who has been one of the
most outspoken advocates for
sorority housing, said she was "ex
tremely pleased" at the task force's

housing recommendation. Howev
er, both she and Bardin stressed
the importance of all of the report's
recommendations.
"Members of the Greek commu
nity must concentrate on the im
portance of the recommendations
as a whole and not just on the bene
fits to individual groups," Rubin
said.
The recommendations, accord
ing to Rubin, will "strengthen and
improve the Greek community."
The task force report also gives
traditionally unhoused fraterni
ties the opportunity to gain hous
ing, previously forbidden by the
University's grandfather clause.
The clause, written in 1977, said
the University would not add any
more housing for fraternities or
sororities but would continue to
provide housing for fraternities
housed at the time the clause was
written.
African-American and Asian-
American fraternities are among
those formed at Stanford after
1977 and previously could not gain
housing because of the clause.
William Lee, president of the
Asian-American fraternity Lamb

da Phi Epsilon, said his fraternity
is "interested" in the prospect of
housing but is not planning to seek
housing in the near future.
"There are mixed feelings
among our members," Lee said.
"Part of our strength as a fraterni
ty lies in the fact that we are un
housed. You can meet other people
yet still build strong ties to the fra
ternity."
Derek Yarbrough, president of
the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity, also said his fraternity
does not plan to seek housing. How
ever, the Sig Eps hope to benefit
from the task force's recommenda
tion for more space for student or
ganizations and are seeking a non
residential lodge to use for meet
ings.
A new committee of staff mem
bers and students will determine
the criteria by which housing deci
sions will be made, oversee the ap
plication process and deter/nine
what housing will be available, ac
cording to Dunn. Dunn said no de
cision has been made yet as to
which houses might become
Greek.
However, the report recom

mends that facilities chosen to
house sororities or fraternities
"should not include currently oc
cupied fraternity, co-op or theme
house programs" unless these pro
grams are "discontinued due to a
lack of student interest."
"We would never displace a suc
cessful program," Dunn said.
Dunn also said at this time the
University has not considered let
ting new houses be built to house
fraternities or sororities.
According to Mary Edmonds,
vice provost for student affairs, it is
now up to members of the Greek
community to organize themselves
to achieve their goals, whether
these goals are to gain meeting
space or housing.
"Now that they have the report,
let's see what the Greeks and stu
dent leadership can accomplish
with this," Edmonds said. "The
task force puts the responsibility on
the Greek system."
"This is a very important first
step," Interfraternity Council
President Brad Rodrigues said.
"We look forward to working with
the University to implement the
task force's recommendations."
