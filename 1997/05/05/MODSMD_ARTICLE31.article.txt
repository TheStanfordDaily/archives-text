### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
The second annual Native American Aware
ness Week, which begins today, will feature not
only celebrations of Native American culture
but also powerful political messages.
Senior Clay Akiwenzie, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organization, said the
goals for the week are to "bring American Indi
ans into the consciousness of people, into the
modern era. The message is that we're still here,
and there are still things we can contribute to a
larger dialogue," he said.
The week will culminate in the annual Stan
ford Powwow — the largest student-run pow
wow in the country — first organized by SAIO in
1971.
1 n addition to various cultural performances,
a number of well-known Native American
speakers will visit campus during the week.
Among these speakers will be Floyd Westerman,
a Native American activist, folk singer and
actor; Victor Masayesva, Jr., a Native American

filmmaker who, according to Akiwenzie, chal
lenges Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of
Native Americans; and stand-up comedian
Charlie Hill, whom Akiwenzie described as a
"political comedian, kind of like Dick Gregory or
Dermis Miller.. .(who isj trying to poke fun at
the way American society views American Indi
ans and vice versa."
"All the people we're bringing here bring a lot
of political awareness to the work they do," Aki
wenzie said.
Sophomore Sarah Schultz, a co-organizer of
Native American Awareness Week, said the
week would give people a "better understanding
of Indian humor.. .why we're always laughing."
"A lot of people don't know anything about
natives," Schultz said. "They know the stereo
types — feathers, dancers. But they don't really
know us as people."
According to senior Elk Glenn, who has just
been elected next year's co-chair of SAIO, "The
point of Native American Awareness Week is
that in 400 years the indigenous people of this
continent were reduced to less than 1 percent of

the population and, until the past 100 years,
were not included in the citizenry.
"We are not recognized much because those
that do remain are few and far between," Glenn
said. "During this coming week people will have
the opportunity to hear about Indians, from In
dians, with Indians."
The week will conclude with the Stanford
Powwow, held in Eucalyptus Grove, featuring
Native American dance, music, food and arts
and crafts. The powwow begins Friday evening
and ends Sunday evening.
Dennie Woodward, acting director of the
American Indians and Alaska Native Program,
said the powwow is "meant to be a more accu
rate Native American presence displaying the
diversity within Indian America."
"It's a very rare opportunity that our Stan
ford Indian community presents for a larger
community at Stanford — it brings hundreds
and hundreds of different Native American
tribes to campus," Woodward said. "I hope peo
ple understand that they're most welcome to
come."
