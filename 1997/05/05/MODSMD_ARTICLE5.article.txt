Four Stanford faculty members were re
cently elected to the prestigious National Acad
emy of Sciences.
These faculty are Richard Tsien, professor
of molecular and cellular physiology; Gerald
Crabtree, associate investigator at the Howard
Hughes Institute and professor of pathology
and developmental biology; David Kreps, pro
fessor of economics; and Robert Metzenberg,
visiting professor of biology.
The academy, a group of accomplished sci
entists and engineers, was established in 1
to honor outstanding original research in the
sciences. Election into the academy is one of
the highest laurels a scientist can receive. Cur
rently, 105 Stanford professors are academy
members, and four additional academy mem
bers are at the Hoover Institution.
Tsien, the current director of the Silvio
Conte-National Institute of Mental Health
Center for Neuroscience Research, was hon
ored for his work on the role of ion channels in
cellular signaling in heart and brain cells. His
ground-breaking studies have contributed to a
greater understanding of how calcium ions
trigger muscle contractions and synaptic

transmission.
The clinical applications of Tsien's research
could affect treatments for hypertension, mi
graines and cerebellar ataxia. Tsien was "very
excited" about his election and called it a "good
housekeeping seal of approval."
Members of the academy usually have a
high profile and are often called on to give sci
entific advice to policy makers, according to
Tsien. Therefore, membership in the academy
"makes it easier for the non-scientist to appre
ciate the work of the scientist," Tsien said.
Tsien is the first member of the of Molecular
and Cellular Physiology Department to be
elected to the academy, but he said, "I am very
confident that in the future there will be many
more elections coming from this department."
Kreps, a well-known economic theorist, has
contributed significantly to the area of dynam
ic choice behavior. In tin; I ( J7os, he added to a
greater understanding of the modeling of com
petitive interactions by i uilding game theory
into microeconomic theory.
Kreps is especially renowned for his contri
butions to noncooperaf ive game theory and for
the notion of sequential equilibrium, which he
developed with fellow colleague and academy
member Robert Wilson. When informed of his
election to the academy, Kreps said he was sim

ply "speechless."
"I used to like to think of myself as young,"
he deadpanned, "hut I guess it's not so any
more." Kreps, who was voted "Teacher of the
Year" hy MBA students in 1991, received both
his master's and doctoral degrees from Stan
ford and joined the faculty in 1975.
Crabtree was honored for his landmark
studies on gene activation / inactivation. Along
with Stuart Schreiher of Harvard University,
he has discovered a way to stimulate cells to
switch genes on and off as needed.
Crabtree's finding has the potential to revo
lutionize the field of gene therapy. At the pre
sent time, tfene therapy involves implanting a
beneficial gene in a patient's cells so the patient
can synthesize proteins needed to combat an
illness. However, hyperactivity of the gene is a
major concern for researchers, and Crabtree's
work centers around this aspect of gene regula
tion.
His novel method of gene control could ulti
mately lead to patients receiving a single pill to
turn on a gene and another to turn it off. Both
Stanford and Harvard have already sold a li
cense for use of this method to Ariad Pharma
ceuticals Inc.
