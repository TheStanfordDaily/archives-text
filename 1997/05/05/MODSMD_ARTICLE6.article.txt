Maybe it's not the festival at Cannes, maybe
it's not topping box office records, but the Inter
national Film Festival at Stanford is thriving in
its first year, according to organizers.
The purpose of the festival is to promote
friendship and cooperation among Stanford stu
dents and between Stanford students and the
surrounding community. The festival attempts
to achieve this through a better understanding
of diverse cultural backgrounds.

"We've had a good mixture of students," said
Hellenic Association President Stavros Kassi
nos, a doctoral student. Kassinos initiated the
festival.
In addition to the 1 lellcnic Association, Bech
tel International Center also worked to organize
the event. Composed of nightly showings and
discussions of acclaimed international films, the
festival began on April 28 and runs until May 16.
The films include, among others, "Farewell
My Concubine" and "Bombay."
"We would like to see students gain a better
appreciation of other cultures," Kassinos said.

About 50 people have attended each film
showing so far, and about five people have
stayed afterward for the discussions, Kassinos
said.
With the prospeet of t he festival outgrowing
the space in which the films are currently
shown, Kassinos hopes to move the festival to a
larger building and, in the vein of Flicks, show
more current films.
"Maybe we can get real movies [and l>e| in
Memorial Auditorium," said Kassinos.
Movies are show nightly at 7:30 at the Rech
tel ('enter.
