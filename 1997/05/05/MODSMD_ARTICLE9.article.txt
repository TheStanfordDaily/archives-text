# Shimmel speaks about Islamic Sufism

### Emily Card 
The phrase "like a moth to a flame" has
found its way into common English language.
But the saying comes from a Sufi poem about a
moth that casts itself into a flame because it
wants to be united with the flame in hopes of
gaining new life from it. The moth's desire to
completely lose itself in a higher object repre
sents, for Sufis, the individual desire to lose the
self in God.
Recently retired Harvard Islamic Studies
Prof. Annemarie Shimmel spoke to a group of
300 people at Annenberg Auditorium yester
day. She discussed Sufism, or Islamic mysti
cism and its impact on European thought and
poetry.
The lecture was sponsored in part by the
Stanford University Islamic Society in hopes of
bringing more academic attention to Islam and
Islamic issues at Stanford. The lecture was at-

tended by Stanford students, community
members and Shimmers colleagues.
Berkeley Near Eastern Studies Prof. Hanid
Algar and Stanford alum Margoub Quraishi in
troduced Shimmel they described the level of
her pursuit of knowledge and affinity for her
work as something to which all academics can
aspire. Shimmel has published more than 70
books on Islamic subjects and continues to re
search and publish in her retirement.
The lecture was attended by Muslims and
non-Muslims alike. Freshman Colin Matheson
attended the event because of personal interest
in Islamic mysticism and was "incredibly im
pressed with her comprehensive knowledge of
Islamic culture over the past thousands of
years."
Coterminal student Imran Maskatia, presi
dent of the Stanford Islamic Society, was
pleased to have the Shimmel as an example of
"the academic study of Islam in Western insti-

tutions, something that has not happened a lot
at Stanford."
As a movement Sufism developed as a reac
tion to dry Islamic legalism and continues to
play a fundamental part in the religious experi
ence of some Muslims who devote themselves
to a lifetime of prayer and closeness to God.
Shimmel cited the Persian myth of Rabia as
the beginning of Sufism. A women, Rabia,
stood with a fire torch in one hand and a pitch
er of water in the other attempting to throw
fire into heaven and water into hell. She hoped
to change the landscape of heaven and hell so
that people would not worship God out of fear
of punishment but out of love. From this,
Shimmel suggests, came Sufism with its ideal
of divine love.
Shimmel described Sufism as quite mysteri
ous and something that many Sufis do not like
to share with those who may misunderstand
and misconstrue their beliefs.
