# Tobacco scores victory
## Jury rules in favor of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 
### 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - A jury
yesterday found R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. not responsible for the death of a life
long smoker, a victory for the industry as
it seeks to settle multibillion-dollar health
claims filed by state governments.
The six-member jury decided that
cigarettes made by RJR were not "unrea
sonably dangerous and defective" and
should not be blamed for the death of Jean
Connor, who testified on videotape that
cigarettes caused her lung cancer.
During the four-week trial, jurors had
viewed riveting videotapes of a dying Mrs.
Connor, weighed dozens of internal docu
ments and heard numerous scientists for
both sides.
Mrs. Connor died in 1995 at the age of
49. The widely watched wrongful-death
case brought by her family was the first
liability test for tobacco companies since
losing a case in August to the same attor
ney. The case was argued while the indus
try was reeling from legal and regulatory
setbacks.
Tobacco stocks, which had been down
before the verdict, quickly regained lost
ground and helped lift the stock market to
a record close yesterday.
In late trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, RJR Nabisco, the parent of
R.J. Reynolds, was up $3.12 1/2 at $32.62
1/2 a share. Earlier yesterday, it had been
as low as $28.37 1/2. Philip Morris Cos.,
the No. 1 cigarette company, was up
$4.25 at $44.12 1/2 after being as low as

$37.87 1/2.
The verdict could help the tobacco
industry in its talks with six state govern
ments over a settlement that could cost as
much as $300 billion. The negotiations
involve the attorneys general of Florida,
Minnesota, Connecticut, Mississippi,
Washington and Arizona.
A settlement would give companies
blanket protection from smoking-related
lawsuits. In return, the companies would
pay into a compensation fund and agree to
cut back on advertising.
"We're disappointed, but we'll be back
in August," said Norwood "Woody"
Wilner, one of the family's attorneys. It
was Wilner who won a $750,000 judgment
against a tobacco company last year and
who is representing another former smok
er who suffers from lung cancer and has
sued RJR.
Paul Crist, an attorney for R.J.
Reynolds, maker of the Winston and
Salem cigarettes Mrs. Connor preferred,
said that the case was about a woman who
knew the risks and chose to smoke any
way.
Mrs. Connor's sister Dana Raulcrson
stared down when the verdict was read.
When asked what went through her mind,
she said sarcastically,- "Honestly, what
went through my mind was how magnifi
cent tlu> tobacco companies are." She said
they kill tens of thousands of people a
year, "and six people can't see that.
They're magnificent."
