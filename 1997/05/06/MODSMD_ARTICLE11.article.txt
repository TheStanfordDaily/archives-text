# Wall Street hits record highs
## Dow Jones breaks 7200 in heavy trading 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial
average completed its speedy recovery yesterday and
soared into the record books with a 143-point surge
that lifted the indicator above 7,200 for the first
time.
The resurgent technology sector roared as well,
catapulting the Nasdaq market to its second
straight gain of more than 2.5 percent. The late rally
also lilted the Standard & Poor's 500 to its first new
high since February.
The Dow, which traded fairly fiat until the final
hour, rose 143.29 to 7,214.49. It was the fourth
biggest point gain ever and its first close above both
7,100 and 7,200.
"We're in a panic melt-up. If you don't own stocks
big or small — you're scrambling to get in," said
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime
Charter. "Nothing happened at 2:50 p.m. It was,
'You must be in it to win it.' "
The rally punctuated a surprisingly quick
rebound from a bruising spring selloff that had been
expected to temper investor enthusiasm for months.
But in just over three weeks, the Dow has risen
more than 820 points from the depths of a nearly
700-point plunge that followed its last record high,
set March 11 at 7,085.16.
The Dow's late surge was led by Philip Morris,
which jumped 4 1/4 to 44 1/8 on news that rival

cigarette maker RJR Nabisco had prevailed against
a smoker liability suit in Florida. RJR rose 3 1/8 to
32 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Other big Dow gainers included IBM, which rose
4 to 166 1/8; and General Electric, up 3 3/8 to 116
1/2.
There were no major economic reports to bolster
or dampen last week's sudden enthusiasm that a
previously dire outlook for inflation and interest
rates had improved.
In late March, the Federal Reserve moved to con
tain inflationary pressures by raising one of its key
lending rates, spurring the steep market downturn.
Investors, hopeful that the central bank won't
raise interest rates enough to muzzle consumer
spending and company profits, were heartened last
week to see that two key indicators on employment
costs — a leading force behind inflation — have
remained tame.
"The only question is what the Fed's going to do
(at its May 20 policy meeting), but the market's say
ing it doesn't matter," said Bleir.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by near
ly a 3-to-l margin on the New York Stock Exchange,
where volume was heavy at 549.40 million shares as
of 4 p.m.,
Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index rose 2.1 per
cent.
