FORT DAVIS, Texas (AP) - A fugitive
member of the Republic of Texas was killed
yesterday in a gunbattle with police who
had been tracking him since he fled the
secessionist group's hideout.
A second man remained at large in the
rugged Davis Mountains, where the two had
headed separately before the rest of the mil
itant group laid down their arms over the
weekend.
The group's leader and several other peo
ple were named yesterday in a federal fraud
indictment.
The gunfire took place at a bunker about
a mile from the group's "embassy" head
quarters in a sparse mountain development,
state officials said.

The dead man had apparently been
shooting at police tracking dogs and a heli
copter tiiat were searching for the pair, said
Sherri Deatherage Green, a spokeswoman
for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
"Shots were fired from the helicopter and
from the ground at the suspect," she said.
The dead man's name was not immedi
ately known. The two men being sought
were identified as Richard Keyes 111, 21, and
Mike Matson, 48.
Of the two, only Keyes was charged with
a crime. He was accused of organized crimi
nal activity and kidnapping related to an
April 27 hostage-taking that started the
group's seven-day standoff, which ended
peacefully Saturday.

Earlier yesterday, two of the dogs
unleashed to track the two fugitives were
shot. Both were taken to a veterinarian; one
was wounded in the chest, the other in the
leg, Green said.
The Republic of Texas, which has split
into three factions, believes the formerly
independent .state was illegally annexed by
the United States in 1845.
After Saturday's surrender, Richard
McLaren, leader of the faction involved in
the standoff, was held without bail in the
Presidio County Jail in Marfa, about 20
miles to the south, and three others were
held in lieu of $500,000 bail each. All faced
charges of organized criminal activity.
On yesterday, a federal fraud and con

spiracy indictment unsealed in Dallas
accused McLaren, hLs wife, Evelyn and five
other people of Issuing more than $1.8 bil
lion in bogus Republic of Texas financial doc
uments or "warrants" and using them to
pay legitimate bills and to open bank
accounts.
Actual losses were estimated in the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. "But we don't
know where all the monies went," said U.S.
Attorney Paul Coggins.
Coggins said the warrants, which look
like cashier's checks, were redeemed for
receipts.
"Creditors who complained about having
received a worthless warrant and then get
ting a worthless receipt on top of that wen*

threatened with so-called 'marks of
reprisals' by the defendants," (Joggins said,
adding he didn't know what the reprisals
would be.
Cogens called them "p;i[xT terrorists.
They're not revolutionaries, but ripoff
artists. They're not patriots, but parasites.
In short, they're bullies."
No court date was set for McLaren. Mrs.
McLaren appeared before a magistrate yes
terday in Alpine, 20 miles southeast of Fort
Davis.
If convicted of the various federal
charges, Mcl-iren faces a maximum of 725
years in prison and fines totaling $24.25 mil
lion. Mrs. Mcl-iren faces up to 155 years in
prison and fines totalingss.2 million.
