SEAS must concentrate
its efforts on problems in
Stanford's own backyard

GROUPS LIKE Students for
Environmental Action at
Stanford exist to remind
the Stanford community that the
real world hovers directly beyond
the safe confines of Campus Drive.
When members of SEAS protest
corporate involvement in Burma
by demonstrating at Arco stations,
they recognize that American
investors shoulder some of the
blame for continued human rights
abuses there. Protests aimed at
Nike CEO Philip Knight remind
consumers that their own money
is also partly responsible for the
reign of dictators in Burma.
But while Burma deserves atten
tion, is it really necessary to look all
the way to another country to find a
situation that demands attention
and action? The question of local
significance is one that is of impor
tance not only to SEAS but also to
the entire Stanford community
because SEAS depends on students
for its funding.
The SEAS handbook statement
declares itself a group dedicated to
"service, education and action
addressing environmental issues."
If Stanford students fund SEAS,
however, it makes sense that at
least part of the group's efforts
should be directed at education for
the Stanford community and action
on issues that are tangible for mem
bers of that community. Last quar
ter's Human Biology class on Cor
porate Responsibility in the Local
and Global Environment, which
was developed through the initia
tive of individuals within SEAS, is a
major step in exposing students to
large-scale issues of ethics and cor
porate policy.
But SEAS's emphasis on action
involving corporations seems to
ignore smaller-scale issues that

also deserve attention. If SEAS
wants to stop corporations from
abusing the land and the people
who live on it, the group need not
look farther than its own figura
tive backyard in order to take
action. The presence of toxic waste
sites in East Palo Alto, for
instance, is a problem that is rele
vant to Stanford residents. There
are immediate health threats
posed by these sites which have
the potential to directly affect res
idents via ground water and runoff
contamination.
Of course, any action is better
than nothing at all. At least the
members of SEAS care enough to
attempt to remedy some problems
in the first place. But this is part of
the difficulty of maintaining stu
dent interest in public service: ini
tial enthusiasm is incredibly diffi
cult to transform into a sustained
effort directed at long-term solu
tions.
It is significant that a project
like the organic farm, which was
developed and implemented by
SEAS members, has been recently
neglected. But crafting a success
ful campaign based on proactive
development and awareness is dif
ficult enough on a local scale. If
SEAS wants Stanford students to
allocate their money for its
actions, it needs to prove to stu
dents that their money is benefit
ing the Stanford community in a
tangible way.
Awareness is a fickle thing;
while protests may benefit suffer
ing people in another country, it is
easier to convince the average stu
dent that his or her money is well
spent if SEAS can prove that its
actions affect his or her life in
some way.
If SEAS wants to continue its
existence as a group that succeeds
in defending the environment and
all of its inhabitants, its collective
effort would be better directed at
issues that are visible and impor
tant, not only to its members but
also to the community which it
seeks to educate.
