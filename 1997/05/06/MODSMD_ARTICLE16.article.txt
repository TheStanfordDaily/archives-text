Hearing Commission's mistakes necessitate senate action

FAR FROM CLOSING the issue of
ASSU election improprieties as
The Daily thinks it has, I believe
that the ASSU Hearings Committee's
decision on Saturday requires the ASSU
Senate to conduct its own investigation
into campaign finance violations and to
consider whether the Hearings Officer
and hearings committee are guilty of
misconduct or worse.
First, hearings are closed, and only
the accused candidates, the members of
the bearings committee and the hear
ings officer should be in attendance. The
ASSU By-Laws do allow a secretary to
bo present for the purposes of keeping a
transcript. However, Elections Commis
sioner Ghazal Badiozamani was present,
supposedly in an "advisory capacity."
This action was clearly illegal and seems
to indicate that the elections commis-

sioner is trying to influence the hearings
committee.
Second, based on the "transcript"
that was released, the hearings officer
has failed to do any investigation of the
issues, apart from questioning Presi
dent-elect Emily Andrus and Vice Presi
dent-elect Ben Decker. It would make
sense for the hearings officer to find
out what the fair market value of the
publicity at issue is.
Third, in the "transcript" released
Saturday, on several occasions, the hear
ings committee admits that the expenses
declared by Andrus and Decker were low
and should probably be higher. Howev
er, they conclude that the magnitude of
any violations does not warrant disquali
fication or any other penalties. Before
they can decide the over-spending is
insignificant, they must calculate what

the over-spending is.
I believe it is the senate's duty to
question all those involved in this case to
try to determine whether campaign
finance rules were violated, and whether
election officials have discharged their
duties legally and successfully. When the
senate looks at the allegations and facts
surrounding campaign finances, I
believe the only reasonable conclusion
they can reach is that Andrus and Deck
er spent significantly in excess of $300
on their election campaign, and that
they lied to the hearings officer in an
effort to protect themselves. It is clear
that the elections commissioner and the
hearings officer have been unable and
unwilling to follow the rules dictated in
the by-laws, and they should be dis
missed so that new elections can be held
with a competent and unbiased election

staff.
I think it is interesting to examine
the role The Stanford Daily has played
in this matter. Not a single news article
has appeared regarding any of the
alleged election problems, including the
Oxford foul-up, and the latest campaign
finance allegations.
Yet The Daily has written two editori
als urging the senate to ignore the prob
lems of validation and certification. I
have come to seriously question The
Daily's integrity and have realized how
sorely this campus needs another news
publication to keep The Daily honest.
Kudos goes to The Stanford Review,
which I usually abhor, for providing full
coverage of the problems with the elec
tion.
