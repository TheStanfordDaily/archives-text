# Examine tenure process before criticizing outcomes
## 
### 
I was disturbed at allegations made in
Monday's Daily relevant to the decision to
donv tenure to Asst. History Prof. Karen
Sawislak. I am not intending to defend
the School of Humanities and Sciences'
deans' committee on their decision; I
don't know Prof. Sawislak or her work
and am not in any way able to judge her
contributions to the school or her field. By
the same token, the "coalition of roughly
60 students" who authored the letter do
know the tenure process in any detail,
i don't think it's presumptuous of me to
)-,\y that probably none of those students
4ias ever been involved on a tenure com
jnittee.
; The process is complex, yet rather
•than try to understand in what areas the
jeans' committee found Sawislak lack
ing, this group of students chose instead
jto charge Stanford with institutional

racism and sexism in its tenure deci
sions. This charge not only shows an
incredible amount of arrogance in this
group's simplistic presumptions but is
also irresponsible in that these charges
are being made before the process has
come to a conclusion.
It was interesting to note that on the
same day The Daily ran an article about
the ongoing tenure process of Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta. As these
two processes progress, maybe we will
find that mistakes were made, and one or
both may ultimately be granted tenure.
In the meantime, student supporters
should do everything in their power to
communicate the strengths of these two
professors. They should not, however,
instantly "cry wolf" of bigotry; this
charge undermines their collective efforts
and diminishes the significance of inci
dence which clearK do involve bias and
intolerance.
