# Lack of tenured Republicans demands attention
## 
### 
With all the attention focused on the
paucity of women and minorities among
Stanford's tenured professors, spurred
largely by the denials of tenure to Asst.
History Prof. Karen Sawislak and the
beloved Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta, we have neglected to discuss one
minority that is practically non-existent
among Stanford professors: registered
Republicans.
A 1995 study found that more than
80 percent of registered voters of Stan
ford faculty is Democrat. Mainstream
departments in the School of Humani
ties and Social Sciences are particularly
lopsided. There are no registered
Republicans in the African and Afro-
American Studies, Feminist Studies or
Psychology Departments. Democrats
outnumber Republicans by overwhelm
ing margins in the Sociology, English,

History and Political Science Depart
ments. Alas, not a single department at
Stanford boasts a majority of Republi
cans, or even a semblance of an even
division into the two major competing
parties.
Certainly pa ty affiliation is no sure
indicator of political ideology, but it is
a highly correlative one. And the polit
ical hegemony suggested by the huge
political imbalance among Stanford
faculty has grave consequences. A uni
form establishment can hardly sustain
the breadth and battle of ideas that a
university needs to thrive and that
students need to receive proper, bal
anced educations. Intellectual life suf
focates.
It is time for Stanford to grapple
with the question of whether the polit
ical lopsidedness of its faculty came
about through mere chance, or
whether some kind of discrimination is
at work.
