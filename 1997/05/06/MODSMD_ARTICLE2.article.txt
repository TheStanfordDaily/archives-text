# Certification debate set
## Presidential campaign finance questions linger 
### Elise Lipkowitz Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Three weeks after Stanford students
went to the polls, the Associated Students of
Stanford University Senate will vote
tonight on whether or not toaccept the re
sults of one of the most controversial elec
tions in recent memory.
The election, which was validated after
much debate two weeks ago, will face the
final hurdle of certification tonight. If the
election is certified, the senate will give its
official approval to the conduct of the Presi
dential candidates and pave the way for the
installation of Emily Andrus and Ben Deck
er at the helm of the ASSU.
Tonight's debate is expected to focus
around allegations of campaign funding vio
lations by Andrus and Decker. In the wake
of validation two weeks ago, two complaints
were filed stating that the candidates had
likely exceeded the $300.00 campaign
spending limit.
In spite of a ruling over the weekend by
the ASSU Hearings Committee stating that
"not enough evidence of wrongdoing was
presented against the Andrus/Decker slate
to merit disqualification or other penalties,"
questions linger in the minds of several out
spoken campus leaders.
Allegations
The initial complaint against Andrus and
Decker was filed by ASSU Senator Gil Ser
rano. Having been approached by several
other people who indicated that it seemed
unlikely that the ticket's professional look
ing flyers could have been created within the
allotted budget, Serrano initiated the
process that led to the hearings.
Particularly, debate focused on a $200 re
ceipt from Kinko's in Salt Lake City, Utah
where most of the Andrus/Decker campaign
materials were created. Questions were also
initially raised as to whether their campaign
banners were professionally made and as to
whether the campaign had access to tech
nology that was unavailable to the general
public.
Constitutional Council Member Nawwar
Kasrawi, who also filed a complaint, stated
the crux of the issue.
"The main issues as far as possible cam
paign finance violations are the issues of
what was produced and the issue of fair mar
ket value; what it would cost a person with
no special access to pay," Kasrawi said.
Presidential candidate Jim Finsten, al
though he did not file allegations, has been a
driving force in pushing for further investi
gation of Andrus/Decker campaign prac
tices.
Allegations of special access focused on
possible connections Andrus' mother, a

graphic artist, many have had to printing
companies and the use of a special hi-tech
printer.
"Everyone thinks we got some big de
signer," stated Andrus, "but all we did was
use Quark Express. Anyone could have cre
ated our posters."
Andrus further noted that "Ben and I put
a lot of hard work into our campaign.
Through many hours of labor . jid resource
ful strategies, we were able to make our
$300 limit go a long way. All of the opportu
nities that we took advantage of were readi
ly available to the general public â€” our
strength was searching out the lowest prices
and doing as much as possible ourselves. A
lot of planning, energy, time and hard work
can result in a professional-looking cam
paign on a shoe-string budget."
Deliberations
Senior Nima Earzan, who headed the
hearings committee, explained that Andrus
and Decker were able to go through each of
the claims and demonstrate that there had
been no violations.
"Some of the points Gil brought up were
a total miscommunication. The banner was
made of pieces of canvas stapled together
and they had a letter from the place where
they purchased it stating that it was made
from scraps of material." stated Farzan.
"When you look closely at the banner it is
obvious that it isn't professionally made,"
added Elections Commissioner Ghazal Ba
diozamani.
Andrus explained to the committee that
she had $200.00 worth of Ilx 17 flyers print
ed on a spot color photocopier at the Kinko's
in Salt Lake City. "I told them what our
spending limit was and asked them to print
as many as they could. It came out to
around 1200 copies," Andrus said.
All of the smaller flyers were cut out from
the 11x17 paper. A letter was also produced
from Dave Thomas, the General Manager of
the Kinko's in Salt Lake City stating "The
$200 total is a fair market value for the work
produced and did include tax."
When asked whether the elections com
mittee ever attempted to do its own research
on what the actual cost of the corpus of fly
ers might have been, Farzan replied that the
committee "based its decision on the letter
from Kinko's and from Farzan's previous
experiences with color copying."
"If there was anything we should have
done research on, it was on the five or six
large sheets with the photographs because
we didn't know how much they cost,"
Farzan said.
He quickly tempered the remark, noting
that the cost of those few sheets would not
have merited disqualification.
