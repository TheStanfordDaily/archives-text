## Jumping into the volcano 
### 
"The world is asleep; people you know,
people you see, people you talk to. Only a
few people are truly awake, and they live
in a state of constant and total amaze
ment. "
— Meg Ryan, "Joe Versus the Volcano"
THE FUTURE. WE always seem to
focus on the future. It's easy to do
really. Stanford gives us a recipe
for our forward thinking: take a bowl of
achievement, aged over 18 years, add an
inch of inspiration, a dash of dedication
and a promise of oncoming power, money
and security and voila! We have a meal to
sustain us through four years of
academia.
That was me not so long ago. Stanford
was a means to an end, and I would glafl-*
ly throw myself into physics midterms
and pointless political science essays. I
did not seek the Holy Grail of knowledge;
I just cared about the grade, the connec
tion, the network, the job.
Not anymore, though. With the help
of a dishwater-blonde, freckly-faced pixie
named Erin, I have learned the sublime
strength of forgetting my responsibilities
and foregoing my ten-year plan so that I
might live.
I laugh at the premeds, endlessly
memorizing and cursing their fate. I scoff
at the aspiring consultants, just dying for
their chance to trade in 80-hour weeks
for fifty thousand dollars and a chance to
climb the stairway to corporate heaven.

Ha! Not me, man! I don't have to sac
rifice anything. I can just do whatever
makes me happy and avoid that rat race
to some nebulous block of cheese that
with every year of unfulfilling work,
molds and deteriorates. I know the truth,
don't I? Right!?
But I've got a problem. See, I can laugh
at all of the pre-professionals on this cam
pus, but the truth is, they have something
I don't. They have commitment.
The day will come when that stressed
out premed whom I mock will finish her
many years of medical school. She will
finally be a doctor. And, at that moment
when she takes her diploma and dons her
scrubs, I bet that you will be able to look
her in the eyes and see the achievement
of a fifkeerr-year dream wash over her. As
hard as it is for me to imagine, perhaps
all those years of sacrifice are validated
by that split second feeling of knowing
that you have reached your goals.
As for me, I'm an academic nomad. I
move in a three-month cycle, always dis
covering a new oasis and tiring of it by
the end of the quarter. I have visited the
world of environmental research, wan
dered through the den of politics and pol
icy, stopped briefly in the arena of law,
and now I travel to a republic of
entrepreneurship and energy efficiency.
Maybe it'll be different this time.
Maybe this time next year, I'll still be
moved by the thought of building low
income housing in India. Why not? It's

the stuff of which dreams are made. It's
exactly what I want. . .right now.
But what if it's not really different?
What if I never break the cycle of interest
and disinterest, inspiration and ennui?
What if, in my quest to live, to be
"amazed," I never commit to anything
and forget what it's like to want some
thing so bad that you work for years to
achieve it? Call me melodramatic, but
I'm scared.
I am in danger of becoming a dilet
tante, and that is a fate no better than
that of a consultant.
Joe, protagonist of "Joe Versus the
Volcano," forsook a nine-to-five life of
misery to jump into a volcano and save an
island of Hebrew Polynesians. I cannot
aspire to such greatness.
But I can find a movement, or a
belief, or a person to which I can dedi
cate my life. Perhaps then I will find a
way to live in the present tense while
working toward a grand vision. Maybe I
will feel more secure, less selfish and be
inspired again. And maybe I will be able
to live in a state of constant and total
amazement.

doubt that "Joe Versus the Volcano" is a
philosophical work of art.
