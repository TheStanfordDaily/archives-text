# Jim Tankersley: Right in the Center
## A 						fresh perspective on a problematic relationship 
### 
Sometimes, it's nice to get a fresh per
spective. Yesterday was The Daily's
1997 New Staffers' Night, which is
billed by staffers as a chance for the rook
ies — reporters with less than a year of
Daily experience — to try out various
high-ranking jobs at the paper while
attempting to produce a finished product
sometime before 3 a.m. The real joy of
New Staffers' Night, though, is felt by
Daily veterans, who love the opportunity
to 1) take the day ofT and 2) promptly give
up that day off by spending all their time
trying to sabotage the new staffers.
Even though I joined The Daily only
eight months ago, I somehow ended up
with two jobs on New Staffers' Night, tak
ing over both Elizabeth Goldman's Editor
in-chief position and this space, the nor
mal home of Jesse Oxfeld's column. The
former was its own punishment. The lat
ter, I knew, would be an especially difficult
task, especially since my best friends don't
hold political positions, I am not a regis
tered member of the National Organiza
tion of Women and I don't claim to be able
to advise Gerhard Casper on the proper
way to run a university.

What I do claim is a fresh voice. As
someone relatively new to The Daily and
to Stanford, I think I bring a unique per
spective on how the newspaper and the
University should coexist.
It is important to frequently question
the relationship between Stanford and its
main news source. Often, an institution
operates unchallenged for so long that it
loses a bit of its focus. Such is the case
with The Daily and its relative campus
news monopoly.
The Daily covers many issues that,
though important, would not otherwise be
reported. The newspaper truly serves the
University community by informing it of
campus events, reporting on administra
tive policy debates and decisions, giving in
depth coverage to school athletics and
reporting the actions of community mem
bers. This role — as a sort of campus bul
letin board — is vital to the health of the
University.
The role is also dangerous, especially
when the bulletin board becomes a politi
cal signpost. When a newspaper moves
beyond simply reporting events and starts
engaging in political discussion, a news

monopoly can quickly turn from advan
tage into handicap.
The affairs of the Associated Students
of Stanford University provide a prime
example. With no other paper covering
campus politics on a day-to-day basis, The
Daily has the sole responsibility for giving
a comprehensive view on both the policies
and the politics of the ASSU Senate. This
implies a very proactive form of journal
ism, one where thoroughness is often sac
rificed to speed. Often, a story is run pre
maturely, and occasionally that means
that it goes to press missing key facts.
From the opposite standpoint, waiting
too long to run a story brings about allega
tions of news withholding. This makes the
ethical decision of "What is news?" espe
cially difficult. If students are talking
about an issue, they expect to see it in the
paper. Popularity, though, is not enough
to get a story printed — if the issue does
not meet the qualifications of being
"newsworthy," usually because it is rooted
not in fact, but in rumor, it may very well
be left out of the paper.
The result is a quagmire that makes
the timing of a story just as important as

its content. Compounding the problem is
the constantly blurred line between the
news and editorial departments of The
Daily. As much as we purport to be an
unbiased publication that separates its
opinions from its objective news coverage,
public perception usually groups the two
components together. The belief that edi
tors filter the news in order to serve their
own editorial purposes, no matter how
unfounded, only makes the job more diffi
cult.
Because of this, one small misperception
or mistake in the eyes of the readers can
start a chain reaction that moves news cov
erage from being proactive to being reac
tive. Running or holding stories based on
the fear of political backlash is dangerous.
Fundamentally, of course, readers'
opinions have a stake in what is classified
as "news." But that stake should not be
exaggerated. One of the prime duties of a
newspaper is to collect facts on both sides
on an issue and report the full story. If the
public is better informed than the newspa
per, then the paper is not doing its job. But
if the situation is reversed, which is usual
ly the case, then it follows that the more

informed party is in a hotter position to
pass final judgment on timing and rover
age. Aiui with that decision coniv large
amounts of both power and responsibility.
I suggest that the readers of The Stan
ford Daily check the power of the news
monopoly by holding their publication to
these three tenets: The paper should be
factual. It should be objective. And it
should be consistent in its coverage. Of
course, The Daily, just like any other
paper in the world, will frequently trip
over one of the three guiding principles.
We're all humans here (unlikely as that
may seem), and we shouldn't go a day
without taking a little time to look at our
selves and laugh.
Being a journalist is about more than
just reporting and writing the news. It's
about making tough wills on a daily basis,
and making them correctly.
