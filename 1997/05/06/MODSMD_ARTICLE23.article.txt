## No.3 Card faces Spartan sluggers 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
Preparing for their final Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division series at
UCLA this weekend, the No. 3 Cardinal
(37-13, 20-7 Six-Pac) will battle the San
Jose State Spartans (37-19, 20-10 West
ern Athletic Conference) at Municipal
Stadium in San Jose.
When the two teams first met on April
15, Stanford won 12-6. The victory put
Stanford back on track after being swept
at home by Arizona State the previous
weekend.
The situation is different this time
around. The Cardinal is on a hot streak
after sweeping the University of Arizona
this weekend in impressive fashion. San
Jose is the final opponent before the
Card departs for the Six-Pac season
finale at UCLA this weekend. The team
is sitting on a three-game lead over the
Bruins, and one win at Jackie Robinson
Stadium will give Stanford the Six-Pac
title.
Though Stanford is gearing up for
UCLA, it is not looking past San Jose.
The Spartans are winning their section
of the Western Athletic Conference and
are vying for a postseason appearance of
their own. A victory over the No. 3 team
in the nation could only help the Spartan
cause.

Leading San Jose's charge is senior
first baseman Robert Burns. Burns has a
team-leading .414 batting average, as
well as 14 home runs and 60 RBIs. As a
team, the Spartans are batting .303. The
solid pitching staff posts a 4.08 ERA.
"They have good pitching and solid
defense," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "Bob Burns is really good."
Coach Marquess' appraisal of the
Spartans holds equally true for the Car
dinal itself. The Card is the best defen
sive team in the Six-Pac, committing 23
fewer errors than any other Six-Pac
team going into this weekend. Offensive
ly, the Card as a team is batting .344,
with all starters hitting above .300.
Catching fire at just the right time is
junior catcher John Schaeffer. In the
last eight games, he has hit eight home
runs, giving him an unbelievable 1.375
slugging percentage and raising his bat
ting average to .531. Schaeffer also leads
the team with 62 RBIs.
The squad's freshmen have also made
huge contributions this season. Fresh
man right fielder Edmund Muth leads
the team with a .401 batting average
while freshman designated hitter John
Gall has a team-best 75 hits.
Taking the mound against San Jose
State will most likely be junior lefty Josh
Koons (4-2, 3.77 ERA), who hasn't
pitched since last Tuesday.
