# Golf half through
## Two rounds over, golfers sit in sixth 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
After the first two rounds of the
Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship, the Stanford men's golf
team sits back in sixth place, but
far from out of contention.
The Cardinal kicked off play
yesterday with an opening-round
2-over-par 362. The second 18
yielded another solid performance,
as the squad finished the day with
a 6-over-par 366. The team's first
day total of 728 left it out of the top
half of the field, but still within
striking distance, only six strokes
off of the lead.
"Six strokes sounds like a lot,
but it's nothing," said freshman
Dusty Brett. "We've only played
two of four rounds. There's still a
long way to go.
"I'm not making any predic
tions or anything, but we could
conceivably be in the lead after
tomorrow. That's how close this
thing is," Brett added.
Brett's caution is well founded,
as the Pac-10 boasts an extremely
competitive field this year. Three
squads find themselves in the
Rolex Top 10. USC, which won
last weekend at the Stanford-host
ed U.S. Intercollegiate, has been
strong and is looking stronger,
climbing into the No. 5 spot overall
and striking many as a national

championship contender. Perenni
al powerhouse Arizona State sits
just one spot back at No. 6, two
spots ahead of desert rival Ari
zona. Four other teams, Washing
ton, Oregon, Oregon State, and
UCLA, are ranked in the top 45.
And although the Cardinal is
not among the favored programs,
the squad doesn't plan on shying
away from anyone.
"We came out and had a decent
start, with a pair of scores in the
605," Brett said. "We need to step
it up collectively as a team if we
want to be competitive and we def
initely want to make a run at it."
"The Pac-lOs are more of a
pride thing than anything else," he
said.
Individually, senior Conrad Ray
continued his hot streak, following
up last week's stellar finish here
on the Farm with a first-day 141
(70-71). Sophomore Joel Kribel
trails by just one stroke at a 2-
under 142. Brett charged out of
the gate with a 69, before cooling
off in the second round and notch
ing a 75. Freshman Michael
Weimer, sophomore Scott Wang,
and senior Pete Ligotti also
chipped in solid rounds for the
Card.
The final two rounds will be
played today and tomorrow at the
Eugene Country Club in Eugene,
Ore.
