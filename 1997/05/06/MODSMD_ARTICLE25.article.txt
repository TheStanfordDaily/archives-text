# Cardinal rowers fall to Berkeley varsity
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
After Cal's decision to move
the Big Row to better racing con
ditions on Stanford's home
course in Redwood City, Calif.
Stanford's rowers realized that
this weekend would be the last

time they would pass under "the
bridge" at Redwood Shores.
"This is a great place to watch
a crew row," said Cal varsity
head coach Steve Gladstone.
"When you are at the bridge you
can actually see what they are
doing in a race circumstance."
Gladstone had the opportuni

ty to see his crews take the rival
ry home with a sweep on the
men's side and three more victo
ries on the women's side, leaving
one Cardinal victory for the
junior varsity squad.
After a solid season best per
formance by the women's junior
varsity boat, senior Anne Dubin
sky was pleased to beat the rival
Bears in her last row at home.
"We were really psyched that
we beat Cal," Dubinsky said.
"We had a really steady and con
sistent race and the best time of
our season [6:48J."
Despite the loss to Cal, novice
women's captain Vandy John
son, a junior, was also very excit
ed about her dual showdown
against the Bears since her boat
narrowed Cal's victory margin
to only 4 seconds.
"Our boat finally figured out
what it feels like to click. It felt
good," Johnson said. "Now we
can really improve in the next
two weeks to come back and beat
crews such as Davis and OSU
that barely nipped us at the fin
ish line this year."
With the loss against the
Bears, the varsity squad closed
their season with a Pacific 10
Conference dual meet record of
5-2.
On the men's side, many of
the varsity members were disap
pointed with their performances

this weekend. They also finished
the dual meet season with a 5-2
record.
"We lost by 10 seconds, and
we were hoping to do a little bet
ter than that this weekend
against Cal," said senior varsity
captain Matt Miller.
However, Miller is still hope
ful that his squad will come
through in the Pac-10 champi
onships, since "traditionally,
Stanford crews have made up a
lot of time between the last dual
meet and Pac-10's and it's shap
ing up to happen this year as
well," Miller said.
The junior varsity and novice
squads also handed their tanks
to the rival Bears after losses of
20 seconds and 16 seconds,
respectively.
"We were excited, but it just
didn't click," said freshman
novice rower Michael Vortmann.
On the rival side, Gladstone
was very pleased with his crews'
fast performances this weekend.
"We are making continuing
progress in boat speed and I am
very pleased," Gladstone said.
Senior Cal varsity captain
Scott Kaslusky also enjoyed win
ning against the rival Cardinal.
"It is always good to sweep
the neighborhood rivals. It's
good for morale," said Kaslusky.

Women rowers pull for the line in Saturday's Big Row against
Berkeley at Redwood Shores.
"The crews looked very sharp
today."
The Cardinal squad is now
preparing to face the Bears and
other Pac-10 opponents in the

conference championship on
May 18th on Lake Natoma in
Sacramento. The top two crews
will be awarded the honor of
moving on to nationals.
"These next few weeks of
practice are going to be pretty
intense," Vortmann said. "I
think by Pac-lOs we'll be able to
give Cal a run for its money."
