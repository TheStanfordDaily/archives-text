# Rugby takes third
## Women beat bigger Seminoles, take consolation at Penn State 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Returning to the Final Four
after last year's absence, the
women's rugby team triumphed
over Florida State, 20-0, in the
consolation match on Sunday to
clinch third place in the Plate
Division.
Junior Suzie Hoffman had
three tries to lead the women
past the Seminoles. Freshman
Karina Celaya added the final
five points with her try.
"We were just a faster team,"
Hoffman said. "We had more
control over the 112, r Jime and what
was going on. We got the ball out
faster and that allowed us to do
good things."
The Cardinal's high-paced
game proved to be too much for
Florida State to handle. The
team was able to outrun the
Seminoles and circumvent the
defense.
The hackline easily moved the
ball past the Florida State
defenders, keeping the Semi
noles from t;iking advantage of
their larger size.
Aggressive play by the
defense allowed the team to hold
Florida State scoreless. Good
tackling and constant pressure
on the; Seminoles whenever they
touched the ball kept them from
being able to break through the
lines.

"Our tackling was pretty
good," said senior captain
Megan Himan. "Our recupera
tion of the ball was excellent.
[Sophomore) Lara Strauss in
particular did a good job with
that."
Because of their strong play,
both Himan and Hoffman were
given All American honors.
"I'm pretty honored," Hoff
man said. "It's a really cool
thing to have awarded to you.
We worked hard all year and it's
nice to be recognized like this."
The women missed a berth in
the national championship game
against Virginia Tech with a
close 20-15 loss to Marquette in
their semifinal match on Satur
day.
"[The match against Mar
quettej was definitely frustrat
ing," Hoffman said. "They had a
style of play that we were not
prepared for. I think we wanted
to do a little better, but overall it
was a good way to end the sea
son."
Senior captain Himan scored
one try for the women, as did
Strauss. Hoffman added another
five points with one conversion
kick and one penalty kick.
"What really hurt us was that
they were a physically stronger
team. Their strategy was to tie
up the hall in a maul and push it
