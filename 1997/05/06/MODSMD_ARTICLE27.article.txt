# Fair-weather fans: No room on wagon

My team is out of the play
offs and I'm a little bummed.
The Detroit Pistons, at one
point in the season second
only to the mighty, mighty
Bulls, are now relegated to a
front row seat watching the

rest of what should have been
their destiny unfolding on
NBC.
My team. All mine and no
one else's.
Forgive me for being a little
posessive. No doubt there are
hundreds of thousands of bas
ketball crazies out there who
call themselves Pistons fans,
but I don't really acknowledge
them. Whether it's because of
GQ-smooth small forward

Grant Hill or the spiffed-up
teal (yikes!) uniform, the Pis
tons are a hot item right now.
A couple of years ago, I could
buy a Pistons cap for a buck
out of the Foot Locker bargain
bin. Now, the gear worn by
Grant and Co. ranks among
the most popular in the NBA.
People are getting all sorts of
nasty injuries trying to jump
onto the Motown bandwagon.
I've been a fan for 1 1 years,
since the last time a young
Pistons team wa.s getting beat
en in the first round of the
playoffs. Of course, back then,
the young hotshot on the
squad was Isiah Thomas. He
actually owns the Toronto
Raptors now, which should
give you an idea of just how
long ago this was. I've seen my
team through a pair of cham
pionships and some hideously
bad seasons since then. I have
no doubts about my alle
giances.
I guess most fans would say
the same about their own
