# Fair-weather fans: No room on wagon
## 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
My team is out of the play
offs and I'm a little bummed.
The Detroit Pistons, at one
point in the season second
only to the mighty, mighty
Bulls, are now relegated to a
front row seat watching the

rest of what should have been
their destiny unfolding on
NBC.
My team. All mine and no
one else's.
Forgive me for being a little
posessive. No doubt there are
hundreds of thousands of bas
ketball crazies out there who
call themselves Pistons fans,
but I don't really acknowledge
them. Whether it's because of
GQ-smooth small forward

Grant Hill or the spiffed-up
teal (yikes!) uniform, the Pis
tons are a hot item right now.
A couple of years ago, I could
buy a Pistons cap for a buck
out of the Foot Locker bargain
bin. Now, the gear worn by
Grant and Co. ranks among
the most popular in the NBA.
People are getting all sorts of
nasty injuries trying to jump
onto the Motown bandwagon.
I've been a fan for 1 1 years,
since the last time a young
Pistons team wa.s getting beat
en in the first round of the
playoffs. Of course, back then,
the young hotshot on the
squad was Isiah Thomas. He
actually owns the Toronto
Raptors now, which should
give you an idea of just how
long ago this was. I've seen my
team through a pair of cham
pionships and some hideously
bad seasons since then. I have
no doubts about my alle
giances.
I guess most fans would say
the same about their own
teams. Usually though, when
someone says that the Dallas
Cowboys are their football
favorites, one has to wonder a
little bit. Chances are, those
fans wouldn't be able to tell you
who the starting quarterback in
Dallas was before Troy Aikman
rode into town. Come to think of
it, I sure can't, but then again,
I'm not the one telling you that
I've loved America's Team all
my life and not just since Deion
hopped aboard.
It's nothing profound —
everybody wants a piece of a
winner. That's as American as
apple pie, isn't it? The Packers,
the Yankees, da Bulls — all
champs, and people just can't
get enough of them. I guess
there's nothing inherently evil
about it — just kind of pathetic.
I can respect the diehard fans
— the Cheeseheads who've
never missed a game on the
Frozen Tundra, the pre-Jordan
Windy City faithful, the Yankee
fans who remember Steve Bal
boni and Mike Pagliarulo in
addition to Mantle, Maris,
Scooter, and Yogi. They've all
got character.
But fans like Cubs fans —
those are the ones that I like
best. There's something to be
said for a person that will stick
by a team that has become syn

onymous with losing and futili
ty. It's a comforting reliability.
Somehow, you know Harry
Caray and the bleacher bums at
Wrigley are always going to be
out root, root, rooting for the
Cubbies. Every spring, there's
new hope for that elusive World
Series, and every October,
there's eternal love for those
losers when it doesn't happen.
As for me, I'm a Mets fan and no
one is going to accuse me of any
thing but being a moron for
that.
Of course, the fans don't nec
essarily have to follow perennial
also-rans to be down. How
about the fans of the Detroit
Red Wings, who cover the ice
with octopi despite a 42 year
Stanley Cup drought?
I also have much respect for
Oakland Raiders fans. How pas
sionate do you have to be about
your team to bite the ear off of a
rival team's fan? I know it's
gruesome (not to mention
extremely illegal) and I would
never condone violence, but I'm
going to go out on a limb and say
that I like the idea of having
fans that are willing to go just a
little bit beyond putting a piece
of foam cheese on their heads.
Maybe I'm being too critical
of fair-weather fans. Maybe I'm
just bitter because the Mets are
going to finish last again this
year. Maybe I'm sad about my
Pistons.
Maybe I should just start
rooting for the Bulls.
