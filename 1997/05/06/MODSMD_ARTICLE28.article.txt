The Stanford equestrian
team kicked up its heels this
past weekend at the 1997 Inter
collegiate Horse Show Associa
tion National Championships.
Approximately 50 colleges com
peted in the championships
which were held at Mt. Holyoke
College in Holyoke, Mass.
"I was proud of our whole
team," said sophomore Mandy
Gillette. "We rode our hearts
out."
Gillette, who competed in the
Intermediate individual fences
and on-the-flat categories,
placed fourth in the latter event.
During the on-the-flat competi
tion, Gillette was judged on her
ability to walk, trot, and canter
a randomly assigned horse
around the ring. Judges then
narrowed the competitors to
four riders, who were asked to
remain in the ring. Gillette
waited anxiously for the
announcement and said "an
extra pump of adrenaline rode
through" when her name was
called.

Sophomore Mark Gundersen
also competed in the champi
onships. Gundersen participat
ed in the beginning stock-feet
category and finished seventh in
his first national appearance.
Gundersen, who hopes to
compete at nationals again next
year, said that he felt a little
nervous before his event but
was satisfied with his ride.
Amanda Hoche, President of
the Stanford equestrian team,
competed in the fences category.
As she neared the middle of the
course, her horse suddenly
refused to jump. Hoche quickly
circled around and rode her
horse towards the fence again,
this time successfully jumping
the obstacle.
"She was really aggressive
out there," said sophomore co-
President Anne Carrney. "She
looked great."
Now that the season is offi
cially over, the team is prepar
ing to rest a little and just enjoy
their time with the horses.
"When you have horses you
never stop riding," Carrney
said. "Now is the time when we
can have fun."
