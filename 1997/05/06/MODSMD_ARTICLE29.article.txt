## 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Last weekend in Santa Cruz,
the men's and women's ultimate
Frisbee teams completed their
mission at regionals. As planned,
both knocked ofT all competition
and will proceed to nationals.
Both teams took the "front
door" route in qualifying for
nationals, winning first place in
their pool and then defeating the
winner of the other pool.
The men's team concentrated
on the things that it knew it need
ed to do well in order to win.
"We tightened up our game in

terms of minimum mental and
physical errors. There were very
few unforced errors and we caused
a lot of errors on the other team. It
was stellar. A lot of guys stepped
up," said senior captain Christian
Dodge.
Despite strong preparation by
the women's team coming into
the tournament, it expected more
competition, especially from the
University of British Columbia, a
team it had not played. Although
ÜBC initially looked very intimi
dating, it ended up falling to the
Superfiy, which scored the first
eight points. The final score of the
match was 15-4.

The women's team was very
excited about winning the tourna
ment, but several injuries are a
cause for concern for the team.
Senior Martita Emde injured her
knee and sophomore Mary Hunt
Martin smashed her head on the
ground, possibly sustaining a con
cussion, in the game against ÜBC.
It is not yet known how serious
these injuries are.
Very little seems to phase play
ers, though. Leslie McAron, a star
deep, played with a broken collar
bone.
"She was getting layouts all
over the place," said senior Abby
Hoover.

The men's team must also con
tend with its share of injuries.
After playing for about six
months, it is inevitable that there
are some injuries. While sopho
more Omer Atesman has an
injured knee and sophomore
Owen Brizgys is suffering from a
torn hamstring, both expect to be
healed for nationals. Dodge broke
his leg earlier in the season; it is
not yet known whether he will be
ready to play a full game any time
soon. However, Dodge was able to
play two points at the regional
tournament.
The team's response to injuries
shows the ability that La Familia

has to step it up at any time. This
will be crucial at nationals, where
it will be playing the nation's top
teams.
In order to prepare for the
upcoming national tournament,
the men's team is practicing very
intensely for the next few weeks.
After that, practices will become
lighter and taper off until the
tournament, which will be from
May 30 until June 1.
"It is very important for us to
stay in shape and get healthy,"
Atesman said.
The women will take a couple
days off from ultimate in order to
get ready for the final stretch of

the season. Over this upcoming
weekend it will compete in Cal.
States, an open tournament, and
will hopefully get some good com
petition there.
The success of the men and
women's teams is due to many fac
tors. The sports has attracted an
increasingly talented pool of play
ers. Both La Familia and Superfly
have some ex-soccer and ex-track
players.
"We have quality athletes who
know what practice means," said
senior Dominique Fontenette.
"I think we have excellent team
chemistry this year," Fontenette
said. "That's what makes it fun."
