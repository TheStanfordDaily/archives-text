# ASSU urges ROTC review
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Last week the Senate of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University passed a bill recom
mending the creation of a Special
Committee to review the Univer
sity's relationship with Reserve
Officer Training Corps.
Since discontinuing its ROTC
programs in 1973, Stanford has
made arrangements for Stanford
students to participate in Army,
Navy and Air Force ROTC units at
other Bay area colleges and uni
versities.
Senator Doug Natelson, one of
the bill's sponsors, noted that the
time had come to review the rela
tionship between Stanford and
ROTC.
"The way the University has
been handling ROTC for the past
ten years has been ambivalent,"
said Natelson. "The University
needs to decide what it wants from
the relationship and then go with
it."
Among the most thorny issues
with which the committee will
likely contend is the question of
whether Stanford's participation
in ROTC, a program subject to the
military's policy of discrimination
based on sexual orientation, is
fundamentally at odds with Stan
ford's policy of non-discrimination
based on sexual orientation.
Law student David Bradfute,

who wrote the bill, emphasized
that the policy of "don't ask, don't
tell" is discriminatory.
Noting the University's past
record of refusing to administer
the distribution of scholarships
for homosexual students, Brad
fute criticized Stanford's involve
ment in the ROTC program.
"I would not have any problem
if we just cashed checks but we are
publicizing, passing out credit and
administering scholarships," said
Bradfute. "However, we are giving
free publicity to a program that
discriminates."
ASSU Senator Bruce Gibney
countered Bradfute's statements,
suggesting that ROTC was not
merely a scholarship.
"ROTC is a job. People have to
serve for four years after college
and the money they receive now is
an advance on their salary. It is a
work program and not a grant of
money. It is not a violation of
Stanford policy," said Gibney.
Assoc. Provost Ann Fletcher
emphasized that the issue of dis
crimination in the military is an
issue that should be fought else
where.
Fletcher continued, "For stu
dents participating in ROTC, such
a policy is not necessarily a reflec
tion on them and it is not for the
University to say that you cannot
join ROTC and nttend Stanford."
Fletcher also noted that the ad
ministration of scholarships avail
able exclusively to homosexuals
would be cumbersome because
"we would have to ask questions
about sexual orientation."
The committee will also be
charged with determining the ap
propriate degree of academic and
financial association between the
ASSU and ROTC.
As a result of Provost Con
doleezza Rice's January 1997 en
rollment agreement with the
Army ROTC unit at Santa Clara
University, debate has ensued
over whether or not the nature of
the University's relationship with
ROTC has changed.
The agreement calls for the
listing of Santa Clara Military Sci
ence courses in the Stanford Uni
versity Bulletin, for providing

classroom space to the U.S. Army
upon request, for ensuring reason
able access for ROTC personnel
during the recruitment, enroll
ment and financial aid process,
and for granting course credit ac
cording to usual transfer credit
procedures.
Bradfute emphasized that pro
visions allowing the military this
type of access to University re
sources would potentially put
Stanford's academic autonomy at
stake.
However, University officials
played down those suggestions.
Fletcher reiterated that the
new agreement was not a major
departure from current policy.
"Our position is that we do not
anticipate a change in what has
been a low level of activity on our
part," Fletcher said.
"We are not sure what we will
do with listing the courses in
Courses and Degrees," said Uni
versity Registrar Roger Printup.
However, Printup added, "We

will tell students more of what the
program is comprised of."
Printup explained that ROTC
courses will continue to be re
viewed for credit as regular trans
fer courses. However, Printup em
phasized that the test for award
ing transfer credit is very high.
"We are looking for courses
comparable to ones we offer here
and those that are useful towards
graduation."
Currently, the only ROTC
course that receives transfer cred
it is a course on Naval Architec
ture offered at Cal.
Gibney and Bradfute are both
urging for the issue of ROTC to be
considered in terms of the larger
issue of whether or not the Uni
versity is meeting the full financial
needs of students.
"We need to be sure that the
University is meeting demonstrat
ed financial need and that stu
dents are not being forced into
ROTC in order to finance their ed
ucation," Bradfute said.

Gibney concurred that review
of the entire financial aid pack
needed to be taken into considera
tion. "The current financial aid
packadge discriminates against
non-targeted minorities. Whites
receive less than blacks whose par
ents earn the same amount of
money," said Gibney.
Natelson summed up the need
for a committee, noting that the
current system is not meeting any
one's needs.
Emphasizing the long com
mutes ROTC members make to
the other campuses and the dearth
of ROTC courses that can be
granted academic credit, Natelson
said, "Any person who takes an ob
jective look realizes that [the cur
rent system] inconveniences both
the gay and lesbian community
and those in ROTC."
The proposal for forming a
Special Committee on ROTC re
quires the approval of the Faculty
Senate before the committee can
be created.
