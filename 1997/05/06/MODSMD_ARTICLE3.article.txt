# ASSU urges ROTC review

### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Last week the Senate of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University passed a bill recom
mending the creation of a Special
Committee to review the Univer
sity's relationship with Reserve
Officer Training Corps.
Since discontinuing its ROTC
programs in 1973, Stanford has
made arrangements for Stanford
students to participate in Army,
Navy and Air Force ROTC units at
other Bay area colleges and uni
versities.
Senator Doug Natelson, one of
the bill's sponsors, noted that the
time had come to review the rela
tionship between Stanford and
ROTC.
"The way the University has
been handling ROTC for the past
ten years has been ambivalent,"
said Natelson. "The University
needs to decide what it wants from
the relationship and then go with
it."
Among the most thorny issues
with which the committee will
likely contend is the question of
whether Stanford's participation
in ROTC, a program subject to the
military's policy of discrimination
based on sexual orientation, is
fundamentally at odds with Stan
ford's policy of non-discrimination
based on sexual orientation.
Law student David Bradfute,

who wrote the bill, emphasized
that the policy of "don't ask, don't
tell" is discriminatory.
Noting the University's past
record of refusing to administer
the distribution of scholarships
for homosexual students, Brad
fute criticized Stanford's involve
ment in the ROTC program.
"I would not have any problem
if we just cashed checks but we are
publicizing, passing out credit and
administering scholarships," said
Bradfute. "However, we are giving
free publicity to a program that
discriminates."
ASSU Senator Bruce Gibney
countered Bradfute's statements,
suggesting that ROTC was not
merely a scholarship.
"ROTC is a job. People have to
serve for four years after college
and the money they receive now is
an advance on their salary. It is a
work program and not a grant of
money. It is not a violation of
Stanford policy," said Gibney.
Assoc. Provost Ann Fletcher
emphasized that the issue of dis
crimination in the military is an
issue that should be fought else
where.
Fletcher continued, "For stu
dents participating in ROTC, such
a policy is not necessarily a reflec
tion on them and it is not for the
University to say that you cannot
join ROTC and nttend Stanford."
