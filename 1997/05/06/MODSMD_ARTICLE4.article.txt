# Delta Gamma national offices name 1997 'the year of Upsilon'
## Sorority celebrates centennial 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Stanford's chapter of the Delta
Gamma sorority has been awarded
$1,000 by the national executive offices
of Delta Gamma in commemoration of
their centennial celebration.
The DG offices named 1997 as "the
year of Upsilon" in honor of the Stan
ford chapter's 100 years of service to
the community and its academic
achievements. DG treasurer Amy

Schneirow explained that "The money
will be donated to the Sensory Access
Foundation located in Palo Alto, the
sorority's philanthropy which benefits
the blind."
The Sensory Access Foundation is a
non-profit organization established 24
years ago by retired Electrical Engi
neering Prof. John Linvill, whose
daughter was blind. He developed the
first electronic information technologi
cal device for the blind which converts
electronic text into tactile representa

tion. The foundation serves the needs of
the blind and visually-impaired.
"The foundation helps them to find
and retain employment through the use
of access technology. If they have diffi
culty doing a job due to a reduction of vi
sion, the SAF will enter into the work
place and see if access technology could
aid the employee in doing the job," said
Diana Drews, executive director of the
foundation.
"The foundation also helps to
broaden the range of job opportu
nities for blind people by training
them to use specialized software
and hardware," Schneirow
added.
According to Schneirow ex
plained that the DGs were one of

the original sororities at Stanford
and currently have the largest
number of members of any soror
ity in the nation, according to
Schneirow. They work closely
with the Delta Gamma Founda
tion, which benefits the blind.
They also conduct an annual
fund-raiser during fall quarter
called Anchor Splash, where all
the proceeds are given to charity.
The DGs have recently worked
with the Disability Resource Cen

ter on campus. Sorority members
have made tape recordings of
books, gone grocery shopping
with disabled students and run a
variety of errands for them, said
Yadira Nevarez, DG president.
"Doing one-on-one work al
lows us to see immediate rewards
that we wouldn't be able to see
just donating money," said
Nevarez.
Navarez added that part of the
reason why the proceeds were do

nated to SAF was because it was
based in Palo Alto and may direct
ly aid Stanford students.
"We can't begin to express how
grateful we are for the donation.
Knowing that we are getting sup
port from the community and
from such a distinguished organi
zation is very gratifying," Drews
said.
The money will be given to the
SAF this Friday at 3 p.m. at 385
Sherman Ave., Suite #2.
