### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Stanford's chapter of the Delta
Gamma sorority has been awarded
$1,000 by the national executive offices
of Delta Gamma in commemoration of
their centennial celebration.
The DG offices named 1997 as "the
year of Upsilon" in honor of the Stan
ford chapter's 100 years of service to
the community and its academic
achievements. DG treasurer Amy

Schneirow explained that "The money
will be donated to the Sensory Access
Foundation located in Palo Alto, the
sorority's philanthropy which benefits
the blind."
The Sensory Access Foundation is a
non-profit organization established 24
years ago by retired Electrical Engi
neering Prof. John Linvill, whose
daughter was blind. He developed the
first electronic information technologi
cal device for the blind which converts
electronic text into tactile representa

tion. The foundation serves the needs of
the blind and visually-impaired.
"The foundation helps them to find
and retain employment through the use
of access technology. If they have diffi
culty doing a job due to a reduction of vi
sion, the SAF will enter into the work
place and see if access technology could
aid the employee in doing the job," said
Diana Drews, executive director of the
foundation.
