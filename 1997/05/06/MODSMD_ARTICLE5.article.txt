# Students soar through the skies
## Young pilots conquer stereotypes, gravity and safety hazards 
### Essan Ni 
From Icarus to the Wright brothers,
mankind has sought to conquer the
air, and now a few Stanford students

are doing same.
Freshman Paolo
Resmini, senior Sarah
Lemmon and second year
graduate student Manabu

Masuda are among the hand
ful of students brave enough
to take to the skies. All three

are pilots who, despite var
ied amounts of experience, i
love being in the air.
Masuda, who is a begin
ner, started taking lessons

for his private pilot license last
June.
"I was playing golf and saw lots of
airplanes above, and one day I just
walked into the Palo Alto Flying Club
office," Masuda said. An international
student from Japan, he added that ac
cess to flying is much harder there.
Resmini had a little more exposure
to aviation, since his father is a pilot.
Resmini decided to try flying when he
was 14 and has been doing it ever since.
Lemmon started a little younger at
age 10, but she had been bugging her
family since she was 8 to let her fly and
even wanted to change her name to
Amelia, after Earhart. Although no
one else in her family flies, all are used
to her being a pilot and have been her
passengers.
According to Lemmon, people in
general are shocked that a 20-year-old
female can fly planes.

"I worked as a mechanic in high
school, and you can tell people are
bothered by a young female working on
their plane," she said. "It's unfortu
nate there are not as many women in
flying."

Lemmon
added that people

make flying in
general a bigger
deal than it real
ly is.
"When peo
ple find out I fly,
lit's either
'you're crazy' or
'it's amazing—l

want to go up
with you,' " Resmini said. He has flown
many people around the Hay Area.
Masuda, on the other hand, wants
to gain more flying experience before
taking passengers with him. "I've only
taken one friend up," Masuda said and
continued with a smile, "I don't want
to risk their lives."
Because of "the Jessica incident,"
he has not told his family about Hying
yet. He will eventually, since his goals
include sharing his favorite part of fly
ing with his family, the night view of
San Francisco.
Resmini also enjoys night flying,
along with the sense of accomplish
ment at every landing.
For Lemmon, "the best part is that
flying puts everything in perspective.
It's a great escape, and for me I'm
happy just watching planes take off
and land." She added that she usually
watches only the airplane segments of

"Top Gun," opting for fighter planes
over Tom Cruise or Val Kilmer.
For both her and Resmini, the F-16
is the dream machine to fly.
"It's just a beautiful airplane, but a
more reasonable goal is to teach my
whole family to fly for free," Resmini
said.
All three pilots attest to the costli
ness of aviation. Additionally, htye are
concerned with safety. Lemmon's
worst accident was a mechanical mal
function while in the air with her fa
ther, resulting in a dangerous landing.
Resmini has encountered a cockpit fire
and a complete electrical failure while
in the clouds.
"The thought of all that stuff is a bit
scary, but the more flying you do, the
more you deal with it," Lemmon said.
Despite these concerns, they will al
ways enjoy flying and even experiment
with flying techniques.
"You can enjoy some stupid maneu
ver," Masuda said. "You can make the
plane like a roller coaster."
Resmini, a self-proclaimed "adrena
line junkie," did aerobatics this sum
mer. That experience also taught him a
lot because it involved not looking at
instruments.
"You fly by the seat of your pants,
you feel the airplane," he said. "You
understand how to keep an airplane in
control."
Aside from fun in the air, Lemmon
pointed out that landing can also bead
venturous. At her favorite place to fly,
the San .Juan Islands in Washington,

(here are small airports with run
ways that go uphill.
"There's one place where you
have to fly over once to scare the
sheep off the runway and then cir
cle back and land," she said.
During one landing at the Palo
Alto Airport, Masuda's instructor
suddenly got excited because he
recognized Joe Montana on the
runway. Masuda and his instruc
tor chatted with Montana, who
also flies.
"My instructor says Joe's bad
at landing; his airplane always
bounces down the runway," Ma
suda added.
Flying (and landing) is not only
personally gratifying but also a
means of helping others. Resmini
is on the volunteer air patrol emer
gency search and rescue team for
Santa Clara county, which ships
emergency medical supplies and
personnel. He also wants to start a
flying group on campus next year
because pilots do serious bonding
and have their own lingo.
Resmini will most likely major

in Aeronautical Engineering and
pursue a career related to avia
tion, and Lemmon would also like
to integrate flying into her future
career. She is considering attend
ing medical school, possibly to
study the field of international
health so she can fly herself places.
Both she and Resmini, howev
er, are not seriously considering
commercial flying.
"It's like driving a bus," Lem
mon said.
Still, they are both working on
obtaining their commercial licens
es, already having the private li
cense and other advanced creden
tials. Both learned to fly before
learning to drive, and Resmini
commented that flying is just like
driving, only more complex.
Unlike the other two pilots, Ma
suda claims he will always fly "just
for fun."
After graduation, Lemmon
plans to teach flight for one year,
and Masuda will return to Japan
where he will continue flying.
No matter what direction their
lives take them, these three pilots
will always find their way to the
air. As Resmini said, "pilots are
never lost — they're just tem
porarily misplaced."
