# Megan's Law
## Murderer may face death penalty 
### 
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — One of the first people
Maureen Kanka spoke to when her 6-year-old daugh
ter didn't return home was the man now standing
trial in the little girl's slaying, Mrs. Kanka told jurors
yesterday.
Jesse Timmendequas, who lived across the street,
said he had seen little Megan earlier in the day, Mrs.
Kanka testified in the opening day of Timmende
quas' trial.
"He was very normal speaking, calm, very matter
of-fact," Mrs. Kanka said of her very first conversa
tion with Timmendequas.
By then, Megan had already been kidnapped,
raped and killed, Prosecutor Kathryn Flicker said.
Her body would not be found for another day.
The slaying in July 1994 prompted laws in
Megan's name around the country seeking to make
sure that people are notified about convicted sexual
predators living in their communities.
Timmendequas (pronounced ti-men'-de-kwas),
who had two prior sex convictions, is charged with
murder, kidnapping and sexual assault. If convicted
of murder, he could face the death penalty.
Timmendequas lured Megan into his home by
asking if she wanted to come inside to see his new
puppy, Ms. Flicker said.
"Unsuspecting, trusting, 7-year-old Megan
walked into the defendant's house, unseen by any of
the people who might have intervened. Megan

walked in. She would never walk out," Ms. Flicker
said.
Ms. Flicker said it was not the first time that Tim
mendequas had noticed Megan. "He had had his eye
on Megan — his thoughts anything but pure."
Timmendequas' lawyer, Barbara R. Lependorf,
asked jurors not to allow their feelings to influence
their view of the evidence.
"The death of a child is emotional. But you have
to view this analytically — not emotionally," she said
in her opening statement.
She also said the jurors would have to judge the
credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, many of
whom are police officers.
"They are not infallible. They make mistakes,"
Ms. Lependorf said.
Mrs. Kanka testified she wasn't unduly concerned
when she didn't see her daughter because suburban
Hamilton Township "is such a nice neighborhood."
She began crying as the prosecutor held up pieces
of stained and tattered clothing that police found in
Timmendequas' garbage.
Ms. Flicker had told jurors that the discovery of
the clothing prompted police to question Timmende
quas, and that hours later he agreed to lead officers
to the girl's body in a park.
The most damaging evidence was a bite mark vis
ible on Timmendequas' hand when he was being
questioned.
