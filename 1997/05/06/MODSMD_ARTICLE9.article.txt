DENVER (AP) — Prosecutors sought
yesterday to link Timothy McVeigh and
Terry Nichols to the theft of bomb materi
als, with testimony that a drill bit found at
Nichols' house likely broke open a lock on a
quarry explosives bin.
FBI toolmark expert James Cadigan tes
tified the bit found in a search of Nichols'
Herington, Kan., home matched marks
made on a drilled-out padlock from a quar
ry break-in six months before the Okla
homa City bombing.
Prosecutors contend McVeigh and
Nichols stole blasting caps and boxes of
high explosives from the Marion, Kan.
quarry and used them to set off the fuel oil
and-fertilizer truck bomb used in the blast.
Previously, prosecutors have produced
evidence the pair were in the area of the
quarry around the time of the theft. They
have also noted that other items found in
Nichols' house, including a receipt for the
purchase of explosive fertilizer, bore
McVeigh's fingerprints.
FBI lawyer Mary Jasnowski testified
agents also found a prepaid telephone card
that prosecutors contend was used to make
dozens of calls in search of bomb compo
nents.
She said the phone card bore the name
Darryl Bridges and was ordered from the
Spotlight, an anti-government newspa
per.

McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veter
an, could face the death penalty if convicted
of murder and conspiracy in the April 19,
1995, explosion that killed 168 people and
injured more than 500. Nichols is to be
tried later on the same charges.
The court week began with a new look
for McVeigh. Me entered the courtroom
with a flat-top haircut — the hair nearly
shaved on the sides with a bristle-brush
top. This replaced his uniformly short crew
cut of last week.
Prosecutors spent much of yesterday
introducing into evidence a number of crit
ical items seized from Nichols' home during
several FBI searches after the bombing.
Among the items found was a battery
powered Makita drill and a set of drill bits.
Using a microscope, Cadigan compared
the marks made by one of those drill bits to
the marks on the brass cylinder of a padlock
at the quarry break-in site.
" This drill bit produced marks that were
contained in the padlock," Cadigan said. He
noted that the tip of every drill bit manu
factured has unique markings, and that
bits get new markings as they wear down
from use.
Testimony from Jasnowski was used to
tie Nichols to the alias Havens. A farm sup
ply executive testified last week that two
tons of explosive fertilizer were sold to a
man using the name Mike Havens.
