A lesson in sexual literacy by psychosexual
therapist and media personality Dr. Ruth West
heimer touched on topics ranging from sexual re
sponsibility to premature ejaculation to onion
rings.
The speech, titled "Sexually Speaking with Dr.
Ruth," was sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and delivered to an overflowing Cubberley
Auditorium last night. It aimed to dispel the sex
ual myths that develop, she said, behind the
closed doors of the sexually embarrassed and un
informed.
"In the Middle Ages," she said, "there was a
myth that during menstruation, women had no
blood in the brain. It was thought it all drained to
the uterus." The danger, she said, came when
people decided it justified only educating men.
The greatest danger in sexual myths today,
Westheimer continued, comes in the form of sex
ually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnan
cies and AIDS. On a smaller scale, they can lead to
lower self-esteem and unhealthy sexual relation
ships.
"Through talks like ours, things are getting
better," she said. "More people are sexually liter
ate."
But "more people" is not necessarily enough.
She explained that while there were 1.5 million
unintended pregnancies annually 15 years ago,
they still average 1 million in the 19905.
However, it is because of this high rate that
Westheimer said she believes abortion must re
main available to every woman.
"I come from Nazi Germany," she said, "where
I learned you must stand up and be counted for
what you believe, and abortion must remain legal
