### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
A lesson in sexual literacy by psychosexual
therapist and media personality Dr. Ruth West
heimer touched on topics ranging from sexual re
sponsibility to premature ejaculation to onion
rings.
The speech, titled "Sexually Speaking with Dr.
Ruth," was sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and delivered to an overflowing Cubberley
Auditorium last night. It aimed to dispel the sex
ual myths that develop, she said, behind the
closed doors of the sexually embarrassed and un
informed.
"In the Middle Ages," she said, "there was a
myth that during menstruation, women had no
blood in the brain. It was thought it all drained to
the uterus." The danger, she said, came when
people decided it justified only educating men.
The greatest danger in sexual myths today,
Westheimer continued, comes in the form of sex
ually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnan
cies and AIDS. On a smaller scale, they can lead to
lower self-esteem and unhealthy sexual relation
ships.
"Through talks like ours, things are getting
better," she said. "More people are sexually liter
ate."
But "more people" is not necessarily enough.
She explained that while there were 1.5 million
unintended pregnancies annually 15 years ago,
they still average 1 million in the 19905.
However, it is because of this high rate that
Westheimer said she believes abortion must re
main available to every woman.
"I come from Nazi Germany," she said, "where
I learned you must stand up and be counted for
what you believe, and abortion must remain legal

— not as a contraceptive but when
contraception fails."
Westheimer also expressed her
respect for heterosexuals and ho
mosexuals, the concept of celibacy
before marriage and those who
are sexually active and responsi
ble.
She said she believes everyone
can learn and deserves to enjoy
sex. Through her private counsel
ing sessions, she has encountered
cases of insecure husbands com
plaining of ailments such as pre
mature ejaculation.
Such conditions can be over
come through counseling, she
said, and sex can be made enjoy
able for everyone — to the point
where consenting, responsible
adults can overcome psychological
fears and partake in healthy sexu
al relationships.
"Everyone needs to know
about sex," she added, "but not
necessarily when to have it." She
said she believes the decision to
have sex is and should remain a
private matter.
Twenty years ago, as a pioneer
of radio psychology, Westheimer
began a not-so-discrete method of
talk radio. She began answering
call-in questions from listeners

during her 15-minute radio show
broadcast every Sunday after mid
night.
Her candid approach began in
obscurity but eventually bloomed
into a cable television show —
"The All New Dr. Ruth Show" —
and a syndicated newspaper col
umn called "Ask Dr. Ruth." She
has also authored 11 books, the
most recent titled "Encyclopedia
of Sex." Her work has inspired
programs like "Loveline" with
Adam and Dr. Drew, a show popu
lar among high school and college
students.
Her media persona as Dr. Ruth
has earned her spots on shows
such as David Letterman and
Donahue. The grounded West
heimer has also earned numerous
awards as a lecturer and currently
serves as an adjunct associate pro
fessor at New York University.
She is a fellow of the New York
Academy of Medicine and main
tains her own private practice.
Westheimer actually has ties to
Stanford through her son, who
graduated with a doctoral degree
from the School of Education in
1995.
Although many may misinter
pret her main message as one that
encourages promiscuity, West
heimer has a different view. In the
words of a self-proclaimed old
fashioned girl, she said, "1 believe
in love and marriage."
