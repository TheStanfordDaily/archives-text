All Stanford students
deserve their due, not
just ones named Chelsea

SO CHELSEA CLINTON has
decided to come to Stanford.
So she's the president's
daughter. So the campus spent a day
or two on every local and national
TV news show and in every local
and national paper. So what?
Well, here's what. It happens to
be the first time since a newly mar
ried Luci Johnson enrolled at the
University of Texas in 1966 that a
presidential offspring will be in col
lege while her (or his) father is still
in office. And that, of course, brings
up a lot of pluses and minuses for
Stanford.
The pluses are fairly obvious.
Another, very public acknowledg
ment of the University's excellence.
More publicity than in the wildest
dreams of Terry Shepard, director
of university communications. Per
haps a presidential disinclination to
cut federal research funds headed
west. Probably a jump in applica
tions next year.
The are pretty straightforward,
too. Heightened campus security.
Secret service. Four years of a mag
nifying glass focused on the campus.
Those are real issues that deserve
real consideration, and they make
Chelsea's decision an important one
for Stanford.
But at the same time, so what?
The Office of Undergraduate

Admissions chose 2,604 students
for the Class of 2001; it is expected
thatabout 1,600 of them will enroll.
That means Chelsea will comprise
six-hundredths of 1 percent of the
enrolled class.
That is to say, we really ought to
keep this whole thing in perspective.
We know that Chelsea Clinton is
a National Merit semifinalist. We
don't know her transcript or SAT
scores, but we every reason to
believe both are excellent. We know
that she has incredibly bright par
ents. And we know that she's a ded
icated ballet dancer.
In other words, she is a smart,
well-rounded student, the perfect
candidate for Stanford — just like
the 2,603 others who received the
big packet from Montoya.
And that must be kept in mind.
She's bright and talented, just
like the rest of the incoming class.
Her claim to fame is that her dad's
got a cool job. But many other
incoming students will have their
own, also quite significant, claims to
fame. Maybe one of her classmates
will be the star of a television show
about growing up in the '60s. Maybe
one of her classmates will be a golf
champion.
So yes Chelsea has some unique
attributes. But so does every other
member of the Class of 2001, and
what makes some of those students
unique will be no less significant
than what makes her unique. To
pretend otherwise — to engage in
stargazing and "McLaughlin "-style
political analyses — would be a dis
service not only to Chelsea but to
every member of the incoming class.
