WHEN PEOPLE ASK me where
I'm from, and when I tell them
Wichita, Kan., they usually stare
at me as if I'm from a different planet. I
know what they're picturing: an endless
stretch of brown flatness. Cows. A trailer
park of a town. It's weird — after living in
Wichita for 17 years and despising the
hell out of it the entire time, I ended up
coming to Stanford and having to defend
it right and left. I can't tell you how many
times I've stood up for that sorry little
city in the middle of nowhere.
To give you an idea of how weird it is
that I defend it so much, let me give you a
taste of how I felt when I lived there. This
is a poem a friend of mine from high
school wrote when we were 14:
Here I am — displaced Midwesterner
Stuck in the'goddamn middle
Of the goddamn Bible belt
And in this prep school choke
Suffocating in this butthole town's
smoke.
It's not exactly Shakespeare, but you
get the picture. I spent most of my life
waiting until I could get out and go to San
Francisco or New York. I was not born in
Wichita, nor were my parents, and I often
don't feel like I come from there,
although in a funny, uncomfortable way I
know that I do. I know that no matter
how long I am gone it will always remain
a part of my consciousness. I know that I
will always be explaining it to dumb
founded Los Angeles kids who don't real

ize that 99 percent of the nation lives out
side of California. So here goes:
Wichita is an insistently contradictory
place. It's a "safe" place with lots of
crime, a beautiful place that's dull and
flat. It's a town of grassy plains and air
planes. It's a large town — or a small city.
People always ask me about Dorothy
and Toto. I have nothing to say about it,
except that the only thing in Wichita I've
ever encountered that bears the name of a
Wizard of Oz character is the Toto, a gay
bar on the south side.
Suprised? Yeah, well, there are a lot of
surprises. There's a dark side there. A
side that creeps quiet, like the shadows
that chase each other across the Arkansas
Bridge on a sinister night. Wichita may be
a hick town, but it's also a town where
gangs control neighborhoods, where east
side country club sons and daughters sell
crack to their caddies and where a lonely
old man lives out of a shopping cart on the
banks of a dirty river. And there are a lot
of tensions that you might not think
you'd find there — it's an extremely
divided city race-wise and class-wise, and
people are a lot less willing to talk about it
there than in California.
Still, looking back, there are a lot of
things I loved. I loved driving along the
periphery of the city, where the fields spill
out of the edges and flow unbroken for
miles, traversed only by Interstate 135
and a few whimpering country roads. I
loved hanging out at Denny's until 2 a.m.

and watching the never-ending freak
parade: cowboys, old ladies, 13-year-olds
smoking their first cigarette, cops, preps,
jocks, artists. I loved this sign on an aban
doned shed a mile away from my house:
"This shed is dedicated to soil and water."
And I loved Wichita people — farmers
who watch tornadoes through the tiny
viewfinders on their Camcorders, rotten
kids who cut school and scratch their
names into the rotten wood of the dock
near the 13th Street overpass, insurance
salesmen, drunks — everyone. There's an
element of down-home, unpretentious
individualism there, as in many Midwest
ern towns, but there's also a bit of an infe
riority complex. In a way, Wichita is
always trying to prove it's more than a
pitstop on the way to Dallas or Denver.
And I guess that's why I've ended up
defending it so much — because it is a pit
stop in some ways, and I am always trying
to prove that it is not. Because if you're
from a small town, especially one in
Kansas, you're always having to set the
record straight. And because I'm still
sorting out all the weird contradictory
things that make Wichita so interesting.
Ask me about it sometime.

Rula Razek, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, hopes she has left
Kansas behind her forever. Sort of.
