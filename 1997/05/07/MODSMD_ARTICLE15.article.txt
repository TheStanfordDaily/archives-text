SEAS believes 6 community' extends beyond Palm Drive

YESTERDAY'S EDITORIAL ON
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford was a factual,
compositional and, not to mention,
grammatical abomination. It is humiliat
ing to feel obligated to reply; however
some of the issues it vaguely alludes to
are issues SEAS members have been
grappling with for years. The problem of
a local vs. global focus for our activism is
certainly not new to us.
SEAS is currently redefining itself
as an environmental justice organiza
tion. This philosophy differs from that
of many traditional environmental
groups. We seek to attack root causes
through recognizing the links between
environmental degradation and other
social injustices such as racism, clas
sism, sexism and homophobia. SEAS in
many ways falls short of its ideal
vision, and we are the first to admit
that.
In this process of redefinition, we
are seeking to define community and
what our involvement in that commu
nity should be. The definition of com
munity presented in yesterday's edito
rial is severely limited and typically
Stanford-centric. Community, as

defined by that editorial, is only that
which affects Stanford students. That
selfish idea leads to a one-way relation
ship where East Palo Alto is a laborato
ry for Stanford students to test out
their service. Stanford should use its
power and prestige to positively affect
the community and not just students
themselves.
And yet, what is our community?
What do we count as our "figurative
backyard"? Is a nuclear waste dump
near the Arizona border that will affect
the water systems for all of California
too far away? Is the destruction of
Headwaters forest in Northern Califor
nia an issue that is not "visible and
important" to Stanford students? Are
human rights abuses in Burma that our
university tacitly supports through its
investment in companies like Unocal
and Texaco completely unrelated to the
Stanford community?
These are all issues that SEAS has
been working on. Furthermore, we
attack these issues on a variety of lev
els: trying to get Stanford to divest
from socially irresponsible companies,
lobbying Congress in an attempt to
affect U.S. policy, fliering on campus

about issues that should affect all of us
even within "the safe confines of Cam
pus Drive."
We are not operating in a vacuum.
However, even if we accept The Daily's
definition of community, which does
not reach beyond Lake Lagunita, SEAS
is still providing legitimate service for
students. The Environmental Repre
sentative Network, a subgroup of
SEAS, works on Earth Week and Stan
ford's energy, water and recycling pro
grams. In addition, we have held three
different teach-ins and have funded at
least five major speakers.
Many SEAS members have been
working on an individual basis with
groups in East Palo Alto, Oakland and
San Francisco. We are currently build
ing a network of universities and high
schools in the nation as well as net
working with existing social and envi
ronmental justice groups throughout
the Bay Area.
Finally, we'd like to correct several
factual errors: First, the organic farm
project was not "developed and imple
mented" by SEAS members but was in
fact almost single-handedly created by
Brian Halweil's passion and determina

tion — as was detailed in an earlier,
front-page Daily article. SEAS members
have since become involved with the
farm along with many other people and
by no means has this farm been
"recently neglected."
Second, Nike does not operate in
Burma and The Daily might conceiv
ably be facing a libel suit for such bla
tant misinformation. Nor is protesting
Nike specifically a SEAS campaign,
although many SEAS members have
been involved in protesting the labor
rights issues and oppression of Indone
sia's Suharto regime. The Daily would
be better advised to spend its time
researching its articles, rather than
criticizing student groups who actually
do add something valuable to the intel
lectual discourse at this university.
