# Organic farm showing no signs of neglect
## 
### 
I was surprised to read the following
statement in yesterday's editorial: "It is
significant that a project like the organic
farm, which was developed and imple
mented by SEAS members, has been
recently neglected." I do not claim to
know the involvement of SEAS in this
project, nor do I particularly care; inde
pendent of that, I think it is important
to realize that the organic farm is any
thing but neglected.
I have had some contact and partici

pat ion in the project; in addition, I ride
by the farm going to and from work
every day. It is rare that there isn't
someone working on the farm during
daylight hours, even on Saturday and
Sunday morning.
The beds are being neatly planted and
weeded. One need only count the num
ber of planting beds and then multiply
by several hours of backbreaking labor
per bed required to dig compost into the
heavy clay soil, to get some idea of the
magnitude of commitment to this pro
ject. And the participants are continuing
to dig more beds!
Please don't refer to such an enthusi
astic project as "neglected" unless the

(unlikely) day comes when it actually is
