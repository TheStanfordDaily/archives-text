# Critical thinking more valued than politics

Jeffrey Giesea, citing a 1995 study
finding that more than 80 percent of
registered voters of Stanford faculty are
Democrats, complained in a letter yes
terday that the underrepresentation of
Republicans prevents students from
receiving a proper, balanced education
and stifles intellectual life.

It has been my experience teaching
Stanford undergraduates (including
Giesea) that they are astute enough to
evaluate critically what they hear in the
classroom. But if it really were true that
the quality of education was being
diminished by a political imbalance on
the faculty, then the true path to a
proper and intellectually stimulating
education would be to encourage Stan
ford to seek not more Republican prose
lytizers but teachers, be they Republi
can, Democrat, Socialist or whatever,
who know how to promote critical
thinking.
