# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Don't you wonder what Chelsea thinks about all this? 
### 
HERE'S SOME OLD news for those
of you who just don't know what's
up: As of last week, it's official that
Chelsea Clinton — of the Washington
area Clintons — will be attending Stan
ford next year. It's a shame you couldn't
be here when it happened.
Chelsea's announcement took me back
to the day I decided to attend Stanford. Of
course, when I voiced my college choice, it
was only picked up by two of the networks,
and The New York Times misspelled my
name in its banner headline. But what can
you do? It was still a special moment for
me and my loving family.
I'm truly sorry that I won't be here
next year to see the First Frosh's experi
ences unfold — although theoretically, if I
didn't leave, there wouldn't be room for
her. It would be fun to watch Chelsea and
Stanford get used to each other. Security
preparations are already underway. Resi
dent assistant interviews now include
polygraph machines, and the food service
hashers are having their backgrounds

checked Hyper hackers have already set to
work adding extra layers of encryption to
the new "ehelseac@leland" account.
Yet for all the excitement following the
Announcement, you can expect that it's
going to expand exponentially come the
Arrival I predict that the "Chelsea
Watch" media-meter, which grumbled in
anticipation all year before peaking last
week, will settle down a bit — maybe even
bottom out this month during the final
episode of Roseau ne — and then skyrock
et into the red zone come September. If
you thought the Pro Fro stage was big,
just you wait for Parents Weekend.
Through all the media bombardment,
Stanford officially maintained that
Chelsea will be, "in every possible way, a
regular Stanford student" and declined to
elaborate further. So the media looked
elsewhere, seeking out students and facul
ty, frat hoys and freshman girls, even
Chelsea's humble Pro Fro Hos, who guid
ed the press to a ratty futon.
"Chelsea Clinton Slept Here."

Something kept bothering me all
through the hoopla: Where was the real
Chelsea in all of this? I know that her pri
vacy is important, but the girl's announce
ment did produce a bigger buzz than a six
pack on an empty stomach, and it would be
nice to hear just one little sound bite. "Yes,
I'm excited about all thus because...." Or,
"What really made the decision for me
was...Or, "Hi, my name is Chelsea and
my voice, which you've never ever heard,
sounds like this... ."Something. Anything.
But instead — nothing. And the mes
sage therein is pretty clear: Chelsea is
going to be a normal student, and nobody
cares about normal people, so please stop
caring about Chelsea.
But the problem is, Chelsea, by virtue
of her presidential position, is not a nor
mal person, and so for her parents and
press agents to keep her out of it while
nobody else does can seem unfair. The
result is that the media knows everything
about her life, but we don't know any
thing about her.

All we really know about her is this: she
used to have braces, she has curly hair (I
would say "kinky," but this is the presi
dent's daughter I'm talking about), and
she's got a fancy for ballet dancing and
drinking Boysenberry Bliss. Also, she's
not as attractive as the Gore daughters,
but very few people are. That's about it.
Now it could be that Chelsea is a very
shy and private person who doesn't like to
share feelings or opinions with interested
strangers. But based on the little we can
surmise about her, I would say no. After
all, I don't consider myself to be that reluc
tant a person, but still, I would never ask
my mom to take me to Bosnia or show up
to be acknowledged at any of my dad's con
vent ions. And let's not forget that her col
lege choice says a lot about her personality
as well. She could have gone to Harvard or
Yale and spent her school years snowed in
or locked in, but no — she came here,
where people are the biggest asset and the
place to be is outside.
CChelsea's not a normal student and a lot

of people are worried — rightfully so —
that this will lead to some unfortunately
"abnormal" college experience. But the
only problem I see is if all the hypo contin
ues and the subject of all the stories is
never the subject of all the interviews. So
let her talk, if she wants, about what it
feels like to bo the focus of all this attention
and that may be all it takes to diffuse it. I-et
her talk about what she wants out of col
lege and what she thinks is "normal."
Alter all, this is Stanford. If Chelsea
does turn out to be a normal student,
she'll be the only one.

Victor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, has no doubt that Chelsea Clin
ton is perfectly normal, hut he would just
like to hear it from her. Next week, Wish
ria's column will return to its regular
Monday space, and Jeremy Desmon's col
umn will appear here.
