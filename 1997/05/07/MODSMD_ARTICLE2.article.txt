# ASSU certifies presidential election race
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate put the 1997 pres
idential election to rest last night by cer
tifying its results in a 10 to 5 vote. The
action, which came after two hours of
fierce floor debate, formally confirmed
juniors Emily Andrus and Ben Decker
as ASSU president and vice president.
Following the vote, Andrus was visi
bly relieved. "I am very, very excited to
start working," she said.
Decker agreed. "I am happy that this
entire process has come to an end," he
said, "and that Emily and I can get
started on the goals we were elected to
achieve."
For Andrus and Decker, the road to
the top of the ASSU executive branch

was filled with controversy. The duo
avoided a runoff election by only a few
votes, capturing 50.24 percent of the
vote. Questions were raised on the va
lidity of that victory when miscommu
nication between the ASSU Elections
Commission and Stanford in Oxford de
nied more than 50 students the right to
vote.
The senate diffused that issue by val
idating the election results at its April
22 meeting. A new controversy arose,
however, in allegations of financial mis
conduct by the Andrus / Decker cam
paign.
The ASSU Hearings Committee re
ceived two formal complaints of alleged
Andrus / Decker violations of the $300
campaign spending limit. In each
instance, the committee declined to
bring formal charges against the
campaign.
Those rulings did not stop sever
al senators and senate affiliates
from bringing up the spending
charges at last night's meeting. Led
by ASSU Senator Gil Serrano and
Constitutional Council member
Nawwar Kasrawi, the opposition
group challenged the committee's
actions and called on the senate not
to certify the election.
"It seems pretty clear that no for
mal investigation was done," Kas

rawi said during debate. "It didn't
happen at the Hearings Committee,
so it needs to happen here."
ASSU Senator Steve Yoda urged
the body to trust the Hearings Com
mittee. The senate established the
committee to do a job, he said, and it
is important to support its actions.
ASSU Senator Howard Loo, an
other presidential candidate, dis
agreed with Yoda, saying the com
mittee derives its power from the
senate. "Ultimately, it's us who
have to look at our constituents in
the eyes and say 'Yes, I voted for
certification' or 'No, I did not vote
for them.' "
Andrus was silent for much of
the evening, but twice answered
her critics. Speaking to a question
of whether she would prefer a sec

ond election, she replied, "I've run a
fair campaign. Why should I run
again based on the beliefs of other
people?"
In the end, the senate answered
that question with a roll-call vote
that saw five members, including
Andrus, abstain from voting. After
the final tally was announced, the
senate applauded the new presi
dent and vice president.
Earlier in the evening, the sen
ate separated certification into four
parts. It then voted to certify the
largest portion of the results, in
cluding constitutional amend
ments, special fees, senate seats
and junior and senior class presi
dents. Two sticking points remain,
however, before the election is en
tirely in the books.

The senate will wait until its
next meeting to deal with the grad
uate senate by-election and the
sophomore class presidential cam
paign. The former issue deals with
filling the vacant seats in the senate
allotted to graduate students, while
the latter issue is another case of al
leged financial wrongdoing. Cardi
nal Quad, the winning slate, is ac
cused of spending more than three
times the $ 180 spending limit.
Instead of certifying the sopho
more president votes, the senate de
cided to send the issue back to the
Hearings Committee. The vote on
that recommendation was sched
uled to follow the ASSU presiden
tial decision, but a loss of quorum
immediately following that vote left
the issue unresolved.
