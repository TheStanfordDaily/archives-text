Kasrawi's allegations
are terribly misguided
I am astounded that I am actually
bothering to write a letter to The Daily,
much less one that relates to the doings
of the ASSU. During my stay here, the
ASSU's only apparent value to me is
that of an occasional source of amuse
ment when I read about the petty in
fighting it engenders. However, Nawwar
Kasrawi's letter in yesterday's Daily
accusing Emily Andrus of lying about
the financing of her campaign has
spurred me to action, not because I sud
denly care about the ASSU but because
it impugns the integrity of a decent and
honest person.
I have known Emily for the past three
years and have found her to be thought
ful, practical and extremely hard-work
ing. She is going to be a terrific ASSU
president, as she will focus her consider
able ability on issues that directly affect
us as students rather than being dis-

traded by the latest irrelevant cause
celebre. (The recent outcry over universi
ties being ranked by a news magazine
comes to mind.) I was very impressed
with her campaign material; it looked
extremely professional 1 did notice,
though, that a cursory handling of one
of the posters did cause the ink to rub
off, which suggests to me that the print
ing was not of incredibly high quality
and not prohibitively expensive. This
empirical observation, coupled with my
knowledge of Emily's integrity, causes
me to reject Kasrawi's accusations.
Furthermore, I feel that as students
we can rely upon the ASSU Hearings
Committee to do its job. As an under
graduate, I spent considerable amounts
of time serving on various student com
mittees. I know that for myself and
those I worked with, it was very impor
tant to do our work as well as possible;
otherwise, it was not worth volunteer
ing our time at all. I would be surprised
to learn that the members of the Hear
ings Committee feel any differently
about their service. A representative

government such as the ASSU requires
that at times we trust in the judgment
of others. I am certain that in this case
we can trust their recommendation to
the ASSU Senate to certify the election.
Finally, it is certainly ironic that
Kasrawi, of all people, is complaining
about questionable politics. As ASSU
Senate chair in 1994-95, he pulled one
of the most crass political stunts of
which I have ever heard. When he saw
that the composition of the senate
would not allow him to pass a piece of
legislation that he favored, lie pulled
out an obscure bylaw requiring that
senators be wearing their moronic "I'm
an ASSU senator, silly!" sweatshirts in
order to vote. In this way he tweaked
the balance of power in the quorum,
thus allowing him to get his way. Oddly
enough, that seems to be the only time
that bylaw was utilized. (Of course,
what I really want to know is who paid
for these asinine sweatshirts. I'd hate
to think they came out of my ASSU
dues.) As he is once again pulling out
obscure bylaws, I cannot help but won

der what his agenda is; perhaps he is
concerned that the Andrus / Decker
administration will begin to transform
the ASSU into something more than a
laughingstock.
