# Ethnic joke contradicts Daily's editorial stance
## 
### 
In its April 10 issue The Daily editori
alized that acts of hate "are the work of
uneducated and uncivilized people" and
that "it is unfortunate when any part of
our community is a target of hate."
In the April 29 issue, it complained
about the general student apathy toward
recent incidents of hate.
And on May 2, The Daily sidestepped
its effort to fight, hate by publishing a
column that contained anti-Arab hate
speech.
On the Diversions page, Samuel Park
"joked" that Chelsea Clinton's date will

be killed by "the son of an Arab leader."
Park's singling out of Arabs, while
avoiding the mention of any other eth
nic, racial or religious group, is suspect.
It is incomprehensible why The Daily,
after sanctimoniously taking a position
against hate speech, would publish
Park's column.
As an Arab American, I have to ask
myself if The Daily would have printed
Park's statement if he had "joked" that
Chelsea's date would be killed by a .Jew
ish, Asian-American, African-American,
Native American, dhicano or gay person
Given The Daily's previous editorials,
one can only infer the answer is an
emphatic "no," and rightfully so. After
all, The Daily proclaimed in its April 10
editorial, "acts of hate are, simply,
unwelcome on this campus."
However, the printing of Park's col
umn illustrates The Daily â€” in its sup
posed effort to eradicate such acts
should perhaps begin by cleaning its
own house.
