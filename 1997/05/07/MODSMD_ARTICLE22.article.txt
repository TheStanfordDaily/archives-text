OCD caused by defective gene

Researchers at Rockefeller University and four
other institutions have discovered that obsessive
( compulsive disorder, which affects 1 to 3 percent of
the population, is caused by defects in the genetic
sequence. According to their study, defects in the
gene coding for an enzyme called catechol-O-methyl
transferase increases the susceptibility of men to
developing the disorder.

Maria Karayiorgou, assistant professor and head of Rockefeller's
Laboratory of Human Neurogenetics said in a statement that
"inheritance of OCD is not simple and most likely involves a num
ber of susceptibility genes and environmental influences. We believe
we have found one susceptibility gene, which when it occurs in a
particular form contributes to a man's risk of developing OCD."
The enzyme normally stops the action of two neurotransmitters,
dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals are involved in var
ious brain functions, including control of emotions.
Normally, the neurotransmitters pass from one nerve to anoth
er and are ultimately broken down by the enzyme. However, if the
enzyme's gene coding is defective, only low levels are expressed; and
the neurotransmitters cannot be broken down. This leads to char
acteristic symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, like an urge
to perform repetitive rituals like washing, cleaning, checking or
counting.
Unfortunately, the link between the enzyme's gene and the dis
order is limited to men. According to Karayiorgou, "The association
was not significant in women, and it is possible that either our sam
ple did not have the power to detect it or a different gene is involved
in their development of OCD."
The discovery of this gene could reveal a possible target for devel
oping treatments for this disorder.
Risks of smoking worse than thought

New studies by the American Cancer Society
paint a grimmer portrait of cigarette smoking than
ever. According to the newly published study, mor
tality risks associated with cigarette smoking, espe
cially among women, are substantially greater today
than they were as presented in the 1964 Surgeon
General's report.
The analysis compared two similar studies, one

initiated in 1959 and one in 1982. Risk for contracting most forms
of cigarette-related health problems increased significantly in the
later study. Smokers in the 1959 study were 12 times more likely
to die of lung cancer than nonsmokers, while smokers in the 1989
study were 23 times more likely to die.
Similarly, mortality risks for all other smoking-related disease
also increased in the later study. In statistical terms, relative risk
for all tobacco-linked cancers, including cancers of the larynx, oral
cavity, esophagus, bladder, kidney and pancreas, increased from
2.7 to 3.5 in male smokers and 1.8 to 2.6 among female smokers.
Risk for coronary heart disease also increased.
This increase in mortality risks occurred even as tar and nico
tine levels fell in most cigarettes. Since 1955, tar levels have
declined almost 70 percent while nicotine levels fell from 2.6 mg
per cigarette to under 0.9 mg. However, risks for smoking-related
deaths continue to increase.
David M. Burns, senior editor of the published report, indicat
ed that the increase was likely due to a greater lifetime dose of
cigarette smoke. Women in the recent study began smoking much
earlier, many in their teens.
Donald Shopland, coordinator of the National Cancer Insti
tute's Smoking and Tobacco Control Program emphasized that
these findings make clear the necessity of preventing adolescent
smoking. He also said death rates related to smoking could decline
in as little as five years if adults stopped smoking immediately.
