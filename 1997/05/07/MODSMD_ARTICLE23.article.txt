# Scientists research malaria vaccine
## Little is understood about malaria parasite life cycle 
### Ellen Licking 
Every 12 seconds, someone — usually a child
under 5 — dies from malaria. It's a major cause
of death in many developing countries, and that
makes the malaria parasite one of the most
important human pathogens.
One-third of the world's population lives in
regions where malaria is endemic. In Africa and
India, increased incidence of malaria is linked to
the parasite's resistance to chloroquinine, for
merly the drug of choice for treating blood-stage
parasites. Efforts to eliminate the Anopheles
mosquito, the parasite's insect carrier, have
been stymied by its resistance to most pesticides.
Currently, there is no effective vaccine against
the parasite.
These disturbing facts have resulted in a
growing international awareness of the malaria
problem. Agencies like the World Health Orga
nization, the World Bank and the U.S. National
Institutes of Health are joining forces to coordi
nate and attract new funding for malaria
research.
In January, representatives from research
facilities and foundations met in Dakar, Sene
gal, to outline their plan for a science-based
approach to malaria control. Vaccine develop
ment, creation of new anti-malarials and a bet
ter understanding of the parasite's lifecycle
were subjects of major discussion.
In humans, malaria is caused by four differ
ent species of protozoa. These single-celled
microorganisms are highly evolved parasites
with a complicated two-stage life cycle.
When an infected mosquito bites a human, it

introduces small elongated cells called sporo
zoites into the person. The sporozoites are car
ried from the bloodstream to the liver, where
they undergo multiple divisions, segmenting
into hundreds of cells called merozoites.
When the merozoites rupture the liver cell,
they enter the bloodstream and invade the
body's red blood cells. Successive generations of
merozoites appear at regular intervals in this
stage of the cycle.
The characteristic malarial symptoms
become manifest when the red cells rupture.
Typically, infected individuals suffer high fevers
followed by periods of chills and profuse sweat
ing. The fevers occur when a new brood of
merozoites is released from the red cells.
Of the different malarial parasites, Plasmod
ium falciparum is the most virulent. That
species can infect red cells of all ages, resulting
in higher levels of parasitemia and more severe
anemia than the other malarial parasites.
After one or more cycles of asexual reproduc
tion in the red cells, some of the merozoites dif
ferentiate into gametocytes, a cell type which
can only infect mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an
infected individual and ingests some of these
gametocytes, the parasite begins the second,
sexual stage of its life cycle.
In the confines of the mosquito stomach,
male and female games, the mature forms of
the gametocytes, fuse to make a zygote. Subse
quently, hundreds of spindle-shaped sporo
zoites form. These cells can be innoculated into
another person to begin the cycle again.
A major question confronting researchers
and clinicians is: Can an effective vaccine be

designed? Because the parasite differentiates
into several cell types during its life cycle, it is
difficult for the body to mount a successful
immune response.
For the purposes of vaccine development,
"This makes malaria a tremendous intellectual
challenge," said Health Research and Policy
Prof. Paul Basch.
In addition, multiple strains of each species
of parasite exist, and exposure to one form does
not necessarily confer immunity to other
forms.
Thus, a person infected with P. falciparum
strain A is still susceptible to other P. falci
parum strains. As Asst. Infectious Diseases
Prof. Jose Gilberto Montoya noted, "No one is
ever immune to all malaria strains. If exposure
to one form of the parasite doesn't result in
total immunity to malaria, how can we design
an effective vaccine?"
One of the stumbling blocks in vaccine
design is the current lack of understanding of
the parasite's life cycle. Assoc. Microbiology and
Immunology Prof. Kasturi Haldar is trying to
change this. Her laboratory is trying to under
stand the specialized host-parasite relationship
which develops in the red blood cell.
Because the red cell is a highly specialized
cell with no cellular machinery of its own, it is
an unusual choice for infection. Although red
cells are a great place to hide from the body's
immune response, they lack a transport system
that could be used by the parasite to obtain nec
essary nutrients. In order to sustain itself, the
parasite must find a way to import materials
from the bloodstream into the red cell and
across its own membrane.
How does the parasite solve this dilemma?
From Haldar's work, it is clear that the parasite
has developed a novel mechanism of import, one
that requires the formation of a membranous
network of tubules that extends from the para
site to the red cell's membrane. During the early
stages of red blood-cell infection, the parasite
extrudes a portion of its Golgi, a membranous
organelle involved in protein secretion, into the
red blood cell.
This secretion step is essential for the forma
tion of the interconnected tubule network. The
parasite uses this unusual structure to import
amino acids and essential nucleotide building
blocks called purines and pyrimidines.
Haldar hopes that this finding may aid in the
development of new antimalarial drugs. "This is
an important step with respect to the pathology
of the disease," she said. "If we can selectively
block import we may better control the para
site."
Both Haldar and Basch show cautious opti
mism about the eventual development of a vac
cine. "Malaria is an all-encompassing problem,"
Basch said. "It is very much a social and political
issue. The disease used to be problem in the U.S.
and isn't any longer because we have the eco
nomic means to manage our environment. That
isn't the case in Africa," He hopes that "with
enough understanding, something can be done."
Although Haldar believes that the current
research climate will promote positive change,
"we must be realistic" she cautioned. "We must
not squander our resources. Given the sheer
magnitude of the problem, we must be careful.
The target population [of malaria) is very vul
nerable — they are just little kids."
