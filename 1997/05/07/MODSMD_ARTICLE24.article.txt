# Fighting cancer with ultrasound
## 
### Kristin Weidenbach 
King Li, an assistant professor
of radiology, and Mark Bednarski,
a visiting scholar in the Depart
ment of Radiology, have developed
a prototype method for the finely
targeted delivery of large
molecules to bodily tissues.
They achieved this by making
the walls of blood vessels "leaky"
at a chosen site so macromolecular
agents such as drugs can be deliv
ered to a specific area.
Using a combination of ultra
sound and magnetic resonance
imaging, exquisite targeting can be
achieved.
Ultrasound uses high frequency
sound waves to pinpoint a target.
MRI, a scanning technique that
uses a magnetic field and radio sig
nals to create images, allows you to
visualize the target.
Without MRI as a guide, it is
impossible to know what the ener
gy from the ultrasound will hit.
Li's group is the first to com
bine MRI and ultrasound in this

way, calling it "shake and bake."
Li's group shakes the cells; moving
them in to position, in contrast to
the conventional therapy which is
to bake; burning the target tissue
and killing cells.
In the shake method, gaps form
between the endothelial cells that
form the lining of small blood ves
sels. With the correct dose of ultra
sound a transient gap will appear.
Macromolecules, in this case
liposomes, slip through the gaps,
which then close, trapping the
liposome on the other side of the
endothelial barrier within the tis
sue rather than in the circulation.
Instead of increasing the gener
al dose in the hope that some of it
will find its intended target, this
method allows researchers to
increase the concentration of lipo
somes at a specific site.
This new finding may help doc
tors treating cancer patients
increase the local concentration of
therapeutic agents in the tissues
where they are needed.
At the moment, injected lipo

somes are serving as the macro
molecule while the method is
being tested. These control lipo
somes carry an internal metal
marker.
These markers serve as controls
for the researcher to check the
localization of the ultrasound dur
ing the procedure and the final
accumulation of liposomes within
the tissue.
It is the ultimate goal of these
researchers to replace the proto
type liposomes with liposomes car
rying chemotherapeutic agents.
Anti-cancer drugs, for example,
could then be delivered exactly to
the tissues where they are needed,
sparing surrounding cells and
bodily tissues from toxic side
effects.
Drug companies are particular
ly interested in this method of
potential drug delivery.
Although the preliminary
results are very promising, Li
stressed that the research has a
long way to go before the method
will be used on human subjects.
