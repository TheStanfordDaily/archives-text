# SOUND MEDICINE
## 
### 
In one proposed focused
ultrasound treatment,
drug- filled liposomes
injected into the
bloodstream would travel
through a liny blood
vessel inside diseased
tissue

Ultrasound waves would
be aimed at the tissue,
jiggling the cells forming
the wall o! the blood
vessel

Tiny gaps would open in
the blood vessel's wall,
allowing the liposomes to
leak out into the
surrounding tissue.

The gaps would close
within a mailer of hours
Happing the liposomes
exactly where doctors
need the medic me to do
lis work.
