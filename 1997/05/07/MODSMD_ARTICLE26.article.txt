Q: Are canker sores contagious ?
A: When questions like this
come to me, I must once again
stop to appreciate the immense
responsibilities that come with
being the Bug.
I mean, what if I were to give
the wrong answer? What if I
were to eay that canker sores
are not contagious when they
actually are? I could be the sole
cause of a huge canker-sore out
break as people everywhere kiss
with impunity.
Or what if I said the oppo
site? It might lead crazy
sociopath to go on a kissing
rampage each time he develops
a canker sore. It's not some
thing to be considered lightly, I
tell you.
Having said that, you have to
realize that no one really under
stands why canker sores devel
op or what causes them. So as
you read the rest of this article,
take it with a grain of salt â€” it
might just turn out to be wrong,
and I don't want to be responsi
ble for any catastrophes.

Speaking of salt, many peo
ple think that putting raw salt
on a canker sore helps it to heal.
I can't imagine why people
would think that something
that causes immediate, intense
physical pain could help, but
just to be safe, I'll tell you that
salt has not been shown to help.
In fact, aggravating a canker
sore usually increases the time
it takes to heal and augments
the chance of infecting the sore.
Other irritants, such as abra
sive food particles, your tooth
brush and acidic or spicy foods
are equally detrimental.

If your parents have
canker sores, then
you have a 90-
percent chance of
developing them
early on in life.
Women are also
twice as likely to get
canker sores as
men.

On the other hand, a mild
solution of salt water can be
beneficial in soothing the sore.
Mouthwash, weakly acidic
drinks like tea and not poking it
constantly are good things for a
canker sore.
Just leaving it alone and
keeping it clean can help a
canker sore heal and prevent
infection.
If you get a lot of canker
sores, don't worry too much.
Almost evervone gets them at

some time and some people just
tend to get them much more
often than others.
Don't feel helpless, however.
There are some factors that do
seem to increase the propensity
of getting canker sores, and
they are factors you might be
able to change.
For instance, stress has been
linked to a higher incidence of
canker sores. In one study of
college students, canker sores
were much more likely to form
during exam week than at other
times during the year.
Some foods and allergies can
also cause outbreaks of canker
sores.
There are also some factors
which will predispose you to
getting canker sores that you
can't change. If your parents
have canker sores, then you
have a 90-percent chance of
developing them early on in
life.
Women are also twice as like
ly to get canker sores as men.
It's probably a hormonal thing,
but no one really knows why.
It has been determined,
though, that canker sores are
not viral or bacterial. This
means that no, they have not
been shown to be contagious.
Researchers think that more
likely, canker sores are related
to the immune system. It is
probably an autoimmune reac
tion, where your immune sys
tem makes a goof-up and
attacks some of your own cells
instead of defending against
foreign germs.
So the bad news is that there
is really nothing you can do to
stop canker sores from recur
ring, but at least you'll know it
didn't come from any of your
friends. The good news is that
you can blame your parents.
