## From walkon unknown to star shortstop Pecci proves naysayers wrong 
### Allison Otto Contributing writer 
Jay Pecci shifts his stance, still gaz
ing intently at home plate. He punches
his glove several times, anticipating
the ball that rockets toward him for an
easy-out throw to second.
As the starting shortstop for the
Stanford baseball team, Pecci, a junior
majoring in philosophy, poses a con
stant threat to the opposing team, a
threat that has steadily increased since
he first arrived on the Farm in the fall
of 1994.
Currently one of the top defensive
in fielders in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, it's hard to believe
that at the beginning of the soft-spoken
Pecci's freshman year, nobody had
heard of him — not even head coach
Mark Marquess.
"He was kind of reluctant to let me
try out," Pecci said. "He didn't want to
waste my time ... or maybe his."
As one of the top-ranked baseball
universities in the nation and one that
regularly recruits the majority of its
players, Marquess' reluctance seems
understandable.
Pecci persisted, however, asking

'He was kind ofreluctarrt

or maybe his.'

Marquess to give him an opportunity
to demonstrate his skill.
"I knew I had to play," Pecci said.
Ultimately, Marquess agreed to give
the unknown from Novato, Calif., a
chance.
As the only walk on during fall try
outs, Pecci played several positions, in
cluding shortstop and third base. He
also stood out as a switch-hitter, a ca
pability he first developed in family
games held in the backyard. He is now
Stanford's lone switch-hitter in the
starting nine.
Throughout the tryouts, family and
friends remained supportive. They
knew, however, the relative impossi
bility of walking on to such a presti
gious team.
"I'd call them every night and give
them updates on how I was doing,"
Pecci said. "I'd have to talk to each one
separately. Sometimes they would all
get on the line."
Junior Albert Lin, Pecci's freshman
roommate, clearly recalled Pecci's re
solve during the tryout process.
"He seemed pretty confident about
his skills as a baseball player," Lin
said. "I was really proud of him."
Pecci's consistency and determina
tion began to pay off.
"It seemed like . . . everything I did,
the coach liked it," Pecci said. He con
tinued to be called back to practice and

eventually earned a permanent spot on
the roster.
During his freshman year, Pecci ap
peared in 26 games, including 13
starts. He committed just two errors in
53 chances and earned a .962 fielding
percentage.
As a sophomore, he started the sea
son as a utility man, playing several po
sitions, but by April he had worked his
way into the starting lineup. He start
ed in 28 games and appeared in a total
of 50.
Traditionally a defensive player,
Pecci's offensive skills have soared this
season. He was hitting .306 with three

home runs and 23 RHIs prior to yester
day's game.
"Jay can play anything," Marquess
said. "He's one of the keys to our
team."
Pecci remains modest about his ac
complishments. He continues to keep
guard at shortstop, steadfast and pre
pared, consistently diving for balls and
coming up with plays integral to the
game. The freshman who walked on
into Cardinal baseball as an unknown
will walk off as a player for the Stan
ford record books.
Pecci has perhaps saved the best
play for last.
