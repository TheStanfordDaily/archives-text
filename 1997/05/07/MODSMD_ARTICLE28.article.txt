# Athletes of the Week

### 
Senior outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer has actually
been performing at his typically outstanding level all year.
Fuerbringer, only the second man in NCAA history to be a
four-time All-American, started off his week by helping
lead the Cardinal past Ball State in the Final Four last
Thursday by leading the team in hitting at .462, racking up
15 kills and adding a perfect service record for the match
with one ace and no errors. While his overall performance
in the title match against was not quite as brilliant,
his single solo block was the decisive point of the match and
season, giving Stanford its first NCAA championship.

Sophomore hurlor Marcy Crouch (14-11) gave new defini
tion to the term "workhorse" going the distance in three
games over four days when Stanford needed it the most.
Against California, Crouch kept the Hears at bay, allowinga
single run in the Card's 2-1 win. Against No. 24 Washing
ton, Crouch did more than go the distance, pitching nine
shutout innings against the Huskies before giving up a pair
of runs in the 10th and losing a 2-0 heartbreaker. Against
San Diego State, Crouch again pitched nine shutout in
nings, this time earning a 1-0 victory over the Aztecs. Over
the week, Crouch posted an 0.95 ERA for the Card.
