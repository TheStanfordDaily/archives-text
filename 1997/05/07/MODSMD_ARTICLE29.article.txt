# Spartans slam Card with five-run fifth
## No.2 Sluggers upset by San Jose State 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
In a season with more than 50 games,
teams are bound to have an off day. Bet
ter for that day to come in a Tuesday
non-conference game than in a champi
onship series.
Last night the San Jose State Spar
tans (38-19) surprised No. 2 Stanford
(37-14), burying the Cardinal 14-5 in
Municipal Stadium.
In an unusually poor all-around per
formance, the Card had one of its worst
outings and lost its first Tuesday game
of the season in 10 tries. While Stanford
appeared flat, the Spartan squad was
fired up, fighting for a postseason ap
pearance of its own. Crushing the No. 2
team in the nation can only have helped
its cause.
The combination of timely Spartan
hitting and shaky Stanford pitching led
to a four-run fourth inning and a disas
trous nine-run fifth inning.
Senior first baseman Luke Quaccia
put Stanford on the board early, sending
a shot over the right-field fence for a
two-run home run in the second inning.
In the bottom of the fourth, up 3-0,
Stanford sophomore lefty Tony Cogan
took the mound for the Card after the
Spartans loaded the bases off junior
starter Josh Koons.
Cogan, entering yesterday's game
with the lowest ERA in the Six Pac at

2.20, did not receive a pleasant greeting.
After entering the game with a 2-0
count, Cogan worked the count full.
Then he made one bad pitch — and paid
for it.
San Jose catcher Steve Ashley
jumped on the pitch, driving it over the
center-field fence for a grand slam.
With one swing of the bat, Ashley
gave the Spartans the lead, and in the
blink of an eye, Cogan's ERA soared
more than half a point, from 2.20 to
2.91. Cogan picked up the loss for Stan
ford, falling to 7-2.
The Card regrouped and battled back
with a run in the top of the fifth, tying
the game at 4-4. But the Spartans, still
riding the momentum of the grand slam,
again returned to the plate aggressive.
In an inning even uglier than the fourth,
the Cardinal gave up nine runs, the
most it has in a single inning all season,
and allowed 13 Spartans to come to the
plate.
Tony James tagged Stanford for a
three-run double, and Antonio Vazquez
contributed a thrro-run triple of his
own. Cogan, junior Adam Harris and
freshman Brian Fearnow all made ap
pearances during the deadly fifth in
ning. Sophomore Justin Dunning made
his debut in the eighth inning, and
sophomore Cameron Newton closed out
the game for the Cardinal.
Unable to regroup from the or
deal, Stanford only scored one
more run in the eighth inning on
an RBI single by freshman
Stephen Chan, his second hit of
the season.
Junior catcher Jon Schaeffer,
the Six-Pac player of the week for
the past two weeks, kept his 13-
game hitting streak alive, going 1
for 2. The only Cardinal with
more than one hit was freshman
designated hitter John Gall, who
went 2 for 3 with a pair of singles.
Spartan pitcher Javier Pamus
(6-4) picked up the win in a bril
liant outing. Pamus relieved
starter Jason Jimenez for the
final six innings, giving up only
four hits. The Spartans closed
their regular season with a home
record to 26-6 while Stanford's
road mark fell to 14-6.
Senior first baseman Robert
Berns broke the school's 19-year
old standard for hits in a season
with 93 on a two-out, first-inning
single.
Stanford will return to action
Friday needing to win one of three
at UCLA to win the Six-Pac and
earn the right to host the Pac-10
Championship Series next week
end against Washington or Ore
gon State.
