# Senate sets up independent endowment fund
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
To the applause of those in the
chamber last night, the ASSU Senate
monumentally redefined the structure
of its business projects and the $5.8
million in its custody.
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall,
in what he called his "legacy to Stan
ford," authored the proposal to separate
Stanford Student Enterprises from the
main body of the ASSU and place it
under the operational control of a semi
autonomous board of directors. The pro
posal will also establish a permanent,
self-perpetuating endowment to fund
the activities of the senate and president.

"I've been here for seven years,"
Ilall said, urging senators to support
his proposal. "I think that once in a
while, the ASSU grows up and does
something good for the students and
for Stanford."
The endowment, totaling $2.8 mil
lion, consists of the retained earnings
of SSE business projects, student ser
vice enterprises that include Lecture
Notes and Sunday Flicks. The fund will
be maintained by its own returns and
by the annual operating surplus of
SSE.
According to Hall, the new arrange
ment will maintain the ASSIJ's finan-
cial independence and protect the
endowment from lawsuits against
SSE. Concerns over both issues
have surfaced in recent years.
Four years ago, during a series
of Stanford budget cuts, the Uni
versity phased out its financial
support of the ASSU.
"Two-thirds of our operating

budget came from the University
before the budget cuts, and in just
four years, that's dried up," Hall
said.
The proposal also provides a
layer of security to safeguard the
funds; if SSE were sued, it would
be more difficult for a plaintiff to
claim the endowment as dam
ages.
The new board of directors
would initially be made up of two
senators, the ASSU president, the
financial manager, the associate

financial manager, University
representatives and professional
business people.
The board will provide profes
sional advice and oversight for the
multimillion-dollar collection of
businesses.
"We had originally intended to
incorporate to limit liability, but
after talking with University
General Counsel Mike Roster, we
decided not to because of the com
plicated tax implications," Hall
said.

Stanford undertook a similar
arrangement when it made the
Stanford Management Co. a semi
autonomous organ within the
University.
The senate, however, will
maintain oversight control over
SSE. The senate must approve
the appointments of all board
members and all changes in the
corporate charter.
According to Hall, however,
the changes will not actually af
fect the way SSE operates on a

day-to-day basis and will not
change its relationship to stu
dents or the University.
"This enshrines a lot of the
things we have been doing by ne
cessity since the University's bud
get cuts," Hall said.
The remaining $3 million in
the ASSU's control, made up of
deposits of student organizations,
reserves of special-fee groups and
the operating capital of SSE busi
nesses, will still be managed by
SSE.
