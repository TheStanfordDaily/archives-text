# Golf falters at Pac-10s
## 
### Brian W. Lee Editorial staff 
After a rough second-day setback, the
Stanford men's golf team moved up a spot
into fifth place but remains basically out of
contention at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Eugene, Ore.
With three scores in the HOs, the Cardinal
in striking distance of the lead just one
clay earlier — posted a 17-over-par 377 that
left it in leader Arizona State's wake. The
seventh-ranked Sun Devils pulled away
from the rest of the field with an amazing 8-
under-par 352.
"Some days you are just on, and ASIJ was
definitely on today," said freshman Dusty
Brett. "They just went out and took care of
business."
Individually, sophomore Joel Kribel fired
a 69 to improve to 5-under par and croep into
third place, four strokes behind third-round
leader Chad Wright of USC. Kribel is looking
for a repeat performance of last week's U.S.
Invitational, where he stormed from behind
on the final day to run away with the title.
"Obviously, we're all backing Joel 100
percent to win, even if the team isn't doingso
well as a whole" Brett said. Last year's indi

vidual crown also went to Stanford, with
Tiger Woods demolishing the Held hy an un
heard of 14 strokes en route to the champi
onship and a new course record.
Also in contention is senior Conrad Ray,
who shot a 74, but still remains 1 under and
in a three-way tie for seventh place with Cal
ifornia's .Jay Berkowitz and Arizona's Kory
Sabbatini.
Freshmen Dusty Brett and Michael
Wiemer were stung by a pair of 80s and fell
into ties for .'l2nd and 45th, respectively.
Sophomore Scott Wang continued to strug
gle, scoring a 10-over-par 82 and dropping
into fifitli place. A lone bright spot in the bot
tom half of the lineup, senior Pete Ligotti
pulled his game together to notch a 74 after
a very disappointing first day (84-79).
"Nothing was really wrong; some of us
just played really badly," Brett said. "Three
of our guys did pretty well, hut with the rest
of us, I don't know.
"The problems are all spread out. Kvery
guy knows what his own problems are; it's
just a matter of working them out and trying
to redeem ourselves" today.
The tournament's fourth and final round
will be played today at the Eugene Country
Club.
