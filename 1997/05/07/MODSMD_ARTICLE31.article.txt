# Solar car sets sights on taking Sunrayce

Big Game, Big Row and Big
Swim. If the California and Stan
ford solar air teams squared off on
the track, maybe it'd be called Big
Race.
It's a moot point at best, because
solar car racing is the only sport in
which the Golden Bears aren't the
mortal enemy — they're part of the
team.
"To Ik; honest, we've only got
one Cal student on the team, but
he's super," said driver Brandon
Stafford, a graduate student. "A
ample Cal alums help us out a lot,
Uk)."
The Stanford Solar Car Project
aims to design, build and race a ve
hicle constructed largely of carbon
fiber and powered by low-grade
solar cells.
"The cells are restricted to $ 10
per watt to prevent rich teams from
simply outspending others,"
Stafford said. "The cells are pretty
weak, though, with only 14-15-per
cent efficiency.
"Sunpower cells, the best out
there, have alKnit 23-percent effi
ciency."
Entering its seventh year, the
project has quietly made a name for
itself within the racing community,
finishing fifth, seventh and fifth, re
spectively, over the last three Sun
rayces, biannual cross-country
races that serve as the Ameriam
championship of the sport. This
year's eighth-ranked Cardinal
cruised through Western regional
qualifiers late last month in Mesa,
Ariz., to secure a spot in next

month's Sunrayce '97, which will
trace a line from Indianapolis to
Colorado Springs.
Sunrayce will move in one-day
stages, in which each air is given
eight hours to reach a predeter
mined station. Because the battery
in each car is charged hy solar
power, the teams are limited to the
daylight hours to refuel. The sooner
a car arrives at the finish station for
the day, the longer it has to sit in the
sun and recharge.
"(letting to the end of the stage
in good time is key," Stafford said.
'"We're totally working around the
sunset.
"The reliability of the car will l>e
important too. It's a nine-day race,
and winning fine stage won't Ik;
enough if your car breaks down for
the next one."
Wliile Stanford's program is
highly regarded, defending champ
MI T's car is the one everyone will
Ik; gunning for. (Jeorge Washington
is another Kast Coast team that the
Card will have to overcome to take
the title.
Although the team has its sights
set on the summer, it may have to
step back first. At regional quali
fiers, the team met the necessary
marks to advance easily. Needing to
run more than 100 miles over eight
hours, the team was able to com
plete 40 laps over the; 56-lap mini
mum requirement on the 1.8-mile
track of the CM Proving Grounds.
The final hour, the air was battling
for a pole position at Sunrayce with
Missouri's entry but fell one lap
short of the Tigers' 97 However, all
of this may become moot due to re
cent modifications on the solar-cell
array of the car.
"We may have to redo it at the
last-chance qualifiers," Stafford
said. "We were using an old array
and an old motor system, so when
we change those things, we'll have
a pretty different car.
"The rules are a little sketchy,
and we'll have a better idea of what
the situation is later on."
The team is accustomed to deal
ing with surprise obstacles, howev
er. At the World Solar Challenge
last summer in Australia, the Stan
ford car encountered major diffi
culties, leaving the Cardinal 25th
of 33 teams.
"We had some motor controller
problems," Stafford said. "The
gear would shift into reverse every
time we hit a certain speed.

"As you can imagine, that
slowed us down a bit."
In all likelihood, the team
should requalify for Sunrayce at
the last-chance qualifiers if Stan
ford so needs. The Cardinal's
hopes of winning the title lie large
ly in the level to which the drivers,
graduate student Dorian West, ju
nior Forrest Deuth, freshman
Judy Liebman and Stafford can
become comfortable with the mod
ified car.
The team also hopes to draw
strength from the diversity of the
team, which provides a unique
blend of experience and unbiased
enthusiasm.
"We really formed a core of 15 or
so after Arizona, and I really like
the mix we have," Stafford said.
"We need people like Dorian, peo
ple who have a lot of race experi
ence.
"But at ihe same time, the new
people help balance the team in
what is typically a high-burnout ac
tivity."
