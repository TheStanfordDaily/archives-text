# Solar car sets sights on taking Sunrayce

Big Game, Big Row and Big
Swim. If the California and Stan
ford solar air teams squared off on
the track, maybe it'd be called Big
Race.
It's a moot point at best, because
solar car racing is the only sport in
which the Golden Bears aren't the
mortal enemy â€” they're part of the
team.
"To Ik; honest, we've only got
one Cal student on the team, but
he's super," said driver Brandon
Stafford, a graduate student. "A
ample Cal alums help us out a lot,
Uk)."
The Stanford Solar Car Project
aims to design, build and race a ve
hicle constructed largely of carbon
fiber and powered by low-grade
solar cells.
"The cells are restricted to $ 10
per watt to prevent rich teams from
simply outspending others,"
Stafford said. "The cells are pretty
weak, though, with only 14-15-per
cent efficiency.
"Sunpower cells, the best out
there, have alKnit 23-percent effi
ciency."
Entering its seventh year, the
project has quietly made a name for
itself within the racing community,
finishing fifth, seventh and fifth, re
spectively, over the last three Sun
rayces, biannual cross-country
races that serve as the Ameriam
championship of the sport. This
year's eighth-ranked Cardinal
cruised through Western regional
qualifiers late last month in Mesa,
Ariz., to secure a spot in next

month's Sunrayce '97, which will
trace a line from Indianapolis to
Colorado Springs.
Sunrayce will move in one-day
stages, in which each air is given
eight hours to reach a predeter
mined station. Because the battery
in each car is charged hy solar
power, the teams are limited to the
daylight hours to refuel. The sooner
a car arrives at the finish station for
the day, the longer it has to sit in the
sun and recharge.
"(letting to the end of the stage
in good time is key," Stafford said.
'"We're totally working around the
sunset.
"The reliability of the car will l>e
important too. It's a nine-day race,
and winning fine stage won't Ik;
enough if your car breaks down for
the next one."
Wliile Stanford's program is
highly regarded, defending champ
MI T's car is the one everyone will
Ik; gunning for. (Jeorge Washington
is another Kast Coast team that the
Card will have to overcome to take
the title.
Although the team has its sights
set on the summer, it may have to
step back first. At regional quali
fiers, the team met the necessary
marks to advance easily. Needing to
run more than 100 miles over eight
hours, the team was able to com
plete 40 laps over the; 56-lap mini
mum requirement on the 1.8-mile
track of the CM Proving Grounds.
The final hour, the air was battling
for a pole position at Sunrayce with
Missouri's entry but fell one lap
short of the Tigers' 97 However, all
