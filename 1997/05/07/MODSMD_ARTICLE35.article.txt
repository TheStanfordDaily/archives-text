### Catherine Quinones Contributing writer 
When English and Jewish Studies Prof.
John Felstiner returned a mysterious message
on his voice mail two weeks ago, he received a
pleasant surprise.
"Have you heard of the Truman Capote
Award?" asked Frank Conroy, the University
of lowa's creative writing director. "Well,
you've just won it."
That is how Felstiner learned that his biog
raphy and critical study of the poet Paul Celan
— "Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew" — had
won the 1997 Truman Capote Award for liter
ary criticism.
The award was originally founded in memo
ry of controversial literary critic Newton
Arvin. Felstiner will go to lowa this weekend to
accept the award, which is accompanied by a
$50,000 check.
Felstiner said the honor was a complete sur
prise because he did not even know that his
book had been nominated. The panel of six
judges that voted on his book — what Felstin-

er calls a "literary critic'a dream team" — in
cluded Seamus Heaney, Henry Louis Gates,
Geoffrey Hartman, Frank Kermode, Denis
Donoghue and Elizabeth Hardwick.
"For about 24 hours, I felt like I was living
approximately a 1/4 inch away from my real
self," Felstiner said. "There was my real self
and then a 1/4 inch away was this person that
won the award, and I couldn't make the two
figures coincide."
He added that he really didn't think about
the award as much as he did about his book. "It
was about 16 years of my life. It just became
tantamount to my life," he said.
Felstiner said he felt vindicated. "It was a
terribly hard book to write, and it's a very prob
lematic question that I'm going at in the book,"
he said.
Celan was born in Romania in 1920 and lost
"everything there was to lose except his life,"
Felstiner said. Celan wrote poetry after the
war. He committed suicide in 1970.
"He wrote poetry in German, and I'm a
translator," Felstiner said, "so I was gripped
by the possibility of translating him into Eng-

lish, which is another way of making him ac
cessible."
Felstiner first became interested in Celan in
1977 when he was teaching a Stanford class
called "Literature and the Holocaust," in
which he had used some of Celan's work. Dur
ing this time, he said he "realized that I just
had to make my way through his poetry and his
life instead of going around it or above it. I just
had to go through it."
According to Felstiner's colleagues, the
award was a natural result of his scholarship.
"It's wonderful that he won the prize, but it's
hardly surprising," said English Prof. Marjorie
Perloff. "The book received superlative re
views from people like George Steiner" in the
Times Literary Supplement.
"I love Paul Celan so it's an important book
to me. He's one of the really major poets of the
20th century, so it's marvelous that John Fel
stiner took the time to research and write this
book," she added.
"It's wonderful and well-deserved. It's a
great book," said English Department Chair
Jay Fliegelman.
