### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
A series of public programs on
the work of William Saroyan this
week will celebrate the Stanford
University Libraries' acquisition
of the writer's literary archives.
The collection will be given for
mally to Stanford in a ceremony to
be held in Annenberg Auditorium
Saturday.
A son of Armenian immigrants
who published more than 4,000
literary works, Saroyan lived most
of his life in Fresno, San Francisco
and later in Paris.
The decision to move the
archives permanently to Stanford
was announced by the William
Saroyan Foundation last May.
The writer, who died in 1981, pre
ferred to keep all items together,
and Stanford was one of the few lo
cations that could host the entire
archive.
Thanks to the foundation's de
cision, "a series of activities have
been set in motion to assist and
promote the rebirth of interest in
Saroyan and his works," Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller said in
a press release.
"Saroyan's papers will provide
source materials for Stanford pro
fessors and students and in
evitably have already become a
draw for their counterparts in
other institutions," he added.
Starting Friday, items from

Saroyan's archives, including
books, manuscripts, correspon
dence and photographs will be on
display in an exhibit titled
"William Saroyan: The Times of
His Lives," in the lobby of Green
Library.
The exhibition was selected by
William McPherson, William
Saroyan curator of American and
British literature. It will focus on
several aspects of the writer's life,
including his Fresno apprentice
ship, literary success, stint in the
army, books for children and rela
tionship to Armenia.
The libraries seek to give people
a better understanding of Saroyan
and his work, said Sarah
Williamson, director of communi
cations for University libraries.
Saroyan received an Oscar for
best original story for the 1943
film "The Human Comedy" and a
Pulitzer Prize for his 1939 play
"The Time of Your Life." Films
based on his works will be shown
in a free screening tomorrow in the
Stanford Humanities Center
annex.
According to Williamson,
Saroyan was "a very prolific
writer" whose works appeared in a
variety of media.
In addition, associates of le
Stanford University libraries will
give a public reading of Saroyan s
stories Friday afternoon in front of
