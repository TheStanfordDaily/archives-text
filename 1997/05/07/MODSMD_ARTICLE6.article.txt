# False alarm set off by arsine gas near CIS

An oversensitive alarm system sounded
for about three hours at the Center for inte
grated Systems yesterday afternoon, prompt
ing the blockade of several main streets on
the west side of campus.
According to Palo Alto Fire Department
Public Information Officer Tony Spitaleri,
the gas leakage indication was due to the low
calibration of the alarm system. Alarms at
the center are often intentionally set at ex
tremely low levels to ensure the safety of
those who work there.
For example, if a gas threatened human
safety at five parts per billion in the atmos
phere, the alarms would be set to go off at a
level that was fewer than 2.5 parts per billion.
An extremely low level of the poisonous
gas arsine triggered the alarm yesterday. The
amount released was negligible and posed no
threat, Spitaleri said.
"These alarms can go off at the slightest
indication," he said. "The alarms may need to
be recalibrated" to correct for this oversensi
tivity.
The alarm sounded at the center at 3:41
p.m. Faculty, staff and students working
there promptly self-evacuated. One man
complained of minor respiratory problems
and was taken to the Stanford Hospital lit;
was released later that afternoon, Spitaleri
said, with no complications.
Officials responding to the incident "had
to treat the situation as though there was a
possible leakage in the system," Spitaleri
said. This involved the dispatch of the Palo
Alto Fire Hazardous Materials unit to enter
the building with full protective gear and cm

ploy sniffers to assess the situation.
Parts of Serra Street and Via Ortega were
blocked off as crews worked to determine
whether a gas leakage had occurred.
Henry Chao, a materials science doctoral
student, said the evacuation was "pretty or

derly. Most of us thought it was a false
alarm," ho said.
"Usually, when this happens, tho alarm
only sounds for a few minutes. The fire de
partment comes to shut off the alarm, and
