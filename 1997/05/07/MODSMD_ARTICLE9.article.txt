## Officer convicted of raping six trainees sentenced to 25 years 
### 
ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND,
Md. (AP) — An Army drill sergeant who
faced life in prison for raping six trainees
was sentenced yesterday to 25 years in a
case that led to investigations of sexual
misconduct at U.S. military bases world
wide.
Staff Sgt. Delmar G. Simpson stood
calmly to hear his sentence and hugged his
mother, Edna, after it was imposed. He left
the courtroom with his arm around his
wife's shoulders.
His attorney, Frank J. Spinner, said he
will appeal the sentence in the case, which
has rekindled debate about whether the

Army should continue to mix men and
women in basic training.
Simpson's defense team blamed the ver
dict on false claims by the female trainees
— saying the sex was consensual — and
undue influence by top Army comman
ders. They also suggested racial bias played
a role, although race was barely mentioned
during the court-martial.
"If you're an African-American drill
sergeant in the Army, you're an endan
gered species," Spinner said. "If you're an
African-American drill sergeant, any
woman who you go behind closed doors
with can turn into a rape claim."

Simpson is black and most of his
accusers are white. Most of the drill
sergeants at Aberdeen, 30 miles northeast
of Baltimore, are black, as are 11 other
staff members charged with sexual mis
conduct.
The jury of two black men, three white
men and one white woman convicted
Simpson a week ago and took about 2 1/2
hours to reach a decision on his sentence
for 18 counts of rape and 29 other offenses,
mostly other forms of sexual misconduct.
The jury also ordered Simpson dishonor
ably discharged at the reduced rank of pri
vate, forfeiting all pay and pension benefits.

Maj. Gen. John E. Longhouser, com
mander of Aberdeen Proving Ground
where Simpson worked, must approve the
sentence. He may reduce it but not add to
it. The sentence also will be automatically
reviewed by the U.S. Army Court of Crim
inal Appeals.
Some women's advocates considered
the sentence lenient.
"If he were a civilian, he would not be
sentenced to 25 years. He would be consid
ered a serial rapist and would receive life in
prison," said retired Air Force Lt. Col.
Karen Johnson, vice president of the
National Organization for Women.

Others said the verdict sent a message
that the military won't tolerate sexual mis
conduct.
"This should be a flare in the night,"
said Lt. Col. Gabriel Riesco, chief of staff
for the school at Aberdeen. "Those
sergeants and instructors out there
trolling instead of training should think
twice."
The case prompted investigations into
sexual misconduct at U.S. military bases
worldwide. A sexual harassment hotline
set up by the Army last November
received more than 1,243 complaints by
late April.
