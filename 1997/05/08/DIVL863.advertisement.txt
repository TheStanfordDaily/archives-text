Published by Anchor Books
Thursday • May 8 *'7:30 P.M.
An aged and lonely blackjack dealer narrates his obsession with
Charlotte, a devout nineteen-year-old Mormon, whose arrival in
Wendover causes his strange but orderly life to unravel. Her
spiritual yearnings and longing for epiphany in the barren desert
town prompt a journey across the mysterious salt flats for Utah,
into an alien-infested ghost town, along The Stnp in las Vegas,
and finally into the city where the desert has bloomed, Salt Lake
City. Charlotte's elderly admirer follows, skulking on the
periphery until his quest for love ends in a conflagration
from which on one escapes undamaged.
Peter Rock currently holds a Wallace Stegner fellowship in
fiction at Stanford University and is the recipient of a 19%
Henfield Award. He lives in San Francisco.
