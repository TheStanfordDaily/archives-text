Hi! I'm Wendy Carter, your NIKE Student Rep. It's my job to

check in next fall. We'll be back on the lookout for new
sports to profile and exceptional non-varsity athletes who
deserve some press. Any visionaries out there with great
ideas they'd like to see on Sports Page in the future can
e-mail me at wendy.carter@nike.com .If you want to talk
to NIKE HQ directly, use: sports.page@nike.com.

Just as Jon Singer's high school sports career was taking off, a sudden
discovery put his future plans on hold. Singer's father—a doctor—heard
something strange while listening to Jon's heart The diagnosis aortic
insufficiency. Singer's heart had an aortic valve that was not closing proper
ly and allowed blood to leak back into the heart. Surgery was mandatory
Singer opted for a type of surgery that would allow him
to continue to play contact sports A skilled soccer and
tennis player, his dream was to play college soccer at
Stanford. In 1994, Singer underwent a double aortic valve
replacement. Last year, doctors installed a mechanical
valve in Singer's heart The second surgery ended his
soccer career
In its place, the Sophomore Human Biology major
found solace in swimming, an individual sport for which
the competitive urge was all his own Soon after that,
Singer began training for triathlons. He now trains nine
times a week, completing three workouts for each
triathlon event: running, swimming, and biking Swimming
is Singer's strongest leg, Jon is refining the other two
skills now, riding with the Stanford Cycling Club in the foothills behind
Stanford.
Singer enjoys being able to call himself an athlete again and knows he
can't take that privilege for granted. Most of all, though, he says he is
thankful for his family's unfailing support and encouragement
