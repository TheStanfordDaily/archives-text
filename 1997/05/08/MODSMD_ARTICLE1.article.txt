Four members of Stanford Project
on Nutrition sliced, diced, chopped and
mopped yesterday.
Senior Dave Murphy and juniors
Danielle Goldstone, Jennifer Royval
and Chris Lau were in the kit chen of El
liott Program Center heating frozen
pasta, preparing green beans, baking
ham and steaming rice for their new
trial program that serves free meals to
the homeless every Wednesday at the

University Lutheran Church.
According to Goldstone, Spoon's
main project constitutes collecting left
over food from residences across cam
pus, including dormitories, Row houses
and the Coffee House. The group then
donates the food to the Urban Min
istry's food program located in Palo
Alto.
The Urban Ministry is an umbrella
organization that participates in and
helps run many community service
events at local churches, including
meals for the homeless and career ad

vising, Goldstone said.
Milrphy, Spoon's operations manag
er, said the new effort is "designed to
fill in the gap of a meal in the Urban
Ministry's program." The Urban Min
istry does not provide meals on
Wednesdays.
During fall quarter, Spoon had pro
posed to establish a one-night-per
week program on campus to serve the
homeless. After talking with adminis
trators, it became apparent that an on
campus program wouldn't work.
"We talked with the head of security,

who presented concerns about trans
porting the homeless on and off campus
for the meal, as well as student con
cerns about bringing homeless people
on campus," Murphy said.
Spoon also talked with Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, who said "the idea
was not worth pursuing" because it
brought up so many concerns, among
others, about security and transporta
tion.
That meeting prompted Spoon to di-
rect its efforts towards finding a
suitable venue for providing food
off campus. "Our main goal for
this project is to serve the home
less meals on Wednesday, when
the Urban Ministry does not pro
vide meals as it does normally dur
ing t he week," Murphy said.
Currently, the group is in the
second week of a five-week trial

period, according to Spoon coordi
nators. The project began April 30
and will continue through May
21. About 15 people attended the
meal Spoon volunteers manned
last week; their goal is to have 30
people attend the Wednesday
meals.
Meals last from 5 to 6 p.m. and
are served cafeteria style, where
anybody is free to come in and sit
down for dinner. Spoon has dis
tributed fliers in Palo Alto and
Fast Palo Alto to publicize the
event and receives help from the

Urban Ministry to attract more
people.
After the five-week trial period
ends, Spoon will evaluate the situ
ation and decide the next step. If
they deem the project a success,
they will make the Wednesday
night dinner a permanent fixture.
"We are really trying to help the
homeless out, but we also hope to
make students on campus aware
of the homeless situation," Mur
phy said. "Hopefully, [University
Lutheran's] closeness to campus
will attract students to help."
