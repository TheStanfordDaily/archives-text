Chess champ, computer are even
NEW YORK (AP) — World chess champion
Garry Kasparov and his silicon nemesis, IBM's
Deep Blue computer, remained tied at 2 points
each yesterday after playing to a draw in Game 4
of their six-game series.
Kasparov offered the draw after the computer
made its 56th move of the five-hour match. The
machine immediately accepted. It was the second
straight day that the 34-year-old Russian and
Deep Blue finished in a deadlock.
Kasparov and the supercomputer split the first
two games of the match, played Saturday and
Sunday.
On Wednesday, the computer played white and
had the first move, an advantage sometimes com
pared to serving in tennis. As in the first three
games, Kasparov played cautiously at the outset,
seeking to avoid engagements that would allow

the computer to take advantage of its superior cal
culating skills.
Kasparov's Game 4 opening was a notable
departure from his traditionally aggressive open
ing strategy.
FDA approves laser dentistry
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans who dread
the dentist's drill may get less painful dental vis
its: The government approved the nation's first
laser to repair cavities yesterday — and the vast
majority of patients who tested it didn't require
local anesthesia.
Calling the system "medicine for the 21st centu
ry," the Food and Drug Administration approved
Premier Laser Systems' erbium-YAG laser for
treating tooth decay. The Irvine, Calif -based com
pany says the laser is appropriate for many of the
170 million cavities filled nationwide each year.
