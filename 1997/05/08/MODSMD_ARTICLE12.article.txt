# Bosnia war criminal convicted

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The U.N. war
crimes tribunal hailed its first conviction yesterday
as a step toward bringing to justice even greater cul
prits in Bosnia's genocide.
But for many, the conclusion of prison camp tor
turer Dusan Tadic's trial — the first by an interna
tional war crimes tribunal since World War II — only
underscored the trouble the international communi
ty has had in prosecuting the masterminds of
Bosnia's war.
While convicted of brutalizing prison camp
inmates, Tadic was acquitted of several of the most
serious counts against him, including murder. And
he is a small fish. Former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic are still free and prospering in postwar Bosnia
— even though the tribunal has indicted them.
Human-rights groups, Bosnian Muslims and for
eign leaderr greeted the 4-year-old tribunal's first
conviction with demands that Karadzic and Mladic
be brought to justice.
If the United States and others in the West fail to

do that, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch
warned, "this first effort at an international system
of justice since Nuremberg and Tokyo will fail."
"Tadic was a hand of the genocide, but the brains
Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic — are
still at large," said Mirza Hajric, a spokesman for the
Muslim president of Bosnia. "As long as they are
free, chances are small for the Dayton peace accord to
be implemented."
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal at The Hague
convicted Tadic, a reserve traffic officer and onetime
cafe owner, of brutalizing Muslims at three Serb-run
prison camps in 1992.
But it acquitted Tadic of 20 of 31 counts of war
crimes and crimes against humanity, acknowledging
that the evidence was too weak to make murder
charges stick.
Prosecutors are expected to appeal the acquittals,
claiming the judges imposed too strict a burden of
proof. In the absence of physical evidence, prosecu
tors had to rely almost exclusively on sometimes
sketchy witness testimony.
