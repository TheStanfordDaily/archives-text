Stanford must do more
for women's athletics
after they turn varsity

IT'S NOT SURPRISING to
know that Stanford often one
ups its ivy-covered East Coast
competitors. Certainly in the area
of gender equity among students it
has consistently done that — Stan
ford has been a coeducational uni
versity since its founding more
than 100 years ago; most other
elite schools only began to admit
women in the last generation.
So it similarly was not surprising
when earlier this month, the
Chronicle of Higher Education list
ed Stanford as one of the schools
that complies most successfully
with Title IX, the federal law man
dating equal allocation of funds for
men's and women's activities. Title
IX has most significantly impacted
athletic programs at high schools
and colleges around the country,
ensuring that women's teams
receive funding equal to men's.
Stanford's women's teams have
emerged this year as among the best
in the country, in many cases com
peting better than their male coun
terparts. Though the women's bas
ketball team didn't bring home the
NCAA title, they made it into the
Final Four, cheered along by an
enthusiastic student body and a
supportive Athletics Department.
Often at other schools athletic
departments choose to cut non-rev
enue generating women's and
men's sports teams when faced with
a budget crunch, in order to make
sure they are still complying with
Title IX. Athletic Director Ted
Leland has said that Stanford has
not had to cut programs in order to
comply with Title IX.
What's important to note,
though, is that Stanford's women's
athletics programs have succeeded
— and Stanford has been able to
comply so fully with Title IX — to a

large degree because of strong club
sports. Before the women's water
polo, lacrosse, synchronized swim
ming, softball, sailing, crew, soccer
and volleyball teams were "raised"
to the varsity level, they existed as
club sports.
Club teams allowed Stanford to
build strong women's teams before
those teams began competing at
the varsity level. The transition,
however, from club to varsity team
is not always easy.
A club sport is funded through
the Club Sports special fee, fees paid
by members of the team and
through other assorted fund-raising
activities. When a sport becomes
varsity, however, it no longer
receives that special-fee money — as
well it shouldn't. Furthermore, if
other varsity teams are not required
to do outside fund raising to obtain
enough money, it is ridiculous to
expect a club-turned-varsity team to
do so. In other words, although the
Club Sports program has provided
an excellent foundation for many
new varsity sports — especially
women's teams — once a team
moves to the varsity level it is the
Athletics Department's responsibil
ity to fund those teams as complete
ly as it funds already existing varsi
ty teams.
That said, it must also be recog
nized that even with the increased
number of varsity women's sports
teams, Stanford still has some room
for improvement. While women
represent 50 percent of the under
graduate population, they still make
up only 45 percent of the athletic
population. While this figure is sig
nificantly better than at many other
schools, it could still be improved.
Receiving positive publicity
about Title IX — or anything, for
that matter — is always good for the
University. However, just because
Stanford is doing a better job than
some schools in complying with
Title IX does not mean it should be
complacent. And strengthening
women's athletic programs will
carry on a century-long tradition of
leading the way on gender equality.
