Affirmative action has been lost in the tenure process

THE GRANTING OF tenure is not
a simple process by any means; to
deny that there are larger issues
involved is to willingly close one's eyes.
But that is exactly what Brad Heers did
in Tuesday's Daily when he responded
to our first letter.
Heers claims that we are "irresponsi
ble" when we "charge Stanford with
institutional racism and sexism in its
tenure decisions." But the facts tell us
that indeed we can.
The truth is that about 82 percent of
our professors are male, and 85 percent
of them are white. This disheartening
record places Stanford 19th out of 21
poor institutions (Harvard, Yale, MIT,
etc.). Don't blame the tenure process,
Heers might respond.
In terms of hiring and promotion in
the History Department, there have
been four women out of 17 decisions
approved by the deans in the past 15
years; in the seven interventions by the
deans to overturn, six have been women
and one a minority candidate. But the
fact is that Stanford values affirmative
action so little that it does not apply
affirmative action to the tenure process.
There is no other place to put the
blame. The Faculty Handbook tells us

that "Stanford University will not be
satisfied with good faith efforts in affir
mative action. . . . The only reliable
measure of our successes lies in the
results of these efforts." But the results
are damning.
Heers also says that the members of
our coalition "do not know the tenure
process in any detail." I don't know how
much Heers knows, but we have
researched the process quite intensively.
History tenure decisions are made on
the basis of the following criteria: (1)
the professor's teaching file, (2) the
support from the professor's depart
ment and (3) an academic review by
nationally prominent historians in the
field and an assessment of productivity.
We know for a fact that Asst. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak's teaching file is
extremely strong; her advisees, stu
dents and teaching assistants rave
about her. VV'e know that she has unan
imous support from her colleagues at
the History Department. This leaves
the last criterion — where input is sole
ly taken from people outside Stanford
— as the one by which the deans' advi
sory committee rejected Sawislak.
The committee's decision to turn
Sawislak away sends an alarmingly

strong signal not only of the Universi
ty's lack of commitment to women and
people of color but also of its disregard
of teaching and mentoring, the value of
which was so eloquently and movingly
expressed in Monday's Daily by Teri
Stein.
This is not to say that Sawislak's aca
demic record is anything but outstand
ing. In fact, History Prof. George
Fredrickson, current president of the
Organization of American Historians,
feels Sawislak will be the top historian
in her field in the next several years.
The deans' advisory committee, made
up of two science faculty, two social sci
ence faculty and two humanities faculty
(with no history representative), decid
ed otherwise.
Who is better equipped to judge Saw
islak's potential, the president of the
Organization of American Historians or
some professor specializing in, say,
social psychology or molecular biology?
Clearly there is a disjuncture in the
logic of this weighting process. In any
case, the committee's unmistakable
devaluation of the first two criterion
sends a powerful message to junior fac
ulty: Taking time to help and inspire
students and to contribute to Stanford's

intellectual life will not get you tenure;
cranking out journal articles will.
Put simply, Heers is wrong — we can
make a judgment on Sawislak's tenure
process, and the judgment is an incrim
inating one. You cannot isolate any one
case solely on its merits within a system
that has produced the results of Stan
ford's tenure record. By applying affir
mative action principles in hiring (and
retention through a pre-tenure period),
this system is buttressing a division of
labor between teaching and research
based on gender and ethnicity. Support
of ethnic, gender and academic diversity
in the university requires a commit
ment to pursuing diversity at every
level of the process.
The truth is that an unquestionably
academically qualified candidate was
unjustly denied tenure by a process that
raises doubts about both Stanford's
commitment to racial and gender equal
ity and its valuation of actual teaching
and mentoring.
