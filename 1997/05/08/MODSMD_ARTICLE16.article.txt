We are writing to clarify thi his
week in Stanford history" item latin
The Daily's April 30 issue. In it.the
Alpha Delta Phi Society was referred to
as a "now-defunct" fraternity.
That is not entirely true. After Stan
ford's Alpha Delta Phi chapter lost its
house in 1989 (now The Enchanted
Broccoli Forest), tin 1 fraternity decided
to admit women. Several other Alpha
Delta Phi chapters nationwide had done
so already, including those at Bowdoin

College, Columbia University, Middle
bun' College, Brown University and
Wesleyan University.
Thus, the coeducational Alpha Delta
Phi Literary Society was formed in 1992
The Stanford chapter now has 28 active
members. We hold bi-weekly literary
events and publish a magazine of origi
nal literature. Although the Alpha Holts
decided to break away from the Interfra
ternity Council, we are registered with
the Office of Student Activities and are
very much alive and active at Stanford.
