# Aspirant for ASSU top job wishes victors well
## 
### 
Tuesday night, the ASSU Senate cer
tified the election of Emily Andrus and
Ben Decker as ASSU president and vice
president. The independent Hearings
Committee found allegations that
Adrus and Decker's campaign had vio
lated the campaign spending limits to
be without merit. The election is now
over, and the winners deserve the full
support of the student body.
Sadly, through the controversy sur
rounding those allegations, the student

government completely froze in its
tracks. Andrus and Decker will need a
pood deal of help to accomplish the goals
they have set forth for themselves.
Since many of these goals were shared
by my campaign, I hope that our new
president and vice president will he suc
cessful in gaining student representa
tion on the Board of Trustees, improv
ing the quality of undergraduate teach
ing, streamlining the funding process
for student organizations, bringing
back the Big Game Bonfire and fighting
the University's alcohol policy.
