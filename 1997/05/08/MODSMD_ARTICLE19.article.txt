## When friends are helpful 
### 
Friends fuck around, if they
didn't, they wouldn't be friends. But
every so often, they see your wall of
tolerance and plow through it like a Rus
sian tank. The following is one such story.
I call this story "A Fucking Miracle,"
because it's a fucking miracle I ever sur
vived that night and made my flight. The
evening began simply enough: one joint
among five friends. A sticky, as my
friends like to call it. We toked up at 6:45,
two generous hours before that South
west Boeing 737 was scheduled to leave
that tarmac. I got a nice buzz going and
relaxed to Barry Adamson.
Los Angeles was going to kick ass: Hol
lywood, Disneyland, "Return of the Jedi"
at Mann's Chinese Theater, the whole she
bang. We were going to live the American
Dream in three days or die trying.
I must have zoned out from all the
fantasizing because the next thing I
knew, "Set Controls for the Heart of the
Pelvis" wfis playing for the second time
and the flight was going to take off in 35
minutes. I raised myself from the dregs
of drug-induced stupor and made the
rally cry to the troops: "Holy shit! It's
8:10! We gotta haul ass!"
I ripped my friend away from his girl,
grabbed a quick snack for the trip and
managed to get everyone in the car and on
the road with 28 minutes till doomsday.
There were only two of us going on the
flight, but the rest of the guys tagged along
— primarily to drive the car back from the

airport and possibly out of some vicarious
sadomasochism related to the anxiety and
neuroses of missing that flight.
For the sake of confidentiality, I'll refer
to my friends as pi, Yoshi, Jung and Dr.
Gonzo. Dr. Gonzo sat shotgun and the oth
ers sat in back like a stoner trio of Shake
spearean witches. All I could think of was
making that flight. If we missed it, we'd be
stuck until the following morning, com
pletely blowing our plans for Disneyland.
No Disneyland = No American Dream.
We were cruising at 85 mph on the
night road, and my friends were none too
supportive in my raging attempt to make
that plane.
"Look out, the cops!"
I slowed down, scanning the road for
signs of red and blue lights. Nothing
flashed in my direction. Yoshi cackled
and pi impersonated a siren. Friends fuck
around.
"You missed the exit!"
My right foot hit the accelerator and I
headed toward the nearest exit. Before I
could get off we passed a sign: SAN JOSE
INTERNA TIONAL AIRPORT 6 MILES.
Jung and Yoshi exchanged a look and
laughed for the next five minutes.
Friends fuck around.
"Turn! Turn! We're gonna die!"
I slammed on the brakes and swerved
into the right lane. There wasn't a turn in
sight. Dr. Gonzo began flicking my ear
with his index finger mid giggled. Every
one in back chuckled like a perverse Greek

chorus. I began to hate my friends.
The trip to the airport became a series
of mild heart-attacks, as my friends con
tinued to chip away at my composure.
But, with all the paranoia over getting in
the car, getting arrested, getting lost and
getting into an accident, I forgot to worry
about getting to the airport. I became so
engrossed with these distractions that
my overwhelming anxiety over missing
the plane vanished, replaced by the dis
tracting pseudo-anxieties brought on by
my so-called friends.
We actually made it to the airport,
through the terminal (which is another
column in itself) and onto the plane on
time. But it wasn't until take-off that \
realized I hadn't worried about missing
the flight since I left the house. Instead
my friends had made me worry about fic
tional cops rather than letting me dwell
on spending the night at home. And that
wouldn't have been fun at all. I had expe
rienced a displacement of anxiety, and it
got me through the ordeai.
So the next time you can't stop worry
ing about something, be thankful when
that good friend won't stop bothering
you about something else.
