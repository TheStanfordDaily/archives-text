# Yell leader gets acquittal
## Cal student cleared of charges in attack on Tree at Big Game 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
A three-member university committee at UC-
Rorkeley found former Bears yell leader Scott Landry
not guilty on four count - of student conduct charges.
He had been charged with inciting and participat
ing in an attack on the Tree at the 1996 Big Game.
"I'm glad it's finally over," said Landry, a senior.
"Lven if 1 was found guilt , I would have fought it.
"It's making it a little easier to graduate, now that
I don't have to worry about this," he added.
If found guilty, Landry would have had to perform
community service and write a letter of apology to the
Tree.
"I don't have any hard feelings toward Landry â€”
although a bit of it is situational," said senior Chris
Cary, who was the Tree mobbed and beaten after the
Nov. 23 football game.
"Clearly, no one person can make up the minds of
2,000 people, but people that are put in positions of
responsibility have to act responsibly," Cary added.
Tuesday's ruling, which came almost six months
after the incident, was the result of a lengthy late
April hearing. According to Landry's head defender,
sophomore Randolph Gaw, the charges were brought
about after UC-Berkeley band leader Robert Calonico
was contacted by some irate alumni who were "em
barrassed about what happened at Big Game."
"After considering the situation, Calonico decided
to fire [Landry] without any investigation and wrote
a letter of apology to the chancellor and the Office of
Student Conduct (of UC-Berkeley)," Gaw said.
"Once they looked at the letter, the OSC decided to
file charges against Scott," he added.
Despite being accused of violations of the UC-
Berkeley Code of Student Conduct, Landry was never
charged with violating any criminal laws, Gaw said.
Much of the investigation centered around
whether Landry had incited the crowd to violence by
starting chants of "Kill the Tree.'
"I didn't start the chants, and I had no power to
stop the crowd, but maybe I did fuel the fire a bit,"
Landry said.
"It's a Big Game tradition to rush the field after
the game, and I told the fans something to the effect
of'l want you guys to go onto the field and show some
spirit.' "
Landry's defender concurred.
"He never directly incited Cal students and did not
say, 'Kill the Tree,' " (Jaw said.
"During the hearing, we brought in students, spec
tators, colleagues of Scott and alums who all testified
to that fact. Even Calonico can't remember whether
he actually said that or not," Gaw added.
The victim of the entire incident wasn't certain
about that either.
"I don't know whether he said it or not," Cary said.
According to Gaw and co-defender Hikari Kimura,
the university grounded its case against Landry on
the argument that defense witnesses were not quite
certain whether the ex-yell leader had done anything
