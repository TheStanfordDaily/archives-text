# Rachel Kolman Marshak: I'm a jelly doughnut
## 'Jamba' or not, it doesn't compare to Juice Club 
### 
ONE OF THE first things I did dur
ing Orientation was go to Juice
Club. It was evening, and a bunch
of us were hanging out in our rooms when
the resident assistant came by and asked
us if we wanted smoothies. I had never
had a smoothie before and wasn't quite
sure what it was. But we agreed and piled
into his car, and he took us to Juice Club.
I ordered a Strawberries Wild because
my RA said it was good. We also all bought
Juice Club mugs because my RA said to,
and we were new freshmen and did every
thing we were told (in a similar way, I
ended up with Stanford football season
tickets that I used sparingly). Afterward,
we went home and sat in the hallway talk
ing and sipping our smoothies.
As I write this, I am drinking a suspi
ciously pink-looking Orange Oasis from
Jamba Juice and feeling nostalgic for the
days of driving to Town & Country Vil
lage on a Juice Club run.
When Jamba Juice opened just a few
weeks ago, I was really excited. A Juice
Club (as I still think of it) on campus,
what could be better?
A few weeks later, I realized the

answer. A real Juice Club would be better.
Jamba Juice is inferior to Juice Club
in several ways.
First, think about the location itself —
probably Jamba Juice's biggest asset. It's
right there in Tresidder Union, giving me
something better to eat than soggy pizza
from the Corner Pocket or the unsavory
food from Polio's.
Yet its very convenience means that it
is packed constantly. But that's not the
real problem (or at least anything that
can be fixed without implementing a
campus-wide rationing of smoothies).
The real annoyance is that Jamba Juice is
slow, a lot slower than Juice Club. Maybe
it's because the volume of people is high
er, but in that case, why don't they just
hire more staff?
Another related annoyance is that
they do not serve you in the order your
drink was purchased. For instance, earli
er this week, my boyfriend and I went to
Jamba Juice. We ordered together. He
got that nasty drink where they put
everything in (Power Boost or some
thing) and I ordered a Citrus Squeeze.
After a long wait, he got his drink, but

three or four people got theirs before I
finally got mine.
The physical set-up of Jamba Juice is
also not as good as Juice Club's. Juice
Club's decor was white and very bright. It
always woke me up to walk in there.
Jamba Juice is more pretentious with its
purple hues and light wood siding. There
were also chairs to sit on while you wait
ed in the Juice Club; there are none in
Jamba Juice. Even the smell was differ
ent. Juice Club smelled like fresh oranges
being crushed; Jamba Juice has no smell,
which leads me to think maybe the ingre
dients aren't so fresh.
Besides, there's no one grinding wheat
grass from the in-store wheat-grass plot
right in front of your eyes.
As for the drinks themselves, they
seem different too. Some drinks like
Pineapple Pizzazz, my boyfriend's
favorite, don't exist anymore. Others,
people swear to me, seemed to have dif
ferent ingredients, like Razzmatazz,
which is sweeter than it used to be. Also,
they are thicker, which could mean that
there's less crushed ice. Or it could be due
to a different cause.

In the old Juice Club in Town & Coun
try, during the blending process, the peo
ple making the drinks would stop the
blender and shake it with their hands and
then proceed to blend it more. Maybe
that made them smoother.
Further, there's less choice than before
in terms of additives. Now, instead two
ingredients from a list that included bee
pollen and ginseng, patrons must pick a
boost that includes a blend of ingredients.
But what if you just wanted bee pollen?
Further, if you order the Power Boost,
it's premixed and you can't choose not to
have one of the boosts included in it.
Most important, the"club" feeling is
missing. Because Juice Club was in Town
& Country tmd most students do not
have cars, people used to have to go
together on juice runs. There were the
groups of people I knew who would go to
Juice Club every day at the same time or
the Daily editor who would regularly beg
someone to take her to Juice Club.
It was something you did together —
with others.
With Jamba Juice, I'm not part of a
club anymore. I just go myself when I'm

around Tresidder.
To remedy these flaws of Jamba Juice,
I propose a very Stanford solution — let's
form a committee to examine Jamba Juice
and compare it to Juice Club. The com
mitter could survey students, hold numer
ous meetings and then after three years,
finally issue a report that repeats the con
clusions of this column. The committee
should be made up of the ASSU president
(to represent "student" concerns); a grad
uate student (so as not to disenfranchise
the "other half" of Stanford); others to
ensure we understand multicultural
implications of juice and don't exploit any
Burmese peasants; and, of course, me. I
think the committee should especially
focus its attention on taste tests.
Or maybe it could answer the one
question that most bothers me: What
does "jamba" mean?

Juice Club mux at the new Jamba Juice.
