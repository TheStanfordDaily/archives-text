## Golf takes fourth 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Pulling themselves up by their
bootstraps from a poor third
round finish, the Stanford men's
golfers finished the Pacific 10
Conference tournament strong in
fourth place yesterday. With its
eyes set on regionals and NCAA
tournament dreams, this year's
squad is truly born anew from the
team it was last fall.
"I thought we did really well
except for" Tuesday, said head
coach Wally Goodwin. Yesterday
"we tied the top three teams for
the lowest score; anytime you can
do that, especially on the last day,
you know you've done well."
Sophomores Joel Kribel and
Scott Wang, seniors Conrad Ray
and Pete Ligotti, and freshmen
Dusty Brett and Michael Weimer
all traveled to Eugene Country
Club in Eugene, Ore., to compete
in the six-count-five (six scores
posted, but only the top five count
per round) tournament. The team
scores for the four rounds of play
were 363, 365, 377 and 368 to end
with a total of 1,473, in fourth
place behind Arizona State, Ore
gon and USC.
"ASU is ranked in the top five

and USC is around sixth," Good
win said. "Oregon was playing on
their home course. Those were the
only teams that finished above us
— it's really good to see our guys
do that well against this field."
"If you throw out that third
round, ASU only beat us by three
strokes," Kribel said.
Individually, Kribel was the
highest finisher, tying with Chris
Hanell of Arizona State for second
place at 5 under par. "I felt like all
four rounds were a little different
for me," he said. "The first round,
I never really got anything going;
the second and third rounds, I
played well but just didn't make as
many putts as I would've liked.
The final round I didn't play well
at all, but I scrambled to break
even."
Also placing high was Ray, who
finished in sixth place at 1 under
par. "This was also a tournament
of redemption for me because I
finished close to dead last in the
Pac-10 tournament last year, and
in my three years I've never done
well at the Pac-lOs. It's good to
end with a good tournament."
"I am especially proud of Con
rad Ray," Goodwin said. "Here is

an at hlete who entered Stanford as
a football nose-tackle type, an all
state hockey player who went from
being a part-time golfer to becom
ing a stable, reliable player for our
team."

Third man Dusty Brett also
posted a few crucial scores for the
team. "Dusty played a great tour
nament besides the 80 in the third
round," Kribel said. Brett posted
the best fourth-round score for
(he team yesterday, a 2-under-par
70.
The team had already earned a
place at the NCAA West Regional
tournament to be held at Carlton

Oaks in Sun Diego next weekend.
"This team achieved a tough
goal, and that was the regional
tournament — they got there,"
Goodwin said. "Next week at the
regional tournament we'll have to
drive 15-20 percent better than
we've seen. It's a new course for
us; it's long, difficult, and it has a
few narrow holes where if you hit
into the woods you may never

come out.
"We'll be especially working on
our drivers in the next week, while
looking to maintain our short
game where it is," Goodwin said.
"We also need to work on our con
sistency."
Although the squad has been
steadily working on its depth all
spring, the team will benefit from
returning to the classic three

round, five-count-four format
which will be used at regionals and
nationals.
"If we play all three rounds —
relative to everyone else — the way
we played today, we'll be going to
nationals in Chicago," Goodwin
said. "If, however, we shoot as high
in any round as we did in the third
round, we'll be going one place —
home."

While nationals may seem like
little more than a dream right now,
Goodwin said, "Who would've
thought in October this team
would ... or even could ... finish
fourth at the Pac-lOs?"
With the end of a true
turnaround season near, the Car
dinal golfers continue to dazzle
and surprise even the most ardent
fans.
