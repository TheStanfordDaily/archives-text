# Club sports thrive despite problems
## Teams face money, field space problems as they excel on field 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Stanford students recall the exhilaration of Big Game,
when the football squad defeated California in the fall. Many
students also remember watching with great anticipation
when the men's basketball team made it to the Sweet 16 last
quarter.
Yet not many students know that the Cardinal badminton
team just won the national title or that Stanford houses one
the top Ultimate Frisbee teams in the country. Also, few are
aware of the achievement of the men's and women's rugby
squads, which both just returned from hard-won trips to the
Final Four.
Stanford is home to two types of nationally competitive
athletic programs — varsity sports and club sports — which
together make the athletic program one of the strongest in
the nation.
While the accomplishments of the big-name varsity sports
are widely publicized and highly recognized, for Stanford's 18
club sports — 17 of which made their way to nationals this
year — raising the money to support themselves and fighting
for field space is part of the struggle to join the nation's elite.
The difference between the two programs lies not merely
in publicity but also in various areas such as funding, use of
facilities and medical treatment.
Funding
While most of the funding for varsity teams comes from
the University, club sports are entirely self-funded and self
operated.
Close to half of the $22 million budget of the Department
of Athletics is generated by Cardinal football; other sources of
income include profit from sports-restricted funds — money
raised by individual varsity sports to support their operating
budget — plus money from the golf course and other operat
ing income such as summer camp programs.
"The club teams receive none of that," said Valerie
Veronin, associate athletic director of finance and operations.
"They've always totally funded and raised themselves."
The focus of concern for club teams thus becomes how
they will dig up the financial resources necessary to maintain
their squads, including money for training, travel expenses
and training equipment.
Although club sports rely on their special fee as a source of
financial support, the allocation this year was $115,000 — a
budget too small to provide adequate funding for Stanford's
18 club sports.

A fence errected across the middle of Roble field has severely hindered the practice and games of the Ultimate Frisbee
team.


"We have to rely on other
sources of income such as alumni
donations and team fund raising,"
said coterminal student Joe (May
ton, captain of the rugby team.
"We end up dedicating a lot of time
to these fund-raising events."
In fact, most teams find them
selves scraping and scrambling for
dollars through fund-raising activ
ities such as ushering at varsity
home games, working shifts at the
Stanford Fund and helping clean
the football stadium.
According to sophomore Kris
Ludwig, captain of the women's
Ultimate B-team, her team often
finds that the amount of fund rais
ing it must do infringes on training
time.
"It's just another something we
have to ask everyone to do," said
l.udwig, "I'd do it for the sake of
the team since we don't have any
funding from the school, but I'm
sure the last thing we all want to
do after classes and practice is go
lick stamps" for the Stanford
Fund.
Also for the men's Ultimate A
team, which will compete in the

national championships in throe
weeks, the money earned
through fund-raising activities is
a necessity.
Every year, before the special
fee money is divided up between
the club teams, a small percentage
is set aside to fund the teams still
competing during spring quarter,
mostly due to postseason competi
tion.
1 lowcver, due to the except ional
performance of many club sports,
the $17,000 set aside this year was
not nearly enough to fund the
teams, whose individual proposals
asked for a total of $40,000.
At a recent meeting of the Club
Sports Council — made up of rep
resentatives of the various club
teams — the men's Ultimate squad
was notified that it will only receive
about $500 to support its trip to
nationals.
"We didn't get nearly as much
funds as we'd hoped," said co-cap
tain Jim Schoettler, a coterminal
student. Even with the money
from fund raising, "we'll be digging
into our own pwkets to cover over
half the cost" of the trip.
While practicing 20 hours a
week, Schoettler's team ushers for
home games and Uikes turns work
ing for the Stanford Fund

Field space
For many club teams, finding a
place to practice is just as big a
struggle as finding the money to
compete.
The construction underway to
build a new soccer stadium on the
former north intramural fields
bars the use of three fields. This
inconvenience, along with the cur
rent construction work on Roble
Field, has caused much frustration
and confusion for club sports, forc
ing squads to reschedule their
practices and search for practice
space.
"We have nowhere to go," Lud
wig said, who added that asking
Palo Alto High School for field
space was considered as an option.
The ongoing construction work
has also affected other squads
which practice on fields not under
construction.
"We were trying to prepare for
playoffs, and there were lines being
painted all over our field," said
lacrosse player Brian Auld, a
sophomore. "There were also
recreational athletes wanting to
play on our field all the time —
these were great distractions."
Schoettler agreed. "It's just a
killer." he said of the construction.
"When vou think about how many

students play club sports, the con
struction is an unfortunate situa
tion."
Schoettler's Ultimate team
every spring hosts a premiere colle
giate West Coast Ultimate tourna
ment with more than 30 teams;
this year, the squad was forced to
hold the competition on four differ
ent fields due to the construction.
"The team was notified of the
construction and limited space
only after a preliminary OK and
after a number of teams had com
mitted to the tournament,"
Schoettler said.
Asst. Director of Facilities and
Operations Ray Purpur said the
building of the soccer stadium is
part of a major effort to move all
intramural fields together and
away from the north field.
He added a committee that
reflects interests from all athletics
groups on campus had formulated
the plan. He also commented that
the University is not unfairly
removing field space from nonvar
sity athletes.
"The Athletics Department
works with the University to make
sure all teams are informed of
these constructions," Purpur said.
According to Veronin. there are
efforts being made by the Athletics
Department to get more field space

for club sports in the future.
The department is looking at
unused and uncultivated land on
the corner of El Camino Real and
Serra Street as possible field space
for club sports.
"We are looking to see how
many fields we can develop there,"
she said. "We're hoping maybe two
or three."
Veronin added that the field
between Wilbur and Stern could be
upgraded to suit athletic activity as
well.
Facilities and treatment
The sports facilities, provided
for and maintained by the Univer
sity budget, act as an equalizer
between varsity and club sports,
according to Veronin.
The general funds budget of the
Athletics Department goes to
maintaining various facilities,
including the weight room which
both club and varsity sports use,
she said. They split time in the
room, which is reserved for club
sports in the morning and varsity
athletes in the afternoon.
According to Asst. Athletic
Director Shirley Schoof, club
sports are "like a marriage
between athletics and the ASSU."
"The athletic part of it gives

them use of facilities and use of
office (space) at Roble Gym," she
said.
However, the training room is
reserved solely for varsity athletes.
Although high-contact sports
such as rugby and lacrosse are able
to hire training-room staff to
attend to medical needs during
games, club-sport athletes cannot
get special medical treatment or
use the training room's pharma
ceutical resources.
"We don't get emergency treat
ment in the training room; we
don't get rehabilitation; we don't
get anything," said Auld. "I seri
ously hope they'll reconsider let
ting us use the training room. We
just ice and tape on our own, but it
would make our lives significantly
easier if we had access to half of
what the University has to offer."
According to Schoof, the train
ing room just isn't "set up to take
medical care of 33 varsity and 18
club teams.
"Club sports is student initiat
ed, student organized and student
run — in my opinion the best of
two worlds because students are
able to organize their own program
and at the same time get to com
pete for Stanford on a national
level," she said. "They have the
freedom to run their own show."
