# Club sports thrive despite problems
## Teams face money, field space problems as they excel on field 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
Stanford students recall the exhilaration of Big Game,
when the football squad defeated California in the fall. Many
students also remember watching with great anticipation
when the men's basketball team made it to the Sweet 16 last
quarter.
Yet not many students know that the Cardinal badminton
team just won the national title or that Stanford houses one
the top Ultimate Frisbee teams in the country. Also, few are
aware of the achievement of the men's and women's rugby
squads, which both just returned from hard-won trips to the
Final Four.
Stanford is home to two types of nationally competitive
athletic programs — varsity sports and club sports — which
together make the athletic program one of the strongest in
the nation.
While the accomplishments of the big-name varsity sports
are widely publicized and highly recognized, for Stanford's 18
club sports — 17 of which made their way to nationals this
year — raising the money to support themselves and fighting
for field space is part of the struggle to join the nation's elite.
The difference between the two programs lies not merely
in publicity but also in various areas such as funding, use of
facilities and medical treatment.
Funding
While most of the funding for varsity teams comes from
the University, club sports are entirely self-funded and self
operated.
Close to half of the $22 million budget of the Department
of Athletics is generated by Cardinal football; other sources of
income include profit from sports-restricted funds — money
raised by individual varsity sports to support their operating
budget — plus money from the golf course and other operat
ing income such as summer camp programs.
"The club teams receive none of that," said Valerie
Veronin, associate athletic director of finance and operations.
"They've always totally funded and raised themselves."
The focus of concern for club teams thus becomes how
they will dig up the financial resources necessary to maintain
their squads, including money for training, travel expenses
and training equipment.
Although club sports rely on their special fee as a source of
financial support, the allocation this year was $115,000 — a
budget too small to provide adequate funding for Stanford's
18 club sports.
