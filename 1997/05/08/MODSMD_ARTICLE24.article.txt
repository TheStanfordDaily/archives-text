# The
						NBA playoffs: It's still the Bulls
## 
### 
Finally, the NBA is getting interest
ing again. After two dull years with
the Houston Rockets on top by
default and one year of complete domi
nance by the record-setting Chicago
Bulls, basketball fans around the country

are beginning to at least try and convince
themselves that this year's NBA title is
up for grabs.
While these people are actually fooling
themselves, it is certainly true that this
year's Chicago Bulls are not as invincible
as last year's team. The experts said the
only thing that would stop the Bulls from
repeating as NBA champions was injuries,

which have ran rampant up and down the
Bulls lineup. Key injuries limited the Bulls
to just 69 wins. That's a shame.
However, no one can argue with the
fact that the Bulls, despite an undefeated
record thus far in the playoffs, look vul
nerable. For that reason alone, the seven
other teams around the league are
buzzing about their chances to get fitted
for championship rings.
Let us start in the Western Conference
because no team west of the Mississippi is
possibly going to win a title. Do they play
any defense out here? I thought it was
just the Warriors, and then I saw the leak
ers-Jazz game. These are two of the sup
posed powers of the conference, and no
one could stop anyone from penetrating
the lane. Do these teams think that thus
defense-championship connection is just
some bizarre coincidence? Evidently.
The most successful regular-season
squad in the West in the past three years,
the Seattle Sonics, are going nowhere
quickly. In fact, it might have been easier
for both them and their fans if they had
just lost in the first round. Again.
Between Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp,

the Sonics have no leadership on the
court. (Sorry, Nate McMillan does not
count either.) In a first-round loss to
Phoenix last week, Payton bragged that
as long as the Suns left him open, he
would knock down the three just as he did
throughout the game. With the Sonics
squeaking by in five games, it looks like
you're missing the point, Gary.
Utah's Greg Ostertag is quickly mak
ing leakers fans forget about their title.
After a dismal performance in game one,
Shaquille O'Neal came "storming" back
in game two to miss 15-of-25 shots and 5-
of-10 free throws. Nice work, big fella.
Just as Shaq still has 10 fingers, come two
more losses, he will still have no rings
The leakers supporting cast is too incon
sistent to provide the depth needed to
complement O'Neal if he has a subpar
performance. Forward Robert Horry is
just as likely to go 0-for-7 as he is 7-for-7,
and when he does get it going, someone
else disappears (i.e., Eddie Jones with no
points in 28 minutes).
