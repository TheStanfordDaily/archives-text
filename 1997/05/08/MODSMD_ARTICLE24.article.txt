# The 						NBA playoffs: It's still the Bulls
## 
### 
Finally, the NBA is getting interest
ing again. After two dull years with
the Houston Rockets on top by
default and one year of complete domi
nance by the record-setting Chicago
Bulls, basketball fans around the country

are beginning to at least try and convince
themselves that this year's NBA title is
up for grabs.
While these people are actually fooling
themselves, it is certainly true that this
year's Chicago Bulls are not as invincible
as last year's team. The experts said the
only thing that would stop the Bulls from
repeating as NBA champions was injuries,

which have ran rampant up and down the
Bulls lineup. Key injuries limited the Bulls
to just 69 wins. That's a shame.
However, no one can argue with the
fact that the Bulls, despite an undefeated
record thus far in the playoffs, look vul
nerable. For that reason alone, the seven
other teams around the league are
buzzing about their chances to get fitted
for championship rings.
Let us start in the Western Conference
because no team west of the Mississippi is
possibly going to win a title. Do they play
any defense out here? I thought it was
just the Warriors, and then I saw the leak
ers-Jazz game. These are two of the sup
posed powers of the conference, and no
one could stop anyone from penetrating
the lane. Do these teams think that thus
defense-championship connection is just
some bizarre coincidence? Evidently.
The most successful regular-season
squad in the West in the past three years,
the Seattle Sonics, are going nowhere
quickly. In fact, it might have been easier
for both them and their fans if they had
just lost in the first round. Again.
Between Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp,

the Sonics have no leadership on the
court. (Sorry, Nate McMillan does not
count either.) In a first-round loss to
Phoenix last week, Payton bragged that
as long as the Suns left him open, he
would knock down the three just as he did
throughout the game. With the Sonics
squeaking by in five games, it looks like
you're missing the point, Gary.
Utah's Greg Ostertag is quickly mak
ing leakers fans forget about their title.
After a dismal performance in game one,
Shaquille O'Neal came "storming" back
in game two to miss 15-of-25 shots and 5-
of-10 free throws. Nice work, big fella.
Just as Shaq still has 10 fingers, come two
more losses, he will still have no rings
The leakers supporting cast is too incon
sistent to provide the depth needed to
complement O'Neal if he has a subpar
performance. Forward Robert Horry is
just as likely to go 0-for-7 as he is 7-for-7,
and when he does get it going, someone
else disappears (i.e., Eddie Jones with no
points in 28 minutes).
A conference final featuring Utah and

Mann
Houston will be interesting,
although this is as far as the West
will get before embarrassing itself
in the finals. The Jazz put together
a fabulous season this year behind
a noble performance by Karl Mal
one, but even the Knicks could
have won 65 games this year if
I hey played the regular season in
the West. When it comes down to
it, the Jazz are probably better
than they have been in the past,
hut they still have no one besides
Malone and Stockton. Ostertag
and whoever else they try at center
will be no match for a center who
has any semblance of a head on his
shoulders. Stockton will get the
advantage in his matchup against
the Rockets, but the Jazz are out
matched virtually everywhere else.
Malone certainly gets the edge at
power forward, hut he will have his
hands full with Charles Barkley,
who has the potential to take over
;in entire series.
After a rash of injuries through
out the regular season, the Rockets
have fallen out of everyone's
graces. But the Rockets know what
it takes to win in the postseason
and have probably been resting
Barkley and others more than nec
essary in preparation for their run
at the title. This year's team is far
better than either of Houston's
championship teams, thanks to
Barkley, hut the Knicks and the
Magic were hardly worthy Eastern
Conference opponents.
In the East, things are a bit
more interesting, mainly because
the four teams left in the two semi
final series' are the four best defen
sive teams in the league. Knicks
fans think that this is their year,
but Patrick Ewing has such an
incredible losing streak, dating
back to his Georgetown fiasco, that
he is as used to losing as the Chica
go Cubs.
New York should feel comfort

able that when it comes down to
the final shot, they can get it to
Ewing (blown two-footer against
the Pacers) or Starks (l-for-18 in
Game 7 of the 1994 finals).
Frankly, it won't be Ewing or
Starks that loses it for the Knicks,
but forward Larry Johnson and
guards Allan Houston and Chris
Childs. New York has enough tal
ent to win any individual game, but
they don't do it consistently
enough to win a big-time series.
The only big series which the
Knicks have actually won this
decade was in 1994 against a Bulls
team that featured just Scottie Pip
pen, an inexperienced Toni Kukoc
and little else.
The Heat should win the series,
if for no other reason than Pat
Riley. Riley has shown this year
that he deserved every accolade he
h;is ever received in his coaching
career. This Heat team was sup
posed to be a contender at best for
the Atlantic Division crown even
with Washington's Juwan
Howard, but Riley took them and
molded them in to a team that cap
tured the title going away. The
Heat could lose the series if Alonzo
Mourning doesn't come to play,
which he has certainly done in the
past. However, Heat point guard
Tim Hardaway is good enough to
keep the series at the Heat's
tempo.
Miami will meet Chicago in the
Eastern Conference finals. Atlanta
is a solid team with a lot of talent
and a tough defense. Hawk point
guard Mookie Blaylock will contin
ue to give the Bulls' defense fits as
he did in game one (31 points), but
the Hawks won't have a better
opportunity than they did in Game
1. There is no better coach in the
league than Phil Jackson at mak
ing adjustments from game to
game, while the Hawks may have
already put forth their best argu
ment.
The simple truth is that the
Bulls are the best team in the
league, and Chicago will win their
fifth title in seven vears. While con

tending teams and basketball fans
may be correct in believing that
they can be beaten, they won't be
beaten. The talk of vulnerability is
what Michael and the Bulls feed
off. After a total of 150 wins in
their last 175 games, Chicago is
dying for motivation and they are
finally getting some. Predictions of
a Bulls collapse in the Eastern
Conference finals are surfacing in
New York and Miami. Similar
rumors were heard in Orlando last
season as well, and we all know
how that turned out.
The Bulls will beat the Heat and
the Rockets, despite injuries and
despite Dennis. Chicago would be
as invincible as ever if Rodman
would resolve himself to keeping
his mouth shut and antics in
check, but these things are of little
importance in the long run. Chica
go has the benefit of having Pippen
to look to, and Pippen has respond
ed by eliminating Washington with
one drive to the rim and with hit
ting the game-winning three
pointer in Game 1 against the
Hawks. (By the way, when is the
NBA going to recognize that there
is more to defense than steals and
blocked shots and give Pippen his
Defensive Player of the Year
award? He is clearly the best man
to-man defender in the game.)
With Pippen in a zone, the Bulls
won't need much to provide him
with a ring for his pinky finger.
That is because they have
Michael. The greatest player ever
is on top of his game, as always. He
can score virtually at will and has
no qualms about taking over a
game or a series, or a league or a
sport for that matter. He simply
will not let the Bulls lose, and
doubting or challenging him is
merely fuel for the fire. He proved
against the Bullets that if they
need 55, he will score 55. When
Rodman was ejected against
Atlanta and they needed rebound
ing, he pulled down 11. While the
Bulls may not be as invincible as
last year, Jordan is as invincible as
ever.
