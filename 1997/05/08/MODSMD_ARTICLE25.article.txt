# Golf under the hot desert sun
## Women head to Arizona 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Early one morning senior Mhairi McKay
and freshman Jae Jean Ro were sitting in a
van on their way to a recent women's golf
tournament in Arizona.
Like a drill sergeant to a private, McKay
turned to Ro and shouted, "What are you
going to shoot today?"
The timid but inspired freshman did not
shoot her target goal during the tourna
ment, but the motivation of her teammate
helped Ro set high standards.
Today, Ro and the rest of the No. 7 Stan
ford women's golf team are back in Arizona
and setting high standards, this time for a
shot at the NCAA West Regional title.
The women's golf team tees off the first
round of the 54-hole regional today. The
tournament is held at the 5,954-yard, par
-72 Randolph Park North Golf Course in
Tucson, Ariz.
To move on to the national champi
onship, the team must place in the top 11 at

regionals. The Cardinal team has qualified
for the NCAA Championships in each of the
past eight years.
Compared to the East Regionals, tin?
western counterpart is known to be more
competitive, with teams like top-ranked San
Jose State leading the pack. The Pacific 10
Conference alone, the strongest women's
golf conference in the nation, ranks several
potential NCAA title contenders like No. 2
Arizona, No. 3 Arizona State, Stanford and
No. 8 UCLA.
Top individual competitors like Arizona's
Marisa Baena (stroke average 73), who won
the 1996 NCAA individual title and San
Jose State's Janice Moodie (stroke average
73.45), a long-time Scottish rival to McKay
are among the league's best.
"We'll have some brief pep talks in the
van to fire us up for this tournament, but 1
think everybody knows what they want and
what they're capable of shooting," McKay
said.
