# Golf under the hot desert sun
## Women head to Arizona 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Early one morning senior Mhairi McKay
and freshman Jae Jean Ro were sitting in a
van on their way to a recent women's golf
tournament in Arizona.
Like a drill sergeant to a private, McKay
turned to Ro and shouted, "What are you
going to shoot today?"
The timid but inspired freshman did not
shoot her target goal during the tourna
ment, but the motivation of her teammate
helped Ro set high standards.
Today, Ro and the rest of the No. 7 Stan
ford women's golf team are back in Arizona
and setting high standards, this time for a
shot at the NCAA West Regional title.
The women's golf team tees off the first
round of the 54-hole regional today. The
tournament is held at the 5,954-yard, par
-72 Randolph Park North Golf Course in
Tucson, Ariz.
To move on to the national champi
onship, the team must place in the top 11 at

regionals. The Cardinal team has qualified
for the NCAA Championships in each of the
past eight years.
Compared to the East Regionals, tin?
western counterpart is known to be more
competitive, with teams like top-ranked San
Jose State leading the pack. The Pacific 10
Conference alone, the strongest women's
golf conference in the nation, ranks several
potential NCAA title contenders like No. 2
Arizona, No. 3 Arizona State, Stanford and
No. 8 UCLA.
Top individual competitors like Arizona's
Marisa Baena (stroke average 73), who won
the 1996 NCAA individual title and San
Jose State's Janice Moodie (stroke average
73.45), a long-time Scottish rival to McKay
are among the league's best.
"We'll have some brief pep talks in the
van to fire us up for this tournament, but 1
think everybody knows what they want and
what they're capable of shooting," McKay
said.
What the team wants is a shot
at capturing a first-ever national
championship title. As the only
school with two graduating seniors
who rank in the nation's top five,
the team sees the title as "definite
ly within reach."
Senior co-captains McKay and
Andrea Baxter have led the Cardi
nal squad to three tournament vic
tories throughout the year. The
team started off with a strong pre
season opener. But at the start of
the NCAA season, Baxter broke
her wrist in a weekend snowboard
ing accident, putting her out for
the majority of the season.
The Cardinal team struggled
during the next three tournaments
without its second-seeded player
but has slowly built confidence
with Baxter's return about two
weeks ago.
The team has worked hard on
its short game, tee shots and course
management throughout the sea
son. Freshman Julie Dunn has
improved her short game to consis
tently putt 5-foot shots for par.
Sophomore Michelle Sperry, an
analytical player with a solid short
game, has improved her swing.

The team has also matured to
develop mental confidence.
"In the last seven months,
Michelle has improved her self
confidence dramatically to shoot
low numbers that she's always
been capable of shooting," said
head coach Caroline O'Connor.
Sperry, who played the Tucson
course last year at the Conquista
dores' Arizona Invitational, shot
her lowest score, 13-over-par 229,
last season at the tournament.
Scoring well is not about play
ing a perfect shot but learning how
to minimize bad holes, O'Connor
said. The team that plays the least
number of bad holes wins.
"If you're hitting right to left on
the course, that's not the time to
fix your swing. You have to play
with the swing you brought with
you," O'Connor said.
At the Pac-10 Championships,
McKay shot 12-under-par 207
after 54 holes. On the first round,
she shot an amazing 5-under-par
68 without hitting the ball well.
She sliced and hooked her shots
into the rough but still managed to
birdie her ball into holes by adjust
ing her game to her swing.
Physically, the Cardinal squad
is perhaps one of the strongest in
the nation. Three of the five play
ers drive their balls unusually
long, at an average distance of 270

to 280 yards.
But a long tee shot will not be
particularly advantageous on a
dry, desert course like Tucson. The
fairways and greens are so hard
that balls roll away like tumble
weed on a windy day.
Many of the holes on the course
tend to look similar, which can
frustrate a golfer's strategy per
ception. Course-management play
requires focusing on each hole sep
arately, O'Connor said.
"Knowing the yardage is key for
this course," she said. "If the pin's
up front and it's a hard green, you
have to play the ball below the
green or else it'll roll all the way
back."
Though the conditions of the
public course "aren't that great,"
many of the par-5 holes are reach
able for birdie opportunities,
McKay said.
"It's a scoreable course, so long
as you're patient," said McKay,
who shot 5-over-par 221 (77, 70,
74) at the Tucson course last year.
The coach likened the game of
golf as a cross between chess and
darts. Chess requires a player to
the position of chess pieces, and
darts require a player to hit a spe
cific target.
"Right now, we're the best
chess players and best dartplayers
out there," O'Connor said.
