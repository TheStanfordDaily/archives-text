# Little big people lead crew

### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
What is the first picture that comes to mind
when you hear the words, "Stanford crew?"
You probably envision a boat with eight muscu
lar and sweaty men, like senior Mark Thomas (6-
foot-6 and 225 pounds), pulling hard as the sun
begins to break the horizon.
However in that picture, did you remember to
include a little person, like senior Nancy Berg
steinsson (5-3 and 110 pounds), crouched down at
the end of the boat shouting commands at these
oarsmen?
This season, the Stanford crew team had three
returning coxswains — sophomores Bonnie Camp
bell and Kipper York and Bergsteinsson — and
picked up three new freshman members — Daniel
Matross, Cristina Miller and Jyoti Bollman.
In the sport of crew, coxswains have the most
mentally draining responsibility of all crew mem
bers. They are the brains of the boat.
Under 125 pounds, their job description also
includes loudness, steering the boat in a straight
course, knowing the rowers' potentials, carrying out
the coach's race plans and keeping the boat in good
physical condition just to name a few.
"Coxswains are an essential part of a successful
crew. A lot of people tend to overlook them," said
Stanford men's head coach Wieslaw Kujda. "Dur
ing races, a good coxswain is not only aggressive
but has a very high understanding of the course,
the race plans and its boat's potential."
Many coxes turned to that aspect of rowing after
not meeting the size restrictions for being a rower.
They are all athletes of some sort who are drawn to
the competitive edge that crew provides.
Women's varsity coxswain Bergsteinsson origi
nally wanted to become a rower; however, due to
her small size, she decided to take the mastermind
position of her boat.
Despite not being able to physically row while on
the boat, most of the Stanford coxswains keep in
good physical shape by running and biking in their
spare time.
One-time marathon runner Bergsteinsson said,
"We are athletes too, and we can use" an athletes'
competitive edge and motivation "to our advantage
in racing situations."
Other coxes participated as rowers in high school
but were unable to make the transition to the varsi
ty team at Stanford due to their size or upon dis
covering their coxing talents.
Men's varsity coxswain Campbell was once a
lightweight oarswoman in her years at Woodrow
Wilson High School in Washington, D.C.
Because the Pacific 10 Conference does not have
lightweight divisions, former high school oarswom
en Campbell and York contributed to Stanford crew
in other means — coxing for the past two years.
"Coxing is my way of staying connected to this

amazing sport," said men's varsity coxswain Camp
bell. "I decided to cox because I love the competition,
victory and the bottom line — I love driving fast
boats."
Women's junior varsity coxswain York, born
into two generations of oarsmen, attempted to row
for Stanford in her freshman year until she
noticed her smaller size when compared to her
teammates.
"I was rowing for Stanford and then it hit me
that I was a lot smaller than everyone else," York
said. "And I thought I could contribute a lot more
coxing for my team.
After grueling months of training, novices Miller,
Bollman and Matross took the challenge most of
their classmates would not, waking up at 5:30 a.m.
every day.
The coxswain for the men's junior varsity boat,
Miller, was always exposed to rowing during her
high school years at National Cathedral School in
Washington, D.C.
"I think coxing is really an unique position
unlike any other in competitive athletics," Miller
said. "It is exciting to know that you are in control
of your boat."
Despite crew's large time demands, Miller finds
it a good way to budget her time as she earned an
award this fall for her academic achievements while
a member of a varsity sport.
Women's novice coxswain Bollman rowed for
Stanford for a few months until women's novice
coach Kristine Franson realized her potential of
being a good coxswain.
"After seeing the Harvard Boathouse, I always
wanted to row," Bollman said.
On the other hand, Matross was inspired not by
the Harvard Boathouse, but by watching the
coxswain cam in the crew races during last sum
mer's Olympic Games.
Even though a men's novice coxswain, Matross is
no novice when it comes to speed as he is a certified
pilot and still wears his pilot shades when coxing.
Adding to his profile of speed, Matross was also a
part of his high school's track and crosscountry
squads.
"Being a coxswain is the most unique position in
sports," Matross said. "You are always mentally on
your toes."
The next time you happen to observe a crew race,
remember the little people who are steering the boat
and mentally pushing its big rowers to their limits.
After four years rowing for Stanford, Thomas
also stressed the importance of the coxswain in the
boat.
"Without [coxswains], we can be a bunch of dis
organized and lost lugs losing races," Thomas said.
Despite the sleep deprivation, rainy days, rough
waters and defeats, Stanford crew's little people will
always be at the boathouse in Redwood City at 6
a.m. to lead their boats toward becoming the fastest
oars of the West.
