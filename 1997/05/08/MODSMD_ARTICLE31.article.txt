### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Steven Zipperstein, history professor and director
of the Jewish Studies Program, will receive the Judah
L. Magnes Gold Medal on May 21 from the American
Friends of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
With the award — which will be presented at a
fund-raising dinner at the Fairmont Hotel in San
Francisco — Zipperstein will enter into Hebrew Uni
versity's recently established Hall of Fame.
The gold medal is named for Hebrew University's
first president, an Oakland native.
Magnes "was a courageous and wise man," Zipper
stein said. "He was a pioneer ii. Arab-Jewish relations
in pre-state Israel. I'm especially proud to receive an
honor that bears his name."
Zipperstein, who attended the Jerusalem universi
ty for two years as an undergraduate, exemplifies the
excellence of the institution, said Daphna Noily, re
gional director of American Friends.
The medal serves the purpose of "honoring alumni
who have made a profound impact on the local com
munity," she said.

Zipperstein described his undergraduate experi
ence there as "intense, difficult and wonderful." Zip
perstein returned to the institution later as a visiting
professor.
"My relationship with the Hebrew University has
proved to be lifelong," Zipperstein said. "It's a splen
did, world-class intellectual center, and I'm proud to
be honored by it."
At Moscow's Russia State Humanities University,
Zipperstein became the first instructor to teach a
Russian Jewish history course there since the 19205.
Zipperstein is currently the editor of the journal
Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture and Society
and also serves as the director of the Koret Institute,
which studies contemporary Jewish issues.
Recently his book, "Elusive Prophet: Ahad Ha'am
and the Origins of Zionism," received a National Jew
ish Book Award.
The purpose of American Friends is to support
higher education, principally Hebrew University, by
supplying resources for the fulfillment of its goals and
by representing the university before the Jewish com
munity in the United States.
