# Fame on the Farm
## Children of cabinet secretary, court justice find comfortable atmosphere 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
When she enrolls as a freshman next fall, Chelsea
Clinton will be Stanford's most famous political off
spring in recent memory, but she won't be the only one.
Among the current crop of students who prefer the
Farm to the Beltway are senior Michael Breyer, the son
of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and senior
Mercedes Cisneros, the daughter of former U.S. Hous
ing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cis
neros.
Breyer and Cisneros say their experiences diverge
from what will most likely face Clinton in that they are
rarely recognized or approached on campus about their
fathers. When the general subject of parents'jobs aris
es, both Breyer and CLsneros said they downplay their
fathers' positions. However, on the relatively infre
quent occasions when other students are already aware
of who their fathers are, talking to these students is a
pleasure rather than a burden.
"People are genuinely interested in finding out what
it's like," Breyer said. "The judiciary compared to the
executive and legislative areas of government — people
know less about it. People want to know what it's like
to be on the Supreme Court."
For Cisneros, moving to California from her native
Texas meant a significant — and welcome — decrease
in name recognition. Her father became mayor of San
Antonio when she was 6 years old and was the first-ever
Chicano mayor and subsequently, in the Clinton ad
ministration, the first-ever Chicano Cabinet member.
He left Washington in January to run a Spanish-lan
guage television station headquartered in Los Angeles.
"My dad isn't so high-profile," she said. "Most of the
time we can do things very, very easily (in California).
In Texas, wo get stopped all the time with people want
ing to shake his hand."
This recognition brought along certain responsibili
ties, Cisneros said. During high school, Cisneros was at
a party where people; were drinking alcohol when word
spread that someone had called the police. Most guests
left, but Cisneros and sevenil friends decided to stay at
the house and hide in a closet. The police never came,
but when Cisneros told her older sister .about the inci
dent the next day, her sister scolded her.
"My sLster said, 'You can't do things like that. If you
were caught, it would make it onto the front page of the
paper,"' Cisneros said.
I laving her father in the spotlight has been a way of
life for Cisneros, she sai Cisneros was in utero when
her father embarked on s first campaign for public of
fice, running for city council."He has this joke he likes
to tell, which I don't find funny at all," Cisneros said. Ac
cording to the joke, which her father would recite at
fund-raising events and rallies, Cisneros emerged from
her mother's stomach, stuck out her hand and said,
"Hi, my dad's Henry Cisneros. Vote for him."
Cheesy jokes aside, Cisneros said she feels fortunate
to have enjoyed some of the privileges of her father's job.

"I feel like I've been exposed to a lot of things that nor
mal people don't get to do," she said. For example, Cis
neros has met President Clinton several times. The first
time, when she was a senior in high school, she received
some interesting advice from President Clinton.
Cisneros told Clinton that Stanford was her first
choice, and his response was, "If I could do my under
graduate years again, I would go to Stanford."
Breyer, who has also met Clinton, said he, too, con
siders himself fortunate about the opportunities his fa
ther's position has afforded him. During spring break,
Breyer sat in on the Supreme Court's oral arguments
about indecency on the Internet.
This June, instead of Breyer dropping in on his fa
ther's life, the opposite will occur: Stephen Breyer, who
graduated from Stanford in 1959, will give the com
mencement address at his son's graduation. Michael
Breyer has mixed feelings about this event.
"On the one hand, I get tons of advice from him, so
what's another 30 minutes?" he joked. "On the other
hand, it's nice for me. When I see him speak, I'll re
member he [attended Stanford], and my grandfather
was here, and they went through graduation and had
the same questions about what they wanted to do with
the rest of their lives. It's reassuring to me to know they
faced these same questions."
Breyer and Cisneros said although they admire their
fathers, they do not feel compelled to follow in their foot
steps. Breyer, an economics major, is unsure of his im
mediate plans but hopes they will involve public service.
However, he is not interested in law.
Cisneros, a sociology major, will teach elementary
school in Los Angeles next year. She has difficulty pic
turing herself as a politician.
"My dad's known as being a really good speaker.
Those skills didn't come with the genes," she said.
As much as she looks up to him, Cisneros still sees
her father as pretty typical. "I don't feel like he's any
body but just Dad.... He wears his undershirt and
slacks downstairs," she said. "It's weird occasionally to
open the newspaper and see his , lure. But it's weird
er for other people who knew of him and then got to
know him on a personal level."
Breyer also said he sees his father primarily as a dad
rather than as a member of the Supreme Court. As a
child, Breyer had difficulty learning to read, so his fa
ther spent half an hour with him every day trying to
help.
Another vivid childhood memory is his father's habit
of cracking hard-boiled eggs against his head, usually
during family picnics. "I thought, 'Wow, this is a great
thingtodo,"' Breyersaid. "I was really excited about it."
Once when his father was on the phone, Breyer was
trying to crack an egg against his own head. He was un
successful and passed his father another egg for demon
stration purposes. The egg was raw and broke all over
Breyer's father.
While this would have made a poor photo opportuni
ty for a public figure, it was no big deal for a dad. Breyer
said his father "took it very well."
