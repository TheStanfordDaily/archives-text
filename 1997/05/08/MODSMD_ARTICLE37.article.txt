## Oliver sacks seeks answers in this scientific travel journal 
### 
The Island of the Colorblind
Oliver Sacks;
Alfred A. Knopf
Oliver Sacks, the author best known for the books "An An
thropologist on Mars" and "Awakenings," now has written a
travel journal that takes the reader on an island-hopping trip in
the Pacific Ocean. The beauty of "The Island of the Color
blind" is that it combines scientific research with the account
of journeys to remote locations such as (iuam and Micronesia.
Because of these varied topics, the book stays interesting and
will appeal to a broad audience.
The reason for

Sacks' trip is twofold.
First, he leaves home to
fulfill his desire to ex
plore the unusual flora
and fauna 011 tropical
islands. Second, he
makes the trip to study
some colonies whose
inhabitants are suffer
ing from odd neuro
logical conditions.
Sacks' first trip takes
him to the islands of
Pingelap and Pohnpei,
where he hopes to
study a community
that is suffering from

achromatopia, a rare condition
that causes colorblindness.
It is definitely an intriguing
concept "to be part of a culture
where the entire concept of color
might be missing but where, in
stead, other forms of perception,
of attention, might be amplified
in compensation." Just imagine,

for instance, if you suddenly became colorblind. An someone
who previously experienced both color and its concept, you
would find your new life incomplete. You would feel as though
you were not getting all the information you knew was avail
able. You wouldn't feel as great a sense ot loss it you were 110
longer able to see texture or luminance, but texture and lumi
nance are exactly what achromatopes base their vision 011.
Sacks is determined to understand this condition better and
see how it affects the people socially.
On Pingelap, Sacks and his companions discover that the
achromatopes' inability to deal with bright sunlight has caused
them to isolate themselves during the day. The people dis
tanced themselves from each other and have given up the hope
for integration through education, lb put this situation in per
spective, Sacks has brought along a Norwegian scientist, Knut
Nordby, an achromatope himsell who managed to overcome
his disease. The description ot the contrast between the color
blind and the non-colorblind, the well-integrated and the not
so-well-integrated, makes this book more interesting because
it gives the reader a better sense of the disease that achro
matopes have to deal with.
In the second half of the book, Sacks details his trip to

Ciuam, where he goes to study a disease called lytico hodig.
This disease manifests itself in many different ways, including
an advanced paralysis resembling motor neuron disease and a
condition resembling Parkinson's disease with an occasional
hint of dementia. Scientists have yet to discover exactly what
causes lytico bodig.
Sacks speculates that the incidence ol people affected with
the disease peaked right after the Japanese occupation ol
(iuam. l adang, a food derived from the cycad plant, was more
frequently consumed during that time. Cycad plants are
known to be highly toxic, but numerous cultures have found
ways to detoxify them. The question surrounding the relation
ship between fadang and lytico hodig is .1 hard one to solve be
cause the effects of eating fadang could be accumulated over
time rather than immediately visible. I his problem, along with
the fact that the disease is mostly found in remote locations,
makes lytico -hodig a very hard condition to study.
"The Island of the (".olorblind" offers an interesting look at
some unusual medical conditions while at the same time of
fering an interesting travel account. Sacks, once again, has
managed to turn what could have been a dry scientific report
into a captivating book.
