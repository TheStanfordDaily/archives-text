# Coming out loud and proud
## Ellen DeGeneres plays the biggest part of her life- role model to gays and lesbians on the Farm and beyond 
### 
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN OVERSEAS in
Nepal for the past quarter if you don't
know about the much-hyped prime
time "coming out' of comedienne Ellen De-
Generes.
Coming out refers to the act of coming
out of the closet, the proverbial place where
1 gays and lesbians feel they have to hide their
I personal lives for fear of discrimination and
I rejection.

Indeed, Hollywood has been a
paradox of sorts because while it
has been comfortable with exploit
ing the talents of some of the most
I talented gays in the world, it has
I never genuinely allowed them to
I be publicly recognized.
■ It's not so much of internal
■ discrimination but in a world
H hyper-concerned with image
■ and the advertising dollar, pub
||| licly airing one's sexual orienta-
B tion could prove to be career
■ suicide. A system of "don't ask,
||| don't tell pervades Holly
wood, a symptom of the un
ease some people still have
§f|||| about homosexuality.
Such resistance is partic
i ularly strong in TV where
ft conservative groups have
jjg| denounced ABC! for sup
■ porting "the gay agenda."
■ Several companies, includ
||| ing JC Penney and
■ Chrysler, declined to run
■ their usual ads during this
■ Kllen episode. No matter
ad time sold out at
■ three times the usual rate
H during last week's
Wednesday night spot.
It seems some people
■ remember gay con
sumers have money to
i spend, too.
■ Which is why
■ Kllen's coming out
||i episode, in overcom-

ing not only her personal doubts but also internal
resistance, is a milestone. It marks the first time
an avowed gay person will be starring as the lead
in a prime-time network show. Certainly, there
have been gay leads or gay characters in movies
and TV shows before, but they were either forced
into masking their sexual identity — like Rock
Hudson — or relegated to the periphery, usually
in unflattering and stereotypical, laughable roles.
Ellen's show was different in that it did not play
to the popular stereotype of the effeminate fag or
the butch dyke — code for a weak gay man or a
very strong-willed lesbian. The show depicts
Ellen Morgan, DeGeneres' TV character, as a nor
mal person who, confiding in her therapist
(played by Oprah Winfrey), realizes after 30-odd
years that she is not attracted to men after all and
is falling for a very attractive woman (played by
Laura Dern).
Many gays and lesbians hope the coming out
episode will showcase the fact gay couples are re
ally no different from heterosexual couples.
As in cities across the country, members of
Stanford's lesbian, gay and bisexual community
held an Ellen "coming out" party last week to
watch and celebrate the momentous event. And
like the millions who gathered around their TV
sets for the occasion, DeGeneres' opening to the
world brought out a host of emotions.

"It's really refresh
ing — it was tasteful
ly done," said Peter
Russell, a staff psy
chologist for Cowell
Student Health Cen
ter's Counseling and
Psychological Ser
vices. "Comedy can
be a great forum for
difficult topics, and it
was done nicely,
without the stereo
types and myths."
Many praised
Ellen lor her courage.
As the only gay lead in
a primetime sitcom,
she is being hailed as
a role model for gays
and lesbians everv-

where.
"Finally, pop culture has supplied us with a
role model. .. . She's humorous, she's beautiful,
she's us," said freshman |osh Chao. "I'm very
proud ot her. In one show she's expressed a range
of emotions; I felt with her."
The episode moved through a variety of emo
tional sentiments, from I lien's realization that
she's gay to coming out to her friends and finally
to her first relationship hitting the rocks. Ellen
shows that gay lifestyles are no different from
straight ones — they face the same problems and
have just as much love, though social pressure to
conform to straight lifestyles can create more
problems than it should.
And that pressure comes from everywhere,
particularly from the Christian right, who con

demned the show for exposing a "sinful" and
"unnatural" lifestyle choice.
For example, in one scene DeGeneres flies into
a panic when Dern begins to make romantic over
tures toward her. DeGeneres accuses Dern of
being part of a conspiracy to "recruit" straights to
become homosexuals.
"Why yes, Ellen, and to think I was this close to
getting that toaster," said Dern mocking De-
Generes' remarks.
Once Ellen herself accepts the fact that she's
gay, a whole host of thorny issues still lies in wait.
As she comes out to her closest friends, most are
accepting, though one female friend is somewhat
more apprehensive than the others. Ellen also has
nightmares about how she will fit into a straight
world as an open lesbian. Finally, Ellen has prob
lems on the romantic front, facing her First
breakup after going out with Dern for two days.
Although this was done in the context of com
edy to make it more palatable, still the lesbian, gay
and bisexual audience was able to relate very seri
ous real world experiences to those shown on
Ellen.
"It was so great, growing up in Stockton. 1 did
not know any gay people," said sophomore Alex
Sepiol. "For a lot of people, this will be their way
of connecting and will be a sense of affirmation."
All the hype surrounding the Ellen episode has

caused a tidal wave of other gay-related competi
tors on the scene. "Married with Children" re
cently featured Amanda Rearse, who is a lesbian
playing a straight role, in a cameo appearance as
her usual character's lesbian cousin. And NBC
had the brother of one of the show's most macho
characters come out on the show, all trying to ride
the wave of Ellen's popularity.
Someone once said that a person can write for
25 years and not achieve the same impact as with
one minute on TV. Ellen has cracked the surface
of a long frozen lake of emotions, perhaps causing
a thaw many gays and lesbians, both in and out of
the closet, will look to for support and realization
that they are not alone. O
