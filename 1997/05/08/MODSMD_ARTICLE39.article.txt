## It's shear madness! 
### 
Want to try your hand at solving a murder mystery?
"Shear Madness" is one of the best tickets around to a hi
larious stint as a gumshoe. A zany comedy full of local, up
to-the-minute humor, "Shear Madness" is the whodunit's
reply to "Beach Blanket Babylon."
"Shear Madness" is the longest-running nonmusical
play in the Guinness Book of World Records, with 3,225
consecutive performances by the Boston cast as of No
vember 1987. It is currently running worldwide.
The play has garnered numerous awards, including

best play or comedy of the year from the Mystery Writers
of America, Boston Globe Readers' Poll Award, Chicago
Tribune Reader's Poll Award and Philadelphia Daily
News. It is based on German playwright Paul Portner's
1963 play, "Scherenschnitt," which was a straight murder
mystery, and was adapted into comedic form by Marilyn
Abramsand Bruce Jordan of Cranberry Productions Inc.
The action takes place in a unisex hairstyling salon. The
murder occurs off-stage, and clues are planted through
out the first half of the play. People run in and out of the

salon, scream at one another,
gesture flamboyantly, lose their
train ot thought, sneak around
and generally are in comedic
overdrive. There .ire plenty of
malapropisins thrown into the
dialogue for you to catch if
you're fast enough and have a
good vocabulary.
In tlic second half, the audi
ence is invited to join in the
sleuthing, and this is when the
real fun begins. The chief inves
tigator does a line job egging on
the audience and provoking the
witnesses and suspects into re
vealing what they know. I Erst
while detectives are treated to
healthy doses of skepticism and
balderdash from defiant sus
pects who are willing to lie
about almost anything, so be

prepared to be (mildly) insulted.
The small cast of characters includes two stylists, fabu
lously gay Tony Whitcomb (Matt Callahan) and Chiqui
ta banana outrageous Barbara Pe Marco (Francine Tor
res). There are also four customers: sensible Nick Rosetti
((Christopher I'arjan), wet-behind the ears Mikey Chen
(Carrett Hoo), sophisticated socialite Kleanor Shubert
(Nellie Cravens) and successful businessman Iddic
Lawrence (1,0 l l evy).
(Callahan was especially entertaining even co stai
I'arjan had a hard time keeping a straight lace when pre
sented with his wackiness, anil the two actors' rapport
was unusually goofy. The cast plays off one another in
grand style, spontaneously changing the plot during
every performance in response to the latest news*, asts and
that evening's audience. Thus, no two performances are
alike, and the solution to the crime changes from da\ to
day.
And il you're traveling this summer, you can catch
"Shear Madness" in Barcelona, Buenos Aires, lei Aviv and
Melbourne, among other c ities. The in jokes will give vou
a good idea ol the local culture, and the amatcui slciilh in
you (should you choose to participate) will have a rip
roaring time.
