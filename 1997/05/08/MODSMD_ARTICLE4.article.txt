A three-day conference titled "Movements
of the Avant-Garde" begins today and will
provide a forum to discuss the topic of the
avant-garde and its relevance in different cul
tural contexts.
Avant-garde is a name for movements that
took place in the first half of the 20th century.
It refers to the style of art in painting, music
and poetry and can lx? characterized as exper
iments in the techniques of art, according to
Robert Harrison, vice chair of the French and
Italian Department. 1 le will chair one of five
panel discussions during the conference.
The phrase avant-garde comes from the
French military term for troops on the front
line. The term also refers to artists and poets
who iire at the cutting edge in form and con
tent in their field.

The conference attempts to give a defini
tion to movements of the avant-garde. It will
look at avant-garde through a "historical fx*r
spective, now that we have historical distance
on the time period," I larrison said.
The conference will also explore the impact
of the cultural interaction that took place
when technological advances in the 1920s al
lowed artists to travel between Europe and
Latin America, said Joy ('onion, fine of the
event's organizers and a doctoral student in
Spanish and Portuguese.
The conference will include discussion of
the Harlem Renaissance, Italian futurists and
the difference between avant-garde in Latin
America and Europe.
"What I like about this conference is that it
doesn't just cover the classical French avant-
garde but also covers other move
ments such as the liatin American
one," Harrison said.
Graduate students from the de
partments of Spanish and Por
tuguese, French and Italian and
Comparative Literature organized
the conference. The events are op
portunities for the students to pre
sent their work alongside that of fa
mous scholars.
"What is exciting about the con
ference is that we have people com
ing from all over the world," Conlon

said. Conference participants will
come from Brazil, Argentina, Italy,
Germany and Canada.
Non-Stanford participants in
clude University of Pennsylvania

The conference is divided into
five panels addressing bodies, tra
jectories, borders, commodities and
