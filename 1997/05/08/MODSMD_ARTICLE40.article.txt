Sati Francisco's Bleeding Stone Theatre is presenting a
production of Albert Camus' "Caligula' that is thought
provoking and mildly entertaining hut not quite worth a
trip to the (lity.
Performed in a tiny theater, "(laligula" provides its 50-
person house with a decent show, not a breathtaking per
formance. If you like theater and are looking to spend an
evening in San Francisco,"(laligula" will provide you with
the opportunity, hut don't expect to he da/zled.
Albert Camus, famous novelist and absurdist / exis
tentialist philosopher, was awarded the Nobel Prize lor
I iterature in 1957. He wrote "Caligula in 1938 at the age
of 25. He revised it many times before its initial debut in
Paris in 1945. The play is about a mad Roman emperor
who, after his sister's death, begins a mortal quest to
achieve the impossible. Ile orders the moon to be bi light
to him, dresses up as the goddess Venus and demands
total devotion from his subjects.
Caligula forces the people of Rome to face the "truths
ol existence" by decreeing execution and famine. Accord
ing to Phillip Thody, author of "Albert Camus: A Bio
graphic Study," "Caligula" is "an illustration of the dan
gers involved in going too tar in acting out the conse
quences of living in a world without values."
"Caligula" is hard to enjoy, especially it you're not into
li\e theater. Camus' characters speak in the tradition of
the (I reek tragedy but with a hint of modern-day speech
and an intention to jar the modern-day mind.
Star / director Jeff Mcl )onald does a mediocre job with
tins difficult piece. His direction is traditional — all the
signs of a student director can be detected as the work un
ravels. The blocking is awkward, and the actors .ire often
out of view. In such a small space, movement and place
ment are crucial, and McDonald s attention to these de
tails is not precise enough to make the show work.
As the lead, Mcl )onald doesn't quite cut it. Though his
performance is believable and gets better as the show pro
gresses, he never quite sinks into his character. As a result,
the show is led by an almost sluggish performance. Mc-
Donald's stage presence is lackluster and his speech is mo
notone; he often falls into a traditional, dramatic voice

pattern characteristic of student actors. He has a grand
disregard for pauses in speech, preventing the meat ol his
lines from having significant impact.
McDonald cast a lot of actors who are clearly new at
on stage performance. The most obvious sign of this in
experience is in the players' gestures. Many of the begin
ning actors are troubled by the infamous question: Where
do I put my hands?
As a whole, the actors also fall into the traditional pat
tern of dramatic speech, not concentrating on individual
characterization and not taking risks with their roles. I bis
gives the show an undesirable fluidity, ruining what could
have been a steady but engaging rhythm.
The leading lady, I lorentina Mocanu (Cesonia), is a
distraction with her Romanian accent and often seems re
moved from the play. But her elegance is unmatched and
her portrayal of the reluctant but devoted wife is ade
quate.
I he troupe of Roman civilians is, for the most part, un
engaging. Ty Richardson (Octavius) and Vonn Su>tt Bair
(Mereia) are dreadful .is Rome's victimized citizens. I )ena
Hysell anticipates

each event with her
movements and ex
pressions.
One of the best
performances in the
show is that of Kevin
Nolan Caston
(Cherea), the
"leader" of the coun
try's laymen. He takes
risk with his charac
ter and portrays the
intelligent Greek
philosopher with
great clarity. He is fo
cused, as is Roger
Larson (Old Patri
cian), whose portray
al of an old man is

true to definition, simple but intriguing.
There is one portion of the show th.it is particularly
horrid, however a cameo featuring the poets ot Rome.
The scene is meant to further evince (Caligula's oppression
of the people but fails miserably because of terrible direi
tion anil, surprisingly enough, .111 oirrcharaeteri/ation by
the actors.
Another more excusable but distracting aspect that
could have been prevented was that almost every actor
had an embarrassing episode struggling with the togas.
I )espitc these imperfections,"(laligula" is a quaint play
that meets the expectations ol a small production. If you
are in search of excitement or incredulous talent, howev
er, you're better off taking a trip to the movies.

Caligula (r-Jeff McDonald) sure is having fun painting that bald guy's head.
