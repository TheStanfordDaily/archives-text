Behind every good party is a good I)), but behind every good
D| is not necessarily a company like Big Fun. Independent spin
sters are becoming more and more common, and they are try
ing their best to keep the original spirit alive in this world of
commercial party DJs. In their dorm rooms, among their beds
and books, these student I )Js spin the night away, mixing songs
with fingers flying across records and mixer switches.

some trip-hop and acid jazz. Some do disco, some do techno,
some do ambient and trance. Some work house and (rat par

work alone in their own rooms, grooving away with head-

Some break out of their rooms to draw ideas from others. It
helped me a lot to listen to other peoples mix tapes and mix
CDs," said senior James Long, who focuses on trance music
played in rave main rooms. A lot ol what I ve learned has come
from listening to other people."
In addition to experimenting with different sounds and ef
fects, there are a few key elements every I)) must know. Ihe first
is beat-matching.
A mixer allows the DJ to control the pitch and speed of the
music so that as one song is playing, he can listen to another song
with headphones and line up the beats lor a smooth transition.
"Beat matching is fundamental in keeping the music con
tinuous," Jesus explained.
A good D| must have "a keen ear that can hear minute dif
ferences in beats and that can know what songs go well togeth
er,' Long said. "Some people can do it better than others, de
spite having the same amount ot experience.
Most people think of scratching when they think ol a D| at
the turntables, but this is a skill mostly used by house and hip
hop I )Js.
"I don't do a lot of scratching," Long said, "because it doesn t
really flow with the kind ot music I play."
In the absence of scratching, there is still a lot a I )| can do to
create special effects. What Long does is "take songs that rein
the same key that'll go well together and overlap them to make
a new sound.'
Long plays trance music, which he describes as generally
having a (latter heat and a fuller sound, and some ol the simpler
songs can be easier to combine this way. "Essentially, the sim
pier the song is, the easier it is to combine it with something else
and make it sound good,' he said.
In addition to being able to create effects, being able to read
the crowd is also key, according to lesns. "A lot of I Ms miss look
ingat the crowd and judging when they're playing good music,"
he said.
As for the kind of music they play, Jesus noted that general
lv people (at Stanford) like '80s music, but he also tries to judge
by requests. One has to be careful in this situation, though, be

"A lot of people are afraid that vinyl will die out," Logan said.
Vinyl is "getting expensive because it's so rare. Some undei

Speaking of the digital players, Long, who still uses turnta
