INTERMISSION UNCOVERS

phones on and pumping out mix tapes to sell. No matter what
shape or size the\ come in, these I )|s are true musicians, using
theii equipment as instruments to create new music.
As opposed to those who play songs one after another, "now
a I )| is someone who ust-s the turntable as an instrument to
make something thai wasn't there before," sophomore hip hop
I)| lavier Torres said. "You don't play records you play
turntables."
So whv do they do it? Why spend countless dollars on sound
systems, turntables and stacks of records? l or most, there is
only one reason.
"A true 1 M is into it because he loves the music and wants to
share it with other people," said senior lon Logan, who plays
ambient music in rave "chill rooms."
I or the most part, the impetus stems from this basic love of
music.
"I've always liked controlling the music at parties," said iu
nior Jesus lories, who picked up turntables and a mixer in high
sthool, but didn't really start to 1 )| until this year.
"I got started as a freshman," Javier said, describing his
nights out at various parties. "After a while I wouldn't even
dance anymore. I'd just watch the l>Js."
I lowever they get hooked, actually learning how to I )| is still
probably the hardest part for these aspiring spinsters.
"You need to have dedication," Javier explained. "The first
couple of weeks you just sound like garbage. You have to have
patience.
"Basically, I just learned by myself. I locked myself in my
room for hours and hours."

CAMPUS DJS AND THEIR FUNKY HABITS

cause a 1 >I can lose the whole crowd il he plays a song that onh
three people wanted to hear.
In situations like this, Javier mentioned that he has a lew
major songs like "I et Me < lear My Throat and a new remix ol
"Sweet I )reams" th.it area sure way to get people dancing again.
lor rave I)Is, relating to the crowd is less ol a problem sim
ply because ol the nature ol raves, because most are all night
events, people will generally sta\ lor long periods ol time any
way.
Raves are different from regular parties in that there's not
"the meat market atmosphere. I 'here's a lot more energy, and
it's more ol a shared experience,' according to l ong.
Logan feels most at home in ambient, or "chill," rooms at
raves, where people go to get away from the high energy ol the
main dance floor. (:hill rooms are usually lined with pillows and
blankets, so people can inst come in and relax and socialize.
"I find it more rewarding I )Jing in a chill room," I ogan said.
"You can commune with people much more than on the main
dance floor, and you can even go and talk to people." I le said it
is also not uncommon to have live bands in chill rooms.
Logan's main genre of music is this ambient music, which is
generally relaxing and soothing but is difficult to categori/e be
cause its so vaguely defined, according to Logan.
"The genre is expanding and growing," Logan said. "It's neat
to see all the different styles blurring and crossing."
Despite the more unifying atmosphere at raves, the same
impetus remains for rave 1 )Js as other types of I )|s to do what
they do.
"The sole reason I'm in it is because of the music. The at

money tor records. A I)J who can't buy any records is a very sail
tiling.' I ong said he would D| anything short ot top 40 music
for money. "I very penny I don't use to pay bills I use to bu\
records."
In addition to the struggle tor recognition, the work ot I b
has left something else to be desired.
Logan put it simply: "We need more women I>)s."
I hose existing D|s, the backbone of any rocking party, have
kept their passions and fingers flying and will continue to bring
music to the rest of us — unless, of course, they run out of mone\
Until then, keep on spinning, guys. And start spinning, girls. IS
