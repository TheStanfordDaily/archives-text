We shall not cease from exploration
At the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

I he Caltrain is that familiar steel carriage of well-worn vinyl
seats and sweat-slimy chrome bars. It's that nondescript pod of
transport that lifts us to shopping excursions in the city or yet
another Big Game challenge. Not quite the shrine to house an
art installation.
Hut somehow 14 undergraduates and graduate students,
under the tutelage of fine arts master's student Gregory Lam
Niemeyer, have discovered a generative quality in the often
overlooked local rail system. "Train Stories," a visual arts pro
ject created by the "Digital Art in Public Spaces" class, lends a
respectful nod to the Caltrain crews and the stories that have
graced their tracks. The public installation of nearly 100 images
— including large posters mounted on columns at the San
Francisco terminal, as well as smaller on-board posters — is on
display now and will be through June 6.

t ions, the class encountered
the amazingly obvious but
often overlooked charac
teristics of train life. They
learned that people actual

ever, the students soon realized that the moving installation
space should he regarded as something more significant than
simply a blank exhibition wall.
"When first told ot the project," said senior Ruth Williams,
"I was under the impression that it would be like elementary
school art class. We'd just stick our art work on the walls of the
Caltrain. Hut the more we talked about it, the more we talked
about having a group project. We wanted the project to look
unified and to look like it belonged there.'
To extract what "belonged there," the class simply asked the
population within the train.
"We interviewed people 011 the train to see what they would
like to see," Williams said. "They wanted something colorful
and something reflective of the community."
The team of student artists then decided that they should
document the immediate Caltrain community, the communi
ty of individuals who maintain the rails each day. Establishing a
proper frame of mind to delve into their subjects' interior qual
ities, the members of the class developed a sense of respect for
their interviewees and, as Lam Niemeyer suggests, a sense of
connection.
"In a deeper sense, the students developed a sense of relation
and connecting between people over a period of time — grow
ing into a larger set of human relationships, introducing larger
and more meaningful exchanges. When the interviewees
sensed that you were more part of their experience, they relat
ed a more intimate experience."
Like documentarians on the prowl for that so-called decisive
moment or that subtext embedded deep within the cosmetic
narrative, the class set out to tap into the sub-story beneath the
daily train commute — aided, of course, by an exquisitely sen
sitive curiosity. During their field excursions to the train sta

train is not in fact automated and that people there do enjoy
and are quite proud of their work. "All of these discoveries,"
Lam Niemeyer said, "led to where the project is now."
Religious studies master's student Karen Matsuoka, along
with her fellow project collaborators, made her discoveries by
developing what could he a gently empathetic understanding of
her artistic subject.
"Behind the scene, the workers are thinking for your safety,
your comfort, manufacturing a pleasurable experience to take
you where you need to be. All that's on your mind is going to
the place where you want to be.
"For passengers, a train is a mode of transport," she contin
ued. "For a lot of the workers, they have a deep relationship
with the train. It doesn't come out in so many words but in the
way they talk about the community that forms with people
coming in and out of the train."
Eventually the workers, fitting comfortably within the inter
viewer-interviewee dynamic, divulged the unspoken — tales of
train suicides, fatalities and near misses. "It takes a lot of effort
on their part to handle such traumatic events so it doesn't affect
the passengers themselves," Matsuoka noted.
The result of their months of field excursions, interviewing
and camera shoots isa series of posters chronicling theC altrain

tribute to train culture.
Working on the tribute, the students rekindled .in affection
ate regard for trains.
"I love the trains," said senior (iliris Maliwat. "They provide
a lifeline for people, not only to get to and from work but to pro
vide a ritual. Talking to the workers — including workers who
had been working there for 17 to 20 years — it's interesting to
hear how methodical and habitual train life has become."
Perhaps this auspicious regard is one that has been latent
since childhood, a time when trainlovewas not a necessarily de
viant passion.
"Children are fascinated by the sheer physical mass," l ain
Niemeyer remarked. "It's very much a womb. It can transport
you safely and provide a sense of being together with a group of
people in an enclosed space while gently rolling along. It's so
momentous, rushing to catch the train, this cultural event.
Everyone's a bit nervous, rushing to meet up at the right mo
ment. It provides a common experience of moving, which is
more physically engaging than doing it by yourself. When more
people experience an event, it's more true, more authentic."
Not only is trainlove limited to children, beings who are un
afraid to link a passionate response to a bulk of chromed pub
lie transport. It's also limited to people who value the train as a

cultural necessity.
"The conception of train culture started lor me when 1
worked in japan," Maliwat said. "In a culture where it's a neces
sity, it's interesting. In the U.S., it's just a luxury to have it avail
able."
l ain Niemeyer made a similar remark regarding the Euro
pean regard of the train as a fertile ground for social dialogue.
"If you take a train in Hurope, it's a vessel of exchange, l'eo
pie mix in a way that they wouldn't tend to. They mix and tell
stories knowing that they won't see each other again. That cli
mate of sharing stories makes the d.iilv commute somewhat of
an adventure."
The architecture that houses train stations is often indicative
of a culture's respect, or lack of, toward the railway's cultural
significance. The glorious architecture of New York's (irand
Central Terminal is now but a reminder of .1 faded railway rev
erence. Train station architecture these days is a far ry from the
euphemistic engineering of Leland Stanford's railway times or
even in modern Europe where trains are framed as significant
vehicles.
"The train stations in Hurope are the most ama/.ing cos
mopolitan places," Lun Niemeyer said. "Hut theC 'altrain station
is such an underrated, de-emphasi/ed facility. Maybe with our
art we can reframe that and show it how beneficial it really is."

The challenge of a public installation lies not only in efftv
lively harnessing the ideas collected and materials used to ere
ate the final printed product. Ii is, especially lor Matsuoka, de.il
ing with the considerations behind exhibiting .1 work ol art in
the public domain.

These are things you don't necessarily think about during the
creative process. I thought that public art was fine art in a pub
lie space. Public art is ac tually about dealing with what you can
express and the needs of the audience. It's entirely different. A
successful public art project is not necessarily a successful fine
art project. And vice versa."
Setting aside the idiosyncrasies of individual artists
in favor of a public intention connotes the Sot ialist Real
ist agendas of, say, Mao Isetung, who fervently appealed
for a "mass art" an art form that fused the thoughts
