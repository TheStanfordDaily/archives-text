The reason? Out with a few

train from the 1920s and"the
longest train in the world," as
certified by the (iuinness Hook ot

Trains to a graffiti artist are
like newly papered walls to a tod

tory. So out came the spray cans
and on went the paint.
They did a nice "piece" (an
involved, detailed painting) on
one train, but they just put
"throw-ups" (simple two-color
words) on the others. These
throw-ups mostly consisted of
their "tags," which are graffiti
writer names (e.g., Neonski,
Cravone).

"When the news crew came, they showed the damage that
we'd done, not the nice painting," said Neonski, who had unwit
tingly implicated himself by putting his spray cans in and
around the trains and the tracks.
Fach paint can had his tag on it, identifying him as the owner
of the cans and making it look like he was the main vandal. And
according to Neonski, the TV crews portrayed him just so.
Neonski was not aware of the historical value of those trains.
"The more I found out about it, the more I felt bad. But queseni,

recounting the story of Todd lohnson — tag name Fstria
who was caught red-handed" one week after Shaw "looked him
in the eye and asked him if he did graffiti." Fstria had looked
right back at him and answered no.
"lust m that oik night he was caught, he'd done over $5,000

He was especialh exultant about catching this particular
graffiti vandal because Fstria had called him earlier and asked
him il there was some sort of spray or coating he could put on
his graffiti in order to keep other people from tagging on it.
