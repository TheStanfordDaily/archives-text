their name up."
Crayone, now in his ,M)s, doesn't deny that the thrill moti
vates him as well.
"Now that I'm older, I've come to reali/e that I really love the
actual cra/.iness, the actual chaotic-ness of graffiti and (I love)
that graffiti shouldn't he controlled."
I he thrill of illicit activity is the reason why laws and pro
grams designed to stop graffiti are ineffective, according to
Brooke Levin, Oakland's environmental services manager.
Levin said that a few years ago, the city put up a few wall-size
hoards specifically designated tor legal graffiti.
It wasn t a solution. 1 hey still kept tagging on private prop
erty," she said. "It's the thrill. I'he people that tag seem to want
to do things on the edge."
It's what Levin and Shaw call a thrill that sounds more like
passion when Crayone tells of late night homhing runs.
"I love it when it's chaotic," said Crayone. "We all get

together and have .1 great time. There's
no hierarchy. It's a group thing; every
one understands their role. I here's

something beautiful about creating
something from chaos — from chaos to creativity."
Sounds beautiful. Yet the popular media depicts graffiti as
anything but a gift to the walls it graces.
Oayone does admit that another side exists: "There's a
destructive part ot graffiti, and a creative part. < iraffiti is creat
ing; creating is part of destroying."
I his is true even of the way graffiti artists treat each others'
pieces, by constantly writing over the work of others, also
known as "disrespecting" it. Size, who was doing a piece on a
wall when I met him, said that ( ravone and I had caught him
in a rare moment.
"I usually only paint freight trains," lie said. "The walls are a
waste, because people will paint over them in a tew weeks."
Although Oayone agrees that people are always doing "dis
respects," he doesn't wish it were otherwise.
"(iraffiti is ever-changing, while art on a canvas will always be
|the way it is |he said. With graffiti, "you come back the next
week to the same piece, and maybe it's been disrespected, but it's
the city's art — with or without permission.

The city's art... even without permission. Or
is it then the city's multi-million dollar nuisance?
from the perspective of city officials like
Shavv, permission is the only thing that matters.
"We do not look at the content on the wall.
We look at permission to do it. It they have pet
mission to do it, it's OK — we're not censors. II
they don't have a commission, then it's graffiti.
We're looking tor commission or permission.
This is not an anarchy."
Permission is also the reason Sliaw sees the
phrase "graffiti artist" as an oxymoron.
"An artist has something that the community
wants, it's not forced on you,'' Shaw said. "Artists
don't come in your house and paint the wall and
damage your wall and say,' You're going to like it
because I'm an artist."'
"What they |graffiti writers] do is no less than
if they broke the windows in your car ... or if
they keyed your car. No one would say, 'Oh,
there's a nice etching on my car!' " he said.
for Shaw, the issue of permission obviates
any possibility that even the most elaborate graf-

fiti "vandalism" could he graffiti "art."
('rayone's perspective on the permission issue is quite differ
ent from Shaw's.
F.uropeans "came over here and they raped the Indians of
the land," he said. "This is like doing the same hack. Graffiti is
about property and when it's not yours, it's vandalism.
"But whose property is it anyway? Do you take the property

with vou when you die?"
For ( rayone, practicing graffiti is lus way ot questioning the
legitimacy ot property. "I don't believe in ownership of land," he
said.
Fskae, an Oakland artist who painted a now-gone mural for
Burbank House a few years ago, also felt no remorse about
marking up public property.
" I here are a lot ot other things that are costing people
money," he said. Why should he feel guilty, he asked, when
"we're spending tons ol money on defense missiles to go into
other countries and steal their oil?"
Perhaps the "well, I'm not as bad as they are" attitude is scant
justification tor costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year,
but l.skae pointed out an inherent difference between spending
money on defense and spending money on cleaning up gratti
ti.
Graffiti "is a creative act. It's not a violent thing; it's a creative

thing. It has to do with the creative force of art."

Ah, yes — art, graffiti s other face.
Every graffiti artist / vandal with whom I spoke said art
was the main reason they persisted in creating their ephemer
al, unrecognized art form.

"When my friends and I talk about graffiti, all I tin is talk
about art. Art, art, art, art,' said Grayorje. "When I do graffiti, I
think of it as a fine art. I'm sick and tired of hearing |grafliti's|
got to he separate from gallery art.
Imagia, one of the two female graffiti writers I found, liked
the tact th.it graffiti was separate from gallery art.
"I hate galleries and I hate how art's a commodity right
now," she said.
Art is "definitely not about money. It its out on the street, and
I iust want to put it up, it's free, it's not a commodity, said Imagia.
Neonski considers graffiti art a "public service."
"If you were to turn a corner into an alley and it was gray, black
and ding)', would that cheer you up? Hut turning a corner and see

ing a bright mural that would brighten up my day,' he said.
But what if the mural is of a penis and scrawled underneath
are the words "The Most l ucked ?
Shaw comes into the picture once again.
According to him, precisely this image hung proudly, high
up on a building at the corner of Ninth and Folsom Streets for
months. Graffiti abatement crews could not remove it right

me and said, I used to he afraid

because I could never tell it there was someone standing oil
here because ot the figures.
Neonski had a response to that story.
Su»tt Shaw doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.
Neonski said that while Psycho ( ity was still there, couple
would walk by with their cameras to take pictures.
When Shaw heard that, he seemed stumped .it first. I hen In
said,"ll it's pretty and nice to look at, then why didn't the build
