Intermission: How's the tour going?
Ferrick: Really well. I started in Boulder,
Colo., on March 26, and joined Lisa Ger
mano in Minneapolis on April 1. We've been
touring together since then, and our last
show together is on May 5. After Stanford I
work my way hack to L.A. through Mon
terey.
I: When was the Inst time you played at
Stanford?
i ; : I think it was two years ago, at the Cof
fee 1 louse.
/: How was it?
F: It was fun. People were appreciative.
/: And this time around, you're the final
event in the "Herstory" celebration. How does
thiit feel?
I : It adds .i little pressure, just to he good.
"Ilerstory" is a celebration of women
throughout history, l ight! 1
I: Yeah, ami there's also a focus on women in
contemporary culture, too. What 's up with the
new album?
I: I put out "Melissa I errick +1 on my
own. After the split with Atlantic, I put out
an I I 1 on cassette, and the feedback I got was
that people wanted CDs, not cassettes. So I
started taping live shows onto DAT from the
soundboard. 1 thought I'd have a lot of mate
rial to work with because I was playing in
I .A. every other week, but only two out of 10
tapes came out. So I made 2,000 copies and
took them with me to my first show in boul
der. After the show a rep from W.A.R. (What

Arc Records) Records, who are based in Boulder,
bought the disc. He talked to me about it, and
then I basically gave W.A.R. the album. It's going
to be released on June 17.
/: How docs it feel to be on an independent label
after working with a major label like Atlantic?
F: I'm thrilled to be on an indie label. It's a lot
more tun to be a bigger fish in a smaller sea.
There's more attention given to me by the label
and loss competition with the other artists on the
label. Internal competition doesn't really exist at
W.A.R. — that's just the vibe they have going on.
At Atlantic, the atmosphere started to interfere
with my playing. I got tired of being jealous, hav
ing self hatred because I wasn't doing as well as
other artists on the label and feeling like I sucked.
/: Are you concerned with W.A.R.'s ability to pro
mote you?
F: Not at all. W.A.R. has The Samples on board.
If the label can support a band with a gold record,

it's capable of giving me the support I need. They
go about it in a really good way, too; we're starting
by targeting college radio, which is something
that didn't happen at Atlantic. Atlantic tried to
push me right in at AAA radio, which was like
skipping a couple important steps. We're going to
go back and cover that ground that we missed.
I: What's the breakdown between new songs vs.
older tunes, in terms of what have you been playing
on this tour?
F: Definitely mostly new stuff. The thing is, on
the new album there are two tracks from both
"Willing To Wait" [her first album) and "Massive
Blur" [her second album], which is about one
third of this album.

I: How did it feel to put out a live album instead
of working iti the studio?
F: It was great. There's even a hidden track on
there, which I did with a band and threw in for fun.
/: What's going on with the cover art?
F: 1 only had enough money for four panels.
On the first two albums I put all the lyrics, but I
figured it wasn't a big deal on this one. 1 didn't
want to have to include a thank-you list, either; in
seven years of touring, I've met enough people
that I'd like to thank (including some folks at At
lantic) that the album would become a novel.
Anyway, I'm friends with the owner of the club
where I play in L.A., and he always lets me have a
huge guest list, 25 or 30 people, which is pretty
much unheard of. The thing is that I don't get
paid on nights like that. I once had 42 people on
the guest list!
So the cover is really the thank yous; most of
the people on it are new, and only a few people

from the industry are there, like Tommy, my man
ager. At Atlantic, they sat me down and told me,
'Here's who you need to thank, and here's the
order." They had me thanking some CEO of a
radio station, whom I had never met. I thought
that was ridiculous. They told me that people re
ally do read those thank yous.
I: That's true, sometimes. I read them.
F: Yeah, but some radio station CEO isn't going
to read them or care whether his name is before
someone else's.
/: On the fact sheet sent out by Hidden Water
Music, it describes you as a "girl with her guitar."
F: Is that from Hidden Water? 1 didn't write
that. That's not getting sent out anymore. I'm a

folk singer / songwriter at heart. I'm not
political like Ani [Difranco], but there
are similarities. The thing is, people like
to be able to categorize according to
what they already know, what they're
comfortable with. Hut everybody has
different paths, and why should 1 be
locked into something musically that
someone else is doing? 1 do what I do be
cause 1 can't not do it, and I'll keep on
doing it as long as 1 can, as long as I'm
strong enough physically, emotionally,
financially and spiritually. Until I'm
done.
I: What are sonic of your musical in
fluences that lire a little off the beaten
track?
F: Well, I really like Luka Bloom and
Shawn Colvin, but they're not really sur
prises. I think that K.I). Lang h.is the best
voice of our generation. When Su/anne
Vega's first album came out, everything
was Pepeche Mode, right? And it was
just ama/ing to hear, (irowing up, 1 )erek
and the Dominoes album was always
getting played around my house, and so
were Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
Everybody's got records in their collec
tion that they're a little embarrassed
about but still really like, and those two
are mine.
I: You've been making music for a long
time, right?

F: Yeah. 1 started doing that violin
thing at age 5 but didn't really like it, so I switched
to trumpet. When 1 got into the Berklee College of
Music I realized that I didn't want to play in a
symphony, so I bought an acoustic guitar.
/: When you bought that guitar, were you at nil
influenced by the way a guitar is a social instru
ment?
F: 1 got it with every intention of singing and
playing live. It was in 1988, and "Fast Car," by
Tracy Chapman, had just come out. "Luka," by
Suzanne Vega, was all over the place. Sinead
O'Connor's album came out a few months later.
Everybody was asking, "Is folk back?" They didn't
understand that it hadn't ever gone anyplace.
There's a whole folk scene down in New York City,
and when I found out about it, it was like, hey,
people have been here doing this for decades. And
I love it. It's a great way to make a living. Q

different paths, and why should 1 be
locked into something musically that
someone else is doing? 1 do what I do be
cause 1 can't not do it, and I'll keep on
doing it as long as 1 can, as long as I'm
strong enough physically, emotionally,
financially and spiritually. Until I'm
done.
I: What are sonic of your musical in
fluences that lire a little off the beaten
track?
F: Well, I really like Luka Bloom and
Shawn Colvin, but they're not really sur
prises. I think that K.I). Lang h.is the best
voice of our generation. When Su/anne
Vega's first album came out, everything
was Pepeche Mode, right? And it was
just ama/ing to hear, (irowing up, 1 )erek
and the Dominoes album was always
getting played around my house, and so
were Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
Everybody's got records in their collec
tion that they're a little embarrassed
about but still really like, and those two
are mine.
I: You've been making music for a long
time, right?

F: Yeah. 1 started doing that violin
thing at age 5 but didn't really like it, so I switched
to trumpet. When 1 got into the Berklee College of
Music I realized that I didn't want to play in a
symphony, so I bought an acoustic guitar.
/: When you bought that guitar, were you at nil
influenced by the way a guitar is a social instru
ment?
F: 1 got it with every intention of singing and
playing live. It was in 1988, and "Fast Car," by
Tracy Chapman, had just come out. "Luka," by
Suzanne Vega, was all over the place. Sinead
O'Connor's album came out a few months later.
Everybody was asking, "Is folk back?" They didn't
understand that it hadn't ever gone anyplace.
There's a whole folk scene down in New York City,
and when I found out about it, it was like, hey,
people have been here doing this for decades. And
I love it. It's a great way to make a living. Q
