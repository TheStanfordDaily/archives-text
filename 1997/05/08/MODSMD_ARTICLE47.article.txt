# PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED?
## Singer / Activist Casey Neill performed last Thursday at Freight and Salvage in Berkeley 
### 
Intermission caught Casey Neill after
the show to get his comments on his
music, his place in the industry and the
importance of social awareness.
Intermission: The music you play has
been described as "Celtic-inspired mongrel
rebel folk" What styles of music influence
you? What do you listen to? How would
you describe your own music?
Neill: I listen to and am influenced by
a lot of Irish music and musicians and
bands based in other rootsy traditions. 1
guess I would say my music is country- or
Celtic-based — combined with rock and
roll energy and a punk sensibility.
I: Your music seems to have such strong
political ideas, and a lot of older folk music
does, too. I)o you see yourself within that
folk tradition of "protest music"?
N: in most — almost all — tradition
al music there's some aspect of social
awareness: Most traditional music forms
reflect their cultural situation in some
way, which often comes out like protest
or social commentary. On the other
hand, 1 think a lot of contemporary
music has strayed away from that to sing
about personal stuff. Not to disparage
songs about personal issues; that kind of
music has always had its place, too. But
there's a disturbing trend within folk to
play that kind of music, too — Pete
Seeger calls it "belly button music." A lot
of "folk" musicians now are just playing
pop songs on acoustic guitar.
I: So is a political and social conscience
necessary to play folk music?
N: Well, not necessarily, but I think
you need to be aware of what's going on
around you. You can tell the people who
are looking outward, not inward. Even if
they're singing personal songs, you can
tell if they have roots in the culture, an
eye on the culture, if they're paying atten
tion. And if you are paying attention,
you're bound to react. People think
protest songs and political music is a
genre. Some "political" singers dislike
love songs, but I think that good political
songs are love songs— love of a place or
of justice. On the other hand, a lot of love
songs can be pretty political [it they're
dealing with gender, sexual orientation,
etc.].
I; What impact do you want your music
to have on society? Are you content mostly
reaching people who are already politically
active, or do you want to take your message
to a larger audience?
N: Well, 1 don't have any kind of a
rockstar complex. If I could till a room
this size every night, I think I'd be happy.
Any larger than this would be frightening.
I don't think "preaching to the con
verted" is a bad thing if it's inspiring
thSSTpeople. It's very hard to be an ac
tivist and keep going against so much op
position. If resistance movements have a
culture to them — support in art, music,
whatever — that's what keeps them
going, keeps them doing what they do. If
I can do that, then I'm happy.

The flier for environmental activist and folk singer
Casey Neill's show at Berkeley's Freight and Salvage
Coffeehouse advertised a "Celebration of Wildness
and Autonomy," and at first the signs seemed right for this to
take place. It was May Day, sacred to both pagans and social
ists, and the small group chattering expectantly around the
Earth First! table in the lobby seemed to draw equally from
both groups. The venue, a cavernous coffeehouse in one of
Berkeley's most resolutely activist areas, seemed perfect for
generating the promised celebration.
When showtime arrived and the hall was still less than
half-full, however, that promise seemed less likely to be fill
tilled. The audience, largely a Berkeley-typical mix of graying
hippies and yuppies with a smattering of younger environ
mentalist types, didn't appear the sort to celebrate their wild
ness without a lot ot coaxing. It might be Beltane, the Celtic
New Year, but the sparse crowd and low energy made it feel
like a PTA meeting.
Neill, a thin, pale guy with a scruffy beard, was obviously
dismayed by the low turnout, and this seemed to affect the
energy of his first set. His "Celtic-inspired mongrel rebel
folk" alternated between upbeat numbers backed by percus-

sionist Dave White and slower ballads — the ballads in par
ticular failing to ignite the disappointingly sedate crowd.
Neil I's music is shaped and informed by his fervent envi
ronmentalist beliefs, so his songs pack more opinions, slo
gans and ideas into a single number than most artists manage
on an entire album. Most of the time this works; propelled by

Neill's musical talent and songwriting, the politics and music
blend comfortably. This is a considerable ability — not every
one can write a song about pollution in the Hudson River or
the plight of the Nez Perce Indians that still sounds catchy.
Occasionally, however, the ideology leaves the music be
hind and Neill comes off sounding like a more extremist John
Denver. This was especially obvious at the beginning of the
show. While a few numbers caught fire, the bulk of the songs
seemed unwieldy, encumbered by their rhetorical weight. Al
though Neill's uncompromising fervor for nature leaves sev
eral of his songs walking the line between idealism and trite
ness, a number of tunes in the first set fell over that line, re

minding the listener of a I'HS "Wild Kingdom" show set to
music. A song dedicated to the grizzly hear called "Hear In
Mind" and featuring the chorus "bear!. . . in! .. . mind!" was
probably the most unfortunate example of this tendency.
fortunately, the first few songs didn't set the tone for the
whole night. After a few songs someone cleared away the first
few rows <>1 chairs, and as a younger, more enthusiastic crowd
trickled in the energy began to change notably. When a song
about the timber wolf near the end of the first set climaxed in
an energetic Neill led "group howl," it was clear that the show
was picking up.
The new arrivals, whose "Save the Headwaters" I shirts,
camouflage jeans and ragged levas and hirkcnstocks suggest
ed roots in "eco warrior" movements like (ireen peace and
Karth first!, were clearly more familiar with Neill's music,
mouthing the words to nearly every song. This was obviously
the singer's crowd: His music is crafted to fire up fellow ac
t ivists, and as the lrowd began to react, he got fired up as well,
his pre song banter and onstage energy growing more fervent
in response to his fans' enthusiasm.
I hings really »t moving after a brief intermission: Neill
opened the second halt of the show with a tune attacking OK

Cola, Coke's failed "Ceneration X" soli drink, and the pi
geonhole market ing st ratcgies t>f'corporate A merit, a. I hen he
turned up the heat. In the space of a few minutes he pro
claimed the need for clean water, attacked the U.S. govern
mcnt's wilderness policy, declared the coming dawn of "a
power defined not by authority hut by integrity and kept

right on going.

tage is a very strong act, and the
black and white facts of the case
might not show the activist in a
very sympathetic light. But in
Neill's hands, turned into symbol
and backed by a stirringi horns, the
incident became an inspiring rebel
hymn, almost compelling the
crowd to sing along.

probably the most unfortunate example of this tendency.
fortunately, the first few songs didn't set the tone for the
whole night. After a few songs someone cleared away the first
few rows <>1 chairs, and as a younger, more enthusiastic crowd
trickled in the energy began to change notably. When a song
about the timber wolf near the end of the first set climaxed in
an energetic Neill led "group howl," it was clear that the show
was picking up.
The new arrivals, whose "Save the Headwaters" I shirts,
camouflage jeans and ragged levas and hirkcnstocks suggest
ed roots in "eco warrior" movements like (ireen peace and
Karth first!, were clearly more familiar with Neill's music,
mouthing the words to nearly every song. This was obviously
the singer's crowd: His music is crafted to fire up fellow ac
t ivists, and as the lrowd began to react, he got fired up as well,
his pre song banter and onstage energy growing more fervent
in response to his fans' enthusiasm.
I hings really »t moving after a brief intermission: Neill
opened the second halt of the show with a tune attacking OK

Cola, Coke's failed "Ceneration X" soli drink, and the pi
geonhole market ing st ratcgies t>f'corporate A merit, a. I hen he
turned up the heat. In the space of a few minutes he pro
claimed the need for clean water, attacked the U.S. govern
mcnt's wilderness policy, declared the coming dawn of "a
power defined not by authority hut by integrity and kept

right on going.
As more ami more <»l the
crowd got up ami liil the dance

Neill's musical approach became
clear. My presenting Ins activist

cal setting, Neill gave ideas that
might be boring 01 ambiguous in
another medium the chame to in
spire without stripping away their
force.
A song 1 ailed "I laming Ar
rows,' .1 tribute to an activist in
prison foi sinking whaling ships, is
a good example. Industrial sabo
tage is a very strong act, and the
black and white facts of the case
might not show the activist in a
very sympathetic light. But in
Neill's hands, turned into symbol
and backed by a stirringi horns, the
incident became an inspiring rebel
hymn, almost compelling the
crowd to sing along.
I fere and at a few other mo
merits, Neill was crafting (.lassie
folk music in the tradition of

Wooily (iuthrie anil tlu- union
songs of the 1930s music to r.illy the faithful, frighten the
enemy and inspire the agnostic. I Hiring the show's climax, a
song called "I )ancing on the Ruins of Multinational (Corpora
tions," nearly everyone in the club was on his or her feet dam
ing and singing along.
Neil I's audience may he small, his message heavy, the cause
he extols a difficult one, but at some moments that didn't
seem to matter. At some points in that Beltane night, it
seemed like idealism, youth, energy and unbridled enthusi
asm really might be enough to make this world the one (lasey
Ncill and his fans dream about. II
