## Erasure "Cowboy" 
### 
I can think of only one music group that
can take the wt>rds "I love you" and express
it a million different ways without skip
ping a beat. Since its explosion in the mid
(SOs with songs like "Who Needs Love I ike
That" and "Oh rAmour," Erasure has
stood at the forefront of British
dance / pop music.
"(lowboy" is the I Oth album for the duo
of vocalist Andy Bell and synthesi/erist
Vince (Clarke. I hey chose the album's odd
title largely because of Clarke's affection
for Western films and their ideology.
Of course, the music 11sell hardly gives
the impression of John Wayne movies or
(dare we say it) country music. The West
ern motif doesn't go much further than the
computer-generated bucking cow ma
chine on the cover. The rest is standard
Erasure: upbeat, moving love songs,
"(lowboy' immediately captures your at
tention with "Rain. Its got a catchy tune
and simple lyrics that'll bring nostalgic joy
to old fans. Another great song is "Reach
Out," even though it has ,i chorus ("Reach
out and touch me") that makes it sound a
little bit like a long AT& I commercial.
The album also includes Erasure's most
recent hit singles. "In My Arms" is one of
the slower songs, but it's got plenty of
power, making numerous poetic refer
ences to the sea. The driving rhvthm of

"Don't Say Your Love is Killing Me" is sup
ported commendably by Tracy Ackerman's
vocals.
The mass-produced "special limited
edition" of "Cowboy" also has a pair of
bonus tracks, "Rapture" and "Magic Mo
ments." Both are excellent songs written by
outsiders.
Neither member of Erasure fails to
please the listener. Bell's voice is soothing

and emotional as usual,
and he is backed up oc
casionally by members
of the London (.omniu
-11 it y Gospel Choir.
Vince Clarke's music is
a mix of his traditional
'KO's techno beat and
the advanced synth in
strumentation that was
introduced in"I Say I
Say I Say."
I he only real prob
lem with "Cowboy" is
its failure to introduce
anything new to Era
sure's style, toward the
end of the album the
songs begin to sound
monotonous. Besides, a
person can only take so
much romance in songs

before the lyrics become cheesy.
Then again, consistency isn't such a bad
thing. The entire British music scene seems
to be shifting toward techno. Groups like
Blur and the Chemical Brothers are build
ing popularity, while U2 and David Bowie
are racing to catch up. Erasure has used the
dance genre from the start, and it's showing
no Mgns of stopping.
