# Buck-O-Nine
## "Twenty-Eight Teeth" 
### 
I think il I hear the word "skacore" one
more time, I II go to the nearest K mart,
buy the biggest automatic weapon I can
find, learn how to use it and go on a ram
page at the I ive 105 studios.
I here has got to be a better way to de
scribe the music of bands like buck O
Nine that combine great horn lines with
punkv ska guitar. Ska-based punk\ pop?
Horny punk? Let's just drop the pretexts
here, combine ska and punk and call it
"skunk."
One ol nn favorite skunk bands has al
ways been San Diego's buck O Nine. With
two excellent full length albums under its
belt ("Songs In Ihe Key Ol bree" and
barfly "), a iumpin' live show and not too
much childish humor, buck O-Nine con
sistently impresses me. I hat's why I was es
pecially excited to get its new album,
"Iwenty l ight Teeth" (out now on I'V'l
Records, its third label in as many albums).
I wasn't disappointed.
The first song, "Round Kid," kicks
things off resoundingly with fast ska guitar
and a walking bass line, leading into a
catchy horn riff just before the sing-along
i horus. On the third song, "Albuquerque,"
an equally memorable tune, lead singer lon
I'ebsworth half-veils the line, "And then

you told me not to smoke it / but I
did / and it took me far away."
The title track begins with a fabulous
staccato brass harmony followed by Peb
sworth crooning, "You ever been so bored
that you start counting all your teeth?"
After a punkish chorus, trumpet player
Anthony Curry lets loose with a short but
groovin' solo.
The best track 011 the album, "Jennifer's
Cold," is a slower and darker song about,
you guessed it, a young girl's cold. The
lyrics, while tongue-in-cheek, end on a
somewhat wistful note: "United Nations
emergency meeting / declares the whole
world is grieving / and peace will come if
Jenny just gets well / please come home
soon."
T he two mediocre tracks on the CD are
"Steve Was Dead" a straight punk thrasher
about a lame practical joke and a version of
loe Jackson's "I'm the Man" with horns.
Neither is particularly impressive.
On the whole, though, this album kicks
ass. If you like Buck-O-Nine's unique
brand of skunk, or if you're tired of Bush
a-likes, you'll love this album.
You might even wonder, like I did, why
Buck-O-Nine included a song about the
commercialization of modern radio sta

lions ("What happened to niv radio? / It
used to be cool; now it just blows") and de
cided to thank 9IX, San Diego's hyper
commercial alterna-rock station on the
same album. Hmmm. . ..
— I'd trick Hn right
