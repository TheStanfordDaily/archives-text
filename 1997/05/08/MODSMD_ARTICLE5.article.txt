### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
More than 70 new freshman sem
inars will he available to the entering
Class of 2001 as part of the Stanford
Introductory Studies initiative.
The seminars offer groups of up to
1(5 students an opportunity to study
closely with Stanford faculty in a va
riety of disciplines.
Faculty involved with implement
ing the seminars expect them to set
t he stage for mentoring relationships

that could extend through all four undergraduate
years.
"We hope that our new students are going to take
advantage of meeting with advisers to determine how
the seminar: are going to fit in their academic pro
gram," said Ellen Woods, assistant dean for under
graduate studies in the School of 11 uinanities and Sci
ences. She added t hat the classes will he open to sopho
mores although freshmen will have preference in reg
istering.
Woods said despite previous plans, the freshman
seminar program will have no impact on the (Cultures,
Ideas and Values Program, the required year-long
course that is current ly undergoing a review.
She was also quick to dismiss another common inis
pe»veption concerning the hiring of new faculty to
U'ach these seminars. "All seminars will he taught hy
exist ing faculty on roster right now," she said.
Departments that offer seminars will be given
extra faculty resources to replace the current faculty
who will teach them.
The University has received funding from the liing
Foundation to support 20 hillets for tenured profes
sors to be allocated among the departments that have


Osheroff
faculty teaching seminars.
This will be the first year of the
three-year planning cycle, during
which the program is expected to
grow to 100 seminars, enabling all
1,600 freshmen to enroll.
Although the seminars will not
lx' mandatory next year, there is a
possibility of integrating them into
the required curriculum in the fu
ture.

The seminar planning is over
seen by the Academic Council Advi
sory Board. "I think the board has
adopted a cautionary approach,"
said Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff,
the board's at-large faculty mem
ber. "We are committed to a small
number of billets and will see how
this works out.
"It is valuable for Stanford stu
dents to get in a dialogue with fac
ulty members as soon as possible.
The big question is whether fresh
men are going to buy into this
idea," he added.
OsherofTs cautious enthusiasm

is shared by his fellow board mem
bers.
"Departments have been won
derfully responsive in coming out
with ideas aboui new courses; it
will give people a lot of new choic
es," said Assoc. Geological and En
vironmental Science Prof.
Jonathan Stebbins.
Materials Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Bravman
called the program "a wonderful
opportunity to get students en
gaged with faculty. Engineers and
premeds might have busy sched
ules, but our goal is to make the

program available for every fresh
man."
Stanford students are also en
thusiastic about the new program
but caution that it should not be
come mandatory.
"Having the seminar program is
good, but I don't think that anoth
er mandatory class would be bene
ficial to freshmen," said freshman
Phil Enan.
"It sounds like a neat idea,"
echoed freshman Suzannah Tiper
mas. "But there are already enough
requirements around here; people
should be allowed to explore."
