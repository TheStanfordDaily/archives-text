# Helmet
## "Aftertaste" 
### 
It's tough to knock a band like Helmet,
one of the few remaining talented, main
stream metal bands. On the other hand,
when you realize that Helmet is about all
the headbangers have left on pop radio,
you can't help but shrug in mild disap
pointment. "Aftertaste" is good, but it
doesn't deliver the punch today that
kicked off metal and won over audiences
in the early 'KOs. This is not the alternative
fringe of Jesus Lizard, nor is it the cock
rock revival of Corrosion of Conformity.
Helmet trailblaz.es its own path in the
post-apocalyptic heavy metal world.
On "Aftertaste," Helmet goes back to
the basics, trimming down the harmonic
fat and sticking to beating the listener over
the head with metal riffs. It fills out its
music with a resonating, slightly distorted
guitar.
Singer / guitarist Page Hamilton isn't
afraid to cut loose and scream here and
there, but he isn't a metal singer. The vo
cals are pretty clean — not much grunting
on this one. There is good cohesion be
tween Hamilton's roll with the music vo
cals and the hydraulic thump of Henry
Bogdano's bass. On the other hand, as a
singer, Hamilton doesn't take control of
the band. Strong rhythm is the backbone
of the album.
Helmet realizes its limitations ii
Hamilton and works through them. O i
the latter halt of "Aftertaste," the instru
mentals rocket the album and most of the
singing is done amid kick-ass drumming
and guitar playing. It works pretty well.
Another problem that plagues the
music is Hamilton's weak lead guitar. His
solos are slow and pretty meaningless,
with the exception of "Driving Nowhere."
Again, Helmet compensates for this by
layering the solos with strong backup gui
tar. There isn't much high pitch lead on the
album at all; it seems that the guitar solos
are only included to add an extra dimen
sion to the music every few songs.
With "Exactly What You Wanted," the
listener finds some of the album's best
crunch. It starts off shaky, with c'mon
you-can-do-better-than-that lyrics like "I
get a 1) for disappointment / Now there's
nothing to regret," but the chorus is pow
erful and drummer John Stantier really
stands out.
"Aftertaste is great for people who
enjoy the new generation of metal but
don't care much for speed or thrash. It has
all the classic riffs and adequate noise,
making it an ample addition to most hard
rock collections. This album should ap
pease Anthrax and Pantera fans while they
wait for the next groundbreaker of the
genre.
