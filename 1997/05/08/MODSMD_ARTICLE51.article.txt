# Leftover Salmon
## "Euphoria" 
### 
The Boulder, Golo.-based band Left
over Salmon has crafted a winner with its
third album, "Euphoria." Back in the stu
dio for the first time since the 1993 release
"Bridges to Bert," Salmon has used the ex
periences of four years of touring to imbue
"Euphoria" with the infectious raw energy
that is utilized so superbly in concert.
Leftover Salmon specializes in a genre
it seems to have created, "polyethnic
Cajun slamgrass." This appellation is as
precise as it is unique; the group combines
rock, blues, speedy bluegrass (a.k.a. slam
grass), folk ballads, Cajun, zydeco, Celtic
and rag into an enthralling, high energy,
fast-pickin' act.
The band isn't hesitant to cover tradi
tional and folk standards (soulful rendi
tions of the classic folk tune "Cash on the
Barrelhead" and the fast-pickin' "Ain't
(ionna Work" are true gems), but the best
work is on originals. The album starts
with the frantic, sensuous rocker "Better,"
sung by frontman Vince Herman
(acoustic guitar / vocals). Herman walks
the line between serious emotion and ca
sual expression with lines like "She took
me to her home / she took off her
sweater/she disconnect the phone/oh,
couldn't be better."
Electric guitar / mandolin/ fiddle / vo
calist Drew Emmitt then slows down the
album with the pop ballad "Highway
Song." Although Emmitt is technically
flawless on all of his instruments, his ten

dency toward slow, poppy ballads ("Baby
Hold On," "Muddy Water Home," " This
Is the rime") drops the energy of the
album rather than provide a balance to the
usual frenzy of sound.
hmmitt proves his worth as a song
writer with the bluesy "River's Rising,"
using harmonies effectively and leaving
space tor a furious jam with Pete Sears of
Jefferson Airplane sitting in on the Ham
mond Organ. The zydeco-based "Mama
Boulet" gives the listener a taste of
Louisiana that seems somewhat mis
placed until Marc Vann's electric banjo
and Emmitt's electric mandolin with steel
drum effects kick in.
The fierce slamgrass "Funky Mountain
Fogdown" is Vann's songwriting contri
bution to the album and includes a guest
appearance by the venerable Sam Bush on
fiddle. It tears through a fast picking ses
sion with authenticity, showing that Vann
is not merely imitating old-style banjo,
but has a mastery of his instrument that
puts him in the same league as his con
temporary, Bela Fleck.
The album finishes on a high note with
the title track, "Euphoria." A happy,
danceable tune that resembles a country
hoe-down, it features Vann's banjo pick
ing, Emmitt's electric slide guitar and
Herman's ludicrous vocals in turn. An apt
finish to an album that is certain to deliv
er on its title.
