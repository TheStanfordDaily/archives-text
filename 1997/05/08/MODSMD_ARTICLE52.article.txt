# Mustard Plug
## "Evildoers Beware!" 
### 
Mustard Plug's first album lea
tured a guy completely (and I mean
completely!) covered with mustard,
grimacing at the camera. I took it as
a clue that the songs might lie some
thing less than powerful social com
mentary. I was right.
The album is great, but songs like
"I Made Love to a Martian" just
don't pack the political punch of
bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind''
or Propagandhi's "Resisting Tyran
nical (jovernmcnt."
Don't get me wrong; I love plen
ty of apolitical bands, and let's face
it, ska-punk, or more concisely,
skunk, is primarily about drinking,
sex and silliness. So I thought I knew
what to expect when I picked up the
Plug's new album, "Evildoers Be
ware!" I was mildly surprised.
This time the boys are more seri
ous. (ioneare silly songs like "Thigh
High Nylons" and "Too Stoopid"
(with its catchy chorus, "I wanna
love you but you're too damn stu

pid"). Instead we find tunes like
"Suburban Homesick blues,'about
being "lost in the suburbs,' "Jerry,"
about the life and death ol the la
mous Mr. (iarcia, and "Dressed
Up," a critical commentary on
America's appearance fetish.
Ihe music is still straight up,
100 percent pure skank material,
with Mustard Plug's signature horn
style (hard to pin down but basical
ly harmonic and catchy). "You

sion and jumps into a memorable
horn line .is guitarist / singer < olin
C Hive croons "You never told me
what was wrong or what was
right / You never told me why you
couldn't sleep at night."
On "Mendo/a," one ol the best
tracks on the album, lead singer
Dave Kirchgessner showcases his
slurred singing style (picture the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky
Barrett after eight or nine beers)
with the lines "She took a rusty

siilriin .nut slit' slaughtered my

he manages to rhyme "I looked
peaked" will) "making me freaked.
Pretty good stuff.
"(>o" and the confusingly named
"Heei (Song) arc straightforward
last ska Willi punk sing along cho
ruses. "Jerry starts kind of slow hut
resolves into what is by fai the I test
horn line on the allium, alternating
with kirchgessner s vocals. I lesings,
"Wli.it were you thinking when you
took .ill these lives in your
hand? / What were you doing, was
your death considered in your
plans?"
While I was surprised at the lack
of juvenile antics on this allium, the
result is no less pleasing. I vildoers
Beware!" proves that Mustard Plug
is starting to come into its own.
Maybe now the hand will he ahle to
deal with its peculiar fixation for the
yellowest of condiments.
