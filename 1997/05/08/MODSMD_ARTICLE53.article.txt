### 
"oh, and the hail" is pretty much impossible to
sing along to. When I think of folk, I think of
songs I can sing along to — or songs I like to think
I can sing along to.
The girl & i's singer Nyree Rabushka can do .111
awful lot with her voice — growl, yodel, wail, hold
.1 note forever. But sometimes she seems to get
overwhelmed with her own variety of skill I very
now and then — well, probably more often than
that — you get an ending syllable th.it becomes
the musical equivalent of hiccuping and snee/ing
at the same time — she'll growl and yodel and
then try to hold the note even after .ill that.

She's got a great a voice and probably needs to
play up its strengths. But sometimes, when she
goes too lar into her upper register, her voice ac
quires an unmistakable whining sound.
The fervor and strength ol Rabushka's voice,
on the one hand, seems slightly out ol place in
"bii'city," with the soil sounds of Mr hael I lalaas'

piano (comparable in skill and expression to
Bruce Hornsby). On the other hand, coupled
with the intense guitar chords of "morn & dad,"
its passion is fitting.
One-man orchestra I lalaas, who not only
plays piano hut also guitar, bass and drums and
usually doesn't sing, oilers up some vocals on the
duo's second album. On "oh sailor" he does the
primary vocals while Rahushka sings backup,
and they harmoni/e nicely together
The lyrics are nothing too unusual, with plen
ty ot metaphors tor discovering insecurities and
finding strength to be your own person. Ihe
album's also lull ol mournful phrases like "I see
your face in every place I go, and I don't know
how to handle if (front "big city"). Hut who
needs words anyway? " Ritual" doesn't have a sin
gle intelligible word in it and soothes with its
primitive sound. Kabushka sings over a chorus ot
her own voices, and I lalaas accompanies on gin
tar, bass and drums.
I lie last track, "quiet," is the best piece .mil
also features vocals by I lalaas. I 'nlike the other
tracks, it was completely improvised. Singing
with I lalaas' timid voice lories Kabushka to
tone down a little, making her more dramatic
notes sound ecstatic over the soil piano
mclod y.
"oh, and the hail does rellect some changes
the girl & I has made since then liist release, last
year's "I leaK hemistryt •ravity." I ach tr.uk has a
fuller sound, sometimes less acoustic, and the
album overall possesses a little more variety.
The Stanford based band will be returning to
the farm lor a release show at Kicker I )ining I lall
to promote its new tunes.
