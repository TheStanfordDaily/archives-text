## Hollow Reed 
### 
The margiri between "Hollow Reed" and your ordinary
I'V-movie-of-the-week is slim hut fortunately distinct.
Nine-year-old Oliver Wyatt (a touching Sam Bould) has
been turning up with mysteriously inflicted injuries, much
to the bafflement of his divorced parents, Hannah (Joely
Richardson) and Martyn (Martin Donovan). Martyn sus
pects the worst: that Frank I)onally (Jason Flemyng) Han
nah's new boyfriend, has been abusing (Oliver, and thus he
decides to push tor custody of his son.
The saving grace of the plot is this: Upon his divorce
from Hannah, Martyn revealed that he was gay— and ap
parently was aware of his homosexuality throughout his
marriage. The conception of Oliver w.is a last effort on the
couple's part to stay together. Now Hannah must choose
between her son s welfare and her lover; Martyn's dilemma
is whether he is willing to sacrifice his present relationship
with a younger man, Tom (lan I lart, "Nothing Personal"),
to appear respectable in the eyes of the law.
It also doesn't hurt that this story t.ikes place among
British yuppies in the greenly picturesque city of Hath or
that the actors portray the characters as neither wholly
saint nor sinner. Donovan's Martyn never steps out of his
reserved nature, even in the face of maddening circum
stances. As Hannah, Richardson makes her behavior un
derstandable if not acceptable through her fear of another
failed relationship. The most striking performance comes
from Flemyng as a man who never grew up, who maintains

the mentality of a bully on a school playground and whose
face is as likely to crumple with tears as it is with rage.
Not surprisingly, the subject of Martyns homosexuality
is glossed over. Martyn and Tom's relationship is relatively
shallow; their closeness is mainly established by their

singing off-key together
in the car. The court is
immediately presumed
to be of the lowest toler
ance, down to the arche
typal, bigoted lawyer.
More interesting are the
dynamics among Han
nah, Martvn and Frank
— such as Hannah's sus
tained bitterness over
Martyn's secret or
Frank's impossible yet
natural wish for Oliver
to like him as a father
figure.
While director An
gela Hope ("Captives")
allows the adults to blus
ter about on the stage,
she chooses to tell most
of the storv from Oliver's

viewpoint. Through the eyes of a abused child, the entan
glement of adult relationships is clearly revealed, and this
is what ultimately makes "Hollow Reed a family drama of
above-average caliber.
