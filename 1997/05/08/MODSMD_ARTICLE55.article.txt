# A
						Mongolian Tale

### 
Once upon a time in a backward land, there was an old woman who lived with an or
phan girl she raised. One day, a man came to her with his son, Pup, because his wife had
just died. The woman took the boy in and called him Bayinbulag, for what kind of a name
is Pup?
I hese are the humble beginnings of "A Mongolian Tale," (Chinese director Xie Fei's latest film.
Set in Mongolia's barren grasslands and spoken in Mongolian, it brings us back to a time and place
as far away from modern America as the woman in the film is distanced from her neighbors.

In the style of his fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers (who graduated from film school
after the Cultural Revolution), Fei employs the popular but yet inexhaustible combination
of historically repressed characters and raw human emotion to invoke drama.
The characters are Grandma (Dalarsurong), orphan girl Somiya (Narenhuar) and boy
Bayinbulag (Tengger), who eke out an uneventful but content existence on their sheep
farm. Peace is disturbed when Bayinbulag's father sends him to the city for schooling a few
years later, leaving Grandma and Somiya pining for his return. But before he leaves,

Grandma proposes that he and Somiya
marry when he gets back so that they can all
live together again.
Bayinbulag doesn't take the engagement
well at first, but when he returns three years
later he can't wait to get married. However,
all is not as he left it — Somiya is pregnant
with someone else's child.
Based on Zhang Cheng Zhi's novel "Black
Steed," the film is touching but feels too
much like it was adapted from a book. It cov
ers 30 years by awkwardly jumping forward
in time, using three different actors for both
the roles of Somiya and Bayinbulag. The old
est actors are the most sympathetic charac
ters, but by the time they take over, the film
is half over.
Despite this and the occasionally badlv
timed subtitle — sadly, no fault of Fei's — "A
Mongolian Tale ' is still an absorbing movie
withentrancing music. It won awards for
both directing and music, which is actually
sung by Tengger, at the Montreal World Film
Festival.
Not a bad ending to a tale, eh?
