# Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery
## 
### 
Now that the Cold War is over, espionage thrillers with
secret agents a la 007 have gone the way of groovy '60s sen
sibilities. All we can do now is lampoon the old-school spy
movie genre as the parody-in-waiting it always was.
And while we're at it, why not pick on the entire decade
of the '60s for its optimistic decadence and blatant campi
ness?
The premise of this movie: discovering that his archvillain
is cryogenically freezing himself so as to reawaken 30 years
later and conquer the world, a very happening secret agent
with bad teeth also freezes himself in 1967 London with the
intention of awakening in 1997. In doing so, said hero will
parody everything sacred about '60s spy movies while si
multaneously commenting on the sad state of affairs in the
present decade.
It's an idea so crazy that it just might work.
And Austin Powers most definitely works it. Bedecked in
crushed velvet blazers and groovy flares, Powers is every
thing the iconic James Bond was too self-conscious to be. In
fact, there is nothing suave about Powers' lascivious ex
ploitation of'6os free love, especially in the decade of safe
sex. We have to debate whether to wince or giggle as he
"swings" from disdainful woman to woman with cries of

"Yeah, bay-bee\ n
And yet Austin Powers is a lovable hero whether you con
sider him to be a goofy spoof of spy icons or a swinging
super-sleuth in his own right. The movie is the same way.
On the one hand, it's a slightly self-conscious send-off of
the '60s spy-movie cliche, lames Bond fans will have no
trouble noticing the many 007-references, especially the vil
lain Dr. Evil (played by Mike Meyers in a dual role) who
longs to be Ernst Blofeld. But since it's debatable that the
Bond movies took themselves — or were taken — serious
ly, "Austin Powers" also attempts to work on the level of
ridiculous comedy.
Either way, it's a pretty successful effort, due in part to
Mike Meyers' hilarious script (and barely there plot, hope
fully in homage to the barely there plots of the movies he's
spoofing) and in part to some purely silly acting, particular
ly that of Meyers and his Bond-babe-in-training, played by
Elizabeth Hurley.
All in all, Powers manages to be a hero ot the '60s who's a
hero for the '90s because in the end, all that counts in both
decades is saving the day and getting the girl. Leaving us all
saying yeah, bay-bec.
