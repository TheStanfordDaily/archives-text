# Breakdown
## 
### 
I'm supposed to drive cross-country with friends to return
home at the end of this quarter. 1 am now seriously consider
ing not doing it. It's all the fault of "Breakdown."
left"(Kurt Russell) and Amy (Kathleen Quinlan), a married
couple from Massachusetts driving to (California, have a break
down in the desert. A trucker pulls up to help, and Amy decides
to go with him to the next town to call a tow truck. (What good
is their yuppie cell phone when its out ot range?) It doesn t take
kit too long to realize that his wife has been kidnapped. It does,
however, take some time for him to catch on to the tact that you
shouldn't trust strangers in the desert.
I rom this point 011 the movie is an adrenaline rush as Jeff
pursues the bad guys by trying to outwit them, outrun them
and outgun them.
"Breakdown" absolutely terrified me, almost to the point
of tears. Usually I'm not such a wuss about movies, but it's
been a while since a movie could maintain such constant lev
els of nail-biting, probably not since "The fugitive." I don't
want to put the two movies in the same class because Ihe
112 ugitive" was far more complex plot-wise and character-wise,

but in terms of nerve-rattling per buck, "Breakdown" mea
sures up.
This movie doesn't tall into the trap of similar flicks such as
"Ransom," which made a really big deal out of the ransomed

kill's condition. I his movie's gimmick is to keep the audience
.is clueless .is |eff is about Amy, whether she's dead or alive, so
that we don't know whether his efforts are all foi nothing.
Another one of the movie's triiks is that it preys on normal
fears. Without mercy, it exploits the worst t-ase scenario of a
common occurrence a breakdown in the desert to its
fullest. It also has an atmosphere reminiscent of""I he Iwilight
Zone," especially in the beginning when it seems like Jelt is the
only normal person around, and even a cop doesn t believe
him.
Usually I don't like Russell much, but this is definitely one of
his stronger performances. I le manages to look convincingly
distraught throughout the entire movie. (Juinlan, well, shes
fine as the helpless female. She's hardly in the movie so she
doesn't really have time to be anything else.
This flick almost seems like a silent movie except lor the fact
that it makes up for dialogue with loud sound effects. I his is
definitely a movie that needs to be seen in a theater with I )olby
sound because it would be kind of lame on video.
