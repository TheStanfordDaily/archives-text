German director Wim Wonders is
known in Europe for winning awards
at (Cannes and serving on the boards of
film academies. But in America, lie's
known tor so few and such varied films
that it's difficult to characterize his
work. The following lour films are

probably the only ones that you'll be
able to find in video stores, but they are
well worth looking into.
"Paris, Texas'' (1484), a collabora
tion between Wenders and screen
writer Sam Shepard, is quite different
from his other works. The film opens
with an amnesiac man getting picket!
up in the middle of the desert, lie's
Travis ("arson (Harry Dean Stanton),
who is looking for the son and wife he

O
abandoned tour years before. I lis sun,
1 lunter, turns out to be living with Travis'
brother and his wile in California. Once fa
ther and son are reunited, they begin the
search lor the I lunter's mother, lane (Nastass
ja Kinski). I he disenchantment of Travis and
lane s relationship poignantly evokes that of
Travis' parents, who met not in the city-of
lights Paris, but Paris, Texas. I his Paris, which
we actually never get to see other than in a
snapshot, embodies the film's wistful longing
for the past.
In addition to pro\ idingthe title for a song
by U2, the film "Until the I nd ol the World"
(1991) is a peculiar blend of science fiction
and surrealism set on the brink of the apoca
lypse. William I lurt plays Sam I arber, a man
mysteriously being followed no matter where
he goes in the world. In places ranging from
Beijing to Paris, he constantly runs into C ,la ire
(Solveiu 1 )ommartin), also runnini> from the

law. Joined byClaire'sex, Eugene (Sam Neill),
the three retreat to Australia, where Sam's in
ventor father (Max von Sydow) is perfecting a
device that will record dreams and allow his
blind mother (Jeanne Moreau) to witness
what other people see. While this film con
tains intriguing ideas and settings, as well as a

blend of languages and genres, it is less than
the sum of its parts.
"Wings of Desire" (1987) and its sequel,
"larawav, So Close!" (1993), are probably
Wenders' best-known films and deservedly so.
The screenplay, written in collaboration with
Peter I lankc, is intense and lyrical, and if you
ever thought Cierman was a harsh-sounding
language, it sounds like pure poetry here.
In the plainest terms, the films are about
angels and their endeavor to become human.

But these aren't the kind of guardian angels
you've seen in movies like "Michael ' or "The
Preacher's Wife." These pony-tailed, trench
coat wearing angels (spiritually inspired by
Kilke's poetry) look more like gangsters than
seraphim. Although invisible to humans,
they can hear people's thoughts regardless of
the language being spoken — and people in
this film speak Herman, I nglish, I rench,
Japanese. Despite this power, the emptiness
of the angels' immortal existence is empha
si/ed by the fact that the scenes are mostly in
black and white until one of them becomes
human.
"Wings of Desire'' concerns two angels in
particular, Damiel (Bruno(ian/) and Cassiel
(Otto Sander) in the bleak, wintery Berlin of
the days before the Wall came down. We fol
low them from room to room in a squalid
apartment complex, to the city library, to the
streets where they listen to thoughts of people

passing by in cars (which, incidentally, in
spired the video for R.F.M.s "Everybody
Hurts"). Peter Falk turns up playing himself,
.111 ex-angel who "made the plunge," so to

speak, to become
television's
" C o I u m bo."
Here, Falk is in
Berlin to play the
detective in a
movie set during
World War 11,
providing a sub
tle commentary
on the represen
tation of history.
If this film has
a plot at .ill, it is
centered around
I )amiel and how
he falls in love
ostensibly with .1
French trapeze
artist named
Marion (played
by Dommartin)
Inii really with
life itself. I )amiel
makes every
simple action we
take for granted
important, and

there is no hotter actor to convey this than
Ganz, whose gentle, kindly face mixes the
lines of a middle-aged man with the genuine
wide-eyedness of a child.
"Faraway, So Close!" chronicles the adven
tures of 1 )amiel's sidekick, C .assiel, in his quest
to become human. The legacy ot World War
II in Berlin is emphasized here as Cassiel he
comes entangled in the problems ol a family
being blackmailed for war crimes. I he at
tempt of this film to have an overt plot and ac

tion sequences works against it, though. The
best part about "Faraway, So Close!" are the
cameos by Mikhail Gorbachev and Lou Reed
— playing, ot course, themselves. Nastassja

Kinski also shows up as the angel Raphaela,
(lassiel's new companion.
"Wings of Desire and "Faraway, So
C lose!" should he seen back-to-back (and are
sometimes shown this way in revival houses)
to get the full effect of YVenders' vision. His
dedication at the end of "Wings ot Desire"
"to all former angels" — reflects a steadfast
belief in the human spirit that is evident in the
four films mentioned here.
