"You arc not an artist, Jeremy."
I learned that life lesson in Miss
1 lotmeister's sixth-grade art
class. I spent weeks on that damned still
lite, carefully reproducing that crummy
\ ase onto my crisp white paper canvas with
utmost care. 1 still consider it my greatest
colored-pencil drawing to date, hut Miss
llolmeister told me that I couldn't draw,
. ave me a Band instead hung Adam Gib
bons' stupid picture in the glass frame in
the hallway of Heim Middle School.
l .rgo, I'm not an artist.
Now wouldn't it make a great story if I
told you that I overcame my lack of talent
and Miss Hofmeister's glowing comments
ti become the greatest colored-pencil

sketch artist this side of the Rio Grande?
Wouldn't that be a happy ending to an oth
erwise depressing anecdote?
Well, unfortunately, that's not the case.
The surface scars may
have healed, but I don't think I've picked up
a pencil, crayon or paint
brush in the past ten years under some no
tion that I could create a piece of "art."
So I guess Miss Hofmeister was right in a
self-fulfilling-prophecy / if-you-crush
him-he-will-crumble type of way. 1 am no
artist.
"You are not a writer, Jeremy."
1 learned that in Rich Holton's Freshman
English class. He told me that he didn't like
my style, and if 1 didn't conform to his writ

ing style that I would never amount to
much of a writer. Sure, 1 wasn't very good at
writing the politically correct mumbo
jumbo they expect us to bullshit in Fresh
man English, but I'm not a writer? He told
mc 1 couldn't write, gave me a Band proba
bly hung a "good paper" in a glass frame
outside his door.
Ergo, I'm not a writer?
Bad criticism is an inherent part of the
life of an artist, and
one which must be taken at face value.
There are a million Miss
Hofmeisters in the world, and each one has
the capability of taking an energetic artist
and turning him or her into a quivering
mass of psychological problems. And there

are a million Freshman English professors
out there who are too quick to tell you
what's had before they tell you what's good.
And we all need to learn to overcome those
too quick to judge.
Rich llolton may disagree, hut 1 think
I'm a writer. F.ach week 1 pick up my crisp
white paper canvas and write a column for
The Daily. I even dabble in playwriting
and composing. These endeavors may not
be still lile, and Miss Hofmeister still
might not post them in the glass case in the
hallway, but I'd like to think there is an
artist in me somewhere that isn't afraid to
try.
Kven if 1 still am frightened of those col
ored pencils.
