11 n happy with the structure of CIV? Tired of t lie
same long lines in the dining hall?
Applications to become a student representative
on any of 50 University committees ranging from
the (Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment to the committee on Housing and Dining
are due tomorrow.
"Serving on a committee allows students to get
their voices heard," said ASS IJ Nominations Com
missioner Lisa Lino, a junior.
"The University does care about what students
think. All ( he decisions I hat are made affect the life
of the student," she added.
liiao said she printed up .'lOO applications and is
already running out.
"It is a big responsibility, hut it is an avenue that
students have to participate on the University
level," she said.
Sophomore Eric Friedman, a member of the
(Committee on I lousing and Dining and an ex officio
member of the Committee on Residential Pro
grams, said University committees are an excellent
way for students to get involved.
"Committees are the way to
make an impact," he said. "Stu
dents have a very unique perspec
tive. It is important that the com
mittees have some kind of student
input."
Interested students must fill
out a detailed application de
scribing their experience for the
committee they are interested in
serving on. After an initial selec
tion round, selected applicants
are interviewed by the Nomina
tions Commission. Final nomi
nees must be approved by the
ASSU Senate and University

President's Office.
"There is no set formula that
we use to decide," she said. "It is
pretty amazing the types of appli
cants that we get."
Students who serve on a com
mittee must be willing to make a
substantial commitment, accord
ing to Liao.
"Sometimes students don't re
alize how important it is for them
to be committed," she said. "It is
detrimental to the mission of the
committee when they don't par
ticipate."
Selected applicants must at
tend all meetings of the commit
tee, participate in discussions
and represent student interests.
Representatives must also sub
mit summaries of the meetings to
the ASSU president.
