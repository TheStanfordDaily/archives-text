Dodging rusty clunkers or sleek 10-
speeds is a Stanford ritual. (lot ready to
dodge the faster, more powerful electric
bicycles that are Ixjcorning popular.
The electric bike is a new addition to
the range of possibilities for transporta
tion available today, said Stanford Bicycle
Program Manager John Ciccarelli
"Stanford commuters should look to the
electric bike as an option," he said.
The niche that the electric bike fills
comes between the moped and the bicycle.
Ciccarelli referred to the electric bike as a
"clean moped" that is convenient and en

vironmentally sound.
Secure bike parking facilities to Ik: im

cilities Plan will make commuting with
t he electric bicycle even more feasible, Ci
ccarelli said.
An electric bicycle is defined in Section
406 of the Vehicle Code (Chapter 804,
Statutes of KM). 1 }) a.s a motorized bicycle
incapable of speefls in excess of 20 mph
that has fully operative pedals for propul
sion by human power and an electric
motor.
