# Whitney proposes housing changes

### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
Housing and Dining Ser
vices will implement a combi
nation of three new policies
next year to accommodate an
additional 45 guaranteed stu
dents in undergraduate hous
ing, according to Director of
OHousing Services Rodger
Whitney.
The first solution will re
duce the number of spaces
given to students with no
guaranteed years left. The
University currently gives
students four years of guaran
teed housing. This policy will
mainly affect fifth-year se
niors and coterminal students
who currently receive on-cam
pus housing through the
Draw.
As part of the second policy
change, the Office of Residen

tial Education will "limit the
number of fifth-year exempt
guaranteed spaces in housing
to specific, exceptional cases
of paid staff positions where
there is a programmatic need
for experienced students,"
Whitney said. These include
resident assistant, resident
computer coordinator and
theme associate positions.
"Unless there is a really sig
nificant case, it will be unlike
ly" that any student with un
guaranteed housing will be
asked to fill a non-paid staff
position such as student man
ager, Whitney said.
The final policy to create
additional housing space will
reduce the number of gradu
ate student spots allocated to
co-op houses by 10. There are
currently 35 spaces set aside
for this purpose, Whitney said.
However, this number has often
exceeded the demand that grad
uate students have for space in
co-op housing.
"We're actually just getting
that demand closer to what is ac

tually expressed by the graduate
students anyway," Whitney said.
Whitney is confident that
these three solutions will solve
the housing crunch. "We feel
that the accommodations with
these three things will gain the
minimum 45 spaces needed for
the next year and future years."
As a last resort, "graduate
spaces will be used only if neces
sary," Whitney said. If that

should happen, Crothers Hall or
Crothers Memorial Hall will be
converted to undergraduate use
for that one year, he added.
"But that's not anticipated at
all," Whitney said.
Senior Thomas Willeke repre
sented co-op houses in a series of
meetings with housing services
staff.
"We had in fact come up with
the number of 10, that each house

would give up one or two spots,"
Willeke said. "I am pleased to see
that we came to a reasonable con
clusion and it was stuck to."
"As a fifth-year person," he
added, "I don't love that policy,
but I understand the cuts have
to come from somewhere."
Willeke, however, said he be
lieved that the problems could
only be solved by constructing
more undergraduate housing.
