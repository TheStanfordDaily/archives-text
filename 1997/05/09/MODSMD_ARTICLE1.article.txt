# Whitney proposes housing changes
## 
### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
Housing and Dining Ser
vices will implement a combi
nation of three new policies
next year to accommodate an
additional 45 guaranteed stu
dents in undergraduate hous
ing, according to Director of
OHousing Services Rodger
Whitney.
The first solution will re
duce the number of spaces
given to students with no
guaranteed years left. The
University currently gives
students four years of guaran
teed housing. This policy will
mainly affect fifth-year se
niors and coterminal students
who currently receive on-cam
pus housing through the
Draw.
As part of the second policy
change, the Office of Residen

tial Education will "limit the
number of fifth-year exempt
guaranteed spaces in housing
to specific, exceptional cases
of paid staff positions where
there is a programmatic need
for experienced students,"
Whitney said. These include
resident assistant, resident
computer coordinator and
theme associate positions.
"Unless there is a really sig
nificant case, it will be unlike
ly" that any student with un
guaranteed housing will be
asked to fill a non-paid staff
position such as student man
ager, Whitney said.
The final policy to create
additional housing space will
reduce the number of gradu
ate student spots allocated to
co-op houses by 10. There are
currently 35 spaces set aside
