KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) -
President Mobutu Sese Seko
abandoned plans to run for re
election and called on his mili
tary yesterday to prepare Zaire
for a vote. Still, he clung to his
presidency and angrily rejected
suggestions he was would not
return to Zaire.
Mobutu made the pledge in a
otntpment he and five other
iaders issued from
g Gabon.
1 diplomats, mean
while, pushed for a peace settle
ment between Mobutu and rebel
leader Laurent Kabila, with
some expressing doubts that the
ailing Zairian dictator would
ever return to Zaire as he has
promised.
"The next few days are criti
cal for peace in Zaire," U.S.

envoy Bill Richardson said in
Paris. He briefed French diplo
mats after his nine-day shuttle
diplomacy, which included sev
eral meetings with Kabila and
Mobutu,
Richardson, the U.S. ambas
sador to the United Nations,
refused to say whether Mobutu
would go into exile, though he all
but acknowledged the dictator's
nearly 32-year reign was coming
to an end.
"The ultimate solution will
involve a transitional govern
ment — there's going to be a
change in Zaire," Richardson
said.
In a statement, the leaders of
five regional Zairian allies called
on the Zairian Armed Forces to
prepare for elections and said
Mobutu was too ill to contest the

vote. Mobutu signed the state
ment, along with the presidents
of Gabon, Congo, Equatorial
Guinea, Central African Repub
lic, Chad and the foreign minis
ter of Cameroon.
The document, read aloud at
a news conference, made no
mention of Mobutu resigning or
giving power to a transitional
authority that would include
Kabila, as the rebel chief has
demanded.
When Mobutu was asked if he
intended to return to Kinshasa
this weekend, he replied angrily,
"Why not?"
Zaire's information minister,
Kin-Kiey Mulumba, dismissed
speculation that Mobutu had
used the sudden trip to Gabon to
go into exile. He threatened to
expel foreign media who had

suggested as much.
South African government
spokesman Parks Mankahlana
also said claims Mobutu would
not return to Kinshasa had heen
"largely exaggerated."
But Western diplomats and
military observers said some
high-ranking Zairian military
officers close to Mobutu had
already left the country or sent
their families out, apparently
fearing Mobutu's imminent fall.
Meanwhile, in the city of
Kenge, about 115 miles east of
the capital, aid agencies reported
Wednesday that 300 people may
have been killed in fighting
there. There was no indepen
dent verification of the claim.
The Red Cross said 10 of its local
workers in Kenge were among
the dead.
