WEST HELENA, Ark. (AP) -
An explosion rocked a chemical
packaging plant near the Mississip
pi River yesterday and three fire
fighters were killed while battling a
pesticide-fueled blaze that fol
lowed.
Sixteen people were injured in
the explosion at BPS Inc., state
police spokesman Wayne Jordan
said. The area of the explosion was
inaccessible hours after the fire
and Jordan said the number of
casualties could rise.
"We saw white smoke, heard an
explosion that sounded like a
sound boom, when an airplane
breaks the barrier, and then we
saw a lot of fire," said Vickie Bold
en, who works at Helena Chemical

a quarter-mile from BPS.
"The flames were so high — 150
feet, then the smoke turned black,
and it was dark from then," she
said. "The fumes would burn your
nose, it smelled bad, like ammonia,
where it would take your breath."
The chemicals involved were
azinphosmethyl, methyomyl and
thiophante, all considered poi
sonous, according to Becky Allison,
a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Pollution Control
and Ecology.
Smoke billowed above the plant,
forced the evacuation of a hospital
about a mile away and drifted
southeast across the river into Mis
sissippi 60 miles south of Memphis,
Tenn.

The Helena Regional Medical
Center was evacuated. Some of its
44 patients and 150 employees
were taken to a community college
campus in town and others were
heading to a hospital in Clarksdale,
Miss., a half-hour away.
Hospital spokeswoman Jan
Chambers said the explosion was
felt throughout her building.
"It was like a thunderbolt that
landed outside the building," she
said. "It smells pitiful. It's a strong
odor. Very strong."
The industrial park where the
plant is located also was evacuated
and others in Helena and West
Helena, with populations totaling
about 18,000, were told to stay
inside and shut their windows and

doors.
"We haven't left our building.
They've told everyone basically to
get inside," Nota Johnson of the
Helena Chamber of Commerce
said.
The Lady Luck and Country
casinos across the river in Lula,
Miss., considered .shutting their
doors but decided to stay open.
Winds carried the worst of the
fumes south of the casino complex.
Azinphosmethyl is an insecti
cide that is more toxic to insects
than it is to humans and thio
phante is a fungicide used to con
trol parasitic worms in animals,
said Donald R. Bobbitt, a professor
of chemistry at University of
Arkansas in Fayetteville.
