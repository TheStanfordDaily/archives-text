GOP returns foreign funds
WASHINGTON (AP) — Afler months of railing
against Democrats for taking foreign money, the
Republican Party returned overseas contributions
of its own — $122,400 that a Hong Kong company
funneled through a Florida subsidiary.
In announcing the decision yesterday, Republi
can National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
said party fund-raisers believed the donations in
1991, 1992 and 1993 were from an independent
U.S. company until news stories raised questions
about Young Brothers Development USA. Attor
neys then confirmed that the money donated came
from abroad, he said.
Nicholson stressed that the amount paled in
comparison to the $3 million in tainted contribu
tions the Democratic National Committee has
pledged to return.
Still, Democrats were quick to crow over the
turnabout.
"For months, the Republican Party has attacked
the DNC while it concealed its own receipt of for
eign money," Democratic co-chairman Roy Romer
said. "It is clearer now than ever before that Repub
lican fund-raising efforts targeted foreign money."
The refunded money included $10,000 from
Young Brothers routed to the Republicans' Senate
campaign division, which has capitalized on the
Democrats' woes with a fund-raising letter declar
ing the Clinton White House was "sold for illegal
foreign cash" from "Red China."
The GOP's House fund-raising committee also
said it would return $10,000. House committee

spokesman Rich Galen said Thursday the contribu
tion would be investigated in"due time" but later
boasted that his committee was returning the ques
tionable money "instantly, unlike the Democrats."
Witness: McVeigh rented truck
DENVER (AP) — Just days before the Okla
homa City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was driving
the same kind of yellow Ryder rental truck used in
the blast, a witness testified yesterday.
"He was backing up a Ryder truck next to our
pool," said Eric McGown, a desk worker at the
Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kan.
He recalled telling McVeigh to move the truck
because it was blocking the door of a "grouchy"
guest. McVeigh agreed.
Prosecutors say McVeigh, using an alias, rented
the truck from a Junction City body shop on April
17, 1995.
McGown was the first witness to say he saw
McVeigh in the same kind of rental truck that
authorities claim carried the bomb that exploded
outside the downtown Oklahoma City federal build
ing on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people.
Earlier yesterday, prosecutors showed the jury a
letter that they say McVeigh wrote two months
before the bombing saying, "My whole mind-set has
shifted from intel'.octual to animal."
In the rambling, handwritten letter, there is also
an apparent expression of McVeigh's new, violent
philosophy, which he summed up as: "Rip the bas
tards' heads off... I'll show you how with a simple
pocket knife."
