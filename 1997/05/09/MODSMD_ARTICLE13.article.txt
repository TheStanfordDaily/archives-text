# House gets tough on juvenile crime
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Alarmed by the "brutality and
viciousness" of juvenile crime, the
House overwhelmingly passed a
get-tough bill yesterday ordering
adult trials for violent Americans
barely into their teens.
The bill, if enacted, would bring
about a sweeping change in federal
handling of juvenile crime, ending
the notion that violent offenders of
15, 14 or even 13 should be treated
as youngsters and their offenses
considered childhood misdeeds.
The vote was 286-132, with 77
Democrats joining 209 Republi
cans in supporting the crackdown.
Voting against it were 122
Democrats, nine Republicans and
one independent.
Americans are "shocked by the
brutality and viciousness of crimes
that are being committed by 13-
and 14- and 15-year-olds, and
they're equally shocked when they
see a system that treats these juve
niles as something less than the
predators they seem to be," said
Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.
Both the Clinton administra
tion and the Republican-led
Congress wanted to impose severe
treatment on some juvenile offend
ers. But the administration did not
support this measure, largely
because it did not include money
for crime prevention and did. not
require that child safety locks be
provided with firearm purchases.
The issue now goes to the Sen
ate, where the Judiciary Commit
tee is preparing to work on a bill by
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
that also envisions more adult tri
als of juvenile offenders.
The House bill concerns federal
crimes. But it also tries to persuade
states to transform their own juve
nile justice systems by offering
$ 1.5 billion in incentive grants over
three years.
To be eligible for the money,
states would have to, among other

things, try 15-year-olds as adults
lor serious violent crimes, require
that open criminal records be
established for minors after a sec
ond offense and ensure there are
escalating penalties for every juve
nile crime.
"The essence of what we're
doing today is to try to fix a juve
nile justice system so the very bad
are removed from society l>ecause
they commit the most heinous of
crimes that we have here," said
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., the
bill's chief author.
Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., said
that jus mayor of Charlotte, N.C., "I
attended more funerals of 13-, 14-
and 15-year-old children than I
care to remember. Senseless mur
ders. And young people who did
these things that I would talk to
afterwards had absolutely no
remorse for their actions. This bill
helps our system deal with these
problems."
Even many Democrats who crit
icized the legislation because it
contained no money for prevention
or intervention efforts supported
the hill. Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-
N.C., said: "I'm all for locking up
violent criminals."
Under the bill, adult trials of
youths as young as 14 would
become routine for federal crimes
LtvJjj/iisj/g, DJind/w:, i-npt., nggiuiit*
ed assault, armed robbery and
mqjor drug offenses â€” and con
spiracy to commit those crimes. To
keep such a case in juvenile court,
the attorney general would have to
certify that public safety interests
would be l>est served by doing so.
Thirteen-year-olds could also be
transferred to adult federal court if
the attorney general approved the
move.
The administration had sought
legislation to clear away legal road
blocks to trying juveniles as adults,
hut it wanted more flexibility in
letting prosecutors decide.
