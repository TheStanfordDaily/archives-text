## 'Seinfeld' in limbo 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Jerry and
the gang at "Seinfeld" are living a
real-life suspense story about
whether the popular comedy will
come to an abrupt end.
NBC is to announce its sched
ule for next fall's television season
on Monday and because of a con
tract fight with the show's three
supporting cast members, the net
work doesn't know if "Seinfeld"
will return.
Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-
Dreyfus and Michael Richards are
each demanding $1 million per
episode from NBC to film 2'Z half
hour installments of the show,
ranked behind only "ER" as the
most-watched series this year.
NBC wasn't saying anything
yesterday about the clifilianger,
which is being watched not just by
anxious fans, but by an industry
worried about the precedent a
huge contract would set.
The three actors are united in
an all-for-one, one-for-all negotia
tion. Seinfeld has a separate and
more lucrative deal to return for a

ninth season, but is anxious to see
his friends in the fold.
If they don't get the money, the
three stars have also talked about
getting a piece of the show's own
ership from Castle Rock Enter
tainment, the show's production
company. This would enable them
to get some of the lucrative syndi
cation fees the show commands.
Alexander, who plays George,
told The Washington Post Thurs
day he believed NBC didn't think
the actors were serious.
"'Seinfeld' changed our lives,
changed our careers," he said. "If
it's over tomorrow, fine. But our
efforts have made some people
very, very wealthy. We're not in
that league. We don't jkhh! to have
parity, but we need participation."
Richards, in an interview with
the online magazine Mr. Showbiz,
voiced similar frustrations.
"I'm not on the syndication
side," he said. "I don't have any
thing, and while I've invested eight
years of my time, everyone has got
ten enormously wealthy."
