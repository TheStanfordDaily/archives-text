Before reaching for a
board spot, ASSU must
focus on committees

THERE WERE THREE refer
enda on last month's ASSU
ballot, all meant to bring to
the fore questions about what voice
students should have on the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees. Then-
ASSU President Bill Shen and Vice
President Nick Thompson wanted
to ensure students have an appro
priate voice in the board's policy
making process.
But before going straight to
requesting student members of the
Board of Trustees — an action that
has been met with suspicion from
the trustees and that promises,
regardless of the ultimate outcome,
to take a good deal of time — the
ASSU should work to make better
use of an important policy-making
influence it already has: seats on a
range of University committees.
The Nominations Commission is
the body currently charged by the
ASSU with the task of placing stu
dents on some 50 committees,
including the seven standing com
mittees of the Board of Trustees.
Students' applications for commit
tee assignments are reviewed by the
commission, which then selects
individuals to serve on these com
mittees. The ASSU Senate confirms
the nominations from the non-polit
ical commission — usually without
concern for the nominees' personal
philosophy toward the issues to be
faced by the committee on which
they will be serving.
The non-political nature of the
Nominations Commission is
designed to ensure that neither sen
ators nor the president may apply
pressure for their friends and sup
porters to get plum committee
assignments. And while the com
mission's independence does serve
to protect against cronyism, it also
ensures that those appointed to

committees have no accountability
to the student body as a whole —
not even to the senate, comprised of
students' elected representatives.
In short, the nominations pro
cess should be made more account
able to the political leaders of the
ASSU and thus to the students
those leaders represent.
That is not to say that committee
positions should be doled out
through elections — doing that
would add countless questions to a
ballot already so overloaded few stu
dents make it through the entire
thing. That is also not to say that
committee members should become
puppets of the ASSU leadership — a
practice that would essentially place
Emily Andrus every panel.
But, by the same token, commit
tee members should be selected who
have views on the issues they'll be
dealing with that are somewhat in
line with those of the ASSU presi
dent and the senate. And once those
students become involved with
their committee's work, they should
continue to report back to the
ASSU leaders who gave them their
jobs, whether the body reported to
is the president's office or the sen
ate. That will allow the students'
elected representatives to be kept
abreast of developments within
committees and will allow the elect
ed representatives to ensure that
committee members are not simply
advancing personal agendas.
Once students are placed on com
mittees by the senate, they must be
made accountable to it. The senate
was elected to represent the student
body, and the committee represen
tatives are chosen to represent the
interests of the senate. This link
between the student government
and its committee representatives
must be solidified.
The nominations commission's
procedures must be modified, and
now is the best time. Applications
for positions on committees are due
today, and it would be wise of the
commission to make these political
considerations before making their
final decisions.
