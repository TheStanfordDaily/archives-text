This spring, Community Farm is blossoming for all

IT IS DIFFICULT to respond to
Tuesday's editorial on the activities
of Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford without being over
whelmingly sarcastic. I will try to be
straightforward.
The Daily's claim that the organic
farm "has been recently neglected" is
wrong. I don't know where it comes
from. It isn't bad rumor; it is an error.
I saw the editorial after spending
the morning at the farm with nine peo
ple — six other students, one homeless
person and two community members
— transplanting amaranth, sunflower
and soybean seedlings, watering fruit
trees, digging beds and tending the
greenhouse built by Stanford students.
The news that the farm is "neglect
ed" is not an encouraging observation
for the 50-plus people who work there
during daylight hours every day of the
week, the 40-plus people who are regis

tered for the farm class being offered
this quarter, the 30-plus homeless peo
ple from Palo Alto who have worked at
the farm (and will sell food and cut
flowers from the farm), the many recip
ients of food donations and the 30-plus
Amigos de las Americas volunteers
(Stanford students and high school stu
dents) who will be trained in food pro
duction at the farm this weekend.
It is not encouraging for the many
faculty, staff and community members
who have supported and sponsored the
farm. The owner of a local hardware
stoi y that has donated tools to the
farm was especially surprised and dis
couraged that the farm was being
"neglected."
Most of all, it is not encouraging for
the 70-plus fruit trees and 30-plus vari
eties of crops that are thriving at the
farm.
It is no small problem that no Daily

staffers (including the writers of the
editorial) visited the community farm
prior to printing the editorial. The fact
that The Daily has not run an article
on the farm in recent weeks must
mean that it is "neglected," at least in
The Daily's mind. One of the writers of
the editorial got this information "from
talking to a friend in SEAS who told
me that she was unsure of the status of
the farm." That statement was inter
preted to mean that this is a "neglect
ed" project. Hardly thorough reporting.
On a more positive note, I am
encouraged by the work SEAS does and
will continue to do despite the editori
al. The organization uses its funds
more effectively and efficiently than
most student organizations.
What goes around comes around;
international issues are local issues.
Anyone who cannot see that connec
tion probably fails also to see the con

nection between deforestation in Latin
America and frequenting Jack in the
Box or McDonald's. The editorial failed
to mention SEAS' work with Bay Area
Action, Magic Inc. and other local orga
nizations. The editorial failed to men
tion the variety of campus work by
SEAS, including campaigns to increase
awareness of pesticides in campus food
and energy consumption by students.
I am encouraged that tomorrow
morning I will be growing my own food
and seeing others grow their own food,
fostering ecological literacy and land
stewardship. I will not be reporting or
commenting on sensationalist rumors
and criticizing the minority of students
at Stanford who concern themselves
with activism and humanitarian pur
suits.
