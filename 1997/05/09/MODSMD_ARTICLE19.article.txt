# Divestment protests of ’70s helped students become world citizens
## 
### 
On May 9, 1977 — 20 years ago today
— 293 people were arrested at Old
Union while protesting Stanford's
refusal to divest from companies doing
business in South Africa.
For some of us, a defining ir nent
of our education at Stanford w the
student movement in the sprin, of
1977 to persuade the University to vol
untarily divest its stock holdings in
U.S. corporations doing business in
South Africa. After negotiations with
President Richard Lyman and the
Hoard of Trustees stalled, the move
ment (with the distinctly unrevolution
ary title of Stanford Committee for a
Responsible Investment Policy, or

SCRIP) staged the largest student
demonstration since the end of the
Vietnam War followed by an "occupa
tion" of Old Union. Nearly 300 occu
piers were arrested by campus police
with varying degrees of politeness; they
were then transported and released in
the wee hours of the next morning near
the old auto plant in Milpitas.
Looking back over the intervening
decades, I have no regrets about being
part of the Stanford 293, despite familial
repercussions and the end of any chance
to become a Supreme Court justice. Leav
ing aside our fractious efforts to repeat
the entire history of the '60s student
movement in the space of only a few
months, our idealistic goals were vindicat
ed by the turn of history. The U.S. disin
vestment movement of the late 1970s was
recognized by the African National
Congress and Nelson Mandela, now South
Africa's president, as a beneficial force for
peaceful (underline that word four times)

change to a majority government.
I do not mean to use this 20th
anniversary as a self-congratulatory
event, however. SCRIP was a blip on the
national stage, and the majority of stu
dents at Stanford in 1977 kept far clear
of any confrontations with the Universi
ty administration. A goodly number of
us sustained quite fuzzy notions about
politics, recalling also that in the 19705,
Marxism was the lingua franca of stu
dent "leftists" everywhere. As I acquired
a wife, a family and a single-family
detached residence, "Das Capital"
wound up in the garage sale (and it
didn't sell, either).
But SCRIP and the short-lived move
ment at Stanford in the late 1970s
served its purpose. The push to force
corporate disinvestment from apartheid
South Africa became a national move
ment that resulted in a number of com
panies closing shop in the white-ruled
country. And in becoming a part of this

movement, we changed — and developed
as world citizens. Some of us went on in
life to work with progressive founda
tions or find other rewarding political
work. Others became doctors, bankers,
professional writers and the like, and
several are now millionaires. Too many
became lawyers, including myself.
Pd like to believe that what happened
on the evening of May 9, 1977, rubbed off
enough to matter even if we forget the
date. Committing to an issue far beyond
ourselves was a considerable leap even in
the protective womb of Stanford. We have
no flags, pins, memorials, alumni newslet
ters or Web pages. None of us are ever
likely to hold public office. But maybe,
someday, someone will walk into a Johan
nesburg pub, shoulder to shoulder with an
heir to Steven Biko, and lift a pint to the
"happy few" who sang in the Old Union
20 years ago.
