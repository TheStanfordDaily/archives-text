Have you always wanted to tiy
teaching? Stanford's Educational
Studies Program is looking for
Stanford students to volunteer to
teach motivated high school stu
dents through the Stanford High
School Enrichment Project.
"SHEP is a program that allows
community members to design a
ley teach for two hours
day for eight weeks,"
imore Liz Scheps, a
couidinator.
"The idea is to teach something
the kids would not learn in school,"
Scheps added.
Through the program, high
school students take three two
hour classes each Saturday. Past
classes have included Physics of
Siege Weaponry, Introduction to
Computer Graphics and "History
of the Beatles."
The program is a great learning
experience for both the high school
students and their instructors, said
sophomore Katherine Chan, co

vice chair of the Educational Stud
ies Program.
"I got involved last fall because I
am interested in being a teacher,
and SHEP offered me a great op
portunity to experiment with
teaching methods to find out what
keeps students' attention," said
Chan.
"Because the program is eight
weeks long, you really get to know
students," Chan added.
The program has also received
rave reviews from students.
Monta Vista High School stu
dent Peggy Liu said she was attract
ed to the program because of its in
volved treatment of interesting
subjects.
"I took "Mind and Develop
ment" because [the instructors] got
into the really interesting stuff, like
how the brain works and why you
do stuff," Liu said.
"I really liked the fact that we
learned various subjects and did not
feel like we had homework. I really
enjoyed learning without those re
straints," said Gunn High School
Student Heidi Stark.
The Educational Studies Pro
gram was founded in the spring of
1096 by David Harris, a Stanford
doctoral student in electrical engi
neering.
Harris based the program on the
concept originated by a 40-year-old
program at MIT.

"I wanted to get involved with
teaching at Stanford," said Harris.
"Stanford had really good programs
for disadvantaged kids, but lacked
enrichment classes. The idea be
hind [the program] was to create
enrichment classes that I wish I
would have taken as a kid."
SHEP is currently accepting ap
plications from anyone who is inter
ested in creating and implementing
a class for fall of next year. For more
information or to obtain a teacher
application. Send a message to
