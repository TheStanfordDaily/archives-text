## Without a land to call home

Yesterday, president Clinton
opened the first United States-Cen
tral America summit in 30 years. At
hand was the discussion of the estimated
300,000 Central Americans now living ille
gally in this country. A recent law says that
all illegal immigrants, with only 4,000
exceptions, will be deported from the U.S.
This promulgation is merely the currently
trendy way to continue decades worth of
blaming the victim for the bullies' crimes.
The tragedies of the civil wars in Cen
tral America are still trickling into world
consciousness. Because we painted the
leftist guerrillas as a Communist threat,
the United States propped up authoritari
an dictatorships. More than 12,000 docu
ments have been released indicating that
the U.S. government was not only aware of
the existence of death squads but actually
trained dozens of their principal leaders in
Georgia's School of the Americas.
To win political asylum or refugee sta
tus in the United States, one must prove
that a "well-founded fear of persecution or
future persecution exists on account of
race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group or political opin
ion." According to this definition, the
300,000 illegal immigrants should be
300,000 political refugees. That they are
instead at risk of deportation is frustrating
but hardly without historical precedent.
While we maintained our neutrality
through the early parts of World War 11,
boatloads of European Jews were turned

back from our eastern shore by FDR him
self. If he had allowed them to come, he
might have been in some way acknowledg
ing that they had something real to flee
from. And if they had something real to
flee from, why was the United States
doing nothing about it?
In the 1980s, as during and after the
Vietnam War, political refugees were more
likely to come from places controlled by
Communists such as Cuba and Nicaragua.
But people whose governments were will
ing to conspire with our own were much
more likely to be declared illegal immi
grants. Fear of death in El Salvador
weighed differently than fear of death in
Cuba on the U.S. scales of justice.
The tragedies trickle back to us slowly,
but the blood flows freely in Central Amer
ica. In their wake, in addition to some
80,000 dead, the civil wars left floods of
orphans and some 300,000 disabled chil
dren. People wanted to escape to this coun
try legally. But fear of death somehow lost
its legitimacy if, while one hand threat
ened to pull the trigger, the other was
shaking hands with Uncle Sam.
There will be no mass deportations,
Clinton assured Central American lead
ers. For"in these nations where democra
cy has prevailed ... it seems to me we
ought to be sensitive to the disruptions
that were caused during those tough years
that we were involved in as a nation." El
Salvador's president, Armando Calderon
del Sol, finds Clinton's promise "very

refreshing." Indeed he should. Calderon
del Sol is not the voice of El Salvador; he is
a figurehead propped up by the specter of
the most recent corrupt elections. What
prevailed in Central America was not
democracy. Death squads and starvation
were never even on the ballot.
Nativist rhetoric directed against those
who we basically drove from their homes
does seem illogical. But Clinton's conces
sions are hardly generous. The number of
people still suffering from the economic
and social ravages of these wars corre
sponds roughly to the entire populations
of the countries involved. The hunger they
suffer is political. However, fear of death
at the hands of those who sign starvation
legislation cannot officially exist. If Sal
vadorans fleeing death squads were not
eligible for political asylum, why should
Salvadorans who are dying from a ravaged
economy get a break? This makes sense
because the United States would look fair
ly bad if it acknowledged that its interna
tional policy not only supports death
squads but creates mass deprivation
among people it claims to be helping.
We are a nation proud of our histoiy,
and we tend to make sure it repeats itself.
