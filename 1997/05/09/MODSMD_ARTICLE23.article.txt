## Card looks to clinch at UCLA 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
The last time the No. 2 Stanford
baseball team (37-14, 20-7 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) faced
the No. 6 UCLA Bruins, it was touted
as the biggest series in years for the
Cardinal.
Tonight's contest might be the sin
gle biggest game in years for Stanford.
The squad is heading south to West
wood this weekend in an attempt to
clinch the Six Pac championship.
Stanford has already clinched a tie
for the title, holding a solid two-game
lead over the Bruins with only three
conference games left for both teams.
One win and Stanford will be champs.
The sooner in the weekend that win
comes, the better it will be for the Car
dinal.
"We have played 27 conference
games to get to this point," said junior
catcher Jon Schaeffer. Tonight "is the
most important game of the season."
The Card has worked hard all sea
son to put itself in the position it is
currently in. The players plan to do

nothing different and simply play
their game.
"We have a set goal," said junior
second baseman Joe Kilburg. "We
know what we want to do. The rest of
the season is in our hands and rests on
how we play."
Tonight's game has all the makings
of a dandy. The game will be a battle
between one of the most powerful
offenses in the nation in UCLA, and
one of the best pitchers in the nation
in Stanford hurler Kyle Peterson, a
junior.
Even with Peterson's tremendous
talent, the task before him is daunt
ing. UCLA's offensive power is the
most immense the Cardinal faces.
Leading the way for the Bruins is
junior Ail-American Troy Glaus. The
UCLA shortstop has hit an unbeliev
able team-leading 28 home runs and
77 RBIs. To go along with his .885
slugging percentage, Glaus has a .409
batting average and has scored a
school-record 85 runs.
The Bruins have hammered the
competition all season long, hitting
113 home runs as a team, while hold

ing the opposition to only 42. They
have homered in an impressive 47 of
their 54 games and are averaging 9.5
runs per game.
"They are a great offensive team,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "The have huge home run
numbers. We need to control their
power hitters."
Along with the fearsome offense,
UCLA's pitching is also very solid.
Today's starter, sophomore Tom
Jaquez (9-2), leads the staff with a
2.60 ERA and Sunday starter junior
Jim Parque (11-2) follows with a 3.18.
After a scorching 11-0 start by Par
que, the Cardinal handed him his first
loss of the season last time the two
squads met, and Parque has not won a
game since, picking up his second loss
to USC.
Fortunately, Stanford's offense is
excellent in its own right. Going into
this weekend's contests, all nine Car
dinal starters are hatting ahove .300.

.373 and riding a 12-game hit
ting streak. Schaeffer has also
been named the Six Pac player of
the week the last two weeks.
Injuries could be a factor for
the Cardinal as Kilburg remains
questionable with a broken toe
he suffered in the first game of
last weekend's series with Ari
zona. Kilburg, who is currently
hitting at a .357 clip, is hopeful
to play.
"This is probably the biggest
series we've been in during the
three years I've been here, so I
really want to be playing," Kil
burg said. "I'm going to definite

ly give it my all and try to be out
there."
Taking the mound for Stan
ford will be Peterson (9-2, 3.48
ERA) Friday, sophomore Brent
Hoard (8-3, 4.87 ERA) Saturday
and sophomore Chad Hutchin
son (5-3, 5.74 ERA) Sunday.
When the squads squared off
last month at Sunken Diamond,
UCLA was able to edge out the
series, taking two of three very
hard-fought games.
The Card took the first game
7-4, before UCLA was able to
bounce back with and 8-5 win on
the next day and a 5-3 victory on
the final day. Since then howev
er, Stanford has been on a tear,
winning eight in a row before
Tuesday's loss to No. 22 San
Jose State.
