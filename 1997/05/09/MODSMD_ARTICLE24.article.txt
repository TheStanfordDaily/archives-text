# Card closes season in Oregon
## Regional berth at stake for softball 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford softball (28-26-1, 7-16
Pacific 10 Conference) has its
final games of the season this
weekend in Oregon against Ore
gon tomorrow and Oregon State
on Sunday. The team hopes to win
four games in convincing fashion
and trump its bid to get into
regionals. The qualifiers for the
regional tournament are
announced Sunday evening.
The team put itself in great
position going into this weekend's
series by going 3-1 last weekend
""ishington and San
Stanford's three wins
ranked teams last
wwA-eiiv- .uow that it is deserving
to make postseason play. Combine
that with recent NCAA sanctions
against third-ranked UCLA which
prohibit the Bruins from partici
pating in the 1997 postseason,
and the Cardinal's chances look
good.
After a slow start, the team has
certainly peaked at the right time,

winning eight out of its last 12
games. Two of those losses came
against top-ranked Arizona, in
which the team played exception
ally well and impressed many. In
four of its last eight wins, the
team has beaten fifth-ranked
Washington, 24th-ranked Califor
nia and San Diego State. Both the
pitching and defense have been
exceptional, with sophomores
Marcy Crouch and Becky Blevins
giving strong performances game
in and game out and with the
fielders providing amazing sup
port.
"I feel our pitchers are at the
top of their games right now," said
senior third baseman Amanda
Renteria. "That should be the dif
ference between [this weekend
against the Oregon teams] and
last time we played. It should
allow us to win all four games."
The offense, which is perhaps
the weak link in the team's armor,
has shown improvement. Sopho
mores Michelle Acosta and
Michelle Schneider have come out
and provided consistent offensive
output during the second half of
the season.
In fact, each member of the
team has shown progress at the
plate. Hitting against the top
pitchers in the country when it
faces a Pac-10 opponent makes it
difficult to score in those games,
but it has also made each player
better. This can be seen in many
of the team's non-conference
games, when it commonly racks
up eight to 10 runs against oppos
ing pitchers.
Neither Oregon school had
much success against the team
when they came to the Farm earli
er this season. The Card took
three out of four games; it's only
loss that weekend against Oregon
was decided by one run in extra
innings. This weekend the Card
should be able to put up more

runs nnd contain the Oregon
teams if it continues to play the
way it has the final third of the
season.
Hesides the fact that the team is
playing better ball than it has all
season long going into the final four
games, another advantage that
Stanford has is the emotion that it
will have going into this weekend.
The adrenaline will be pumping
before each game, with the team
knowing that the opportunity to
play in the playoffs is on the line.
For some of it's more spirited
players, it will be the last chance
they have to make the regional
tournament. The team has given
110 percent in each of its games
this season, but look for an extra
10 percent to be givon this week
end considering what is riding on
the team's performance.
"We have to take some account
ability into our destiny by winning
the next four games," said Itente
ria. "We just have to do our best,
and the rest is left to those that
make the decision about region -
als."
