# Card closes season in Oregon
## Regional berth at stake for softball 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford softball (28-26-1, 7-16
Pacific 10 Conference) has its
final games of the season this
weekend in Oregon against Ore
gon tomorrow and Oregon State
on Sunday. The team hopes to win
four games in convincing fashion
and trump its bid to get into
regionals. The qualifiers for the
regional tournament are
announced Sunday evening.
The team put itself in great
position going into this weekend's
series by going 3-1 last weekend
""ishington and San
Stanford's three wins
ranked teams last
wwA-eiiv- .uow that it is deserving
to make postseason play. Combine
that with recent NCAA sanctions
against third-ranked UCLA which
prohibit the Bruins from partici
pating in the 1997 postseason,
and the Cardinal's chances look
good.
After a slow start, the team has
certainly peaked at the right time,

winning eight out of its last 12
games. Two of those losses came
against top-ranked Arizona, in
which the team played exception
ally well and impressed many. In
four of its last eight wins, the
team has beaten fifth-ranked
Washington, 24th-ranked Califor
nia and San Diego State. Both the
pitching and defense have been
exceptional, with sophomores
Marcy Crouch and Becky Blevins
giving strong performances game
in and game out and with the
fielders providing amazing sup
port.
"I feel our pitchers are at the
top of their games right now," said
senior third baseman Amanda
Renteria. "That should be the dif
ference between [this weekend
against the Oregon teams] and
last time we played. It should
allow us to win all four games."
The offense, which is perhaps
the weak link in the team's armor,
has shown improvement. Sopho
