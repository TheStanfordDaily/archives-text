### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team returns to action today as it
hosts the Cardinal Invitational at
Cobb Track and Angell field. The
event will feature runners from
schools all over the country as well
as many post-collegiate athletes.
All athletes have to meet a mini
mum meet standard in order to
compete.
"This is an opportunity for peo
ple from all over the country to
compete," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "This is a chance for
them to tune up late in the sea
son."
The meet will also provide ath
letes with a last-minute chance to
qualify for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships and NCAAs.

This is definitely one of Stanford's
objectives.
"There are still a few people we
need to get qualified" for Pac 10s,
Lananna said. "We want to be
tuned-up, prepped and peaked.
This is sort of the beginning of the
peak. This will be the last time for
thinking about qualifying for any
thing."
The meet will not be team
scored, so the focus will fall on
individual performances. Because
it is an invitational, the level of
competition will be very good, with
schools sending their top athletes
to the Farm.
The distance and middle dis
tance events for both the men and
women will be strong events for
the Cardinal. Stanford's depth in
