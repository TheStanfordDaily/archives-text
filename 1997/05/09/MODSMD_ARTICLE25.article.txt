team returns to action today as it
hosts the Cardinal Invitational at
Cobb Track and Angell field. The
event will feature runners from
schools all over the country as well
as many post-collegiate athletes.
All athletes have to meet a mini
mum meet standard in order to
compete.

compete," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "This is a chance for
them to tune up late in the sea

qualify for the Pacific 10 Confer

This is definitely one of Stanford's
objectives.
"There are still a few people we
need to get qualified" for Pac 10s,
Lananna said. "We want to be
tuned-up, prepped and peaked.

peak. This will be the last time for
thinking about qualifying for any
thing."
The meet will not be team

individual performances. Because
it is an invitational, the level of
competition will be very good, with
schools sending their top athletes

tance events for both the men and
women will be strong events for
the Cardinal. Stanford's depth in
