# WCCC title on line for cycling team

Stanford cycling hosts the
West Coast Cycling Conference
(WCCC) road championships this
weekend at Fort Ord near Mon
terey. Currently ranked No. 3 in
the WCCC, the Card will look to
move up in the standings and pos
sibly capture another conference
title with a solid team perfor
mance.
"I hope that we can defend our
championship," said medical stu
dent Cynthia Ferguson. "We're a
good climbing team, which will be
to our advantage, although there
is added pressure on the team
because many of them are helping
to organize the race."
In order to defend its crown,
Stanford will have to beat No. 1
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and No.
2 UC-Santa Barbara by a consid
erable margin. Due to low partici
pation in early-season races, Stan
ford fell behind by 52 points but is
currently only 80 points out of
first. A first-place team finish can
earn a team close to 800 points so
the Card is well-situated to make
a run for the title.
"We have a good shot at over
taking UCSB this weekend [in the
standings) and a lesser chance of
beating out Cal Poly, though it's
certainly not out of the realm of
possibility," said Stanford coach
Art Walker.
Stanford's climbing abilities
will be put to use on the hilly
course that winds through Fort
Ord. The 22.5-mile course begins
with a moderate three-mile hill,
followed by a brief downhill por
tion before a steep three-mile hill
which is certain to thin the pack
to the benefit of the good
climbers.
The remainder of the course is
rather hilly. A very steep but rela
tively short hill at the 19-mile
mark should be a grueling test for
Stanford's talented climbers.
Two Stanford women are
ranked in the top 15; Ferguson is
ranked No. 3 and doctoral student
Cathy Norbutas is ranked 14th.
Both women have a good shot at
capturing an individual title.
Another one to watch is Marie
Kirk, a law student, who has had
great success in the women's B
category and has the ability to do
some damage this weekend.
The Stanford men have four in

the top 25: doctoral student Pete
Armitage at No. 5, master's stu
dent Russell Mead at No. 12, doc
toral student Takeshi Doi at No.
15 and doctoral student Dario

Falquier at No. 23. These cyclists
have a good shot at the title and
should work together well in the
team time trials.
