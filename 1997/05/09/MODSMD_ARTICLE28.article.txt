# Women in lead at Pac-10s

When senior co-captain Mhairi
McKay asks her teammates,
"What are you going to shoot
today?" she expects them to set
high goals. And they have.
The Stanford women's golf
team is currently leading the
NCAA West Regional after one
round, shooting a 1-under-par 287.
"Our goal was to come out this
morning and shoot 4-over-par 292,
but the girls outdid themselves to
do better," said head coach Caro
line O'Connor.
The West Regional is being held
at the 6,012 yard, par-72 Randolph
Park North Course. The tourna
ment is hosted by Arizona in Tuc
son. There are 18 teams competing
in the three-round tournament for
the top 11 slots that advance to the
NCAA championship in Columbus,
Ohio.
McKay leads the Cardinal with
2-under-par 70, continuing a four
round streak of under-par play.
Sophomore Michelle Sperry and
senior co-captain Andrea Baxter
are tied at seventh at 72. Fresh
man Julie Dunn, in 18th place,

shot 73. Freshman Jae Jean Ro, in
30th place, rounds out the lineup
at 74. In team golf, the top four
scores of individual stroke play
each round is added for a team
total.
Because the course plays very
short and the fairways run hard,
other teams also shot low num
bers. Seventeen of the 100 players
3hot par or better. Both San Jose
State's Janice Moodie and Wash
ington's Dodie Mazzuca are tied for
first at 3-under par.
Stanford's play shows its deter
mination to win.
"Andrea really steps up her
game come NCAAs," O'Connor
said. "Michelle has gotten her
swing close to where it's supposed
to be."
The last time the Cardinal led
after the first round was the Peg
Barnard California Collegiate host
ed by Stanford last month. While
the golfers said it "felt good to be
leading," they plan to concentrate
on the play for today rather than
focusing on yesterday's win.
The team played its drive and
approach shots well, firing onto the
wide-open fairways. Several of the
players birdied the par-5 holes —

and even tried to eagle the holes —
though no eagles were recorded
yesterday.
If the team had any trouble at
all, it was on the greens. The
grainy, Bermuda greens proved to
be slow, rather than fast like
expected in previous tournament
play. The scorching Arizona weath
er produces little moisture and
results in dried-out greens being
cut too short. A few players' short
birdie putts wouldn't drop.
"I under-compensated a lot. I'd
watch my ball come two inches of
the hole and oh, it just broke my
heart," Dunn said.
Though that happened several
times, Dunn did make several solid
five- and six-foot putts for par to
heal her wounds.
A couple competitors suffered
heat exhaustion in the 92-degree
heat. The Stanford players have
kept themselves hydrated by
drinking gallons of ftatorade and
water, wearing their Stanford caps
and standing in shade.
Some even see the weather as
an advantage.
"This is perfect golf weather. It
feels like home," said Dunn, who
hails from I >as Vegas.
