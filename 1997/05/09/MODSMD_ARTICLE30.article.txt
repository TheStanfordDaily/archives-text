The house wanted to get a subscription to U.S.
News & World Report, and, naturally, I had to
oppose that on moral grounds. Things are
really tense now. Just the other day, Gerhard
tried to introduce paper napkins and Diet
Pepsi into the kitchen, so I staged a protest on
our veranda. It got hot after awhile, so I went
back in for some lemonade. But my biggest
worry is Chelsea. We threw a little birthday
bash for her, but I think she liked Clint's
Nikes better than my miniature organic com
post heap. I feel like no one in this house
understands me.

More Trouble

MAY 9, 1997
WEEK
FOURTEEN

Everyone in this house is so repressed' I left some
condoms and dental dams in the table in the liv
ing room, in hopes that would spark some con
versation, but everyone pretended the condoms
weren't there. So today I dressed up like a condom
and showed up for dinner, and still no one said
anything. I'm getting very angry. And I really wish
whoever took my collection of dildos and dental
dams would return it promptly l

I am very confused by these
feelings I have for Dr. Ruth.
Of all the people in the house,
she's the one I feel most close
to, and I think it's not just
because she lends me her
dildo. There's something very
special about her; plus she
reminds me of my mother,
which is always a plus.
