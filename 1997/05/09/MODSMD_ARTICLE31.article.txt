April HO, 1997, is an important date in
the life history of Aimee
Thanatogenos, at least in the hind
sight of May 1. 1997. This is the day
Aimee found out that her long-lost spiritual
sister, Chelsea, will join her next year in the
crusade to bring some class into this dump.
Chelsea is like me in a lot of ways: We're both
high-profile daughters of celebrities,
although my father isn't as famous a world
leader. Actually, now that I think of it. dad's
only experience with decision-making has
been operating the TV remote control and
putting together barbecues for our hopelessly
provincial neighbors and relatives. Hut that's
OK Like Chelsea. I have curly hair. And also
like Chelsea, I've been named after a neigh
borhood of a major city known for its high
number of bohemians and alcoholics.
Hut this day is also important for Aimee
because it's the day my close friend Kllen

DeGeneres finally came out. 1 personally am
not in the whole vagina business, hut I'm
glad someone out there is showing a woman a
good time. Most men don't know this, hut
orgasms are easier to fake than $8 hills.
Hut on a more personal note, this day is
also important for Aimee because it's the day
1 finally found someone I really clicked with.
He is not, for a change, involved with a mili
tia group or a member of the NRA. and, lucky
for me. he didn't even ask me to pay in
advance. His name's Pruce (names have been
changed to protect privacy), and he's funny,
sexy and smart.
1 met him in my CPR class. The way he
violently grabbed me when 1 accidentally
swallowed the plastic egg used for demon
stration impressed me to no end. Rv the time
lu« got me to spit out the egg (accidentally hit
ting my instructor's forehead). 1 knew I was
hopelessly and madly in love. Ever since then

we've done the usual romantic
things you see in montages in love
flicks: We extinguished several
forest fires, held hands in a Turk
ish prison and watched the sun set
during a riot in Beijing.
Yes. I'm in love. Finally I have
met a man who does not make me
wear a collar around my neck and
get down on all fours to bark. A

man who does not need me for my Colombian
drug contacts or my connections with chil
dren of famous alcoholics. Hut will this last'' I
can only hope that it will. Rut even if it
doesn't. Aimee can still find solace and plea
sure from lesser human forms.
Finally, I wanted to end by saying that
Aimee sincerely regrets offending the plant
community on campus. It seems like in one of
my previous columns I made a comment
about how plants are passive and serviceable

sexual partners, and, in retrospect, I realize
that was a cheap shot My apologies. Aimee
must learn to mend her ways, especially now
that she's looking for a job for next year. Yes,
my friends, Aimee did not get an KA position.
I tried to sneak past Ann Porteus' watchful
eyes and hring some subversion into Res Ed,
but she proved tougher than 1 thought. Well,
good for her.
