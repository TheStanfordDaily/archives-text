# Stage set for 106th Commencement
## Power outage, first daughter, championships highlight year 
### 
From an all-campus blackout
to Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff
winning the Nobel Prize, seniors
had no lack of excitement as their
time at Stanford came to a close.
Another winner
For the second year in a row, a
Stanford professor shared the
Nobel Prize for physics.
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff,
51, was one of three Americans
named as the 1996 Nobel Prize
winners this year for his research
on superfluid helium-3. The work
was done while Osheroff was a
graduate student at Cornell Uni
versity with his thesis advisers,
David Lee and Robert Richard
son.
University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost Condoleezza
Rice and other administrators
praised Osheroff for his represen
tation of his new home at Stan
ford. "I feel great, great" about
this, Casper said at the second
Nobel Prize-winner party he has
hosted in two years. "I couldn't
be better. It shows we are doing
something right."
In the dark
In early October, the entire
University suffered a four-hour
power outage after the campus
generator, Cardinal Cogen, was
damaged by rats in the switch
gear.
The outage led to continuing
disruptions in electricity, air con
ditioning and computer access

during the days afterward. It also
shut down Internet access for a
host of Silicon Valley companies.
The two rats found in the
underground conduits had been
exposed to extreme temperature
and voltage.
The incident was the first
major power outage at Stanford
since the cogenerator became the
main University power source in
1988.
PoliticN as usual
In the fall, author Dinesh
D'Souza and civil rights leader
the Rev. Jesse Jackson locked
horns in an intense debate in
Memorial Auditorium over affir
mative action and California's
Prop. 209.
D'Souza, who authored "The
End of Racism" and "Illiberal
Education," supported Prop. 209,
California legislation eliminating
state and local government affir
mative action programs. It was
passed in November.
Jackson did not support the
measure, emphasizing the need
for affirmative action to ensure
equal opportunity.
"Most of the people in the
world tonight are nonwhite,
young poor and don't speak
English," Jackson said. "We
must train our youth to live in
that world."
D'Souza argued that affirma
tive action is the "wrong way to
go about moving in increments to

a race-blind society."
The two were part of a series
of political speakers on campus
that saw appearances by all third
party candidates, including Ross
Perot and Ralph Nader.
A presidential nod
Of all the schools the first
daughter could have chosen,
Chelsea Clinton chose Stanford.
Clinton, 17, is a National
Merit semifinalist and standout

student at Washington's Sidwell
Friends School. She hopes even
tually to study medicine.
She will become the second
child of a sitting president to
attend Stanford. President Her
bert Hoover's son, Allan, Class of
'29, attended Stanford while his
father, himself a Stanford alum
nus, was president.
Although Stanford was always
under consideration, Clinton was
expected to study closer to home.
In addition to Stanford, more
than 3,000 miles away from the
White House, Clinton also con
sidered Princeton, Yale and
Brown universities.
"Planes run out there and
phones work out there. E-mail
works out there, so we'll be all
right," President Clinton said.
While at Stanford the weekend
before making her decision, Clin
ton attended a dance perfor
mance and a fraternity party and
purchased a Boysenberry Bliss
from Jamba Juice.
