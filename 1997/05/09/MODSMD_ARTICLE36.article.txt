## Power outage, first daughter, championships highlight year 
### 
From an all-campus blackout
to Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff
winning the Nobel Prize, seniors
had no lack of excitement as their
time at Stanford came to a close.
Another winner
For the second year in a row, a
Stanford professor shared the
Nobel Prize for physics.
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff,
51, was one of three Americans
named as the 1996 Nobel Prize
winners this year for his research
on superfluid helium-3. The work
was done while Osheroff was a
graduate student at Cornell Uni
versity with his thesis advisers,
David Lee and Robert Richard
son.
University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost Condoleezza
Rice and other administrators
praised Osheroff for his represen
tation of his new home at Stan
ford. "I feel great, great" about
this, Casper said at the second
Nobel Prize-winner party he has
hosted in two years. "I couldn't
be better. It shows we are doing
something right."
In the dark
In early October, the entire
University suffered a four-hour
power outage after the campus
generator, Cardinal Cogen, was
damaged by rats in the switch
gear.
The outage led to continuing
disruptions in electricity, air con
ditioning and computer access

during the days afterward. It also
shut down Internet access for a
host of Silicon Valley companies.
The two rats found in the
underground conduits had been
exposed to extreme temperature
and voltage.
The incident was the first
major power outage at Stanford
since the cogenerator became the
main University power source in
1988.
PoliticN as usual
In the fall, author Dinesh
D'Souza and civil rights leader
the Rev. Jesse Jackson locked
horns in an intense debate in
Memorial Auditorium over affir
mative action and California's
Prop. 209.
D'Souza, who authored "The
End of Racism" and "Illiberal
Education," supported Prop. 209,
California legislation eliminating
state and local government affir
mative action programs. It was
passed in November.
Jackson did not support the
measure, emphasizing the need
for affirmative action to ensure
equal opportunity.
"Most of the people in the
world tonight are nonwhite,
young poor and don't speak
English," Jackson said. "We
must train our youth to live in
that world."
D'Souza argued that affirma
tive action is the "wrong way to
go about moving in increments to
