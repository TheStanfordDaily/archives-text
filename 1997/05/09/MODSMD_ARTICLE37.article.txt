BIG SPLASH. Big Game.
Big Fun. What a day. For
me, that Saturday began at
6:45 a.m., when I awoke to the
noise of the rest of my suitemates
taking showers, blasting Alanis
Morissette, prodding me out of
bed saying, "Vanessa, it's time."
The excitement was so high, it
almost felt like Christmas. So, as
physically painful as it was, I got
out of bed and prepared for a full
day in Berkeley.
We were on the road within
the hour and made it to Berkeley
by 9 a.m., just in time to catch a
parking spot in the "Special
Event — $15" parking lot before
heading to the water polo game.

Early birds that we were, we
bought our tickets right away,
but within 10 minutes the line to
get into the water polo game
wrapped around the corner.
There were Cal hats galore bob
bing in line, but, considering the
early time and the fact that the
game was in Berkeley, there was
an impressive number of hard
core Stanford fans waiting as
well.
Inside the gates at Big Splash
— the name given to the annual
game played between Stanford
and Cal on Big Game day — Cal
fans may have outnumbered
Stanford ones in quantity, but
certainly not in spirit. Stanford
fans were intense as they cheered
loud and strong, far rivaling any
mutters attempted by Cal.

During the game, the Cardinal
water polo team had its
moments, but didn't compete up
to its usual quality of play, receiv
ing a disappointing 9-7 loss to the
Bears.
Nevertheless, the fans
remained supportive, knowing
their team could make it up at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration tournament next week.
At one point in the game, play
was delayed as an immature Cal
fan mercilessly threw our "Go
Big Red" boy — a Phi Delt pledge
dressed in red pajamas with a
water polo stretched on his head
who was instructed to lead the
Cardinal fans in this infamous
cheer — into the pool. Clearly,
the Bears were jealous. Here they
owned three-quarters of the
crowd and there was not even one
"Big Blue" boy to lead cheers.
The streets on the way to the
football stadium were festive,
lined with people of all ages wear
ing vivid blue or red colors. We
missed the kickoff, arriving about
15 minutes late but were ecstatic
to see that Stanford had already
scored its first field goal and
touchdown.
For the first time in a long
while at a Stanford football game
we had difficulty finding seats,
ending up in the middle of a
freshman dorm section (Go
Larkin!). The crowd was already
rambunctious, and within a few
minutes of our arrival, Stanford
scored another touchdown, mak
ing the fans wild with joy.
With the exception of those
few who had drank a bit too much
that morning, no Stanford stu
dents sat down on the bleachers
during the entire game. Specta
tors stayed riveted as the action
was so close to them in the
stands, and the outcome looked
