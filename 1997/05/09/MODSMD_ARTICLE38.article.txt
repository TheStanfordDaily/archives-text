U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Breyer will deliver the
Commencement address to Stan
ford's Class of 1997 on June 15.
"I'm very flattered that I would
be asked and very pleased at the
invitation," Breyer said in a state
ment.
The decision to ask Breyer was
made by the senior class presi
dents and University President
Gerhard Casper.
"He's a dynamic speaker," said
class president Jason Koepp-
Herthel, who heard Breyer speak
while attending the Stanford in
Washington program. "He has a
lot of very thoughtful things to
say, and his son, Michael, is in our
class. We're really looking forward
to what he has to say."
Breyer said having his son in
the audience in June would not be
much different than usual.
"Michael gets my advice all the
time," Breyer said.
Michael Breyer said he was
very pleased with his father's invi
tation back to Stanford and
affirmed that he did, indeed,
receive plenty of advice from the
elder Breyer.
Stephen Breyer, who graduat
ed from Stanford with great dis
tinction in 1959 with a bachelor's
in philosophy, began his career in
government early.
During his undergraduate
tenure at Stanford, he was active
in Model United Nations, Delta
Sigma Rho — the national hon
orary speech and debate fraternity
— and the Foreign Scholars Com
mission. He also unsuccessfully
ran for student office on a plat
form to put more bicycle racks on
campus.
After attending Oxford Univer

sity and winning a Marshall Schol
arship in 1961, he went on to earn
his law degree from Harvard Uni
versity in 1964.
Breyer has also served as a
lawyer for the .Justice Department
and chief counsel to the Senate
Judiciary Committee and clerked
for former Supreme Court Justice
Arthur Goldberg.
He was appointed to the
Supreme Court in 1994 by Presi
dent Clinton after serving as a fed
eral judge in New England for
nearly 14 years.
The four senior class presidents

initially compiled a list of about 10
people affiliated with Stanford
whom they wanted to hear speak
at Commencement. They gave an
unranked list to Casper, who
extended a formal invitation to
Breyer.
"We feel as though we repre
sent the Senior Class," said class
president Yu-Jim Kim.
"We tried to get a feel for what
the class wanted. Part of our
research was finding out who our
class wanted to send them off into
the world."
The class presidents used their

World Wide Web site to gauge
interest.
"Many responses indicated
Justice Breyer," Koepp-Herthel
said.
Last year, the announcement
of the Commencement speaker
did not come until late January.
The decision was easier this year,
said Koepp-Herthel.
"I feel like it was [because ofl
whom we wanted, and we settled
on that name quickly," he said.
Me added that they wanted to
reach Breyer early so he could
make plans far in advance.
