# Michael Breyer and other politicians' children find identities of their own once at Stanford
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
When she enrolls as a freshman next fall,
Chelsea Clinton will be Stanford's most famous
political offspring in recent memory, but she
won't be the only one.
Among the current crop of students who pre
fer the Farm to the Beltway are senior Michael
Breyer, the son of Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Breyer — who will be this year's Com*
mencement speaker — and senior Mercedes Cis
neros, the daughter of former U.S. Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros.
Breyer and Cisneros say their experiences
diverge from what will most likely be Clinton's
in that they are rarely recognized or approached
on campus about their fathers.
When the general subject of parents' jobs
arises, both Breyer and Cisneros said they down
play their fathers' positions. However, on the
relatively infrequent occasions when other stu
dents are already aware of who their fathers are,
talking to these students is a pleasure rather
than a burden.

"People are genuinely interested in finding
out what it's like," Breyer said. "The judiciaiy
compared to the executive and legislative areas
of government — people know less about it.
People want to know what it's like to be on the
Supreme Court."
For Cisneros, moving to California from her
native Texas meant a significant — and welcome
— decrease in name recognition. Her father
became mayor of San Antonio when she was 6
years old and was the first-ever Chicano mayor
and subsequently, in the Clinton administra
tion, the first-ever Chicano Cabinet member. He
left Washington in January to run a Spanish
language television station headquartered in
Los Angeles.
"My dad isn't so high-profile," she said.
"Most of the time we can do things very, veiy
easily (in California.) In Texas, we get stopped
all the time with people wanting to shake his
hand."
This recognition brought along certain
responsibilities, Cisneros said. During high
school, Cisneros was at a party
where people were drinking alco
hol when word spread that some
one had called the police. Most
guests left, but Cisneros and sev
eral friends decided to stay at the
house and hide in a closet. The
police never came, but when Cis
neros told her older sister about
the incident the next day, her sis
ter scolded her.
"My sister said, 'You can't do
things like that. If you were
caught, it would make it onto the
front page of the paper,' " Cis
neros said.
Having her father in the spot
light has been a way of life for Cis
neros, she said. Cisneros was in
utero when her father embarked
on his first campaign for public
office, running for city council.
"He has this joke he likes to tell,
which I don't find funny at all,"
Cisneros said. According to the
joke, which her father would recite
at fund-raising events and rallies,
Cisneros emerged from her moth
er's stomach, stuck out her hand
and said, "Hi, my dad's Henry Cis

neros. Vote for him."
Cheesy jokes aside, Cisneros
said she feels fortunate to have
enjoyed some of the privileges of
her father's job. "I feel like I've
been exposed to a lot of things that
normal people don't get to do," she
said. For example, Cisneros has
met President Clinton several
times. The first time, when she
was a senior in high school, she
received some interesting advice
from the president.
Cisneros told Clinton that
Stanford was her first choice, and
his response was, "If I could do my
undergraduate years again, I
would go to Stanford."
Breyer, who has also met Clin
ton, said he considers himself for
tunate about the opportunities his
father's position has afforded him.
During spring break, Breyer sat in
on the Supreme Court's oral argu
ments about indecency on the
Internet.
This June, instead of Breyer
dropping in on his father's life, the
opposite will occur: Stephen Brey
er, who graduated from Stanford
in 1959, will give the address at
his son's graduation. Michael
Breyer has mixed feelings about
this event.

"On the one hand, I get tons of
advice from him, so what's anoth
er 30 minutes?" he joked. "On the
other hand, it's nice for me. When
I see him speak, I'll remember he
[attended Stanford] and my
grandfather was here and they
went through graduation and had
the same questions about what
they wanted to do with the rest of
their lives. It's reassuring to me to
know they faced these same ques
tions."
Breyer and Cisneros said
although they admire their
fathers, they do not feel compelled
to follow in their footsteps. Brey
er, an economics major, is unsure
of his immediate plans but hopes
they will involve public service.
However, he is not interested in
law. Cisneros, a sociology major,
will teach elementary school in
Los Angeles next year. She has dif
ficulty picturing herself as a politi
cian.
"My dad's known as being a
really good speaker. Those skills
didn't come with the genes," she
said.
As much as she looks up to him,
Cisneros still sees her father as
pretty typical. "I don't feel like
he's anybody but just Dad.... He

wears his undershirt and slacks
downstairs," she said. "It's weird
occasionally to open the newspa
per and see his picture. But it's
weirder for other people who knew
of him and then got to know him
on a personal level."
Breyer also said he sees his
father primarily as a dad rather
than as a member of the Supreme
Court. As a child, Breyer had great
difficulty learning to read, so his
father spent half an hour with him
every day trying to help.
Another vivid childhood memo
ry is his father's habit of cracking
hard-boiled eggs against his head,
usually during family picnics. "I
thought, 'Wow, this is a great
thing to do,' " Breyer said. "I was
really excited about it."
Once when his father was on
the phone, Breyer was trying to
crack an egg against his own head.
He was unsuccessful and passed
his father another egg for demon
stration purposes. The egg was
raw and broke all over Breyer's
father.
While this would have made a
poor photo opportunity for a pub
lic figure, it was no big deal for a
dad. Breyer said his father "took it
very well."
