# Campus copes with prejudice
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A recent outbreak of widely publicized hate
crimes on campus has led to discussions and
protests to address a number of issues, includ
ing how to combat the incidents and what re
strictions may be placed on one's freedom of
expression.
Recent incidents have included the homo
phobic graffiti at The Bollard eating club at the
Suites, the alleged rejection using anti-gay
statements of students from a party at Kappa
Sigma House and the use of offensive epithets
at a recent campus Eurotrash party.
"This kind of thing is really sickening," said
freshman Eugene Walters. "There's a kind of

politically correct silence that covers the cam
pus. No one really wants to say anything about
it."
Tommy Woon, multicultural educator in
the Dean of Students Office, said the incidents
are not necessarily indicative of any trend.
"These incidents don't represent an in
crease or decrease [of crimes) to me. They rep
resent the realities of a world that hasn't been
able to overcome prejudice," Woon said.
Prejudice on campus
"There are people in American society who
unfortunately hate and denigrate other people
because of prejudice and bigotry," said junior
Lamar linker, co-chair of the Black Student
Union. "We would like to think that Stanford is

a special place where these ideas and the people
who hold them do not exist. . . [but] the recent
events serve as a reminder that our idealism
might be somewhat naive."
Junior Rene Zermeno, whose room in Mir
rielees I louse was vandalized last year with ho
mophobic and racist comments, said he saw all
hate crimes as interconnected and that the re
cent homophobic incidents may have encour
aged more such hate crimes.
"I feel like it definitely lowered the thresh
old so that people felt comfortable using that
kind of expression," he said. "They saw it hap
pen at The Bollard, and it made it more feasible
to do it in another setting, directed at another
group."
He also said he thinks the Of
fice of Residential Education
should do more to address the sit
uation.
"There are speakers' bureaus
that happen in the residences, but
I think it needs to go beyond that.
There's a lot of room for creativity
here, and I think it's up to Res Ed
to do something about it,"he said.
The need for more awareness
Senior Jason Herthel, resident
assistant at Kappa Sigma House,
said he thinks the recent homo
phobic incidents and the public at
tention they have received could
have both positive and negative
effects.
"It's unfortunate that it took
the occurrence of these incidents
to raise awareness on campus
about hate crimes," Herthel said.
"I thought it was very surprising
that these types of things could
occur at a place like Stanford that
is supposed to be very socially and
culturally aware.
"The other thing I wonder is,
[whether] the more people protest
about it, the more people [ may 1 try
to perpetrate hate crimes," he
added.
Sophomore Meehan Rasch
agreed that the incidents are be
coming more visible.
"In a way it's almost easier to
deal with stuff that's so blatant —
i.e., homophobic graffiti or racist

remarks written in the Asian
American Activities Center — but
when there aren't those kinds of
incidents, it's harder to point to
the attitudes that most of us are
aware do exist," she added.
Cindy Ng, assistant director of
the Asian American Activities
Center, said the increased visibili
ty of hate crimes may be due to the
current political climate in Cali
fornia.
"Maybe with the recent politi
cal trend in California — the pas
sage of Prop. 209, the attacks on
affirmative action — perhaps this
has contributed to an atmosphere
where people feel it's OK to partic
ipate in this kind of activity," she
said.
But the recent hate crimes may
not have only negative effects, ac
cording to sophomore Jane Kim,
chair of the Asian American Stu
dents Association.
"In some ways I think that hate
crime is sometimes good for the
Stanford campus because it
makes the community realize that
we're not free from racism and ho
mophobia, which people can as
sume when they're in a sheltered
place like Stanford," Kim said.
"Ironic as it is, hate crimes
tend to bring communities to
gether," she said. "When we're
content and apathetic, it contin
ues to grow and fester. Only when
we're together and we're aware
will be able to fight" it.
In search of a concrete policy
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, there is no U liversity
policy that regulates speech.

"We can't control what comes
out of someone's mouth in terms of
their speech, and we can't control
actions per se," Wais said. "Howev
er, the University can make a con
certed effort to educate people [and]
make them aware of the values of
this institution and community.
"If a Stanford student perpe
trates a legally defined hate crime
on campus, the University would
certainly pursue the matter
through judicial affairs as a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard and would also have the op
tion of pursuing this type of case
criminally," he said.
Students and administrators
debated the issue of free speech
three years ago, when a group of
students filed a lawsuit against
the Fundamental Standard inter
pretation titled "Free Expression
and Discriminatory Harassment."
Also called the Grey Interpreta
tion of the speech code, the
amendment spelled out when the
face-to-face use of racial epithets
or their equivalent could be
viewed as harassment and, there
fore, as a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
The interpretation was put
into effect in 1990 but declared
unconstitutional by the Santa
Clara County Superior Court
after students brought the law
suit against it in May of 1994.
"There's a tension on this cam
pus between freedom of expres
sion — a constitutionally protect
ed freedom — and demeaning, of
fensive speech," said Ann Por
teus, assistant director of Res Ed.
"The question is, when does be

havior become so offensive that it
falls under . . . the Fundamental
Standard at this University.
"Under the Grey [interpreta
tion], there was clearly a kind of
tightening of what was allowable
and what wasn't... so with that
code taken away, we struggle more
in a way," she said.
Porteus added that "we're in a
climate where we have to figure out
how we can address offensive acts
against an individual and a com
munity and how we can further the
dialogue to help us a 11... move be
yond this kind of behavior."
Jane Camarillo, director of Res
Ed, said the role of Res Ed alone
has limits.
"I don't know if we, Residential
Education, alone can 'prevent'
acts of intolerance or hate. This
must come forward as an effort by
all involved in the community,"
she said.
Promoting understanding
Woon also said a letter written
to The Daily last week and signed
by most employees of the Dean of
Students Office aimed to encour
age "civic dialogue."
"We don't ve all the answers,
but we're going to be investigat
ing what opportunities we have to
coordinate discussion," Woon
said. "This is part of our ongoing
work ... to examine how strong
our community is and to work to
keep it strong."
Woon said he plans to hold a
one-day, off-campus retreat on
homophobia early next fall quar
ter "for people to come together
and discuss homophobia."
