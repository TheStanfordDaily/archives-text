## What's changed? A lot more than it looks like 
### 
SO THERE I was, brainstorming of
what to write for my first Daily col
umn. I attempted to come up with a
theme that was profound, wise and who
knows, maybe even memorable. I stressed
about what to write, looking through my
last four years for that one truly enlight
ening event that changed my life, or at
least my view on life.
Well, in the end, my search came up
empty — completely blank, zero, zilch,
nada. Needless to say, I was a little disap
pointed in myself. Surely, I thought, there
must be something significant that has
happened to me in the last four years that
has made me more aware of the world
around me. I mean, isn't that what college
is all about? But there was nothing I could
think of to write. I began to question
whether I had learned anything at all.
OK, so maybe I still look the same.
About nine months ago, I went to catch a
movie at the movie theaters, and the
woman at the ticket counter asked me
how old I was. At first, I was a little con
fused, and then it became clear to me that
she was making sure I was old enough to
see an R-rated movie!
I was a little insulted afterward and

thought, wow, I guess I haven't changed
that much at all — on the outside. But
what about on the inside? Was college just
an expensive hobby? Am I the same per
son today mentally as the person who
received his high school degree just four
years ago?
The answer to that question ... is a
resounding no. I am not the same person
I was when I graduated high school. I
have learned a lot in my time at Stanford,
and my views on a number of issues have
changed significantly. At the same time,
my views on a number of other issues
have only served to be reaffirmed and
strengthened.
I realized that I have grown and
matured a lot over the last four years.
This maturity, however, cannot be
attributed to just one or even a few events
in my college career. Rather, it is the sum
result of all my experiences and of all the
lessons I learned. I have looked back on
each of the past four years and decided
that with the passing of time, there were
some valuable lessons to be learned each
year.
The first lesson I learned in college was
that the variety of people to meet is sever

al magnitudes greater than it was in high
school. In my freshman dorm, I met peo
ple from all over the nation and all over
the globe. I was amazed at the distances
some students traveled in order to go to
school. The stories they told of their lives
back home brought to life the fact that
there was a whole slew of people in the
world I have yet to meet.
Hailing from different places, people
were naturally different in a lot of ways.
Yet despite these differences, I found that
what brought me closest to these people
were the similarities. I saw that all fresh
men share the same basic experiences
during their first year. As one must learn
from the differences between people, one
can also find comfort and relish in the
similarities. That's one of the lessons I
learned the first year, and it continues to
be true today.
So that was freshman year. What the
heck did I learn the other three years?
Awareness was the key thing I learned
sophomore year. I learned that disagree
ing is in its own sense an art form and
that there is an important distinction that
must be made between emotional and
rational arguments. It is hard to combat

one with the other, and it isn't always
clear under what category the argument
you are hearing falls. While it was impor
tant to eventually pick a side on any given
issue, it was also important not to pick
that side arbitrarily.
My junior year .. . well, that was an
interesting time. I realized my limits.
During the beginning of the year, I over
committed my time. I enrolled in three
hard computer science courses, played in
the Band during football season and took
on the position of news editor at The
Daily.
Juggling those three things alone took
talent, but in the end, no amount of disci
plined scheduling could have saved me
and I finally had to admit defeat. 1 ended
up dropping one of my classes late in the
quarter, swallowing the dreaded "W" in
its first quarter of its existence. The les
son I learned that year: You can't do it all.
You will eventually be forced to make
some tradeoffs.
I have a feeling sometimes that life is
full of tradeoffs. Obviously, if we nil lived
indefinitely, we could do all the things wo
ever wanted to do. In the real world, how
ever, there are time limits. You can only

do so much, and in the end, you just hope
and pray that what you did was enough to
make a difference to someone. I certainly
realized that my junior year.
Now that I'm a senior, I have learned
that each of those lessons has changed
me. This year, I have also noticed that
more of my sentences begin the words,
"You know, when 1 was a freshman.. .
I have learned that time is an enemy as
one gets older. Four years pass by pretty
quickly, and the real world seems to just
breathe down my neck as I get closer to
graduation. 1 realized that getting an edu
cation sure beats the heck out of having a
real job, and I wondered why I didn't see
this sooner.
College has given me the ability to
define myself more. 1 guess you can say
that I have discovered myself while at
Stanford. I have found the kind of person
I want to be the rest of my life. The ironic
part is, I really wasn't even looking.
