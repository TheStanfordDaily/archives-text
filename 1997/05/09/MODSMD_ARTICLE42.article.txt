noon in April to rally against homopho
bia, racism and sexism on campus.
A rash of hate crimes had occurred
on campus during the month, and stu
dent emotion ran high.
"Hate breeds, and so long as people
allow things to go past them, it's going
to continue," said doctoral student
Suzie Walker, one the organizers of the
April protest.
Walker added that the rally's pur
pose was "to combat all hate crimes."
Among the events that aroused stu
dent anger were an incident of anti-gay
vandalism in The Bollard eating club at
the Suites, as well as racist and anti-gay
slogans plastered on the door of an
apartment in Mirrielees.
Weenies roasted
On Nov. 23, the Cardinal football
team crushed its eternal rival, Califor
nia, 42-21 in the 99th Big Game.
The win clinched Stanford's second
straight bowl appearance under head
coach Tyrone Willingham, an accom
plishment the Card followed with a vic
tory over Michigan State in the Sun
Bowl on New Year's Eve in El Paso,
Texas.

After a dismal start, football finished
the season with a winning record, sur
prising a great many fans en route. The
team had a 2-5 record midway through
the fall.
The game, played this year at Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium, was never
close, with the Cardinal jumping out to
an early 17-0 lead. Cal's attempts at a
comeback fell flat.
Big Game, known for enthusiastic
crowds that sometimes get out of hand,
was not without a taste of violence this
year. A Cal yell leader — eventually
cleared of all charges — allegedly incit
ed the crowd to attack Stanford's Tree,
Chris Cnry, whose costume was torn to
shreds.
Cary raised funds in White Plaza for
a new costume, which debuted later in
the year.
Title after title
Stanford's men's and women's volley
ball teams played their school proud
this year, both ending the season with
national championships. They added to
men's and women's cross country
teams' titles earlier in the year, taking
Stanford's total for the year to four.

The women traveled to Cleveland,
Ohio, in December, crushing the
1 lawaii Rainbow Wahine to end the sea
son with a 31-2 record. Stanford All-
Americans junior setter Lisa Sharpley,
freshman outside hitter Kerri Walsh,
junior outside hitter Kristin Folkl and
senior middle blocker Eileen Murfee
took on their Rainbow Wahine counter
parts and emerged with the title after
four games. Hawaii took the first 15-5,
but the Cardinal countered with 15-11,
15-6 and 15-9 wins.
The men — including senior Mike
Lambert, who returned to the Farm
from a year with the U.S. Olympic team
defeated UCLA, which had held the
No. 1 rank for much of the season, for
the second time in as many weeks to
clinch their title.
In Columbus, Ohio, they breezed
through the first round of the Final
Four, topping Ball State in three games.
The Bruins proved tougher, matching
the Cardinal's first two wins with two
of their own before Stanford won the
final game 15-13.
