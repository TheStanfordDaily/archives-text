# Strip and bear it Alpha Sig hosts Exotic Erotic
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Staff writer 
If you're in love with someone
who doesn't love you back, you prob
ably think you'll never see that per
son naked. However, this weekend
you might get your chance.
Tomorrow, Alpha Sigma will
host its annual Exotic Erotic. Al
legedly the biggest and definitely the
barest Stanford party of the year,
Exotic Erotic has been cited in
Rolling Stone magazine and the Los
Angeles Times for its festive
raunchiness and good-humored ex
hibitionism. Guests are encouraged
to wear as little as possible â€” in
terms of wardrobe tips, Alpha Sig's
house officers offered suggestions
ranging from "shoes and socks" to
"sandals" to "dancingshoes."
For guests who are feeling more
modest, costumes are encouraged.
In past years, these costumes have
included makeshift, coverings con
sisting of books, leaves and banana
peels. A current resident said she
plans to dress as an alien this year.
Sophomore Owen Brizgys, a
house officer who is helping orga
nize the event, said Exotic Erotic is
more about liberation than lascivi
ousness. "It's not a bunch of sickos
who just want to see some naked
ness," Brizgys said. "It's one night
where people can say, 'I'm feeling
the love. Monday, I can go back to
the library and study, but tonight
I'm going to be a little different.'"
According to sophomore Steve
Kessler, a house officer, "It's all
about feeling comfortable with each
other."
Sophomore Santos Marroquin
said he also hopes to dispel concerns
students might have about the
party. Some people envision Exotic
Erotic as "a bunch of horny guys

and two dumb girls," Marroquin
said. "But it's more than that. It's a
lot of people letting go for one day."
To foster an atmosphere in
which people am let go, the party's
organizers have arranged for fog
machines, dim lighting, heaters, al
cohol (for those over 21), places to
store extra clothes and lots of music.

Both Lifskada, a student ska band,
and IXI Toby, who is headquartered
in I/)s Angeles and San Francisco,
will perform.
The origins of Exotic Erotic an;
ia the "Pimp and Prostitute Party,"
which was formerly hosted by Alpha
Sig. During tin; '80s, in a nod to an
increasingly sensitive political and

cultural climate, the "Pimp arid
Prostitute Party" was phased out.
The fact that these kinds of par
ties emerge from AlphaSigis unsur
prising given the general flavor of
the house, Brizgys said. "It's white
trash," he said. "It has a 'liaising

kind of feel. But for [Exotic Erotic],
we're trying to change that. We're
trying to get a more groovy vibe."
For Brizgys, hosting Exotic
Erotic represents a coming of age of
sorts Originally from Palo Alto,
Brizgys was a senior at Palo Alto
High School when he came to Stan
ford for a volleyball game and saw a
flier for Exotic Erotic. He and sev
eral friends finagled their way in.
However, he said, "it was a little in
timidating, so we left kind of early."
Last year, as a freshman, Brizgys
came but said, "I didn't show it all."
Although he is becoming incre
mentally bolder, Brizgys said he
probably will not show it all this
year, either. "It'd be really embar
rassing," he said. "Genetics is a

bitch, you know?" Nonetheless,
both for himself and for others, he
promised the evening will be
"epic."
Marroquin has helped to gener
ate anticipation for this epic event
with a World Wide Web site
http://zonker.stanford.edu/~-exotic,
which offers visitors the option of
making suggestions to Alpha Sig.
Although the site has received
more than 1,000 hits so far, only one
person has sent a response. Accord
ing to Marroquin, this individual
had both lofty and mundane con
cerns. First, he said he plans to lose
his humanity at the party. Second,
he said he hopes Fritos will be
served. Marroquin said he can pret
ty much guarantee the former. As
for the Fritos, house management is
still working on it.

Exotic Erotic starts at 10p.m. Sat
urday and is open to all Stanford
students.
