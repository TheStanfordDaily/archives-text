Ambassador James Goodby spoke about NAT() en
largement and an undivided Europe in front of a pre
dominantly older crowd of 200 at Campbell Itecital
I fall yesterday.
Goodby is the 1996-97 Payne 1 )istinguished Profes
sor at the Institute for International Studies and is for
mer principal negotiator and special representative of
President Clinton for nuclear security and dismantle
ment. The lecture was part of the 1996-97 Arthur and
Frank Payne Lectureship series.
Goodby argued that the issue of NATO enlarge
ment is a global one that demands coherent U.S. policy
and emphasized NATO's role in preserving peace in
Europe after the conclusion of World War 11.
"When World War 11 ended, we hoped it would never
happen again," Goodby said. "Americans remained in
Europe after the war, and the NATO treaty went into
effect in 1949, preventing any conflict involving Ger
many or France."
The logic behind the extension of NATO is that the
treaty would stabilize the political atmosphere in East
ern Europe as it onee did for Western Europe, Goodby
explained.
On July 8 and 9, the current 16 members of the
NATO alliance will meet in Madrid and invite certain
nations to join the alliance.
Among the 12 applicants, the Czech Hepublic, Hun
gary and Poland are most likely to gain admission.
Goodby quickly added, however, that Romania, Slova
kia and Slovenia have also garnered some popular sup
port.
Goodby argued that applicants seek to join the al
liance to gain protection under the Security (Juarantee
of Article 5 of the treaty, which states that attack on a
member of the alliance represents an intrusion upon
all participating states and will be treated as such.
The purpose of the NATO enlargement Ls to "inte

grate more countries into an existing community of
values, thereby enhancing stability and security of the
region," said (ioodby.
According to (ioodby, one of the positive aspects of
NAT() has been its denationalization of defense f>oliey,
which led political leaders of member nations to work
together in establishing defense budgets.
Asa result of the shift to global cooperation, numer
ous mutually-supporting institutions emerged. For in
stance, the NATO-Russian charter, to l>e signed May
27, creates a framework for NAT() countries to consult
day-by-day with Russia.
The Combined Joint Task Force, a peace-keeping
institution that includes Russia, is an example of the
primary way NATO will operate in the future, said
Goodby.
NATO's enlargement, has been supported by many
under certain premises. One is that security guaran
tees to some Eastern European states will enhance
stability throughout Europe. Others include the idea
that blurring the distinction between member coun
tries and non-member countries can reassure the non
members and that the distinction can be erased alto
gether in the long term as democratic Russia integrates
with the West.
(ioodby explored the argument against expansion
by saying that East European countries will not Im; as
sured by Poland's joining NAT(), that Article 5 protec
tion is too blatant to allow blurring of the distinction
between members and non-members and that NATO
does not have a policy that Russia should someday be
come a member of the alliance.
The ambassador argued that realistic expectations
lead him to conclude that the "enlarge and pause"
strategy will be followed, as a few new nations will be al
lowed entry into NATO, after which reaction of other
states will 1m? gauged.
In conclusion, (ioodby stressed the importance of
