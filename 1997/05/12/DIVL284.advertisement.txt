A Master of International Business
(in Mexico, France or Germany)
In today's globally competitive environment, many companies are looking for managers with
multicultural business and language skills. Pepperdine's innovative Master of International Business
(MIR) is a unique 20 month program that provides you with practical management skills and a
thorough understanding of international competition. While language proficiency is certainly to
your advantage, it is not a requirement for admission to the MIB program, nor do you need an
undergraduate business degree or work experience. Hie first year combines international business
courses with intensive Spanish, French or German language study at our campus in Malibu,
California. During the second year in Mexico, France or Germany, you will complete your studies as
well as an internship. Broaden your career horizons with the Master of International Business degree.
