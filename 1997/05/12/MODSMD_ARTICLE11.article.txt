Saldivar's committee on
housing should listen
to Draw's participants

IN MOST CASES, the term lot
tery brings to mind pleasant
thoughts. Never mind that you
have a statistically greater chance of
being struck by lighting something
like three times than actually win
ning the jackpot — there's still the
chance of becoming inordinately
wealthy, and who doesn't like that?
As the New York Lotto points out,
"Hey, you never know."
Of course, most of us are also
familiar with another connotation
for lottery, that employed by Shirley
Jackson in her short story of that
name. In the lottery she describes,
the winner has the good fortune to
be stoned by her neighbors.
Stanford's most famed lottery is
getting geared up once again this
year, and its introductory phase
came to a close at 11:59 last night,
when the Axess system shut down
for the night and by which time all
applications for the 1997 housing
Draw must have been entered. Cer
tainly our little lottery is more like
the ones orchestrated by states
across this country; still, though
many students will end up feeling as
though they have suffered an out
come not significantly more pleas
ant than that of Jackson's "win
ner." It is not uncommon to hear a
student who has drawn very poorly
bemoaning his impending "fate
worse than death."
The Draw is well aware of its
inadequacies. Before it will accept
your entries, it repeatedly tries to
warn you away: Are you sure you're
completely and entirely happy with
these selections before they are per
manently and irrevocably entered
into the database? You really want
this stuff to be saved? Positive?
Obviously the system is in need
of some sort of reform. No one
knows precisely what sort, but it is

generally agreed that the Draw
must be improved.
And that, presumably, is chief
among the issues University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper had in mind in
October when he created a task
force charged with examining hous
ing procedures. The task force is
scheduled to release its report at the
start of next month, and before it
does so it ought to gauge student
opinions on the Draw at this point
in the year, when all underclassmen
except graduating seniors have the
most to say about it.
Many students, for whatever rea
sons, attempt to think about the
Draw as little as possible except in
those few weeks surrounding the
lottery, and it is important that the
task force take advantage of these
few weeks of strong and widespread
student opinion on the topic — even
if that means delaying the report's
publication by a week or two. After
all, what the task force determines
about the Draw won't affect anyone
again until next May.
The task force, chaired by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldi'var, should hold
an open forum within the next few
days for students to vent their frus
trations to people in a position to do
something about them.
Let the task force know what you
think about how to make the Draw
better. In addition to Saldi'var and
some faculty and staff members,
three students are on the task force
— ostensibly to advance your inter
ests. So let them know what your
interests are. Sophomore Paul Bod
nar's e-mail address is bodnar
@leland.stanford.edu. Senior Alex
Breen can be contacted at alxbreen
@leland. And senior Meghvi Ma
heta's address is meghvi@leland.
As the three people selected to
represent the students, it is their
responsibility to listen to your views
on the issues they're examining.
And, as chair of a task force that
may profoundly affect students'
lives at Stanford, it's Saldivar's
responsibility as well. His e-mail
address is saldivar(o>leland.
