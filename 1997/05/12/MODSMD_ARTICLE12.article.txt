Some cannot pledge allegiance to complicit nation

I FOUND JOCELYN Wiener's most
recent column "Without a land to
call home" very disturbing. While
her analysis of the conflicts in El Sal
vador is accurate, her allegiance and
identification with the same nation she
criticizes is disheartening.
I agree with her that U.S. immigration
policies as they relate to Central Ameri
cans vs. Cubans has been very imbal
anced. I also agree with her that the

United States is culpable for training El
Salvador's military leaders at the School
of the Americas. And because of reasons
like these, I do not identify or pledge my
allegiance to the United States.
Wiener, however, chooses to do so. In
her column, she uses "we" four times in
reference to U.S. actions in Central
America. By using "we" she tolerates
these actions and makes them her own.
Like many other "progressive liberals"

(a3 such people like to trick themselves
into believing they are), the contradic
tion of her words and her personal devo
tions corrupts her alleged political
stance.
One cannot claim to identify with the
oppressed and the oppressor. You either
believe fully in the cause of the poor and
oppressed in El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala or you support the United
States' involvement in these countries.

Wiener and other liberals must see that
there is no middle ground in these
issues. If Wiener is so disturbed by the
thousands of displaced refugees that
have come to the United States and the
thousands more dead in El Salvador,
than how can she "say the pledge of alio
giance every day"? I have not been able
to say the pledge in years.
