## The
						law's view on families 
### 
MY MOTHER USED to give me a
present on Mother's Day.
"Because you made me a moth
er," she would explain. For us, the holi
day is about more than mother and child
as individuals; it is about the mother
child relationship itsolf.
This week, the mother-child relation
ship looms large in the political land
scape: The California Supreme Court is
hearing a case about the never-enforced
law that requires women under 18 who
seek abortions to notify a parent or judge.
It never ceases to amaze me that abortion
laws are not about fetuses. In most cases,
the laws are about women, about
restricting freedom and opportunity for a
class of individuals. In the case of
parental notification, the laws are about
a judicially mandated vision of families.
I spend a fair amount of time thinking
about abortion, namely because I happen
to be in possession of a body with the
built-in capacity for accidental pregnan
cy. And I have come to the conclusion
that, like most Americans, I support
abortion rights.
However, much of America and I part
company when we talk of parental notifi
cation laws. These are popular laws and
for good reason. They supply us with the
notion that families are loving, open,
communicative. It is a warm, appealing
version of family life and who among us
would not like to think it is true?
And for how many of us, is it actually

true? Tolstoy may have said that unhap
py families were different in their own
ways, but certain tragedies appear alto
gether common in the familial landscape:
alcoholism, drug abuse, incest and physi
cal, sexual and emotional violence.
Parental notification laws cannot legis
late these problems out of existence, can
not erase what families are by encoding
what families ought to be.
Even happy, loving families have com
munication gaps and nowhere are these
gaps more present than in talking about
sex. Abortion-rights advocates often
point to the case of Becky Bell, the 17-
year-old from Indiana who bled to death
from an illegal abortion she had because
she did not want her parents to be disap
pointed in their pregnant daughter. She
feared neither her parents' wrath nor
abuse, only their disapproval. Which is a
powerful thing under most circum
stances, but looms even larger if you are
bright and popular, college-bound and
pregnant.
At 22, I would tell my mother in an
instant if I needed an abortion. But in
high school, when I stood outside of
Planned Parenthood clinics with my
mother, trying to keep them open for
other women, I do not know I could have
told her if I had needed to claim my Roe
vs. Wade rights for myself. She would
never have hit me. I don't even know if
she would have yelled. But I would have
had to look at her every day, believing I

had failed in some colossal way to listen
to her teachings on responsibility and
intelligence and common sense.
Anyone who is close to a parent will
tell you that parental disappointment is
much harder to bear than anger is, sim
ply because it is like failing a part of your
self. My mother and I have the same fea
tures. We sound alike on the phone. We
both like "I Love Lucy" and dislike mush
rooms. The space between us sometimes
seems negligible. But sometimes it seems
enormous. We negotiate through the dif
ferences carefully: This is who I am; this
is who you are. Our recognition comes
from time and trust; it is learned, not leg
islated.
The columnist Anna Quindlen once
wrote that parental notification codified
the notion, "If she has nothing to tell me,
it means she has nothing to tell." But
teenage girls often have much to tell,
whether they be tales of parental abuses
or tales of parental illusions. The prob
lem is that there are few people who want
to hear.
This week, we will see if the court is
willing to listen.

Ten Stein, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, wanted her moth
er to write this part, but she couldn't
think of anything clever to say.
