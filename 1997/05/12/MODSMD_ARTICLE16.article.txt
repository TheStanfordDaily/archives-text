# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Learning to treat your mother as a best friend 
### 
"A boy's best friend is his mother."
— Anthony Perkins,
"Psycho"(l96o)

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Mom. Oh, and
Happy Mother's Day, too. If the
flowers didn't get there in time,
maybe this copy of The Daily will.
Yes, today is my mother's birthday
(she's, uh, 39). That means that yester
day was Mother's Day, while today is my
mother's day. (Aww, how sweet.) When I
was little I thought that the people who
ran such holidays (Hallmark, FTD, etc.)
had planned it that way for her. But
since I've been away from home, the
coinciding of the days has just made it
twice as easy for me to inadvertently for
get them both.
But this year I'm not forgetting, and I
want her and anyone else who reads this
to know that. Of course, I gave the florists
what I considered "plenty of time" and
what they considered "enough time for a
two-day rush with no guarantees," so

we'll see if I'm still in trouble or not. (Oh,
and Dad — if the flowers are there by the
time you print this out for Mom, be a pal
and just delete this part, will you?)
No, your name certainly doesn't have
to be Sigmund Freud for you to realize
that it's a very special relationship that
develops between a son and his mother.
That's especially true for me since, as an
only child, I am my mother's only son (and
she, I suppose, is my only mother). For the
first part of my life, she was really my only
female friend, unless you count Jenny
Wiezorek, but I only liked her because she
had Intellivision at her house.
And through it all, I suppose my mom
has remained a best friend, even though I
all too rarely treat her like one. While I
was still growing up (as recently as this
week), I could always look to my mom as
my last line of defense. The person who, if
and when the, you know, stuff hit the fan,
would always bail me out now and ask
questions later.
"Please excuse Victor for being late this

morning. He woke up with a headache."
When I was little, I don't think 1 even
noticed all the things she did for me. In
the winters, she would type up my grade
school writing projects for me (this was
back in the day when I still made rough
drafts). In the summers, she would drive
me to nature camp each day for my own
enrichment. She would calmly and coolly
freak out each time I brought home
another baby mouse to save it from
"Cora," the nature camp's menacing coral
snake. On Sundays, she made me pan
cakes shaped like Mickey Mouse.
"Please excuse Victor from soccer prac
tice today. His stomach hurts and also he
forgot his shin guards."
As I got older, I was aware but didn't
care. I followed standard teenager proce
dure for cultivating the child-parent rela
tionship by accentuating the negatives
and disregarding the parents. I remember
one night when I called home from a party
to bitch and moan my way out of a curfew,
only to find that what I really wanted to

do was go home and go to bed. It was only
as I approached college that I finally con
sciously accepted my mother in her role as
adviser and realized how important it is to
have someone who is always there.
"Please excuse Victor for his less-than
stellar showing on the AP calculus test.
He was told there would be no math on
the exam. Also, he woke up with a
headache."
On a day like this, therefore, it is
meaningful to remember the woman who
cared for me and shaped me into the mod
erately well-dressed young man that I am
today. I owe tribute to the woman who
would never take "but 1 just showered
Tuesday!" for an answer and who
wouldn't let me watch too much "Dukes
of Hazzard" lest I grow up to drive like
that. Indeed, I am in great debt to the one
who did her best for as long as she could
to protect me from the evils of the world,
including Ryan Jensen, the kid two blocks
over who was always wanting to go
spelunking in the sewers.

And so I want to try to speak now on
behalf of all the young men out there who
have had an off-day or two as a son (you
know who you are — don't make me name
names!) and just say that our silence never
meant that we didn't care. As the day
looms closer and closer when my parents
can finally rent out my part of the nest, 1
guess I find it more and more important to
get that sentiment out publicly.
So, once again, happy birthday, Mom. I
love you and thank you for everything.
And I think you know what I mean, and I
think you feel the sincerity and love with
which I mean it, when I say this:
I'm really sorry I didn't call more
often.

Victor Wishna, a senior majoring in psy
chology, anticipates that his father, very
rightfully so, will expect his own column
next month.
