## Softball finishes season with wins Team passed over for postseason 
### Ryan Chavez Contributing writer 
Stanford's Softball team
enjoyed a strong performance
this weekend to close the season,
going 3-1 against Oregon and
Oregon State. The Cardinal (31-
27-1, 10-18 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was not selected to partici
pate in NCAA regionals despite a
strong finish that allowed Stan
ford to place ahead of regional
bound No. 14 Arizona State (31-
23, 9-19) in the Pac-10 stand
ings.
Stanford's weekend began
with Saturday games against
Oregon (24-35-1, 9-19) in
Eugene, where in game one the
Cardinal suffered its only set
back.
The Ducks exploded for four
runs in the third inning off dou
bles by pitcher Jennie Cook (14-
19) and pinch hitter Allison
Nihei. Defending Pac-10 pitcher
of the week Becky Blevins (14-
16) went the distance for Stan
ford. The sophomore allowed
seven hits and five earned runs
with four walks and five strike
outs.
Offensively, Stanford was
held to only four hits in the
game, and the team was not able
to convert any of its nine
baserunners into runs.
"Before game one the team
was pressing a bit," said fresh
man catcher Kellie Wiginton.
"They might have come out
tight."
Head coach John Rittman
tried to get the offense going by
activating junior Laura Gillman
and senior Katie Beattie as
pinch hitters during different
points in the game.
"After game one Coach pulled
us aside and told us to focus on
the individual game and not nec
essarily the postseason," Wigin
ton said. "That seemed to help
us."
The Cardinal was unable to
get on track in game one, howev
er, and the final score was 5-0.
In game two, Stanford was
the team to strike early. In the
first inning Stanford put togeth
er a string of hits by senior lead
off hitter and third baseman
Amanda Renteria, Wiginton,
sophomore pitcher Marcy
Crouch and sophomore outfield
er Michelle Acosta to score four
runs and obtain the lead for
good.
Crouch (15-11) had a superb
outing on the mound and at the
plate. The Stanford star pitched
all seven innings and allowed
only one run to score in acquir
ing the victory.
Offensively Crouch was a

huge contributor, hitting two
doubles in her 3-for-3 perfor
mance. The whole team had a
great game, combining for 13
hits and seven runs in the 7-1
win.
Yesterday's games against the
last-place Beavers (29-34-1, 6-
21) marked a strong finish to a
successful season. In game one,
Stanford scored three runs in
the third inning as a base hit by
Wiginton and sacrifice flies by
Crouch and sophomore short
stop Michelle Schneider brought
around sophomore left fielder
Dawn Kobata, sophomore sec
ond baseman Jennie Foyle and
Renteria.
The three runs were all the
support Blevins needed. Shewas
close to untouchable in the
game, at one point retiring 17
consecutive batters. She was on
the top of her game, getting six
strikeouts and pitching the
shutout.
Blevins ended the season with
a 15-16 record, a misleading fig
ure considering she had to con
sistently pitch against the best
teams in the country and many
of her games were one-run loss
es.
The Cardinal's final game of
the season was a real nail-biter,
ending in a 1-0 victory. Acosta's
RBI single in the fourth inning
drove in the lone run. Crouch
got the victory for Stanford,
improving her final record to 16-
11.
At 6 p.m. the NCAA announced
the teams that would advance to
the regionals. After a solid week
end, Stanford was hoping to be on
the list of qualifiers.
Stanford had made a strong
move toward earning a bid by hav
ing an excellent final third of the
season, beating ranked teams
such as UCLA, Arizona State and
Washington. The Sun Devils, on
the other hand, lost 16 of their
last 19 games, including a 10-
game losing streak and a disas
trous sweep at the hands of the
Beavers in Tempe.
But the Sun Devils took three
of four against Stanford in early
March and earned the nod. Five
teams from the Pac-10 will move
on to regional competition: Ari
zona, UCLA (which appealed
recent postseason sanctions that
would have kept the Bruins out),
Washington, California and Ari
zona State.
A large part of any subjective
selection process is political, and
the fact that Arizona State and
many of the other teams that
made it had been ranked most of
the season while Stanford had
