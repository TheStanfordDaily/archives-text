# Baseball edges UCLA for 7th title
## Kilburg has five hits in finale 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
A flair for the dramatic.
In thrilling fashion this week
end, the No. 2 Stanford baseball
team (38-16, 21-9 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
took one of three games from No.
6 UCLA (40-17-1, 19-11) and
won the Six-Pac title.
The Card will face Washing
ton (41-17, 20-4 Pac-10 North) in
a best-of-three series beginning
Thursday to crown the Pac-10
champion. The winner will
receive an automatic bid to the
NCAA regionals.
The Bruins fought all week
end for the title — they needed to
sweep Stanford to clinch. As
UCLA took both the Friday and
Saturday games at Jackie Robin
son Stadium, the winner of yes
terday's game would be the Six-
Pac champion as UCLA held the
tiebreaker by winning the season
series against the Cardinal. Stan
ford led the league the entire sea
son but was in danger of losing
the title in the final game.
A loss would mean depleted
confidence entering the postsea
son on a four-game losing streak,
no games for 10 days and possi
bly losing a top regional seed.
While the Bruins raced to big
early leads both Friday and Sat
urday, Stanford won yesterday's
battle 9-6. Led by an excellent
outing from sophomore starting
pitcher Chad Hutchinson (6-3),
Stanford never trailed.
Sophomore second baseman
Tony Schrager set the tone for
the game, driving the second
pitch of the day from UCLA's
Tom Jacquez (9-3) over the left
field fence. Jacquez, ace
of late who entered the game
with a sparkling 2.60 FRA, suf
fered the loss as the Cardinal
punished him all day. He allowed
six runs on nine hits in 5 2/3
innings.
Following Schrager's home
run, junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer, the fourth batter to face
Jacquez, also bombed a home
run way over the center-field
fence. Schaeffer extended his hit
ting streak to 16 games and has
homered nine times in the last 12
games.
Junior right fielder Joe Kil
burg led the Cardinal the rest of
the way after being dropped to
the No. 8 spot in the batting
order for the first time this week
end. He put on a hitting clinic,
going 5-for-5 with three RBIs.
Kilburg was one triple short of
hitting for the cycle and finished
the day with a single, three dou
bles and his seventh home run.
Going into this weekend, Kil
burg's status was unsure, as he
had suffered a broken toe the

previous Friday against Arizona
and sat out the last three games.
"It was an unbelievable day
for Kilburg," said sophomore
closer Tony Cogan on KZSU. "It
was nice to have him back in the
lineup."
Sophomore third baseman
Josh Hochgesang also had three
hits for the Card, including his
third home run of the series and
13th of the year. Hochgesang
was Stanford's most consistent
hitter on the weekend with eight
hits and seven RBIs.
Although Stanford went up
early and never trailed, the Bru
ins never gave up. UCLA got no
closer than three runs, but its
potent offense made it a threat
every inning. Hutchinson and
Cogan pitched out of several
jams, with timely strikeouts and
intelligent pitching leading to
success.
With a five-run lead going into
the ninth, Stanford seemed to
have the game wrapped up. How
ever, the excitement of the pend
ing championship caused a few
jitters for the Cardinal. Bruin
senior Jon Heinrichs reached
base on an error by Hochgesang,
and Eric Byrnes followed with a
two-run home run off Cogan,
who earned his fourth save.
Bruin star Troy Glaus
reached base on junior shortstop
Jay Pecci's fielding error, bring
ing to the plate Eric Valent, the
hero in Friday night's game
when he hit the game-winning
home run off Cogan in the bot
tom of the ninth.
This time Cogan was victori
ous, coaxing Valent to fly out.
Sophomore Jody Gerut made the
final putout of the game on a fly
to center field by Peter Zamora.
The game provided a sweet
finish to an otherwise disap
pointing weekend that began Fri
day with a tough loss to the Bru
ins in a true heartbreaker.
The Bruins took an early one
run lead and then scored seven
runs off junior Stanford ace Kyle
Peterson in a huge fifth inning.
With the conference title on
the line, Stanford battled back
with six runs in the top of the
next inning and two in the sev
enth to tie the game. UCLA came
back with one in the bottom of
the eighth, and Stanford again
tied the game in the top of the
ninth on a pinch home run by
freshman Edmund Muth off
UCLA closer Jake Meyer (3-2).
With the score 9-9 and Cogan
on the mound, Stanford's hopes
for the conference title were on
the line. Cogan got one out but
then allowed Valent's game win
ning solo shot, his 21st home
run of the season. The loss

dropped Cogan's record to 7-3.
Saturday's game saw the Bru
ins beat the Cardinal handily 13-
8. Sophomore Stanford starter
Brent Hoard lasted only 1 1/3
innings, allowing Five early runs
for the Bruins, including a grand
slam by Byrnes.
UCLA never looked back.
Hoard suffered the loss, falling

had suffered a broken toe the

previous Friday against Arizona
and sat out the last three games.
"It was an unbelievable day
for Kilburg," said sophomore
closer Tony Cogan on KZSU. "It
was nice to have him back in the
lineup."
Sophomore third baseman
Josh Hochgesang also had three
hits for the Card, including his
third home run of the series and
13th of the year. Hochgesang
was Stanford's most consistent
hitter on the weekend with eight
hits and seven RBIs.
Although Stanford went up
early and never trailed, the Bru
ins never gave up. UCLA got no
closer than three runs, but its
potent offense made it a threat
every inning. Hutchinson and
Cogan pitched out of several
jams, with timely strikeouts and
intelligent pitching leading to
success.
With a five-run lead going into
the ninth, Stanford seemed to
have the game wrapped up. How
ever, the excitement of the pend
ing championship caused a few
jitters for the Cardinal. Bruin
senior Jon Heinrichs reached
base on an error by Hochgesang,
and Eric Byrnes followed with a
two-run home run off Cogan,
who earned his fourth save.
Bruin star Troy Glaus
reached base on junior shortstop
Jay Pecci's fielding error, bring
ing to the plate Eric Valent, the
hero in Friday night's game
when he hit the game-winning
home run off Cogan in the bot
tom of the ninth.
This time Cogan was victori
ous, coaxing Valent to fly out.
Sophomore Jody Gerut made the
final putout of the game on a fly
to center field by Peter Zamora.
The game provided a sweet
finish to an otherwise disap
pointing weekend that began Fri
day with a tough loss to the Bru
ins in a true heartbreaker.
The Bruins took an early one
run lead and then scored seven
runs off junior Stanford ace Kyle
Peterson in a huge fifth inning.
With the conference title on
the line, Stanford battled back
with six runs in the top of the
next inning and two in the sev
enth to tie the game. UCLA came
back with one in the bottom of
the eighth, and Stanford again
tied the game in the top of the
ninth on a pinch home run by
freshman Edmund Muth off
UCLA closer Jake Meyer (3-2).
With the score 9-9 and Cogan
on the mound, Stanford's hopes
for the conference title were on
the line. Cogan got one out but
then allowed Valent's game win
ning solo shot, his 21st home
run of the season. The loss

A flair for the dramatic.
In thrilling fashion this week
end, the No. 2 Stanford baseball
team (38-16, 21-9 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
took one of three games from No.
6 UCLA (40-17-1, 19-11) and
won the Six-Pac title.
The Card will face Washing
ton (41-17, 20-4 Pac-10 North) in
a best-of-three series beginning
Thursday to crown the Pac-10
champion. The winner will
receive an automatic bid to the
NCAA regionals.
The Bruins fought all week
end for the title — they needed to
sweep Stanford to clinch. As
UCLA took both the Friday and
Saturday games at Jackie Robin
son Stadium, the winner of yes
terday's game would be the Six-
Pac champion as UCLA held the
tiebreaker by winning the season
series against the Cardinal. Stan
ford led the league the entire sea
son but was in danger of losing
the title in the final game.
A loss would mean depleted
confidence entering the postsea
son on a four-game losing streak,
no games for 10 days and possi
bly losing a top regional seed.
While the Bruins raced to big
early leads both Friday and Sat
urday, Stanford won yesterday's
battle 9-6. Led by an excellent
outing from sophomore starting
pitcher Chad Hutchinson (6-3),
Stanford never trailed.
Sophomore second baseman
Tony Schrager set the tone for
the game, driving the second
pitch of the day from UCLA's
Tom Jacquez (9-3) over the left
field fence. Jacquez, ace
of late who entered the game
with a sparkling 2.60 FRA, suf
fered the loss as the Cardinal
punished him all day. He allowed
six runs on nine hits in 5 2/3
innings.
Following Schrager's home
run, junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer, the fourth batter to face
Jacquez, also bombed a home
run way over the center-field
fence. Schaeffer extended his hit
ting streak to 16 games and has
homered nine times in the last 12
games.
Junior right fielder Joe Kil
burg led the Cardinal the rest of
the way after being dropped to
the No. 8 spot in the batting
order for the first time this week
end. He put on a hitting clinic,
going 5-for-5 with three RBIs.
Kilburg was one triple short of
hitting for the cycle and finished
the day with a single, three dou
bles and his seventh home run.
Going into this weekend, Kil
burg's status was unsure, as he
had suffered a broken toe the

previous Friday against Arizona
and sat out the last three games.
"It was an unbelievable day
for Kilburg," said sophomore
closer Tony Cogan on KZSU. "It
