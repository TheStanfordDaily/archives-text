# Golfers fall to third at regional
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
It was a close run for the Car
dinal at the NCAA West Region
als this weekend, but not close
enough.
Despite leading the pack in
the first two rounds, the Stan
ford women's golf team fell to
third place on the final round
Saturday.
Stanford started with a two
stroke lead (1-under-par 287) on
the first day and held on to its
first-place spot after a 3-under
par 285 in the second round,
clinging to a one stroke lead over
second-place Arizona State. But
while the Cardinal players shot
solid scores on the first two
rounds, all of the scores went up
significantly the final day.
"It was more because of the
poor weather conditions, not
because of their physical and
mental state," said head coach
Caroline O'Connor.
The top three team scores
were merely a few strokes apart.
Stanford was five strokes shy of
first-place Arizona State's 865.
Arizona, who hosted the tourna
ment, placed second with 866.
Top-ranked San Jose State fin
ished a surprising fifth (884), a
gaping 19 strokes behind the
Sun Devils. New Mexico State
finished fourth with a score of
883.
The 54-hole tournament was
held at the 6,012-yard, par-72
Randolph Park North Golf
Course.
In team golf, where the top
four players' scores are totaled,
"five strokes for a team total
after one round is nothing,

O'Connor said. "Five strokes
after three rounds is even more
than nothing,
"Our goal was to position our
selves in the top three, and
that's what we did."
Senior co-captain Andrea
Baxter, who finished seventh on
both days after the first two
rounds, carded her way into a
second-place tie with a 4-under
par 212 (72-69-71), just one
stroke behind the winner, Wash
ington's Dodie Mazzuca. At one
point, Baxter catapulted to 4-
under-par on the back nine dur
ing the third round. She shot
her lowest score this season, 3-
under-par 69, in the second
round.
Baxter's strong, consistent
scores are reminiscent of her
first-place finish at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational, a presea
son tournament, where she blis
tered the course with a 3-under
par 213 finish (76-69-68).
Although Baxter suffered a
wrist injury and sat out for the
majority of the season, she
adjusted quickly to build her
mental endurance back to a
competitive level.
Senior co-captain Mhairi
McKay tied for eighth with Ari
zona's Marisa Baena, the 1996
NCAA individual champion,
with a 2-under-par 214 finish.
McKay was in first place going
into the third round with scores
of 70 and 68 for the first two
rounds, but she shot a 4-over
par 76 on the last day.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro (74-
74- 78) tied teammate Julie
Dunn for a 42nd-place finish at
