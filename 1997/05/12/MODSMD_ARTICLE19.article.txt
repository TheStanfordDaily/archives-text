# Golfers fall to third at regional
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
It was a close run for the Car
dinal at the NCAA West Region
als this weekend, but not close
enough.
Despite leading the pack in
the first two rounds, the Stan
ford women's golf team fell to
third place on the final round
Saturday.
Stanford started with a two
stroke lead (1-under-par 287) on
the first day and held on to its
first-place spot after a 3-under
par 285 in the second round,
clinging to a one stroke lead over
second-place Arizona State. But
while the Cardinal players shot
solid scores on the first two
rounds, all of the scores went up
significantly the final day.
"It was more because of the
poor weather conditions, not
because of their physical and
mental state," said head coach
Caroline O'Connor.
The top three team scores
were merely a few strokes apart.
Stanford was five strokes shy of
first-place Arizona State's 865.
Arizona, who hosted the tourna
ment, placed second with 866.
Top-ranked San Jose State fin
ished a surprising fifth (884), a
gaping 19 strokes behind the
Sun Devils. New Mexico State
finished fourth with a score of
883.
The 54-hole tournament was
held at the 6,012-yard, par-72
Randolph Park North Golf
Course.
In team golf, where the top
four players' scores are totaled,
"five strokes for a team total
after one round is nothing,

O'Connor said. "Five strokes
after three rounds is even more
than nothing,
"Our goal was to position our
selves in the top three, and
that's what we did."
Senior co-captain Andrea
Baxter, who finished seventh on
both days after the first two
rounds, carded her way into a
second-place tie with a 4-under
par 212 (72-69-71), just one
stroke behind the winner, Wash
ington's Dodie Mazzuca. At one
point, Baxter catapulted to 4-
under-par on the back nine dur
ing the third round. She shot
her lowest score this season, 3-
under-par 69, in the second
round.
Baxter's strong, consistent
scores are reminiscent of her
first-place finish at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational, a presea
son tournament, where she blis
tered the course with a 3-under
par 213 finish (76-69-68).
Although Baxter suffered a
wrist injury and sat out for the
majority of the season, she
adjusted quickly to build her
mental endurance back to a
competitive level.
Senior co-captain Mhairi
McKay tied for eighth with Ari
zona's Marisa Baena, the 1996
NCAA individual champion,
with a 2-under-par 214 finish.
McKay was in first place going
into the third round with scores
of 70 and 68 for the first two
rounds, but she shot a 4-over
par 76 on the last day.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro (74-
74- 78) tied teammate Julie
Dunn for a 42nd-place finish at

the NCAA West Regional.
10-over-par 226. Ro shot a
superb front nine with a 3-
under-par during her second
round.
Dunn posted a 1-over-par 73
in the first round but ballooned
to an 8-over-par 80 on the sec
ond round. She played with a
sprained ankle after she tripped
over a grass hole on the 10th
hole during the second round.
"I had a little trouble on
those last eight holes," Dunn
said.
Dunn shook off her sprained
ankle on the last day to get her
ball up and down the fairways
for a 1-over-par 73 finish. On
the par-4 14th, she drove her
ball to the left-center of the fair
way, putting her in perfect posi

tion to par the hole.
Dunn almost eagled the par
-5 third on her final round. She
fired her approach shot using a
3-wood onto the green.
"I almost made the putt," she
said. "It had a good speed, but
the green didn't break so it
rolled a couple inches. If only it
broke."
Dunn settled for an impres
sive birdie on the par-5 hole.
The bad weather conditions on
the final day did not affect
Dunn's scoring performance but
did unnerve other players.
Swinging a metal club on an
open fairway during a lightning
storm was not exactly an ideal
playing condition for sophomore
Michelle Sperry, who drawled
out a 7-over-par 79 on her final
round.
Sperry otherwise posted an
impressive finish with 9-over
par 225 to tie for 39th place,

shooting an even-par 72 during
the first round and a 2-over-par
74 on her second.
"Michelle really hit the ball
great, but her putts just weren't
dropping on the last round,"
O'Connor said.
"The greens rolled slower,
and the pin positions during the
final day were noticeably more
difficult than the first two
rounds," O'Connor said.
"Slower greens mean players
can be more aggressive with
their putting, but the Stanford
team, whose practice greens run
quick, had a difficult time
adjusting to the Tucson greens,"
she said.
O'Connor said she was
pleased with how the team
played. With the start of the
NCAA tournament next week,
she said, "If each of our players
plays to their potential, no one
can beat us."
