# Recognizing hate
## LGB community members participate in response workshop 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Eight members of the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual community met in a workshop on Satur
day to discuss issues of hate violence and ways to
respond.
Organized by the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, the workshop came in the
wake of a number of recent homophobic inci
dents, including graffiti and derogatory com
ments.
"The whole theme was to be much more or
ganized in our response," said fresh man Nick

Kelley, who attended the workshop.
The LGBCC hoped to facilitate discussion in
how to respond to day-to-day harassment.
Jennifer Rakowski, hate violence project co
ordinator of the Palo Alto-based Communities
United Against Violence, led the discussion. The
focus of the workshop was to help students "un
derstand the basics of violence and formulate a
community response," Rakowski said.
"One thing for the individual to remember
is that there are a lot of different [sources of]
support out there — not just to look to the
campus or law enforcement," she said. "Peo
ple need to not be afraid to name something as

hate violence."
The students discussed several issues, rang
ing from definitions of terminology to hypothet
ical scenarios of violence.
"I had to question my own terms of what ho
mophobia and hate crime were," said Kelley.
"It's too bad that people are left in the closet be
cause [they're! afraid to be a victim.
Sophomore Patrick Dominguez said the
workshop helped clarify "what constitutes a
hate crime" and how to recognize and report
one.
"The workshop made [me]
aware of a lot of deterrents that
keep people from seeking help, be
cause they're not sure it is a hate
crime," Dominguez said.
Dominguez said one suggestion
brought up by the workshop was to

form a student response team to
deal with homophobic incidents.
According to freshman Elly
Matsumura, "We discussed some
of the motives of hate crimes, some
of the forms that hate violence
takes and how best to respond at
the individual, community and in
stitutional levels."
Matsumura said one important
fact she learned through the work
shop was the definition of a "misde

meanor," an incident that incurs
less than the $5,000 worth of dam
age required to be considered a
felony.
"There doesn't have to be
$5,000 worth of damage for our
justice system to recognize the psy
chological damage" of hate vio
lence, Matsumura said.
"What the campus as a whole
and the administration need to do
is become aware of the reality of ho

mophobia and legitimize it — not
just brush it aside as, 'Oh, that was
just a joke. That was a mistake,' "
she added.
The main project the LGBCC is
currently working on, according to
Matsumura, is to obtain funding
for a permanent director at the cen
ter. Organizers are trying to ac
quire 1,000 signatures on a petition
and are planning to write a propos
al to the administration.
