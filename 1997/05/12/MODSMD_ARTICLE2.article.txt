# Recognizing hate
## LGB community members participate in response workshop 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Eight members of the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual community met in a workshop on Satur
day to discuss issues of hate violence and ways to
respond.
Organized by the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, the workshop came in the
wake of a number of recent homophobic inci
dents, including graffiti and derogatory com
ments.
"The whole theme was to be much more or
ganized in our response," said fresh man Nick

Kelley, who attended the workshop.
The LGBCC hoped to facilitate discussion in
how to respond to day-to-day harassment.
Jennifer Rakowski, hate violence project co
ordinator of the Palo Alto-based Communities
United Against Violence, led the discussion. The
focus of the workshop was to help students "un
derstand the basics of violence and formulate a
community response," Rakowski said.
"One thing for the individual to remember
is that there are a lot of different [sources of]
support out there â€” not just to look to the
campus or law enforcement," she said. "Peo
ple need to not be afraid to name something as

hate violence."
The students discussed several issues, rang
ing from definitions of terminology to hypothet
ical scenarios of violence.
"I had to question my own terms of what ho
mophobia and hate crime were," said Kelley.
"It's too bad that people are left in the closet be
cause [they're! afraid to be a victim.
Sophomore Patrick Dominguez said the
workshop helped clarify "what constitutes a
hate crime" and how to recognize and report
one.
