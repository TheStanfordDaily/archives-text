# Come one come all
## Women's tennis at Taube 
### 
To all of you who had to deal with the
annoying, pain-in-the-ass construction on
Campus Drive hy Arrillaga all year long, it
has come time to reap the benefits.
The building of the Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium i.s nearing completion, just in
time to host the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships which begin Thursday

morning. And as far as I am concerned,
there is no reason you shouldn't 1m; there.
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team is vying for its ninth NCAA title
under head coach Frank Hrennan and
looks as though it has its best ch.'ince in the
last few years to grab it.
For the 10th consecutive year, the Car
dinal ran over the Pacific 10 Conference,
annually the best league in college tennis.
Stanford won all 10 of its I'ac-10 dual
matches for the third consecutive season.
Overall, the Cardinal boasts a 2(>-l record.
I lere are just a few of the reasons you
should be there:
1. Stanford currently has four NCAA
titles this year thanks to men's and
women's cross country and men's and
women's volleyball. The record for most
titles in an academic year is five, held by
both Stanford and UCLA. With men's and
women's tennis both entering their respec
tive stretch runs for titles, you may just
miss history in the making if you choose to

go to that horribly boring fiO-minute lec
ture.
2. The new stadium haa great karma. At
its inaugural match just throe weeks ago,
the Stanford men's tennis team sent a
major statement by upsetting IJCLA, a
front-runner for the championship. With
Ryan Wolters' match-clinching victory in
the top singles spot, the Cardinal certainly
showed the rest of the competition that it is
ready to begin defending its two consecu
tive titles. Of course, if you'd rather spend
your flay out of the sun in the 24-hour
study room at Meyer than witnessing this
drama, be my guest.
3. This is not your grandmother's ten
nis we are talking about. College tennis is
not a game characterized by silent, turning
heads. In Ixitween points, heckling, cheer
ing, harassing and what-not are all well
within the rules.
I cite an example. Last season against
USC at home, Cardinal fans jeered an
opposing singles player. She w;is so shaken
that by the end of the match, she blasted
tennis balls off her racket into t he crowd at
the bothersome "noise."
This is just the kind of effort the Cardi
nal is looking for from u Personally, after
eight NCAA crowns, ID l'ac-10 titles, 34
straight conference wins and a two-year
winning streak at home, this is just the
kind of effort the Cardinal deserves from
us.
4 Home-court advantage. Last year at
the NCAA Championships in Tallahasee,
in a matchup between the No. 1 and No. 2
teams in the nation, the top-ranked Florida
Gators defeated the Cardinal 5-2 in the
finals behind hundreds of raucous Gator
fans who had made the short trip up north.
Ironically enough, it is this same Gator
