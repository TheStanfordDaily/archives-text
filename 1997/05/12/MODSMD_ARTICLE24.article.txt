### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
California Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante
stressed the importance of education, hard work and
diversity in a speech at the Law School Friday after
noon.
A crowd of about 150 assembled to hear Busta
mante, the first Chicano speaker of the California As
sembly.
The youngest of six children, Bustamante was
born in the small Northern California town of Yuba
in 1953. After being raised in Fresno and attending
the California State University branch there, Busta
mante performed extensive community service be
fore being elected to the California State Assembly in
1991.
Bustamante's pride in his childhood was reflected
in his ideas concerning society and the importance of
discipline.
"It took a lot of hard work to get where I am
today," Bustamante said. "Work hard, and things
will come.
"Nothing's for free; there is responsibility," he

added.
Hard work alone, however, is not enough to be
come successful, Bustamante stressed.
"None of you are going to do it by yourselves, no
matter how good you are," Bustamante said. "What
you see before you is a composite of, among many
things, teachers and student activists."
Education is especially important, Bustamante
said. He identified the high dropout rate among
teenagers in high school, especially in the Chicano /
Latino population, and said he saw it as a major issue.
"People deserve.. . good schools," he said. "Every
talented child who can go to college should go to col
lege."
Bustamante also emphasized the importance of di
versity, calling the 21st century the "diversity centu
ry." This new era will be highlighted by more com
mon decency and less prejudice, he said.
"Diversity beats division," Bustamante said. He
added that society should strive to "increase and cel
ebrate diversity."
Bustamante argued that the "sleeping giant" of in
creasing numbers of minorities has already and will
continue to have a profound impact on society.
