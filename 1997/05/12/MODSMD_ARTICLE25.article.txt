# Fire breaks out in laundry room of Bob
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Carolyn Sleeth Staff writers 
Towels in a dryer in the laundry room of Bob
caught on fire last night at about 9:20.
The fire spread outside the dryer but was
put out before it caused much damage. Be
cause the fire was not hot enough — 160 de
grees — to set off the sprinkler system, a stu

dent who saw the flames, sophomore Dan
Geyser, pulled the fire alarm to call the fire de
partment.
Three fires trucks and two police cars came
to the scene. The portion of Mayfield Avenue
from Xanadu to Bob was closed off for about 20
minutes.
"The residents did the right thing," said Stan
ford Fire Capt. Lee Leonard. He said that by clos
ing the door to the laundry room, the residents

prevented the fire from going any further.
"The only damage was to the dryer and to
the paint in the room," Leonard said. "But it
wasn't a dangerous fire."
To put the fire out, the fire fighters used
hoses and blew out the smoke with a fan. "It
was a quick attack," said one fire fighter, Char
lotte Strong. It took about three minutes to put
out the entire fire, she said.
No one was injured.
