# Wet Feet Press helps student job seekers
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Students stressed about finding a job next
year have an attractive alternative to spending
fall quarter researching at the Career Planning
and Placement Center thanks to two alumni
from the Graduate School of Business.
Wet Feet Press — a World Wide Web-based
company that offers information for job seekers
— was created by Steve Pollock and Gary Alpert
in response to what they call the frustration and
humiliation of the corporate interviewing
process. Pollock and Alpert both graduated

from the Business School in 1993.
Striving to remain true to their corporate goal
— to provide job seekers with the information
they need to be successful in their job searches —
the company publishes reports on the industries
and the companies that top the list of college
graduates' wish lists.
Wet Feet Press Library includes research on
such industries as management consulting, in
vestment banking and venture capital.
The company also conducts extensive re
search on the leading firms within those indus
tries, including McKinsey & Co., Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Microsoft Corporation and The

Walt Disney Co.
By providing information about firms, Wot
Feet Press hopes to "level the playing field be
tween job candidates and companies," Pollock
said.
He said his company's research reports are
unlike corporate brochures.
"We write in ways that are interesting to stu
dents," Pollock said. "Corporate brochures all
sound alike, and we tell people what it's like to
work in a place."
Wet Feet Press implements a careful research
methodology to assure high quality
of content.
"We interview people inside the
company who are recent hires and
are not yet tainted by official
dogma," Pollock said. "They tell
you what it is like to work there,
their likes and dislikes and what
kind of people do well in the compa
ny culture.
"We also work with the compa
nies' recruiting staff, conduct li
brary and Internet research and
talk with industry experts about
their perspective on various firms,"
he added.
Aside from supplying the stu
dents with insights into firms and
industries, Wet Feet Press also
coaches students for the interview
process with guides such as "Ace the
Case" that take the element of sur
prise out of the often dreaded man
agement consulting interviews.
The company literature has re
ceived rave reviews from students.
"When you are competing
against students from the top 10
schools in the nation for positions
that are as competitive as consult
ing and investment banking, Wet
Feet Press gives you an edge that
you sometimes need," said senior

Ben Chuba, who was an intern for
the company.
While Wet Feet Press's materi
als are primarily targeted at stu
dents, "companies are also interest
ed in our research and the perspec
tive we have about the job market.
They want to know what students
are saying about their firm and how
they evaluate offers," Pollock said.
"A lot of companies buy our ma
terials to conduct competitive
bench marking," he added.
Although satisfied with its cur
rent progress, Wet Feet Press has
ambitious plans for the future.
"We are growing our content
and working on our Web presence.
Our Web site has a growing compa
ny gallery with profiles that firms
write in response to student ques
tions," Pollock said.
Pollock also expressed excite
ment about the new services Wet
Feet Press is beginning to offer.
"We recently released a report
on negotiating a job offer that in
cludes information on various com
ponents of job offers which stu
dents frequently find puzzling," he
said.
Wet Feet Press also plans to in
crease its on-campus presence at
top universities. The company in
vites students to stop by its booth
during Job Connection Day May 16
and to visit their Web site at
www.wetfeet.com.
