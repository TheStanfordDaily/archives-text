# Wet Feet Press helps student job seekers
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Students stressed about finding a job next
year have an attractive alternative to spending
fall quarter researching at the Career Planning
and Placement Center thanks to two alumni
from the Graduate School of Business.
Wet Feet Press — a World Wide Web-based
company that offers information for job seekers
— was created by Steve Pollock and Gary Alpert
in response to what they call the frustration and
humiliation of the corporate interviewing
process. Pollock and Alpert both graduated

from the Business School in 1993.
Striving to remain true to their corporate goal
— to provide job seekers with the information
they need to be successful in their job searches —
the company publishes reports on the industries
and the companies that top the list of college
graduates' wish lists.
Wet Feet Press Library includes research on
such industries as management consulting, in
vestment banking and venture capital.
The company also conducts extensive re
search on the leading firms within those indus
tries, including McKinsey & Co., Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Microsoft Corporation and The

Walt Disney Co.
By providing information about firms, Wot
Feet Press hopes to "level the playing field be
tween job candidates and companies," Pollock
said.
He said his company's research reports are
unlike corporate brochures.
"We write in ways that are interesting to stu
dents," Pollock said. "Corporate brochures all
sound alike, and we tell people what it's like to
work in a place."
Wet Feet Press implements a careful research
