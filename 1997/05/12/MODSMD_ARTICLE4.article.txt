# Attempts at addressing disability access thwarted
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
About 40 frequently used campus facilities were
decorated late Wednesday night and early Thursday
morning with fliers rating their accessibility to stu
dents with disabilities.
Students from the Stanford Civil Liberties Union
and Disabled Students at Stanford organized the flier
campaign to raise awareness of the problems of dis
ability access on campus.
"Our goal was to remind faculty members that
some of their offices aren't accessible, to remind stu
dents that some of their classrooms aren't accessible
and to make people start to become aware of the
many problems that exist at Stanford with regard to
access," said medical student Nathan Watson, the
union's chair.
The fliers rated buildings according to first-floor
access, other-floor access, Braille signs and the acces
sibility of restrooms. Many fliers were gone by early
Thursday morning, although organizers said they
did not know who had torn them down.
Students also submitted a petition — organized by
the Disability Awareness and Reform Team, another
student group — with more than 400 signatures to the
President's and Provost's Offices, asking the Univer
sity to implement immediate improvements. These
improvements included disabled access to all commu
nity centers, vertical wheelchair access in a number of
dorms, increased space between the stacks at Meyer
and Green libraries to accommodate wheelchairs,
Braille signs throughout campus facilities, blind-ac
cessible computers and hearing-aid compatible micro
phone systems in major lecture halls and auditoriums.
According the Nicole Walden, co-chair of the re
form team, the idea to rate campus buildings "sprang
from the fact that we had always wondered why there
was no map or listing [indicatingl which buildings
were accessible or not." Walden said such a map
would be very useful to the disabled community.
"It seems like the only thing that's going to mobi
lize any action is if enough concern is shown," said
freshman Hsien Hayward, who helped post fliers on

the buildings.
"I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward position be
cause I really want to believe that the administration
is doing all they can, and yet I'm faced with the reali
ty of not being able to get to my classrooms, to Mem
Aud, to Mem Chu — basically to about 70 percent of
campus," she said.
Sophomore Jessica Lehman, co-leader of Disabled
Students at Stanford, said she was frustrated by the
response to the flier campaign. Lehman said she re
ceived an anonymous phone call that criticized the
fliers in a "sarcastically nice" way.
"We just didn't get that much response and a lot of
what we did get was negative," Lehman said. "It
didn't seem like people understood what was going
on."
Watson said the SCLU's campaign was carried out
with the sanction of the Mid-Peninsula Chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
Paul Gilbert, chair of the chapter, said the ACLU
has "a resolution to support and coordinate the ef
forts lof the Stanford Civil Liberties Union]. . .toen
sure that Stanford is in compliance with the disabili
ties requirements.
"I think it's crucial that groups do push institu
tions to make sure that they're in compliance,"
Gilbert said, adding that it is his understanding,
based on Watson's reports to the board, that Stan
ford is not in compliance with the law. "Stanford ob
viously should have been in compliance all along."
Last month, Rosa Gonzalez, associate director of
the Office of Multicliltural Development and Stan
ford's compliance officer for the American with Dis
abilities Act, said University task forces are dis
cussing ways to improve disability access. The first
building to be renovated this summer will be the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Center.
Lehman acknowledged the administration's ef
forts to improve access but pointed out that actual
improvements were slow in coming.
"I'm really glad [the administration! isdoingwhat
they have. I'm not saying they're doing a terrible job,"
she said, "but I don't think Stanford is doing as much
to improve access . . . as they could and should be."
