# BGLAD week begins
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Today marks the beginning
of Bisexual, (Jay and Lesbian
Awareness Days, featuring a
two-week array of events cele
brating the gay community on
campus through revelry and re
flection. There are daily pro
grams and lectures, including
one given by award-winning
playwright Tony Kushner.
This year's BGLAD activi
ties revolve around a theme ti
tied "camp." According to
sophomore Brad Anderson, co
ordinator of BGLAD, camp "is a
celebration of exaggeration and
those practices that break the
continuity of social practices."
Through humor, camp encour
ages people to challenge the va
lidity of social roles that appear
"normal," Anderson said.
Organizers of BGLAD — an
event that has been a campus
tradition for 15 years — hope to
involve the campus in the spirit
of camp through activities such
as Spring Camp Stanford,
which encourages students to
break away from the typical
and entrenched forms of dress
and "encamp" White Plaza for

a day.
The gay community has long
embraced the camp perspec
tive, Anderson said. "Looking
from the outside at the institu
tions of morality, |eamp| is a
language that the queer com
munity can understand," he
said.
In addition to celebrating
the camp aspect of gay culture,
BGLAD includes many speak
ers and other events. Tonight
Taylor Klynn, West coast direc
tor of discrimination litigation
for the American Civil Liber
ties Union, will speak at Tresid
der Union. Klynn, a Stanford
alumna, will discuss her experi
ences litigating for the ACLU
in cases that were Hied against
California's Proposition 209
and others that fought for gay
marriage in Ilawaii.
Celebrations will continue
with a lecture by Kushner, au
thor of "Angels in America," as
well as a comedy night at the
Coffee House.
In past years, BGLAD has
functioned mainly to raise
awareness of the gay communi
ty and to act as a festival ofcele
bration of gay culture. This year's
program, however, "is a departure
in that we are trying to relate
queer identity to the Stanford
community," said Grace Pasigan,
graduate intern for the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
Organizers hope the festivities
will encourage healing after a
spate of homophobic events on
campus. These events include ho
mophobic graffiti at The Bollard
eating club in the Suites and the
alleged use of homophobic epi
thets at a Kappa Sigma and Euro
trash parties.
BGLAD will attempt to demon
strate that the challenges facing
the queer community are the same
as those facing any other margin
alized group, Anderson said.
According to BGLAD treasurer
Rich Chin, a doctoral student
"You don't need to know a lot of
queer history to come out to these
activities and have fun."
