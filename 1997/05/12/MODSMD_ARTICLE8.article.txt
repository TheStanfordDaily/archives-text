Kasparov loses
NEW YORK (AP) — In a dazzling, hourlong
game yesterday, the Deep Blue IBM computer
demolished world chess champion Garry Kas
parov and won the six-game chess match between
man and machine.
The final score was 3 1/2 points for the com
puter and 2 1/2 points for Kasparov. The 34-year
old Russian and the computer split the first two
games, then played to draws in Games 3, 4 and 5.
Kasparov resigned after the computer's 19th
move in Game 6. Visibly upset, he bolted from the
table, shrugging his shoulders.
At a news conference later, he lashed out at
IBM for programming the computer specifically
to beat him.
"It was nothing to do about science. ... It was
one zeal to beat Garry Kasparov," he said. "And

when a big corporation with unlimited resources
would like to do so, there are many ways to
achieve the result. And the result was achieved.
"I feel confident that the machine hasn't
proved anything yet," Kasparov added. "It's not
yet ready, in my opinion, to win a big contest."
Pope visits Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Preaching to a
half-million people in front of Beirut's war-shat
tered skyline, Pope John Paul II called yesterday
on Christians and Muslims to make peace in
"martyr Lebanon."
The last public event of the pontiffs two-day
trip here drew Christians from across the country
of 3.2 million, as well as from Syria and Jordan,
in what was the largest gathering ever in
Lebanon.
