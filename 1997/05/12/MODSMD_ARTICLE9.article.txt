## Relief agencies rush in as death toll climbs over 2,400 
### 
QAEN, Iran (AP) — Convoys of buses, trucks and
pickups rushed volunteers over narrow dirt roads of
northeastern Iran, where the death toll from a pow
erful earthquake reached 2,400 people — and was
still climbing.
About 130 aftershocks shook what was left stand
ing, forcing tens of thousands of people to camp
amid the rubble in the streets of stricken villages.
Forty-thousand people were left homeless.
Military aircraft flew food, clothes and medicine
to the area, and volunteers who arrived in convoys
dug through the rubble with bare hands to look for
bodies. Others handed out aid.
In most villages, streets had disappeared into
rows of rubble. Survivors beat their chests and
wailed in anguish. Others washed the bodies of their
loved ones and buried them in mass graves.

At least 6,000 people were injured in the magni
tude-?. 1 earthquake that struck Saturday near the
town of Qaen, 70 miles west of the Afghan border.
Most of the damage was in the 60-mile stretch
between Birjand and Qaen, a region dotted by poor
villages and mud huts. In one of the villages, an ele
mentary school collapsed, killing 110 girls and bury
ing their bodies under jagged slabs of concrete and
steel.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said at
least 2,000 people died in villages around Qaen, 394
in Birjand and two in Khavaf.
Iranian officials estimated the damage at $67 mil
lion and appealed for international aid.
From Tokyo, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
urged other countries "to respond promptly and
with generosity."
