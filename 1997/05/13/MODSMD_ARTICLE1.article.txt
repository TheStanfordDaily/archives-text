# Students discuss recent issues
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Recent on-campus hate crimes, the
tenure process and disability access
were among the issues that students
presented to an audience of about 30
administrators at this quarter's "Cook
ies and Tea" yesterday.
The forum, now in its second quar
ter, used a new format yesterday in
which students and administrators
split up into small groups after the pre
sentations to discuss specific issues
that had been raised.
This quarter's "Cookies and Tea"
was organized by freshman Kelly
Vaughan, juniors Shavon Givens and
Emily Johnson and sophomores
Christy Larson and Shanna Gazley.
Students gave updates on issues pre
viously raised at the forum and pre
sented new initiatives.
Senior Imran Maskatia expressed
his concern regarding the lack of class
es on Islamic studies at Stanford. Ac
cording to Maskatia, only one course at
Stanford discusses the Muslim religion
— History Prof. Joel Beinin's "Intro
duction to Islamic Studies."
"At this campus especially, where we
try to create a multicultural education
— which I think is very important — we
are lacking in the area of Islamic stud
ies," Maskatia said.
Senior Ally Field presented plans to
speak to administrators about issues of
corporate responsibility regarding the
appointment of members on the Board
of Trustees.
Field called for student involvement
in the selection of members of the board
and a process by which potential board
members could be screened to see if
their involvement in organizations out
side of the University conflict with
Stanford's policies on investment re
sponsibility.
Junior Aly Remtulla, spokesman for
Undergraduates for the Tenure of

Akhil Gupta, voiced his disappointment
with recent developments in the Gupta
tenure case. Gupta, an assistant profes
sor of anthropology, was denied tenure
earlier this year despite unanimous fac
ulty support.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven recently announced in a

letter that Gupta's case will be re-eval
uated.
However, Remtulla argued that this
re-evaluation conducted by Shoven's
office, the same group that initially de
nied Gupta tenure, is flawed. Gupta

duced a new student organization
that plans to look closely at teach
ing and tenure issues.
Master's student Mike Payne
addressed the dwindling amount
of field space for non-varsity ath
letes. According to Payne, the
number of available fields on cam
pus has dropped in recent years
from 36 to six. He has mobilized
students to speak to Athletic Di
rector Ted Leland about the im
portance of constructing new
fields to replace those that have
been buried under new construc
tion.
During the open mic session
that followed student presenta
tions, Grace Pasigan, graduate co
ordinator for the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, ad
dressed the audience on the im
portance of seeing the recent hate

crimes on campus as incidents of
assault rather than simply hateful
speech.
In the aftermath of these inci
dents, Pasigan said, some people
have belittled the incidents by ar
guing against speech codes and the
Grey interpretation. These people,
Pasigan said, are "missing the
point."
"I agree that civilized discus
sion should be at the heart of the
Stanford community," Pasigan
said, "but this recent [hate speech]
is not pure speech. This flanguage
is equivalent to] sexual assault. ..
and physical assault."
Sophomore Cathy Rion voiced
concern that many University
buildings do not fully comply with
the Americans with Disabilities
Act, which calls for full disability
access to all buildings. Fliers put
up last week by the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union and Disabled Stu
dents at Stanford rating various
on-campus buildings on their ac
cessibility were quickly removed,
Rion added.
Rion said although she does not
have a disability, "When I choose
to be with my disabled friends or
plan an event, I can't take [disabil
ity access issues] for granted."
Sophomore Jill Schenker, a
member of the group of students
working to create a public-service

minor, asked the administration
to address the groups recently
written proposal.
"We have expressed a need,"
Schenker said. "It is the responsi
bility of the University to fulfill
that need."
Finally, Carrie Fathman, a
freshman who works at the com
munity farm, encouraged stu
dents to visit the on-campus farm,
which she said is thriving under
the care of about 50 students.
Jacqueline Wender, assistant
to University President Gerhard
Casper, gave students her advice
at the end of the forum on how to
keep discussion on these issues
between students and faculty
alive.
Wender suggested the new for
mat to "Cookies and TeaVorga
nizers last week as a way to con
nect students and faculty more ef
fectively.
"In the last 'Cookies and Tea' I
saw the need for sustained discus
sion on these issues," Wender said.
Wender also advised students
to direct their concerns to the cor
rect University channels. Al
though the President's Office is
frequently the first place that stu
dents bring their problems, be
cause it is so busy the office can be
the worst place for students to go,
Wender said.
