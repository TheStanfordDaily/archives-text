Dow reaches new high
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plowed
to another new high yesterday, outpacing broader stock measures
as investors remained cautiously optimistic about the outlook for
inflation and interest rates.
The Dow rose 123.22 to 7,292.75, with IBM and Hewlett-
Packard leading the charge past last Tuesday's record close of
7,225.32. The barometer of 30 blue-chip companies, which sat
about 900 points lower just a month ago, briefly moved within 4
points of 7,300 during the afternoon.
The Standard & Poor's 500 and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index set new highs as well, also benefiting from the
day's emphasis on the perceived safety of the biggest and best
known names.
"There wasn't much news. They just want the blue chips, want
them badly," said Robert Streed, senior investment adviser at
Northern Trust in Chicago.
Stocks drew some minor support from the bond market, where
yields on some longer-term issues fell slightly although the yield
on the benchmark 30-year bond ended unchanged.
There were no major economic reports to counter recent indica
tions that the economy's vigorous pace is easing enough to keep
pricing pressures under control.
The markets have rallied back from a steep slide in late March
and early April amid hopes that the inflation-leery Federal Reserve
won't decide to raise interest rates again to slow the economy. The
Fed nudged up short-term rates March 25 for the first time in two
years.
Investors are hopeful this week's readings on inflation and
retail sales will convince Fed officials to delay another rate
increase, but analysts expect trading to remain hesitant until after
next Tuesday's Fed policy meeting.
Friend testifies against McVeigh
DENVER (AP) — Timothy McVeigh cased the Oklahoma City
federal building before the blast and was so bent on triggering a
"general uprising in America" that he considered crashing his
truck bomb through the front doors in a suicide attack, a former
Army buddy testified yesterday.
Michael Fortier, testifying under a plea bargain as the govern
ment's star witness, said he was privy to many of McVeigh's plans
but insisted he didn't think McVeigh would cariy it out.
"If you don't consider what happened in Oklahoma, Tim was a
good person," said Fortier, speaking in a calm, matter-of-fact tone.
"I just didn't think Tim had it in him."
But Fortier said the blast happened just as McVeigh said it
would, with the Ryder truck he talked about renting, the explo
sives he talked of buying and stealing, and for a reason he talked
about endlessly: to avenge the 1993 government siege on the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.
"He told me they wanted to bomb the building on the anniver
sary of Waco ... to cause a general uprising in America, hopefully
that would knock some people off the fence and cause them to take
action," Fortier said.
