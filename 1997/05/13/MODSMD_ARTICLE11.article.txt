# Tumult in Zaire continues
## 6,000 more refugees found as rebels close within 30 miles of Kinshasa

KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) -
Another 6,000 malnourished, sick
Rwandan refugees have been
found in a camp previously sealed
ofT by Zairian rebels, U.N. offi
cials said yesterday.
The team also said more people
were emerging from the dense
tropical forest near Obilo, 50
miles south of Kisangani, Zaire's
main city in the northeast. The
rebels had blocked access to Obilo
since May 2, after reports of
attacks on refugees by Zairian vil
lagers and rebel soldiers.

"The people were clearly in a
desperate situation," U.N. refugee
spokesman Julian Fleet said in a
telephone interview from Kisan
gani. "They seemed exhausted.
There were corpses lying around
the camp, next to where people
were cooking and sleeping."
Meanwhile, preparations con
tinued for a second face-to-face
meeting between President
Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel lead
er Laurent Kabila, possibly
aboard the same ship used for
their meeting a week ago.

Since the fighting began in
September to topple Mobutu,
rebels have captured three-fourths
of the country. Kabila now claims
his fighters are only 30 miles from
Kinshasa, the capital.
While most people believe the
rebels can take the city, some of
Mobutu's elite forces could put up
stiff resistance.
Still, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, Bill Richard
son, said Sunday that Americans
or other foreigners living in Kin
shasa were not yet in danger. He

was optimistic that tomorrow's
talks between Mobutu and Kabila
would bring an end to the fighting.
Kabila says Mobutu must
resign immediately and surrender
power to a transitional authority
led by himself, or face a rebel
attack on Kinshasa. But after 32
years in power, Mobutu has
refused to quit, saying he would
give up only after elections to
choose a new leader.
The estimated 80,000 Rwan
dan refugees in central Zaire are
part of the 1.2 million Hutus who
fled to eastern Zaire in 1994 fear
ing retribution for the slaughter
of 500,000 minority Tutsis, orga
nized by the extremist Hutu gov
ernment.
About 700,000 returned to
Rwanda last year, but 300,000 oth
ers pushed west, deeper into Zaire.
Attacks last month by Zairi
ans, resentful that refugees were
receiving food aid while they were
not, forced the Rwandans into
forest. About 30,000 have trick
led out at Kasese, 15 miles south
of Kisangani.
Fleet was on the train to Obilo
that delivered 12 tons of food —
enough to feed 6,000 people for a
week. On Saturday, the train took
468 refugees to Kigangani
including 361 children separated
from their families — to be airlift
ed back to Rwanda. Since April 27,
about 15,000 Rwandans have
been flown home.
Another train will be sent with
a medical team to evacuate more
people today or tomorrow, he said.
The rebels have also driven at
least 2,600 former Rwandan sol
diers and militiamen from Zaire
and forced them into neighboring
Congo.
Tens of thousands of other
Rwandans may soon follow. Zairi
an authorities have reported
65,000 refugees headed toward tin?
border, said U.N. spokesman
Francis Kpatinde.
