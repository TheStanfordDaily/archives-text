Greek Task Force took
over a year to produce
report of little substance

TWO WEEKS AGO, the Greek
Affairs Task Force issued its
recommendations regarding
sorority and fraternity relations
with the University. This report
took more than a year to complete,
yet its conclusions, by and large, are
no more substantive than what any
one at Stanford could intuit.
According to the report, sorori
ties and unhoused fraternities will
be permitted to apply for housing
for the 1998-99 school year. That
recommendation is the most
important part of the report, but
the task force has set forth no spe
cific guidelines on what criteria
will be used to determine what
chapters are given houses or what
houses will be available.
Allowing these Greek organiza
tions to apply for housing is a big
step, but it does not seem to have
been a particularly complex one. As
long as some fraternities are
housed, it seems to be common
sense that same opportunity should
be available to other fraternities
and to sororities. It is nice to hear
the Student Affairs hierarchy final
ly acknowledge that point.
But as students and staff, we
should be outraged that it took a 27-
person committee this long to
decide it was fair to allow other
Greeks the opportunity to live in
houses. The more difficult ques
tions like where these new groups
will live seem to be the truly rele
vant ones, and they have in no way
been addressed in the report.
Ironing out the specifics of the
plan will be the responsibility of yet
another committee. According to
Heather Dunn, assistant director of
the Office of Student Activities, a
new committee of staff members
and students will determine the cri
teria by which housing decisions

will be made, oversee the applica
tion process and determine what
housing will be available.
The Row is one of the most
attractive places to live on campus
and will probably be most sought
after for most unhoused Greek
organizations. Houses like Xanadu,
Storey and Bob go first in each
year's Draw; they are obviously
popular with all students. Should
those houses be permitted to
become sorority and fraternity
houses? Should the overwhelming
majority of Stanford that is not
Greek be denied the opportunity to
get into favorite houses? Is Greek
gender equity more important than
equality of opportunity for all stu
dents? One would think that the
task force could have addressed that
issue at some point in the last year.
What was the task force's time
spent on instead? Well, the report
also encourages both the adminis
tration and Greek organizations to
strengthen their relationship. It
also urges making more meeting
space available to Greek organiza
tions. What is amazing, though, is
that those two points took the task
force a year to figure out.
Improving the relationship
between the Greeks and the admin
istration is, once again, just com
mon sense. How they should accom
plish this task is much less obvious.
And every student group com
plains about the dearth of available
meeting space. How the University
will increase meeting space with
out compromising the space for
other groups is, again, the more
relevant question.
Transforming recommendations
into reality is the most difficult task
faced by those working on Greek
issues, and it is not at all addressed
by the task force.
But, luckily, all is not lost. The
best one can ever expect from the
Student Affairs bureaucracy is
more committees, and apparently
one has already been deemed neces
sary to examine the issues of imple
mentation. Maybe after another
year there we'll see tangible results.
