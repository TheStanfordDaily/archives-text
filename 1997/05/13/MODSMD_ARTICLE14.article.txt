Wiener accepts this nation 9 s legacy and reacts to it

IN MARIBEL LEDEZMA'S letter in
yesterday's Daily, she found Jocelyn
Wiener's most recent column on
Central American immigration "very
disturbing." I found Ledezma's criti
cism even more disturbing. Wiener,
beside being a sensitive and articulate
writer, is one of the few Daily colum
nists who consistently deals with social
issues that extend beyond Palm Drive.
To suggest that she actually tolerates
the American policies that she appears
to criticize is a strong claim.
Ledezma's argument is based on two

points: the fact that Wiener uses "we" to
refer to Americans in general and the
belief that she says the pledge of alle
giance every day (apparently suggested
by the trailer at the end of the article). I
imagine it is unlikely that Wiener
intended to convey anything serious in
this postscript to her column; every such
trailer I have ever seen in The Daily has
always been a light-hearted or sarcastic
spin on what preceded it. If we can dis
miss the latter of the two points for this
reason, we are left with Wiener's choice
of pronouns to support her alleged iden

tification with the oppressor.
I cannot speak for Wiener and the
thought process behind her word selec
tion, but I do know that if I were to
write her column I, too, would refer to
Americans as "we." I would write that
way not out of blind allegiance to a
pledge, a flag or any country's actions,
but out of acknowledgment that as an
American I am an heir to my country's
past and bear responsibility for its
future. If we are to have any hope of
changing that future, we must admit, as
did Wiener, that "we are a nation proud

of our history, and we tend to make sure
it repeats itself."
I do not criticize Ledezma for failing
to identify with the United States;
indeed, I think there is much in our
country's past and present actions that
would justify her not doing so. I do not
think it is fair, however, to criticize
someone who has accepted the burden of
her country's historical legacy and is
working proactively to make its future
more just.
