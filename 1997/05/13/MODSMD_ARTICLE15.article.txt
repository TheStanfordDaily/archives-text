# Criticism of country can coexist with pride
## 
### 
I was quite upset by Maribel Ledez
ma's response to Jocelyn Wiener's Fri
day column. Ledezma seems to feel
Wiener is hypocritical for supporting the
U.S. government as a whole while also
criticizing governmental involvement in
Central American politics. Ledezma
states that "there is no middle ground
on these issues" and that she herself luis
"not been able to say the pledge | of alle
giance 1 in years."
Does Ledezma really expect us to
denounce our country just because we
disagree with some of its policies? I
know we don't like to sound too patriotic
because we're ever-so-cynical and intel
lectual about everything, but your coun
try is like your parents. I could spend
hours detailing all of the irritating
things my parents do and all the mis
takes they've made, and these would all
be valid criticisms. But for evervthintf

they've done wrong, they've done so
many more things right â€” things I take
for granted, until I see other people who
aren't as lucky. So while I might be cri
tiquing my parents for the rest of my
life, I will never denounce them.
There is a "middle ground." It's essen
tial to realize that we must always criti
cize our country in the hopes of making it
better. But this doesn't mean we can't
pledge allegiance too. Part of the Ameri
can ideal is to allow and even encourage
political criticism and discussion; congrat
ulations to Wiener for both supporting
her country and trying to improve it.
Ledezma says she does not pledge
allegiance to the United States. Then
just what, pray tell, does she pledge
allegiance to? The United States is far
from perfect, but it is better than many
other governments, and I am sure it is
better than any new system people
might feel like installing. Activism is
about working to improve the system,
not about giving up on it.
