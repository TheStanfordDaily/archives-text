# Mann's recent column was out of bounds
## 
### 
I was extremely disappointed with
Courtney Mann's column yesterday on
the upcoming NCAA women's tennis
championships which will be held at
Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um.
Mann gave four illegitimate, insult
ing reasons to attend this event. The
only reasons needed to attend these
matches are to support Stanford's
women's tennis team and to watch out
standing women's tennis. There is
absolutely no reason to insult people
who attend lectures or go to Meyer
Library to study.
In his article, Mann praises Stanford
fans who, last year, jeered a USC player
so much that after the match the
woman blasted balls into the stands.
This is utterly disgusting behavior and
not at all appreciated by the vast major
ity of spectators.

According to Mann, "In between
points, heckling, cheering, harassing
and what-not are all well within the
rules." Silence is not required at these
matches and cheering is encouraged,
but heckling and harassing have no
place at the Taube Stadium or at any
other events. Such actions serve as an
embarrassment to all involved from the
Stanford side, from players to coaches
to fans and to students.
Mann's argument that Florida
Gator fans were "raucous" last year
has no bearing on how Stanford fans
should behave He should learn a little
more about ter nis and sportsmanship
in general before The Daily prints any
more of his waiting on this subject. I
strongly hope that any fans who agree
with his methods of cheering be evicted
from the stadium. (This did in fact
happen during the UCLA men's
match.) There should be a large
turnout for this event, hopefully for
the right reasons.
