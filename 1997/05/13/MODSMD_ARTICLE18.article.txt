## Inspiring the child within 
### 
SO I WATCHED "Scream" last
night. The truth is, I'm not usual
ly much of a horror-film fan. I'll
roll my eyes at the most intense of
moments and scoff at all the super
spooky ghouls. But last night was differ
ent. I yelped with the hundreds of peo
ple around me, curled up like a baby and
hung onto my girlfriend, Cathi, like I
was about to fall off the end of the
Earth.
It's kind of strange, don't you think,
that we would choose to pay to subject
ourselves to two hours of terror. It's
weird that I wanted to spend $4 to enter
a world that made me so nervous that I
felt the almost uncontrollable need to
pee but remained locked to my seat so
that I would not have to face a secluded
bathroom with 20 Muensch-esque
masked killers ready to disembowel me
in the midst of urination. Thanks, but
no. I'll stay right here. That's not the
way I want to die. Not from a Ginsu
knife with my loins open to the world.
"It's just a movie; it's not real life!"
our parents would always tell us.
But, for two hours, it was about as
real as most of my Stanford existence. I
swore I could feel the blade cut through
me, and I experienced a transcendent
sense of relief when all was resolved.
Afterward, I walked a couple steps
faster past the looming shrubbery and
dark shadows. I made sure I didn't sleep
alone that night.

"It's just a movie," they say. But is it?
There was a time, not so long ago,
when I didn't need a screen or a VCR to
create a surreal world of intensity.
There was a time when I could spend my
life just pretending. I had a tree in the
back of my house that I turned into a
fortress. Not that I physically altered it,
for as an egghead child I lacked all prac
tical manual skills. I got a "C" in wood
shop. I was a tool without tools.
But I was still the monkey-king of my
invisible jungle ape-castle. I swung
through the branches and pelted my
enemies with pine cones and cicada
shells. I doffed my shirt, beat my chest
and sung mating calls to supposed mon
key princesses. The squirrels were my
messengers and the butterflies my look
outs; I would climb the branches, turn
cartwheels across the ground and smear
boogers in an "X" to mark my territory.
That was my world, and I ruled it. If
only I could again be a pretender to that
throne.
I know that I am old now because I
have forgotten how to make believe. I
have forsaken Mr. Rogers for Hollywood
to inspire my imaginary experiences. I
should be finding inspiration in the peo
ple and dreams around me, not on a two
dimensional screen of strangers. Yet I
cry at the end of "Rocky" while I hold
back the tears when I say goodbye to my
best friend. I choke up when Sly is a
bloody mess and can only think of

yelling for the woman of his life, but I
don't let myself search for anything
nearly as poetic as "Yo, Adrian!"
Films have become a crutch for my
lack of imagination, and they are on the
verge of providing a faux substitute for
original emotion. I have matured to an
excess of reality, and I have lost sight of
what I can create myself. I do my best to
find the proverbial roller coaster of life,
but there's a long-forgotten spot in my
mind that could give me a rocket ship to
ride. (Maybe there is a little melodrama
left in me.)
I know that I can live a life of adven
ture and romance that will put "The
English Patient" to shame, and I know
that a meal with my friends is usually
more hilarious than Monty Python and
Groucho Marx put together. But I could
be the most secure, satisfied person in
the world, and there will still be times
when I need to escape reality and create
a new persona for myself. Maybe that
persona is Mel Gibson, but I think that
maybe next time I'll forsake Braveheart
and become the monkey-king again.
