# Gupta alleges H&S conflict of interest
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
on Sunday expressed "deep disappoint
ment" at the School of Humanities and Sci
ences for its handling of his tenure appeal,
which he doubted would lead to a fair re
view.

Gupta will be reviewed
by a Humanities and Sci
ences special committee
appointed by John Shoven,
the school's dean, Gupta
learned on Thursday.
Gupta alleged that this
constitutes a conflict of in
terest because it was a sim
ilar Humanities and Sci
ences committee that orig-

inally rejected him.
Additionally, the committee will consid
er biased evidence, he said.
Gupta received a unanimous recom
mendation from the tenure committee of
the Anthropology Department last fall.
"I have to appeal to the very office that
was responsible for the Hawed process in
the first place," Gupta said.
He added that he would have preferred
the case be referred to the Provost's Office
and that he had informed Shoven that pref
erence.
In addition, Gupta objected to the
method of selecting outside faculty review
ers who were consulted at the beginning of
the tenure review process.
Gupta said he believes, based in part on
conversations with some faculty mem
bers, that Assoc. Dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences Stephen I labor had
changed the list of faculty asked to submit
letters regarding Gupta's candidacy.
"The fact that I Haber] added the name
of outside references makes the process
seem suspicious," (Jupta said.
Specifically, Gupta said, there was

widespread feeling among social and cul
tural anthropologists that I labor was bi
ased against their kind of anthropology,
which Gupta said was a factor in the deci
sion two months ago to remove Haber
from administrative supervision of the
Anthropology Department, which cur
rently is being overseen directly by
Shoven.
Neither Shoven nor Haber would com
ment on any aspect of the case.
Gupta said this process likely would not
yield him a fair review and would result in
an affirmation of the original committee's
decision.
"If the process were intended to be fair,
they would remove the tainted material,"
Gupta said, referring to letters from the
professors be thought Haber had added to
the list.

Anthropology Prof.
George Collier, the former
chair of the department,
snid deans occasionally
make changes to the list of
outside faculty.
However, Collier
added, deans in such in
stances typically specify
which outside anthropolo
gy departments should be

consulted rather than naming specific in
dividuals.
"In my experience, they haven't in the
past made specific suggestions about re
viewers," Collier said, although he would
not comment on whether he thought
Haber had made any changes in Gupta's
case.
Gupta said the only change in his file
had been the removal of a confidential let
ter from a Stanford faculty member.
Shoven's letter said (Jupta could expect
the result of the re-examination on May
23. Gupta said he had already lodged a
complaint with the dean regarding the
procedure.
