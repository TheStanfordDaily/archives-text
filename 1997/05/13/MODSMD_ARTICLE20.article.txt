## How Chelsea Clinton can help your resume, too 
### 
I SIMPLY COULD not be happier
Chelsea Clinton chose to come to
Stanford.
I know that's the reaction I'm sup
posed to have, but I don't think my rea
sons for having it are the prescribed ones.
I do buy into the official rationales, but, in
the grand scheme of things, they're really
fairly irrelevant to me.
Am I happy she's coming here because
it speaks well of Stanford's academics? I
guess so, but I don't think anyone
thought too poorly of Stanford's aca
demics in the first place. Am I happy she's
coming here because we really trumped
Harvard this time? I imagine that's the
case, but I don't think, regardless of what
happens, that Stanford can ever bump
Harvard from its mythical place in the
American psyche. Am I happy because it's
increased my chances of getting to shake
Bill Clinton's hand? Probably, but if I
really wanted to do that there are lots of
rope lines in lots of places I could have
eagerly stood behind.
The real reason I'm happy she's cho
sen to come here is because of my long

standing ambition in life. As I've often
told friends, what I really want to do
when I grow up is become a pundit, but
until now I've had no idea what an entry
level punditry job is. Generously,
though, Chelsea has now provided me
with a foot in the door.
Once the first lady's spokesman
announced Chelsea's college choice early
on the morning of April 30, I suddenly
found myself with a plethora of punditry
possibilities. At 4:30 a.m. the next day,
May 1, I sat in the middle of The Daily's
newsroom, staring into a camera and lis
tening through an earpiece as NBC's Ann
Curry asked me on "The Today Show," via
satellite from New York and live nation
wide, for my reactions to Chelsea's choice.
That afternoon, I sat in a small room
just off The Daily's newsroom to be inter
viewed for the "California Report" on
National Public Radio's San Francisco
affiliate. That interview was broadcast —
surprisingly, in its entirety — Friday
afternoon, and I was able to listen to it
just after I finished a live, via-telephone
interview with Spike O'Dell, the after

noon drive-time DJ on the Chicago talk
radio station WON. It was a very good
week, courtesy of Chelsea Clinton.
All of which was fun, for me at least.
And all of which was harmless. But it
brings up some very legitimate questions
about how much attention the national
media will pay to Stanford for the next
four years and how much of the attention
paid will be the kind we're all — students,
administrators, Chelsea — looking for.
I did three interviews that were pleas
ant, straightforward and largely favor
able to Chelsea. But not all people inter
ested in reporting on Stanford and
Chelsea will be from the mainstream,
reputable media.
When my phone rang early one morn
ing last week it was Bill Shen, a genuine
Student Leader, calling to ask whether I
thought he should appear on "American
Journal." I'd never heard of the show, but
it's apparently a downscale "Hard Copy,"
if you can believe such a thing exists. The
show was working on a piece exploring the
essentially unsubstantiated rumor that
Chelsea chose Stanford because a man

alleged to be her boyfriend goes here, and
its producers wanted Bill's comment for it.
In my just-awakened stupor, I told him
that he might as well go on the show if he
wanted to. He didn't, and that was clearly
the right decision. But it's made me real
ize just how deeply the media — and not
just those media outlets traditionally
known as "the press" — will be following
the first daughter's every move once she
finally leaves the protective confines of
the White House.
They'll want to know about her
boyfriends — real or not. They'll want to
know about how many beers she has at a
given party. They'll certainly want to
know if she inhales.
Maybe I'm insensitive, but I don't par
ticularly care how that intense scrutiny
will affect Chelsea. It does, however,
worry me to consider how the lives of
other Stanford students will be affected
by the media onslaught. It's a Clinton's
cross to bear that the press will want to
detail his or her every move, but what
about the innocent next-door neighbor
who goes to that first frat party with

Chelsea? What about the guy down the
hall who inhales for the first time with
her? Must they, too, he plastered across
the evening news? Or, worse, must they
be endlessly hounded by reporters looking
to find out about Chelsea's experiences?
Probably the best way to get the media
bloodhounds to leave us and our campus
alone is simply to refuse to them any
information. If no student will tell them
what it's like to bo in a lecture with
Chelsea, if no student will tell them what
Chelsea had to say about "The Prince" in
CIV section, then eventually the reporters
will grow tired of getting no information,
and they'll go away.
But that requires people like me to
keep their mouths shut. And I'm not sure
1 can resist tin* lures of punditry. Or that
I'd want to.
