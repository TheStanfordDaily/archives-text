## No.5 sluggers set to host West Regional Six-Pac champs get one of eight sites 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
While the road to the College World
Series may be bumpy, at least the fifth
ranked Stanford baseball team will get to
travel it on the Cardinal's home turf.
The NCAA announced yesterday that
Stanford, for the second straight year,
will be one of eight sites to host an NCAA
regional, the precursor to the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. Five other
teams will join the Cardinal at Sunken
Diamond; those will be announced Mav
19.
In a press conference after the
announcement, head coach Mark Mar
quess said the Cardinal welcomes its job
as host with open arms.
"It's nice to play at home simply

because you don't have to travel and the
players are used to the surroundings," he
said. "Most teams that have come here
don't mind it because we don't have rabid
fans that make it hostile to play."
Ronald Maestri, the chair of the NCAA
committee that selected the sites for
Regional Playoffs, announced that Stan
ford and seven other schools would host
the tournament. No. 1 Louisiana State,
No. 2 Miami, No. 3 Alabama, No. 6 Texas
Tech, No. 7 Florida State, No. 8 Missis
sippi State and No. 12 Oklahoma State
joined the Cardinal to round out the list.
"We had to select these from about 20
bids we received," Maestri said. "They
were all quality sites, and it was difficult
to pick.
"The competitiveness in the
bids is a credit to college base
ball."
Maestri said that there were
four main criteria for selection:
the quality of the facility, atten
dance at sporting events, rev
enue potential and geographic
location.

"We're trying to give student
athletes the opportunity to play
at a quality site where there's
the attitude we're looking for,"
Maestri said.
The West Regional takes place
May 22-25 at Sunken Diamond.
But before the Cardinal can
look forward to the regional, the
team has to focus on the Pacific
10 Conference Championship
Series beginning Thursday at
Sunken Diamond. The series
pits Stanford (38-16, 21-9 Pac

10 South), against the Washing
ton Huskies (41-17, 20-4 Pac-10
North), victors in the Northern
Division.
The winner of the Pac-10 title
receives an automatic berth in
the NCAA tournament. Because
Stanford has already qualified,
the Huskies have much more
riding on the outcome. Stanford
is looking to cement a top seed.
Play begins Thursday at 7
p.m. Tickets are available by
calling 723-1021.
