## No.5 sluggers set to host West Regional Six-Pac champs get one of eight sites 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
While the road to the College World
Series may be bumpy, at least the fifth
ranked Stanford baseball team will get to
travel it on the Cardinal's home turf.
The NCAA announced yesterday that
Stanford, for the second straight year,
will be one of eight sites to host an NCAA
regional, the precursor to the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. Five other
teams will join the Cardinal at Sunken
Diamond; those will be announced Mav
19.
In a press conference after the
announcement, head coach Mark Mar
quess said the Cardinal welcomes its job
as host with open arms.
"It's nice to play at home simply

because you don't have to travel and the
players are used to the surroundings," he
said. "Most teams that have come here
don't mind it because we don't have rabid
fans that make it hostile to play."
Ronald Maestri, the chair of the NCAA
committee that selected the sites for
Regional Playoffs, announced that Stan
ford and seven other schools would host
the tournament. No. 1 Louisiana State,
No. 2 Miami, No. 3 Alabama, No. 6 Texas
Tech, No. 7 Florida State, No. 8 Missis
sippi State and No. 12 Oklahoma State
joined the Cardinal to round out the list.
"We had to select these from about 20
bids we received," Maestri said. "They
were all quality sites, and it was difficult
to pick.
