The Cardinal track and field team had
some impressive performances over the
weekend. On Friday, Stanford hosted the
Cardinal Invitational, a meet open to
both collegiate and postcollegiate ath
letes. Saturday, a few Cardinal athletes
traveled to Modesto to compete at the
Modesto relays.
There were several notables compet
ing at the Cardinal invite, which helped
bolster the competition. Dan O'Brien, an
Olympic gold medalist and world-record
holder in the decathlon won the 110-
meter high hurdles. PattiSue Plumer,
Class of '85 and a three-time Olympian,
won the women's 1,500 meters in 4 min
utes, 19.43 seconds. Chris Huffins, a
decathlete with his sights set on the 2000
Olympics, won the 200 in 21.58 seconds.
The winner of the men's discus is
someone known quite well to the Stan
ford throwers. Cardinal assistant coach
Robert Weir won the event with a throw
of 190» feet, 8 inches. Junior Justin
Strand followed his coach's example,
winning the hammer throw with a toss of
222-8.
Junior Jeff Allen recorded another
first in the 400-meter hurdles with a time
of 51.54, just one-hundredth of a second
slower than his season best set against
California at Big Meet.
Freshman Toby Stevenson won the
men's pole vault competition. En route to
his first-place finish, he set a new school
record in the event, leaping 17-8 3/4. The
old mark of 17-8 1/2 which Stevenson
had matched earlier in the season was set
