# Card falls short at nationals
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
The Stanford women's water polo
(25-9) did not quite live up to its No. 3
ranking this weekend, finishing a disap
pointing fourth at the national champi
onships in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"I think we are a better team than
our results or play showed," said sopho
more co-captain Lindsay Tarn. "I think
we are at least the No. 2 team in the
country."
Freshmen Suze Gardner and Ellen
Estes garnered first-team AU-American
honors for their efforts while sopho
more goalkeeper Heather Crary earned
honorable mention.
The Cardinal's championship hopes
were dashed Saturday with a 6-5 loss to
California in the semifinals. Stanford
faced San Diego State in the third-place
game and lost 9-8 after taking an early
lead. Cal went on to lose 6-3 in the final
match against No. 1 UCIjV
Stanford made it through to the
semifinals in relatively easy fashion
with a pair of blowout wins Friday.
The Cardinal defeated host Michigan
12-2 and IJC-Santa Barbara 10-2.
Gardner had a hat trick plus one to

spark the Card's victory over the
Gauchos.
In Stanford's anticipated semifinal
showdown against Cal, the Golden
Bears took the early advantage, jump
ing out to a 3-1 lead midway through
the second quarter. Goals by Estes and
Gardner for the Card evened the score
before the two squads went into the
locker room. It was the third quarter
however, that broke the Cardinal's back
as Cal scored three unanswered goals.
Stanford scored two goals in the
fourth quarter, hut it would not he
enough as Cal held on for the 6-5 win.
The Bears scored six goals in only 20
shots in contrast to Stanford's 5-of-22
conversion rate.
"Everybody was playing their hard
est; it just did not come together," Tarn
said. "This game was never decided in a
moment or lapse. We just didn't pull
through."
The weekend was not over for the
Cardinal after just one loss, however.
The squad had the opportunity to play
for third place against fourth-ranked
San Diego State, which had lost to even
tual champion UCLA in the other semi
final. Stanford came out looking for a
little redemption in this game and

thought it found some after taking a 5-2
lead in the early going. Hut midway
through the game t he momentum shift
ed, and the Aztecs came roaring back to
tie the game, sending it. into overtime.
In the first overtime, Stanford took a
one-goal lead on a clutch score by fresh
man Elisa Keszler. But again, the cush
ion was not enough as San Diego State
came hack to tie the game at 8-8 with
one minute left and send it into a sec
ond, sudden-death overtime. Ninety
seconds into the second extra frame, the
Aztecs scored to end the game at 9-8.
"People had a real hard time coming
off the Cal loss," said senior co-captain
Alice Cathcart. "We came out hard and
it was difficult to sustain that to the
end. We lost some concentration."
The team was led again this weekend
by Gardner and Est es, who as freshmen
have paced the Card in scoring through
out, the season. Keszler and sophomore
Nicole Glazer also contributed strong
performances. Unfortunately, none of
this was enough to boost Stanford into
the top three.
"We definitely went in with high
expectations and were fired up to finish
at least top three," Cathcart said. "We
all are really disappointed."
