After finishing both the first and second round of the
NCAA West Regional in seventh place, senior co-captain
Andrea Baxter struck in a most timely manner, firing a 1-
under-par 71 in the third and final round to leapfrog into a
second-place finish, just a single stroke behind individual
champion Dodie Mazzuca of Washington. On a day when
poor weather wreaked havoc among the late-round leaders,
Baxter continued her solid, consistent play to finish at 4
under for the tournament (72-69-71). It was a triumphant
return to top form for Baxter, who missed a large part of the
season due to a wrist injury.

Despite a broken toe suffered just one week earlier
against Arizona, junior right fielder Joe Kilburg insisted
on playing in last weekend's crucial series against No. 4
UCLA. One win away from the Six-Pac crown, Kilburg
delivered in a big way when the squad needed it most.
After the Cardinal dropped the first two games of the
series, Kilburg exploded in game three, going 5-for-5 with
two runs and three RBIs, including a key two-run homer
that gave Stanford a solid 6-2 lead en route to a 9-6 win.
For the weekend, Kilburg went 6-for-13, crushing two
home runs and knocking in six runs.
