# Ultimate preps at Cal States tourney
## 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
This weekend the Stanford
women's Ultimate Krisbee team,
Superfly, drove to Santa Cruz to
compete in the Cal States Tour
nament. This was a two-day
event, but the squad only played
in the Saturday games, opting to
spend Sunday catching up on
studying instead of catching Kris
bees.
"The point of the tournament
was not to win," said coach Jen
nifer Donnelly.
However, Superfly (16-0 inter
collegiate, 14-0 Western Region)
finished the day with a very good
record of 2-1. Its only loss came to
a Hay Area team with a roster
filled with many former national

championship players which
Superfly had beaten earlier in the
season at the Davis Ultimate Invi
tational tournament. The club
team was evidently sore from this
loss and got their revenge against
Superfly.
The feelings on the sidelines
were a bit awkward, Donnelly
said, as Superfly was unaccus
tomed to losing. The squad had
gone undefeated in its last two
tournaments. Hopefully, though,
this loss will make the squad
want to win even more.
Superfly's wins were against it
Canadian team and a club team
from Davis. These wins were the
result of fine play by everyone,
most notably sophomore Xan
Arch and junior Gwynn Masada.
"They stepped up, played a big
role and didn't have many
errors," Donnelly said.
Superfly used the tournament

as a chance to give more responsi
bility to the younger players and
play people at different positions.
This will strengthen the team
when it goes to nationals three
weeks from now in Davis.
The veteran players will be a
big part of their performance at
nationals. Senior Dominique
Fontenette leads the race for

national MVP. She throws about
40 percent of Superfly's goals.
Senior Abby Hoover catches
about 30 percent of the team's
goals. However, their stats in
these areas are falling. This is not
because they are playing any
worse but because the less-experi
enced players are stepping up and
contributing more to the scoring.
