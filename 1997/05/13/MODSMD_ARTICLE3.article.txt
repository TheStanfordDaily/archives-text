# Rape victim tells story of assault
## Sororities required to attend speech 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Speaking to a packed audience
at Kresge Auditorium last night,
rape survivor Katie Koestner
shared her story of being sexually
assaulted by a fellow student at
the College of William and Mary.
Koestner received nationwide
media attention after she publi
cized her story, complaining the
university did little to support her
decision to press charges against
her assailant.
"Every time I tell this story,
I'm on trial one more time," said
Koestner, a 1994 graduate of
Williams and Mary.
She was raped during the third
week of her freshman year by a
man she had been interested in
since their dormitories watched
"Monty Python: The Quest for
the Holy Grail" together during

orientation.
After "hanging out" for two
weeks, the two went on a date to
gether. She said she told him from
the start that she did not drink
and that she planned on waiting
until she was married before hav
ing sex. At the restaurant, her
date ordered two glasses of cham
pagne. "I said, 'Peter, we're not 21
yet.' He said, 'I know.'"
"I only gave in to two sips.
Some people told me since then
that's how he knew."
The couple went back to her
room because she did not want to
go to a fraternity party. They
danced together, and he began to
unbutton the back of her dress,
she said. She then backed away
and threw a pillow at him. A tick
ling fight ensued which, in turn,
led to a wrestling match that left
them on the floor of her room, she
said.
She said that Peter was trying to
get under her dress. He kissed her
so hard that she could not speak.
She reminded the audience that he
outweighed her by about 50
pounds. She said she felt trapped.
"I started to cry. I said, 'Please
let go,' and he did."
He asked to sleep in her room,
she said. After considering her
alternatives, she agreed, but she
stayed awake most of the night.
She lasted until 5 a.m., but she
awoke to Peter kissing her neck.
She was pinned against the wall.
"I don't think I screamed
because somehow I managed to
bite through my lip."
She did not hit him because her
fists were trying to cover her chest,
she said. She did not kick him
because she thought that keeping
her legs straight would dissuade
him, she said.
"As he left, he turned around
and he said, 'Thank you.' "
"I did say 'no' more than 12

times in one night," Koestner said.
"Maybe 13 is a lucky number."
She said she hears about 10 sto
ries of rape from students at eveiy
school she visits, which amounts to
about 4,000 stories.
"I hate the statistics because
they have faces for me," she said.
"I imagine rape is a very silent
word at Stanford University."
Koestner found little support
when she decided to take legal
action against her assailant.
The nurse at the student health
clinic told her she needed to go
home to sleep since she had not
slept in two nights. She was not
immediately examined by a doctor.
"If someone you know is raped,
they have 72 hours to get a rape kit
done."
This did not help her case. She
was only able to have a hearing at
Williams and Mary where the bur
den of proof is clear and convincing
evidence. Although it was, for the
most part, her word against his,
she had enough evidence.
Her parents were not support
ive at all. She called her parents
later in the week to tell them what
happened. When her father, an
FBI agent, found out that she let
him into her room, he hung up.

To stop rape, she tried to get
across three main ideas — commu
nication, responsibility and
respect.
For the first time all evening,
she let a tear fall as she spoke
about the jokes men have made
about rape. "If rape is only a joke,
who's going to stop rape. Silence is
the easy way out."
Sorority members were required
to attend the speech. "I was happy
to see that it was an important
enough event to commit them
selves and their (sorority) chapters
to it," said Intersorority Council
President Lisa Rubin, a junior.
For fraternity members, the
event was optional.
"I know none of you had to be
here," Koestner addressed the
men. She had a different message
for the men not in attendance. "If I
were speaking about the Holo
caust, should only Jewish students
attend? If I were speaking about
the Civil Rights Movement, should
only African-American students
come?"
"Through high school friends, I
heard about her speeches," Rubin
said. "I really wanted to bring
someone here to talk about their
experiences with sexual assault."
