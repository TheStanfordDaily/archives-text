Three Stanford professors yesterday discussed the
implications of Hong Kong under Chinese rule, which
will begin in July.
The panel discussion's title, "Hong Kong, PRC: His
torical, Economic and Political Contexts," captured the
essence of each of the three professors' field of expertise.
History Prof. Emeritus Lyman Van Slyke spoke
on the colony from its origin to present day,o Politi
cal Science Prof. Michel Oksenberg outlined the po
litical significance of the transfer and Economics
Prof. Lawrence Lau discussed the economic implica
tions.
The event was sponsored by the Asia / Pacific Re
search Center and the Center for East Asian Studies.
From a historical standpoint, the Hong Kong case is
unique. The Chinese and British laid the ground for the
transfer as early as 1984 when the two countries signed
the Joint Declaration. According to the document, China
will have sovereignty over the island on July 1 when its
99-year lease ends.
"Rarely have people been able to plan for the transfer
of power of one country to another, yet much remains
uncertain and unplanned," Oksenberg said.
Theoretically, China will adopt a "one country, two
systems" policy in which Hong Kong will maintain sepa
rate laws, an independent legislature and judiciary from
the mainland. Its independent currency and status as a
free port will remain unchanged.
The key issue, then, is whether the Chinese leaders
can keep its promises in practice.
China's credibility will soar in the international arena

and its internal development will increase, according to
Oksenberg, if the leaders are able "to balance political
stability and individual freedom in Hong Kong."
In addition, Oksenberg pointed to the challenges fac
ing the colony's future chief executive. "C. H. Tung must
retain the confidence of Beijing and the people of Hong
Kong when many of their interests don't coincide," he
said.
Lau remains "cautiously optimistic" about Hong
Kong's future. Because China and Hong Kong share
similar interests, "what is good for Hong Kong is good for
China," he said. "It is in China's self interest economi
cally, diplomatically and politically to keep Hong Kong
going."
From a historical perspective, Van Slyke was not so
quick to agree with Lau, pointing to the unexpected
events in history when a gap emerged between leaders'
intention and actual events. "Politics in the short-term
can override the deeper, long-run interests of the coun
try," he said.
According to Oksenberg, the leaders of China have
not shown a toleration of dissent. "When in doubt, they
oppress," he said.
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, the
British have feared that Beijing may crackdown on the
rights of Hong Kong's citizens. To democratize the
colony, Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patton established a de
mocratically elected legislature and recently passed a Bill
of Rights in the colony.
Will China retract Britain's actions? In the end, "how
Beijing deals with Hong Kong will be a litmus test of
China's ability to rule," Lau said.
More than 100 people attended the panel, which will
be broadcast May 23 and 24 on Channel 51.
