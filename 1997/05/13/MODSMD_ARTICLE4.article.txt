Ideas introduced at Andersen
Consulting's World Wide Web site
contest last week could promise
students and faculty a wide range
of new services at the Stanford
Bookstore.
The contest, titled the Web
Challenge, drew many Stanford
students with various back
grounds and invited them to take
on the task of creating a demo Web
site for the Bookstore.
Among the proposals made at
the final presentation, held last
week at Andersen's Palo Alto of
fice, were practical ideas such as or
dering course books online and a

video camera monitoring the
cashier line that could alleviate the
massive crowd the Bookstore
draws at the start of every quarter.
According to Hani Sayegh, the
Bookstore's director of course ma
terials and Microdisc, while the
store has "no commitment" to im
plement the proposed ideas, it is
looking forward to receiving a for
mal proposal from the contest's
winners and runner-up groups
within the next few days.
"I know they are working with
Andersen about putting together a
presentation for us," he said. "It
was clear they put a lot of work into
it, and if we see something that we
like, we'll talk."
Sayegh, who attended the final
presentation, called the gathering
"very interesting and dynamic,"
adding that he saw the contes
tants' work as a "good starting
point."
"There would be a lot of work to
be done," he said. "But we're just
waiting to see what will happen."
While the teams, all consisting
of three to four undergraduate stu
dents, were judged on the basis of
creativity, functionality, presenta
tion, usability and technology, the
competition also tested the contes
tants' ability to work under time
pressure.
The groups were presented with
the Bookstore business case three
weeks ago and met with the store's
representatives and Andersen's
mentors throughout the competi
tion to obtain technological and in

formational feedback. The Book
store and Andersen staff and out
side technology experts comprised
the judging panel.
Brian Sprague, associate part
ner at Andersen and a 1982 Stan
ford graduate, organized the con
test and said he was pleased with
the high level of competition.
"We ended up with four very
strong presentations from varied
groups with multi-level stand
points of view," he said. "It was ex
citing to see the crossing of various
inputs, and every single team did a
spectacular job of demonstrating
understandingof not only the tech
nological aspects but also of busi
ness discipline."
Team Details and Design —
with its members, Walter Tseng, a
science and technology and society
member, Winston She, a computer
science major, Oliver Miao, an engi
neering major, all seniors, and ju
nior Leighton Kan, also a computer
science major — took first place.
The Axe — with seniors Alex
Alviar, an economics and political

science major, Max Klee, a symbol
ic systems major and Steve Rosen
baum, a history major, took second
place with what Sprague called the
"most technically complete" Web
site design.
"The fact that we were a natural
unit was definitely a winning fac
tor," said She, whose team mem
bers are also his drawmates. "It
also helped that we each had differ
ent skills" in presentation, technol
ogy and art.
According to Sayegh, the contest
was a positive learning experience
for the Bookstore and the students.
Adding that he looks forward to
providing professional insight and
working with the contest's winners
to improve the project, he gave
adding links to vendors as an exam
ple of an important Web site fea
ture for the Bookstore.
"This is one thing no group men
tioned," he said. "It would provide
direct access to publishers and
allow students to get their own in
formation of the book, the author
and so on."
