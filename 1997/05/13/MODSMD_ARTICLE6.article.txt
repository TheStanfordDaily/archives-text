# Top scholars get presidential perks
## 
### Emily Card 
Like all Stanford students, 200 freshmen
this year received the big, congratulatory enve
lope in early April. Unlike their peers, these
freshmen also received a $1,500 grant and an
invitation to University President Gerhard
Casper's house.
The grant and invitation were some of the
perks offered to these students selected as
['resident's Scholars by Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya.

Concerned with the fierce competition in re
cruiting the nation's best and brightest, tlx;
Admissions Office created the President's
Scholar Program as a solution, according to
Keith Todd, head of the President's Scholar
program.
Candidates for President's Scholar can be
nominated by any admissions officer, and Mon
toya makes the final selection of 200 scholars.
The scholars are offered a $1,500 research
grant as well as a complimentary visit to the
Stanford campus. The grant may be used in

any project which is approved by the Under
graduate Research Opportunities office and
has a faculty sponsor.
According to Todd, the Admissions Office
noticed a trend over the past several years of
the top students applying to more schools and
more schools actively recruiting them.
People told the Admissions Office, "We re
cruit athletes why don't we recruit scholars a.s
well?" and the Presidential Scholars program
was created to entice top students
into attending Stanford.
Todd said individuals are cho
sen based on their intellectual and
academic vibrancy as well as their
academic readiness with regard to
research.
Freshman Monica Eneriz
found her selection as a Presi
dent's Scholar influential in her
decision to attend Stanford. She
recognized the honor involved in
being chosen as a scholar at one of
the nation's top universities.
She said she believed the re
search grant "opens doors, and al
lows the opportunity to delve into
academics." Eneriz appreciated
having Todd keep in touch with
her throughout the year. Eneriz is
interested in doing archaeology re
search, she said.
While Todd believes the pro
gram is successful, he stated it was

one undergoing constant change
and evaluation. Todd, along with
Montoya and members from the
President's Office meet every
other year to evaluate the pro
gram.
"The president wants to put his
mark on the program," Todd said.
However, there are critics of
the program.
Sophomore Nathan Schmidt, a
President's Scholar, developed,
built and tested vertical flight
under sponsorship of Assoc. Aero
dynamics Prof. Liana Kroo.
Schmidt went on to share his find
ings with Kroo's research group in
1996.
While Schmidt enjoyed the re
search experience, he had already
been doing research for graduate
students the past three sum
mers. He said that the selection
process for President's Scholars
is geared toward people who are
already involved in self-motivat
ed research.
"I would consider the program
more of a recruiting tool, that's

how I was approached," Schmidt
said.
Schmidt said he believed the
program could be more effective by
creating more formal expectations.
"My impression was that it's sort
of'go play' money," he noted.
He added that the program ex
ists as a means of bragging rights
for Stanford but the poor execu
tion and lack of closure is some
thing that the administration
needs to work on.
Schmidt said the implicit goal is
to recruit top notch research stu
dents but the procedure by which
they are selected, he says, is all
wrong. He believed that the goal
would be better met by giving
fewer people more research money
so that they could do more sub
stantial research.
Schmidt is considering a career
in research because of his own in
terest.
"I think that research is benefi
cial, so I would have done it with or
without the money," Schmidt
said.
