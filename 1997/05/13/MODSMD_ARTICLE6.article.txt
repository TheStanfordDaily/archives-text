## 
### Emily Card 
Like all Stanford students, 200 freshmen
this year received the big, congratulatory enve
lope in early April. Unlike their peers, these
freshmen also received a $1,500 grant and an
invitation to University President Gerhard
Casper's house.
The grant and invitation were some of the
perks offered to these students selected as
['resident's Scholars by Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya.

Concerned with the fierce competition in re
cruiting the nation's best and brightest, tlx;
Admissions Office created the President's
Scholar Program as a solution, according to
Keith Todd, head of the President's Scholar
program.
Candidates for President's Scholar can be
nominated by any admissions officer, and Mon
toya makes the final selection of 200 scholars.
The scholars are offered a $1,500 research
grant as well as a complimentary visit to the
Stanford campus. The grant may be used in

any project which is approved by the Under
graduate Research Opportunities office and
has a faculty sponsor.
According to Todd, the Admissions Office
noticed a trend over the past several years of
the top students applying to more schools and
more schools actively recruiting them.
People told the Admissions Office, "We re
cruit athletes why don't we recruit scholars a.s
well?" and the Presidential Scholars program
