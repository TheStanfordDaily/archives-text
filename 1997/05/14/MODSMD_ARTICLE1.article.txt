# Helping in the aftermath of the Iranian earthquake
## Students plan to aid relief efforts 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
In the wake of the magnitude 7.1 earth
quake that rocked Iran Saturday, Stanford
students are mobilizing to contribute to the
quake's relief efforts.
"I'm Iranian myself, so it pulls a cord in my
own heart," said junior Omeed Rezaian, who
is coordinating the effort. "Sometimes, I feel
like my hands are tied. I have loved ones over
there."
According to Rezaian, the death toll is be

tween 2,400 and 4,000. About 60,000 people
were left homeless by the quake, which struck
east of Tehran. Iranian officials estimate
damage at $66.7 million.
A group of about 30 students quickly mobi
lized to help Rezaian in his efforts.
"Sunday, I started talking to some friends.
Monday, we basically resolved what our strat
egy would be," Rezaian said.
The students will request donations from
dormitories in order to reach their $5,000
goal. In addition, the group plans to set up a
table in White Plaza tomorrow and attend the

Islamic Society's congregational prayer on
Friday to seek support.
Rezaian said he has attempted to contact
students at UC-Berkeley to see if the two
schools could join efforts but has yet to re
ceive a response.
Rezaian added that he is also planning to
host a fund-raising dinner at Bechtel Interna
tional Center May 23 or 24. At the end of win
ter quarter, a similar dinner — featuring
Iranian food, books and poems — was held to
send relief to Iran after another
earthquake.
The political climate in Iran
makes people hesitant to get in
volved in a project like this one,
Rezaian said.
"Because of the harsh realities
there, you really have to have a
personal connection to get any
thing like this going," he said.
The funds Rezaian collects
will be given to the Islamic Cul
tural Center of Northern Califor
nia's Earthquake Relief Fund,
which in turn will distribute the

money to the Iranian Red Cres
cent, an alternative to the Red
Cross that is based in the Middle
East.
According to Rezaian, the Red
Cross takes 25 percent of the do
nations to cover overhead costs.
"I was prepared to send it to the
Red Cross," he admitted.
According to Associated Press
reports, the Iranian Red Cres
cent has set up more than 100
tents and has brought blankets,
water and food for those left
homeless.
Contributions for the relief ef
fort can be directly deposited in
account 6141-881888 at Wells
Fargo's ICCNC Earthquake
Fund.
