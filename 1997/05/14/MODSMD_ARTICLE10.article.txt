## Clinton may support revised bill limiting late-term abortions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Reflecting the changes taking
place in a contentious national
debate, the White House signaled
possible support yesterday for
Democratic-drafted legislation to
curtail a variety of late-term abor
tion procedures.
"We are looking very carefully
at Sen. Daschle's proposed lan
guage," presidential spokesman
Mike McCurry said of a measure
drafted by Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle. "We believe
it's possible for the White House
to support that language."
Daschle drafted his bill as an
alternative to a GOP-backed bill
that would ban one type of late
term procedure, so-called "par
tial birth abortions," except in
cases in which a mother's life is
endangered.
The alternative would impose
a limited ban on all abortions
after the point at which a fetus
could survive outside the womb.
At the same time, it would pro
vide a broader set of exceptions
than the GOP measure â€” apply
ing in cases that would threaten
the mother's life or risk "grievous
injury" to her health.
A Senate vote is expected by
week's end, with numerous law
makers publicly undecided on
the issue. Clinton has threatened
a veto of the GOP bill unless it
takes women's health issues into
account, and Republican spon
sors of the measure say they are
struggling to amass a veto-proof
majority, as the House did earli
er this year.
Lawmakers failed last year to
override Clinton's veto of an
identical measure. Sen. Rick San

torum, R-Pa., told reporters dur
ing the day the odds of gaining a
veto-proof majority this time
were "less than 50-50 but I think
we're gaining."
Whatever the outcome of the
clash, Daschle's decision to
plunge into the issue shows how
much the debate over abortion
has changed in recent years. Anti
abortion forces have steadily
gained ground in Congress in the
elections since 1992.
By 1995, substantial numbers
in both parties were willing to vote
for the so-called "partial birth"
ban, particularly given the grue
some nature of the procedure.
Critics of the GOP measure
say it is unconstitutional, since
the Supreme Court has ruled that
states must take the preservation
of the mother's health into
account when restricting late
term abortions.
Daschle's measure would
apply only in nine states that
have not yet implemented their
own restrictions on abortions
after the point of fetus viability.
Women in the other 41 states
would not be affected.
Douglas Johnson of the
National Right to Life Commit
tee, attacked Daschle's measure
in an interview as a "sham. ... It
contains no meaningful limita
tion on partial birth abortions or
other late abortions," he said.
Johnson and other abortion
foes argue that Daschle is trying to
provide political cover for himself
and other lawmakers who are fac
ing re-election next year and don't
want to curtail abortion rights but
are fearful of voting against the
"partial birth" procedure.
