### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - The
Zairian government yesterday
imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
and urged civilians to take up
arms to defend the capital against
rebels. Hours later, a rebel
spokesman said the first rebel
fighters had entered the capital.
Raphael Ghenda, information
minister for the rebels, said "our
first troops are in Kinshasa."

Ghenda, who spoke at rebel
headquarters in the southeast
ern city of Lubumbashi, said he
had no further details. His state
ment could not be confirmed
independently.
Earlier in the day, the govern
ment called on Kinshasans to
protect the city of 6 million.
"The Zairian army forces are
determined to defend their just

cause and will defend Kinshasa
and its environs," Information
Minister Kin-Keiy Mulumba
said after a meeting of the Secu
rity Council.
He said the rebels were
between Kenge and Kinshasa,
which seemed to confirm diplo
matic reports that rebel and gov
ernment troops were battling over
a bridge on the Kwango River,
100 miles cast of the capital.
"The government signals that
the population has the legitimate
right to defend itself with pro
portional means to the rebels,"
the information minister said.
An overnight curfew, from 8
p.m. to 6 a.m., was to begin last
night. During the curfew, gov
ernment troops would maintain
surveillance over the city's
"strategic areas" and fire on
looters, Kin-Keiy told reporters.
"There will be identification
controls, and the forces of order
have been ordered to open fire on
anyone flagrant pillaging after
three summary warnings," he
said.
Peace talks aimed at prevent
ing a battle for this city were
planned for today, as is the start
of a strike in Kinshasa aimed at
assisting a rebel takeover.
South African Deputy Presi
dent. Thabo Mboki has said the
planned meeting today between
President Mobutu Sese Seko and
rebel leader Laurent Kabila like
ly will be the last chance for a
peaceful solution to the seven
month Zairian civil war.
"The meeting Wednesday
may very well be the last chance
to find a negotiated settlement,"
Mbeki said.
When U.S. Ambassador
Daniel Howard Simpson was
asked if this was the case, he
said: "I hope there are never any

last chances for peace."
Publicly, South Africa and the
United States — the major fig
ures in starting the talks — are
expressing optimism that Mobu
tu's inevitable departure from
power will be achieved at today's
meeting.
"What will be formed at these
peace talks is an inclusive transi
tional government where power
is handed over in a peaceful fash
ion," the United States' U.N.
ambassador, liill Richardson,
said Sunday.
Simpson, who met with Zairi
an Prime Minister Likulia
Bolongo yesterday morning, said
"the obvious question is how
does one transfer power in Kin
shasa without bloodshed."
Mbeki was to fly to the region
to try to arrange final agreement
on crucial issues of when and
how Mobutu, (i(i, and ailing with
prostate cancer, would hand over
power after nearly 132 years.
Mbeki's departure from South
Africa was delayed until later
today because of commitments
in South Africa.
On the streets of Kinshasa,
leaflets left on cars or stacked on
street corners called for people to
observe a "ville morte" — dead
city strike — called for tomorrow
by political opposition groups
and the rebels.
()t her leaflets that appeared
today, from the opposition youth
movement, demanded the resig
nation of Mobutu, arrest of
Zairian soldiers and rejection of
a now 100,000 Zaire (about (50
U.S. cents) bill printed by the
government as the currency
devalues.
Today's meeting was to be
aboard the South African navy
vessel anchored off neighboring
Congo.
