Tuskegee victims will get apology
WASHINGTON (AP) — Eight surviving victims
of the government's notorious r ruskegee syphilis
study will receive a formal apology from President
Clinton on Friday.
Clinton's apology comes 25 years after it wjis dis
closed that the government promised 400 poor
black men from Alabama free medical care and
then denied them treatment of a disease they didn't
know they had.
The government long ago paid the victims and
their heirs $10 million. But the survivors have long
sought something more: a formal apology.
"It can make these men feel better if thc?rc; is, in
fact, some recognition that some wrong has Inson
done," their attorney, Fred Gray, said last month
when the apology was first promised.
Cosby murderer pleads not guilty
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A teenage immigrant
pleaded innocent yesterday to charges he murdered
Bill Cosby's son during an attempted robbery.
The plea was entered by public defender Henry
«J. Hall on behalf of Mikail Markhasev, 18, who did
not speak during the Superior Court arraignment.
Ennis Cosby, 27, was shot to death Jan. 16 on
a dark road just off the San Diego Freeway in
Sepulveda Pass. He apparently had stopped to fix
a flat.
The two-count indictment accused Markhasev of

attempted robl>ery and of murder with the "special
circumstance" of robbery or attempted robbery. So
called special circumstances aggravating factors
in a murder case — allow the prosecution to seek
the death penalty. Prosecutors have not yet said
whether they will do so in Mnrkhasev's case.
Markhasev, who came to the United states from
Ukraine eight years ago, was arrested March 12. lie
has been in custody ever since.
Airlines protest partner benefits
SAN FRANCISCO (AF) — The nation's major
airlines sued yesterday to block a city ordinance
requiring them to offer health benefits to their
employees' domestic partners.
The lawsuit filed by the Air Transport Associa
tion says the city has no right to regulate air carri
ers. It seeks an injunction barring enforcement of
the ordinance, which goes into effect June 1.
"Airlines have always been governed by federal,
not local, laws because it would be impossible to
operate in hundreds of communities with different,
and possibly contradictory, local ordinances," ATA
President Carol I lallett said.
The Washington-based ATA represents 22
domestic carriers that fly 9. r > percent of the nation's
cargo and passenger traffic.
The law, support/*1 by the city's powerful gay
community, requires companies doing business with
San Francisco to offer the same benefits to legally
registered domestic partners as they do to spouses.
