Like Montoya, new dean
of admissions must keep
'well-rounded' body alive

EACH YEAR, prospective
freshmen and other visitors
to the Stanford campus
comment on Stanford's unique
atmosphere. It's not unusual to
hear them remark that Stanford
students, in general, seem more
involved in a variety of activities
than students at other prestigious
universities around the country.
It's also not unusual that visi
tors to the Farm make such obser
vations. Stanford has a long tradi
tion of accepting well-rounded
applicants rather than students
whose strengths and commit
ments lie in one specific area.
After July 1, when James Mon
toya, the current dean of under
graduate admissions and financial
aid, takes over as vice provost for
student affairs, some transforma
tions are likely to occur in the
admissions office as a new dean fills
his shoes. In selecting that new
dean, the University should keep in
mind a few things about the char
acter of its future freshmen classes.
Furthermore, the committee
members should keep in mind a
few things about the character of
the applicant. Montoya, in addi
tion to helping shape the character
of each new freshman class for the
past five years, has made some
major changes during his time as
dean of admissions. He has intro
duced the early decision, Presi
dent's Scholars and Stanford
Admit Weekend programs, which
have all increased Stanford's
attractiveness in the eyes of
prospective students.
Moreover, Montoya's strong
personality, good humor and
uncanny ability to remember the
topic on which students wrote
their application essays when he
finally meets them face-to-face

have molded the admissions pro
cess in recent Stanford history.
Right now, a 14-member com
mittee is conducting a national
search for a new dean. The com
mittee hopes to have a new dean in
place by the time Montoya vacates
the position in July. As those com
mittee members select candidates,
it's important that they look for
more than people who fill a laun
dry list of credentials.
First, the committee ought to
look for someone who can bring as
much energy and vitality to the job
as Montoya has. Montoya's strong
personality has contributed tremen
dously to the admissions process at
Stanford. That's important to the
University as a whole — deciding
who will be offered spots in Stan
ford's freshman class is among the
most significant decisions the Uni
versity makes, for those students
define the school's character.
Second, University President
Gerhard Casper has spoken of
shifting the emphasis of the
admissions process to allow for a
greater number "angular" (as
opposed to "rounded") students —
those who are outstanding in one
specific field but lack the other tal
ents seen in Stanford's more tradi
tional, "rounded" admits.
Such talk is worrisome, particu
larly coming as it does in connec
tion with the search for a new dean.
After all, its rounded students are,
to a large degree, what separates
Stanford from its competitors. To
start seeking out students with spe
cific and narrow interests would
change the University's entire
character. Let the "angular" math
geniuses go to MIT. Let the "angu
lar" musicians go to Julliard.
Administrators say they are not
talking about a drastic change and
will continue to seek well-rounded
students, increasing the number
of "angular" students only mini
mally. The University can support
that claim by selecting a new dean
of admissions who is committed to
filling the freshmen ranks with
Renaissance men and women.
