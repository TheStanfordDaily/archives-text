Commitment to arts is not a one-time performance

CHRIS KAWAJA'S exasperated May
5 letter about The Daily's arts cov
erage on campus makes a legiti
mate point. I also hope for more substan
tive arts coverage. It takes time to devel
op insightful performance-art journalism,
the kind that entices the novice as well as
informs the veteran concert-goer. It
means finding student writers willing to
take on the arts beat. But first, The Daily
needs to decide to serve this sizable part
of the Stanford community. And it needs
to put muscle behind that choice in the
form of column-inches in each issue.
When the arts are not covered fully,
students mistakenly think they have not
happened or that the event has the
weight, heft or import of something
equivalently covered — say, a Frisbee
toss on the Quad. At Stanford, the
marginalizing written history does not
square with actual events. Talisman's
achievement is a case in point. It is a

shame if artistically talented students
choose not to attend Stanford simply
because real on-campus arts accomplish
ments have not achieved public-record
parity.
In my opinion, the campus arts scene
— original work by students — is robust,
if under-reported, despite relatively mea
ger funding. If Chelsea Clinton is inter
ested in dance, she will have to get up
early to enroll because classes are packed.
And if she has ability, then she will join
the good company of many Stanford
graduates currently touring nationally
and internationally in major dance com
panies (Stephanie Schaaf, Kristin
McDonald, Brenton Cheng), receiving
national awards and recognition for
choreography (Aleta Hayes, Lea Wolf)
and accepting tenure-track positions in
dance at major institutions (Susan Chion,
Wendy Rogers). It's also worth mention
ing the dean's awards for outstanding

work in dance / choreography given to
Lea Wolf and Heidi Schwieker. All of
these people did outstanding work during
their time at Stanford. They, too,
deserved campus-wide recognition as
their campus careers unfolded. None got
prolonged and extensive coverage. There
is no public record of their playing style,
their nicknames, their injuries, their tri
umphs.
The Daily has an opportunity here: To
take the lead and insist on in-depth
reporting on the Stanford arts scene. As
for my team, the Dance Division is seeing
the ball really well this year. Some of the
key team players emerging from the
ranks have been Sarah Margolis, Heidi
Schwieker, James Jhun, Anne Hsu and
Angela Amerillas. Outstanding teamwork
provided momentum in a 10-dancer rout
to Bartok's violin duos with crucial musi
cal assists by Yasmin Craig and Pamina
Kim. And then there was a memorable

five-player series of solo passes with an
outstanding show of kinetic wit by Heidi
Schweiker. No one was red-shirted
because the costume budget was too low.
The Stanford students I know — those
with appetite for art-making — have
compelling and dramatic stories. Surely
there are student writers who can focus
their abilities on campus arts. Mean
while, anyone who wants information
about dance events should e-mail major
domo@lists with the message "subscribe
jammix" or call the Dance Division 723-
1234. Don't wait until your junior year to
discover us. Or to discover music or
drama or studio art.
We're alive. We're kicking. And we are
one of the best underground conspiracies
that is going to enrich student life on the
Stanford campus. Come on, Daily. We're
worthy; make us a part of the news.
