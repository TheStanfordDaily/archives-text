# Apologies offered for Juice Club 'imposter'
## 
### 
In response to Rachel Kolman Mar
shak's Thursday column attacking the
Tresidder Union Jamba Juice, I would
like to offer a sincere apology to the
entire Stanford community for my role
in bringing the juice bar to Tresidder.
During the negotiations the Tresidder
Advisory Board conducted with Jamba
Juice, we took at face value the company's
assurance that, besides the name, little
would change from our beloved Juice Club
In the past few weeks, though, I have conn
to realize just how naive we were.
On a recent trip to Jamba Juice, I was
very disturbed by the absence of the
counter-top wheat-grass grinding that I,
like Marshak, remember so fondly from
the old Juice Club. Also, my girlfriend
tried to order a bet 1 pollen addition, only
to learn that it was no longer available.

My girlfriend was so upset we almost
broke lip over that Boysenberry Bliss.
Again, I apologize and promise to try
to work these details into Jamba Juice's
lease when it comes up for renewal.
