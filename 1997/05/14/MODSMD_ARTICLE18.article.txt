# Sawislak a model for academic excellence
## 
### 
We are pleased that you devoted con
siderable space to the upsetting news that
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak has
been denied tenure by the deans and that
a campaign is now underway to reverse
this decision. Having benefited from Saw
islak's superlative talents as a teacher
and mentor, we reacted to the news with
some bewilderment and much regret.
If the deans ever wish to observe a
masterful teacher at work, they should

attend one of Sawislak's graduate-level
seminars or colloquia. There they would
witness her intellectual dynamism and
her keen ability to stimulate thought
and guide discussion ever so skillfully.
Stanford should be proud to have a
teacher and mentor Sawislak's caliber
training its graduate students. The Histo
ry Department, a top-rated department
nationwide, has already recommended her
for tenure enthusiastically. Why the
administration has refused to do so war
rants discussion, but we can safely rule
out insufficient merit on Sawislak's part.
The deans have made a foolish decision
that should be protested by anyone com
mitted to academic excellence at Stanford.
