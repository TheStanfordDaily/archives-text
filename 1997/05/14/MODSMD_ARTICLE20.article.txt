## Pornography for everyone 
### 
A COUPLE OF weeks ago, I walked
into my local 7-Eleven and bought
one copy each of Penthouse and
Hustler for a Women's Center discussion
on pornography. Since then, these maga
zines have been the object of curiosity and
debate among my friends, some of whom
had never seen a porn mag or movie.
Porn has been a part of my life in one
way or another, and I'm still struggling to
figure out what I think about it. Because I
am a feminist, people assume I abhor it. I
don't. From my experience, many women
are caught in a Catch-22 about porn. If you
say you hate it, you'll be accused of being
an anti-sex, anti-free speech prude without
a sense of humor. If you say you like it or
that you don't mind it, people will assume
you don't care a whit about the objectiflca
tion of women in these magazines.
I advocate taking the discussion of
pornography out of the realm of free
speech for a few reasons. For one, banning
porn is reactionary and probably unconsti
tutional. Gloria Steinem makes a very con
vincing case when she argues that no
movie would ever be made glorifying Hitler
as a free speech hero, as one was of Hustler
publisher Larry Flynt. Still, what mainly
strikes me as I leaf through the pages of
Hustler is that the magazine couldn't be
happier to be seen as a poster-child for free
speech. Hustler, like Howard Stern, aims
to offend. It is racist, sexist, homophobic
and pretty damned pleased with itself, like
a smug kid rebelling against his parents.

It should be noted that the more main
stream porn mags — Playboy, Penthouse
— aren't as obviously raunchy as Hustler.
But make no mistake: "Tasteful" porn can
be just as offensive. Racism, sexism and
homophobia are still there in Penthouse,
just better hidden. You could flip through
the May 1997 issue, for example, and not
think twice about the fact that the only
African-American faces are mug shots of
O.J. Simpson and Divine Brown.
I know that most people aren't thinking
critically when they look at porn, and I
imagine that most people who read it could
care less about its politics. But it would be
a mistake to think that what porn looks
like, and what it says, doesn't somehow
affect our collective idea about who and
what is sexy.
If it were up to me, I wouldn't ban porn.
I'd reform it.
Pornography is a potentially destabiliz
ing force in society. It defines itself, by
nature, as a protest; it allows us to explore
what is forbidden by social norms and our
own cultural prudery. Yet as of now
women have no part in its creation. We are
more often the objects of someone else's
pornographic fantasies than the creators
of what could potentially be a liberating,
transformative public discourse on sexual
ity.
As a pro-sex feminist, I want to see porn
that does not insult my intelligence. And I
believe that if more women, especially
women of color, were consumers and ere

ators of pornography, it would be radically
different. (That's not to say that men are
incapable of creating non-offensive porn. It
is to say, however, that up to now they
haven't really questioned it all that much.)
Why aren't more women consumers of
porn? Well, for one, it projects the message
that sexual fantasy is only for men. And
because those fantasies — often degrading
and sometimes brutal fantasies — trickle
into our culture and influence the way the
whole culture thinks about sex and about
women. Even if you've never seen a porn
magazine, you probably know what thev
look like. They look eerily like a lot of
mainstream advertising, commercials and
movies but a little racier.
Think about it: We all know the stan
dard "male fantasies." These show up
again and again in porn and other places in
our culture. But what about women's fan
tasies? What are they? And more impor
tant, where are they?
Of all things, you'd think porn would
be one genre where women and men
could work together to create something
radically beautiful. But until that hap
pens, I will continue to think that pornog
raphy is not for me.
