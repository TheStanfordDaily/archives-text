# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## All the world's a stage, and we are merely Fools 
### 
YOU ASK ME why I love theater. I
shrug and say nothing — I have
no quip prepared, nothing pithy to
reply. You expect a rousing Shake
spearean monologue, complete with
slings and arrows and instead you get a
mediocre response with words like "fun"
and "exciting."
Here is my chance to elaborate.
This weekend is the opening weekend
of the Ram's Head production of the orig
inal musical comedy "Fool's Dream,"
billed as "a medieval story of gallant
princes, a beautiful princess, a wise
cracking barkeep and a host of other col
orful characters learning how to dream."
Over the course of the past two years, I
composed the music and helped create
the show (with alumnus Deron Sedy
writing the story), and I am currently
direct ing this production.
Needless to say, it is extremely "fun"
and "exciting" (as well as "wild" and
"exhausting") to be a part of "Fool's
Dream." First of all, the show is being
produced in a location where theater has
never been produced before, between

Gilbert Biological Sciences Building and
Herrin Hall. Second, it is a world pre
miere performance — this show has
never been performed before. In addition,
it is an outdoor show with a beautiful
stage and the audience spread out on
blankets beneath the stars. This is all def
initely both "fun" and "exciting." But,
I've recently realized, theater means
more that just fun and excitement to me.
Theater, for me, occupies a special
place in my heart. I'll show you the X
ray — it's lodged in there between the
left and right ventricles. The following
quote by Herb Gardner says it perfectly:
"In a theater, the ones in the dark and
the ones under the lights need each
other. For a few hours all of us, the audi
ence, the actors, the writer, we are all a
little more real together than we ever
were apart." There is something about
theater that, for lack of sounding trite,
makes us feel more alive.
Haven't you ever felt that way in a
theater? You see that by making the leap
of faith known as "suspension of disbe
lief," you are suddenly entrenched in a

story with characters and music nnd
drama until time just about disappears.
And you see that life makes a little more
sense once you're through. The emotions
we feel and the laughter we create are
shared between the ones in the dark and
the ones under the lights.
Although biologists would disagree, I
maintain that theater is alive. It is, and
will never be, precisely the same again.
Sure, the words may be approximately
the same and the melodies will not fal
ter and the curtain should rise and fall
at about the same time each night. But
every single night, every production
and every audience brings with it some
thing new and something unexpected.
There is something inspiring about
throwing away the safety net and tak
ing an audience on a journey where
anything can happen.
If theater is life, perhaps that is why I
enjoy aiding in its creation. And maybe,
you might argue, this thrill of "creating
life" is somewhat of a metaphorical God
complex, but I'd like to think that it's
something more. By creating theater, we

are creating the opportunity for an audi
ence to discover a little meaning in thou
own crazy lives and perhaps see them
selves in a slightly different light
And if "drama," as many would argue,
is about "characters who change" under
the lights, then theater is about an audi
ence that changes out in the dark.
"Fool's Dream" carries with it a mes
sage that I'd like to share with you.
Through music and comedy, the show
explores the notion that often the only
ones of us who feel that we have the
time to spend dreaming are either in
love or just plain foolish. We all have
work to be done and expectations of us.
We all have deadlines and problem sets
and parents who want us to be doctors.
"Fool's Dream" challenges us to "find a
dream or two" within ourselves and
maybe even accept the fact that being a
fool isn't so bad after all.
"Follow your heart and be part of a
Fool's Dream."
OK, maybe I'm getting preachy. And
maybe even a little hokey. I apologize for
that. The fact is, however, that when you

see something wondeiful, you want to
share it with everybody. Think of me as
your theatei missionary. Think of the
playbill as my hihle.
As your missionary, 1 am telling you to
value the stage and its magic. (!o see
"Fool's Dream." Hell, go see it twice. (Jo
see "Richard 111." There is a production
of "Falsettos" going up in a few weeks.
Branner is putting up a show. Lagunita is
doing "Bye Bye, Birdie."
A little theater overload? Perhaps. But
1 promise sou that if you go with an open
heart, yon II leave with something more
than just a program.

Jeremy Pcsmoti, a recent graduate in
public policy, will he at rehearsal and
performances of "Fool's Dream" this
week (i/ you happen to be looking for
him) To find him, go to Mercke (J recti
(west oj the Oval, between Gilbert and
Ileum Hall) May Id, 17, 22, 2,'i or 24.
