Sun's motion may explain cosmic axis

Albert Einstein posited that the universe has no
preferred frame or direction. A recent study challenges
this theory by suggesting that all directions in space
are not created equal and that the universe has an axis
pointing in the direction of the constellation Sextans.
Borge Nodland of the University of Rochester and
John Ralston of the University of Kansas discovered a
pattern of polarized radio waves from distant galaxies.

The amount of polarization of the radio waves varied depending on
how far the source galaxy lies from the proposed universal axis, but
the cause of these variations was unknown.
Two Stanford Starlab scientists now propose an explanation.
Electrical Engineering Profs. Emeritus Ronald Bracewell and Von
Eshleman believe that the sun's cosmological motion causes the
Nodland-Ralston effect, also known as "the up and down of the uni
verse."
Bracewell discovered in 1969 that the sun appears to be moving at
a speed of about 300 kilometers per second relative to the universe as
a whole. The motion of the sun creates an axis that points in about
the same direction as that found by the new study.
Bracewell and Eshleman point out that the authors of the new
study did not take the sun's motion into account when they analyzed
the polarized radio patterns from distant galaxies. The way in which
polarization vanes is also consistent with a velocity-related origin for
the proposed cosmic axis.
Exactly how the sun's motion could produce the observed polar
ization shifts is not immediately evident, but the similarity between
the pattern reported by Nodland and Ralston and the solar velocity
effect is too great to be coincidental, the Stanford scientists maintain.
"What is the likelihood of two cosmologically significant axes lying
in nearly the same direction? Pretty darned small," Eshleman said.

Open up and say aaahh

A Stanford study is now finding that the microbial population of

the mouth is not as well characterized as previously
thought. Medical student lan Kroes and Asst. Infec
tious Diseases Prof. David Relman are using molecular
techniques to assess what organisms are found in a
sample taken from between the tooth and gum of an
person with mild gingivitis.
It's "like flossing and using whatever comes out on
the floss," according to Kroes.

The sample is divided in half and the organisms found by the tra
ditional methods of identification are compared with those identified
by the molecular technique.
The traditional method relies on the cultivation of bacteria under
a range of conditions. Nearly sixty different bacterial strains were
identified in this way.
The molecular approach involves sequencing an amplified frag
ment of the bacterial ribosomal RNA gene, which provides a reliable
phylogenetic analysis of bacterial species. Using this method, 92 dif
ferent sequences were identified.
Thirty-four percent of the molecularly-typed sequences did not
match any of the bacterial sequences in the international DNA
database, implying that they had not been seen before. Some of these
sequences were so different to those in the database that they could
represent new bacterial species.
"What you find by direct amplification shows a different set to
what has been known before; with some overlap," Kroes said.
The use of molecular methods provides a new way of assessing
bacterial diversity and enables unculturable bacterial species to be
identified.
