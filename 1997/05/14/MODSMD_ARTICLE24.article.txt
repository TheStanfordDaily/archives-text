# Scientists study the causes of depression
## Depression cases are doubling every 10 years in industrial countries 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
In the past few years, a boun
ty of information has emerged
on the clinical expressions of
depression, as well as the com
plex biochemical processes that
underlies them.
Global studies of depression
Recently, the World Health
Organization and World Bank
brought the global burden of
unipolar major depression to the
attention of mental health pro
fessionals.
The organization has partici
pated in the Global Burden of
Disease Study, initiated in 1992,
that has discovered that the ill
ness represents an alarming
nonfatal disabling condition that
is predicted to grow in the next
20 years.
The study found that depres
sion, which in 1990 ranked as
the fourth most significant
cause of "burden" related to
mortality rates and quality of
living, will rise to second in
2020.
The findings, published in the
journal Science, suggest that
because of demographic and eco
nomic growth in developing
countries, it is likely that the
number of cases of depression
will increase as well.
The study is consistent with
others that have found that the
number of depression cases dou
ble about every 10 years in
industrial countries.
In the United States, suicide
is the third most common cause
of death among young adults
behind car accidents and homi
cides.
Biological basis of depression
Depression is now regarded
largely as a biological disorder,
rather than a purely psychologi
cal one.
It is known that depression
can be passed down in families.
For instance, if identical twins
are reared in different environ
ments and one develops a
depression disorder, it is likely
that the other will also.
At the cellular level, depres
sion is mediated by imbalances
in neurotransmitters, or chemi
cal messengers that transmit
signals between neurons. Specif
ic neurotransmitters such as
serotonin, norepinepharine and
dopamine are important in
major depression.
The most effective anti
depressant drugs work by
manipulating the action of these

neurotransmitters.
Much evidence has been
unearthed linking disturbed
behavior with neuroendocrine
disorders.
One biological system that
regulates hormone levels is
thought to play a pivotal role in
generating depressive symptoms
is called the Hypothalamic-Pitu
itary-Adrenal axis. The HPA
axis, which is self-regulatory, is
a system that influences psycho-

logical state and is known to be
hyperactive in depressed
patient.
One approach to investigating
the HPA axis utilizes noninva
sive techniques to examine
behavioral decisions in primates.
Depression can be thought of as
a disruption of normal behav
ioral routines and can arise from
disengaging from an activity too
quickly or persevering for too
long, which leads to frustration
and negative self-image.
In animal models, a common
approach is to use the attain
ment of food as measure of suc
cess or failure. Large imbalances
of the HPA axis occur when sub
jects disengage too readily, and
correlations can be drawn if
depression is viewed as a disen
gagement disorder mechanism.
A research group led by Psy
chology Prof. Alan Schatzberg
has made considerable advances
in the field and is now attacking
the central question of why the
axis becomes hyperactive and

what the exact consequences of
this hyperactivity are.
One member of the research
group, senior research scientist
David Lyons, stresses an inte
grated approach to analyzing
depression.
"A complete understanding of
major depressions will ultimate
ly require a developmental life
span perspective that integrates
genetic, biochemical and neuro
logical factors with social psy-

chological processes that lead
some individuals to collapse
under life stresses while others
seem unscathed," said Lyons.
Imaging studies reported
recently in the journal Nature
show that one portion of the
brain is significantly smaller and
less active in people suffering
from hereditary depression.
The researchers used
Positron Emission Tomography
scans, which measure how well
cells are functioning, to probe
the brains of patients exhibiting
depression.
They merged the results and
compared them with those from
normal patients and found a
subtle but distinct difference:
The subgenual prefrontal cortex
was significantly less active in
depressed patients than in
healthy patients.
Another imaging technique,
magnetic resonance imaging,
revealed that in these patients
there was on average about 40
percent less tissue in the affect-

Ed regions of the brain.
It is speculated that this
decrease may be due to the loss
of particular types of brain cells,
which researchers are now try
ing to identify.
Treatments for depression
Many studies have shown
that anti-depressants are highly
effective in alleviating many
symptoms of depression. About
80 percent of patients with
depressive disorders in the Unit
ed States can be treated success
fully, and the chances are high
that if patients fail to respond to
one type of anti-depressant, they
will respond to an another type.
Capturing the full glory of
stardom is a class of anti-depres
sants called selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors.
The inhibitors are popular
because they have the fewest
side effects and work by prevent
ing the reuptake of serotonin
into nerve cells, thus boosting
serotonin levels available in
synapses.
This class of drugs includes
Paxil, Zoloft and Prozac. Prozac,
now a household name, was
released to the American public
in 1988.
Since then its manufacturer
Eli Lilly, has reaped more than
$2 billion in returns, and its
stock has more than quadrupled.
Prozac is not a completely per
fect drug, though; it causes side
effects such as insomnia, sexual
difficulties and, in some cases,
increased appetite.
So what is new about anti
depressants? Recently, new
forms of anti-depressants geared
toward younger people are
under investigation, and Eli
Lilly has applied to market
Prozac for children. Such drugs
may elicit as much controversy
as Ritalin does for attention
deficit disorder.
Medications still need to be
developed for patients who do
not respond well to traditional
anti-depressants. Because of the
variety of psychotherapeutic
techniques available to treat
depression, it is found that the
most successful treatments
often achieve a balance between
psychotherapy and medication.
"Research in depression is
progressing rapidly," Schatzberg
said. "At Stanford, we are
involved in a variety of
approaches to understand the
pathophysiology of depression
and improve our approaches to
treatment. This study will help
us determine the optimum
approach in patients who are
chronically depressed."
