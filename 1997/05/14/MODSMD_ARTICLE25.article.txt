# New treatment may promise relief for sufferers of sleep apnea

### Charmain Tan 
For the 12 to 18 million Ameri
cans who suffer from obstructive
sleep apnea, a new therapy using
radio-frequency energy may hold
the promise of a good night's sleep.
Nelson Powell, co-director of the
Stanford Sleep Disorders and
Research Center, and his col
leagues have reported in the May
issue of the journal Chest that
radio-frequency energy can be used
to safely reduce the tongue volume
of research animals.
A current study shows that the
method can also be applied to
shrink the human soft palate tis
sue and appears to reduce heavy
snoring.
The next challenge will be to
determine if shrinking the human
tongue can reduce the incidence of
sleep apnea, a disorder in which
breathing stops temporarily during
sleep.
"We're approaching this in a sci
entific manner," Powell said.

"What we learn from the two earli
er studies will predicate the way we
treat our patients with sleep
apnea."
Obstructive sleep apnea syn
drome occurs in about 2 percent of
women and 4 percent of men in the
United States. It is characterized
by pauses in breathing during sleep
and is caused by the obstruction or
collapse of the upper airway due to
excess tissue in the tongue, tonsils,
nasal passages and soft palate.
During sleep, the throat mus
cles that hold open the upper respi
ratory airway relax and cause the
airway to narrow. In susceptible
individuals, this can lead to a col
lapse of the airway to the extent
that they stop breathing.
The cessation of airflow during
an apnea episode causes the brain
to rouse the sleeper to lighter levels
of sleep or to brief awakening. This
repeats as many as 200 to 400
times during six to eight hours of
sleep.
As a result, "it doesn't matter

how many hours of sleep these
patients get â€” they're always
tired," Powell said. "They cannot
go through all the stages of sleep
necessary for restfulness."
Sleep apnea affects the quality
of life of the patient and also has
severe consequences to a patient's
health. A report by the National
Commission on Sleep Disorders
Research estimates that "cardio
vascular deaths attributable to
obstructive sleep apnea alone
maybe as high as 38,000 annually."
Current methods of treatment
include removal of excess tissue by
surgery using scalpels or high-tem
perature lasers and electrocautery,
in which the extra tissue is burned
off. But these types of treatments
cause intense pain and discomfort
during recovery and have low suc
cess rates.
More commonly, the airways of
sleep apnea patients are artificially
held open by the delivery of contin
