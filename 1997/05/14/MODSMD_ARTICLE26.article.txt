Q a What is tofu, really, and
# how is it made?

A* Tofu is a soybean product
• that is an excellent veg
etable analogue to meat. It is
made from soy milk, and the pro
cess of making tofu is very similar
to that of making cheese. Its prop
erties make it a great ingredient in
cooking. Tofu provides protein
and all eight essential amino acids.
Tofu is sold in three basic
forms. There is firm tofu, which is
used for the majority of cooking.
It's firmness allows it to be
cooked without crumbling.
It can be used in anything from
chili to a filling in chocolate creme
pie. Seriously — just blend tofu
with cocoa and sugar! Soft, tofu is
best used in soups (as in the well
known Japanese miso soup). Silky

tofu has the consistency of custard
and can be eaten raw or mixed
with blended or pureed foods.
Tofu's properties make some
people consider it the potato of
the east. Look at all the ways
potatoes are prepared — baked,
fried, scalloped, whipped and
more. Similarly, depending on the
accompanying ingredients in
preparation, the flavor can be
remarkably different.
Tofu is made from soybeans.
Beans are selected based on their
ability to make good tofu. Raw soy
beans are soaked in water and
their hulls removed. Boiling water
is then poured over them as they
are mashed. This mush has the
consistency of mashed potatoes.

The mash is boiled for 10 min
utes, which breaks down an
enzyme in the beans and makes
the protein digestible to humans.
The solid is then filtered out of
the mixture.
The liquid that remains is
known as soy milk. People who are
lactose intolerant often drink this
as an alternative to cow's milk. It
is also the beginning of tofu.
A small amount of congealing
agent must be added to start the
process. The Chinese have tradi
tionally used calcium sulfate,
which is mined from quarries.
The Japanese have traditionally
used magnesium chloride, found
in sea salt.
After adding the congealing

agent, the soy milk separates into
— you guessed it — curds and
whey. The curds float on top of the
liquid. The whey is a clear liquid,
which is removed and given to
livestock. The curds are trans
ferred to a container with holes
lined with cheesecloth. The con
tainer is covered and a weight
placed on the lid.
The length of time the tofu
remains in this container depends
on the firmness of tofu desired.
The longer it remains inside, the
firmer it becomes.
As you can see, the processing of
soybeans produces little waste and
a nutritionally excellent product.
For vegetarians and vegans, tofu
am be the key to a balanced diet.

Tofu can be found in an amaz
ing array of foods. It is used in the
place of meat in many dishes,
from sandwiches to stew. It can
also be made to resemble familiar
products (meat and non-meat)
such as vegan bacon, tofu ice
cream and tofu jerky.
So next time someone
scrunches up their face at you
when you arc eatingyour healthy
serving of tofu, you can explain
to them all the benefits of eating
it. Besides, they've probably
eaten tofu without even knowing
it. Many meat eaters do not real
ize that what they assume is
chicken in many Chinese dishes
is actually tofu. So live it up —
eat some tofu!
