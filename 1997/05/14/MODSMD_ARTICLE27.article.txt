## Forget the NBA Stanley Cup packs punch 
### 
I loved watching Michael Jordan drop a double-nick
el against the Bullets in the first round of the NBA
playoffs. I enjoyed watching Karl Malone single
handedly destroy the Lakers this week with his physi
cal yet well-rounded game. And I loved watching the
Sonics and Rockets trade three-pointers down the
stretch of their overtime game last Saturday, until Matt
Maloney and Charles Barkley finished the Sonics off.

However, I have still been bored with the majority of
the NBA playoff games. In fact, the NBA playoffs are
not only less exciting than many of the programs I cur
rently watch on television, but they're not even the
most exciting sporting event happening right now.
This is not to say that I don't love basketball or that
I will quit watching the games, but the excitement gen
erated by this year's NBA playoffs has paled in com
parison to the intensity put forth by this year's quest
for the Stanley Cup.
That's right — hockey.
For the first time since high school (when I religious
ly followed the L.A. Kings), I am choosing to watch NHL
games instead of NBA games. For the first time in years,
I am talking Gretzky and Sakic instead of Jordan and
Ewing. And for the first time in years, I am excited
about a playoffs in a pro league other than the NFL.
Here, in no particular order, are some of the reasons
I have enjoyed the NHL so much this year and why I
encourage you to watch the conference finals that begin
in two days:
Better games: This one is fairly self-explanatory,
but to clarify, the games have not only been more excit
ing, but the competition has been tougher as well.
The NBA has only completed one full round of the
playoffs, but in that first round, half of the five-game
series were three-game sweeps. In addition, in the con
ference semifinals, which are nearing completion, none
of the seven-game series appear to be headed for more
than five games.
In contrast, the NHL, which has completed the first
two rounds of its playoffs, has had just one sweep in all
of it® series. What makes the NHL playoffs even better
is that even in the series that lasted just five games,
there was generally at least one sudden-death overtime
game. In all of its first 66 games, the NHL has seen a
total of 10 overtime games, three double-overtime
games and two triple-overtime games.
That's 15 games that all ended in dramatic fashion.
That's 15 games that ended in a split second and made
heroes out of some men and goats out of others. That's
