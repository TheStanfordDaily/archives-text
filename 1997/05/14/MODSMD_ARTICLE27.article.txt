## Forget the NBA Stanley Cup packs punch 
### 
I loved watching Michael Jordan drop a double-nick
el against the Bullets in the first round of the NBA
playoffs. I enjoyed watching Karl Malone single
handedly destroy the Lakers this week with his physi
cal yet well-rounded game. And I loved watching the
Sonics and Rockets trade three-pointers down the
stretch of their overtime game last Saturday, until Matt
Maloney and Charles Barkley finished the Sonics off.

However, I have still been bored with the majority of
the NBA playoff games. In fact, the NBA playoffs are
not only less exciting than many of the programs I cur
rently watch on television, but they're not even the
most exciting sporting event happening right now.
This is not to say that I don't love basketball or that
I will quit watching the games, but the excitement gen
erated by this year's NBA playoffs has paled in com
parison to the intensity put forth by this year's quest
for the Stanley Cup.
That's right — hockey.
For the first time since high school (when I religious
ly followed the L.A. Kings), I am choosing to watch NHL
games instead of NBA games. For the first time in years,
I am talking Gretzky and Sakic instead of Jordan and
Ewing. And for the first time in years, I am excited
about a playoffs in a pro league other than the NFL.
Here, in no particular order, are some of the reasons
I have enjoyed the NHL so much this year and why I
encourage you to watch the conference finals that begin
in two days:
Better games: This one is fairly self-explanatory,
but to clarify, the games have not only been more excit
ing, but the competition has been tougher as well.
The NBA has only completed one full round of the
playoffs, but in that first round, half of the five-game
series were three-game sweeps. In addition, in the con
ference semifinals, which are nearing completion, none
of the seven-game series appear to be headed for more
than five games.
In contrast, the NHL, which has completed the first
two rounds of its playoffs, has had just one sweep in all
of it® series. What makes the NHL playoffs even better
is that even in the series that lasted just five games,
there was generally at least one sudden-death overtime
game. In all of its first 66 games, the NHL has seen a
total of 10 overtime games, three double-overtime
games and two triple-overtime games.
That's 15 games that all ended in dramatic fashion.
That's 15 games that ended in a split second and made
heroes out of some men and goats out of others. That's

15 games that if you flipped to
another station, you probably
missed history being made.
So far, I can only think of three
games (Saturday's Sonics-Rockets
and Heat-Knicks games and Mon
day's Jazz-Lakers game) that have
had me sit anywhere near the edge
of my seat.
Less Complaining: One rea
son that the NBA playoffs have
become so ridiculous is that the
players and coaches are constantly
complaining about the referees. I
don't blame them, either, because
basketball is the sport most affect
ed by bad officiating, and the offici
ating in the NBA this year has
been horrible.
However, I believe that the
rhythm of this year's NBA games
has been severely hampered by
players' reactions to the bad calls.
Not one play goes uncomplained,
and even the superstars like Karl
Malone bitch about being fouled on
every shot (even ones they make).
It also seems like a shocking
majority of the fouls called are
accompanied by technical fouls for
the complaining. Essentially, it

seems the NBA officials have
begun a "buy one, get one free"
campaign for the playoffs.
The NHL, on the other hand,
does not have this problem — at
least not to the same extent. The
only major flaw with officiating
this year concerns the"in the
crease" rule, which is enforceable
by video replay. This is a problem
with the rules, though, and not the
referees, and is thus indisputable
on the ice.
Yes, officials on the ice miss calls
just like officials on the hardwood.
The game, however, isn't usually
interrupted by complaints about
the calls or extra penalties for
those players who are complaining.
Dennis Rodman: Enough said.
And finally:
Better conference finals: I
know most of you will find this
hard to believe, but the NHL con
ference finals will feature two
series that make the upcoming
Knicks-Bulls and Rockets-Jazz
series seem trite.
I speak of the Philadelphia Fly
ers-New York Rangers series, fea
turing some of the greatest hock
ey players ever to play the game,
and the Colorado Avalanche-
Detroit Red Wings series, which
will display sports' most intense
rivalry. While the Rangers-Flyers

series merits an entire column by
itself, it is the other final which
should be the series of the decade.
A little history is needed to
understand the Red Wings-
Avalanche rivalry. It all started in
last year's conference finals
(which the Avalanche won), when
Colorado's Claude Lemieux dis
pensed a jarring hit to Detroit's
Kris Draper, knocking Draper out
for the remainder of the year and
causing Draper to receive 40
stitches to his head and face. This
hit, which all of Detroit dubbed a
"cheap shot," intensified an
already bitter rivalry.
When the two teams met in
March, it was the first time since
the hit that Lemieux and Draper
were in the lineup for the game. In
that game, Detroit's Darren
McCarty immediately went after
Lemieux, beating him to a pulp and
igniting a series of brawls that
resulted in 18 fighting penalties,
144 penalty minutes and one heat
ed rivaliy.
There is no telling what the
seven-game series will hold, but I
can promise it will be one of the
most hard-fought playoff series of
this decade. And I will be glued to
the television set, watching every
minute, ignoring Karl Malone and
his bitching.
