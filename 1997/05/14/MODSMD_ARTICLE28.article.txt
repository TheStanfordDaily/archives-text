# Quota system hurts Title IX's intentions
## 
### 
Title IX was a good concept
with good intentions when
it was first introduced in
1972. But in the scramble for com
pliance, schools have enforced the
law unfairly. The way it is being
implemented at most schools, Title
IX has degenerated into a quota
system, which anyone can agree is
a misdirected method for change.

Consider this: According to a
recent gender-equity study by the
NCAA, college women have gained
more than 5,000 sports opportuni
ties in the past five years, while
men have lost 17,000.
And this is nondiscrimination?
It sounds to me more like prefer
ential treatment, which Title IX
expressly states is not required.
Stanford has been one of the
lucky ones. According to a recently
published report, the University
ranks among the nation's best in
Title IX compliance, with women
accounting for 50 percent of the
undergraduate population and 45
percent of the varsity athletes, a
mere 5-percent discrepancy. The
Athletics Department has
achieved this balance by adding
more varsity women's sports —
most recently, lacrosse, water polo
and synchronized swimming —
without eliminating any men's
programs.
Then again, with football gob
bling up 85 scholarships, varsity
men's sports like volleyball and
water polo (two of the school's
most perennially successful pro
grams) have been left with as few
as four scholarships to divvy up
among a much higher number of

athletes. (And the sword can cut
both ways; because of Title IX reg
ulations, four years ago Stanford
was forced to cut a popular,
women-only self-defense class
offered by a group called Women
Defending Ourselves.)
But men's sports have not been
so fortunate at most schools,
where more and more, administra
tors are opting to cut expensive,
non-revenue sports like gymnas
tics, wrestling, golf and water polo.
God forbid a school should cut
funding for football or basketball;
after all, those are the cash cows
that help fund the rest of the
department. (At Syracuse, which
boasts successful programs in foot
ball and men's hoops, those two
sports generate 98 percent of the
athletic revenue.)
The problem is that football
eats up more than twice as many
scholarships as any other sport,
with no equivalent sport for
women. The unfortunate conse
quence is that men who don't play
a sport involving a helmet and
shoulder pads get the shaft. And
where is the fairness in that?
The intent of Title IX is undeni
ably just, but by forcing schools to
operate on a quota system, it fails
to take into consideration both the
interests and the abilities of stu
dents. The question basically boils
down to this: Should a school be
obligated to fill its varsity rosters
with equal numbers of men and
women when more men than
women want to participate?
If there are more men who
want to participate, it hardly
seems fair that they should have to
compete for the scraps left over
after all the women (and football
players) have been accommodated.
Granted, Title IX was enacted
under the implicit assumption
that women will play sports in
equal numbers as men if given the
opportunity.
The problem is that the oppor


Bobby
Cuza
tunities for women are now begin
ning to outpace their interest and
ability. Maybe one day sports like
women's water polo will reach the
same level of interest and partici
pation as men's water polo, but for
now, they haven't.
As Maureen Mahoney points
out in the May 5 issue of Sports
Illustrated, we should employ the
same logic that keeps us from
banning collegiate dance pro
grams that are 90 percent women
or engineering programs that are
70 percent male. It would be
nothing short of ludicrous to sug
gest that a school receiving appli
cations from 75 qualified female
dancers and 25 qualified male
dancers should accept equal num
bers of each into a 50-member
program.
This is not to say that there has
been no progress in women's ath
letics; to the contrary, since the

creation of Title IX, more and more
female athletes of all ages are par
ticipating in sports. But when
nondiscrimination against women
is being achieved by discrimination
against men, another solution has
to be devised.
Maybe the changes don't need
to be made at the top. The ratio of
male to female athletes in high
school is still roughly two to one; to
go from those kinds of numbers at
the high school level to 50/50 at the
college level is to eliminate oppor
tunities for thousands of men.
Why not implement equality at the
lower levels, and watch the effects
filter up rather than down?
The bottom line is that two
wrongs don't make a right. No one
is arguing that women should not
receive the same opportunities as
men in college athletics. But there
is an inherent difficulty in a policy
that forces schools to eliminate
opportunities rather than enhance
them. Equal opportunity comes
from well-reasoned, fair-minded
policies — not from numerical for
mulas.
