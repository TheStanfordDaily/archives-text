# Seniors inseparable on and off course

### Yi-Wyn Yen Staff writer 
In 1993, the Stanford women's golf team got
rained out at a Hawaii tournament. While the team
spent the day at the hotel, freshman golfers Mhairi
McKay and Andrea Baxter went out and rented
surfboards.
The high tides and heavy rains off Waikiki Beach
did not discourage the two, neither of whom had
surfed before.
"Those two hammerheads surfed out to where
the freighter lines were," said former coach Tim
Baldwin.
McKay and Baxter, now seniors, laugh over their
zany antics off the links. Best friends and room
mates, they have developed a friendship that has
complemented their golfing careers.

"We feed off of each other's fun-loving nature,
enthusiasm and determination," McKay said.
Both players have won tournaments while at
Stanford as well as received first-team All-America
honors. They are nationally ranked in the top five.
The two friends camp in Yosemite, ski on week
ends and squabble over who's a better bowler.
McKay, whose hometown is in Scotland, has spent
the past four Thanksgivings at Baxter's home in
Idaho.
"My friends and I give each other clothes and
stuff for birthday gifts. They're so much closer,"
said freshman teammate Jenny Pippin. "They give
each other gifts that show they're on a whole differ
ent level. It's almost like they're one person."
For their birthdays this year, they exchanged a
barbecue grill and pizza oven. They throw dinner
parties for their teammates and the men's golf
team.
"They had this pizza- making party that turned
into a total disaster," Pippin said. "The dough got
stuck all over the counter."
Baxter and McKay like to joke, have water fights
and play tricks on each other, but on the course, it's
all about golf.
In high school, Baxter played varsity basketball
and golf, where she took both teams to the state
championship. At the 1993 Idaho girls' basketball
state championship, Baxter's team was down by
one point in the last four seconds. Baxter dribbled
the length of the court to sink a game-winning shot
39-38.
"She's so competitive and loyal. She'll never let
her teammates down," said Baldwin, who has kept
track of Baxter's golfing career since she was 13. "If
I was ever in a war, I'd want Andrea in the foxhole
next to me."
Baxter plays golf with as much prowess as she
plays basketball.
A native of Eagle, Idaho, she used to practice at
the Eagle Hills Golf Course, where she played from
the white tees with the neighborhood boys. She'd
beat them all. In junior tournaments, most players
would drive their ball 200 yards. Baxter's balata
would fly 270 yards.
But Baldwin was more impressed with Baxter's
maturity and how she carried herself on the course
than her physical strength. While others would
curse and throw their clubs after making bad shots,

Baxter always appeared focused and consistent. She
walked with a steady pace and with her chin up.
"You ain't tell by her expression how she's play
ing, whether she's 3 under or over," said head
coach Caroline O'Connor.
The shy and modest senior has difficulty talking
about her accomplishments. Tlu; only sign of Bax
ter's athletic abilities is a photo of herself jumping
off a '20-foot cliff. The avid skier snowboarded for
the first time last quarter. She broke her wrist that
weekend, which forced her to sit out a majority of
this season.
But Baxter's adventurous spirit suggests her
love to take risks, on or off the course. McKay, also

a gambler, plays with an aggres
siveness on the links. When she
plays the dogleg lefl seventh at the
Stanford golf course, she hooks
her tee shot over the three huge
oak trees.
"I've never seen any other col
lege golfer do that," Baldwin said,
"Everyone else plays it conserva
tively."
When Baldwin was head coach
at Stanford, he was constantly
bombarded with coaches from
around the world sending him
newspaper clippings about their
players. Most of the time, he didn't
bother with those recruits.
But then one day, McK.ay's
next-door neighbor from Glasgow,
Scotland, came to Stanford to visit
his daughter. The stranger showed
up at Baldwin's office to talk to him
about McKay.
"He didn't come with newspa
per articles. He pulled out maga

zines," Baldwin said. "One of them
was a profile about Mhairi in Golf
Digest of Great Britain."
She came into Stanford with
more experience and accolades
than most college golfers. McKay
played the 1994 Curtis Cup Ama
teur Matches, representing Scot
land as the youngest player at the
time. Golf Foundation named her
Most Promising Girl Golfer of 1990
after she won the British and Scot
tish girls' championship that year.
Golf pro Tony Jacklin said she was
the most talented teen since
Spain's Seve Ballesteros, a two
time Masters Champion.
When McKay gives her ball a
hefly wallop, it explodes off her
clubhead.
"The men's team used to just
watch and marvel at her swing.
They'd ooh and aah, even Tiger
Woods," Baldwin said. "She's got
such a perfect, smooth swing."
While the two will play their last
tournament together as a team
mates next week, it will not be the
last time they play together as
friends.
