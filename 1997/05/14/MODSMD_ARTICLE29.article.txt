# Seniors inseparable on and off course

In 1993, the Stanford women's golf team got
rained out at a Hawaii tournament. While the team
spent the day at the hotel, freshman golfers Mhairi
McKay and Andrea Baxter went out and rented
surfboards.
The high tides and heavy rains off Waikiki Beach
did not discourage the two, neither of whom had
surfed before.
"Those two hammerheads surfed out to where
the freighter lines were," said former coach Tim
Baldwin.
McKay and Baxter, now seniors, laugh over their
zany antics off the links. Best friends and room
mates, they have developed a friendship that has
complemented their golfing careers.

"We feed off of each other's fun-loving nature,
enthusiasm and determination," McKay said.
Both players have won tournaments while at
Stanford as well as received first-team All-America
honors. They are nationally ranked in the top five.
The two friends camp in Yosemite, ski on week
ends and squabble over who's a better bowler.
McKay, whose hometown is in Scotland, has spent
the past four Thanksgivings at Baxter's home in
Idaho.
"My friends and I give each other clothes and
stuff for birthday gifts. They're so much closer,"
said freshman teammate Jenny Pippin. "They give
each other gifts that show they're on a whole differ
ent level. It's almost like they're one person."
For their birthdays this year, they exchanged a
barbecue grill and pizza oven. They throw dinner
parties for their teammates and the men's golf
team.
"They had this pizza- making party that turned
into a total disaster," Pippin said. "The dough got
stuck all over the counter."
Baxter and McKay like to joke, have water fights
and play tricks on each other, but on the course, it's
all about golf.
In high school, Baxter played varsity basketball
and golf, where she took both teams to the state
championship. At the 1993 Idaho girls' basketball
state championship, Baxter's team was down by
one point in the last four seconds. Baxter dribbled
the length of the court to sink a game-winning shot
39-38.
"She's so competitive and loyal. She'll never let
her teammates down," said Baldwin, who has kept
track of Baxter's golfing career since she was 13. "If
I was ever in a war, I'd want Andrea in the foxhole
next to me."
Baxter plays golf with as much prowess as she
plays basketball.
A native of Eagle, Idaho, she used to practice at
the Eagle Hills Golf Course, where she played from
the white tees with the neighborhood boys. She'd
beat them all. In junior tournaments, most players
would drive their ball 200 yards. Baxter's balata
would fly 270 yards.
But Baldwin was more impressed with Baxter's
maturity and how she carried herself on the course
than her physical strength. While others would
curse and throw their clubs after making bad shots,

Baxter always appeared focused and consistent. She
walked with a steady pace and with her chin up.
"You ain't tell by her expression how she's play
ing, whether she's 3 under or over," said head
coach Caroline O'Connor.
The shy and modest senior has difficulty talking
about her accomplishments. Tlu; only sign of Bax
ter's athletic abilities is a photo of herself jumping
off a '20-foot cliff. The avid skier snowboarded for
the first time last quarter. She broke her wrist that
weekend, which forced her to sit out a majority of
this season.
But Baxter's adventurous spirit suggests her
love to take risks, on or off the course. McKay, also
