## 
### Douglas Cajas 
After reading more than 65 nominations,
an ASSU committee presented Assoc. Art
Prof. Jody L. Maxmin with its second annu
al teaching award. Honorable mentions
were given to Biochemistry Prof. A. Dale
Kaiser and Keith Leonard, a teaching assis
tant in the English Department.
The recipient of the award is nominated
and selected solely by students. A committee
of six ASSU senators began accepting nomi
nations via the World Wide Web in early
April.
The award was designed to recognize "ex
traordinary teaching and contributions be
yond the call of duty," said ASSU Senator
Doug Natelson.
When asked about the award, Maxmin
said, "I didn't even know there was one."
"I was flabbergasted," added Maxmin,
who received the exciting news as she was
frantically preparing for lecture.
She said she felt at ease experimenting
and teaching creatively — the very reasons
for which she was chosen as the recipient of
the award — because of a special Stanford
classroom atmosphere.
In contrast to other friends who teach at
East Coast schools, Maxmin said she feels
"there is something of a safety net to try new
things" at Stanford. Here, she is met with
"pedagogical and intellectual excitement"
as she enters the classroom — what she calls
the "friendly laboratory."

"She exhibits a real concern for the indi
vidual student," said Sylvia Wohlmut, se
nior administrator in the Art Department,
who was delighted to hear of Maxmin's
award. "She is on their side and will go the
extra mile to help them understand. Her en
thusiasm for her subject inspires them."
The winner of the teaching award re
ceives a $500 cash prize. Each member of
the committee read each nomination and
drew his or her own list of possibilities. After
many hours, with a narrowed list in hand,
committee members discussed until consen
sus was reached.
Natelson described Maxmin's recom
mendations as "remarkably glowing." One
student called her teaching "a bold stroke of
genius."
Another nomination wrote that Maxmin,
nominated for her work in the course "Clas
sical and Hellenistic Art," "single-handedly
handed me the Stanford experience on a
fifth-century bronze plate."
Kaiser and Leonard, nominated for
their classes "Biochemical Structure, Me
tabolism and Energetics" and "20th Cen
tury African-American Fiction," respec
tively, also received particularly strong
comments.
Natelson said some possible improve
ments for the award process include better
publicity and perhaps including a non-
ASSU member on the committee. Last year,
the award went to Charles Marcus, an assis
tant physics professor.
