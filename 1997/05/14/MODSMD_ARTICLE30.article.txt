Despite a strong team performance
at the West Coast Cycling Conference
Championships, Stanford cycling was
unable to move past Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo or UC-Santa Barbara in
the WCCC overall standings, finish

The performances are even more
impressive in light of the pair's
responsibilities as race directors.

"Never in six years and in over 30
races have I seen directors race as well
as Pete and Cynthia did, especially at
championships," Walker said. "Though
neither had season-best races, they def

putting on the entire show."
In the men's B race, graduate stu

placewinner, finishing in ninth. Stan
