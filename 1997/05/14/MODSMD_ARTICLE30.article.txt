# Card finishes third at WCCC Championship
## 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
Despite a strong team performance
at the West Coast Cycling Conference
Championships, Stanford cycling was
unable to move past Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo or UC-Santa Barbara in
the WCCC overall standings, finish
ing the season in third place. Stan
ford's 52-point deficit going into the
championships proved to be too much
to overcome as it ended up five points
out of second place.

"That margin is small, especially in
view of the fact that we started far
behind," said head coach Art Walker.
"I'm well satisfied that this team was
better than UCSR. While I'm a bit dis
appointed at finishing third, I'm
proud that we beat them this week
end with the added pressure of run
ning the event."
With the strong performance at
WCCCs, Stanford qualified for
nationals, which take place May 24-25
in Durango, Colo.
Graduate student Pete Armitage

and medical student Cynthia Fergu
son led the Cardinal with solid perfor
mances. Armitage scored in the
priems, took third in the weekend
omnium, took eighth in the men's A
road race and was on the second-place
men's A time trial team. Ferguson
took second in the women's A road
race, took third in the women's A sea
son omnium and was on the second
place women's A time trial team.
The performances are even more
impressive in light of the pair's
responsibilities as race directors.

"Never in six years and in over 30
races have I seen directors race as well
as Pete and Cynthia did, especially at
championships," Walker said. "Though
neither had season-best races, they def
initely did their best under the stress of
putting on the entire show."
In the men's B race, graduate stu
dent Scott Crawford was the only
placewinner, finishing in ninth. Stan
ford senior Tom Dillon, in his last col
legiate race, took third in the men's C
*ace after placing second in the
.wo priems. Also in men's C, lavs
student Brian Moore took 11th ir
he road race but did well enough
n the priems to earn an overall
ourth-place finish for the week
md. The Stanford men's C team
jutscored all other teams in the
competition.
In women's B division, law stu
dent Marie Kirk placed fourth ir
the criterium and earned a third
place finish in the road race.
"Kirk gave an extremely solid
pair of performances," Walker
said. "She has earned herself a
chance to go to nationals and has
a good chance at placing and scor
ing points. As a first-year rider,
she has turned out to be quite a
pleasant surprise."
In women's A, graduate stu
dent Megan Troxell won the cri
terium by more than a half of a
lap margin and took fourth in the

road race. Ferguson was also
impressive in the road race, tak
ing second. Overall, the Stanford
women outscored all other teams,
capturing 59 of 200 points.
In men's A division, Armitage
and graduate student Russell
Mead scored in priems, finishing
seventh and eighth. UCLA's Keith
Henderson, a national criterium
winner, won the road race. Win
ners for Stanford were graduate
student Dario Falquier in sixth,
Armitage in eighth and graduate
student Dave Bailey in 11th.
In men's D, Stanford had three
placewinners. Senior Andrew
Price took fourth and graduate
students Jan Duha and Omar
Leung took sixth and ninth,
respectively. In men's C, graduate
student Ted Manning took
fourth.
In team time trials, the
women's A and men's A teams
both finished second. The women
were behind California by 19 sec
onds, and the men finished in
back of UC-San Diego by a mere 5
seconds.
