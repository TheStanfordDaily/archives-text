# Gender equity in Athletics

Title DC is a 1972 law that bans
discrimination based on sex at
any school that receives federal
funds. It mandates that the gen
der makeup of athletic programs
(both scholarship and non-schol
arship athletes) "substantially
mirrors" that of the student body.
Since its passage 25 years ago,
countless arguments have been
offered, both extolling its virtues
and emphasizing its flaws.
In 1992, female athletes at
Brown University in called into
question for the first time
whether a school was operating
under the guidelines. Representa
tives from the women's gymnas
tics and volleyball teams alleged
discrimination after Brown had
withdrawn funding for the two
sports as well as the men's golf
and water polo squads.
That litigation was first ruled
on by a district court, which sided
with the athletes and restored the
two women's sports. Brown
appealed the decision all the way
to the Supreme Court, which just
last month declined to hear the
appeal, effectively upholding the
lower court's position.

The decision sends a shock
wave across the face of college
athletics. Many in college athlet
ics felt Brown — the first school
with a women's hockey team
had among the nation's most
equitable sports programs. With
the program deemed in violation,
the standard of equity has effec
tively been raised and pressure
will be increased for schools to
fund more women's sports with
out cutting men's.
The Department of Educa
tion's Office of Civil Rights deter
mines if a school is in compliance
with the law by testing three cri
teria. One is the proportionality
of the percentage of female ath
letes to the percentage of female
undergraduates. But a college is
in compliance if it completely
meets the needs and abilities of its
female athletes or demonstrates a
history of program expansion for
female athletes.
Stanford was shown in a
recently published study as one of
the schools most in compliance
with Title DC guidelines, achiev
ing proportionality to within 5
percent.
