# Benefits of Title IX undeniably valuable
## 
### 
Although Title IX was passed
in 1972 no one paid much
attention to it until 1992,
when Brown University dropped
two women's sports programs. The
women sued on the basis of Title IX
and won, bringing the law into the
spotlight and creating a stir among
athletic programs everywhere.

Suddenly compliance with Title
IX's guidelines, which in a nutshell
say that the percentage of female
athletes at a university should mir
ror the percentage of female under
graduates, became a big deal. Com
pliance is what's been called the
proportionality test, and it means
being within 5 percentage points of
the undergraduate percentage.
The problem arises when
schools begin to cut men's pro
grams to obtain compliance rather
than seeking other alternatives. I
happen to believe that Title IX has
done a lot for women's sports over
the past decade, but I most defi
nitely do not think it is a good thing
when "minor sports" such as
men's gymnastics and wrestling
get cut from school programs.
There are other methods of
compliance. Schools can also be in
compliance if they fully meet the
needs and abilities of their female
athletes or show a history of pro
gram expansion for female ath
letes. Hut schools say they don't
have enough money, and rather
than risk the chance of facing law
suits from disgruntled female ath
letes, they cut the men's programs.
Attention athletic programs:
This is not the best solution.
Be creative and find other ways

to raise money. Stanford has done
it. Programs such as field hockey
participate in stadium cleanups
and ushering at revenue-producing
sporting events to get money for
their program. It may not be fair to
those athletes who have to partici
pate in extra activities while bas
ketball and football players don't.
But life's not fair. You also have to
consider that these sports are actu
ally making money for the school,
and any alternative, even forcing
some athletes to put in the extra
work to make a buck, is better than
hacking away at other programs.
Then there's the always unpop
ular solution of cutting football
scholarships. That likely doesn't
sound tfood to the athletic depart
ment or the football program
because football produces more
revenue than any other sport.
The NCAA currently allows 85
scholarships for Division I football
programs, and many argue that
teams would do as well with small
er numbers that are closer to those
of the NFL. They say if the NFL
can do it, so can colleges; besides,
most scholarship players do not go
on to professional careers.
Here's a quick reminder guys â€”
college is not the NFL. Coaches
can't make trades or pick up free
agent players in midseason. There
are also many more college football
programs than NFL teams, hut
that doesn't mean we should start
handing out scholarships based on
an athlete's chance of making a
professional team. Believe it or not,
college is still a little more than a
stepping stone to the pros, and
many collegiate athletes have
prominent careers to the benefit of
their res [Motive programs without
ever becoming pro athletes.
At this point you may be think
ing (as I was) where's the positive
side to all this? Athletic programs
are having difficulty reaching com
pliance with Title IX, men's pro
grama an* being cut, people are
