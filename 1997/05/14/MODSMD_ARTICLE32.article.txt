# Benefits of Title IX undeniably valuable
## 
### 
Although Title IX was passed
in 1972 no one paid much
attention to it until 1992,
when Brown University dropped
two women's sports programs. The
women sued on the basis of Title IX
and won, bringing the law into the
spotlight and creating a stir among
athletic programs everywhere.

Suddenly compliance with Title
IX's guidelines, which in a nutshell
say that the percentage of female
athletes at a university should mir
ror the percentage of female under
graduates, became a big deal. Com
pliance is what's been called the
proportionality test, and it means
being within 5 percentage points of
the undergraduate percentage.
The problem arises when
schools begin to cut men's pro
grams to obtain compliance rather
than seeking other alternatives. I
happen to believe that Title IX has
done a lot for women's sports over
the past decade, but I most defi
nitely do not think it is a good thing
when "minor sports" such as
men's gymnastics and wrestling
get cut from school programs.
There are other methods of
compliance. Schools can also be in
compliance if they fully meet the
needs and abilities of their female
athletes or show a history of pro
gram expansion for female ath
letes. Hut schools say they don't
have enough money, and rather
than risk the chance of facing law
suits from disgruntled female ath
letes, they cut the men's programs.
Attention athletic programs:
This is not the best solution.
Be creative and find other ways

to raise money. Stanford has done
it. Programs such as field hockey
participate in stadium cleanups
and ushering at revenue-producing
sporting events to get money for
their program. It may not be fair to
those athletes who have to partici
pate in extra activities while bas
ketball and football players don't.
But life's not fair. You also have to
consider that these sports are actu
ally making money for the school,
and any alternative, even forcing
some athletes to put in the extra
work to make a buck, is better than
hacking away at other programs.
Then there's the always unpop
ular solution of cutting football
scholarships. That likely doesn't
sound tfood to the athletic depart
ment or the football program
because football produces more
revenue than any other sport.
The NCAA currently allows 85
scholarships for Division I football
programs, and many argue that
teams would do as well with small
er numbers that are closer to those
of the NFL. They say if the NFL
can do it, so can colleges; besides,
most scholarship players do not go
on to professional careers.
Here's a quick reminder guys —
college is not the NFL. Coaches
can't make trades or pick up free
agent players in midseason. There
are also many more college football
programs than NFL teams, hut
that doesn't mean we should start
handing out scholarships based on
an athlete's chance of making a
professional team. Believe it or not,
college is still a little more than a
stepping stone to the pros, and
many collegiate athletes have
prominent careers to the benefit of
their res [Motive programs without
ever becoming pro athletes.
At this point you may be think
ing (as I was) where's the positive
side to all this? Athletic programs
are having difficulty reaching com
pliance with Title IX, men's pro
grama an* being cut, people are

talking about changing the num
ber of football scholarships — is it
really all worth it?
The answer, I think, is yes.
Some schools have found ways to
be in compliance without making
any drastic cuts or changes in
men's programs. If they can do it,
so can others. And the one thing
that absolutely cannot be over
looked is what Title IX has done
for women's athletics.
No matter how macho-oriented
you are, you can't be affiliated with
Stanford and not realize how
prominent women's athletics has
become in the last decade. The bas
ketball team draws almost as well
as the prominent men's teams in
the Bay Area, and with two nation
al championships and four addi
tional Final Fours in the 1990s is
undeniably the most successful
collegiate basketball program,
male or female, in the area.
Women's volleyball, mean
while, outdraws Stanford's men's
team, and although both won
national titles this year, the
women have three in the '90s
while the men's title was their

first. But the point here isn't to
point out which women's teams
are doing better than their respec
tive men's teams.
All I'm trying to say is that Stan
ford's women's programs are very
competitive on the national level,
and that's not something you get
by being lucky. It takes money to
establish a successful program in
any sport, male or female. Simply
put, the money has to be there first
— for recruiting; facilities, equip
ment and so forth — before the
program can get off the ground.
And without Title IX, I don't
think most schools would have
invested a great deal in women's
programs. There's no denying that
schools have made a conscious
effort to put more money into
women's programs since Title IX.
And just look what's happened.
Three Stanford basketball play
ers just signed contracts to play
professional basketball — three
women. Without Title IX Stan
ford's Brevin Knight would
undoubtedly still be heading to the
NBA once the league has its draft
this summer, but I'm not so sure
Kate Starbird, Jamila Wideman
and Charmin Smith would be able
to boast the same of their respec
tive leagues.
Title IX is not the perfect solu

tion. I'm not so sure one exists. It
has its problems, and someone
should find solutions for those
problems. But don't tell me it
should be thrown away or com
plain about all the men's sports
that are suffering because of it. I
happen to believe that the benefits
far outweigh the negative aspects
for collegiate athletic programs.
In my search for information on
Title EX, I came across some inter
esting feedback from ESPN Sport
szone users. All of them were from
men, and most reminded me why
someone thought we needed Title
IX to begin with.
My favorite comes from Ron
White of Coral Springs, Fla.
"Women's sports are nothing
but a drain on the coffers of the
university's athletic program,"
White said. "When women's athlet
ics start pulling in money instead of
just spending it, then and only then
should they be entitled to equal
amounts of money and / or scholar
ships. Most students' apathy is so
complete in regards to women's
athletics that most schools don't
charge admission to the events. If
people aren't going to watch,
what's the point of even having the
sports in the first place?"
Thanks, Ron, for reminding me
what's really important in athletics.
