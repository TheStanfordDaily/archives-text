# Junior makes most of SEAL experience
## 
### Tiffany Poremba 
Before junior Mitch Munt made it to Stan
ford, he had already been to hell and back.
Eight years ago, with only two to three hours
of sleep a night for an entire week, Munt and 23
other soldiers were awakened by flash grenades
and blaring guns and marched to the ocean in the
middle of the night.
Forced to walk into the ocean, the men were
then commanded to sit so the water was level
with their necks. Not until hypothermia began to
set in were they allowed back on shore to sit by
the fire, only to be ordered back into the freezing
ocean when they were beginning to get warm.
This cycle continued all night.
This "surf torture," as Munt called it, is part
of "Hell Week," one week of an eight-month
training program used by the Navy to weed out
those who can't make it in the SEALs, its special
strategic unit and one of the most elite fighting
forces in the world.
Half of the best in the Navy don't make it
through the training, but Munt did.
Since becoming a SEAL in 1989, Munt said he
has fought a war, jumped from planes and had six
surgeries for various injuries. Doing an about
face, Munt, 27, is now a Stanford undergraduate

majoring in public policy and a happily married
man.
Munt was not always so successful. A less
than serious student in high school, his father
jokingly referred to him as a "juvenile delin
quent."
According to both father and son, when Munt
made the SEALs, everything changed.
Now, however, his father, Marshall, said,
"some parents have to worry about their chil
dren, but with Mitch I don't.
"The SEALs' training stretches you well-be
yond your perception of your abilities," he added.
"If you survive that, it opens your eyes to see that
anything is possible."
Far from his high school mishaps, Munt
transferred this year to Stanford.
"I think I have to work harder than the aver
age Stanford student, but it's worth it. ... I feel
very lucky to be here," Munt said.
Munt credited the SEALs for his success, call
ing it a "100 percent positive experience."
He explained, "If I hadn't been a SEAL, I
would not have made it into Stanford, and I
would have never met my wife. Before, life was
just a big party."
In his seven years in the military, Munt trav
eled the world from Somalia to Australia to the

Middle East, where he saw the start of the Gulf
War and later trained Kuwait's Special Forces.
After four years of service, Munt's career with
the SEALs came to an end. While parachuting in
Guam in 1993, Munt was injured when the im
pact of the jump shattered his knees, leaving him
unable to perform his military duties.
Munt spent a year in the SEALs attempting to
recover from his injuiy. He received a medical
discharge when he failed to recover the strength
necessary to survive as a SEAL.
"This was the toughest time I've had yet,"
Munt said about his injury. "I hate not being able
to do all the cool-guy things I used to do."
Unsurprisingly, for a man who calls his per
sonal code one of perseverance, Munt was not
daunted. Ayear after his injury he enrolled in Or
ange Coast Community College, where he led —
as team captain — his crew team to national dis
tinction, Munt said.
Recruited by Stanford, Munt had planned to
continue in crew but was never able to rohere,
as his knee injuries flared up again.
"I wish I could still row, but it doesn't look like
my body can take it,"he said.
Munt is uncertain of his future plans. With
characteristic optimism he said, "If I apply my
self, I'll be successful."
