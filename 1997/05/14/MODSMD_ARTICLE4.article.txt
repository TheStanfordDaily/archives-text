Project hopes to make the issue ofliteracy
more salient to the public through a host of
events organized for Literacy, Language
and Culture Week.
Pi i grams began on Monday and will
bring a variety of guest speakers to campus
throughout the week.
The primary objective of the literacy im

program and is currently leading one of the
tutor training workshops. She is scheduled
to speak tonight at 7 in the El Centro Chi
