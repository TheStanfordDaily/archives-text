The Stanford Literacy Improvement
Project hopes to make the issue ofliteracy
more salient to the public through a host of
events organized for Literacy, Language
and Culture Week.
Pi i grams began on Monday and will
bring a variety of guest speakers to campus
throughout the week.
The primary objective of the literacy im
provement project is to teach University
employees basic oral and written skills.
The range of student ability varies from
those that are unable to read in their native
language to those that can barely manage
in daily activities.
The week-long program — now in its
third year — is dedicated to making stu
dents aware ofliteracy and the cultural is
sues surrounding it on campus. "We would
like to expand our program to serve more
people in the community, but it seems that
more people tend to get involved in groups
that tutor children," said sophomore

Rachel Brunette.
The first speaker of the series was Edu
cation Prof. Amado Padilla, who gave a talk
last night in the Casa Zapata lounge. Padil
la discussed biculturalism, a topic he re
searches widely. Biculturalism focuses on
people who are struggling with a bicultural
identity and on the potential social and lin
guistic problems encountered by them.
Also speaking this week are Education
Prof. Kenji Hakuta — who will give a talk
tomorrow on the importance of bilingual
education — and Susana Van Bezooijen.
Van Bezooijen is a Bay Area consultant
for the teaching of English as a second lan
guage. Her lecture will make up a critical
component of the project training pro
gram. In the past, Van Bezooijen has pro
vided numerous teaching strategies for the
program and is currently leading one of the
tutor training workshops. She is scheduled
to speak tonight at 7 in the El Centro Chi
cano Conference Room.
The program aims to make an impact on
the battle against illiteracy and to
recruit additional tutors. One of
the coordinators, junior Vincent
Cheung, said, "Stanford seems
like the least likely place where lit
eracy would be of concern, but it is
a real and important factor on

campus. This program hopes not
only to teach but to foster person
al interactions with the learners."
The project was founded 11
years ago as a University-run pro
gram with an appointed staff
member as head. Due to insuffi
cient funding however, the orga
nization was handed down in
1990 to the dominion of the stu
dents.
Although less structured now,

the project continues to be stu
dent-run and has obtained fund
ing from several sources includ
ing the ASSU. The head coordina
tors of the program include Che
ung, Brunette, junior Becka Liv
ermore and sophomore Jennifer
Gera.
There are about 35 learners
and 25 tutors, permitting a lot of
one-on-one contact.
Although the program has ac

tively recruited learners by con
tacting food service managers, or
ganizers say they found that most
workers approach the aid volun
tarily.
One tutor, junior Greg Fran
cis, said, "Teaching literacy to
adults is a challenge, but it is also
rewarding, because it has a vari
ety of practical purposes, such as
working on citizenship tests or
even signing checks."
