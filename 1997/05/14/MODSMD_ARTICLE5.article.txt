## Clarification of residence staff role, drug education emphasized 
### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Expanded drug and alcohol edu
cation, a definition of the role of res
idence staff and an increased focus
on prevention and treatment of
drug mid alcohol dependency were
among the recommendations in
cluded in the 30-page preliminary
report of the Alcohol Policy Task
Force.
The report, which took a year to
complete and was released yester
day, neither deviates from the re
quirements of the already existing
alcohol policy nor proposes new dis
ciplinary procedures for punishing
alcohol or drug use.
"The disciplinary process is
there," said Asst. Psychiatry Prof.
Robert Matano, a member of the

task force. The
report's recom
mendations "en
liana? the culture
of safety and re
sponsibility."
The report ad
dresses the role of
residence staff in
advising students
on the alcohol

policy and providing support for
students with drug or alcohol prob
lems. Contrary to previous worries,
the task force did not recommend
that resident assistants become
stricter law enforcers.
According to the report, "While
residence staff should themselves
obey all applicable laws and policies


Edmonds
concerning alcohol... it is not their
responsibility to enforce those laws.
It is crucial that students trust their
residence staff and feel comfortable
confiding in them."
"I personally think that the role
of the residence staff is to make
early assessment and provide moti
vation for referral and follow-up.
Residential staff should coach peo
ple to a safe harbor," Matano said.
The report emphasizes that the
use of dorm funds to buy alcohol in
all-freshman dormitories Ls prohib
ited and proposes using secret bal
lots in dorm elections that decide
whether or not to use funds for alco
hol.
"I hope the University increases
support of training for residence
staff on drug and alcohol issues,"
added Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas, chair of the task force.
The report proposes additions to
the text of the alcohol policy to ad
dress substance abuse. These addi
tions include the statements, "The
University recognizes that alcohol
and other drug dependency are
treatable illnesses, which may have
behavioral consequences," and
"Stanford is committed to an orga
nizational approach that reasonably
accommodates the treatment of
such illnesses while not creating
undue hardship on the University."
"Clearly, the old policy needed re
vision to allow for students to seek
treatment. The [preliminary! docu
ment supports treatment of drug
and alcohol problems," Matano said.

The report also recommends the
creation of an oversight committee
for prevention programs, the possi
ble establishment of a substance
free dormitory and increased oppor
tunities to learn about drug and al
cohol problems during Orientation.
According to Thomas, the pro
posed oversight committee will cre
ate "more coordination between
various units" of groups dealing
with alcohol and drug use on cam
pus.
"I do not see [the committee! as
another layer of discipline," he
added.
Thomas said although the report
does not call for a stricter alcohol
policy, it hopefully will encourage
adherence to the policy's rules by
clarifying them.
"I certainly hope the conse
quence of the report and subse
quent discussion is that there is in
creased adherence to the alcohol
policy," he said.
According to Mary Edmonds,
vice provost for student affairs, the
guidelines are currently being re
vised and clarified by the Office of
Student Activities.
Edmonds said the report ad
dresses the need for clarity around
the alcohol policy.
"Everyone was interpreting
things differently," Edmonds said.
"I applaud the efforts of the task
force to complete a very sensitive
document. They made a big com
mitment here."
Edmonds stressed that the re
port represents a draft rather than a
final decision. Before the final docu
ment is completed, Edmonds said
she hopes to solicit student opinion
on the report's recommendations.
