Zaire talks break down
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Planned
peace talks to avert a bloody battle for
Zaire's capital broke down yesterday, and
Kinshasa's millions retreated to their
homes to await the threatened advance of
rebel forces.
Residents still hoped President Mobutu
Sese Seko — stood up by Laurent Kabila
yesterday for talks on a ship off Point
Noire, Congo — would give up his losing
war without attempting a last stand
against Kabila.
Kabila said he objected to the site of the
meeting, but his snub raised doubts of
whether he was willing to stop fighting
just as the capital — the prize of his nine
month rebellion — was within reach.
A Western diplomat and Zairian mili
tary officials, all speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Kabila's rebels had
reached the Black River, about 60 miles
outside Kinshasa and the last major defen
sive position before the capital.
State-run radio, seeking to allay suspi
cions in the capital (hat the government
was preparing for attack, declared that
rebels were much farther away — on the
far side of the Kwanga River, 120 miles
east of Kinshasa.
Anti-fat drug nears market
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) - The first
anti-obesity drug that does more than
merely suppress appetite moved a step
closer to the market yesterday, (lovern
ment advisers recommended approval of a
pill that blocks the absorption of almost a
third of the fat people eat.
But scientists cautioned that Xenical, a

prescription drug, comes with embarrass
ing side effects that worsen with the more
fat that dieters eat.
And taking the pill doesn't mean people
can frequent McDonald's and still lose
weight, manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche
and outside scientists agreed.
Xenical may work by causing "a kind of
intestinal aversion," said Dr. Jules Hirsch
of" Rockefeller University, before joining
scientific advisers to the Foot! and Drug
Administration in recommending
approval of the drug. "Patients learn there
are consequences to eating more."
Among side effects, Xenical can cause
soft stools and oily leakages as the pill
sends undigested fat out of the body so ii
doesn't, wind up instead on dieters' thighs.
Car parts caused plane crash
TULSA, Okla. CAP) — An unknown
mechanic's decision to repair a plane's
engine with spare car parts led to a crash
that killed four people, investigators said.
The four, including two flight students,
were killed when the single-engine 1975
Cherokee Piper slammed into a field near
Vera on April 27, 1996.
The final report by the National Trans
portation Safety Board, released this week,
concluded that automotive clamps rather
than clamps made for use in plane engines
were installed on the exhaust system,
causing the plane to catch fire while air
borne. The mechanic or mechanics were
not identified.
Some victims' relatives are considering
legal act ion against Kaimana Aviation, the
Ponca City flight school that operated the
plane, said Laura Shook, whose father was
killed in the crash.
