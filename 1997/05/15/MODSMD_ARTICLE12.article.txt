# NATO, Russia agree on pact

MOSCOW (AP) - NATO and Russia
entered a new era of guarded cooperation
yesterday, agreeing on a landmark
accord outlining post-Cold War security
and designed to assuage Moscow's anger
over the alliance's expansion.
The former foes praised the agree
ment, which requires final approval by
NATO's member governments, as a big
stride toward ensuring a peaceful
Europe. President Clinton said it would
give Russia "a voice in, but not a veto
over, NATO's business."
Within hours, however, top officials
on both sides were giving conflicting
interpretations of what assurances
NATO offered about limiting military
operations on its new members' territo
ries. President Boris Yeltsin called them

guarantees, while NATO officials said
they were nothing of the kind.
Most important, for now, could bo the
mere fact of a breakthrough that allows
Russia to formally accept the bitter real
ity of the alliance's expansion into East
ern Europe — practically on its borders.
Because of the agreement, Yeltsin
said in a televised interview, "we will
accept the situation much more calmly
than before. If we were anxious before
this document, . . . after it is signet! our
anxieties will go away,"
NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana of Spain and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov announced
the agreement after a negotiating round
that lasted much of the night and cli
maxed months of tough talks. The final

breakthrough came after Solano spoke
with Yeltsin by telephone.
NATO, moving to strengthen Euro
pean security in the wake of the Cold
War, plans to announce its first round
o( expansion at a »July summit in
Madrid. Three of Moscow's former War
saw Pact allies tabbed as the likely new
members: Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
Russia, heavily dependent on loans
from the West and in no shape to match
NATO's multibillion-dollar move, had
virtually no chance of blocking the
expansion. But it has been pushing for
months for a security agreement, seek
ing limits on the expansion from NATO
officials anxious to avoid further inflam
ing Russian nationalists.
