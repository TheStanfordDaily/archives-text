# Boalt law minority admissions drop
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AIM — The num
ber of blacks admitted to the University
of California's Boalt Hall law school tum
bled 81 percent in the first year without
affirmative action, and Hispanic admis
sions fell 50 percent.
Law school Dean Herma Hill Kay
called the plunging totals "precisely what
we feared would result from the elimina
tion of affirmative action."
Foes of racial preferences saw the fig
ures released yesterday in a different
light.
"These numbers really show the hor
rendous magnitude of the preferences
that we've been giving in the UC sys
tem," said Jennifer Nelson of the Ameri
can Civil Rights Institute, founded by
IJC Regent Ward Connerly. Connerly

wrote the new UC policy eliminating
race and gender as factors in admissions.
The Board of Regents, the governing
body for ( lie UC system's nine campuses
and 167,000 students, adopted the policy
in 1995, and it took effect first with grad
uate students entering in the fall of
1997. Undergraduates will be admitted
under the new, race-neutral policies next
year.
Other major UC graduate schools
have yet to release their admissions fig
ures.
The Boalt dean said that instead of
race, the law school took into account
any obstacles applicants had to overcome
or any disadvantages they faced. The law
school has about 940 students.
Boalt had announced earlier that

minorities made up 13(5 percent of this
year's applicants vs. 39 percent the pre
vious year.
In all, 14 black students were admit
ted for fall 191)7 at Hoalt. That compared
with 75 students last year. The number
ofHispanics admitted decreased from 78
to 39.
Meanwhile, the number of Asian
Americans, who were not granted prefer
ences under the old system, increased
about 1H percent, from 126 to 149. The
number of white students admitted rose
from to 538, up about 15 percent.
Those numbers are for admissions
only. About, 270 students are expected to
actually enroll, and the numbers for
minorities could change depending on
who accepts.
