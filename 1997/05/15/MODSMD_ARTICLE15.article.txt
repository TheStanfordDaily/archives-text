ASSU Senate neglected
its responsibility when
passing endowment bill

Last week, the assu
Senate once again demon
strated how not to go about
passing a serious piece of legisla
tion.
The senate is a body in which
routine appointments are often
cause for hours of debate. Yet at last
Tuesday's meeting, in a rush to
move onto the much-anticipated
and sure-to-be-lengthy debate on
election certification, the senate in
one fell swoop and after roughly 20
minutes of discussion passed a mea
sure that creates a multi-million
dollar endowment for the ASSU.
The measure also, to a large degree,
lops off the business projects — now
known as Stanford Student Enter
prises — from the operations of the
ASSU's representative arms.
The change seems to be a good
one. The endowment will return
enough money annually to fund the
ASSU's political branches — that is,
it will pay the president and vice
president's salaries and give them
and the senate money with which to
operate. That income will also cover
the costs of the ASSU's service pro
jects like the Nominations Commis
sion. Further, the greater indepen
dence of SSE should allow those
businesses to operate in a more
business-like manner.
Still, the manner in which the
ASSU Senate approved the change
is inexcusable. The bill creating the
endowment and the quasi-indepen
dent SSE represents a tremendous
shift for the ASSU. It is worth
remembering the full name of the
ASSU — the organization is an
association of all Stanford's stu
dents. By moving its business oper
ations out of the purview of the sen
ate, the students — the members of
that association — are losing their
authority over business activities

being conducted in their name.
The text of the bill was first dis
tributed to senators in the early
morning hours on the day it was
considered — and even then only
via e-mail and absent any specific
dollar figures. The full text was
available at that evening's meeting,
the same meeting at which the pro
posal received only 20 minutes'
debate before passage.
It's interesting to note the care
with which the senate likes to
examine other major changes. For
example, when it was asked to
approve the new judicial charter in
April, the senate created a special
committee that carefully reviewed
the proposed charter, even though
senators served on the Committee
of 15 that drafted it. Yet a bill that
overhauls the ASSU's financial
operations received no such scruti
ny — nothing even close.
Instead, ASSU Financial Man
ager John Hall, architect of the
new plan and the author of the sen
ate's legislation, kept a tight leash
on the details of his new plan until
the meeting at which it was consid
ered. Robert's Rules of Order,
under which the ASSU Senate
operates, specify that certain types
of bills must be presented for previ
ous notice at the meeting prior to
the one at which the measure will
be formally considered.
Hall chose to give previous notice
not by producing the text of his bill
but rather by submitting a three
paragraph letter and putting the
onus on individual senators to dis
cuss details with him. Nowhere
does that letter mention the incor
poration and greater independence
that the actual bill granted to SSE.
That the senators unquestion
ingly went along with the recom
mendation does not say it's a bad
measure. It simply says that the
senate had an obligation to give
more careful consideration to a bill
that gave away a chunk of its
authority. Hopefully, as the senate
elect learns about its new job, its
members will not see this action as
an example of how to legislate.
