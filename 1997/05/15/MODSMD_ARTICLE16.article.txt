University has yet to act responsibly in Pfefferbaum case

ON JAN. 28, The Santa Clara Supe
rior Court ruled that Stanford had
wrongfully dismissed Adolf Pfeffer
baum from his tenured academic position
and directed the administration to rein
state him forthwith with all rights. Today
more than three months later, Stanford
has failed to fully obey the court order.
This inaction has serious ramifications,
which affect the Stanford community and
devastate PfefTerbaum's reputation with
in the greater scientific community.
Until his dismissal, PfefTerbaum, a pro
fessor in the Department of Psychiatry
and Behavioral Science, was the principal
investigator and director of the Mental
Health Clinical Kesearch Center, which
received more than $1 million of annual
funding from the National Institute of
Mental Health. Over the past decade

under PfefTerbaum's leadership, the cen
ter flourished as a research and teaching
center, which focused on the study of
brain mechanisms of schizophrenia. The
center's work product includes hundreds
of journal articles, book chapters and pre
sentations. Grants from many faculty
members were dependent upon center
resources, including the intellectual con
tributions of Pfefferbaum. Numerous
postdoctoral fellows trained with him, and
psychiatry residents touted the center as
the highlight of their VA rotation.
While the administration disregards
the court order, Pfefferbaum powerlessly
watches his intellectual product — the
center he developed — be absconded
under departmental auspices by a Uni
versity-appointed surrogate with a track
record in neither imaging nor schizophre

nia. He watches the work of his collabora
tors and students compromised by the
dissipation of the center's infrastructure,
and he watches the departure of his high
ly trained staff because of lost hope in the
University's ability to act fairly and expe
ditiously, even at the behest of a court
order. The unconscionable delay of full
reinstatement is unwarranted and puni
tive to Pfefferbaum and is particularly
egregious because his dismissal was
unlawful in the first place.
With every passing day, the damages
to this once world-class center and Pfef
ferbaum's scientific reputation become
more irreversible. While the administra
tion can claim that a grant, like the one
from the center, is given to the Universi
ty and not to the individual applicant,
that position discounts the intangible and

precious intellectual and motivational
processes required to create grant appli
cations or any other intellectual work —
the invention and product of the scholar,
the foundation of the university and a
principal object of tenure protection. To
ignore the genesis of such a product is to
commit the ultimate offense to academic
scholarship and freedom.
As a role model to its students, the
Stanford administration is teaching a
deplorable lesson: It can act irresponsibly
with impunity, scorn correction and use
its unchecked power to abuse and harass
the individual. Accordingly, the present
administration is living up to the stan
dards set by the previous one.
