# Recent advertisement in appropriately makes fun of Asians as nerds
## 
### 
I am writing to express my outrage at
an advertisement for "Nerd-fest '97," an
event co-sponsored bv Saturn of Sunnyvale
and Impact Marketing, a student group.
The flier, titled "The Typical
N.E.R.D.," shows a cartoon figure with
stereotvpicallv Asian features, including
slanted, narrow eyes. The flier goes on to
make fun of the "nerd" with his pocket
protector and taped up glasses.
Clearly, the advertisement is playing
off the stereotype of Asian Americans as
nerds." It was posted all around campus,
including on a billboard in White Plaza.
I am appalled that Saturn and Impact
Marketing find this sort of racist imagery
acceptable, and I am disgusted that they
would try to capitalize on racial stereo
types in order to promote their product.
