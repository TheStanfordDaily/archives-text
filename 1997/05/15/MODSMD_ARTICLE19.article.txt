## Learning to appreciate art 
### 
"The fact is that the fine arts aren't sup
ported as much at Stanford as they are at
other schools, particularly those in the
Ivy League."
— Junior Chris Kawaja, in a
May 5 letter to The Daily
POP QUIZ, HOT shot: Name three
plays that were performed in the
past quarter at Stanford. How
about three concerts? Maybe just one
dance performance, other than Spring
Migration. If The Daily or Intermission is
your key to such information, than odds
are, you failed this quiz.
The mass media on this campus, practi
cally monopolized by The Daily and its off
shoots, seem to have made a decision to
ignore our artistic community. While there
is much to be seen and heard in the Bay
Area and beyond, we mustn't lose sight of
the importance of performances and artis
tic efforts at Stanford, which shape our
immediate community and culture. Surely
there is more to be found than the random
fraternity party or political rally.
Intermission may review every Ram's
Head production, but there is more to
Stanford theater than snazzy musicals,
amateur one-acts and a three-hour,
sketch-comedy, musical prologue to a foot
ball game. I mean no condescension to
these shows, for they, too, are important
and valued venues of expression, but there
is so much more to be gleaned from Stan
ford's theatrical community.

Yes, it is true that Intermission covers
the music scene at Stanford, but there is
more to music than college bands, pseu
do-beatnik performers and the rare con
cert a la Beck.
I concede that dance has a home in The
Daily, but I have a feeling there is more to
the Dance Department — and student
dance as a whole — than Spring Migration.
The truth is that the fine arts aren't
supported as much at Stanford as they
should be. The Daily is not alone in this
lack of support, but it is an entity with the
capability to link Stanfordites to the Stan
ford arts, and it has chosen to deny us this
link. Perhaps articles about ACT or the San
Francisco Film Festival are interesting to
the few of us who have time to leave the
Stanford campus, but I'm willing to wager
that such people are a small minority.
Last week, the Drama Department's
production of "Richard III" opened. I
wonder if anyone other than friends of
the cast knew anything about it. Such
blatant disregard for Stanford's artistic
efforts is not new. In November, the
same ignorance occurred with the pro
duction of "The Inspector General" — a
show which turned away more than 100
people by the end of its run and which
was later hailed by the artistic director of
Theatreworks as an emblem of what Bay
Area theater should be.
Two weeks ago, Talisman won nation
al recognition as a first-placed a cappella
group. The Daily gave them an article on

the back page. And this a student-run
organization, not some department
backed semi-professional production. If
Chris Kawaja had not written a letter in
response, I would never have known that
Talisman won anj'thing.
The appropriate place for coverage
would be Intermission, which is supposed
to be focused on Stanford culture. I quote
from an unpublished letter I wrote to The
Daily in November: "For some reason,
the people who put together Intermission
each week feel they can provide us with
information and reviews of nationally
[and regionally] received entertainment
that we could easily find in more profes
sional publications rather than focus
more on the Stanford arts community
and write about events specific to the
Stanford campus — events that we could
never read about in other publications.
"I just hope that future publications of
Intermission will take heed of its reader
ship and the Stanford community and
write more about Stanford life. Leave the
national media to the national media."
Apparently, not much has changed
since November.

munication and drama, will be murdered
at 8 p.m. in the Little Theatre for the next
three nights.
