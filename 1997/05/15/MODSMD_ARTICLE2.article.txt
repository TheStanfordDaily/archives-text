# Director searches reaching final stages
## Disability center, Indian program could both have heads by summer 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford community
will be able to meet the final candidates for
the director positions of the American Indi
an Program Office and the Disability Re
source Center by the end of May, Dean of
Students Marc Wais said.
The search for an assistant dean of stu
dents and director of the program has gen
erated five finalists. The one for a new head
of the disability center has produced four.
Wais hopes to make final decisions in
time for the new directors to be in place
during the summer.
Finalists will participate in open com
munity forums later this month, where
members of the Stanford community can
ask questions and provide feedback for the
selection process.
"I strongly encourage all members of
the campus community to come (to the fo
rums] and meet these candidates," Wais
said.
Recommendations will be made by the
search committees on whom should be se
lected. Wais, however, among other high
ranking administrators, has the final deci
sion.
Wais said he was highly impressed by
the strength of the applicant pool for both
positions.
"Both have generally strong applicant
pools in number and in quality," he said.
"These searches were national in scope . . .
in an attempt to cast a wide a net as possi
ble to get the best people."
The search committees sought individu
als with at least bachelor's degrees, consid
erable prior experience and good manager
ial and leadership skills.

According to Assoc.
Dean of Medical Student
and Graduate Student Af
fairs Patricia Cross, chair
of the Disability Resource
Center search committee,
there were 90 applicants
for the position.
"We're looking for
someone who possesses
sensitivity and leader-

ship," Cross said. "This is a developing pro
gram, and it needs someone who could re
ally stabilize it and help it grow."
Cross added that she hopes the new di
rector will have previous experience in re
lated fields and he able to work under a de
centralized system; the center's director is
given a lot of independence in making deci
sions.
According to Wais, there were 72 appli
cants for the position in the American Indi
an and Alaska Native Program.
Asst. English Prof. Robert Warrior,
chair of this search committee, said being
director is a complex and important job in
volving many different facets.
"Stanford's program is a national leader
and, as such, it needs to have someone with
the leadership both on and off campus that
people have come to respect," Warrior said.
He also highlighted the importance of
the advising aspects of the position, such as
academic and peer counseling.
"We're looking for someone who can
identify and work with counseling func
tions," Warrior said. "Too many Native
Americans fall through the cracks.
"Our main focus is the academic needs
of Native Americana," he added.
Hillel is also searching for a new director
and hopes to make an announcement soon.
