## Baseball seeks Pacific 10 title against Washington 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Last weekend, the Cardinal fought in
the biggest series of its season and emerged
with a Pacific 10 Southern Division cham
pionship. Doesn't the team deserve some
time to relax?
Baseball doesn't work that way.
For Stanford, another series means
another goal to meet. This time, the No. 5
Cardinal (38-16, 21-9 Six-Pac) will face a
driven No. 23 Washington Huskies (41-
17, 20-4 Pac-10 North) team in the Pac
-10 Championship Series — three games
that could dictate the rest of the Cardi
nal's path through the playoffs.
The best-of-three series starts tonight
at Sunken Diamond at 7, continues at 7
p.m. tomorrow and concludes at 1 p.m.
Saturday if a third game is necessary.
Because Stanford was chosen as the
host site for the NCAA West Regional, the
Cardinal is automatically reserved a berth
in next week's tournament.
But as sophomore center fielder Jody
Gerut points out, that doesn't mean these

ries this weekend with the Huskies is just
filler.
"We have a lot at stake in this series,"
Gerut said. "We may have a berth at the re
gionals guaranteed, but we're playing for
the No. 1 seed in that tournament."
Winning this weekend and getting the
No. 1 place in next weekend's playoffs
would give the Cardinal a tremendous ad
vantage.
"The No. 1 seed has a much easier
route through the playoffs," Gerut said.
"If you're the No. 1 seed, you play the No.
6 seed first, then the loser of the No. [3|
versus No. [4| matchup. We have to un
derstand that there's a huge difference
between the No. 1 and the No. 2 seeds."
The Huskies, on the other hand, are
fighting for their very life. With a win
against the Cardinal in the Pac-10 Cham
pionship Series, they would earn a guaran
teed berth in a regional. With a loss, their
season likely ends.
