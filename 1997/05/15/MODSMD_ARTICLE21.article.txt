## Baseball seeks Pacific 10 title against Washington 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Last weekend, the Cardinal fought in
the biggest series of its season and emerged
with a Pacific 10 Southern Division cham
pionship. Doesn't the team deserve some
time to relax?
Baseball doesn't work that way.
For Stanford, another series means
another goal to meet. This time, the No. 5
Cardinal (38-16, 21-9 Six-Pac) will face a
driven No. 23 Washington Huskies (41-
17, 20-4 Pac-10 North) team in the Pac
-10 Championship Series — three games
that could dictate the rest of the Cardi
nal's path through the playoffs.
The best-of-three series starts tonight
at Sunken Diamond at 7, continues at 7
p.m. tomorrow and concludes at 1 p.m.
Saturday if a third game is necessary.
Because Stanford was chosen as the
host site for the NCAA West Regional, the
Cardinal is automatically reserved a berth
in next week's tournament.
But as sophomore center fielder Jody
Gerut points out, that doesn't mean these

ries this weekend with the Huskies is just
filler.
"We have a lot at stake in this series,"
Gerut said. "We may have a berth at the re
gionals guaranteed, but we're playing for
the No. 1 seed in that tournament."
Winning this weekend and getting the
No. 1 place in next weekend's playoffs
would give the Cardinal a tremendous ad
vantage.
"The No. 1 seed has a much easier
route through the playoffs," Gerut said.
"If you're the No. 1 seed, you play the No.
6 seed first, then the loser of the No. [3|
versus No. [4| matchup. We have to un
derstand that there's a huge difference
between the No. 1 and the No. 2 seeds."
The Huskies, on the other hand, are
fighting for their very life. With a win
against the Cardinal in the Pac-10 Cham
pionship Series, they would earn a guaran
teed berth in a regional. With a loss, their
season likely ends.

pressed by Washingon's team.
"Their offensive numbers are
unbelievable," he said. "Last
year, in the Pac-10 Champi
onships, they took one of three
from a great USC team. And

they're even better this year."
Washington is batting .345 as a
team and has five players with 40
or more RBIs. The Huskies can
claim speed as an asset as well, as
four of their players have at least
10 stolen bases.
The Husky that Stanford pitch
ers will have to look out for is
shortstop Kevin Miller. His .402
batting average, 12 home runs and

69 RBI helped him garner Pac-10
North player of the year honors
and spark his team to an 11-game
winning streak to end the regular
season. His 69 RBIs and 88 hits
are both school records.
But the hottest Washington
player is outfielder Chris Ma
gruder. He batted .500 (12-for
-24) last week, as the Huskies won
all six of their games. In five of

the six games, the speedy leadoff
hitter started off the game by
getting on base, and he scored
every time.
For Magruder, Miller and the
rest of the Huskies, a whole season
rests on this series.
"This series is big for them,"
Gerut said. "They're going to
come at us with everything
they've got."
