# Crew's senior members steal show
## 
### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
For seniors to enjoy a sunrise
during their years at Stanford is
a rare and special treat — except
if you are one of the 12 members
of the Class of '97 who marveled
at newly formed streaks of red
dish-orange sunlight reflecting
off the waters of the Bay every
morning for four years with
Stanford crew.
"It's like watching God paint
pictures, and you can't beat that
kind of art," said senior Erin
Sweeney.
Presented to them during ini
tiation their freshmen year, the
only bearers of the 1994

"ScrewU" T-shirts left on the
team are seniors Anne Dubinski,
Jen Brown ; Janet Bucher, Jon
Garfinkel, Bess Kennedy, Maria
Klemperer-Johnson, Tor Lund
gren, Matt Miller, Andra Pli
gavko, lan Rhodes, Mark
Thomas and Sweeney.
From bad and funky haircuts
given by their big brothers fresh
man year to rowing naked during
Class Day earlier this spring,
these seniors may be the most
tight-knit group of athletes in
any varsity sport at Stanford.
"They are very tight, cohesive.
The bond is strong in this
group," said men's head coach
Wieslaw Kujda.
Without any athletic scholar

ships, these varsity athletes par
took in a sport where there are no
ulterior reasons other than win
ning races and treasuring the
friendships within the team.
"The people," said Garfinkel
and all his teammates when
asked what they will miss most
after graduation. "The only
thing which can get you out of
bed at 5:30 in the morning is
knowing that eight of your fa
vorite people in the whole world
are getting up with you with the
same goal — making fast boats."
Even though crew may seem
hazardous to one's social life, this
special breed of athletes knows
how to have a good time in their
own way.

After their 1994 victory
against the rival Bears in the Pa
cific 10 Conference Champi
onships, women's varsity co-cap
tain Kennedy and her teammates
drove back to campus from
Sacramento in her mother's con
vertible. "We kept the top down
all the way home and blasted the
theme song from 'Rocky' as we
drove back on to campus,"
Kennedy said.
Kujda also agrees that mem
bers of this class knew how to
enjoy themselves while training
hard.
"As each class leaves its
unique mark, I will remember
these seniors as happy guys —
very happy guys," Kujda said.
"What amazes me is that they are
capable to work hard, row fast
and have a lot of fun with it."
Kujda also recalls an incident
of varsity co-captain Miller row
ing a pair, which produced many
laughs from his teammates after
a hard practice.
Miller "hit the oar against the
buoy marker and got ejected
from his foot-stretchers, making
a somersault inside the boat,"
Kujda said. "I captured every
thing on video and saw some
white socks flying over [Mattl
Joliey's head."
Like Kujda said, these ath
letes had more than a good time
— they have made their mark on
the rowing community.
The varsity women rowed
through California twice in the
Big Row and finished last year's
dual-season racing with a record
of 8-0, closing the season with
third place at Pac-lOs and barely
missing nationals.
"They are the fastest," said
women's head coach Aimee
Baker. "If we can have a group
like this or even close to this
graduating every year, there
would be no questions that w<;
will win championships. They
placed Stanford women's crew
on the map."
Although not as successful as
their female counterparts, the
men's varsity squad had many
close races against a nationally
ranked California squad.
"They had solid perfor
mances, but their biggest contri

bution to this team is the leader
ship and guidance for the younger
guys on the team to go fast,"
Kujda said. "And now, [the novice
men) are really fast."
As the season comes to an end,
the senior men will row for one
last time as Cardinal oarsmen in
the Henley regatta in England
during the summer, and the
women have a good chance to
close off their season at nationals.
Taking the position of a high
school teacher in Western civiliza
tion and English after gradua
tion, Thomas will miss the many
hours of physical workouts in
cluding hard erg pieces, weights
and water practices.
"It will be hard for me to keep
in this physical shape without
crew," Thomas said.
And many will miss the feeling
of having nine athletes trans
formed into one, which is unique
only to crew races.
"I will miss the competition,"
Miller said. "I love to race."

Despite missing many of their
senior events this year including
their class formal tomorrow
night, having no spring break due
to spring training, suffering from

sleep deprivation, missing many
parties with their friends, having
less time to study and having a
rough time maintaining a rela
tionship due to their commitment
to crew, these seniors reflect back
at their four years at Stanford and
they all concluded that it was all
worth it.
As these soon-to-be graduates
go their separate ways, one thing
these athletes will never forget
from their Stanford experience —
their best friends in crew.
