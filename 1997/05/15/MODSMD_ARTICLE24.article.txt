# Men's golf heads to West Regional
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Finishing fourth in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference tournament
last week earned the Stanford
men's golf team a spot in the
NCAA West Regional and a
chance to compete at nationals
in two weeks.
Having accomplished their
season goal of playing in the re
gional tournament and finishing
the season much stronger than
anyone expected, the golfers now
have their sights set on the
NCAA tournament.
Unlike the Pac-lOs, the re
gional tournament will consist of
three rounds of a five score

count-four format which will be
played today, tomorrow and Sat
urday. Eighteen teams from Dis
tricts 7 and 8 will compete at
Carlton Oaks Country Club in
San Diego, with the top nine fin
ishers continuing on to NCAAs.
Teeing off for the Card will be
sophomore Joel Kribel, senior
Conrad Ray, freshman Dusty
Brett, senior Pete Ligotti and
freshman Michael Weimer, as
determined by the top five fin
ishers of the six golfers who com
peted at Pac-lOs.
Known for its long, narrow
fairways and due to the fact that

played the course before, Carlton
Oaks will present a major chal
lenge for the golfers.
"Our driving and our short
game will be two of the most im
portant parts of our game," Brett
said. "If we're not in the fairway
every time, it's going to be tough
to make that up. On the other
hand, we'll have to use our short
game to finish every single hole."
Of course, at this level the
team cannot afford much margin
for error.
"At this stage we can't do any

thing to shoot ourselves out of
it," said Ray. "We've got to stay
away from the high numbers,
and the straighter we can hit the
ball, the better we're going to
do."
While Stanford's short game
has traditionally been one of its
greatest assets, the golfers
worked especially hard in the last
week on their driving.
"I think we've got some good
driving practice under our belts
now," Ray said. "We've been
working hard, and hopefully
everything will come to fruition
this week."
Although driving will be im
portant, Kribel was quick to re
mind that distance alone will not

win the tournament. "Accuracy
is the most important thing, al
ways," he said.
Because nine of the Pac-10
teams will be in attendance, the
Cardinal will face many of the
same teams as last week. "We
can't expect to beat teams like
ASU," Ray said. "Oregon, Ore
gon State, San Jose State and
BYU are a few competitors who
come to mind. Ultimately, we
have to play the golf course more
than any one team. If we don't let
the golf course beat us, we'll be
fine."
Brett also discussed the capri
ciousness of the regional out
come. "There will definitely be
less room for error here â€” we

have to play well every single
day, can't have more than one
high score per round and defi
nitely can't have any rounds like
the third round at Pac-lOs.
There's a lot of good teams here,
and our finish will depend not
only on how we play but which
one of those teams has a good
round and when."
Overall, the team is approach
ing the tournament in high spir
its.
"If we have a similar week as
last week, we should be" going
to NCAAs, Ray said. "People un
derestimate what we have. As
long as we're consistent, it won't
take a miraculous finish to get
there."
