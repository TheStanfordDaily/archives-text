# NCAA Women's Tennis Championship Preview
## Tournament should provide few surprises 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
While the Cardinal begins what it
hopes is a journey to the national
title, the rest of the NCAA field has
similar hopes of their own.
The primary opposition that
jumps out at the Cardinal is top
ranked and top-seeded Florida. The
Gators have not lost a match in the
last two seasons. They are undefeat
ed this year and did not lose a match
throughout last year's champi
onship season.
"Hey, they are 59-0," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan. "To
me, they are the defending champs,
and they are the national champs
until someone beats them. 59-0?
That's impressive. I feel good about
our chances against them, but they
are certainly tough."
The Cardinal and the Gators have
met three times in the last two
years, each of them ending inauspi
ciously for Stanford. Last season,
the Cardinal lost to Florida twice by

a 5-2 margin, once at the National
Team Indoors and again in the finals
of the NCAA Championships.
After another disappointing 4-3
loss to the Gators in the finals of this
season's National Team Indoors,
there certainly is a strong rivalry
brewing.
"I think it has brewed," Brennan
said. "We have been going at it, year
in and year out for the last six or
seven years."
The next installment of the rival
ry would have to be in the finals, as
the two top seeds are in opposite
halves of the bracket.
The Gators (28-0) are led by ju
nior Dawn Buth in both doubles
and singles. Buth, who played at
the No. 2 spot last season, is ranked
sixth in the nation in singles as
Florida's top player. In doubles,
Buth teams up with sophomore
Stephanie Nikitas at the No. 1 dou
bles spot, and the defending NCAA
champions sit atop the national
rankings in doubles.
Three other Gator singles players

are ranked in the top 21, including
freshman Amanda Basica, who is
No. 15.
Behind the second-seeded Cardi
nal, Duke, UCLA and Georgia round
out the top five. The third-seeded
Blue Devils finished the season with
a No. 3 national ranking. Behind the
top-10 duo of freshman Karin Miller
and sophomore Vanessa Webb,
Duke compiled a 22-3 record.
"I would put Duke up there with
us and Florida," Brennan said.
"Duke is a very good team, but the
fact that we might see them is good
for us. It's good to play tough match
es like that."
One of those losses came at the
hand of the Cardinal, however, in
the semifinals of the National Team
Indoors. Stanford bulldozed the
Blue Devils for a 5-1 victory, hut
both teams were missing their No. 1
players, Duke's Webb and Stan
ford's freshman Lilia Osterloh.
"Their team is considerably dif
ferent than they were at. the time, as
is ours," Brennan said. "She and

Lilia are now going to be there."
Duke and Stanford could meet
again in the semifinals.
The Cardinal i.; extremely famil
iar with the fourth-seeded team, I he
Bruins. UCI.A finished the season at
18-5 and placed second in the Pacific
10 Conference behind Stanford The
Bruins, who have four freshmen in
their singles lineup, were no match
for the Cardinal in dual-match play
this season, losing 6-3 and 8-1.
Stanford will most likely not get
another look at the Bruins, as UCLA
is in Florida's bracket.
"We beat them twice, and beating
a team a third time is always tough,"
Brennan said. "Certainly, in a situa
tion like that, the pressure is on us
So I'm glad we might not see them;
sometimes it's good to >;et those I'ac
10 teams out of the way."
The No. f> (ieorgia Bulldogs are in
the Cardinal's half, and Stanford is
looking at a head-on collision with
the Bulldogs in the second round
Georgia (18-4) faces No. 11) William
& Mary (19-8) today.
