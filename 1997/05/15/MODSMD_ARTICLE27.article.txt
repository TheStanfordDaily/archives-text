## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis begins its stretch run for a ninth
NCAA title today with a 3 p.m. first
round match with the No. 21 Wiscon
sin Badgers at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal (26-1, 10-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) re
ceived the second seed in the 16-teain
bracket, behind only No. 1 Florida, the
defending national champion. The
Cardinal cannot possibly meet the
Gators until the finals.
The Badgers (22-7, 9-3 Big 10 Con
ference) qualified for the tournament
field by winning the Midwest Regional
last weekend in Notre Dame, Ind. The
regional championship clinched a sec
ond straight berth in the NCAA Cham
pionship for Wisconsin, who won an
opening-round match last year against
Wake Forest.
With three straight wins in there

gional tournament, the Badgers have
now won 11 of their bust 13 contests
and 16 of their last 19 matches.
"They are the best first-round op
ponent we have ever had," Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "They are
a solid team. They beat some quality
teams this year, and this is going to be
a good starting match for us. They are
not going to be a blowout match for
us."
Four of Wisconsin's seven losses
came in the first 10 dual matches of the
season.
Two of Wisconsin's biggest wins of
the season happened at just the right
time. Prior to last weekend's two wins
against No. 19 Notre Dame and No. 16
South Carolina, the Badgers did not
boast a win over a top-20 team since
beating No. 13 Tennessee in mid-Feb
ruary.
The Badger lineup is highlighted
by senior Melissa Zimpfer, the eighth
ranked singles player in the nation.
Zimpfer, Wisconsin's first-ever All-

American, has compiled a 35-5 record
at the No. I spot and is just the second
player in Wisconsin history to string
together back-to-back 30-win sea
sons.
"She comes out and bangs the ball,"
Brennan said "She is a good player, so
we art; going to have our hands full
with her."
Zimpfer will meet Stanford fresh
man I,ilia Osterloh this afternoon on
the No. 1 court. Ranked No. 13 in sin
gles, Osterloh has lost just one match
since being assigned the No. 1 singles
position in March.
Zimpfer made the Badger history
h(>oks in doubles as well. Sheand senior
Colleen Lucey teamed up for a school
best 31-10 season. Zimpfer and Lucey
will be challenged, however, by the
country's eighth-ranked sqn;i<l of Os
terloh and senior Katie Selllukebir.
Outside of Zimpfer and Lucey, the
Badgers struggle in doubles play, post
ingjust a 25-27 record at the No. 2 and
No. 3 spots.

Schlukebir, who maintains the No.
1 ranking in women's singles, will face
Tracy Zobrist at the No. .'1 .spot. Zobrist
is just 8-9 on the year at that posit ion
While the Badgers have heen play
ing matches all last week in an effort (<â€¢
qualify, t he (Cardinal received an auto
mat ie bid and has been pract icing since
mid-April.
"That is a push I think," Brennan
said. "They may be tired and heal up a
little bit, and they may be extremely
match-tough. The thing we do know is
that they are on a three-match winning
streak."
Despite ji 11 of the championship
hype surrounding the team this sea
son, Brennan isn't concerned that the
Cardinal will underestimate any of its
opponents.
"I think they know Wisconsin is
pretty good," Brennan said "So we'll
take them on Jind hopefully take on t lie
next team. They respect Duke a lot as
well. We are trying to not Ihink about
I No. 1| Florida'"
