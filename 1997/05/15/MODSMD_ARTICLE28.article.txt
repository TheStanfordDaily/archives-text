# Brennan reconfigures singles lineup
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Stanford women's tennis head coach
Frank Brennan made a major lineup move
late in the dual-match season by removing
junior Ail-American Ania Bleszynski from
the singles lineup.
Bleszynski, who had been playing in the
No. 5 singles spot, will be replaced at that
spot by junior Julie Scott. Playing in
Scott's No. 6 position will be freshman
Teryn Ashley.
Brennan cited poor play as the main
reason to removeg√üleszynsk i from singles.
"She is just having a bad year," Bren
nan said. "Her confidence is down, and
Teryn is just playing better."
Ranked 57th in the nation in singles,
Bleszynski has a 17-4 record in dual match
es this season but went 4-2 at the fifth spot.
Bleszynski will still play doubles, how
ever, teaming up with Scott to compete at
the No. 2 spot. Bleszynski and Scott are the
second-ranked doubles team in the nation.
Brennan also looked to Ashley's success
throughout the season as a factor in mak
ing the lineup change. Ashley is undefeat
ed in 20 matches this season.
"It's not like Ashley hasn't proven her
self," Brennan said "Her record speaks for

itself, and she made it to the individual fi
nals at the Ojai Invitational. So it's not like
we are taking someone who hasn't been in
there and saying, 'You are the one.' "
The freshman competed on a regular
basis at the No. 6 singles spot while fresh
man Lilia Osterloh remained out of the
lineup with a shoulder injury. When Oster
loh returned, Ashley became a doubles
only player for the Cardinal at the No. 3
spot with freshman Anne Kremer. Ashley,
ranked No. 55 in the nation in singles, is
the only player on the Cardinal roster with
out a dual-match loss.
The lineup change occurred after the
conclusion of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, in which Scott captured
her second consecutive singles title.
Bleszynski lost in the second round to Ari
zona's Vicky Maes in three sets. Maes,
then the third-ranked singles player in the
nation, lost to Scott in the finals.
In making the change, Brennan has
substituted a freshman for a junior with
extensive NCAA experience. Bleszynski
competed in the top singles spot for Stan
ford last season when the Cardinal lost in
the finals and at the No. 2 spot two seasons
ago as the Cardinal fell in the semifinals.
Bleszynski, who lost in the semifinals of
the NCAA singles tournament last year,

qualified as an All~American in singles and
doubles in her two seasons ut Stanford.
"It's just an unfortunate situation,"
Brennansaid. "I think the world of Ania. I
know what she can do, and I have seen her
do it. I know she will be back. You don't for
get how to play tennis at that level."
Despite her lack of experience, Brennan
was not concerned about Ashley's role in
Stanford's run for a ninth NCAA title.
"Teryn has been loose and playing well
Jill year," Brennan said. "She doesn't look
like she is afraid of anybody. She has had a
hellofayear, so I feel good about it. We are
very fortunate this year to have this kind of
manpower."
The Stanford lineup now features three
freshmen: Osterloh at No. 1, Kremer at No.
2 and Ashley at No. 6.
Brennan also was quick to point out
that the change should have no adverse af
fects on Bleszynski's doubles play.
"She is playing very well in doubles
right now," Brennan said. "She is handling
it very well, and I am extremely proud of
her. It is a very difficult situation, but she
is being very supportive of the team."
Currently the seventh alternate to the
singles bracket, it is unlikely that Bleszyn
ski will compete in the individual NCAA
singles tournament next week.
