### Marcella Bernhard Staff writer 
Twenty-five students were pre
sented with the James W. Lyons
Award for Service at a dinner cere
mony last night.
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the 7-year-old award is
"a way for the University to formal
ly recognize work beingdone hy stu
dents to benefit Stanford or the
local community."
Those who were honored with
the awards have a diverse list of ac
complishments, interests and com
mitments. They include creators of
academic tutoring programs, dance
groups and publications, student
government leaders and peer
health educators.
Cristale Brown, a senior major
ing in public policy, was honored for

her work as senior program coordi
nator for the Black Community
Services Center and as president of
the service-oriented sorority Alpha
Kappa Alpha.
I3rown also served as financial
chair for the Black Liberation
Month Planning Committee. She
helped raise more than $10,000,
which was used to help bring au
thor Maya Angelou to campus.
Balancing her service work with
schoolwork and other commit
ments "made it very interesting,
but these are all commitments I
love and will commit time to,"
Brown said.
Marisol Negr6n, a doctorrl stu
dent in Spanish and Portuguese,
is a graduate assistant at El Cen
tro Chicano and co-editor of La
Conexion, a graduate student
newsletter.
Negron, who has been involved
in the Latino community since her
undergraduate years, said that it
can be challenging for graduate stu
dents to be involved in extra-curric
ular activities because they are so
involved in their research.
"El Centra has made a proactive
effort to reach out to graduate stu

dents in the past few years," she
said. "It has been very gratifying to
bring graduate students to El Cen
tro and to create a support network
for them."
Tin Gazivoda, a coterminal stu
dent in international policy studies,
created the Bosnian Student Em
powerment Project, which collects
computers and network equipment
for Bosnian students.
He is organizing an internation
al conference to look at policy in
Southeastern Europe.
"International affairs are not ad
dressed as much as they should be

at a university of this magnitude,"
Gazivoda said. "The war in Bosnia
gives students a chance to think
about issues they don't always
think about."
Junior Lisa Rubin, a political sci
ence major and president of the In
tersorority Council, was recognized
for her efforts to expand sorority in
volvement in the Women's Center
and community service, such as
Habitat for Humanity.
"I was thrilled to receive the
award, but I see it more as an
achievement for women in the
Greek community," Rubin said.

Other students who received the
Lyons Award were seniors Sun
shine Sykes, Angela Amarillas,
Candace Lundgren, Jesse Moya,
Atesa Farshian, Anita Yuen,
Michael Putnam, Eileen Lai, Sonja
Ho, Jabrina Walker, Patricia Fer
