### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
An organization of alumni from the Gradu
ate School of Business is now celebrating its
10th year of volunteering financial consulting
services to a wide range of foundations and
charities in the Bay Area.
In the last 10 years, the Alumni Consulting
Team has offered its services to more than 180
nonprofit organizations in the Bay Area, rang
ing from the Film Arts Foundation to the
Alzheimer's Association to Habitat for Hu
manity.
Designed by two alumni in 1987, the team it
self is a nonprofit organization that volunteers
services that would regularly cost up to
$750,000.
Since its inception, the team has grown to
include more than 400 Business School alum
ni.
Chairman of the ACT board, Arthur Roth,
class of '49, said he was glad he was able to give
back to the community.
"Many of the team volunteers are busy, busy
people," Roth said. "But they want to give
something back."

Roth said volunteerism has become espe
cially important as the government pulls back
on its public assistance.
One of the team's projects advised the Oak
land Children's Fairyland and helped turn the
10-acre storybook theme park back into a pros
perous organization.
Fairyland representative Nancy Stark said
the park was getting "run down and there were
a lot of problems" before the team analyzed its
situation.
"I wrote a proposal and submitted it to the
team," Stark said. "The team gave us a mar
keting strategy, research evaluation and finan
cial analysis, which were very helpful."
Stark, who said customer feedback has been
positive, said she was pleased with the results
of the combined efforts of the team and the
park.
The consultants are "a wonderful resource,
and we worked well as a team," she said.
The teams assigned to the projects consist of
about six people. They work together 10 to 12
hours a month, studying the case and formu
lating a strategy for the organization.
Ken Kam, the chairman of the ACT Man
agement Committee, said he enjoys working

with the team because it is rewarding to help
organizations and work with other Stanford
alumni.
"The team allows us to help organizations
that are important to us," Kam said. "I can
have a much greater impact on organizations
through the team than I could with a money
contribution."
As chair of the management committee,
Kam decides which alumni serve on each pro
ject's committee.
Kam said Stanford alumni have acquired
tools that they can share with organizations
who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford
them.
As for the future of the Alumni Consulting
Team, both Roth and Kam said they would like
to see the organization spread nationwide.
"I would love to see a greater participation
by alumni in other parts of the country," Roth
said. "Also, there are more than 6,000 alumni
from the Business School who live in the Bay
Area. We need to set an example."
The team offers financial consulting to orga
nizations that need guidance. Strictly nonprof
it, the team only accepts projects that are non
political and nonreligious, Roth said.
