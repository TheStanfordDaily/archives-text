here reveals himself as a romantic. His
analysis and renderings of this obscure
poem become the perfect metaphor for
exploring the mysterious nature of
human intelligence. The author of
"Godel, Escher, Bach," Hofstader is the
director for the Center for Research on
Concepts and Cognition at Indiana
University. He speaks at 8 p.m. at Print
