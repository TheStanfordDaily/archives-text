# The
						word on "Grease!"
## 
### 
The eternal story of boy meets girl, boy
falls for girl, boy loses girl, boys gets buck with
girl is what the plav "Urease!" basically boils
down to. While predictable ih itself, the story
has been a hit musical for more than 20 years.
From the Broadway musical to the cult-clas
sic movie starring Mm Travolta and Olivia
Newton John, "Grease!" is the word;
Set in the 19505, when staying out past 11
p.m. was considered risque, "Grease!" evokes
all the stereotypes of the time: poodle skirts,
gas-guzzling dinosaur cars, drive-in movies
and sock hops.
So you've got the good, clean cut kids on
one side, and the dangerous, deviant, leather
jacket wearing "greasers" on the other —■
hence the play's name, fust exactly how much
oil is trapped under their hair only Exxon
knows.
The plot revolves around two cute stu
dents (so cute you know they have to get to
gether): Danny Zuko, the leader of the pack,
and t he new girl in town, Patty Simcox, Zuko,
from the wrong side of the tracks, is in love
with Simcox, who is from an uptight, mid
dle-class family. Sound familiar?
The problem is not that the parents object
we never even see parents in this produc
tion — but that Zuko is concerned about his
image. It doesn't look good when the high
school tough guy falls for little Miss Manners.
Problems ensue, everything from the guys
thinking the make-out master Zuko has gone

soft to the greaser girls saying Simcox isn't
cool enough to stay in their clique. It seems
rather odd to begin with that she would
choose to hang out with the "nastier" crowd,
as 1 would have expected her to move with
the Good I housekeeping herd. But leaps of
faith are needed. The problems get worked .
out — its a predictable and saccharine plot
line and ending.
But just because you know how the play Is
going to turn out doesn't mean you shouldn't
go see it. Even though there is really no sense
of anticipation, the costumes are great and
the scenes well performed.
And the actors really get into their roles.
They light up cigarettes on stage and curse,
just like the greasers of old would have done.
1 think I could have done without the smok
ing realism; the folks in front of me were fan
ning away the stench.
The performance of Sally Struthers in
particular as the ruler-slapping, authoritari
an, high school teacher Ms. Lloyd is quite hi
larious. She tries to draw the audience in by
chastising some late comers, acting as prud
ish as possible. (Oh, don't we all have a Ms.
Lloyd in the past?) One memorable event was
when one of Zuko's buddies spikes the punch
and gets her drunk as a skunk, as the termi
nology goes.
The music is memorable as well. The clas
sic "Grease!" theme is something you will
want to sing along with and have in your head

1 driving all the way hack trt the I arm.
