# IN THE BEGINNING...
## MUSICIAN NICK THOMPSON'S INFLUENCES FROM START TO FINISH 
### 
"In the beginning, I was genuinely shitty," senior Nick
Thompson confessed.
Having heard his first album, "Red Weather," and his latest,
"Sometimes Splatter Paints," I found it difficult to believe that
Thompson could have enjoyed such an inauspicious begin
ning. However, he assured me that his first battles with his
acoustic guitar yielded little more than painfully atonal at
tempts at classic hits of the '60s, '70s and '80s.
Thompson was originally attracted to the guitar at 15, in
spired by a cousin who was"the sexy guy in your school. You
know the one — the one who would sing 'Rocky Raccoon.' "
Though Thompson's hair sported Slash-worthy body and
shine, the opening chords to "Welcome to the Jungle" escaped
him. Frustrated, he abandoned his leather-pants pretensions
and enrolled in guitar camp to try and make some sense of his
tool.
At the National Guitar Summer Workshop, Thompson met
his musical guide, Seth Austen. After his first exposure to the
works of fingerstyle guitarists Leo Kottke and Michael Hedges,
Thompson was hooked.
"For the first time I was practicing because I loved to play,
not because I had to," he said. "And I began listening to music
more intently, trying to figure out what it was about a certain
piece that made me like it."
Despite his study at the workshop, Thompson never learned
how to read and write music. Instead, he relies on a combina
tion of images and instinct. "If I'm writing a song, I'll look at my
left hand and think, 'Nine third, ninth fret, hammer on the
eighth and third with the pinkie,' " while the right hand is "just
instinct and what feels right," he explained.

Without a concrete form of notation, there are some songs
that he forgets immediately. "The other day, I was listening to
'Red Weather' and realized that I'd completely forgotten how to
play one of the songs," Thompson said.
He stressed, though, that his music isn't "a random set of
notes that sound neat I usually end up writing out of a
strong mood: happy, sad, frustrated or chaotic. But I'm always
writing about specific things. 'Ylime,' for instance, is a song
about the emotions I associate with Emily," a woman whom
Thompson dated last year. (The song derives its name from
Emily's e-mail address.)
Thompson's cover tunes also capture the essential nature of
the original songs. He eschews imitation for interpretation
when composing his versions of "Purple Haze" and "Eleanor

Rigby."
" 'Eleanor Rigby' is this amazingly sad song about a very
lonely person. Rather than figuring out the melody and playing
it — which my ear's too inept to do anyway — I'd rather play
what the song's about to me," he said.
The title of Thompson's new album, "Sometimes Splatter
Paints," took a good deal more thought than "Red Weather."
"I'd wanted to tie in Pablo Neruda, whom I like a lot,"
Thompson said. "He has this line: 'Sometimes 1 get up early and
even my soul is wet.' At the same time, I didn't want to be the
pretentious fingerstyle guitarist who quotes poetry. I started
thinking about the image of a splatter painter: I le just kind of
does his thing, and either the painting works or it doesn't. It re
minds me a lot of the way in which I make music. So I married
the two and got 'Sometimes Splatter Paints'."
Though his style continues to evolve, Thompson influences
remain rooted in classic jazz, rock and fingerstyle guitar. Kottke
and Hedges still have a pull on Thompson's musical aesthetic,
as do John Coltrane, John Mclaughlin, Miles Davis, Jimi Hen
drix, Keith Jarrett and the Russian composer Dmitri
Shostakovich.
Thompson also cites his father as a major influence in his
musical development. "I learned through him what it's like to
love music," he said. As a child, Thompson was encouraged to
memorize Beethoven symphonies that his father would later
quiz him on.
"There was a point at which I could tell you who was going
to sing next in 'The Marriage of Figaro' or summarize the plot
of' Don Giovanni'," Thompson said. "I lost most of that when
my parents divorced and my father moved away, but it's defi
nitely still in me on some level."
Now, they'll be sitting in a car and his father will turn on the
radio and ask him, "What century is this from? Who's the com
poser?"
" 'Sounds like a violin' is what I'll usually say," joked Thomp-

son. "Then I'll put one of my tapes in and
ask him 'Is this Jimi Uendrix or Miles
Davis?' "
"We're teaching each other a lot about
our loves. I teach him about late-'6os jazz
fusion, while he tells me about 18th-centu
ry classical music."
Another musical influence is Thomp
sons childhood friend from Brookline,
Mass., Taylor Bynum.

"He was my best friend, and a brilliant
trumpet player," Thompson said.
When both boys were 13, Bynum gave
Thompson a cassette called "Jazz for Nick,
Vol. 1." The tape contained Coltrane's
"Giant Steps" on one side and Davis' "Kind
of Blue" on the other.
The series continued on birthdays and
Ghristmases, and the tapes are now in the
21st volume. The most recent one contains
"intense Don Cherry and Charlie Haden
trumpet / bass-driven compositions," and

the series as a whole documents the phases
of Bynum's musical passions.
"It sounds funny, hut those tapes have ac
tually formed a great part of my jazz knowl
edge," Thompson said.
Bynum and Thompson have also done
duets together. They wrote a piece for
Thompson's sister when she got engaged.
"There aren't that many trumpet / guitar
duets, I know," Thompson said. "We put to
gether a piece by having Taylor play long
trumpet notes, sort of like Davis' 'Sketches

of Spain.' I'd do drones on my guitar," creat
ing what Thompson called a "spacey quali
ty" as he brought an invisible joint to his lips
to clarify his meaning.
Shortly after several hundred copies of
"Sometimes Splatter Paints" arrive at Stan
ford (hopefully today), Thompson plans to
have a celebration concert in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden. Stock up on Neruda and
splatter paint, and stake out the Gates of
Hell.
