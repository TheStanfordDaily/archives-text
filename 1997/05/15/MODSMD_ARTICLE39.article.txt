want to put on a show,
good. But wait. Sixty people want to put on a show that
has never been done before. Yeah, we 11... but wait. Sixty
people want to put on a show that's never been done and
perform it in a space where there's never been a perfor
mance! Are these people fools?
Yes, in a way. And when their dream comes true starting
tomorrow night — at a magical locale that wasn't noticed
before they saw it, on a stage that wasn't there before they
built it, in a surge of song and laughter that wasn't felt before
they shared it — you probably won't want to miss it.
The Ram's Head special project, "Fool's Dream," an orig
inal medieval musical comedy, is coming soon to a lovely
outdoor amphitheater that's nearer than you think.
"Fool's Dream" is the two-year dream of its co-creators, se
nior Jeremy Desmon and Deron Sedy, Class of' 96. Desmon
and Sedy conceived the show together over several months
before Sedy set out to write the script. Desmon, who is also the
director, created the music and wrote most of the lyrics.
"It started just as a thought that we should write some
thing together," said Sedy. "And then, suddenly, somewhere
along the line, it turned into this serious project with real
possibility and potential."
Desmon and producer Jennie Caleshu, a junior, easily
persuaded Ram's Head to sponsor "Fool's Dream" as its first
special project in five years. In doing so, Ram's Head reaf
firmed its role as one of the few outlets for original theater
on campus.
"Stanford needs to encourage its students to create from
their hearts and at the same time provide them with an av
enue through which to express their visions," said senior
Nicole Marmon, a member of the cast. "By supporting this
show, Ram's Head is doing just that."
Desmon, who directed Big Game Gaieties in the fall, con
siders directing the show as the final step in bringing it to life.
"It's exciting to sec the 2 1 /2 dimensions we gave the char
acters on paper become three over the course of rehearsals,"
he said. "The actors and artistic staff created the characters
just as much as the writers did. The talent in the show is
amazing, and I'll only take credit for assembling them all in
the same room so they could play together."
And play together they do. A visit to a recent rehearsal re
vealed the cast energetically engaged in a series of warm-ups
that seemed pretty silly.
"Jeremy firmly believes that college students should
spend more time playing third-grade games similar to mu
sical chairs," said cast member Kim Coffey, a sophomore.
"He could make a root canal fun."
The cast whirled through the show's wide range of musi
cal numbers, from a dainty ditty called "Not Me," to a

wildly comic prince's duet, "Courtship of a Princess," to
the soft, reflective "Something Pretty."

Caleshu was also there observing, obviously excit
ed to see it all coming together.

" 'Fool's Dream' has been a miracle of persever
ance," she said. "It would never have happened
without all these amazingly dedicated people."

She means people like junior Holly Crafts who,
after Ram's Head's "City of Angels," is performing
in her second big show in a month.

"Any show takes a lot out of you, like sleep — I
just haven't been getting any," she said. Pause. The

cast chuckles. "Sleep! Sleep is what 1 meant!" The
cast chortles.

All of this is part of the process. These people are

here because they love to create.

"We get the opportunity to develop these characters that

have never been seen or heard before," said senior John
Chakan, a cast member who also serves on the Ram's Head

Board of Directors. "When we step on stage, we

know that the audience will be discovering
the show along with us.'

On the surface, "Fool's Dream" is another

fun medieval musical, a slightly campy

"Camelot" that takes itself more seriously

5 than "Once Upon a Mattress." The tale un
folds in the days preceding a royal festival at

which the king of the tiny nation of Dun

more is to announce his daughter

Daphne's engagement. Two foreign
princes are vying for the princess'

hand, as is a local

night

named
Si r

Thomas.
Add to this a

secret admirer
whose identity is

known only to Jim Putnam, a

crazy old villager who won't reveal his knowledge unless the
king appoints him as the country's first naval captain; Dun
more is land-locked.
Scattered through the plot is a crowd of colorful charac
ters, from a shifty royal adviser to a pair of bickering
duchesses. Faithfully following the foibles of the royals is a
tavern's worth of wise-cracking peasants who feel powerless
yet relieved that all the problems aren't theirs to solve.
As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the royals, in
many ways, are just as helpless as the peasants. They, too, are
stuck in roles that keep them from true happiness. Gradu
ally, the characters realize that many limits of society are
simply self-imposed. To dream that more is possible does

not necessarily make one a fool.
"The great thing about this show is that it says, 'Hey, it's
OK to pursue a dream, even if people think it's crazy," said
senior Paul D'Albora, who plays "Captain" Jim Putnam. "It
says, 'Be part of a fool's dream....' Pretty good advice, if you
ask me.'
The venue for the show is an original in itself. Mercke
Green is a sloping grassy courtyard nestled between Herrin
Hall and the Gilbert Biological Sciences Building, just west
of the Oval. Hidden in the fringes of the techie side of cam
pus, Mercke Green was a "theater-in-the-park" just waiting
to be discovered.
Back in February, "Fool's Dream" was facing its first ob
stacle when all the viable performance spaces were already
reserved. But walking home from class one day, Desmon no
ticed Mercke Green and imagined what it might look like
with a stage and an audience. He and Caleshu returned that
night, and when they saw how beautiful it seemed under the
stars, they were sold.
The fact that Mercke Green was not designed as a perfor
mance space presented a challenge for technical director
Dan Maidenberg and his crew, whose mission was to put up
a show where no show had gone before.
"It's like setting up a stage on your own back lawn, com
plete with lights, sets, everything to support a 30-person
musical," Maidenberg, a sophomore, said. "You start to miss
the things you take for granted when you're in a theater —
like walls."
The stage for the show had to be built, literally, from the
ground up. The cast and crew spent an entire day construct
ing and painting the stage's 14 separate platform pieces.
These pieces were later assembled by the crew into a 200-
square-foot stage with alternating levels.
There were other challenges that productions in conven
tional spaces never face. Maidenberg pointed out that the
Biology Department has been helpful with some issues,
such as Finding ways to tap enough electricity for two light
trees and resetting the lawn's sprinkler system to ensure that
the cast and audience stay dry.

According to ' laidenberg, the staff had to overcome
limited resources a d a tight budget to create an array of
set pieces that include a seven-foot dragon's tooth.

"Ideally, we'd be building [the tooth] out of a tita
nium honeycomb carbon-fiber reinforced composite,"
said set designer Elliot Sather, a senior. "But that's about

25 grand, so we're probably just going to stick to a chick
enwire frame with papier mache."

In the end, the cast and staff of "Fool's Dream" have
crafted a solid show, one that is remarkable for its quali

ty, not just its originality.
"I'm happy to be part of this because it's a wonderful

show," Marmon said. "Most of all, it has allowed me to help
make my friend Jeremy's dream a reality."
'It was a learning experience all the way through," Sedy
said. "At first we didn't know if we were going to produce it,
and even now, we don't know where the show goes from
here."
lo Broadway maybe? After all, the new musical "Jekyll
and Hyde," which recently garnered four Tony Award nom
inations, was born while its composer was still an under
graduate at USC.
"Well, 1 don't know about that," Desmon said. "All I know
is that together we've created something out of nothing, and
we re all pretty excited. That part of the dream is coming
true." Q

5 than "Once Upon a Mattress." The tale un
folds in the days preceding a royal festival at

which the king of the tiny nation of Dun

more is to announce his daughter

Daphne's engagement. Two foreign
princes are vying for the princess'

hand, as is a local

night

named
Si r

Thomas.
Add to this a

secret admirer
whose identity is

known only to Jim Putnam, a

crazy old villager who won't reveal his knowledge unless the
king appoints him as the country's first naval captain; Dun
more is land-locked.
Scattered through the plot is a crowd of colorful charac
ters, from a shifty royal adviser to a pair of bickering
duchesses. Faithfully following the foibles of the royals is a
tavern's worth of wise-cracking peasants who feel powerless
yet relieved that all the problems aren't theirs to solve.
As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the royals, in
many ways, are just as helpless as the peasants. They, too, are
stuck in roles that keep them from true happiness. Gradu
ally, the characters realize that many limits of society are
simply self-imposed. To dream that more is possible does

not necessarily make one a fool.
"The great thing about this show is that it says, 'Hey, it's
OK to pursue a dream, even if people think it's crazy," said
senior Paul D'Albora, who plays "Captain" Jim Putnam. "It
says, 'Be part of a fool's dream....' Pretty good advice, if you
ask me.'
The venue for the show is an original in itself. Mercke
Green is a sloping grassy courtyard nestled between Herrin
Hall and the Gilbert Biological Sciences Building, just west
of the Oval. Hidden in the fringes of the techie side of cam
pus, Mercke Green was a "theater-in-the-park" just waiting
to be discovered.
Back in February, "Fool's Dream" was facing its first ob
stacle when all the viable performance spaces were already
reserved. But walking home from class one day, Desmon no
ticed Mercke Green and imagined what it might look like
with a stage and an audience. He and Caleshu returned that
night, and when they saw how beautiful it seemed under the
stars, they were sold.
The fact that Mercke Green was not designed as a perfor
mance space presented a challenge for technical director
Dan Maidenberg and his crew, whose mission was to put up
a show where no show had gone before.
"It's like setting up a stage on your own back lawn, com
plete with lights, sets, everything to support a 30-person
musical," Maidenberg, a sophomore, said. "You start to miss
the things you take for granted when you're in a theater —
like walls."
The stage for the show had to be built, literally, from the
ground up. The cast and crew spent an entire day construct
ing and painting the stage's 14 separate platform pieces.
These pieces were later assembled by the crew into a 200-
square-foot stage with alternating levels.
There were other challenges that productions in conven
tional spaces never face. Maidenberg pointed out that the
Biology Department has been helpful with some issues,
such as Finding ways to tap enough electricity for two light
trees and resetting the lawn's sprinkler system to ensure that
the cast and audience stay dry.

According to ' laidenberg, the staff had to overcome
limited resources a d a tight budget to create an array of
set pieces that include a seven-foot dragon's tooth.

"Ideally, we'd be building [the tooth] out of a tita
nium honeycomb carbon-fiber reinforced composite,"
said set designer Elliot Sather, a senior. "But that's about

25 grand, so we're probably just going to stick to a chick
enwire frame with papier mache."

In the end, the cast and staff of "Fool's Dream" have
crafted a solid show, one that is remarkable for its quali

ty, not just its originality.
"I'm happy to be part of this because it's a wonderful

show," Marmon said. "Most of all, it has allowed me to help
make my friend Jeremy's dream a reality."
'It was a learning experience all the way through," Sedy
said. "At first we didn't know if we were going to produce it,
and even now, we don't know where the show goes from
here."
lo Broadway maybe? After all, the new musical "Jekyll
and Hyde," which recently garnered four Tony Award nom
inations, was born while its composer was still an under
graduate at USC.
"Well, 1 don't know about that," Desmon said. "All I know
is that together we've created something out of nothing, and
we re all pretty excited. That part of the dream is coming
true." Q
