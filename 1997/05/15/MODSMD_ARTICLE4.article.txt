## 
### T.J. Babbitt 
Former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher has been
named co-chair of the Campaign
for Stanford Law School, an am
bitious five-year endeavor the
school is undertaking to raise
money for its faculty and stu
dents.
Law School officials expressed
excitement at the fact that
Christopher, an alumnus, will be
joining the fund-raising cam
paign, which is now in its second
year.
"The interest and involvement
of Warren Christopher under
lines the importance of our cam
paign and will help inspire contin
ued efforts to raise the support
Stanford Law School needs to re
main at the forefront of legal edu

cation," Law School Dean Paul
Brest said in a press release.
Christopher "will add luster
and excitement to the endeavor,"
said Susan Bell, an associate dean
at the Law School.
The former Secretary of State
has a long history with Stanford.
He earned both a bachelor's de
gree and a law degree here and
later chaired the Board of
Trustees from 1985 to 1988.
This year, he rejoined Los An
geles law firm O'Melveny & Mey
ers after leaving President Clin
ton's Cabinet. lie was asked to
help with the fund-raising efforts
by Brest and campaign chair
James Gaither, Class of' 64.
According to Bell, the fund is
designed to be used primarily to
support new faculty chairs and
scholarships for students.
"The Law School identified
close to $100 million worth of
needs that hopefully we'll be able
to address," she said.
The fund originally sought to
raise $50 million. In the past 18
months, almost $55 million has
been raised; this led the school to
raise its fundraising target to $75
million. The campaign is sched

uled to run through 1999.
The school hopes to restore
eight faculty positions that were
allowed to lapse due to budget
cutting measures. It also wants to
raise faculty salaries. Bell said
faculty salaries at the Law School
were 20 to 40 percent below
salaries at peer institutions.
The school also plans to use
revenue to fund public service in
ternships for recent graduates.
These measures are intended to
address mounting financial pres
sures on law students.
"The debt burden was getting
to be much too high, and it was

even starting to affect career
choices," Gaither said.
He added that the need for a
large fund-raising campaign to
address the school's needs was "a
reflection of the financial con
straints of the entire University
over the last five to 10 years."
Bell emphasized that Christo
pher will have an active role as co
chair of the fund.
"He'll participate in a whole
host of activities," she said.
Christopher will be a keynote
speaker on an international diplo
macy panel at Alumni Weekend
this fall.

Gaither, who headed the Board
of Trustees after Christopher and
is now a partner at the San Fran
cisco law firm Cooley Godward,
praised his colleague.
"It's nice to have an old friend
come home to the Law School," he
said.
"There is no greater honor for
me than to serve alongside this
most distinguished fellow gradu
ate," Gaither said in a letter to the
school. "I believe his participation
adds further confirmation of the
fundamental importance of the
campaign to the future of the Law
School."
