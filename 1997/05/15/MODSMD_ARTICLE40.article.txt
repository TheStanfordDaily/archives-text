## Stanford Drama Department and director Jac Royce on Shakespeare's nastiest villain 
### 
Jac Royce, the director of the Drama Department's pro
duction of "Richard III," is a third-year doctoral student in
the combined Drama and Humanities Program. Last year,
Royce directed Shakespeare's "Henry V" as part of Stan-

ford's "Shakespeare Al Fresco" summer series.
This is what Royce had to say to Intermission
about her latest production.
I: Do you really bring out the evil villain in
Richard III? It seems like you have to emphasize
that aspect of him.
JR: The play "Richard III" has almost no bear
ing to the history. But because it's a history play
and because Shakespeare wrote it and people still
pay attention to what Shakespeare wrote, it tends
to be what people think is the true story, and it's
not. It's based on the versions that were written by
the historians of Henry VII. When Henry took
over he basically just spent the next 20 years
trashing Richard because it's never OK to over
throw a legitimate king, especially if you buy the
divine right of kings ... which they absolutely
did, and so Richard's been blamed for everything.
I: How closely are you sticking to the original
text?
JR: We've had to cut some (text) just for time,
but we haven't moved any words around. I've
combined a few characters partly because there
are so many characters in the story that if you're
not familiar with British history, you're not going
to get what's happening. . .. Among other things,
everyone has the same name, which is partly in
there just so that you get that it's really just one
giant inbred family that's squabbling over who
gets to have power.
[The text] is simplified only in the sense that a
few things that you'd really have to have a lot of
background to catch have been cut. A couple of
jokes that are based on wordplays on words that
we don't use anymore have been cut.. .. And be
cause we have a few cases where there are women
playing parts that were originally written for
men, we've changed 'my lords' to 'my ladies' and
'sirs' to 'friends' and things like that, but other
than that it's really straight.
I: When you say women playing parts that were
originally written for men, was that written for
boys to be playing women?
JR: No, we do have women playing the parts
that are gendered as women. My premise is that
there would have been more parts written for
women if there had been women actors. Not hav
ing women in the English theater [is) a paradigm
you just have to work with, and so you really only
write women characters when gender is part of
what's being discussed.
But there are piles of male characters who real
ly have nothing to do with gender or race, so
they're freer. It's easier because they're not dis
cussing gender, because they're not getting any
one pregnant or whatever. You really get a lot of
freedom in being able to cast whoever shows up
who's the best actor for the part.
Another thing that happens I think because of
having women in some of these parts is that you
can really see that one of the ways that Richard
works his way to the top is by seducing everybody.
Sometimes the language really feeds the seductive

aspects of that, and you can see it really clearly when the
person he is talking to is a woman instead of a man. But
without changing the language you still get that relation
ship, which is pure Machiavelli.
I: So not only is there a text of seduction, but Richard is also

EVERYBODY LOVES A GOOD VILLAIN, and in the Drama Depart
ment's presentation of "Richard 111" we get to thoroughly enjoy the evil
of Richard (played by Abhi Katyal), arguably the most ruthless villain
in all of Shakespeare. From Richard's first aside, we know that this man is
bad, but discovering just how bad is part of the fan.
As the story unfolds, we see that Richard is a master schemer. His goal is
nothing short than the crown, and so with a marvelous maliciousness he be
gins to eliminate the obstacles in his path. The first of the noblemen to go is
his brother Clarence (Jordan Gelber). Next, Richard seduces Lady Anne (Ju
lianne Arnall), the wife of a man he has just gotten killed. One by one Richard
eliminates the competition by either killing them or winning them to him
with his charm, eventually becoming crowned king. Of course, in the tradi
tion of many of the Bard's works, the play doesn't end until the action is com
plicated with a fast and furious swordfight in which evil is trounced in the
name of good.
Don't be put off by all the murder. "Richard III" is genuinely fun due to
the strong direction of director Jac Royce. The play flows extremely well, as
Royce was able to find both the humorous and tragic elements inherent in
"Richard lIP and bring them to the surface. Katyal, as the deformed Richard,
is terrific as he engages the audience, letting us into the depths of his machi
nations as a conspirator.
It is, however, the powerful supporting cast that makes the show a success.
There wasn't a weak performance from any in the cast the night I saw the
show. It was obvious that everyone involved in the show took it extremely se
riously. The only real difficulty was the number of names and titles of char
acters. Sometimes it was difficult to decipher who was related to whom.
However, the sheer number of names (which all seem to be George, Edward,
Henry or some variation thereof) doesn't really interfere with a basic under
standing of the plot.
The sets (designed by Allen Blue) and lights (designed by Michael Ram
saur) work well to facilitate the complex action of the play. There are some
visually breathtaking moments, accented beautifully by the rhythms of Stan
ford Taiko drummer Kristofer Bergstrom.
Overall, "Richard III" is a delightful mix of good direction, strong acting
and orchestrated design. The show is well worth your time.

an incarnation of vice and evil. That almost becomes a state
ment about the role of sexuality in the play.
JR: In the mystery plays, which Shakespeare often drew
from, Vice is also always the comic character, the one who
is the most fun and the one you catch yourself identifying

with. Which 1 personally think is one of the rea
sons why they outlawed the mystery plays; it's be
cause it just made evil look too good. . . . And so
that's also one of the things that I think that is
kind of surprising about Richard, or surprises ac
tors when they start prepping for Richard, is all
his humor.
/: Richard is a constant actor.
JR: That's the main thing we've been working
with, especially for the first half of the show
which he kind of narrates. He comes down and
he tells the audience what they're going to see,
and then he steps into the scene. The audience
sees the real guy but in the scene he's just like an
actor, he just plays the scene, and so the other
people don't catch it. There are actually places
where I think he even starts to fool the audience,
so that when he steps back out of the scene, [ he}
reminds them that he was just fucking with
them.
I: It's an interesting mechanism.
JR: 1 love it. I think it's great. He sort of sets up
the audience like this little seminar, and they're
all learning how to be Richard 111. He comes
down and tells them how, and then he goes and
does it, and then he comes back and says, "Did
you see that?" — which I think is really fun, part
of why he's such fun. Despite yourself, you start to
root for him, I think.
Which is also (why) he quits talking to the au
dience, maybe in the middle of the fourth act.
You have to have him quit talking to the audience
in order to get the audience to really like Rich
mond, who is Henry VII, and to want Richmond
to win.
/: What contemporary sensibilities have you
brought to the play?
JR: Just the fact that you have women in posi
tions of power and that about half or more of the
leads are people of color. Also, Shakespearean
language is actually very naturalistic language.
It's crammed with imagery, but it's mostly very
easy to speak once you let go of all the 19th cen
tury Sturm-und-Drang stuff, so it just feels con
temporary. Little things, like the way that we eel
ebrate, that we would high-five each other, that
we would hug each other. It probably looks and
feels familiar, but it's not up-to-date.
Rather than laying a concept on, I like to find it
[within] the play. I really like to give feed out of the
play for how it changes into our culture instead of
coming up with, like, "OK, we're doing the mob ver
sion," which would work, you know, with Richard
111. But instead of trying to set it in a specific place
and in a specific time, you just let it be. D
