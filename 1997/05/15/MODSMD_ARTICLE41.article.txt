"Oh , aoD.
"We played at
a. Chinese
RESTA.URA.NT ONCE
FOR SOMEONE ' S
21st birthday, "

said Brian Nevin, the drummer for Big Head I'odd and
the Monsters.
But after playing two encores at a sold-out Warfield
performance in San Francisco last week, he laughs at
the memory.
"I don't think mow we'd play in a Chinese restaurant"
he said.
Indeed, now the band, consisting of lead singer and
guitarist Todd Park Mohr, bassist Rob Squires and
Ncvin, is more likely to be seen performing on "The
Late Show with David Letterman" and to be heard
broadcasting from radio stations in New York or Los
Angeles — especially since the release of its fifth and
most recent album, "Beautiful World."
And yet, to look at Mohr 15 minutes after his voice
and guitar had put fans in a frenzy, one would be more
likely to think he was a Stanford student in the Arroyo
lounge than a rock star backstage after a gig. Immedi-

ately following the concert, Mohr was clad a navy T-shirt, blue
jeans, white socks and black Birks.
This transformation from silk shirt, slacks and black boots
to "I just rolled out of bed for my 8 a.m. lecture" attire is a re
verse parallel to the band's transformation.
What began as a group of friends that traipsed around a
Colorado high school's halls progressed to a college band that
cruised more than 400,000 miles in U.S. roads to spread its
music until its tunes were regular fare on stereos across the na
tion.
While attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, the
three, already a popular CU band, would travel to play at

venues in other cities
during school
breaks. As Nevin ex
plained it, since stu
dents went home to
their respective
towns, the band had
built-in pockets of
audiences scattered
throughout the
country.
When they'd per
form in these other
cities, "It'd be like a
little CU reunion,"
Nevin said.
But "little" and

"CU" pretty much summed up their listeners back then. They
had to play wherever they could — even in Chinese restau
rants. No one came asking them to play, so they had to ask oth
ers.
As Nevin recalled, on a trip to Tulane University in New Or
leans one summer, they "walked up and down frat row and lit
erally said, 'You want a band?' "
In those days when they were "playing for beer and a show
er," they had no aspirations to achieve what they have so far —
a platinum album, "Sister Sweetly" (1993), another almost
gold, "Strategem" (1994), as well as two independent albums

— "Another Mayberry" (1989) and "Midnight Radio" (1991).
"None of us planned on doing this," said Nevin, who was a
business major but said he couldn't imagine what he would be
doing if he weren't in the band.
Jokingly, he wondered whether he could go back to CU and
finish his business major, since he and Mohr dropped out of
school before graduating. Squires was one year ahead of them,
and the year he graduated, all three took what they thought
would be a single trip to Chicago to play a show. Mohr and
Nevin never went back.
"Basically our semester sabbatical's lasted six years," he said.
Though a sabbatical for most people is time off from work,
these high school and college buddies found their true work
then.
The first inklings of their upcoming fame came in 1991 after
they independently produced "Midnight Radio." Lacking the
financial support and connections to record professionally,
they bought a DAT machine and made the album themselves

from live recordings.
Little did they know they had created a
musical masterpiece that Rolling Stone
magazine effusively applauded and The
Washington Post placed on its top-10 list of
albums for the year.
Snagged by what was then Giant Records
(now Revolution), they next produced their
major label debut, "Sister Sweetly," in 1991.
And that's when Big Head Todd and the
Monsters really became big.
As acclaim for their chords crescendoed,
they no longer needed to tour incessantly to
make themselves heard. Although their
popularity has meant they've had both to
shift from homemade recordings to music
videos and to change out ofT-shirts into silk
shirts, Nevin doesn't find the change that
drastic.
"We have the opportunity to financially
and politically do what we want. It's fun to
explore what we can do. Ultimately, though,

the goal is the same," he said. The
goal being, that is, to play their
music.
He sees the change in
the way they dissemi
nate their music as a
necessary part of their
growing popularity.
"Commercially, being with a major label, you
have to [ make videos]. It's a marketing situation,"
he said, acknowledging that the group's videos are
less than stellar, simply because videos are "a differ
ent art form," and acting is not the art they practice.
So far, the five videos they've put out "have all been on the
light rotation — which is basically the 1 to 5 a.m. shift," he said
with a laugh.
As they've matured from midnight radio to midnight video,
their tunes have also taken on a harder edge. Even so, Nevin in
dicated no preference for either the simple acoustic sound or
the heavier, more distorted one.
"I'd be just as happy to go back and make a stripped down
record," Nevin said. It was impossible for him to favor one type
of music over another because style is so much a function of
their development as musicians.
"A record is really a representation of the band at the time,"
he said.
For instance, Nevin, citing the home-grown quality of
"Midnight Radio," said, "I think it's a real sincere record." Be
cause they were entirely in charge of it themselves, the result
was "not the sort of thing any record label would let you do.'
But, according to Nevin, they've never really catered to the
music industry's tastes anyway.
Hence, the logo that is übiquitous on all Big Head Todd and
the Monsters paraphernalia — the lone horseman.
"That's us, if I look at what we are from the outside — from
the world of rock 'n' roll," he said, "We kind of do our own
thing. And yet we're probably the biggest-selling least-known
band."
Another device to which the band has grown attached is a
pair of bull horns that sit on an amplifier during every concert.
"I think it was just something Todd had lying around his
room," he said. "We've always referred to them as our horn sec
tion."
He finds these two country-western references appropriate
symbols because "the whole mystique about country music ,
that it\s uncool." And being a band that has succeeded despiu
its often super-produced, image-oriented competition, the\
know what it is to be thought of as "uncool."
"We re very comfortable with being the underdogs," he said
But no one who saw them sovereign on the stage during las'
week's concert would have thought they were underdogs. God.
