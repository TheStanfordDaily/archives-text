## FROM COLLEGE BAND TO MONSTER SUCCESS

is more like it.
Fans showed these broken-hearted saviors their adulation
by yelling, "I love you Todd!" and zealously stomping
their feet to bring the band back for two long encores.
The enthusiasm of their following was a con
cern recently when the band decided to add two new members
to their tour — keyboardist Corey Mauser and blues singer
Ha/el Miller, who were rousing hits with the Warfield crowd
last week. But, Nevin said, a few months ago when they were
deciding whether to add Mauser and Miller, they worried
about how fans would react.
"The fans feel like they have possession of us — to them, it's
their band," he said. "You feel like you can't make a decision like
that without asking the fans if it's OK."
Even though they didn't ask, no one in attendance last week
amid have doubted that Mauser and Miller thrilled the al
ready-exuberant audience.
Mauser, hidden behind bushy sideburns, thick black frames
and 88 wooden keys, contributed his pianistic talent almost in
visibly with the exception of a few solos. In the moments that
showcased his talents, the clear call of the keyboard contrasted
nicely with the heavier sound in most of the music.
Miller had more of a chance to interact with the house per
v mally, and she did so by picking out a fan near the stage with
her pointer finger and eyeing them while she sang — or rather,
while she belted out power notes like a Harley-Davidson biker
revs up her engine.
The dynamism of her voice also had a visual counterpart in
her body language, which often mimicked the words she sang.
For instance, while singing the words "rain coming down" in
the new song, "Tower," she fluttered her hands and fingers
down to her sides like a gospel singer.
When the band said goodnight, the audience rewarded her
with a paroxysm of praise. Pleasantly surprised, she mouthed
,i "thank you."

The thanks, however, is all the band's. Nevin said of
Miller, "We were kind of surprised she wanted to come
around with us. And kind of honored." Back in Boul
der, the black blues vocalist has her own band, Hazel
and the Caucasians.
Mauser had worked with Big Head Todd and the
Monsters before, since his band, The Ugly Americans,
once had the same manager as Todd did. He played as
.111 unofficial fourth member on "Beautiful World,"
and Miller's voice also contributed to the album.
According to Nevin, the addition of Mauser and
Miller "frees us up now. With the extra instrumenta
tion, we can do more to fill out the sound. Now Todd's

not so stuck into what
the original trio] can
play."
Besides, since Mohr
writes many of the
songs on keyboard and
often writes in a
woman's vocal part, the
addition of these new
members was "a natur
al progression that just
made sense."
And as the band has
been discovering, these
new members give the
audience another thing
to swoon about — aside
from Mohr, of course,
who normally holds the
limelight.
Ironically, Nevin de
scribed Mohr as "not
the most comfortable
being in the spotlight."

mission could garner in the few moments we spent talking with
him, he seemed friendly hut reticent.
He said it was his night to be "liberated from the duty" of in
terviews, but he was willing to sign a few album covers and an
swer a few questions.
Because he is half-Korean, Intermission asked whether he
saw himself as a role model for other Asian-American musi
cians.
"No, not at all," Mohr replied and left it at that.
"He's very comfortable being by himself," said Nevin, who,
in contrast, is outgoing and talks easily.
As for Mohr, "I don't think he ever had a desire to be a
celebrity," Nevin said. "But he has a great passion for what he
does."
To relish in his off-hours from celeb-dom, Nevin said Mohr
secludes himself in a teepee he built on some land he owns in
Colorado.
The teepee was his chosen songwriting site for "Strategem."
Unfortunately, as Rolling Stone reported, it was also the chosen
breaking-and-entering site of a bear.
Although the lyrics survived the ursine assault, they did not
escape the assault of Mohr's hand, which bestowed upon them
a more universal quality than had been in his lyrics before.
"1 think he's gotten more ... 1 don't want to say ambiguous,
but he wants whatever he's written to have meaning for you,"
Nevin said.
Noting that Mohr sustains an interest in Eastern philoso
phy, Nevin said, "I think a lot of his songs are more spiritually
based than they seem." As Mohr himself writes in the CD liner
notes to "Strategem," many of the songs in that album arc
based on koans, which is "a certain type of riddle upon which
a Buddhist meditates to empty the mind of thoughts."
Even when a song ostensibly deals with a particular issue,
such as love, Nevin believes, it's "Love under the concept of Life
... and how they connect."

The origin of "Love Betsy" from "Midnight Radio" exem
plifies Mohr's inclination to universalize his lyrics. At a party,
Mohr overheard someone refer to women who are still sitting
at the bar at the night's end, not having gone home with any
one, as Love Bettys. Mohr thought he had said Love Betsy.
Afterwards, Mohr went home and wrote these lyrics: "Love
Betsy / Somebody is going to love you someday."
"Everyone can relate to it," Nevin said, because it's seeming
ly about love. The underlying meaning of the song, though, is
that "everyone has value and this is the way things work," said
Nevin.

When asked why Mohr modified his wav ol writing lyrit s
beginning with the "Stratcgem" album, Nevin replied,
"growth, change — to challenge himself.'
Then again, not all good songs need deep lyrics. Case in
point — "Boom Boom," a classic by blues singer John Lei
Hooker. This tune, which ended the first encore of last week's
concert, minimized Mohr's vocalizations to mere tnonosyllab
ic repetitions: "boomboomboomboom," "bangbangbang
bang," "hawhawhawhaw."
That song is one that big I lead lodd and the Monsters had
been playing for years before performing it on "Beautiful
World" — and with I looker himself.
"That was wild,' said Nevin, shaking his head as it still in
disbelief. "To work with one ol your heroes. You're presenting
someone with their song, and trying to get them to do it with
you."
Playing that, as well as .1 few other covers, the band also
culled numbers from all their albums lor the Warfield audi
ence. To the rapture of longtime fans, they played .1 good deal
ol the older pieces from their independent albums, such as
"Vincent of Jersey," "Love Betsy" and "Leaving Song.'
In that last song, I which was also the last song before the en
cores), the harmonica came back lor a guest appearance. A
soon as the song ended, Mohr whipped it off, whipped out .1
beer and said goodnight.
But he came back twice iust as he, Nevin and Squires kee|
coming back to San Irani isco since their e.irlvdays as ,1 band. Al
though the backdrop to the stage featured a colorful lit version ol
the Colorado f'latirons, Squires declared their love for the Bay
Area while 011 stage. I laving spent a lew months here last sum
mer recording, he said, it became "like .1 second home lor us."
Nevin recollected that they always used to play at the l ast
Day Saloon when they were in town. Other clubs these lone
cowboys frequented were Paradise Lounge and the I illnmr
Auditorium.
"We have a history here, working from the ground up," he said
Then again, that is also their history lor most plates, not just
the Bay Area. Nevin believes that they were able to succeed be
cause "we get along musically and personally.
I he old friendship between them gives a natural How to the
music-making process. Mohr writes the music and then he
brings it to Nevin and Squires, who elaborate on it.
"We all seem to fill a niche to do whatever we need," said
Nevin. The fusion of their talents has allowed them to build
their name to what it is now.
Oh, yeah, and about the name — "It was a silly thing. We
were probably drunk one night," said Nevin.
So they came up with the name "Big Head Todd" to mimic
one of their blues heroes, Kddic "Clean Head" Vinson.
"The best thing about it is, the music's got to be better than
the name," said Nevin.
Precisely. Because that is their forte — their music. II

escape the assault of Mohr's hand, which bestowed upon them
a more universal quality than had been in his lyrics before.
"1 think he's gotten more ... 1 don't want to say ambiguous,
but he wants whatever he's written to have meaning for you,"
Nevin said.
Noting that Mohr sustains an interest in Eastern philoso
phy, Nevin said, "I think a lot of his songs are more spiritually
based than they seem." As Mohr himself writes in the CD liner
notes to "Strategem," many of the songs in that album arc
based on koans, which is "a certain type of riddle upon which
a Buddhist meditates to empty the mind of thoughts."
Even when a song ostensibly deals with a particular issue,
such as love, Nevin believes, it's "Love under the concept of Life
... and how they connect."

The origin of "Love Betsy" from "Midnight Radio" exem
plifies Mohr's inclination to universalize his lyrics. At a party,
Mohr overheard someone refer to women who are still sitting
at the bar at the night's end, not having gone home with any
one, as Love Bettys. Mohr thought he had said Love Betsy.
Afterwards, Mohr went home and wrote these lyrics: "Love
Betsy / Somebody is going to love you someday."
"Everyone can relate to it," Nevin said, because it's seeming
ly about love. The underlying meaning of the song, though, is
that "everyone has value and this is the way things work," said
Nevin.

When asked why Mohr modified his wav ol writing lyrit s
beginning with the "Stratcgem" album, Nevin replied,
"growth, change — to challenge himself.'
Then again, not all good songs need deep lyrics. Case in
point — "Boom Boom," a classic by blues singer John Lei
Hooker. This tune, which ended the first encore of last week's
concert, minimized Mohr's vocalizations to mere tnonosyllab
ic repetitions: "boomboomboomboom," "bangbangbang
bang," "hawhawhawhaw."
That song is one that big I lead lodd and the Monsters had
been playing for years before performing it on "Beautiful
World" — and with I looker himself.
"That was wild,' said Nevin, shaking his head as it still in
disbelief. "To work with one ol your heroes. You're presenting
someone with their song, and trying to get them to do it with
you."
Playing that, as well as .1 few other covers, the band also
culled numbers from all their albums lor the Warfield audi
ence. To the rapture of longtime fans, they played .1 good deal
ol the older pieces from their independent albums, such as
"Vincent of Jersey," "Love Betsy" and "Leaving Song.'
In that last song, I which was also the last song before the en
cores), the harmonica came back lor a guest appearance. A
soon as the song ended, Mohr whipped it off, whipped out .1
beer and said goodnight.
But he came back twice iust as he, Nevin and Squires kee|
coming back to San Irani isco since their e.irlvdays as ,1 band. Al
though the backdrop to the stage featured a colorful lit version ol
the Colorado f'latirons, Squires declared their love for the Bay
Area while 011 stage. I laving spent a lew months here last sum
mer recording, he said, it became "like .1 second home lor us."
Nevin recollected that they always used to play at the l ast
Day Saloon when they were in town. Other clubs these lone
cowboys frequented were Paradise Lounge and the I illnmr
Auditorium.
"We have a history here, working from the ground up," he said
Then again, that is also their history lor most plates, not just
the Bay Area. Nevin believes that they were able to succeed be
cause "we get along musically and personally.
I he old friendship between them gives a natural How to the
music-making process. Mohr writes the music and then he
brings it to Nevin and Squires, who elaborate on it.
"We all seem to fill a niche to do whatever we need," said
Nevin. The fusion of their talents has allowed them to build
their name to what it is now.
Oh, yeah, and about the name — "It was a silly thing. We
were probably drunk one night," said Nevin.
So they came up with the name "Big Head Todd" to mimic
one of their blues heroes, Kddic "Clean Head" Vinson.
"The best thing about it is, the music's got to be better than
the name," said Nevin.
Precisely. Because that is their forte — their music. II
