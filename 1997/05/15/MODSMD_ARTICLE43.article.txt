## Regurgitator "Tu-Plang...Kon-Uauk" 
### 
Regurgitator is a fun hand to listen to. The
ear never quite gets used to the group's sound:
It's complex and unpredictable yet fundamen
tally solid. Regurgitator is ideal for the open
minded party crowd that appreciates nontra
ditional dance music.
Every song on "Tu-Plang" performs a duty

or fulfills a need — the album touches on surf,
hip-hop, techno, thrash and rap. It's a true
anti-pop recording. The CD, when placed in
the stereo, morphs into a middle finger aimed
straight at Beck. Whatever Beck is trying to do
with his music, this is how it's supposed to be
done.

The group doesn't take itself serious
ly, as exemplified by the first song, "I
Sucked a Lot of Cock to Get Where I
Am." The feel-good boyish alterna-pop
melody gets "Tu-Plang" going. It's the
album's used-car salesman — it doesn't
really let the audience know what it's in
for. The harmless "Cock" gets the un
suspected listener to visit the mad fun
house that is "Tu-Plang."
"Kong Foo Sing," the next track, is
trademark Regurgitator; it involves
wrenching, twisting rhythms, Beastie
white-boy raps, random noises and DJ
record scratches. The end of the song is
drowned out in martial arts groans and
punches. Butt-shaking is encouraged by
the irresistible techno groove of "G7
Dick Electro Boogie," while "Miffy's
Simplicity" cuts the rap and brings a
fuzzy grind guitar along for the ride.
"Miffy's" cheesy-romantic lyrics,
"We're always planning on running
away / So we can be together every day /
One day I know that all my dreams will
come true / And I'll be rocking in porch

rockers with you" are carried by bizarre lead
and background vocals.
Mellow rap, along with obtuse bass lines
and snappy drums make "Social Disaster" a
triumph. It's the sound of contemporary hip
hop getting flushed down the toilet before get
ting Fed Ex-ed to the Twilight Zone. Distorted
and nonconventional vinyl scratches put on
the finishing touches.
Nobody in the group, composed of drum
mer Martin Lee, guitarist / vocalist Quan Yeo
mans and bassist / vocalist Benjamin Ely, does
the same thing twice. Lee is a real standout: His
rhythms are fresh, brilliant and hard to come
by in today's music scene. He incorporates a
different pace and a change-up in style on all of
Regurgitator's songs. Lee can roll the toms and
crash the cymbals with the best of 'em, but
there's more to him than that.
"Manana" is a slower tune with sluggish vo
cals, wavy guitar and a medium tempo
rhythm. It acts as a sedative, lulling the listener
to a drowsy state before being blasted by
"F. 5.0." The listener is kept on his / her toes by
the song's manic drums and upbeat Ely bass
pounding.
The only drawback to "Tu-Plang" is its lack
of focus. The extraneous sound bites and off
the-wall grooves make it an outstanding
album, but there isn't an underlying theme,
which would push the album to its absolute
artistic limit.
