## "Straightaways" 
### 
Son Volt's second album finds the group
mining the same seam that made frontman lay
Farrar's first band, Uncle Tupelo, an indie fa
vorite, and brought its first record critical ac
claim. Farrar fuses his own lyrical vision with
musical inspiration drawn from "John Wesley
Harding"-era Dylan, "Everybody Knows This
Is Nowhere" Neil Young and early The Band
records. The result is an album rooted in
Americana, with lyrics and music drawing
from folk, country, blues and rock.
Instrumentally, "Straightaways" features
the standard roots-rock ingredients: acoustic
and electric guitars, bass, drums and pedal
steel, with garnishes of organ, banjo, harmon
ica, fiddle and mandolin. The album opens
with the breathless, grinding, guitar-driven
rush of "Caryatid Easy" and then works
through a variety of styles and tempos, from
the folk-country shuttle of "Creosote" to the
driving rock of "Cemetery Savior" and the fu
neral drum dirge of "Been Set Free."
The most important instrument on this
album, though, is Farrar's voice. Its consistent
ly mixed up front and is clearly meant to be the
centerpoint of the album. Luckily Farrar makes
up in delivery what he lacks in range. His rich,
resonant baritone brings life to his lyrics and
twists the melodies in unexpected ways.

The album ultimately succeeds or fails on
the strength of Farrar'ssongwriting. "Straight
aways" is a song cycle. The homespun lyrics re
flect themes of dissatisfaction and restless
searching, of transition and traveling without
arriving, of change and remembrance, decay
and death. The characters seem reconciled to a
life beyond their control.
In "Left a Slide," the slow, inevitable death of
a relationship is reflected on, while in"Been Set
Free," it's the murder of a lover told from the
point of view of the deceased. Even the upbeat
songs have an undercurrent of melancholy;
"Cemetery Savior" is one of the more uplifting

tunes. The final song, "Way
Down Watson," brings many of
these themes together. Here a
wrecking-hall operator reflects
on his joh, destroying homes that
sheltered people from a cold
world, and on all the memories,
dreams and hopes that are de
stroyed with them. "No feel-good
scenes to bring it back," Farrar
sings, "just tailing brick and bro
ken glass." The song ends with,
"Feel the heartstrings sinking fast
/ another treasure found another
tumbling down."

From the high-energy opener of "Caryatid
Easy," the album gradually runs down like an
old tin toy that needs to be wound, closing with
the slow, finger-picked "Way Down Watson."
It's the sound of a man taking stock of his life
and cataloging his defeats, failures and losses.
It's someone trying to come to terms with the
present and to live with the knowledge that you
never really learn from your mistakes and that
life never really gets any easier. While the ma
ture, dark themes may not be to everyone's
taste, fans of Farrar's previous work and roots
rock in general will likely be pleased.
