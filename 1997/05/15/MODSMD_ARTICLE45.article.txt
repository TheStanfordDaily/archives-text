## "lula divinia" 
### 
While early '90s bands Jawbox and
Sunny Day Real Estate made little im
pact on mainstream rock 'n' roll, their
sound — a poetic, musically sophisti
cated blend of punk and guitar rock —
inspired a whole movement of new
bands across the Midwest and East
Coast. Kansas City, Mo.-based Shiner
is one of these new bands, and on "luia
divinia," it demonstrates both its debt
to its predecessors and its own inno
vation.
There's much on "lula divinia"
that can be traced to Jawbox and
Sunny Day Real Estate: They share a
gift for personal, poetic lyrics and a
predilection for sudden shifts from
complex, quiet guitar work to aggres
sive, fuzzy distortion. Like its influ
ences, Shiner writes songs that are
much longer and much more com
plex than the typical punk number.
Rolling, sophisticated basslines and
mid-tempo, cymbal-heavy drum
ming further demonstrate Shiner's
ties to this movement.
In many other ways, however, it as
sert its stylistic independence. Sunny
Day's songs were melodic and heavily
pop-influenced, but Shiner favors a
more dissonant sound, using bursts of
heavy, atonal guitar noise to accentu
ate guitarist Allen Epley's introspec
tive vocals.
Epley's singing style is another as
pect of Shiner's sound that sets it
apart: While most bands in this genre
seem to favor singers who alternate
between wistful, wobbly poetry and
high-pitched shrieking, Epley's voice
is broader and more mature, at times
suggesting a Chris Cornell-like range
and style.
Indeed, Shiner often seems to be
aiming at a bigger, more "rock 'n' roll"
sound than its peers. Much of "lula di
vinia" overlaps with the sort of com
mercial "hardcore" that's currently in
vogue. Bands like the Deftones and
Korn make use of the same kind of
syncopated dissonance that Shiner re
lies on so heavily.
Shiner's music is far more complex
and ambitious than either of those
bands', but it still fails to really catch
fire. "Lula divinia" is a fine piece of
work and can certainly be appreciated
as a display of guitar virtuosity and
creative songwriting, but it lacks
something in emotional intensity. Yet
the band aptly demonstrates its talent
and potential — with a bit more pol
ish, look for Shiner to make quite a
splash.
