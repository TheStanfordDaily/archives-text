For a brief period in the mid-19605, The
Byrds created a wonderful blend of folk, pop
and psychedelia. Their signature sound was a
combination of interesting harmony vocals,
melodic songwriting and chiming 12-string
guitar. At their height they played with Bob
Dylan, dropped acid with the Beatles and cre
ated music that was and is very influential.
These newly reissued CDs, first released in
1968 and 1969, document the decline and fall
of this catalytic group.
"The Notorious Byrd Brothers" is an exper
imental and largely successful album. By 1967
the group had three unique and talented song
writers in Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman and
David Crosby. "Artificial Energy" drives along
like a freight train, "Change Is Now" is full of

tuneful mysticism, "Draft Morning" is a
poignant anti-war song, and "Get to You" is a
delicate, first-rate love song. The band makes
liberal use of studio effects such as phasing,
cross-fading, stereo panning and Moog syn
thesizer and the whole affair is awash in post
"Sgt. Pepper" trippyness.
However, while recording this album, gui
tarist and songwriter Crosby left the band, and
just after the sessions were completed drum
mer Michael Clarke quit. To replace Crosby,
McGuinn and Hillman recruited the young
Gram Parsons. Parsons quickly took over and
the band released "Sweetheart of the Rodeo,"
after which he left, taking Hillman with him.
This left McGuinn as the only surviving
Byrd. If wiser council had prevailed, he would

have retired the name and gone off as a solo act.
Unfortunately, he threw together some crack
session players, and The Byrds soldiered on.
This is not to say that the remainder of The
Byrds' releases are worthless; they simply pale
in comparison to the original group's work.
I'he first release of the McGuinn-dominated
lineup, "Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde" has some
strong material, such as "Drug Store Truck
Drivin' Man," "Your Gentle Way of Loving
Me" and even a catchy song about a dog, "Old
Blue." However, McGuinn only wrote or co
wrote half the songs on the album, and one is a
leftover from Parson's tenure in the group. It
was a harbinger of things to come.
The group's next album, "Ballad of Easy
Rider," starts promisingly with the beautiful

title song, a collaboration between McGuinn
and Dylan. But things go rapidly downhill be
cause "Ballad of Easy Rider" is the only song
McGuinn had a hand in writing. There is much
wrong with this album: the drum solo, the
cover of "Jesus Is Just Alright," another song
about a dog, the English sea shanty and liner
notes from Peter Fonda.
Ihe Byrds continued releasing albums
through but after McGuinn was left
alone at the helm, il was an exercise in the law
of diminishing returns. Their first five albums
are essential listening, but the post-"Sweet
heart" releases are only for dedicated Byrdma
niax and those with a deep interest in the his
tory of country rock.
