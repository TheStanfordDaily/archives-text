# Calobo
## "Stomp" 
### 
Calobo's new album, "Stomp," may not
overwhelm you in one sitting, but it definite
ly grows on you like a familiar Cowell Cluster
fungus. Listen to it once and you may be able
to escape, but proceed with caution after
multiple screenings because you will soon
find yourself sucked into Calobo's grooving
folk-rock sound.
Straight from Pordand, Ore., this eclectic
seven-member band boasts one of the most
talented, diverse styles on the West Coast.
What do you get when you combine a classi
cally trained pianist, a vocalist with opera ex
perience, three guitarists with specialties in
bluegrass, early '70s rock and jazz, respective
ly, and two more musicians for good mea
sure? A euphonic musical stew called Calobo.
"Stomp" has been touted by critics as evi
dence of the band's newfound maturity,
whatever that means. I would substitute
"mellowness" for "maturity." I expected a
lively, foot-tappin' record in the same vein as
the band's last three albums, "Calobo," "Ya

Dum Di Dum" and "Runnin' in the River,"
but "Stomp" threw me for a loop with its
slower beats and soul-searching lyrics. The
gentle three-part harmonies of David An
drews, Caleb Klauder and Michelle Van Cleef
complement this chill mood in songs like
"Stitched in Wool."
1 would even venture melancholy as a
defining adjective for this album. I'm guess
ing a bad breakup may be behind Calobo's
latest release. Rut don't worry, you'll find no
Morrissette-esque venom in the music, only
a bittersweet philosophical pondering as in
"Could've Been." Maybe "Swoon" would
have been a better album title.
Fortunately, strands of classic Calobo still
weave throughout the album and are appar
ent in those songs that inspire you to leave
your chair and dance. Bluesy "Down in My
Old House" definitely satisfies this condition.
The band does seem more at ease and in tune
with each other (is this maturity?) which al
lows more solos and experimentation. Jenny

Conlee goes crazy on the piano in "Bright
Day"and "For Avalon" showcases Kenneth
Erlick on the electric guitar.
It's easy to see why Calobo has amassed a
cult following akin to groups like Phish and
the Grateful Dead. Groove as an art form is
rarely better exhibited then when David,

Brian, Jenny, Kenneth, Caleb, Nate and
Michele get it on. "Stomp" features their laid
back side, but to get .1 glimpse ol the raucous
inspiring sound that made them famous, find
a live show and watch (;alobo in its element.
