# Mark Eitzel
## "West" 
### 
If there were a Grammy category for most
underappreciated artist, singer / songwriter
Mark Eitzel would be nominated every year.
Given his luck so far, however, he'd probably
never win. For nearly 10 years, Eitzel fronted
American Music Club, a San Francisco-based
combo whose moody, brilliant anthems of loss
and depression were just as critically acclaimed
as they were commercially ignored.
"60 Watt Silver Lining," Eitzel's 1996 jazzy
solo debut, fell even flatter. Despite a rich, pow
erful voice, a gift for witty, poignant lyrics and a
Who's Who of influential critics singing his

praises, Eitzel seemed unlikely to reach beyond
his tiny core audience of religiously devoted fans
"West," however, may finally mark a turn
around. While it's promoted as another Eitzel
solo album, nearly all the material here is co
written with R.E.M. guitar virtuoso Peter Buck
and backed up by Tuatara, a talented group led
by Buck including members of Luna and
Screaming Trees. Powered by Buck's name
recognition alone, "West" should reach more
music fans than any previous Eitzel vehicle. It's
a pity, then, that the record that marks Eitzel's
commercial breakthrough isn't quite up to par
with his previous efforts.
Don't get me wrong — "West" is a brilliant
record, far superior to nine-tenths of what's out
there. Songs like "Three Inches of Wall," "Heli
um" and"In Your Life" showcase Eitzel at his
lyrical best, at once witty, fatalistic and sad.
Buck and his band are undoubtedly talented
musicians, and on the best tracks they support

Eitzel's words with a complex, textured sound
that was absent in his previous outings. The
Eitzel-authored "Live or Die," perhaps the
album's best track, demonstrates this well.
At times, though, the music overwhelms
Eitzel's singing and pushes it into the back
ground. And Buck's songwriting can be too
friendly and pop-oriented, incorporating un
pleasantly precious organ and piano parts that
make some tracks sound uncomfortably simi
lar to the Gounting Crows or other adult-alter
native radio fodder.
While these songs may be more "mature"
and technically sophisticated than Eitzel's pre
vious work, they miss some of the raw emo
tional immediacy that made American Music
Club so brilliant. It's ironic that after such a long
sojourn in obscurity, Mark Eitzel may finally
find stardom with material that, while brilliant,
pales in comparison to his earlier works.
