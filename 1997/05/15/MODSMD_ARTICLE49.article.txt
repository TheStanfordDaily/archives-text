## The
						Fifth Element 
### 
In the wake of the re-rcleased "Star Wars"
films, "The Fifth Element" is acclaimed
French director Luc Besson's answer to the
moviegoer's plea for fresh science fiction.
Following his success in films such as "La
Femme Nikita" and"The Professional,"
Besson has brought together a grander vi
sion for blockbuster-film audicnces.
Now I'm sure you're asking what exactly is
the fifth element? Well, we all know the four
elements of Greek mythology: earth, water,
wind and fire. As the film reveals, together
they sustain a fifth element, life (no surprise
for those who read Plato).
The movie takes place in the year 2259,
when a big fireball of pure evil is threatening
our part of the galaxy. The fifth clement is
the key to a weapon that will save our
species.
Supermodel / singer / actress Milla
Jovovich plays Leeloo, a manifestation of the
fifth element who is literally the perfect
woman. In order to make the space-weapon
work, she needs someone to retrieve stone
relics that represent the other four elements.
That's where our hero, Korben Dallas (Bruce
Willis), comes in. He's a cab driver and for
mer police specialist whose run-ins with
Leeloo are more than coincidental.
Meanwhile, a number of evil forces are

also after the stones,
including a power
ful weapons-manu
facturer named
Zorg (Gary Old
man). And, as no
movie can exist
without comic re
lief, Dallas' sidekick
is DJ Ruby Rhod
(Chris Tucker), a
loud, cross-dressing
example of a futuris
tic celebrity.
Countless special
effects blended with
Besson's masterful
direction create an
impressive picture
of a future world.
Add the hyperactive
French style of edit-

ing, and your eyes will be glued to the screen.
Unfortunately, the visual treat of "The
Fifth Element" is detracted by a badly con
structed plot. There are a couple of holes in
the story, ranging from the campy to the an
noying, such as Leeloo's inability to speak
proper English despite her massive intelli
gence.

The rest of the storyline suffers from a
lack of originality. The movie begins in 20th
century Egypt, reminiscent of "Stargate."
Some of the fight scenes would be more ap
propriate in a Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers flick. Even Dallas' normal-Joe
turned-hero situation has parallels with
Willis' "Die Hard" movies.

Overall, "The Fifth Element" is an enter
taining film that is worth seeing on the big
screen. However, the writing could have
used some patching up without compromis
ing the plot. It's the typical case of all special
effects and no story, but this time we can
blame it on the French.

A platinum-blond Bruce Willis is clearly not in his element.
