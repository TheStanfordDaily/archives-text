"Alla.hu Akbar! Ash-hadu an la la ilaha il
lallah," a male voice called out, summoning
Muslims to Friday prayers as many have done
before him. However, this time the voice
echoed the phrase in White Plaza. Translated
from Arabic, the phrase means "God is great
est, and there is no God but God."
As a closure to Islamic Awareness Week in

April, a group of Muslim students gathered to
pray in congregation in White Plaza.
The week is just one many this year that fea
tured Islamic activities. The Stanford Islamic
Society has existed since the 19505. This soci
ety has always held juma, or Friday prayers, as
well as late evening meals together during Ra
madan, the month of fasting.
There has been a greater Islamic presence
this year, through activities new to campus,

such as speakers and Islamic art presentations.
Senior Kirsten Ixjreen said there has been
an effort by the Islamic Society to reach out of
the community and attempt to educate Stan
ford about Islam, she said. The society has
about 60 members.
She said the increased diversity in campus
Muslims enables them to reach out to a larger
audience. With an increased Muslim popula
tion, Muslim students have attempted to step
beyond their community and provide Stanford
with information and activities about Islam.
One upcoming event is this Friday, Dr.
Hurad Hoffman, former German ambassador
to Algeria and Morocco and a convert to Islam,
will be speaking at Bechtel International ('en
ter at 9 a.m.
Senior Imran Maskatia, president of the
Stanford Islamic Society, is leading a group of
students attempting to increase the number of
courses offered about Islam.
English Prof. Albert Camarillo, director of
the new Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program said the program does not in
clude Islam in its curriculum. The reasoning
behind this decision is that Islam is neither an
ethnicity nor a race, Camarillo said.
Many non-Muslim students may have no
ticed that halal meat is now served in several
campus dormitories, said Maskatia. This typo
of meat is killed in the name of God and in the
most efficient and painless way possible.
The Housing and Dining Services agree
ment to serve halal meat allows Muslims to
keep the eating restrictions as stipulated by
Islam, Maskatia said.
Maskatia noted that willingness of Dining
Services to accommodate Muslim students in-

the world's fastest growing reli

population is Muslim, t he Univer

this religion, Beinin said.
"The only way to get more
courses on Islam is for the Univer
