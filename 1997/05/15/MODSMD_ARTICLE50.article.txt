# Children of the Revolution
## 
### 
For his feature film debut, di
rector Peter Duncan had the good
fortune to work with three of the
most exportable and highly re
garded Australian actors of the
past decade: Judy Davis, Sam Neill
and Geoffrey Rush.
Rush is now famous for his
Oscar-winning role in "Shine,"
Neill is best known in this country
for "Jurassic Park," and Davis'
most recent roles have been as
Americans in (Hint Eastwood's
"Absolute Power" and "Blood and
Wine" with Jack Nicholson. "Chil
dren of the Revolution" finally
finds these three actors on home
territory, and it is when their char
acters are the focus that this black
comedy about Communism down
under works.
Davis plays loan Fraser, a
staunch Communist Party sup-

porter in 1949 Australia. A more faithful
devotee to Joan than the cause is gentle,
lovelorn Zachary Welch (Rush). Because of
her fan letters, loan is invited to Moscow to
meet Stalin, shadowed along the way by se
cret agent David Hoyle (Neill). Joan sleeps
with Stalin (F. Murray Abraham), inadver
tently kills him and comes home pregnant.

Joan marries Welch, and years pass swiftly in
a series of snapshots as Joe Jr. is raised as
Welch's son.
As a young man, Joe (Richard Roxburgh)
falls in love with a police officer (Rachel Grif
fiths) and embarks on a political career at
odds with his mother's ideology. Hoyle
shows up again to briefly contest Joe's pater

nity, but the question is settled once Joe starts
sporting a mustache and a dark shock of hair.
And as Joe starts turning mean and sour just
like his namesake, so does the film.
The film definitely identifies itself in the
beginning as a satire. It uses the framework of
a documentary, intercutting scenes from the
past with present-day interviews with the
aging characters. The scenes in Moscow have
a cartoonish quality complete with Beria,
Khruschev and Malenkov as the Three
Stooges. Stalin is less of a character than a
caricature, down to his clumsy date with
Joan. Later in the film, one of the funniest
scenes is an elderly Joan railing at the tele
vised meeting between Reagan and Gor
bachev. Tottering, white-haired but still
every inch a believer, she denounces Gorby as
Ronald McDonald in disguise, predicting
that he'll bring hamburgers to the Red
Square.
But aside from Joan's outrage over the col
lapse of Communism, the second half of the
film with Joe as an adult doesn't have any
where humorous or particularly meaningful
to go. The gimmick of this film, as the
"Where's your mustache?" milk-advertise
ment-spoof suggests, is that an ordinary
woman from another part of the world can
hook up with Stalin through her love for the
cause and carry the child of the Party.
Davis is really what gives this film's satire
its bite. With her vinegary mouth and scorn

ful eyes, she makes Joan so compelling that it
is understandable why Welch stays by her
side. Regrettably, the rest of the film doesn't
stay on her level of fire and wit.
