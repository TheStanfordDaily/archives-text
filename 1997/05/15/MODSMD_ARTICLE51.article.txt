# Love! Valour! Compassion!
## 
### 
Although a title with three exclamation points in it could
seem conceitedly over-hyped, "Love! Valour! Compassion!" is
certainly not. As a Broadway play it garnered Tony Awards for
best play and best actor. As a film, it is simply amazing.
The screenplay, written by Terrence McNally, is a richly
packed narrative of the relationships among eight gay men on
holiday. And although you wouldn't notice it, nothing much
actually happens. But this lack of activity is no artsy attempt to
pluck meaning out of thin air, like digging an epiphany out of
one's navel lint — a lot happens, only within the characters
themselves.
The key term here is character-driven: The story revolves
around these men who are brought together under one roof
during three weekends. Some are intimately involved with each
other; some share only the common ground of their sexual ori
entation. The diversity inspires wonderful situations and
harkens back to that certain voyeuristic pleasure of seeing per
sonal differences alternatively clash and come to an under
standing — MTV's "Real World" but much better.
Gregory (Stephen Bogardus), an aging dancer, is the meek
host who op<:ns up his sprawling country house to his friends
during vacations. Bobby (Justin Kirk), his blind lover, is young
and naive. Brit John (John Glover) is an unlikeable curmud-

geon who worsens in the company of his
popular twin, James (also Glover), who
is suffering from AIDS. Ramon (Randy
Becker), a petulant Latino with a perfect
body, is John's latest lover. Ferry and
Arthur (Stephen Spinella and John Ben
jamin Hickey) are the most convention
al of them all; they work in corporate
America and have lived together for an
impressive 14 years. Buzz (Jason Alexan
der) is an opinionated musical aficiona
do in denial of being HIV-positive.
With the exception of Alexander, who
lends the perfect comic touch, McNally
and director Joe Mantello used the origi
nal theater cast. Their decision was a

good one. The actors fully inhabit their roles, using the sub
tleties of body language and the intangibles of great acting to
convey their characters' many dimensions.
Not forgetting to give credit where it is due, the situations
and conversations these men find themselves in are strokes of
written genius by McNally; banal in topic but brimming with
new insight on the inexhaustible topics of love, commitment,

weakness and friendship.
It is this wonderful meld of writing and acting, with the
added bonus of pastoral splendor, that makes "Love! Valour!
Compassion!" an experience not to be missed. By the film's end,
chances arc you will feel as passionately about love, valor and
compassion as the characters do.
