# Father's Day
## 
### 
Director Ivan Reitman plunges us into "Father's Day" by in
troducing us to Jack Lawrence (Billy Crystal) and Dale Putley
(Robin Williams) in completely dissimilar positions. The catch
is that either one might be the father of Scott (Charlie
Hofheimer), or so says Colleen (a dreary Nastassja Kinski),
Scott's mother.
Colleen is an ex-girlfriend of both Jack and Dale, and she
entreats them separately to travel to Sacramento to find Scott,
who has apparently run off with the modern rock band Sugar
Ray. An especially comical moment comes when the two men
belatedly realize that they are looking for the same child. Com
plications occur when Scott is reluctant to return home with
out his girlfriend.
Jack's wife, Carrie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus of "Seinfeld"),
shows genuine concern for her husband and demands an ex
planation for his disappearance. She gets one, though it comes
during a ironic and funny situation in a Reno casino.
Oh, that's right, the band continues on its West Coast tour
to Reno, and Scott follows faithfully. Unfortunately, Scott
seems to have stolen money from drug dealers and spent it on

an expensive diamond necklace for his beloved. There always
seems to he the need for a compelling and tension-huilding
side-story in a non-action movie, so we have two hitmen trail
ing Scott.

This movie was originally a
French picture called "l.es Com
pores." The idea, itself, is not ten i
bly original — "Jungle 2 Jungle,"
the story of a New York (iity busi
nessman who discovers that he
has a long-lost son living in South
America, is remotely similar to
the premise in "father's Day."
Though Reitman has made a
movie th.it is far from perfect, I
can assert that "Father's Day"
does have two redeeming factors:
its two stars. I appreciate the dif
forent techniques that comedians
Williams and Crystal utilize. "Fa-

ther's Day" is the first time they both appeared in the same
movie; let's hope that the trend continues with funnier and
better films.
