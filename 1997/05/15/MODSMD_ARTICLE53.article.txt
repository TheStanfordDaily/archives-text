## THE
						GODFATHER REVISITED 
### 
I must confess that this week was the first time I
have seen "The Godfather." That goes for the sec
ond and third installments of this landmark trilogy
by Francis Ford Coppola as well. I am honestly
amazed at the trilogy's level of excellence. This col
umn arrives in the midst of the re-release of "The

Godfather" in honor of its 25th anniversary.
"The Godfather" (1972) introduces the Corleone
family during the Truman years in New York. Mar
lon Brando, who won an Oscar for his hoarse
voiced portrayal of an aging Don Vito Corleone,
portrays a character who extols old-fashioned con
cepts like loyalty and patriarchy. Fast-rising
Michael (a very youthful Al Facino) eventually
takes his father's position as the godfather of one of
the top five crime families in New York. Michael's
stabilizing force is Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), one

of the few characters who exhibit any morality or lawful
ness. Keaton's subtle and expressive acting reveals her
conflicting love for Michael and hatred for his work. Just
as bald and compelling as ever, Robert Duvall adds to the
star-studded cast as Michael's loyal adopted brother, Tom
Hagen. James Caan rounds out the players as Sonny, a
cocky and hot-headed gangster bent on revenge.
Il is no surprise that "The Godfather" was named best
picture of that year. The epic scope of the rise and near fall

of the Corleone family overwhelmed me. The beautiful
vistas of Sicily and the urban setting of New York captured
a booming era for business and crime. Kudos to Coppola
for having the visionary sense to transform Mario Puzo's
first novel into a theatrical movie. A deft metaphor he
uses is the puppet shown during the title sequence; the

Godfather pulls all the
strings, but he never is di
rectly connected with any of
the family's actions.
"The Godfather, Part II,"

which won the Academy Award for best
picture in 1974, has the task of juxtapos
ing two separate stories. One follows the
rise of Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) at
the turn of the 20th century; the other
shows Michael Corleone (Pacino) in ac
tion during the Eisenhower era when
business has expanded into Las Vegas.
DeNiro picked up the Academy Award
for supporting actor, but both he and Pa
cino superbly add depth to the gangster
character.
The final chapter of Coppola's trilogy,
"The Godfather, Part III," was released
in 1990 to culminate Michael Corleone's
power over the family's legitimate deal
ings of the '70s and '80s. This time, Vin
cent Mancini (Andy Garcia), the brash
son of Sonny, is the new infusion of
youth — and possibly future Don — for

the Corleones. Unfortunately, this movie lacks the inten
sity and magic of the first two episodes. Its betrayals and
business deals remain, but it is the most disappointing of
the three movies.
For all who are interested in an epilogue to this trilogy,
Mario Puzo's "The Last Don" was shown on television last
Tuesday. I doubt that 1 will want to taint the fond memo
ries that I have from the recent viewing of Coppola's mas
terpieces. This is a highly recommended trilogy for those
of you who have a few hours to spare.

The original mobsters of "The Godfather" hold up well after 25 years.
