"No dough for you!"
"Seinfeld" co-stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus
(Elaine), Michael Richards (Kramer) and
(ason Alexander (George) waited patiently,
hoping to get the $850,000 pay increase
they had demanded from NBC. But on
Monday, the network proved to be almost
as stingy with its money as the soup Nazi
with his mulligatawny.
Louis-Dreyfus, Richards and Alexander
weren't asking for $1 million an episode
out of sheer greed, but to prove a point:
that they deserve more ... credit. And they
do;

"Seinfeld" generates more than $300
million each year, and many people have
made a fortune off of the series, including
the people at Castle Rock Entertainment,
the show's production company.
Each member of the supporting cast
earns only $150,000 per episode, however,
and NBC offered to double that figure for
the show's ninth season. Even though
$300,000 is a ludicrous amount of money
for anyone to make for roughly half an hour
of work, it is a drop in the bucket when
compared with the amount the series gen
erates and the popularity it has gained for

the network.
After all, the actors are the ones who
make "Seinfeld" such an overwhelming
success. They're the characters we all love
and the reason the show is ranked second in
the nation for most-watched series this
year, behind only "ER." Jerry (who already
agreed to his own deal for $1 million an
episode) and his co-stars are the reason
everyone else is becoming so wealthy.
So why shouldn't the trio be paid more?
More than $300,000 that is. One million
dollars is taking it too far. Not because it
would be too much for NBC to fork over

hut because it would set a precedent for
other sitcoms, making them highly expen
sive to produce. That kind of precedent
could force some shows off the air, depriv
ing viewers of their favorite series. What
would Stanford students do without
"Must-See TV?"
The network proposed to pay the actors
a generous sum of $800,000, and Louis-
Dreyfus, Richards and Alexander agreed.
So it looks like the cast of the "show about
nothing" will return for another 22
episodes and at a whopping but fair $17.6
million.
