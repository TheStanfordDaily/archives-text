# Student group educates about Arab issues

### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
The Organization for Arab Americans in
Stanford, started in the late 1980s, re-emerged
last year after being dormant during the (»ulf
War. However, the group has been plagued by
discrimination.
OASIS "died with the Gulf War," said doc
toral student Nabeel Ibrahim, president of the
group.
"People were afraid to admit their Arab her
itage. I think, to a certain extent, that still ex
ists," he added.
Alleged hate crimes and racial slurs have
not helped, Ibrahim said. One such incident al
legedly occurred during Admit Weekend when

the group had set up a table in White Plaza for
the Activities Fair.
"An older woman walked up to the table,
spat at us and walked away," Ihrahim said.
Some people have told Ibrahim that he is
overreacting, but he disagrees. He said he has
been disappointed that this incident has not
been included in the recent stand against aim
pus hate crimes.
"To me, this is as bad as the anti-gay graffi
ti and the desecration of the (Clothesline Pro
ject) T-shirts," he said. "Maybe these recent
hate crimes were good in that they are getting
people to talk about these things."
Ibrahim noted that the anti-Arab attitudes
were much worse during the Gulf War when
Arabs faced physical attacks because of their

heritage.
"A lot of Arab.s were attacked . . were as
saulted," Ibrahim said. "A lot of mosques were
burned down. It's a safe b«>t to say that had
OA,SIS remained active, there would have been
serious repercussions for its members."
"It was just this entire period where you'd
walk into a room, and everyone would turn
around," said sophomore Mnlinda Fannoun,
OASIS treasurer.
Ibrahim said the anti-Arab comments were
also more noticeable after the Oklahoma City
bombing, when tin? bombers were initially
thought to bo of Arab descent.
"It's not a problem that's passed," Ibrahim
:iid. "It's a problem that's still
round. For the undergraduates,
u i »st of them hear it in class and in
heir dormitories."
Fannoun said she heard a nega
tivr comment a student made in
. r hioethics class that wasdirect
"(l toward Palestinians.
"A lot of times, people really
don't r< ali/e what they're saying,"
Ik lid Its politically correct to
It iK> people hut not political
ri. t to label others. The
i principles should be applied
>' ro: s the entire range."
|) i ahim said he blames a lot of
! i on t lie double standards that
he media holds.
A lot of it is the result of media
.rtraval:; of Arabs as being vio
;11. a: being terrorists, as being
illnt toward women," he said.
Rn cut movies perpetuating
• • negative Arab stereotype,
l a ahim said, include "Father of
hf Mride, Part II," "True Lies,"
Maddin" and "Navy Seals."
In "Aladdin," Ibrahim said, all
112 the evil characters speak with
m accent, have darker skin and
how more Arab features.
"It's very disappointing to see
tlii stereotype that all Arabs are
violent and irrational," Ibrahim
aid "We don't assume that all
Americans are mass murderers
ju t because a few are. We
houldn't assume that all Arabs
are terrorists."

Fannoun recalled what she
thought when she first stepped on
to campus her freshman year.
"Wow — I'm coming to this
vast multicultural pool of people,"
Fannoun said. "You get here, and
you're awakened."
Ibrahim echoed these
thoughts. "I always hoped it
wouldn't be as bad at Stanford,"
he said. "I think it's just as bad."
One of the primary goals of
OASIS is to educate Stanford
about the Arab culture and poli
tics. However, Nabeel said, many
students still hold misconceptions
about Arabs, particularly in terms
of religion.
Ibrahim said a common mis
conception people have is that "all
Muslim" are Arabs and all Arabs
are Muslims. That's just not
_ »>
true.
He pointed out that there are
Christian and Jewish Arabs in ad
dition to the Muslim ones.
According to senior Imran
Maskatia, who is not a member of
OASIS, only 18 percent of Mus
lims worldwide are Arabs. Maska
tia is currently working to bring a
professor to Stanford whose ex
pertise is in Islamic studies.
The group plans to have an in
formational table at the Interna
tional Festival at Bechtel Interna
tional Center on Saturday. It will
also be hosting Rashid Khalidi,
the director of the Center for In
ternational Studies at the Univer
sity of Chicago, who will speak on
"Jerusalem and the Peace
Process" May 20 at 7 p.m. in the
center's assembly room.
