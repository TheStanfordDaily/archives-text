The Organization for Arab Americans in
Stanford, started in the late 1980s, re-emerged
last year after being dormant during the (»ulf
War. However, the group has been plagued by
discrimination.
OASIS "died with the Gulf War," said doc
toral student Nabeel Ibrahim, president of the
group.
"People were afraid to admit their Arab her
itage. I think, to a certain extent, that still ex
ists," he added.
Alleged hate crimes and racial slurs have
not helped, Ibrahim said. One such incident al
legedly occurred during Admit Weekend when

the group had set up a table in White Plaza for
the Activities Fair.
"An older woman walked up to the table,
spat at us and walked away," Ihrahim said.
Some people have told Ibrahim that he is
overreacting, but he disagrees. He said he has
been disappointed that this incident has not
been included in the recent stand against aim
pus hate crimes.
"To me, this is as bad as the anti-gay graffi
ti and the desecration of the (Clothesline Pro
ject) T-shirts," he said. "Maybe these recent
hate crimes were good in that they are getting
people to talk about these things."
Ibrahim noted that the anti-Arab attitudes
were much worse during the Gulf War when
Arabs faced physical attacks because of their

heritage.
"A lot of Arab.s were attacked . . were as
saulted," Ibrahim said. "A lot of mosques were
burned down. It's a safe b«>t to say that had
OA,SIS remained active, there would have been
serious repercussions for its members."
"It was just this entire period where you'd
walk into a room, and everyone would turn
around," said sophomore Mnlinda Fannoun,
OASIS treasurer.
Ibrahim said the anti-Arab comments were
also more noticeable after the Oklahoma City
bombing, when tin? bombers were initially
thought to bo of Arab descent.
"It's not a problem that's passed," Ibrahim
