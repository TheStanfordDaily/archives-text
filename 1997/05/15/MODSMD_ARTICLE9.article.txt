# Community farm offers hands-on education

A little more than two months since its in
ception winter quarter, the Stanford Commu
nity Farm is thriving.
The farm was founded by senior Brian Hal
weil and lies on a two-acre plot of land right
next to the Environmental Health and Safety
facility just east of Sand Hill Road.
"The main goal of the farm is to recognize
the need for practical, hands-on experi
ence. . . . People here learn by doing," Halweil
said.
Almost everybody who works at the farm
has had a positive reaction. Freshman Justin
Nixon said, " I plan on joining the Peace Corps
after I graduate, and is a wonderful way to
learn valuable, hands-on knowledge about
planting and growing."
The field where the farm is located used to
be entirely filled with grasses and weeds that
could survive in the clay-like soil of the field.
This is now being transformed into fertile soil
through the efforts of the people who work at
the farm, Halweil said.
The focus of the first several seasons of the
farm is to make the soil fertile. Halweil point
ed out that the natural soil of the field was dry
and nutrient-poor.
Halweil said many of the plants currently
planted at the farm are crops that put nutri
ents and carbon and nitrogen into the soil,
such as corn and beans.

They serve the dual purpose of also provid
ing a small harvest in addition to enriching the
soil. Fuji apple trees, citrus fruit trees, figs,
radishes and onions also dot the farm land
scape, he explained.
Halweil said, "This is really an exercise in
sustainability." He hopes the farm will even
tually become completely self-reliant and be
able to supply itself with all the necessary com
post and nutrients. He characterized the farm
as a "low-expense project" and said it received
$600 from the ASSU last quarter.
The Earth Systems program also offers a
course this quarter called Earth Systems 99X
"Sustainable food production," which has
about 35 students. The course is taught at the
farm, where students learn the basics of farm
ing and log at least three hours each week
working at the farm for one credit in the class.
"I am super-impressed by the people's en
thusiasm," Halweil said. When spring quarter
started, he added, many people dropped by to
do work that was not initially rewarding;
preparatory work involves digging and grind
ing.
He also said about 25 of the people who
worked at the farm were either freshmen or
sophomores. He hopes their sustained interest
would help the farm flourish in the future.
During the summer, when many of the stu
dents leave, the homeless and other people
from the Urban Ministry in Palo Alto will be
able to work on the farm.
Halweil said California weather is ideal for

growing crops in all seasons. During the sum
mer months, there is an abundance of people
who want to work, but have no place to go. He
hopes that the farm will give these people a
place to work.
Junior Amanda Lowrey, an earth systems
major, said, "The farm is an awesome break
from mental crunching. I go there just to hit
the dirt — literally — digging beds. I enjoy let
ting my mind wander while I get to know the
names of the trees and vegetables."
Freshman Audrey Diehl agreed. "Every
time I go out there to work there have been
drastic improvements in the site," she said,
"and new plants have been placed in the well
dug soil. Maintaining the farm is hard work,
but it's also fun and very rewarding."
The farm is a decentralized operation, Hal
weil said. There is no rigid command struc
ture, and there are plots in the farm reserved
for individual use — faculty and staff or other
citizens may plant what they wish and con
duct their own experiments in the reserved
plot.
There are, however, 14 water managers —
two for each day of the week — who come and
make sure that the plants receive water early
in the morning and late at night to minimize
evaporation and the waste of water.
For the present, the farm does not fill up the
entire two acres of land, and there is room to
grow. "Who knows?" Halweil said. "Perhaps
in 20 or 30 years the farm will be a beautiful or
chard."
