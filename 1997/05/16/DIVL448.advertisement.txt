THE PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE ALCOHOL POLICY TASK FORCE
Please send comments to Vice Provost Edmonds by May 27
2.7 Implications for policy setting
The University's Alcohol Policy is part of the normative environment in which drinking occurs and,
as such, the content of the Policy should be designed so as to promote attitudes and behaviors that
serve to prevent alcohol-related problems. The Policy should reflect current thinking about the causes
and effects of alcohol use, and about the effectiveness of various prevention strategies. Some elements
of current thinking are that, to effectively prevent alcohol-related problems, (a) the community should
be fully informed about, e.g. the effects of substance use, the norms of acceptable conduct, privacy
issues, the sanctions associated with violations of the Policy, and legal liability, (b) education should
be supplemented by behavioral interventions, (c) prevention programs should target high-risk
subgroups, as well as the general population of light or moderate users, and (d) penalties for infractions
of the Policy should be swift, certain, and calibrated against the seriousness of the infraction. Also, the
Policy should be consistent with other parts of the normative environment, such as, the various laws
pertaining to alcohol, the University's Fundamental Standard, and the community's norms of
"acceptable" conduct. Further, and perhaps most importantly, the Stanford community, as a whole,
should provide guidance for improvement, and the community should be willing to support it.(The
current Policy is given in an Appendix.)
3.0 Draft Policy Statement
ATI proposes the following text.
The goal of this Policy is the prevention of problems associated with the use of alcohol ami controlled
substances. It is the policy of the University to maintain a campus and workplace that is free of controlled
substances, including, but not limited to, marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines. The unlawful
manufai ture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful
possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace, or as part
of any of the University's activities. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Stanford premises
where ai tivities of the University are conducted. Violation of this Policy may result in disciplinary action up to
and including termination of employment or expulsion of students. Violations may also be referred to the
appropriate authorities for prosecution. Further, the University recognizes that alcohol and other drug dependency
are treatable illnesses, WHICH MAY HAVE HEHAVIORAL CONSEQUENCES. STANFORD is committed to an
organizational approach that reasonably accommodates the treatment of such illnesses WHILE NOT CREATING
UNDO HARDSHIP ON THE UNIVERSITY. The University will not discriminate against successfully treated
individuals. Phis Policy will be reviewed at least biennially.
lor comparison, the text in the current Stanford Bulletin is now given.
It is the policy of the University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or
distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the
University' activities. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Stanford premises where the
activities of the University are conducted. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and
including termination of employment or expulsion of students. Violations may also be referred to the
appropriate authorities for prosecution. This policy will be reviewed at least biennially.
8.1 Revisions to current Policy document
As result of our discussions and interviews, ATI recommends certain revisions in the document that
sets forth the University's Policy. For example, we have (a) restated the goal ot the Policy (Section 4
above), to more accurately reflect actual practice, (b) stated in greater detail the expectations concerning
individual responsibility, and the roles and responsibilities of residence statt, social hosts, university
administrators and the campus police (Sections 3 and 5), in an attempt to reduce the ambiguities
surrounding these roles, (c) restated the proscription against the use of house funds to bus alcohol, and
suggested th.it secret balloting by dorm residents may be helpful in resolving disputes over the use of
house funds (Section 3.1), in an attempt to reduce the unhappiness some students have with group
decisions involving the purchase of alcohol, and (d) updated the lists of relevant laws and counseling or
other services (Sections 6 and 7), as required by law. In addition, we have presented in Section 2
information that might be included in a Stanford course on alcohol. Whereas this information is much
more than can be included in a policy document, A I F recommends that excerpts from it, e.g., the
material in pp. 68-75 of the Resource Manual for Residence Staff, be included in the Policy document. To
summarize,
A. ATF recommends that the Policy document be revised to incorporate a precis of Section 2, and most
of the material in Sections 3-7.
8.2 Educational Programming
While there is widespread agreement that "education" is and should be at the center of the University's
prevention efforts, there is less agreement on what the content of that education should be, and on the
amount of educational programming about alcohol and other drugs that should be done, for example,
during new student orientation or during residence staff training. ATF recommends that the University:
B. Adopt the broadest possible view of "education", one that includes information about, for
example, (a) the health risks and other harm associated with substance use, (b) drinking levels,
the unacceptability of drunken behavior on campus, and other alcohol-related norms at Stanford,
(c) individual and collective responsibilities, (d) the preferred responses to alcohol-related or other
emergencies, (e) the effectiveness of various prevention strategies, and (112) the relevant laws and
University policies.
C. Within New Student Orientation (e.g., during students' first 72 hours on campus), establish a
substantial educational component dealing with alcohol, and leading to candid, residence-based
discussions.
D. Within Residence Staff training, establish a substantial component dealing with alcohol. For
example, training might include a review of procedures on (1) the use of house funds and student
collected funds—how sensitive are these procedures to the religious, ethical or other concerns of
residents; (2) health and safety—how to respond to an alcohol or other drug emergency; (3) abuse
and dependency—how to intervene and what resources are available for referral; and (4) party
planning guidelines.
F. Wherever possible, augment educational programming with guidelines for "best practices", or
desired student conduct in specific situations, for example, party planning, and with behavioral
training for high-risk subgroups, for example, heavy drinkers.
8.3 Substance-free Dormitories
F. Inasmuch as the idea of substance-free dorms is gaining adherents on college campuses, ATF
recommends that the University study the pros and cons ot introducing substance-free residences
on campus. Such a study might consider, among other issues, (a) what kind of residence students
wish to live in, or what house rules on drugs do students want, (b) how the possible dorm rules
would affect the behavior and health of dorm residents, and (c) the effect of the presence of a
substance-free dorm on substance use in other dorms, and, more generally, on the perceived norms
of substance use on campus.
8.4 Oversight Committee for Prevention Programs
Ci. Inasmuch as the University's prevention program contains many components, some of which
appear to function independently, ATF recommends that a standing committee be established to
coordinate the University's prevention efforts. This committee might be a forum where all
initiatives to prevent alcohol-related problems, as well as initiatives that increase the availability or
use of alcohol, are discussed and integrated, where gaps in the overall Alcohol Plan can be
identified, where individual cases can be discussed so as to improve the University's response to
problems, and where needed studies of trends, effectiveness of programs, etc. can be discussed or
designed. The committee might also reinforce the use of interventions that are intermediate
between a formal response (legal, disciplinary or treatment) and no response. This committee
should not be another layer in the disciplinary process.
