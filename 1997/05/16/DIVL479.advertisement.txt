fox our cotfon-mouthed friends, here's a time killer while
our much anticipated lager makes its way into your hands.
It should be worth the wait. Hailing from the world's
craftbrewing epicenter, Portland Brewing's Zig River
Lager is aromatic and quaffable, with subtle malt favors
and a light hoppy finish. It's aged a full month-about
the time it should take to jfnish this puzzle.
