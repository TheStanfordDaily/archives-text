# New ASSU presidential team steps up to the task
## Funding cycle, services ton agenda for Andrus 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
At nearly 11 p.m. on May 6, minutes after the
ASSU Senate had certified its 1997 presidential elec
tion, newly elected ASSU Vice President Ben Decker
walked slowly down a Law School hallway. He
paused, rested his hands on the handle of the glass
door in front of him and sighed with relief.
"Free at last," he said.
After withstanding an intense campaign and a
controversial election, Decker and ASSU President

Emily Andrus, both juniors, are in
deed free to begin their duties as
the new chief executives of the
ASSU. And they are anxious to put
the election behind them.
"In politics, you just sort of roll
with the punches," Andrus said.
"We're really excited to get to
work."
Their new work falls into two


Andrus
basic categories: immediate actions
and a long-term agenda.
The former category — the goals
the duo would like to achieve before
the end of spring quarter — focuses
mainly on building foundations for
next year, Andrus said. They plan
to spend most of the quarter meet
ing with student groups and ad
ministrators, familiarizing them
selves with the people they will
work with next year.
They are also working on finaliz
ing a new ASSU funding procedure
in time. Currently, funds are not al
located until the middle of the quar
ter for which they are requested.
Andrus' system would allot money
by the end of the preceding quarter,
except for fall quarter, when the
process would be completed within
the term's first few weeks in order
to give new groups a chance to re
quest funding.
Mainly, though, Andrus and
Decker are focusing on their long
term plans for the ASSU, echoing
t he issues that formed the basis of
their campaign.

One primary goal will be to im
prove student services. In a broad
sense, that means encouraging the
development of University pro
grams and student groups in order
to meet student needs.
Andrus pointed to the Career
Planning and Placement Center as
one target of this plan. She has al
ready begun working with CPPC
Director Bob Thirsk to expand the
center to provide career opportuni
ties for more students, specifically
those with humanities and social
sciences majors.
"It's a valuable service," Andrus
said, "and one that can always be
improved upon."
They continue to stress their
plan to review how the ASSU fun
damentally relates to students and
administrators. One of their first
goals is to fill all open student seats
on University committees with
dedicated, accountable students.
Additionally, they want to schedule
times for each committee member
to report back to the full ASSU Sen
ate.
Filling the empty committee po
sitions, Andrus said, will serve as a
stepping stone to increased student
representation. And while she
won't commit to seeking the addi

tion of a student seat to the Board
of Trustees, she said there will be "a
significant push for more student
representation on the board."
Both the president and vice pres
ident are excited about working
with a senate that will include only
a handful of returning members.
"You're going to see a lot less
bickering" in the senate, Decker
said, "and more action. You're look
ing at a senate that will focus on is
sues."
Andrus and Decker do not just
expect the senate to be different
next year; they feel their adminis
tration will be in several ways a de
parture from that oftheir predeces
sors, junior Bill Shen and senior
Nick Thompson.
Andrus expects more efficiency
and fiscal responsibility from the
ASSU President's Office, but Deck
er thinks the vice presidency may
reflect the more drastic change
from last year.
"I think Nick did a lot of good
things as vice president," he said.
"My vision of ♦ he office is somewhat
different thj n ' I see the vice
president b m; more associated
with the senrte, someone working
more in the capacity of a coordina
tor."
