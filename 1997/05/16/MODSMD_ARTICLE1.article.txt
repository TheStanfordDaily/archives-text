At nearly 11 p.m. on May 6, minutes after the
ASSU Senate had certified its 1997 presidential elec
tion, newly elected ASSU Vice President Ben Decker
walked slowly down a Law School hallway. He
paused, rested his hands on the handle of the glass
door in front of him and sighed with relief.
"Free at last," he said.
After withstanding an intense campaign and a
controversial election, Decker and ASSU President

Emily Andrus, both juniors, are in
deed free to begin their duties as
the new chief executives of the
ASSU. And they are anxious to put
the election behind them.
"In politics, you just sort of roll
with the punches," Andrus said.
"We're really excited to get to
work."
Their new work falls into two
