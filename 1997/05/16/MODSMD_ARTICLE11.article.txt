# Death penalty sought for Unabomer suspect

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Attor
ney General Janet Reno ordered
prosecutors yesterday to seek the
death penalty for Unabomber sus
pect Theodore Kaczynski despite
pleas from his family that he be
spared, a family spokesman and
Justice officials said.
"The family is devastated by
this development and they are in
seclusion at this time," said family
attorney Anthony Bisceglie. "We
believe that the attorney general's
decision is a terrible mistake, but
we remain hopeful that justice will
ultimately prevail in this tragic
case."
In a four-page memo filed yes
terday in federal court in Sacra
mento, Calif., prosecutors told the
court that "a sentence of death is
justified, and the United States
will seek the death penalty."
According to the filing, the
death sentence is justified because
Kaczynski intentionally killed the
victims, intentionally inflicted seri
ous bodily injury and intentionally
participated in an act contemplat
ing that the life of a person would
be taken.
Moreover, the government
wrote, "the defendant has commit
ted two other murders and numer
ous other significant acts of vio
lence and attempted acts of vio
lence, and has made threats

against others."
Kaczynski shows no remorse
and would not be a good candidate
for rehabilitation, the prosecutors
wrote.
Prosecutors contend he is
responsible for 18 years of bomb
ings that killed three people and
injured 23 others in a campaign
against technology.
Although Reno personally
opposes the death penalty, Presi
dent Clinton supports it and she
has pledged to enforce it.
The family argued that other
families in the future might be
reluctant to turn in relatives if a
death sentence were imposed in
this case.
The . r )4-year-old math profes
sor-turned-hermit faces a Nov. 12
trial in Sacramento, Calif., on 10
federal counts covering four explo
sions that killed two people there
and maimed two others. He faces a
later trial in Newark, N.J., on fed
eral charges that he mailed a pack
age bomb that killed advertising
executive Thomas Mosser in New
Jersey. Kaczynski has pleaded
innocent in both cases.
He was arrested April 3, 1996 at
his remote cabin near Lincoln,
Mont. After years of fruitless
search for the elusive bomber,
authorities were directed there by
the Kaczynski family.
