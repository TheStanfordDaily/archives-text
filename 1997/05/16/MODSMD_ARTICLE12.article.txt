New evidence against McVeigh
DENVER (AP) — Pieces of twisted metal found for
blocks around the bombed Oklahoma City federal
building could have come from the Ryder truck Tim
othy McVeigh allegedly rented to deliver the bomb, a
truck expert testified yesterday.
Edward Michael Paddock, a former Ford engineer,
came into court with a Ryder truck that was cut into
pieces to show jurors .the parts. It was matched
against the pieces of blackened and mangled metal

found at the scene.
The axle from the demonstration truck matched
the one that was hurled a block away by the blast,
Paddock said.
The vehicle number from the mangled axle was
used to trace it to the Ryder truck that a witness tes
tified he rented to McVeigh two days before the April
19,1995, bombing.
The most dramatic moment Wednesday came
when jurors saw chilling black-and-white surveillance
pictures of a Ryder truck moving toward the federal

building minutes before a bomb blew the nine-story
structure apart, killing 168 people and injuring more
than 500.
Anti-smoking pill approved
WASHINGTON (AP) — Smokers trying to kick
the habit now can pop a pill to help: The government
approved the first nicotine-free anti-smoking drug
yesterday, one that works in the brain at the source of
addiction.

Zyban is a prescription antidepressant that can
curb the cravings and withdrawal symptoms smokers
face when they quit.
And for hard-core smokers, doctors can try dealing
the addiction a one-two punch by combining Zyban
with nicotine patches, said manufacturer Glaxo Well
come Inc. and the Food and Drug Administration.
"We've demonstrated that you can treat smoking
addiction with a non-nicotine approach. I would call it
a breakthrough," said Glaxo pharmacologist Andrew
Johnston.
