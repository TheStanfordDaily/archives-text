Project allowing students
the chance to teach is
excellent career training

A CAREER PATH is certainly
not straight and narrow.
Those wanting to delve into
politics can't go straight to the floor
of Congress, and those considering
medicine aren't immediately
plunked down in the middle of the
National Institutes for Health.
But for those interested in teach
ing, Stanford does offer an excellent
training ground for budding educa
tors: the Stanford High School
Enrichment Project. This program,
sponsored by Stanford's Education
al Studies Program, not only offers
a valuable out-of-the-classroom
experience for those considering
teaching as a profession but also
provides local high school students
a taste of the academic fervor for
which our university is known.
Founded last year, SHEP allows
students to design a class that they
teach for two hours every Saturday
for eight weeks. These classes do
not merely fall under the humdrum
category of the Three Rs. Rather,
previous course titles have included
such attractive offerings as "The
Physics of Siege Weaponry" and
"The History of the Beatles."

Students' flexibility in designing
the courses is beneficial in a num
ber of ways. First of all, it allows the
student-teachers to engage their
pupils in topics which truly interest
themselves â€” something that
always makes the classroom experi
ence more enjoyable and education
ally worthwhile for all. Second,
placing the lesson plans in the
hands of the student-teachers
makes them solely responsible for
ensuring that their own pupils get
the most out of their Saturdays.
And what the local high school
students do get out of their classes
seems to be meaningful. They have
given glowing reviews of the course
subjects as well as the classes' nur
turing environments.
Moreover, SHEP is an enrich
ment program, not merely a reme
dial tutorial program. While there
are other programs which signifi
cantly help disadvantaged students,
SHEP fills the gap of providing
additional, stimulating instruction
to all kinds of students.
Ironically, though, the most
stimulating instruction might end
up in the laps of the Stanford stu
dents. SHEP gives them a practical
training ground where they can see
firsthand how other students learn
and how best they can help u
dents learn more. For those u. c
ested in teaching, SHEP sets up a
formidable road sign on that some
times serpentine career path.
