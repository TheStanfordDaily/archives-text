At a time when the Cold War
was still heating up, Louis
Zeitz, a 38-year-old graduate
student in biophysics, appeared
before the House Un-American
Activities Sub-Committee in San
Francisco.
The commitee, which supposed
ly only subpoenaed people who
were actively working in the Com
munist Party toward the overthrow

of the U.S. government, did not get
much of a response from Zeitz. He
refused to answer questions about
his political associations, citing his
First and Fifth Amendment rights,
but did read a prepared statement
to the committee.
"I will take no part in the efforts
of this monstrosity of a committee
to ossify people's minds, to para
lyze people with fear," Zeitz said.
