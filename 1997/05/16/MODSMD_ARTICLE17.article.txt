## Sensitive but not stoned 
### 
£ "TJULL OVER." I looked at Richard,
the big, distinctly nonmenacing
JL driving instructor who was using
ppit wads on the windshield to help me
barn to parallel park.
His undivided attention was my reward
for having failed my driving test for the
second time. I much preferred him to Joe,
who had the reputation for asking stu
dents out on dates without even inviting
them over to meet his wife. Richard was a
blessing, i puiiea ovu.
With effort, he twisted his upper body
until he was nearly facing me. He assessed
my grasp on the steering wheel, wiped his
mouth on his sleeve and, with deep gravi
ty, cleared his throat.
"Einstein failed out of high school," he
said carefully. "Everyone thought he was
very stupid." I gazed at him. "Einstein
was a very smart man," he said. "Every
one thought Einstein was slow. And he
was. Very slow. But he was logical."
Richard stopped. He considered me.
"You are like Einstein."
Two hours later, with tears streaming
down my hurt ego, I related the story to
my father. He grinned at me. "You do
know,"he said, "that you are probably the
only person who has ever made that man
feel he was, in comparison, a genius?"
I seem to perform that service regular
ly. There has been a long procession of
human beings who, on first meeting me,
have been able to discern a lot about my
mental state. "Drunk," some pronounce.

"On a Monday morning?" others argue.
"No, she's not drunk. Stoned, probably."
People assume I have a vested interest
in the legalization of marijuana. Keg
standers stumble over to me and slur out
their concern that I might not be sober
enough to walk home. I believe I have
developed something of a complex. Sensi
tivity, that dang double-edged sword,
strikes me down all the time.
On Wednesday, as I walked down Uni
versity Avenue on my way back from the
Ecumenical Hunger Program, I began my
daily duel with myself over every unfortu
nate blunder I had made, every uncom
fortable silence, every misplaced remark.
Why are you so awkward, Wiener? And
so ditsy? And why do you keep making
mistakes? Are you stoned? A choir of
ghosts hurried to help me in my attack.
"You are a tattletale and a spoiled brat,"
screamed my next-door neighbor after her
sons hosed down my little brother and I
disclosed the information. "You seem pret
ty obnoxious," chimed in a field adviser
from a summer volunteer program in
Paraguay. "You are the kind of person who
perpetuates sexism. Why do you act so
stupid?" wondered a high school teacher.
I crossed Middlefield Road under full
internal assault.
For some reason, and no not THAT rea
son, I had an out-of-body experience right
then. On the verge of tears, I smiled. Not to
put on a brave front or because euphoria
fills the vacuum created by sadness. Not

because of something poignant or some
thing phallic or something ironic.
But because I missed too much of my 9
a.m. calculus class and I forgot that the
transitive property only works one way.
Because when I am happy, I smile. I fig
ured it must follow that, when I smile, I
will be happy.
University Avenue on a weekday is
crowded with coffee-drinkers, rapscallion
skateboarders and illicit sitters and liers.
Perhaps the majority of these thought I
wa3 stoned as I trudged down the sidewalk
with a huge grin pasted on my face.
But for all the funny looks I ignored, I
took the grins personally. Every "hello"
took me higher. And, hell, no "hi" took me
lower.
A driving instructor insulting me with
comparisons to Einstein can be painful or
amusing. A teacher who pronounces me
stupid for participating too thoughtfully
can be hurtful — or ironic. I can internal
ize everything everyone pipes in to the nar
rative of my self-conception.
But it can be kind of depressing. As my
goal in life is to have laugh lines around my
eyes, I guess I'd do well to give my filter a
cleaning.
