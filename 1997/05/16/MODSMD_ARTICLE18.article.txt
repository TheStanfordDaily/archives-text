Both Armenians and Turks responsible for genocide

ON APRIL 24TH in The Daily,
Armen Panossian urges us to
remember and learn from the
"Armenian genocide." The suffering of
Armenians in 1915 is a sad historical real
ity, and we sincerely share his sorrow. We
also feel that Panossian's attempt to edu
cate the Stanford community serves a
worthy and important function, especially
since an honest and open debate about the
roots of the Turkish-Armenian conflict
might be the only way to improve relations
in the region.
Please allow us therefore to comment
on a rather emotional claim that Panos
sian presents, namely that the aim of the
expanding Ottoman empire to assume
control of Armenians' lands resulted in
the genocide of more than 11/2 million
Armenians in 1915.
First of all, the "ancient Armenian
lands" were six "Vilayets" (provinces) in
Eastern Anatolia under Turkish-
Ottoman sovereign rule. These provinces
were conquered by the Turkish Seljuk
Empire from the Byzantine Empire after
the battle of Malazgirt in 1071 and
remained under the rule of various Turk
ish warlords until the consolidation of
Anatolia by the Ottoman Empire in 1514.
So, in 1915, there was no "expansion of
Ottoman rule," as the "ancestral Armeni
an lands" had been under Ottoman rule
for 400 years and under Turkish rule for
800 years.
Although the Armenians comprised
less than one-fiflh of the population in

this area, the fact that they managed to
preserve their culture, identity and reli
gion during this period of 800 years
should give at least some crcdit to the
religious and cultural tolerance of their
Turkish rulers.
So what happened in 1915? At this
point the Ottoman Empire was certainly
not expanding, as Panossian says; on the
contrary, it was fighting for survival in
World War I against Allied progress on
four different fronts. At this point, more
than 150,000 Ottoman-Armenians, moti
vated by the promise of an independent
Armenia, joined the Russian forces which
were invading northeastern Anatolia
while Armenian guerrillas were attacking
the Ottoman army from the south.
The entire Muslim population of Van
was massacred during the most atrocious
of these attacks. It was under these cir
cumstances that the Ottoman govern
ment decided to "relocate" all of its
Armenian citizens living in the six
Vilayets to the southern Ottoman
provinces in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.
(Armenians living in other parts of the
empire, especially Istanbul, were not
included in this deportation program).
The consequences of this relocation
were undeniably grim. Poor logistic sup
port to the Ottoman troops overseeing
the relocation let hunger, adverse weath
er conditions, diseases and attacks by
armed bandits (mostly desertees from the
Ottoman army) diminish the ranks of the
deportees. However, the Ottoman army

command was not indifferent to this
tragedy, as the relocation was followed by
close to 1,500 court martials and execu
tions of those who were found guilty or
atrocities.
In any case, the grisly toll on human
life afflicted by the deportation was clear:
according to the estimation by the head
of the Armenian Delegation to the Paris
Peace Conference in 1919, 300,000 Arme
nians died in this period. Later estima
tions by several historians displayed that
the number of the Armenian victims was
as high as 600,000.
Unfortunately, the bloody conse
quences of the relocation were not over
once the Armenians reached their desti
nation, and this is the part of story that is
most often overlooked. Immediately after
the Ottoman Empire surrendered to the
Allies in 1918, the short-lived Republic of
Armenia invaded Eastern Anatolia, and
its troops began a systematic massacre of
the Turkish-Muslim population in the
provinces that they occupied until Turk
ish control of the region was restored in
early 1920.
The consequences of the intercommu
nal violence and harsh war conditions
were readily observed in the first postwar
census that showed that the Turkish-
Muslim population in Anatolia had
diminished by 2 1 / 2 million, not count
ing military losses. As one American
scholar pointed out, "if this is genocide, it
was a strange genocide indeed, one in
which many more killers than victims

perished."
Many Turkish families from Eastern
Anatolia remember this period as vividly
as their counterparts in the Armenian
diaspora remember the "relocation," and
their historical grievances are equally
great. To them, accepting to be the perpe
trators of an "Armenian genocide" is tan
tamount to defying the memory of their
family members who perished in the
hands of Armenians before the relocation
or in 1918-19 and is completely unaccept
able.
No one can justify the human losses
and deny that this was a real tragedy in
the Anatolian history: Two communities
who lived together in peace for centuries
ended up slaughtering each other, and
what's worse, ended up hating each other
for the rest of the century.
However, we believe that the dissemi
nation of biased views only serves to
inflame the hatred among our communi
ties and not to amend the almost century
long divide. Indeed, what we need to
learn is how to establish mutual under
standing and perpetual peace in the
region where Turkey and Armenia are
placed side-by-side and among our com
munities spread around the world.
