# All right now for departing band director
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
The composer Felix Mendelssohn once told a col
league, "What I say, I must say in music." But the
gift of 30 years of music from Arthur P. Barnes still
has not yet said it all.
In his own words, "This is not the end. It's the
commencement."
Professor emeritus of music, director of bands,
composer of concertos and arranger of what has
come to be Stanford's theme song, "All Right Now,"
the student-dubbed "silver-maned maestro of funk"
is retiring for the final time at the end of this acade
mic year.
Four years ago, the elimination of some graduate
level programs in the Music Department terminated
several of Barnes' courses. He "retired" with a great
deal of fanfare from many alumni and students.
"But what is retirement anyway?" he said.
Barnes agreed to continue his conducting and di
recting positions and signed a new contract "to work
as an 80-percent employee, 100 percent of the work
with 80 percent of the'pay," he joked. At least with
his new emeritus title, he explained, "I returned
with a free parking sticker."
The Chamber Orchestra, the Symphonic Band
and the Zoo Band, a.k.a. the Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band, all of which
Barnes directs, were pleased, to say the least.
Barnes said his main job description as band di
rector was to "write the songs and try to keep the
Band out of jail," but according to past Band mem-
bers, his input has done more
than that. He has not only shaped
the Band's musical repertoire by
arranging more than 300 differ
ent songs, including the Stan
ford's pseudo-fight song, "All
Right Now," but he has molded
the style of the Band Stanford
knows today.
"Oh no, I'm not responsible at
all," Barnes said about his role in
the Band, perhaps to escape liabil
ity, but more likely out of mod
esty. "It's a completely student
run thing. I just write the songs."
Other students would argue
differently. University Bursar
Jon Erickson, Class of '65, played
the cannon in his undergraduate
years and said Barnes oversaw
the evolution of the Band.
"We came up with a halftime
show called 'And Now a Word
from Our Sponsor,' a series of 20-
second commercial jingles that
Barnes had arranged," Erickson
said. "That's when we first used
the scattering technique, running
from place to place instead of
marching." The Zoo had arrived.
While he carried the Band
through its transformation from
its straight-marching, ironed-uni
form, Sousa-tooting days to the in
describable antics of the "world's
largest rock band," he insisted he's
still exactly the same down to the
white hair.
Actually, while Barnes' 1960s
dark brown coif may have
changed in recent years to a daz

zling white, his unorthodox na
ture has remained, and, because
of it, so has the Band's character
istic zaniness.
"He's eccentric," said Band
Manager Scott McKissen, "but in
a good way. He brought a distinc
tive personality to the Band that
allowed people in it to be distinc
tive as well."
The change began as an un
steady partnership between a
fresh-faced Stanford graduate
student named Arthur Barnes
and 65 members of a convention
al band in 1963. "We welcomed
him with unopened arms," said
Erickson.
But that era is now history.
Barnes won them over with his
own arrangement of the "Star-
Spangled Banner" which begins
with the distinct, solemn strains
of a lone trumpet and drum and
eventually builds to a chorus
played by the entire band.
Robert Mann, Class of '74 and
a former member of the drumline,
remembers Barnes' version of the
anthem to be so striking that he
believes "the nation should seri
ously consider adapting his ver
sion as its national anthem."
Every one of his students has
stories about his perfect pitch,
said Dan Ginsburg, manager of
the Symphonic Band. "Everyone
loves and respects him," he said.
Barnes' original specialties lie
in trombone and piano, although
he is reputed to be able to play
every band instrument in exis
tence.
What is surprising is the
roundabout way he found his
niche in the music world. Barnes

began as an engineering major at
Swarthmore College before even
tually earning his doctorate of
musical arts from Stanford in
1963.
In more recent years, Barnes
has concentrated on teaching,
conducting and composition.
Among his own works are "Suite
for Orchestra," "Yosemite Suite"
and "Centennial Trumpet Con
certo," which will be featured in
his final Symphonic Band concert
this Sunday.
Barnes called his own music
"not unique, just pleasant." He
said the many musical awards
and honors he has received over
the years are "light-weight hype."
"What has been most impor
tant has been my family," he said.
Both his daughters have musical
backgrounds; one is a profession
al violinist / violist, the other an
accomplished bassoonist. Both
live in the Boston area.
Now that he has the time, he
and his wife will be traveling to
the East Coast often.
"Traveling and nature. I'll be
spending a lot of time on the
beach," Barnes said.
Not wanting to abandon the
performance world, he will con
tinue to be director of the Liver
more Amador Symphony. He also
hopes to do more composing on
the computer.
Looking back over the years,
he said, "I don't think I really ever
changed anything for anyone at a
personal level."
Mann disagreed. "I will forever
be indebted to him for giving me
the greatest moments of my life,"
he said.
