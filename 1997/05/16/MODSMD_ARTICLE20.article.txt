### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Thirty years of dedication to Stanford will be
concluded at the spring Symphonic Band and
Chamber Orchestra concerts directed by the man
of honor himself, Arthur P. Barnes.
The penultimate curtain call for Arthur Barnes
will take place Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, when the Symphonic Band presents a
program including Igor Stravinsky's Piano Con
certo, Barnes' Centennial Trumpet Concerto and
Georg Frederic Handel's "Royal Fireworks"
music.
Barnes will direct Stravinsky's concerto as fea
tured soloist from behind the piano. He described
the virtuoso piece as having a strong jazz influ
ence, although he claims, "I do a lot of the oom
pah-pah work."
His own composition, which he said is "a pleas
ant and simple trumpet showpiece," will be per
formed by Joyce Johnson, trumpet lecturer in the
Music Department.
The program will conclude with the Handel, in

which a massive collection of 30 oboes and bas
soons will be played by alumni and students.
Barnes' final concert as director of the Cham
ber Orchestra will be held May 28 at 8 p.m., also in
Dinkelspiel.
The Chamber Orchestra will present a program
with several invited guests from the Music De
partment. The resident professional ensemble,
the Stanford String Quartet, combined with se
lected students will perform the popular classical
favorite Felix Mendelssohn Octet in E flat minor.
Also on the program are the Mendelssohn
"Symphony for Strings" and the Alban Berg
Chamber Concerto for Violin, Piano and 13 Wind
Instruments. Undergraduate performers Jack Yu
and Sarah Young will close the program as fea
tured soloists in Aaron Copland's "Quiet City."
Chamber Orchestra member Glenn
chakul, a sophomore, said the concert repertoire
is especially exciting, since it is a "change from
the tired old Bach and Mozart everyone is used
to."
General admission for both concerts is $8.50,
with free admission to Stanford students.
