### Boris Natasha Itar-Tass News Service 
In a stunning victory for the
Supreme Soviet, Comrade Car
olynichka Sleethovna defeated
capitalist opponent Jesse Oxfeld,
an American, last night to become
the 212 th editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily.
"The workers of The Daily have
united! The proletariat has found
its voice!" proclaimed the victor.
"Together, we will cast off the
chains of bourgeois oppression
and reclaim our rightful place in
command of this media empire."
Comrade Sleethovna, a junior
studying Russian and Eastern Eu
ropean history, spent fall quarter
in Moscow, where she first fully
realized the shortcomings of
American capitalism and the su
periority of Slavic culture.
Deputing from her traditional
Soviet composure, Comrade
Sleethovna allowed herself a mo
ment of Western emotion.
"She got so excited," said Ryan
Medders, outgoing opinions editor
and Russophile, "that she kept
flailing her arms and hit me in the
face a few times."
"I think HI have bruises," he
moaned.
Sleethovna was unapologetic.
"That some must suffer on the
eve of Revolution is not a regret
but a rallying cry for the new era,"
she cried.
The victory champagne — pro
vided by agents of the Western
media — proved too cumbersome
for the new leader. She ordered
that the drinks be replaced by a
mixture of vodka and Diet Snap
pie.
"This is how we do it in the
Motherland," she said, drinking
the confection and deeply inhaling
a slice of Russian rye.
"Chasers are for weak capital
ists who bend under the forces of
the slightest wind," the devout
Communist said.
Sleethovna has promised to re
structure The Daily's editorial
staff in a manner similar to the
now-defunct KGB.
"When in Moscow, I learned
that certain ways of doing things
are inherently superior to others,"
she said. "I believe in rigidity and
order."
"There will be no dissent with
in my staff; there cannot be," she
added. "I have been chosen as the

voice of the workers. Through me,
they shall speak to the world.
Their interests are my interests.
Their words are my words. United
we shall raise this publication
from the mediocrity it has suf
fered. The Daily will return to
greatness!"
Current Editor in Chief Eliza
beth Goldman responded vehe
mently to the allegations of medi
ocrity.
"I am proud of what I have ac
complished," she said. "The fact
that the ASSU Senate censured us
attests to my consummate skill."
Cadre Therese Lee was excited
about the anticipated change in
regime but expressed sadness at
Goldman's imminent departure.
"She never lost touch with the
people," said Lee, who still does
not live with a boy. "She under
stood the plight of the working
class."
Politburo Member Patrick
Bernhardt also announced sup
port for the new Communist
leader.
"We must all be servants to the
Party," said Bernhardt, who lives
with a boy. "To do anything else
would be foolhardy."

On hearing the news in New
York, Comrade Garry Kasparov —
the chess grandmaster recently
defeated by another imperialist
machine, IBM's Deep Blue — un
leashed a joyous roar.
"This ife a grand testimony to
the resiliehce of Mother Russia,"
Kasparov Isaid. "But don't get me
wrong. If t had run, I would have
buried her."
Reaction, however, was not
uniformly celebratory.
Filming a movie in Siberia, Fa
mous Russian Funnyman Billy
Crystal spoke with regret when
notified of the results.
"I'm happy that Carolynichka
won, but I'm sad that Jesse had to
lose," Crystal said. "He's one of
my people, and I have a policy of
always backing Jews."

Editor's note: In order to provide
accurate information to readers as
soon as possible, The Daily is ob
ligated to report that due to techni
cal problems and the inefficiencies
of a Labour government, The
Daily's Oxford bureau was unable
to cast ballots in this election.
Thankfully, no Daily staff mem
ber was in Oxford at the time.
