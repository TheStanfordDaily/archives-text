## No. 2 women badger opponent Card sweeps past No. 21 Wisconsin 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team started off its postsea
son in strong fashion yesterday,
blanking No. 21 Wisconsin 5-0 in
the opening round of the NCAA
Championship at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Stadium.
The Badgers were overpowered
by the second-seeded Cardinal, los
ing the first five singles matches in
straight sets.
"It went well today," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "I told the
girls not to expect a thing of beau
ty because we haven't played a
match in what seems like two
months. But we looked better than
I expected."
For the Cardinal, it was the two
co-captains who set the tone early
as senior Katie Schlukebir and
junior Julie Scott jumped out to
quick starts on the No. 3 and No. 6
courts, respectively.
"The two of them have been
working very hard at this," Bren
nan said. "Both of them have been
working to make sure that all of
their i's are dotted and their t's are
crossed."
After working through a slight

case of the nerves, the rest of the
lineup, namely freshman Lilia
Osterloh, followed suit.
"Lilia has played in six different
countries in all of these tourna
ments," Brennan said. "So you
don't expect her to be too nervous.
Plus, she has been through this
whole season, as well."
Osterloh and Wisconsin's
Melissa Zimpfer traded breaks to
open the first set of the No. 1 sin
gles match, but Osterloh turned it
around by breaking No. 7 Zimpfer
to go up 4-2 in the first set.
"I was a little nervous to start,"
Osterloh said. "But after losing
the first game, I just let loose."
The second set then proceeded
on serve until Osterloh earned
another break to tie the second set
at 4-4 and went on to win the
match 6-2, 6-4.
The home-court advantage also
played a large role in loosening up
the Cardinal.
"I felt very comfortable on our
own courts, in front of our crowd,"
Osterloh said. "It almost seemed
too perfect."
Said Schlukebir, who has
played her three tournaments at
Florida State, Pepperdine and
Georgia: "It was nice for a change
to be cheered for, rather than
cheered against."
Schlukebir, the top-ranked sin
gles player in the nation, broke out
to a 4-0 lead on the third singles
court, but Badger Colleen Lucey
pulled to within 4-2. Schlukebir
responded by taking the next two
games, the first set, and then the
match 6-2, 6-1.
Scott stole the first set of her
No. 5 match before Wisconsin's
Andrea Nathan could get any sort
of momentum going. Nathan hung
tough in the second set, but Scott
clinched the dual-match win with
a 6-0, 6-4 victory.
On the No. 2 court, freshman
Anne Kremer broke Badger Bar
bara Urbanska to take a 4-2 first
set lead and never looked back.
Kremer rolled in the second set
and earned a 6-2, 6-3 win.
After a slow start, senior San
dra De Silva took care of business
in the No. 4 singles match. De
Silva and Badger Tracy Zobrist
battled back and forth in the first
set. De Silva then got rolling and
took eight of the last nine games
of the match for a 6-3, 6-2 tri
umph.
With the five singles victories,
freshman Teryn Ashley's match at
No. 6 singles and all three of the
doubles matches were suspended.
The Cardinal advanced to the
second round of the tournament
and brings a 16-match winning
streak into its meeting with No. 10
William and Mary. The Tribe
upset No. 5 Georgia in a 5-0 first
round sweep. The quarterfinal
match will be played at 2 p.m.
In other action, the other top
seeds, Florida (1), Duke (3) and
UCLA (4) all advanced to the sec
ond round.
