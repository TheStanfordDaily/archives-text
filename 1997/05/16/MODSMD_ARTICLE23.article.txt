# Gym coach resigns
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
Lisa Izzi yesterday announced
she will resign from her position
as head coach of the women's
gymnastics team, saying she
wanted to spend more time with
her family.
Izzi came to Stanford in 1991
as assistant coach and led the
squad as head coach for the past
two seasons. Izzi is the mother of
Winston Izzi, age 2, and is
expecting a second child at the
end of the year.
"I am sad to leave Stanford
University, but I am extremely
proud of the team's accomplish
ments and the increased level of
enthusiasm and support for the
women's gymnastics team," Izzi

said. "It is now time for me to
devote more attention to my
family needs."
During Izzi's two years as
head coach, the Stanford team
broke into a new caliber of colle
giate gymnastics, placing ninth
at the NCAA Championships in
1996 and sending two team mem
bers to the NCAAs this year. Her
team also placed third and fifth
at NCAA West Regionals, in 1996
and 1997, respectively.
"We want to thank Lisa for
her dedication and hard work in
helping to build the Stanford
women's gymnastics program,"
said Athletic Director Ted
Leland. "We wish her and her
family all the best in the future."
"She had talked about want
ing more children," said sopho
more Tracey Kohl, a member of
the team. "I'm not surprised she
wants to do that now. "
Kohl said the team will
launch a national search for an
experienced coach to head the
squad next season. Adding that
California and possibly Oregon
State may be looking for head
coaches as well, Kohl said it will
be important that the team try
to select a new coach as soon as
possible.
"We are recruiting head
coaches from top gymnastics
schools," she said. "We want
someone who is going to come
right in and immediately make a
difference."
