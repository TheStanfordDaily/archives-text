## Crimson first up for netters

And they're off.
Only this time, the Stanford
men's tennis team need not fly
across the country in its quest
to clinch a third consecutive
national championship.
The second-ranked Cardinal
(22-2) plays its first-round
match of the NCAA Champi
onships, hosted by UCLA, at
noon tomorrow against Har
vard.
"We are looking forward to
the match, and everyone is
ready to play," said head coach
Dick Gould.
The Card is used to spending
tournament days in hot and
humid Georgia, which has host
ed the tournament 17 out of the
past 20 years. While this year's
tournament comes closer to
home for the Card, it's still on

competitive turf, as the Bruins
host the tournament. Although
Stanford has had success in the
South, capturing 12 team titles
since 1977, having the tourna
ment in Southern California will
allow more Stanford fans to
come support the team.
Stanford, seeded third in the
tournament, is the heavy favorite
for its first-round match against
the Crimson. But Gould insists
that the team is not looking
ahead to the tougher matches
later in the draw.
"Harvard always has good
players, and they come right at
you," Gould said. "They have
some guys that we recruited on
their team. We are just thinking
about that match right now."

The Crimson finished 17-5 in
the Ivy League and will face
tough competition against the
strong Cardinal lineup, which
includes Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division co-players of
the year Bob Bryan, a freshman,
and sophomore Ryan Wolters.
Stanford will also be bringing
back Paul Goldstein, the No. 15
player in the nation. The junior,
who has been absent from the
lineup since March due to a foot
injury, is expected to be in the
lineup for the Card this week
end. Goldstein played doubles in
the Pac-10 Championship with
Wolters but has not seen dual
match play since midseason.
Other top players for the Card
include Bob's twin brother Mike,
also a season-long starter, as
well as freshman Geoff Abrams
and senior captain Grant Elliott.
Should Stanford get past Har
vard, it will inevitably face a

strong team in its second-round
match tomorrow, facing the win
ner of Kentucky-Texas. Stanford
suffered only two losses all sea
son, one of which was to Ken
tucky at the National Team
Indoor Championship back on
Feb. 20, when the Card fell to
the Wildcats 5-2. Stanford later
went on to play Texas in the con
solation bracket of that tourna
ment, edging the Longhorns 4-3.
However, since then, the Card
has been strong through injuries
and against all Pac-10 competi
tion. The Card's only other loss
was at the hands of UCLA in
Westwood April 4, with two
Stanford players sidelined.
"We are expecting Paul to
play, and overall the guys are
healthy. We are looking forward
to the first round," Gould said.
So are the fans. A trip down
south is much faster than a trek
to Georgia.
