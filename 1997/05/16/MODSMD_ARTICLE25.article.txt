# Talent, hard work special ingredients in Cardinal dynasty

What is Stanford's secret recipe to a
sports program which is consistently
exquisite?
White shorts, bright yellow balls, a little
sunblock, an interminable passion and a
fiercely competitive edge from both the
players and coaches may be a fine start.
The Stanford men's tennis team is one
of the most impressive athletic programs
on the Farm. At a school which sends ath
letes to the Olympics like they were Little
League tryouts, has won the Sears Cup
the past two years and has already cap
tured four national championships this
year alone, the fact that the tennis pro
gram stands near the top makes its
accomplishments that much more impres
sive.
Under head coach Dick Gould, the Car
dinal has won 14 NCAA team titles since
1973. Since 1970, any Stanford player to
play four years for the Cardinal program
has left the Farm with at least one cham
pionship ring.

This season has demonstrated that such
impressive statistics are no fluke or past
phenomenon. This year looked to be a
transition year for some with the loss of
three graduating seniors. Three freshmen
would break into the starting lineup, fill
ing the shoes of the departed Jeff Salzen
stein, Jim Thomas and Ricky Becker.
However, the season has proved to be
another landmark year thus far for Stan
ford tennis. The three freshmen proved
that despite their youth, they can hold
their own against the best in collegiate ten
nis. Freshman Bob Bryan captured the
Pacific 10 Conference open title, while fel
low frosh Geoff Abrams took home the
individual title. As a team, Stanford has
not lost a dual match since it fell to the
Bruins at UCLA April 4.
The Cardinal suffered only two losses the
entire season and managed to pull out huge
victories against top-ranked UCIjA and No.
13 USC in a single weekend trip to Los
Angeles. All this, keep in mind, with one of
its top two players, All-American Paul Gold
stein, out for half the season.
In its most recent competition, Stan

ford thrashed its way through all oppo
nents April 24-27 at the Pac-10 Champi
onships, winning all four events, and bat
tling one another in two of the four final
matches.
Now it is time to play for another cham
pionship where the Cardinal is not the top
seed. Similar circumstances did not faze
the squad last season when it took out
UCLA to clinch a second-consecutive title.
If Stanford can clinch a championship this
year, it will be a three-peat for the Cardi
nal squad, earning it 12 team titles in the
past 19 years. Only Stanford has won three
titles in a row under the current NCAA
championship format, making its three
year run from 1988-90.
Other top-notch programs would proba
bly love to know the secret ingredient
which consistently yields such delicious
results for the Card.
"The guys are just really excited to be
here. They are ready to go out and play,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
Whatever it may be, all eyes will be on
Stanford this week at the NCAA Champi
onships trying to decipher the formula.
