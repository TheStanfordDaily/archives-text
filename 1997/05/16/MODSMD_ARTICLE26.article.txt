# Sluggers win on homer in 10th
## 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Some nights it's just a good
idea to forget the bullpen and
leave the starter in.
For the No. 5 Stanford Cardi
nal (39-16), last night would
have been one of those nights.
Despite seven four-hit innings
from junior starter Kyle Peter
son, Stanford relief pitching and
defensive gaffes forced the Car
dinal to wait until a two-run
home run in the bottom of the

10th by junior catcher Jon Scha
effer gave Stanford a 7-6 come
from-behind victory in the first
game of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championship Series
against the No. 23 Washington
Huskies (41-18).
With the Huskies leading in
the bottom of the 10th by a 6-5
margin, sophomore Jody Gerut,
was able to spark Cardinal hopes
by drawing a walk to open the
inning. After freshman desig
nated hitter John Gail struck
out, Schaeffer slammed a 3-1

fastball over the fence for his
19th homer of the season.
Schaeffer raised his arms as
soon as it was hit, knowing it
was a game-winner.
"This just goes to show you
that this team is never going to
back down," Schaeffer said. "We
had to buckle down."
Last night's win gives Stan
ford a chance to close out the
series tonight in a 7 p.m. game
at Sunken Diamond. If Washing-

ton wins today, the decisive
game will be at 1 p.m. tomorrow.
Until the eighth, the Cardi
nal's strategy had been simple:
strike one, strike two, strike
three. Behind the pitching
prowess of Peterson, the
Huskies managed only three hits
by the end of the seventh inning.
In fact, Peterson was able to
whiff nine Husky batters, giving
him 338 strikeouts over his
career and leapfroggingahead of
major-league hurler Jack
McDowell, Class of '87, for the
top spot on Stanford's all-time
list.
One run in the first on a sacri
fice fly by sophomore third base
man Josh Hochgesang and a solo
home run by Gall in the third
gave the Cardinal an early 2-0
lead for Peterson to protect.
But the starter's seven
innings weren't enough to win
the game outright.
"Pitching seven good innings
is great," Peterson said. "But a
game is nine innings. We've got
to start finishing it off."
Two errors by Card outfield
ers in the eighth inning opened
the door to four Husky runs.

After a leadoff walk by pinch
hitter Pete Orgill, pinch hitter
Ed Erickson hit a pop fly to short
left. Senior left fielder Chris
Clark immediately started to run
in on the ball as junior shortstop
Jay Pecci backtracked. The two
met in short left field while the
ball fell, untouched, in between
them. The error on Clark put
runners on first and second with
none out.
When Washington left fielder
Chris Magruder slapped a high
chopper through the gap
between short and third to drive
in pinch runner Kyle Woods and
cut Stanford's lead to 2-1, Peter
son's day was done.
In came Stanford sophomore
reliever Tony Cogan. Immediate
ly, a sacrifice fly by sophomore
pinch hitter Nick Stefonick
brought in the tying run. A dou
ble by shortstop Kevin Miller
scored another. After a walk to
first baseman Ryan Soules, a
long fly far to right by outfielder
Ryan Williamson was dropped by
junior right fielder Joe Kilburg,
bringing Miller home to increase
the Husky lead to 4-2.
But Stanford battled back and
regained the lead when Hochgesang
lofted a two-out, three-run home
run in the bottom of the eighth to
put the Cardinal ahead 5-4.
The Huskies tied it in the

ninth on left fielder Chris
Magruder's one-out single off
sophomore reliever Jeff Austin
to drive in Kyle Woods. Austin
then gave up a towering Ryan
Lentz home run to deep right
with one out in the 10th, setting
up Schaeffer's game-winning
home run.
"It was a good game," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "A
little tough on the coaches, but a
good game."
"We'd obviously rnther win
10-0," Schaeffer said. "But a
win's a win. We certainly got our
money's worth from Washing
ton."
Before the game, Pac-10 offi
cials announced the selection of
four Stanford players and Mar
quess to Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion honors.
Peterson was voted Six-Pac
Pitcher of the Year for the sec
ond time in his career, lie fin
ished the regular season with
122 strikeouts, good for first
place among league pitchers.
Peterson finished the season
with the best record in Six-Pac
competition at 7-1 and was sec
ond in innings pitched with 120.
Marquess was recognized as
Six-Pac coach of the year for
guiding the Cardinal to its third
Six-Pac title in the 19905. His
career record is 847-449-4 since

he took over uh Stanford's skip
per in 1977.
Stanford starters Gerut and
freshman right fielder/designat
ed hitter Edmund Muth were
both elected to the All-Six-Pac
team.
