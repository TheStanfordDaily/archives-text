# Softball season delivers new hope for next year

With its last game in the bag,
the Stanford softball team is
now looking hack on a season
marked by a series of accom
plishments that give the players
experience and confidence lead
ing into next year.
Among the major highlights
throughout the season were vic
tories over second-ranked
UCLA and eighth-ranked Wash
ington. The team experienced a
huge increase in its power, hit
ting eight home runs, by far the
largest total for a Stanford
team. Perhaps the biggest
accomplishment this season was
that the team finished with a

record better than .500 for the
first time at 31-27-1.
"There were a lot of things I
feel were highlights," said
sophomore pitching standout
Becky Blevins. "The big games
we won, the home runs hit, just
how we came together. Overall,
it was just a really good year for
the team."
Clearly, one of the biggest
disappointments was not mak
ing regionals this year. Despite a
strong finish and a winning
record, the NCAA selection com
mittee didn't include the Card
in its postseason picks. No. 14
Arizona State did make the
field, despite finishing behind
Stanford in the conference
standings, a decision that raised
a few eyebrows.
Stanford had a very competi
tive schedule this season, play
ing against top-25 teams nearly
every week, with three of the top
10 teams playing in the Pacific
10 Conference.
Although the squad was expe
rienced in that many of its play
ers had played as freshmen or
competitively during high
school, the relative inexperience
compared to most other ranked
teams was evident. While at first
the team was unsure of its capa
bilities, by the end of the year it
could battle against the best and
be competitive.
Because of increased confi
dence, the team's expectations
rose, and Stanford will demand
great things from itself next
year.
"One thing that I saw was
that we may have not been ready
for playing so many tough games
away from home early in the sea
son," Blevins said. "I think that
just experiencing it this year will
be a big reason why it shouldn't
happen next year."
Because 90 percent of the
team consisted of freshmen and
sophomores this year, the team
is in great position to start off
strong next year. The team
returns seven of nine starters,
losing only its corners, first

baseman Summer Lee and third
baseman Amanda Renteria, to
graduation. The Card looks to be
strong off the mound with all
three pitchers returning.
"Our team was a close-knit
group that worked really well
together, especially as the sea
son progressed," said head coach
John Rittman. "Our seniors
were a big help, providing stabil
ity and being good sources for
the rest of our players to learn
from."
That the team feels slighted
by the selection committee could
prove to be one of next year's
best motivators.
"In terms of incentive, getting
denied a postseason bid should
be more than enough for our
players," Rittman said. "That
opportunity should make the
team hungry next year and
should provide some real moti
vation for their offseason
effort."
The relationship between a
coach and his players is always a
feeling-out process for both par
ties, and Rittman, being new to the
program, had to get used to his
personnel. The team has meshed
well with its new head coach, and
the two parties should be even
more comfortable and familiar
with each other next year.
"The fact that we had a new
coach come in sort of made it
tough to build on last year, con
sidering it was a whole different
atmosphere," Blevins said. "The
fact that we'll have the same
coach and that we really liked
him will be a big plus next year."
