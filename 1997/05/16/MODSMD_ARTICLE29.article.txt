# Golf Update
## 
### 
After one round at the
NCAA West Regional, the Stan
ford men's golf team sits at the
middle of the pack, tied for
ninth with Fresno State with a
3-over-par 291. No. 4 USC led
the field with a scorching 10-
under par at the par-72 Carlton
Oaks Countiy Club in Santee,
Calif.
Individually, the Card was
led by sophomore Ail-American
Joel Kribel's 2-under 70. Fresh
man Dusty Brett shot even par,
a stroke ahead of senior Conrad
Ray, who finished the day at 73.
Freshman Michael Weimer
chipped in a 76 to round out the
team's score.
Slow greens have kept scores
low and competition close. Five
teams scored below 288 and
nine more are within six
strokes of even par.
