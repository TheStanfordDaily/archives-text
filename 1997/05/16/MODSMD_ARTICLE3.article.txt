# Sports ethics
## Profs, coaches, athletes to talk in day-long symposium at Farm 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
Professors and philosophers will join coaches and
student athletes in a symposium today that aims to ex
amine the relationship between sports and society.
The colloquium, titled " 'If you want to build charac
ter, try something else': Ethics and Sports in 1997 and
Beyond" will touch on a variety of contemporary issues
concerning sports ethics, ranging from contrasting the
public images of basketball stars Michael Jordan and
Dennis Rodman to seeking a new way of looking at ath
letes' bodies.
"Sports and Ethics" will be held at the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; all sessions
are open to the public.
Other issues panelists will address include the differ
ent ethical implications for college sports and profes
sional sports, sports ethics and the responsibilities of
athletes and athletics to spectators.
While Athletic Director Ted Leland, Provost Con
doleezza Rice, Economics Prof. Roger Noll and Philoso
phy Prof. Emeritus Patrick Suppes will represent acad
emic departments a* panelists, men's basketball coach
Mike Montgomery, track assistant coach Robert Weir
and women's gymnastics coach Lisa Izzi will provide
their insight as longtime coaches.
Among the student panelists are Stanford basketball
players Brevin Knight and Kate Starbird and football
player Adam Salena, all seniors, and gymnast Keri
Monahan, a junior.
Elisabeth Bronfen, a professor at Columbia Univer
sity and the University of Zurich and a leading special
ist in gender studies will also participate in the discus
sion. Another guest is Wolfgang Welsch, professor of
philosophy at the University of Magdeburg and an ana
lyst of contemporary culture.
According to French and Italian
Prof. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, who
was approached by the Department
of Athletics with the idea for the
forum, the audience can expect to
hear interesting discussions merg
ing the humanities and sciences
with gender and cultural aspects of
sports.
"There is possibility for amazing
debates to take place," he said.
Adding that the philosophers pre
sent will provide a ground for non

traditional arguments, Gumbrecht
said unlike many panel discussions,
the colloquium will "connect
worlds that are not usually con
nected to each other."
Administrators of many college
departments say sports builds
character "without really knowing
why and how," Gumbrecht said.
"And the Athletics Department at
Stanford is saying, 'Let's see how it
really works. Let's dismiss all the
ready-made answers and start with
uncertainty.'"
Leland, who sees the sympo
sium as a chance for coaches to ex
ercise "intellectual in-service train
ing," said athletics today has moved

from the "militaristic" values the
1960s to a "much more collabora
tive model between the athlete and
coach.
"We're interested in the issue of
character development because it
impinges on everything we do
here," he said. "The last sentence
of the [Athletics] Department's
mission statement notes, 'The in
trinsic value to the participant is
the primary criterion by which the
worth of programs should be
judged.' If we need to justify sport,
it seems to me that the idea that
sports builds character is one of the
only justifications that works in
the long run."
