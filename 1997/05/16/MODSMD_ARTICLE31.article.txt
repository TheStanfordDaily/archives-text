### Jorge Chen Staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
crews are hauling their boats up
to Lake Natomas in Sacramento,
where they will face top crews
such as Washington, California
and Oregon State in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
and the Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships.
"Practices felt, great and since
we've been tapering, everyone is
antsy to go," said senior captain
Bess Kennedy. "This is where we
w»mt to be mentally and physical
ly."
Kennedy's squad will be bat
tling it out this weekend, since
seeds two through five are in a
close fight for the last spot in the
nationals, which is sponsored by
NCAAs for the first time this
year.
Senior varsity co-captain Mark
Thomas is looking for the team to
better its performance and cap
ture the third place spot won by
Oregon State last year.
"I want to go fast, and I want
to beat Oregon State," Thomas
said. "Cal and Washington will be
right there, and we should be 2
seconds within Oregon State one
way or the other."
After a week of solid practice,
head coach Wieslaw Kujda
agreed with Thomas' assess
ment of this weekend's confer
ence showdown.
"I don't know what to say or
think except that I think we will
have the best performance of the
year," Kujda said. "I have good
feelings about this team — a lot
of energy, positive attitude and
focus."
The junior varsity men placed
sixth in last year's finals with the
expectation of improving on that
mark by a large margin.
Coming out with the only Car
dinal victory against rival Califor
nia and a solid dual-racing sea
son, the women's junior varsity is
looking to step up in its perfor
mance this year and qualify for
nationals.
"We are really excited to go out
there and put everything on the
line," said senior Janet Bucher.
"Practices this week went really
well, and we are stepping and

coming together."
Bucher's squad is only five sec
onds behind second and third
place, Washington State and Ore
gon State, respectively.
Last year's Pac-10 Women's
Coach of the Year Aimee Baker
has her sights set on both of her
squads qualifying for nationals
with solid performances this
weekend.
"We have to keep in mind that
we are good since this is the
fastest crew coming out of Stan
ford," Baker said. "And we can
compete with anyone."
The novice squads will have a
lot of racing ahead of them, as
many will be doubling up in races
with the first boats racing Sun
day and the second boats racing
in the PCRCs the day before.
On Sunday, four women
novices from novice 8 will also
have an opportunity to race in the
varsity 4 to qualify for nationals.
"This weekend we will do real
ly well since we are getting faster
and faster in every race," said
freshman Bronwen Coleman, one
of the four racing.
Freshman captain Greg Niko
dem and his crew are confident
that they will bring home a medal
by finishing third cr better this
weekend.
"We've improved steadily
every weekend and we will hit our
peak on Sunday in Sacramento,"
Nikodem said.
The novice second boats will be
doubling up in races tomorrow at
the PCRCs. The men's squad has
made huge improvements to
become the top novice second
boat in the conference.
"I see Davis as our biggest
obstacle, but I'm confident that if
we row a clean race, we'll be able
to row through them," said fresh
man Tosh Heinrich.
After all the year-round train
ing, this weekend is the most cru
cial for the Card.
"The sentence is written and
now we're missing the period,
which this weekend will deter
mine," Kujda said.
Whatever that period happens
to be, all of the Cardinal squads
have improved tremendously
with each race, which will
promise solid performances by
Stanford.
