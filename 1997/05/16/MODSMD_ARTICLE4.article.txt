# Fac Sen approves new CIV program
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
The much-discussed plan to replace the Cultures,
Ideas and Values Program requirement passed the
Faculty Senate unanimously yesterday. It will be par
tially implemented next year and completely in place
by 2000.
The senate approved the measure after a lengthy
discussion. It also heard University President Ger
hard Casper propose several new bodies to integrate
technology into research and teaching and an interim
report from the Planning and Policy Board.
The basic change to the Area One requirement,

now fulfilled by CIV, is that each freshman will take a
large, general first-quarter course taught by a team of
permanent faculty and a subsequent two-quarter se
quence with a more thematic focus.
Several professors who had voiced deep opposition
to the reform in the past months voted for it yester
day, many of them citing changes made by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies to the original pro
posal by the CIV Review Committee.
Some senators did take a last opportunity to air
their reservations.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry introduced a motion,
which failed with substantial sup
port, to delete a passage saying the
first-quarter courses "are con
ceived of primarily as an introduc
tion to humanistic methodologies.
"I don't think there is a
methodology of philosophy," said
Perry, who has in the past ex
pressed a concern that the new
plan unduly emphasizes teaching
about methods of inquiry at the ex
pense of fully considering the texts
themselves.
Another senator who brought
up the question of overemphasiz
ing the humanities as such rather
than emphasizing individual texts
was Classics Prof. Marsh McCall.
The emphasis on methods
rather than texts in the first quar
ter, McCall said, touched on "one
of the deepest divisions among hu
manistic scholars."
The proposal, he said, "is pro
ceeding under one set of humanis
tic principles, but there is a com
peting set. .. . There are a large
number of humanists who say,
'The text is everything.' "
Several professors close to the
new program rallied to its defense.
English Prof. John Bender noted
that the whole reason for the "one
plus two" format for Area One is to
accommodate both points of view
by emphasizing inquiry as such in
the first quarter and textual and
thematic issues the next two.
Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry
Elam, who will head the gover
nance board to oversee the new
program, explained that in the
first quarter "what we want to do
is teach critical thinking."
He added that giving inc -ming
students important intell ctual
tools will increase the relevancy of
the program for scientists unci en
gineers as well as better preparing
students for further study in the
humanities.
McCall did succeed in having a

motion passed to require Elam's
board to give the senate a progress
report on implementation of the
changes in winter or spring quar
ter 1999.
Implementation will begin next
year for part of the incoming fresh
man class. Bender outlined two
first-quarter classes that will be of
fered.
The first has no title yet, but the
four texts considered will be read
ings from the Bible and Confucian
texts, Shakespeare's "King Lear"
and works by Descartes, as well as
some contemporary texts from the
Internet. It will be taught by His
tory Prof. Timothy Lenoir, Eng
lish Prof. Larry Friedlander and
Assoc. Asian Languages Prof.
Haun Saussy.
The second track will be called
"Why Read It." Elam, French and
Italian Prof. Robert Harrison and
Humanities Center Director Keith
Baker will teach Plato's "Sympo
sium," "King Lear," Rousseau's
Second Discourse and Toni Morri
son's "Beloved."
For the second part of the new
program, Bender said options in
cluded a course on the ancient
Mediterranean region taught by
Classics Prof. Lan Morris and a
modified version of the current
Myth and Modernity track given
by the German Studies Depart
ment.
McCall also indicated that he
looked forward to continuing his
participation in the new program
as part of a modified version of the
current Humanities track, which
he teaches.
After the meeting, McCall said
he voted for the new program be
cause he, along with many others,
had "come to the opinion that even
though there are fundamental
parts of the Area One legislation I
have grave doubts about, [the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies] gave a degree of flexibility
that [the review committee)
hadn't."
Specifically, McCall said the
changes would allow him to design

courses that would allow students
a degree of continuity between the
first quarter and the other two and
that such a possibility had not ex
isted under the original proposal.
Before the discussion on CIV,
Casper announced that he would
follow several recommendations of
the Committee on Technology in
Teaching and Learning.
Specifically, he announced that
several new permanent offices will
be set up to oversee the effects of
new technology on several aspects
of University activity.
One of those will be the Stan
ford Learning Lab, which Casper
said would be responsible for of
"research and development of
technology primarily to improve
learning at Stanford."
The lab will be co-chaired by
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Larry Leifer, English Prof. Larry
Friedlander and Assoc. Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. Sheri Shep
pard.
History Prof. David Kennedy
also delivered an interim report
from the Planning and Policy
Board, which he chairs.
He identified three areas in
which the board was trying to
identify and deal with long-term
issues.
The first was research, its fund
ing, relationship to teaching and
the status of research professors.
Kennedy said the board would es
pecially focus on research in the
humanities and social sciences,
which he said had traditionally re
ceived less emphasis than hard sci
ence, and on research at the School
of Medicine.
He also proposed to address the
question of department heads,
noting that a department head
takes office for a short time, is
often little prepared "and conse
quently accomplishes little."
The third issue, he said, was the
development of individual faculty
careers, including retirement ben
efits, compensation and the rela
tive roles of research and teaching
at various career stages.
