# Safe haven to study When it's time to get down to work, Stanford students search out dark and forgotten corners

When senior Aaron Padilla needs to do
some intense studying, he goes to the emer
gency room.
Now don't get the wrong impression —
Padilla doesn't go there because midterms
make his head bleed or coffee causes heart
problems. Nor is he a premedical student;
rather, he's an international relations
major.
Padilla and his friend, senior Greg
Wright, make the occasional trek to the
Stanford Hospital because they've found it
to be an ideal study place.
As much as Stanford students pretend to

hate studying, it's an inevitable fact oflife on
the Farm. People find their niche in all sorts
of places, from the libraries to the secret
holes in campus huildings.
In the case of Padilla and Wright, they've
chosen to find a place separated from other
students — they bring their books and settle
d'<wn in the emergency room cafeteria.
"When the food places are open, the cafe-
U t a is normally a bustling space," Padilla
sat J. "But we go there late at night, when the
place is deserted. We have this big room to
ourselves."
The cafeteria is separated from the rest of
the emergency room, making it as quiet as a
typical hospital lounge — and, according to
Padilla, a perfect place to concentrate on

one's studies.
Wright, an earth systems major, noted
that the Stanford emergency room is quieter
than others.
"I've seen a few people come in, but it's
usually nothing too serious," he said. "It's
not a crowded place where people run in
bleeding."
The fact that the study environment is
within a hospital has had its strange benefits
as well. During one of their evenings at the
emergency room, Wright found that he had a
lot of reading to do and moved to a nearby
lounge to get a little more comfortable. He
fell asleep and later woke up to find that the
nurses had brought him a

blanket.
"It's a novel thing to
do, so it makes studying a
little more interesting,"
Padilla said. "I like telling
people that I'm going down
to the emergency room

because it gives them the
impression that I'm
doing something excit
ing or dangerous. I end
up assuring them that
I'm just going there to
study. It's like a contra

"The emergency room is where we go '
when we really need to blitz on some
studying," Padilla remarked. "When we're
there, we feel more focused because we
know that what we're working on is especial
ly important."
"It takes a while to get there, so you leave
all of the distractions," Wright added.
"When you're actually there, you're in the
mindset to do some heavy studying."
Wright noted that the emergency room
cafeteria has the same good lighting, spa
cious area and 24-hour availability as many
other study areas on campus. 1 le felt, howev

makes it unique.
