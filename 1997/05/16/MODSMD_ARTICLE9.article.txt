## Massacre on first day of Algerian elections 
### 
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Men
armed with knives, hatchets and
pickaxes massacred 30 villagers —
more than half of them children —
in a pre-dawn attack yesterday
aimed at sabotaging Algeria's leg
islative elections. •
The attack in the village of
Chebli, 15 miles south of the capi
tal, came hours before the official
opening of campaigning for the
June 5 vote.
It is the first parliamentary
election in five years, since the
army aborted a ballot to keep the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front from winning. A constitu
tional revision passed last fall ban
ning parties based on Islam
excludes the Front from the new
elections.
No one immediately claimed
responsibility for yesterday's mas
sacre, but security forces called the
killers a "band of criminals," lan
guage used to designate Muslim
insurgents trying to topple the mil
itary-backed government.
Among the dead were 17 chil
dren, two of them babies, and
seven women, according to securi
ty forces quoted by Algerian televi
sion.
Travelers from the rural region
where the attack occurred said 40
men, some on horseback, others on

foot, invaded Chebli about 3 a.m.,
destroying homes in the darkness.
The massacre came three days
after Algiers was rocked by four
bombs that killed eight people and
injured 70, part of the latest wave
of violence marked by village mas
sacres and bombings.
Nearly 400 people died from
such violence during the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan, which
ended Feb. 9. Since May 1, more
than 65 people have been killed. In
all, more than 60,000 people have
died during the insurgency.
Travelers said the attackers
belonged to the Armed Islamic
Group, the most radical faction
fighting the government.
The renewed violence belied
statements by Algerian authorities
who claim that the worst of the
insurgency is past.
Despite the massacre, cam
paigning for the 380 parliamentary
seats went ahead around the coun
try yesterday. Candidates spoke on
television, the radio and at meet
ings, mostly with only passing ref
erence to the attack.
The Salvation Front, whose
leaders are jailed or in exile, wants
voters to either boycott the elec
tion or choose candidates who
want a negotiated solution to the
crisis.
