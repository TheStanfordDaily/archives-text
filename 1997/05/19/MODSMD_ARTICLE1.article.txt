# ASSU endowment marks step toward self-sufficiency
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
It's not ASSU Inc., but it's
close. The ASSU Senate's recent
approval of a bill forming an en
dowment for the association
marked a landmark step toward
the creation of an economically
stable and self-sufficient ASSU.
The proposal, approved by the
senate May 6, takes $2.8 million of
the Stanford Student Enterprises'
retained earnings and places it in
an endowment fund. The payout
on the endowment will provide
funding in perpetuity for the
ASSU's daily operations and the
ASSU president, senate and ser

vice activities, such as the ASSU
Course Guide.
The second part of the proposal
calls for an operating fund that
supports the ASSU's daily opera
tions and basic business project ex
penditures. The money in the op
erating fund comes from the en
dowment's annual payout, the
working capital for business pro
jects and the money in the ASSU's
banking service for student
groups. Money from special and
general fees, as well as funds
raised by student groups, is kept in
the banking fund.
