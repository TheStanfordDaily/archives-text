# ASSU endowment marks step toward self-sufficiency
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
It's not ASSU Inc., but it's
close. The ASSU Senate's recent
approval of a bill forming an en
dowment for the association
marked a landmark step toward
the creation of an economically
stable and self-sufficient ASSU.
The proposal, approved by the
senate May 6, takes $2.8 million of
the Stanford Student Enterprises'
retained earnings and places it in
an endowment fund. The payout
on the endowment will provide
funding in perpetuity for the
ASSU's daily operations and the
ASSU president, senate and ser

vice activities, such as the ASSU
Course Guide.
The second part of the proposal
calls for an operating fund that
supports the ASSU's daily opera
tions and basic business project ex
penditures. The money in the op
erating fund comes from the en
dowment's annual payout, the
working capital for business pro
jects and the money in the ASSU's
banking service for student
groups. Money from special and
general fees, as well as funds
raised by student groups, is kept in
the banking fund.
The endowment and operating


Katie Stokes — Dally
fund can best be compared to
checking and savings accounts,
said the proposal's author, ASSU
Financial Manager John Hall. A
savings account is generally left
alone to accrue interest, while day
to-day expenditures come out of a
checking account.
Similarly, the endowment prin
ciple should never be touched; an
nually, it will make a single payout
to fund the association's opera
tions.
A new charter that accompa
nied the bill establishes SSE as a
corporate subsidiary of the ASSU
operating under a board of seven
to 11 directors, at least four of
which will be students. The non
student members will have experi
ence in business, investment or
the University.
Modifications
The formation of the endow
ment resulted in dividing the
ASSU's financial assets into two
parts: an endowment and an oper
ating fund. The endowment
money will be invested in long
term assets that have high rates of
return. The money in the operat
ing fund will be placed in shorter
term investments so that it is
available for immediate use.
"This is a major financial
change that will help stabilize the
budgeting process," Hall ex
plained. "It will enable the associa
tion's financial commitments to be
better predicted from year to year."
Under the current system, the

ASSU Senate, executive officers
and business projects budget out
of a single monetary source. This
structure has complicated budget
ing, resulting in periodic budget
deficits.

Without clear
delineation of
what money is
available for vari
ous ASSU opera
tions, the senate
has at times over
estimated the
funding that
would be avail
able.

Hall emphasized that the nevv
endowment represents an internal
reorganization and will not result
in any change in the way students
receive ASSU services.
Origins
Although the ideal of a finan
cially independent and stable
ASSU can be traced back to the
early 19705, changes in recent
years have given a greater impetus
to achieving this goal.
As a result of University bud
gets cuts in the early 19905,
$180,000 worth of University
funding for the ASSU has been
eliminated during the past six
years. In 1991, the money received
from the University accounted for
two-thirds of the ASSU's operat
ing budget. For the past two years
the ASSU has received no funding
from the University.
In order to ensure its economic
viability in light of University bud
get cuts, the ASSU has worked to
expand its business projects.
In the past six years, the ASSU
has gone from managing six pro

jects to managing 12. Among the
new projects that have emerged in
this period are the Stanford Direc
tory and Virtual Directory, Tele
flicks, the Stanford Store, Stan
ford Group Discounts and the
Stanford Design Group.
The ASSU has had endow
ments in the past. However, these
were not treated like endowments,
in that their principal was dipped
into, weakening their benefits.
Thus the major achievement
associated with the new bill is that
operations have become financial
ly secure enough that it is no
longer necessary to continue to
dip into the endowment's princi
pal.
Ramifications
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock
is concerned about the ramifica
tions the new structure may have
on the senate's power in budget
ing.
Murdock, who was the sole
member of the senate to vote
against the bill, said, "This is a
pretty major change from what we
are supposed to do.
"It basically removes the over
sight role of the senate. Now a
board for the financial side is au
thorized to make all of these finan
cial decisions."
Hall explained that the senate
essentially agreed to contract out
control over the student enter
prises finances to SSE and its
board of directors. This means
that the senate will not need to be
consulted when changes or addi
tions are made to business pro
jects. For example, if Sunday
Flicks requested additional fund
ing or if a student wanted to create

a new business project, the board
of directors would have the au
thority to approve the change.
"The senate is still responsible
for approving the overall budget
for the operating fund and the as
sociation endowment," Hall em
phasized. The senate also main
tains control over special- and gen
eral-fee funding through its Ap
propriations Committee.
The senate will continue to be
responsible for approving the ap
pointment of the ASSU financial
manager and members of the
board of directors. It will also be
able to control the relative propor
tion of student and non-student
members on the board.
ASSU Senator Maren Norton
disagreed with Murdock, saying
the bill represents a positive
change as it "removed the senate
from oversight of day-to-day mat
ters."
University response
Stanford Management Co.
CEO Laurance Hoagland noted
that the model of separating an en
dowment fund from an operating
fund has been successfully used in
the past.
"This is a pretty time-tested
model, and it makes good sense,"
Hoagland said.
Hall consulted with Hoagland
while developing his plan, which in
part was modeled on the manage
ment company's structure.
Although there has been no of
ficial University response, Direc
tor of University Communications
Terry Shepard said, "The Univer
sity has an interest in the ASSU
being stable and effective, and this
is a step in the right direction."
