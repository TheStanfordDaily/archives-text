# False alarm
## Bookstore evacuated 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
The Bookstore closed for several
hours Friday morning after a
power outage and a suspected fire.
According to Trish Keady, a
marketing manager at the Book
store, electrical power went out in
the Bookstore, the post office and
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center.
Several Bookstore employees
subsequently smelled smoke in
their office areas and activated a
fire alarm.
The building evacuated
smoothly and the Palo Alto Fire

Department arrived on the scene
shortly.
Originating in the main exhaust
fan motor, the smell never resulted
in actual smoke or fire, Bookstore
Facilities Manager Gerhard Rokic
ki said.
It is unclear, he added, whether
the malfunction in the motor
caused the power outage or vice
versa.
The motor was disconnected
and a replacement was due to be in
stalled by the end of the day Friday.
After Rokicki isolated the source
of the smell, the Bookstore opened
for business again shortly after
noon.
