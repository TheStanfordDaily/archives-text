## Brutality marks rebel takeover of Zaire capital 
### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Rebel soldiers sealed
their hold on the capital yesterday with a mix of dis
cipline and brutality, setting up sites for defeated
government troops to turn in weapons — and then
executing some of them in anger.
Thousands of troops from Laurent Kabila's rebel
army fanned out across the city, capturing the river
side palace of ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko
and the fortified military base that protected it.
About 200 people were killed during Saturday's
rebel takeover of Kinshasa, according to Red Cross
spokesman Nick Sommer. Red Cross workers on yes
terday were working their way through the capital's
streets, picking up bodies. It was unclear how many
of the people had been killed resisting rebels and how
many were murdered in revenge attacks.
In the La Cite district, residents danced around
the burnt remains of seven soldiers killed by the
rebels. Witnesses said two of them were still alive
when they were set on fire. Other scalded bodies lay
on the road to the airport.
