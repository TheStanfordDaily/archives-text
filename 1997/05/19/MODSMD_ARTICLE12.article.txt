KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) - Beaten
bloody, prodded by kicks and lashes
with an ammunition belt, the man
closed hie eyes, spread his arms and
cried, "They are going to shoot me."
Seconds later, a rebel Fighter did,
blasting four or five bullets into the
man's back with an AK-47. Face twist
ing, the man fell to his knees in the
dusty back alley then collapsed.
Witnesses said another man was
shot to death in a similar manner yes
terday and a stray bullet killed a boy
looking on.
Accusations of rebel atrocities have
dogged Kabila's forces throughout

their eight-month drive across Zaire.
Kabila has repeatedly denied allega
tions of killings and attacks against
Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.
Rebel fighters entered Kinshasa on
Saturday, ending their sweep across
the vast central African countiy and
ousting dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
Yesterday, they lined up scores of
Mobutu's soldiers at a military camp
in suburban Kinshasa to collect their
weapons and accept their surrender.
Hundreds of residents formed a
taunting, cursing gantlet, venting
years of anger against Zaire's military.
"Thieves!" one man yelled.

Another held out a tin of sardines,
waving it at the grim, ragged soldiers
who once might have swiped it for
themselves.
Suddenly, a group of rebels
appeared, pushing and kicking a tall,
muscular man in jeans. The crowd
cheered as the man was forced inside.
Twenty minutes later, the man
emerged with the left side of his face
battered and blood staining his pants.
His final procession began — the
stumbling man, five rebels toting auto
matic rifles and a jeering crowd.
A kick to the side. Lashes with an
ammunition belt. Shoved by a rifle

butt. The man kept his head down. He
was never identified, but onlookers
claimed ho was a member of Mobutu's
presidential guard.
After 200 yards, rebels shouted for
the crowd to get back, then fired in the
air to drive them away. The procession
turned down a tight alley. Now it was
only the man, the rebels and four jour
nalists.
At tho end of the alley, the captive
was given a final shove forward. All the
rebels backed off but one, standing 3
yards from the man. The journalists
pressed back against a sido wall.
Then the bullets came.
