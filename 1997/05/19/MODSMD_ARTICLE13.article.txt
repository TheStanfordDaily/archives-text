Recent development
has had tremendously
detrimental effect

THERE IS A lot that goes on
at Stanford, and a lot of
what goes on does not direct
ly relate to its primary and most
important role: that of an educa
tional institution. Certainly the
work of individual students and fac
ulty members is considered impor
tant, but sometimes it seems as
though that work is not considered
to be important enough.
The campus has witnessed
another example of that kind of
behavior in the past few days. The
needs and expectations of those
who truly embody what Stanford is
about — academics, research, study
— were made subservient to some
peripheral and far-less-important
entity. And this most recent case of
mistaken priorities was particularly
galling, for it is not even clear who
or what precisely benefited from
this ill-considered move.
Once again, the powers that be
have forsaken the students, faculty
and staff, and for what? It is diffi
cult to image who or what gained
from this unbearable heat wave.
Perhaps there is an exotic
species of flora or fauna at the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
that flourished in the nearly 100-

degree weather Stanford's been
seeing. If that's the case, though,
then the Biology Department
should have either flown the speci
men to a hotter climate or con
structed a hothouse specifically for
this experiment.
Perhaps Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo was conducting some
sort of experiment on how the typi
cal college student responds to
atypical heat. If that's the case,
though, it seems clear that Zimbar
do did not run his sadistic project
past the Human Subjects Panel.
Whatever the rationale is for the
unacceptable heat, that rationale
cannot justify the detrimental influ
ence of the weather on students.
The student who tries to spend
the afternoon in his room studying
soon finds that doing so is impossi
ble, particularly when the room is
on the third floor and faces west
into the setting sun.
The student who wants a good
night's sleep to be well rested for
another attempt at work finds that
doing so is difficult when she is
lying in a pool of her own sweat.
It is apparent that the legitimate
concerns — nay, the rights — of
Stanford's students were complete
ly abridged in this lamentable move
to a high-temperature climate.
The issue would disappear if
Stanford admitted only students
who are impervious to heat. But the
focus must be on making weather
for the students, not students for
the weather.
