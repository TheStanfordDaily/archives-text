## A 						visit from the heavens 
### 
I OUGHT TO start with a disclaimer: I
am from Los Angeles and therefore
am not impressed with celebrities. I
have had my drink spilled by Evander
Holy field at the movies, had my luggage
mixed up with John Singleton's at the
airport, been told to turn on my head
lights by Jay Leno. Celebrities, like traf
fic, are a Los Angeles fact of life.
So it is with some embarrassment that
I write about the swoon I went into when
I heard Tony Kushner is coming to speak
tomorrow. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with him, he is the author of
"Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on
National Themes," a two-part play that,
more than I anything I have either read
or seen recently, makes sense of what it
means to live and die in America. In six
hours, Kushner manages to discuss
AIDS, race relations, America's spiritual
past, the travails of capitalism and the
dawning of the capital-"M" Millenium.
He sprawls, he makes improbable con
nections, he contradicts himself. In
short, he dazzles.
Just about everything that I know of
the world is contained within this play:
hope, failure, fear, love, loss. We have
American writers who describe the "com
plex" in American complexion beautiful
ly: Melville, Ellison, Didion, Faulkner,
Morrison. But no modern poet seems to
understand the ambition and the failure
of America more than Kushner does, the
way politics act and are enacted against

Americans. And certainly no one under
stands it with as much compassion and
empathy as he does.
Compassion is something that is sore
ly lacking from the current dialogue on
AIDS. I am not talking about pity, which
is about as useless as the part of the wel
fare bill that gives enormous amounts of
money to teach abstinence in schools
instead of safe sex education. And I am
certainly not talking about "morality"
and the fact that many people are more
comfortable handing out death sentences
than clean needles.
I am talking about the business of liv
ing with AIDS, if not in your blood, then
in your life. Back when I knew no one
who had AIDS, cocktails were drinks
sipped by women in little black dresses.
Now they are protease inhibitors. To talk
about sex is, by extension, to talk about
AIDS. The disease fills the silence that
lies on the other side of desire.
It would be specious to assume that
sex has ever been uncomplicated. Gener
ations past have had their sexual scares:
other diseases, pregnancy, social stigmas.
Desires remain constant, but circum
stances change. Who would have envi
sioned an era where a sexual rite of pas
sage consists of giving a fake name to a
clinic worker?
In the mix, there is Tony Kushner,
acknowledging our fears, blessing us
with his reassurance. He does not shy
away from the potential deadliness of

sex; one of the characters even tries to
commit suicide by having a random sexu
al encounter with a man he asks to infect
him. Rut Kushner also gives us charac
ters who find themselves because of what
sex means, because of what it means to
dare to love someone in the face of an epi
demic as unlovable as the one we are liv
ing through now.
The German playwright Bertolt
Brecht, one of Kushner's greatest influ
ences, once wrote, "Tn the dark times,
will there also be singing? Yes, there will
be singing. About the dark times." In
Kushner, there is a talismanic kind of
hope: defiant, irrational and sustaining.
The language of "Angels" is more than a
touchstone. It is a navigational tool for a
future which contains both enormous
problems and promise.
At one point in the play, one of the
characters notes, "There are no angels in
America." As is the case with the rest of
the play, he turns out to be wrong. One
of them is coming to visit tomorrow.
When he speaks, listen closely for the
murmur of his wings.

Teri Stein, a senior in modern thought
and literature, would not go to the movies
with Evander Holy field again because he
won't share the armrest and he talks dur
ing the previews.
