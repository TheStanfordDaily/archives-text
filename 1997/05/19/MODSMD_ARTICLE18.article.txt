Tenure appeals must go through proper channels

Reviews of tenure denials
are complex affairs, often raising
sensitive issues of both substance
and procedure under severe constraints
of confident iality. As a result, they often
generate misconceptions about Universi
ty governance. Because I served as act
ing chair of the Anthropology Depart
ment at the time that the department
recommended tenure for Asst. Anthro
pology Prof. Akhil Gupta, I would like to
address some possible misconceptions
implied in Tuesday's Daily.
First, Gupta argues against the
unfairness of bis tenure case being
reconsidered by John Shoven, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
who made the negative tenure decision.

The rule being followed here, however,
comes from the faculty grievance policy,
which is a product of the faculty itself.
That rule specifies that grievances begin
at the level where the decision being
complained about was made. For
instance, if a person wishes to file a
grievance about a decision made by a
department, the grievance begins at the
departmental level. If the person is dis
satisfied with the outcome, be or she can
appeal to higher administrative levels.
So, in Gupta's case, Shoven is simply
carrying out the provisions of the faculty
grievance policy.
The premise for starting the
grievance at the level where the decision
was made is to give t he original decision

maker a chance to take account of the
perspectives offered by the grievant, to
consider any new information that
might have become available since the
decision was made and to reconsider the
decision more broadly. If Gupta is not
satisfied with the outcome of the dean's
reconsideration of his decision, he will be
able to appeal to Provost Condoleezza
Rice and then, if necessary, to the Advi
sory Board and the University president.
Second, the fact that this academic
year also saw a change in the decanal
supervision of the Anthropology Depart
ment might superficially, but wrongly,
suggest some linkage between two very
separate matters. This winter, Rice and
Shoven met with the Anthropology

Department to explain that formal cog
nizance of the depart ment was being
shifted from Stephen Haber, associate
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, to Shoven himself. They made
it clear that this was basically an admin
istrative adjustment in the assignment
of cognizance among the school's deans
and a useful step toward resolving some
of the serious institutional and academic
conflicts in the department. In doing so,
they made quite clear that they contin
ued to have strong faith in I labor's fair
ness.
