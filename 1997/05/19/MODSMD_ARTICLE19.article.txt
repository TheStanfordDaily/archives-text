# Well-rounded students could use a poke from their 'angular' peers
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Wednes
day's editorial, titled "Keep the edges
round." I fundamentally disagree with
the notion that Stanford admits should
be "well-rounded." Hell, I submit that
the term itself is as fuzzy as the cours
es most would associate with "well
roundedness." My high school humani
ties teachers told me that to succeed in
academic circles I had to be well-round
ed. The funny thing is that none of
those people had more than a fleeting
memory of mathematics and certainly
were not up on any of the major revo
lutions in 20th-century physics. Who
were they to tell me that if I didn't
read enough Shakespeare I'd be an
"angular" buffoon?
Let me be clear on this point: I have a
high regard for the multitude of pro
grams students are engaged in at Stan
ford. I do feel it is important to be aware
of the multifaceted world around us, to

understand various modes of thought —
political, economic, historical, mathe
matical — and to engage in various
modes of action like community service,
athletics and the arts. However, the goal
of the admissions process is not to "fill
the freshman ranks with Renaissance
men and women." On the contrary, the
goal should be to fill the ranks with tal
ented individuals, whether their inter
ests are "well-rounded" or "angular,"
individuals whose spirits and abilities
will make Stanford one of the most
vibrant campuses in the world. In
return, part of the role of Stanford is to
allow its students to become Renaissance
thinkers, if they choose, not to presup
pose they already arc.
So should Stanford really "lot the
'angular' math geniuses go to MIT," as
the editorial suggested? Well, having
come from MI T (though unfortunately
not a "genius"), 1 can tell you that there
is a certain amount of angularity but a
lot more roundedness than you'd think.
In fact, 1 believe excluding a certain por
tion of students weakens the Universi
ty's mission to provide you, the student,
with a diverse student body. Some of
vou well-rounders could use a irood nok

ing by acute angles, and some of the
angulars could use the Stanford experi
ence to round out a bit. These are not
and do not have to be mutually exclu
sive.
