# Students discuss the role of campus organizations
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Students met last Friday to
discuss issues facing gender- and
ethnicity-based organizations as
part of a continuing effort to facil
itate dialogue among the some
what segregated campus commu
nities.
The discussion — one of the
Women's Center's weekly Friday
forums — was organized by Sahe
li, Stanford's South Asian
Women's Coalition and involved
about 50 students.
It centered around the ideas of
student organizations as support
groups, that respond to oppres
sion or as vehicles for social
change. Students discussed the
importance of "safe spaces" and
coalition-building in these groups'
efforts to respond to issues such as
racism and sexism.

Greater student involvement
"Is there some truth to the idea
that the only people who will fight
for an issue are those whose inter
ests are at stake?" asked sopho
more Saarika Sharma, who facili
tated the discussion.
Sophomore Justin Dunning ex
plained why he thought white
males didn't form the kinds of or
ganizations many other students
do.
"A lot of times when groups are
formed they're formed in re
sponse to something," Dunning
said. "White males don't really
have (an issue] to bond around —
we don't experience being op
pressed. We don't experience glass
ceilings.
"I go through my life trying to
treat others how I'd like to be
treated, and hopefully, gender and
race don't play into that," Dun
ning said.
But according to sophomore
Meehan Rasch, racism and sexism
ire issues in which everyone has a
role, not just those who are victim
ized.
"As a white person, race affects
me because I live in a racist society
I get treated differently because
.>f the way I look," Rasch said. "It's
not about just my reactions to
being oppressed."
Sophomore Cathy liion agreed
hat such social issues involved
• 'veryone. "I think people who are
not oppressed have power," she
<nid, "and if they use that power
for a gender or racial cause, they
can be effective. Coming together
112 or a cause that doesn't affect you
. makes you involved in it."
Coterminal student Bliss Tem
ple said many non-disabled stu
dents are active in disability is
sues. "If one's going to be an ally,
: omot irnes you've got to say, 'This
is not about me.'
Reaching out
Another main topic centered on

whether the alleged exclusivity of
such organizations fulfills their
purposes on campus.
"Some of the purposes of these
groups are not only to fill the in
ternal need but also to connect
those groups with others who
don't share those commonalities,"
said sophomore Masum Momaya.
Senior Vanessa Frank said the
exclusivity of some groups defeats
their purposes.
"How am I going to be enriched
by a group's presence if I'm not al
lowed in?" she said.
Junior Kalpana Kotagal, how
ever, said these groups were creat
ed more for individual needs than
to draw in the entire Stanford
community.
"We didn't start a group to edu
cate other people; we started it to
create our own space," Kotagal
said. "I think it's important to
have that space that I don't have
to always pull other people into."
Sophomore Jessica Lehman
agreed. "Sometimes we need to
step back, not be learning and just
have that space . . . because some
people need it," she said.
Stepping out of a safe space
Other students questioned the
complacency of Stanford students
in the spaces they create for them

selves.
"It's not just white men, or
white women or men in general,"
Kotagal said. "We're all in posi
tions of privilege here, and we all
should question our complacen
cy."
"Stanford has a reputation for
being apathetic and passive. There
are the few who are involved in po
litical or ethnic organizations, but
there's a huge mass of people who
aren't."
Junior Oren Ahoobim said he
felt Stanford is not a united com
munity.
"I don't really feel like there's a
Stanford community, or if there is,
I'm not part of it. I'm a part of two
or three sub-communities," he
said.
Senior Leslie Hummel agreed.
"Stanford does work as a kind of
centrifuge, spinning and spinning
and everyone separating off into
their own little circles.
"But separate spaces at Stan
ford are not mutually exclusive,"
she added. "Some people find
those separate spaces as safety,
some find them as identity. I think
the best thing we can do is put to
gether allied actions. Allied ac
tions create the politics of this
campus and the strength of the
communities involved."
