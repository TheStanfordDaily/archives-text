Admissions and Financial Aid offices, as
well as current Dean of Admissions
James Montoya and former dean Jean

help us in our selection process.
The deadline for submission of
resumes has now passed. We have
received resumes from candidates all
over the countrv at a broad range of

institutions. In addition to many unso
licited candidates who have applied, a
number were invited to apply.
The committee now plans to identify
five to six candidates to interview. Each
of these candidates will be invited to
come to Stanford at the end of May or
the beginning of June for one or two
days of interviews. As part of the inter
view process, each candidate will give a
public presentation to the Stanford
community describing his or her views
on undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid. After these interviews, the com
mittee will identify two or three final
candidates who will be asked to come
back for a second round of interviews.
These are expected to take place in early
July. The goal is to have a new dean by
early September.
The committee welcomes comments
from the Stanford community regarding
the search. Comments should be direct
ed to the chair of the search committee,
Assoc. Industrial Engineering Prof. Mar
garet Brandeau. She can be reached at
