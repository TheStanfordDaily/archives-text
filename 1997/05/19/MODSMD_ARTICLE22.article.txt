# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Confucious says, 'Good fortunes come in bad writing' 
### 
"Everything will now come your way. 04
24 26 33 40 45"
— My fortune, according
to a recent cookie
THAT FORTUNE STRUCK me as
rather unfortunate. When crack
ing open that crisp Chinese cookie,
I was hopefully expectant of some uplift
ing social tidings or at least some infor
mation about what I'd be doing Tuesday
afternoon. Instead, I received the above
condemnation that "everything" was
now to be my responsibility. Sure, with
"everything" coming my way, I could
start to expect unsolicited paychecks and
perhaps several marriage proposals, but
why should it stop there? What about
"everything" else? Within days, I could be
receiving all the world's prank phone
calls and inhaling all of its second-hand
smoke. This I don't need.
Perhaps the fortune was intended
positively (i.e., everything will now go
my way), but is it really my job as a
restaurant patron to interpret? After

gorging on a whole and hearty Chinese
meal one should expect some moderate
discomfort — but not this kind of anxi
ety. What ever happened to the good old
days of, "You will lead a gifted, happy
and joyful life," or, "Soon, you will
embark on a long journey?"
Fortune cookies are a wonderful thing.
They are for Chinese eateries what "free"
chips and salsa are for Mexican joints,
and they keep middle America coming
back time and again. That's why I hate to
see such a great tradition losing its glim
mer. Far too often I open a fortune cook
ie only to find that it offers commentary
rather than pretty prophecy, and 1 won
der why that is. I don't know who writes
these things, but I'm sure they must take
it seriously. These fortunes are too
important to too many people to be han
dled carelessly. ...
Head writer: All right, boys and girls,
we need to focus. The boss wants these
done yesterday or he's gonna embark all
of us on a long journey, understand? So

let's go, people! Ideas, ideas, ideas! Let's
hear 'em!
Writer No. 1: Sir, here's something a
few of us were drafting up. Joanne?
Writer No. 2: Yes. (Clears throat.)
"Honesty and integrity are your worthi
6st> trflits.
Writer No. 6: ". . . in bed." (Giggles.)
Head writer: Very nice . . . but these are
fortunes. We need to stay future-orient
ed. Let's always remember our time per
spective, people!
Writer No. 8: Besides, my mother-in-law
saw that one down at Cheng Du's on 12th
Street last Thursday — it's been done.
Writer No. 2: Well, what if we tweaked
it a bit? Something like: "Honesty and
integrity will always be your worthiest
trmts "
Writer No. 6: ". . . in bed." (Giggles.)
Writer No. 11: Could someone get Writ
er No. 6 to stop that?
Writer No. 8: I don't see how that's any
different from the first one.
Writer No. 7: And anyway, our clientele
is tired of having their virtues dictated to

them. They want action. "What's going
to happen to me and when? What do I
need to know?" That's what they want.
Head writer: OK, fine, good. We'll come
back to it. Anything else?
Writer No. 1: Yessir. How about this: "In
the eyes of a stranger, you will find love."
Head writer: (Slams down pencil.)
Dammit, Jerry! Didn't you read the demo
graphics report we got from marketing?
Most of our customers are married — the
last thing we need is for Mrs. Chow Mein to
ask Mr. Chow Mein what his fortune says
and — whaddaya know — he announces
right then and there that he's going to
have an affair! Do you think they'll come
back here after that, Jeriy? Do you?!?
Writer No. 1: (Madly shuffling through
his copy.) Uh, well, sir, we could change
it, really .. . uh, "You will find love . . .
you will find love . .
Writer No. 6: "... IN BED!" (Chortles.)
At least that's a way I envision the
process could work.
Speaking of writing, my friend

Michael has a dream of writing a short
story or novella — maybe a screenplay
even — composed entirely of real fortune
cookie fortunes. Right now, he feels he's
still a few hundred fortunes away from
gathering enough lines of dialogue, and
that's assuming all of them are usable.
Some lines, such as, "You have an unusu
al equipment for success. Use it proper
ly," may just be too risque.
What does this add up to? Well, one
thing I've learned from my reflection is
this: Fortune cookie fortunes are not just
meaningless post-Kung Pao chicken
epiphanies. They are a piece of our cul
ture. They speak to our consciousness.
They are a part of life.
A gifted, happy and joyful life.

hired on to a fortune-cookie writing staff,
but he'll keep his resume ready.
