## Card loses Pac-10 title to Huskies Baseball bails in final two games of series, top seed not likely 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Somewhere buried deep in the debris of this
weekend's ugly series at Sunken Diamond,
there were two nationally ranked, respectable
teams battling for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship. But an untrained eye might not
have found them.
This weekend, the No. 5 Cardinal (39-18, 21-
9 Pac-10 South) handed two games and the Pac
-10 title to the No. 23 Washington Huskies (43-
18, 20-4 Pac-10 North) through a bizarre com
bination of shaky defense and even shakier
pitching. The Cardinal lost 13-8 Friday and 12-
9 Saturday.
"We just didn't play well," said sophomore
pitcher Brent Hoard, who started in Friday's
loss. "We pitched poorly and let the game get
away on Friday. Then [in Saturday's game] we
couldn't play defense."
Washington assured itself a place at one of
the eight NCAA regionals. Stanford, the host of

the West Regional, is automatically invited. The
48-team field will be announced today at noon
on ESPN.
The loss to the Huskies this weekend, how
ever, threatens the Cardinal's potential top seed
in the tournament. Now, a second seed is more
likely.
In Friday's game, the Huskies began to dig
Stanford's grave immediately, scoring three
times in the first inning on two home runs to
put them ahead 3-0.
But Stanford was able to fight back, and by
the time freshman designated hitter John (Jail
hit a double in the sixth to bring in sophomore
second baseman Tony Schrnger from first, the
Cardinal was ahead 7-4.
But then the game turned ugly, as the
Huskies destroyed the bottom of the sixth by
scoring a whopping nine runs on just four hits
to take a commanding 13-7 lead.
The deluge began when Husky designated
hitter Bryan Williamson slammed a leadoff dou
ble off Hoard. He scored when, on the next

pitch, Hoard threw the ball past junior catcher
Jon Schaeffer, allowing Williamson to cruise
around third and into home, cutting Stanford's
load to 7-5.
Serious problems began one batter later,
when an 0-2 fastball from Hoard slapped the
forearm of second baseman Chris Whitemarsh.
1 loard then walked catcher Ryan Bundy on four
straight balls.
With runners on first and second with one
out, head coach Mark Marquess elected to let
junior reliever Josh Koons try to finish out the
inning for Hoard.
But Koons (4-3) couldn't find the plate and
dished out four straight balls to center fielder
Jamie Porter to load the bases and four more
to right fielder Chris Magruder, walking in a
run and letting Washington cut further into
Stanford's lead. After just eight pitches — all
balls — Koons' day was done. He was saddled
with the loss.

Assistant coach Dean Stotz vents his frustrations on the umpire in
Friday's loss to Washington.
Sophomore pitcher Cameron
Newton came into the game to stop
the bleeding but fared no better, as
his pitches also mysteriously avoid
ed the plate. He walked the first
batter he faced, forcing home
another run to let the Huskies tie
the game at 7-7. Then he balked,
moving the runners ahead and
forcing another Husky across the
plate, putting Washington ahead 8-
7. With first base now open, short
stop Kevin Miller was intentionally
walked. And just like that — after
two walks and a balk — Newton
headed back into the dugout.
Marquess, now deep into the
bullpen, sent for junior pitcher
Adam Harris. Harris wasn't able to
contain the Huskies either, and his
first pitch was smacked by center
fielder Ryan Soules into right for a
single, scoring two and putting the
Huskies up 10-7. Then Harris gave
up a single to Williamson for anoth
er run. A double to first baseman
Ryan Lentz scored two more to
break the game open for Washing
ton 13-7.
When the inning finally ended
on a grounder to short, four differ
ent Cardinal pitchers had given up
five walks, one hit batsman, four
hits and nine runs.

No one had an explanation for
the sudden souring of the Cardinal
bullpen.
"Everyone is as surprised as I
am," Hoard said.
With the Huskies' win Friday,
the third game became the rubber
match for the Pac-10 Champi
onship between the two teams.
But this time it wasn't the pitch
ing that held the Cardinal back. It
was the defense.
"Defense has been key to our
game," Gall said. "When it goes,
the whole game goes."
Stanford's six errors turned 12
Husky hits into 12 runs, giving
them the victory over the bumbling
Cardinal 12-9.
Washington trailed 9-8 going
into the seventh but rallied for
three runs in the top of the frame
and another in the next inning.
With runners on first and sec
ond and two outs, catcher Jamie
Porter slammed sophomore reliev
er Tony Cogan's next pitch deep
into left and past left fielder Joe
Kilburg for a double. Kilburg recov
ered the ball and hurled it to home
to try to catch the runner streaking
to the plate, but the throw sailed
high and both runs scored.
On Kilburg's throw to home,
Porter had rounded second and
was on his way to third. But catch
er Jon Schaefier's throw to sopho
more third baseman Josh Hochge
sang to catch Porter there was wide

and went into left field, letting
Porter come all the way home.
Porter's hit, combined with Cardi
nal errors, put the Huskies up 11-9.
A home run in the next inning
by first baseman Ryan Soules, his
19th, put the final nail in the coffin
in the Huskies' 12-9 victory.
Despite pitching and defensive
debacles, Gall pointed out that the

Cardinal could always count on the
offense.
"We battled back all weekend,"
he said. "We were never out of it."
He was also quick to look ahead
to next weekend's regional.
"We know that this is it," Gall
said. "We'll come back strong.
Everyone knows what he needs
