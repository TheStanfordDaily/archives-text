## Card loses Pac-10 title to Huskies Baseball bails in final two games of series, top seed not likely 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Somewhere buried deep in the debris of this
weekend's ugly series at Sunken Diamond,
there were two nationally ranked, respectable
teams battling for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship. But an untrained eye might not
have found them.
This weekend, the No. 5 Cardinal (39-18, 21-
9 Pac-10 South) handed two games and the Pac
-10 title to the No. 23 Washington Huskies (43-
18, 20-4 Pac-10 North) through a bizarre com
bination of shaky defense and even shakier
pitching. The Cardinal lost 13-8 Friday and 12-
9 Saturday.
"We just didn't play well," said sophomore
pitcher Brent Hoard, who started in Friday's
loss. "We pitched poorly and let the game get
away on Friday. Then [in Saturday's game] we
couldn't play defense."
Washington assured itself a place at one of
the eight NCAA regionals. Stanford, the host of

the West Regional, is automatically invited. The
48-team field will be announced today at noon
on ESPN.
The loss to the Huskies this weekend, how
ever, threatens the Cardinal's potential top seed
in the tournament. Now, a second seed is more
likely.
In Friday's game, the Huskies began to dig
Stanford's grave immediately, scoring three
times in the first inning on two home runs to
put them ahead 3-0.
But Stanford was able to fight back, and by
the time freshman designated hitter John (Jail
hit a double in the sixth to bring in sophomore
second baseman Tony Schrnger from first, the
Cardinal was ahead 7-4.
But then the game turned ugly, as the
Huskies destroyed the bottom of the sixth by
scoring a whopping nine runs on just four hits
to take a commanding 13-7 lead.
The deluge began when Husky designated
hitter Bryan Williamson slammed a leadoff dou
ble off Hoard. He scored when, on the next

pitch, Hoard threw the ball past junior catcher
Jon Schaeffer, allowing Williamson to cruise
around third and into home, cutting Stanford's
load to 7-5.
Serious problems began one batter later,
when an 0-2 fastball from Hoard slapped the
forearm of second baseman Chris Whitemarsh.
1 loard then walked catcher Ryan Bundy on four
straight balls.
With runners on first and second with one
out, head coach Mark Marquess elected to let
junior reliever Josh Koons try to finish out the
inning for Hoard.
But Koons (4-3) couldn't find the plate and
dished out four straight balls to center fielder
Jamie Porter to load the bases and four more
to right fielder Chris Magruder, walking in a
run and letting Washington cut further into
Stanford's lead. After just eight pitches — all
balls — Koons' day was done. He was saddled
with the loss.
