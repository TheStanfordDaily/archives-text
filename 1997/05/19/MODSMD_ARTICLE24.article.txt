# NCAA MEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
## Tennis blanks Texas 4-0 to advance 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - Stanford
sophomore Ryan Wolters feels
there is something special about
May.
"I can't seem to put my finger
on it," said Wolters, ranked 11th
in the nation. "There is some
thing about the way we compete.
Coach prepares us so we are
always ready for the end of the
year."
They appeared ready this
weekend, as the third-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team rolled
over both 28th-ranked Harvard
and 12th-ranked Texas 4-0 to
advance to the semifinals of the
NCAA Championships at UCLA.
The Cardinal faces Mississippi
today at 2 p.m.

On Saturday, Stanford came
out ready to play, breezing past
Harvard in the doubles. Wolters
and Paul Goldstein, ranked 41st
nationally in doubles, quickly dis
posed of Harvard's 20th-ranked
Thomas Blake and Mitty Arnold
8-3.
The 13th-ranked brother duo
of freshmen Bob and Mike Bryan
took out Kunj Majmudar and
Elliot Weiss 8-6 to clinch the dou
bles point for the Card. Although
it was their first experience in col
legiate postseason play, the
Bryans, from nearby Camarillo,
Calif., were right at home.
"I've played here my whole life
so I feel at home," Bob Bryan said.
"Coach emphasized not looking
past the starting team because
every team here is good."
Stanford appeared strong

across the board, crushing the
Crimson in the singles in straight
sets. In his first dual match play
since a midseason foot injury,
Goldstein crushed Majmudar at
the No. 4 position 6-1, 6-1. Sec
onds later, Wolters finished off
Harvard's Blake, ranked 23rd
nationally, 6-3, 6-4, giving Stan
ford a 3-0 lead.
With only one more victory
needed to clinch the win for the
Cardinal and move into the quar
terfinals, Mike Bryan cruised past
Philip Tseng at the No. 3 position
6-3, 6-1.
Head coach Dick Gould was
pleased with his squad's first day
of play.
"Considering this was our first
match of the month, we played
pretty well," he said. "Harvard's
always tough and the doubles

point was difficult. Once we got
that point, things went smoothly."
Harvard was impressed with
the endless talent of the Cardinal
squad.
"Stanford is marching toward
a national championship and they
were ready to play," said Crimson
coach Dave Fish. "If they bring
100 percent of theirs against 100
percent of ours, they win. They
came to play."
With a victory over the Ivy
League rival, Stanford advanced
to the quarterfinal match yester
day against the winner of the
Kentucky-Texas match. The
Longhorns upset the fifth-ranked
Wildcats 4-1 to move into the
quarterfinals.
While the Cardinal beat the
Longhorns 4-0, the road to the
semifinals for the Card was not as
simple as it appeared. The Bryan
brothers whizzed past Eric Allen
and Jack Bransington in less than
45 minutes, crushing them 8-2,
but the Longhorns answered back
at the No. 1 position, as 17th
ranked Nick Crowell and Paul
Martin defeated Goldstein and
Wolters 8-3.
"They never really gave us a
chance," said Goldstein. "They got
cooking, and we just couldn't seem
to get going. We'll be looking to
step it up tomorrow."
With the doubles tied 1-1, Stan
ford fans looked to the senior
freshman duo of Elliott and
Abrams to clinch the doubles point.
Leading 5-3, the Card answered

the challenge, cruising to an 8-3
victory and a 1-0 lead over I exas.
In the singles, Stanford won
easily at the third and fourth sin
gles positions, as Mike Bryan
knocked off Brasington 6-2, 6-1,
and Goldstein took out 67th
ranked Crowell 6-1, 6-0. Although
Stanford led 3-0, the remaining
four matches were tight battles —
all in three sets, until Wolters
took out 50th-ranked Martin 6-2,
2-6, 6-2.
"I knew they were going to be
tough and never give up,"
Wolters said. "Even though we
were doing well at the time, I
knew it was going to be a tough
match. After the first set, I felt
good, but he hit a couple of good
shots. I missed a couple and he
got the momentum, and it car
ried him through the second set.
But I started out the third set
real well, broke him and that car
ried me to the win. "
