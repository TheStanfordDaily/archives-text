# Goldstein returns after foot injury
##

LOS ANGELES - He's back.
And he did not return quietly, thrashing his
way past his opponents, dropping a mere three
games in two matches.
Stanford men's tennis reached the semifinals
of the NCAA Championship yesterday by ousting
Texas 4-0 but not without the assistance of junior
Paul Goldstein.
The 15th-ranked All-American, who has not
played a dual match since March 8, appears
healthy and ready to take on Mississippi. After
crushing the Longhorns' 67th-ranked Nick Crow
ell 6-1, 6-0, Goldstein is back to his old self.
"I feel good," Goldstein said.
This may be an understatement. The junior
has not dropped a dual match all year, and with
his win yesterday, he increased his winning
streak to 13.
In his first-round match against Harvard on
Saturday, he appeared flawless as well, crushing
Kunj Majmudar 6-1, 6-1.
Prior to his injury, Goldstein played the No. 2
singles position. Since his return, he has played
the No. 4 position under 1 lth-ranked sophomore
Ryan Wolters, as well as freshmen Hob and Mike
Bryan, ranked 25th and 73rd respectively. While
opponents have speculated as to the reasoning
behind Goldstein's placement in the lineup, he
explains it is justified.
"I was hurt for a long time, and Hob and Mike
had to really step it up," Goldstein said. "Since
then, they have both only lost one dual match
apiece, and they have avenged both losses. So
Coach played them up and rightly so."
Regardless of where he plays, the Card is most
happy to see his return to the lineup. Not only
does he provide the Cardinal with more experi
ence on the courts, but his absence forced the
team to cope without that leadership.
Mike Bryan has improved tremendously, bene
fiting from playing tougher opponents since
Goldstein's injury. He enjoyed a 6-3, 6-1 drub
bing of Harvard's Philip Tseng and then a 6-1, 6-
0 pounding of Texas's Jack Brasington while
playing the No. 3 position this weekend.
"Mike really stepped it up when Paul was
hurt," said Wolters.
Now the Card, with its young but experienced
lineup bolstered by the return of Goldstein, is
ready for Mississippi today.
