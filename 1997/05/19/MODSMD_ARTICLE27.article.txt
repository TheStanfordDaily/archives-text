# Men's golf season ends at regionals
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Staff writer 
The men's golf team suffered a
disappointing finish to a fine
turnaround season yesterday, fin
ishing 12th in the NCAA West
Regional to bring its spring win
ning streak to an abrupt halt.
With eyes set on the NCAA
Championships in Chicago, the
Cardinal entered the regional
tournament at Carlton Oaks
Country Club in Santee, Calif.,
feeling good about its prospects.
The regional squad consisted of
sophomore Joel Kribel, senior
Conrad Ray, freshman Dusty
Brett, senior Peter Ligotti and
freshman Michael Weimer. The
tournament employed a standard
three-round, five-scores-count
four format and was attended by
nine of the Pac-10 teams and nine
other teams from the Rocky
Mountain District. Of the 18 com
peting teams, the top nine finish
ers advanced to the NCAA Cham
pionships.
The teams that qualified for the
NCAA Championships wore
UNLV (-17), Arizona State (-14),
USC (-7), Arizona (-1), New Mexi
co (+2), IJCLA (+5), San .lose
State ( + 6), Washington ( + 7) and
Pepperdine (+H). The Cardinal
tied for 12th place with Oregon,
posting scores of 291, 290 and 296
to finish 13 over par.
"There are mixed feelings
about our finish, it being the end
of the season, but we're disap
pointed more than anything,"
Brett Kiiid. "Even up to the third
round, we thought we'd be going
to nationals."
Despite a heartbreaking team
finish, Brett felt positive about his
own play. "I felt like I played pret

ty well in this tournament," he
said. "1 had a rough start and I
wasn't hitting as well as I have
before, but 1 felt like I hung in
there and stayed mentally tough."
Posting scores of 72, 7f> and 71 left
Brett tied for 27th place at 218 and
2-over-par.
With a smashing spring season
under their belt, many team mem
bens difl not feel like they played
up to their potential.
"I don't think any of us played
as well as we could've," said Kri
bel. "Obviously there are teams
like UNLV and ASU that are
stacked; we weren't going to beat
those teams. Hut there are some
other teams (going to NCAAs) that
we feel we could've beaten — we
just didn't play up to our poten
tial."
Kribel offered a mixed review
on his performance.
"I hit the ball really good. I just
didn't score. ... I didn't putt well,
and I made some bad mistakes,"
he said. Individually, Kribel tied
for 19th, posting scores of 70, 7.'s
and 7.'} on the par-72 course to fin
ish with a score of 210, even par.
Ray also tied for 32nd with
three 73s to make 219 and 3-over
par. Ligotti and Weimer finished
Hfith and 90th, respectively.
Standing in ninth place after
the first two rounds, the Cardinal
golfers knew that the third round
would either make them or break
them. Unfortunately, it turned out
to be their worst round.
"We knew it would be that
way," said head coach Wally (lood
win. "We expected to enter the
third day ninth behind four tough
teams from both the I'ac-lOs and
Rocky Mountains, and we knew it

would come down to the last few
holes of the last day — this is
always where the issues are set
tled."
As a golf course, Carlton Oaks
presented obstacles of its own.
"We had a couple holes along
the water, but the fairways weren't

too tight, and a lot of times when
you'd go ofT the fairway you could
still hit the green," Brett said.
Brett had more to say about the
greens. "That part of the country
grows a different kind of grass,
which is slow and bumpy if it's not
cut down," he said. "They hadn't
cut the greens down, and because
the grass was long they rolled
untrue. You could hit a good stroke
on line, and it wouldn't always go
in the hole because of the bumps."

Goodwin also commented on
the wind in the final round.
"Because of the prevailing wind,
which came up about noon, the
team which teed off from the first
hole in the morning was at a dis
tinct disadvantage because they
had to fight the wind all the way
through, especially on crucial holes
such as 17 and 18," he said. "But
that's part of the game."
Brett also addressed the
team's struggle in the third

round as part of the game.
"We just kind of let it slip" in the
third round, Brett said. "It was one
of those days in golf when you
shake your head, learn from it and
go on to the next day."
Although this team will not
compete again until next season,
every day between now and then
will be crucial practice time that
will determine whether that next
day will spell victory or defeat for
the young, hungry Cardinal.
