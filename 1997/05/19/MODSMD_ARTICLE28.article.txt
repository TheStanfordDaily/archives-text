### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
In the wake of Stanford's
ninth NCAA team title, the new
national champions go back to
work this morning in a quest to
seize individual titles in both
singles and doubles.
The Cardinal enters six play
ers into the 64-draw singles
championships and two pairs
into the 32-team doubles compe
tition, with play beginning at 9
a.m. today at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
Stanford senior Katie Schluke
bir received the highest seed of
any Cardinal competitor. She was
seeded second overall in the brack
et between Duke freshman Karin
Miller and Blue Devil sophomore
Vanessa Webb. Schlukebir, with
an overall record this season of 32-
7 and a No. 1 national ranking,
will meet Tennessee's Manisha
Malhotra tomorrow at noon.
Also seeded in the top 10 is
Cardinal freshman Lilia Oster
loh, representing the national
champs as the eighth seed.
Osterloh will face a Pacific 10
Conference foe in the first round,
Arizona State's Stephanie Lans
dorp.
Lansdorp, a junior who com
peted at the No. 2 spot for the
No. 7 Sun Devils, went 0-2
against the Cardinal this season

in dual-match play. On both
occasions, Lansdorp lost in
straight sets, once to senior San
dra De Silva and once to fresh
man Anne Kremer.
On the other hand, Osterloh
is 17-1 on the year as a No. 1
player and won all four of her
postseason matches. Osterloh
and Lansdorp will also play at
noon.
Stanford junior Julie Scott,
who recently captured the Pac
-10 singles crown, will face
another conference opponent,
UCLA freshman Elizabeth
Schimdt. Scott was seeded in the
9-16 group. Scott and Schmidt
met once before this season in an
October tournament, where
Scott outlasted Schmidt in a
three-set match 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
Schmidt also went winless in
the Bruins' two dual matches
against the Cardinal, losing to
both Kremer and Schlukebir in
straight sets. Scott has gone
undefeated in the postseason.
The final two Stanford con
testants will face their Florida
rivals for the second straight
day. De Silva will face freshman
Amanda Basica in the first
round. Basica, who competes at
No. 2 for the runner-up Gators,
was blasted by Kremer in yester
day's final.
One of yesterday's heroes for
the Cardinal, freshman Tervn

Ashley, also will meet a Gator in
the opening round. Ashley faces
Florida senior Divya Merchant,
who lost in the final to De Silva
in the No. 4 match 6-3, 6-0.
Scott, De Silva and Ashley all
compete at noon as well. None of
them has lost in the four match
es Stanford won in the team
tournament.
In doubles, both Cardinal
duos were recognized with top
seedings in the 32-team draw.
Scott and junior Ania Bleszynski
received the No. 2 seed, while
Osterloh and Schlukebir were
named the No. 4 seed.
Florida's top doubles team,
defending NCAA champs Dawn
Buth and Stephanie Nickitas,
are the No. 1 seed.
Bleszynski and Scott (16-4),
the No. 2 team in the nation, will
meet Harvard's Gina Majmudar
and Gabriela Hricko in a 3:30
p.m. match. Schlukebir and
Osterloh (12-1) face Gayleen
McManus and Anita Pearson
from Boise State also at 3:30.
Neither of the Cardinal's oppo
nents is ranked in the top 60 in
the country.
Both Stanford squads have
been out of match play since
mid-April, the last dual-match of
Stanford's regular season
because the Cardinal won all
four of its postseason matches in
singles.
