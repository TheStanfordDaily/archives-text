# Cardinal talent key to upset
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
In the past two seasons, the
Stanford women's tennis pro
gram has lost a total of just
three dual matches. However,
all of those losses came at the
hands of the Florida Gators. In
fact, before yesterday's NCAA
title match, the Gators could
boast of a four-match winning
streak against the Cardinal.
All of this begs an important
question: Why was this time dif
ferent?
Last season, Stanford was on
the losing end of two 5-2 losses
to the No. 1 team from Florida.
The Cardinal advanced to the
finals of both the National Team
Indoor Championships in
February and of the NCAA
Championships in May, only to
lose both times to the Gators.
The trend reappeared this
season as Florida, seeded and
ranked No. 1, defeated an
injury-riddled Stanford squad in
this season's National Team
Indoor Championships by a nar
row 4-3 margin.
This time, however, when the
Cardinal and the Gators met in
the NCAA finals yesterday, No.
2 Stanford emerged victorious,
breaking a 62-match Gator win
streak.
The difference between the
teams that lost to Florida and
the one that did not yesterday,
said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan, is just a lineup which
has that much more talent.
"I think this team is a bit
more talented," Brennan said. "I
can't say that last year's team or
the team before that could have
made more effort because they
gave it everything. I just think
this lineup has more talent."
In the past three seasons, the

Cardinal has not lacked depth.
Annually, Cardinal squads are
virtually unbeatable at No. 5
and No. 6. However, the
increased talent Brennan speaks
of has manifested itself at the
top of the lineup. In the past, the
Cardinal has struggled against
the Gators in the top two singles
spots. In its last three losses to
Florida, Stanford went just 1-5
in the No. 1 and No. 2 singles
matches.
Yesterday, the Cardinal took
both of those matches as fresh
men Lilia Osterloh and Anne
Kremer rolled to straight-set
wins over Florida's Dawn Buth
and Amanda Basica, respective
ly-
Osterloh and Kremer came
up huge throughout the tourna
ment, going a combined 8-0 in
eight straight-set wins. At 17-1
for the season in dual-match
play, Osterloh has enjoyed more
success than the Cardinal has
seen at the top spot in a number
of seasons.
"Lilia is a great player," Bren
nan said. "And she is known as a
big-game player who likes to
play with the money on the line.
She certainly showed up big
[yesterday].
"Anne Kremer has played all
over the world and has all kinds
of international experience, and
she did quite a job today. I
thought she might have played
her best match of the year
today."
Florida head coach Andy
Brandi did not argue.
"Lilia pressures you a lot, and
she doesn't give you any cheap
points. She makes you work for
them. Mentally, you know as her
opponent that you aren't getting
any easy points and that makes
you try to hit better shots and as
a result make more errors. She

has a good knack for producing
from that first ball to closing
that point out."
In addition, the home-court
advantage did not hurt Stan
ford's cause. With Osterloh and
Kremer finishing off their oppo
nents quickly, the crowd was
able to focus their attention on
the matches outside of the sta
dium.
The audience played a large
role in Ashley's third-set come
back in the No. 6 match and
when she finished, hundreds of
Cardinal faithful rallied around
Julie Scott as she brought home
the title for Stanford in the No.
5 match.
"I really think the crowd
enhances my game," Scott said.
"A lot of people don't think the
crowd is an advantage, that it
can hurt you. But I really think
it was an advantage. When they
are out there for every point, it
totally pumps you up. It also
makes you focus more."
Ashley and Scott, who are not
at all used to having large
crowds watching them play, cer
tainly benefited from the atten
tion.
"The crowd was definitely
there for us when we needed it,"
Ashley said.
Ironically, it was Florida who
had the home-court advantage
in last year's final. The champi
onships were held in Tallahas
see, a short drive for the die
hard Gator fans who certainly
played a part in pushing Florida
to victory.
"It's always an advantage
when you have the crowd behind
you," Brandi said. "It allows you
to rally when things aren't look
ing too good. It also creates an
uneasy feeling for the oppo
nents. It makes you feel like
everyone's on top of you."
