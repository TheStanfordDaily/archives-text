# Women's tennis wins NCAA title

### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Cardinal women's tennis team cap
tured Stanford's ninth NCAA team title yesterday by
handing No. 1 Florida its first defeat in 63 consecu
tive dual matches at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um. Stanford has now tied the NCAA record for
championships in a single academic year with five —
for the third time.
Stanford junior Julie Scott clinched the victory
and the NCAA Championship for the Cardinal (30-1)
with an overhead winner in the third set of her No. 5
singles match. The junior co-captain's 6-7 (5-7), 7-5,
6-2 win over sophomore Stephanie Nickitas gave the
Cardinal the 5-1 win in singles.
The title was the first for Stanford since 1991, a
long drought for a program which won its sixth
straight title that year.
"I am really enjoying this one," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "When you win six in a
row like we did before, you are in Never Never Land.
You are just numb. But this team has really come to
gether. It's been difficult to get back here.
"We used to have girls that left here with four
NCAA rings and for the first time last year, we grad
uated some that had none. So these girls were getting
a little jealous and needed some jewelry."
Stanford freshman Teryn Ashley set the stage for
Scott, however, with a miraculous comeback in the
face of a 4-0 deficit in the third set of her No. 6 singles
match.
With the Cardinal leading the Gators 3-1 early in
the match thanks to victories by freshman Lilia Os
terloh at the top spot, freshman Anne Kremer at No.
2 and senior Sandra De Silva at No. 4, the focus
turned to the back singles matches. There Scott was
knotted in a tight second set with Nickitas, and Ash
ley had a mountain to climb in the decisive set of her
No. 6 match against Florida freshman Traci Green.
The freshman battled back, however, and by the
time Scott earned a split by breaking Nickitas to take
the second set, Ashley (20-0) had strung together six
straight games for a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 triumph. Ashley's
win put the Cardinal ahead 4-1 with Scott's match
left.
"When 1 was down 4-1, I got really pumped up,"
Ashley said. "I decided that I wasn't going to lose the
match, and from then on, I was really fired up. I
knew that if I played my game, 1 would come out on
top."
Scott (29-1) began to pull away from Nickitas
early in the third set as she broke serve in the second
game to go up 2-0. The Gator sophomore, who
earned an NCAA title last year in doubles, fought off
two match points in the final game but was forced to
go to the lob on another. With the crowd buzzing and
the rest of the Cardinal ready to charge the court,
Scott put the Florida season, win streak and reign as
defending champions to rest with the slam.
"That overhead gave me he best feeling of my
tennis career," Scott said. "In the second set, 1 was
nervous because I had no idea what the overall
match score was. But when we broke after I spilt
sets, I found out the score. I wasn't that nervous in
the third set because I knew that even if I lost, we
would be up 4-2 and I had confidence in my team
mates to win in it doubles. So 1 just went out there
and played."
Brennan said Scott was ideal for the situation.
"Julie Scott is the one we want out there on that
court," Brennan said. "She has won huge matches
for us. She's our warrior and she loves to compete."
Although the Gators (31-1) had not lost a match

since 1995, Stanford had enter
tained the idea that the match
could be won in singles.
"We didn't talk about it,"
Brennan said. "And you have to
prepare for doubles and all that,
but I thought there was a
chance looking at the lineup. I
thought we were the favorite at
each and every spot."
The Cardinal earned its first
point of the afternoon in the No.
2 singles match when Kremer
dominated freshman Amanda
Basica for a straight-set win 6-1,
6-2. Kremer (25-2), the No. 26
player in the country, broke No.
15 Basica early in both sets and
never looked back.
No. 13 Osterloh followed suit
soon thereafter with a straight
set win of her own over junior

Dawn Buth. The first set was
tight until Osterloh (17-1) broke
serve to go up 4-2. After taking
the first set, Osterloh went on to
wear out No. 6 Buth 6-3, 6-1.
Stanford senior Sandra De
Silva then gave Stanford a 3-0
lead with a convincing win at
the No. 4 spot. De Silva (25-4)
jumped out to a 5-0 lead on
Divya Merchant. The Gators'
lone senior fought back to win
three games off De Silva, but the
veteran shut the door on Mer
chant for a 6-3, 6-0 victory.
Florida earned its only victo
ry of the day at the No. 3 singles
spot. Stanford senior co-captain
Katie Schlukebir (18-7) got off
to a slow start against Gator
freshman M.C. White and could
not manage to recover, losing in
straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
At 3-1, the attention turned
to courts No. 5 and No. 6, where
two Stanford wins made doubles
play unnecessary and began the
celebration.

"To win a championship you
have to be good and you have to
be tough," Brennan said. "This
team is good; I will give them
that.
But you cannot underesti
mate the size of their hearts.
Under pressure, great players
lift their game, and those last
two matches down there were
great."
The triumph avenged a
February loss to the Gators, the
Cardinal's only setback of the
season, and broke a four-match
losing streak to the defending
champs. Florida earned a 4-3
win over Stanford in the finals
of this year's National Team
Indoor Championships. Oster
loh did not compete in that
match due to injury.
"I felt like we could beat
them" with Osterloh, Florida
head coach Andy Brandi said. "I
knew what had to be done in
order to win, but it wasn't up to
me to get it done.

"The young ladies on the
Florida team fought very hard
and competed well, but they
came up short and didn't have
the ability to close it out when
they needed to."
Florida also defeated Stan
ford in the finals of last season's
NCAAs 5-2.
The Cardinal reached the
finals by defeating Duke 5-1 in
the semifinals, William and
Mary 6-0 in the quarterfinals
and Wisconsin 5-0 in the first
round.
The third-ranked Blue Devils
could muster no more than one
match on the Cardinal as well.
At the top of the lineup Satur
day, Stanford took care of two
top-10 singles players, sopho
more Vanessa Webb and fresh
man Karin Miller.
Osterloh and Kremer, who
both went undefeated in the run
for the championship, won their
respective matches with Webb
and Miller in straight-set fash

ion.
Oster

loh beat
Webb 6-2, 6-4,

and Kremer topped
Miller 6-4, 6-4. At No. 3

singles, Duke earned

De Silva and
Ashley were on
