The No. 2 Cardinal women's tennis team cap
tured Stanford's ninth NCAA team title yesterday by
handing No. 1 Florida its first defeat in 63 consecu
tive dual matches at the Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um. Stanford has now tied the NCAA record for
championships in a single academic year with five â€”
for the third time.
Stanford junior Julie Scott clinched the victory
and the NCAA Championship for the Cardinal (30-1)
with an overhead winner in the third set of her No. 5
singles match. The junior co-captain's 6-7 (5-7), 7-5,
6-2 win over sophomore Stephanie Nickitas gave the
Cardinal the 5-1 win in singles.
The title was the first for Stanford since 1991, a
long drought for a program which won its sixth
straight title that year.
"I am really enjoying this one," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "When you win six in a
row like we did before, you are in Never Never Land.
You are just numb. But this team has really come to
gether. It's been difficult to get back here.
"We used to have girls that left here with four
NCAA rings and for the first time last year, we grad
uated some that had none. So these girls were getting
a little jealous and needed some jewelry."
Stanford freshman Teryn Ashley set the stage for
Scott, however, with a miraculous comeback in the
face of a 4-0 deficit in the third set of her No. 6 singles
match.
With the Cardinal leading the Gators 3-1 early in
the match thanks to victories by freshman Lilia Os
terloh at the top spot, freshman Anne Kremer at No.
2 and senior Sandra De Silva at No. 4, the focus
turned to the back singles matches. There Scott was
knotted in a tight second set with Nickitas, and Ash
ley had a mountain to climb in the decisive set of her
No. 6 match against Florida freshman Traci Green.
The freshman battled back, however, and by the
time Scott earned a split by breaking Nickitas to take
the second set, Ashley (20-0) had strung together six
straight games for a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 triumph. Ashley's
win put the Cardinal ahead 4-1 with Scott's match
left.
"When 1 was down 4-1, I got really pumped up,"
Ashley said. "I decided that I wasn't going to lose the
match, and from then on, I was really fired up. I
knew that if I played my game, 1 would come out on
top."
Scott (29-1) began to pull away from Nickitas
early in the third set as she broke serve in the second
game to go up 2-0. The Gator sophomore, who
earned an NCAA title last year in doubles, fought off
two match points in the final game but was forced to
go to the lob on another. With the crowd buzzing and
the rest of the Cardinal ready to charge the court,
Scott put the Florida season, win streak and reign as
defending champions to rest with the slam.
"That overhead gave me he best feeling of my
tennis career," Scott said. "In the second set, 1 was
nervous because I had no idea what the overall
match score was. But when we broke after I spilt
sets, I found out the score. I wasn't that nervous in
the third set because I knew that even if I lost, we
would be up 4-2 and I had confidence in my team
mates to win in it doubles. So 1 just went out there
and played."
Brennan said Scott was ideal for the situation.
"Julie Scott is the one we want out there on that
court," Brennan said. "She has won huge matches
for us. She's our warrior and she loves to compete."
