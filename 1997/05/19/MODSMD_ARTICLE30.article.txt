## Daily wallops Knight Fellows behind unassisted triple play 
### Jimmy Boegle Softball manager 
In a rout of unparalleled magnitude featuring
an unassisted triple play, The Daily Penguins
beat a multinational Knight Fellows team 10-2
yesterday in 154-degree weather at Roble Field.
"The weather was actually hotter than my
101-degree temperature," said Daily short field
er Jeremy Stone.
The most bizarre play came when Daily
shortstop Cordy Crockett turned an unassisted
triple play on a line drive in the fourth.
"I have produced newspapers at Haus Mitt,
but I have never seen anything like that," said

Daily center fielder Elizabeth Goldman.
The Knight Fellows took a one-run lead in
the first but saw their lead evaporate as the
Penguins played powerball behind home runs
by Brian Singer and winning pitcher Bill Cory.
"He hit that thing hard," said outfielder Beth
Berselli. "I just wish Steve Young were here."
Tragedy was narrowly averted when Daily
catcher Kristie Lilje bowled over the Knight Fel
lows' third baseman, who was only about 7
years old. Both benches cleared, but order was
restored without any punches being thrown.
"That's a side of Kristie I have never seen
before," said Daily outfielder Carolyn Sleeth.
"She's gotten out of hand at happy hours

before, but nothing like that."
Behind the contributions of third baseman
Sam Mankiewicz, second baseman Corey Fug
man, outfielder Jason Chen and outfielder Dar
ryl the Distribution Guy, The Daily built a com
manding lead. However, after a runner reached
base in the final frame, Ed Guzman came on to
get the save, just before The Daily's Tomoeh
Murakami showed up, almost two hours late.
"Wow!" Guzman exclaimed. "First my driv
er's license, now this."
The win broke a one-game losing streak to
the Knight Fellows, who beat The Daily in a
heartbreaker last year. The Daily thanks them
for the refreshments and continued support.
