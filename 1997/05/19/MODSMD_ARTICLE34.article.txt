### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
Maybe starting your freshman papers at 11:30
the night before they're due isn't such a good idea
after all.
The recipients of the 1997 Boothe Prize for Ex
cellence in Writing — an award granted to the best
papers each quarter from the Cultures, Ideas and
Values and Writing and Critical Thinking programs
were recognized in a ceremony last week at the
Faculty Club.
The annual award was given to five students, and
there were six honorable mentions.
The Boothe Prize winners were senior Renee
Fox, sophomore Selena Kyle and freshmen Alice
Ohgi, Kim Young and Richard Tan. Sophomores
Colleen Bazdarich and Adrienne Watt and freshmen
Christina McCarroll, Sumit Khedekar, Connie
Chang and Kathryn Ritter received honorable men
tions.
At the reception, the awards were handed out by
Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for undergraduate ed
ucation; History Prof. Paul Seaver, director of the
CIV program; and English Prof. Ron Rebholz, direc
tor of Writing and Critical Thinking.
"Having read all of the submissions, I must say
that this is a very strong group," Rebholz said, "and
I hope that this indicates the level of writing talent
here at Stanford."
The prize includes a copy of the Riverside Shake
speare collection, an award certificate and a cash

award of $350. Students receiving an honorable
mention received the book.
This year the award-winning essays covered a
wide range of topics, including English, history, an
thropology and photography in several different
CIV tracks.
"The entries are always very good," Seaver said,
"and no CIV track makes a sweep every time."
Rebholz agreed, saying this diverse group of "top
notch writers" all share the ability "to write clear
and persuasive prose, which is perhaps the most im
portant skill one can learn here at Stanford."
Fox received the award for her CIV essay, "Three
and Four: A Struggle For Identity," which discussed
the importance and symbolism of the numbers three
and four in Toni Morrison's "Beloved."
"I was really excited," Fox said. "I'm an Elnglish
major and writing is very important to me, so it was
very good to be recognized."
Tan received an award for his freshman English
essay titled, "From Sentimentality to Symbolism:
The Photography of Andre Kertesz," which traces
the development of the Hungarian photojournalist
from his early sentimental style to his later mod
ernist works "in which the sentimentality is more
internalized."
The Boothe Prize, first awarded in 1983, was es
tablished by the late D. Power Boothe Jr., who grad
uated from Stanford in 1931. According to Seaver,
Boothe, an engineer, recognized the value of hu
manities and writing at Stanford and wanted to en
courage students in these fields.
