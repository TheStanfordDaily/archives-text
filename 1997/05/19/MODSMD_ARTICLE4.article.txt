A gathering at Bechtel Inter
national Center Saturday
marked the 17th Annual Inter
national Festival, a celebration
of cultural and national her
itage.
Located on the grass behind
the center, the festival was a
five-hour event featuring food,
music, crafts and live perfor
mances by different internation
al student groups.
Coordinator of the festival
and international student ser
vices administrator at the Bech
tel Center Lynn Kroner said she
was glad the center was able to
host the event.
"The festival is a good oppor
tunity for international stu
dents to share experiences with
American students," Kroner
said. "Also, a lot of the commu
nity members from off campus
have a chance to meet interna
tional students."
Each year Kroner, along with
Bechtel Center Director John
Pearson and Rolando Villalobos,

the assistant director and for
eign student advisor, contact the
various cultural groups on cam
pus, encouraging them to partic
ipate in the festival, Kroner said.
This year, the Indonesian
Student Association, the Orga
nization of Arab-American Stu

dents in Stanford and the Turk
ish Student Association were
among the groups represented.
Despite the record-setting
heat, live dancers from various
groups performed throughout
