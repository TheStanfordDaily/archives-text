the afternoon, dressed in authen
tic costumes, while vendors, some
not affiliated with Stanford, sold
jewelry, beads and fragrances.
Members of the cultural groups
sold food from tents.
In addition to raising cultural
awareness, the festival was a good
opportunity for the groups to
raise money by selling ethnic
food, Kroner said.
The Indonesian stand offered
egg rolls called lumpia, along with
a tropical "Paradise Drink." Lah

majun, made of beef, tomatoes,
parsley and spices, was sold as an
Armenian pizza. The Belgian
stand sold waffles.
Senior Peter Lagerquist, a
Swede who grew up in the Middle
East, said he thought the food was
good.
"The event is a good ice-break
er," Lagerquist said. "It's a good
way to get people interested in the
rest of the world. It's a pity we don't
have these events more often."
Sophomore Aaron Aslanian, a
member of the Armenian Stu
dents Association, said he enjoyed
the day's festivities, trying differ
ent foods and watching the per
formers.

"It's really cool," Aslanian
said.
Senior Wael Diab, the former
president of the Organization of
Arab-American Students in Stan
ford, said he thought the festival
did a good job of increasingcultur
al awareness.
"The International Festival
breaks down the stereotypes peo
ple may have of certain groups,"
Diab said. "There's more to Arabs
than what's printed in the press.
Also, this event emphasizes the
diversity of cultures."
Sophomore Bandar Antabi,
also a member of the Arab-Ameri
can group, said the festival pro
vided a good opportunity to meet

international students.
"It's nice to see interactions be
tween international students and
American students. It's a good so
cial event," Antabi said.
Another group represented at
the festival was the International
Undergraduate Community.
Formed two years ago, it prides it
self on being the only "all-encom
passing international group on
campus," senior Erika Marin-Spi
otta said.
"Our goal is to be a support
network for undergraduates,"
Marin-Spiotta said. "We share
common experiences in that we're
all undergraduates and in that we
come from all over."
