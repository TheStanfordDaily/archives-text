how Malcolm Little l>ecame Malcolm X.
To commemorate this civil rights leader's birthday
72 years ago today — Kwame Yao Anku, a 1994
graduate in African and Afro-American studies, has

put together a multimedia presenta
tion that will take place Wednesday at
7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Sponsored by the Mack Student
1 Jnion, the event will be a "music con
cert, movie, history lesson, rap ses
sion and spiritual experience" all in
one, Anku said.
Anku sees Ibis presentation as "a
means of explaining Malcolm X's
complexities because he's just so

much more sophisticated" than the popular concep


Anku
tion of him.
As Anku has found, the generic
version of Malcolm X is that he was
a cri mina 1 who became t he leader of
the Nation of Islam and hated
white people.
For instance, when speaking to
a section in the Cultures, Ideas and
Values Program a few years ago,
Anku asked the students to say a
few words (hat they thought de
cribed the man who took up the
urname X in rejection of a slave
iinster'ndosignation. "Racist," "vi
olent" mikl "irrational" were some
I' I lie adjectives the students
named.
Alter listening to a few clips of
lalcolm X's speeches, however,
i heir impressions changed.
"'He's bad,' 'He's evil,' 'He
liatos white people' — whatever,"
hanged to " 'He sounded very ra
in 11ml 01 'He made sense,' " said
Anku
Milt Anku made clear that he

didn't tell these students to change
their minds or what to think —
they had decided for themselves.
Likewise, one of his goals for this
Wednesday night is to have the au
dience judge Malcolm X on its own.
Anku hopes to accomplish this
by creating a dialogue that will
bring people to their own personal
judgments of the man who said, "If
you want to be a leader, don't ever
accept an image created by some
one else."
"I don't like to say, This is how
it is,' " Anku said.
Instead, Anku takes a "let's look
at it together" approach in order to
"create a shared meaning."
Although he doesn't want to dic
tate the audience's thoughts, Anku
has his own clear opinion of Mal
colm X, who "embodied an inde
pendent thinker," he said.
Calling him "a visionary — a
person who sees things, thinks
things and introduces things that
are ahead of the time," Anku be
lieves that Malcolm X's message is
important and relevant today be
cause he was so forward-looking.
For example, Malcolm X was

one of the first people to call for
usage of the term "human rights"
as opposed to "civil rights."
"He was already thinking glob
ally," Anku said.
Callingthe United States itself a
criminal, Malcolm X declared, "You
don't take your case to the criminal,
I Uncle Sam).. .. You take Uncle
Sam to the world court in the IJ.N."
In addition to the message Mal
colm X had for the world, the ex-
Black Nationalist also has a per
sonal meaning for Anku.
Rejecting the term "hero,"
Anku instead chooses to call him
"an inspirational force."
Anku hopes people will come
away with a more complete that
and accurate image of this man
whom Anku said is often misrepre
sented — through the melange of
media he will present on Wednes
day night.
Malcolm X Day 1997 is free for
students and costs $5 for general
admission. Tickets can be pur
chased through the Stanford Tick
et Office and at other BASS ticket
outlets.
