Ugliness is in the eye of the beholder
The proud distinction of being the ugliest man on
campus now belongs to freshman Daniel Kramer,
winner of the second annual Ugly Man on Campus
competition.
The light-hearted contest attracted 24 candidates
this year, including 17 nominated by their dormito
ries and three women.
Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed service fraternity on
campus, sponsored the event.

"It's actually done at some other campuses," fra
ternity member Evan Chan said, explaining how t hey
got the idea.
Last Monday, candidates participated in an "ugly
pageant" in White Plaza, where each had the oppor
tunity to explain the meaning of ugly and make his or
her case for who was ugliest. Anyone who wanted to
could vote throughout the week in White I'lnza by
putting money injurs (breach contestant.
Kramer had his body painted and walked around
in shorts for the pageant.
"I think there's much to be said
for [doing that]. ... It keeps you
humble," he said. He and his
friends also posted fliers through
out the campus to promote his
candidacy.
Kramer's efforts helped him
raise more than $300; about half
of it came from the West Lagunita
dorms that nominated him. Asst.
Math Prof. Ben Andrews, whose
campaign raised $77, was the top
earner among those who did not
have dorm support.
Overall, the contest raised
about $1,400 for Inn Vision of
Santa Clara, a charity that pro
vides job training and other ser
vices to more than 9,000 homeless
people annually.
"We're very happy with the re
sults," Chan said. "They really ex
ceeded our expectations."
"I think we got the campus
more aware this year," sophomore
Vivian Truongsaid. Last year, the
event raised about $1,200, with

the proceeds going to the Chil
dren's Make-a-Wish Foundation.
The choice of charity is related to
the fraternity's theme, which this
year is hunger and homelessness.
Chan expressed surprise at the
extent of homelessness in Santa
Clara County, the heart of what is
an otherwise wealthy-looking Sili
con Valley.
"It's definitely a lot more
prominent than most people
think. There are a lot of hidden
problems," he said.
Fraternity members started
the contest three years ago. Mem
bers of Alpha Phi Omega also
serve food to the homeless twice a
week and participate in events
such as the American Heart Asso
ciation's telethon and the Bay to
Breakers Race.
In addition to the proud title of
Ugly Man on Campus, Kramer
will also receive prizes. "He gets a
choice of either a pizza party for 30
from Pizza Chicago or some
smoothies from Juice Central,"
Chan said. Kramer will also re
ceive other gifts, such as Star
bucks Coffee.
Kramer's dormmates have had

mixed reactions so far to „heir
friend's unusual honor, Kramer
said.
"Some say they're happy for
me; some say they're sad for me,"
Kramer said.
The last-place finisher, the
prettiest of the otherwise ugly
group, was Justin Jones, who
raised $1.54.
