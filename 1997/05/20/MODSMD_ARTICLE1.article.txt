# BP exec lauds solar power
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
John Browne, the CEO of
British Petroleum, called for ac
tion on global warming and an
nounced a new initiative on solar
power at a speech yesterday in
Frost Amphitheater.
Speaking from a stage filled
with shrubbery, Browne said there
is "an effective consensus among
the world's leading scientists ...
that there is a discernible human
influence on the climate and a link
between the concentration of car
bon dioxide and the increase in
temperature."
He said "large elements of un
certainty" about the specifics of
global warming should not deter
action on the possibility.
"The time to consider the policy
dimensions of climate change is
not when the link between green
house gases and climate change is
conclusively proven but when the
possibility cannot be discounted
and is taken seriously by the soci
ety of which we are a part,"
Browne said.
He mentioned several ways that
BP would actively involve itself in
finding solutions to climate change
problems. Among other things, he
set a target within the next 10
years to make solar power a cost-ef
ficient method of generating power
for peak demand periods.
According to Browne, BP now
represents 10 percent of the world
market in solar power and hopes to
increase its total sales by a factor of
10, to $1 billion, in the next 10
years.
He announced specifically that

BP is planning to open its first U.S.
manufacturing plant for solar cells
in Fairfield, Calif., before the end
of the year.
He stressed that BP historically
has been prepared to make the sort
of investments necessary 10 make
solar power commercially viable
and, in the longer term, profitable.
During a question-and-answer
session after the meeting, Browne
said solar power would not be a
major part of BP's profits in the
foreseeable future, but it showed
distinct possibilities of eventually
becoming so.
"If we didn't think [solar
power] had a future as a business,
we wouldn't be in it," Browne said.
In addition to the profit poten
tial, Browne repeatedly mentioned
"corporate responsibility."
"We're not separate from the
world; it's our world as well,"
Browne said, also noting that "as
businessmen, when our customers
are concerned, we'd better take no
tice."
He said the direct impact BP
could have on overall carbon diox
ide emissions from fossil fuel prod
ucts was somewhat limited be
cause all of BP's operations and
the consumption of all of its prod
ucts account for only 1 percent of
all carbon emissions coming from
human activity.
"As a company, our contribu
tion is small, and our actions alone
could not resolve the problem. But
that does not mean we should do
nothing," Browne said.
In addition to reducing emis
sions from BP's own operations,
Browne mentioned several part
nerships BP had formed with gov
ernmental, nonprofit and academ
ic organizations to support further
research into causes and effects of
global warming and the technolo
gy that can offset it.
He said such knowledge and
technology "is not proprietary and
we will share our expertise openly
and freely."
Browne put such transfers of
technology under the heading of

"joint implementation," which
he said generally means "pro
jects which bring different par
ties together to limit and reduce
net emissions of greenhouse
gases."
He also widened the concept to
include programs of reforestation
BP is undertaking in Turkey and
Bolivia.
He concluded his talk by link
ing the ideas of corporate responsi
bility with the objective of finding
"market-based solutions" to the
public policy problems surround
ing global warming.
"The cultures of politics and of
science and of enterprise must

work together if we are to match
and master the challenges we
face," Browne said.
As far as what that means for
Stanford students, Browne, vvho
graduated from the Graduate
School of Business in 1981, said he
hoped students would become a
part of the changes he proposed by
joining the efforts of industry.
Speaking to The Daily after his
address, Browne said his hope was
that many of the Stanford stu
dents who now go into consulting
and banking would look at jobs in
industry where "people can make
a difference, a good difference to
the world."
