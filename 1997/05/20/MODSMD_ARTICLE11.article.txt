# Senate-elect picks Freund to chair
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
Meeting for the first time, the
ASSU Senate-elect chose sopho
more Joe Freund as its chair for
the 1997-98 school year.
Freund is the current senate's
deputy chair and served as a sen
ate associate last year. He was not
elected to next year's senate, how
ever.
"I was to be on the ballot," Fre
und explained to the 22 senators
who attended last night's meet
ing, "but I asked to be taken off be
cause I wanted to be chair."
Freund said he believes that a
senate chair should be unbiased
and not participate in debate.
"If I was able to use my pres
ence to vote or to end meetings
prematurely, I might have the
temptation to do so," he offered,
alluding to the conduct of the last
three chairs.
In discussing his "philosophy
of chairing" Freund said he be
lieved that the ASSU Constitution
and Bylaws should be followed ab
solutely but that "the rules of
order and Robert's Rules should
be followed when they're conve
nient."
Some senators-elect, however,
questioned Freund's ability to run
for chair, stating that some sec
tions of the bylaws mandate an
elected senator serve as chair.

The constitution is ambiguous
on that point, and the bylaws con
tradict themselves, the senate
concluded, approving Freund.
To win his seat, Freund beat
out ASSU Senator-elect Michael
Slemmer, a master's student in
computer science and the author
of the constitution.
The competition was light
hearted, though, with Slemmer
threatening fits of rage and an
tipathy if elected chair while en
couraging senators-elect to vote
for Freund.
Before the meeting began, cur
rent ASSU Senate Chair Don
Aingworth conducted parliamen
tary training and the chairs of the
senate's standing committees
spoke briefly, describing their
committees and what they accom
plished this year.
The new senate will hold its first
official meeting next Tuesday.
Tonight, the current senate
will meet for the last time to ap
prove next year's budget, com
plete the certification of the
Spring Quarter General Election,
approve spring quarter and annu
al fee requests, vote on former
ASSU President Bill Shen's final
Constitutional Council nominees,
approve the Nominations Com
mission's recommendations and
complete its year-long review of
the bylaws before relinquishing
power.
