## Rebels reject calls for election Kabila's victorious movement says Zaire not ready for ballot 
### 
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Zaire's new leaders
yesterday rejected Western calls for quick elec
tions, while soldiers loyal to the deposed president
surrendered in humiliation — some forced to their
knees by taunting crowds.
Residents gathered at military barracks of the
former government to vent animosity that built
during Mobutu Sese Seko's repressive 32 years of
ruling — and plundering — Zaire.
"You took our jewels," spat Marie-Claire Kaba
ta, her body heaving and feet stamping. "I've just
today worn my jewels. I couldn't before. You took
our jewels, stole our money, robbed our homes.
There was nowhere to go. We couldn't go to the
store. We couldn't go out."
Her voice drowned in the cacophony of curses
and taunts from others beside her. Rebels kicked or
slapped soldiers who reacted to the torrent of
abuse, drawing wild cheers.
Thousands of Mobutu's soldiers have sworn
allegiance to Laurent Kabila, who proclaimed him
self president Saturday after sweeping east to west
across Zaire in seven months.
While Kabila makes the transition from military
commander to head of state, his deposed rival tem
porarily has holed up in the West African nation of
Togo.
Kabila was expected in the capital of Kinshasa
tonight, according to South African President Nel
son Mandela. "It seems that everything is going
according to plan," Mandela said during a visit to
Zimbabwe.
The national currency, which Friday traded at
170,000 zaire to the dollar, soared to 50,000 to the
dollar yesterday, prompting merchants who nor
mally accept dollars to demand /aires in case their

value increases further.
At their first news conference in the capital,
Kabila representatives promised to announce a
new government today that would include a broad
spectrum of political parties.
Elections will wait, however, until the country is
ready for them to be conducted fairly, said Deo
Bugera, secretary-general of Kabila's" movement,
the Democratic Alliance of the Armed Forces of
Congo-Zaire.
"Before elections, you need preparations, you
need civic spirit," he said, adding that nearly 32
years of Mobutu's dictatorship had left many in the
country "fanaticized," with little understanding of
political freedom.
Bugera said the alliance would not be pushed
into quick elections by the United States and other
Western countries, which are likely to tie aid
promises to elections. "We don't want to be dictat
ed to," he said.
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
one of the leaders of international mediation
efforts in the Zaire crisis, said it was premature to
discuss elections.
1 he country is bankrupt. There's not even a
constitution," Mbeki said.
There were several signs of international accep
tance of the new regime. The United States has
recognized Kabila as "de facto" leader. South
Africa — whose governing African National
Congress began as a guerrilla movement — was
among eight African countries to have announced
official recognition.
II.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the United
Nations would recognize Kabila's regime after a
"critical mass" of member states does so.


A man accused of being a member of Mobutu's elite Presidential Guard is chased yesterday through the
streets by angry civilians who attempted to put a tire around his head and burn him alive. The man got
away. Vengeance killings of military and civilians associated with the Mobutu reqime have bequn to
occur in the capital city.
