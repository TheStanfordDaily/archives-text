AMA endorses abortion bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bidding for a veto-proof majority in the
Senate, Republican backers of a ban on certain late-term abortions
agreed to minor changes in their bill yesterday and pocketed the
endorsement of the American Medical Association in return.
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., leading sponsor of the legislation, said
the changes are designed to "protect the doctor who's delivering the
baby who runs into a problem" and must unexpectedly abort the
fetus because the mother's life is in jeopardy.
The AMA, which last week had declined to endorse the measure,
provided Santorum with a pledge of support.
"Although our general policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing
medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legisla
tion where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically
indicated,' wrote P. John Seward, the AMA's executive vice presi
dent. The pending Senate bill "now meets both those tests," he wrote.
The changes also won the immediate backing of the National Right

to Life Committee, a leading foe of abortion. But Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, harshly attacked the AMA.
"For the AMA to welcome politicians' intrusion into doctors' pro
fessional decision-making leaves the medical profession absolutely
vulnerable to political whims while sacrificing the health of women
and the privacy and the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship,"
she said in an interview. "It's clear the AMA cares more about mov
ing their political agenda through an anti-choice, Republican-con
trolled Congress than they care about women's health or their con
stitutional rights."
Attorneys attack McVeigh evidence
DENVER (AP) — Timothy McVeigh's attorneys attacked the
weakest part of the government's case yesterday, accusing FBI scien
tists of mishandling and staging the collection of shards of the Ryder
truck used in the Oklahoma City bombing.

FBI chemist Ron Kelly acknowledged un evidence photographer
failed to take a picture of one piece of the truck's cargo hold before it
was collected, and improperly documented a photograph of another
piece.
Kelly said he had to re-create a photo by placing one of the shards
— now sealed in a clear envelope — on the spot where he thought he
found it and then snap another picture.
One of these shards is considered one of the most important pieces
of evidence (or the? government because the FBI found ammonium
nitrate crystals on it, the same chemical fertilizer that prosecutors
say was the bomb's main ingredient.
McVeigh attorney Christopher Tritico seized upon the problems to
raise suspicions about Kelly's claim that he found the evidence in a
parking lot across from the Oklahoma City federal building two days
after the April 19, 1995, blast.
"You received it from a citizen and did not find it in the parking
lot," Tritico said accusingly.
"That's absolutely not true," Kelly replied.
