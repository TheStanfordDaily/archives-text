Final two nominees for
ASSU Constitutional
Council are strong pair

The assu senate win
consider two candidates at
its meeting this evening for
confirmation to the ASSU Con
stitutional Council. Current sen
ators Don Aingworth and Doug
Natelson were nominated for
that body by former President
Bill Shen as among his last acts
in office. Both men are excellent
choices for the job and should be
approved by the senate.
Aingworth is a doctoral stu
dent in computer science, a two
term graduate senator and the
outgoing senate chair. As its chair
this year, Aingworth has overseen
the administrative operations of
the senate. He has also spent a
good GeaJ of time familiarizing
himseK with the parliamentary
details of senate issues that
promise to be controversial — a
practice important for a good
chair and imperative for a Consti
tutional Council member.
Of course, during his two years
in the ASSU Senate Aingworth
has distinguished himself as a bit
of a troublemaker. But for the
most part his trouble-making has
served to keep the senate on its
toes and in as much compliance
as possible with the ASSU's con
stitution and bylaws.
Sometimes his troublemaking
has crossed the boundary — most
notably when he left a senate
meeting earlier this year to break
quorum before a vote could be
taken — but it seems likely that
Aingworth realizes such tactics
are out of place in the council and
should not be engaged in by its
members. Further, the mastery
of parliamentary procedure he's
displayed this year and the dili
gence with which he has carried
out the duties of the chair speak

well of qualifications for the Con
stitutional Council.
Doug Natelson, a doctoral stu
dent in physics and outgoing
chair of the senate's Committee
on Academics, Research and Edu
cation, has often epitomized good
student leadership through his
two years with the ASSU. Before
former Vice President Nick
Thompson brought the attention
of the ASSU President's Office to
questions of education and learn
ing at Stanford, Natelson was
working on those issues — bring
ing important questions like the
quality of instructors and teach
ing assistants to the fore. More
important to note — particularly
in a senate often perceived as
accomplishing nothing — is that
Natelson's efforts tend to suc
ceed: Thursday the Faculty Sen
ate subcommittee will issue a
report on teaching assistants that
is directly traceable to Natelson's
efforts last year.
Also significant is Natelson's
status as a calm and reasoned
voice within the ASSU senate.
His oft-displayed ability to step
back and look at heated ASSU
controversies is precisely a quali
ty to be sought in a Constitution
al Council member.
The ASSU Constitutional
Council, a judicial body with the
power to deem acts of the ASSU
Senate and president unconstitu
tional, was created by the new
ASSU Constitution passed over
whelmingly by students in April
1996. Until at least one of these
last two seats on the five-member
panel is filled, however, the coun
cil is unable to meet and thus
unable to do its constitutionally
mandated job. A year is more
than enough time to implement
the changes contained in the new
constitution, and appointing
Aingworth and Natelson to the
council will at last allow one of
the key changes — a judicial
branch — to come into being. It's
tough to imagine two better can
didates for that task.
