Consider value for tuition payments before donating

THE OTHER NIGHT, I received a
call from a woman who asked me
to donate to the Senior Gift. When
I refused, she asked, "Well, why not?
Don't you feel you should give some
thing back to Stanford?" I must admit
that I was a little surprised that some
one would call (during dinner, no less),
ask me to donate money, refuse to take
no for an answer and t hen try to make
me feel guilty. In fact, I didn't have a
good answer for her. But I have thought
a little bit since then about the idea of
giving back to Stanford.
I think Stanford is a fantastic place.
I've had a wonderful four years, during
which I've taken some great classes,
made great friends, learned to play the
trumpet (thank you, LSJUMB!) and met
and started dating the most wonderful
woman in the world. So Stanford has
definitely given me a lot.
But then again, we've given Stanford
a lot as well. It's no secret that tuition at
private colleges has increased far faster

than inflation. The final price tag of my
four years at Stanford hovers some
where around $120,000. This represents
several years of my parents' working
lives, as well as many sacrifices they
have made so that I could have these
fantastic four years. If anything, I feel
that I should give back this time and
money to my parents before I start giv
ing even more money to Stanford. In
addition, it's hard for me to feel like I
should give Stanford more money when
I'm still in the process of paying tuition.
But while we're on the subject, let's
break down the $120,000 price tag. If I
divide this figure by the 180 units that
I've taken at Stanford, it turns out that
we've paid about $667 per unit. I'm
willing to accept this as a fair price for
one unit of quality instruction at a
major university. But I've paid $4,669
for classes where my teaching assis
tants didn't speak enough English to
understand my questions, let alone
"teach" me anything. I've paid $6,670

for classes that were intended to "weed
me out" and dissuade me from applying
to medical school. I've paid $2,001 for a
class that satisfied the world cultures
distribution requirement because the
powers that be decided that the five
years of college-level foreign language
I've taken have not taught me anything
about "world cultures."
In the vast majority of cases, Stan
ford has given me my money's worth —
excellent, stimulating classes taught by
quality professors with the aid of dedi
cated, helpful TAs. However, I feel that
in the case of the above-mentioned
$13,140 I got less than I paid for. I
don't expect a money-back guarantee,
but these calculations will probably
have some impact on my generosity as
an alumnus.
Again, I think Stanford is a wonder
ful place, and I want it to continue to
be so for future students. I'm just a lit
tle wary of continually feeding the
school money to do with as it sees fit.

My future contributions as an alumnus
will probably go to the specific depart
ments which have impacted me most in
my time at Stanford — Slavic Lan
guages and Literature (especially in
this time of budget cuts for foreign lan
guages), Computer Science (which
probably doesn't need my money but
nonetheless boasts an excellent teach
ing staff and selection of courses) and
maybe Surgery (which offered me the
chance to take a fascinating class on
anatomy). My money will go to the
organizations like the LSJUMB, which
gave me a trumpet, too much free beer
and the opportunity to witness some of
Stanford athletics' great moments (and
some not-so-great ones too).
I encourage students to think careful
ly about what Stanford has given them
and what they have given to Stanford
before they give in to the onslaught of
rude telemarketers.
