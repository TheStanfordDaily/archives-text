# Rodman caricature on 'Ugly Man' flier was well intentioned
## 
### 
We, the Ugly Man On Campus coordi
nating committee, would like to address
concerns regarding the use of a Dennis
Rodman caricature in our fliering cam
paign. It has been brought to our atten
tion that a number of individuals saw

the caricature as propagating historical
stereotypes offensive to African-Ameri
can individuals.
Our intentions were not to offend any
one. Our project is a charity fund-raiser
structured as a campus-wide popularity
contest. (This year's fund-raiser raised
more than $1,400 for Inn Vision of Santa
Clara Valley). To publicize Ugly Man On
Campus, we chose Dennis Rodman
because we felt he epitomized the perfect
candidate — an attention-getting, in your
face public figure with broad popularity.
Race was not a factor in our selection.

The caricature came from an official
Dennis Rodman Fan Club Web page.
We realize that this is not an excuse for
the use of what might be considered an
offensive image. We used a caricature of
Dennis Rodman in order to avoid copy
right and sponsorship issues. It was
also difficult to obtain a photograph of
good enough resolution that we could
enlarge for our flier.
In retrospect, we regret to say we did
not realize the stereotypes that this
depiction might embody nor the ramifi
cations of our use of this image. We

apologize to anyone who was offended
and also for any misunderstanding that
may have occurred. We hope this inci
dent will not negatively impact percep
tions of Ugly Man On Campus, Inn V
ision, our sponsors or Alpha Phi Omega.
