## Racing in life's triathlon 
### 
FOUR YEARS AND four months
ago, I put together an essay for
the Stanford admissions officers.
They asked me to tell them about "a
book that I would write" — in 250
words or less, of course.
After mulling over a variety of
inspired topics like "My Life as a Half-
Indian Geek" and "Bon Jovi; Big-
Haired Glam Rockers or Godfathers of
New Jersey Soul?", I chose to take the
supposed high road and compose a trea
tise on the metaphysical aspects of the
triathlon.
It was an impassioned sermon about
how swimming, biking and running
directly paralleled our interactions with
the forces of nature, the beast of tech
nology and internal struggle. I wanted to
give an intellectual explanation for ath
letic endeavors, a Renaissance interpre
tation of physical pain. Yes! "The
Triathlon of Life" would be the first shot
in the athlete-philosopher's revolution!
Fortunately, Dean Montoya chose to
admit me anyway. I consider myself
lucky because in retrospect I know I
was full of crap.
I came to this realization last Sunday
at around 8:01 a.m. At 8 a.m., I had
entered the murky water of the Uvas
Reservoir and started living my poten
tial book topic. At the urging of Ben, the
Lambda Nu resident assistant, I had
decided to seek athletic demi-glory, and
together we had entered the South Bay

Triathlon.
It started simply enough. We were to
begin by swimming around a jutting
peninsula. I plunged underwater, tem
porarily escaping the morning heat, and
found the nature about which I so pas
sionately wrote as a senior in high
school. I envisioned myself as connected
to the pond's ecosystem by an inextrica
ble thread, a la "A River Runs Through
It." By immersing myself in the water, I
was truly "one" with my spiritual center.
I was swimming toward epiphany.
My wonderful facade crashed down
after about 20 seconds when a competi
tor, clearly oblivious to my transcen
dent connection, swam over me and
dunked me to the 8-foot depths. Sec
onds later, another of my philosopher
athlete peers kicked me in the head as
we crossed paths.
After a minute, I looked up from my
carefully regulated freestyle stroke to
see two large wet-suited warriors con
verging together in front of me, like a
neoprene Charybdis. I veered to the
side. They bashed heads, yelled at each
other and continued on.
The rest of the race was equally
unworthy of poetry. I spent most of the
bike ride trying to stay out of the way of
the of the 250-pound "Clydesdale"-divi
sion riders who were blowing by me. In
the middle of my run, I stopped to give
the evil-eye to a little girl who had run
out of paper cups at the water station. I

finished the race 25 minutes behind a
14-year-old.
So why, then, did I enjoy two hours
of cramping, fatigue and masochism?
I had learned nothing, felt no connec
tion between that day and the greater
framework of life and had inspired very
little within myself beyond temporary
nausea and impending body-ache. I had
no book left to write.
But for two hours, I stopped think
ing. I think that maybe like most people
on this campus, I have a tendency to
over-analyze just about everything.
Sports give me a chance to just feel.
I leave my thoughts behind and have
a Bacchanalian feast of sweat and
endorphins. I stop trying to solve my
problems, and I find no solutions; I just
run through them.
I finally let myself hurt, for along
with my tendency to sacrifice intuition
for analysis I often suppress pain in a
quest for optimism. At the apex of my
weekend-warrior athletics, I unleash
the pain.
It may be little more than physical
escapism, but it sure does feel good.

lic policy, wonders if he's still full of
crap, as he just spent this column ana
lyzing a feeling. Oh well.
