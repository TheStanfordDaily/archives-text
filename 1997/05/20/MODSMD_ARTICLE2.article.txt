# Browne predicts $1 billion sales goal for 2007

### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A wave of unanimous, al
though often guarded, ap
proval from experts on campus
greeted British Petroleum
CEO John Browne's an
nouncement yesterday of a
commitment to reducing glob
al warming and supporting
solar power.
Petroleum Engineering
Prof, Roland Home, the de
partment's chair, said he was
"greatly pleased to see the
CEO of a major oil company
taking an interest in alterna
tive energy."
In his speech at Frost Am
phitheater, Browne set a tar
get for BP of $1 billion in sales
of solar energy cells by 2007, a
tenfold increase.
Senior Ijeslie An n Hummel,
an energy engineering major
who attended the speech, said
she was "thrilled" by those fig
ure, but that "BP has a lot to
live up to after this speech."
She noted, however, that
Browne's speech emphasized
sustainable oil markets rather
than overall sustainable
growth policies.
Browne stressed in his speech
that the growth he hopes for in
solar power and other renewable
power sources "is not instead of oil
and gas. It is additional."
While yesterday's announce
ment set ambitious targets for BP,
Hummel said investments in alter
native energy sources and some
recognition of environmental prob
lems was "not an unfamiliar strate

gy" for petroleum companies.
"At least among the major oil
companies [there is] a pretty clear
recognition that they have a pret
ty important role in the environ
mental arena," said Franklin Orr,
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences.
Home noted that while some ob
servers might be suspicious of oil
companies' moves into alternative
energy, the oil industry is one that
has the "capital and the corporate
mode of risk-taking" necessary to
go into areas that do not turn im
mediate profits.

Another way of looking at the oil
industry's environmental stance
came from Sou my a Sastry, a se
nior, who noted that fossil fuel pro
ducers who attempt to deny the
possibility of global warming "out
right just looked silly these days."
She said Browne said "nothing
that was startling or particularly
daring," but she commended sever
al references he made to "equity is
sues," specifically ensuring that
the burden of solving global warm
ing problems will not fall dispro
portionately on developing
economies.
