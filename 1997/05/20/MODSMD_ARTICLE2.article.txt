A wave of unanimous, al
though often guarded, ap
proval from experts on campus
greeted British Petroleum
CEO John Browne's an
nouncement yesterday of a
commitment to reducing glob
al warming and supporting
solar power.
Petroleum Engineering
Prof, Roland Home, the de
partment's chair, said he was
"greatly pleased to see the
CEO of a major oil company
taking an interest in alterna
tive energy."
In his speech at Frost Am
phitheater, Browne set a tar
get for BP of $1 billion in sales
of solar energy cells by 2007, a
tenfold increase.
Senior Ijeslie An n Hummel,
an energy engineering major
who attended the speech, said
she was "thrilled" by those fig
ure, but that "BP has a lot to
live up to after this speech."
She noted, however, that
Browne's speech emphasized
sustainable oil markets rather
than overall sustainable
growth policies.
