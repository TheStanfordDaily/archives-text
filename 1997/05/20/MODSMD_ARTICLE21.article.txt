"Democracy is a device that insures we
shall be governed no better than we
deserve."
— George Bernard Shaw
I KNOW IT is neither a particularly
original thought nor one that is par
ticularly popular in a society that
states as an aim egalitarian ism, but I've
decided that democracy is bad.
On Thursday I stood for election to
become editor in chief of The Daily for its
212 th volume, which technically begins
June 15 and continues through Jan. 30.
Essentially that means that the new edi
tor in chief will be responsible for the
paper in the first half of next year and has
the additionally burden of putting togeth
er a staff for the weekly summer edition.
I think (as you'd expect) that I was
clearly the more qualified candidate. Of
course, I lost (if I'd won this would be an
awfully self-congratulatory column). I lost
handily, in fact. I still think I'm the better
guy for the job. The voters (that is, The
Daly's staff) obviously thought otherwise.
H.L. Mencken: "Democracy is the theory
that the common people know what they
want and deserve to get it good and hard."
A friend I spoke to the day after the elec
tion argued that elections for a newspaper
editorship make little sense. To do a good

job in the other editorial positions that con
stitute the rungs of the editor-in-chief lad
der, you probably need to irritate some
people. And those irritated people are the
ones who will choose whether to elect you.
So to be a good editor, he explained, neces
sarily makes someone a poor candidate.
I think that's true. And I think it's
true not just for elections to become edi
tor in chief of The Stanford Daily but for
elections everywhere. In 1984, it was
clear that the federal deficit was spiraling
out of control and that some sort of belt
tightening was necessary. Thus Demo
cratic presidential candidate Walter Mon
dale made his famous pledge to raise
taxes if elected. Not surprisingly, he lost.
Instead, in 1997, we've witnessed a sav
age welfare bill designed to cut govern
ment spending and can look forward to
cuts in nearly all federal discretionary
spending. Mondale was right in 1984, but
being right is not equal to being elected.
Adlai Stevenson: "If we are to begin
packaging ourselves as boxes of cereal,
democracy will die . . . for you could not
win the presidency without proving
unworthy for the job."
Of course, the problem that the best
ideas are often not the most popular ones
occurs when all candidates are acting in
entirely good faith. What is a worse prob

lem — or at least a more insidious one —
is that the democratic process encourages,
well, creative versions of the truth.
A democratic election is a pure popu
larity contest — even if the contest is
over which candidate's ideas or plans or
credentials are most popular. Each candi
date in a democratic election, then, has a
tremendous incentive to make him or
herself as attractive as possible in as
many ways as possible to as many voters
as possible.
In the last few weeks I found myself
doing just that. To the photographers my
plan to run full-color pictures on The
Daily's front page every day was some
thing I felt very strongly about; it was
something that would drastically improve
both the display of their photography and
the overall look of The Daily. To the busi
ness staff members it was an idea I felt we
should explore; it would be nice to run
color front pages, but we needed to care
fully analyze what it would cost and how
it would affect the bottom line. Neither
argument is untrue, and bending one's
stances a bit is often necessary.
Changing one's views on the future is
neither impossible nor unreasonable;
changing one's past, however, is. Still,
candidates often attempt to do just that:
Does anyone really think that Bill Clinton
never inhaled? And doesn't "altering" the

truth to increase electability inherently
decrease legitimacy upon election?
Harry Truman: "There was never a
non-partisan in politics. A man cannot be
a non-partisan and be effective."
In small organizations — like The
Daily, for example — democracy causes
real problems for getting the organiza
tion's main goals accomplished. Washing
ton is big enough and the public servants
there are numerous enough that each
opposing candidate can afford to surround
himself completely with a staff ostensibly
on his "team." That is, Bill Clinton am
have a talented Stanford economist
(Joseph Stiglitz) in his camp, and Bob Dole
can have one (John Taylor) in his.
But because one is clearly labeled as a
Democrat and the other as a Republican, it
is unlikely that they can work well side-by
side. In smaller communities it is impossi
ble to have as deep a pool of talent. At a
place like The Daily, those who are not
actually facing off in the electoral ring but
are instead standing in the corners must
work together. And because the organiz
tion has a management structure based on
politics, it is virtually impossible for any
effective staff member not to have become
at least somewhat partisanly involved.
Winston Churchill: "It has been said

that democracy is the worst form of gov
ernment — except all those other forms
that have been tried. "
The flaws in democracy are enormous.
Those who are casting the ballots are not
necessarily those most able to determine
who will lead them best. The system dis
courages the necessary confrontation of
unpleasant realities and encourages
those vying for office to embellish their
versions of reality.
In some cases, particularly those in
which a candidate is not being elected to
represent the interests of his or her con
stituents but rather to administer an
organization, it seems like there must be
better ways than democracy to select a
new leader. Perhaps appointment by com
mittee would work best — but how, if not
democratically, would the members of the
committee determine who to select?
Ultimately, I guess the cigar-chomp
ing PM is right.

Jesse Oxfeld, a junior majoring in com
munication, takes solace in the words of
Art Spander, a columnist for The Oak
land Tribune: "The great thing about
democracy is that it gives every voter a
chance to do something stupid. "
