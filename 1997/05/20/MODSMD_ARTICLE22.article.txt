## NCAA Men's Tennis Championship Surprise — Georgia is the last roadblock Men can claim 6th title 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The good news about
the NCAA Championship match tonight,
where Stanford faces Georgia, is the Cardi
nal doesn't have to face a team with the
home-court advantage. With the Bulldogs' 4-
2 upset over the top-ranked Bruins, Stan
ford will not face an entourage of hungry
blue and gold fans.
The Cardinal hopes to clinch their second
three-peat in history, the only team to ever
do so which would make Stanford, as well as
make NCAA Championship history. Should
the Cardinal win today, Stanford becomes
the first school in Division I history to ever
clinch six NCAA titles in one year.
Stanford will face the champions of the
Southeastern Conference, a tough confer
ence which includes five automatic quali
fiers for the NCAA tournament Mississip
pi, Kentucky, Mississippi State and LSU.
The feisty Bulldogs which dropped three

dual matches all season and boast three
doubles teams ranked in the top 25 in the
nation as well as two top players in third
ranked John Roddick and 13th-ranked
Eddie Jacques.
It also appears the Bulldog squad has
improved over the season. Their 4-2 victory
over the Bruins avenged one of their few
losses all year, when they fell 4-3 to UCLA
last February at the National Indoors.
"This match went down to the wire," said
Georgia head coach Manual Diaz. "We knew
coming in that we would have to play some
tough matches here. I hope we have some
thing for [today] because Stanford is a great
team."
Stanford has had success against the
Bulldogs in past NCAA tournament history,
as it has beaten them in the tournament four
times since 1977. In 1989 Stanford and
Georgia faced each other in the finals, and
Stanford came out on top 4-1.
