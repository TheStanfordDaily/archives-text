and senior Grant Elliott were all over the
net, jumping to a dominant 5-0 lead and
going on to crush Ole Miss' Barry Hassell
and Johan Hede 8-2.
Stanford knew that a victoiy over the

Rebels in doubles was important to the
outcome of the match.
"Mississippi lost the doubles point in
their first two matches here and still took
the (overall) match," said head coach
Dick Gould.
As Wolters and Goldstein trailed 5-2,
Stanford looked to the Bryans to clinch
the doubles point for the Cardinal. Lead
ing 40-15 against the huge serve of the
Rebels' Robert Abendroth, the freshman
twins refused to give in as Abendroth
double faulted, putting Stanford up 7-5
with Bob Bryan to serve. Ole Miss blast
ed three ground strokes out in a row as
Stanford took the match 8-5, claiming
the doubles point for the Cardinal.

difficult start, trailing 66th-ranked Sjo
qvist 5-0, while Elliott broke Aben
droth's serve to go up 4-1.
Soon after, Bob Bryan finished ofF
DeChaunac, crushing him 6-1, 6-3 to
give Stanford a '2-0 lead. The win was an
impressive feat for the freshman, who
lost to DeChaunac in his first collegiate
match back in October at the Ail-Ameri
can Championship qualifiers 6-4, 6-3.
"Hobby did a super job in his match
and did a great job of putting his match
away," Gould said.
Bryan pointed to his coaches as a rea
son for his dazzling play, crediting assis
tant coach John Whit linger and Gould
with helping him become a more aggres
sive player.
Stanford's 2-0 lead dwindled to 2-1 as
Abrams was unable to fend off the pow
erful game of Vikrant Chada, falling 6-2,
6-3. With Elliott up one set and on serve
at 6-5 in the second set, Goldstein up 4-2
after the losing the first set 6-2,
and both Ryan Wolters and Mike
on serve in the second set
after winning their first set, the
match was yet to be over.
Elliott broke Abendroth's serve
to take the match 7-5, 6-2, but
Goldstein fell to Sjoqvist 6-2, 7-5.
With Stanford leading 3-2 it

was Stanford's top player Wolters
who turned in the deciding victory
for the Card, putting them in the
championship today. After eking
out the first set 7-5, Wolters
crushed Hede in the second set 6-2.
"I felt like I got off to a slow
start in the doubles today, and I
was a little down after that,"
Wolters said. "I missed too many
in the beginning of singles, but
once I got that first set, I felt like I
knew how to beat him."
Gould was proud of the team,

pointing to the determination of
his experienced players such as
Wolters as a key element to the vie
to iy.
"Ryan stayed with it, and this
was great example of the leader
ship he, Elliott and Goldstein have
given this team," Gould said.
Stanford will face fourth-seeded
Georgia today in the finals at 6
p.m. at Los Angeles Tennis Center.
The Bulldogs stunned top-ranked
and top-seeded UCLA 4-2 in the
other semifinal match yesterday.
