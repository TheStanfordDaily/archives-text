LOS ANGELES - The No. 3 Stan
ford men's tennis team advanced into
the finals of the NCAA Championships
yesterday by taking out No. 2 Mississippi
4-2.
The Cardinal out-muscled the second
ranked Rebels in an emotional battle
beginning in doubles play. In the No. 1
doubles position, 15th-ranked Johan
Landsberg and Martin Sjoqvist took an
early lead against Stanford's sophomore
Ryan Wolters and junior Paul Goldstein
2-0. But on court 2, 13th-ranked fresh
men Bob and Mike Bryan appeared fear
less, serving well and bouncing all over
the court to hold serve at 2-1.
On court 3, freshman Geoff Abrams
and senior Grant Elliott were all over the
net, jumping to a dominant 5-0 lead and
going on to crush Ole Miss' Barry Hassell
and Johan Hede 8-2.
Stanford knew that a victoiy over the

Rebels in doubles was important to the
outcome of the match.
"Mississippi lost the doubles point in
their first two matches here and still took
the (overall) match," said head coach
Dick Gould.
As Wolters and Goldstein trailed 5-2,
Stanford looked to the Bryans to clinch
the doubles point for the Cardinal. Lead
ing 40-15 against the huge serve of the
Rebels' Robert Abendroth, the freshman
twins refused to give in as Abendroth
double faulted, putting Stanford up 7-5
with Bob Bryan to serve. Ole Miss blast
ed three ground strokes out in a row as
Stanford took the match 8-5, claiming
the doubles point for the Cardinal.
Bob Bryan went up early in the No. 2
singles match, breaking second-ranked
Sebastien DeChaunac's serve to lead 4-1.
Meanwhile, Wolters and Mike Bryan
were on serve in close sets against ninth
ranked Hede and eighth-ranked Lands
berg, respectively.
On the back courts, Goldstein had a

difficult start, trailing 66th-ranked Sjo
qvist 5-0, while Elliott broke Aben
droth's serve to go up 4-1.
Soon after, Bob Bryan finished ofF
DeChaunac, crushing him 6-1, 6-3 to
give Stanford a '2-0 lead. The win was an
impressive feat for the freshman, who
lost to DeChaunac in his first collegiate
match back in October at the Ail-Ameri
can Championship qualifiers 6-4, 6-3.
"Hobby did a super job in his match
and did a great job of putting his match
away," Gould said.
Bryan pointed to his coaches as a rea
son for his dazzling play, crediting assis
tant coach John Whit linger and Gould
with helping him become a more aggres
sive player.
Stanford's 2-0 lead dwindled to 2-1 as
Abrams was unable to fend off the pow
erful game of Vikrant Chada, falling 6-2,
6-3. With Elliott up one set and on serve
at 6-5 in the second set, Goldstein up 4-2
