LOS ANGELES — It was an emo
tional and messy day of tennis at the
NCAA Championships yesterday, com
plete with spitting, profanity and a
code violation as Stanford moved into
the Finals. As Stanford fans yelled jubi
lantly in the stands for their squad,
tempers festered on the courts.
The rowdiness, more reminiscent of
college basketball than tennis, began
after the doubles point, when the 13th
ranked dynamic freshman duo of Bob
and Mike Bryan cruised past Robert
Abendroth and Sebastien DeChaunac
8-5.
The Bryans' victory clinched the
doubles point for Stanford, giving
them a 1-0 advantage going into the
singles matches. But the results did
not please Mississippi's second-ranked
Sebastien DeChaunac, who, following
the doubles loss, became incensed at
Bob Bryan and spat at the freshman.
Junior Paul Goldstein appeared on the
scene, telling DeChaunac to back off.
Such a scene set the stage for an

exciting singles match, as Bob
Bryan and DeChaunac were to
meet again at the No. 2 singles
position.
"Before the singles match, we
had some words," said Bryan.
"We said let's just have a good
match and not have any crap."
The 25th-ranked Bryan went
on to crush the second-ranked
DeChaunac 6-1, 6-3.
Yet the messiness was only
beginning on other courts. In
the No. 3 singles match, featur
ing 73rd-ranked Mike Bryan
against eighth-ranked Johan
Landsberg, the two were neck
and-neck through the first set.
At 5-5 with Bryan serving, the
freshman called Landsberg's
ground stroke out, giving Bryan
a 6-5 lead. An infuriated Lands
berg disagreed with the call and
looked to the umpire for an
overruling.
With no overruling made, the
two proceeded to switch sides,
but as the umpire got out of the
chair to change the score, Lands
berg stuck his face in the
umpire's, calling the Stanford
freshman a slew of names.
As the head umpire

approached, Landsberg did not
let down, calling the umpire a "f
--ing fag." Such words were not
tolerated, and the umpire called a
code violation against the Rebel,
awarding an automatic game to
Stanford and giving Bryan the
first set 7-5.
While it was an emotional
match, Ole Miss head coach Billy
Chadwick argued that such situa
tions are inevitable in the quest
for a national title.
"These youngsters want to
win so bad it is just a fine line
that one is walking, and it is not
only in tennis that you see this,"
Chadwick said. "The crowd was
riding them the entire time."
Stanford fans were vocal all
day, cheering vociferously in the
stands for their Cardinal squad.
At the No. 4 singles position,
15th-ranked Paul Goldstein faced
62nd-ranked Martin Sjoqvist of
Mississippi, and Stanford fans
were emotional, firing comments
as the Stanford All-American ral
lied from a first-set loss to go
ahead in the second set before
falling to the Rebel 7-5.
"I told Paul they were yelling
things and asked them to stop,"
Sjoqvist said. "It is OK to cheer,
but they were taking it too far.
But Paul is a really nice guy, and
there were no problems after
that."
