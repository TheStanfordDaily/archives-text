•It was a day of upsets at the
opening round of the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships
as six of the top 16 seeds were
eliminated from the singles
bracket. Fortunately for the
newly crowned champions, none
was from the Stanford lineup.
The Cardinal's three seeded
competitors, senior Katie

Schlukebir, freshman Lilia
Osterloh and junior Julie Scott,
all advanced with straight-set
wins.
Stanford's unseeded contes
tants were not as fortunate, how
ever, as senior Sandra De Silva
and freshman Teryn Ashley both
were eliminated.
Schlukebir, the No. 2 seed
overall and the top-ranked player
in college tennis, began her quest
for an NCAA individual title with

an opening round win against
Tennessee's No. 1 player, Man
isha Malhotra. Schlukebir moved
to the second round with a 6-2, 6-
4 victory.
Osterloh shook off a slow stari
in her first-round match with
Arizona State's Stephanie Lans
dorp. Down 5-2 in the first set,
the eighth-seeded freshman
stormed back to win the next 11
games for a 7-5, 6-0 victory.
Scott, who clinched the title
for the Cardinal on Sunday, also
earned a straight-set win over
UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt 6-1,
6-4. Despite the relatively easy
victory, Scott said it was tough to
get up for the match.
"It was hard to motivate for
the match until I got into it,"
Scott said. "I am friends with
Elizabeth from home so that
made it difficult. Also, after
everything that happened |Sun
day], it was just tough to focus on
this one, but I played pretty good
I guess."
Some of the bracket's other
top seeds did not fare as well,
however. Two of the tourna
ments top eight seeds, No. 5
Cristina Moros from Texas and
No. 7 Dawn Buth from Florida,
suffered upset losses to Wake
Forest's Amy Jensen and Duke's
Wendy Fix, respectively. Other
top seeds who bowed out early
include Georgia's Michelle
Anderson, Arizona State's Ileka
Cseresnyes, William and Mary's
Lauren Nicklaus and Wisconsin's
Melissa Zimpfer.
De Silva had a tough time fac
ing Florida freshman Amanda
Basica, who lost her No. 2 match
to Stanford freshman Anne Kre
mer in the Florida-Stanford final
Sunday Basica bounced back to
form with a resounding win 6-1,
6-2.
Stanford's other hero, Ash
ley, who climbed back from a 4-
0 deficit to win in the third set
of her No. 6 match in the cham
pionship, almost recreated
those heroics. Down 5-1 in the
third set against Florida's No. 4
player, senior Divya Merchant,
