# NCAA Women's Tennis Championship
## Individuals and pairs advance Schlukebir, Scott, Osterloh and both doubles teams go on 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
•It was a day of upsets at the
opening round of the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships
as six of the top 16 seeds were
eliminated from the singles
bracket. Fortunately for the
newly crowned champions, none
was from the Stanford lineup.
The Cardinal's three seeded
competitors, senior Katie

Schlukebir, freshman Lilia
Osterloh and junior Julie Scott,
all advanced with straight-set
wins.
Stanford's unseeded contes
tants were not as fortunate, how
ever, as senior Sandra De Silva
and freshman Teryn Ashley both
were eliminated.
Schlukebir, the No. 2 seed
overall and the top-ranked player
in college tennis, began her quest
for an NCAA individual title with

an opening round win against
Tennessee's No. 1 player, Man
isha Malhotra. Schlukebir moved
to the second round with a 6-2, 6-
4 victory.
Osterloh shook off a slow stari
in her first-round match with
Arizona State's Stephanie Lans
dorp. Down 5-2 in the first set,
the eighth-seeded freshman
stormed back to win the next 11
games for a 7-5, 6-0 victory.
Scott, who clinched the title
for the Cardinal on Sunday, also
earned a straight-set win over
UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt 6-1,
6-4. Despite the relatively easy
victory, Scott said it was tough to
get up for the match.
"It was hard to motivate for
the match until I got into it,"
Scott said. "I am friends with
Elizabeth from home so that
made it difficult. Also, after
everything that happened |Sun
day], it was just tough to focus on
this one, but I played pretty good
I guess."
Some of the bracket's other
top seeds did not fare as well,
however. Two of the tourna
ments top eight seeds, No. 5
Cristina Moros from Texas and
No. 7 Dawn Buth from Florida,
suffered upset losses to Wake
Forest's Amy Jensen and Duke's
Wendy Fix, respectively. Other
top seeds who bowed out early
include Georgia's Michelle
Anderson, Arizona State's Ileka
Cseresnyes, William and Mary's
Lauren Nicklaus and Wisconsin's
Melissa Zimpfer.
De Silva had a tough time fac
ing Florida freshman Amanda
Basica, who lost her No. 2 match
to Stanford freshman Anne Kre
mer in the Florida-Stanford final
Sunday Basica bounced back to
form with a resounding win 6-1,
6-2.
Stanford's other hero, Ash
ley, who climbed back from a 4-
0 deficit to win in the third set
of her No. 6 match in the cham
pionship, almost recreated
those heroics. Down 5-1 in the
third set against Florida's No. 4
player, senior Divya Merchant,

nessee's Manisha Malhotra yesterday.
Ashley pulled within one game
at 5-4, but Merchant closed the
door and advanced with a 6-1, 1-
6, 6-4 victory.
The Cardinal was faced with an
interesting test in the opening
round of the doubles bracket. Due
to the Cardinal's singles domi
nance throughout the title run,
Stanford doubles teams went into
first-round action not having
played a match since mid-April.
The second-seeded tandem of
Scott and junior Ail-American
Ania Bleszynski looked a little
rusty, dropping the first two
games of the match but shook off
the cobwebs by winning 12
straight games for a 6-2, 6-0 win
over Harvard's Gina Majmudar
and Gabriela Hricko.
"This was a good warmup
match for us," Bleszynski said
after the match. "I was a little off
at first, but after we ran around
for a while, I seemed to get into it
more. Hopefully, we can get better
and better every match."
On the other side of the brack
et, Osterloh and Schlukebir, the
fourth-seeded doubles team, had a
bit of breaking in to do as well.
After taking the first set rather
easily, the Cardinal's No. 1 dou
bles team lost the second set to
Boise State's Gayleen McManus
and Anita Pearson. The Cardinal
duo got it together in the third,
however, taking a 6-1,4-6,6-2 win.
The action continues today in
both singles and doubles. In sin
gles, Schlukebir will meet Eline
Chiew from Brigham Young in the
second round at 9 a.m., with a pos
sible rematch in the afternoon
with Florida's M.C. White in the
third round. The Gator freshman
earned the only Florida point in
the team final with her straight
set win over Schlukebir. Chiew is
somewhat of a surprise in the sec
ond round, upsetting California's
Amanda Augustus in the round of
64.
Osterloh will face William and
Mary's Michelle O in her second
round match at 10:30 a.m. at
Taube. In the Cardinal's 6-0 quar

terfmal win over the Tribe last Fri
day, Kremer put away O in
straight sets. Osterloh could meet
Basica in the third round this
afternoon if both defeat their sec
ond round opponents.
Scott meets Montana's Vanessa
Castellano at 10:30 a.m. With
Moros gone, Scott is now the top
seed in her bracket and has the
chance to do some damage.

In doubles, Scott and Bleszyns
ki will find Miami's Carolina Hora
and Victoria Hunt in the second
round, while Schlukebir and
Osterloh will face Wisconsin's
Zimpfer and Colleen Lucey. Both
matches are slated for 3:30 p.m.
Only one round of doubles will be
played today.
The finals of the singles and
doubles brackets will be Friday.
