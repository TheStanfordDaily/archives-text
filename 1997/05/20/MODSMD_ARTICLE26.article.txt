# Baseball gets top seed after all
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
The No. 6 Stanford baseball
team (39-18) received a No. 1 seed
in the Western Regional of the
NCAA playoffs. Despite a disap
pointing weekend, in which the
Cardinal lost the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title to Washington, it man
aged to hang on to a top seed.
"Last weekend did not have
much effect on the seeding com
mittee," said junior right fielder
Joe Kilburg. "They looked at what

we did earlier in the year instead."
To earn a No. 1 seed, Stanford
won the Pac-10 South and an
impressive 39 games against credi
ble opponents all season.
The No. 1 seed is a huge advan
tage going into the regional, as the
Card will face the No. 6 team,
Northeastern (33-17), first at 7
p.m. Thursday. The winner of that
game then faces the loser of' the
game between the third seed,
Texas A&M (39-20), and fourth
seeded Fresno State (37-26).
The Aggies and Bulldogs will

square off at 3 p.m. Thursday, and
second-seeded Cal State-Fullerton
(38-22-1) and the fifth seed, Santa
Clara (39-18), will meet at 11 a.m.
The tournament is double elimina
tion, and Stanford's high seed also
will boost the spirits of the strug
gling ball club.
"It is a boost to the ego because
we stumbled this weekend," Kil
burg said. "We still have done
everything that we set out to do.
We got a one seed in the regional in
front of our home crowd. That is
good."
The NCAA awarded 48 teams
postseason berths, 24 receiving
automatic bids (including five
through play-in series) and the
rest at-large invitations.
The Cardinal has faced Fuller
ton, Fresno State, and Santa Clara
already this season. In their first
road series of the year, the Cardi
nal lost two of three games to the

Titans.
The Titans "have always been a
nemesis of ours, but we have been
playing much better than we
played then," Kilburgsaid.
Freshman Edmund Muth
echoed Kilburg's sentiments.
"We weren't playing to the level
we could earlier in the season,"
Muth said. "We lire looking for
ward to a rematch."
Stanford and Santa Clara faced
each other four times during the
season, with the Cardinal victori
ous in three of the games. The
Card also took two of three from
Fresno State.

Four of the six teams in Six-Pac
received regional berths: Stanford,
UCI-A, USC and Arizona State.
UCLA received the No. 1 seed in
the Midwest Regional, to be played
in Stillwater, Okla. USC received a
No. 2 seed in the Southern II
Regional at Tuscaloosa, Ala., and
Arizona State was awarded a No. 3
seed in the Atlantic Regional in
Coral Gables, Fla.
Washington, who shocked the
Cardinal this past weekend, was
awarded the No. 4 seed in the
Mideast Regional at Starkville,
Miss. The Huskies received the
automatic bid as Pac-10 champs.
