# Transfer Quaccia has been big find

It all begjin with a letter.
Bo Aiello, the baseball coach for the Modesto
Junior College Pirates, wrote to the Stanford base
ball program during the 1995 season. He told them
about a sophomore first baseman who played for the
Pirates, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound lefly who could do
more than hit for both average and power. He was
extremely hard working and dedicated, and with his
height advantage he could make amazing catches
catches other baseball players only dreamed of.
He told them about Luke Quaccia.
Assistant baseball coaches Dean Stotz and David
Esquer, who now works for the Pepperdine baseball
squad, packed their bags and drove the two hours to
Modesto. Although it was unusual to recruit a junior
college player, the "huge target at first base" bad to
be seen.
They watched Quaccia play in a team scrimmage,
and later spoke with the Oakdale, Calif., native
about the possibility of transferring to Stanford.
"I told them if I had the opportunity to get in here
and play that I would definitely come," Quaccia said.
Now a senior starter for the Stanford baseball
team, Quaccia remembered bis first practices with
the Cardinal as occasionally nerve-wracking. His
teammates were strangers, and the level of play had
increased.
"Then I said to heck with it â€” I belong here,"
Quaccia said. "It was still baseball."
Quaccia's opportunity to start, however, didn't
come until the following March in a game against
Arizona when then-senior first baseman Troy Kent
fouled a ball off his foot. Kent finished the inning but
returned to the dugout in pain. Before Quaccia knew
it, he was inserted into the lineup.
"It was an opportunity I was waiting for for a long
time," Quaccia said. "I didn't think it would ever
come."

Senior first baseman Luke Quaccia has contribut
ed all season long to the Cardinal's success.
Quaccia remained at first the
rest of the season while Kent
moved to third. In his first game as
a starter the following day,
Quaccia hit two doubles and scored
two RBIs in a 7-6 victory over Ari
zona. As the season progressed,
Quaccia continued to improve. Me
ranked second on the team with a
batting average of .369, recording

17 multi-hit games in his 33 starts
and earning an honorable mention
All-Pac-10 selection, hitting an
astounding .440 in league games.
This season, batting .352 with
seven home runs and 37 RBIs,
head coach Mark Marquess consid
ers Quaccia to be one of the "inte
gral parts" of the Cardinal lineup.
Stotz agreed. "He just has done
a fabulous job of fulfilling his abili
ties," he said. "No one has ever
worked harder."
Off the field, Quaccia has
emerged as the unofficial team

leader.
"He just makes his presence
felt," said sophomore third base
man Josh Hochgesang. "Everyone
looks to him."
Most noticeable and admired
are Quaccia's dedication and strin
gent work ethic. He would love to
make the College World Series this
year, but he also dreams of some
day playing professional baseball.
"I want to look back and say I
made it as far as I could with the
ability I had," Quaccia said. "And I
can live with that."
