It all begjin with a letter.
Bo Aiello, the baseball coach for the Modesto
Junior College Pirates, wrote to the Stanford base
ball program during the 1995 season. He told them
about a sophomore first baseman who played for the
Pirates, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound lefly who could do
more than hit for both average and power. He was
extremely hard working and dedicated, and with his
height advantage he could make amazing catches
catches other baseball players only dreamed of.
He told them about Luke Quaccia.
Assistant baseball coaches Dean Stotz and David
Esquer, who now works for the Pepperdine baseball
squad, packed their bags and drove the two hours to
Modesto. Although it was unusual to recruit a junior
college player, the "huge target at first base" bad to
be seen.
They watched Quaccia play in a team scrimmage,
and later spoke with the Oakdale, Calif., native
about the possibility of transferring to Stanford.
"I told them if I had the opportunity to get in here
and play that I would definitely come," Quaccia said.
Now a senior starter for the Stanford baseball
team, Quaccia remembered bis first practices with
the Cardinal as occasionally nerve-wracking. His
teammates were strangers, and the level of play had
increased.
"Then I said to heck with it â€” I belong here,"
Quaccia said. "It was still baseball."
Quaccia's opportunity to start, however, didn't
come until the following March in a game against
Arizona when then-senior first baseman Troy Kent
fouled a ball off his foot. Kent finished the inning but
returned to the dugout in pain. Before Quaccia knew
it, he was inserted into the lineup.
"It was an opportunity I was waiting for for a long
time," Quaccia said. "I didn't think it would ever
come."
