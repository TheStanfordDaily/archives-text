# Marriage not an ordinary proposition
## 
### Clara Kim 
Showing not only that dating at
Stanford exists, but also that people
get engaged, two Stanford couples
chose unusual paths to the altar.
One couple danced the night
away and ended the evening with a
promise.
Last February during the Vien
nese Ball, doctoral student James
Kuffner arranged for the Mendi
cants to serenade his girlfriend,
Haruko Akatsu, a resident physi
cian at Stanford Hospital in the de
partment of Internal Medicine.
Then, while startled ball-goers
looked on, Kuffner dropped to one
knee and asked Akatsu to marry
him after producing a ring from his
pocket.

"There was this collective gasp,"
Kufiner said. "Everyone was so sur
prised."
When Akatsu was first called up
to the microphone hy sophomore
Carl Walters, musical director of
the Mendicants, she said she was
unaware of the events to transpire.
"First I thought maybe some
body was sick, but then how did
they know I'm a physician?" said
Akatsu.
After Kuffner joined Akatsu on
the stage, she figured out what was
going on. Akatsu managed to nod
her head "yes" when Kuffner
popped the question. Everyone
started cheering and congratulat
ing the happy couple.


Courtor.y of James Kufncr
Doctoral student James Kuffner proposed to his girlfriend Haruko
Akatsu, a resident physician at Stanford Hospital at the Viennese Ball
in February.
"That was really what I had
hoped for," Kuffner said, referring
to the crowd's support.
Akatsu and Kuffner met two
years ago through a weekly on
campus Bible study group but
never really considered dating
until last summer when Akatsu
asked Kuffner to help her purchase
a laptop computer.
"Our first real date was at Fry's
Electronics," said Kuffner. "That's
the classic love story of the CS grad
student."
Soon after, Kuffner and Akatsu
became a couple. After Kuffner
took Akatsu home to spend Christ
mas with his family, they both
started thinking about marriage.
"That's when I felt maybe this
was the man I would marry," Akat
su said.
Kuffner echoed Akatsu's senti
ments: "I had this feeling that this

was the one."
Kuffner formulated his plan
about the Viennese Ball well in ad
vance. He tried to buy tickets
through the lottery and then at
tempted to purchase alumni tick
ets with no luck.
With some perseverance, Kuffn
er finally succeeded. "I begged and
pleaded."
With the tickets secured,
Kuffner next contacted the Stan
ford Mendicants and the Viennese
Ball committee â€” the former to
serenade Akatsu and the latter for
permission to interrupt the ball.
Both groups agreed to Kuffner's
plan.
Kuffner said the evening was
unforgettable. "It was wonderful
to dance with my bride-to-be at the
Viennese Ball."
To continue their Stanford tra
dition, the wedding will be held in
Memorial Church on July 26.
Another Stanford couple took
their act to the shore.
Knowing that crew is an impor
tant part of his girlfriend's life, se

nior Alex Alviar chose to propose by
the water.
"I knew that he was going to
propose, and I even knew that he
had the ring; as far as when it
would happen and how it would
happen I didn't know," said his fi
ancee Janet Bucher, a senior.
On April 19, the women's varsity
crew team had just finished a race,
and Bucher, along with her team
mates, gathered around for the
christening of a new racing boat.
Having been told the boat had
been donated by an aged alumnus,
Bucher suspected nothing as the
ceremony progressed.
As the boat was unveiled, reveal
ing the name "Marime Janet," a
man in a bunny costume singled
her out from the crowd.
"It was really slow to all come to
gether," Bucher said. She read the
name of the boat but didn't realize
it was a proposal until Alviar pulled
off the head of the costume and got
down on his knee.
It turned out that Alviar had
helped donate the boat and so could

choose its name.
"I thought it was really sweet,"
Bucher said, "To combine two
hugely important aspects of my
life, those being crew and him."
The name- "Marime Janet,"
while subtle, holds special meaning
for those who know Alviar and
Bucher's stoiy.
"It was a way to put our special
moment into something concrete,
that could be seen and touched,"
Alviar said.
As for the bunny costume, Alviar
said that during his three-year rela
tionship with Bucher, he had given
her dozens of stuffed rabbits.
"So this time I figured I'd give
her myself as a stuffed rabbit,"
Alviar said.
Alviar and Bucher have been
dating since freshman year, when
they were dormmates in Gavilan.
The couple is planning the wed
ding for next spring, perhaps in the
Manzanita courtyard, next to Lan
tana, the dormitory that Alviar and
Bucher lived in their sophomore
year.
