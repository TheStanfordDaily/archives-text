# Marriage not an ordinary proposition
## 
### Clara Kim 
Showing not only that dating at
Stanford exists, but also that people
get engaged, two Stanford couples
chose unusual paths to the altar.
One couple danced the night
away and ended the evening with a
promise.
Last February during the Vien
nese Ball, doctoral student James
Kuffner arranged for the Mendi
cants to serenade his girlfriend,
Haruko Akatsu, a resident physi
cian at Stanford Hospital in the de
partment of Internal Medicine.
Then, while startled ball-goers
looked on, Kuffner dropped to one
knee and asked Akatsu to marry
him after producing a ring from his
pocket.

"There was this collective gasp,"
Kufiner said. "Everyone was so sur
prised."
When Akatsu was first called up
to the microphone hy sophomore
Carl Walters, musical director of
the Mendicants, she said she was
unaware of the events to transpire.
"First I thought maybe some
body was sick, but then how did
they know I'm a physician?" said
Akatsu.
After Kuffner joined Akatsu on
the stage, she figured out what was
going on. Akatsu managed to nod
her head "yes" when Kuffner
popped the question. Everyone
started cheering and congratulat
ing the happy couple.
