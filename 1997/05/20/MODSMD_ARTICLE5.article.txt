# Disability access to be improved this summer
## 
### T.J. Babbitt 
The University committed to making its major
auditoriums and the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center fully accessible to the disabled
yesterday.
Dean of Students Marc VVais, meeting with
members of the disabled community, also reiterat
ed the importance of hiring five permanent full
time employees for the Disability Resource Center.
This summer, the University will build an eleva
tor to allow disability access to the LGBCC at a cost
of $280,000, said Rosa Gonzalez, the associate di
rector of multicultural development who supervis
es compliance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
"I think there is a firm commitment by the Uni
versity to respond in a positive way to the needs of
the disabled," Wais said.
Many of the students who attended the meeting
were equally surprised when Gonzalez announced
that Memorial Auditorium, Cubberley Auditorium
and Encina Hall would be fully accessible by the be
ginning of fall quarter. "What the law mandates is
program access," she said.
In his opening comments, Wais said the H
month-old Disabled Community Cultural Center
would remain in Wilbur Hall pending a long-term
search for a new space. "We're here for at least an
other year," Wais said.
Students discussed the high turnover at the
DRC, which currently is without a permanent di
rector.
"I've been at Stanford for five years, longer than
any of the DRC staff members," said Bliss Temple,
a coterminal student. "Since I've been here there

have been, 19 professional staff members."
Wais said while he would not comment on the
hiring process, he hoped that student concerns
about staff turnover would be resolved. "The bot
tom line is that the University is committed to fill
ing five full-time permanent positions at the DRC,"
Wais said.

Freshman H'Sien Hayward
questioned the strength of the
University's commitment to the
needs of the disabled.
" I have a strong sense that there
is concern that they want to got
things done," Hayward said of the
administration, adding that the
University often seems too con
cerned with the costs associated

with making its facilities accessible.
"Rights shouldn't be sup
pressed just because they're ex
pensive," she said. "The bottom
line is, it's the law."
Students and administrators
who attended the meeting agreed
on the need to prioritize problems
of disability access.
"We need to ask the question:
what are your most pressing
needs?" Wais said.
Students in attendance said
they often felt left out of the
process of decision-making. Gon

zalez responded that the Universi
ty has made "serious efforts" to
ensure student participation on all
committees.
Another issue, raised by Tem
ple, was the desire for a paid direc
tor for the newly created student
center who cou Id act as an advocate
in any dealings with the adminis
tration.
Wais said that it was the first
time the issue had ever been
brought to his attention.
"What I'd like to see is a written
proposal," he said.
