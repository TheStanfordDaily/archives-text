## 
### T.J. Babbitt 
The University committed to making its major
auditoriums and the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center fully accessible to the disabled
yesterday.
Dean of Students Marc VVais, meeting with
members of the disabled community, also reiterat
ed the importance of hiring five permanent full
time employees for the Disability Resource Center.
This summer, the University will build an eleva
tor to allow disability access to the LGBCC at a cost
of $280,000, said Rosa Gonzalez, the associate di
rector of multicultural development who supervis
es compliance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
"I think there is a firm commitment by the Uni
versity to respond in a positive way to the needs of
the disabled," Wais said.
Many of the students who attended the meeting
were equally surprised when Gonzalez announced
that Memorial Auditorium, Cubberley Auditorium
and Encina Hall would be fully accessible by the be
ginning of fall quarter. "What the law mandates is
program access," she said.
In his opening comments, Wais said the H
month-old Disabled Community Cultural Center
would remain in Wilbur Hall pending a long-term
search for a new space. "We're here for at least an
other year," Wais said.
Students discussed the high turnover at the
DRC, which currently is without a permanent di
rector.
"I've been at Stanford for five years, longer than
any of the DRC staff members," said Bliss Temple,
a coterminal student. "Since I've been here there

have been, 19 professional staff members."
Wais said while he would not comment on the
hiring process, he hoped that student concerns
about staff turnover would be resolved. "The bot
tom line is that the University is committed to fill
ing five full-time permanent positions at the DRC,"
Wais said.
