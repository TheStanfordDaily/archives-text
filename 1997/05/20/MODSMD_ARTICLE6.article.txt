Twelve Stanford students were
voluntarily homeless last, weekend.
Ah part of a student-organized
class called "Faces of Homoless
ness," these students participated
in an activity allied the "Urban
Plunge," living as homeless people
for 48 hours.
The students spent the weekend
on the streets of Berkeley and San
Francisco with only 50 cents and a
sleeping bag each. They looked and
acted the part of homeless people,
dressing in old clothing, carrying
their belongings in garbage bags
and holding up cardboard signs
asking for money.
"This is an educational endeav
or, an awareness activity," said
Michael Stoops of the National
Coalition for the Homeless, an or
ganization based in Washington,
!).(!., that has been coordinating
Plunges across the nation since the
early 1980s. "This is very different
from doing a research paper, hear

ing a lecture or volunteering in a
soup kitchen," he explained.
Stoops arranged for a few home
less people to introduce the stu
dents to the city, telling them
where they might be able to find
food and safe spots for sleeping.
Aside from these few people, no
body on the streets knew the stu
dents' true identities.
"This was one of the best groups
of Plungers we've had," Stoops
said. "They related very well with
the homeless community."
The students collected food by
asking for leftovers from restau
rants and getting meals from char
ity agencies. They were able to get
throwaway fruit from a local farm
ers' market.
Senior Olivia Wang, an organiz
er of the class who participated in
the weekend project, was surprised
by the ease with which students
were able to attain food during the
weekend.
