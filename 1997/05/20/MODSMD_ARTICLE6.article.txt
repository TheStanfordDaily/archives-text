# Class spends two days on streets
## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
Twelve Stanford students were
voluntarily homeless last, weekend.
Ah part of a student-organized
class called "Faces of Homoless
ness," these students participated
in an activity allied the "Urban
Plunge," living as homeless people
for 48 hours.
The students spent the weekend
on the streets of Berkeley and San
Francisco with only 50 cents and a
sleeping bag each. They looked and
acted the part of homeless people,
dressing in old clothing, carrying
their belongings in garbage bags
and holding up cardboard signs
asking for money.
"This is an educational endeav
or, an awareness activity," said
Michael Stoops of the National
Coalition for the Homeless, an or
ganization based in Washington,
!).(!., that has been coordinating
Plunges across the nation since the
early 1980s. "This is very different
from doing a research paper, hear

ing a lecture or volunteering in a
soup kitchen," he explained.
Stoops arranged for a few home
less people to introduce the stu
dents to the city, telling them
where they might be able to find
food and safe spots for sleeping.
Aside from these few people, no
body on the streets knew the stu
dents' true identities.
"This was one of the best groups
of Plungers we've had," Stoops
said. "They related very well with
the homeless community."
The students collected food by
asking for leftovers from restau
rants and getting meals from char
ity agencies. They were able to get
throwaway fruit from a local farm
ers' market.
Senior Olivia Wang, an organiz
er of the class who participated in
the weekend project, was surprised
by the ease with which students
were able to attain food during the
weekend.
Another Plunge participant, se
nior Roy Jacob, agreed that food
was not hard to get but added
that it was time consuming. He
had to eat scraps out of a trash
can for breakfast because he had
gone to church on Sunday morn
ing.
Berkeley police ordered stu
dents to leave the park they at
tempted to sleep in on Friday
night. "It was so hard to find a
place to sleep without the police
bugging you," Jacob said.
Wang and Jacob were struck
by the difference in treatment
they received from passers-by
who were not homeless and
those who were.
"The people who treated us
nicely were other homeless peo
ple," said Wang. "The people who
didn't give us the time of day
were the nicely dressed people."
She described numerous in
stances where she asked people
passing by for the time and was
completely ignored, under the as
sumption that she only wanted
money.
"I was surprised how they
went out of their way to help
complete strangers," Jacob said
of the homeless people he met
during the weekend. He de
scribed a "world turned upside
down," in which those who
would normally be considered
well mannered and respectable
were rude and those who are
commonly viewed as uncivilized
homeless people were friendly
and helpful.
Wang expressed amazement
that many of the homeless peo
ple with which the students
came into contact believed they
were homeless. "I thought for
sure 1 was going to stick out like
a sore thumb, but some people
believed it," she said.
Not everyone was fooled, how
ever. "One homeless guy said I
looked like a yuppie," said Wang,
even though she was wearing
stained jeans and a torn shirt
and carrying her belongings in a
garbage bag.
The Plunge participants
agreed that the 48 hours they
spent on the streets weren't the
sane as actually being homeless
but added that the experience
was highly educational nonethe
less.
