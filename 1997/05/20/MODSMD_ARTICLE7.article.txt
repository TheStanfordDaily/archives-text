# Rainbow nursery school parents demand answers
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
Fearing that the integrity of
their children's nursery school ha.s
been endangered hy poor manage
ment, a substantial majority of
Rainbow School parents sent a hit
ter May (i to the Provost's Office,
questioning some recent decisions
hy the school's administrators.
The Rainbow School is a Univer
sity-run program that serves pri
marily Kscondido Village children
and provides child care and educa
tion for children. About 40 children,
ages 3 and 4, attend the school.
However, the highly regarded
school has been troubled by contro
versy in recent months. Rainbow
Director Jan Krinsley left the school

in December to take a position
teaching public school in Palo Alto.
A new director, Micki Cooley, was
hired after a 2 1/2 month search,
but she resigned shortly after she
was hired. She said she did not 112 ully
comprehend what the job would en
tail.
Joyce McClure, a teacher at the
school, resigned soon after Cooley
was hired. McClure said she re
signed because of a letter signed by
Cooley and Stanford's Worklife
Center Associate Director Dorothy
Steele questioning her ability to
work well with the staff. Days later,
she attempts to rescind her resig
nation but was unable to do so.
The letter to the provost also
questions the financial stability of
the Rainbow School. The writers
believe that due to low salaries, the
school was unable to hire effective
new staff and keep its old teachers.
According to one parent, Krins
ley left the school for a teaching po
sition in the Palo Alto school dis
trict possibly because of financial
motivations.
Worklife Center Director Kath
leen Sullivan disagreed, saying that
Krinsley left because lower class
size legislation created a demand
for more teachers and offered her a
window of opportunity. "It was not
due to job satisfaction," said Sulli
van. Krinsley declined to comment,
citing personal reasons.
After Krinsley resigned in De
cember, a search committee was
formed, composed of Steele, one
parent and the two remaining
teachers, McClure and Luce Jor
genson. After a search, Cooley was
hired as the new director. Accord
ing to Steele, all three voted to hire
Cooley.
Days after Cooley was hired, she
became frustrated with a misbe
having child. According to one par
ent, the child was looking for a way
to upset Cooley, and he grabbed her
glasses and threw them to the
ground. She then slapped the child
across the face.
That night, Cooley submitted
her resignation and wrote a letter to
the parents explaining her reasons
for leaving.
The writers of the letter criti
cized the administrators' handling
of Cooley's letter and the situation
in general. "Her statements indi
cate that she did not clearly under
stand the responsibilities of the job

that she had accepted, which re
flects poorly on those who hired
her," the letter said. "In her letter,
Micki did not admit to or apologize
for hitting the child. We never re
ceived any apology or explanation
from Dorothy."
Steele said that it was clear from
the start that Cooley's position was
a teacher / director job, as it was
stated directly in the job posting.
However, Steele said Cooley did not
realize the impact the job would
have on her.
McClure said she questioned the
hiring of Cooley as director from
the beginning because she felt she
lacked teaching experience.
"I felt that on her resume there
was no teaching position indicat
ed," McClure said, "so I was con
cerned about that issue since was
she was supposed to be the lead
teacher. If she's never been a
teacher, she's not the best candi
date."
Another issue the letter address
es is the handling of McClure's situ
ation. McClure said she was given a
letter March 7 signed by Steele and
Ccoley. The letter said she "didn't
get along with of (her] colleagues,
and it's makingit impossible to plan
and implement and evaluate a good
program."
McClure, however, questions
the implication that she was unco
operative. "I thought I was really
doing a superb job, and I was really
getting along with all the parents
and the staff," McClure said. How
ever, she did believe that she possi
bly angered her supervisors when
she questioned her salary and
health plan.
McClure said she informed Coo
ley that she wished to resign. She
later left messages on Sullivan's
and the school's answering ma
chines confirming her resignation.
A few days later, McClure at

tempted to rescind her resignation
and talked with the personnel de
partment about getting a mediator
to work out their differences. How
ever, according to McClure, Steele
did not support bringing McClure
back.
One parent felt the administra
tion did not properly handle the res
ignation of either Cooley or Mc-
Clure. Despite some parent re
quests to bring back McClure, the
parent felt her input was ignored.
"Communication has not been
terrific," the parent said. "On that
whole issue of Joyce, I've been very
dissatisfied with how they've han
dled this. They kept saying this is a
privacy issue, because of personnel
hiring processes."
Both McClure and Sullivan said
they have made every effort to com
municate their feelings with the
parents, including sending out let
ters and having meetings.
The letter's conclusion asks the
Provost's Office to "consider
whether Dorothy Steele's future re
sponsibilities should include over
seeing the Rainbow School."
Despite this, Steele said she is
not going anywhere, as she is fully
qualified for the position and enjoys
working with the Rainbow School
program.
Both McClure and parents agree
that the school's program is strong,
although it still needs improve
ments.
"The school has a lot of poten
tial, so if there are any financial or
managerial reasons that are hold
ing it back from being better, we
would like those fixed," said one
parent.
Sullivan said she feels that with
the addition of the new director
(Jennifer Casper, who started May
12), the school will be a stronger
program and the problems of the
past will be erased.
