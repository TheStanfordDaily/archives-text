It's been almost 1 year since our store burned down, but we're back on our feet and
ready to blend! Grab a friend and swing on by for a Citrus Squeeze, Strawberries Wild,
Razzmatazz, or any of our delirious smoothies. They're being whipped up by the same
friendly folks at the same great location! To celebrate, we've added some juicy new
items to our menu! Come in for a taste!
