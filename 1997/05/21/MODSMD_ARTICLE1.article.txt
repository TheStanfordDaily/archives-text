### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — How perfectly fitting
that up 3-0, with four grueling three-set
matches in progress, it was Stanford senior
Grant Elliott who delivered the Cardinal a
third consecutive NCAA championship.
Fans rushed court 6 of the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center, screaming their undying apprecia
tion for Elliott, and carried the team captain
around the court. Elliott made a Cardinal
dream come true, giving Stanford its sixth
NCAA title this year, more than any school had
ever achieved in one academic year.
"This is a moment I will never forget," El
liott said. "It's like, euphoria."
Stanford faced its toughest competition in
the tournament against the Bulldogs, begin
ning with doubles play.
Stanford took a dominating lead in the dou
bles, but the Bulldogs quickly figured out that
winning points was the successful way to quiet
Stanford fans, staying neck-and-neck with
Stanford in the doubles early on. Stanford fans
did not like many of the Bulldogs' line calls
early on in the match, voicing their dissent
with shouts of "Captain Hook" and "Midnight
Train to Georgia" between points.
Despite the emotional fans off the courts,
competition for the doubles remained tight on
the court. While 41st-ranked sophomore Ryan
Wolters and junior Paul Goldstein led 4-2 on

court 1, freshman Geoff Abrams
and Elliott trailed 4-1. On court 2,
the "twin towers," Bob and Mike
Bryan, stayed close with Bulldogs'
Steven Baldas and Rafael Jordan
on serve at 3-2.
But the Bryans quickly pulled
ahead, playing Australian doubles
with Bob at net and Mike serving
to leave the Bulldogs in the dust,
going up 6-3. Meanwhile Gold
stein's crushing serve and
Wolters' dominant net play
proved too much for 14th-ranked
John Roddick and Kevin Sessions,
putting them up 7-3.
On match point, Wolters
crushed a return of serve down
the line which Goldstein thought
was in, but Georgia called out. Yet
the Card still prevailed, as the
Bulldogs missed their next
ground stroke long, giving Stan
ford the No. 1 doubles match 8-3.
While Bryan and Bryan went
up 7-4, Abrams and Elliott battled
back on court 3, storming back to
tie Hisham Hemeda and Eddie
Jacques 5-5. But all that Stanford
needed was one more doubles
match to take the lead, and the
Bryans delivered, knocking off

12th-ranked Steven Baldas and
Rafael Jordan 8-5.
Leading 1-0 going into the sin
gles, Bob Bryan took an early 4-1
lead against Jacques in the No. 2
singles, while Abrams blasted
ahead to a first-set drubbing of
Sessions 6-1 at the No. 5 position.
On court 4, Goldstein took a 5-1
lead over Hemeda.
But Elliott stayed on par with
Jordan on court 6 as Jacques
fought back to stay in the first set
with Bob Bryan. The Bulldog took
four consecutive games to tie the
set at 4-4.
On court 1, Wolters refused to
give into John Roddick, fighting
back from a 5-2 deficit before
falling in the first set 6-3.
On court 2, in a marathon
baseline battle at 6-5, Bob Bryan
jubilantly screamed "Wide!" when
Jacques finally missed, giving the
freshman the first set. Soon after,
his brother Mike dropped the first
set to Baldas on court three.
Goldstein fought off Hemeda
6-3, 6-4 to give Stanford a 2-0
lead.
"I was nervous about how I
would be able to fight back,
because I have not had match play
in so long," Goldstein said.
But the five other matches
were not over, as all remaining
singles matches were in three sets.

It was then that Abrams put
Stanford up 3-0, fighting off Ses
sions, 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2.
"Victories like Geoffs against
top players like Sessions are truly
remarkable," Elliott said.
"Winning the championship
. . . it is unbelievable, it is ridicu
lous," Abrams said.
Fans scurried around the sta
dium, looking for one more Cardi-

nal victory to give Stanford the
championship.
When Elliott delivered with a
3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win, the celebration
began.
"We were proud of what we
accomplished today," said Geor
gia head coach Manuel Diaz.
"We just came up a little bit
short."
"It has been a remarkable four
years," Elliott said. "The guys are
so special to me. I am going to
miss them."
