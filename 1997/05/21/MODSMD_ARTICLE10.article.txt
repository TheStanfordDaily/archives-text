# Israeli gov't analyzed in ardent speech
## 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
The blame for the recent breakdown in
the Middle East peace process should be
placed largely on the shoulders of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Rashid Khalidi told an audience at Bechtel
International Center last night.
Khalidi is a professor of Middle Eastern
history at the University of Chicago and
president of the American Committee on
Jerusalem. In addition, he served as an ad
viser to the Palestinian delegation at the
Madrid and Washington Arab-Israeli negoti
ations from October 1991 to June 1993.
According to Khalidi, Netanyahu's Con
servative government — which came to
power last year — has reneged on virtually
every promise made to the Palestinians by
the preceding Labor government.
The building of new settlements in
Jerusalem is just one example. "Jerusalem is
the iceberg on which this peace process is
sinking," Khalidi said.
In going back on its word, the Israeli gov
ernment is essentially mocking the Palestin
ian negotiators and telling them that agree

ments with past Israeli governments are
meaningless, Khalidi explained.
Netanyahu is reverting to "the old style of
Israeli politics," which involves playing off
"anti-terrorist" sentiments, Khalidi said.
He added that Netanyahu's callousness is
also having a negative impact on Israel's re
lations with Jordan and other countries with
which it has important economic relations.
If economic ties grow, Khalidi argued, the
rest of the Arab world will support the Pales
tinians less. This would actually help the Is
raeli negotiating position. Yet, according to
Khalidi, the Netanyahu government seems
to care little about the growing disillusions
in those countries.
"The Netanyahu government is doing ir
reparable damage ... to Arab-Israeli recon
ciliation," Khalidi said.
According to Khalidi, the Israeli govern
ment basically believes it can get anything it
wants because of the Jewish influence in the
United States. "They believe they can get it
all," he said.
Many Jewish Americans probably do not
think Netanyahu is in Israel's best interests,
Khalidi explained, but they have remained
relatively quiet.

President Clinton, meanwhile is "mes
merized" by the pro-Israel lobby in Washing
ton, Khalidi said. "Anyone who has power
basically has Clinton in the palm of his
hand."
"I think [the Israelis] are right," Khalidi
said. "They pretty much can do anything
they want."
He added that although Netanyahu may
think that Arabs do not care about
Jerusalem, in reality, it is "central to his
toric memory" for Arabs and Jews.
The Israeli government's hard-line stance
will come at the expense of Israelis — most of
whom want reconciliation and are willing to
make concessions in Jerusalem to achieve it,
Khalidi said.
It is the Palestinians who will suffer most
from the indefinite continuation of the sta
tus quo, he added.
The United States gives between $6 and
$8 billion annually to Israel, Khalidi noted.
It is the American people who give the gov
ernment there the wherewithal to act as it
does.
Khalidi s speech was sponsored in part by
the Organization of Arab-American Stu
dents in Stanford.
