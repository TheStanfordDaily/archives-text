Mary Ann Breen, 62, chef at Slavianskii
Dom passed away following a car accident on
Highway 1 Sunday shortly before midnight. •
The accident occurred when a women head
ing southbound in a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina
crossed into oncoming traffic on Highway 1 in
San Mateo County. Breen's Dodge van collided
head-on with the car.
California Highway Patrol Officer S.L. Hol
loway said officers at the scene of the accident
did not indicate in the accident report why the
Lumina drifted across the center line on High
way 1.
The driver of the car died at the scene of the
accident, but Breen and her daughter, Eliza
beth Elder, did not. Elder had been driving at
the time of the accident. She was taken to Mills-
Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame and is cur
rently in stable condition.
Breen was taken directly from the scene to
Seton Medical Center in Daly City. She was

conscious during transport and was able to
speak with some family members. She died
from complications on Monday afternoon.
Breen owned her own catering company, New
Moon Catering. She had worked at Slav Dom for
seven years and was basically the house mom, se
nior Errin Anderson said.
Anderson, the former kitchen manager at
Slav Dom, had known Breen for three years. Al
though no longer the kitchen manager, she has
been helping out with the cooking for the past
few days.
Anderson and some other residents will con
tinue to pitch in to help until John Elder,
Breen's son, takes over some time next week.
Her son, affectionately known as Johnny,
cooks for the neighboring house Theta Xi and
will take on both cook positions for the remain
der of the year.
Breen was much more than a house cook to
the residents. "Many people looked forward to
seeing her smiling face every day. She was al
ways willing to listen and ready to give advice,"

Anderson said.
Andrea Fisher Chartock, a coterminal stu
dent and the resident assistant of the house,
said, "I have only known Mary Ann for about a
year, but she will definitely be missed."
At the emergency house meeting held Mon
day evening to discuss the loss of Breen, a resi
dent said that she was the "soul of Slav Dom."
Chartock added that she knows the whole
house will miss Breen, but she personally ap
preciates her for her caring and sharing.
"She was one of the only constants in our
lives. She was always in the kitchen, giving en
couragement and willing to chat, just like a
mother," Chartock said, adding that everyone
in the house felt comfortable going to visit her.
Memorial services will be held during the
first week of June. As a house memorial, An
derson said that a plaque saying "Mary Ann's
Kitchen" will be placed on the kitchen wall. The
house also plans to plant a rose bush outside
the house in memory of Breen's love for gar
dening and roses.
