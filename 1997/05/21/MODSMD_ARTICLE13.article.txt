A reception at the Faculty Club
yesterday honored outstanding
contributors to the undergraduate
advising program.
Six advisers, selected by the Un
dergraduate Advising Center staff
from student nominations, re
ceived new Outstanding Adviser
Awards. Winners included Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy,
Mark Delia Bona, Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Judith Goldstein,
Thomas Gragg, Institute for Inter
national Studies Financial Manag
er Lucia Hammar and Robert
Hamrdla of Overseas Studies.
According to Lori White, direc
tor of the advising center, out
standing advisers were chosen
based on their availability and ap
proachability, knowledge of gener
al academic curriculum and acade
mic resources and demonstrated
interest in the intellectual and per
sonal development of students.
Photographs of the outstanding
advisers will be displayed on the
first floor of Sweet Hall — along
with awards for excellence in teach
ing by faculty and awards for
achievement by students — to rec
ognize "the importance of advising
to undergraduate education,"
White said.
Senior James Miyashiro, who
has been Ham mar's advising asso
ciate for two years, attributed
Hammar's success to the "personal
interest" she takes in students.
"She made it fun for all of us,"
Miyashiro added.
Chemistry within the group is
key, Delia Bona agreed. "Half of the
success of advising comes from the
group of advisees," he said.
After knowing Abernethy as
both a teacher and an adviser,
freshman Yonatan Eyal said,"his
contribution to my academic career
has been one of the highlights of my
freshman experience at Stanford."
There is little doubt that Aber
nethy has made a difference for
freshman Holda Biskeborn. During
the year, Abernethy hinted that in

ternational relations was the right
field for Biskeborn. The freshman
recently realized that she really
does want to pursue that major.
"You can tell [Abernethy] really
puts a lot into advising," explained
senior Oliver Wang, the head AA at
Cedro, where Eyal and Biskeborn
live.
Abernethy himself was much
less outspoken about his achieve
ments; he promised to water the
aluminum plant he received with
his award and noted the contribu
tion of AAs to the program.
During the reception, AA coor
dinator Allen Chi, a senior, recog
nized some of the outstanding stu
dent participants in advising. After
working as the Kimball head AA
for the last two years, senior
Shahriar Heidary received th<
Outstanding Commitment to Ad
vising Award.
The Henry Tien Memorial
Award went to Naranja head AA
Mona Parandkar, a senior. Parand
kar was said to personify the spirit
of Tien, the Paloma head AA who
died during a spring break accident.
Recognized with the Academic
Advising Service Award of Distinc
tion were AAs senior Jimmy Maas,
sophomore Cheryl Tam, senior
Tracey Schultz, junior Helen Vo
and senior Paul Wang.
"It's good to know that you're
appreciated, and people notice your
efforts," Vo said.
Asst. Material Sciences Engi
neering Prof. Richard Vinci, an ad
viser who works with Vo, described
her as "the best AA on the planet."
White presented awards to the
Civil Engineering and Physics de
partments as well as the Feminist
Studies Program for outstanding
advising of majors.
Advisers with many years of ser
vice were also recognized by the
center's staff.
Delighted "at the way students
turned out to support advising,"
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Ramon Saldivar applauded
the organizers for rewarding adviser
contributions and letting students
know that "we listen, and we care."
