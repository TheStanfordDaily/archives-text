## Senate passes ban on 'partial-birth' abortions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate yesterday passed a bill out
lawing a controversial late-term
abortion procedure, but fell three
votes short of the two-thirds major
ity needed to override an expected
veto by President Clinton.
The vote was 64-36, with even
Democratic leader Tom Daschle,
whose attempt at compromise
failed last week, voting for the
Republican bill. "It is not an easy
decision because I favor a women's
right," Daschle said on the Senate
floor moments after the vote.
The bill's lead sponsor, Sen.
Rick Santorum, R-Pa., passion
ately implored colleagues to follow
the American Medical Association
and support the ban on what
abortion opponents call "partial
birth" abortions.
The AMA endorsed the bill
Monday after its sponsors, includ
ing Santorum, agreed to technical
changes, which the Senate also
approved yesterday. The AMA had
declined to endorse it last week
and remained neutral.
"We worry so much about the
right to choose," Santorum said in
closing the three-hour debate.
"What about the right to choose
life?"
The bill would outlaw the pro

cedure except when a woman is at
risk of death and no other medical
procedure can be used to end the
pregnancy.
But abortion-rights advocates,
including Clinton, oppose it
because it doesn't include excep
tions for when the health of a
woman is at risk.
"This bill does harm," said Sen.
Barbara Boxer, I)-Calif., one of
the Senate's strongest abortion
rights advocates. "Colleagues,
please do not relegate women to
the status that says . . . their
health does not matter."
Boxer noted that the American
Medical Women's Association
opposes the bill. The American
College of Obstetricians and Gyne
cologists, the leading medical orga
nization in women's health care,
also objects to it on grounds that it
is "inappropriate, ill-advised and
dangerous" for lawmakers to med
dle in medical decision-making.
The House must approve the
amended version of the bill before
it can be sent to Clinton for his
threatened veto.
Clinton vetoed a similar bill last
year and has promised to do so
again because the measure doesn't
provide an exemption when
women's health is at risk.
