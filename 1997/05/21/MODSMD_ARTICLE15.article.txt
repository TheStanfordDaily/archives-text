KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -
Triumphant rebel leader Lau
rent Kabila arrived without fan
fare yesterday in Kinshasa, qui
etly laying claim to the capital of
the country he plotted and
fought for three decades to cap
ture.
Kabila — the new ruler of
Zaire, which he has renamed the
Democratic Republic of the
Congo — (lew unannounced into
Kinshasa's airport, breaking into
a broad grin when he stepped
onto the tarmac dressed casually
in a blue-gray open-necked shirt.
Top aides lined up to greet him.
One well-wisher stood across
the street from the airport, wav
ing the blue-and-white flag of
Kabila's alliance. "I believe it
should be possible to organize
elections within six months,"
Ferdinand Nakemanda said.
Until a downpour dispersed
them, thousands of other Kin
shasa residents had lined the city's
streets during the day hoping to
welcome the man who had ended
Mobutu Sese Seko's 31 -year dicta
torship — and who promised to
bring them democracy.
When his motorcade swept
through the dark, rain-glistening
streets, residents still walking
home were quick to recognize

that Kabila had arrived. Startled,
they burst into cheers and waved
his convoy on.
Kabila's motorcade — led by
two military trucks, with Kabila
himself traveling in a four-wheel
drive vehicle with darkened win
dows — ended at the residence
usually reserved for the prime
minister.
"We have finally vanquished
31 years of suffering," well wish
er Nbula Akawa, who had (rav
eled 19 miles to welcome Kabila,
declared earlier in the day.
But democracy might have to
wait a while.
While Kabila's alliance said
yesterday it was committed to
multiparty elections within 12
months — a guarantee that the
United States and other Western
nations had pressed Kabila to
make — it said it would be the
sole power in Congo until then.
Fellow opponents to Mobutu's
rule would be welcome in the
government for the time being,
but only as individuals and not as
representatives of political par
ties, Kabila's aides said.
"We have a lot of work. I don't
think this is the time to fracture
the country," said Kabila's
finance minister, Mwnna Nanga
Mawampanga.
