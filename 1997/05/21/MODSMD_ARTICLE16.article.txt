Albert could be sentenced to five years to life in prison if he is
convicted of the forcible sodomy charge, prosecuting attorney

particularly basketball. Besides his work for NBC, he is the television
voice of the New York Knicks.
Congress debates balanced-budget plan
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House moved toward stamping its
bipartisan approval yesterday on an outline of the budget-balancing
deal between President Clinton and legislative leaders, the first show

of sentiment by either chamber of Congress on the agreement.
Passage seemed assured for the plan, which promises to eliminate
deficits by 2002 while cutting taxes for many families, investors and
college students. Even so, the debate proceeded against a backdrop
smacking of presidential politics.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, I)-Mo., a possible White
House contender in 2000, split with the administration and said he
would oppose the deal Ile argued that it bore favorable treatment for
the rich that would help produce "a deficit of principle, a deficit of
fairness."
