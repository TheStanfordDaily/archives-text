Seminars should allow
freshmen to form solid
faculty bonds quickly

AT A BIG university like Stan
ford, big ideas are tossed
around all the time. The
world's greatest thinkers,
researchers and teachers are here,
and someone always has a new idea
about how something could be done
better.
It's rare, though, for one of those
ideas to find the full support of the
administration and faculty and to
be developed into a working pro
gram for the students in an efficient
manner. Thus, the people involved
in launching the new freshman
seminars program have offered it a
propitious beginning.
Announced just one year ago, the
freshman seminars are part of the
Stanford Introductory Studies pro
gram that University President
Gerhard Casper has explained is
designed to provide a better basis
for students as they begin their
Stanford careers.
Introductory studies includes
everything in a student's first two
years, including the Cultures, Ideas
and Values and Writing and Critical
Thinking programs as well as
sophomore seminars and Sopho
more College. The programs direct
ed at sophomores have rave
reviews during the few years of
their existence, proving that small
group interaction with top profes
sors provides a vital service to a
developing student.
But the sophomore programs are
open to a limited number of stu
dents. In contrast, about 70 fresh
man seminars already are planned
for next year — a huge commitment
for an inaugural year — and there is
funding available for 100, which at
16 students per class will allow
every freshman to take part.
Small size is essential to the suc
cess of the seminars. They can pro

vide their vital service of introduc
ing students to a discipline in an
effective manner only if professors
can make individual students feel
they have a personal stake in the
class.
Even with the existing small
group classes for freshman like CIV
and freshman writing, it's hard for
students to establish a good rapport
with a professor during their fresh
man year. But with a cap at 16, each
freshman taking a seminar will
have only 15 people to compete with
for the professor's attention, a sig
nificant improvement over the 200
in Econ 1 or Chem 31.
Professors, too, need to take ini
tiative in the situation. Although
students who have taken sopho
more seminars agree that they have
built good relationships with their
seminar professors, professors
should make sure to take full advan
tage of the small class size to ensure
no one gets lost.
Advising is a constant complaint
among Stanford students, along
with their counterparts at most col
leges and universities. The system
has been studied and revised and
studied some more, but the solution
seems elusive.
Freshman seminars present one
of the most promising options for
grabbing students while they're at
their most enthusiastic about Stan
ford's academic possibilities.
Still, the program is in a trial
phase and needs to be approached
with caution. Although there are no
plans right now to make freshman
seminars required, that possibility
has not been ruled out.
Such a change, however, would
severely decrease the overall value
of the program, as any student will
readily admit that a "required"
stamp can ruin even a good class.
The key to setting up the right
atmosphere for drawing students to
Stanford's academics is providing a
vast variety of seminars taught by
committed professors with the full
backing of the University adminis
tration. And the new freshman sem
inars program seems to do just that.
