# Stanford stakes claim as top program with record

Stanford's national championship tally now
stands at six — and counting.
With men's tennis' victory over the Georgia
Bulldogs last night, Stanford broke the record
for most NCAA championships won by a single
school in an academic year. The Cardinal made
history yesterday, reasserting its dominance in
the world of collegiate athletics.
The women's tennis team's crown, earned
with a victory over Florida in Sunday's NCAA
final, tied the record shared by UCLA and Stan
ford of five titles in one year.
While USC won five in 1962-63 and 1967-68,
these included sports which were not NCAA
sanctioned. In 1962-63, the Trojans captured
titles in football, baseball, track, swimming and
tennis, and in 1967-68 they won swimming,
women's volleyball, men's volleyball and both
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women and United States Tennis Association
titles in women's tennis.
UCLA won five NCAA titles in 1981-82, the
first year the NCAA governed women's
sports.
However, this decade has been all Stanford,
with the Cardinal winning five twice, first in
1991-92 and most recently in
1994-95.
In 1992, the Card brought
home rings in women's basketball,
men's and women's swimming and
diving, men's gymnastics and
men's tennis. Stanford squads
repeated the feat in 1995, racking
up titles in women's swimming
and diving, men's gymnastics,
men's tennis, women's volleyball
and men's water polo.
The Cardinal came tantalizing
ly close to the record sixth champi
onship that year as golf, featuring
a freshman Tiger Woods and four
senior All-Americans, came within
a single birdie putt of the title but
failed to put Oklahoma State away
in regulation play. The Cowboys

won on the first playoff hole.
Last year was an "off year,
with only men's tennis and
women's swimming going the dis
tance. In contrast, this year began
promisingly enough, with the Car
dinal grabbing three titles, in
men's and women's cross country
and women's volleyball, before the
start of the new year.
However an optimistic outlook
dimmed considerably with Stan
ford hitting a major winter quarter
slump. Men's and women's swim
ming and diving and women's bas
ketball all fell just short of their
respective crowns, with the swim
mers taking a pair of second-place
finishes and hoops falling in a Final
Four heartbreaker. Men's volley
ball finally broke the dry spell last
month and set the stage for tennis
to bring the record home.
"It feels great to be able to be
part of the six championships and

give something back to the Univer
sity after they have been so good to
us," said Stanford men's tennis
captain Grant Elliott.
I lisjunior teammate Paul Gold
stein readily agreed.
"It definitely adds another ele
ment to winning the champi
onship," he said.
For all its significance however,
the record may be enhanced before
the weekend ends. Sixth-ranked
women's golf could earn a seventh
title, making its run today through
Saturday at the NCAA Champi
onships in Columbus, Ohio. Top
seeded baseball will also have an
opportunity to add to the total as
the sluggers begin their march to
the College World Series tomorrow
with a regional matchup against
Northeastern.
