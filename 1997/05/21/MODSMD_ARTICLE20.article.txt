## You think you're busy?! 
### 
SO IT'S 26 days until graduation, and
I've still got to finish my thesis, and
write a few more papers, and a few
more columns for The Daily, and read a
few more books for classes. And my mom
is badgering me about what I'm wearing
for graduation, and my dad is badgering
me about my nonexistent job search. And
I'm spending my last month at Stanford
locked in my apartment, sitting in front of
my Powerßook, while it's 100 degrees out
side and there's no air conditioning. And
for fun, my boyfriend has rented "Head,"
an old Monkees movie. That's right, the
Monkees. For fun.
And my friends, the non-slackers, are
finishing their theses, and leaving me
drunk messages on my answering
machine, and asking me out, and I have
to say no. And last night I dreamed that
one of my professors was stalking me,
and my friends ganged up on me (still the
dream) because I had posed for Pent
house. And basically my life feels like it's
spiraling down a perpetually hot, dirty
tunnel. You're probably thinking I'm ter
ribly narcissistic. And you're also proba
bly thinking that I just need to stop whin
ing and deal. And you're probably right,
but sometimes it just feels good to bitch.
I love getting into bitch sessions with
Stanford friends because invariably, it
turns into a contest to see who has more
work, more appointments and more
stress. Everyone's an RA, on six zillion
committees, plays in the Band, edits The

Daily, works at the Co Ho, is double
majoring in art history and nuclear
physics, tutors disadvantaged kids and is
taking 21 units — the extra one for high
impact aerobics at 6 a.m. It's kind of
therapeutic to win these little who's
more-stressed battles, even if it takes a
few deft little lies — it vindicates your
pain, gives you a little ego boost, you
know the drill. It's even kind of motiva
tional when everyone else is feeling the
same way.
But seeing as how I've taken of late to
avoiding contact with anything that
doesn't have a keyboard, I've begun to
search out new and improved ways of
relieving late-quarter stress and motiva
tion problems. Some people I know use
negative enforcement tactics to make
themselves work — they'll post their
grades up and highlight all the bad ones
to remind themselves of past failures. Or
they'll go to the 24-hour study room in
Meyer Library. I tend to take a more pos
itive approach.
One of my favorites is creating these
elaborate mental fantasy worlds in which
my life is like a movie, if I can just get this
one paper done. In my fantasies I'm
invariably on a tropical island some
where, and it's warm but not too warm,
and I'm eating mangos and reading the
New Yorker cover to cover. And some
thing that sounds like Sade music is in
the background, and my boyfriend is
with me, and there's loads of rum and

reggae and dancing, and dinner is long
and lazy, and time is never an issue. In
my perfect world, there's no such thing
as high-impact aerobics, and the Mon
kees never existed.
But pretty soon I realize that my fan
tasy world is something out of a travel
brochure, and I've gotten nowhere on my
thesis. And I'm thrown back into the
enormity of the work at hand, and I start
biting my nails because I can't smoke
anymore. And 19th-century fashion —
the topic of my thesis — seems ever more
inscrutable. And I start getting upset,
because it's 5:00 Tuesday night and I
haven't thought of a decent column idea,
and I've bored you with the lame minuti
ae of my life for the last 600 words, and
the next 50 aren't going to get much
more interesting.
And I start feeling like the self-con
scious, melancholy Woody Allen charac
ter in all his later films. And I can predict
the calls and e-mails from the concerned
people out there who'll try to build up my
self-esteem and get me to a yoga class or
something. I don't know if that would
work, though. At this point, all I really
need is a cigarette and an extension.

thought and literature, apologizes for
using this space for therapeutic bitching.
