Dean's office should be wary of 6 undue intervention 9

Recent developments in
the tenure case of Asst. Anthro
pology Prof. Akhil Gupta raise a
serious question.
Surrounding this particular case is an
impression of bias, a perception shared
by colleagues at Stanford and those
within both the national and interna
tional community of scholars. We believe
that this should lead the dean's office to
be absolutely sure that, whatever deci
sion it reaches, it reaches that decision
without even a hint of bias or improper
procedure.
Specifically, it has been suggested
that there is significant bias in the
dean's office against sociocultural
anthropology. We do not imagine that
any of us is without preferences as to
the way knowledge should be formulated
and articulated; that is only natural.

But the proper venue for debate and
institutional "adjustments" to disci
plinary practice should be within the
departments themselves. The depart
ments, having reached some consensus,
hire individuals to serve those teaching
and research goals. If, in the course of a
junior faculty's pretenure, probationary
period, department goals shift, that
change in direction should not, and must
not, in any way affect the evaluation of
that individual for promotion and tenure
— he or she was recruited to do particu
lar work. It is unfair (and illegal) to
penalize that person simply for fulfilling
his or her charge.
However, Gupta's case is ' "ne in
which the department refused to rec
ommend tenure. It voted unanimously
for promotion with tenure, despite and
above individual disciplinary tastes.

The rejection came at the dean's level.
We are deeply concerned that it appears
that through this tenure decision the
dean's office is, consciously or not,
attempting to effect a de facto reorien
tation of the department. This would
bode very ill for Stanford — not only in
terms of losing one of its brightest and
most innovative scholar / teachers but
also of setting a precedent for undue
and improper intervention. This case is
being watched most carefully by a wide
audience — it is our sincere hope that
the dean's office will act in a truly
unimpeachable manner.
