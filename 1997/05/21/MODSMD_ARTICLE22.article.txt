# Oxfeld's column reeked of egotism and insults
## 
### 
Last week, my friends and I chuckled
at the slightly pathetic attempt by
columnist Jesse Oxfeld to list, for all the
campus to see, the numerous television
and radio interviews he had conducted
concerning Chelsea Clinton. Disguised
as a feeble column about pundits,
Oxfeld apparently wanted everyone to
know just how important he is.
This Tuesday, however, Oxfeld went
even farther. His column about the
institution of democracy was possibly
the single worst piece of newspaper writ

ing I have ever been subjected to. It is
appalling to me that he would use his
position as a columnist to, first, try to
lessen the "embarrassment" of losing a
personal election (and try somehow to
"save face") and, second, insult all of the
staff members and the newly elected edi
tor in chief of The Daily in the process.
What kind of egotistical writer uses
his power as a columnist to explain why
he lost an election of any sort? Is this
the biggest case of sour grapes anyone
has ever seen or what? Fine, write an
asinine piece about the failings of
democracy. But don't completely under
mine your point by unabashedly reveal
ing all of your ulterior motives for
doing so. A few token quotes from for

mer prime ministers and presidents
cannot hide those.
What about the woman who was,
fairly and decisively, elected editor in
chief? She no doubt has the journalistic
integrity (probably a main reason the
Daily staff chose her) not to use more
space in The Daily to reply to Oxfeld's
insults by telling why in fact she was
more qualified than him. So now she
starts her term with some tainted repu
tation in the eyes of those foolish
enough to believe a word he says.
The Daily staff is also assuredly
insulted by this column. What makes
Oxfeld believe that it was merely the fact
that he did his job well and in the pro
cess insulted some people that caused

him to lose? Maybe the Daily staff knew
they could never answer to someone so
consumed by a desire to advance his own
personal agenda. Is it not possible that
an editor could do his or her job correct
ly and also gain the respect of the people
he or she is working with?
I hope that a column such as this
one does not appear again in The Daily.
It is insulting to my friends and me
who ordinarily enjoy the writing that
The Daily publishes to read such a bla
tant attempt by a writer to boost his
own status and put down others at the
same time. Frankly, Jesse, no one cares
to hear it.
