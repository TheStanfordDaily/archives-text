# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Life will pass you by, unless you have a nitro-booster 
### 
IF YOU WALK into Durand nowa
days, you'll notice a strange hum
ming and whirring noise coming out
of the lounge. If you look closer you'll see
a few Stanford students staring intently
at the television set. And if you look even
closer, you'll begin to notice that their
souls have been kidnapped and their
hands have been replaced with video
game controllers.
Super Nintendo has taken over our
lounge.
At first, it just sat there. "Oh, it's
Jay's friend's," people would say, turn
ing on The Simpsons or SCBN or sitting
down innocently to study with Letter
man on in the background. Then, slow
ly, with its controller-like tentacles, it
sucked everyone in. One by one, it
spread like a rare tropical disease until
the entire house became afflicted by the
need to play that stupid car racing game
on the Nintendo.
And, for purely journalistic purposes, I
decided to learn how to play as well.
Top Gear 11, it's called — but no one

knows what it's called because it is stuck
in that Game Console 24 hours a day.
And it's a simple game. You race around
the track trying not to hit anyone else
and trying to finish first. When you win,
you save up money to buy nicer car parts
such as engines and armor.
Apparently, part of the game (this part
I learned from a somewhat demure friend
in the house) is to scream at the television
set as you play. From what I've observed,
screaming things such as "Fuck you, you
bastards!" and "Eat shit!" at the televi
sion screen makes your car go faster. If
you don't yell it loud enough, it appears, it
isn't effective and therefore you have to
scream it even louder the next time. I'm
not sure how this part of the computer
game works, but it worked for me, too.
Ain't technology grand?
Another part of the game is that you
aren't allowed to say something like
"Sure I'll play for two hours." The way
this game works in Durand is that who
ever takes the controller must, in order
for the game to work, say "OK, but I'll

play just one game because I have
[schoolwork, errands, surgeryl in 20 min
utes." Only then can one get behind the
wheel of their nitro-charged little red or
blue coupe and zoom through the streets
of Australia to lap the pack and win the
$10,000 grand prize.
Dormmates who have poked fun of
video games all year long were instantly
sucked in by the 210-mph intoxication
and the wind blowing through their
hair. X and Y chromosomes alike have
begun to memorize left and right turns
and make statements like "Ooh! This a
tough course in the rain" and "Watch
the hairpin on turn four" and "OK, this
is my last game!"
And people aren't just playing Top
Gear 11. They're watching other people
play it. At any point during the day,
there may be six to 10 people watching
two other people earn enough money to
buy new gearboxes or nitro-boosters in
hopes that when the players get tired,
the car will have an engine worth
$80,000 and full body armor and will be

a beautiful machine for them to play
"just one game."
There are, however, downsides, to the
thrill of the race in 64 bits of electronic
magic. One friend recently complained
that every time she sat down to study,
she would see purple and orange cars
zooming through her biology textbook.
"Motion sickness," she replied, taking a
Dramamine. She also had nightmares of
turns too tight and mismarked roads and
fellow dormmates crossing the virtual
track at inopportune times only to be
splattered by an overzealous race car as it
crossed the finish line in second place
(winning only $6,000).
Another downside to Top Gear II is
that Durand missed the heat wave of
late because no one bothered to go out
side. Why go outside, when you're just
$4,000 away from the ultimate nitro
booster? Why lie in the sun when you
can lie back into sixth gear and fly into
third place? The weather can wait —
you can't just take a pit stop in the mid
dle of the fourth lap!

The biggest concern I have with Top
Gear II is what happens when I get into
my real-life car (it's a Honda) and go for
a spin. I have to keep reminding myself
that 175 mph is not an acceptable speed
and crashing into the backs of the cars
in front of me is generally not such a
good idea. Also, if my car flips over, it
might actually take more than a few sec
onds to flip it back over and win the
race.
So if you see a house with a bunch of
cracked up cars out front and 30 people
riveted to the television set inside, it's
probably Durand. And feel free to come
on in and claim the next game.
Don't worry. It won't be long. I'll just
be playing one more.

Jeremy Desmon, a recent graduate in
public policy, wants you to know that it
wasn't Jenny who was saying all those
four-letter words. Honest.
