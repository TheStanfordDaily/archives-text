LOS ANGELES, Calif. -
Everyone at the NCAA Men's
Tennis Championships is elated
that Mike Bryan got a haircut. For
the first time all season, the naive
onlooker can distinguish between
the freshman tennis star and his
equally phenomenal brother, Bob.
Granted, the two identical 150-
pound brown-eyed twins from
Camarillo, Calif., are not exactly
the same.
Bob is left-handed, Mike is
right-handed. Bob lives in Laguni
ta, Mike lives in Wilbur. Bob
wears a necklace, Mike does not.
But the two tennis phenoms are
best friends, eternal doubles part
ners and rising stars in collegiate
tennis. So when the time came to
decide where they would play
their collegiate years, there was
no question wherever tennis took
them, they would be together.
"There was no doubt we would
go to school together," Mike said.
"There was never any question
about that," Bob said.
With their Wilson rackets,
intense court demeanor and boun
cy style of play, the two are diffi
cult to distinguish on the court as
well. Both brothers jump all over
the court between points, before
points, during points and after the
match.
"That is just the way we play,"
Mike said. "We have always done
that; it keeps us pumped up."
All season long, if they are not
on the court together playing dou
bles, they are only a court away
from each other in singles. Some
how, their energy still feeds off
each other, as the two will watch
each other between points, shout
ing words of encouragement.
"If Bob is winning, it always
pumps me up," Mike said.
Energy is one thing the dyna
mite duo has not lacked all season,
culminating in the team tourna
ment the past four days. Bob won
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships a few weeks ago, and Mike
came has had a dazzling spring
after missing the fall due to ten
dinitis, including an impressive
11-1 record at the No. 3 singles
position.
In their final dual match of the
season, Bob knocked off UCLA's
37th-ranked Alex Decret, as Mike

breezed past the Bruins' 34th
ranked Kevin Kim. Hob was
named Pac-10 player of the year
with teammate Ryan Wolters,
while Mike earned second-team
Pac-10 South honors.
But it was in the team champi
onships that the twins took oppo
nents by storm, thrashing top
seeded players. In the quarterfi
nals against Texas, Mike smoth
ered the Longhorns' Jack Brasing
ton 6-2, 6-1. In the semifinals
against Mississippi Bob Brvan
crushed the second-ranked player
in the nation, Sebastien
DeChaunac 6-1, 6-3. It is difficult
to ignore these two tennis fiends.
"The difference in the Stanford
team is the improvement that the
Bryan brothers have made," said
Rebels head coach Billy Chadwick
after his team fell to Stanford in
the semifinals.
Such dynamite play was evi
dent in their doubles play as well.
The 13th-ranked twins did not
lose a doubles match all week
together, ousting everyone who
crossed their path.

"I definitely love playing dou
bles with my brother," Bob said.
"We have played together our
whole lives, and we practice
together every day."
While they have all the entire
collegiate tennis world watching
as their exquisite play and passion
to win make them indistinguish
able, the brothers tell the secrets
behind what makes them differ
ent.
"Mike is so neat," Bob joked.
"He has to have everything in
order. He takes notes before a
match; all his stuff has to be in
place."
Mike bumps his brother and
laughs.
"Bob is more of a hothead than
me," Mike said. "I have to tell him
to keep it calm on the courts.
Today when we were warming up,
he wanted to hit the guy with an
overhead."
Although most of the world
cannot tell them apart, the two
seem to complement each other
perfectly. And they are still just
getting started.
