# Tennis season consistent despite Goldstein's injury
## 
### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Back on Nov. 29,
in its first match of the season against
Hawaii, no one could have dreamed its
season would amount to all this.
Although it lost three four-year
starters, the Stanford men's tennis
team still had a spectacular season, as
three experienced players and three tal
ented freshmen led to a 26-2 dual
match season.
The Card began the 1997 season
strong, winning five consecutive match
es without dropping a single set. The
Card defeated Hawaii, New Mexico,
Fresno State, San Diego State and
Washington before its winning streak
came to an end.
The top-ranked and top-seeded Card
was upset by 18th-ranked Kentucky 4-3

in the first round of the National Team
Indoors on Feb. 20 at Louisville, Ky.
The fast courts, which freshman Bob
Bryan called "greased lightning," were
too much for Stanford in the first
round, but it was able to bounce back,
defeating Texas and LSU in the conso
lation rounds.
Following the indoors, the Card
rolled over San Jose State, Oregon and
Southern Methodist without dropping a
match before opening Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division competition
against rival California.
The team was quickly becoming a
strong unit across the board, as the
leadership of the older players made the
incoming freshmen feel right at home.
"I love the team aspect of college ten
nis," said freshman Geoff Abrams fol
lowing the SMU match. "It was not like
that in the juniors. The guys are like

brothers to me, and the older ones are
real leaders."
In the season conference opener,
Stanford cruised past the Bears 7-0 and
went on to record victories over BYU,
Arizona, Arizona State and Pepperdine.
In five straight matches, the Card
appeared strong, never losing more
than one set in any match.

The Card traveled down south to fact:
the tough competition of Pac-10 rivals
UCLA and (JSC April A-T). Stanford suf
fered its second defeat and only confer
ence loss of the season to the Bruins 4-
3, while Stanford's No. 2 player, Ail-
American Paul Goldstein, wns sidelined
with a foot injury.
The Card held off the Trojans the
next day fi-l before closing out regular
season play with seven straight dual
match victories, with the help of junior
reserves Charles Hoeveler and Misha
Palecek.
On April 18-19, the Card christened
the opening of its new stadium in style,
sweeping the Southern California
schools. The Card took out USC 4-3 Fri
day and avenged its only conference loss
of the season Saturday, knocking off
top-ranked UCLA 4-3.
The victory gave Stanford a share of
the Pac-10 regular-season title with the
Bruins.
But it was at the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif., that Stanford let
it be known the Cardinal was hungry
for a third consecutive team title and
was ready to play with the best, as it
swept all four events and played each
other in two of the finals.
Freshman Boh Bryan defeated team
mate Ryan Wolters to capture the Pac
-10 individual title, and the two shared
the player of the year title for the
league.
The doubles matchups saw the
return of Goldstein, in his first match
since March 8, as he teamed up with
Wolters to take the crown.
In the invitational division, fresh
men Geoff Abrams defeated junior
teammate Charles Hoeveler to claim
the title. Abrams teamed up with Stan
ford senior Grant Elliott to capture the
invitational doubles title in Ojai.

With the entire team healthy for the
first time all season, Stanford traveled
clown south to the Los Angeles Tennis
Center for tin- N'('AA Championships
last Saturday.
Seeded third behind top-ranked
UCLA and second-ranked Mississippi,
Stanford blasted Harvard in the first
round, appearing ready to vie for a third
consecutive title.
On day two, Stanford faced 12th
ranked Texas, which had knocked off
fifth-ranked Kentucky to make it to the
second round. In a familiar dominating
fashion, the Cardinal ousted the
Longhornss 4-0.
"It was a disappointing loss for us,"
remarked Texas head coach Dave Sny
der. "But Stanford is a good team who
has a chance to go all the way."
Day three of the tournament marked
the semifinals, and the four top seeds
all advanced. UCLA faced Georgia while

Stanford took on Ole Miss.
Stanford's emotional and thrilling
match against the Rebels resulted inn
4-2 victory for the Card, giving Stanford
a chance to win its third consecutive
title.
Before the final match, when asked
how it would feel to win a national
championship, freshman Boh Bryan
summed it up in one word.
"Unbelievable," he said.
Stanford truly was just that as the
Cardinal achieved three straight titles
for the second time, the only team to do
so in NCAA tournament history under
the present team format.
But the Stanford men's tennis team
put the icing on the cake by making
Stanford the only school in division one
history to ever win six NCAA titles in
one year.
A season just cannot get any better
than that
