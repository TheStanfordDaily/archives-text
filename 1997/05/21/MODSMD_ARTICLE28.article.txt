## Seeing is not necessarily believing Researchers use visual illusions to study perception 
### Akash Garg Contributing writer 
When 3-D movies first came
out, people were impressed with
what appeared to be magic. Today,
stereogram posters have flooded
walls around the world. Some peo
ple may spend hours trying to find
the elusive hidden 3-D image,
while others have the ability to
pick it out right away. Optical — or
visual — illusions are a part of
everyday life.
The theory behind illusions is
simple. The human eye is not infal
lible, and it must make assump
tions about the world in order to
process all of the visual stimuli.

"When you see things, light
reflects off the surfaces of the
world into your eye and you don't
get direct information about the
properties of the surfaces and
objects out there in the world,"
said Psychology Prof. David
Heeger.
"What you get is the light that
bounces off of them. So your visual
system has to make some kind of
inference from the light that
arrives at your eye. Your visual sys
tem uses certain rules and regular
ities about the way the world usu
ally is in order to make those infer
ences, but sometimes those
assumptions that the visual sys
tem makes are wrong and so you
see things incorrectly."
Illusions may seem trivial, but
they can help researchers discover
more about the brain and the visu
al system.
"We can use visual illusions as a
tool for trying to understand the
neural processing that goes on in
your eye and parts of your brain to
understand how vision works by
studying the cases in which it does
something silly," Heeger said.
3-D stereograms provide some
of the most stunning visual illu
sions. The reason stereograms
work is because the two eyes view
the world differently.
For example, place your left
index finger about a foot in front
your nose. Then place your right
index finger midway between your
left finger and your nose. Now
close one eye at a time, and you will
notice that your fingers appear to

be moving. This is the fundamen
tal principle behind stereograms.
"Because your eyes are in two
different positions, objects in the
world at different depths project to
different positions on the retinas of
the two eyes," Heeger said.
Each eye takes its own picture
of the world and sends it to the
brain for processing where the

images are combined to make one
unified picture.
Therefore, when stereograms
are viewed correctly, each eye
receives the same picture that it
would if the object were actually 3-
D. That's how the brain constructs

a 3-D image out of 2 dimensions.
The stereogram illusion can be
generated with something as sim
ple as striped wallpaper.
"Imagine a wallpaper with just
vertical stripes on it. And if you
have your eyes both fixating on the
same stripe then it looks just fine.
Now imagine that you cross your
eyes. Each individual stripe pro
jects to one position in one eye and
to a different position in the other
eye, which is the cue that usually
corresponds to something being in
a different depth plane that what
your eyes are actually pointed at,"
Heeger said.
However, many people have
trouble seeing the stereogram
pictures.
"The reason that it's hard to see
them is because it is very unnatu
ral for you to be fixated on one
depth plane and focused on the
page itself," Heeger said. "That's
very hard to do."
According to Heeger, 10 percent
of the population is effectively
"stereo blind," which means that
they will never be able to see a 3-D
image from a 2-D image.
Although illusions exist, the
brain usually makes accurate
enough assumptions so that peo
ple can function normally in the
world.
However, the visual system
does make its own assumptions, so
seeing may not necessarily be
believing. The eyes can be tricked
into seeing a 3-D object when they
are really staring at two 2-D pro
jections.
