u lf the moon causes tides
\y % and we only have one
mmjn, how come there are two
tides every day?
A .When I was young, I
â€¢ used to go to the beach
all the time. One of my
favorite beach activities was
to build huge sand castles.
Of course, all the good sand
was available down near the
water during low tide, so I
always had to deal with the
tide coming back in and wash
ing away all my work.
Despite the numerous
sand-made dams and levees I
built, I could never ward off
the advance of the tide. You
see, back then I thought the
sea was out to get me. I was
wrong, apparently it was actu
ally the moon.
Most people have some
kind of faint notion that the
moon causes tides. Of course,
if you don't understand why
this is so that faint notion is
about as helpful as the notion
that the mouth produces a
quart of saliva every day.
Both the sun and moon
exert gravitational forces on
the earth and everything on
its surface, including the
oceans.
One might think that both
the sun and moon would have
comparable forces of gravity
on an object on the earth's
surface because, as you may
know, gravity is proportional
to mass but inversely related
to distance. The moon is a lot
closer to us than the sun
(except for maybe in Arizona),
but the sun is really honking
big.
It turns out that the
moon's gravitational force on
earthbound objects is about

2.2 times stronger than the
sun's gravitational force. This
is a big enough force to make
the tides depend more on the
moon than the sun.
So, anyway, how does this
cause tides? Well, one simpli
fied way to think about this is
by looking at the force of grav
ity exerted on the oceans by
the moon.
Suppose you are looking at
the earth, from the side, as
you are being abducted away
from the planet by aliens. In
between the thoughts of para
lyzing fear and helplessness,
you might observe that one
side of the earth bulges out
ward toward the moon.
If you think about it, the
water on the surface of the
earth on that side is closer to
the moon than the planet is as
a whole. This means that the
moon exerts a slightly
stronger gravitational force
on this water than it does on
the earth. This is what causes
the water on that side to bulge
out a little bit.
Now if you consider that
the earth makes a complete
rotation about (surprise) once
per day and the motion of the
moon during that time is not
really significant, you can see
that every point of the world

will spin through that side of the
earth.
This means that everyone gets
to experience the water bulge at
least once every day.- This would be
the high tide.
But wait! That only explains one
of the daily high tides. There are
two high tides every day, separated
by about 12 hours. Logically, for
this to happen, this means that
there is another bulge on the Earth,
on the side opposite of the previous
ly mentioned one.
Now this bulge comes from a
similar effect to the previous one.
This time, the Earth is closer to the
moon than the water is on the far
side, so the moon pulls on the Earth
more than it does on the water.
Voila! There's your second bulge.
These two bulges are then re
sponsible for each of the two high
and low tides that you see every day.
