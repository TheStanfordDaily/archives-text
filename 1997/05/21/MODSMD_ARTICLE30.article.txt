# Scientists study gene that causes skin cancer

### Ellen Licking Contributing writer 
Researchers at Stanford and UC-San Fran
cisco announced the first mouse model for
basal cell carcinoma of the skin, one of the
leading forms of cancer in humans, in the May
2nd issue of the journal Science.
The team responsible for the work was led
by Ervin Epstein Jr., a UCSF professor of der
matology, and Matthew Scott, a Stanford pro
fessor of developmental biology and genetics
and a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator.
Other Stanford researchers involved with
the project included postdoctoral fellow
Anthony Oro and research assistant Kay Hig
gins.
Each year about 750,000 people in the
United States develop a basal cell carcinoma,
or a BCC. These skin tumors are not usually
fatal and rarely spread through the body.
Normally they are treated with surgery or
radiation therapy. Lacking a mouse model in
which to study the tumors, progress in under
standing the mechanism that causes the dis
ease has been slow.
To obtain a suitable model, the Stanford-
UCSF team genetically engineered mice to
overproduce a particular gene called sonic
hedgehog in their skin. When this was done,
the mice developed BCCs in as little as four
days.
The rapid appearance of sonic hedgehog
induced tumors was important. It implied that
high levels of this gene's product were suffi
cient to cause BCC in mice.
"These data seem to indicate that BCC is a
one-step tumor," said Oro, lead author of the
Science article. "This means that only one
gene in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway,
a series of genes which interact to regulate
development, needs to be misexpressed for the
cancer to occur."
In addition to the tumors, the mice also
developed symptoms of a rare, inherited
human disease called basal cell nevus syn
drome. People with the disease are predis
posed to a variety of cancers, one including
BCC.
In addition they suffer from multiple skele
tal problems including abnormal ribs, jaws
and fingers. Often they have spina bifida, a
serious developmental defect due to which the
spinal column fails to close.
The genetically engineered mice showed
similar skeletal defects. Extra digits were
found on their fore and hind limbs. Spina bifi
da also occurred frequently. Because of the

severity of these skeletal abnormalities, many
of the mice died at birth.
Because so many of the mice died, the
researchers have not been able to establish a
line of mice that overproduce hedgehog. "It's
not a perfect model, but it did allow us to get
answers about the hedgehog signaling path
way in this disease process," Oro said.
Based on these results, the researchers
went after the human sonic hedgehog gene.
By screening 63 human tumors of various
types, they found three caused by mutations
in sonic hedgehog.
The team hypothesized that human sonic
hedgehog might be an oncogene. When inap-

propriately expressed, such genes can result in
abnormal cell growth and carcinomas.
The role of sonic hedgehog in BCC confirms
findings the Scott group made last year and
indicates that flies and humans share a com
mon signaling pathway.
In conjunction with Yale Prof. Allan Bale,
Scott and postdoctoral fellow Ron Johnson
identified another human gene that causes
BCC. The errant gene turned out to be one
the Scott lab was intimately familiar with: It
was the human version of a fly gene called
patched.
In 1989, the Scott group cloned patched in
order to understand its role in fly develop
ment. The patched gene product is a compli
cated protein that represses the production of
additional genes of various functions. Some
are these downstream genes are involved in
cell differentiation; others regulate cell
growth.
In flies, patched is just one member of a
complicated signaling pathway. Hedgehog is
also a member of this pathway and is respon
sible for regulating patched.
When hedgehog is present, it prevents
patched from functioning, which leads to the
production of cell growth genes. In hedgehog's
absence, patched is able to prevent these genes
from being produced.
In humans, inactivity of patched con
tributes to the excessive growth of cancer
cells. Based on the fly signaling pathway, the
Scott lab predicted that overproduction of
sonic hedgehog in mice might have the same
consequences. They were right.
For Oro, the similarities between flies and
vertebrates was exciting. "The results from
our studies in flies can be now applied to ver
tebrates and human disease," he said.
Scott agreed. "I think this finding illus
trates the coming of age of developmental
biology," he said. "Many pathways important
in normal development result in disease
when they are misregulated. We are develop
ing an appreciation that animals have com
mon signaling mechanisms. Using this
knowledge, we can apply it to the human con
text and this may make disease processes
more accessible."
Oro and his colleagues hope the mouse
model will lead to improved treatment of
human skin cancers. They are currently try
ing to identify the target genes regulated by
patched and sonic hedgehog.
"As we understand the pathway and its reg
ulation, we will be better able to design treat
ments which help people with BCC," Oro said.

When hedgehog is missing, patched pre
vents the production of certain target
genes. When hedgehog is expressed, it pre
vents patched from acting and causes the
production of the same target genes, lead
ing to uncontrolled cell growth.
