Ant species invades Jasper Ridge

A foreign species of ant found in
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is
endangering the survival of native ant
species. The aggressive Linepithema
humile from Argentina arrived in this
area within the last three decades.
Northern Californian ants including
the species Camponotus semitestaceus

and Messor andrei have been decimated. They fight a
losing battle with the Argentine ants, either being
killed directly or lacking the scarce resources of food,
water and shelter.
Most likely if you see an ant crawling around your
room or in the kitchen, it's an Argentine ant. They
have been able to withstand conventional methods of
extermination.
Unlike most other ants, colonies of the Argentine
ant branch out. Instead of having only one queen, most
Argentine colonies contain many. Because most ant
poisons are targeted at the queen, they are ineffective
against this newer species.
"Wherever they go, they wipe out the native ants,"

said Deborah Gordan, assistant professor of biology.
Gordan is observing the impact of the Argentine ants
in the natural habitats of Jasper Ridge.
She has found that this new species is pushing
other species back several hundred meters each year.
Gordon's research may be useful in the future to con
trol the expansion of these ants.
Stanford alum designs new chip

A chip on board the Hubble Space
Telescope designed by, David Kasle, who
received his doctorate in electrical engi
neering from Stanford in 1992, was
scheduled to be activated early this
month. This chip is a huge step forward
in astro-image decoder design.
Kasle's chip is a tiny but vital part

of an instrument called a spectrograph which
enables the Hubble telescope to spy out extremely
faint light given off by distant stars, gases, galaxies
and planets.
This informat ion will be used to study how celestial
objects evolve. The chip converts photons from the

light given off and converts them into electrons, which
are then translated into an image.
Kasle worked on the chip's design when he was a
student here. Originally the product of a collaboration
between Stanford University and Ball Aerospace sta
tioned in Colorado, the chip was given to Kasle for
minor improvements in circuitry.
His project was to design a digital circuit which
could translate the flow of information passing
through a detector within the chip.
What made Kasle's work so revolutionary was the
fact that he it fit into one tiny chip. Previously,
decoders were comprised of many chips and wire con
tained in a bulky box.
"I wanted to prove that it could be done on a sin
gle chip — a requirement for getting it into space,"
Kasle said.
Not only did his design save NASA more than
$250,000 in launching and production costs, it also
improved the resolution of the image returned.
The detector containing Kasle's chip was
installed in February. Results from its use are
expected next month.
