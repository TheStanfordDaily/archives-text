## Golfers prepare for NCAAs Women looking for first-ever championship 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Staff writer 
Four years ago, Stanford senior
Andrea Baxter went on a golf
recruiting trip to San Jose State.
She watched the women's golf
team, who won the national title
that year, receive its rings during
halftime of a football game.
Today, Baxter hopes she and
her teammates will get to slip rings
on their own fingers at the end of
the weekend. The Stanford
women's golfers are putting high
expectations on themselves, shoot
ing for a first-ever national title
when they play the first round of
the NCAA Championship today in
Columbus, Ohio.
"We feel like the way (Stan
ford's) men's volleyball did," said
head coach Caroline O'Connor. "If
the girls want to win, this is their
year."
No. 6 Stanford boasts two grad
uating seniors nationally ranked in
the top five who have never gar
nered title rings. The Cardinal's
strongest finish at the champi
onships was fourth in 1992 and
1995
The NCAAs will be held at Ohio
State's Scarlett Golf Course. Eigh
teen teams, picked from top finish
es from the NCAA East and West
Regional tournaments, will com
pete in the four-round match.
While senior co-captain Mhairi
McKay sees the title as "definitely
within our reach," her longtime
Scottish rival Janice Moodie will
attempt to lead her team, San Jose
State, to a fourth national title.
Arizona's top-ranked sophomore,
Marisa Baena, who won the 1996
NCAA individual title, will seek to
lead her team to its second consec
utive title.
No. 4 Tennessee and No. 8
Wake Forest are strong Eastern
contenders for the national title,
but it was a surprising No. 19 Ohio
State that clinched the East
Regional title this year. The Buck
eyes are also hosting the tourna
ment.
The parity of the playing field
will prove to be as stiff as a golfer's
grip for the Cardinal.
Only one team stroke separates
No. 1 Arizona from No. 2 Arizona
State in the Rolex women's rank
ings. Last year's championship
ended in a playoff between Arizona
and San Jose State. The Wildcats
won with an eagle putt by Baena.
Stanford finished fifth last year
but led the tournament in the first
three rounds.
The Cardinal women's golf
team has been through a tough
year. It started off the preseason
winning several tournaments but
faltered at its second tournament
of the season.

After the team won the Region
al Challenge at the start of the
NCAA season, the team lost its
second-seeded golfer Andrea Bax
ter when she broke her wrist in a
weekend snowboarding accident.
Without Baxter, team confidence
dropped to an all-time low for the
next three tournaments. Players
struggled at the heavily tree-lined
course at the Spartan Invitational,
lagging at 10th place and posting
its worst team total for the season.
The turning point for the team
came when Baxter returned for the

Peg Barnard tournament, hosted
by Stanford.
"I think it's good that we fell for
a while," Baxter said. "Unless
you've been at the bottom, it's
hard to really know how to come
back on top."
With a renewed appreciation of
winning and losing, the team's
determination to win translates to
how hard the squad has worked.
Aside from mandatory practice

seen at the range driving their
white balatas in the dark. On days
off, the team was out at the prac
tice range, putting and chipping.
While the team has spent the
past seven months articulating
course management and honing its
swings, for the championships it
will be all about attitude and focus,
O'Connor said.
After finishing within the top
five at their past three tourna
ments Cardinal players said confi
dence is soaring.
At its last tournament, Stanford
led in the first two rounds and fell
to third place, five strokes behind
first-place Arizona at the NCAA
West Regional.
"That says a lot. Regardless of
how we finished, it made us realize
we were right there," Baxter said.
None of the Stanford players is
familiar with the par-72 Ohio
course, but they consider that an
advantage.
"I heard a lot of people have bit
ter memories about Scarlett, and

that may make them lose confi
dence when they play again," Bax
ter said.
While top-ranked teams like
Arizona State, Wake Forest and
San Jose State played the course at
the Rolex Fall Preview in October,
many players posted high scores.
Arizona's Baena, who won the
tournament, finished with 3-over
par 219.
The Cardinal team's physical
strength is another advantage.
McKay, Baxter and freshman
Julie Dunn, who average about
280 yards off the tee, are able to
hit longer than most players.
The Scarlett course, at 6,114
yards, runs long with damp fair
ways much like the Stanford
course.
Also, the Cardinal teammates
will have the moral support of their
parents, who are all attending the
tournament.
Torn between the choice of
watching their daughter Mhairi
graduate from Stanford or play in
her last national championship
tournament, Mr. and Mrs. McKay
opted to fly from Scotland to wit
ness the latter.
