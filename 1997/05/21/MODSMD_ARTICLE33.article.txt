# NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
## Individuals and doubles field narrows for tennis 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Only eight singles players remain in the NCAA
Championship for women's tennis, and two of them
are donning the cardinal and white.
Freshman Lilia Osterloh and junior Julie Scott
advanced to the quarterfinals yesterday with wins
in the round of 32 and the round of 16.
Scott and junior Ania Bleszynski also reached
the quarterfinals in the doubles championship,
breezing past their second-round opponent in
straight sets.
Senior Katie Schlukebir reached the round of 16
by winning her first match of the day but was elim
inated in the afternoon match. Osterloh and
Schlukebir also ended their doubles season, losing a
second-round match yesterday.
Osterloh, the eighth seed in the bracket, disposed
of William and Mary's Michelle O relatively easily in
the morning. The No. 2 player from the Tribe was
no match for Osterloh, who won in straight sets 6-
2, 6-3.
In the afternoon match, Osterloh met up with
Florida's Amanda Basica, another No. 2 competitor.
Even Basica could not extend to three sets the Stan
ford freshman, who is 7-0 in the postseason. Oster
loh posted a 6-3, 6-4 victory.
In the quarterfinals, Osterloh will face Mississip
pi sophomore Agnes Muzamel at 10 a.m. today. The
Rebels' No. 1 player, Muzamel is the fourth seed in
the bracket and No. 2 in the country.
"Lilia is cooking pretty good," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "She can really beat
anyone in this tournament if she is on her game.
But she could lose to anyone if she doesn't
focus."
Scott, the two-time Pacific 10 Conference singles
champ, also earned the right to play today with two
wins. In the morning match, the junior co-captain
took care of Montana's Vanessa Castellano, a
sophomore ranked No. 44. Scott refused to be taken
to a third set, breaking Castellano late in the second
for a 6-4, 7-5 win.
In the following round, Scott collided with Wake
Forest's Amy Jensen, who turned everyone's head
in the first round by upsetting Texas' Cristina
Moros, the No. 5 seed. The freshman's run ended in
the third round, however, as Scott outlasted Jensen
for a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 triumph.
"Julie is really buying into this heroine thing,"
Brennan said of his co-captain. "Eveiyone loves her
and she's the fan favorite and she's pkiying off that.
She's the American Dream right now."
In today's match set for 10 a.m., Scott has a
tough test in Duke sophomore Vanessa Webb. The
Blue Devils' No. 1 player, Webb was defeated
soundly in the team tournament by Osterloh but is
the draw's No. 3 seed and No. 10 nationally.
But the underdog status is one with which Scott
is both comfortable and familiar.
"I always come into a match thinking I am the
underdog," Scott said after clinching the NCAA
title Sunday for the Cardinal. "Coming into my
freshman year I just wanted to be in the top six. I
have never considered myself one of the top play
ers."
Brennan likes Scott's prospects today, despite
Webb.
"I think Julie's chances are at least 50-50,"
Brennan said. "The thing is that Webb's game is

very similar to [Jensen's), who Julie beat (in the last
roundl. It really depends how Julie feels in the
morning after playing three matches" yesterday.
Scott has registered a number of impressive wins
this season, including a run in this year's Pac-10
singles tournament in which she upset three No. 1
players on her way to the crown. In three consecu
tive matches, Scott defeated Osterloh, Arizona
State's Reka Cseresnyes and Arizona's Vicky Maes.
As for Schlukebir, a heart-breaking loss in the
third round ended an illustrious Stanford career
for this year's co-captain. For her career,
Schlukebir posted a 76-28 record. For the last
half of the season, she sat atop the national rank
ings in singles.
Schlukebir battled {ill afternoon with Florida
freshman M.C. White, who edged the Cardinal four
time All-American in the first set 6-4. Schlukebir
forced a split, however, by eking out a 7-6 set after
taking the tie-breaker by a 9-7 margin. White was
too much for Schlukebir in the third and decisive
set, earning the win and a berth in the quarterfinals
6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4.
"She was disappointed after the match, but I told
her while she was out there to just have fun and
enjoy it," Brennan said. "It's like she already has a
million in the bank. Everything we do this week is
really icing on the cake from last week."
White and Schlukebir met in Sunday's final as
well, with White taking the match for Florida's only
point of the match.
Osterloh and Scott are two of only eight players
remaining in the singles draw. In the other quar-

onships and in doubles with Junior Ania
Bleszynski yesterday.
