Grant Elliott
The lone senior on the Stanford squad handed the Car
dinal men's tennis team its third consecutive NCAA
championship and the school's sixth national title of the
year with a hard-fought 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Geor
gia's Rafael Jordan. After losing the first set, Elliott came
back to win the next and clinch the final set to the cheers
of the crowd. Stanford blanked the Bulldogs 4-0 in the
championship match. In the semifinals, Elliott's 7-5, 6-2
win over Mississippi's Robert Abendroth put Stanford up
3-2 against the Rebels. The team went on to win the
match against Ole Miss 4-2

Teryn Ashley
Anyone that handicapped freshman Teryn Ashley for a
lack of poise was proven dead wrong at this week's NCAA
Championships. With the composure of an experienced
senior, Ashley came back from a first-set loss against
Duke's Kristen Sanderson to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 to clinch
Stanford's semifinal win over the Blue Devils. However,
the real test of nerves arose the following day, as Ashley,
with the national title on the line, overcame a 4-0 deficit
in the third set against Florida's Traci Green to take the
decisive match 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 and seal the first Cardinal
championship since 1991.
