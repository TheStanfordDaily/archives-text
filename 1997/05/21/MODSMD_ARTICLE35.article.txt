The Stanford crew team fin
ished off its season with solid and
much-improved performances last
weekend in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships in Lake
Natorna at Sacramento.
"The Pac-10 is a very competi
tive conference," said sophomore
varsity rower Katie Sears. "And we
were right in there with the other
top schools."
Sears' squad finished fifth in a
field of 17 boats.
The men's varsity squad fell one
place short of earning its trip to the
medal stand Sunday, coming in
fourth.
"We were hoping to get top
three, but it didn't quite come
together for us," said junior stroke
Matt Jolley. "1 felt like we put
down the best time we could, but
we would've liked to beat OSU."
With a surprising second-place
performance in their heat and an
easy triumph over Gonzaga —
who defeated the Cardinal by five
seconds a month earlier — the
junior varsity men finished a
respectable fifth in the conference
finals.
"We had a tremendous heat in
the morning," said senior Jon
Garfinkel. "We handled Gonzaga
with ease."
In the finals, the wind began to
pick up, affecting the JV's perfor
mance because bigger bodies have
an easier time rowing through the
wind. The Cardinal crew is small
compared to the other crews.
"The final was more an issue of
survival than anything else,"
Garfinkel said.
The women's junior varsity

squad also came up one place short
of the medal stand this weekend.
"Even though we wantx*! to do
better, we did what we were sup
posed to do. We were ranked fourth
and finished fourth," said senior
Anne Dubinsky. "We felt like we
had a good end to our season."
On the novice side, the first
boats both competed Sunday,
while the second boats competed
the day before in the Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships.
Going into this weekend with
the fourth seed, the men's first
boat surprised the third-seeded
Beavers by defeating them in their
heat.
However, in the grand finals,
Oregon State came back to earn
the bronze, edging the Cardinal by
a few feet.
"We had a great race in the
fina,l holding even with OSU," said
sophomore novice oarsman
Nathan Matter. "However, not
even a disappointing finish like
that can cast a shadow over such a
great season."
The women's squad closed their
season with a sixth-place finish.
"The final race was a little dis
appointing because of how tired I
was," said junior Jodi Carton. "But
I know every woman on that boat
pulled her heart out."
Carton also raced in the
women's varsity 4 division along
with three other novices for a
chance to qualify for nationals.
"We were nervous and haven't
had quite enough practice," Car
ton said.
Despite not qualifying, the Car
dinal finished ninth out of 13
boats.
