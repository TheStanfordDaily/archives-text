# Night-time talk show makes premiere
## 
### Jennifer Godwin 
Junior Peter Szeremi will take
his dream on the air this evening
when NiteChat, the first late-night
style talk show in Stanford televi
sion history, premieres at 9:30 p.m
onSCBN.
"Having a talk show is what I
want to do in my life. I thought I'd
give it a head start here," said Sz
eremi, the program's host.
This week's premiere show sets
up the program's light-hearted
format with a monologue, skits
and "campus celebrities." Szeremi
will interview senior basketball
star Brevin Knight and senior
Bruce Gibney, opinions editor for
The Stanford Review — a student
freshman producer Bobby Fer
rario called a "notable campus per
sonality."
Tonight's program will also fea
ture all available past and present
Dollies, who will perform a dance
number. The program will host
three guests a week.
Labrosse King, a locally known
music group, will appear regularly
as the show's in-house band and
play a role akin to that of Paul
Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra on
Late Night with David Letterman.
The weekly show will air on
Wednesdays for the next three
weeks. The show is taped the night
before in front of a live studio audi
ence.
Executive producer Alejandro
Menchaca, a senior, said he hopes
the show will continue to showcase
well-known campus figures. Possi
ble, but unconfirmed, guests for

next week's program include a
Kiss cover band, Daniel Bramzon,
a junior who founded Stop Monop
olies on Campus, and Garry
Grundy, a junior medieval studies
rmyor.
And who is Menchaca's dream
guest?
"Well, we're talking with Kate
Starbird right now."
Menchaca said he would also
like to invite Stanford's favorite
TV stars, juniors Fred Savage and
Dan Pintauro, on the show for
NiteChat's third and final week.
Szeremi said, "I honestly think
a show like this has been missing at
Stanford for a long time. I think
[we] need a chance to laugh at [our
selves]."
NiteChat is modeled on popular
talk shows such as Late Night with
David Letterman and the Tonight
Show with Jay Leno.
"We're not trying to imitate"
Letterman or Leno, Szeremi said.
"We want the show to have our
personalities and to be about Stan
ford."
NiteChat is Szeremi's brain
child. "I've been thinking about
this since last year," but things
never came together, he said.
When he returned last month from
the overseas program in Florence,
he said he realized "this is the time
— I have so many ideas."
Szeremi said, "I'd like to pro
duce a very professional show — a
very quality show. I've been focus
ing on that. I do want to thank my
fantastic, talented crew. They've
done a wonderful job, and I'm very
proud."

NiteChat's staff includes Men
chaca, Ferrario and head writer
Stacey Nordwall, a sophomore.
Ferrario is in charge of prepar
ing for each show. He and the other
staff call possible guests and
arrange for them to appear on the
air.
All the information about the
guest is gathered into a folder,
which, according to Ferrario, is
"kind of like an FBI file." Produc
ers also ask the guest questions so
that the host can have an idea
about what kinds of topics the
guest might discuss on the show.
Head writer Nordwall and her

staff write Szeremi's monologue
and work out the skits. "We brain
storm and toy to make the show
funny."
Nordwall also greets the audi
ence before the taping and tries to
entertain them "so they'll be in the
mood to laugh."
Tapings take place in Eleanor
Prosser Studio in Memorial Audi
torium at 10 p.m. Tuesday nights.
NiteChat will come back on the
air in the fall. University President
Gerhard Casper and Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo both taped
promotional clips and have already
agreed to be guests.
