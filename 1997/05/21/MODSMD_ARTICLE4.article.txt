# Jam-packed agenda fills final meeting
## Constitutional Council, sophomore class officers among issues discussed by ASSU 
### Elise Lipkowitz Contributing writer 
Last night's marathon meet
ing of the ASSU Senate demon
strated the old maxim that it is
hard to say goodbye.
Among the myriad issues con
sidered in the final meeting of the
First Senate were the completion
of certification of the Spring
Quarter General Election, bills to
fill the final two vacant seats on

the Constitutional Council and a
bill proposing to dismiss ASSU
Elections Commissioner Ghazal
Bndiozamani for failing to com
plete the duties of the positions.
The senate also voted early this
morning to approve the ASSU
and Stanford Student Enterpris
es budgets for 1997-98 school
year.
The biggest surprise of the
evening came when a motion to
certify the Sophomore Class pres
idents-elect, Cardinal Quad, nar
rowly failed with most of the sen
ators abstaining.
The Cardinal Quad ticket is
comprised of Sundeep Ahuja,
Meghan Cameron, Stephen Kane
and Oscar Rojas. The ticket won
by 91 votes.
However, controversy has
arisen in the past few weeks over
the fact that the ticket overspent
campaign funds to produce and
sell campaign T-shirts. The
money spent on shirts was later
raised in sales.
Although the Hearings Com
mittee censured Cardinal Quad
for its actions, it emphasized that
the victory could be certified.
ASSU Senators Alane Mur
dock and Mallory Roberts were
the most outspoken senators urg

ing against certification.
"We need to remember why we
have spending limits. It is because
we don't want to make it a game
where the richest students on
campus spend more than other
slates and are able to get the word
out more," Murdock said. "It is
not an issue of whether they ulti
mately made up their expenses in
sales. I think we need to make a
statement with this group and say
no."
Roberts went further, saying,
"I find it incredibly hard to believe
that anyone with any knowledge
of elections could not figure out
that expenditures does not imply
income. They used incredibly
poor judgment, and I'm shocked
they did this."
Kane and Ahuja expressed
their discontent, noting that they
had an e-mail from Hearings Offi
cer Marcella White indicating
that it was fine to produce and sell
the T-shirts.
"This is a mockery and an un
fair pompous way of screwing us

over," said Kane.
He added, "The Sophomore
Class has been cheated out of a
welcome-back social and other
programs for the fall that require
planning."
Because the senate voted not to
certify, there will be no Sopho
more Class presidents until an
other election is held.
Kane and Ahuja emphasized
that they will run again and that
they anticipate winning.
In other matters, the two re
maining seats on the Constitu
tional Council were filled by Sen
ate Chair Don Aingworth and
Senator Doug Natelson, both of
whom are retiring from the sen
ate.
Aingworth and Natelson, both
doctoral students, are veteran
senators who earn the praise of
colleagues for their knowledge of
the ASSU Constitution and By
laws.
However, some questions were
raised as to whether Aingworth
during his tenure as senate chair

used parliamentary procedure to
his advantage.
Murdock, who was the sole
senator to vote against Aing
worth, emphasized that his rul
ings were arbitrary.
"Don looked over nit shit or big
things based on convenience, and
he used rules in an inappropriate
manner to manipulate with quo
rum," Murdock said.
Deputy Senate Chair Joe Fre
und, while agreeing that Aing
worth occasionally used the rules
to his advantage, emphasized that
on the Constitutional Council
Aingworth "won't have the ability
to manipulate."
Aingworth and Natelson
round out the team of five justices
joining sophomores Katherine
Wray and Robert Windom and
doctoral student Nawwar Kas
rawi.
The justices are charged with
properly enforcing the ASSU
Constitution.
A motion was also made last
night to consider firing Elections

Commissioner Ghazal Badioza
mani. Most arguments against
Badiozamani centered around
her failure to tally write-in votes
for the graduate senate election
accurately and to follow through
fully on specific instructions
given to her by the senate.
Several senators expressed
concern about the tallying of the
write-in votes, noting that due to
low graduate-student voter turn
out, graduate senate elections can
turn on one or two votes.
Badiozamani defended her
work, emphasizing that when she
accepted the job that she did so on
two conditions. "I promised I
would try my best and that I
would make mistakes. I am
human and this is a huge respon
sibility. I made mistakes, but they
weren't enough to make the elec
tion invalid in any way," she said.
Badiozamani was able to retain
her position by a vote of 9-5-1.
Her remaining tasks as elections
commissioner involve choosing
and training her successor.
