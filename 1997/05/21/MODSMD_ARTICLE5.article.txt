# H&D stresses meal-plan cost, flexibility
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
A recently released interim report by Hous
ing and Dining Services may mean more flexi
ble and cost-efficient eating plans. The report
was the manifestation of a 13-member Inter
nal Review Committee set up last spring by
University Budget Director Tim Warner.
Members of the committee emphasized Â£hat
the report is not set in stone because the Task
Force on Residential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates has not yet re
leased its recommendations, which may con
flict with the committee's. Members said they
are prepared to make amendments to the re
port after the task force makes its recommen
dations, which are expected June 1.
The committee placed a strong emphasis on

building residence-bused
communities. It neither rec
ommended changes to Resi
dential Education nor the
residence staff associated
with the communities.
The committee also ad
dressed the desire for hous
ing costs to remain uniform
across campus, regardless of
whether a student lives in a
simile or a triole.

"These were givens we had to operate
under," said Warner, the committee chair.
"Those values were out of our purview."
One of the committee's initial objectives
was to review the pricing structure of Housing
and Dining Services. In addition to visiting
Princeton University, UC-Berkeley and Santa

Clara University, the committee hired the out
side consulting firm Fessel International to
conduct focus groups and surveys to determine
students' wants and needs.
"The committee concluded [thatl we are on
the high end price-wise relative to other insti
tutions," Warner said. I le added that this is es
pecially true for Dining Services. Campus
housing costs remain competitive with off
campus housing, he said.
Housing and Dining receives no financial
support from the University. According to
Warner, the division operates strictly with rev
enue from room and hoard fees and summer
conference fees. Including Escondido Village,
Housing and Dining operates 300 buildings.
Many institutions only have five high-rises,
