# H&D stresses meal-plan cost, flexibility
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
A recently released interim report by Hous
ing and Dining Services may mean more flexi
ble and cost-efficient eating plans. The report
was the manifestation of a 13-member Inter
nal Review Committee set up last spring by
University Budget Director Tim Warner.
Members of the committee emphasized £hat
the report is not set in stone because the Task
Force on Residential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates has not yet re
leased its recommendations, which may con
flict with the committee's. Members said they
are prepared to make amendments to the re
port after the task force makes its recommen
dations, which are expected June 1.
The committee placed a strong emphasis on

building residence-bused
communities. It neither rec
ommended changes to Resi
dential Education nor the
residence staff associated
with the communities.
The committee also ad
dressed the desire for hous
ing costs to remain uniform
across campus, regardless of
whether a student lives in a
simile or a triole.

"These were givens we had to operate
under," said Warner, the committee chair.
"Those values were out of our purview."
One of the committee's initial objectives
was to review the pricing structure of Housing
and Dining Services. In addition to visiting
Princeton University, UC-Berkeley and Santa

Clara University, the committee hired the out
side consulting firm Fessel International to
conduct focus groups and surveys to determine
students' wants and needs.
"The committee concluded [thatl we are on
the high end price-wise relative to other insti
tutions," Warner said. I le added that this is es
pecially true for Dining Services. Campus
housing costs remain competitive with off
campus housing, he said.
Housing and Dining receives no financial
support from the University. According to
Warner, the division operates strictly with rev
enue from room and hoard fees and summer
conference fees. Including Escondido Village,
Housing and Dining operates 300 buildings.
Many institutions only have five high-rises,

Warner said. Having 10 resi
dence-based dining halls to feed
3,C00 undergraduates also con
tributes to the high cost of dining.
The committee made several
recommendations to offset the
high costs.
In order to prevent students
from wasting h la carte points at
the end of the quarter, the com
mittee proposed the possibility of
creating a points tab that could
carry over from quarter to quar
ter. "They could just be billed
later for it," said sophomore Eric
Friedman, student committee
member.
Additionally, food waste could
be cut down if people were limited
to one entree in the & la board sys
tem, Friedman said.
"If they want more food, they
can go back," he said.
Housing and Dining Director
Keith Guy said Dining Services
will also attempt to price prepack
aged items, such as Snapple, clos
er to market value.
Prices for guest meals may also
change. "We're looking to reduce
guest meal charges so it's easier
for faculty to visit the dining hall,"
Friedman said.
New meal plans are also in the
works. Next year, Ricker Dining
Hall will make the switch from h la
carte to & la board, the system that
allows students to purchase all
you-can-eat and points plans.
"Ricker has been a points pro
gram," Guy said. "The problem
was that it was designed to be a
straight-line servery. It should
work better for & la board."
In addition, the committee sug

gested the addition of a smaller
10-meals-a-week plan and a com
muter plan similar that of eating
associates.
Overall, the committee recom
mended simplifying the current
system and making food quality
more consistent. "Roble and Man
zanita just aren't the same quali
ty," Friedman said.
"We're going to try to move
[every dining hall] to h la board,"
Friedman added. "Manzanita is
going to remain unchanged." Ac
cording to Guy, Manzanita was
designed specifically for the & la
carte system.
Behind-the-scenes food pro
duction may also change. Tasks
like making salads may be central
ized to a single location. "Stern
and Wilbur Halls would be prime
candidates for that," Guy said.
Friedman added that the com
mittee recommended bringing
more of the food preparation
closer to the students. They plan
to have more programs like the
current grill system and rice pots
already used in most dining
halls.
The committee also addressed
the implementation of budget
constraints. "We recommend
that, in the future, the growth
rate of room and board be held at
no more than the rate of infla
tion," Warner said.
This year, room and board
rates were raised 3.1 percent.
Friedman said members of the
committee did not feel it was their
place to decide the fate of the
Toyon Eating Clubs. They speci
fied that several different bodies
needed to be consulted including
representatives from the eating
clubs, Residential Education,
Housing and Dining and the Plan
ning Office.
