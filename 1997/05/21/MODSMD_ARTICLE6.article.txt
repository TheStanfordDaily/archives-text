# Playwright focuses on social concerns

American playwright Tony
Kushner addressed a variety of
modern social concerns I ant night
in a speech sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
Kushner is recognized primarily
for his play, "Angels in America,"
which has claimed a variety of hon
ors including the Pulitzer Prize and
two Tony awards in 1993.
Kushner greeted the audience in
Memorial Auditorium with an
apology for not having written a
formal speech and instead read
three excerpts of speeches current
ly in development, speaking in a
fast-paced style.
The playwright prefaced the
first excerpt by saying, "This is
going to be about socialism." Not
treating socialism in the conven
tional sense, however, he proceed
ed to draw a variety of literary e>
amples to explore relevant social
concerns ranging from sexuality
to politics.
Using a humorous selection of
anecdotes, Kushner provided an
expansive view of the turn of the
century and focused on the aspect
of "walking backward into the fu
ture."
He ended the first section of the
talk on an optimistic note, calling
for a greater degree of liberty and
"socialism of the skin."
The style of the next excerpt was
vastly different, as Kushner em
ployed a stream-of-consciousness
approach and examined what it
means to be an "intelligent homo
sexual" in the 19905.
"Everyone knows what a homo

sexual is," he said, adding that an
"intelligent homosexual" is one
who has an acute awareness of lit
erary history as well as social is
sues.
Kushner spoke next about his
childhood, gay stereotypes and
aging. He invigorated common
place topics such as his hairstyle
and then mocked issues of morality
and political correctness.
He said he hoped "people would
strive toward more noble pursuits,
rather than mapping out trips to
the shopping mall."
Explaining the definition of his
self-identity, Kushner said, "I am
not so much a queer theorist as a
queer searching for a theory."
After an enthusiastic response
from the audience for his first two
expositions, Kushner surprised the
crowd with a reading of a play on
which he is currently working. The
unfinished play, titled "East Coast
Ode to Edward .Jarvis," was in
fused with a variety of typical New
York characters.
Kushner's play, which he jok
ingly said would appear on HBO,
centers on the comical attempts of
several New Yorkers to evade
taxes. Their ludicrous scheme in
volves contacting bizarre people
on the Internet and uses flashes of
scenes in select New York areas.
Many of Kushner's plays, in
cluding "Angels in America," can
didly explore homosexual life and
its influence on society.
Kushner is currently working
actively on another play â€” the
name of which he withheld. "An
gels in America" continues to
be performed throughout the
country.
