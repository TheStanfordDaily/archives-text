What would you do
with $2 million? Stan
ford students rarely
face such a pleasant
dilemma.

Last Sunday at 4:30 a.m.,
freshman Jim Czaja received
word from his father, Kdward,
that the family had won $2 mil
lion in the New York State Lot
tery.
On hearingthe news, Jim, ac
companied by friend James
Greene, took the next taxi to the
San Francisco airport.
"Are you kidding me, I

couldn't sleep!" Jim Czaja said
of his Sunday morning exploits.
With the news starting to sink
in, Jim Czaja and Greene, wear
ing their finest clothes, booked a
12:30 p.m. flight home to up
state New York. When they
found out their flight was de
layed, however, they decided to
forego the trip and return to
campus, Czaja said.
"It was a very festive time,"
Greene said. "By far my most
memorable Sunday morning."
Czaja said lie did not get the
chance to talk to his parents
Sunday after the initial phone
call.
