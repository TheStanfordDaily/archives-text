## 
### Ward Bullard Matt Flannery 
What would you do
with $2 million? Stan
ford students rarely
face such a pleasant
dilemma.

Last Sunday at 4:30 a.m.,
freshman Jim Czaja received
word from his father, Kdward,
that the family had won $2 mil
lion in the New York State Lot
tery.
On hearingthe news, Jim, ac
companied by friend James
Greene, took the next taxi to the
San Francisco airport.
"Are you kidding me, I

couldn't sleep!" Jim Czaja said
of his Sunday morning exploits.
With the news starting to sink
in, Jim Czaja and Greene, wear
ing their finest clothes, booked a
12:30 p.m. flight home to up
state New York. When they
found out their flight was de
layed, however, they decided to
forego the trip and return to
campus, Czaja said.
"It was a very festive time,"
Greene said. "By far my most
memorable Sunday morning."
Czaja said lie did not get the
chance to talk to his parents
Sunday after the initial phone
call.

after his family won the New York State lottery.

"They were just busy making
sure this whole thing was for
real," Jim Czaja said.
Within a few short hours, all
lingering doubts were dissolved.
"I drove straight to the State
Lottery Commission's Office in
Albany and turned in that ticket,"
Edward Czaja said.
The proud father recalled that
he let his daughter hold the ticket
in her wallet because he was too
nervous to hold it himself. Ironi
cally, the lucky ticket's number
was his daughter's birthday, he
said.

Jim Czaja said he was glad he
and Greene had tried to fly to New
York, even though the trip did not
work out. "I'm glad wo did that; it
was fun to share my excitement
with my friends in the dorm," said
Czaja, who was mobbed by his
friends on his return to his fresh
man dormitory, Otero. Most of
them were just returning from a
weekend in Yosemite.
"It was amazing how fast the
news spread," Greene said. "We
only told two friends from our
dorm, and by the time we came
back, everyone knew the story."
In addition to the swarm of en
thusiasm, Czaja was also con
fronted by various doubters, who
questioned the legitimacy of the
news.

However, freshman Carlos
Martinez silenced the critics that
evening after a little research on
the World Wide Web.
"His story was solid," Martinez
said.
The Czaja family is now faced
with the obvious question of what
to do with the money.
"It was a confusing yet ex
tremely pleasant surprise for all of
us," Edward Czaja said. "What we
have to figure out now is how we
as a family are going to let this af
fect our lives."
"To be honest," Jim Czaja said,
"I don't really care right now.
Hopefully if I don't think about it
too much, things will remain pret
ty much the same while I'm here."
His friends disagree.

"He's taking a lot of crap, but
it's all in good fun," freshman
roommate Matt Crystal said. "I
just hope he'll use the money to
buy some new music; he really
needs to change it."
The same three compact discs
— Counting Crows, Dave
Matthews and Pearl Jam — never
leave Czaja's stereo, Crystal said.
It is quite clear now that Czaja
will have no problem making the
change.
As news becomes no longer a
mere interruption, but a reality,
the halls of Otero are quieting
down, Greene said.
While the fame has brought
Czaja many benefits, he said
there's one thing left money can't
buy: a top spot in the Draw.
