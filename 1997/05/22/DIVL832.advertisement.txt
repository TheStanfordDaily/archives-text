Medical division o/THE PRINCETON REVIEW
If you're taking the time to read this small print, then you're probably
serious enough to be one of our students. You see, 41 instructional
sessions over weeks, plus 5 diagnostic exams isn't exactly an MCAT
course for a slacker. Hut if medical school is your dream we'll do
everything in our power to get you there. How? Well, the combination
of over 4(H)() pages of material, 16 full-length exams, and 5 specialized
instructors is a start. Add our computerized score reports and the fact
that you keep all of our materials. Heck, we're so confident you'll love
our course that if you aren't totally satisfied after the first week of class
we'll give you all your money back. So, before you sign up with some
inferior course, give us a call. Come by and look over our materials.
Take a look at our schedules. Ask many of your pre-med friends that are
already enrolled. They chose the best, and so should you. And finally,
thanks for reading.
