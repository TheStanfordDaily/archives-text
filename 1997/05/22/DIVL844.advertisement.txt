Cell Net
DATA SYSTEMS
Cell Net Data Systems, located in the Redwood Shores area on the Peninsula, is the
world leader in low-cost fixed point wireless communication services. Our products
allow information that constantly changes to be monitored and acted on in seconds,
as well as connect simultaneously with hundreds of thousands of real-time devices.
All thanks to our wireless data communications network!
This revolution in network technology for industry use is made possible by our
patented digital radio design, spread spectrum technology, embedded systems,
messaging system, distributed database and RF systems integration capability, based
on open systems architecture. If you can contribute to our fast growth, we would
like to talk to you.
We are seeking MS-CS/EE graduates whose studies have focused in the areas of
networking, distributed systems, real-time systems, and/or embedded systems. Work
experience in any of these areas would be an added plus.
Although we have missed the formal on-campus recruiting period, we will be
conducting interviews at a nearby hotel during the week of May 27-30. Please email
your resume to careers@cellnet.com so we can schedule an appointment.
