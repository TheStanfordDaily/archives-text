# Acceptance rate of admits climbs
## No students admitted off waiting list 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions is facing an embar
rassment of riches after a larger
than-expected number of admit
ted students accepted a place in
the Class of 2001.

This year,
1,680 students—
60 more than
Stanford's target
number of 1,620
— accepted their
offers of admis
sion. To date, the
yield rate of stu
dents accepting is

-63.9 percent, up Montoya
from 61.2 percent last year.
Due to the higher yield rate,
Stanford will admit no students
off its waiting list, the first time
since 1988 that the University has
not used list to fill the freshman
class.
"I am incredibly pleased that so
many of the admitted students
have chosen to enroll at Stanford,
but I am disappointed that we
were unable to offer any students
on the waiting list a place in the
class," Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
James Montoya said.
While no one factor was re
sponsible for Stanford's increased
yield rate, the development of new
programs and initiatives by the
Admissions Office gave Stanford

an advantage in attracting stu
dents, according to Montoya.
"All of our programs came to
gether to give students a better
understanding of what Stanford
has to offer," he said.
Montoya said the success of
Admit Weekend, increased alum
ni participation in contacting ad
mitted students, Stanford's need
blind admissions and graduating
students' positive view of Stan
ford all contributed to a higher
yield.
He said Chelsea Clinton's April
28 decision to attend Stanford did
not affect the yield rate at that
date, 40 more students admitted
through the regular decision
process had already committed to
attend Stanford than on the same
date last year.
Adding that he hoped the yield
rate would continue to climb,
Montoya said Stanford will admit
fewer students next year in order
to accommodate the higher rate.
On average, 45 entering stu
dents withdraw from the class be
fore registration in September,
according to Montoya. The Ad
missions Office plans to meet its
overall new student enrollment
target of 1,798 by adjusting the
number of transfer students ad
mitted to 158.
While Montoya anticipates a
freshman class that exceeds the
target number by 20 to 25 stu-
