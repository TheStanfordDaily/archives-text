## Girl catcher pulled for not wearing cup 
### 
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -
Twelve-year-old Melissa Raglin
can't play catcher on her base
ball team anymore. She doesn't
have the right equipment.
Raglin is refusing to obey a
Babe Ruth League rule that she
wear a jock strap and protective
cup because, well, she doesn't
see the need.
"When the ump asked me if I
was wearing a cup at the begin
ning of the second inning, I
took my helmet off and said,
'I'm a girl,' " explained Raglin,
who sat behind home plate for

2 1/2 years — without a cup —
until last Thursday.
Apparently Raglin, her
coach and most of the umpires
hadn't even realized that the
rule that catchers must wear
cups applies to girls, too. She
has been banished to the out
field until she complies.
"If something was made for
a girl, we'd have gotten it and
she'd be wearing it," said Patri
cia Raglin, Melissa's mother.
"But she's not going to wear a
boy's cup over a penis she
doesn't have."
