# Prosecution rests in McVeigh trial
## Final day of government case invokes emotions, brings one juror to tears 
### 
DENVER (AP) — Leaving jurors with
images of mass destruction, Oklahoma City
bombing prosecutors rested their case against
Timothy McVeigh yesterday after a swift 18
days of cold scientific evidence mixed with
wrenching accounts from survivors.
The last day was designed for maximum
emotional impact, with a juror brought to
tears by a survivor's account of the "tornado
like" blast and a slide show documenting the
search through the rubble for the 108 bodies.
The final government witness, a state med
ical examiner, authenticated an inch-high
stack of death certificates for the victims,
many of whom were crushed beyond recogni
tion and identified only through dental
records, fingerprints or surgical scars.
With that, after 137 witnesses in just 18
days, lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler told t hi*

judge: "Your honor, on behalf of the United
States, I'm pleased to announce we rest."
As they left the courthouse, bombing sur
vivors and relatives said they were pleased
with the prosecution's case but still filled with
sorrow.
"I'm not happy," said Roy Sells, whose wife
died in the explosion. "I probably won't be
happy when this is over. And if he's convicted,
1 still probably won't be a happy man, maybe
satisfied, but not happy."
1 jogal analysts have been almost unanimous
in their praise. William Pizzi, a former U.S.
attorney, called the case "smoothly and beauti
fully orchestrated."
"When you add up all the bits and pieces,
it's a very strong overall case that McVeigh
was involved in the bombing," Pizzi said.
After the government rested, U.S. District

Judge Richard Matsch sent jurors home for
the day and then rejected a routine defense
request for a judgment of acquittal.
McVeigh, who faces the death penalty in the
April 19, 1995, bombing, begins presenting his
evidence and witnesses today, in a case that
looks to be even leaner than the prosecution's
slimmed-down presentation.
Sources close to the case told The Associat
ed Press that McVeigh's lawyers plan to call MO
to 40 witnesses and challenge "every facet" of
the government's circumstantial case.
Just as they began, prosecutors used their
last day to focus on the victims. One juror
w«>pt and another appeared on the verge of
tears as Florence Rogers, president of the
credit union in the federal building, testified
about t he blast that left IH colleagues and two
customers dead.
