### 
NCAA crown for men's
tennis is Cardinal's
sixth for this year

IF IT SEEMS like you're always
opening the newspaper to an
article about a Stanford team
winning a national championship,
it's probably because the titles
keep coming and the list of Stan
ford's athletic feats keeps growing.
Sunday afternoon, the
women's tennis team handed a
huge defeat to the Florida Gators
to secure the national title. That
effort was matched Tuesday night
when the men's tennis team
defeated the Georgia Bulldogs for
the championship.
What is uncommon, what is
unprecedented, what will go down
in history and what everyone
should take notice of is that this
week's two NCAA titles bring
Stanford's grand total for the year
to six, surpassing the previous
record of five.
Thanks to the efforts of these
six teams and the rest of the Ath
letics Department, Stanford has
placed itself on the highest level of
athletic success — a feat that well
complements the University's aca
demic reputation. Regardless of
your sports interest, you should
be proud of this accomplishment
and proud that you are affiliated
with Stanford.
It's no secret that Stanford has
a rich tradition of athletic excel
lence. Several Cardinal players —
both current students and alumni
— competed in last summer's
Olympics in Atlanta. And its
essentially expected that the
school will pick up at least a few
national championships during
the course of each school year.
The previous record of five
titles had been matched by sever
al schools, including Stanford,
since it was established by USC in
1963. Many expected a sixth

championship to come during the
1994-95 school year, and it was a
disappointment to most that the
Cardinal golf team — featuring
then-freshman Tiger Woods and
four senior Ail-Americans —
came within a single birdie putt of
the title but ultimately fell to
Oklahoma State.
This year, though, started
promisingly. From its outset,
many speculated that 1996-97
would be the year for Stanford to
break the record. The Cardinal
grabbed three titles before the
close of the 1996 calendar year —
in men's and women's cross coun
try and women's volleyball.
Although many titles seen as
strong possibilities — in men's and
women's swimming and diving and
women's basketball — were ulti
mately not Stanford's to have,
men's volleyball came through and
secured the fourth title last month.
Some other sports have not yet
completed their seasons, and they
will have the opportunity to add to
the impressive six-title record that
was just established. The sixth
ranked women's golf could earn a
championship at the end of its run
this week at the NCAA finals in
Columbus, Ohio. The top-seeded
baseball team begins its quest for
a title today against Northeastern
in the first step to the College
World Series.
It has taken our team 35 years
to break the record for most NCAA
championships. And yet, because
Stanford athletes are among the
most competitive in the country, it
is not difficult to imagine the Car
dinal will surpass its own record
soon — perhaps even within the
next few days.
So next time you're out and
about, take the time to congratu
late the athletes you know. Even
though six teams captured titles,
everyone put in an effort. Our
teams can use all the encourage
ment we can give as they work to
make this historic year even more
outstanding and next year truly
remarkable.
