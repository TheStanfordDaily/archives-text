## Defeating the fat farms 
### 
WEIGHT-LOSS HYSTERIA has
infected the nation like a bad dis
ease. Americans have spent mil
lions of dollars on thighmasters, buttmas
ters, legmasters, chestmasters — lots of
masters — power riders, health riders,
knight riders and anything else that has its
own infomercial. Susan Powter screams
"Stop the insanity!" and thousands of fat
people go insane trying to lose weight.
Long before any of these things exist
ed and long before Susan Powter lost
what little sanity she had, there was a
place loved by all adults and despised by
all their children: fat camp.
As a child, I had the pleasure of
attending such a camp. I know what
you're thinking — lots of fat kids spend
ing their summer nights sitting around
the campfire, eating our low-fat turkey
dogs and reminiscing about chocolate
cake, cheeseburgers and french fries. To
be young and in love with food! Such is
the way of the obese.
It was nothing like that. Meals were a
passing moment in days filled with sports,
swimming, dances and everything else an
adolescent camper experiences. Just
because we weighed more than average
didn't mean we weren't normal. It meant
that we all had something in common.
And by the end of the summer, most of us
lost 20 to 40 pounds of that commonality.
The summer months weren't easy for
us all. With the heat and dearth of Her
shey bars, an overeater is liable to crack.

That's what happened to Steve Lipschitz.
Steve wasn't your average fat kid. He was
your average land mass. We called him
"Couch" because whenever he laid down,
five guys could sit on him comfortably —
five overweight guys at a fat camp.
He always took his weight in stride
and knew how to use it. Whenever any
one got him angry, he just threatened to
sit on them. You've never seen anyone
shut up so fast.
You mess with Couch, and you could
end up two-dimensional.
Nobody ever suspected that Couch
was going to create the biggest commo
tion since the Snickers Scandal of '83.
Not even Couch himself.
As I've said, Couch was a fairly big
guy. If you wanted to find the kid, you
didn't have to look too hard. So when the
head counselor made the routine bunk
bed check one night and couldn't find
him, he knew something was wrong. A
meeting of the counselors was called, and
a campground search began.
An hour came and went, and Couch
wasn't found. The owner of the camp pan
icked and allied the police. The camp radio
station, WFAT, broadcast Couch's descrip
tion and what he might be wearing. Anoth
er hour came and went. No Couch. The
counselor's flashlights were joined by
policemen's. None of the campers slept.
Each had his own theory about what hap
pened. Maybe he was kidnapped. Maybe he
was killed by the Indian ghost rumored to

dwell in the forest borders. Maybe canni
bals were stalking plump children.
Or maybe, just maybe, Couch broke
out. Maybe he escaped. Just then, the
bunk door opened, and there he stood,
sweatstains covering his Yankees T
shirt, a massive grin on his face and the
biggest McDonald's bag you've ever seen.
Without a word, he flipped the bag and
dumped 30 cheeseburgers on the bunk
floor, gleamed at us all and said, "Eat up.
I ate the other bag on the way over."
Those cheeseburgers never had a chance.
To this day, nobody knows how Couch
got out or how he survived the 10-mile
walk to and from McDonald's. But for
some reason none of that matters. For
one night, a bunch of starving heavy
weights ate like kings.
We rebelled in the only way we could:
by eating. We went on a reverse hunger
strike. No matter how much our parents
wanted us to lose weight or how forceful
the fat camp was, in the end it was our
choice. And that opportunity of choice
gave us a sense of power over our lives.
Without that, the insanity you'll have
to stop might be your own.

Jordan Gelbcr, a senior majoring ir.
drama and communication, was being
sarcastic when he claimed going to fat
camp was a pleasure.
