Shouldn't just do it; instead question the swoosh

Asa STUDENT at Stanford I
112 \ have been well aware of the
jL. JLgrassroots movement to boycott
Nike. But as a former varsity athlete in
track and cross country, sponsored by
Nike, my loyalty to the company pre
vented me from actively joining in the
debate. After all, this is the same com
pany that subsidized my Air Maxx run
fling shoes, paid for the stylish uni
forms in which I and the rest of the
team competed and, for a hefty sum,
made our coach a walking billboard
from head to toe, including his socks.
So Monday afternoon I went to go
>»uy a pair of running shoes. I'm no
longer on the team and thus had to pay
Oiarket value for my shoes. Theoretical
ly, I could choose whatever brand I
wanted. But all I could find were Nike
ishoes on the walls. I immediately recog

nized the different styles and their func
tion — I had been socialized to think
that Nike is king and all other running
shoes fall short in comparison. I finally
found a good pair that wasn't too gim
micky, a bit ugly, but within my price
range. Yet something kept tugging at my
conscience. I asked myself, am I really
buying this pair because it's what I'm
looking for, or is it because it has that
cool swoosh? For purely economic pur
poses, I decided to look around and give
the other brands a chance.
It was at this moment that my life
was changed forever.
A 9-year-old girl and her father were
looking at soccer shoes. As the father
carefully examined the pair of Nikes, I
overheard the girl say, "I don't like
Nikes, Daddy. They're made by kids." As
the father ignored his child, the little

girl continued and said, "I don't like
Nikes. I read in my Weekly Reader that
little kids in other countries make Nikes
and only get paid seven cents a day."
The father continued to ignore his
daughter, and I felt as though I should
approach the man and support his
daughter's admirable stand against
social injustice. But I figured it would be
very awkward to admit I was eavesdrop
ping on other people's conversations and
did not approach them.
Instead, I dropped the Nikes I had
chosen and bought anot her brand of
shoes for the first time in seven years. It
turned out the other shoes were cheaper
and looked a lot cooler than the ones 1
was going to buy. The only difference
was that, instead of a swoosh, my new
shoes had three diagonal striped lines.
So far, life with the new shoes hasn't

been all that different. The shoes are
snug, they provide the same balance
and support, I don't run any slower,
and, surprisingly enough, I am still
accepted within my social sphere. I
have finally figured out that contrary to
what Nike has been implicitly telling
me for the last decade, the shoes (or the
swoosh) don't make the man / woman.
So now I question why I didn't come to
this conclusion earlier.
I guess for me it was a matter of iden
tity. I went along with the socially pre
scribed norm and said "Just Do It" like
every other lemming. It's just funny
that after four years of college, it took
the words of a little girl to finally make
me realize I shouldn't just do it — I
should question it.
