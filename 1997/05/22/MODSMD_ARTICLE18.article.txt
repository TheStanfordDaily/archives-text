# Stein was wrong in column on Kushner's 'Angels in America'
## 
### 
; Teri Stein's gooey Monday column
worshipping Tony Kushner turned my
itomach.
* I've read Kushner's plays, and he is a
(ousy writer. If he had submitted his play
{is a paper for a Stanford English class
mid received the comment, "h prawls,
he makes improbable connect is, he
Contradicts himself," the last part would
not have read, as Stein's did, "in short, he
dazzles," but rather "in short, C-minus."
; If "Angels in America" is so poorly
written, why then did it receive
Widespread acclaim? Because it's the
AIDS play.
! It is a play about homosexuals con
tracting AIDS, and the theater commu
nity figured this play would be an
acceptable vehicle to squeeze sympathy

out of the public on a grand scale, much
like "Rent" is doing today in musical
theater form.
If Kushner's play had been about a
topic that did not affect many in the the
ater community, chances are "Angels in
America" would be lost among the multi
tude of mediocre plays floating around
unproduced.
Certainly many of the staples of
English literature are staples because
they were the first popular books to dis
cuss a particular issue. However, dis
cussing a particular issue first does not
imply that it is discussed well.
Kushner is a far cry from being a "tal
isman of hope" or a "navigational tool for
the future" and least of nil an angel with
murmuring wings, as Stein so sickeningly
wants us to believe.
He is just a guy who wrote a play
about the topic of the day and who was in
the right place at the right time to get it
produced.
