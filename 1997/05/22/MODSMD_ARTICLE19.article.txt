# Oxfeld's column was 'sour grapes,' should not have been printed

Shame on The Daily for printing
Jesse Oxfeld's Tuesday column.
Editor in Chief Elizabeth Goldman
would have been justified in censoring
this spiteful and — to be frank — feebU
cry for sympathy.
Oxfeld's reasoning seems thus: He
lost an election for editor in chief and
he had to be the most qualified candi
date, ergo democracy doesn't work.
Thanks for ending several centuries ot
debate, Jesse.
Sour grapes seldom make for good
wine. Please, Daily, for future reference,
stop serving vinegar in public.
