Admit it. You've said this.
It probably came after a disappoint
ing grade on that test that you just
didn't have enough time to study for.(It
was all of those dance lessons and
lacrosse practices.)
Stanford has thousands of amazing
people who write books, compose music
and make scientific breakthroughs.
These legions are a cliche straight out of
some admissions propaganda. But they
make you feel good. After all, you were
qualified enough to be one of the few, the
proud — a Stanford student.
However, while their hypothetical exis
tence is comforting, their actual presence
is rather annoying. Who wants to beaten
on test after test by that math prodigy or
be in a section where that champion
debater tears your ideas to shreds?
In fact, you start to get a nagging feel
ing that maybe you were the 2,064 th per

son admitted to Stanford — the last one
they took.
It's a paradox; the better the students
the better the reputation of Stanford, but
at the same time, the better the students
the worse you are in comparison.
From this dilemma stems the recent
debate on "well-rounded" vs. "angular"
students. Why limit the number of angu
lar students? Because they are more
threatening than well-rounded ones.
Angular students raise the curve on
physics tests and garner all of those
awards you wanted. It's easier for them to
beat you because they are better in one
subject. Well-rounded students tire more
likely to be average in individual subjects
since their strength is their breadth and
not their depth.
Stanford students like to think of
themselves as an elite when compared to
others outside the University but as an
equal when compared to other Stanford
students. Those things that tend to accen
tuate our differences undermine this
"equality" and are strenuously attacked
by students.

Proof of this comes in the criticism of
the President's Scholars program which
has been battered in several Daily editori
als over the years. The underlying
assumption of this program is that some
students are better than others and this
is damaging to the notion of Stanford
students as equal.
Or look at the unofficial mantra of
Stanford — SLE sucks. I heard it first
from my Pro Fro Ho. She scared me so
badly that I put SLE last on my list of CIV
choices even though it said that unless
you put SLE first, you wouldn't be con
sidered for the program. SLE people are
weird because they spend a lot of time
studying. They are not being well round
ed. They are threatening.
Related to this insecurity about other
Stanford students is the insecurity about
other universities. Particularly the one
that starts with the letter H.
Every time the administration initiates
an unpopular new policy, people claim
Stanford is trying to become like Harvard.
By this theory, a Daily reporter asserted
that the Food Research Institute was closed

in an attempt to "Harvardize" Stanford.
Even though this interpretation had no
basis in fact, it was given credibility because
of our unconscious fears of Harvard.
When Chelsea picked Stanford, it was
not merely an affirmation of the Universi
ty, but a forceful rejection of Harvard,
according to students. Notice that George
town, Brown and Wellesley wore not men
tioned. We don't care about those schools.
The H word scares Stanford people
because of our insecurity about whether
we really are better or even equivalent to
the Evil Empire. We say that wo are, that
Harvard students are boring, have no lives
and study all the time. But deep down, we
are not so sure.
I am certainly not. Getting rejected
from Harvard was one of the great disap
pointments of my life. Three years after
the fact, I rationalize it away. 1 should
have gone to Edina High School and not
St. Louis Park High. Or maybe Harvard
just made a mistake. After all, Stanford
thought I was a good enough prospect to
make me a President's Scholar. Or maybe
my life is better because 1 didn't got. in. I

am more happy here at Stanford than I
would ever have been at Harvard, so
maybe my rejection was a good thing.
The insecurity and rationalizations of
Stanford students are not unexpected.
After all, we have all been told all of our
lives how great we were as students, how
smart we were. Meeting 5,000 other peo
ple like you is sort of scary and this doesn't
even include the others at the II school,
who might even be better.
But to deny people entrance to the
Stanford club because they may be
smarter in one area, but less well-rounded
overall, is wrong. Painful as it may be, you
have to come to terms with your weak
nesses at some point. Angular people sim
ply speed up that process.

Rachel Kolman Marshak, a junior major
ing in political science, saved her Har
vard rejection letter so she can burn it on
stage when she receives her honorary doc
torate from Harvard.
