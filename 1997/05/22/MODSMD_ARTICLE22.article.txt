# Graduating?
## Options for the uninsured 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Many students graduating from Stanford run into
a serious problem the day after graduation: They no
longer have any health insurance.
There are insurance options available to these sud
denly insuranceless souls. However, these options cost
money.
A number of insurance companies offer individual
health insurance, and some even offer immediate
short-term insurance coverage. The costs vary, and
some insurance plans are not available in many areas.
Also, women may have to pay higher premiums than
men, as they tend to need more medical care, accord
ing to some insurance companies.
The Stanford Alumni Association sponsors a tem
porary plan for alumni through American Insurance
Administrators. For a 22-year-old man living in Palo
Alto, the premium would cost about $2.30 per day
($69 per month) depending on the duration of the
plan, said Jeff Roedel, the marketing director of AIA.
For a woman, it would cost about $2.58 per day
($77.40 per month). The plan features a $250 de
ductible, with 80 percent coverage after the deductible
is met, up to $5,000. After $5,000, coverage is 100 per
cent. Prescriptions are not covered, while doctor's of
fice visits are.
California Physicians Insurance Corp., a sub
sidiary of Blue Shield, also offers a short-term insur
ance plan, said Duncan Johnson, the president of
Johnson Financial and Insurance Service, Inc. Under
its six-month temporary plan, a 22-year-old man or
woman staying in the Bay Area would pay $106 per

month for a plan with a $250 deductible. Unlike the
ALA plan, this plan would only cover major medical ex
penses; routine doctor's office visits and prescriptions
would not be covered. After the deductible was met, 80
percent of the costs up to $5,000 would be paid by the
insurance, with 100 percent coverage over $5,000.
The policy term maximum is $1 million. With a $500
deductible, premiums would fall to $79 per month and
to $63 per month with a $1,000 deductible.
Foundation Health, another insurance provider,
does not offer a temporary plan, but does offer an in
dividual plan for males or females in the Bay Area
with monthly premiums ranging from $89 per month
(for a $250 deductible) to $27 per month (for a $5,000
deductible), said Foundation representative Mark
Rindal. After the deductible is met, 85 percent is paid.
Its plan is unique, he said, because the deductible (at
the $250 or $500 levels) does not have to be met be
fore doctor visits are covered at a copayment cost of
only $15 to $20. Prescriptions at participating phar
macies only cost ass copayment for generic or $10 for
brand.
State Farm offers a major medical plan at a cost of
$95 per month for a 22-year-old man living in Santa
Clara County, and $188 per month for women, said
State Farm Agent Ron Emelio. The plan covers only
major medical care — no doctor's office visits — and
has a $500 deductible. The plan covers 80 percent of
costs up to $8,000, when 100 percent of costs are cov
ered. There is a $1 million lifetime maximum.
Finally, Blue Cross offers a health maintenance or
ganization plan, similar to Cardinal Care, with no de
ductibles for $90 per month. However, students do not
have access to Cowell.
