# Before it was Cowell: health center history
## 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
In the early 19205, Stanford had no
health center for students. It all began
with Thomas A. Storey, then the head
of the Stanford health service.
Storey asked two of his wife's
friends if they would allow ill and re
covering students to stay in their
homes from time to time. The women
consented; this was the beginning of
the tradition of student "rest homes"
on campus.
Students were cared for informally
in this manner until 1928 when the
Stanford Mothers Club voted to as
sume sponsorship of the rest homes.
The female students who were sick
staved in the home of one of the moth

ers until 1936.
Men wore housed at several resi
dences through the years, watched
over by several women.
The Stanford Mothers Club per
sonally maintained the facilities and
provided the furniture as well as a
garden. They also built a fund for
emergency needs.
Stanford's health service started in
the women's gym, now Roble Gym. In
1966, the Henry Cowell Foundation
funded the building of the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
Cowell also funded health centers
at San Jose State, Santa Clara Uni
versity, UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis, Uni
versity of the Pacific and Mills Col
lege.
The 27,000-square-foot structure

replaced the facility at the women's
fO'm and the rest homes. Cowell's sec
ond floor served as an infirmary
where students could stay overnight.
Cowell started out with 12 physi
cians. It presently has only five physi
cians, but it also has nurse practition
ers and physician's assistants.
Since 1990, Cowell has moved
away from infirmary care. Now, stu
dents can be admitted overnight at
the Stanford Hospital or can stay in
t he observation beds during t he day at
Cowell.
Those with contagious diseases
such as chicken pox are placed in
guest rooms in some dorms.
Some of the staff members at Cow
ell are Stanford alumni members who
have seen the progress of the present
health center and have been on both
ends in the exam room.
"It's an incredible amount of fun to
work with the students," said Lisa
Webber, a Stanford graduate and a
registered nurse at Cowell.
"I'm more sensitive to the students
and can understand the students bet
ter because I've been there."

The student health center has
changed over the years. It was lo
cated in what is now Roble Gym for
a time.
