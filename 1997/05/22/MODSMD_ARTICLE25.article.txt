Despite the scorching weather in Palo Alto, it's
been chilly around Sunken Diamond. But as Mother
Nature cools off, the No. 6 Stanford baseball team is
hoping for a return to the scalding play that earned it
a top seed in the NCAA West Regional, which begins
today at 11 a.m.
As the top seed in the tournament, Stanford
will face the No. 6 seed, Northeastern (33-17),
tonight at 7.
After cruising past both Arizona and California
three weeks ago, the Cardinal (39-18, 21-9 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division) had run off a
nine-game winning streak and sat at the helm of
the Six-Pac.
But in the team's last regular-season series,
against division-rival No. 4 UCLA, the Card managed
only one win. Then, in last weekend's Pac-10 Champi
onship Series against Washington, Stanford handed
the title to Seattle in two ugly losses paved with defen
sive mistakes and pitching ineptitude.
"Our pitching and defense haven't been solid late
ly," said freshman designated hitter John Gall. "But
we've still been playing quality baseball. We've still
been close in every game."
Sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut added that
the team isn't dwelling on what went wrong last week
end.
"We're not really thinking about that," he said.
"We're looking past last weekend. You know, regional
time is about pitching. If our pitchers click, then we'll
do well."
With the West Regional starting today, the rest of
Stanford's postseason rests on the four-day, double
elimination tournament at Sunken Diamond.
Unlike the Cardinal, the Huskies have just hit their
stride. To get to the regional, the team ran off seven
straight and 14 of its last 16.
The last two victories came in a best-of-three
NCAA play-in against Mideastern Athletic Confer
ence champion Bethune-Cookman. Northeastern
blasted the Wildcats 19-3 and 7-4 to earn its slot at
the regional. The weekend before, the Huskies had
stunned the crowd at the America East Conference
tournament by winning four straight games to take

the championship. During that
series, the Huskies' .336 average
was the best in the field and their
ERA, at 1.50, was lowest.
By the end of the tournament,
Northeastern had outscored its
opponents 30-9 and outhit them
49-28.
Junior Stanford starting pitch
er Kyle Peterson (9-2) will have to
look out for junior outfielder Tim
Daley, who is riding an eight-game
hitting streak and has hit safely in
16 of the last 17 games. During

this stretch, he has broken single
season school records for hits, runs
and home runs, and his .385 bat
ting average puts him on pace to
surpass the mark in that category
as well.
Starting opposite Peterson will
be senior Matt McManus (6-3), a
right-hander known for his
impressive control. In 70 2/3
innings this season, he has struck
out 46 batters while walking only
nine.
"He doesn't have a whole lot of
walks and has only hit one batter
all season," Gerut said. "But in the
scheme of things, it doesn't really
matter. If we play our best, we'll
beat them."

The team can also count on the
added bonus of playing in front of
its home crowd.
"Home-field advantage makes a
big difference," Gall said. "To
know wo have the crowd behind us
is great, especially since we could
have gotten sent somewhere else
with a really hostile crowd."
The Cardinal-Huskies matchup
is the last of three games at
Sunken today. Fourth-seeded
Fresno State (37-26) battles third
seeded Texas A&M (39-20) for the
right to face the winner of the late
game, and second-seeded Cal
State-Fullerton (38-22-1) and
