# Golf in eighth after first day
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Staff writer 
After the first round of the NCAA Women's
Golf Championship, the Stanford team is eighth
with a 16-over-par 304.
The top three spots in the tournament parallel
Rolex's national team rankings. No. 1 Arizona
currently leads the field after the first round with
a 4-over-par 292. No. 2 Arizona State follows five
strokes behind at 297. No. 3 San Jose State trails
the Sun Devils by two strokes, sitting in third at
299.
The close concentration of the scores suggests
that top team honors could come down to the last
hole of the final round in a scenario similar to last
year's, when Arizona clinched the championship
title on then-freshman Marisa Baena's 147-yard
shot for eagle in sudden death against the Spar
tans.
In the individual standings, San Jose State's

Janice Moodie leads the pack after firing a 4-
under-par 68.
Leading the way for Stanford, senior Mhairi
McKay is tied for third with an even-par 72.
McKay shot 38 on the front nine before charging
onto the board with a 34 on the back. Senior
Andrea Baxter is tied for 26th with 12 others,
scoring a 4-over-par 76. She shot 42 on the front
nine and then came back to tie McKay's 34 for the
second-lowest score on the back nine.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro, at 39th, shot 37 on the
front nine and 40 on the back nine for a 5-over-par
77. Sophomore Michelle Sperry recovered from a
41 on the front nine, firing a 38 on the back nine
to finish at 7-over-par 79. Freshman Julie Dunn
scored 41 on the front and back nines for a 10-
over-par 82.
An 8 a.m. EDT shotgun start will kick off the
second round at the 6,101-yard, par-72 Scarlet
Course. Play will continue through Saturday's
final round.
