# Schoettler, Fontenette win Callahan
## Frisbee sweeps awards 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Last week Stanford Ultimate
Frisbee team members Jim
Schoettler and Dominique
Fontenette had won the 1997
Callahan award, given by coach
es and fellow players to the top
collegiate man and woman based
on playing ability and sports
manship.
To have players from the
same school receive this award is
unprecedented and attests to the
strength of the sport at Stanford.
"Stanford has a reputation for
being one of the best programs in
terms of spirit and gamesman
ship," Schoot' ler said.
Jennifer Donnelly, head coach
of the women's team, echoed
such sentiments.
"Both the teams have been
great, but I'm especially
impressed by the men's team,"
she said. "To play well after los
ing so many players was a real
accomplishment."
Senior Fontenette, known for
awesome throws and infectious
enthusiasm, won the award for
the women's division convincing
ly, earning more than twice the
votes of her nearest challenger.
"No player can stop her,"
Donnelly said. "She is easily

noticed; she has all of the skills."
Although she dominates the
game and instills fear in the
opposing team, she still manages
to make friends everywhere she
goes.
"When you're good, everyone
wants to know you," Donnelly
said.
Schoettler, a coterminal stu
dent known for his intensity and
intelligence, won the men's
award in a much closer race. He
was tied with Broc Adams of
North
Carolina-Wilmington for first
place until the very last vote,
which was cast by Adams him
self. In the most telling gesture
of respect, Adams voted for
Schoettler and gave him the deci
sive three-point lead.
"He's probably in the best
shape of anyone on our team,"
said senior Dan Eisenburg.
"When he runs conditioning
drills for the team, I think some
times he doesn't reali/.e that we
are suffering because it's so easy
for him."
Besides his amazing athletic
ability, Schoettler is known for
his keen eye and good judgment.
"I've never seen anyone dis
pute a call made by Jim," Eisen-
burg said.
Schoettler and Fontenette are
pleased with winning the award.
"It is the biggest individual
honor I could get in my career
here," Schoettler said.
At the outset, Fontenette was
not very sure of her chances this
year. She was sidelined last sea
son because of an ACL injury;
however, she still received votes
from teams that hadn't seen her
since the 1995 nationals, when
she played as a sophomore.
Fontenette's choice to play
Ultimate Frisbee and other
"alternative sports" like snow
boarding and surfing attests to
her tendency to do things a little
differently.
In high school, Fontenette
played tennis and some basket
ball. She knew she couldn't play
tennis at Stanford unless she
was nationally ranked, and she
didn't think that running to stay
in shape was going to cut it.
Fontenette's first exposure to
Stanford's Ultimate Frisbee
came when she was a prospective
freshman. She was walking with
some friends to a chemistry
class, when she ran straight into
a pole. Feeling a little bit dazed,
she decided not to attend the

class.
Instead, she wandered around
the campus and stopped at Roble
Field to watch some women play
ing. Impressed by the skills on
display, she tried out in the fall
of her freshman year. She imme
diately displayed talent with the
sport, making the women's A
team and establishing herself as
a phenom.
Schoettler followed a different
path to success. Growing up in
Colorado, he played track, soccer
and basketball in high school. He
was drawn to Stanford by the
weather and family tradition â€”
both of his parents attended
Stanford as well as uncles,
aunts, grandmothers and sib
lings. Last year, he graduated
with a bachelor's in chemistry
and economics, and he is cur
rently pursuing his master's this
year in chemistry.
During his first year on the
Farm, Schoettler played on the
men's B team. He made the A
team his sophomore year and
has been improving since.
"The reason I play is that I
enjoy it, and the men on the
team are some of the best people
I've ever met," Schoettler said.
"I don't play because I'm good."
However, Schoettler is good,
partly because of his intensity
and fierce competitiveness. Ear
lier this season, during practice
on Roble Field, he was playing

near the construction fence that
divides the field. He made a leap
ing catch for a long throw, and
punctured his lower lip on one of
the barbs at the top of the fence.
The collision also chipped his
tooth and earned him several
trips to the dentist.
"It was pretty close to a
frontal lobotomy," said sopho
more Omer Atesman, "and
shows how much of a Superman-
Don Juan-Don Quixote-Erik
Estrada kind of guy he is."
This summer, Schoettler
plans to hike the Pacific Coast
Trail, which covers a path from
Canada to Mexico, with a friend.
He made the decision last winter
while looking for jobs when he
realized that many businessmen
seemed unhappy and unhealthy.
He decided to do something that
he'd probably never got an
opportunity to do again
"I was fighting with myself to
say, 'Screw it,' and to do what 1
want for a year," Schoettler
said.
Fontenette, a human biology
major, will also 1m? taking next
year off. She plans to live in San
Francisco with an aunt, do some
volunteering and work in the
Humane Society. During the
winter she will be a ski instruc
tor in Colorado.
"1 want to do what I want to
do before I go to mod school,"
she explained.
