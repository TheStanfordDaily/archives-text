## Frisbee sweeps awards 
### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Last week Stanford Ultimate
Frisbee team members Jim
Schoettler and Dominique
Fontenette had won the 1997
Callahan award, given by coach
es and fellow players to the top
collegiate man and woman based
on playing ability and sports
manship.
To have players from the
same school receive this award is
unprecedented and attests to the
strength of the sport at Stanford.
"Stanford has a reputation for
being one of the best programs in
terms of spirit and gamesman
ship," Schoot' ler said.
Jennifer Donnelly, head coach
of the women's team, echoed
such sentiments.
"Both the teams have been
great, but I'm especially
impressed by the men's team,"
she said. "To play well after los
ing so many players was a real
accomplishment."
Senior Fontenette, known for
awesome throws and infectious
enthusiasm, won the award for
the women's division convincing
ly, earning more than twice the
votes of her nearest challenger.
"No player can stop her,"
Donnelly said. "She is easily

noticed; she has all of the skills."
Although she dominates the
game and instills fear in the
opposing team, she still manages
to make friends everywhere she
goes.
"When you're good, everyone
wants to know you," Donnelly
said.
Schoettler, a coterminal stu
dent known for his intensity and
intelligence, won the men's
award in a much closer race. He
was tied with Broc Adams of
North
Carolina-Wilmington for first
place until the very last vote,
which was cast by Adams him
self. In the most telling gesture
of respect, Adams voted for
Schoettler and gave him the deci
sive three-point lead.
"He's probably in the best
shape of anyone on our team,"
said senior Dan Eisenburg.
"When he runs conditioning
drills for the team, I think some
times he doesn't reali/.e that we
are suffering because it's so easy
for him."
Besides his amazing athletic
ability, Schoettler is known for
his keen eye and good judgment.
"I've never seen anyone dis
pute a call made by Jim," Eisen-
