# Osterloh and Scott on course for collision in final
## Women advance to semis 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Another day has passed in the NCAA Women's
Tennis Singles Championship, and the Cardinal is
still busy winning. Stanford's two remaining partic
ipants, freshman Lilia Osterloh and junior Julie
Scott, have reached the national semifinals at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium at 3 p.m. today.
The same is true for doubles, where Scott and
junior Ania Bleszynski also clinched a trip to the
national semifinals at 5 p.m. with yesterday's win.
Osterloh, the No. 8 seed in the tournament,
eliminated the No. 4 seed, Agnes Muzamel from
Mississippi. Osterloh steamrolled Muzamel in
straight sets 6-0, 6-1.
"Lilia was really revved up out there," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "I was glad to see her come
back from that doubles loss yesterday. Her legs had
a lot of pop in them, and she was hitting the ball
really well. And her opponent was tough, so that
was quite impressive."
With the win, Osterloh earned a meeting with
the top seed in the draw, Duke's Karin Miller.
Osterloh and Miller are the country's two top
ranked freshmen. Osterloh, who has not lost a
match since losing to Scott at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships in April, is ranked No. 13 in
the most recent poll, while Miller sits at No. 3.
Miller defeated San Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova to
advance 7-5, 6-4.
"I think Lilia can handle her," Brennan said.
"We'll see what happens, but I think Lilia will win.
Miller is tough, but Lilia has the firepower to han
dle most of her stuff."
Miller compiled a 22-2 record in the dual-match
season at the No. 2 singles spot for Duke and went
39-4 overall, including off-season tournaments.
However, Cardinal freshman Anne Kremer got
the best of Miller in Stanford's 5-1 win in the
national team semifinals last Saturday in a
straight-set win.
In the other half of the bracket, the Cardinal
sent another contestant into the semifinals in Scott.
A three-set victory over Blue Devil sophomore
Vanessa Webb clinched the berth for Scott, who is
on an incredible roll since the team championship
four days ago.
"She just keeps fighting and clawing and playing
well," Brennan said. "She is going on emotion right
now. She is pretty inspirational."
After winning a first-set tie-breaker, the Cardi
nal junior dropped the second set to Webb, the third
seed in the tournament and the No. 1 player in the
Duke lineup. Scott fought on, however, and com
pleted the upset 7-6 (9-7), 4-6, 6-4.
"I was really tired at first," Scott said after play
ing three matches the previous day. "But once I got
going, my muscles started to loosen up. Then the
adrenaline got going, and I forgot about all that."
Scott's path to the finals goes through a familiar
Cardinal foe, freshman M.C. White from Florida,
who advanced with an easy victory over Duke's
Wendy Fix 6-2, 6-3.
"I am just going to go out there and have fun
today," Scott said. "I have been playing well so far,
so I hope I can just stay loose and be rested for a
good match."
White competed at the No. 3 spot for the Gators
