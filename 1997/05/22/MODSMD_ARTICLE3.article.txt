University President Gerhard Casper
has announced several initiatives de
signed to push technology even further
into the classroom, to market the educa
tional technology that Stanford research
produces, and to extend distance learn
ing programs into Silicon Valley and be
yond.
"Technology offers the potential to

enhance Stanford's academic leadership
position and reputation worldwide,"
Casper said to the Faculty Senate last
week. "Technology may enhance income
opportunities for the University and po
tentially reduce costs of deliveringeduca
tion."
Casper announced the creation of the
Stanford Learning Lab, designed to help
faculty members integrate technology
into their courses. He also announced a
new Educational Ventures Office to ex

plore ways to market educational prod
ucts and create partnerships with busi
ness, government and other educational
institutions.
There are also plans to expand the
Stanford Center for Professional Devel
opment, which oversees the Stanford In
structional Television Network, into new
subject areas and make it a resource for
professional schools at Stanford that
wish to offer distance learning
programs. The center currently
provides such programs through
out the country and abroad.
The new initiatives received
Casper's support after being pro
posed by the Commission on Tech
nology in Teaching and Learning,
which he established in 1994.
The Stanford Learning Lab
will be headed by Larry Leifer, a
professor of mechanical engi

neering. Assisting Leifer as co-di
rectors will be English Prof.
Larry Friedlander and Sheri
Sheppard, an associate professor
of mechanical engineering.
Asked to describe the focus of
the lab, Leifer said, "Technology
is not the goal, it is a means to
achieve our learning objectives."
He said the center would focus on
"active learning" strategies.
One of the roles of the lab will
be to examine how technology can
be incorporated into large lecture
classes. "The faculty wants to look
at a lot of the larger lecture class
es: maybe the new CIV program,

maybe the Science Core," said Ge
offrey Cox, the vice provost for in
stitutional planning.
Meanwhile, the center is ex
tending its mandate into new de
partments.
"For example, we're going to
export classes in geophysics and
petroleum engineering to oil com
panies, and that's something
we've never done before," said
Anthony DiPaolo, the center's ex
ecutive director. He added that
the center wants to be available to
work with other professional
schools interested in offering re
mote classes.
