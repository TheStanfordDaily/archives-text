# Twin runners share more than love of sport
## 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
NOTE: This is the second in a
three-part series about twins
involved in Stanford sports.
What has four arms, four legs
and one cross country national

championship? That's right,
sophomores Brad and Brent
Mauser.
The identical twin brothers
competed for the title last fall
with the Stanford cross country
team. Both currently compete
for the Stanford track team,

which will be winding up its sea
son in the next couple of weeks.
Both is a word that can't be left
out when talking about the broth
ers. Given a bit of Draw freedom,
they chose to live together this
year. As freshmen, they were on
opposite sides of campus.
"They did that on purpose,"
Brad said. "I tried to get in to a
dorm on the other side, but they
said they didn't have any spaces."
This made things difficult con
sidering the two share a lot of their
wardrobe.
"[ would go over to | Brent's| at
8 in the morning. Then I'd go to
class, stay there and study at night.
I'd go back to my place and just
crash. Then I'd go over again at H
the next morning."
Clothing is not the only thing
the twins have in common. They
are both human biology majors,
and both would like to explore the
field of sports medicine.
"We're interested in anatomy
and athletics; sports medicine com
bines those two," Brent said.
Both are interested in medical
school after Stanford, although
their education may bo put on hold
for awhile. The two would like? to
continue their running careers.
"We'd like to run in the 2000
Olympics and maybe even run
through the 20UA Olympics," Brad
said.
So was it a collective decision lo
come to Stanford?

Brent deferred this question to
his brother.
"We wore willing to split il a
school didn't have a place for both
of us," Brad said.
The two decided early on Stan
ford. They had run with several
members of the Stanford team
while in high school.
"We didn't want to go some
where wit h a Iprogram We were
looking for a building program. Wo
knew that Stanford was building
its program" with head coach Vin
Lananna, Brad said
Brent was quick to add that
Stanford's academic reputation
also played a role in t he decision.
The two have been very close all
their lives They started out on the
soccer field and got into track in
t he sovent h grade.
"We first got interested in run
ning when our older brother went
out for the cros. country team
after he had a soccer injury," Brad
said. "We started to take it serious
ly our freshman year in high
school." He gave up soccer first;
Brent followed the next year
The brothers have always been
interested in distance event "We
knew from soccer that wÂ» didn't
have the peed We never had the
speed and agility," Brad said. I low
ever, the two certainly have long
term sp^'d
Both have qualified lot N'CA.V
