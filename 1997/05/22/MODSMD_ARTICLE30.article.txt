# Twin runners share more than love of sport
## 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
NOTE: This is the second in a
three-part series about twins
involved in Stanford sports.
What has four arms, four legs
and one cross country national

championship? That's right,
sophomores Brad and Brent
Mauser.
The identical twin brothers
competed for the title last fall
with the Stanford cross country
team. Both currently compete
for the Stanford track team,

which will be winding up its sea
son in the next couple of weeks.
Both is a word that can't be left
out when talking about the broth
ers. Given a bit of Draw freedom,
they chose to live together this
year. As freshmen, they were on
opposite sides of campus.
"They did that on purpose,"
Brad said. "I tried to get in to a
dorm on the other side, but they
said they didn't have any spaces."
This made things difficult con
sidering the two share a lot of their
wardrobe.
"[ would go over to | Brent's| at
8 in the morning. Then I'd go to
class, stay there and study at night.
I'd go back to my place and just
crash. Then I'd go over again at H
the next morning."
Clothing is not the only thing
the twins have in common. They
are both human biology majors,
and both would like to explore the
field of sports medicine.
"We're interested in anatomy
and athletics; sports medicine com
bines those two," Brent said.
Both are interested in medical
school after Stanford, although
their education may bo put on hold
for awhile. The two would like? to
continue their running careers.
"We'd like to run in the 2000
Olympics and maybe even run
through the 20UA Olympics," Brad
said.
So was it a collective decision lo
come to Stanford?

Brent deferred this question to
his brother.
"We wore willing to split il a
school didn't have a place for both
of us," Brad said.
The two decided early on Stan
ford. They had run with several
members of the Stanford team
while in high school.
"We didn't want to go some
where wit h a Iprogram We were
looking for a building program. Wo
knew that Stanford was building
its program" with head coach Vin
Lananna, Brad said
Brent was quick to add that
Stanford's academic reputation
also played a role in t he decision.
The two have been very close all
their lives They started out on the
soccer field and got into track in
t he sovent h grade.
"We first got interested in run
ning when our older brother went
out for the cros. country team
after he had a soccer injury," Brad
said. "We started to take it serious
ly our freshman year in high
school." He gave up soccer first;
Brent followed the next year
The brothers have always been
interested in distance event "We
knew from soccer that w» didn't
have the peed We never had the
speed and agility," Brad said. I low
ever, the two certainly have long
term sp^'d
Both have qualified lot N'CA.V

in the 10,000 meters and the 5,000
meters next month. They're not
sure yet whether they will run
together, but a lot of their success
can be attributed to doing so.
"He'd always get a good time in
a race. Then I'd have to get a better
time," Brent said of their high
school races."I always followed
Brad in high school. I think I'm at
the point now where I don't
depend on him during a race.
Coach Lananna has done a lot to
get me to this point. He started
separating us in the little meets."
Competition between the two
has always been positive, and the
brothers are very close.

"There was this period of about
three years when we'd fight every
day," Brad said. The two have
since outgrown their differences
and are perfectly content to be
around each other most of the
time. In fact, always being consid
ered together, "doesn't bother us
at all," Brent said.
"The longest we've been apart
from each other was like two
weeks," Brad added.
So have they taken advantage of
being identical twins?
"We switched classes in high
school, but that's about it," Brad
said.
It would be difficult to do that
here because the two have identi
cal schedules. They had to suffer
through separate CIVs and their
freshman writing classes were dif
ferent, as was one DR, but they've

tackled most classes together.
"We study together. I'll wake
Brad up for class or he'll wake me
up," Brent said.
The transition from Houston to
Stanford was easy for the brothers.
"We had each other. Our high
school team was a lot like the team
here, so that wasn't a big transi
tion," Brad said.
The two do like the area. "The
weather is always gorgeous mid
the area is beautiful. We don't
have much time to do stuff other
than study and run though," they
explained.
There is one difference between
the two, but it took some search
ing. Brad has a tattoo of a winged
foot, and Brent's is of Uoadrunner.
They did, however, get them at the
same time. They even have them
on the same leg, the right.
