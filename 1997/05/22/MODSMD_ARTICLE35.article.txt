Autos burglarized near Foothills
Two cars were burglarized Monday between
7:45 and 9 p.m. on Stanford Avenue just off of Ju
nipero Serra Drive, said Stanford Police Lt. Del
Bandy.
A window was smashed in both instances. A
purse was removed from the first car, and nothing
was stolen from the second.
The Stanford Police suspects that the burglar
ies were the work of the same person or persons.
"They like to come back to the same area,"
Bandy added.
The burglars "know that people place their be
longings in their cars after they park them to jog,"
Bandy said. "People should store and lock their be
longings in the trunk instead."

If anyone has seen any suspicious activity, con
tact the Stanford Police can be contacted at 723-
9633.

Firefighters had to use an electric drill with a ti
tanium bit last Thursday to free a sophomore from
the bike lock that her friends had secured around
her neck.
The Palo Alto Fire Department arrived at Ar
royo shortly before 8 p.m. to find the 19-year-old
with a Kryptonite U-lock around her neck. Fire
fighters brought the woman back to the station to
execute the removal procedure.
