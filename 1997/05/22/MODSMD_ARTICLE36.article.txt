# Daily fooled by lottery prankster
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial writer 
The black-and-white photo and accompanying
story on the front page of yesterday's Daily belied
something rather simple: Freshman Jim Czaja, lower
right, did not win the New York State Lottery.
The celebrating dormmates in the background,
however, are not forgeries. They, just like this news
paper, were fooled by the prank.
The joke arose when Czaja and freshman James
Greene, dressed up for a Mother's Day dinner, whim
sically explained their semiformal attire by suggest
ing to only one person that the Czajas had won the lot
tery.
That person relayed the fib to other Otero dorm-

mates, who, in turn, told more people. The rumor
eventually reached the ears of Daily editors, and a
story was assigned.
The writers were let in on the joke and proceeded to
craft a work of fiction, but we editors, too foolish to
verify the story with the New York State Lottery
Commission, printed it.
It is fitting that yesterday's paper, because of the
record set by Stanford athletes, will undoubtedly be
added to the "Wall of Fame," a line of yellowed front
pages that look down on our main newsroom. Cer
tainly we deserve the subtle mockery it will cast down
for many years.
We certainly hope Czajas take their just desserts as
well when they receive a call from the IRS, who will
also be receiving a copy.
