# ASSU passes 1997-98 budget
## Few changes from last year but increased presidential stipend 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate made the last half-hour of the
1996-97 session one of the most meaningful early yes
terday morning, approving a nearly $200,000 operat
ing budget.
The 1997-98 budget — with total expenditures of
$198,926 — departs little from the 1996-97 budget.
The most notable differences in the new budget are
the elimination of the senate clerk position, with its
$1,000 stipend redirected to the senate deputy
chair.
The budget also includes higher salaries for the
ASSU president, vice president and cabinet members.
The new budget eliminated the assistant program
board director, a position that was not filled last year,
and consolidated elections committee staff positions
under one stipend to be used at the discretion of the
elections commissioner.
"We reduced (the budget) minimally," said ASSU
Senator Maren Norton, chair of the Budget and Fi
nance Committee. "There weren't any major
changes."
The lack of change between the budgets does not

reflect a lack of scrutiny or solicited advice by the com
mittee, Norton said. "I felt that we did a lot of our
homework," she said. "A lot of senators saw a lot of
drafts I felt really strongly that overall it was a re
ally good budget."
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall was pleased
with the final figures. He said the committee did a
tremendous job weighing the multiple interests of the
ASSU agencies, and the budget was a great piece of
work."
Under the budget, ASSU President Emily Andrus
will earn $6,000 next year. ASSU Vice President Ben
Decker will be paid $3,500, and the combined wages of
the presidential cabinet will total $5,000. Bill Shen
earned $4,500 this year as ASSU president, and Vice
President Nick Thompson received $2,500.
The senate passed the budget just after midnight
yesterday morning, during an impromptu — and pos
sibly unconstitutional — closed session. The ASSU
Constitution states that meetings may be closed to
discuss "proprietary business practices" but that "in
formation regarding the general content of a closed
meeting and the reason for the closure shall be made
available to the public 72 hours in advance of the
meeting."
