classes and work closely with faculty artists.
Throughout the two-year course of study,
each student develops a body of work,
with examples exhibited in a thesis exhibi
tion in the Stanford Art Gallery. This year's
degree candidates are Margaret Crane,
Melanie Klein, Greg Lam Niemeyer, Rigo
97 and Jaime Snyder. The exhibit, which
opened Tuesday, runs through June 15..
It's free and open to the public.

Albee's "Zoo Story," a short piece, about

ginia Woolf?" at Kennedy Grove (next to

p.m. Thursday through Saturday with
matinees at 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

groups of 10 or more. Call 392-4400.

Opera
FRI*23-JUN*I
West Bay Opera presents Mozart's "The
Magic Flute." While this fascinating opera
provides many insights into an enchanted
world of music and thoughtful journeys of
self-discovery, the humor is captured by
Ross Halper's witty English translation.
"The Magic Flute" shows, as music com
mentator Erik Smith observes, the impres
sion that "all the 18th century irony about
the war of the sexes was replaced by an ex
otic fairy tale with mystical elements, fea
tures of the new German Romanticism."
The opera is lyrical, sublime and aptly
mystical. You can catch it at the Lucie Stern
Theater, 1305 Middlefield Road, Ftalo Alto.
Tickets are $15 - $30. The show is at 8:15
p.m. Friday and Saturday, with a Sunday
matinee at 2 p.m. Call 424-9999 for de
tails.

Music
FRI *23
Two voices, two guitars and two com
posers — that's what you get with
Nashville stars Gillian Welch and David
Rowlings. Welch's voice can be feathery
soft one moment and gritty the next, an ef
fect that is enhanced by Rowlings' moun
tain drawl. Their songs are compassionate
and downright Appalachian / bluegrass
brand of country. Their sweet harmonies
are influenced by the rigors of life in the
West Virginian hills, and their guitar play
ing is assisted by possession of six fingers
on each hand. They are playing at the Villa
Montalvo, a nonprofit arts center nestled
in the foothills above Saratoga, where you
can catch them this weekend. Tickets are
$20. The Villa opens at 7 p.m.; the perfor
mance is at 8 p.m. at 15400 Montalvo
Road, Saratoga. Call (408) 741-3421 for
details.

THUR-22
The Stanford Film Society presents a one
time screening of Stanford filmmaker
Gabe Weisert's "Fishing with Gandhi."
With a talented cast of Stanford students,
this zany road movie takes us on a hitch
hiker's journey through California to meet
his neurotic friends in San Francisco. Cov
ering such varied subjects as 1,000-foot
restraining orders, puppy diseases, electri
cal heart explorations, upside-down blood
fountains and feeling empty inside, this is
sure to be a film that will please all audi
ences. After the screening, the filmmaker
will be available for a Q&A session. This
event is free and will take place at 8 p.m. in
Building 260, Room 113. Call Roberto Ca
dena at 497-1265 for more information.
