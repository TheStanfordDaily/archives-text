## Indie Theater musical 'Falsettos' is the, real thing 
### 
a ~r™lour Jews in a Room Bitching" — the title of the first
l-H song alone should make you want to see "Falsettos,"
.A. the musical comedy-drama premiering tonight in
Memorial Auditorium's Little Theater.
Freshman Andrew Leeds, who played Jason in the 1992
Broadway production of "Falsettos,' by William Finn and
James Lapine, brings his own adaptation to the Stanford theater
scene. The two-act musical marks the first effort of the newly es
tablished Indie Theater group, formed in January to produce
quality theater in the tradition of Ram's Head.
Blending outrageous humor with poignant drama, "Falset
tos" explores themes of love, sexuality and loss in human rela
tionships. The play stars freshman Eugene Walters as Marvin,
devoted father and husband, who has fallen in love with his
friend, Whizzer (freshman Nathan Bavnard). In her distress,
Marvin's wife, Trina (sophomore Alicia I izama), begins an af-

fair with her psychiatrist, Mendel (ju

nior Jeremy Sawyer), while their

hyper-intelligent son, Jason,

is left to draw his own con

elusions about thechaot
ic situation. The second

act introduces lesbian
lovers Dr. Charlotte
(senior Jane I.ee) and
Cordelia (sophomore
Brandi Jensen). Final-

ly, a sudden crisis

forces the characters to

come to grips with issues

that, in some form, extend

to everyone who has ever

truly loved.

Leeds and producer Ephraim

Luft, a freshman, have assembled an impressive group of seven
actors, selected from an audition pool of about 40. "1 was really
surprised how well auditions turned out," Luft noted. "We were
really lucky to find a group that worked so well together."
The strain of 30 hours of rehearsal per week has not been
enough to diminish the chemistry between cast members, but it
has made a noticeable difference in the life of the play's director.
Shouldering the responsibility for such an awesome production,
feeds has found himself struggling to find time to pause for
breath. Kntire nights spent in the Little Theater are proof of his
dedication.
In addition to their outstanding acting ability, three of the
cast members have had especially rigorous musical experiences

at Stanford. Walters and Sawyer arc current members
of a cappella groups Kveryday People and Mixed
Company, respectively, and lee is a former member
of Kveryday People.
Good thing, too. In a show with over two hours of
continuous music, the actors, as well as musical di
rectors 'lodd Feldman and Jennifer ('hou, were faced
with a serious challenge. But between the power of
William Finn's music and the vocals, their job has
been nowhere near as difficult as it might have been
with a lesser work.
" The music is so intelligent, fun, complex," said
Feldman, a computer science graduate student who is
also the vocal director for the show. 1 le described his
role in the play's production as "a real joy." In his ten
years of musical directing, Feldman added, he "has
never worked with people with better attitudes and
the desire to do more than they're expected to do."

Chou shared Feldmans enthusiasm about working with
Leeds and his multitalented cast. "They sound fabulous," sin
s.iid. "My only regret is that we didn't have another three weeks
to make it as perfect as it has the potential to be."
Perfect or not, "falsettos" promises tobeoneofthe most en
tertaining shows this year.
