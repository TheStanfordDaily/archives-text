# The 						Bard with a Twist
## The 						Royal Shakespeare Company unerringly walks the boards 
### 
William Shakespeare's "(Comedy of Errors" begins in the
ancient town of Ephesus, where an old man named
Aegeon from Syracuse is set for execution at the end of
the day. The law in Ephesus forbids any Syracusian from enter
ing because of the enmity between the two cities. Aegeon, how
ever, pleads his case to the duke. 1 le has come to try to find his
sons. He tells a woeful tale of sailing with his wife and twin sons,
both named Antipholus, and also the twin Dromios, babies
bought to be his sons' slaves.
Unfortunately, a rock splits the ship. Aegeon's wife, Aemilia,
with one of the sons and one of the Dromios, is saved by a fleet
of fishermen. Aegeon is saved by a different ship, and he spends
his life bringing up his other son and one Dromio with no
knowledge of where the others have gone. 1 tearing this tale, the
duke allows Aegeon to live if he can find someone to pay 1,000
guilders. Aegeon, however, says he knows no one in the town
and assumes he will be killed by sunset.
From here the tale becomes less tragic and evolves into a full
fledged Shakespearean comedy. One of the brothers, Antipho
lus of Syracuse, has come to Ephesus on business and with the
hope of finding his lost brother. Unbeknownst to him, his
brother, Antipholus of Ephesus, lives in the town as a highly re
garded citizen. He also happens to be married, while Antipho
lus of Syracuse is not.
With the twins and their twin slaves about the town, the play
begins to emerge as a believable tale of mistaken identity. Chaos
quickly ensues as everyone begins to mistake the brothers and
their slaves for each other. In a predictable but very amusing
twist of fate, the wife of Antipholus of Ephesus, Adriana, mis
takes Antipholus of Syracuse for her husband. She invites him
home to dinner and locks out her rightful mate. The play con
tinues in this fashion, building on the possibilities for confusion
and retribution.
This tale, one of Shakespeare's earliest plays, is not particular

ly moving or intricate. However, if you have ever seen the Royal
Shakespeare Company perform, you would understand that a
bad performance of even a mediocre script is rare for them. Not
only did they match my expectations of an excellent perfor
mance, the company exceeded the expectations of the audience.
The Royal Shakespeare Company is a theater company based

iii London. It tours quite olten and did .in acclaimed perlor
manccof "A Midsummer's Night I )ream" last year in S.m I ran
cisco. Their interpretation ol that famous play was the best I 've
seen: modern without seeming far fetched, .slapstick without
seeming stupid and sometimes wildly interpretative without
seeming wrong.
This performance of "A (lomedyol Trrors" was excellent in
much the same way. The Royal Shakespeare (Company added
music to the script, using interesting I.astern instruments to
evoke the environment of fphesus, a town on the coast ol
Turkey. This music was effective in evoking both mood and
character and was stylistically beautiful in itself.
The acting was impeccable. The lead ac tor, Robert Bowman,
was able to convinc mgly portray both the slapstit k and serious
sides of Antipholus ol Syracuse. The other star in the cast,
Thusita Jayasundera, played l.uciana, the sister ol Adri.uia. In
many cases, her slight body language conveyed more than her
lines, finally, both Dromios, played by Dan Milne and brie
Mai let t, were able to draw hilarity from mere looks. As usual,
the set was sparse and did not change throughout the piece. I he
costumes were appropriate suits and dresses from the 1980s
Wall Street world.
Undoubtedly, what made the play work was the incredible
interpretive powers of this company, directed in this case by
Tim Supple. The ability of the cast to write between the lines
things that Shakespeare may or may not have meant, and to do
so with humor and wit, is unrivaled. Once yon have seen the
Royal Shakespeare (Company do Shakespeare with .1 twist, you
never want to see Shakespeare interpreted classically again.
My advice is that although this run of this piece is over, never,
ever miss a chance to see the Royal Shakespeare Company at
work. It is possibly the best company in the world at interpreting
Shakespeare, elucidating his verse and making him accessible.
