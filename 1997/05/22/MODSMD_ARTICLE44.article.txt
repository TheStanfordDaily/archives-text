# THE 						A.C.T.'S 'SINGER'S BOY' BLENDS SURREAL SYMBOLISM AND FAMILY DRAMA
## Not just a boy toy 
### 
■ I ABSTRAGI I 111 Al I K AKI is your cup of tea

I the American (Conservatory Theater's production ot
Leslie Ayvazian's ethereal new play, "Singer's Boy,"

is just for you. Set in and around an ivy-encrusted
house, "Singer's Boy is an extended metaphor for

entrapment in the routine roles in life to the detri
ment ot joy in living. According to program

notes, Ayvazian, who writes plays with a strong
ly feminine perspective, chose this theme espe-

cially Because it resonates so strongly among
women.
I iving in the house that is also a metaphor
ical prison are middle-aged Grace (Academy
Award-winner Olympia Dukakis) and her
parents, the Old Man and the Old Woman

(Gerald Hi ken and Anne Pitoniak, respec
tively). (irace, who loves to talk and tell sto
ries, is the caretaker ol her senile mother and
dotty father. Iking dotty, the Old Man gets
the best linesot the play and provides much of
its comic relief.

I'nter a young, handsome handyman
Stephen Caffrey), the lover of the sensual

Singer (Michele Shay) and the Boy of the play's
title. I le comes to the house to help trim the ivy

and in the process lures (irace out ol her isolated
home. By helping the Old Man climb onto the

root of the house and reminding the Old Woman
that Grace is a woman as well as a caregiver, the Boy

is a catalyst for many of the initial changes that take
place within the family.

I ater, the Singer helps the tamiK continue its journey
~-u , n „ii,.. r u. i, ... i. u .'.

in appreciating each another, nv her example she encour
ages them to embrace their home and to remember that it

nurtures them.
I he sparse sets and costumes are reflective of the spare sto
ryline. Although the characters begin as stylized, by the end of
the play the\ are realistic. Throughout the play, Grace is ob
sessed with the story ol Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes
conquering ol the Aztecs and Mayans. An especially meaning
ful image for her is that of bloody human sacrifices atop jun
gle-covered pyramids. This violence lends a sense of the inner
workings ol her psyche to the audience.
Flowing and graceful, the pace of "Singer's Bov" might be
too slow for most audiences. Transcendence does not come to
Grace, just a glimmering rediscovery of life's wider horizons.
Somewhat uplifting, "Singer's Boy' is a gentle reminder to
caregivers, especially women, that life needs to be led for one
self as well as for others.
Given the play's quality of abstraction, the post-perfor
mance audience exchange discussion, a bonus of
A.C 71 productions, was enlightening in pro\ idinc the

cast's take on the play. The evening this play was reviewed, as
sistant director Margo Whitcomb and actress Dukakis came
onstage to address the audience.
I n regard to C irace's obsession with the pyramids in Mexico,
I )ukakis said, "It's a place in her imagination where she's total
ly free. There's something in it she responds to at a gut level —
that's a pretty literal reading. It depends on how you take it
\ in and what vou make ot it."

Whitcomb added, "Its a reflection ot the pyramids'
duality. There you're closest to the gods, but these are
also places ot horrific
sacrifice.

Ihe pyramids
straddle duality."
Through her obsession, Dukakis said Grace "is escaping,
trying to carve out the time of the day for herself. I know in my
life I have responsibilities and 1 protect for myself time to read,
think, do, be with important people, yet there are responsibil
ities."
In the play, the Boy requests music while he works. In grant
ing his request, (irace takes one more step toward opening up.
"Music serves as a design element," Whitcomb said. " The
house has an absence of music, life, light, sound. Music takes
on a gigantic symbolic proportion. It's an injection of beauty,
a catalyst tor sensuality. It represents adventurousness vs. the
routine of the chamber not."

The Old Man is obsessed with his chamber pot and carries
it with him everywhere. At one point in the play, however, he
throws his chamber pot off the roof.
"When the Old Man's obsession with the pot is gone, what
is left?" Dukakis asked of this scene. "He gets off the roof.
Women look at the actions that men take to fulfill their lives
and want to do that and act free. (But) they don't know how to
do that and still be nurturing caregivers. It's important that the
[Old Woman] becomes a mother and is perfectly prepared to
be in a partnership with her husband and that Grace is 110
longer the mother."
In addressing the meager magnitude of Grace's change

in outlook, Whitcomb said, "According to (A.C.T. Artistic
Director) Carrie Ferloff, it's not a huge leap ahead (to

where she's really transformed. It's just a little shift and
much more realistic." The change was more apparent

for the parents as they "reignited their passion for
each other and for life."

Obviously a veteran of many interviews on
"Singer's Boy," Whitcomb acknowledged that
k the title of the play could have focused on the

Singer rather than on her boy. She said that in
earlier versions of the play, the Boy had a
i • 1 ~ ci J . *1 j i • «.i-

bigger role. She described him now as "the
catalyst in bringing the people together,

bringing the singer to Grace. His role
was compressed once the Singer ap
pears....

"He's a younger man and is mo\
ing on. Vet he leaves in his wake a siti
tor her desire. She comes back to tin

house because she shares Graces
imprisonment in an oblique way.
She knew the boy would eventual!}

leave. She still lives a life and loves it
and shows Grace how to be [a care
taker] and still have a life."
AUUminU »u„ u.»u .

Although in the beginning of the
play the family seems hopelessly dys
functional, there is genuine hope .it

the end.
Whitcomb cited a scene in which
the Oid Woman asks, "When are we

going to become a family?" and Grace
replies, "Don't say you did the best you
could." Whereupon the Old Woman

does exactly that.
"There's a wave of recognition in the

audience. All families are slightly dysfunc
tional. But [this one] opened their hearts to

one another and celebrates life and each other,
and they're no longer oppressed."
