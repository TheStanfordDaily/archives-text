# CAMP CALOBO
## 
### 
Friday night's performance at Palo Altos Cubberley Audito
rium definitely had a campy feel. Picture it: Palo Alto in 1997,
sweltering heat, tiny high-school gym, KM) bouncing teenagers
and power failures to boot. It was a test of I Calobo's flexibility and
humility as they played for a remarkably small crowd in a re
markably small venue and with remarkable enthusiasm.
Calobo started the set oft with a bluesy, knee-slappin' "Down
in My Old House" from its latest album. This set the pace for the
evening and kept the preppies in a toe-tapping frenzy. A few
songs later, the power went out mid-song, but the group rallied
with a sense ol humor and broke into an acoustic version ot
"Mozambique" with beautiful three-part harmonies by Michele
Van Cleef, David Andrews and Caleb Klauder.
When the technical difficulties were ironed out, Calobo bust
ed out with a hat-trick of old favorites, "I low 'Bout You," "Hut
Your Pipe 1 )own Baby" and "Bright Day." This was a good move
to reintroduce the vibe, and the groove was back on accompa
nied by vocals from the core of die-hard fans in the audience.
Unfortunately, the power failed again, but Calobo remained
professional and finished the evening to thunderous applause
and some empathy from the exhausted, sweat-drenched con
cert-goers. This show proved Calobo's genuine dedication to its
music in light of the oppressive heat and technical problems —
chalk this one up to experience, guys.
Saturday night at the Great American Music Hall in San
Francisco was a stark contrast to the low-key show the night be
fore, although the heat was a constant. The dance floor was a vir
tual sauna, filled with a groovin' Stanford-grad-esque crowd,
and Calobo was definitely on fire.
The band played a three-hour set inspired by a rowdy, faith
ful audience that belted lyrics at the stage in encouragement.
Kicking off with an upbeat rendition of "Feel All the Way,"
Calobo awed the crowd with a set-list of almost 30 songs chosen
from all four of their albums, as well as some unheard tunes.
Jenny Conlee shined on the digital keyboards, and Nate
Query grabbed the spotlight for some inspiring bass solos.
Klauder plucked away at his guitar and mandolin without crack
ing a smile but had quite a potent influence on the crowd. Ken
neth Erlick played the electric guitar with verve and a smirk, and
Brian Bucolo kept the tempo real on the drums for the whole
evening. With Van Cleef and Andrews in the forefront, the vo
cals were an especially amazing showcase of talent.
After the crowd brought the band back out for an encore,
Calobo really let loose and showed how comfortable they could
be in front of a larger audience. Armed with a sense of humor
and a gravelly voice, Erlick busted out with funky vocals in a
standard Duke Ellington swing tune, to which Van Cleef added
her most husky contribution. The band was on, and it was at
ease.
This pair of concerts seems to be a metaphor for Calobo's
progress. The musicians started out camping in fields and play
ing in hokey venues like libraries, county fairs and high school
gyms. But they have worked their way up to a more serious level,
and Saturday night proved they can jam with the big boys. And
my prediction is that they can only get bigger.

CHILLIN' WITH CALOBO
Intermission got a chance to talk with Michele Van Cleef (vo
cals), David "Hobo" Andrews (vocals, acoustic guitar) and Nate
Query (bass) of Calobo before their show at the Cubberley Au
ditorium in Palo Alto Friday. They gave us a little insight as to
how they came to be and how they forgot to use sunscreen.
Intermission: Where arc you from? How did you get started?
David Andrews: The band is based in Portland, Ore. That's
where we start tours from. The earliest gigging occurred be
tween Washington and Oregon and slowly developed outside
that region to every state that borders it and then every state that
borders that
Michele Van Cleef: It started out as a college thing for sure. We
played lots in Corvallis (Ore.) and lots in Portland, a little at the

Portland-based
acoustic / electric /
folk-rockers chill out
in the heat

Dublin Pub in Portland, tour Friday nights in one month. It's
not your "place to play," but it was a start for sure.
I: How would you define your style of music?
Dave Andrews: Somewhere between folk rock and jam rock.
It's acoustic and electric so it's really hard to pin down.
MVC: Acoustic / electric folk rock is what I always say be
cause it's true: There are elements of all of that in it even though
a lot of that is contradictory.
I: Are there any social-political motives behind the folk aspect?
MVC: No, not at all for us.
Nate Query: The thing that's sort of folky about it is that it
started with Dave and Caleb playing acoustic guitars and per
forming mostly in the context of their community in front of
friends or in front of family. But we're a serious band. We've
moved into bars, we've moved into parties, and now we try to get
bigger and bigger venues, and it's not like we're going to go play
in the woods with a bunch of friends, but we still do that. It still
has those roots in the simplicity of two guitars and two voices.
/: How did you come up with the name "Calobo"?
DA: I used to be "Hobo." [Calobo is a combination of "Hobo"
and Caleb.] The first time that Caleb and I played in public
like live shows and stuff — we were up in the San Juan Islands in
Washington, and we would travel to a different island and play
for a county fair or a library fair. I guess we were sleeping in fields
instead of hotels at that point. We were the troubadoursof the is
lands. We'd carry our guitars around, and we didn't wear shoes.
We were getting into the scene for the first time. That's where it
all began for us. It's another childhood story of playing music.
I: What are your childhood stories?
NQ: When I was in eighth grade I started playing bass. I was
like, "Wow, I can play Beatles." My first gig was with a drummer
and a guitarist at a wedding anniversary. Some parents felt sorry
for us and let us play. They paid us $90. That was my first pro gig.
MVC!: Pretty much as long as I can remember I was always
singing something, literally as a little kid on the fireplace mantle,
you know, doing little shows for my parents, and then starting in
fifth grade I did musicals in school. From then on I was just in
choir forever and ensembles. The first professional singing I did
was singing at weddings. I did a lot of singingat weddings in high
school.
I: How do you deal with seven people?
MVC': It surprises me how well it does work. We get along
pretty well. I don't think we could still be doing this at all if we
didn't get along the way we get along. We all have to make ad

just mcnts within ourselves. Me especially, I've made huge ad
just men ts.
1 >A: You have to sacrifice a lot to work in a group like that. You
do that in a hand of tour or in a hand of seven, hut then at the
same time with seven people, musically you have to he so sensi
live because there's such a possibility tor everything being slop
py. .. .We get used to leaving space. The nice thing about it is you
can disappear if you want to. 1 here are so many ot us you can be
hanging tint with one person for one tour and anothei person
for another tour. It's like a camp on the road. We're just a big
camp, C lamp ('alobo.
I: What iirc sonic of your influences! 1 Wluit's the best concert
you'w ever been to?

N(): (lharlie I lunter. I'm a huge lan
ot( lluirlie I lunter,ami I was at one concert
that just totally blew my mind, and I was
like, "Oh my god, music can do llus?"
I )A: I'inmylou I larris with the Nash
Ramblers up in l.verett, Wash., was a lan
t.istii show, some ol the finest musicians
I've ever seen in my life. They're all
Nashville country artists that .ire the best.
MVCI was blown away by ( hick
(>orea. It was one ol the first pro jazz things
I've ever experienced and it was really
amazing.
I: // you eouhl have i tiughl one concert
in the Inst 50years what would it have been?
MVCI would've goncto .i (iratetul
Dead show. I never went; I was going to. I
think it would have been a good show.
1 )A: bob Marley would be cool.

NQ: I'm in a huge Coltrane phase, I've gotten all these
bootlegs where he does a 45-minute version of "My Favorite
Things," so that's what I'll do.
I: The press release says you vc found a new "maturity" in your
latest release, "Stomp." What does this mean?
MVC: I think the songwriting is getting a little more intricate.
I )A: Well, in the sense of the album, it's like being comfortable
in the studio, like just going in there and playing music rather
than thinking, "OK, we have five minutes and that equals $10
studio time." It's taken three albums to get to the point where we
can go in there and not be pressured by time or atmosphere. Ma
turity is just growing comfortable with our environment and
our ability to play with each other in that surrounding ol the stu
dioand making a record.
I: I noticed a more melancholy lone m "Stomp." I'm sensing a
breakup behind this album.
I )A: Oh yeah, the most important source of emotional inspi
ration is from something like that. Yeah, that was a break up
from a couple ofyears ago and these songs sort ol carryover, lor
me, when I write a song I don't think about what I'm laying on
the table, you know. I don't know who does. When you're writ
ing a song you just let things come out. I guess in the end some
people can relate to it or use it lor some source of emotion in
themselves.
I: If you could tour with any band who would it be?
I )A: You know who would be .1 fun band to tour with, who we
could have a 70 minute set or an hour with would be leftover
Salmon. They're just now hitting the whole nation.
NQ: String (cheese Incident, that would be a cool band to go
on tour with because they're really different. They're |iist jammin'.
I: So what's the best part about being a member of (.alobo?
MV(I 've been exposed to so much more music ...
NQ: Yeah, and too much sun.
MVC:.. .both live and recorded, than I would have ever been
if I'd not been in this group, and I love that because there are so
many different kinds out there, there are still so many I haven't
heard. 'That just enriches me so much, and not to mention the
fact that I absolutely love performing live It gives me a lot of
inner satisfaction.
NQ: I guess it's just the opportunity to be a professional mu
sician for a while and not have to do anything else. That's prob
ably the biggest thing because when we have time off, I don't
have to work, you know, 1 can just do music. ||
