# Paint the town blues
## 
### 
Tin artistic history of the United States has ranged
from bland Furoccntric mimicry to brilliantly original
sell expression. But with the empirical domination of
modern pop culture in this technological age, it's hard to call
anything a uniquely American art form any more.
The musical experic ie of this country has fallen into a
similar pattern as other arts. It was only with the advent of
jazz that other countries started to notice that an original
sound had begun to issue from the instruments of this coun
try.
But jazz wasn't the first unique American sound, and it
didn't just appear out of nowhere. Jazz, arose from the inter
actions and innovations of 150 years of traditional and folk
musics strewn across the country.
Musics that also led to the blues.
But unlike jazz, the blues have remained a distinctively
American music. Perhaps because the sorrow, sweat, love,
blood and soul of the blues cannot be separated from the his
tory of the American experience, especially that of the
African-American experience in the South.
For the last hundred years, the lifeline of the U.S. blues
scene has run north-south along the Mississippi River, from
the New Orleans delta to the industrial yards of Chicago. But
enclaves of legitimate, home-grown blues have also spring up
across the country in places like Detroit, Memphis, St. Louis

and even Seattle.
So it shouldn't really come as
a surprise to find that the blues
arc alive throughout the Bay
Area, from Oakland to San
Francisco to San lose. Indeed,
the region easily attracts nation
al acts like Clarence "Gate
mouth" Brown and the leg
endary |ohn Lee Hooker, who
has lived in the Bay Area for sev
eral years and made a swing
through the region last month
to play the opening of the new
Voshi's jazz club in Oakland as

well as clubs like the Fdge in
Palo Alto. Ami even Stanford has been able to book acts like
buddy Guy, often viewed as next in line lor the throne of the
blues.
But in a town that is known nationally for its receptive au
diences, the blues have struggled to generate as strong a San
Francisco presence as other genres like rock, jazz and punk.
This has something to do with the wax and wane of historical
eras, since the blues have waned of late and are making a slow
comeback.
When the Pacific Fleet was bombed at Pearl Harbor, con
struction began on a new fleet in Seattle, Oakland and Los

Angeles. Henry Kaiser, a steel
magnate responsible lor supplying
materials and workers, brought
lots of labor to the West Coast from

Fast Texas. For the first time in the history ol the Bay Area, a
well-off black middle class developed that could support
blues musicians. With Oakland and Richmond as the focal
points, clubs sprang up throughout the Bay Area and attract
ed acts like Lowell Fulson and Lafayette Thomas.
"|Thomas| was a bad motherfucker," said the Byrd ot Par
adise, a longtime KZSU blues DJ. "He used to give 8.8. King
lessons. King would hang out just to hear him play."
But the blues scene slowly began to disintegrate as folks
like Steve Miller and 80/. Scaggs, who had moved to the Bay
from Chicago in the 19605, began to depart in the '70s. The
fantastic reserve of talent was soon plundered.
Rebuilding Bay Area blues: The foundation
That is where The Blues and R&B Foundation Inc. comes
in. Devoted to the promotion of local talent and the acquisi
tion of instruments for students, the Foundation is holding
its Third Annual California Blues Festival on Memorial Day
at the hand shell area in Golden Gate Park. The show is free to
the public.
The foundation was started by saxophonist Bobbie "Spi
der" Webb, a professional blues and R&B musician for in the
Bay Area for more than 30 years. Webb has played with T-
Bone Walker, Ftta lames, Lou Fulsom and was a member of
the R&B Revue at the Monterey Pop Festival for eight years.
Operating under what Webb calls "a license to beg" char-

ter (as a public-benefit
charity organization),
the foundation has had
considerably more suc
cess at promoting local
blues acts than at the
charity's other major
objective: raising
money to provide in
struments for children.
Webb is hoping that
this year's festival
"might open up the
doors for us to get

some of our other stuff
done. We're being sponsored by Budweiser and the Musicians
Union local 6 |of the American Federation of Musicians],
plus I've invited people from General Motors and other folks
too."
The main problem facing the foundation is that its re
sources are taxed to the limit. Webb serves as both Founda
tion president and chairman of the board, and although the
Foundation claims to have staff who are administrative, fi
nancial and support, Webb is also the main publicist and
media contact.
Nevertheless, the Foundation has done a tremendous job

generating support for the Festival, including the enlistment
of radio stations KDIA (1310 AM) and KPOO (89.5 FM) as
media sponsors. Promoted as a family affair, the Third An
nual California Blues Festival promises to showcase some of
the best local talent.
Plugging into the Festival
When the festival was started in 1995, Webb had nothing
but a permit for the park. But when showtime came around, 10

different acts showed up, and three didn't even get on the stage
because of time constraints and an enthusiastic audience.
Webb estimates that a few thousand people showed up for tli.it
concert, a number he raised to 4,000 for last year's festival.
One of the signposts that the festival could become a
mainstay of the Bay Area blues scene is the sponsorship of the
musicians' union. Because of their aid at last year's festival,
Webb was able to pay union scale to 20 musicians. So as a
thank you to the musicians who had played for free the year
before, he invited them all back, including acts like Stew
Blank and Tommy Castro. Budweiser also picked up the Fes
tival that year, which helped pay for the park fees.
Webb estimates that the band shell area will be "filled to
the brim" at this year's festival, with 5,000 to 6,000 people in
attendance.
The players
Here's a quick rundown of this year's lineup, which lea

tures a dozen different local acts that range from funk to
gospel to R&B:
• Bobbie Webb and The Smooth Blues Band (Myron
Williams, Carl "Good Rocking" Robinson and Fd Serrano),
joined by Mrs. Taylor R Collins from the South Bay on vocals.
The Smooth Blues Band has been together for more than 15
years.
• Mamou (guitar and vocals), formerly known as Dia

mond lim. Mamou has been a main
stay in the Bay Area blues and R&B
scene lor more than 25 years.
• The D.K.I I. Band, consisting ol
two brothers (ages 12 and l3)ongui
tar and drums, and their sister (age
11) on bass. Webb's enthusiasm for
the band is abundant: "The blues is
alive, and these youngsters will keep
the blues alive."
• Nat Bolden, an Oakland native,
on guitar and vocals, joined by Bird
I eggs on harmonica.
• Panther Slim and his new trio,
playing traditional country blues.
• Carolyn Powell, who will open
the show with a solo gospel song.
• Robert Lerov (ones on guitar.
• The Soul Seekers Band.
• Domingo (brother ol Sugar Pie
DeSanto, a legendary blues diva),
with Lorraine Bell and Carlos Zialci
ta from the l ast Bay on harmonica.
• Ron L. fee, a Pitchburg, Calif.,
native, on vocals and harmonica.
• Clarence "Cuitar" Sims, also
known as "Fillmore Slim," who just
released a new album, "Born To Sing
The Blues."
• Proud Mary 11 i 11, a late addition,
on vocals.
• D) Bob (iraham providing music
during the show's intermissions.
The ground crew

i ne master oi ceremonies ioi tne
Festival is Frankie M. from KDIA, an Oakland radio station
that has been playing the blues since the !9(So's. In addition to
KDIA and San Francisco's KPOO, several other Bay Area
radio stations play blues on a regular basis. In San Francisco
this includes KPAI (94.1 FM), the oldest listener supported
station in the country (since l l M7); KAI.W (91.7 I'M); and
KUSF (90.3 FM). There's also KKUP (91.5 FM) in ( upert ino,
KSCU (103.3 FM) in San lose, KCSM (91.1 FM) in

San Mateo and Stanford's own KZSU (90.1 I M).
Between these nine sta
tions there are about 35

hours of blues on Bay Area radio each week, mak
ing it one of the richest blues markets in the
country. About two-thirds of that airtime is
what KXSU's byrd of Paradise calls the new
blues, a "blues-rock, soul music and ja/v blues

I a.m.) over the weekend .ill year tor ten years, and the two
year-old club Biscuits and Blues has had success booking na

Intermission talked to the Byrd of Paradise,
blues DJ on KZSU who has worked in radio l<
more than 15 years. His show. "Blues With
Feeling" is on every Saturday from 9 a.m. to noot
This week he will have Carl "Good Rocking
Robinson, one of the performers at the Third An
nual California Blues Festival, as a guest in the stu
dio.
Intermission: So Carl "Good Rocking" Robin
son will be in studio with you this weekend.
Byrd: Yeah! He's one of the last of his gener.i
tion. He played with all the heavyweights hack i
the day.
I: What type of blues do you play on your show
B: I'm trying to keep the traditional blues aliv
for the older folks out there and also to let the nei
blues fans know what the history of the blues i
about. I'm trying to go backwards — I'm not call
ing other people wrong, but since the lines (
modern blues have gotten all blurred, 1 think it
important to keep it straight. And I'm not talkin
about country blues out on the porch, because Fi
a TV baby and my life is centered around electric
ity. Some of the new players are doing it right an
I try to feature them on my show, too.
But people like to call my type "blues nazis," Ix
cause we're into the traditional, old style. Basical
ly, Fm like, fuck them. Big record companies ha\
realized that there's money to be made in the no'
type of blues artist. Robert Cray — who's a grc.
musician, don't get me wrong — was one ol th
first to get signed and also one of the first to cro>
over to mass media
I: So he added a pop element?
B: Sure. Cray is 'Animal House," too. His Ris
was what Belushi was ail into. Cray was play in
stone traditional blues when he started but th.
changed a lot.

I: Where's the best current blues scene?
B: Mississippi. The issue before last of "Living
Blues" was a feature devoted to the blues being
played in that state. There was a guide to clubs and
even a fold-out map of the state included.
I: What's going on with the Bay Area blues scene
now?
B: The blues have sort of hit a fork in the road.
There's a small minority of new players who have
really done their homework and understand the
history and tradition behind what they're playing.
On the other hand, the vast majority of the scene
has merged with jazz and rock. Even soul music is
considered part of the blues now. The new blues is
a blues-rock, soul music and jazz-blues fusion.
1: Why this movement away from more tradi
tional sounds?
B: It's a result of the Belushi / Aykroyd movie
"The Blues Brothers." All through the 19705, old
blues were taught and played around here, but
when that movie came out in 1979 the blues began
a metamorphosis. That little skit of theirs helped
out some of the old black bluesmen — the
metaphor there is "when the tide comes in, all the
boats rise together'' — but it also gave the blues
mass appeal. The thing is, that wasn't really the
blues. All the musicians in that band were legiti
mate players, but what they were playing was
rhythm and blues (R&B). It spawned a whole new
type of blues player and fan who have, collectively,
slowly, begun to forget where the blues come
from.
I: Where do the blues come from?
B: Real blues was born in dark bars, little dark
shithole bars. That's why even a national act (like
Stevie Ray Vaughn) could tour around and play for
millions, and when they get home they want to play
the little joints. That's where they sound the best.

played in that state. There was a guide to clubs and
even a fold-out map of the state included.
I: What's going on with the Bay Area blues scene
now?
B: The blues have sort of hit a fork in the road.
There's a small minority of new players who have
really done their homework and understand the
history and tradition behind what they're playing.
On the other hand, the vast majority of the scene
has merged with jazz and rock. Even soul music is
considered part of the blues now. The new blues is
a blues-rock, soul music and jazz-blues fusion.
1: Why this movement away from more tradi
tional sounds?
B: It's a result of the Belushi / Aykroyd movie
"The Blues Brothers." All through the 19705, old
blues were taught and played around here, but
when that movie came out in 1979 the blues began
a metamorphosis. That little skit of theirs helped
out some of the old black bluesmen — the
metaphor there is "when the tide comes in, all the
boats rise together'' — but it also gave the blues
mass appeal. The thing is, that wasn't really the
blues. All the musicians in that band were legiti
mate players, but what they were playing was
rhythm and blues (R&B). It spawned a whole new
type of blues player and fan who have, collectively,
slowly, begun to forget where the blues come
from.
I: Where do the blues come from?
B: Real blues was born in dark bars, little dark
shithole bars. That's why even a national act (like
Stevie Ray Vaughn) could tour around and play for
millions, and when they get home they want to play
the little joints. That's where they sound the best.

Bobbie "Spider" Webb dreamed up and organized the growing Calif. Blues Festival
Tin artistic history of the United States has ranged
from bland Furoccntric mimicry to brilliantly original
sell expression. But with the empirical domination of
modern pop culture in this technological age, it's hard to call
anything a uniquely American art form any more.
The musical experic ie of this country has fallen into a
similar pattern as other arts. It was only with the advent of
jazz that other countries started to notice that an original
sound had begun to issue from the instruments of this coun
try.
But jazz wasn't the first unique American sound, and it
didn't just appear out of nowhere. Jazz, arose from the inter
actions and innovations of 150 years of traditional and folk
musics strewn across the country.
Musics that also led to the blues.
But unlike jazz, the blues have remained a distinctively
American music. Perhaps because the sorrow, sweat, love,
blood and soul of the blues cannot be separated from the his
tory of the American experience, especially that of the
African-American experience in the South.
For the last hundred years, the lifeline of the U.S. blues
scene has run north-south along the Mississippi River, from
the New Orleans delta to the industrial yards of Chicago. But
enclaves of legitimate, home-grown blues have also spring up
across the country in places like Detroit, Memphis, St. Louis

and even Seattle.
So it shouldn't really come as
a surprise to find that the blues
arc alive throughout the Bay
Area, from Oakland to San
Francisco to San lose. Indeed,
the region easily attracts nation
al acts like Clarence "Gate
mouth" Brown and the leg
endary |ohn Lee Hooker, who
has lived in the Bay Area for sev
eral years and made a swing
through the region last month
to play the opening of the new
Voshi's jazz club in Oakland as

well as clubs like the Fdge in
Palo Alto. Ami even Stanford has been able to book acts like
buddy Guy, often viewed as next in line lor the throne of the
blues.
But in a town that is known nationally for its receptive au
diences, the blues have struggled to generate as strong a San
Francisco presence as other genres like rock, jazz and punk.
This has something to do with the wax and wane of historical
eras, since the blues have waned of late and are making a slow
comeback.

struction began on a new fleet in Seattle, Oakland and Los

Angeles. Henry Kaiser, a steel
magnate responsible lor supplying
materials and workers, brought
lots of labor to the West Coast from

Fast Texas. For the first time in the history ol the Bay Area, a
well-off black middle class developed that could support
blues musicians. With Oakland and Richmond as the focal
points, clubs sprang up throughout the Bay Area and attract
ed acts like Lowell Fulson and Lafayette Thomas.
"|Thomas| was a bad motherfucker," said the Byrd ot Par
adise, a longtime KZSU blues DJ. "He used to give 8.8. King
lessons. King would hang out just to hear him play."
But the blues scene slowly began to disintegrate as folks
like Steve Miller and 80/. Scaggs, who had moved to the Bay
from Chicago in the 19605, began to depart in the '70s. The
fantastic reserve of talent was soon plundered.
Rebuilding Bay Area blues: The foundation
That is where The Blues and R&B Foundation Inc. comes
in. Devoted to the promotion of local talent and the acquisi
tion of instruments for students, the Foundation is holding
its Third Annual California Blues Festival on Memorial Day
at the hand shell area in Golden Gate Park. The show is free to
the public.
The foundation was started by saxophonist Bobbie "Spi
der" Webb, a professional blues and R&B musician for in the
Bay Area for more than 30 years. Webb has played with T-
Bone Walker, Ftta lames, Lou Fulsom and was a member of
the R&B Revue at the Monterey Pop Festival for eight years.
Operating under what Webb calls "a license to beg" char-

ter (as a public-benefit
charity organization),
the foundation has had
considerably more suc
cess at promoting local
blues acts than at the
charity's other major
objective: raising
money to provide in
struments for children.
Webb is hoping that
this year's festival
"might open up the
doors for us to get

some of our other stuff
done. We're being sponsored by Budweiser and the Musicians
Union local 6 |of the American Federation of Musicians],
plus I've invited people from General Motors and other folks
too."
The main problem facing the foundation is that its re
sources are taxed to the limit. Webb serves as both Founda
tion president and chairman of the board, and although the
Foundation claims to have staff who are administrative, fi
nancial and support, Webb is also the main publicist and
media contact.
Nevertheless, the Foundation has done a tremendous job

generating support for the Festival, including the enlistment
of radio stations KDIA (1310 AM) and KPOO (89.5 FM) as
media sponsors. Promoted as a family affair, the Third An
nual California Blues Festival promises to showcase some of
the best local talent.
Plugging into the Festival
When the festival was started in 1995, Webb had nothing
but a permit for the park. But when showtime came around, 10

different acts showed up, and three didn't even get on the stage
because of time constraints and an enthusiastic audience.
Webb estimates that a few thousand people showed up for tli.it
concert, a number he raised to 4,000 for last year's festival.
One of the signposts that the festival could become a
mainstay of the Bay Area blues scene is the sponsorship of the
musicians' union. Because of their aid at last year's festival,
Webb was able to pay union scale to 20 musicians. So as a
thank you to the musicians who had played for free the year
before, he invited them all back, including acts like Stew
Blank and Tommy Castro. Budweiser also picked up the Fes
tival that year, which helped pay for the park fees.
Webb estimates that the band shell area will be "filled to
the brim" at this year's festival, with 5,000 to 6,000 people in
attendance.
The players
Here's a quick rundown of this year's lineup, which lea

tures a dozen different local acts that range from funk to
gospel to R&B:
• Bobbie Webb and The Smooth Blues Band (Myron
Williams, Carl "Good Rocking" Robinson and Fd Serrano),
joined by Mrs. Taylor R Collins from the South Bay on vocals.
The Smooth Blues Band has been together for more than 15
years.
• Mamou (guitar and vocals), formerly known as Dia

mond lim. Mamou has been a main
stay in the Bay Area blues and R&B
scene lor more than 25 years.
• The D.K.I I. Band, consisting ol
two brothers (ages 12 and l3)ongui
tar and drums, and their sister (age
11) on bass. Webb's enthusiasm for
the band is abundant: "The blues is
alive, and these youngsters will keep
the blues alive."
• Nat Bolden, an Oakland native,
on guitar and vocals, joined by Bird
I eggs on harmonica.
• Panther Slim and his new trio,
playing traditional country blues.
• Carolyn Powell, who will open
the show with a solo gospel song.
• Robert Lerov (ones on guitar.
• The Soul Seekers Band.
• Domingo (brother ol Sugar Pie
DeSanto, a legendary blues diva),
with Lorraine Bell and Carlos Zialci
ta from the l ast Bay on harmonica.
• Ron L. fee, a Pitchburg, Calif.,
native, on vocals and harmonica.
• Clarence "Cuitar" Sims, also
known as "Fillmore Slim," who just
released a new album, "Born To Sing
The Blues."
• Proud Mary 11 i 11, a late addition,
on vocals.
• D) Bob (iraham providing music
during the show's intermissions.
The ground crew

Festival is Frankie M. from KDIA, an Oakland radio station
that has been playing the blues since the !9(So's. In addition to
KDIA and San Francisco's KPOO, several other Bay Area
radio stations play blues on a regular basis. In San Francisco
this includes KPAI (94.1 FM), the oldest listener supported
station in the country (since l l M7); KAI.W (91.7 I'M); and
KUSF (90.3 FM). There's also KKUP (91.5 FM) in ( upert ino,
KSCU (103.3 FM) in San lose, KCSM (91.1 FM) in

San Mateo and Stanford's own KZSU (90.1 I M).
Between these nine sta
tions there are about 35

hours of blues on Bay Area radio each week, mak
ing it one of the richest blues markets in the
country. About two-thirds of that airtime is

Intermission talked to the Byrd of Paradise,
blues DJ on KZSU who has worked in radio l<
more than 15 years. His show. "Blues With
Feeling" is on every Saturday from 9 a.m. to noot
This week he will have Carl "Good Rocking
Robinson, one of the performers at the Third An
nual California Blues Festival, as a guest in the stu
dio.
Intermission: So Carl "Good Rocking" Robin
son will be in studio with you this weekend.
Byrd: Yeah! He's one of the last of his gener.i
tion. He played with all the heavyweights hack i
the day.
I: What type of blues do you play on your show
B: I'm trying to keep the traditional blues aliv
for the older folks out there and also to let the nei
blues fans know what the history of the blues i
about. I'm trying to go backwards — I'm not call
ing other people wrong, but since the lines (
modern blues have gotten all blurred, 1 think it
important to keep it straight. And I'm not talkin
about country blues out on the porch, because Fi
a TV baby and my life is centered around electric
ity. Some of the new players are doing it right an
I try to feature them on my show, too.
But people like to call my type "blues nazis," Ix
cause we're into the traditional, old style. Basical
ly, Fm like, fuck them. Big record companies ha\
realized that there's money to be made in the no'
type of blues artist. Robert Cray — who's a grc.
musician, don't get me wrong — was one ol th
first to get signed and also one of the first to cro>
over to mass media
I: So he added a pop element?
B: Sure. Cray is 'Animal House," too. His Ris
was what Belushi was ail into. Cray was play in
stone traditional blues when he started but th.
changed a lot.

I: Where's the best current blues scene?
B: Mississippi. The issue before last of "Living
Blues" was a feature devoted to the blues being
played in that state. There was a guide to clubs and
even a fold-out map of the state included.
I: What's going on with the Bay Area blues scene
now?
B: The blues have sort of hit a fork in the road.
There's a small minority of new players who have
really done their homework and understand the
history and tradition behind what they're playing.
On the other hand, the vast majority of the scene
has merged with jazz and rock. Even soul music is
considered part of the blues now. The new blues is
a blues-rock, soul music and jazz-blues fusion.
1: Why this movement away from more tradi
tional sounds?

blues were taught and played around here, but

a metamorphosis. That little skit of theirs helped

Intermission talked to the Byrd of Paradise,
blues DJ on KZSU who has worked in radio l<
more than 15 years. His show. "Blues With
Feeling" is on every Saturday from 9 a.m. to noot
This week he will have Carl "Good Rocking
Robinson, one of the performers at the Third An
nual California Blues Festival, as a guest in the stu
dio.
Intermission: So Carl "Good Rocking" Robin
son will be in studio with you this weekend.
Byrd: Yeah! He's one of the last of his gener.i
tion. He played with all the heavyweights hack i
the day.
I: What type of blues do you play on your show
B: I'm trying to keep the traditional blues aliv
for the older folks out there and also to let the nei
blues fans know what the history of the blues i
about. I'm trying to go backwards — I'm not call
ing other people wrong, but since the lines (
modern blues have gotten all blurred, 1 think it
important to keep it straight. And I'm not talkin
about country blues out on the porch, because Fi
a TV baby and my life is centered around electric
ity. Some of the new players are doing it right an
I try to feature them on my show, too.
But people like to call my type "blues nazis," Ix
cause we're into the traditional, old style. Basical
ly, Fm like, fuck them. Big record companies ha\
realized that there's money to be made in the no'
type of blues artist. Robert Cray — who's a grc.
musician, don't get me wrong — was one ol th
first to get signed and also one of the first to cro>
over to mass media
I: So he added a pop element?
B: Sure. Cray is 'Animal House," too. His Ris
was what Belushi was ail into. Cray was play in
stone traditional blues when he started but th.
changed a lot.

I: Where's the best current blues scene?
B: Mississippi. The issue before last of "Living
Blues" was a feature devoted to the blues being
played in that state. There was a guide to clubs and
even a fold-out map of the state included.
I: What's going on with the Bay Area blues scene
now?
B: The blues have sort of hit a fork in the road.
There's a small minority of new players who have
really done their homework and understand the
history and tradition behind what they're playing.
On the other hand, the vast majority of the scene
has merged with jazz and rock. Even soul music is
considered part of the blues now. The new blues is
a blues-rock, soul music and jazz-blues fusion.
1: Why this movement away from more tradi
tional sounds?
B: It's a result of the Belushi / Aykroyd movie
"The Blues Brothers." All through the 19705, old
blues were taught and played around here, but
when that movie came out in 1979 the blues began
a metamorphosis. That little skit of theirs helped
out some of the old black bluesmen — the
metaphor there is "when the tide comes in, all the
boats rise together'' — but it also gave the blues
mass appeal. The thing is, that wasn't really the
blues. All the musicians in that band were legiti
mate players, but what they were playing was
rhythm and blues (R&B). It spawned a whole new
type of blues player and fan who have, collectively,
slowly, begun to forget where the blues come
from.
I: Where do the blues come from?
B: Real blues was born in dark bars, little dark
shithole bars. That's why even a national act (like
Stevie Ray Vaughn) could tour around and play for
millions, and when they get home they want to play
the little joints. That's where they sound the best.
