## The
						Misfits "American Psycho" 
### 
Ah, go scare your own parents.
The original Misfits never reached a very
wide audience, hut it's easy to see why they
made such an impact on punk rock. With
their leather jackets, white pancake makeup
and "devil lock' hairdos, the Misfits looked
like undcad hikers from some 1950s horror
movie, an impression only strengthened by
their music: driving punk anthems to aliens,
murderers and other H movie fixtures deliv
ered hy (ilenn I )an/ig, .1 singer who sounded
like .in undcad Klvis.

The band broke up in the '80s, Danzig
moved on to cheesy death metal and the
other members faded into obscurity. Their
lucrative legacy continued to grow, however,
and after a lengthy legal battle with Danzig
for the rights to the name, the original gui
tarist and bassist have recruited a new singer
and drummer and brought the Misfits back
from the dead and into a major-label con
tract. "American Psycho" is the first new
album from this lineup, and things aren't

quite the same.
A large part of the problem is new singer
Michale Graves: I le clearly doesn't want to be
written off as a Danzig sound-alike, and ex
periments widely in search of his own voice.
Unfortunately, he's no good at hiding his in
fluences — on "Dig Up Her Bones" lie
sounds like Type C) Negative and on "Black
light" he's a dead ringer for Alice in Chains.
On the inadvertently self-pa iodic "Day ol the
Dead" he even one-ups Danzig's Elvis fetish,
sounding so much the King it's scary.
The rest of the band meanders, too, occa
sionally teetering on the edge of the same
cheese-metal precipice that swallowed its
former lead singer. Kxperimentation is usu
ally OK, but here it's regrettable — tracks like
"From Hell They Came" that stick to the
original Misfits formula are more successful
than the rest of the album.
Another big problem: The new Misfits are
taking themselves way too seriously. The orig
inal band had the same lyrical obsession with
ghouls, monsters and Martians, but Misfits
classics like "I Want Your Skull" were silly as
well as shocking, delivering ghoulish lines like
"rip the heads off little girls and hang them on
my wall" with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
On "American Psycho," the Misfits seem to
have lost that sense of humor. Without it, they
become just another band to scare your par
ents with, albeit one with better fashion sense.
