## "Lemon Parade" 
### 
Witli .1 hard driven sincerity that seems
reserved only for works hy (instav Mahler
and Modest Mussourgsky, Tonic's "Lemon
Parade" is rocky mixture of musical passions.
Hashing between ballad and teen .ingst is not
easy, and this group pulls it off astonishingly
well.
Although they masquerade as a simple
group ol Jersey kids, don't let the image lead
you to believe that this is just another pack
aged garage band. Possessed with a knack for
creating memorable licks, this alternative
cum adult contemporary group specializes
in .1 delicate and emotionally manipulating
songcraft. In the end, "lemon Parade is a
superb opus one tli.it seems built on pas
sion rather than overcooked formulas.
Perhaps the most explosive single on
"Lemon Parade" is "Open Up Your Lyes," a
song about sell reflection and awareness.
Lead vocalist l iuerson Hart, in his seductive
style, varies from c|uiet lyric al passages to im
passioned choral exhortations. Hart's voice
carries much of the emotion in lonic s mate
rial, and allows the group to jam with
tremendous musical flexibility.
A great plus about "Lemon Parade" is that
its catchiness does not come from the under

bowels of pop cheesiness. "If You Clonic! Only
See" is very convincing and soon makes you
(all m love with I fart's lover. The song recre
ates Hart's woefully distressing attempts to
convince his parents that his fiancee is more
than an infatuation. In the end, it is hard to
believe that Mr. and Mrs. Hart could with
hold their blessings — especially because
they don't have to foot the wedding bill
thanks to lonic's modest chart success to
date.
Instrumentally, Tonic checks in with a
solid yet not very distinctive sound. T he real
beet on "lemon Parade" lies in gripping
arrangements and convincing lyrics. "Casual
Affair" seems to grip the best: "It's a casual af
fair when everybody loves you /Oh they'll
pay top dollar, make you wear the dog collar /
When everybody loves you." Similar mo
ments can be found on "Soldier's I >aughter,"
.1 song that tangentially probes Freudian
themes: "It's the way he looks at you / that
says to me this isn't over.
lonic benefited from the input of lack
loscpli I'uig, whose production credits in
clude the black Crowes and lellyfish. Pulling
together such a bustling pot of musical ener
gy couldn't have been easy, and Puie chan

neled Tonic with admirable sophistication.
In the end, Tonic has a very powerful and
natural feel — one that makes "Lemon Pa
rade" a great album.
