"Phone
Jackin"

If you thought that getting a call from
Stanford's infamous "Oscar" in the mid
dle of the night is unsettling, think again.
It may be even more frightening (or em
barrassing) to receive a call from the
Laugh Syndicate, a Los Angeles-based
comedy group that has just released
"Phone Jackin'. " This disc contains a col
lection of 15 of their funniest, rudest,
most in-your-face crank calls. The
album's humor is fairly enjoyable, but
after listening to it a few times, you'll
probably never want to again.
By far the best crank call on this album
is "Thai Restaurant," in which a Syndicate
member impersonating an Asian cus
tomer attempts to order non-existent hip
hop dishes like "Wu I'ang Clan," "Snoop
Dog Dog" and "Tupac Shakur." This
track's humor comes mainly from the fact
that the unsuspecting restaurant clerk
desperately attempts to communicate
with his customer. Because the clerk's
English is just as broken as that of the cus
tomer, a hilarious confusion results.
Another excellent track is called "Fu
neral Job," in which another Syndicate
member takes on the role of a necrophili
ac trying to get a job at a funeral parlor.
The girl taking his call responds surpris
ingly well to the fact that he keeps on
stressing the fact that he is extremely com
fortable with dead people, whether he be
"on top or on the bottom." At one point
the receptionist even starts relating to the
necrophiliac by telling him that she, too,
sometimes prefers to be in the presence of
the dead. After listening to this track I got
the feeling that, for safety's sake, everyone
should insist on immediate cremation
after death.
The "Make-Up Removal" call is differ
ent from most of the others. Instead of
being funny because of the interaction
with another person, the Syndicate mem
ber's concept is well-developed and com
ical. This time, the voice actor poses as a
certain King of Pop seeking treatment to
reverse years of plastic surgery. Bit by bit,
we come to realize that Michael Jackson is
being impersonated. By the end of this
call, the Syndicate member has managed
to poke fun at all of Michael's well-known
trademarks and most of his best-known
songs. Answering one of the unsuspecting
employee's questions, he even says that re
garding his race, he is no longer certain if
he is "Black or White."
Unfortunately, not all tracks on the
album are funny; some are just plain vul
gar. In the end, however, most scenarios
on "Phone Jackin'" are inventive and
comical. In the meantime beware, be
cause you might very well be the next tar
get of a phone jackin'.
