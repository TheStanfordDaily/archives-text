# Changes come to Cowell, insurance
## Student health center says it's working to improve services 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
Cowell Student Health Center has a repu
tation among many students that is, at best,
suspect. However, some feel that the reputa
tion is undeserved.
"We had the same problem [with reputa
tion] at Michigan State University," said
Carolyn Fox, a registered nurse at Cowell
who was previously the director of the Michi
gan State University health center for 10
years. "Student health centers are like dorm
food."
Yet, like with dorm food, students do not
stay away, despite their complaints.

"Whether or not students have been
there, there are always jokes," said former
ASSU President Bill Shen, a junior. "The
reputation of Cowell is one that is unsub
stantiated and perpetuates itself."
Although Cowell's reputation may be an
exaggerated one, a sufficient number of stu
dents can recall bad incidents at Cowell.
Meanwhile, Cowell officials say they are look
ing ahead and making changes to improve
service
Cowell's reputation
Santos Marroquin, a sophomore, is one
student with a complaint about Cowell's
service.

1 le went, to Cowell last year for a rugby in
jury to his knee. The injury prevented him
from fully supporting himself while walking.
A doctor at Cowell did a feel test, told Marro
quin that his knee was going to be fine and
sent him home with crutches.
"I couldn't support it; I couldn't bend it,"
he said. "I thought it was a torn ligament."
I le returned to Cowell, and the same doc
tor asked him if he could walk. Marroquin
said he limped a few steps, and the doctor al
legedly said sarcastically, "It's a miracle. The
cripple can walk." The doctor then filled out
his papers and discharged him.
The following day, a friend referred Mar-
roquin to one of the physical train
ers in the physical therapy depart
ment of Cowell. The trainer did
the same feel test as the doctor
and immediately diagnosed Mar
roquin with torn ligaments. The
trainer referred Marroquin to a
doctor in Palo Alto for treatment.
Freshman Supina Mapon also
had a problem at Cowell last quar
ter. She went to Cowell for a rash,
which the doctor diagnosed as fol
liculitis related to bacterial pneu
monia. Although she was given
antibiotics, her rash worsened
over the next few days. She devel
oped a fever, chills came and she
coughed up blood.
Mapon went the emergency
room at the Stanford Hospital.

The doctor there told her that she
did not have folliculitis and to stop
taking the antibiotics, as they
were making her worse. Instead of
folliculitis, she had bronchial
pneumonia, also known as walk
ing pneumonia.
Mapon has since decided to be
more cautious of doctors not only
at Cowell but everywhere.
"I'm not completely distrust ful
of Cowell, but [the incident]
taught me not to be so trusting of
doctors in general," Mapon said.
Cowell's director, Ira Fried
man, declined to speak on these
specific cases. However, he did say
that he has heard from many stu
dents about their likes and dis
likes of Cowell in his two years as
resident fellow in Cedro.
Friedman said he and his staff
are concerned if a student is not
happy with the care he or she has
received. He said Cowell serves

students better when the students
inform Friedman or the quality
improvements manager about
such incidents.
"I try to separate rumors from
actual events," Friedman said.
"I look into each one in detail
and respond personally to the stu
dent involved," he added. "I wel
come students to call and tell me
or drop me a note about any prob
lems they have encountered."
Cowell's changes
Some of the comments and
complaints that Friedman has
heard from students affected
some of the changes occurring at
Cowell.
As the examples show, some of
the most frequent student com
plaints involve the treatment
from the clinicians. Usually, com
plaints and feedback about clini
cians first come to Friedman. The

accuracy of the facts of all com
plaints are double checked.
"In the practice of medicine,
even the best practices cannot
guarantee a particular outcome or
complete satisfaction," Friedman
said.
Friedman also privately and in
dividually discusses the situation
with the staff member involved.
"Our clinicians are very inter
ested in improving our care and
how it is delivered, so student
feedback is appreciated by them,
taken seriously and given
thoughtful consideration," Fried
man said. "Sometimes a clini
cian's practice has changed in re
sponse to student feedback."
Friedman then shares the out
come of the feedback with the stu
dent involved.
Cowell is also making a number
of additions and changes to its cur
rent services. According to Fried

man, not many students know
what it already has to offer.
The center offers four major
areas of service: medical services,
health promotion services, coun
seling and psychological services
and health insurance.
Cowell's medical services in
clude medical appointments, ur
gent daytime care and after-hours
care. Cowell physicians can also
authorize consultations with spe
cialists at the Stanford Medical
Center. During closed hours, stu
dents can receive aid through a 24-
hour crisis hot line and a medical
advice line.
"A lot of students don't know
about our availability," Friedman
said.
The urgent care hours extend
until 9 p.m. weekdays, and ap
pointments for medical and
women's health care are available
until 8 p.m. Monday through

Thursday and from 10:30 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekends.
"Some of the facilities that
make Cowell unique are the lab
and X-ray facilities and specialty
referral that is paid for through
Cowell," Fox said.
Cowell has had its own phar
macy since 1990, and a physical
therapy department is located in
the basement — which Cowell is
also improving.
"We've put in new pieces of
equipment — a treadmill, ultra
sound and an electric stimidation
machine," said Chris Spaulding, a
physical therapist there.
Cowell also runs a travel clinic
that gives advice, information and
vaccines to students going over
seas. This clinic is also open to the
community.
Some of the health center's
most notable changes have been to
the building. The interior has
been painted, lighting has been
changed and air conditioning and
signs have been added. The win
dows on the first floor have also
been tinted for privacy.
"These changes have enhanced
the building's environment to im
prove comfort and privacy for stu
dents," Friedman said.
Friedman, however, said that
the primary complaint he hears
among students is that the wait
for urgent care is too long. The ex
tension of urgent care hours is a
change that resulted from student
complaints.
Another common complaint
that Cowell has made an effort to
improve is telephone service. Now,
an appointment clerk has been
added along with a new answering
service for after-hours coverage.
Also, appointments for medical and
women's health care are open later
Monday through Thursday.
"These changes and others
come from Cowell's commitment
to quality and caring," Friedman
said.
Comment and suggestion
boxes are available for students to
use in Cowell and surveys are
taken. There are also two student
advisory boards — one graduate
and one undergraduate.
With the feedback, services will
continue to improve, Friedman
promises.
" It is important to recognize that
students treated at Cowell are pre
dominantly happy with their treat
ment," Friedman said. "I'd like to
get the word out there are lots of
great services available here."
