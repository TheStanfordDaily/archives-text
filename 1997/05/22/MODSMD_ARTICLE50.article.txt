# Robben Ford
## "Discovering the Blues" 
### 
Robben Ford is one of the most under-recognized
bluesinen in America today. I lis newest album, "I )is
covering The Blues," is a fantastic collection of unre
leased performances recorded in clubs in I lollywood
and Huntington Beach, Calif., in 1972.
Technically precise and extremely light, every
track on the album hits a strong groove. That's what
makes Ford's tunes so attractive — the tough, gritty
style of blues he plays. The rocket licks he drops art
packed with emotion that drives toward climax and
(.lips into the wordless beauty of psychic expression
that truly soulful music embodies. And the solid
grooves provided by his backup of Jim Baum
(drums), Stan Poplin (bass) and Paul Nagle (key
boards) — the same setup as successful early-1970s
blues-rockers Derek and the Dominoes — are artisti
cally superb.
A product of the Bay Area, Ford studied saxophone
until his early teens, when he switched to guitar. Sev
eral years of self-teaching and imitation of masters like
8.8. King, Albert King and Mike Bloomfield honed
him into a proficient blues and jazz guitarist.
At IS, he formed The Charles Ford Band (named
after his father) in San Francisco. In the 1980s, he
found the fusion group The Yellow jackets; later in the
decade, he toured with Miles I )avis and Sadao Watan
abe. Ford has also recorded several solo albums as well
as an album with the venerable Jimmy Witherspoon.
"Discovering The Blues" leads off with a cover of

» U
8.8. King's classic, "Sweet Sixteen,' on which lord's
guitar screams over the slow, gutsy line played by the
rhythm section. I lis only original on the album, "You
Drive a Hard Bargain," is next, in which a smooth
Crescent C ity groove slinks along while lord rips
apart a basic riff. Later in the track, Nagle matches
Ford's fierce jam on the organ, funking through an
extended solo.
I he John I.ee 1 looker tune "It's My Own Fault" be
comes a tough uptown shuffle, with lord blazing
away at his ax. On "You Don't Know What I ove Is,"
Ford puts down the guitar lor a saxophone, and the
slow, loungy jazz mutterings of Nagle's keys develop
into a subtle groove toward the end of the track. Nagle
also stands out on the next cut, "My Time after
Awhile," a midtempo laidback romp.
lord steps back into the spotlight on "Raining in
My Heart," a slow blues walking ballad with more
screaming guitar licks. I'he album winds up with a
cool, stripped-down version of the classic Walter Ja
cobs tune "Blue and Lonesome."
Although there are only seven trackson the album,
most approach or pass the 10 minute mark — a sign
of the significant jams lord favors. His rough vocals
are no weight on the fierce grooves, either. And it a
new live album isn't enough, you can check out
Robben Ford at Yoshi's in Oakland tonight through
Sunday.
