# Gram Parsons
## "Gram Parsons & the Fallen Angels" 
### 
Gram Parsons has a decidedly mixed her
itage. By merging country and rock into what he
called "cosmic American music" and is now
called everything from roots rock to alternative
country, he blazed a trail for class acts such as
Uncle Tupelo and the Old 975. At the same time
though, he loosened the bowels of rock '11' roll to
unleash massive turds like the Eagles and Jimmy
Buffett. So what is the legacy of Mr. Parsons?
Parsons played in several bands, including
the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers.
Through these connections he started hanging
out with Keith Richards. At the time, Richards
remarked, "Ciram Parsons gets better coke than
the Mafia." Since doing coke and smack with a
Rolling Stone beats working, Parsons quit
music and disappeared for more than two
years. In 1973 he emerged with a solo album,
put a band together and hit the road. During
the tour he recorded a radio broadcast which is
now the "Ciram Parsons & the Fallen Angels
Live 1973"* CD.
I his album is a collection of saving graces.
Instead of the sterile collection of session play
ers featured on Parson's studio albums, the Fall
en Angels sound at times as if they'll fall apart
before the next chorus. This sloppiness adds to
the boozy, bluesy vitality of Parsons' music. On
"l!r\ One More Time" the pedal steel guitar

player has just come in from last call at a road
side honky tonk, and on "Big Mouth Mines'' the
rhythm section is a bucket full of coal rolling
down a hill. .. but somehow it all works.
When he performed the show Parsons was
six months and five days away from death, and
at times he sounds it. I lis voice, never strong,
has a tendency to break when pushed, and on
high-octane songs like "Six I Jays 011 the Road"
he pushes it hard. But every time Parsons' voice
sounds like it's going to give up the ghost six
months and five days ahead of schedule, Tin
mylou I larris comes in like an angel. The beau
ty of their singing on "Love I lurts simply has
to be heard. Harris takes this ramshackle band
and drugged out singer and turns the situation
on its head.
The bottom line is that (iram Parsons is just
damn cool. He hated New York C.ity. lie
dropped out of I larvard. I le invented "No 1 )e
-pression" music when the guys in I ncle I upelo
were cooing in the crib. Try not to think of how
you could've been spared a life of listening to
"Desperado" and "Margaritaville," and instead
check out this album. 'Think of how much
poorer music would be if (iram had stuck out
I larvard, become a systems engineer and died
old and boring.
