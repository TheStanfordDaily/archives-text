Imagine mixing Sweet Money in 11 it-
Rock, Ani I )ilranco, llu' poetry you wrote
in your Ireshman year ol high school aiul
kick ass slap bass playing youVI have a
pretty good approximation of I .una
love's debut album,"(ktoroon." The
album consists ol 13 very rhythmic, very
folksy songs that each have a strong per
sonality.
With definite influences from African,
Irish and Indian music and Irom country,
bluegrass and ja/v (plus a cover of a Kurt
Cohain song and some yodeling), love
distinguishes herself as a very versatile
songstress with a good ear for how
strongly contrasting sounds can g»> well
together. Unfortunately, she doesn't quite
seem to understand lli.it melodies should
have something to do with (licit subject
matter. Although she is an inspired song
writer with a great band, she clearly has
nothing to say. With a loaded title like
"( Ktmoon, I expected her to have some
point in the album. Wrong. I ler message
seems to be that she likes writing music.
Strangely enough, she doesn't need to say
any more. Ihe sounds stand oil their
own.
Track one continues in the vein <>l the
add together music we all love so well: It
starts out with a head boppin' hand drum
beat, continues with I ove's voice, then a

little* slap Imss ,ind NAM! izzal.l Keggae
beat? Yes, that's what that is anil an accoi
dion and, and, and . . . lemme know il you
don't end up doing a mini wop ol youi
own by the time the hass kicks in. It means
you have a incilii a I problem.
Track two comhines a womlerlul tunc
reminiscent ol church hymns with some
ol the most repetitive, meaningless lyi iis I
have ever heard: "I have tried all I
can / and I have tried to understand /I
have tried .ill I can to understand / what a
rib has to do with a woman and a man, but
I just can't, can't understand.' Oh. OK,
I .aura. Nut the musk outside ol the words
is so interesting that even the most dis
criminating listener will lorcc herself to
sing the awful lyrics nist In be able to sing
along.
I'rack three is anothci offender. More
repetitive lyi iis All the pushing I can do /
all the shoving I can do / all the pulling I
can d<» will not move you Nut the song
has the simple sensibility and harmonies
ol ( rosby, Stills and Nash songs plus a re
ally soothing warm sound.
And soon. Naskally, buy thealbuin. It's
worth your time and money il you like
fnlk. Nut don't buy it lor what she has to
say. Nuy the release Ix'cause you want to
hear some really good musk.
