## A 						Chef in Love 
### 
"A CJhel in 1.0vc," an Academy Award
nominee this year for best foreign film, is .1
love story about a chef, Pascal Ichac (Pierre
Richard), his relationship with the beautiful
Princess (re ilia Abachidze (Nino Kirtad/e)
and his culinary creations and various tal
ents.
Visually, aurally and (111 the imagination
of anyone who sees the film) gustatoriallv,
the film details the lives of two very sensual
people. Nostalgic yet strangely celebratory
it also makes the sensual experience of the
audicncea clear goal Prom the beautiful set
tings in the Republic of (ieorgia to the rich
music the charaiters ol the movie often find
themselves singing and dancing to the
movie is almost a life unto itself.
I lie film begins in Paris in I L ) L )S, as Anton
(ioglolad/e (lean Yves (iautier) meets with
Marcelle Ichac (Micheline Presle), the niece
of the illustrious chef, lighter and lover, Pas
cal Ichac. Marcelle presents Anton a manu
script written by her uncle, which details his
passionate affair with Anton's mother, < ecil

ia, thiil took place in (ieorgia in the 19205. As
the revolution in neighboring Russia sweeps
into < ieorgi.i, Pascal must endure the wrath
ot a young officer, Zigmuiul (iolod/.e, who

has fallen in love with ( ccilia.
While the movie has a wonderful setting
interesting and dynamic characters and z
moving plot, the actual story is slow-mov

ing. Ai times the artistry of the film under
cuts its clarity. The switching back and forth
between past and present is often awkward.
Kven though the movie is enjoyable, it grows
tedious toward the end because a great deal
of things are never explained. It doesn't seem
the filmmaker had any idea why certain
artistic scenes appear other than just to seem
artistic. And that's not enough.
By the same token, some of the main
characters are not very realistic. I ike certain
elements of the plot, they are so passionate
and creative that they seem less like movie
characters and more like plot devices. T heir
motivations are often too cloaked and mys
terious.
Generally, however, "A Chef in Love" is a
delight. Flanked on all sides with the neces
sary elements of a good flick, the casual
moviegoer will have to look very hard to find
the gaps and flaws in the plot and will in
stead be overwhelmed and pleasured by the
atmosphere.
