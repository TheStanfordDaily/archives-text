# Female Perversions
## 
### 
Watching; 'Tomale Perversions" gives
you tlu* Icclini; ol peering into one ol two
things: either a hook ol psychological case
studies 01 a cage of lah rats.
Although the characters' afflictions
range from your run ol the null body
image paranoia to the less common kleplo
mania, they are portrayed in such a dismal
ly eerie way as to distance us troni what we
see initially, anyway.

The main character we study is Eve
(Tilda Swinton), an accomplished lawyer
on her way to becoming a judge. (Gauging
from the standard measures of happiness
success in career, success in love, a nice
house, nice clothes — Eve seems like she
should be content, but she isn't, and it's be
cause ol the numerous demons that con
stantly haunt her.
Eye fears gcttim; fat and ugly. She rushes

to a lingerie store in .1 tit of exhibitionism,
using the store clerk and a random old man
as judges. She fears losing the judgeship and
obsesses over all her "wrong" answers after
a crucial interview. She fears memories
from childhood, fragments of which con
stantly reappear in disturbing dreams. She
is in such a constant state of fear and insta
bility that we cannot envy her for what she
does have but instead worry as she takes on
destructive coping mechanisms.
One of her reactions leads to a lesbian af
fair with Renee (Karen Sillas), the doctor
next door to her law office. The episode
seems to come out of nowhere, with 110
prior indications that Eve swings both
ways. Moreover, she is happily in a relation
ship with a man. But perhaps the scenario
just serves to emphasize the irrational and
enigmatic nature of perverse behavior.
Irrational behavior also afflicts the peo
ple around her, including her sister, Made-
Ivn (Amy Madigan), and Madelyn's friends.
Madelyn, who is as coarse and rugged as
Hve is refined, is a closet kleptomaniac. Her
latest run-in with the law ironically brings
her and Rve together, adding tension to
their already rocky relationship.
In what is probably not the most thera
peutic living situation, Madelyn surrounds
herself with a dancer / stripper, a woman
desperate to get married and a tomboy
going through puberty. The collected frus
tration inspires one particularly circus-like
scene at Madelyn's house in which the
women expiate their angst with the help of

alcohol and slow-dancing.
Hut there is a note of hope in this other
wise sobering drama, appropriately sound
ed by Kdwina (Dale Shuger), the tomboy. It
seems to say that modern women, though
still struggling with many of the same old
issues, at least have a unity with which to go
forward and confront the future.
