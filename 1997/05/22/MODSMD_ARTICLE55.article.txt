# Night Falls on Manhattan
## 
### 
With a few more action sequences and fewer minutes, direc
tor Sidney Lumet s latest film would make for a damned good
episode of one of TV's many cop dramas.
Unfortunately, "Night Falls on Manhattan" is virtually ac
tion-free, two hours long and a feature film in wide release —
none of which it really ought to be. Were it not for some ex
cellent, perhaps even Oscar-worthy performances, this
movie would be a contender for 1997's most slow-moving
picture.
Andy Garcia plays Sean Casey, a hard-working, honest-Abe
ex-cop and assistant district attorney in New York. In the
movie's opening scene, Sean's father and his partner are staking
out a drug dealer's home in a routine bust. After Sean's father is
sliot and almost killed, cops from three precincts arrive as back
up, a shoot-out ensues, three cops are killed and the drug deal
er escapes.
This opening scene is exciting and intense, and had the rest
of the movie followed its lead, "Night Falls on Manhattan"
would definitely have been a winner. Instead, the next two
hours are spent following Sean, first as he is hand-picked by the

district attorney to prosecute the case, which he easily wins, and
then as he himself wins the election for district attorney. It is at

this point that Scan uncovers corruption on the police force,
corruption that noes all the wa\ hack to the incident with his la
thcr and that forces him to make some ver\ difficult (it not
diched) decisions.
Ciarcia is convincing as Sean, a man who has always played
hv the rules and is unprepared tohend or break them. I he best
scenes in the movie are those between (larcia and lan I lolni,
who plays Ins lather, as both ac tors convey the familial love and
intense closeness ol their relationship with a natural ease.
1 ess natural are the scenes between (iarcia and I ena Olin.
(.")lin plays Sean's highly improbable love interest, a lawyer who
works for the drug dealer's delense attorney, who is played by
Richard l>reylnss. Presumably Olin's charadei is included to
bring to the him what I lollywood considers to be "humanity
(translation: sexual relationship), but really she's iust an unnec
essary accessory.
Acting aside, "Night falls on Manhattan'' remains a shell ol
a movie,one that would have served a much better purpose had
it been an hour long episode of a I V show.
