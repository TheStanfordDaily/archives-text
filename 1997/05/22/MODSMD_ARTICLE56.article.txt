## THE 						GOOD, THE BAD AND THE FIERCELY FUNNY 
### 
I his month's new video releases range from the
dumb (but still entertaining enough to watch when
there's nothing else to do) to the excellent.
In the action genre, "Daylight" and "Ransom" cover
both these extremes.
"Daylight," with Sylvester Stallone, is very reminis
cent ol "The Poseidon Adventure." This time, 10 peo-

pie are trapped under the I ludson River in the I lolland
Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and the
tunnel is slowly filling with water. Considering the
mass destruction that caused the tunnel's openings to
collapse, this movie should not even have existed in the
first place because everybody inside the tunnel should
have died. That detail aside, the special effects are ex
cellent although not groundbreaking. The number of
coincidences used to drive the plot is so high that these
ruin the movie, liut, however unrealistic the movie

may be, it is still enjoyable.
"Ransom," on the other hand, benefits from much better
acting and a more creative plot. Ron Howard, the director,
compared this film to his "Apollo 13" — it definitely has the
same nail-biting suspense from start until end. In case you
don't know the plot of "Ransom," here's a synopsis: The son of
wealthy airline owner Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is kid
napped. After a botched attempt to pay the ransom, Mullen

offers the $2 million as a reward to whoever turns in the kid
tiappers. In the end, it becomes clear whether this unusual
method of dealing with the kidnappers is a success.
In the comedy department there's "l ierce (Ireatures" and
"Beavisand Butt-head Do America. Be warned, though, that
John Cleese is definitely better than Beavis and Butt head in
their first movie.

It should come as no surprise that the cast of "fierce (!rea
tures" (reunited from "A fish Called Wanda") makes this
movie into a non-stop comedy. A zoo director (( leese) is in
danger of losing his job il he does not make the zoo more prol
itable. Using the logic successfully employed by I ox television
executives, he dec ides the best way to do that is to turn the zoo
into a display case for violent and dangerous creatures. At the
same time, the zoo's owners manage to turn everything into a
mess with some crazy marketing ploys, "fierce (Creatures" is .1
must-see.
"Beavis and Butt head I )o America," on the other hand,
is optional. The plot of this movie is much simpler: After
their television is stolen, Beavis and Butt head end up in
las Vegas to "do someone's wife for $10,000." from las
Vegas, they go cross country to Washington, I.( . Thank
God California was spared from these two because they
manage to insult everyone they meet, including the presi
dent. If you need a good reason to watch this movie, you

(..in always claim it's to analyze lis social commentary.
More debatable is whether can you st.iiul the sound ol
beavis and butt head's continuous giggling and snorting
lor 90 minutes. II you can, this movie is a good waste ol
those 90 minutes.
