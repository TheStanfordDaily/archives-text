CRINKLE. CRACKLE. Crinkle, crinkle,
crackle, bite.
No, those are not the sounds of a modern
piece from the San Francisco Symphony.

Instead,
they are the
noises that
came from

the guy sit
ting in front of me at the concert —the guy
who decided that during the second move
ment of I'iotr Tchaikovsky's "Symphonic
Pathetique" he had to eat a Snickers bar.
Thus, my experience in Davies Symphony
I fall was colored by I he loud unwrapping of
.1 candy bar. Who would've thought?
Despite the hunger Friday night s pro
gram seems to have induced on patrons, I
generally was moved by the three pieces
conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas,
The night appropriately began with .1
seldom-performed piece by I ran/ I iszt,the
Mephisto Waltz" from Ins "Faust Sympho
ny." It is a whimsical piece that is meant to
invoke the situation whereupon Mephisto
and Faust arrive at an inn. Mephisto steals
the bandleader s violin to make the music
hotter, and the dancers dance in wild aban
don. What ensues is .1 vivid and mysterious
piece, which was played masterfully by the
San Francisco Symphony.
Ihe next item on the menu was the
"Adagio" from Symphony No. 10, a work by
(iustav Mahler that was left unfinished at
his death in 191 I. The adagio has an intense
melody with .1 wide range, enriched by
counterpoint from the horns and violas.

This leads to a series of dense and dissonant
chords. The close of the piece, however — a
very slow, spacious cadence — was so long
that you could feel it grate on the audience.
The highlight of the evening came after
the intermission, with Tchaikovsky's "Sym
phonic Pathetique" (Symphony No. 6 in B
Minor, Opus 74, Pathetique). 1 must con
less that I like this piece very much, so that
even if the symphony had done an abom
inable job I might still have enjoyed it. Yet I
didn't need to worry. The interpretation
was wonderful, and I came away from the
performance feeling the music strongly, de
spite the candy wrapper's intrusion of
counterpoint into the music.
Tchaikovsky, too, wrote this piece near
his death. In fact, the first performance of it
was three weeks before he died. Under his
direction, the piece did not receive a warm
welcome. In its second performance, how
ever, which followed soon after his death,
the audience was very moved by its gloom.
I he piece has four movements, includ
ing the well known second movement, "Al
legro con grazia." ( It was, of course, during
this movement that the person in front of
me chose to eat his candy bar.) The power
ful third movement, "Allegro molto vivace,"

invokes well the meaning of patetichesky in
Russian: a connotation of sadness and suf
fering that has no relation to the word's

meaning in English. The last
movement begins with a pierc
ing cry that contrasts with the
bang left by the march. An ob-

sessive and threatening
melody follows, and then
the sound of laments and
defeat. The last dying
pulse is slow and quiet,

ending at a point after which you are sure
the music has already ended. Thomas con
ducted the piece beautifully, and he re
ceived a standing ovation at the end of the
evening.
1 must add that this was my first time at
the symphony since the strike, and al
though I missed what would have been a
great night of Beethoven in February, I sup
ported the musicians' cause. I will report,
though, that despite the musicians' respite
and lack of practice during that period, the
symphony sounded great.
I, for one, am glad it is back. Be sure not to
miss the upcoming performances of both
Liszt and Mahler, as well as the incredible pro
gram the symphony is putting on called "The
Sacred and the Profane," with such highlights
as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Requiem."
