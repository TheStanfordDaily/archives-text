## See Dickens and Jane write 
### Samuel Park 
I've committed many a social faux-pas in
my years at Stanford. Once, I was talking to
this very self-important writer, and I told her 1
couldn't relate to any of the stories in her new
collection because I hadn't gone through a di
vorce (the topic of most of the stories in that
book).
She snapped back, "Well, then maybe you
should be reading Dickens."
Ouch. But aside from the fact that Char
lie is the superior scribe of the two, I think
this writer was hinting at something very
true. As much as literary critics and scholars
try to impose scientific standards on litera
ture, the fact is that reading and writing are

deeply personal activities.
I, for one, would like to imagine myself a
sophisticated, well-read English major, but
when I write about a book, it often has little
to do with the work's literary merits and
everything to do with what's going on with
my life at that point.
For instance, 1 never understood or cared
about Anton Chekhov until I got my first
job. It was a tedious, mind-dulling, ridicu
lous job. I was very busy feeling sorry for
myself until I realized that this was the same
kind of job my parents had held for 25 years
in order to pay the bills. But the thing is, they
were resigned to their situation and found

relief and escape in knowing that they were
paying the way for someone else's happiness
and success. So, "Uncle Vanya."
And so on. Right now, I'm big on Jane
Austen, not because her literature is so bril
liant (which it is) but because her novels have
so much to say about people of a young gener
ation negotiating love and finding a place in
the world. Sounds familiar? Austen's enclosed
communities bear a remarkable resemblance
to a place like Stanford, and the men and
women populating her novels could very
much be found sharing fro yos at the Co Po or
having conversations in dorm hallways.
I ler books appear terribly remote and aus-

tore in those Penguin Classic editions with
lengthy introductions and footnotes, but for
me Austen is like leafing through the ideal
magazine â€” no ads, just intelligent and sen
sitive treatment of the issues that matter, like
finding love and learning to be happy.
Maybe that writer 1 offended shouldn't
have been so irked after all. Regardless of their
merits, Marcel Proust and Stendhal will never
do for me what Jane and Anton have done
over the years. In my opinion, a great book is
like a great friend: Its value has less to do with
what other people think of him or her than
with what it has to say to me and how well it
can relate to my problems and my interests.
