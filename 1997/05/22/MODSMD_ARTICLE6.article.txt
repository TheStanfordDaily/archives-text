# Student insurance: New plan to be implemented in the fall.
## 
### Elizabeth Pianca 
Effective Sept. 1, Stanford's
student health insurance will
change to Cardinal Care, a new
managed health care insurance
program sponsored by Cowell
Student Health Service and Blue
Cross of California.
All students are automatically
enrolled in the Stanford spon
sored insurance plan unless they
choose to waive that option in

favor of their own insurance plan. The students are
charged $182 per quarter for the plan.
Since 1987 both undergraduates and graduates
have been required to be insured. Stanford decided

to require health insurance coverage for students
as a result of rising health care costs, the number of
uninsured students and the need to maximize the
value of students' premiums said Jane Meier, asso
ciate director of Cowell Student I lealth Center.
About 50 percent of the student population is
enrolled under the current student health insur
ance plan, which ends August 31, sponsored by
MKCiA Life and Health Insurance Company. Of
these students enrolled, 75 percent are graduate
students and 25 percent are undergraduate stu
dents, said Ira Friedman, director of Cowell.
By entering into a managed health care plan,
costs are reduced because Blue Cross has a large
network of providers with whom they have pre-ne-


Friedman
gotiated the cost for services. Ac
cording to Sara Singer, a consul
tant to the insurance committee
and director of research and admin
istration for health management at
the Graduate School of Business,
"Unless Stanford had entered into
a managed health care plan, premi
ums would have continued to in
crease without any significant in
crease in benefits."
Decision to change
An insurance committee, made
up of four students and 10 adminis
trators, met for more than two
years before deciding on the new
plan. The committee included rep
resentatives from t he Office of Stu
dent Affairs, the Department of
Athletics, the Registrar's Office,
the Financial Aids Office, Risk
Management, Escondido Village,
Bechtel International Center and
(Lowell.
• "Comments from concerned
students brought changes to the
old plan," said Friedman. Accord
ing to Friedman, students were
concerned that the old plan did not
minimize out-of-pocket expenses
for students, excluded students
from a number of services and did
nbt protect students from inflation
ary premiums.
"We solicited eight potential
vendors, and we selected Blue
Cross because of its reputat ion as
being a quality insurer, favorable
contracts with private physicians
and hospitals, experience with stu
dent. plans and ability to enhance
benefits and keep the price the
same," said Missy Krasner, a re
cent Stanford graduate and a mem
ber of the insurance committee.
For a premium cost of $182 per
quarter — the same quarterly pre
mium cost as the current insurance
plan — students will be enrolled in
a health care plan that is a combi
nation of a health maintenance or
ganization, commonly known as an
HMO; preferred provider organiza
tion, called a PPO; and indemnity
insurance plan.
Under Cardinal Care, Cowell
Student Health Service will act as
t he primary care provider for stu
dents. Most services rendered by
Cowell will be paid fully by Blue
Cross, with a few exceptions, in
cluding prescription drugs. Based
on a contract with Stanford I lealth
Services, students can also see
physicians at the Stanford Medical
Center after a referral from a Cow

ell physician. This is considered
standard coverage for an HMO.
If a student wishes to obtain ser
vices outside of Cowell, he or she
has the option of either going to any
Blue Cross network provider in
California or any Blue Shield / Blue
Cross network provider in the
United States. Students only re
ceive 80 percent coverage after a
$200 deductible, but no referral is
needed from a Cowell physician.
According to Cowell, close to 70
percent of U.S. physicians and hos
pitals are members of the Blue
Shield / Blue Cross plan. This
refers to the PPO coverage.
Finally, students have a third
option of going to a non-network
provider and receiving between 60
percent and 80 percent coverage
after a $300 deductible is paid.
According to Susan Tanner, a
Law School student and member
of the insurance committee, the
third option was included because
"we wanted to make sure that stu
dents could still have the ability to
obtain reimbursements for visits
to non-network health care
providers — for example, because a
previous relationship had been es
tablished prior to attending Stan
ford."
However, Meier believes that
most students will stay within the
services at Cowell and Stanford
Health Services.
"We believe that the $200 de
ductible along with the 20-percent
co-payment is enough of a financial
burden for most students that
(here will not be much use with the
network providers," said Meier.
For students not joining Cardi
nal Care, little will change, as "the
University is committed to univer
sal access to basic services for all
students," said Meier.
Cowell is funded through a com
bination of University general
funds and user fees such as phar
macy costs, physical therapy, aller
gy treatments and long-term psy
chotherapy. Most services at Cow
ell have a small user fee except for
office visits, urgent aire and short
term counseling and psychological
services that have no user fees. Ac
cording to Meier, students enrolled
in Cardinal Care will benefit from
reduced user fees for certain ser
vices.
The new plan
According to Friedman, one of
the goals of the plan is to provide
adequate coverage for catastrophic
accidents.
"Students are generally
healthy," he said. "However, there
was an overall need for the insur

ance plan to include catastrophic
coverage."
Unlike the old plan, which had
maximum coverage of $250,000
while the student was enrolled at
Stanford, the new plan has no max
imum for services rendered at Cow
ell or through Stanford Health Ser
vices and a $5 million maximum for
services rendered from either a net
work or a non-network provider.
However, having a high maxi
mum affects few students. Only
five or fewer students exceed
$100,000 in claims per year, Meier
said.
Berkeley and UC-Davis also
have a student health insurance
plan sponsored by Blue Cross. One
of the major differences between
the Davis plan and the Stanford
plan is that students do not receive
100-percent coverage when they
visit the student health center at
Davis. Instead, students enrolled in
the student health insurance plan
must pay a copayment of any where
between $5 to $25 when they uti
lize the services from the health
center. This co-payment is not re
imbursed by Blue Cross.
"The premium to cover a stu
dent with the maximum benefits
that Cardinal Care provides for
Stanford students would be astro
nomical," said Trish Layton, a rep
resentative from the Student
Health Insurance Office at UC-
Davis, which also requires students
to have health insurance.
But Stanford has one advantage
over most other colleges, according
to Sue Ohanian, a director in edu
cation / public market business sec
tor at Blue Cross and the Blue
Cross representative to Stanford.
"Because Stanford has exten
sive health services available, it is
able to provide students with more
care than most universities," said
Ohanian. "Most universities are
limited to the amount of aire avail
able to students based on the types
of health services available."
Compared with other schools,
which require mandatory student
health insurance or offer student
health insurance plans, "Stan
ford's plan is highly sophisticated
and on the high end of servicing
students," said Singer.
Between 20 percent and 30 per
cent of colleges in the United States
require students to be covered by a
health insurance plan, according to
Friedman.
Meier added, "Most universities
are reluctant to put a health insur
ance requirement into place. But
without mandatory health insur
ance it is difficult to provide a wide
range of services at a small cost."

are reluctant to put a health insur
ance requirement into place. But
without mandatory health insur
ance it is difficult to provide a wide
range of services at a small cost."
