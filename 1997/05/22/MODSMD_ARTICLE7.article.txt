Eddy Pereles, a 25-year-old Redwood
City resident, was convicted on Monday of
the 1994 murder of Stanford student
David Liu.
Liu, 23, hud stopped out while pursuing
a master's decree in product design to
work in the area. He was killed on the way
to visit friends in the Park Village apart

ments near (Oregon Expressway and High
way 101.
Two men shot Liu in the back and
robbed him of his wallet, car keys and car
alarm. He was pronounced dead at the
Stanford Medical Center half an hour

Liu, a San Jose resident, received his
undergraduate degree from Cornell Uni-

versity. After his death, Liu's
friends, family and colleagues set
up a memorial fund to endow an
annual lecture in product design.
The first lecture will take place this
fall.
A San Jose jury found Pereles
guilty of robbery and reckless in
difference to human life after a

two-week trial in the Santa Clara
County Superior Court.
Another man, Larry Paul, 24,

leged part, in Liu's murder. Prose
cutors have said that Paul fired the
gun that killed Liu.

murder was the climax of an in
creasingly violent string of rob
beries on the Peninsula. Pereles
and Paul were arrested two
months after the murder, when in

dence from a number of robberies
and unearthed similarities, accord

torney, said he would appeal the
conviction.

tence Pereles on July 25. He faces a
maximum sentence of life in prison
without the possibility of parole.
