# Weekly hospital visits by volunteers foster friendships
## Students work to cheer veterans 
### Sheelah Kolhatkar 
As Memorial Day approaches,
people across the country will re
member those who died serving
our country. The United Stu
dents for Veterans' Health is a
national organization that re
members veterans who are still
here.
"Most of the veterans just want
someone to talk and share their
thoughts with," said sophomore
Sayema Hameed, the incoming
local program director of the orga
nization.
"This has been one of the most
personally satisfying experiences
I've had at Stanford," she said.
Hameed began volunteering
last fall and is now responsible for
coordinating the efforts of the
volunteers and scheduling the
groups that visit the Menlo Park
Veterans Association Hospital in
two daily shifts during the week.
This quarter, there are more than
85 student volunteers.
Volunteers typically spend two
hours a week at the hospital visit

ing with the veterans and working
with nurses. They also organize
and participate in activities, in
cluding music performances and
dinners involving students, pa
tients and their families. The hos
pital houses about 100 extended
care patients, most of whom
served in World War II or the Viet
nam War.
Many of them are elderly, suf
fering from Alzheimer's disease,
psychogeriatric conditions or
physical disabilities.
"The patients just love the vol
unteers," said Jim McDermott,
the hospital's recreational thera
pist. "The students are awesome.
They're bright; they're motivat
ed. And the patients just can't
wait to see them."
He explained that the hospital
staff are often busy and need peo
ple to provide a extra helping hand.
"Not only do the volunteers fill
a need that the vets have," he said,
"but we need the support as well."
United Students has a local pro
gram as well as a national network.
The national arm works to expand

United Students, with chapters on
campuses from Harvard Universi
ty to UCLA. The goal of the organi
zation is to help war veterans in
hospitals across the country.
The organization was founded
in 1994 by Vance Vanier, who
graduated from Stanford in
1995. Now in medical school at
Johns Hopkins University,
Vanier used to volunteer at the
Palo Alto Veterans Hospital in
his spare time, said sophomore
Doug Chung, the United Stu
dents publicity director.
Interacting with the patients
— many of whom have lost family
contacts — prompted Vanier to
create United Students. The pro
gram strives to bring volunteers
to every Veterans Administration
hospital that is close to a college
campus.
One of the strengths of the pro
gram is the opportunity to develop
strong relationships with the pa
tients. This is what attracted ju
nior Harith Rajagopalan, a chem
istry major, to get involved.
Rajagopalan ia co-director of na
tional branch of the organization
along with junior Rahul Khurana.
Together, they recruit motivated

students at other universities,
helping them establish local chap
ters that serve nearby veterans
hospitals.
Forging bonds with these ex
traordinary patients has many
challenges, along with great re
wards. The hospital has lew win
dows and can bo grim; it can be dif
ficult to see patients in this sti (11ng
environment.
In addition, many volunteers
become attached to patients who
are ill. When veterans die, it is a
psychological burden Cor the stu
dents, according to Rajagopalan.
At the same time, the patients
have had fascinating life experi
ences that they are more than
happy to share. On a typical visit, to
the Veterans Administration, stu
dents may have the opportunity to
talk to Mr. Giovanni, a veteran
from Montana.
Giovanni loves opera. When
asked how he was doing, he
replied that he was "still kick
ing." Graysome was inducted
during World War II and was
sent overseas.
"I would have liked to be an

opera singer," he said. "But I didn't
get the chance." On a good day, the
student volunteers say he will do a
rendition of Frank Sinatra.
8.8. is also a World War II vet,
originally from Louisiana.
"Boy, I wish I was back there,"
he said of his home town. "It's the
best place in the world."
8.8. is full of vivid memories of
the war experiences. He served in
Australia under Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur and described how
Eleanor Roosevelt integrated the

army, which had previously been
racially segregated.
"She was a gwxl woman," he
said. "But she was mean. She's like
my mother. Tough, but she was the
best woman in the world."
The volunteers benefit from the
wisdom of these veterans while pro
viding a source of comfort.
Despite the challenging aspects
of being a United Students volun
teer, Hameed feels positive about
the experience because "even in a
very, very small way, I've made a
difference to these people," she
said.
"We need to be there for them,
and that's why our organization is
so important."
