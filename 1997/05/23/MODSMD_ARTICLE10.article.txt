Albert proclaims innocence
NEW \ ORK (AP) — In the deep voice familiar to
millions of sports fans, Marv Albert proclaimed
himself innocent of the sex charges against him yes
terday. And NBC said he will broadcast the NBA
playoffs as planned this weekend.
Albert, 53, was indicted Monday on charges of
forcible sodomy and assault.
A woman who said she has been a friend of
Albert s for years told police he bit her repeatedly
and forced her to perform oral sex in an Arlington,
Va., hotel room Feb. 12. If convicted, he could get
life in prison.
Albert's 41-year-old accuser faces criminal
charges herself: She is accused of threatening to kill
a former boyfriend in March.

Flinn given general discharge
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rejecting bomber pilot
Kelly Flinn's bid for an honorable discharge, Air
Force Secretary Sheila Widnall granted her a gener
al discharge yesterday to avoid a court-martial on
charges of adultery, lying and disobeying an order.
Widnall said the pilot's "lack of integrity" and
her "disobedience to orders" were more important
to the Air Force than the adultery charges resulting
of an affair with a married man.
In granting a general discharge "under honor
able conditions," the secretary said she acted to
"protect the Air Force core values."
"I don't look at it in terms of a victory," Widnall
said. "I'm satisfied that the resolution we reached in
this case is fair."
