# Yeltsin lashes out at military
## Russian president fires defense minister, top general 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin fired his defense
minister and denounced his top generals yesterday in
an angry televised outburst in which he savaged
them for resisting cuts in Russia's overmanned,
underfunded armed forces.
Looking exasperated, the Russian president dis
missed Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and the coun
try's top military commander, Gen. Viktor Sain
sonov, head of the general staff.
Yeltsin said the defense chiefs had ignored his
orders to reform the 1.7-million-strong armed forces,
which are badly demoralized, ill-trained and poorly
equipped.
"I am not just unsatisfied. I am outraged by the
course of reform in the army and the state of the mil
itary altogether," Yeltsin said in an address to the
National Defense Council broadcast nationally on

Russian television networks.
"What is going on now? A soldier gets thinner, and
generals grow fat. 1 hey have built dachas (country
homes) for themselves throughout Russia. What is
this?" he asked.
The Russian armed forces are in chaos, with offi
cers and soldiers going months without pay or proper
rations. 1 he military has received few new weapons
in recent years, and its combat ability has all but col
lapsed — as shown by its humiliating defeat by a
small guerrilla army during a 22-month war in the
breakaway Chechnya region.
At the same time, several top generals have been
arrested for embezzlement and other crimes.
Yeltsin, trying to get stalled political and econom
ic reforms going again, stressed that he was com
mander-in-chief of the military.
