University commitment
to disability access still
calls for improvement

WHAT IF STANFORD held
a party and no one could
show up? This question is
not one usually raised by the aver
age student, but it is a very com
mon one for the disabled students
on campus who are unable to access
many of the University's facilities.
Although the Americans with
Disabilities Act mandates that
every program or activity at an edu
cational institution be accessible to
people with disabilities, the Univer
sity has been remarkably slow in
fulfilling its legal obligations. Nev
ertheless, this week's announce
ment that the University is com
mitted to making its major audito
riums and the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center fully
accessible is a promising move
toward total compliance — a move
that needs to be followed up with
further action and a concrete plan
for making the campus as accessi
ble as possible.
Over the past weeks, the disabled
community has brought its prob
lems with the campus' accessibility
to the forefront of campus discus
sion. In addition to voicing their
views at the recent student /
administration forums, students
posted fliers around campus (many
of which have since been mysteri
ously torn down) rating individual
buildings in such categories as first
floor access and Braille signs. They
submitted a petition with almost
350 signatures to the President's
and Provost's Offices calling for
immediate improvements to cam
pus facilities.
The community's activism —
and frustration — are well justified
because their ability to participate
in Stanford's full range of activities
is significantly limited by the cur
rent state of campus facilities. As of

now, there is vertical wheelchair
access to only a few residences, a
limited amount of Braille signs
around campus, a paucity of blind
accessible computers and restricted
access to the community centers.
With such daily barriers to Stan
ford life, disabled students are
being denied their full rights under
the law.
Recognizing this fact, the Uni
versity has made an admirable
move in deciding to build an eleva
tor to allow access to the LGBCC
and to make Memorial Auditorium,
Cubberley Auditorium and Encina
Hall fully accessible by the begin
ning of fall quarter. These actions,
which will take a considerable com
mitment of money and resources,
shows that the University is indeed
making a good-faith effort to follow
the law.
Although the University is not
immediately heeding all requests
for accessibility improvements, the
disabled community must realize
that there are also certain financial
restraints that may delay full acces
sibility. With the University still
paying for earthquake reconstruc
tion, increasing the space between
stacks at Meyer and Green libraries
— one of the students' requests —
cannot reasonably be the topmost
priority.
In the meantime, though, the
University can accomplish smaller
projects that could benefit disabled
students. A map detailing which
buildings are accessible as well as
an increased number of Braille
signs are plans the University
should immediately undertake. In
addition, the University has yet to
come up with a comprehensive plan
on how to complete the larger pro
ject of total accessibility. This plan
is indeed a topmost priority.
Full accessibility is a massive
undertaking that requires the con
tinued commitment of the Univer
sity. Without such a commitment,
the University must remember
that it's not only betraying its dis
abled students — it's breaking the
law.
