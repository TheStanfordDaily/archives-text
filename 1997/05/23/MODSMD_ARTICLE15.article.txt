## The 						uniform of inequality 
### 
YbU ARE WHAT you wear. I make
this sad realization at two in the
morning as I watch the pizza deliv
ery man who looks a bit confused as he
climbs to the second floor.
He answers the growls of our nonprofit
stomachs and thanks us for the $2 tip with
a nonintrusive smile. I note the canvas cap
and matching non-Izod collared shirt. I
note the skin color and the accent. But I
make no inferences, and I have no idea,
five minutes later, what he looks like.
You are what you wear. It hardly cross
es my mind as I listen, awestruck now, to
the man sitting across from me at the Ecu
menical Hunger Project. As he sticks
address labels on the newsletters, he talks
about the Mexican revolution in the 19605.
He decries government corruption and
recounts diving for his life as police opened
fire on a peaceful rally.
He is wearing a long-sleeved dress shirt
and slacks. I note the trueness of his hands
to their task while he tells about the Catch
-22s of a population whose leaders siphon
money into their pockets. I note the depth
of his inflections and his shining, constant
eyes. I flash him a smile.
"Where were you educated?" asks one
of the volunteers, though she says
"iD6n.de fue Ud. educado?" because we
are talking in Spanish derivative. The well
dressed revolutionary looks up.
"I don't know what you mean. 1 didn't
have education," he says. She tries again,
"La education de Ud. idonde fue? You are

educated. I can tell."
"How do you know?"
"The way you speak."
"Yo no se que escuela," he says."I never
finished high school."
"Why are you working here, volunteer
ing?" I ask the intellectual. "They help me
with food," he says.
"What is your job?" I ask of the revolu
tionary, the veteran, the visionary.
"1 deliver pizzas."
You are what you wear. At Stanford,
ours is a three-tiered, designer intellectual,
caste system. Custodians wear burgundy
non-Izod collared shirts and jeans. Stu
dents wear braided leather belts, Dockers,
Bookstore apparel. Faculty wear slacks or
wool skirts and accessories.
Faculty hold dinners to present them
selves as resources to students. Custodians
clean up afterward. Perhaps there are real
ly only two castes.
This is not to say that there is no inter
action between students and Housing and
Dining workers. Indeed, I make a habit of
taking smiles into East Palo Alto and offer
ing them in a culturally sensitive manner.
But when someone from EPA walks
through my door with a pizza, he becomes
manual labor rather than intellectual cap
ital. It is true that the kids I tutor receive
my attention. The kids who serve me food
in the dining halls I barely notice.
A smile does not feed a family. Many of
the housing staff began working here at
age 20 and remain in the same positions 20

years later. My appreciation of the intellect
of University workers is nice, but the uti
lization of this intellect would be nicer.
I can dedicate my Stanford career to
"giving back to the community." For the
amount it helps my self-esteem, it is a rel
atively small commitment. And no matter
what my current intentions are, it will
probably help to get me a career some day.
For arriving at a Project Motivation
meeting with hot pizza, the delivery man
gets minimum wage plus tips. For cleaning
up after a party celebrating Alternative
Spring Break, the custodian gets few bene
fits, low job security and no opportunity
for promotion. Who serves whom?
In an economic frame of mind, it seems
almost unnecessary to ask this question.
Especially when the bright burgundy of
the custodian's embroidered shirt blurs his
features, and the pizza man's canvas cap
shades his shining eyes.
You are what you wear, which is fine. I
just have to be careful not to order a pizza
with t(K) much on it. A big piece of reality
might spill and stain my shirt. It doesn't
wash out so well.

Jocelyn Wiener, a .sophomore majoring in
urban studies, doesn'/ know where nudity
fits into said equation, but if the washing
machine remains broken, she guesses she
will vaporize or something.
