After the Senior Gift, donation requests keep coming

I CERTAINLY CAN empathize with
Andrew Rezvani's frustration at
being asked to contribute to Stan
ford's Senior Gift while lie is still pay
ing the high cost of tuition t he Univer
sity charges. And I'd like to warn him
that, as an alumnus, he will receive
many more calls and letters from Stan
ford asking for his money. In fact,
depending on the extent to which he
wants to continue his affiliation with
his alma mater, his monetary contribu
tions to Stanford may have only just
begun.
Rezvani will learn, for example, that

despite owning a diploma proving he
graduated, if he wants to be a "lifetime
member" of the Alumni Association,
he'll have to cough up a few hundred
dollars. Should he stay in the Bay Area
and decide to check out some Slavic lit
erature from Green, he'll find that as
an alumnus he's only allowed a few
days a year of visiting privileges to the
library and that even as a lifetime
member of the association, he'll still
need to pay a few hundred dollars for
the privilege to check out books from
the library. When his five year reunion
rolls around he'll discover that

reunions qualify as yet another special
event worthy of a donation.
Admirably, Rezvani still seems
intent on contributing to the University
in the future, albeit only to the depart
ments and organizations to which he
feels closest. I think it's great that he's
willing to contribute, but I hope he
won't withhold a contribution just
because it may be spent on something
seemingly tangential to his Stanford
experience.
Even at today's rates, tuition alone
cannot sustain a university the size and
caliber of Stanford. Alumni donations

help the school to maintain a Slavic lan
guage and literature department and to
repair earthquake damage. Both causes
are worthy of alumni support and both
projects are more interrelated than
Rezvani may realize.
As to specifying a department or
field for donations, I've always thought
that when I'm rich and famous I'd like
to donate money to support the arts at
Stanford. But until my first million
rolls in, I'm happy to send in $20 or so
a year to help with the plumbing.
