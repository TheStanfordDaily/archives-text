# Larkin RA wins first Harvey Award
## 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
Senior Andy Josephson, a resident assistant
in Larkin, was honored with the first Suzanne
and Robert Harvey Award for the outstanding
resident assistant in an all-freshman house.
Bob and Sue Harvey, the current Larkin resi
dent fellows, created the award this year — the
last year in which they will be RFs at Stanford.
The two wanted to acknowledge the role that
RAs play in developing close communities in all
freshman houses.
Along with the recognition that accompanies
the award, Josephson received $500 for personal
use.
Ross Shachter, an RF in Serra, said the Har
veys have been "real leaders in the community"
during their nine years at Larkin.
"I think this award is an example of the kind
of initiative they've taken," Shachter said.
Sue Harvey said she felt Josephson deserved
the award not only because he demonstrated a
high degree of maturity, responsibility and lead

ership but also because his enthusiasm inspired
the freshmen in Larkin to become involved in
leadership in and out of the dorm.
"RAs are some of the hardest working, most
dedicated people on campus," she said. She and
her husband were responsible for choosing the
recipient of this year's award.
"Andy inspired us with his dedication and ser
vice to set up this award," added Bob Harvey. He
said although this fact may have biased the selec
tion process for the award, "Andy's performance
was so outstanding that we don't feel guilty
about this."
Josephson, who is double majoring in political
science and biology, said the award acknowl
edged not only his own contribution to Larkin
but also that of his fellow residence staff.
"For me, this award is really a tribute to the
incredible Larkin staff we have this year,"
Josephson said. He also credited the Harveys
with picking members who were "diverse and dy
namic."
"Bob and Sue have been unbelievable,"
Josephson said. "The reason I came to Larkin

was because of them."
Josephson said that he didn't have a particular
philosophy on being an RA but said that it is im
portant to him to be "honest with the freshmen
and the rest of the staff about who you are.
"I think that no one can tell you what kind of
RAyou're going to be," he continued. "Everyone
brings something different to the job, and you re
ally have to figure it out on your own."
Jimmy Halow, another Larkin RA, said he
had enjoyed working with Josephson because of
his energy and dedication.
"Andy's incredible. It just seems like there's
nothing he can't do," Halow said.
"At the beginning of the year, we did a skit
where we did a dance to Kool & the Gang's 'The
Time.' Andy and I are possibly the worst dancers
in the world, but people ate it up because he put
so much energy into it," Halow said.
"I assumed all RAs were like him, but after
talking to other freshmen, I realized that he real
ly goes beyond the requirements and expecta
tions more than any other," Larkin freshman
Karen Wang said.
