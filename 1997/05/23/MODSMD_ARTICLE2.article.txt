# Smoothie by any other name sweet
## Corner Pocket dives into the mix with rival Jamba Juice 
### Allison Otto Contributing writer 
The competition to serve the coolest
smoothies in Tresidder Union just got a
little hotter.
Tresidder's Corner Pocket debuted a
new line of smoothies, along with lower
prices, yesterday in response to Jamba
Juice's recent success.
Richard Calbow, the director of retail
operations for Bon Appetit, which man
ages the Corner Pocket, hopes the prices,
considerably lower than those at Jamba
Juice, will draw some consumers back to
the Corner Pocket.
"There may be some customers that
are a little more value-oriented," Calbow

said. The lowest-priced smoothie at
Jamba Juice is $2,913, compared to $1.99
for the new Corner Pocket drinks.
Previously known for its pop-and
pizza combinations, the Corner Pocket
plans to incorporate the smoothies into
its four meal deals, so the customer can
buy a slice of pizza and a smoothie for
$2.77.
Although the pizza-and-smoothie
combinations are currently in the plan
ning stage, Calbow hopes to offer the new
meal deals sometime next week.
He said a relatively new and small
staff poses the greatest problem to the in
stallation of the proposed pizza and
smoothie combinations: The counter is
often staffed by only three people.

"I don't want long lines, " Calbow
said. "That'll turn people off."
The competition, however, remains
undaunted.
"Jamba Juice is a name that people
have come to love," said a spokesman
for the company. "Jamba Juice feels
that Stanford has embraced the store
there."
The initial consumer response to the
Corner Pocket smoothies seems to be a
positive one.
Freshman Matt Spence, an ASSIJ
Senator, sampled a strawberry-banana
mixture from the Corner Pocket
Wednesday afternoon and smiled ap
provingly. "It does justice to the name
smoothie," he said.
