# Conference title at stake
## Track treks north to take on Pac-10 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team will be competing at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this weekend in Seattle.
The team has high hopes going
into tomorrow's start.
"In the past, Stanford's best fin
ish has always been fourth. This
year both teams look to do better,"
said assistant coach Beth Alford-
Sullivan.
The women's team got a lift
after the Pac-10 Decathlon / Hep
tathlon Championships held last
weekend in Seattle. Sophomore
Tracye Lawyer won the heptathlon
event with a personal best of 5,663
points. Junior Katrinka Jackson
finished third and freshmen Joy
Goff and Julie Tinker finished fifth
and seventh, respectively. This
gives the women 22 points enter
ing competition this weekend. The
men will come into the meet with
two points as junior Adam Fusco
finished seventh in the decathlon .
The Cardinal hopes Lawyer will
score more points than the 10 she's
already earned as a result of her
first place finish. She will be com
peting in several events including
the high jump, the 200 meters and
the 4xloo-meter relay.
Junior Heather Miller has a
heavy assignment for the weekend
as well. The junior will be compet
ing the 100 and 200 meters.
"Heather has lots of Pac-10
experience," Alford-Sullivan said.
"We're looking for strong perfor
mances from her."
Two relay teams should do well
for the Cardinal women. Both the
4x 100-meter and the 4x400-meter
relay teams are ranked in the top
five for the meet. The Cardinal is
also expecting a strong perfor
mance from junior Bernadette
Armand, the current school record
holder in the 100-meter hurdles.
Stanford boasts a strong lineup
in the field events, particularly the
throwing events. The women
throwers earned a lot of the points
at Big Meet and are looking to do
the same in Washington. Perennial

throwing powers USC and UCLA
will give the women strong compe
tition. Goff and freshman Allison
Beatty will compete in the javelin.
The hammer will feature fresh
man Maggie Isaac and sophomore
Gina Heads. Freshman Summer
Pierson, who has one of the leading
throws in the countiy, will com
pete in the discus. Jackson will
compete in the shot put for the
Cardinal.
Women's middle distance and
distance events cannot be ignored.
Juniors Sarna Renfro and Kortney
Dunscombe will compete in the
10,000 meters and Monal Chokshi
will run the 3,000 meters. Sopho
more Mary Cobb will run the 5,000
meters. Junior Sara Moore will
run the 1,500 meters.
The Cardinal has three runners
entered in the 800 meters. Look for
strong performances from sopho
mores LaShawndra Pace and Jen
Carr as well as freshman Cynthia
Morman.
"We feel really pretty strong,"
Alford-Sullivan said. The women
"should feel good about running
up in front of those events."
The men's side is equally
stacked in the distance events.
Freshmen Brad and Brent Mauser
will run in the 5,000 meters. Sever
al will be competing in the 10,000
meters including senior Robert
Reeder, junior Greg Jimmerson
and sophomore Nathan Nutter.
Junior Jason Lunn, who posted
one of the top times in the country,
will run the 1,500 meters. Fresh
man Michael Stember will compete
in the 800 meters for the Cardinal.
Junior Jeff Allen, a Washington
native, will compete in the 400-
meter hurdles. Freshman Michael
Harte will run the 110-meter hur
dles.
Senior Jimmie Johnson is
expected to do well over the week
end. He will compete in the sprint
events as well as in the relays.
"Jimmie has been running
extremely well," Alford-Sullivan
said. "We're looking forward to big
performances from him."
