### Yi-Wyn Yen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team moved up to fifth place
after the second round of the
NCAA women's golf champi
onship yesterday.
The Cardinal took 300
strokes, four less than its open
ing round, to total 604. Four of
Stanford's five golfers improved
on their first round perfor
mances.
Arizona continues to lead the
tournament at 590. San Jose
State shot 293, the lowest of any
team in the second round, to
move into second place, two
strokes behind the defending
champion Wildcats. Arizona
State dropped to third with 597.
While top teams will be bat
tling each other for a cushy lead
going into the final round, the
Cardinal squad is determined to
remain focused on its own game.

"We're not paying attention
to the leaderboards. We're out
there fired up and focused on
ourselves," said head coach Car
oline O'Connor.
The team is aiming to shoot
even-par 288 and set itself five
strokes within the lead for the
last 18 holes.
"We usually have one player
shooting even par or better, but
so far that hasn't happened,"
O'Connor said.
She said she is "expecting bet
ter numbers" from seniors
Mhairi McKay and Andrea Bax

the top four and more than capa

third round.

scorching second-round start.

block again and with strong
winds blowing from all direc

both times on the dogleg right en
route to a 3-over 75.
"Andrea's going to approach
it with a different club. If she
gets through that hole, she'll do
great," O'Connor said.
Freshman Julie Dunn fol
lowed an opening 10-over 82
with a second round 74.
Sophomore Michelle Sperry
stands in 48th place with a 4-

over 76 that puts her at 155
through 36 holes. McKay
dropped to ninth from third
place after posting a 3-over 75
and bringing her total to 147.
Freshman Jae Jean Ro shaved a
stroke off her first round score,
firing a 4-over 76 for 153.
The team remains optimistic
about clinching top honors and is
confident it can make up a nine
stroke deficit today.
"If our players play to their
potential, there's not a team in
the country that can beat us,"
O'Connor said.
