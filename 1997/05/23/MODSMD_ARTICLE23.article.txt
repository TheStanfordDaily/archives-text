### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
One step in the right direction.
With a 12-3 victory last night over
Northeastern (33-18) at Sunken Dia
mond, the No. 6 Stanford baseball team
(40-18) is one game closer to a trip to the
College World Series in Omaha, Nebras
ka.
The No. 1 seed in the West Regional,
the Cardinal faced the No. 6 seeds in a
battle that remained close though five
innings. With a solid outing from junior
starting pitcher Kyle Peterson (10-2) and
consistent hitting, the Card turned 14
hits into 12 runs. Most importantly,
however, Stanford played solid defense,
an area that has given them troubles of
late.
"We had been sloppy lately," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "It
wiis a good effort today, and I am very
pleased with the rebound."
Sophomore Jody Gerut provided two
stellar plays in center field for the Cardi
nal. With two outs and a runner in scor
ing position, Gerut made a diving catch

of a dying line drive to end the second
inning and did the same with nobody on
in the fifth..
Senior Chris Clark also provided
heroic defense at a time when the game
was still close at 2-0. With a runner on
second, second baseman Scott Bouchie
singled to Clark in left field. Clark fielded
the biill on the run and threw a bullet
home to junior catcher Jon Schaeffer,
who placed a tag to nail right fielder Tun
Daley and end the inning, holding North
eastern scoreless.
Committing only one error and three
runs, Stanford gave Peterson a large
cushion to work with. Peterson pitched
six full innings, giving way to lefties
sophomore Tony Cogan and junior Josh
Koons. After only throwing only 78
pitches, Peterson's arm will be ready to
pitch later this weekend if needed.
"My arm feels real good, as good as it
has after a game in a while," Peterson
said. "I was happy to get out with under
80 pitches."
While Peterson was getting the job
done on the mound, the rest of the line
up was producing offensively. Stanford

got out to a slow start, as Northeastern's
starting pitcher, senior Matt McManus,
kept the Card off balance early with off
speed and breaking pitches. However, by
the second and third time through the
lineup, the Card adjusted and started to
blast the ball.
"We sat back and drove the ball as a
team, especially the third time we were
up," said sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang.
Northeastern head coach Neil
McPhee agreed about Stanford's offense.
"Our pitchers did a good job, but
Stanford's good contact hitters, one
through nine, hurt us," McPhee said.
Stanford broke the game open in the
bottom of the fifth inning, scoring four
runs to make the score 0-2. Junior Joe
Kilburg let! off the inning with a triple to
center field, only a few inches shy of
clearing the fence. Freshman right field
er Edmund Muth followed by drawing a
walk, and Hochgesang followed by
drilling a triple to center, scoring Kilburg
and Muth.
Schaeffer followed with a long
sacrifice fly to right field, scoring
Hochgesang. Freshman John Gall
singled, stole second and advanced
to third on a sacrifice grounder by
Gerut. On third, Gall coaxed the
pitcher into a balk, scoring the
fourth run of the inning. Stanford
scored three more runs in both the
bottom of the sixth and seventh
innings.
Kilburg and Hochgesang pun
ished the Husky pitchers all day,
each player one bit short of the
cycle. Kilburg drilled a double,
triple and home run, bis eighth
of the year. The home run was
the 94th of the year for the Car
dinal, breaking a school record
set in 1990. Kilburg finished
with three hits, two runs and
throe RBIs. Hochgesang went 3-
for-f) with a single, double and
triple, finishing the day with
three RBIs.
With the victory, Stanford will
face Texas A&M (39-21) at 3 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond. The Aggies,
the No. 3 seed, lost to fourth-seeded
Fresno State (38-26) yesterday 2-1
as sophomore Bulldog righty Jeff
Weaver set a new NCAA postsea
son record with 21 strikeouts in a
three-hitter. Sophomore Chad
I lutfhinson will pitch for the Cardi
nal. and sophomore Brent Hoard is
scheduled to pitch tomorrow.
In the other trame of the West

Regional, the No. 5 seed, Santa
Clara (40-18), upset the No. 2 seed,
Cal State Fullerton (38-23-1). The
Broncos face the Bulldogs in
today's late game at 7 p.m., and the
Titans and Huskies fight to avoid
elimination at 11 a.m.
Another big upset occurred in
the Midwest Regional where the
No. 6 seed, Harvard, beat top-seed
ed UCLA 7-2. Elsewhere in the
nation, USC lost 3-2 to Virginia
Tech, and Arizona State beat Flori
da International 10-2. Pacific 10
Conference champion Washington
scraped a 5-4 win over Southwest
