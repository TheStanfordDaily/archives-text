One step in the right direction.
With a 12-3 victory last night over
Northeastern (33-18) at Sunken Dia
mond, the No. 6 Stanford baseball team
(40-18) is one game closer to a trip to the
College World Series in Omaha, Nebras
ka.
The No. 1 seed in the West Regional,
the Cardinal faced the No. 6 seeds in a
battle that remained close though five
innings. With a solid outing from junior
starting pitcher Kyle Peterson (10-2) and
consistent hitting, the Card turned 14
hits into 12 runs. Most importantly,
however, Stanford played solid defense,
an area that has given them troubles of
late.
"We had been sloppy lately," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "It
wiis a good effort today, and I am very
pleased with the rebound."
Sophomore Jody Gerut provided two
stellar plays in center field for the Cardi
nal. With two outs and a runner in scor
ing position, Gerut made a diving catch

of a dying line drive to end the second
inning and did the same with nobody on
in the fifth..
Senior Chris Clark also provided
heroic defense at a time when the game
was still close at 2-0. With a runner on
second, second baseman Scott Bouchie
singled to Clark in left field. Clark fielded
the biill on the run and threw a bullet
home to junior catcher Jon Schaeffer,
who placed a tag to nail right fielder Tun
Daley and end the inning, holding North
eastern scoreless.
Committing only one error and three
runs, Stanford gave Peterson a large
cushion to work with. Peterson pitched
six full innings, giving way to lefties
sophomore Tony Cogan and junior Josh
Koons. After only throwing only 78
pitches, Peterson's arm will be ready to
pitch later this weekend if needed.
"My arm feels real good, as good as it
has after a game in a while," Peterson
said. "I was happy to get out with under
80 pitches."
While Peterson was getting the job
done on the mound, the rest of the line
up was producing offensively. Stanford

got out to a slow start, as Northeastern's
starting pitcher, senior Matt McManus,
kept the Card off balance early with off
speed and breaking pitches. However, by
the second and third time through the
lineup, the Card adjusted and started to
blast the ball.
"We sat back and drove the ball as a
team, especially the third time we were
up," said sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang.
Northeastern head coach Neil
McPhee agreed about Stanford's offense.
"Our pitchers did a good job, but
Stanford's good contact hitters, one
through nine, hurt us," McPhee said.
Stanford broke the game open in the
bottom of the fifth inning, scoring four
runs to make the score 0-2. Junior Joe
Kilburg let! off the inning with a triple to
center field, only a few inches shy of
clearing the fence. Freshman right field
er Edmund Muth followed by drawing a
walk, and Hochgesang followed by
drilling a triple to center, scoring Kilburg
and Muth.
