### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
It will be an all-freshmen final today in
the battle for the NCAA women's tennis
singles title at Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um.
Stanford freshman Lilia Osterloh
crushed Duke's Karin Miller, the top seed
in the tournament, 6-2, 6-1 to advance to
the final match.
"I played pretty good tennis today,"
Osterloh said. "I just played my game one
point at a time."
Osterloh will face freshman M. C. White
of Florida in the final. White took out Stan
ford junior Julie Scott 7-5, 6-2 to move into
the championship match.
While Osterloh hoped her teammate
would advance to the finals as well for the
first all-Stanford battle in history, now she
is just focusing on her match tomorrow.
"When it is over, I can celebrate," Oster
loh said. "All I am thinking about now is
one more to go."
Miller was quick to concede that she had
been overmatched.
"She was just better than I was today,"
she ?wid.-"I don't-know if there whs any
thing I could have done. She was just too
powerful. I did everything I could."
In the doubles division, Stanford juniors
Ania Bleszynski and Scott fell to Georgia's
Marissa Catlin and Michelle Anderson.
The Bulldogs will face Florida's 1996 dou
bles champions Stephanie Nickitas and
Dawn Buth, who knocked off Wisconsin's
Melissa Zimpher and Colleen Lucey to
advance.

the tournament, fought hard
before falling in three sets 7-6
(7-5), 2-6, 6-1. Scott came into
the match fatigued, returning to
the court just an hour after
falling in singles.
Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan thinks the finals of the
singles match will feature the
best in collegiate women's ten
nis.
Osterloh and White "are the
two hottest players right now in
the final," Brennan said. "That's
the way it should be."
Unfortunately for Stanford,
an all red and white final was
not to be.
White and Scott were neck

and-neck in the first set until a
marathon game at 5-5 when
Scott had an opportunity to
break White and go up 6-5. After
a seemingly unending sequence
of deuce-ad exchanges, Scott fal
tered first and White escaped
with a crucial win. With the
momentum behind her, White
broke Scott's serve to close out
the set 7-5.
"That first set could have
gone either way," Scott said.
"That was a pivotal game at 5-5,
and she held serve when we went
back and forth. But I still should
have held my serve at 5-6."
Continuing her roll, the sec
ond set was all White, as she
dominated, taking a 5-0 lead
before Scott finally held serve to
make it 5-1. But the resiliency
she has displayed so many times
this season couldn't save her,

and Scott fell quietly in the sec
ond set 6-2.
"She was hitting really deep,
and I just could not attack at
all," Scott said.
Brennan was quick to praise
White as well.
"M.C. played very well today;
I thought she was really impres
sive," he said.
Scott's younger teammate,
Osterloh, will seek to exact
revenge from White tomorrow.
Osterloh, who has enjoyed a
much easier road to the semifi
nal that her teammate Scott, has
breezed through her half of the
bracket.
The powerful freshman has
played tremendously, having
won every one of her matches
during the tournament in
straight sets. Over five rounds
and 10 sets, Osterloh has

dropped only 22 games. Since a
close 7-5 win in the first set of
the first round against Arizona
State's Stephanie Lansdorp,
Osterloh has not been seriously
challenged.
"I think Lilia will do a better
job tomorrow of what I couldn't
do today," Scott said. "She will
be able to mix it up more, give
[White] different stuff."
Brennan agreed that Oster
loh has a shot at the title and
that it should prove to be a good
final.
"Lilia hammered away pretty
good today," Brennan said. "She
will be pretty fresh, but they
should go out. If M.C. plays the
way she did today, it will be a
long, hard-fought battle."
The quest for the title begins
today at 4 p.m. The finals of the
doubles division follows at 6 p.m.
