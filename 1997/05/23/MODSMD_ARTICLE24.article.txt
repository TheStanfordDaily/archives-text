Stanford freshman Lilia Osterloh

in the tournament, 6-2, 6-1 to advance to
the final match.
"I played pretty good tennis today,"
Osterloh said. "I just played my game one
point at a time."
Osterloh will face freshman M. C. White

is just focusing on her match tomorrow.
"When it is over, I can celebrate," Oster
loh said. "All I am thinking about now is
one more to go."
Miller was quick to concede that she had
been overmatched.
"She was just better than I was today,"
she ?wid.-"I don't-know if there whs any
thing I could have done. She was just too
powerful. I did everything I could."

Ania Bleszynski and Scott fell to Georgia's
Marissa Catlin and Michelle Anderson.
The Bulldogs will face Florida's 1996 dou
