Stanford men's tennis players Ryan
Wolters, Paul Goldstein, Bob Bryan and Mike
Bryan are still alive but not without a tough
fight on the second day of the NCAA singles
and doubles championships at the; Los Ange
les Tennis Center yesterday.
Sophomore Wolters and junior Goldstein,
both All-Americans, fought off Oklahoma
State's Martin Dvorcek and Pavel Kudrnac in
one of the closest matches imaginable 7-fi (9-
7), 6-7(5-7), 7-6(7-3).
"It was unbelievable," Wolters said of the
marathon match. "It looked like it was over

when wo were clown 5-3 in the third. . . That
was one of the closest matches I have ever
played."
Wolters went on to play in the singles
draw, managing to advance to the third round
by cruising past Ryan Sachire of Notre Dame
6-2, 6-2. After five straight days of tennis and
five; sets yesterday, including three tie-break

rest.
"It seems like; I have been out on the court
forever last week," Wolters said.

Bryan followed suit with Wolters, advancing
to the next round of the individuals as well.

tiebreaker loss, fighting back to take out Boris
Bosnjakovic of BYU 6-7 (4-7), 6-1,6-1. In dou
bles, Bryan teamed with twin brother Mike to
handle Louisiana State's Tom Hand and
Michal Chmela in straight sets 7-5, 6-2.

ment, the more we can enjoy the team cham
pionship."

tention for the NCAA individual title, having
lost in his first round match Tuesday, he was
