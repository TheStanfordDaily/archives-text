# Season leaves team hopeful for future
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Staff writer 
As the sun sets on the Stanford men's
golf team's season, the Cardinal will bid
farewell to two graduating standouts,
knowing that prospects of next year's
success are good with many strong varsi
ty contributors returning.
Although seniors Conrad Ray and
Peter Ligotti will be missed, they will lie
succeeded by a trio freshman phenoms,
Dusty Brett, Michael Weimer and Andy
Hastings, as well as sophomore Scott
Wang. Team leader Joel Kribel will
return for his junior season also, hoping
to improve on his second-place finish in
tin; Pacific 10 Conference Championship.
As departing senior Ray said, "It's
been a good four years, but I wish I had a
couple more — in the next couple years,
this is going to be a team to reckon with."
Both as a team and as individuals, this
was a year for the golfers to step out of
the shadow of Tiger Woods and prove
themselves without a legendary talent.

Although many were impressed and sur
prised by the Cardinal's improvement
throughout the year and subsequent suc
cess in the spring, the golfers insist they
believed in themselves all along.
"We've done a lot better than people
thought we could, but we've got good
players. There's no reason we can't do
that well or even better," Weimer said.
Ray attributed the Card's success to its
work ethic.
"We always felt we could do well. It's
just too bad we couldn't have done better
and proved that we can compete without
Tiger," he said. "Hard work is the key to
being successful at anything, and we had
a lot of guys willing to work hard for the
team."
Ray also addressed the team's marked
ly higher level of success during the
spring season.
"Kntering the fall season, Joel and I
were tlx- only team members with signifi
cant varsity experience, and wo were
playing difficult tournaments,
starting with the Ping / Golf
Week Preview, which consists of
the top 15 ranked teams in the
country, he said. "By spring, the
combination of our hard work
and experience began to pay off,
especially in the case of Dusty
Brett, who was a solid No. 3
(player) for us."
Although the squad's goal for
the season was to qualify for the
West Regional tournament by
placing within the top 12 in Dis
trict 8, the golfers quickly reset
their sights on the NCAA Cham

pionships in Chicago after secur
ing an invitation to regionals by
winning the Stanford-hosted
U.S. Intercollegiate and follow
ing it up with a fourth-place fin
ish in the Pac-10 tournament.
However, the momentum
that had been built toward the
team's dream was brought to an
abrupt and grating halt last
week after a poor performance
at the regional tournament in
San Diego, Calif., in what
amounted to "one of those days
in golf."
After the Cardinal's disap
pointing finish at Regionals,
head coach Wally Goodwin put
the team's finale into perspec
tive by explaining that it wasn't
the added trip to Chicago that

was important but the chance to
make it.
"We set our sights on doing
something no one else thought
we could do — making the
NCAA championships," Good
win said. "Although it's disap
pointing to come back to Palo
Alto, we are not defeated.
"We finished the season
strong; we played our best in the
last few weeks, but most impor
tantly, we had a chance. The
only thing any athlete ever cares
about is that he had a chance —
if you get there that's an added
bonus."
If the team's regional finish
has at all affected its spirit, it
has only served to make the
returning golfers hungrier for

next year.
"We're going to be tough next
year; we're going to come back
fighting," Brett said.
Goodwin also commented
that a key ingredient in this
team's success was its mindset
and heart.
"We're a young team without
a lot of experience, but we got as
far as we did because of our good
team attitude and play," he said.
"I'm really pleased to be able to
travel with a great bunch of
guys, and I'm looking forward to
next year. With our younger
guys developing more over the
summer and a couple incoming
frosh that can really play the
game, our goals can be conserva
tively higher next year."
