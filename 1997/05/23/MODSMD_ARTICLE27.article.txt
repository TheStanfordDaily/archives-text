THE REAL REASON EMMA DIVORCED
KENNETH AND OTHER CELEBRITY DIRT
IN THIS WEEK'S INSTALLMENT OF
THE AIMEE THANATOGENOS DIARIES!
(PLUS: HO'A TO BECOME A BETTER,
MORE CARING LOVER!)

I've been very busy (his past week, try
ing to track down my mother and
resolve those Oedipal feelings that, up
t<> now. I had to displace toward a Teflon
frying pan. Imagine how hard its heen to
me to vent my anger and childhood frus
trations upon a piece of cookware, which
not only does not respond to me but
sticks to dried tomatoes and pancake hat
ter.
So I went over to confront Susan L.,
who, according to high-ranking sources
in the cast of "All My Children," is the
woman who gave birth to me. I found her
in her dressing room, drinking in the
bathtub, lint when she turned around to
face me, I realized that she bore no
resemblance to me whatsoever. Then she
took of 112 her hockey-mask. She still looked
nothing like me. Disgusted, I left Susan's
home and went back to my hotel, pretty
much resigned to a motherless life. I
spent the entire afternoon crying, wal
lowing in self-pity and enjoying the con

veniences of a full salad bar from room
service.
Being motherless or rather,
"unmothered," the politically correct
term, explained a lot about me. My
strange attraction to Vanna White, my
addiction to tootsie rolls, my problem
relating to slow cashiers at Macy's; all of
these things could somehow be traced
back to my being the daughter of a single
parent.
I was never loved by my father, by
the way. When the obstetrician first
handed me to him, he swore the baby
wasn't his. Then the doctor gave me back
to my mother, and she too swore 1 wasn't
hers.
I've tried to find consolation in the
arms of my new lover, Avatar. Avatar is a
professional lamp-shade, and we met
during a convention for flurorescent light
supplies. I'd say we have a pretty good
relationship, though sometimes he turns
himself off and refuses to talk to me. But

I love Avatar anyway; he brings light into
my life. Compared to my former lovers,
like Vasilio, who was a dusting bin (and I
mean that literally), Avatar is something
special. One of my friends says that he's
probably unfaithful to me and that she's
seen him making eyes at my alarm clock,
but I think she's just jealous 'cos her
longest relationship lasted only 2 1/2
loads. But she may be right. My fling
with Avatar will only last as long as there
is electricity. After that, who knows?
Sometimes Aimee wonders what's to
become of her. Lost in the world, without
love, self-respect or a change of under
wear, hoping to find that special someone
who will hand me the keys to his Porsche
and an American Express with an unlim
ited credit. Will Aimee ever find true
love? And why is it that the only people
offering her money are the folks at the
Publisher's Clearinghouse contest? All
this must change. Next week, Aimee will
go out and get herself some satisfaction!
