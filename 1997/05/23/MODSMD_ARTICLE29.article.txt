The Dress Spoke to Me
You've seen this dress before.
You took it off when your boss asked
you to. You put it back on when his wife
burst into the room. (Ah, memories.)
You were shockingly brash then. And
beautiful. Untameablc.
It traveled in your luggage to Moroc
co. You wore it when meeting your old
boyfriend. He said you reminded him of
his mother. You blushed.
The last time you had it on, a major
earthquake hit Japan. Coincidence? Hard
to say.
You know, time hasn't changed you
that much.
You're still an air-head. Hard to
wash. Very unpopular at the dry clean
er's. Like this dress.
Spring Dress. (Some people wear it
in the winter.) Soft. Looks great at the
office, too. Ideal for firing sassy employ
ees, for asking the boss for a raise and
for sexually harassing an intern.
Women's sizes: 2 through 20.
Color: Cosmic Orange Vaseline.

Voyeurism
She's ;» .stripper at the local club. You're an I'.nglish pro
fessor at the local University. She likes to take off her clothes
by the window of her penthouse. You like to watch her while
you wait for the microwave popcorn to get ready.
"What is the meaning of this?" you ask. Does Kant hear
you? I don't think so.
She shuts the li^ltt off. You finish your chapter. You go to
sleep, unsatisfied. You wonder If Kafka ever felt tills way.
And if so, why didn't he purchase some binoculars?
Such is the way of the world.
The next day. her boyfriend knocks on your door and
proceeds to beat the crap out of you.
What would Hegel say?
A black eye. Mow ironic.

Don't laugh, only pain
You have just escaped from a maximum security prison. You need
something to help you mingle with other civilians. There's nothing that
says Average Joe quite like this vest. This vest will vouch for your iden
tity, let you pass through airport checkout stands and security guards
won't even think to stop you.
Navy Bungamali Linen Vest (No. 123456), lined and backed in gravy,
witli extra pockets for extraneous fingers and hidden tommy guns.
Price: $555.
Men's sizes: 38 through 39.
But a man is no man without that extra something. Like this hag.
Which is not just « bag. Let's call it the bag. Manson had one. So did
Bundy. No one will think to check open this bag and find inside all those
bloody clothes and your escape plans. It's too nice. They will glance at
it and think you're Picasso. (Though Picasso didn't kill anyone. That we
know of.)
Bag with Personality (you like it, I like it).
Price: $3.

The blouse that would not stay buttoned
2 p.m.. March 10. Kroiistad Street.
Iho Hotel Nijinski. When I wake, I find Gnnther missing.
I hero is a dwarf by the window performing some obscure form
of belly-dance. I watch from the bed, fascinated. Two IRA ter
rorists burst in. They wear masks and have rifles. I scream. But
not because I'm afraid, but because I'm woman.
"I can see through that blouse," the blond one pointing the
gun at me says. Not unlike Stephen Rea.
"Well, that's why I'm wearing it."
Exactly. For those moments that reveal the deeper philo
sophical implications of dressing in the morning, there is noth
ing like the choice of a good French cuff blouse.
French-Cuff Blouse (No. 47A4H06) in cotton broadcloth, with
a wide collar and hidden pockets for guns with silencers.
Price: $279.
Women's sizes: 7 through 8.
Color: White. (So you can see through it.)
