Librarians exhibited oil paintings,
administrative associates performed
Irish dances and technicians sang a cap
pel la at a celebration of staff diversity
held yesterday among the trees of Bech
tel International Center.
The third annual Multicultural
Spring Festival, sponsored by the Office
of Multicultural Development and all
University staff groups, offered food
and entertainment to every Stanford
staff member. Provost Condoleezza
Rice was on hand to make the opening
remarks.
Multicultural Development Office
Director Sally Dickson said organizers
had expected to attract more than 800
people to the popular event.
"It's basically a staff day â€” a chance

to recognize and celebrate the diversity
of more than 5,500 nonacademic Stan
ford staff," she said
Rice echoed Dickson's sentiments in
her welcoming speech to the crowd.
"This is a time of fellowship," Rice
said. "Culture means the chance to ex
perience everyone else's culture and act
as ambassador."
Rice explained that her own back
ground as a black woman from Alabama
is as much a part of hei as her experi
ences with Russian and Palo Alto cul
ture.
"We can choose to adopt another cul
ture and embrace it," she said
Festival attendees said the overall at
titude of t lie Stanford community re
flects that most people strive for harmo
ny and willingly accept differences.
Lyn Tadena, who works in the Med
ical School and served on the festival

planning committee, said, "The atmos
phere is very vibrant You can see unity
everywhere."
Jennifer Kienitz, an accountant at
the Ginzton Laboratory on campus,
.said, "Stanford has a better atmosphere
in terms of support for staff than every
where else I've worked."
Eyeing the growing crowd of staff
members enjoying the afternoon to
gether, Dickson echoed their senti
ments hut added a qualification
"Currently, 31 percent [of the staff)
are people of color, and fifi percent are
women," she said. "About 20 years
the minority staff population was 11
percent. So numerically, yes, we now
clearly have a diverse workforce.
"Of course, issues like rate of promo
tion and retention and a wholly sup
portive environment are points where
we are still challenged," Dickson added.
