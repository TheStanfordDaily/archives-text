# NBA demonstrates respect for rules
## 
### 
I know it seems like I devote a
majority of my columns to
complaining about some
grave injustice in the sports
world.
Well not today.
Instead I am going to praise
the NBA, not because the play
offs have recently become more
interesting but for the integrity
and the consistency the front

office showed last week in doling
out suspensions to the Knicks'
Charlie Ward, Patrick Ewing,
Larry Johnson, Allan Houston
and John Starks and to the
Heat's P.J. Brown.
For those of you who didn't
see the fight that occurred in
Game 5 of the Knicks-Heat
series, you missed one of the
more bizarre scuffles in NBA
history. Late in the fourth quar
ter, after the Heat had already
put the game away, Ward (in a
dubious attempt to box out
Brown on a free throw) began to
undercut Brown, who promptly
lifted Ward into the air and
flipped him head-over-heels to
the ground.
A scuffle ensued and everyone
listed above except Brown and
Ward tried to help calm things

down. The problem for the
Knicks, though, was that Ewing,
Houston and Johnson all left the
bench to embark on their peace
keeping mission — a violation
that results in at least a one
game suspension.
Without their stars, the
Knicks floundered in Games 6
and 7 and became just the
fourth franchise in NBA history
to lose a seven-game series after
holding a 3-1 lead. Since the
debacle, Knicks fans everywhere
have been screaming bloody
murder and claiming that the
NBA robbed New York of this
year's NBA crown.
To the Knicks fans, I have
just one thing to say: Quit your
complaining — your team
sucked anyway.
However, to the NBA I say
thank you for sticking to the
rules of the game even during
the pressure of the playoffs.
There are a lot of reasons that
the NBA is so successful as an
organization, and one of those is
that the league has strong lead
ership. Say what you want about
David Stern and Rod Thorn, but
they did their jobs last week, and
they did them correctly.
I can understand that Knick
fans are upset — I would be too
if it happened to one of my
teams. But the fact remains that
all of the Knick players that left
the bench knew the rule and
knowingly broke it. Coupled
with the fact that they all said
they would do it again, I believe
Knicks fans everywhere should
let it go and the Knicks should
hire smarter players in the

future.
As noted above, I find the sus
pensions even more remarkable
because they happened during
the playoffs. Other leagues such
as the NHL, the NCAA and
Major League Baseball should
have been taking notes last week
in hopes of learning something
from the NBA's example. All
three leagues have squandered
opportunities in the not-so-dis
tant past to set the same exam
ple that the NBA set last week
— a rule is a rule.
Every sports fan should
remember baseball's most
shameful moment last year
when Roberto Alomar spat in
John Hirschbeck's face and
insulted Hirschbeck's family
just before the start of the
American League playoffs. Such
an egregious act deserved an
immediate suspension. Howev
er, Baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig, the world's longest inter
im job holder, proved that Major
League Baseball is the circus act
many suspected by delaying Alo
mar's suspension until this sea
son. Alomar had to miss the first
week of the season — obviously
the time that is most crucial to a
ballclub's season.
The NHL also screwed up this
season, during the New York
Rangers-New Jersey Devils
series. In Game 4 of the series,
the Devils' John Mac Lean
slashed Niklaus • Sundstrom,
snapping a bone in Sundstrom's
forearm.
And what was Mac Lean's
punishment for ending Sund
strom's season, you ask? No

fine, no suspension, no penalty
at all for Mac Lean. In the past,
you had to admire Commission
er Gary Bettman for cleaning up
the game of hockey. Bettman
and the league took two giant
steps backward last week,
though, when they let Mac Lean
off the hook.
This stuff happens in the col
lege ranks, too. To no one's sur
prise the NCAA has made
another questionable call
regarding a rules violation. It
seems that the Texas Tech base
ball team awarded two extra
scholarships to its players this
season. Such a violation is pun
ishable by death in the big-time
money sports such as football
and basketball.
However, the Red Raiders
came up with a great defense —
one that makes the O.J. defense
seem trite. "We just miscount
ed," was the statement released
by the school.
The NCAA's punishment for
the Red Raiders? Texas Tech
gets to host its own regional
tournament this week in Lub
bock as the No. 1 seed. Next
thing you know the Red Raider
football team will get a Sugar
Bowl berth for buying all of the
offensive linemen brand new
cars.
"Rules are made to be bro
ken," or at least that's what
sports are beginning to teach us.
Thank goodness the NBA
stepped forth to set the right
example.
And thank goodness we don't
have to listen to Knicks fans
anymore this year.
