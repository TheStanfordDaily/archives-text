# Merger queries
## Possible impact on schools discussed

Prof. Kenneth Melmon, the Med
ical School Faculty Senate chair,
reported on the academic implica
tions of the merger between Stan
ford Health Services and UC-San
Francisco Medical Center to the
University Faculty Senate yester
day.
The senate also voted unani
mously to reauthorize the Symbol
ic Systems Program and heard an
interim report on the review of the
status and training of teaching as
sistants from the Subcommittee
on the Evaluation and Improve
ment of Teaching.
In addition, the senate's Com
mittee on Committees Chair
Robert Street, a civil engineering
professor, announced that Neuro
surgery Prof. Frances Conley will
be the next senate chair.
Although the merger will for

mally join the two medical centers,
not the medical schools, of Stan
ford and UCSF, Melmon's report
was framed under the assumption
that its efleets will extend beyond
clinical services.
Not only does the flow of funds
in the medical centers affect acade
mic programs, Melmon noted, but
"new clinical programs rest on re
sults of fundamental and applied
research.
"A cooperative attitude be
tween basic and clinical research
and medical education is integral
to the patient care process. To suc
ceed in maintaining the highest
clinical standards, the best clini
cians must take part in teaching
and research efforts, and patients
should have access to clinician-re
searchers and clinical research
protocols," he said.
