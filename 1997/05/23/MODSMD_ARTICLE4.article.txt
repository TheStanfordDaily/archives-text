# Merger queries
## Possible impact on schools discussed

Prof. Kenneth Melmon, the Med
ical School Faculty Senate chair,
reported on the academic implica
tions of the merger between Stan
ford Health Services and UC-San
Francisco Medical Center to the
University Faculty Senate yester
day.
The senate also voted unani
mously to reauthorize the Symbol
ic Systems Program and heard an
interim report on the review of the
status and training of teaching as
sistants from the Subcommittee
on the Evaluation and Improve
ment of Teaching.
In addition, the senate's Com
mittee on Committees Chair
Robert Street, a civil engineering
professor, announced that Neuro
surgery Prof. Frances Conley will
be the next senate chair.
Although the merger will for

mally join the two medical centers,
not the medical schools, of Stan
ford and UCSF, Melmon's report
was framed under the assumption
that its efleets will extend beyond
clinical services.
Not only does the flow of funds
in the medical centers affect acade
mic programs, Melmon noted, but
"new clinical programs rest on re
sults of fundamental and applied
research.
"A cooperative attitude be
tween basic and clinical research
and medical education is integral
to the patient care process. To suc
ceed in maintaining the highest
clinical standards, the best clini
cians must take part in teaching
and research efforts, and patients
should have access to clinician-re
searchers and clinical research
protocols," he said.
A review of the mission state
ments of the two medical schools
has revealed "that we are more
similar than different," Melmon
said. The recommendations on
academic implications of the merg
er for both institutions will, there
fore, appear in a single final report
from a joint committee.
This report will outline the at
tributes of programs that should
be created or preserved, the possi
bilities for collaborations between
the two schools and the implemen
tation of the committee's recom
mendations.
According to Melmon, the
merger will help facilitate coopera
tion among academic medical prac
titioners at Stanford and UCSF.
"The barriers have definitely
fallen," he said, outlining areas
where collaboration between the
schools can prove beneficial, in
cluding combined residencies in
"small but important subspecial
ties" and large mandatory courses.
Developmental Biology Prof.
Lucille Shapiro echoed Melmon's
optimism "from the trenches" of
medical research. She said the two
schools "have deep mutual respect
for one another."
Financial concerns slightly
dampened enthusiasm about the
merger.
If the merger fails in the health
care market, Applied Physics Prof.
Steven Chu asked, will Stanford
join UCSF in filing for bankruptcy.
"Appropriate unwind provi
sions are in the affiliation agree
ment," Medical School Dean Eu

gene Bauer assured the senate.
Both institutions will assert they
are not willing to take each other
into bankruptcy court.
Turning to the questions of TA
training, Psychology Prof. Russell
Fernald told the senate that the
legislation on the subject currently
in place has few oversight provi
sions.
Senate resolutions issued in
1989 and 1991 outline the respon
sibilities of faculty members and
departments associated with using
TAs.
Expecting to introduce recom
mendations for oversight mecha
nisms in the fall, Fernald sought
input from the senate.
Fernald's subcommittee is con
ducting its work in response to a
resolution passed by the ASSU
Senate last year. The legislation
was sponsored by graduate senator
Douglas Natelson, who currently
serves as a student representative
to the Faculty Senate.
Economics Prof. John Taylor
urged Fernald to stay away from
"one size fits all" solutions, to rec
ognize the differences between de
partments and to look for "inde
pendence and accountability" from
departments.
Calling the numbers of depart
ments offering TA training "dis
mal," English Prof. John Bender
proposed reduced funding for the
departments that fail to provide
training.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Judith Goldstein suggested that
evaluations of those TAs who re
ceived training and those who did
not be used to assess the value of
mandatory training.
