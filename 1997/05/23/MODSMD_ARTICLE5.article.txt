llanaroh is the Korean word
for unity and is the theme of to
morrow's North Korea famine re
lief event.
Two groups — the Korean
American Student Association
and I Iwimori, the Korean cultural
group, are co-sponsoring the event
at 8 p.m. at Kicker Dining Hall.
The activity has a dual purpose: to
raise awareness about the famine
and to garner support for Korean
studies and culture at Stanford.
Kwonjune Seung, a medical
student and llwimori member,
said the event will combine cul
tural concerns and political
awareness.
"We hope to raise awareness
about the national movement of
Korean-American students to
work 011 the issue of reunification

of North and South Korea," he
said.
North Korea has been hit hard
in the past two years; devastating
Hoods have wiped out much of the
agriculture. The country lacks 1 lie
financial resources to deal with
the situation — sanctions im
posed by other countries have
greatly harmed the economy. The
situation has now reached a crisis
level.
Although the United States re
cently agreed to contribute $25
million toward the relief effort,
that hasn't been enough. Dona
tions to the food relief program are
so few that the United Nations'
World Food Program out
more food in a week to Rwanda
and Zaire than it has allocated to
North Korea in the past two years,
