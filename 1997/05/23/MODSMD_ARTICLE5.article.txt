# Event aims to target famine in North Korea

llanaroh is the Korean word
for unity and is the theme of to
morrow's North Korea famine re
lief event.
Two groups — the Korean
American Student Association
and I Iwimori, the Korean cultural
group, are co-sponsoring the event
at 8 p.m. at Kicker Dining Hall.
The activity has a dual purpose: to
raise awareness about the famine
and to garner support for Korean
studies and culture at Stanford.
Kwonjune Seung, a medical
student and llwimori member,
said the event will combine cul
tural concerns and political
awareness.
"We hope to raise awareness
about the national movement of
Korean-American students to
work 011 the issue of reunification

of North and South Korea," he
said.
North Korea has been hit hard
in the past two years; devastating
Hoods have wiped out much of the
agriculture. The country lacks 1 lie
financial resources to deal with
the situation — sanctions im
posed by other countries have
greatly harmed the economy. The
situation has now reached a crisis
level.
Although the United States re
cently agreed to contribute $25
million toward the relief effort,
that hasn't been enough. Dona
tions to the food relief program are
so few that the United Nations'
World Food Program out
more food in a week to Rwanda
and Zaire than it has allocated to
North Korea in the past two years,
according to a fact sheet provided
by the Campaign to Stop Famine
in North Korea.
The North Korean government
gives each person 100 grams of
food each day. This is equivalent to
half a bowl of rice and one-sixth
the ration usually distributed in
crisis situations. Many countries
hesitate to send aid because of
North Korea's Communist poli
tics. However, without aid, the
country's food supplies are expect
ed to run out and starvation levels
are expected to skyrocket by this
summer.
All of the proceeds from tomor
row's event will be directed toward
aid for victims of the famine. Stu
dents who attend the event will
also have the opportunity to sign
letters urging U.S. officials to put
aside political concerns and send

more aid to North Korea.
The event will also feature cul
tural performances and a skit that
emphasizes the need to put aside
political considerations in favor of
humanitarian concerns.
Organizers of the event hope to
raise awareness about the impor
tance of Korean studies and cul
ture at Stanford. Stanford does
not have an extensive Korean
studies curriculum.
"I was disappointed at the lack
of classes in Korean history and
culture," said Minhee Cho, a
freshman member of Hwimori.
Paul Lee, a sophomore and the
issues chair of the Korean Ameri
can Student Association, hopes
the event will bring together more
than just Korean students in the
spirit of hanaroh.
"I hope that both Korean and
non-Korean students will attend
Saturday's event," said Lee. "This
issue is not about a particular cul
ture but affects the international
community at Stanford."
