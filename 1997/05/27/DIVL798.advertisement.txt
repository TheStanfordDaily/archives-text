I DON'T WANT OR NEED
MY BIKE AFTER SPRING QUARER
I DO WANT MY BIKE HERE
WHEN I RETURN...
RE-CYCLE IT TO A STANFORD DEPARTMENT
Stonford tan now "Re-Cycle" your unwanted bike — working or not! Bikes are repaired and returned to
service for departments to use. This lets everyone breathe easier by reducing the number of cars and trucks
used for deliveries and errands.
To Re-Cycle your bike at ANY TIME, contact the Police Special Services Unit at 723-0806 or email SSU Manager
Dan Smith < dansmith@leland >, On Thursday, June 12th and Monday, June 16th, the Re-Cycle team will
accept bikes from Bam to 2pm in the Wilbur Hall parking lot at the corner of Escondido Road. Look for the
persons with red "BIKE GUARD" baseball caps.
SELL IT
The Campus Bike Shop (325-2945), The Bike Connection (424-8034), and the Cardinal Bike Shop (328-8900)
buy used bikes. You can also list bikes for sale on the bulletin board by the Tresidder Ticket Office, in the Daily,
or on the Net in the su.market newsgroup.
LET HOUSING STORE IT
Student Housing Services (725-6249) offers summer storage for belongings, the charge for bikes is $20.
Specific dates apply for storing and retrieving items — refer to closing information you receive from your
residence office.
SHIP IT, DRIVE IT, OR FLY IT HOME
Local bike shops can box and ship bikes. For example, the Campus Bike Shop will box and ship a bike via UPS
within the continental U.S. for $40 to $55 depending on distance; boxing alone costs $18.50 Bike shops also
sell affordable folding bike carriers for the back of a car.
Airlines take boxed bikes as extra-charge baggage, but several fly bikes for free if you're a member of the
League of American Bicyclists and make travel arrangements through the Sports National Reservation Center.

LET A FRIEND STORE IT AT THEIR HOME NEAR CAMPUS...
... but if you do, be sure to U-lock it to on immovable object — many bikes "walk" out of garages and
backyards every summer, never to be seen again.
BUT DON'T LOCK IT TO A RACK!!!
Because it will not be here when you get back
