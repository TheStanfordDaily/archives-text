TUES, 7PM A Nezv Approach to Domestic Violence:
A Socio-Psychological Model of Domestic Violence
Using Emerson's Powerdependence Theory
Advisors: Elisa Bienenstock, Sociology; Cecilia Ridgeway, Sociology
Many activists and researchers have attempted to answer the question, why do
men beat their wives? However, the problem, as well as the solution, is far more
complex than this simple question implies. This research project proposes an
alternative way of understanding and analyzing the progression of the dynamics
involved in abusive romantic relationships.
MAY 28, 1997 MICHAEL PUTNAM, Science, Technology and Society
WED, 7PM Computerization, Human Rights Advocacy and Organizational
Change: A Case Study of the Czech Helsinki Committee
Advisors: Robert McGinn, Industrial Engineering/STS
Jackie Schmidt-Posner, Haas Center
Computers and telecommunications are rapidly changing the face of the world
we live in and revolutionizing organizations all around the globe. Very little
attention has been devoted to the adoption and use of computers by non-govern
mental organizations, particularly in the developing world. This project seeks to
better understand this question through a case-study of the computerization of a
human rights group in the Czech Republic, proposing a new model of technologi
cal change in organizations and making recommendations for improvement.
JUNE 2, 1997 SUSAN PERKINS, Urban Studies
MON, 7PM An Investigation of Corporate Philanthropy, the Rationale and
Decision-making Processes Behind It
Advisor: Jackie Schmidt-Posner, Haas Center
This thesis project investigates corporate philanthropy. It tries to answer three
basic questions: what is the rationale behind corporate giving? What is the
decision making process for allocating coporate funds to non-profit organiza
tions? How are corporate philanthropy programs implemented? What are the
program's basic elements?

Academic Success and the African-American Student
Advisor: Luis Fraga, Political Science
So much of the research conducted on how African-American students fare in the
American educational system has focused on the "underachievement" of disad
vantaged African-American students. This project takes a different approach by
using the perspective of those African-American students who are succeeding
academically despite disadvantages. In doing this, it highlights the variables that
have contributed to their success, some of the issues and challenges they face,
and importantly, uses the high school students' voices to make recommendations
for the future.
JUNE 4, 1997 TAJ MUSTAPHA, Urban Studies
WEI), 7PM When the Streets are Better Than Home
Advisor: Len Ortolano, Civil Engineering/Urban Studies
About one million youth run away from home each year; a quarter of them will
not go back. These youth often come from chaotic and abusive homes, and
unlike many homeless families and adults, view the streets as the best living
situation they have. This thesis explores the perspective of homeless sheet youth
through inteviews with them and their services providers, and through observa
tions of their street life. The goal is to give social service workers, policy makers,
and the general public insight into this often invisible and misunderstood popula
tion.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Incarcerated Female
juvenile Delinquents
Advisors: Shirley Feldman, Human Biology
Hans Steiner, Child Psychiatry
The purpose of this research project is to assess the incidence of 'biologized'
traumas in the form of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in incarcerated
youths. PTSD includes symptoms of high distress, low self-restraint, and imma
ture defenses such as acting out. It is commonly assumed that such problematic
adustment in youths directly affects their involvement in and rehabilitation from
delinquent behavior. This current study is the first of its kind to study psycho
logical trauma in incarcerated girls.

TARA KINI, Political Science
Community Empowerment via Charter Schools:
Reexamining High School Education in East Palo Alto
Advisor: Terry Moe, Political Science, Hoover Institution
Aimed at parents, teachers, school and other community leaders, this paper
addresses the disparity in academic achievement between students from East
Palo Alto and their peers in the Sequoia Union High School District. Building on
experiences working wth students in the Ravens wood and Sequoia school
districts, I offer some explanations for this disparity and examine community
based charter schools as a tool for reform.
ALISON POST, History
From Community Control to Community Participation:
The War on Poverty in East Palo Alto
Advisors: David M. Kennedy, History; Karen Sawislak, History
I am reexamining "Community Action", a Johnson anti-poverty program under
the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, by undertaking a case study of the
program's history in East Palo Alto. My aim is to contribute both to current
policy debates and to Peninsula residents' understanding of East Palo Alto's
history.
DEREK YARBROUGH, Urban Studies
Sustaining Economic Development in Distressed Neighborhoods Through
Strengthening of Community-Based Institutions
Advisor: Luis Fraga, Political Science
Using East Palo Alto as a case-study, example, and model, I will describe a new
shift in the paradigm of local economic development and urban renewal. In low
income neighborhoods overwhelmed with economic and social problems,
successful economic development efforts better resemble "endogenous develop
ment," emphasizing the process of using and strengthening human, social, and
community capital.
Public
Service
Scholars
1996-1997
For Public Service
Scholars, service is not
about choosing
community involve
ment instead of
academic work.
'' ' i
Rather, the direction
and effort of the
Public Service Schol
ars Program is re
flected in its thematic
focus, "Research as a
Form of Public
Service"/ This means
that research and
scholarship are
applied to serve
specific community
needs or the general
public interest.
