# It's a Draw
## More students enter Draw, more end up unassigned 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The results of the 1997 Under
graduate Housing Draw are in,
and the numbers reveal a poten
tially worrisome trend: It is be
coming increasingly difficult to get
a University housing assignment.
Both the number of undergrad
uates entering the Draw and the
number of unassigned students
increased from last year, the for
mer up from 3,967 to 4,042 and
the latter up from 131 to 231. The
last male student to be assigned
went from 2,930 last year to 2,682
this year, and the number of the
last female assigned went from
2,960 to 2,786.
Kathleen Bransfield, a housing
assignment services manager,
cited the rising cost of off-campus
housing as the main reason for the
increase in University demand.
"It's really due to the outside
housing market, which is very
tight," she said.
The 231 unassigned students
are all still guaranteed University
housing, she stressed. "This sum
mer will be a challenge for us to
come up with housing for all those
people," she said.

Among those who were as
signed, housing preferences shift
ed slightly from last year.
Bob drew at 146 for women this
year, up from 208 last year, but the
increase wasn't enough to retain
its ranking as most in-demand
dorm. That designation now be
longs to the ethnic half of Muwek
ma-tah-ruk, the Native American
theme house, which was filled by

the group drawing No. 2.
Bransfield said the Muwekma
situation is a case of Draw statis
tics not telling a complete story.
The half of the dormitory that is
reserved for Native American stu
dents, she explained, was nearly
filled by students with priority in
the house, who are given prefer
ence over nonpriority students re
gardless of draw number. The

group that drew number two,
which did not have priority, filled
the few remaining spaces in the
ethnic half of the house.
Rounding out the top five
women's residences were Xanadu
(250), the non-ethnic half of
Muwekma (328) and Synergy
(391).
