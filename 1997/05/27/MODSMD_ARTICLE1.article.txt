# It's a Draw
## More students enter Draw, more end up unassigned 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The results of the 1997 Under
graduate Housing Draw are in,
and the numbers reveal a poten
tially worrisome trend: It is be
coming increasingly difficult to get
a University housing assignment.
Both the number of undergrad
uates entering the Draw and the
number of unassigned students
increased from last year, the for
mer up from 3,967 to 4,042 and
the latter up from 131 to 231. The
last male student to be assigned
went from 2,930 last year to 2,682
this year, and the number of the
last female assigned went from
2,960 to 2,786.
Kathleen Bransfield, a housing
assignment services manager,
cited the rising cost of off-campus
housing as the main reason for the
increase in University demand.
"It's really due to the outside
housing market, which is very
tight," she said.
The 231 unassigned students
are all still guaranteed University
housing, she stressed. "This sum
mer will be a challenge for us to
come up with housing for all those
people," she said.

Among those who were as
signed, housing preferences shift
ed slightly from last year.
Bob drew at 146 for women this
year, up from 208 last year, but the
increase wasn't enough to retain
its ranking as most in-demand
dorm. That designation now be
longs to the ethnic half of Muwek
ma-tah-ruk, the Native American
theme house, which was filled by

the group drawing No. 2.
Bransfield said the Muwekma
situation is a case of Draw statis
tics not telling a complete story.
The half of the dormitory that is
reserved for Native American stu
dents, she explained, was nearly
filled by students with priority in
the house, who are given prefer
ence over nonpriority students re
gardless of draw number. The

group that drew number two,
which did not have priority, filled
the few remaining spaces in the
ethnic half of the house.
Rounding out the top five
women's residences were Xanadu
(250), the non-ethnic half of
Muwekma (328) and Synergy
(391).

On the men's side, Bob drew
169 this year, down from 39 last
year. Granada jumped from 419
last year to 123 to replace it in the
top spot. Completing the men's
top five were Storey (229), Xanadu
(286) and 553 Mayfield (436).
The ethnic half of Okada was
the lowest-drawing dorm, coming
in at 2,786 for women. It was fol
lowed by Cedro (2,771), the non
ethnic half of Okada (2,758),
Naranja (2,738) and the focus half
of Lantana (2,725). The bottom
five for men were Slavinskii Dom
(2,682), Cedro (2,671), the focus
half of Robinson (2,608), the non
ethnic half of Okada (2,529) and

Roble and Ujamaa (tied at 2,451).
As usual, the Draw had its win
ners and losers. Among the win
ners was an eight-person group of
freshmen from Branner and Kim
ball that drew No. 13, landing the
co-ed group in Kimball.
Group member Mike Amesqui
ta was "ecstatic" about the news,
which he learned just after 9 a.m.
Saturday. The good fortune was
not without its cost, however. "I
was bit in the eyebrow during the
(ensuing) celebration," he said. "It
was so exciting, I didn't really feel
the pain until afterwards."
Sophomore Paul Bodnar did
not fare as well, drawing at 2,693
— 10 spots below the cutoff for
men to be assigned to housing.
Ironically, Bodnar is a member of
University President Gerhard
Casper's task force to re-examine

the Draw, which will issue recom
mendations later this year on how
to restructure the lottery.
"The news comes at an appro
priate time for our committee,"
Bodnar said. "It gives the commit
tee some impetus to look at things
very carefully."
In the graduate lottery, hous
ing applications also increased.
This year, 2,975 single graduates
applied for housing, with 2,386 as
signed. An additional 560 gradu
ate couples without children ap
plied, with 450 assigned. All 350
couples with children who applied
for housing were assigned.
The construction of two new
graduate housing facilities, which
will be made available for resi
dence next year, enabled more
graduate students to be assigned
this year.
