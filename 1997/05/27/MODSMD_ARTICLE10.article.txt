Indy 500 rained out
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis 500, rained out Sun
day, was halted again yesterday by more showers after just 15 laps.
Tony Stewart, last year's rookie of the year, was in the lead, less
than a second ahead of pole-starter Arie Luyendyk, when light rain
brought out the red flag, sending the cars back to the pits in the order
they were running.
An hour later, the cars were allowed to go back to the Gasoline
Alley garages. A fleet of speedway trucks tried to dry off the track

even though the rain continued.
The race began 14 minutes late because of a crash on the pace lap
involving Stephan Gregoire and rookies AfTonso Giaffone and Kenny
Brack. No one was hurt.
