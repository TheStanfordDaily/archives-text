# Allies, Russia clinch deal
## Moscow will have voice in NATO affairs but no vote 
### 
PARIS (AP) — President Clinton and his NATO
allies are set to clinch a historic deal with the Rus
sians: an accord that will draw them closer together
even as the Western alliance expands onto Moscow's
former turf.
The agreement to be signed here today concluded
4 1/2 months of tough bargaining by NATO Secre
tary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
The Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooper
ation and Security between NATO and the Russian
Federation gives Moscow a consultative voice in
NATO affairs — but no vote — and sets out new
areas of cooperation and the West's future military
intentions.
Yet as Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton
and leaders of the other 15 allies gather in Flysee
Palace to formally approve the accord, interpreta
tions of its meaning vary.
Russia continues to call NATO expansion plans
"a strategic mistake," and Moscow has asserted that
any attempt to expand into former Soviet republics,
such as the Baltic states, is unacceptable.
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all for
mer Warsaw Pact nations, are likely to be invited to
join NATO when the alliance meets July 8 and 9 in
Madrid, Spain. Romania and Slovenia also have
been mentioned frequently as candidates.
New members must be approved by the parlia
ments of all 16 current members. The process is
expected to take about two years. Further expansion
may come later.
The NATO-Russia agreement is aimed at easing
Moscow's fears about the Western alliance's growth
toward Russian borders. From the NATO point of
view, the allies say the European security structure
of the future has to include Russia.
"What we're trying to do is to create a world
where the barking dogs of the 20th century don't
yelp in the 21st," Clinton said about the agreement.

"We all have to define our greatness in the future
in ways that do not entail the necessity of dominat
ing our neighbors."
Yeltsin, under pressure from nationalists at
home, has insisted to his parliament and public t hat
NATO made major concessions, giving a clear
promise it would not move nuclear weapons onto
the territory of new members nor station new
troops there.
The document, however, only repeats earlier
NATO statements that it has "no intention, no rea
son and no plan" to change its current nuclear strat
egy and that it has "no need to deploy substantial
combat forces" into new member countries.
The agreement does create a new NATO-Russia
Permanent Joint Council where the Russians can be
consulted on NATO matters.
Nothing, however, precludes NATO from chang
ing its nuclear or troops strategy if the situation
requires it or to take into account what the Russians
may say in consultations.
"The negative consequences of NATO's enlarge
ment will be reduced to the minimum," Yelstin told
the Itar-Tass news agency before departing for
Paris. "At the same time, we are not sliding down to
confrontation, which would inevitably involve large
spending on armaments and new militarization ol
political thinking."
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
insisted the document is open to interpretation.
"The signing of the agreement is not the end but
the beginning of its life," he said. "It begins the
struggle over its interpretation."
The document also sets out wide areas for coop
eration and joint action, such as peacekeeping,
nuclear safety, defense policy and arms control.
French President Jacques Chirac will open the
signing ceremony at the Klysee Palace, followed by
speeches from Yeltsin, Solana and the leaders of
NATO member countries.
