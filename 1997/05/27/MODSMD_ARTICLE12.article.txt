FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) â€” Mutinous
troops roamed the deserted streets of Sierra Leone's
capital yesterday in vehicles stolen from civilians
and aid agencies after taking power in a military
coup that sent the elected president fleeing the
country.
It was the third coup in five years in the West
African nation, unseating President Ahmed Tejan
Kahhah after his February 1996 election ended five
years of military rule.
(J.S. officials called on coup leaders to return
power to the West African nation's elected govern
ment.
"The United States condemns the coup, which
overthrew Sierra Leone's first democratically elect
ed government in three decades, and calls on those
claiming power in Freetown to return authority
promptly to the country's elected leadership and
parliament," State Department spokesman John
Dinger said in a statement yesterday.
Sunday's takeover hy lower-ranking troops in the
Sierra Leone army left at least 15 people dead and
40 injured. The center of the capital, Freetown, was
ravaged hy fighting, looting and arson, and major
government buildings still smoldered yesterday.
Kabbah and some of his ministers fled the coun
try. News media in neighboring Guinea said Kabbah
took refuge there Sunday.
Maj. Johnny Paul Koroma led the military upris
ing, claiming that Kabbah's government failed to
deliver the peace promised in a 6-month-old treaty
that ended the nation's five-year civil war.

The civil war killed at least 1 (),()()() people and left
nearly a third of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million people
homeless.
Koroma accused the ousted government of being
"nurtured on tribal and sectional conflict."
Soldiers gave a variety of reasons for seizing
power, faulting the civilian government for every
thing from renewed violence by rebels to the intro
duction of legislation that journalists saw as an
attempt to muzzle the press.
"Our intention is not selfishly motivated. It has
to do with issues of the state," one of the coup's
spokesmen, Capt. Paul Thomas, said on national
radio.
"In order to ensure the smooth running of the
state, we are asking all government employees... to
report for duty," Thomas said. "The welfare of our
people is paramount."
Hut civilians mostly stayed home and off the
streets yesterday. Soldiers moved around the other
wise empty city in commandeered vehicles, carrying
rocket-propelled grenades, AK-47s and submachine
guns, occasionally firing their weapons into the air.
Soldiers started their takeover with a dawn raid
Sunday on a Freetown prison that held conspirators
in previous coup attempts, then seized control of the
legislature and burned the national treasury build
ing.
There was fierce fighting between the mutineers
and Nigerian troops, who bad been stationed in th<
capital to defend the government against rebe
attacks.
