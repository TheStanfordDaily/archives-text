Student responsibility
and freedom remain in
revised alcohol policy

STANFORD STUDENTS CAN
breathe a collective sigh of
relief at the Alcohol Task
Force's preliminary report.
Looking at the report — a report
that took more than a year to com
plete — it seems little will change.
The feared crackdown on underage
drinking that many thought the
task force would recommend did not
appear; the report does not mention
any new kind of disciplinary proce
dure for punishing use of alcohol or
drugs.
Yet exactly what the 30-page
report does recommend remains
extremely vague. True, Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
explained that the current report is
only a draft and said she hopes to
obtain feedback from students
before putting together the final
version. So, before the final draft is
completed, it would be a good idea to
take a close look at the report and
try to figure out exactly what, if
anything, it is tiying to say.
Although the report does empha
size the role of residence staff in
advising students about alcohol con
sumption and supporting students
with substance abuse problems, it
does not recommend turning resi
dent assistants into a police force
whose sole purpose is to catch
underage drinkers. And that, decid
edly, is a good thing.
It's extremely important that
students feel they can go to their
RAs with problems and they can
trust them. To saddle RAs with the
responsibility of punishing their
residents for underage drinking
would jeopardize that relationship.
It's assuring that the revised policy
still places great emphasis on the
RA-student bond.
The report also deals with issues
of clarification. Psychology Prof.

Ewart Thomas, the committee's
chair, explained that he hopes clari
fying the policy's rules will encour
age students to follow them.
As such, the report stresses that
all-freshmen residences are prohib
ited from using dorm funds to buy
alcohol. The report also suggests
that dorms use a secret ballot when
voting on whether to allocate their
house funds for the purchase of
alcohol. Such recommendations are
helpful but, nevertheless, nothing
new.
Moreover, the report recom
mends the creation of an oversight
committee that would coordinate
prevention programs, increase
opportunities to learn about drugs
and alcohol during Orientation and
look into the possibility of creating a
substance-free dorm. While the idea
of a substance-free dorm may be
alarming to some, it does not repre
sent any kind of a change to the
existing alcohol policy and therefore
does not affect those students who
choose to drink.
However, the report does offer
something new. It proposes adding
the following text to the existing
policy: "Stanford is committed to an
organizational approach that rea
sonably accommodates the treat
ment of such illnesses while not cre
ating undue hardship on the Uni
versity." A "treatment" clause is
something the old policy sorely
missed.
Yet exactly what this statement is
saying is a little hard to figure out.
Will the University actually insti
tute treatment programs or will it
merely assist students in finding
help for their drug problems? Will
the residence staff take an active
role in treatment or will that
responsibility be left to "profession
als?" The ambiguity of the "treat
ment" clause makes it, in fact,
meaningless and needs, ironically,
clarification.
Wading through the vague lan
guage can prove challenging at first,
but as it stands now, students need
not fear. The alcohol policy is still the
same, or at least that's how we see it.
