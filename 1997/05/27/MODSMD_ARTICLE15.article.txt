'Terrible 9 housing policy leaves graduates on their own

LAST WEEKEND, WHILE under
graduates were scrambling for
vacant computers to find out which
on-campus housing they would be given
next year, graduate students were likewise
scrambling to find out if they would be
given campus housing next year. I was one
of the lucky ones, but 589 singles students
and 110 couples were not so lucky.
Last year, only 237 people were turned
away, so Housing Assignment Services
predicted this year's opening of 400-some
new units would result in extra space.
This opt imism resulted from a refusal
to acknowledge that people were not
applying for housing because they
thought their chances were low. This
year's results conclusively demonstrate
that the housing supply comes nowhere
close to demand.
The sad results this year were not

entirely due to increased application rates
by single students. Due to outdated poli
cies in Escondido Village, students with
children are guaranteed housing, and 51
more such students received housing in
there this year over last year.
I agree that people supporting children
on student incomes should be guaranteed
housing. But in many families, only one
spouse is a student while the other is
earning an engineer's salary. Housing
guarantees should be need-based, and
families with $70,000 incomes do not
need Escondido housing. For every family
who receives a two- or three-bedroom
apartment, two or three single students
are tossed out into the voracious Falo
Alto housing market.
Meanwhile, thousands of postdoctoral
fellows at Stanford, whose salaries barely
exceed those of graduate students, can't

even enter the lotteries.
To live off campus is to choose
between hour-long commutes and $600-
per-month single rooms in other people's
houses. My income as a science student
might be able to sustain that if I gave up
my car and my plane trips home, but I
can't imagine that the incomes of human
ities students and others can support
either lifestyle. If Stanford ignores this
terrible situation, it is doomed to lose
many graduate students, both current
and future, to schools that better provide
for their students.
Stanford would point out that building
more housing is not the answer because
housing markets fluctuate. Ten years ago
housing was affordable, and in the five
years it would take to build more housing
on campus, the market may swing back
to the realm of the reasonable. Although

I sincerely doubt this — Silicon Valley is
here to stay — another, more immediate
solution is entirely within Stanford's
grasp.
Stanford should purchase apartment
complexes in Palo Alto and surrounding
communities and rent them to Universi
ty-affiliated individuals at sub-market
rates. The University would not make a
profit from this venture but might con
serve its ability to attract excellent gradu
ate and postdoctoral students — an abili
ty that will be jeopardized if trends con
tinue.
You, like me, may have been one of the
lucky ones this year. But will your luck
hold in 1998? Please write to University
officials urging more satisfactory reme
dies for the current situation.
