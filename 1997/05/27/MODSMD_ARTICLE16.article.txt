# No rooms available for mixed-sex grad couples
## 
### 
First, the good news: My wife and I —
both Stanford doctoral students — drew
170 out of 700 in the housing lottery for
couples without children. Now, the bad
news: There are only eight two-bedroom
apartments for couples without children,
and we did not get one.
Because we chose not to live a third
year in our zero-bedroom apartment
(nominally a one-bedroom, but it's one
large room — the only door in the apart
ment is the bathroom door), we must
now live off campus. Had we not been
prohibited by our marital status from
applying for liains and Escondido Village

two-bedroom apartments, we would
have gotten one based on drawing a
number in the top quartile.
Since fall 1995, we have lived in a
zero-bedroom apartment where any
sound carries throughout the apart
ment. When we work late or get up
early, we wake each other up. We watch
TV and listen to music with headphones.
After (wo years of frustration and need
ing to complete our dissertations next
year, we applied only for the two-bed
room apartments.
The injustice here is that we are not
allowed to apply for the huge numbers of
two-bedroom apartments in Rains and
Escondido even though we are both
Stanford doctoral students.
Technically, we are being penalized for
being a heterosexual couple. Were we a

homosexual couple, we could have not
declared ourselves "domestic partners"
and applied as a group for two-bedroom
singles apartments in Rains and Escondi
do. Had we done so, we would have gotten
one based on our high lottery number.
Our complaint is not that homosexuals
are unfairly advantaged but that Stan
ford's policy of excluding mixed-sex hous
ing groups, even married Stanford stu
dents, from two-bedroom apartments in
Rains and Escondido is unfair. As Stan
ford students without children, the only
reason we are prohibited from applying
for two-bedrooms in Rains and Escondido
is that we are a heterosexual couple.
Besides, what is wrong with letting
adult students decide with whom to live
regardless of race, sex. etc.? We have
heard of mixed-sex groups of friends

who moved off campus because they
wanted to live together and would have
had to split up in order to live on cam
pus. What is wrong with them living
together on campus if they have sepa
rate bedrooms?
Stanford's housing policy leaves us
baffled. Prohibiting friends of different
sexes from living together in separate
bedrooms seems unfairly constraining.
Punishing marriage between Stanford
students by banishing married students
to one-bedroom (or zero-bedroom) apart
ments in Escondido Village seems not
only unfair but quite possibly illegal.
