## Don’t know much about. . . 
### 
HISTORY. IN FACT, even after
taking 20th-century American
history last year, I only have a
vague idea that the past 100 years have
seen a few wars and some serious social
planning. But if you ask me what my
place in history will be, I will tell you that
I learned in Great Works that I will
achieve immortality by having children.
I don't know much about mathemat
ics either. In fact, I almost flunked Math
43. I still have trouble getting my hands
around a vector, not to mention solving a
Lagrangian, but I have passed countless
nights trying to understand the scope
and dimension of the number of stars in
the sky.
Don't know much about the humani
ties. In fact, I couldn't even tell you the
difference between a Monet and a
Mamet. But I have seen overwhelming
beauty in a passerby's face, and I have
witnessed stirring drama in the lives of
my friends.
I suppose you might wonder about the
value of my Stanford education. I'm a
senior now, and you'd think that I would
have gained the well-rounded knowledge
that all the admissions brochures laud.
You'd hope that, with a price tag of
$130,000 and counting, I might be able to
display or quantify how well the Stanford
professors have taught me.
Yet if you ask me to quote Kant, I
can't, and I'd rather drink hemlock than
try to summarize Socrates, but I have

found more passion and inspiration in
the people of heaven and earth than I
dream that I could find in either of their
philosophies.
I have yet to read a Shakespearean
comedy, but I have laughed hard enough
to spew food across the dinner table on a
nightly basis.
When it comes to the New Testament,
I am borderline illiterate, and in terms of
the Koran, Torah and Book of Mormon, I
am equally ignorant. But I have found
religion in the arms of a woman and spir
ituality through the embrace of a friend.
I have watched the sun rise over Half
Dome and set over Lake Lag, but I can't
explain why it only looks so beautiful
twice a day.
I can't tell you what the difference is
between a Baroque fugue and a classical
concerto, but I know that my roommate's
occasional impassioned but tone deaf
solos cannot be defined as music.
I have forgotten the name of my AA,
and I've never used the CPPC, but I have
done far better and gained personal
advice from an energy guru named Gil.
I'm a failure at literary criticism, and
I'll never write an honors thesis, but once
or twice, I was able to write a few words
in this newspaper that made somebody I
know laugh or reflect.
I have forgotten three-quarters of my
academic reading (which was only one
half of the reading I should have done)
and I doubt that there is one final from a

past class that I could pass today.
In three weeks, I will graduate from
this esteemed university without any
awards or Greek letters to distinguish me.
I suppose I could content myself with the
advice given to all of us outside the fields
of electrical engineering and computer
science — that we are here at Stanford to
"learn how to learn." Maybe that's true,
but I hope there's something more.
There are lessons and ideas I wish I
had learned that I still do not know, and
there are facts and opinions taught to me
that I rightly choose to forget. I have fore
gone many of the opportunities this Uni
versity could have provided to me, and I
still don't know much about the purpose
or meaning or direction of my life.
But, since freshman year, I have
learned how to live, and I have learned
how to love, and I've had a damn good
time doing it. Maybe there's something
else that I should have done with my four
years here.
Rut if there was, well, I don't know
much about that either.

Rahul Young, a senior majoring in pub
lic policy, would like to thank his best
friends in the world for doing the driving
and laughing through horrendous
Yosemite traffic so he could write this one
last column.
