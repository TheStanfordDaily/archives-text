# University quartet terminated

Efforts to reorganize the structure of
the Stanford String Quartet have come
to a halt following the decision to replace
the existing quartet with a new ensem
ble.
The quartet, which is made up of fac
ulty members, performs at recitals and
University events. The offices of the
provost and dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, along with the
Music Department, made the decision in
response to what Etchemendy termed a
breakdown in contract negotiations.
For those in the music community at
Stanford, the decision came as of a shock.
On May 16, guests attending a string

quartet concert received printed an
nouncements about the termination of
the quartet.
"Most of the people we talked to were
very surprised, [although] some were al
ready informed," said junior Tiffany
Kuo, president of the Music Students'
Association.
According to Etchemendy, the issues
behind the decision are complicated. The
quartet "started 13 years ago with people
in the employ of the University, and that
was the in-house model of the quartet,"
said Etchemendy. However, the more
common model now of the relationship of
an ensemble to a university is "an en
semble-in-residence," he said.
The in-house model of the quartet
means that universities give separate ap

pointments to individuals who are on the
faculty or otherwise in the university to
play in the quartet, whereas the ensem
ble-in-residence allows universities to
contract with the group as a single unit.
"It is absolutely essential to have an
ensemble and for them to have artistic
and personnel autonomy," Etchemendy
said.
Under the current model, the quartet
would have little flexibility if it wished to
fire a member. In the new model,
Etchemendy said he hopes the quartet
could deal with such issues without Uni
versity interference.
