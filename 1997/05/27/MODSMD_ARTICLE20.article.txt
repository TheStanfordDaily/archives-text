# Jesse Oxfeld: Right and to the left
## ‘And more, much more than this, I did it my way’ 
### 
IT WAS, I guess, sometime during a
very lengthy winter break that the
idea of writing this column first
popped into my (at that point somewhat
brain-damaged — really) mind.
I was in a car accident at the beginning
of November, and after spending a week in
the hospital, I returned home to New Jer
sey for recuperation. I didn't come back to
Stanford until the start of winter quarter
in January, and it was in a telephone con
versation during that extended vacation
with Elizabeth Goldman, who was then
soon to become The Daily's editor in chief,
that I first brought up the idea of a weekly
column.
I thought the request would immediate
ly get shot down. It didn't — probably only
because she felt she ought to humor the
convalescent.
Now, 11 columns and countless angered
readers later, I sit once again in New Jer
sey, spending this Memorial Day weekend,
like so many others, "down the shore." The
column I write while looking out at the
Atlantic will be printed in the final Tues
day Daily of the year, and I realize it will be
my last "Right and to the left."
I also realize that my final column will
only be my 12th, that I will never achieve a
columnar bar mitzvah, as it were. I don't

know why that matters, but still, the fact
that I have not produced 13 pieces of writ
ing bothers me. If only I hadn't given up
my usual space for New Staffers Night or if
only I'd found a spot for my column during
ASSU election week, I'd have reached that
number. Instead, the best I can do is regret
that I didn't.
Regrets. After writing these columns,
I've had a few. And I guess it's the yenta in
me, but, unlike Sinatra, I don't believe
there can ever be too few to mention.
There are a lot of little regrets. Of
course I regret the little typos and gram
matical errors that slipped through into
the final copy (though my father never
tires of pointing new ones out to me). And
there are some more substantial regrets I
now find myself harboring.
In no way do I regret my column about
the Defense Department's Reserve Offi
cers' Training Corps program. The point I
tried to get across, and in which I still
believe, is that it is too bad the federal gov
ernment sees fit to blackmail universities
into participating in ROTC. Stanford and
other universities should have the oppor
tunity to stand true to their beliefs —
including a belief that it is wrong to dis
criminate against Americans who happen
to be homosexual — without facing finan

rial repercussions from the federal govern
ment.
What I do regret about that piece,
though, is its plentiful and flippant asides
about military service. It is precisely
because of patriotic individuals like those
who are enrolled in the ROTG program
that pacifist individuals like myself am
choose not to fight for our country and its
interests. I appreciate the hard work and
dedication of those who volunteer to serve
in the military doubly — first, for doing it
and second, for enabling me not to. I regret
that I left the opposite impression.
I also do not regret my ultimate point in
last week's column. Despite everything I
wrote in the first four-fifths of that piece, I
ended up supporting Winston Churchill's
assertion that democracy is the worst form
of government, except for all others.
What I do regret about that column,
though, was the idea it gave some that I
find fault either with the candidate who
beat me or with the staff that elected her.
Emphatically, I do not. The point I tried to
make — and whether I did it successfully is
debatable — was that my complaint is nei
ther with the candidate nor with the elec
torate but with the system.
With all those smaller regrets out of the
way, now, to quote Sinatra again, the end

is near, and so I face the final curtain. As
that curtain falls, I realize that the big
regrets I have are those columns I put off
and put off and never wrote.
Since the start of this volume, my room
mate has been urging me to write a column
about laziness at Stanford. Lazy-American
students, he argues, are under represented
at this University, and they are not given
the respect and special consideration to
which they're entitled.
He's right, and for weeks I've been
meaning to write a column about it. After
all, there are very few of us (lazy Ameri
cans) here, and perhaps the Admissions
Office should consider some sort of affir
mative action to remedy that situation.
Certainly we should bo granted a Lazy
Community Center — probably filled with
comfortable sofas, lots of televisions and
freezers full of ice cream — where we could
all revel in our shared background of lazi
ness.
I've also been meaning since sometime
around the middle of winter quarter to
write a column about how important
movies and television can be to our educa
tion and how underused those resources
are.
The idea occurred to me one Thursday.
That morning, in section for a 19th-centu

ry American history class, "Gone with the
Wind" seemed to illustrate perfectly exam
ples of the slaveowner paternalism we
were discussing. Then, in an afternoon
World War II history section, I found
myself unable to come up with any exam
ples better than the "Marseillaise" scene in
"Casablanca" as the teaching assistant dis
cussed wartime resistance movements.
I would have enjoyed writing about the
value popular culture can add to our aca
demic experiences, and it would have been
amusing to write about the need for a spe
cial center for lazy students. There are other
topics I never touched upon but should have
— or at least would have liked to.
And I guess, actually, that Sinatra is
right — that all those regrets are too few to
mention. The one regret worth mention
ing, I now realize, is that it's ending — this
volume, this quarter, this year — and that
there's so much more I want to do.
