# New senators hoping to change ASSU image
## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The members of the newly elected ASSU Senate
have a variety of goals for their 1997-98 session, which
l>egins tonight, but they all seem to agree on one objec
tive: to shake the negative image of their predecessors.
To that effect, several of the senators have adopted
a catch phrase, according to freshman Senator John
Davi. "We want to focus on 'showing what the senate
can do for you,' " he said.
Sophomore Senator Nick Vargas agreed. "Right
now, I get a less than favorable impression of student
government from students," he said. "If I could, I'd like
to change that view."
Several of the senators characterized this year's sen
ate as a body that spent most of its time bickering over
rules. Davi stressed that one of his biggest hopes for the
new senate is that its members will work together. "I
want us to be united in our goals," he said. "It's really
easy for the senate ... to get caught up infighting."
One reason this senate might be able to cooperate is
that a large number of students either belong to or
identify themselves with Stop Monopolies on Campus,
a student activist group created to fight the Stanford
Bookstore's campus monopoly that has since grown
into a political party.
Freshman Senator Matt Pohlson, a SMOC senator,
is confident that his party will be able to change the way
the senate operates. He said the group's main goal will
be shifting the focus of the ASSU from internal affairs
of the senate to issues that affect the student body as a
whole.

He does not expect that campaign, however, to be
entirely a SMOC issue. "We're working as a team," he
said. "It's not like it's a SMOC agenda. It's just look
ing toward using the ASSU to better student ser
vices."
Under the broad heading of "student services,"
however, lie a variety of senator "pet issues." Pohlson
wants to focus on parking. Davi and freshman Senator
Tim Beard are looking at restructuring the freshman
class council. Freshman SMOC Senator Nauman
Khan hopes to continue to examine issues with the
Bookstore.
But not all pet issues fall under the student services
category. Junior Senator Aly Remtulla has been active
ly involved in the campaign to secure tenure for Asst.
Anthropology prof. Akhil Gupta, a fight he wants to
continue in the senate.
Graduate Senator Mike Slemmer, a master's candi
date in computer science, plans to deal with ASSU op
erating procedure. He first wants to eliminate Robert's
Rules, the laws of parliamentary procedure that govern
the senate. Next, he plans to lead a campaign to elimi
nate special fees in favor of a different funding system.
Some senators, like Vargas, are still unsure what
the hot issues will be. He prefers to take a wait-and-see
attitude into the new session.
Whatever the agenda, it seems that enthusiasm is
not lacking among next year's senators, all of whom
have high expectations for their ASSU tenures. "We
think that we can actually accomplish a lot through the
senate next year," Pohlson said.
The senate will meet tonight at 7in Room 190 of the
Law School.
