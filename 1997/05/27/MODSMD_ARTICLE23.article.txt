### Hillary Stamm Staff writer 
In the finals of the NCAA men's
'"individual and doubles tourna
ments this weekend at UCLA,
UNLV came out on top, taking
home both the individual and dou
bles titles.
The weekend belonged to
UNLV in both the singles and dou
bles divisions. In a 6-4, 6-3 win
over USC's George Bastl, UNLV's
Luke Smith captured the first
ever individual title for the Run
nin' Rebels. In the doubles divi
sion, Smith teamed up with Tim

Blenkiron to take home the dou
bles title as well, outplaying USC's
Bastl and Kyle Spencer 6-4, 6-4.
While Stanford captured the
team championship last weekend
in its 4-0 rout of Georgia, the Car
dinal did not fare as well in indi
vidual competition. In the doubles,
the 41st-ranked team of junior
Paul Goldstein and sophomore
Ryan Wolters battled its way to
the quarterfinals before falling to
20th-ranked Mitty Arnold and
Tom Blake of Harvard 7-6 (7-1), 6-
4.
The 13th-ranked Stanford
freshman duo of Bob and Mike

Bryan reached the quarterfinals as
well before falling to USC's Kyle
Spencer and George Bastl 6-3, 7-6
(7-2).
"They served well in the tie
breaker and we didn't. We had a
couple of loose points then we
were down, and you can't come
back from 2-6 in a tie-breaker,"
Mike Bryan said.
Spencer and Bastl had beaten
the Bryans in each of their three
matchups this year — twice in
dual matches during the season
and once in tournament play.
