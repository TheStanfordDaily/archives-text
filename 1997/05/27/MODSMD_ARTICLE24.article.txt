### Yi-Wyn Yen Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team ended the season without
a national title, which it badly
wanted. But for one freshman,
the NCAA Championship
proved to be the start of an
impressive college golf career.
The women's golf team fin
ished fourth at Ohio State's
par-72 Scarlet Course, tying
for its best finish ever. Fresh
man Jae Jean Ro churned out
her best performance of the
season, finishing seventh over
all with a 4-over-par 292 (77-
76-69-70) at the 72-hole golf
tournament.
The top five finishers hailed
from the West. Arizona State
captured its fourth team title
in the last five years with a
team total of 1,178, capping
the final round with 291
strokes, the best of any of the
18 teams.
San Jose State, two strokes
behind the Sun Devils at 1,180,
was second for the third year
in a row. Defending champion
Arizona came in third at 1,190.
Stanford followed one stroke
behind at 1,191, and UCLA
rounded out the top five at
1,192.
Heather Bowie of Texas
took the individual title with a
3-under-par 285 (73-73-69-70).
San Jose State's Janice Moodie
tied for second with Arizona's
Marisa Baena, last year's indi
vidual winner, at 1-under 287.
Ro tied with Bowie for the best
final two rounds of the tourna
ment.
Ro, tied for 34th after the
first two rounds, climbed into
16th place after the third
round, when she shot an all
time low 3-under-par 69. After
an even front nine, she
dropped three birdies on the

back nine.
"In the beginning, I went in
there thinking the national title
was on the line, so I had to play
I well] for the team," Ro said.
"That got me really nervous."
When she started focusing on
her own game, Ro played with
more aggression. Her epiphany
was simple â€” aim for the pin.
On the fourth round, she did
just that. She birdied the par-4

first hole, a dogleg right. With a
7-iron, she shot her ball seven
feet from the pin, positioned
behind a bunker on the back of
the green.
She also made a charge on the
371-yard third hole. With her 7-
iron, she struck the ball on the
green, which broke right to left
downhill, for a 10-foot birdie
putt.
Senior Mhairi McKay, an All-
American who won a preseason
tournament, tied for 11th with a
7-over-par 295 (72-75-74-74).
Senior Andrea Baxter, who tied
for fourth at last year's NCAAs,

finished 20th with a 9-over-par
297 (76-75-73-73).
Sophomore Michelle Sperry
placed 65th with a 22-over 310
(79-76-78-77). Freshman Julie
Dunn rounded out the team with
a 24-over-par 312, tying for 69th
(82-74-77-79).
The season ended on a bitter
sweet note for the players who
had set out to win the national
title.
"Every day we told ourselves we
were still in contention, but in the
last couple holes of the last round,
there was nothing we could do,"
110 said. "That's when it hit us."

When Stanford moved into
fourth after the third round, 10
strokes behind leader Arizona
State, the team set high goals to
shoot an H-under-par team total
on the last round.
But the team made more
bogeys than birdies on the final
round.
With two seniors nationally
ranked in the top four, hend
coach Caroline O'Connor said
the Cardinal is arguably the best
team in the country.
"We didn't play our best golf,
which made it disappointing,"
Ro said.
