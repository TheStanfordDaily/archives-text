The Stanford women's golf
team ended the season without
a national title, which it badly
wanted. But for one freshman,
the NCAA Championship
proved to be the start of an
impressive college golf career.
The women's golf team fin
ished fourth at Ohio State's
par-72 Scarlet Course, tying
for its best finish ever. Fresh
man Jae Jean Ro churned out
her best performance of the
season, finishing seventh over
all with a 4-over-par 292 (77-
76-69-70) at the 72-hole golf
tournament.
The top five finishers hailed
from the West. Arizona State
captured its fourth team title
in the last five years with a
team total of 1,178, capping
the final round with 291
strokes, the best of any of the
18 teams.
San Jose State, two strokes
behind the Sun Devils at 1,180,
was second for the third year
in a row. Defending champion
Arizona came in third at 1,190.
Stanford followed one stroke
behind at 1,191, and UCLA
rounded out the top five at
1,192.
Heather Bowie of Texas
took the individual title with a
3-under-par 285 (73-73-69-70).
San Jose State's Janice Moodie
tied for second with Arizona's
Marisa Baena, last year's indi
vidual winner, at 1-under 287.
Ro tied with Bowie for the best
final two rounds of the tourna
ment.
Ro, tied for 34th after the
first two rounds, climbed into
16th place after the third
round, when she shot an all
time low 3-under-par 69. After
an even front nine, she
dropped three birdies on the
