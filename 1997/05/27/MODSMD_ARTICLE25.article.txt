# Baseball sweeps, earns trip to CWS

The Stanford baseball team (43-18)
is off to the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., after going undefeated in
four games at Sunken Diamond this
weekend to win the West Regional and
earn a trip to the series. In Omaha,
Stanford will enter a pool of eight teams
fighting to win the national title.
The Card faced off against fourth
seeded Fresno State (40-28) Sunday
afternoon in the championship game
and pulled out a 5-2 win. With victories
over sixth-seeded Northeastern, third
seeded Texas A&M and fifth-seeded
Santa Clara earlier in the regional,
Stanford needed only to win one game
(of a possible two) Sunday to earn the
World Series berth.
With a brilliant pitching perfor
mance from Stanford junior Kyle
Peterson (11-2), a balancer* offensive
attack and a flawless defensive perfor
mance, the Cardinal earned a chance to
play for the national title. Stanford
drew the No. 3 seed in Omaha and
opens the series with a 12:30 p.m. PDT
matchup Friday against sixth-seeded
Auburn.
After pitching the series opener
Thursday against Northeastern, Peter
son was throwing on two days rest. Ho
pitched an unbelievable game, going
nine innings and allowing only two runs
with nine strikeouts and no walks
against the same Bulldog squad who
struck out 17 times against him earlier
this season.
On Sunday, Peterson allowed one
run in the first and one in the second
and then shut the Bulldogs down the
rest of the game. He faced the mini

mum 23 batters over the last 7 2/3
innings.
"1 have never seen a better pitching
performance from Kyle," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "He just
would not let them score another run.
That was absolutely unbelievable on
two days rest."
As he will be entering the major
league baseball draft, this was Peter
son's last game at Sunken Diamond and
potentially his final game in a Stanford
uniform.
"This could have been my last time,"
