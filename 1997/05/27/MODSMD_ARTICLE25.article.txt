# Baseball sweeps, earns trip to CWS
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team (43-18)
is off to the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., after going undefeated in
four games at Sunken Diamond this
weekend to win the West Regional and
earn a trip to the series. In Omaha,
Stanford will enter a pool of eight teams
fighting to win the national title.
The Card faced off against fourth
seeded Fresno State (40-28) Sunday
afternoon in the championship game
and pulled out a 5-2 win. With victories
over sixth-seeded Northeastern, third
seeded Texas A&M and fifth-seeded
Santa Clara earlier in the regional,
Stanford needed only to win one game
(of a possible two) Sunday to earn the
World Series berth.
With a brilliant pitching perfor
mance from Stanford junior Kyle
Peterson (11-2), a balancer* offensive
attack and a flawless defensive perfor
mance, the Cardinal earned a chance to
play for the national title. Stanford
drew the No. 3 seed in Omaha and
opens the series with a 12:30 p.m. PDT
matchup Friday against sixth-seeded
Auburn.
After pitching the series opener
Thursday against Northeastern, Peter
son was throwing on two days rest. Ho
pitched an unbelievable game, going
nine innings and allowing only two runs
with nine strikeouts and no walks
against the same Bulldog squad who
struck out 17 times against him earlier
this season.
On Sunday, Peterson allowed one
run in the first and one in the second
and then shut the Bulldogs down the
rest of the game. He faced the mini

mum 23 batters over the last 7 2/3
innings.
"1 have never seen a better pitching
performance from Kyle," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "He just
would not let them score another run.
That was absolutely unbelievable on
two days rest."
As he will be entering the major
league baseball draft, this was Peter
son's last game at Sunken Diamond and
potentially his final game in a Stanford
uniform.
"This could have been my last time,"
Peterson said. "I went into the
game knowing that. A lot of good
things have happened at this
field, and if this is the last, this is
the way to go out. It worked out
pretty well."
Peterson simply refused to
lose all game long as he has all
season. The score remained
locked at 3-2 from the bottom of
the second inning until the bot
tom of the eighth, when the Car
dinal added two more. As Stan
ford could not push another run
across, Peterson would not let
another Bulldog cross the plate
either.
As determined as Peterson
was, the rest of the Cardinal gave
an equally vital performance.
Sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang, the West Regional
MVP, put Stanford on the board
early with a two-run homer
blasted to straightaway center
field in the bottom of the first
inning off lefty Adam Pettyjohn
(7-8), who became the only pitch
er to shut out Stanford this year
Feb. 8. The bomb was Hochge
sang's 16th of the season and sec
ond of the weekend.
After Hochgesang's drive,
freshman designated hitter John
Gall doubled down the third-base
line. Gall was the only Card with
multiple hits, going 4-for-4 in the
championship game. With Gall

on second, senior left fielder
Chris Clark bounced a ball to
shortstop Larry Rupcich, who
overthrew first base, allowing
Gall to score.
The Bulldogs came back with
one more run in the top of the
second, and the score remained
locked at 3-2 until the bottom of
the eighth. The Card hit line
drives all game long, but the hits
just couldn't seem to find the
holes. In the bottom of the eighth
inning, Stanford gave itself some
insurance.
Sophomore second baseman
Tony Schrager led off with an
infield single. After junior right
fielder Joe Kilburg (lew out to
deep center, the Bulldogs took
out Pettyjohn, who ran out of
steam after pitching on one day of
rest, and brought in Casey Rowe.
Rowe couldn't get an out, as
Hochgesang reached base on an
error and junior catcher John
Schaeffer singled to left, driving
in Schrager from third base. Gall
followed with a single up the mid
dle, scoring Hochgesang for the
fifth run of the game.
With two more insurance
runs, the Cardinal took the field
in the ninth poised for the victo
ry. Peterson allowed one hit, but
the game ended on a double play
followed by a dogpile on the
pitcher's mound.
"It was a fantastic baseball
game," Marquess said. "This was
a great pitcher's duel."

of 4,172 got its money's worth, as

did fans all weekend long.
After the 12-3 victory Thurs
day night over Northeastern, the
Cardinal beat Texas A&M 3-1 Fri
day. Sophomore Chad Hutchin
son (7-3) pitched a four-hit com
plete game, and Hochgesang led
the offense with two RBIs and a
home run.
"We played some great ball.
The defense played so well
behind me all day. Pecci and
Schrager made big plays,"
Hutchinson said. "I got out of
some really big spots unscathed.
I am peaking at the right time,
and I am in a definite groove con
fidence-wise."
In Saturday's 9-2 victory over
Santa Clara, sophomore Brent
Hoard (9-4) and Jeff Austin com
bined for a four-hitter. Hoard shut
out the Broncos for 5 1/3 innings,
and Austin allowed only one hit, a
home run to All-American Mike
Frank.
For the Cardinal, freshman
right fielder Edmund Muth hit a
two-run homer in the fifth inning
to right field, his ninth of the year.
In the top of the ninth, Stanford
earned some insurance runs with
a grand slam by Gall. Kilburg also
had three hits in the game.
Elsewhere in the nation, seven
teams earned berths to the Col
lege World Series. Battling Stan
ford for the title will be Alabama,
Louisiana State, UCLA, Miami
(Fla.), Auburn, Rice and Missis
sippi State. Only Auburn, Rice
and Stanford were undefeated in
their regionals.
