Stanford sophomore third base
man Josh I lochgesang worked some

the most valuable player of the West
Regional
Five members of the Stanford
baseball team were named to the All-

junior shortstop Jay Pecci, junior

record 21 Texas A&M batters
Thursday.
Hochgesang received the MVP
award for an outstanding offensive
show this weekend, finishing with
a .500 batting average, eight hits,
five runs, two home runs and
seven RBIs. Hochgesang also had
one double and one triple in the
four games and played impeccable
defense.
Hochgesang said he did not
even know the tournament had an
MVP until it was announced.
"I didn't really know they had
it, so I wasn't thinking about that
at all," Hochgesang said.
Hochgesang also explained that
the individual honors are nice, but
the important thing is the trip to
the College World Series.
"I just took the attitude of,
'Someone's got to be the guy.' I

was just trying to win, and it paid
off for the team," 1 lochgesang said.
"I just thank God the hits found
the holes for me."
Pecci was named the short
stop on the all-regional team for
his outstanding defensive perfor
mance all weekend. Pecci played
absolutely (lawless defense, mak
ing nine putouts and l(> assists
without committing an error.

runs and two RBIs over the
weekend.
"Jay's play was super this week
end," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "He was so con
sistent."
Pecci walked on to the team as
an unheralded freshman three
years ago with no expectations and
simply the desire to play.
"I sure am glad he walked into
my office t hat day," Marquess said
about the day Pecci approached
him.

weekend, earning t wo of the four
wins for the Cardinal. After pick
