# Osterloh snags individual title
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Freshman Lilia Osterloh not only won an NCAA
individual title Friday afternoon at the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, but she made a major statement in
crushing Florida freshman M.C. White in a 50-
minute, straight-set win, 6-1, 6-1.
With the victory, Osterloh put the proverbial icing
on the cake that was last week's team title and put her
future at Stanford in question as she dominated oppo
nents throughout her first NCAA season.
Osterloh is the eighth Stanford player to win the
NCAA singles title and the first since Sandra Birch in
1991.
"1 guess 1 was in a zone," Osterloh said after the
match. "I just really wanted this. It was a goal of mine
the whole year, and it just came down to desire."
Osterloh jumped out to a quick start on White to
begin the title match, breaking White twice to take a
substantial 5-0 lead in the first set. After losing her
own serve to give White her first game of the match,
Osterloh responded by breaking back immediately for
a 6-1 first-set victory.
Osterloh feasted on White's serve all afternoon,
breaking White in six of her seven service games.
"The whole week, my serve has been sort of shaky,
but my opponents haven't attacked me," White said.
"Lilia took advantage of that. Lilia is the caliber of
player which takes advantage of any weakness that
you show her."
White did hold serve to stay close with Osterloh at
1-1, but Osterloh took her service game with ease as
White could not muster a point in the following game.
Osterloh broke again to go up .'{-1 as White double
faulted to lose the game. From there on out, it was all
Osterloh as the No. 8 seed closed out the title match
serving with a 5-1 lead.
In addition to breaking White's serve, Osterloh
overpowered White with her ground strokes and daz
zled the crowd with her placement.
"Once she started striking the ball just a second
quicker than me, I couldn't quite get up on the base
line like my game plan was at the beginning of the
match," White said.
While giving Osterloh credit, White did point out
that she did not play the best match of her career.
"I think I helped Lilia win this one," White said. "I
feel like I didn't play my game at all. I'll give it all to
her; she had a heck of a day and a heck of a week. Hut
I am disappointed with the way that I played today."
The dominance which Osterloh displayed in her
match with White was merely a continuation of the
performances which got her to the final. In her semi
final match, the Stanford freshman walloped Duke
freshman Karin Miller in straight sets. Miller was the
tournament's top seed and the No. 3 singles player in
the country.
Osterloh did not lose a set throughout the entire
singles draw. Outside of a 7-5 first set in the opening
round of the tournament, Osterloh did not drop more
than three games in any given set.
In presenting the championship hardware to
Osterloh, Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland said
to the freshman, "I don't know if I've seen as focused
an athlete in the time I've been at Stanford."
As for her future, Osterloh remained ambiguous as
to whether she would be returning to help the Cardi
nal defend its national championship or turning pro
fessional.
"I don't know," Osterloh said. "I am going to be
playing in pro tournaments this summer. I would like
to be back next year; I love Stanford. But I don't know
yet."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan doesn't
either.
"If she gets to the finals of the U.S. ()p«'n, we will
let her go," Brennan said. "And then she can make us
a large contribution.

"Certainly, a nat ional championship a if r ■ Oiman
is impressive. A lot of t he plavors that I have co iched
over the years and Lilia certainly fit into tin topi
or 2 percent think about their matches <Ijff« rent lv
1 ler mentality is, 'I am a better player, and I have con
fidence in myself. What I have to worry about is if 1
play well. The opponent can do whatever ,he v. mts to
do. "

Freshman Lilia Osterloh stretches to return the
ball to M.C. White at Friday's individual finals.
With victories in both the team
and the individual tournaments,
Osterloh certainly proved she is
the cream of the college tennis
crop. The freshman was as
unstoppable in the team competi
tion as she was in the individual
draw, winning all four of her
matches at the top singles spot in
straight sets.
After returning from a shoul
der injury midway though the
dual-match season, Osterloh was
assigned the top spot in the Stan
ford lineup despite the efforts of
senior Katie Schlukebir,.the top
ranked player in college tennis,

and freshman Anne Kremer, a six
time national champion from Lux
embourg.
Osterloh proved her worth at
the spot, going 17-1 for the Cardi
nal including the undefeated
stretch in the tournament and an
undefeated streak down the
stretch of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence season.
As for White, the loss in the
finals ended a remarkable run for
the Gator freshman. Unseeded in
the draw, White earned some huge
victories on her way to the finals,
including wins over second-seeded
Schlukebir and Pac-10 singles
champion Julie Scott.
"I've played well all week, and
maybe it caught up with me
today," White said. "Maybe I was
just one step off. But I have had a

great, tournament. I hit the ball
well, and I was happy about the
week."
In doubles action, Florida's
Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nicki
tas defeated Georgia's Marissa
Catlin and Michelle Anderson 6-2,
3-6, 6-2 to capture the title.
Osterloh, White, liuth, Scott,
Schlukebir and Texas' Cristina
Moros were also named to the
USTA Ail-American Summer
Team. The squad serves as an elite
training program for its partici
pants and provides a five-day
training session next month as
well as the opportunity for team
members to participate in profes
sional circuit events.
The USTA will host its own
national championship at Indiana
in August.
