### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
This week the Stanford
women's sailing team competes
at the national championships
in Portland, Ore. The event,
which began yesterday, will last
until tomorrow. The Cardinal is
facing a number of West Coast
as well as Eastern teams.
Stanford is in sixth place after
one day of competition, due
mostly to a disqualification in
the second race of the A division.
Navy leads the way with just
nine points, while Dartmouth
and Connecticut College follow
with 21 and 22 points, respec
tively. St. Mary's (Md.) and
Brown round out the top five
with Stanford two points behind.
Stanford placed third in the
first A division race and second
in the third race, while the B
division squad placed second in
its first race and ninth in the
second. B division boats did not
race a third time.
The Cardinal qualified for the
nationals by winning the district
championships, which took
place earlier this month. The
national championships are
hosted by the Intercollegiate
Yacht Racing Association
(ICYRA). This association gov
erns sailing competitions at a
variety of areas in the United
States and Canada.

Senior Alice Manard will be a
key contributor for the Cardinal.
She is currently the top female
sailor in the United States and
has been a central figure in the
overall success and status the
team has achieved this year. Her
teammates call her a great asset
to collegiate sailing.
Manard "is truly an amazing
player," said senior teammate
Kevin Pidduck. "She is one of
the best in the country."
Fellow senior Sybil Diver has
also played a crucial role in team
motivation and general training
strategies. Together, she and
Manard hope to help the team
claim victory.
Stanford has prepared long
and hard for the nationals pri
marily by running through mock
races. The Cardinal has also
focused on the individual
aspects of race improvement
techniques by improving person
al strategy and communication
between boats.
The major competition Stan
ford faces stems from the East
Coast teams which have more
developed and structured sailing
programs. Stanford is currently
ranked No. 2 behind Brown,
down from the top position a few
weeks earlier.
The 30-member women's
team can also look forward to a
promising season next year as
most of the squad will return.
