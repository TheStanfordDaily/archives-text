# Missions provide a new perspective
## Mormon students adjust after returning from their missions 
### Rito Treviño Contributing writer 
You might say that some people look up to freshman Mark
Madsen, and not just because he's nearly seven feet tall. Mad
sen, a forward for the Cardinal men's basketball team, began
his Stanford career following two years of service as a mission
ary in Spain.
Madsen is the public relations representative for the Stan
ford First Ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

Saints, also referred to as the Mormon church. This congrega
tion is composed of Stanford students as well as single adults in
the Palo Alto area.
Like Madsen, many of the students in the ward have served
in missions around the world.
"It's more than a tradition," Madsen said. "It's an opportu
nity for people to live out their desires to serve others."
He worked in Andalucia, the southernmost province of
Spain. His main objectives there were to share his religious be
liefs with others and provide services to the community.
According to Madsen, there are 309 Mormon missions loca
tions throughout the world. In many cases, missionaries must
adapt to a foreign culture. There is a two-month "training pe
riod" during which they learn new languages.
On the other hand, some missionaries are simply assigned to
serve in a part of their own country; in the United States, for ex
ample, there are missions in places like Cleveland and San
Francisco.
"It's hard to sum up two years of experiences," said fresh
man Wilfred de Guzman, who completed a mission in northern
Wales. "Your basic day runs from about 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,
every day of the year except Christmas," Guzman said.
"Every week you get about half a day off to run errands,
sightsee and do other personal things, but eventually you have
to forget about yourself completely," he added.
The Mormon missionaries come from many different back
grounds. Sophomore Chris Bowler served his mission in south
ern Italy, where he helped establish new branches of the
church, taught English and worked in a hospital.
Bowler is currently an economics major and a member of the
a capella group Everyday People.
Theo Alkousakis, also a sophomore, hails from Athens,
Greece. For his mission he went to Novosibirsk, Russia, a city
in Siberia. There he participated in cleanups and teaching pro
grams.
"Sometimes I ended up shoveling a lot of snow," Alkousakis
said. "But it's beautiful to see the change in people's lives, to see
them happier."
The church has set up guidelines for the ages of missionar
ies. It is recommended that men go at age 19, whereas women
aren't allowed to serve missions until they are 21. Thus, most
male missionaries leave after their freshman year of college,
and females go after graduation.
"A woman's missionary work is really no different from a
guy's," said Sarah Harris, graduate student.
She served a mission in Austria after graduating from
Brigham Young University. Like other missionaries, she took

part in aiding the disabled,
spreading literacy and sharing
her faith.
I larris noted that returning to
college after a mission as a gradu
ates wasn't entirely troublesome.
She had some struggles with her
academics, but she never had any
problems with age differences.
On the other hand, undergrad
uates find themselves two years
older than their academic peers.
"Most missionaries returning
lo Stanford as sophomores feel a
liil of separation because their
friends are all seniors," Bowler
said. "It's notabigdeal for me now
because I can still hang out with
1 hem. Next year will be (more)
strange because they'll all be
gone."
Madsen and de Guzman faced a
different situation at the begin
ning of the year. They both en
tered Stanford two years older
than other freshmen. However,
t hey said they have blended into
t heir class quite well.
"I'm 21, but I don't feel older
than other freshmen," Madsen
said. "The tough part was coming
back and trying to create coher
ence out of my sentences in CIV."
Senior Greg Clark, a psycholo
gy major, found that his mission
experience in central Illinois con

tributed greatly to his academic
approach.
"You see so much while you're
there that you get a different per
spective of what you want to be,"
Clark said. "You come back with a
new focus and determination."
De Guzman added, "I was actu
ally excited to get back to school
and write my first paper. It's diffi
cult to adjust when you've been
using a foreign language, but
eventually it all comes back to
you."
Some of the missionaries must
also readjust to their athletic ca
reers. For example, Clark is a
tight end for the Cardinal football

team.
"Coming back to football was
one of the hardest things I've ever
done," Clark said. "I couldn't work
out too much during my mission.
It took about a year for me to get
back to my original state."
But despite all the adjustments
that they have to make when they
return to the Farm, the Mormon
missionaries said they didn't re
gret the experience.
"For me it was the most worth
while experience from an educa
tional standpoint and a spiritual
standpoint," Clark said. "Com
pared to what I did then, college
looks like podunk."
