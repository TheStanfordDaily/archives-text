Christine Griffith, director of graduate residences,
is the winner of this year's Amy J. Blue award, an
honor conferred on Stanford staff members.
Although Griffith will be the only one to receive a
monetary prize of $1,000, four other staff members
will receive Amy awards, the University's recognition
of the efforts of non-faculty employees. They are
Susan Sebbard, fellowship administrator in the Hu
manities Center; Faye Gage-Burnett, receptionist at
the Undergraduate Advising Center; Ronald Davies,
administrator in the Drama Department; and Patri
cia Michon, benefits counselor in the Office of Total
Compensation in Human Resources.
Griffith oversees the graduate housing for nearly
5,000 people, including 3,200 students and their fam
ilies, in Escondido Village, Crothers Memorial Hall,
Crothers Hall and the Rains Houses.
She said she was especially thrilled about being
nominated by the graduate resident assistants, wit h
whom she works closely to make all students and fam
ilies "welcomed and included."
Her job in the last five years as director has in
volved her "practically 24 hours in the diverse needs
and issues of graduate students." This has also been a
period of rapid change, she said, as the graduate hous
ing program participates in the decade-long Capital
Improvement Plan.
The Amy awards were established in memory of
Amy J. Blue, a former vice president for administra
tive services and facilities who died in 1988 of brain
cancer.

"Seven years ago, when the awards were instituted,
there weren't sufficient incentives for the Stanford
staff," said Susan Schofield, the academic secretary to
the I Jniversity and committee chair for the awards.
Speaking about the key to their success, most of
the winners said they try to understand the predica
ments of the students and staff they serve.
Sebbard oversees the annual competition for the
coveted Humanities Center fellowships. This year,
the race attracted nearly 280 applications for six posi
tions. Besides overseeing the pre-screening process of
the applications, she translates the letters of recom
mendation into French and Spanish, gives advice to
applicants and facilitates the teaching assignments of
the fellows.
Gage-Burnett answers lx>tween 50 and 100 stu
dents' and parents' questions about undergraduate ad
vising everyday, concerning anything from "where to
get toothpaste to advice on academic programs." She
said she felt that the job w;us its own reward, although
she did look forward to winning the "Big Amy."
"Whoever wins that has to be an angel," she re
marked.
Davies is a Stanford alumnus and has been in his
post since 1988. He helps students and faculty write
books and dissertations and organize their perfor
mances.
Michon, who has been at Stanford for four years,
said she was surprised to receive the award, especial
ly because she considers herself "the new kid on the
block" in the list of award recipients.
"This award makes you work harder and makes
you want to live up to it," she said.
