## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Starting Sept. 1, Laura Carstensen, associate pro
fessor of psychology and a prominent scholar in the
field of life-span developmental psychology, will head
the Institute for Research on Women and Gender.
Carstensen, who was chosen from a pool of 22 appli
cants, will be the director of the institute for the next
three years.
The current director for the institute, Iris Litt, a
professor of pediatrics and specialist in adolescent med
icine at the Medical Center, said she is "extremely en
thusiastic" about Carstensen's appointment.
As director, Carstensen said she will continue study
ing adolescence, but she will extend the age span that
the institute studies to include the elderly. "I want to
stimulate research regarding life span and aging,"
Carstensen said.
Carstensen said old age is a new phenomenon for so
cieties living in this century. "Before this century, peo
ple lived only, a few decades; today, the majority of peo
ple born will live an entire life span," Carstensen said.
Although many of the elderly are frail or physically
weak, they are also "the wisest and the most experi
enced," Carstensen said. "We need to figure out as a so
ciety how to make use of the older generation."
In addition to studying the elderly, Carstensen said
research regarding the elderly woman's role in society
will also be given special attention.

"There are a lot of issues that are gendered — which
older women alone face," Carstensen said. "For exam
ple, women can expect to face an average of 15 years of
widowhood, but nobody talks about this with younger
women."
Furthermore, Carstensen said she will encourage
interdisciplinary involvement as director of the insti
tute. Experts in the fields of psychology, sociology, his
tory and economy will have to collaborate in order to
address problems facing the next generations,
Carstensen said.
"Nearly all challenges with the demographic
changes facing our society require interdisciplinary
considerations," Carstensen said.
Litt, who has served as director of the institute for
the last seven years, said Carstensen's ability to be an
effective leader with faculty, scholars and public audi
ences makes her well suited for the position.
Litt said under Carstensen's leadership, the center
has a promising future. "The institute is well-poised to
continue on its incredible trajectory," Litt said.
Although a number of qualified applicants were con
sidered, Asst. Dean of Research Carol Vonder-Linden
said Carstensen's work will "complement Litt's area of
research very well."
"Carstensen's research completes the cycle of the
life span," Vonder-Linden said. "We're delighted that
Carstensen is going to follow the footsteps that Litt put
out there. I think she's going to do some very exciting
work."
