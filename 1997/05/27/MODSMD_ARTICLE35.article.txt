# E-mail incites University to block Internet access to certain domains
## 
### Sheenie Ambardar Contributing writer 
After a member of the Stanford community received
inappropriate e-mail messages sent through a well
known technology server, University officials blocked
access to more than 25,000 Internet domains on that
server.
The domains include a host of companies and orga
nizations, from the American Association of Mental
Retardation to the AIDS Foundation Houston Inc.
The block was placed on the world's largest virtual
domain hosting server, I liway Technologies.
Officials at Stanford asked Hi way to discipline the
offending company, but according to Stephen Hansen,
a computer security officer at Stanford, "The good
folks at hiway.net have seen fit to completely ignore our
repeated requests to deal with the harassing messages
originating from their systems. Those subnets will re
main blocked until that situation changes."
As a result of the conduct of this company under
Hiway's domain, Stanford has retaliated by blocking all
of the server's domain names. Marc Spear, the doctor
al student who uncovered the block, maintains that
this effectively amounts to censorship and denies the
Stanford community access to many companies that

have not violated any code of conduct.
Spear expressed his dissatisfaction with the Univer
sity's callous handling of the situation in a letter ad
dressed to University President Gerhard Casper.
"Stanford University is not and should not attempt
to he the moral arbiter of the Internet," said Spear.
"Frankly, I feel that Stanford should never hlock access
to any Internet sites. If an individual is having prob
lems because of e-mail from a company, then that indi
vidual should employ an e-mail filter to block incoming
messages. There is no reason to block outgoing access
to the Internet under any circumstances; that consti
tutes censorship, plain and simple."
Many of the organizations whose World Wide Web
sites have been blocked are wholly unaware of their
nonexistent status on the Stanford campus, according
to Spear. He contacted two such organizations, Contin
uing Education Masters and Sundog Wilderness Vaca
tions, and informed them of the situation. He said they
were surprised to learn that they had been banned, as
neither had sent any unwanted e-mail to the Stanford
community.
Among the other organizations that cannot be ac
cessed from the Stanford campus are U.S. Cancer Care,
The Online Medical Bookstore and the American Asso
ciation of Community Theater.
