As represented hv
this issue, Arcade
has the potential
to dip into nearly
every conceivable area of
political, social and cultural
life. The cover story veers
away from Stanford, but not
so far. Alison Post sifts
through the past of Hast Palo
Alto and discloses an often

muted historical narrative. Culturally significant,
though often unknown, Minimalism and Verdi's
"AYda" assert themselves and their roles in con
temporary arts and social study in two articles by
Xavier Arreola and Benjamin Lawrance. In this
issue, recent changes in Stanford curriculum have
taken the stage as Ann Kim addresses CSRE and
ethnic studies and its place in the university, while
English Professor Robert Polhemus, C 'hair of the
CIV Commission, charts one viewpoint behind
the spirit of the CIV restructuring.
In taking up the reins of Arcade, there
came the necessary task of envisioning its pur
pose, value, and direction. Arcade's breadth
affords it many faces.l believe that each addition
al face adds to Arcade's purpose as a tool for learn
ing, both to those who might extract a kernel of
thought from an article as well as to those who
rifle through the experience of writing one.
Arcade also contains the potential to serve as a
valuable medium between the intellectual lives of
its faculty and students outside the classroom.
Continents of astonishing and meaningful dis
course exist in our faculty whose intellectual
props extend beyond the air-borne lecture and
the casual conversation. Each issue is woven as a
space in which teaching, and especially, non
teaching members of vigorous Stanford can share,
enliven, and jar us awake with their most effective
and directed writing.
In a word, Arcade is about intellectual
exposure. Of the campus. Of its community. Of
its concern for the realities around us. In my best
imagination I expect a quality exposure to local
and universal worlds laid bare. If anything, with
quality exposure comes perspective, and with per
spective comes what I believe is an ability essen
tial to every individual at Stanford - the ability to
keep it real.
