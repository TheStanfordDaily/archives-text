# A 						compromise
## Stanford and Palo Alto reach agreement on Sand Hill Road 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
After a month of closed-door
meetings, Palo Alto and Stanford
officials submitted their joint pro
posal for the Sand Hill Road Pro
ject to the Palo Alto City Council
last Thursday.
The project involves extending
Sand I lill Road to El Camino Real,
expanding the Stanford Shopping
Center and building a 628-unit
apartment complex primarily for
Stanford employees as well as a se
nior housing center on vacant land
on the border of Menlo Park and
Palo Alto. Stanford would pay for
the project, which will cost about
$1142 million.
On April 29, after two months
of deliberation, the council in
structed (he city manager to nego
tiate with Stanford to find a com
promise within the council's para
meters.
"We did not get everything we
wanted, hut we're satisfied with
the whole package," said Larry
Ilorton, Stanford director of gov
ernment and community rela
tions. "We still do not agree that
it's an optimum solution."
One of the things Stanford

fought for was the extension of
Sand Hill Road to El Carnino Real
as a four-lane road. What it got
from the city was four lanes from
Santa Cruz Avenue to Arboretum
Road and two lanes from Arbore
tum Road to El Camino Real. If the
proposal passes, Stock Farm Road,
Quarry Road, Palo Road, Pasteur
Drive and Vineyard Lane will also
receive improvements.
However, the city also had to
make some concessions. The city
agreed to allow the 120,000-
square-foot expansion of the Stan
ford Shopping Center. Originally,
the city's zoning codes limited
Stanford to adding only 65,000
square feet to the shopping center.
Stanford initially requested (he
addition of 1 (i. r >,<)()(> feet.
The current proposal prohibits
any anchor tenant — a major de
partment store — from leasing
space without t he approval of the
city council.
In addition, two partially under
ground parking structures will re
place the single existing structure
at the shopping center. The struc
tures will be no taller than 17 feet.
"It's been an extremely long
and arduous process, but we've
come out with what the city of
Palo Alto staff and Stanford think
would be beneficial to the commu
nity and beneficial to Stanford,"
Horton said.
He said that the debate on
whether to extend Sand Hill Road
to El Camino Real has been going

on for 30 years. Widening Sand
Hill Road as part of a larger pack
age called the Sand Hill Road Pro
ject has only been in the works for
the last five years.
The proposal will be considered
by the council tonight at 7 in Palo
Alto City Hall. The council could
either accept the proposal as it
stands, suggest some changes or
send the entire proposal back to
the commitee.
If it does not recommend any
changes, the council could approve

the plan as early as June 30.
Schreiber said that if the pro
posal passes, there could be the po
tential for litigation by those who
disapprove on environmental
grounds. In the past year, citizens
of Menlo Park and Palo Alto have
spoken out against the environ
mental implications the project
could ?ause including increased
traffic, ncreased water runoff into
the San Francisquito Creek and
destruction of some of the grass
lands on the west edge of campus.
