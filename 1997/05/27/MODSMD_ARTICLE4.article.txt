## Stanford and Palo Alto reach agreement on Sand Hill Road 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
After a month of closed-door
meetings, Palo Alto and Stanford
officials submitted their joint pro
posal for the Sand Hill Road Pro
ject to the Palo Alto City Council
last Thursday.
The project involves extending
Sand I lill Road to El Camino Real,
expanding the Stanford Shopping
Center and building a 628-unit
apartment complex primarily for
Stanford employees as well as a se

on the border of Menlo Park and
Palo Alto. Stanford would pay for
the project, which will cost about
$1142 million.
On April 29, after two months
of deliberation, the council in

fought for was the extension of
Sand Hill Road to El Carnino Real
as a four-lane road. What it got
from the city was four lanes from
Santa Cruz Avenue to Arboretum

proposal passes, Stock Farm Road,
Quarry Road, Palo Road, Pasteur
Drive and Vineyard Lane will also
receive improvements.
However, the city also had to
make some concessions. The city
agreed to allow the 120,000-
square-foot expansion of the Stan
ford Shopping Center. Originally,
the city's zoning codes limited
Stanford to adding only 65,000
square feet to the shopping center.
Stanford initially requested (he
addition of 1 (i. r >,<)()(> feet.
The current proposal prohibits
any anchor tenant — a major de
partment store — from leasing
space without t he approval of the
city council.
In addition, two partially under
ground parking structures will re
place the single existing structure
at the shopping center. The struc
tures will be no taller than 17 feet.
