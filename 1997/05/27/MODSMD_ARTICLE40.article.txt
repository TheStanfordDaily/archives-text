## Minimalism's 32 Years on the Beach Music that Breaks the Traditional 
### Xavier Arreola 
Last Wednesday marked the 32nd
anniversary of the debut performance
of Terry Riley's "In C." The San
Francisco premiere of this piece
marked the beginning of a style most fre
quently called minimalism. In the early years,
minimalists were only a small group of com-

posers collaborating to develop
a new musical language, work
ing together, playing each
other's music. Philip Glass, the
youngest of these early mini
malists, celebrated his sixtieth
birthday this year. The styles of
the first minimalists, La
Monte Young, Riley, Steve
Reich and Glass, although still
linked to the aesthetics they
developed together in the
19605, have diverged.
Many post-minimalist
composers have integrated
minimalist techniques into
their music. Minimalism is no
longer only an American phe
nomenon but has spread to
Europe. Although the wide
dissemination of minimalism
indicates that it is no longer a

marginal movement, in academic circles it is
still treated marginally. It is said that minimal
ism lacks rigor and is simplistic. It is often
implicitly stated that the music is boring.
There are obvious barriers to introduc
ing minimalism into an academic environ
ment. For instance, how does one begin to dis
cuss a five hour piece like Youngs "Well Tuned
Piano" in a classroom? As tempting as it is to
merely to play 30 seconds of the piece and say
that this continues for several hours, adequate
treatment is required for pieces whose value do
not follow traditional musical tenets.
Unfortunately, proper vocabulary and analyti
cal tools have not yet been standardized to help
approach these kinds of pieces.
Another problem is the lack of

resources. Glass' tight rein over the publication
of his scores prevents comprehensive study of
his work. Reich is the only one of the original
four who has allowed extensive publishing of
his music providing for its greater analysis and
performance, and so it is Reich who is most
often mentioned in the classroom.
Another barrier is the difficulty of per
forming the music. Minimalism offers the per-

former unique challenges: The music does not
require tremendous technical skill hut does
require incredible stamina and concentration.
Of course, it is rather painfully that 1
apply the term minimalism to the music of
these composers because both Glass and Reich
have expressed their disappointment over the
widespread use of this term. If we are forced to
use the term minimalism it would help to pro
vide a precise definition of the term and a con
trasting term, maximalism. Minimalism
should be used to describe music that is static,
played at a constant volume and constant
speed and lacks the traditional sense of devel
opment, directed motion and climax, which
have been the foundations of Western music
for the past three centuries.

The most fundamental technique of
minimalist music is repetition. Drones, or long
sustained notes, are another important tool in
creating this type of music. To try to illustrate
specific processes, Riley, Reich and Glass
developed jarringly long pieces based on very
simple, minimal musical materials. Defining
minimalism in these clear terms, we might
apply the term minimalism to all types of

music.
For example, the music of
Perotin is built on drones with
repetition of short simple
motives. J.S. Bach should cer
tainly be called a minimalist.
The third movement of his
Fifth Sonata for violin and
harpsichord for example has no
discernible melody: The violin
plays chords in steady eighth
notes against arpeggiated
chords in the harpsichord.
Henry Purcell's use of the
ground (where the bass instru
ments play a simple melody
over and over again) is another
prime example of a precursor of
minimalism. The extensive
body of traditional Western
music works that delve into
minimalist tendencies testify

that there is really nothing revolutionary about
minimalism.
A better understanding of the evolu
tion in the styles of Glass and Reich since 1970
requires a precise definition of maximalism.
lhe most important attribute of maximal
music is the ability to express drama or emo
tion. Maximal music is associated with tradi
tional performance practices, such as the use of
traditional instrumentation (like the string
quartet, symphony orchestra, etc.) and stan
dard duration for pieces (10 to 20 minutes as
opposed to four or five hours). Maximal music
is based on tension: The music grows in stress,
inevitably leads to a climax and ends in a finale
of resolution.
With this definition, one suddenly


Non-musical examples of minimalist musical concepts: the subtractive process
used in Glass's "Two Pages "(1968); an example of phasing found in Reich's
"Piano Phase" (1967); and substitution, heard in Reich's "Six Pianos" (1973).
understands a radical change in the music of
Glass and Reich in the early 19705. For Glass,
the change occurs in the monumental "Music
in Twelve Parts" (1971-74). Considered a
summa of Glass's minimalist techniques, this
piece in many ways also looks forward to a
novel, more lyrical and dramatic style Glass has
since continued to explore. For Reich, the
move toward maximalism first surfaces in

"Music for Eighteen
Musicians" (1974-76).
Like Glass' "Music in
Twelve Parts," this
piece serves as an
apparent summa on
Reich's minimalist
techniques, yet also
looks forward to more
maximal concerns.
Minim a 1 is m
developed directly from
the avant-garde experi
mentation of Young
and Rilev. There was
no dramatic stylistic
leap from their concep
tual pieces to their first
pieces employing drone
and repetition, which
meant to challenge and
mock audiences. Eric
Satie's "Vexations
(consisting of a short
fragment repeated S4O
times) was similarly
written to ridicule early
201h-cen tury audiences
and composers. But the
music of the minimalist
composers is no longer
about confounding
audiences. In fact, the
minimalists have
embarked on writing
public music, or music
for performance.

In the sphere of art music, it was once
quite frequent to see composers participate in
the performance of their pieces, but one 20th
century development has been the retreat of
the composer to the university, exemplifying
the uptown attitude of "Who cares if you lis
ten?" Academic composers writing highly
structured, almost mathematical music are
often led uptown. Downtown composers,
inspired by John Cage's rebellion from intel
lectual musical systems, responded to the
retreat of uptown composers by writing freer,
less serious music in order to restore the dia
logue between the composer and public.

A composer like Glass cannot he called
either uptown or downtown. Glass received a
very formal and traditional training in Paris
with Nadia Boulanger. His music is far from
dilettantish, hut he writes music tor public
genres: opera, theater, film. Because of this
audience-oriented attitude, popular music and
minimalism have been closely tied. Young
inspired the Velvet Underground, who in turn

inspired British minimalist Michael Nvman.
Glass "First Symphony (1992) uses themes
from David Bowie and Brian Lnos album,
"L0w'(1977). Glass collaborated extensively
with Paul Simon and other pop stars to create
his "Songs from Liquid Days' (1985). Despite
the links between minimalism and the world
of popular music, minimalist composers are
not trivial. Yet that has often been the opinion
of the academic musical community.
I he greatest political barriers to the
academic acceptance of minimalism are its
roots in downtown avant-gardism and the
strong bonds linking minimalism with popular
music. In the past 30 years, minimalist music

has become much more formal. Still, many are
reluctant to accept the significance of Glass,
Reich and younger minimalists like Nyman
and John Adams.
Of course, it will he many years before
CI lass operas are studied the way Wagners
operas are studied today. I he recent publica
tion of "Writings on Glass" (Schirmer Books,
1 997) definitely represents a first step toward
the general acceptance of minimal-

ism, however. I his collection o(
essays deal with various aspects of
Glass music and also includes
several interviews with Glass.
Although the interviews are infor
mative and reveal Glass musical
and personal philosophies, the
strength of the hook lies in its
treatment of the subject of the
academic acceptance of minimal
ist music.
Of particular interest is Wcs
York's "Form and Process
(l ( )81), a detailed analysis of
"Two Pages, which presents a
contrasting viewpoint lundamen
tal to any academic treatment and
discourse. Although York's analy
sis may not he perfect, it proves
that even Glass' early, severely
minimalist pieces can he under
stood using rigorous analytical
systems. York's methods suggest
ways one academia might
approach any minimalist piece.
As minimalism continues to
develop, the full historical signifi
cancc of this movement still lies
obscured under its youth. Hut it is
not too soon to grapple with its
complexity and begin to charac
terize how increasing generations
of composers (and pop artists)
have integrated minimalist tech
niques into their music.

used in Glass's "Two Pages "(1968); an example of phasing found in Reich's
"Piano Phase" (1967); and substitution, heard in Reich's "Six Pianos" (1973).
understands a radical change in the music of
Glass and Reich in the early 19705. For Glass,
the change occurs in the monumental "Music
in Twelve Parts" (1971-74). Considered a
summa of Glass's minimalist techniques, this
piece in many ways also looks forward to a
novel, more lyrical and dramatic style Glass has
since continued to explore. For Reich, the
move toward maximalism first surfaces in

"Music for Eighteen
Musicians" (1974-76).
Like Glass' "Music in
Twelve Parts," this
piece serves as an
apparent summa on
Reich's minimalist
techniques, yet also
looks forward to more
maximal concerns.
Minim a 1 is m
developed directly from
the avant-garde experi
mentation of Young
and Rilev. There was
no dramatic stylistic
leap from their concep
tual pieces to their first
pieces employing drone
and repetition, which
meant to challenge and
mock audiences. Eric
Satie's "Vexations
(consisting of a short
fragment repeated S4O
times) was similarly
written to ridicule early
201h-cen tury audiences
and composers. But the
music of the minimalist
composers is no longer
about confounding
audiences. In fact, the
minimalists have
embarked on writing
public music, or music
for performance.

In the sphere of art music, it was once
quite frequent to see composers participate in
the performance of their pieces, but one 20th
century development has been the retreat of
the composer to the university, exemplifying
the uptown attitude of "Who cares if you lis
ten?" Academic composers writing highly
structured, almost mathematical music are
often led uptown. Downtown composers,
inspired by John Cage's rebellion from intel
lectual musical systems, responded to the
retreat of uptown composers by writing freer,
less serious music in order to restore the dia
logue between the composer and public.

A composer like Glass cannot he called
either uptown or downtown. Glass received a
very formal and traditional training in Paris
with Nadia Boulanger. His music is far from
dilettantish, hut he writes music tor public
genres: opera, theater, film. Because of this
audience-oriented attitude, popular music and
minimalism have been closely tied. Young
inspired the Velvet Underground, who in turn

inspired British minimalist Michael Nvman.
Glass "First Symphony (1992) uses themes
from David Bowie and Brian Lnos album,
"L0w'(1977). Glass collaborated extensively
with Paul Simon and other pop stars to create
his "Songs from Liquid Days' (1985). Despite
the links between minimalism and the world
of popular music, minimalist composers are
not trivial. Yet that has often been the opinion
of the academic musical community.
I he greatest political barriers to the
academic acceptance of minimalism are its
roots in downtown avant-gardism and the
strong bonds linking minimalism with popular
music. In the past 30 years, minimalist music

has become much more formal. Still, many are
reluctant to accept the significance of Glass,
Reich and younger minimalists like Nyman
and John Adams.
Of course, it will he many years before
CI lass operas are studied the way Wagners
operas are studied today. I he recent publica
tion of "Writings on Glass" (Schirmer Books,
1 997) definitely represents a first step toward
the general acceptance of minimal-

ism, however. I his collection o(
essays deal with various aspects of
Glass music and also includes
several interviews with Glass.
Although the interviews are infor
mative and reveal Glass musical
and personal philosophies, the
strength of the hook lies in its
treatment of the subject of the
academic acceptance of minimal
ist music.
Of particular interest is Wcs
York's "Form and Process
(l ( )81), a detailed analysis of
"Two Pages, which presents a
contrasting viewpoint lundamen
tal to any academic treatment and
discourse. Although York's analy
sis may not he perfect, it proves
that even Glass' early, severely
minimalist pieces can he under
stood using rigorous analytical
systems. York's methods suggest
ways one academia might
approach any minimalist piece.
As minimalism continues to
develop, the full historical signifi
cancc of this movement still lies
obscured under its youth. Hut it is
not too soon to grapple with its
complexity and begin to charac
terize how increasing generations
of composers (and pop artists)
have integrated minimalist tech
niques into their music.
