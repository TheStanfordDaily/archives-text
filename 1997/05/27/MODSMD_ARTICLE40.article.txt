## Minimalism's 32 Years on the Beach Music that Breaks the Traditional 
### Xavier Arreola 
Last Wednesday marked the 32nd
anniversary of the debut performance
of Terry Riley's "In C." The San
Francisco premiere of this piece
marked the beginning of a style most fre
quently called minimalism. In the early years,
minimalists were only a small group of com-

posers collaborating to develop
a new musical language, work
ing together, playing each
other's music. Philip Glass, the
youngest of these early mini
malists, celebrated his sixtieth
birthday this year. The styles of
the first minimalists, La
Monte Young, Riley, Steve
Reich and Glass, although still
linked to the aesthetics they
developed together in the
19605, have diverged.
Many post-minimalist
composers have integrated
minimalist techniques into
their music. Minimalism is no
longer only an American phe
nomenon but has spread to
Europe. Although the wide
dissemination of minimalism
indicates that it is no longer a

marginal movement, in academic circles it is
still treated marginally. It is said that minimal
ism lacks rigor and is simplistic. It is often
implicitly stated that the music is boring.
There are obvious barriers to introduc
ing minimalism into an academic environ
ment. For instance, how does one begin to dis
cuss a five hour piece like Youngs "Well Tuned
Piano" in a classroom? As tempting as it is to
merely to play 30 seconds of the piece and say
that this continues for several hours, adequate
treatment is required for pieces whose value do
not follow traditional musical tenets.
Unfortunately, proper vocabulary and analyti
cal tools have not yet been standardized to help
approach these kinds of pieces.
Another problem is the lack of

resources. Glass' tight rein over the publication
of his scores prevents comprehensive study of
his work. Reich is the only one of the original
four who has allowed extensive publishing of
his music providing for its greater analysis and
performance, and so it is Reich who is most
often mentioned in the classroom.
Another barrier is the difficulty of per
forming the music. Minimalism offers the per-

former unique challenges: The music does not
require tremendous technical skill hut does
require incredible stamina and concentration.
Of course, it is rather painfully that 1
apply the term minimalism to the music of
these composers because both Glass and Reich
have expressed their disappointment over the
widespread use of this term. If we are forced to
use the term minimalism it would help to pro
vide a precise definition of the term and a con
trasting term, maximalism. Minimalism
should be used to describe music that is static,
played at a constant volume and constant
speed and lacks the traditional sense of devel
opment, directed motion and climax, which
have been the foundations of Western music
for the past three centuries.

The most fundamental technique of
minimalist music is repetition. Drones, or long
sustained notes, are another important tool in
creating this type of music. To try to illustrate
specific processes, Riley, Reich and Glass
developed jarringly long pieces based on very
simple, minimal musical materials. Defining
minimalism in these clear terms, we might
apply the term minimalism to all types of

music.
For example, the music of
Perotin is built on drones with
repetition of short simple
motives. J.S. Bach should cer
tainly be called a minimalist.
The third movement of his
Fifth Sonata for violin and
harpsichord for example has no
discernible melody: The violin
plays chords in steady eighth
notes against arpeggiated
chords in the harpsichord.
Henry Purcell's use of the
ground (where the bass instru
ments play a simple melody
over and over again) is another
prime example of a precursor of
minimalism. The extensive
body of traditional Western
music works that delve into
minimalist tendencies testify

that there is really nothing revolutionary about
minimalism.
A better understanding of the evolu
tion in the styles of Glass and Reich since 1970
requires a precise definition of maximalism.
lhe most important attribute of maximal
music is the ability to express drama or emo
tion. Maximal music is associated with tradi
tional performance practices, such as the use of
traditional instrumentation (like the string
quartet, symphony orchestra, etc.) and stan
dard duration for pieces (10 to 20 minutes as
opposed to four or five hours). Maximal music
is based on tension: The music grows in stress,
inevitably leads to a climax and ends in a finale
of resolution.
With this definition, one suddenly


Non-musical examples of minimalist musical concepts: the subtractive process
used in Glass's "Two Pages "(1968); an example of phasing found in Reich's
"Piano Phase" (1967); and substitution, heard in Reich's "Six Pianos" (1973).
