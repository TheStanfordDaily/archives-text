## Striking a Balance Ethnic Studies and the "Sacred Institution" 
### Ann Kim 
On April 19, 1993, about 100
Stanford students held a rally in
White Plaza a the lack of an Asian
American studies major at the
university. After the rally, the students
marched to the office of University President
Gerhard Casper chanting, "Asian American
studies now." Entering the Quad they stopped
shouting to symbolize the muting "of Asian-
American voices by the lack of an Asian
American studies major." Having filed into the
Presidents Office, they placed leaflets on the
receptionists desk.
"Such political demonstrations have
been fashionable at American universities since
the 19605," said Ramon Mvers in a letter to
The Daily published eight days after the rally.
Myers, a senior Hoover Institution fellow and
curator-scholar of Hoovers East Asian
Collection, referred to the participants in these
demonstrations as "a cavalcade of political ani
mals." He disagreed with the manner in which
the students protested the absence of Asian
American studies when they could have
"advance!d] their arguments in a rational, dis
cursive way through the many channels avail
able in the University." He asserted that,
"Unable to articulate their views in a cool,
rational way, these demonstrators, like their
counterparts of previous decades, believe they
have some innate right to disturb the life of
those around them in the University in order
to advance their own particular demands."
Myers questioned why the University
should tolerate any form of student political
protest. " I he University is a sacred institution
created for rational, logical discussion and not
for ranting and raving," he said.
Myers response illustrates a popular
image of the present-day university as a "sacred

institution" of tradition and intellectual pur
suits, standing in contrast with the history of
left-leaning student political protests dating
back to the 1960s and anti-Vietnam War
demonstrations.
For example, in the month of April,
Stanford saw a history professor receive a
Pulitzer Prize and students organized a demon
stration in response to recent hate crimes tar
geting homosexuals and women. I he intellec
tual accolade contrasted with political protest
illustrates Myers point, disagreement with his
characterization of student protests as "ranting
and raving' aside.
The struggle for creating majors in
Asian-American, Chicano and Native
American studies at Stanford has fueled protest
on campus in recent years, fitting in with the
history of student political protests Myers
referred to. In addition to the protest demand
ing Asian American studies, MEChA, a
Chicano Latino student group, organized a
three-day hunger strike in May 1994. Their
demands included creation of a Chicano stud
ies program.
Like the anti-war demonstrations of
the 1960s that took place at universities across
the nation, Stanford students' demands for
ethnic studies programs are not a one-school
phenomenon. In April 1995, students at
Northwestern University participated in a 12-
day hunger strike to protest the lack of ethnic
studies courses. In April 1996, three students
at Columbia University went on a 15-day
hunger strike while 100 students occupied a
campus building, refusing to leave until
administrators agreed to the creation of an eth
nic studies department. Students at Yale,
Harvard and Princeton universities have also
demanded that their schools make efforts
toward establishing ethnic studies programs.
I he widespread nature of these

protests suggests that students have not been
fighting against reservations toward ethnic
studies but rather are fighting academia's wari
ness.
The perceived academic validity and
value of ethnic studies, or potential lack of it,
is one source of this wariness. It cannot he
denied that the specific experiences and per
spectives of racial and ethnic minorities are
often excluded from discussion in courses. In
History 165 C, the standard 2()th century U.S.
history course, for example, the series of three
lectures on World War II did not mention the
internment of Japanese Americans in the west
ern United States during the war. Nazi con
centration camps were mentioned in passing.
This was probably not a purposeful or sinister
exclusion. Three days were available for dis
cussing all of World War 11, a subject fit for an
entire quarter, so important events and issues
had to be chosen and many things were left
out.
I liis does not necessarily mean that
Stanford, its History Department or the
instructor of this course are insensitive and
don't care about issues pertinent to Japanese-
American or Jewish students. What it does
mean, however, is that there is an obvious gap
to be filled by ethnic studies. There are bodies
of African American, Asian American,
Chicano, Jewish and Native American litera
ture to be studied. The histories of these peo
ples can be examined in depth. There arc soci
ological, psychological and anthropological
aspects of these groups to be examined. Not
only are these things inadequately addressed in
"traditional courses, but such courses cannot
be expected to do this.
Another fear often expressed about
ethnic studies programs is that they will sepa
rate students of minority groups from the rest
of the universitv because the majority of stu
