## Striking a Balance Ethnic Studies and the "Sacred Institution" 
### Ann Kim 
On April 19, 1993, about 100
Stanford students held a rally in
White Plaza a the lack of an Asian
American studies major at the
university. After the rally, the students
marched to the office of University President
Gerhard Casper chanting, "Asian American
studies now." Entering the Quad they stopped
shouting to symbolize the muting "of Asian-
American voices by the lack of an Asian
American studies major." Having filed into the
Presidents Office, they placed leaflets on the
receptionists desk.
"Such political demonstrations have
been fashionable at American universities since
the 19605," said Ramon Mvers in a letter to
The Daily published eight days after the rally.
Myers, a senior Hoover Institution fellow and
curator-scholar of Hoovers East Asian
Collection, referred to the participants in these
demonstrations as "a cavalcade of political ani
mals." He disagreed with the manner in which
the students protested the absence of Asian
American studies when they could have
"advance!d] their arguments in a rational, dis
cursive way through the many channels avail
able in the University." He asserted that,
"Unable to articulate their views in a cool,
rational way, these demonstrators, like their
counterparts of previous decades, believe they
have some innate right to disturb the life of
those around them in the University in order
to advance their own particular demands."
Myers questioned why the University
should tolerate any form of student political
protest. " I he University is a sacred institution
created for rational, logical discussion and not
for ranting and raving," he said.
Myers response illustrates a popular
image of the present-day university as a "sacred

institution" of tradition and intellectual pur
suits, standing in contrast with the history of
left-leaning student political protests dating
back to the 1960s and anti-Vietnam War
demonstrations.
For example, in the month of April,
Stanford saw a history professor receive a
Pulitzer Prize and students organized a demon
stration in response to recent hate crimes tar
geting homosexuals and women. I he intellec
tual accolade contrasted with political protest
illustrates Myers point, disagreement with his
characterization of student protests as "ranting
and raving' aside.
The struggle for creating majors in
Asian-American, Chicano and Native
American studies at Stanford has fueled protest
on campus in recent years, fitting in with the
history of student political protests Myers
referred to. In addition to the protest demand
ing Asian American studies, MEChA, a
Chicano Latino student group, organized a
three-day hunger strike in May 1994. Their
demands included creation of a Chicano stud
ies program.
Like the anti-war demonstrations of
the 1960s that took place at universities across
the nation, Stanford students' demands for
ethnic studies programs are not a one-school
phenomenon. In April 1995, students at
Northwestern University participated in a 12-
day hunger strike to protest the lack of ethnic
studies courses. In April 1996, three students
at Columbia University went on a 15-day
hunger strike while 100 students occupied a
campus building, refusing to leave until
administrators agreed to the creation of an eth
nic studies department. Students at Yale,
Harvard and Princeton universities have also
demanded that their schools make efforts
toward establishing ethnic studies programs.
I he widespread nature of these

protests suggests that students have not been
fighting against reservations toward ethnic
studies but rather are fighting academia's wari
ness.
The perceived academic validity and
value of ethnic studies, or potential lack of it,
is one source of this wariness. It cannot he
denied that the specific experiences and per
spectives of racial and ethnic minorities are
often excluded from discussion in courses. In
History 165 C, the standard 2()th century U.S.
history course, for example, the series of three
lectures on World War II did not mention the
internment of Japanese Americans in the west
ern United States during the war. Nazi con
centration camps were mentioned in passing.
This was probably not a purposeful or sinister
exclusion. Three days were available for dis
cussing all of World War 11, a subject fit for an
entire quarter, so important events and issues
had to be chosen and many things were left
out.
I liis does not necessarily mean that
Stanford, its History Department or the
instructor of this course are insensitive and
don't care about issues pertinent to Japanese-
American or Jewish students. What it does
mean, however, is that there is an obvious gap
to be filled by ethnic studies. There are bodies
of African American, Asian American,
Chicano, Jewish and Native American litera
ture to be studied. The histories of these peo
ples can be examined in depth. There arc soci
ological, psychological and anthropological
aspects of these groups to be examined. Not
only are these things inadequately addressed in
"traditional courses, but such courses cannot
be expected to do this.
Another fear often expressed about
ethnic studies programs is that they will sepa
rate students of minority groups from the rest
of the universitv because the majority of stu
dents taking ethnic studies courses are
minorities. But why is it that a lecture hall
filled with predominantly Chicano students
for a course on Chicano culture makes peo
ple uncomfortable while no one thinks
twice about predominantly white courses?
Perhaps this is because whites are in the
majority at Stanford so it's expected for
them to form the largest percentage of a
course.
I hen why are whites not in the
majority in a Chicano culture course or in
other ethnic studies courses? That these
courses generate more interest in members
of certain ethnic and / or racial groups
should not be used to dispute the worth of
ethnic studies. Engineering courses appeal
to techies more than fuzzies, and no one
questions the existence of engineering
majors because the courses divide techies
from fuzzies. If people are uncomfortable
with the idea of courses filled with members
of minority groups, if they see such a line
dividing one group from another, perhaps
they can get an understanding for how some
minority students might feel in their non
ethnic studies courses.
Perhaps the main reason ethnic
studies causes discomfort is that it is widely
perceived as having an agenda. Ethnic stud
ies may be perceived as a program that pur
posely indoctrinates its students with sepa
ratist rhetoric, assuming that the world is
racist and the white male is the source of all
societal evil. It's just "white-bashing," some
feel.
It should be noted, though, that all
majors have agendas and specific perspec
tives. The Psychology Department's agenda
is to teach its students about the human
mind and how it functions. Ethnic studies
strives to teach students about the different
experiences and perspectives of racial and
ethnic minorities, as well as the historical,
social and political forces behind them. This
is not by necessity highly polemical. If it is
interpreted by others as "white-bashing,"
perhaps this is a mirror of their own para
noia concerning the motives of minority
groups. It does not always boil down to rev
olution.
In the face of the cautious stance
universities have taken toward ethnic studies
and the vehement student protests of recent
years, Stanford's own version of an ethnic
studies program was formally established
this year. Undergraduate students can now
declare majors in Asian American studies,
Chicano studies, Native American studies or
comparative studies in race and ethnicity.

These majors, along with the already-exist
ing majors in African and Afro-American
studies and Jewish studies, form the latest
interdisciplinary program at Stanford.
Caution was definitely the name of
the game at Stanford, as CSRE's creation
simply means that classes pertaining to race
and ethnicity already being offered in vari
ous departments can now he applied toward
the new majors. CSRE is developing a few
of its own core lectures but the creation of
the new majors involved mostly administra
tive paper shuffling.
The way CSRE was structured at
Stanford avoids another issue that has been
raised about ethnic studies programs. The
fact that such programs have been created
largely in response to the political pressure
of student groups has raised questions about
whether their purpose is only to appease
protesting minority groups. But because
CSRE is composed of courses that have all
been taught at Stanford in previous years by
faculty in more traditional departments like

history or English, such claims cannot be
made against Stanford's program.
But couldn't any potential CSRE
major just take the courses on race and eth
nicity that were already being offered? By
creating an interdisciplinary major with spe
cific requirements, a large measure of coher
ence is given to the study of race and eth
nicity. Students have access to a core group
of faculty members, to fellow majors and to
a general foundation for their studies. And
CSRE adds a further element of legitimacy
to ethnic studies on campus. It shows that
the concept of ethnic studies has been, at
least cautiously, accepted by the university.
In the conflict between the "sacred
institution for rational and logical discus
sion" that Myers described and the history
of political protests at these institutions,
CSRE has managed to strike a balance.
