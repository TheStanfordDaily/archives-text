### Kenneth Fields 
"Texts" or "signs" or (worse) "traces," it appears,
projected themselves, not books that people read.
And the author, the fat, bristly doctor, say,
became an expedient synecdoche, "Dr. Johnson,"
who didn't write his books — they were just written.
A curious people, they put poison in their food
(and knew it) to make meat redder under glass,
translated languages they didn't understand,
and looked, for the cures of the plagues that science caused,
to science . . . whose disinterested shamans feared
when they dropped the first Big One that it might
explode the atmosphere — in which unlucky event
the world would have disappeared. One deconstructionist
("Freeman Dyson") insisted, "The bomb was dropped."
Such passive modesty before such a grand florescence! —
the radiance of a culture sous-rature.
