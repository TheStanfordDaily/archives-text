## Verdi's “Aïda” and Egyptology UNRAVELING THE BLACK PHARAOH 
### Benjamin N. Lawrance 
When San Francisco Opera
chose African-American bass
Chester Patton as one of their
two kings of Hgypt in the cast
of Ciuseppe Verdi's "Aida" recently, it brought
lip the question of whether the producers were
deliberately putting themselves out on a limb.
It didn't attract a lot of media attention, but
perhaps among the regular opera-going public
it did raise a few eyebrows. Was there an
intended subtext here? Were viewers expected
to read more into this?
In all actuality, the decision seems to
have been an inspired one, from two very dif
ferent angles. On a purely artistic level,
Chester Patton was a remarkable pharaoh. His
delivery was clear, clean and crisp and carried
high through the immensity of the temporary
venue, an immensity in which already too
many voices had been lost. He moved about
the stage with the appropriate dignity and his
characterization was warm and fulfilling.
Moreover, black pharaohs are historical
facts. Sadly this truth has been overshadowed
by both the racism in the 19th and 2()th cen
turies and, more recently, by spurious asser
tions about race and ethnicity by a small fac
tion of misguided Afro-centrists. Some of these
claims, such as that all Egyptian pharaohs were
black, are simply wrong. Others, such as that
Aristotle traveled to Alexandria and stole his
work from philosophers of African descent,
border on hilarious.
Perhaps the San Francisco Opera was
trying to elucidate this nuance with its
grandiose production. Nonetheless, the opera
provides an intriguing nexus of ethnic tension
and"the hidden.'' Verdi's "Aida" is a truly
remarkable opera that offers far too much to its
wider audience for it to remain accessible to
the select and chosen haute bourgeoisie.
Verdi's music is at it richest and most profound
in "Aida.' Opera as drama carries along an

inspired libretto with alarm and passion. I he
story itself is not even loosely based on fact —
it concerns the age old struggles between l'<gypt
and Nubia (in the opera, Ethiopia) which span
the entire 3,500-year history of ancient Egypt.
Radames, a captain of the guard, is in
love with Aida, a slave girl. Aida's mistress, the
King of Egypt's daughter Amneris, is also in
love with the captain. Unknown to everyone in
Egypt, Aida is actually a Nubian princess and
the daughter of Egypt's worst enemy, the King
of Nubia. Radames shares his love with Aida
and Amneris becomes rightly suspicious. After
Radames is chosen to lead Pharaoh's army,
Amneris's jealousy grows and she confronts
Aida. Aida admits her love and shatters their
trust.
Victorious Radames returns with cap
tives, Aida's father disguised among them. It is
Radames's wish that the prisoners be freed,
barring only Aida and her father. The betrothal
of Amernis is a further reward. She is persuad
ed by her father to trick Radames into reveal
ing the route of the Egyptian army. Aida and
her father flee, and Radames, realizing his
betrayal, submits to punishment. He is sealed
alive in a tomb. In his tomb Radames finds
Aida waiting for him. In the closing scene the
priests chant their hymns as the two lovers
meet their death dreaming of a happier life.
The central concern of this opera is
undoubtedly the love story. It is as emotive as
it is unpredictable. However, the backdrop to
the entire opera, the tension between Egypt
and Nubia, is hard-hitting and accurate, and
all too often forgotten. Aida was written in the
late 1800's when the darkening tides of racism
were sweeping aside the last semblance of accu
racy and honesty in the history of the origin of
European and Middle Eastern culture. As
Verdi composed, countless white males were
pronouncing Greece and Rome-not Egypt-to
be the cradle of civilization.

One reason behind this racist compila
tion of ideas and values was the European fear
of the depth and significance of the influence
of Africa on Egyptian civilization. I'he Afro-
Asiatic (as it is now commonly called after the
incredible influential book by Martin Bernal,
Black Athena) remains an unknown quantity
in Egyptian civilization. Clearly, certain
pharaoh dynasties were Nubian or of Nubian
descent. This fact alone was enough to terrify
some of the most virulent racist ideologues.
The question ran: why would a civilization of
such immense proportions even consider
focusing on Afro-Asiatics, a generally back
ward, uncivilized and disparate group of peo
ple high in the Nubian mountains?
Although it is somewhat of a simplifi
cation to say that the civilization along the
Nile "looked south" (or, topographically, "up")
to Nubia, there is plenty of evidence to sup
port this assertion. Control of the region
known as Nubia was always of the uppermost
importance to the Pharaoh. The Nile civiliza
tion was fiercely autocratic and ludicrously lav
ish. Almost all the wealth which enabled this
civilization to continue came from Nubia and
further south-gold in immense quantities,
ivory, ebony, precious stones, incense, timber,
copper, iron. Africans from the furthermost
reaches of modern Uganda, Ethiopia and
Kenya traded along the Nile for millennia.
Countless frescos and wall reliefs show that no
Pharonic dynasty could rest until it had
secured Nubia and Nubian trade. While some
dynasties marched south and annihilated
Nubians, others coexisted more peacefully,
while later dynasties sought to rigidly control
the Nile by building monumental forts along
the valley.
Another way to examine the question
is via the different geographical origins of the
more than thirty Egyptian dynasties (a chrono
logical methodology enshrined by the 3rd
cent. B.C. Greek author Manetho). While
some, such as the dynasty of Rameses the
Great, came from the Delta region, others
came from Aswan and even Nubia itself. A
considerable number of Pharaohs were certain
ly of a darker skin color and some were indeed
black. While it is impossible to establish exact
ly how many were "black", some of the most
powerful Pharaohs came from the border
regions of Egypt and Nubia near the First
Cataract. Menenhotep II was one of the most
prominent of his Aswan-based

dynasty. Then of course, there was
the powerful Nubian (25th
Dynasty), with the long-reigning
Taharqo.
Some of the more stable
dynasties originated further south
along the Nile. One possible reason
for this was exactly that because of
this they were able to secure the
Nubian trade concerns and
enhance the capacity of their rule
with the necessary material.
Moreover, many of the dynasties
not from the south still used
Nubian soldiers and Nubian
policemen throughout the Nile val
ley. I hey were known as Magi,
hence the biblical term.
But a word of caution. In
writing this, I am merely pointing
out that there is considerable evi
dence to support the idea that
Egypt looked more to the south
than in any other direction in its
efforts to expand and stabilize.
Such an assertion requires immense
generalizations that ought not to
be allowed to mask the historical
facts. Recently, some farcical claims
have been made by a small band of
the more zealous Afro-centrists,
which have in turn served only to

damage the standing of the discipline of
Egyptology and the discourse about race
and ethnicity. Afro-centrists might
explain their goal as refocusing history
around the Afro-Asiatic origins of mod-

ern civilization and shedding light on racist
distortion in earlier histories. As an African
historian, I am entirely in favor of this goal. I
am immensely impressed by the first volume of
Martin Bernal's work, a tome that many Afro
centrists place on equal standing with the
Bible. But a small group have made far more
insubstantial claims which have opened their
collective flank to attack from Eurocentric his
torians.
Aristotle did not work from African

sources. Cleopatra was not black. Menenhotep
II was not black because his statue appears this
way. Many of these claims are fabrications,
while others are misreadings of Egyptian
imagery and wall-painting, and largely the
result of ignorance on the part of the
claimant. Egyptian wall painting was highly
stylized, very symbolic and had great religious
and magical significance. Depictions of for
eigners have somewhat of a generic nature.
Egyptian frescos sometimes depicted the four

races of mankind: Egyptian, Nubian, Libyan
and Asiatic. This tells us that there is no simple
way to understand such complicated images.
In order for us to even get close to the minutes
of the artist, let alone the reality he or she was
supposedly painting, we must consider the lay
ers of interpretation.
Different audiences might recognize
the significance of only particular aspects of a
painting or relief. Egypt was a very visual civi
lization, and its complexity is only now begin

ning to be understood. For example when men
are painted black on frescos in tombs, it is not
always the case that it is because they are of
African origin. It could possibly be that the
image depicts the soul (ba) on the journey to
the underworld. The reverse is true of women,
since women were almost exclusively painted
in white. Furthermore, together, these images
are not evidence for interracial marriage. More
specifically, a well-known statue of Pharaoh
Menenhotep 11, painted black, is not evidence

that he was African. Though indeed
it is almost certainly the case that he
was very dark-skinned, the black
ness is a stylistic trait in statuary in
temples and tombs. Hi esc are some
examples of common misunder
standings of Egyptian art and dis
play which have only served to fuel
the confusion about the nature of
race and ethnicity along the Nile.
Images in Egypt had a huge
prospective audience, or a tiny one,
depending on where they were dis
played. Tomb frescos may have been
open once and then viewed only by
the workers before the tomb was
sealed. The monumental wall reliefs
at Karnak, however, were designed
to be viewed by millions. The
"truth about race and ethnicity in
Egypt and Nubia, lies within a com
plex mesh various audience percep
tions, the task of the artist, the
intention of the commissioner, the
stereotypical traditions of depiction
of people of all colors.
It is perhaps farfetched to
think that the San Francisco Opera
were trying to blaze a trail through
this confusion. Verdi's choice of
Nubian slave girl for Aid a, posed no
problems. A black pharaoh was the
choice of the opera company. I

would like to think that they chose
Chester Paxton on the basis of his out
standing ability and stage charisma, and I
think I would be quite safe with such a

statement. I iowever, if I have suggested
anything in this brief article, it is that this is no
historical anachronism either, hut a resound
ingly inspired decision which facilitates much
needed reflection on the complexity that was
ancient Egyptian culture.
