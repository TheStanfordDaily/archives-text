## Verdi's “Aïda” and Egyptology UNRAVELING THE BLACK PHARAOH 
### Benjamin N. Lawrance 
When San Francisco Opera
chose African-American bass
Chester Patton as one of their
two kings of Hgypt in the cast
of Ciuseppe Verdi's "Aida" recently, it brought
lip the question of whether the producers were
deliberately putting themselves out on a limb.
It didn't attract a lot of media attention, but
perhaps among the regular opera-going public
it did raise a few eyebrows. Was there an
intended subtext here? Were viewers expected
to read more into this?
In all actuality, the decision seems to
have been an inspired one, from two very dif
ferent angles. On a purely artistic level,
Chester Patton was a remarkable pharaoh. His
delivery was clear, clean and crisp and carried
high through the immensity of the temporary
venue, an immensity in which already too
many voices had been lost. He moved about
the stage with the appropriate dignity and his
characterization was warm and fulfilling.
Moreover, black pharaohs are historical
facts. Sadly this truth has been overshadowed
by both the racism in the 19th and 2()th cen
turies and, more recently, by spurious asser
tions about race and ethnicity by a small fac
tion of misguided Afro-centrists. Some of these
claims, such as that all Egyptian pharaohs were
black, are simply wrong. Others, such as that
Aristotle traveled to Alexandria and stole his
work from philosophers of African descent,
border on hilarious.
Perhaps the San Francisco Opera was
trying to elucidate this nuance with its
grandiose production. Nonetheless, the opera
provides an intriguing nexus of ethnic tension
and"the hidden.'' Verdi's "Aida" is a truly
remarkable opera that offers far too much to its
wider audience for it to remain accessible to
the select and chosen haute bourgeoisie.
Verdi's music is at it richest and most profound
in "Aida.' Opera as drama carries along an

inspired libretto with alarm and passion. I he
story itself is not even loosely based on fact —
it concerns the age old struggles between l'<gypt
and Nubia (in the opera, Ethiopia) which span
the entire 3,500-year history of ancient Egypt.
Radames, a captain of the guard, is in
love with Aida, a slave girl. Aida's mistress, the
King of Egypt's daughter Amneris, is also in
love with the captain. Unknown to everyone in
Egypt, Aida is actually a Nubian princess and
the daughter of Egypt's worst enemy, the King
of Nubia. Radames shares his love with Aida
and Amneris becomes rightly suspicious. After
Radames is chosen to lead Pharaoh's army,
Amneris's jealousy grows and she confronts
Aida. Aida admits her love and shatters their
trust.
Victorious Radames returns with cap
tives, Aida's father disguised among them. It is
Radames's wish that the prisoners be freed,
barring only Aida and her father. The betrothal
of Amernis is a further reward. She is persuad
ed by her father to trick Radames into reveal
ing the route of the Egyptian army. Aida and
her father flee, and Radames, realizing his
betrayal, submits to punishment. He is sealed
alive in a tomb. In his tomb Radames finds
Aida waiting for him. In the closing scene the
priests chant their hymns as the two lovers
meet their death dreaming of a happier life.
The central concern of this opera is
undoubtedly the love story. It is as emotive as
it is unpredictable. However, the backdrop to
the entire opera, the tension between Egypt
and Nubia, is hard-hitting and accurate, and
all too often forgotten. Aida was written in the
late 1800's when the darkening tides of racism
were sweeping aside the last semblance of accu
racy and honesty in the history of the origin of
European and Middle Eastern culture. As
Verdi composed, countless white males were
pronouncing Greece and Rome-not Egypt-to
be the cradle of civilization.

One reason behind this racist compila
tion of ideas and values was the European fear
of the depth and significance of the influence
of Africa on Egyptian civilization. I'he Afro-
Asiatic (as it is now commonly called after the
incredible influential book by Martin Bernal,
Black Athena) remains an unknown quantity
in Egyptian civilization. Clearly, certain
pharaoh dynasties were Nubian or of Nubian
descent. This fact alone was enough to terrify
some of the most virulent racist ideologues.
The question ran: why would a civilization of
such immense proportions even consider
focusing on Afro-Asiatics, a generally back
ward, uncivilized and disparate group of peo
ple high in the Nubian mountains?
Although it is somewhat of a simplifi
cation to say that the civilization along the
Nile "looked south" (or, topographically, "up")
to Nubia, there is plenty of evidence to sup
port this assertion. Control of the region
known as Nubia was always of the uppermost
importance to the Pharaoh. The Nile civiliza
tion was fiercely autocratic and ludicrously lav
ish. Almost all the wealth which enabled this
civilization to continue came from Nubia and
further south-gold in immense quantities,
ivory, ebony, precious stones, incense, timber,
copper, iron. Africans from the furthermost
reaches of modern Uganda, Ethiopia and
Kenya traded along the Nile for millennia.
Countless frescos and wall reliefs show that no
Pharonic dynasty could rest until it had
secured Nubia and Nubian trade. While some
dynasties marched south and annihilated
Nubians, others coexisted more peacefully,
while later dynasties sought to rigidly control
the Nile by building monumental forts along
the valley.
Another way to examine the question
is via the different geographical origins of the
more than thirty Egyptian dynasties (a chrono
logical methodology enshrined by the 3rd
