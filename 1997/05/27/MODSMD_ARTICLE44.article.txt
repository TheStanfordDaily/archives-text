## From White and Blue to Black A 						History of East Palo Alto, 1945-46 
### Alison Post 
East Palo Alto lies on marginal land:
fertile yet flood-prone bavlands that
turn vibrant green with winter rains.
A few relic farmhouses and water
towers survive from an earlier era. Fading sin
gle-family homes with fenced windows now

dominate the landscape. Although University
Avenue has been recently rcpaved, many streets
seem more pothole than road. East Palo Alto
houses many of the Peninsula poor, as well as a
disproportionate fraction of the areas racial
minorities. Although small businesses are mak
ing .1 comeback along the main thoroughfares,
few large stores or industries currently anchor

the city economy. In light of these characteris
tics, residents and outsiders alike have, at dif
ferent points in East Palo Altos history, labeled
the community a "ghetto." East Palo Alto,
however, is the product of a different set of his
torical forces than the archetypal urban ghetto.
Between 1945 and 1965, East Palo
Alto was dramatically transformed along with

the rest of the Peninsula. A postwar economic
boom, new highway construction and the
popularization of the suburban ideal triggered
a wave of new industrial and residential devel
opment south of South San Francisco. I hough
the San Mateo County government imposed
few regulations on the new construction,
developers did not build in a vacuum. Earlier
residential development had established a set

of political jurisdictions and taxation practices
that, in combination with a trend toward
homeownership, significantly shaped postwar
development of the Peninsula. These forces
weighed against the political and economic
health of East Palo Alto, a farming communi
ty turned into a cluster of 1950s working-class
housing tracts at the southern tip of the coun
ty. When African Americans migrated to Hast

Palo Alto from San I rancisco, Oakland and
Richmond during the early 19605, the stage
had already been set for the community's mar
ginalization.
Earlier waves of settlement in San
Mateo County had created a mottled land
scape of municipal and county jurisdictions.
Beginning in the late 19th century, the
Peninsula became a country retreat from the

fog and urban ills of San Francisco. It was con
ceptualized as both frontier and countryside.
In the rhetoric of the time, a Palo Alto Times
article extolled the settlement of the Peninsula:
"It is made the manifest destiny of the penin
sula to become the great residence place for
San Francisco people — not only those who
are engaged in mercantile and professional
pursuits but also the greater army needed to
care of the vast volume of commerce that cen
ters in San Francisco."
Commuters and shop proprietors
bought homes in towns along the Southern
Pacific's San Francisco-San Jose route;
Atherton, Palo Alto and other towns boasted
substantial commuter populations. This settle
ment coincided with the Progressive era's
Municipal Reform Movement. Inspired by
newspaper muckraking, newcomers regularly
lambasted the inefficiencies, graft and filth
plaguing San Francisco. It was felt that by
legally incorporating themselves as cities, these
new communities would avert a similar fate.
Incorporation gave cities the power to tax
property within their borders. These revenues
could in turn be used to finance municipal ser
vices such as police protection and public util
ities — services that could guarantee cleanli
ness and relative tranquility in the new com
munities.
In San Mateo County, upstart commu
nities tended to press for incorporation once
they attained a critical mass of resi
dents, taxable property,
common desire for

municipal services
and civic identi-

ty. The rest of
the county,
however,
rema i n e d
unincorporat
ed. The county

provided services
such as policing and

road maintenance to
the more sparsely populated
farming and ranching areas through
"special districts." Overall, rural communities
needed and received fewer services; rapid pop
ulation growth had not yet placed difficult
demands on the environment in these areas.
One might belong to several overlapping dis
tricts, each providing different services. And so
East Palo Alto, home to a few farms at the turn
of the century, remained unincorporated like
much of the county.
A second wave of settlement during
the 1920s further ingrained this pattern of dis
tinguishing densely populated, incorporated

towns distinct from more open, unincorporat

of Peninsula highways, including the Bayshore
Freeway in 1924, paved the way for more rapid
suburbanization. Between 1920 and 1950, the
county population mushroomed from

the 1920s than at the turn of the century. For
the most part, this new development was com

throughout this peri-

19205, "Runnymede," a Utopian chicken
farming colony, co-existed with more tradi
tional family farming. Immigrant flower grow
ers succeeded the chicken farmers during the
following decades. Only a small strip of liquor
stores and restaurants on the community's
edge detracted from this rural character. Hast

development after World War II strained this
county system in unanticipated ways.
Incorporated cities 1 reliance on property taxes
and mass enthrallment with a suburban ideal
together ensured that East Palo Alto would
remain unincorporated in spite of its rapid

urbanization. New highways and

cars inspired rapid develop-

ment. Executives and

factory workers

alike filtered

down from the

cities to the
Peninsula. To
meet this
demand, pri
vate develop
ers — who

were for the

most part unregu-

lated — began to

construct winding sub-

urban tracts and spacious

industrial parks throughout the

unincorporated areas. Builders tended to con
struct more expensive dwellings in the hills
and concentrate more moderately priced
homes near the existing cities. They then
crowded the cheapest tracts across the
Bayshore Freeway, near the Bay. East Palo Alto
farmers began found it more profitable to sell
off their agricultural acreage to developers
rather than continue to cultivate.
In the space of a few years, East Palo
Alto was transformed into one of the few
working-class suburbs of San Mateo County.
This land — the less attractive, flood-prone
flats — was cheap enough that developers
could build shoddier versions of the middle
class suburban tract home. This was a place
where the working class could literally buy into
the middle-class ideal of homeownership,
albeit in a geographically distinct area. One
firm broke ground on the Palo Alto Gardens
subdivision in 1947 and built 281 lots over the
following six years. In 1951, another develop
er began University Village, a 600-home tract.
The Palo Alto Park and Flood Park estates
soon followed.
Industrial and commercial develop
ment did not lag far behind. East Palo Alto's
proximity to the Bayshore Freeway, the
Dumbarton Bridge and a railroad spur track
attracted industries such as Miller Helicopter,
Borrman Steel Co. and McGammon-
Wunderlich, a contracting outfit. All in all, the
areas population skyrocketed from 1500 in
1947, to 6000 in 1952 and 12,000 in 1953.
Rapid demographic change left a quite differ
ent social environment in its wake: Robert
Lowe, another student of East Palo Alto histo
ry, argues that the area was increasingly inhab
ited hv those who worked in the new industri
al parks; he cites changes in occupation names,
as listed in the Palo Alto directory. In 1919, a
majority of residents identified themselves as
poultrymen, carpenters or even teamsters,
while 30 years later the list consisted of
machinists, mechanics, draftsmen and other
blue-collar occupations. In the space of 10
years, the post-war trend towards the decen
tralization of home and industry transformed a
diffuse farming community into a working
class suburb.
Existing municipalities responded to
this rapid development by annexing selected
properties. Because the official purpose of
incorporated cities was to provide cheap and
efficient services, none desired to increase their
tax burden through the annexation of low
income areas. It made much more sense to
annex industrial land or new suburban tracts
that would increase the property tax base or to
open space on which to construct sewer plants
or airports. San Jose, for example, waged a par
ticularly aggressive annexation campaign in
response to decentralized development. These
economic imperatives motivated Peninsula
towns to annex on a smaller scale as well.
During the late 1940s and 19505,
Menlo Park and Palo Alto annexed several of
the most valuable pieces of land in the East
Palo Alto unincorporated area. Annexations

with differing degrees of success — in order to
prevent future land-grabbing. Testimony from
a set of 1958 state senate hearings illuminates
this tie among annexation, incorporation and
city services. Appearing before the committee,

the mayor of Woodside testified

that in 1956, town resi

merits. The
mayor of
Saratoga

was even
more explicit

about his
towns motive for

incorporation:
First is the fal

lacv that a city is bv defin

ition a place modeled on New
York or Chicago. The word city' brings to the
average mind the image of large numbers of
people jammed tightly in a relatively small
area. It evokes the mental pictures of asphalt,
concrete, bright lights, congestion, traffic jams,

stores, factories, tall buildings, people in a
hurry, faceless and nameless masses ol human
ity scurrying like ants in and out of concrete
canyons. It evokes pictures ol cliff dweller
apartments and houses jammed together on
lots so small your neighbor scratches when you
itch. I'his is a true image, but it is not a true
definition. Such places, although they obvious
ly exist, have neither a legal nor practical
monopoly on the name of city. A city is a
legally recognized municipal corporation
called into existence by those who live in it in
order to enable them to arrange their lives in
their own way. . . . Many cities want to stay
small and for excellent reasons. They like their
way of life and they do not want to change it
for one they definitely do not like. . . . My
contention is that small cities can exist for rea
sons other than providing sewers.
In other words, residents of these
wealthier suburban communities incorporated
in order to maintain homogeneity. Their ideal
community was a low-overhead suburb.
Repelled by urban stereotypes, they wanted to
differentiate themselves — associationally, geo
graphically and economically — from the
growing and relatively diverse cities around
them. Incorporation gave these communities
the power to control future development.
While most of these wealthier commu
nities successfully incorporated, Kast Palo

errv tax income.
Altans found it more difficult to control their
own fate. Social diversity and a low potential
property tax base ensured that East Palo Alto
would not incorporate during the 19505.
Frustrated with the county "special district"
system, residents of several subdivisions found
ed neighborhood improvement organizations,

designed to provide flood
relief and other services.
Such private initiatives,
however, did not satisfy
many residents. Localized
efforts proved insufficient
remedies for a host of
emerging community prob
lems including unemploy
ment, transiency and crime.
Some saw incorporation as a
way to begin to grapple with
these phenomena. In 1953,
improvement organizations
and other groups launched
an incorporation drive. The
effort splintered, however,
when disagreements arose
over tax rate and budget esti
mates. In 1957, an alliance
of improvement organiza
tions and interracial groups
mounted a more serious ini-

riative. Donald Barr, who spearheaded the
Committee for Incorporation, gave the follow
ing rationale for incorporation:
Basically, we are faced with the disad
vantages of a city now, such as a high density
of population. We are not rural — most of use
live on 5,000-square-foot lots — and our pop
ulation density per square mile is greater than
that of many existing cities on the Peninsula.
We have police problems aggravated by a tran
sient population, unemployment and, again,
high density of population. We have an over
abundance of special districts. . . . We have a
lack of representation. . . . We have lack of
good traffic circulation. . . . We have a lack of
basic improvements. . . . Why do these disad
vantages exist? Mainly because we exist within
a county jurisdiction set up to administer on a
rural level.
Tom Kavenaugh, a member of an area
farming family, brought up the crucial prob
lem of incorporation at the same meeting. On
marginal land covered by relatively cheap
dwellings, the East Palo Alto area did not have
enough assessed valuation for an adequate city
tax base. If they remained unincorporated, tax
rates would remain manageable. In the end,
the majority of the areas diverse population —
comprised of farmers, blue-collar homeown
ers, industrialists, whites and a small but grow

ing number of African Americans — chose not
to sanction the movement. Peninsula trends in
suburbanization and municipal governance
had ensured that East Palo Alto would neither
be annexed by surrounding towns, nor retain
enough valuable land to incorporate and fund
its own city services.

An inequitable economic and political
landscape had developed on the Peninsula. As
a result of the postwar home-buying spree,
suburbanites of different economic strata
bought into relatively homogenous communi
ties: Large villas spanned the hills, while apart
ments and smaller dwellings clustered by the
Bay. Class lines tended to overlap with distinct
political jurisdictions, resulting in an unfair
system. Those with the greatest need for city
services were the least likely to receive them.
East Palo Altans might have been able
to pressure the county government to fund
essential, supplementary services they were
unable to provide for themselves. However, the
community exerted too little political power to
secure special treatment. As the area's popula
tion skyrocketed after the war, the county
Board of Supervisors decided to place it in the
second supervisorial district. Under this
arrangement, East Palo Altans elected a com
mon representative with residents of
Burlingame, Foster City and Hillsborough.
This arrangement separated the East Palo Alto
vote from that of Menlo Park and Redwood
City, adjacent cities that boasted substantial
low-income populations. Grouped as such
with nonadjacent districts, even when voting
as a block. East Palo Altans would not have
been unable to affect county elections signifi

candy. It is not surprising that, with so little
influence, Hast Palo Altans managed to occupy
only a few posts on county boards or commis
sions.
After the unsuccessful 1958 incorpora
tion drive, the Board of Supervisors did create
a representative body for East Palo Alto and

East Menlo Park: the Alto
Park Council. They intended
for this council to serve as a
liaison between the communi
ty and the county govern
ment. This board, however,
was simply advisory and did
not significantly influence
county policymaking.
Consequently, county agen
cies had little presence in East
Palo Alto. The county only
operated a branch library and
a few Department of Public
Health and Welfare divisions
in the area. More important,
residents wielded little to no
influence over county and
regional planning decisions
directly affecting the commu
nity.
When the Rayshore

Freeway (Highway 101) was
widened, residents were unable to prevent a
rerouting straight through the community's
University Avenue business district. The high
way widening had enormous repercussions in
East Palo Alto. Bulldozers knocked down 50
local businesses. Several lanes of traffic and a
concrete overpass came to isolate East Palo
Alto from Palo Alto. Pre-war jurisdictions and
taxation practices had set the stage for com
munity marginalization. By 1960, the drama
was well underway.

Market forces had shaped an econom
ically segregated landscape in San Mateo
County. During the early 19605, market forces
ushered in racial segregation as well. This pop
ulation shift had its origins in the domestic
production for World War 11. As the southern
sharecropping economy grew increasingly
mechanized, war production attracted a large
number of rural blacks to the Bay Area. As a
result of these new employment opportunities,
the Bay Area population grew from 4 to 5 mil
lion during the war years alone. African-
American migrants tended to cluster in racial
ly demarcated central city communities such as
San Francisco's Hunter's Point and Western
Addition. At the end of the war, however,
African Americans proved to be the last hired
and first fired. Some of the recent migrants left

the cities almost immediate
ly after war. San Mateo
County and other suburban
domains were destinations
for rhose African Americans
who considered themselves
upwardly mobile — those
for whom the middle-class
ideal of a single-family home
and car commute were par
ticularly attractive.
Ihe earliest black
migrants were given few
choices of where to settle in
San Mateo County. Real
estate agents generally
restricted minority sales to
low-income areas, a practice
known as redlining. The
whole postwar wave of sub
urbanization had been pred
icated on the ideal of home
ownership. In order to secure
their own roof, yard, picket
fence and two-car garages,
families were forced to invest
their life-savings in their
homes. It was believed that
selling to African Americans
or Orientals" tended to
lower neighborhood proper
ty values.

As a result, developers felt it economic
suicide to sell to minorities in new develop
ments, arguing that they would be unable to
sell the remaining houses. Realtors, aiming to
maintain good images in more prosperous
communities, generally restricted minority
sales to low-income areas. A 1958 survey by
the western regional counsel of the NAACP
found that 19 of the 20 area real estate agen
cies discriminated based on such reasoning.
Because of these restrictive sales practices,
African Americans were effectively relegated to
the older sections of East Palo Alto, East
Menlo Park and South Palo Alto. Several inter
racial groups worked against such discrimina
tory practices but with only moderate success.
Only in a few instances did African Americans
succeeded in purchasing homes in the "wrong
areas — and these instances elicited consider
ably controversy. For the most part, East Palo
Alto remained primarily white and working
class until as late as 1960, with African
Americans clustered in just two "districts."
A much larger number of African-
Americans began migrating south to East Palo
Alto during the early 19605. Since the war, the
central cities had declined considerably; indus
trial employment became increasingly difficult

to find, unemployment among minorities rose
and blight set in. Federally subsidized down
town redevelopment projects gutted out
"slum" neighborhoods in order to pave the way
for corporate city centers. Cities provided little
if any relocation assistance to those gutted out.
And while the new corporate downtowns pro
vided a pool of service sectors jobs downtown,
African Americans with manufacturing and
agricultural skills were only eligible for a small
number of menial positions. By the early
19605, the dearth of employment opportuni
ties and housing shortages inspired thousands
of African Americans to leave. Many followed
the white working-class to the new industrial
parks of the Peninsula.
Realtors manipulated these migrants
for private gain through intensive "blockbust
ing' in 1962, 1963 and 1964. In the process,
they spurred a rapid racial transition in East
Palo Alto. Through housecalls and mailings in
targeted neighborhoods, real estate agents
instilled and capitalized on the fear that prop
erty values would soon plummet because of an
African American in-mignuion. Whites, scared
of losing their life savings, sold their homes at
reduced values. Realtors then proceeded to sell
the houses to African-Americans for up to
twice as much.
In 1964, a Stanford Daily writer

alleged that real estate agents employed anoth
er, less subtle tactic, sending advertisements to
African Americans in the Fillmore district of
San Francisco — one of the city's few all-black
neighborhoods — that extolled the virtues of
the Hast Palo Alto area. In addition, Tree bus
rides were arranged for the Negroes from San
Francisco to East Palo Alto, and then the buses
would drive up and down the streets showing
Fast Palo Alto to the occupants of the buses
and showing the occupants of the buses to the
residents of Hast Palo Alto."
A number of community groups tried
to stem the population turnover. The Alto Park
Community Council, for example, attempted
to hold meetings between the real estate agen
cies and the residents. Another resident group
launched an I m Not Moving flier campaign.
However, the argument of minority in-migra
tion lowering property values proved to be a
self-fulfilling prophecy. Realtors had engi
neered the movement of several thousand
whites and several thousand African
Americans. Between 1960 and 1970, the white
population plummeted from 77 percent to 20
percent. Hast Palo Alto had become racially,
physically, politically and economically mar
ginal i/.ed.

New African-American residents were not
exactly content with conditions as they found
them, although East Palo Alto was a significant
improvement on the South. Ihe neighborhood
improvement organizations and stereotypically
middle-class civic organizations that had animated
Hast Palo Alto during its first decade or so were
succeeded by a set of African-American groups. A
portion of the new residents brought with them a
different model of activism inspired by the Civil
Rights movement. Local chapters of the NAACP
and CORE concentrated on fighting for equity
within existing institutions rather than by creating
services or general community "improvements."
Yet the goal of "incorporation melded just
as well with the desire for political justice:
Incorporation, after .til, signified "community con
trol as well as "community improvement.' Across
the political spectrum, many of Hast Palo Altos
new leaders began to argue for incorporation
throughout the 1960s and 19705. In 1983, .1
group of committed incorporationists finally man
aged to convince a majority of the town residents.
Incorporation may have been the only real
option open to the community. There is, however,
a sad irony to the East Palo Alto case. The com
munity has achieved self-governance but is unable
to provide essential services because of its inade
quate tax base. In the Progressive era, economical
ly diverse communities had incorporated in order
to provide services for their densely-packed citi
zens. In ,i vicious imitation, wealthier postwar sub
urbs incorporated in order to separate themselves
from urban life and avoid subsidizing services for
the poor.
An incorporated East Palo Alto is left tak
ing care of itself. East Palo Alto activist Kemp
Miller has written: "Since Reconstruction, there
has been no planning for black people in
America. In San Mateo County, market forces
relegated minorities to a politically compromised,
physically isolated and economically marginalized
unincorporated area. With stricter planning con
trols after Work! War 11, East Palo Alto might not
have become so handicapped.
