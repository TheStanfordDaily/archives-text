## From White and Blue to Black A
						History of East Palo Alto, 1945-46 
### Alison Post 
East Palo Alto lies on marginal land:
fertile yet flood-prone bavlands that
turn vibrant green with winter rains.
A few relic farmhouses and water
towers survive from an earlier era. Fading sin
gle-family homes with fenced windows now

dominate the landscape. Although University
Avenue has been recently rcpaved, many streets
seem more pothole than road. East Palo Alto
houses many of the Peninsula poor, as well as a
disproportionate fraction of the areas racial
minorities. Although small businesses are mak
ing .1 comeback along the main thoroughfares,
few large stores or industries currently anchor

the city economy. In light of these characteris
tics, residents and outsiders alike have, at dif
ferent points in East Palo Altos history, labeled
the community a "ghetto." East Palo Alto,
however, is the product of a different set of his
torical forces than the archetypal urban ghetto.
Between 1945 and 1965, East Palo
Alto was dramatically transformed along with

the rest of the Peninsula. A postwar economic
boom, new highway construction and the
popularization of the suburban ideal triggered
a wave of new industrial and residential devel
opment south of South San Francisco. I hough
the San Mateo County government imposed
few regulations on the new construction,
developers did not build in a vacuum. Earlier
residential development had established a set

of political jurisdictions and taxation practices
that, in combination with a trend toward
homeownership, significantly shaped postwar
development of the Peninsula. These forces
weighed against the political and economic
health of East Palo Alto, a farming communi
ty turned into a cluster of 1950s working-class
housing tracts at the southern tip of the coun
ty. When African Americans migrated to Hast

Palo Alto from San I rancisco, Oakland and
Richmond during the early 19605, the stage
had already been set for the community's mar
ginalization.
Earlier waves of settlement in San
Mateo County had created a mottled land
scape of municipal and county jurisdictions.
Beginning in the late 19th century, the
Peninsula became a country retreat from the


I'lie Ravenswood Community Store originally served residential tracts established during l ast Palo Alto's post-war housing expansions.


East Palo Alto lies on marginal land": as its residences stretch into areas bordering the San Iranciseo Bay.
