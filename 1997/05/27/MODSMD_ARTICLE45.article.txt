the director of the writing program to the associate director
"There is a certaine enuious Windfucker, that houers vp and downe,
laboriously ingrossing al the air with his luxurious ambition/
-Chapman
The chickenhawks got the chickens. The sharp-shinned deans,
Ravenous for broodlings, swept the yard,
Culling the lot with fiscal insolence.
Hard to admit, they have improved the flock
Professionalizing our little staff
In ways it hadn't dreamed of. Nevertheless,
The squawkings driving me crazy. Variously
Simpering, whining, blustering, filibustering,
The god-forlorn survivors are blowing their horns
To feather their own nests, as our president says,
Windfuckers caught in the springes of their devising,
While the gifted teachers hold a steady calm
That you and 1 would kill for. We improvise . . .
Truth serum to advance, duct tape to retard
The spread of flattery and impudence.
The secretary's rolled clean off the rails,
Her medication has her speaking in tongues,
Next day a cold post-pentecostal coal,
Just one click short of wearing foil in her socks,
A colander on her head, her back fillings humming
The frequencies of a Mexican radio station.
She brings bouquets of roses for my allergies.
I prize your sanity, which you restore
With a new member of your country family,
A gigantic ancient wolfhound gentleman
Wandering coprophagic in your stable —
No relief from the office on this score.
I, 1 would rather be writing another letter,
The outside-in of exile, drowsily
Lounging in a ruined spa on the Black Sea,
I he dregs of empire crumbling in the sun,
Wild men speaking incomprehensibly
Reminding me of home,
while I drink shuddering cups
Of Turkish coffee, bitter
even through a dozen tiny spoonsful of sugar.
