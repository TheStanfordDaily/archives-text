IE JF y should there be an intro
■ WT to the humanities
requirement for all Stanford
V w students?
My answer is that if Stanford is to
maintain its leadership as one of the great
research universities preserving the ideal and
opportunity of a liberal education for all
undergraduates and if it is to continue to
champion the cause of higher education as
something more than specialized knowledge
and vocational training, it had best now retain
and seek to strengthen its Area One program
of introductory instruction in the humanities
and the study of culture, ideas and values. The
faculty of this University has a priority to
uphold Stanford's ongoing, express commit
ment "to introduce students to a broad range
of fields and areas of study' and "to help stu
dents to be responsible members of society"
(Stanford Bulletin).
What should be the goals and rationale
for such a requirement and program? As chair
of the CIV Review and Design Committee,
I ve spent two years in a process by which
we've tried to develop and implement answers.
Our plans to maintain and restructure the
Area One requirement came into being
because the Commission on Undergraduate
I ducation, after gathering information from
faculty and students, recommended broad
review and reform of CIV to the Faculty
Senate in 1995. Requiring students to take
specific courses is, after all, an extremely seri
ous curricular decision that demands a strin
gent sense of academic responsibility. The sen
ate mandated our committee to study and deal
with the most basic issues and problems aris
ing out of the commission's report: namely,
either to scrap or reform the requirement and,

if it stays, to clarify the aims and structure of
Area One.
Essentially, our committee faced three
choices:
• Leave CIV in its status quo.
• Abolish the CIV as a requirement
and let its goals be fulfilled from a selection of
courses in the manner of the other Areas;
• Retain Area One but reform CIV.
We tried to meet the difficulties posed
by the senate resolution head on and not duck
our responsibility. Knowing it would be con
troversial and disturb some dedicated teachers
and university citizens satisfied with the status
quo, we finally chose the third option.
The Faculty Senate asked us to make a
survey of graduating students' opinions about
CIV and its value, and so we designed a set of
questions to be attached to the 1996 senior
survey. These results, the trend of surveys over
the past decade, student attitudes in CUE and
its report, student publications, testimony of
advisers this year, opinions of ASSU-appoint
ed student members of the review committee,
widespread talks with students, together in
consultation with faculty and discussions with
the administration all confirmed for us our
decision to retain Area One and try to remedy
its perceived shortcomings. The 1996 survey
replies gave much testimony to the excellence
of the courses, but they also provided some
disturbing evidence. While nearly three
fourths of those responding thought CIV
should be required, only half found it, in ret
rospect, to have even moderate value (this
finding was confirmed by a Daily poll in earli
er this year). That discrepancy stands out.
Required courses are resented, but that means
all the more that we have to be able to justify
the necessity and efficacy of any requirement

and that required courses and programs must
constantly renew themselves.
What should be done to make Area
One better? In order to meet such concerns,
we have proposed two significant changes:
• lb make the CIV requirement
explicitly an introduction to the humanities
and its disciplinary methods and to rename it
as such in order to give it a clearer focus and
rationale;
• lb organize the requirement on a
one-plus-two structure in which the first quar
ter course would locus on a small number of
texts from different humanistic perspectives
and then various two-quarter "track" courses
of humanistic inquiry would be structured
around defined themes and critical questions.
Our plan directly addresses student
needs and desires that the criticism in their
surveys pinpoints: We mean to give them more
opportunity for choice in Area One courses,
more stress on close reading, more discussion
time in small classes, fewer texts with more
time to read them, more commonality in the
first quarter and more diversity in quarters two
and three in fulfilling the requirement, more
resources for the program and more attention
to insuring equal standards for work loads and
grading across the different courses.
We watit also to face and deal with
important faculty concerns — how faculty
from smaller departments (e.g., art, music,
drama, Asian languages) can mount courses;
how to get more faculty and departments
interested in the program; how precarious is
the present staging of three quarters of instruc
tion in several of the tracks; how to incorpo
rate the writing requirement into Area One
courses; how to bolster faculty morale; how to
remedy the problem that the present director
of Area One, History Prof. Paul Seaver, identi
fies as getting teachers "to go back to the draw
ing board and revise what they've been teach
ing for years.'
Graduating seniors and freshmen alike
complain of too many texts and snippets of
texts too rapidly covered, and we were espe
cially concerned that the ('IV evaluation form
reveals a declining percentage of completed
reading assignments and classes attended over
the year. Reflections on changing preconcep
tions by students coming to Stanford have led
our committee to the conviction that Area
One needs to offer a new, consciously focused
introduction to the humanities as they have
developed in our time and to address centrally
the reasons for, and methods of, humanistic
inquiry and studies.
With regard to the specific implemen
tation of the program our committee has rec
ommended:
• I hat the best and most dynamic
teachers in the humanities continue to be
encouraged and attracted to teach in the Area
One course sequences and th.u even more
University effort and resources be mobilized

towards this goal. (In the first quarter course,
the process of putting it together would
require leading faculty from different disci
plines to discuss, agree and set up particular
goals for the course and plan, articulate and
exchange ideas about how these goals might he
reached; for the next two quarters, the
University must continue to recruit leading
faculty in several departments or from similar
areas of interest and expertise.);
• I hat small group instruction because
it is so central to the programs success, must be
increased from at least two hours per week (as
is now mandated) to at least three hours per
week, and that the size of the sections should
not exceed 15 students;
• I hat the discussion group leaders
should all have doctorates, that their status
should be upgraded to the standing of a three
year, term-limited assistant professor, with the
possibility of a one-year reappointment but no
more and that, following the recommendation
of the 1988 CIV legislation and the model of
some present CIV tracks, these section leaders,
competitive in the job market, should be high
ly qualified, outstanding postdoctoral fellows

identified and chosen for their excellence,
promise and productive capacities in a nation
al search;
• That the freshman writing require
ment should be integrated with the Area One
requirement whenever it can he done in accor
dance with the positive proposal to the provost
from the Writing and Critical Thinking
Program for linking the writing requirement
with Area One and freshman seminars. (We
find evidence that when both requirements are
merged the potential academic and intellectu
al benefit for students is substantially
increased.);
• That the Area One Governance
Committee and its chair must be actively
involved in recruiting courses lor Area One, in
implementation of the requirement, legislation
and program, in working with departments in
the hiring of postdoctoral fellows, in evalua
tion of courses and teachers, and in coordinat
ing Area One with other segments of Stanford
Introductory Studies;
• That we take pains to insure that the
spirit of the 1988 legislation promoting cul
tural diversity and the opening up of the canon
is maintained and strengthened.
One way to focus and implement the
goals of Area One and meet the evolving needs
of modern students is to define the require
ment as something even more inclusive than
CIV and at the same time possibly more man
ageable for practical instruction: namely, an
introduction to the humanities and inquiries
into the nature of human being.
Many students at the end of the 20th
century are skeptical of the value of answering
the questions of why and how the humanities
or culture, ideas and values or art or literature
should be studied, what civilization and
human identity are and what the life of the
mind is. We must meet this problem and skep
ticism head on. The irony is that the humani
ties are more vital than ever and the nature of
inquiry in this scholarly area, like scientific
inquiry, is developing and growing more com
plex as it deals with proliferating materials,
new approaches to knowledge and new forms
of experience.
It seems important, therefore, not to
skip or take for granted the how and why: The
relevance and expanding nature of the human
istic enterprise should be explicitly taught to
all Stanford students in challenging courses of
new design combined with the effective and
often splendid modes of the present program.
We need to continue and make new efforts to
promote and teach awareness of the analytical,
aesthetic and ideological issues that the devel
oping, expanding study of the humanities
involves.
The revised Area One requirement
must stress the need and importance of teach
ing entering college students to read complex
and significant works closely, carefully and
patiently. Of course, much of what we propose
explicitly is already being done by fine and
dedicated teachers, including some who
oppose CIV reform. But again and again, in
the surveys on CIV, the gist of this remark
appears: "Close readings of texts should be fur
ther emphasized even at the expense of the
number of texts read.? The opinion motivating
that statement is almost universal among stu
dents.
Here is just a small sample of typical
answers to our question of how to make CIV
better: "Fewer texts to be studied in depth,"
"fewer works in more depth," "CIV needs to
focus on fewer, more important works," "cut
out the checklist pedagogy and the cultural
tokenism." That is why we recommend focus
ing instruction on intensive, various readings
and study of a limited number of texts in the
first quarter.
A "one-quarter, two-quarter" course
sequence for the three-quarter Area One
requirement can offer basic grounding in the
study of the humanities from multiple per
spectives, followed by a variety of courses in
major subjects and concerns in the humanities
(broadly defined). It allows the process of
detailed instruction to move from the general
to the particular and thematic in humanistic
inquiry. It offers close, common focus on a few
representative texts, chosen from different tra
ditions, interpreted in light of key but different
disciplinary approaches in the humanities
(e.g., aesthetic, historical and philosophical)
and then it moves to more diversified subjects
studied from more specific approaches.
The principle that guides the introduc
tory course is the principle of beginning with
close reading from various points of view and
for multiple purposes? If students can read
thoroughly, from many perspectives, a single
rich and complex work, they can learn to do
the same thing with other texts. The point of
an introductory humanities or CIV course
ought not be illusory coverage but really learn
ing how to approach, see and feel the radiating
qualities of a significant work and then apply
ing that knowledge to new texts and subjects.
I he great humanist Henry David
I horeau wrote "Time is but the stream I go a
fishing in,"and — to continue the metaphor
— the principle of this requirement is not to
give the students examples of each and every
kind of nourishing fish but to teach them the
art of fishing, the reason for fishing, the means

of recognizing and judging fish and then to
take them out fishing.
Once the rationale of a culture or CIV
course was to read particular works forming
the core of civilization, but with the assault on
cultural parochialism and superficiality, a bet
ter one seems to us a broad-gauged study of
what constitutes the humanities, how and why
they matter and change, and what humanistic
inquiry is. Popular conceptions of "culture" or
"civilization" courses now suffer from two
opposite stereotypes, both ultimately shallow?
that such a course tends to feature the out-of
date literature of an

oppressive past and a
white patriarchy ("dead
white males") or, alter
natively, that such a
course should present
the indispensable
authors of Western civ
ilization — or "civiliza
tion" generally — who
form a (or "the")
"canon" and / or our
cultural history.
I strongly sup
port the opening to
study cultural breadth
and a new inclusiveness
enacted in the 1988
Area One requirement,
and 1 cannot conceive
of an introductory
course sequence in
humanistic study that
didn't include, for
instance, multicultural
perspectives, attention
to gender, race, reli
gion, social identities
and significant texts by
women and men of
various cultures and
ethnicity.
It is time to
redefine the core of an
introduction to the
humanities course? It is
not a fixed content, a
token core list of
authors and works that
nobody can quite agree
on or "the common
i n tel lec t ual ex per ie nce
of broadening students'
understanding of cul
ture, cultural diversity
and the process of cul
tural interaction"

(though it could and should foster such expe
rience). Rather, it is the larger study of the
making and manifold understanding of impor
tant articulations and expressions — signifi
cant in the historical and aesthetic memory
that makes the future — of what it is and how
many ways there are to be human.

fies as getting teachers "to go back to the draw
ing board and revise what they've been teach
ing for years.'
Graduating seniors and freshmen alike
complain of too many texts and snippets of
texts too rapidly covered, and we were espe
cially concerned that the ('IV evaluation form
reveals a declining percentage of completed
reading assignments and classes attended over
the year. Reflections on changing preconcep
tions by students coming to Stanford have led
our committee to the conviction that Area
One needs to offer a new, consciously focused
introduction to the humanities as they have
developed in our time and to address centrally
the reasons for, and methods of, humanistic
inquiry and studies.
With regard to the specific implemen
tation of the program our committee has rec
ommended:
• I hat the best and most dynamic
teachers in the humanities continue to be
encouraged and attracted to teach in the Area
One course sequences and th.u even more
University effort and resources be mobilized

towards this goal. (In the first quarter course,
the process of putting it together would
require leading faculty from different disci
plines to discuss, agree and set up particular
goals for the course and plan, articulate and
exchange ideas about how these goals might he
reached; for the next two quarters, the
University must continue to recruit leading
faculty in several departments or from similar
areas of interest and expertise.);
• I hat small group instruction because
it is so central to the programs success, must be
increased from at least two hours per week (as
is now mandated) to at least three hours per
week, and that the size of the sections should
not exceed 15 students;
• I hat the discussion group leaders
should all have doctorates, that their status
should be upgraded to the standing of a three
year, term-limited assistant professor, with the
possibility of a one-year reappointment but no
more and that, following the recommendation
of the 1988 CIV legislation and the model of
some present CIV tracks, these section leaders,
competitive in the job market, should be high
ly qualified, outstanding postdoctoral fellows

identified and chosen for their excellence,
promise and productive capacities in a nation
al search;
• That the freshman writing require
ment should be integrated with the Area One
requirement whenever it can he done in accor
dance with the positive proposal to the provost
from the Writing and Critical Thinking
Program for linking the writing requirement
with Area One and freshman seminars. (We
find evidence that when both requirements are
merged the potential academic and intellectu
al benefit for students is substantially
increased.);
• That the Area One Governance
Committee and its chair must be actively
involved in recruiting courses lor Area One, in
implementation of the requirement, legislation
and program, in working with departments in
the hiring of postdoctoral fellows, in evalua
tion of courses and teachers, and in coordinat
ing Area One with other segments of Stanford
Introductory Studies;
• That we take pains to insure that the
spirit of the 1988 legislation promoting cul
tural diversity and the opening up of the canon
is maintained and strengthened.
One way to focus and implement the
goals of Area One and meet the evolving needs
of modern students is to define the require
ment as something even more inclusive than
CIV and at the same time possibly more man
ageable for practical instruction: namely, an
introduction to the humanities and inquiries
into the nature of human being.
Many students at the end of the 20th
century are skeptical of the value of answering
the questions of why and how the humanities
or culture, ideas and values or art or literature
should be studied, what civilization and
human identity are and what the life of the
mind is. We must meet this problem and skep
ticism head on. The irony is that the humani
ties are more vital than ever and the nature of
inquiry in this scholarly area, like scientific
inquiry, is developing and growing more com
plex as it deals with proliferating materials,
new approaches to knowledge and new forms
of experience.
It seems important, therefore, not to
skip or take for granted the how and why: The
relevance and expanding nature of the human
istic enterprise should be explicitly taught to
all Stanford students in challenging courses of
new design combined with the effective and
often splendid modes of the present program.
We need to continue and make new efforts to
promote and teach awareness of the analytical,
aesthetic and ideological issues that the devel
oping, expanding study of the humanities
involves.
The revised Area One requirement
must stress the need and importance of teach
ing entering college students to read complex
and significant works closely, carefully and
patiently. Of course, much of what we propose
explicitly is already being done by fine and
dedicated teachers, including some who
oppose CIV reform. But again and again, in
the surveys on CIV, the gist of this remark
appears: "Close readings of texts should be fur
ther emphasized even at the expense of the
number of texts read.? The opinion motivating
that statement is almost universal among stu
dents.
Here is just a small sample of typical
answers to our question of how to make CIV
better: "Fewer texts to be studied in depth,"
"fewer works in more depth," "CIV needs to
focus on fewer, more important works," "cut
out the checklist pedagogy and the cultural
tokenism." That is why we recommend focus
ing instruction on intensive, various readings
and study of a limited number of texts in the
first quarter.
A "one-quarter, two-quarter" course
sequence for the three-quarter Area One
requirement can offer basic grounding in the
study of the humanities from multiple per
spectives, followed by a variety of courses in
major subjects and concerns in the humanities
(broadly defined). It allows the process of
detailed instruction to move from the general
to the particular and thematic in humanistic
inquiry. It offers close, common focus on a few
representative texts, chosen from different tra
ditions, interpreted in light of key but different
disciplinary approaches in the humanities
(e.g., aesthetic, historical and philosophical)
and then it moves to more diversified subjects
studied from more specific approaches.
The principle that guides the introduc
tory course is the principle of beginning with
close reading from various points of view and
for multiple purposes? If students can read
thoroughly, from many perspectives, a single
rich and complex work, they can learn to do
the same thing with other texts. The point of
an introductory humanities or CIV course
ought not be illusory coverage but really learn
ing how to approach, see and feel the radiating
qualities of a significant work and then apply
ing that knowledge to new texts and subjects.
I he great humanist Henry David
I horeau wrote "Time is but the stream I go a
fishing in,"and — to continue the metaphor
— the principle of this requirement is not to
give the students examples of each and every
kind of nourishing fish but to teach them the
art of fishing, the reason for fishing, the means

of recognizing and judging fish and then to
take them out fishing.
Once the rationale of a culture or CIV
course was to read particular works forming
the core of civilization, but with the assault on
cultural parochialism and superficiality, a bet
ter one seems to us a broad-gauged study of
what constitutes the humanities, how and why
they matter and change, and what humanistic
inquiry is. Popular conceptions of "culture" or
"civilization" courses now suffer from two
opposite stereotypes, both ultimately shallow?
that such a course tends to feature the out-of
date literature of an

oppressive past and a
white patriarchy ("dead
white males") or, alter
natively, that such a
course should present
the indispensable
authors of Western civ
ilization — or "civiliza
tion" generally — who
form a (or "the")
"canon" and / or our
cultural history.
I strongly sup
port the opening to
study cultural breadth
and a new inclusiveness
enacted in the 1988
Area One requirement,
and 1 cannot conceive
of an introductory
course sequence in
humanistic study that
didn't include, for
instance, multicultural
perspectives, attention
to gender, race, reli
gion, social identities
and significant texts by
women and men of
various cultures and
ethnicity.
It is time to
redefine the core of an
introduction to the
humanities course? It is
not a fixed content, a
token core list of
authors and works that
nobody can quite agree
on or "the common
i n tel lec t ual ex per ie nce
of broadening students'
understanding of cul
ture, cultural diversity
and the process of cul
tural interaction"

(though it could and should foster such expe
rience). Rather, it is the larger study of the
making and manifold understanding of impor
tant articulations and expressions — signifi
cant in the historical and aesthetic memory
that makes the future — of what it is and how
many ways there are to be human.

IE JF y should there be an intro
■ WT to the humanities
requirement for all Stanford
V w students?
My answer is that if Stanford is to
maintain its leadership as one of the great
research universities preserving the ideal and
opportunity of a liberal education for all
undergraduates and if it is to continue to
champion the cause of higher education as
something more than specialized knowledge
and vocational training, it had best now retain
and seek to strengthen its Area One program
of introductory instruction in the humanities
and the study of culture, ideas and values. The
faculty of this University has a priority to
uphold Stanford's ongoing, express commit
ment "to introduce students to a broad range
of fields and areas of study' and "to help stu
dents to be responsible members of society"
(Stanford Bulletin).
What should be the goals and rationale
for such a requirement and program? As chair
of the CIV Review and Design Committee,
I ve spent two years in a process by which
we've tried to develop and implement answers.
Our plans to maintain and restructure the
Area One requirement came into being
because the Commission on Undergraduate
I ducation, after gathering information from
faculty and students, recommended broad
review and reform of CIV to the Faculty
Senate in 1995. Requiring students to take
specific courses is, after all, an extremely seri
ous curricular decision that demands a strin
gent sense of academic responsibility. The sen
ate mandated our committee to study and deal
with the most basic issues and problems aris
ing out of the commission's report: namely,
either to scrap or reform the requirement and,

if it stays, to clarify the aims and structure of
Area One.
Essentially, our committee faced three
choices:
• Leave CIV in its status quo.
• Abolish the CIV as a requirement
and let its goals be fulfilled from a selection of
courses in the manner of the other Areas;
• Retain Area One but reform CIV.
We tried to meet the difficulties posed
by the senate resolution head on and not duck
our responsibility. Knowing it would be con
troversial and disturb some dedicated teachers
and university citizens satisfied with the status
quo, we finally chose the third option.
The Faculty Senate asked us to make a
survey of graduating students' opinions about
CIV and its value, and so we designed a set of
questions to be attached to the 1996 senior
survey. These results, the trend of surveys over
the past decade, student attitudes in CUE and
its report, student publications, testimony of
advisers this year, opinions of ASSU-appoint
ed student members of the review committee,
widespread talks with students, together in
consultation with faculty and discussions with
the administration all confirmed for us our
decision to retain Area One and try to remedy
its perceived shortcomings. The 1996 survey
replies gave much testimony to the excellence
of the courses, but they also provided some
disturbing evidence. While nearly three
fourths of those responding thought CIV
should be required, only half found it, in ret
rospect, to have even moderate value (this
finding was confirmed by a Daily poll in earli
er this year). That discrepancy stands out.
Required courses are resented, but that means
all the more that we have to be able to justify
the necessity and efficacy of any requirement

and that required courses and programs must
constantly renew themselves.
What should be done to make Area
One better? In order to meet such concerns,
we have proposed two significant changes:
• lb make the CIV requirement
explicitly an introduction to the humanities
and its disciplinary methods and to rename it
as such in order to give it a clearer focus and
rationale;
• lb organize the requirement on a
one-plus-two structure in which the first quar
ter course would locus on a small number of
texts from different humanistic perspectives
and then various two-quarter "track" courses
of humanistic inquiry would be structured
around defined themes and critical questions.
Our plan directly addresses student
needs and desires that the criticism in their
surveys pinpoints: We mean to give them more
opportunity for choice in Area One courses,
more stress on close reading, more discussion
time in small classes, fewer texts with more
time to read them, more commonality in the
first quarter and more diversity in quarters two
and three in fulfilling the requirement, more
resources for the program and more attention
to insuring equal standards for work loads and
grading across the different courses.
We watit also to face and deal with
important faculty concerns — how faculty
from smaller departments (e.g., art, music,
drama, Asian languages) can mount courses;
how to get more faculty and departments
interested in the program; how precarious is
the present staging of three quarters of instruc
tion in several of the tracks; how to incorpo
rate the writing requirement into Area One
courses; how to bolster faculty morale; how to
remedy the problem that the present director
of Area One, History Prof. Paul Seaver, identi
fies as getting teachers "to go back to the draw
ing board and revise what they've been teach
ing for years.'
