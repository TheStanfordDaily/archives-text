IE JF y should there be an intro
■ WT to the humanities
requirement for all Stanford
V w students?
My answer is that if Stanford is to
maintain its leadership as one of the great
research universities preserving the ideal and
opportunity of a liberal education for all
undergraduates and if it is to continue to
champion the cause of higher education as
something more than specialized knowledge
and vocational training, it had best now retain
and seek to strengthen its Area One program
of introductory instruction in the humanities
and the study of culture, ideas and values. The
faculty of this University has a priority to
uphold Stanford's ongoing, express commit
ment "to introduce students to a broad range
of fields and areas of study' and "to help stu
dents to be responsible members of society"
(Stanford Bulletin).
What should be the goals and rationale
for such a requirement and program? As chair
of the CIV Review and Design Committee,
I ve spent two years in a process by which
we've tried to develop and implement answers.
Our plans to maintain and restructure the
Area One requirement came into being
because the Commission on Undergraduate
I ducation, after gathering information from
faculty and students, recommended broad
review and reform of CIV to the Faculty
Senate in 1995. Requiring students to take
specific courses is, after all, an extremely seri
ous curricular decision that demands a strin
gent sense of academic responsibility. The sen
ate mandated our committee to study and deal
with the most basic issues and problems aris
ing out of the commission's report: namely,
either to scrap or reform the requirement and,

if it stays, to clarify the aims and structure of
Area One.
Essentially, our committee faced three
choices:
• Leave CIV in its status quo.
• Abolish the CIV as a requirement
and let its goals be fulfilled from a selection of
courses in the manner of the other Areas;
• Retain Area One but reform CIV.
We tried to meet the difficulties posed
by the senate resolution head on and not duck
our responsibility. Knowing it would be con
troversial and disturb some dedicated teachers
and university citizens satisfied with the status
quo, we finally chose the third option.
The Faculty Senate asked us to make a
survey of graduating students' opinions about
CIV and its value, and so we designed a set of
questions to be attached to the 1996 senior
survey. These results, the trend of surveys over
the past decade, student attitudes in CUE and
its report, student publications, testimony of
advisers this year, opinions of ASSU-appoint
ed student members of the review committee,
widespread talks with students, together in
consultation with faculty and discussions with
the administration all confirmed for us our
decision to retain Area One and try to remedy
its perceived shortcomings. The 1996 survey
replies gave much testimony to the excellence
of the courses, but they also provided some
disturbing evidence. While nearly three
fourths of those responding thought CIV
should be required, only half found it, in ret
rospect, to have even moderate value (this
finding was confirmed by a Daily poll in earli
er this year). That discrepancy stands out.
Required courses are resented, but that means
all the more that we have to be able to justify
the necessity and efficacy of any requirement

and that required courses and programs must
constantly renew themselves.
What should be done to make Area
One better? In order to meet such concerns,
we have proposed two significant changes:
• lb make the CIV requirement
explicitly an introduction to the humanities
and its disciplinary methods and to rename it
as such in order to give it a clearer focus and
rationale;
• lb organize the requirement on a
one-plus-two structure in which the first quar
ter course would locus on a small number of
texts from different humanistic perspectives
and then various two-quarter "track" courses
of humanistic inquiry would be structured
around defined themes and critical questions.
Our plan directly addresses student
needs and desires that the criticism in their
surveys pinpoints: We mean to give them more
opportunity for choice in Area One courses,
more stress on close reading, more discussion
time in small classes, fewer texts with more
time to read them, more commonality in the
first quarter and more diversity in quarters two
and three in fulfilling the requirement, more
resources for the program and more attention
to insuring equal standards for work loads and
grading across the different courses.
We watit also to face and deal with
important faculty concerns — how faculty
from smaller departments (e.g., art, music,
drama, Asian languages) can mount courses;
how to get more faculty and departments
interested in the program; how precarious is
the present staging of three quarters of instruc
tion in several of the tracks; how to incorpo
rate the writing requirement into Area One
courses; how to bolster faculty morale; how to
remedy the problem that the present director
