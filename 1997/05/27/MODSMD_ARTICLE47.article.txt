### Kenneth Fields 
with a line from Basil Bunting
"It might be from a handbook on recorders.
For one thing, its on the air, you can hear music,
knowing inflected by the ear. Not wood,
not even mouthpiece but the lovely fipple
C Hev, that's like nipple," my little daughter laughs),
and the conveyer of this joys a player,
whose breathing tunes the hollow that she fills,
empties and fills again. 1 am caught up
in the roll of the hull, this ecstasy of naming,
this gathering up of more than fifty years
in a wide harbor, a life made up of words,
all of them here before we finally heard them,
and consolation rolling upon the tide:
As the players breath warms the fipple the tone clears
Ardor, attend us as our stars descend.
