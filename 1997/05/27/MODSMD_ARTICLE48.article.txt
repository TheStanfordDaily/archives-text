Klimt got it right
Down on their knees
Gold enraptured robes
punctuating plush nakedness
golden sworls like lovers wrapped
inward, spiraling into each other
curve upon trembling curve.
Not like this
Limp and forgettable
our loving like the morning's toast
and you do not even dampen my soul
with a glimpse of seeking tendrils
Klimt got it right
in the surrender and the control
in the enduring ache and onyx boxes
in they eyelids languorous as moons
after the initial kisses
like genuflectors exuding
lilies and pansies
erupting in golden spirals
I imagine that Klimt, had he painted our lovemaking
it would hang like an old woman's
empty breasts, worn of suckling children
not lovers, and a body touched more by time
than the caresses of hands.
