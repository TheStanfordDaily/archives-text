The marsh grass breaks
at the Sound's edge, the squatter squats.
She marks—
the breath between
laps of the tide.
When she is ready,
she will reach a practiced hand to
the water rolling in.
It's a stretch—
the failing roots below her feet
dangle down and rag the slight bank, eroding
She will hope, that
by the time her fingers breach
the measure of the surface
returning,
the waves will have risen to
her hand, extended.

The crabs leave their home in crabpots;
flies and mosquitoes
take to the surface with ease,
her arm s length out.
But she catches the ebb, misses the flow
and strikes short—
leaving tracks in the shore,
erased by a still abiding motion.
She coughs—
will not try again; rolls back
out, and breezes through the mangling thicket,
