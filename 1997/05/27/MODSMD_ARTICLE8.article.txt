### 
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Honoring the
nation's war dead, President Clinton yesterday
called upon this generation to "redeem that sacri
fice" and help build a democratic Europe united in
peace.
The United States must build on the legacy of
the Marshall Plan by "extending the reach of
security and prosperity to the new democracies in
Europe that once were on the other side in the
Cold War," he said at a Memorial Day ceremony
at Arlington National Cemetery.
"We must create the institutions and the
understandings that will advance the security and
prosperity of the American people for the next 50
years," Clinton said.
He made his remarks hours before departing
for France to sign a landmark Russian-NATO

pact and celebrate the fiOth anniversary of the
Marshall Plan, the reconstruction program that
revived a devastated Europe after World War 11.
Clinton also will visit the Netherlands and
Britain.
At each stop, he will trace Europe's evolution
since the United States helped the continent rise
from the ashes of war.
Clinton said the nation must remember the
lessons of those who gave their lives in World War
II and those who worked to make sure the United
States would prevail in the Cold War.
"Today our generation has been given a pre
cious chance to redeem that sacrifice and service
to build an undivided, democratic European
continent at peace for the very first time in his
tory," he said.
