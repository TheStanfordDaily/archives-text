# French prime minister to resign
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” Scrambling to keep the right in
power after its worst election defeat in nearly four
decades, France's deeply unpopular prime minister,
Alain Juppe, announced yesterday that he will
resign.
The move came a day after the governing center
right coalition suffered major losses in first-round
legislative elections.
Juppe's planned resignation was a last-minute
bid to reverse the tide before Sunday's runoff
vote.
"Voters have just given us a serious warning,"
said Juppe, the man President Jacques Chirac once
called "the best among us."
"A new era must begin now. ... A new team led
by a new prime minister is needed," Juppe said in a
televised message to his supporters, broadcast later
on national television.
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, in a French televi

sion interview, called Juppe's impending departure
"an indication of the crisis" and said a change of pol
icy was in order.
Former Socialist Culture Minister Jack Lang said
Juppe's announcement indicates "the panic which
exists in the current government in the face of the
massive rejection."
In office since Chirac was elected president in
May 1995, Juppe had lost support even among his
own. Former conservative Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua publicly disparaged him as the president's
"top aide."
Juppe indicated he would remain in his post until
after Sunday's runoff, which could put the opposi
tion Socialists back in government four years after
they were chased out in an overwhelming legislative
defeat.
"I'll fight the right fight to the end," Juppe said.
"After that, I'll consider that my job is done."
