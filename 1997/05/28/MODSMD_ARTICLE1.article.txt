# Formal charges filed
## Casper's letter requests dismissal of tenured prof 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
In a May 2 letter to Statistics Prof. Brad Efron, the
chair of the Advisory Board of the Academic Council,
University President Gerhard Casper filed formal
charges against Adolf Pfefferbaum, a tenured professor
of psychiatry, requesting that the board dismiss him for
"neglecting academic duties."
The board plans to honor Pfefierbaum's request for
a public hearing, Efron told The Daily.
Pfefferbaum occupied a teaching position at the Vet
erans Affairs Hospital in Palo Alto and served as a prin
cipal investigator of several major grants, including
ones devoted to work at Stanford's Mental Health Clin
ical Research Center.
In July, Pfefferbaum resigned from the VA hospital,
charging intolerable working conditions but specifying

that he was not leaving his faculty position at Stanford.
The hospital and the Medical School have an affilia
tion agreement, and some Stanford faculty members
are assigned to work at the hospital.
Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer, Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Casper all formally rejected Pfeffer
baum's reasoning before the end of last summer. Unless
he decides to return to VA employment, they wrote to
Pfefferbaum, he has effectively resigned from the facul
ty-
"l urge you either to return to your prior status as an
employee at the VA or to confirm in writing your retire
ment from Stanford on or before July 31,1996," wrote
Rice on July 17. "In the meantime, I want to reiterate
that because you are no longer an active employee at the
VA, the University considers that you no longer occupy
your Stanford faculty position."
On Jan. 28, however, the Superi
or Court of Santa Clara County dis
agreed with the administrators. Pf
efferbaum did not resign from the
faculty, concluded judge Peter
Stone, but was dismissed by the
University "without the hearing be
fore the Advisory Board to which he
was entitled" in accordance with
policies outlined in the Faculty
Handbook.
Pending such a hearing by the
board, Stone ordered that "Pfeffer
baum shall be reinstated as profes
sor of the School of Medicine effec
tive Sept. 1, 1996, with the full
rights, txmefits and privileges of a
tenured member of the Stanford
faculty."
Casper is now presenting a case
for Pfefferbaum's dismissal to the
board, as the handbook provides.
"Pfefferbaum is no longer per
forming his duties as a faculty mem
ber" assigned to the VA, Casper al
leges.
The handbook allows discipli
nary action against faculty mem
bers for "neglecting the academic
duties that he or she has undertak
en to perform within (he Universi
ty."
Dismissal is the most severe
sanction against faculty available to
the administration.
The administration has declined

to comment on the specifics of the
case.
"We view the process as confi
dential," said Director of University
Communications Terry Shepard.
This would mark the second time
in the history of the University that
the administration has attempted to
remove a tenured professor. In
1971, the board dismissed English
Prof. Bruce Franklin who took part
in violent anti-war protests.
Academic duty
Casper holds that Pfefferbaum's
duties are at the VA, arguing that
the professor was originally ap
pointed in 1974 to fill a newly creat
ed position there. His salary and
benefits were largely provided by
the VA, Casper added.
Not quite, contends PfefTerbaum
in a May 16 response to Casper's
charges.
"No written or oral argument I
have ever had with Stanford has
conditioned my employment on
being a paid employee of the VA or
stated that my tenure was cotermi
nous with employment by the VA,"
PfefTerbaum wrote. "A number of
faculty at the VA do have contracts
with Stanford making their employ
ment coterminous with VA employ
ment; mine is not one of them."
"I would never have applied for
the position which Stanford adver
tised was initially located at the VA
had I not believed that I would be
come a tenured member of the
Stanford faculty indue course
with no limitation on the rights of

a faculty member by reason of an
assignment to the VA," he added.
Never has he neglected his du
ties, holds Pfefferbaum, because he
has been willing "at all times" to
work at the VA on "without com
pensation" (WOC) status. Unless al
ternative arrangements are made,
the University pays for the entire
salary when Stanford faculty work
at the VA on without compensation
status, picking up the tab for what
the hospital used to pay.
Only after the University failed
to renominate him for that status
had he been forced out of the VA, Pf
efferbaum argued.
"After retiring from paid employ
ment by the VA, I continued to per
form all my academic duties on a
daily basis until I was ordered to give
up my office and laboratory space
there when the VA changed its posi
tion and terminated my WOC status
â€” I believe in collusion with Stan
ford.
"Despite my request, Stanford
lias refused to nominate me for
WOC status at the |VAI," he wrote.
Why has the University refused
to nominate him for the status?
Without being a paid employee of
the VA, "I created a financial burden
for the University," Pfefferbaum
said.
"This case is about money, not
neglect of academic duties," he
added.
Problems at the VA
Missing from Casper's charges
are any references to the circum

stances leading to Pfefferbaum's
resignation from the VA, which
largely concern the actions of
Richard Mazze, chief of staff at the
VA and associate dean of the Med
ical School.
Mazze had taken "actions
which effectively denied academic
freedom to Stanford faculty as
signed to the VA," Pfefferbaum re
iterated in his response to
Casper's charges.
When Pfefferbaum and Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Brant Wenegrat
filed a grievance against Mazze
and other deans at the Medical
School, Rice declined to interfere
in what she considered VA affairs.
"I continue to believe that
these matters remain properly
within the scope of VA grievance
procedures and outside the scope
of University's grievance policy,"
the provost wrote on March 18,
1996.
According to Pfefferbaum,
"This decision effectively removed
all protections ordinarily enjoyed
by Stanford faculty from improper
conduct by their colleagues and
administrative superiors both at
the IVAI and Stanford."
"The University can't have it
both ways, arguing on the one
hand that my employment duties
at the [VA] were 'outside' the Uni
versity for the purposes of the
grievance procedure, yet my em
ployment at the VA was somehow
an 'academic' duty 'within' the
University for purposes of faculty
discipline," he wrote.
