## Leaders of Egypt and Israel discuss Mideast peace 
### 
SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt
(AP) — The leaders of Egypt and
Israel met for two hours yesterday
in hopes of reviving Middle East
peace talks and declared more
work was needed to break a two
month deadlock in the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations.
"We discussed ways to put the
peace process between us and the
Palestinians back on track,"
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said. "This was a posi
tive beginning, but we need to do
more work."
Netanyahu and Egyptian Pres
ident Hosni Mubarak told
reporters they expected further
meetings, but would give no
details of proposals discussed yes
terday in their meeting near this
Red Sea resort.
Mubarak said he will make
every effort to invite Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to a future
three-way meeting.
Netanyahu and Mubarak last
met March 5, two weeks before
Israel broke ground on a Jewish
housing project in an area of
Jerusalem the Palestinians want
as a future capital.
Netanyahu yesterday refused
to confirm or deny Israeli media
reports that he was offering to
compromise on the housing dis
pute.
Israel's Yediot Ahronot news
paper said Netanyahu planned to
propose that Israel complete pre
liminary work — such as roads
and pipes — for the Har Homa
housing project.
Israel would then halt con
struction on the project and start

building a parallel housing project
for Arabs, according to the news
paper. After preliminary work was
done there, work would proceed
on both projects, the paper said.
Netanyahu aide David Bar-
Illan called the report "specula
tion."
"We are not thinking of any
compromise on the Har Homa
issue," Bar-Illan said. "The one
part of it which is realistic is build
ing more for the Palestinians in
the same area."
In any case, Arafat said Pales
tinians would agree to resume
peace talks only if Israel stops
building in disputed areas entire
ty-
"The most important thing
now is to stop the violation of
agreements. The construction . . .
is one of the gravest violations,"
Arafat told Israel's Haaretz news
paper. "The problem is not build
ing for Palestinians but halting
the settlements."
Netanyahu has refused Arab
demands to stop settlement build
ing.
The prime minister called his
meeting with Mubarak "a first
step."
"We are in the beginning of a
process," Netanyahu said. "In no
sense would 1 characterize what
went on here today as a failure."
Mubarak said he planned to
meet again with Netanyahu
"maybe in the coming few weeks."
Egypt and Jordan are the only
two Arab countries at peace with
Israel and, with U.S. support,
have been trying to help broker a
comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.
