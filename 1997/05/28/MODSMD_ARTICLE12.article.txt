# Yeltsin signs NATO agreement
## Russia will no longer aim warheads at NATO countries, Yeltsin adds 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Calling it "a
victory for reason," Russian
President Boris Yeltsin signed a
historic security agreement yes
terday with the 16 NATO allies
and made a stunning pledge to
no longer target Russia's nucle
ar weapons at their people.
"Everything that is aimed at
countries present here. All of
those weapons are going to have
their warheads removed," the
Russian president said in
impromptu remarks, via an
interpreter, after the NATO
signing ceremony at the Elysee
Palace.
Later, Russian Foreign Min
ister Yevgeny Primakov said
Yeltsin meant that nuclear mis
siles won't be targeted at facili
ties in countries that signed the
Russia-NATO pact.
"In the future, talks will be
conducted to remove the war
heads from those missiles alto
gether. But this is subject of
negotiation," Primakov told
ITAR-Tass news agency in
Paris.
Yeltsin's bold unilateral move
rocked the sedate signing cere
mony. His statement clearly
caught American and NATO
officials off guard, and they
scrambled to understand its sig
nificance.
White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said the United
States was "not exactly sure
what he meant," but U.S. offi
cials later were told what Yeltsin
had in mind. McCurry billed
Yeltsin's statement as "posi
tive. ... It is a confidence-build
ing measure not to have these
missiles targeted — or de-target
ed in their ready posture."

The Russian leader was the
focus of the day. He had set aside
his oft-voiced concerns about
NATO's plan to expand into
Central and Eastern Europe and
signed the document setting out
Moscow's future, closer rela
tions with the West.
Specifically, he said, the
accord opens new opportunities
for settling crises, reducing
weapons of mass destruction
and deflecting threats to Euro
pean security.
With wide smiles and reas
suring pats on the arm, Yeltsin,
NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, President Clinton and
other allied leaders signed the
document in a conference room

richly decorated in red and gold,
with NATO member and Rus
sian flags directly behind. It
was the same room used last
year to sign the Bosnia peace
accords.
After the agreement was
signed, Yeltsin shook hands with
Solana and kissed his cheek.
President Clinton said he
looked forward to "a new centu
ry with a new Russia and a new
NATO."
He said the new NATO will be
the strongest military alliance in
history, one which will work for
peace, not division.
"This NATO will work with
Russia, not against it . . . these
are new times.. . . The veil of

hostility between East and West
is lifted," he said.
Right after Clinton spoke,
Yeltsin took the podium again to
make his announcement on Rus
sian targeting of weapons.
"It was a unilateral statement
by Yeltsin, the meaning of which
we'll have to explore with the
Russians," Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Rerger,
told reporters.
Under a January 1994 U.S.-
Russian agreement, those two
nations no longer aim their long
range nuclear missiles at each
other. Yeltsin's remarks were
being interpreted as an exten
sion of that to the other NATO
nations.
