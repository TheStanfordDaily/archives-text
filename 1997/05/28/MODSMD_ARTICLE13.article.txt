# Clinton may face sexual harassment lawsuit while in office
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court ruled yesterday that Paula Jones
can pursue her sex-harassment lawsuit
against President Clinton while he is in
office — but left room for a trial judge to
delay proceedings if they interfere with
the president's duties.
The Constitution does not shield the
president from having to face lawsuits
over acts unrelated to his official duties,
the justices ruled unanimously in a case
that already has been a major embarrass
ment to the president.
Jones' lawyers exulted over the ruling
and a friend of Jones said the former
Arkansas state employee "just screamed
and yelled and cried" with delight. The

lawyers said an apology and admission
from Clinton might still head off a trial.
White House spokesman Mike McCur
ry, in Paris where Clinton was meeting
with NATO allies and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, said, "We're not in a posi
tion to analyze the opinion." He said the
president "continued to conduct the
nation's business yesterday."
The president's private lawyer, Robert
S. Bennett, said in a prepared statement,
"While we wish that the Supreme Court
had accepted our separation of powers
arguments, we are confident that the
case ultimately will be resolved in the
president's favor."
The president has denied Jones' alle

gation that he propositioned her in an
Arkansas hotel room in 1991.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for
the court, said, "A stay of either the trial
or (pretrial fact-finding) might be justi
fied by considerations that do not require
the recognition of any constitutional
immunity."
"The high respect that is owed to the
office of the chief executive, though not
justifying a rule of categorical immunity,
is a matter that should inform the con
duct of' the entire proceeding," Stevens
said.
Stevens said the court did not decide
whether a judge could compel the presi
dent to appear in court at any specific

time or place.
"Wo assume that tho testimony of
the president . . . may be taken at the
White House at a time that will accom
modate his busy schedule, and that, if a
trial is held, there would be no necessi
ty for the president to attend in person,
though he could elect to do so," Stevens
wrote.
Jones, who has been living in Los
Angeles for about three years with her
husband, was described by a friend as
jubilant.
Jones' lawyers, Gilbert Davis and
Joseph Cammarata, called the ruling a
resounding victory. It shows that "she
was willing to stand up against privilege,

power and position to redeem her reputa
tion," Davis said.
"She has said that she wants her day
in court," Cammarata said. "Finally
we've got a resounding 'yes, go for
ward.' "
A settlement of the case without trial
might be possible, the two lawyers said.
"Some kind of admission (by Clinton). . .
and something that could be interpreted
as an apology would certainly go a long
way" toward Jones' goal of restoring her
reputation, Davis said.
"Paula has always felt that the courts
would find that no man is above the law,"
said Cindy 1 layes, head of a fund set up to
pay Jones' legal expenses.
