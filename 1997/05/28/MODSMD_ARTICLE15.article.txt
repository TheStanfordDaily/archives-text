# FBI lab work in Oklahoma bombing case was flawed, defense witness says
## 
### 
DENVER (AP) — A key piece of evi
dence in the Oklahoma City bombing
was found by a civilian and the FBI ini
tially didn't want to use it in court, an
FBI scientist who has criticized the
agency's lab testified yesterday.
Dr. Frederic Whitehurst said he was
told by FBI agent David Williams that a
panel of the Ryder truck, which con
tained crystals of ammonium nitrate
the main bomb component — couldn't
be used because it hadn't been found by
an investigator and therefore could have
been contaminated.
He said Williams told him, "It's a
moot point because a civilian brought
it in. We've got a problem with the
chain of custody so we're not going to
use it."
But the FBI did use the evidence, and
denied it was found by a civilian. FBI
chemist Ron Kelly testified earlier this
month that the truck panel was
removed from the scene and later
replaced for a photograph.
Whitehurst, testifying as Timothy
McVeigh's defense launched an assault
on evidence handling in the case, also
questioned how the ammonium nitrate
crystals survived on the panel after a

heavy rain the night of the bombing.
"I don't know how it could be on that
evidence. It doesn't make sense to me,"
he said.
Whitehurst said there was also "data
missing" from the FBI analysis of the
crystals. "I find it an enigma, what I was
looking at," he said.
He also said the explosives lab was
itself contaminated, according to an
examination he led before the bombing
that "found that there wore some places
that had four or five, maybe that had
some organic explosives (contamina
tion)."
Contamination was found in the evi
dence handling and storage areas, where
explosives residue later was found on
McVeigh's clothing, knife and earplugs,
he said.
The possibility of contamination was
serious, yet the FBI to his knowledge
conducted no further studies, White
hurst testified.
McVeigh could face the death penalty
if convicted of murder and conspiracy
charges in the April I!J, 15)95, bombing
of the Alfred I'. Murrah Federal Build
ing. The blast killed 168 people and
injured 500 in the worst act of terrorism

to take place within the United States.
Whitehurst said the KIM had no pro
cedure in April 1995 for checking for
contamination. He said agents return
ing from the bomb range didn't change,
and said there was a high likelihood they
contaminated the lab.
Williams, the agent who was cen
sured for his handling of evidence, was
the first defense witness called as the
trial resumed altera three-day break.
The explosives specialist, assigned as
the crime scene manager an hour after
the bombing, aid lour or five members
of the agency's explosives unit were at
the scene when he arrived and he didn't
know who had been in charge up to that
point.
He agreed with defense attorney
Chris Tritico, who noted it was impossi
ble to tell from records who checked in
each piece of evidence at the bombing
scene, that no one's initials appeared to
be on .any of t he evidence.
Tritico asked if the FBI could deter
mine who checked in an item of evidence
if there w;i.s ;i later question about possi
ble contamination.
"Not without some investigation,"
Williams replied.
