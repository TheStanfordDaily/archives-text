Writing an honors thesis
is a fitting way to satisfy
our academic passions

That giant sucking
sound heard around campus
the past two weeks wasn't
more construction noise but a col
lective sigh of relief from the
seniors completing honors theses.
And while no one can say they've
enjoyed such senior sounds which,
aside from sighs, have usually con
sisted of moaning, whining and
grumbling, it's not fair to say that
the thesis-writing experience has
been a painful one. Rather, the hon
ors thesis — a year-long devotion to
one specialized area of research —
is a very worthy culmination of four
(or so) years of academic study.
Of course, just like any other
Stanford venture, writing an hon
ors thesis cannot be for everyone.
Some students go overseas while
others stay on campus for the
entire stint. Some pursue cotermi
nal degrees while some leave with
only a bachelor's diploma. And
finally, some would argue, an hon
ors thesis consumes so much of a
senior's time that it could detract
from the overall liberal education
that is the hallmark of this school.
Nevertheless, about 30 percent
of graduating students do choose to
pursue a serious independent

research program. Here are some
reasons why writing a thesis might
be the best way to say good-bye to
your undergraduate years.
First of all, the undergraduate
education, for the most part, pro
vides a very broad spectrum of
knowledge and views, even within
one's chosen field of study. Thus
you can complete all the courses in
your major without knowing a lot
about any particular subject. How
ever, by delving into both the factu
al minutiae and larger theoretical
trends of one issue, you can get a
sense of "academic mastery."
Second, for those considering
continuing that "mastery" sensa
tion (i.e., graduate school), the hon
ors thesis is an excellent starting
point. Those research techniques
and long nights spent in Green
Library should help you decide if
you want to spend the greater part
of the next decade studying.
Finally, and perhaps tragically,
the honors thesis might be the last
chance at sustained academic
involvement in some students'
lives. We presumably entered Stan
ford with academic passion (and
presumably still have it) but life
outside the Farm will presumably
not often satisfy it. An honors the
sis is a fitting way to commit to
"academia" before letting yourself
go into the "real world."
So above the din of senior com
plaint, find a quiet place and think
about writing a thesis. It might be
the ending you're looking for.
