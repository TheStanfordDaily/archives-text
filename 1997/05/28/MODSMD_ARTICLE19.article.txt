Bob, storey, kimball
and . . . Mikhail Gorbachev?
When the former presi
dent of the USSR spoke at Stan
ford, demand for the 600 available
student tickets was so great that
the University resorted to a com

the annual spring housing Draw.
Because tickets were not
assigned to specific individuals,
students immediately began to talk
of scalping their tickets for as
much as $75.
Too bad one can't get on the
Row that cheaply.
