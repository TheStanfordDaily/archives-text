# Committee denies tenure for Gupta
## 
### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
The Office of the Dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences notified Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Cupta last Friday that his appeal for tenure had been
denied.
Gupta will now take his appeal to the level of the
provost. " 1 feel the real process is going to begin now,"
he said.
Gupta's tenure process had been stopped at the
dean's level in January despite having unanimous en
dorsement of the Anthropology Department. The sec
ond denial came from a 1 lumanities and Sciences spe

cial committee appointed by John Shoven, the
school's dean, to review Gupta's appeal of the deci
sion.
Few were surprised by the recent denial.
"The students are really disappointed," said senior
Aly Remtulla, a spokesperson for tlu* student group
Undergraduates for the Tenure of Akhil Gupta.
"There was (he hope that maybe this time the decision
would be more fair, but.. . the students also had ex
pected this because all of the biased evidence wasn't
removed."
The alleged biased evidence comprises at least two


Gupta
letters that were kept in Gupta's
tenure file against his wishes.
Shoven had denied Gupta's re
quest for removal of the files.
Gupta said these materials
would have guaranteed a biased re
view regardless of "how fair,
broad-minded or even-tempered
the committee was."
At least one of the letters in
question was written by a person
distant from his discipline, accord
ing to Gupta and had used inap
propriate criteria to evaluate his
work. "I can safely say that none of
the most famous anthropologists"
would have agreed with the state
ments made in [the most negative]
letters, he said.
Gupta identified two flaws in
the tenure process that he felt
should be remedied. The first ad
dressed the divisions present with

in academic disciplines.
"If I know that somebody is
against interpretative anthropolo
gy, and that person is elected (to
the review process), I can be sure
that person will give negative re
views.
"Those kind of (selection) proce
dures should not be left to the dis
cretion of the person who is over
seeing the (tenure) process," he
added.
According to Gupta, the field of
sociocultural anthropology changes
with great rapidity, adding that it is
often very difficult for someone to
keep abreast of the shifts in the dis
cipline. Consequently, "people be
come intolerant of newer work," he
said.
"They make sweeping condem
nations of newer work because they
feel the discipline is abandoning
them."
Gupta said it is his suspicion that
this fact played a role in his tenure
denial.
The second flaw Gupta identi

fied had to do with the process of ap
peal. "One shouldn't have to file
grievance at the level that the deci
sion was made," Gupta said. "There
is no incentive for people who made
the (original) decision to reverse
themselves. There is every incen
tive not to."
In addition, there has been grow
ing concern among the faculty deal
ing with the amount of intervention
being exercised by deans in the
tenure process. Gupta said there is
"widespread belief' that the Dean's
Office is on a trend of assuming
larger roles in these decisions.
"A lot of people in the faculty feel
that intellectual agendas are being
shaped by people who are relatively
distant from the field or discipline
beingjudged," he added.
"My research has broken new
ground, but that is being challenged
by people in the dean's office who
don't know anthropology," Gupta
said, "but feel that they have a bet
ter sense of what is revolutionary
scholarship as opposed to what is

just humdrum scholarship."
Gupta said he hopes that his ap
peal to the provost will be conduct
ed free of the biased material and
problems which he felt had belea
guered his tenure process at the
dean's level.
Shoven would not comment on
Gupta's allegations but supported
the validity of the tenure process.
"We designed the process to be as
fair as possible," Shoven said. "We
gave the benefit of the doubt to the
candidate in the way we structured
the reconsideration, and we put a
tremendous amount of effort into
it.
"We took our job very seriously,"
he added.
Student supporters for Gupta's
tenure said they will be holding a
rally Thursday at noon where they
will march from the Main Quad to
White Plaza in protest of the latest
decision.
Provost Condoleezza Rice is ex
pected to hand down her final deci
sion regarding this matter June 15.
