Price and justice do not correlate for world's poor

IN REGARD TO Gil Serrano's
Thursday letter, I commend him
for consciously thinking about
where the products he buys come from
Unfortunately, while boycotting Nike
might be enough to appease our guilt
for a little while, it will do little to
actually improve the lives of the
world's exploited poor.
Serrano may have purchased another
pair of shoes instead of Nikes, but I'd
give 100-to-l odds that the other pair
was also made by a multinational corpo
ration exploiting cheap labor in a devel

oping country. And just because the
other shoes were cheaper means little;
just economics is certainly not the same
as thrift economics.
By feeding multinational corpora
tions we are inevitably a force against
the poor. Globalism may provide cheap
er gadgets, but it ends up pushing those
at the bottom deeper into poverty. The
Green Revolution may have produced
more food worldwide, but it also has
worsened rural poverty, forcing subsis
tence farmers into the cities and dis
ease-ridden slums. And the very pres-

ence of multinationals encourages
countries to lower their minimum wage
and environmental standards to attract
foreign investment.
Such investment may help the well
off in those countries, but the poor are
further marginalized. Ever wonder why
multinationals like working with
authoritarian dictators that crush
unions? The poor are oppressed so we
can live indulgently while we paternal
istically think we're actually helping
them "develop."
What must be called into question is

our whole lifestyle of overconsumption.
If we claim to be so intelligent at Stan
ford, why do we buy into the advertise
ments like everyone else? Do we really
think we're going to find meaning in life
through abundance of possessions? We
need a radical inner change to simplicity
â€” for our own sake, for the environ
ment and for the future. We need to
send a message to the world of what is
"cool": that justice is a higher value
than materialism.
