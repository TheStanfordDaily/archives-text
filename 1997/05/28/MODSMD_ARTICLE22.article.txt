## Long distance run-around 
### 
SO HERE'S THE deal: We're gradu
ating in June, and I'm moving to
New York City, and my boyfriend of
three years is staying in the Bay Area.
We're basically going to continue our
relationship, long-distance, for as long as
it lasts. Or until one of us convinces the
other to move.
Needless to say, this has been a pretty
major issue in my life for the past year or
so, and a lot of my friends are dealing with
it, too. Seems like the nature of the job
market these days is that you have to be
prepared to go anywhere. In the case of
Max and me, he's a computer guy, and
Silicon Valley was the most obvious place
to look for a job. As for me, I want to get
some sort of work writing and editing,
preferably at a magazine, and New York
is where the industry is.
Both of us spent a lot of time trying to
convince the other to move with them but
to no avail. I'm dying to live in a fast
paced, massively cultural city. Max, on
the other hand, thinks living in NYC
would be loud, stressful and expensive.
He wants to stay in the Golden State, and,
like most California residents, he has a
horror of snow and all things eastward. I,
on the other hand, actually appreciate the
seasons, take some masochistic pleasure
in the hardline New York attitude and
swear up and down that I will rot if I have
to live in the suburbs any longer.
The other complicating factor is that 1
can't imagine being without him. We've

been through Stanford together —
through CIV and summers and papers
and programs, from a one-room double to
a one-bedroom apartment. We're still a
starry-eyed, incredibly happy and annoy
ingly cute couple, and we have a pretty
damn amazing relationship. So why put
it in danger?
My basic feeling — and I think this is
true of a lot of women I know — is I don't
want to end up like my mother. Don't get
me wrong — my mom's amazing. She's
combined working full-time as a physician,
raising four kids and dealing with cooking
and cleaning. And she followed my father
from Beirut to Los Angeles to Boston and
finally to Wichita for his career. She even
had to change her medical specialty from
dermatology to pathology when we moved
to Wichita because Wichita didn't have a
residency program in dermatology.
I have an incredible amount of respect
for people who follow their partners from
city to city and career to career. But for me,
I don't want to have to put my career sec
ond. Even if I'm making less money. Even
if I could get a job somewhere else. Even if
I have to have a long-distance relationship
for a year, maybe two, maybe more. I abso
lutely want to follow an independent
career path, no bones about it.
Partly, I realize that I'm being a bit
reactionary. No, I wouldn't mind so much
if I stayed in the Bay Area. I could probably
get a pretty cool job. I'd be near a lot of my
friends, not to mention Max. Nothing

looks more tempting right now than to
take the easy way out — sort of amor
phously hang out around Stanford for a
while — especially when the future looks
so uncertain. But I don't want to be the
one who moves. I came to Stanford to
explore my intellectual passions, and I'm
not going to stop doing that just because
I'm graduating. I'm definitely not going to
stop doing that because of this relation
ship. Not now, anyway.
If you think I'm starting to sound like
a typical career-driven Stanford student
or like some feminist poster child, realize
that you've only heard half the story. For
one, being at Stanford for four years has
definitely taught me that friends are
more important than the kind of achieve
ment that you get from school or from a
career. I've known too many people who
put work before life not to have misgiv
ings about the decision I've made.
But the bottom line is that I love Max a
lot, too much to ask him to give up what he
really wants to do. And I think that's how
he feels, too. Neither of us knows how we'll
deal with being apart next year. But as of
now, it's something we've got to do.
