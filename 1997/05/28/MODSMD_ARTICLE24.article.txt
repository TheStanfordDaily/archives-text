# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Looking backward will let you see what's ahead 
### 
"But Lot's wife looked back, and she
became a pillar of salt."
— Genesis 19:26
LOOKING BACK CAN be a dan
gerous thing. But for us graduat
ing seniors it gets a little unavoid
able right about now — especially since
the alternative (looking forward) can
make us a little queasy.
Alas, I found myself looking to the
past recently, when I attended one of
those "consolidated" birthday bashes —
you know, the parties that prudent stu
dents throw to save time by celebrating
the births of up to five different people
at once. I found myself caught in casual
conversation with one of the evening's
honorees (her name escapes me, but I
know it started with "E" and appeared
either third or fourth on the "Happy
Birthday" banner). At one point she
mentioned how she thought it strange
that we were both seniors and had never
met. Somehow, she was intrigued by the
fact that we'd traipsed about the same
campus for four years, yet the paths

we'd pitter-pattered had never crossed.
Unexpectedly, she left quite an
impression on me. I found myself think
ing, almost aloud, "Well, it had to be
either Erin or Erica because those are
the only girls' names with E that I can
think of, except for maybe Elizabeth."
Also, her comment about never having
met set me to some reflecting.
Rhetorically, the question that popped
into my head went like this: "Whoa, what
other things here have I missed?" And
maybe the question wasn't that rhetori
cal because I found myself coming up
with plenty of answers. Before long, 1 was
playing my own inner game of "I never."
I never went to the top of Hoover
Tower. I never skinny-dipped in the lake
at midnight. I never dressed up funny to
take a final. I never went to Exotic Erot
ic. I never skipped class to go to the beach
with someone I had a crush on.
Eh, well, maybe once. Drink.
I never went to Viennese Ball. I never
became close personal friends with Tiger
Woods. I never played Frisbee in the
Oval. I never said hello to Joe Jonah

Euclid. I never learned to play guitar.
Now, some things I regret more than
others. I regret not taking more of my
time more seriously. I regret not pursu
ing my passions more passionately. I
regret not doing those things I explicitly
said I'd do.
Even more so, I regret not getting clos
er to more people and making more
friends. It's been invaluable to me to sur
round myself with intelligent and amaz
ing people — and in a place like this, it
was easy to do. From what I hear, truly
engaging people exist "out there," too,
but they're a lot more dispersed and
harder to find.
Various other depressing and overly
melodramatic-type thoughts popped into
my head that night (when you're only
invited to one-fifth of a party, there can
be a lot of down time). Thoughts about
leaving and leaving people behind.
Eventually, however, I'm learning to
accept my regrets as a challenge for the
future. I'm finding new resolve to get out
there and gather me rosebuds while I
may, even though there'll be a few thorns.

Really, this whole graduation / leaving
Stanford thing isn't much of an ending, if
all it takes is the offhand comment of a
girl I'd never met (Elektra?) to remind
me of all the things I haven't even begun.
To be honest, of all the fast-approach
ing end-of-the-year activities, Com
mencement shouldn't be nearly as stress
ful an event as, say, packing (if you've
seen my room, you know what I mean).
Leaving will be difficult, emotional, but
not unexpected. It's been on my calendar
for four years, and I'm usually not one
for planning ahead.
Of course, I don't mean to underap
preciate what's happening here — I'm
just recognizing it for what it is: an
important milestone, like my bar mitz
vah, only without Brian "Stinky" Stein
berg. Graduation is a checkpoint.
Looking back is what you do at check
points. If there weren't these stoplights
every so often, people like me might
keep barreling down the same road,
falling into the same potholes, missing
the proper exits and making the same
hackneyed life-is-a-highway analogies.

Also, I might run out of gas.
Depression, therefore, is one response
to the situation but not the one I'm
choosing to choose. Regret also works but
not for me. There are too many diems left
to earpe, so who has time to bitch and
moan, especially while trying to feed and
support oneself?
You paid your $10(),000-plus admis
sion fee, and hopefully you got to ride
most of the rides. And when you get on
the next roller coaster, you should be
better prepared to deal with the ups and
downs.
Obviously, the moral of the story is
this: Life does move pretty fast, so do
stop once in a while and take a look
around. And by all means, look back.
Unless you do, you just might regret it.
