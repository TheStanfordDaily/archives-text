### Travis Brandon Contributing writer 
The number of applicants to Stanford's popu
lar Sophomore College program has increased
significantly for the second consecutive year.
According to Todd Benson, student service of
ficer in the School of Humanities and Sciences,
558 students submitted 1,060 applications this
year, a 59 percent increase from last year, when
about 350 students submitted 000 applications.
"This increase shows that we have really hit
on the right point with the Sophomore College,"
said Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for under
graduate education.
Sophomore College is an intensive program
held in the two weeks prior to the start of fall

quarter. It features small group seminars on
tightly focused subjects led by what Benson
called "some high-powered faculty," as well as
workshops led by various University offices that
serve undergraduates. Some of the faculty mem
bers who led seminars in the past include Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice.
One of the main factors behind the increase in
the number of students this year is the growth of
the program itself. According to Benson, eight
classes comprising 10 students each were offered
last year. This fall, there will be 12 classes com
prising 12 students each — an 80 percent in
crease in the number of studtents.
Despite the growth in the number of appli
cants, the program is actually accepting a higher

percentage of students, according to Benson.
Last year, 23 percent of all applicants were ac
cepted vs. 26 percent this year.
"The Sophomore College program has been
growing every year in order to meet the de
mand," Benson said.
Saldivar explained, however, that the depart
ment had not yet decided how to handle future
growth.
"This is still a pilot program, even though it is
clearly a successful one," Saldivar said. "We
don't know if we should expand the program so
that it can accommodate all demand or if we
should have limits."
He explained that administrators wanted to
offer the opportunity to as many
students as possible while main
taining the intimacy of the pro
gram. "I think that we are on the
right track here and that we will
figure something out," he added.
Both Saldi'var and Benson also
attributed the increased number of
applications to information spread
by word of mouth about the 3-year
old program.
"Students have really found out
about the Sophomore College, and
are eager to take part in it," Saldi
var said. "There are now two class
es, juniors and seniors, talking
about how much the program has
helped them and praising the col
lege to each other."
This fall, 12 classes will be of
fered on diverse topics ranging
from the Constitution and comput
er science to the origin of life. Ac

cording to Benson, none of the
classes received a much larger
number of applicants than any of
the others.
"Each class had many more ap
plicants than available spots," Ben
son said. "I believe there was an av
erage of 80 applications for each
class."
The increase in the number of
Sophomore College applications
corresponds to an increasing inter
est in sophomore programs such as
the Sophomore Seminars and Dia
logues.
"Next year, there will be 180
freshman and sophomore semi
nars offered," Benson explained.
" If you include the Sophomore Col
lege, that akes more than 190
small seminar classes for people in
their first two years.
"We hope that soon anyone who
is interested will be able to have
this great opportunity to interact
personally with a faculty member
and to study an issue in depth,"
Benson added.
