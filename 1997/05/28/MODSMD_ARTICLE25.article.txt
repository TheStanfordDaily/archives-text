The number of applicants to Stanford's popu
lar Sophomore College program has increased
significantly for the second consecutive year.
According to Todd Benson, student service of
ficer in the School of Humanities and Sciences,
558 students submitted 1,060 applications this
year, a 59 percent increase from last year, when
about 350 students submitted 000 applications.
"This increase shows that we have really hit
on the right point with the Sophomore College,"
said Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for under
graduate education.
Sophomore College is an intensive program
held in the two weeks prior to the start of fall

quarter. It features small group seminars on
tightly focused subjects led by what Benson
called "some high-powered faculty," as well as
workshops led by various University offices that
serve undergraduates. Some of the faculty mem

versity President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice.
One of the main factors behind the increase in
the number of students this year is the growth of
the program itself. According to Benson, eight
classes comprising 10 students each were offered
last year. This fall, there will be 12 classes com
prising 12 students each â€” an 80 percent in
crease in the number of studtents.
Despite the growth in the number of appli
cants, the program is actually accepting a higher

percentage of students, according to Benson.
Last year, 23 percent of all applicants were ac
cepted vs. 26 percent this year.
"The Sophomore College program has been
growing every year in order to meet the de
mand," Benson said.
Saldivar explained, however, that the depart
ment had not yet decided how to handle future
growth.
"This is still a pilot program, even though it is
clearly a successful one," Saldivar said. "We
don't know if we should expand the program so
that it can accommodate all demand or if we
should have limits."
He explained that administrators wanted to
