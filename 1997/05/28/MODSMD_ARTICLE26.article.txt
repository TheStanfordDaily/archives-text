# E-mail harassment cause for Net blocks
## 
### Therese Lee Editorial staff 
The University only blocks ac
cess from Internet domains as a re
sult of repeated e-mail harassment,
said Information Systems Special
ist Stephen Hansen of Distributed
Computing and Communication
Systems.
Such blocks restrict an Internet
site's access to the University's net
work, not Stanford's access to the
site.
Doctoral student Marc Spear un
covered one such Internet block
earlier this month and drafted a let
ter to University President Ger
hard Casper airing his grievances
on the matter. He argued that the
University should not be a "moral
arbiter of the Internet" and should
"never block access to any Internet
sites."
Spear referred to the Universi
ty's block on Hi way Technologies in
his letter to Casper. Although Spear
alleges that as many as 25,000 In
ternet domains had been blocked,
Hansen said the University had
"blocked at most 250."
Such blocks are only activated
after cases of repeated e-mail ha
rassment, Hansen said. Following a
complaint registered by a user on
campus, Hansen said he makes a re
quest for the incoming message
sender to halt this activity. If cither
no response or a hostile one is re
ceived, Hansen recommends that
the Networking Systems, a division
of Distributed Computing and
Communication Systems, places a
block on the subnet.
"Sometimes, [the senders) don't
care," he said. "Other times, they
realize we're serious .. . and we re
move the block when asked."
Many commercial organizations
promote their products through
mass mailings. Networking Sys
tems implemented the first domain
block in January 1996. Domains
that have been blocked include ones
that have advertised for"the
hottest party game on campus" and
"fast money."
"We get a large amount of unso
licited, bulk e-mail," he said, "that is

usually sent for commercial pur
posess. . . . They mine these ad
dresses from postings people made
to network newsgroups and Web
pages."
Once people are on these lists,
they may receive 10 to 20 messages
a day, Hansen added.
On campus, the "overall volume
[ofjunk e-mail] is significant and in
creasing," he said. "We've gone
from a few complaints a week to 20
to 30 a day. They have increased
dramatically over the last 12 to 18
months."

The University
should not be a
'moral arbiter of
the Internet.'
— Stephen Hansen

Hansen admitted that the in
crease may be due to an increased
awareness of tiie services that Dis
tributed Computing provides to
deal with the problem of e-mail ha
rassment.
In the larger perspective, "it's
becoming. . . an actual threat to the
viability of e-mail and the whole sys
tem," Hansen said. "I know a lot of
people who have begun to think
twice about posting articles on
newsgroups fearing that their ad
dresses will get added to these mail
ing lists."
It is not unusual for innocent
parties to be blocked as a result of
the actions that Networking Sys
tems takes, Hansen admitted. How
ever, "without any feedback from
Ithem], I have no way of knowing
which ones are the bad guys.
"I'm not personally comfort
able" with placing blocks on do
mains, Hansen said. "I think we
should be as open as possible. Hut
when people continue to abuse their
access, we don't have much choice."
Distributed Computing recently
restricted their block on Hiway
Technologies to block only the of
fending companies, rather than all
250 domains being serviced by them.
