## New treatment promises relief for chronic pain Researchers utilize lethal venom from cone snails as analgesic 
### Monique Richards 
The notion that a toxin used by cone
shaped snails to kill their prey can be used as
a therapeutic painkiller may not seem intu
itively sound. Yet that's exactly what scien
tists at Stanford and Neurex Corp. are doing
with a drug treatment called SNX-111.
When one considers that the number of
patients suffering from chronic neuropathic
pain in the United States exceeds 6 million, it
is surprising that there are so few effective
weapons against chronic pain. Narcotics such
as morphine work for a while, but many
patients become dependent on them too
quickly and require even stronger doses. Pain
relief often comes at the expense of the
patient's faculties.
SNX-111 is a novel treatment for pain that
epitomizes "the first of a new and exciting
class of compounds to treat severe pain," said
to Assoc. Anesthesia Prof. William Brose. It
has almost completed the process necessary
for Food and Drug Administration approval.
SNX-111 has no morphine-like side effects
and works even in patients who have failed to
respond to morphine. It was also the first neu
ron-specific calcium channel blocker to enter
clinical development trials.
The concept of this drug is that communi
cation between nerve cells, and consequently
the transmission of pain, can be controlled
through the regulation of nerve-specific calci
um channels. Calcium plays an important role
in the function of nerve cells because it affects
neurotransmitter release. SNX-111 selective

ly blocks the entry of calcium into the nerve
cells, inhibiting the release of neurotransmit
ters for the transmission of pain messages to
the brain. When administered into the fluid
surrounding the spinal cord, SNX-111 has
been proven to be an effective analgesic, or
painkiller.
SNX-111 came from the research efforts of
Baldomera Olivera, a professor at the Univer
sity of Utah who studied conus snails. He had
collected their shells as a child and heard that
at least 20 people have been killed by the
Conus geographus species of the marine snail.
Olivera and his colleagues were hoping to
find the one major toxic component of the
snail's venom and identify it. Instead, they
isolated nine proteins that comprised the
venom in these marine snails. They had dis
covered a new class of biomolecules called
conotoxins.
Olivera discovered two important charac
teristics about the lethal efficiency of the
snail's venom. The first characteristic of these
conotoxins was their small size relative to most
proteins seen in nature. The ability of these
proteins to retain their particular shapes was
their second important characteristic.
Their shapes are well suited to block criti
cal openings on nerve cells. These proteins are
both small and specific — characteristics that
are the earmarks of an ideal drug.
George Miljanich, a biochemist at USC, had
been following Olivera's research. He had
been investigating how nerve pulses travel
from one nerve cell to another and was inter
ested in the ability of conotoxins to shut down

communication among nerve cells.
Miljanich collaborated with scientists at
Neurex, Stanford's Brose and Donald
Yamashiro, one of the world's leading peptide
chemists, to produce SNX-111. Yamashiro
was able to synthesize the chain of 24 amino
acids that made up the conotoxin, but the
challenging task was to construct the chain so
that it folded into the right shape.
One of the tests involving SNX-111 had
remarkable results. In order to track the
activity of the conotoxin, it was made radioac
tive. SNX-111, as well as some other radiola
beled conotoxin proteins, were injected into
the spinal fluid of rats.
One conotoxin stained a large area of its
recipients' spinal cord — showing that it could
bind to and block many neural pathways to
the brain.
SNX-111 also displayed specificity. It stained
a well-defined portion of the spinal cord called
the dorsal horn, which contains nerve fibers
that carry nerve signals to the brain. This was
another indication that SNX-111 would make a
good analgesic. Because it only blocked the pain
conducting nerves and nothing else, this drug
would have minimal side effects.
Initial trials of SNX-111 on humans with
AIDS and cancer were so successful that more
studies were initiated in pain, head trauma
and ischemia cases. Since then, over 280
patients have been treated with SNX-111.
Scientists hope SNX-111 will help ease the
suffering of many terminally ill patients and
make life for the millions of people who live
with chronic pain more bearable.
