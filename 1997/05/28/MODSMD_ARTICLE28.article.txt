Cockroaches increase asthma morbidity

A study commissioned by the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shows conclusive
ly that the combination of cockroach allergy and
high exposure rates to cockroaches is linked to asth
ma-related illness and hospitalizations in U.S.
inner-city children.
David Rosenstreich of the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in New York and his colleagues report

that children who wore hoth allergic to cockroaches and exposed to
cockroach allergen at high levels were hospitalized for their asth
ma 3.3 times more often than children who were either allergic
but not exposed to high levels of cockroach allergen or not allergic
but exposed to high levels of allergen.
Despite the availability of effective asthma therapies, asthma
related deaths among individuals 25 and younger in the United
States increased 118 percent between 1980 and 1993. This trend
was particularly pronounced in minority populations living in the
poorest neighborhoods.
"Allergy and exposure to cockroach allergen clearly play an
important role in the alarming rates of asthma-related sickness
among these children," said the institute's director Anthony
Fauci, "and underscore the importance of the institute's research
into understanding, preventing and treating asthma."

Four new Stanford Hughes investigators

The Howard Hughes Medical Institute
announced last week that four Stanford researchers
have been chosen to join the prestigious ranks of
Hughes investigators. They are Asst. Chemical
Engineering Prof. Chaitan Khosla, Asst. Develop
mental Biology Prof. David Kingsley, Assoc. Bio
chemistry Prof. Mark Krasnow and Neurobiology
Prof. William Newsome.

Hughes investigators are among the most influential in their
field and have made significant contributions to biomedical
research in the areas of AIDS, cancer, diabetes and cystic fibrosis.
There are currently 12 Hughes investigators at Stanford, with
1 1 in the School of Medicine and one in the Biology Department.
Kingsley's research focuses on the development of the verte
brate skeleton. His research has been applied by pharmaceutical
companies in bone fracture repair and may eventually provide bet
ter ways to stimulate bone and joint repair in adult animals.
Krasnow focuses on genes and biochemical pathways involved
in the complex formation of the fruit fly respiratory system.
"Recent evidence suggests that similar genes and mechanisms
may be used to pattern branching of mammalian lungs," he said.
Newsome works in the relatively new field of cognitive neuro
science. His work may yield insight into the basis of cognitive
impairments in neurological and psychiatric diseases.
Khosla's group focuses on the synthesis of novel polyketides —
an important class of biological molecules found in a number of
antibiotic, immunosuppressant and anti-cancer drugs. "The new
position will allow me to offer the extremely talented and motivat
ed students and postdoctoral fellows in my lab the kinds of
resources, both physical and technical, that I could not have
dreamed of providing otherwise," Khosla said.
