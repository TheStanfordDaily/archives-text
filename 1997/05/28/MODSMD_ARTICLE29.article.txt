# New method speeds up gene mapping

A new gene-mapping technique that works
faster and gives higher resolution than previ
ous techniques has been put into use by Genet
ics Prof. David Cox, one of the directors of the
Stanford Human Genome Center, to give the
most complete map of the human genome yet
made.
His technique, called radiation hybrid map
ping, uses statistical methods to efficiently
locate the position of different gene markers.
Gene markers are like landmarks along the
DNA strand, and they are essential to the map
ping process.
Before the radiation hybrid technique, map
ping genes was an extremely slow process, with
researchers spending months to locate a single
marker.
The technique uses the ability of hamster
cells to hold onto pieces of human DNA. The
first step is to fragment human DNA into 83
pieces by irradiating DNA with X-rays.
The random fragments of the DNA are then
placed in the hamster cells, one fragment per

cell. In the 8M fragments, the genome is proba
bly repeated more than a dozen times.
Once the human DNA is inserted into the
hamster cells, researchers search each cell line
(or genetic markers of interest. A scorecard for
each marker is made showing which cells it
appeared in.
The scorecards are then fed into a comput
er and are mapped using statistical methods.
The researchers look for the frequency that
markers appear with other markers. Markers
that are close together appear on the same
fragment more often, because they are less
likely to be cut apart by the X-rays. Markers
that never appear together are likely to be far
ther apart.
The computer program used by the
researchers, called Mapper, allows the han
dling of thousands of markers simultaneously.
Radiation hybrid mapping has created the
most detailed map of the human genome to
date, wi(b twice the resolution of any other
map published so far.
The advantage of making a map of the
human genome is that it will help speed up
efforts to pinpoint disease-causing genes. Any

researcher using the radiation hybrid tech
nique can cross-reference his data with the
map available at the center's World Wide Web
site.
One such breakthrough that has already
occurred is the discovery of the gene that caus
es the most common human cancer, basal cell
carcinoma. Stanford developmental biologist
Matthew Scott used the radiation hybrid tech
nique to make a scorecard for a fruit fly gene
they had been working with for years.
After comparing the results with the
genome center's map, they discovered that the
gene corresponded to a marker found in people
with basal cell carcinoma.
The ability to make a map of the human
genome will also help in efforts to find the
exact sequence of the chemical building blocks,
called bases, that combine to form human
I)NA.
Cox's research will now focus on making a
better map that will further the sequencing
effort. The current map has 8,000 markers
with about 400,000 bases between each mark
er. A map wil h .'lO,OOO markers with only about
100,000 bases in between them is the new goal.
