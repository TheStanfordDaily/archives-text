# Hong Kong: the transition
## Issues abundant in Hong Kong turnover 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
Alter 150 years of Western colonization, a
stretch of land — prosperous, urban and civi
lized — will once again become a part of its vul
nerable, largely rugged and inhospitable Com
munist mainland.
Hong Kong — with its population of 6 mil
lion, 98 percent of whom are ethnic Chinese —
will be returned from British rule to the hands
of Chinese leaders on July 1.
Under China's "one country, two systems"
doctrine toward Hong Kong, the colony will be
come a Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China and has been
promised a high degree of autonomy in manag
ing its economic, social, legal, budget and other
internal matters.
The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the 1990 PRC Basic Law — the latter passed by
China's National People's Congress — binds
this historical transition with detailed agree
ments for the future of Hong Kong. Under
these laws, China will assume Britain's respon
sibilities for Hong Kong's foreign affairs and de
fense for the next 50 years.
Although some experts and citizens remain
critical, China is now legally committed to pre
serving Hong Kong as it is now — free, robust
and alive with a healthy economy and social sys
tem — for at least 50 years to come.
History
During the 18th century and early 19th cen
tury, China adopted a virtual closed-door policy
toward the West, although Western powers
were determined not to leave China isolated,
coveting Chinese markets and resources.
In a worsening trade relationship between
Great Britain and China, the Opium War broke
out in January 1839 when China refused to

trade opium with Britain.
Western colonization of the region began in
1842, when the Treaty of Nanking — the frrst of
a series of unequal treaties signed with Western
powers — ceded Hong Kong Island from China
to a victorious Britain and opened five Chinese
ports for British trade.
In 1860, the southern tip of the Kowloon
peninsula also fell to British rule. Then in 1898,
under the second Convention of Peking, the two
nations signed an agreement that granted

Britain a 99-year lease for the remaining 92 per
cent of H< ig Kong's present territory.
Whik the West tends to exhibit a "forgetful
ness" towurd this bitter past, the Chinese lead
ers have for many years insisted that their dig
nity will lx: restored only with the return of
Hong Kong.
No one knows exactly what is in store for
1 long Kong in the years to come. While interna
tional Stanford students from I long Kong, such
as junior Melvina Cheung, worry that they
might eventually lose residency, China expert
and Political Science Prof Michael Oksenberg
said there is "no reason to panic," adding that
he expects Hong Kong and Chinese officials to
continue their intensive cooperation to prevent
massive influx of immigrants to I long Kong.
According to Oksenberg, Hong Kong will re
main "both politically and economically stable
in the weeks and months imm(*liately follow
ing" the turnover. Instead, he said the ques
tions to Ik; asked involve the long-term.
"1 do suspect that both governments will lx;
tested in their resolve as in the past," he said, re
ferring to incidents such as the China India lx>r
der war in 19(>2.
With the expected emergence of ('hina in the
21st century with its great militaiy and political
power, some experts see the return of the high
ly advanced colony to the mainland as not only

affecting Asia but also changing the
international system, creating a
shift of power from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.
"The return of Hong Kong to
China brings to an end a period of
Western domination in Asia," said
Political Science Prof. Dan Oki
moto.
"For the past 150 years, China
has suffered humiliation, domina
tion, invasion and attack at the
hands of foreign powers, including
the West and Japan." he said. "This
historical and momentous event —
ending 500 years of Western domi
nation — signals the start of a new
historical era in Asia, one that
brings up Asia as the locus of wealth
and power."
Economy
For many years, the free market
system of Hong Kong has spurred
high rates of growth, low rates of
unemployment, rising wages and
one of the highest per capita gross
domestic product levels in the
world.
Over the past several decades,
the growing economies of Hong
Kong and Taiwan have tied them
closer together with neighboring
parts of China such as Guangdong
and Fujian, two provinces with
rapidly growing economies on the
coast of the mainland.
Although the development of the
Open Door Policy in 1979 has
helped China establish many direct
diplomatic, commercial and trans
portation links with the outside
world, Hong Kong's role as an inter
mediary in China's commodity
trade is becoming more and more
prominent.
According to Nicholas Kristof, a
New York Times writer and former
Beijing bureau chief during the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre
China's demands on Hong Kong's
capacity as intermediary is expected
to further increase after the han
dover in 1997.
"Hong Kong is going to become
more integrated with China, and for
all the risks and challenges, I'm
guardedly optimistic," he said in an
interview with The Daily. "Nobody
has ever made money betting
against Hong Kong."
As Hong Kong and Taiwan in
vestors gradually spread their
wealth further and deeper into
China, the world could see China
quickly develop into a great econom
ic monster, side by side with the
United States, Europe and Japan.
According to Okimoto, restora
tion of Chinese power in Hong Kong
will help China on its road to "join
the rich man's club," an accomplish
ment Japan has successfully

achieved in the past and Korea is
"on the verge of doing."
Okimoto added, "Hong Kong is
one of the most populous and ad
vanced areas of the world. With the
rise of Asia, its place as the power
and wealth center is inevitable."
Political and civil issues
The return of Hong Kong is
sandwiched between two major Chi
nese events — the death of China's
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in
February and the creation of the
15th Communist Party congress —
which will rule China for the next
five years — in the fall. Together,
they make the 1997 year extremely
critical for China and the handover
even more unpredictable for the res
idents of Hong Kong.
In addition, Tung Chee-hwa be
came China's new first chief execu
tive with a landslide victory in the
Selection Committee last Decem
ber. However, Tung has cqme under
strong criticism from the West for
supporting the restoration of strict
colonial laws — thus raising con
cerns that freedom of expression
cculd be impaired after the han
dover.
In preparation for the transition,
thousands of citizens have left Hong
Kong, away from the political and
economical restraints they fear will
be imposed upon them. Others who
have not fled cautiously hold on to
their foreign visas and passports.
Gus Lee, a first-generation Asian
American and noted author of Chi
nese-American issues, said keeping
economic fortitude will be of little
significance to the Chinese govern
ment.
"Although not always admirable,
Hong Kong has generated a very ex
citing blend of Western capitalistic
economy and Chinese business cul
ture," he said. "I tend to believe
China is going to change it."
Lee, who also said he has been
"discomforted by the way the
British ruled Hong Kong as well as
their presence" in his mother coun
try, expressed deep concerns about
the future of the region.
"It's easy for me, 7,000 miles
away, to say, 'good, erase the
shame of 150 years ago and restore
history,' but for the people living in
Hong Kong, my pride in this mat
ter represents their political and
economic risks. If you ask the peo
ple of Hong Kong if they wanted to
be a part of China, they'll say 'No,
thank you.' "
Indeed, according to recent opin
ion polls taken in Hong Kong, a ma
jority of Hong Kong residents would
rather not see their land returned to
Communist hands.
Freedom of speech
Kristof said the Hong Kong
media has already been preparing
for the change of hand, toning down
their coverage of China and exercis

ing self-censorship in the past five
years.
"After the handover, I suspect
that there will be more self-censor
ship, and that may be more of a
problem than censorship as such,"
he said. "I don't expect reporters to
be dragged off to jail in Hong Kong
as they sometimes are in China, but
I think there will be pressure put on
publications and on the advertisers
who keep them afloat."
Kristof also expressed concerns
over corruption and the possibility
that gangsters would be used to
punish aggressive journalists.
"That was the pattern in Taiwan
in the bad old days, and if a Chinese
general is angry at a critical journal
ist, there's no need to get the police
involved," he said. "It would be sim
pler and more efficient for the gen
eral to ask some gangster friends to
visit the journalist and break his
legs and arms. That, I fear, is going
to be one of the challenges for Hong
Kong journalists in the coming
years."
Visiting Communication Prof,
and former St. Louis Post Dispatch
Editor William Woo said he expects
to "find a press that is extremely
nervous" when he gets there. Woo
will go to Hong Kong during the
handover on behalf of the Interna
tional Center for Journalists to re
port on the state of freedom of the
press.
"A countiy that doesn't have a
free press is about to take over a
place with a veiy free press," he said.
"The changeover is going to be an
immense story; it is a very frighten
ing moment for Hong Kong journal
ists."
Pointing out that China has
made it very clear that it will not ac
cept dissent damaging to the gov
ernment, Woo said it will be inter
esting to see how the free press will
be maintained in Hong Kong.
"Mr. Tung has already made it
clear that demonstrations and riots
— the core of freedom of expression
— are going to be cut back, and what
it means for a robust free press is
very much in question," he said.
Woo added that although he
thinks China is going to be "very
careful to convey the image of Hong
Kong as a good place to do business,
a good place to live, where political
pressures don't interfere with busi
ness," the Chinese leadership is
going to be pragmatic enough to rule
v» ith a heavy hand if "foreign media
depicts the press in Hong Kong as
victims of expression and depicts
China as the ruthless oppressor."
Stanford ties
For Stanford students from
Hong Kong, the handover is more
than a mere historical event.
"The British have given us a sur
prisingly free hand and people are
able to go make their money and
spend it as they please as well as

hold public protests and criticize
the government without much fear
of action against them," said Che
ung, whose grandfather fled from
mainland China in 1949 when the
Communists took over the Repub
lic.
"A lot of older people (who fled to
Hong Kong) had bad experiences
with the Communists in China, and
, some people have fears that the
■ Chinese sove-e<gnty over Hong
Kong will not enable them to live
life as they have."
Cheung also expressed uncer
tainty about career potential back
home after the handover, com
menting that she and many of her
former classmates also studying
abroad are now "not sure where
we'll make our home."
"We were bred in one of the
'elite' Anglo-Chinese schools which
prepared us for higher education
overseas," she said.
According to Cheung, these
"elite" students educated under the
British education system in the
dozen or so exclusive schools in
Hong Kong often went abroad for
higher education and returned
home to assume prominent posi
tions in society.
"Now we are in somewhat am
biguous roles," she said. "The un
certainty of (Hong Kong's future)
has meant that we might look to
starting our lives elsewhere.
We're watching the situation
carefully."
Other students remained opti
mistic about the change, however.
According to junior Phil Li,
Hong Kong will always be an excit
ing place to live, with its "dizzying
pace of life, rapid and unpredictable
changes and infinite historical pos
sibilities.
"Amazing things will happen in
the foreseeable future, I just have a
feeling," he said. "People know that
their lot is tied up with the main
land's no matter what. They are
bracing for change, but they are
amazingly versatile. You can't sur
vive there otherwise."
Many Stanford students will
also be in Hong Kong to see the his
torical event unfold.
Junior Drew Blackburn, who re
ceived a grant to conduct research
in Hong Kong this summer, said he
is looking for a "once in a lifetime
experience" when he chose to study
the effects the handover will have
on intellectual property rights in
Hong Kong.
"I wanted to have a unique ex
perience, something I'll be able to
look back on years later and say
this is what I did," he said. "And I
thought Hong Kong this summer
would be just that — a coming to
gether of technology and public
policy issues and unique culture —
and it just seemed so obvious to be
there."
Graduate student Mariko

Hayashibara, an international stu
dent from Japan who will be report
ing on the handover for the Asian
Wall Street Journal, remembers
Hong Kong as being the "oasis"
during her four years of undergrad
uate study at the People's Universi
ty of China.
"Life in Beijing was tough espe
cially if you area from a developed
country like Japan. So, I went to
Hong Kong just to feel 'civiliza
tion,' " she said.
"I always took a train down
there, and I liked crossing the bor
ders from Shenzhen, China to
Hong Kong. The difference was
very visible at that time.
On the Shenzhen side, there
are a lot of homeless people walk
ing around with extremely dirty
clothes, but you hardly see any
one like that one you enter Hong

Kong side."
Hayashibara, who was the first
foreign student in China to receive
a journalism degree, said she ex
pects the handover coverage to be
extremely challenging.
"I think it is more of a long-term
coverage rather than something
that you can cover in one or two
months because it won't affect peo
ple's life immediately," she said.
Junior Trung Ngo, who re
turned this quarter from studying
abroad in Beijing, said he hopes
Hong Kong will be an example of
economic and civil freedom for
China.
"Hong Kong has the capacity —
as part of China — to influence the
rest of China, to make the Chinese
people see the quality of life in Hong
Kong as something they can have
and aspire toward," he said.

China's National People's Congress — binds
this historical transition with detailed agree
ments for the future of Hong Kong. Under
these laws, China will assume Britain's respon
sibilities for Hong Kong's foreign affairs and de
fense for the next 50 years.
Although some experts and citizens remain
critical, China is now legally committed to pre
serving Hong Kong as it is now — free, robust
and alive with a healthy economy and social sys
tem — for at least 50 years to come.
History
During the 18th century and early 19th cen
tury, China adopted a virtual closed-door policy
toward the West, although Western powers
were determined not to leave China isolated,
coveting Chinese markets and resources.
In a worsening trade relationship between
Great Britain and China, the Opium War broke
out in January 1839 when China refused to

trade opium with Britain.
Western colonization of the region began in
1842, when the Treaty of Nanking — the frrst of
a series of unequal treaties signed with Western
powers — ceded Hong Kong Island from China
to a victorious Britain and opened five Chinese
ports for British trade.
In 1860, the southern tip of the Kowloon
peninsula also fell to British rule. Then in 1898,
under the second Convention of Peking, the two
nations signed an agreement that granted

Britain a 99-year lease for the remaining 92 per
cent of H< ig Kong's present territory.
Whik the West tends to exhibit a "forgetful
ness" towurd this bitter past, the Chinese lead
ers have for many years insisted that their dig
nity will lx: restored only with the return of
Hong Kong.
No one knows exactly what is in store for
1 long Kong in the years to come. While interna
tional Stanford students from I long Kong, such
as junior Melvina Cheung, worry that they
might eventually lose residency, China expert
and Political Science Prof Michael Oksenberg
said there is "no reason to panic," adding that
he expects Hong Kong and Chinese officials to
continue their intensive cooperation to prevent
massive influx of immigrants to I long Kong.
According to Oksenberg, Hong Kong will re
main "both politically and economically stable
in the weeks and months imm(*liately follow
ing" the turnover. Instead, he said the ques
tions to Ik; asked involve the long-term.
"1 do suspect that both governments will lx;
tested in their resolve as in the past," he said, re
ferring to incidents such as the China India lx>r
der war in 19(>2.
With the expected emergence of ('hina in the
21st century with its great militaiy and political
power, some experts see the return of the high
ly advanced colony to the mainland as not only

affecting Asia but also changing the
international system, creating a
shift of power from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.
"The return of Hong Kong to
China brings to an end a period of
Western domination in Asia," said
Political Science Prof. Dan Oki
moto.
"For the past 150 years, China
has suffered humiliation, domina
tion, invasion and attack at the
hands of foreign powers, including
the West and Japan." he said. "This
historical and momentous event —
ending 500 years of Western domi
nation — signals the start of a new
historical era in Asia, one that
brings up Asia as the locus of wealth
and power."
Economy
For many years, the free market
system of Hong Kong has spurred
high rates of growth, low rates of
unemployment, rising wages and
one of the highest per capita gross
domestic product levels in the
world.
Over the past several decades,
the growing economies of Hong
Kong and Taiwan have tied them
closer together with neighboring
parts of China such as Guangdong
and Fujian, two provinces with
rapidly growing economies on the
coast of the mainland.
Although the development of the
Open Door Policy in 1979 has
helped China establish many direct
diplomatic, commercial and trans
portation links with the outside
world, Hong Kong's role as an inter
mediary in China's commodity
trade is becoming more and more
prominent.
According to Nicholas Kristof, a
New York Times writer and former
Beijing bureau chief during the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre
China's demands on Hong Kong's
capacity as intermediary is expected
to further increase after the han
dover in 1997.
"Hong Kong is going to become
more integrated with China, and for
all the risks and challenges, I'm
guardedly optimistic," he said in an
interview with The Daily. "Nobody
has ever made money betting
against Hong Kong."
As Hong Kong and Taiwan in
vestors gradually spread their
wealth further and deeper into
China, the world could see China
quickly develop into a great econom
ic monster, side by side with the
United States, Europe and Japan.
According to Okimoto, restora
tion of Chinese power in Hong Kong
will help China on its road to "join
the rich man's club," an accomplish
ment Japan has successfully

achieved in the past and Korea is
"on the verge of doing."
Okimoto added, "Hong Kong is
one of the most populous and ad
vanced areas of the world. With the
rise of Asia, its place as the power
and wealth center is inevitable."
Political and civil issues
The return of Hong Kong is
sandwiched between two major Chi
nese events — the death of China's
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in
February and the creation of the
15th Communist Party congress —
which will rule China for the next
five years — in the fall. Together,
they make the 1997 year extremely
critical for China and the handover
even more unpredictable for the res
idents of Hong Kong.
In addition, Tung Chee-hwa be
came China's new first chief execu
tive with a landslide victory in the
Selection Committee last Decem
ber. However, Tung has cqme under
strong criticism from the West for
supporting the restoration of strict
colonial laws — thus raising con
cerns that freedom of expression
cculd be impaired after the han
dover.
In preparation for the transition,
thousands of citizens have left Hong
Kong, away from the political and
economical restraints they fear will
be imposed upon them. Others who
have not fled cautiously hold on to
their foreign visas and passports.
Gus Lee, a first-generation Asian
American and noted author of Chi
nese-American issues, said keeping
economic fortitude will be of little
significance to the Chinese govern
ment.
"Although not always admirable,
Hong Kong has generated a very ex
citing blend of Western capitalistic
economy and Chinese business cul
ture," he said. "I tend to believe
China is going to change it."
Lee, who also said he has been
"discomforted by the way the
British ruled Hong Kong as well as
their presence" in his mother coun
try, expressed deep concerns about
the future of the region.
"It's easy for me, 7,000 miles
away, to say, 'good, erase the
shame of 150 years ago and restore
history,' but for the people living in
Hong Kong, my pride in this mat
ter represents their political and
economic risks. If you ask the peo
ple of Hong Kong if they wanted to
be a part of China, they'll say 'No,
thank you.' "
Indeed, according to recent opin
ion polls taken in Hong Kong, a ma
jority of Hong Kong residents would
rather not see their land returned to
Communist hands.
Freedom of speech
Kristof said the Hong Kong
media has already been preparing
for the change of hand, toning down
their coverage of China and exercis

ing self-censorship in the past five
years.
"After the handover, I suspect
that there will be more self-censor
ship, and that may be more of a
problem than censorship as such,"
he said. "I don't expect reporters to
be dragged off to jail in Hong Kong
as they sometimes are in China, but
I think there will be pressure put on
publications and on the advertisers
who keep them afloat."
Kristof also expressed concerns
over corruption and the possibility
that gangsters would be used to
punish aggressive journalists.
"That was the pattern in Taiwan
in the bad old days, and if a Chinese
general is angry at a critical journal
ist, there's no need to get the police
involved," he said. "It would be sim
pler and more efficient for the gen
eral to ask some gangster friends to
visit the journalist and break his
legs and arms. That, I fear, is going
to be one of the challenges for Hong
Kong journalists in the coming
years."
Visiting Communication Prof,
and former St. Louis Post Dispatch
Editor William Woo said he expects
to "find a press that is extremely
nervous" when he gets there. Woo
will go to Hong Kong during the
handover on behalf of the Interna
tional Center for Journalists to re
port on the state of freedom of the
press.
"A countiy that doesn't have a
free press is about to take over a
place with a veiy free press," he said.
"The changeover is going to be an
immense story; it is a very frighten
ing moment for Hong Kong journal
ists."
Pointing out that China has
made it very clear that it will not ac
cept dissent damaging to the gov
ernment, Woo said it will be inter
esting to see how the free press will
be maintained in Hong Kong.
"Mr. Tung has already made it
clear that demonstrations and riots
— the core of freedom of expression
— are going to be cut back, and what
it means for a robust free press is
very much in question," he said.
Woo added that although he
thinks China is going to be "very
careful to convey the image of Hong
Kong as a good place to do business,
a good place to live, where political
pressures don't interfere with busi
ness," the Chinese leadership is
going to be pragmatic enough to rule
v» ith a heavy hand if "foreign media
depicts the press in Hong Kong as
victims of expression and depicts
China as the ruthless oppressor."
Stanford ties
For Stanford students from
Hong Kong, the handover is more
than a mere historical event.
"The British have given us a sur
prisingly free hand and people are
able to go make their money and
spend it as they please as well as

hold public protests and criticize
the government without much fear
of action against them," said Che
ung, whose grandfather fled from
mainland China in 1949 when the
Communists took over the Repub
lic.
"A lot of older people (who fled to
Hong Kong) had bad experiences
with the Communists in China, and
, some people have fears that the
■ Chinese sove-e<gnty over Hong
Kong will not enable them to live
life as they have."
Cheung also expressed uncer
tainty about career potential back
home after the handover, com
menting that she and many of her
former classmates also studying
abroad are now "not sure where
we'll make our home."
"We were bred in one of the
'elite' Anglo-Chinese schools which
prepared us for higher education
overseas," she said.
According to Cheung, these
"elite" students educated under the
British education system in the
dozen or so exclusive schools in
Hong Kong often went abroad for
higher education and returned
home to assume prominent posi
tions in society.
"Now we are in somewhat am
biguous roles," she said. "The un
certainty of (Hong Kong's future)
has meant that we might look to
starting our lives elsewhere.
We're watching the situation
carefully."
Other students remained opti
mistic about the change, however.
According to junior Phil Li,
Hong Kong will always be an excit
ing place to live, with its "dizzying
pace of life, rapid and unpredictable
changes and infinite historical pos
sibilities.
"Amazing things will happen in
the foreseeable future, I just have a
feeling," he said. "People know that
their lot is tied up with the main
land's no matter what. They are
bracing for change, but they are
amazingly versatile. You can't sur
vive there otherwise."
Many Stanford students will
also be in Hong Kong to see the his
torical event unfold.
Junior Drew Blackburn, who re
ceived a grant to conduct research
in Hong Kong this summer, said he
is looking for a "once in a lifetime
experience" when he chose to study
the effects the handover will have
on intellectual property rights in
Hong Kong.
"I wanted to have a unique ex
perience, something I'll be able to
look back on years later and say
this is what I did," he said. "And I
thought Hong Kong this summer
would be just that — a coming to
gether of technology and public
policy issues and unique culture —
and it just seemed so obvious to be
there."
Graduate student Mariko

Hayashibara, an international stu
dent from Japan who will be report
ing on the handover for the Asian
Wall Street Journal, remembers
Hong Kong as being the "oasis"
during her four years of undergrad
uate study at the People's Universi
ty of China.
"Life in Beijing was tough espe
cially if you area from a developed
country like Japan. So, I went to
Hong Kong just to feel 'civiliza
tion,' " she said.
"I always took a train down
there, and I liked crossing the bor
ders from Shenzhen, China to
Hong Kong. The difference was
very visible at that time.
On the Shenzhen side, there
are a lot of homeless people walk
ing around with extremely dirty
clothes, but you hardly see any
one like that one you enter Hong

Kong side."
Hayashibara, who was the first
foreign student in China to receive
a journalism degree, said she ex
pects the handover coverage to be
extremely challenging.
"I think it is more of a long-term
coverage rather than something
that you can cover in one or two
months because it won't affect peo
ple's life immediately," she said.
Junior Trung Ngo, who re
turned this quarter from studying
abroad in Beijing, said he hopes
Hong Kong will be an example of
economic and civil freedom for
China.
"Hong Kong has the capacity —
as part of China — to influence the
rest of China, to make the Chinese
people see the quality of life in Hong
Kong as something they can have
and aspire toward," he said.

Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa will lead Chinese-controlled Hong
Kong after the Chinese government takes control July 1.
Alter 150 years of Western colonization, a
stretch of land — prosperous, urban and civi
lized — will once again become a part of its vul
nerable, largely rugged and inhospitable Com
munist mainland.
Hong Kong — with its population of 6 mil
lion, 98 percent of whom are ethnic Chinese —
will be returned from British rule to the hands
of Chinese leaders on July 1.
Under China's "one country, two systems"
doctrine toward Hong Kong, the colony will be

People's Republic of China and has been
promised a high degree of autonomy in manag
ing its economic, social, legal, budget and other
internal matters.
