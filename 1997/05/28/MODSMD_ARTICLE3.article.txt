# Hong Kong: the transition
## Issues abundant in Hong Kong turnover 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
Alter 150 years of Western colonization, a
stretch of land — prosperous, urban and civi
lized — will once again become a part of its vul
nerable, largely rugged and inhospitable Com
munist mainland.
Hong Kong — with its population of 6 mil
lion, 98 percent of whom are ethnic Chinese —
will be returned from British rule to the hands
of Chinese leaders on July 1.
Under China's "one country, two systems"
doctrine toward Hong Kong, the colony will be
come a Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China and has been
promised a high degree of autonomy in manag
ing its economic, social, legal, budget and other
internal matters.
The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the 1990 PRC Basic Law — the latter passed by
China's National People's Congress — binds
this historical transition with detailed agree
ments for the future of Hong Kong. Under
these laws, China will assume Britain's respon
sibilities for Hong Kong's foreign affairs and de
fense for the next 50 years.
Although some experts and citizens remain
critical, China is now legally committed to pre
serving Hong Kong as it is now — free, robust
and alive with a healthy economy and social sys
tem — for at least 50 years to come.
History
During the 18th century and early 19th cen
tury, China adopted a virtual closed-door policy
toward the West, although Western powers
were determined not to leave China isolated,
coveting Chinese markets and resources.
In a worsening trade relationship between
Great Britain and China, the Opium War broke
out in January 1839 when China refused to

trade opium with Britain.
Western colonization of the region began in
1842, when the Treaty of Nanking — the frrst of
a series of unequal treaties signed with Western
powers — ceded Hong Kong Island from China
to a victorious Britain and opened five Chinese
ports for British trade.
In 1860, the southern tip of the Kowloon
peninsula also fell to British rule. Then in 1898,
under the second Convention of Peking, the two
nations signed an agreement that granted

Britain a 99-year lease for the remaining 92 per
cent of H< ig Kong's present territory.
Whik the West tends to exhibit a "forgetful
ness" towurd this bitter past, the Chinese lead
ers have for many years insisted that their dig
nity will lx: restored only with the return of
Hong Kong.
No one knows exactly what is in store for
1 long Kong in the years to come. While interna
tional Stanford students from I long Kong, such
as junior Melvina Cheung, worry that they
might eventually lose residency, China expert
and Political Science Prof Michael Oksenberg
said there is "no reason to panic," adding that
he expects Hong Kong and Chinese officials to
continue their intensive cooperation to prevent
massive influx of immigrants to I long Kong.
According to Oksenberg, Hong Kong will re
main "both politically and economically stable
in the weeks and months imm(*liately follow
ing" the turnover. Instead, he said the ques
tions to Ik; asked involve the long-term.
"1 do suspect that both governments will lx;
tested in their resolve as in the past," he said, re
ferring to incidents such as the China India lx>r
der war in 19(>2.
With the expected emergence of ('hina in the
21st century with its great militaiy and political
power, some experts see the return of the high
ly advanced colony to the mainland as not only
