# Gene therapy combats autoimmunity
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Stanford researchers working
with Garry Fathman, professor of
immunology and rheumatology,
have developed a novel approach to
treating diseases caused hy the
body's immune system.
The immune system normally
defends the body against invasion
by marauding pathogens, seeking
and destroying any foreign instiga
tors of illness. In rare circum
stances, however, this powerful ally
turns against the body's own
healthy cells and becomes the
source of disease. Ailments in
which the immune system attacks
the body are allied autoimmune
diseases and include multiple scle
rosis, rheumatoid arthritis and
human insulin diabetes.
Stanford researchers working in
Fathman's lab have successfully
developed a technique that shows
enormous promise for treating
autoimmune diseases. The tech
nique, perfected in mice, introduces
a gene that inhibits the immune
response into the misbehaving
cells, thus stopping the immune
system's assault on the body's
healthy cells
In autoimmune diseases, the
immune system misidentifies parts
of the human body as foieign and
activates the immune response
against that part of the body. For
instance, in patients suffering from

multiple sclerosis, a specific type of
T-Iymphocyte that patrols the cen
tral nervous system erroneously
attacks myelin cells that sheath
and protect the nerves.
"The myelin acts as an insulator
of the electrical impulses that trav
el through the nervous system, to
and from the brain," Fathman said.
"If you damage the myelin, you
short out the nerve." Once the
nerves cannot transmit electrical
impulses, the patient loses motor
control, suffers from complete
paralysis or even dies.
Working with experimental
autoimmune encephalitis, (lie
mouse analogue to multiple sclero
sis, the Stanford researchers (level
oped a technique to shut off the
immune response of the misled T
lymphocytes. The investigators
began hy engineering a virus with
the genetic code for synthesizing
interleukin-4, a hormone which
suppresses the immune response.
They then injected the virus into
the T-lymphocytes in the lab to ere
ate interleukin-4 producing T lym
phocytes. Once injected into the
mice, these modified T-lympho
cytes secreted interleukin-4 around
the segments of the central nervous
system under attack by the
immune system, thus inhibiting
the autoimmune response.
"T-lymphocytes are like children
— they are neither good nor bad,"
Fathman said. "We've just reedu
cated the T-cells." Mice treated

using this "re-education" approach
developed encephalitis later and
showed less severe symptoms than
those not treated with the tech
nique.
After more studies on mice, the
model of treatment developed could
he adapted to humans to treat mul
tiple sclerosis. "This is the first
time anyone has shown thatlinter
leukin-4| can be delivered to a sjx.'
cific site, bypassing problems asso
ciate! with delivering an immuno
suppressive drug to the entire
body," said Michael Shaw, a post
doctoral fellow in Fathman's lab.
Injecting a patient with an
immunosuppressive drug inhibits
the entire body's immune system,
leaving the body vulnerable to
opportunistic diseases and exposing

the body to high levels of toxicities.
However, l>y selectively shutting
down parts of the immune system,
said Fathman, "we may be able to
have the benefit of current thera
pies for autoimmune disease with
out the side effects of global
immunosuppression."
Shaw added: "You can imagine
applying this method to any inflam
matory autoimmune disease dis
eases like rheumatoid arthritis and
diabetes. In fact, you can also imag
ine that it's applicable to ot her situ
ations where you might wan! to
alter the immune response. It
would bo very helpful to In- able to
heighten the immune response
against cancer cells, for example,
and to interfere with the immune
attack of transplanted organs."
