# Bug explains the origin and development of chewing gum

/j • I 'vr been hind of tense lately, with
v/• finals coming up, so I've been chewing
a lot of gum. I was wondering whether or not
my behavior is normal. Also, since I'm chew
ing so much of it, I wanted to know what
chewing gum is and how it's made.
A .Don't worry! Your behavior is quite
• normal. Gum, or something like gum,
has been chewed by humans for a very long
time. We know that the ancient Greeks

chewed mastiche, resin obtained from the
bark of the mastic tree. It was believed to
freshen breath and clean teeth. Modern
chewing gum is chewed for similar reasons.
Additionally, many people feel more relaxed
when chewing. For this reason, gum is still
included among the ration packs issued to
U.S. soldiers.
More recently and closer to home, Native
Americans chewed the resin from spruce
trees. Colonists of the Americas observed
this and took up the habit. Spruce gum was
sold in the eastern United States in the early
1800s. Around 1850, sweetened paraffin w;ix

came into favor and quickly became more
popular than the spruce gum.
In the process of looking for a substitute
for rubber, industrial developers came upon
chicle. Chicle is derived from the sap of the
sapodilla tree, a tropical evergreen found pri
marily in the Yucatan peninsula. The
sapodilla tree can grow as tall as 50 feet and
produces a brown edible fruit in addition to
chicle. Unfortunately for the developers,
attempts to vulcanize chicle failed.
Fortunately, in working with the chicle,
properties of the dried resin wen; discovered
that were very interesting. The resin was

completely insoluble in water and very mal
leable. It turned out th.-»t this material held
flavor well and chicle became the principal
ingredient of chewing gum by the late 1800s.
('hide is collected from the sapodilla trees
by cutting intersecting lines in the trunk .'io
feet or more above the ground. The milky
sap is released and collected. Trees are
tapped about every five years. Because of the
intensive labor involved and the gradual
reduction in the number of trees available,
chicle gave way to artificial replacements in

the 19405. Polymers like polyviny
lacetate are now used instead, as
are some other natural gums. Un
like the previous changes in gums
(from spruce to wax to chicle), sub
stitutions for chicle did not signifi
cantly alter the or qual
ity of the product.
Chicle-based gum became mass
produced beginning in the 1870s. In
1871, Thomas Adams was granted

the first patent on a gum-making
machine. He added licorice flavor
ing and marketed the first flavored
chicle-based gum, Black Jack.
The process of making gum is di
vided into two steps: making the
gum base and using the base to
make the actual gum. Chicle (or its
modern replacement) is first melt
ed, washed and filtered. This re
moves any impurities that are pre
sent. Then it is blended with natur
al and synthetic resins, waxes and
plasticizers. This compound is heat
ed and mixed until it is uniform and
then cooled into blocks. This

blocked gum base is kept until it is
needed.
Gum is composed of about 25
percent gum base, 55 percent pow
dered sugar, 18 percent corn syrup
and 2 percent colors and flavoring.
The ingredients are measured out
in these proportions, heated to
about 175 degrees and blended.
After cooling, the gum is rolled until
it is thin enough and then cut,
wrapped and packaged.
Many variants on basic chewing
gum exist. Sugarless gum has been
around since the 19505. Sugar alco
hols (like mannitol and sorbitol) are

substituted for sugar. In addition,
aspartame (Nutrasweet) is added.
Sugar-coated gum (like in gum
balls) is made by heating pieces of
gum with sugar syrup, powdered
sugar and flavorings. This results
in the shiny, polished shell.
Bubble gum is basically the same
as regular chewing gum except that
its base is formulated with rubber
latex, giving it greater strength.
The first bubble gum developed ac
tually was never marketed because
it was so sticky that turpentine was
required to remove it from skin.
Ouch!
