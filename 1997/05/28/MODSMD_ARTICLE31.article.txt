# Bug explains the origin and development of chewing gum

/j • I 'vr been hind of tense lately, with
v/• finals coming up, so I've been chewing
a lot of gum. I was wondering whether or not
my behavior is normal. Also, since I'm chew
ing so much of it, I wanted to know what
chewing gum is and how it's made.
A .Don't worry! Your behavior is quite
• normal. Gum, or something like gum,
has been chewed by humans for a very long
time. We know that the ancient Greeks

chewed mastiche, resin obtained from the
bark of the mastic tree. It was believed to
freshen breath and clean teeth. Modern
chewing gum is chewed for similar reasons.
Additionally, many people feel more relaxed
when chewing. For this reason, gum is still
included among the ration packs issued to
U.S. soldiers.
More recently and closer to home, Native
Americans chewed the resin from spruce
trees. Colonists of the Americas observed
this and took up the habit. Spruce gum was
sold in the eastern United States in the early
1800s. Around 1850, sweetened paraffin w;ix

came into favor and quickly became more
popular than the spruce gum.
In the process of looking for a substitute
for rubber, industrial developers came upon
chicle. Chicle is derived from the sap of the
sapodilla tree, a tropical evergreen found pri
marily in the Yucatan peninsula. The
sapodilla tree can grow as tall as 50 feet and
produces a brown edible fruit in addition to
chicle. Unfortunately for the developers,
attempts to vulcanize chicle failed.
Fortunately, in working with the chicle,
properties of the dried resin wen; discovered
that were very interesting. The resin was

completely insoluble in water and very mal
leable. It turned out th.-»t this material held
flavor well and chicle became the principal
ingredient of chewing gum by the late 1800s.
('hide is collected from the sapodilla trees
by cutting intersecting lines in the trunk .'io
feet or more above the ground. The milky
sap is released and collected. Trees are
tapped about every five years. Because of the
intensive labor involved and the gradual
reduction in the number of trees available,
chicle gave way to artificial replacements in
