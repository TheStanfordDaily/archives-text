## Cyclists win third straight 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
For the third year in a row,
the Stanford cycling team
claimed both the national team
title and the all-around champi
onship for road, mountain bik
ing and track events. The
events, which took place in
Durango, Colo., last weekend,
marked a spectacular event in
cycling history: Stanford became
the first school to win three con
secutive titles on the road.

Stanford faced one of its major
competitors, Colorado, which has
consistently won titles in the
past. The Cardinal, however, was
able to top the Buffaloes by a sig
nificant margin, beating them
267-251. They also defeated
another major threat, Washing
ton, by a similar margin â€” 267-
252.
The team was able to triumph
in another set of races which
combined the three main results
of track, mountain biking and
road races. The primary competi

tors Stanford confronted were
Fort Lewis College and Penn
State. Once again, the Card
brought shame to the other
teams, scoring 67.5 and topping
all other scores by at least seven
points.
The scoring system gave equal
weight to the men's and women's
teams, and Stanford was able to
conquer more than 40 competi
tors. The formula for determin
ing team scoring is complex, and

the overall score is derived from a
variety of sources including the
team time trials and criterium.
The cycling team has trained
long and hard for its well-deserved
victory. Several training strategies
were employed, with the main
focus on the team performance
instead of the individual players.
"Squad selection is more a mat

ter of risk management than com
position for excellence in a specific
event," said coach Art Walker. "If
you're not a contender, you can
maximize the chances in one event
or for one rider, but we are a con
tender and believe that the team
result is what it's all about."
Strong contributors to Stanford
success on the men's side were doc
toral students Pete Armitage, a
team captain, and Dave Bailey.
Bailey has been critical to Stan
ford's success in the team time tri
als over the years and had a

tremendous performance for the
championships.
On the women's side, master's
student and captain Cindy Fergu
son helped sustain Stanford's lead
in the final racing event and placed
11th in the criterium. Medical stu
dent Cathy Norbatus finished 13th
in the criterium and had an all
around impressive performance.
Due to unexpected weather con
ditions in one of the major events,
road racing, was canceled.
"Even if this event occurred,
the outcome would not have been

significantly different," Armitage
said. "If anything, Stanford
would have won by an even larger
margin."
This optimism is shared by the
rest of the team. Next year, the
title looks like a tangible possibility
once again. Because the squad will
lose three key players to gradua
tion, it will have to rely on the
effort of up-and-coming players.
"Next year looks like a rebuild
ing season," Armitage said. "How
ever, we all said that last year and
look where it got us."
