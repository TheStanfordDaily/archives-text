Sailing closes gap

The Cardinal gained little
ground but stayed in contention
after day two of the women's sail
ing national championships in
Portland, Ore.
Stanford moved up one spot
to fifth with 87 points, 23 behind
Navy and Connecticut College.
After a rough start, Brown closed
within nine points of first; Dart
mouth stands in fourth with 79.

The Cardinal trailed Navy
34-9 after one day but capitalized on Midshipmen

place finishes in the A and B division in the third race

yesterday gave the leaders breathing room.
The final day of competition begins at 9 a.m. today.
