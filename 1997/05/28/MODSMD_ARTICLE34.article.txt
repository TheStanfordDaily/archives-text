# Let's make it seven: baseball at the CWS
## 
### 
I have discovered over the
last four years that it has
become increasingly harder
for your typical Stanford athlete
to stand out among his or her
colleagues.
Let's face it: Our standards
for Cardinal athletes have been
set pretty damn high. You may
be a good golfer, but did you win
the Masters in your first try as a
pro? You may have won a
national championship, but the
question is how

many you have won in a row.
In the last two weeks of post
season college athletics, two
teams — the men's and
women's tennis teams — cap
tured national titles, pushing
the University's national cham
pionship total for the year to a
record six titles.
However, perhaps lost in the
wake of the storm caused by the
outstanding performances of
the tennis squads, is yet another
team that might sneak up on
everyone next week in Omaha,
Neb., and capture one more
national championship for the
Cardinal.
I speak, of course, of the
Stanford baseball team, which
earned a berth in the College
World Series with a 5-2 victory
Sunday over Fresno State. The
victory capped off an amazing
weekend for the Cardinal slug

gers, who swept through the
West Regional without losing a
game.
While it may seem like I am
just engaging in some good old
fashioned cheerleading, I sin
cerely believe this Cardinal
team can, and will, come back to
campus with the title. Why am I
so confident, you ask?
Well, I could cite Stanford's
power surge over the weekend,
led by sophomore third baseman
and regional MVP Josh Hochge
sang (who finished the tourney
batting .500 with eight hits, five
runs, two home runs and seven
RBIs), junior catcher Jon Scha
effer (who hit .333 with one
homer and four RBIs) and
junior Joe Kilburg (who hit .444
with eight hits, five runs, two
doubles, one triple and one
home run).
While the stats are impres
sive by themselves, the hitters'
confidence and ability to hit in
clutch situations are even more
impressive. If the hitters gear
up for the World Series like they
did for the regional, they should
be able to put up big numbers
for the pitching staff.
It's not like the pitchers
needed that much run support
over the weekend anyway. Led
by the starters — junior Kyle
Peterson (who picked up two
wins in the series), sophomore
Chad Hutchinson and sopho
more Brent Hoard — and so pho
more relief pitchers Tony Cogan
and Jeff Austin, the pitching
staff held its competitors to just
eight runs over the four victo
ries.
Again, the stats are impres
sive in their own right, but it is
the determination and desire
