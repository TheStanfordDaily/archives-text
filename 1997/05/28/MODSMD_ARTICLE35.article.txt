# Collins twins bring fame, basketball skills to Farm
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third in a
three-part series about twins
involved in Stanford athletics.
If there's anyone to begrudge
Chelsea Clinton for her decision to
attend Stanford, it's fellow Class
mates of 2001 Jason and Jarron
Collins.
With one White House press
release, Chelsea displaced the
twins across the coast at Harvard-
Westlake High School in North
Hollywood, Calif., as the most cele
brated incoming freshman. Now,
the attention previously directed at
the likes of Fred, Tiger and Reece
falls on the first daughter, while
the Collins are relegated to second
class celebrity status.
You'd think two of the most

sought-after prep basketball play
ers in the country would deserve
better. They tire, after all, heirs to
the Stanford men's basketball pro
gram previously shepherded by
Brevin Knight. Heck, these guvs
are the biggest Stanford basketball
recruits since . . . well, since....
"They are the most visible, the
most highly rated players that
we've ever recruited at Stanford,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"It would be fabulous if their devel
opment continues — they would be
two of the better players that we've
ever had here."
Then again, the spotlight
doesn't mean much to the friendly,
unassuming twin towers. They've
already had more than their share,
what with two consecutive state
championships and a pair of
sparkling careers that drew the

attention of every major college
basketball coach in the country.
Last month the twins led
Harvard-Westlake to an 80-50
thumping of Hillsdale at Ana
heim Arena to earn the Wolver
ines a second straight Division
111 state championship — a game
in which Jason pulled down his
1,500 th career rebound, break
ing a 31-year-old state record.
Cal-Hi Sports magazine ranked
Harvard-Westlake the top team
in the state, and USA Today
pegged the Wolverines No. 4 in
the nation at season's end.
Combined, the 6-foot-10 twins
(some list Jason an inch taller)
averaged 35 points and 20
rebounds for the Wolverines this
season. Jason earned slightly high
er accolades, earning first-team all
state honors from Cal-Hi (Jarron
was second team) and being named
Division 111 player of the year (Jar
ron was a first-team selection).
But the twins have always been
in it together when it came to
choosing a school. The Collins
pared down a list of 15 schools to
Stanford, UCLA and Arizona.
Rumor had it that the two were
leaning toward Westwood before
their involvement in the now-infa
mous recruiting dinner that led to
the dismissal of then-head coach
Jim Harrick.
One of the biggest factors in
their decision to attend Stanford
was the prospect of playing before
their maternal grandfather, who
lives in the area and is confined to
a wheelchair due to a recent stroke.
"All three of the schools could
develop us basketball-wise," Jar
ron said. "All three could develop
us for life. Stanford was just the
best decision to make."
Harvard-Westlake basketball
coach Greg Hilliard said the influ
ence of their mother, Portia
Collins, "was most influential. It
came right down to the wire. They
were divided and decided they
could go to Stanford."
"In the end, that's the school
they felt most comfortable with,"
Portia said. "The academic bene
fits of the school speak for them
selves. We were in a no-lose situa
tion because all the schools had
their advantages."
At Stanford, the Collins twins
will he joining another pair of
prominent athletic duos: the
Bryans (men's tennis) and the
Hausers (men's cross country and
track and field). Word has it, Jason
and Jarron are harder to tell apart
than any of them.
"They can trick you if they want

to," Montgomery said. "It will take
some time. Generally speaking,
one's hair maybe is cut a little bit
different that the other's, but that
doesn't mean that you know which
is which."
On the court, the two are eas
ier to distinguish. Jason played
center throughout high school,
while Jarron was a swingman,
scoring both inside and out.

"Jarron's a little more skilled
away from the basket," Mont
gomery said. "Jason is definitely
more of an inside, back-to-basket
type of player.
"Jarron shoots it real well fac
ing from deep, but they're both
real big kids that will most likely
have more success around the bas
ket. They complement each other
in a high-low situation."
Montgomery says he can't yet
tell the difference in personalities.
But those close to the twins speak
of Jarron's quick wit and Jason's
humble nature. Jason's favorite

subject is history, while Jarron's is
astronomy. Jason has recently
taken up golf; Jarron plays tennis.
"Jason is more deliberate about
thinking things through," Hilliard
said. "Jarron is more outgoing. He
exhibits more sides of his personal
ity."
The Collins will certainly make
it a crowd on the front line next
year, where the Cardinal already
returns several talented big men in
Tim Young, Mark Madsen, Peter
Sauer, Pete Van Elswyk and Mark
Seaton. But if the twins are as good
as advertised, their arrival could

spell trouble for Pacific 10 Confer
ence foes.
"Ability-wise, they should be
able to come in and have an imme
diate impact," Montgomery said.
But "only time will tell what kind
of impact they will have in our pro
gram. What they do at Stanford
will define their careers."
What they do at Stanford will
also define whether the Collins can
fulfill their dream of playing in the
NBA. In the meantime, though,
they'll be content with winning a
starting job — and making people
forget about Chelsea.
