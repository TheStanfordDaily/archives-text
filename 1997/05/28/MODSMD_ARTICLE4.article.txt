The Palo Alto City Council made great head
way in approving the Sand Hill Road Project dur
ing the four-and-a-half hour meeting last night.
Four out of seven issues received nonbinding
affirmative votes, and the council will reconvene
tonight to discuss the three remaining measures.
The council voted 8 to 1 to approve construc

Stanford's west side.
Acknowledging that added rental unit* will
increase the population of Palo Alto by more
than 2,000 residents, the council stressed that
due care will be taken to offer these newcomers

The council also agreed to include a 675
square-foot convenience retail facility within the
rental unit complex, as long as the facility gener

Hill Road," he argued.
Fazzino's appeals were outvoted on the

grounds that the council lacks tin; clout to nego
tiate the preservation of the open space on land
owned by Stanford.
After a lengthy discussion on the construction
of the rental units, the council quickly passed a
unanimous approval of the second issue dealing
with senior housing.
The measure calls for the redevelopment of
the 22.3-acre site previously occupied by the
Children's Hospital at Stanford with 338 inde
pendent living units, 66 assisted living units and
47 skilled nursing rooms.
The third issue dealing with the proposed
expansion of the Stanford Shopping Center hy
1 '20,000 square feet â€” raise*! much concern
among council members.
The council was concerned that mall expan-
