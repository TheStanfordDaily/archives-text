### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council made great head
way in approving the Sand Hill Road Project dur
ing the four-and-a-half hour meeting last night.
Four out of seven issues received nonbinding
affirmative votes, and the council will reconvene
tonight to discuss the three remaining measures.
The council voted 8 to 1 to approve construc
tion of 628 rental units located on 47.8 acres of
Stanford's west side.
Acknowledging that added rental unit* will
increase the population of Palo Alto by more
than 2,000 residents, the council stressed that
due care will be taken to offer these newcomers
the same high level of service enjoyed by other
Palo Alto residents.

The rental unit construction agreement also
binds Stanford to build a child care facility. Fur
thermore, a bicycle / pedestrian connector path
from the Oak Creek apartments to the Stanford
West apartments will be maintamed.
The council also agreed to include a 675
square-foot convenience retail facility within the
rental unit complex, as long as the facility gener
ates adequate revenue.
City Councilman Cary Fazzino was the single
opponent of the measure to build the rental units
north of Sand Hill Road.
"We have the opportunity to provide both
housing and open space. The area south of Sand
Hill Road is better for long-term housing, since it
would not lead children to cross the busy Sand
Hill Road," he argued.
Fazzino's appeals were outvoted on the

grounds that the council lacks tin; clout to nego
tiate the preservation of the open space on land
owned by Stanford.
After a lengthy discussion on the construction
of the rental units, the council quickly passed a
unanimous approval of the second issue dealing
with senior housing.
The measure calls for the redevelopment of
the 22.3-acre site previously occupied by the
Children's Hospital at Stanford with 338 inde
pendent living units, 66 assisted living units and
47 skilled nursing rooms.
The third issue dealing with the proposed
expansion of the Stanford Shopping Center hy
1 '20,000 square feet — raise*! much concern
among council members.
The council was concerned that mall expan-
sion would exacerbate the traffic
situation in Palo Alto.
"In most urban locations, traffic
alfects someone's highways. Here
it interferes with people's everyday
lives," asserted City Councilwoman
Sandy Eakins.
The council's original position
favored limiting the expansion of
the shopping center to an addition
al 80,000 square feet.
Stanford's agreement to build
two parking structures that con
formed to the council's request for
height and use of underground
space served as leverage in the Uni
versity's ability to garner support
for an additional 40,000 square
foot increase.
Stanford also agreed to prohibit
leasing any expansion footage to an
"anchor tenant" without the city
council's approval. An "anchor ten
ant" is defined as a store that occu
pies more than 40,000 square feet.
After debating the implications
of the magnitude of the shopping

mall expansion, the council again
voted 8 to 1 to change the expansion
figure to 100,000 square feet. The
change will be negotiated with Uni
versity representatives upon the
council's vote on the entire project.
The final issue discussed last
night involved the wideningof Sand
Hill Road to four lanes from Santa
Cruz to Arboretum and a two-lane
extension from Arboretum to El
Cam in o Real.
Emphasizing safe bicycle and
pedestrian crossings, the Council
voted unanimously in favor of the
measure, choosing a road design
that would make the future expan
sion of the Arboretum-El Camino
Real segment to four lanes very ex
pensive.
"Allowing the possibility of four
lanes would lead to a creation of an
expressway," argued Fazzino.
Following a half-hour of discus
sion on the future development
around Sand Hill Road, the council
decided that this issue demanded a
more complicated analysis than
warranted by the late hour.
The council plans to reconvene
tonight at 7:30 to resume discus
sion on the project.
