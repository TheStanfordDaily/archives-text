# Policy concerning priority questioned
## Two Draw groups unassigned after putting Castaño as top choice on list 
### Katie Chang 
Two Draw groups, who had be
lieved that their priority almost
guaranteed them housing in Cas
tano — the public policy theme
house — are currently without
any housing assignment for next
year.
These students were among the
38 who received priority at the
theme house. They and the staff at
Castano mistakenly believed that
the 30 slots in the house reserved
for priority students were guaran
teed to be filled by residents with
priority.
"We thought we were compet
ing among those 38 students for
the 30 priority slots," said Mike
Chen, a junior in one of the Draw
groups.
As a result of the misunder
standing, only 11 students drew
into Castano this year with priori
ty. Members of the house staff,
who had expected that number to
be closer to 30, said they are con
cerned about the efficacy of Cas
tano as an public policy theme
house.
"Priority [students] are a core
group of people that are really
going to carry the focus program
ming and are vital to maintaining
the intellectual life of the dorm,"
said senior Emily Behr, focus as
sistant and priority coordinator
for Castano. "It is going to put ad
ditional pressure on us, and it has
potential to really compromise the
integrity of the focus."
Two technical issues lie at the
root of the Castano misunder
standing. The first is the concept
of a "cutoff' point. For students
who draw unpreferred, their Draw
number plays a bigger role than
their priority status in specific
dorms.
Those who received numbers
above the cutoff point — which
this year was 2,682 for men and
2,786 for women — did not receive
housing in the first round. In-

stead, they were moved automati
cally to a waiting list where they
will be assigned housing as stu
dents refuse their assignments.
Second, the priority system
only comes into play for those stu
dents who receive lower numbers
than the cutoff points. If an indi
vidual has priority and draws
below the cutoff point, he or she es
sentially "bumps out" students
without priority from their spaces
until the slots are filled.
Although 875 was the highest
number this year for men and
women who drew into Castano
without priority, those who did
have priority had numbers up to
2,570 for men and 2,379 for
women.
Officials at Housing Assign
ment Services said they believe the
problem occurred this year not
only because of the misunder
standing about the priority system
but because of an increased num
ber of unassigned students.
Kathleen Bransfield, informa
tion systems specialist at Housing
and Dining Services, said, "I think
that some education needs to go on
about the way that priority works.
Also, houses should take into con
sideration whether the students
they are giving priority to are pre
ferred or unpreferred when they
are deciding how many priorities
to give out."
Bransfield emphasized that the
number of unassignable students
decrease if more students agreed
to being assigned to any house.
The staff of Castano raised
doubts about the effectiveness of
the current Draw and priority sys
tems. "If they have a focus house,
they need to have a commitment to
it," Behr said. "This system really
hurts the intellectual houses."
Behr added that the staff did
not want to compromise the quali
ty of their priorities. "We really
want to make sure that it is a qual
ity priority and students are really
interested in public policy."
