Earlier this week, the Provost's
Office announced the five finalists
who will vie to become dean of ad
missions and financial aid an of
fice that will he vacated .July 1
when current Dean James Mon
toya assumes the position of vice
provost for student affairs.

The five candi
dates include:
Bruce Poch, dean
of admissions at
Pomona College;
Holly Thompson,
senior associate
director of admis
sions at Stanford;
Carol Lunken
heimer, director

of admissions at Northwestern
University; Joe Allen, vice provost
for enrollment at USC; and Robert
Kinnally, dean of admissions at
Sarah Lawrence College.
According to Assoc. Provost
Ann Fletcher, a 14-person commit
tee conducted an extensive nat ion
al search for suitable candidates to
fill the position.
"We placed ads in the ('hronicle
for Higher Education and sent let
ters out to other institutions and
their directors of admissions,"
Fletcher said. "In addition, we've
been meeting with Jim Montoya
and other staff members in admis
sions and financial aid, as well as
the president, the provost and I for
mer I )ean of Admissions! Jean Fet
tor."

Assoc. Industrial Engineering
Prof. Margaret Brandeau, who
chairs both the search committee
and the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid, said about 40
applications were received for con
sideration.
"We're open to any form of ex
cellence," Brandeau said. "Our ap
plicant pool ranged from people
with a great deal of admissions ex
perience to someone with lots of fi
nancial aid experience but not
much admissions experience."
Each applicant was required to
submit three letters of recommen
dation, which were considered very
carefully in the decision process.
"Basically, we're looking for intelli
gent, high-quality, experienced
people who are extremely well
thought of by their colleagues,"
Brandeau said.
Mrandeau also emphasized the
importance of selecting a new dean
who understands the uniqueness
of Stanford undergraduate admis
sions. "We're not Harvard or MIT
or I Yi ne<'ton," she said. "We looked
Ibr top-quality individuals who
might understand the highly selec
tive and unique nature of Stan
ford."
Alt hough the selection commit
tee has reviewed each candidate's
application materials thoroughly
and has spoken with them briefly
over the telephone, the candidates
will all undergo an extensive day
long interview process during their
