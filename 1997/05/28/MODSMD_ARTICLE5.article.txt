## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Earlier this week, the Provost's
Office announced the five finalists
who will vie to become dean of ad
missions and financial aid an of
fice that will he vacated .July 1
when current Dean James Mon
toya assumes the position of vice
provost for student affairs.

The five candi
dates include:
Bruce Poch, dean
of admissions at
Pomona College;
Holly Thompson,
senior associate
director of admis
sions at Stanford;
Carol Lunken
heimer, director

of admissions at Northwestern
University; Joe Allen, vice provost
for enrollment at USC; and Robert
Kinnally, dean of admissions at
Sarah Lawrence College.
According to Assoc. Provost
Ann Fletcher, a 14-person commit
tee conducted an extensive nat ion
al search for suitable candidates to
fill the position.
"We placed ads in the ('hronicle
for Higher Education and sent let
ters out to other institutions and
their directors of admissions,"
Fletcher said. "In addition, we've
been meeting with Jim Montoya
and other staff members in admis
sions and financial aid, as well as
the president, the provost and I for
mer I )ean of Admissions! Jean Fet
tor."

Assoc. Industrial Engineering
Prof. Margaret Brandeau, who
chairs both the search committee
and the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid, said about 40
applications were received for con
sideration.
"We're open to any form of ex
cellence," Brandeau said. "Our ap
plicant pool ranged from people
with a great deal of admissions ex
perience to someone with lots of fi
nancial aid experience but not
much admissions experience."
Each applicant was required to
submit three letters of recommen
dation, which were considered very
carefully in the decision process.
"Basically, we're looking for intelli
gent, high-quality, experienced
people who are extremely well
thought of by their colleagues,"
Brandeau said.
Mrandeau also emphasized the
importance of selecting a new dean
who understands the uniqueness
of Stanford undergraduate admis
sions. "We're not Harvard or MIT
or I Yi ne<'ton," she said. "We looked
Ibr top-quality individuals who
might understand the highly selec
tive and unique nature of Stan
ford."
Alt hough the selection commit
tee has reviewed each candidate's
application materials thoroughly
and has spoken with them briefly
over the telephone, the candidates
will all undergo an extensive day
long interview process during their


Montoya
visits to campus this week and next
week.
During their visit, candidates
will also make public presentations
and field questions from the Stan
ford community during a series of
open forum sessions. Both Fletcher
and Brandeau said they believe stu
dent involvement and feedback are
crucial to the selection process.
"We encourage students to come
to the open presentations," Fletch
er said. "They have usually been
very involved in the past, and their
opi. ... hav. t oven be an im
portant factor in our decision."
Brandeau added, "The selection
committee is bringing the candi
dates to campus this week and next
week in order to allow as many stu
dents and community members as
possible to meet them before the
end of the school year."
According to Brandeau, the
committee will meet after inter
views conclude next week in order
to narrow the candidate field to two
or three finalists. The finalists will
be invited to return to Stanford to
meet with University President

Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice, who will make the
final decision.
Thompson, the only Stanford
candidate for the position, said she
hopes to continue much of the work
that Montoya started during his
tenure as dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid.
"The initiatives for more in
volvement from alumni and stu
dents have been valuable for the
University as a whole, not just ad
missions," Thompson said. "It's
also important to stick fast to hav
ing need-based financial aid — it's
the best way to make resources go
around."
Thompson noted that the Fi
nancial Aids Office would "contin
ue to meet the full demonstrated
need of people that we admit." She
added that a key concern for the
Undergraduate Admissions Office
in the future would be working
with the increasing number of ap
plications each year.
"One of the major issues that
we'll be facing is how to deal with
the growing number of applications
we're receiving — how to get them
read and the ramifications of ad
mitting smaller percentages each
year," she said. "I think that will
definitely be a challenge."
