# ASSU certifies sophomore class slate
## Senate ignores own bylaws, overturns actions from previous week's meeting 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The new ASSU Senate wasted no time stir
ring up controversy during its first official
meeting last night, voting to disregard its own
bylaws and certify the 1997 Sophomore Class
presidents election.
By certifying the election, the senate in
stalled the members of the Cardinal Quad slate
as Sophomore Class presidents and overruled
the old senate, which voted last week to deny
certification in that election.
The controversy arose late in the three-hour
meeting during senate consideration of a bill to
amend the ASSU Bylaws temporarily to allow
the Sophomore Class president election to be
certified five weeks after it occurred. Bylaws
state that in order for results to become offi
cial, elections must be certified no later than
four weeks after voting.
During the debate, ASSU Senate Chair Joe
Freund ruled that a motion to suspend the by
laws could not be voted on at the meeting, as
such a motion would need previous notice of
one week. Graduate Senator Mike Colon then
moved to overrule the chair.
Colon argued that instead of suspending the
bylaws, the senate should simply ignore them.
His motion passed — with ASSU Vice Presi
dent Ben Decker casting the deciding vote —
and Freund was overruled.
A bill to certify the sophomore election, au
thored bv Elections Commissioner Ghazal Ba

diozamani, was immediately proposed. After a
lengthy debate, it passed 12-6, with two ab
stentions.
The action raises questions of constitution
ality. Along with the four-week cap on certifi
cation, the bylaws also prohibit reconsidera
tion of a certification vote.
The old senate voted last week not to certify
the sophomore election based on allegations of
campaign spending misconduct by Cardinal
Quad. At issue was a complaint, filed with the
Hearings Committee by an opposing sopho
more slate, that alleged Cardinal Quad spent
more than four times the campaign spending
limit to produce and sell T-shirts. The money
spent on shirts was later raised in sales.
Cardinal Quad members contended that the
hearings officer approved their plan to sell T
shirts. "We wouldn't have done it without the
Hearings [Committee's] approval," said slate
member Megan Cameron. "We thought we
were in the clear, and that's why we made the
T-shirts."
Although the Hearings Committee cen
sured Cardinal Quad for its actions, it empha
sized that the victory could be certified.
In contrast to the fury of the last hour, the
first two hours of the meeting were relatively
quiet, as the meeting ran like a "paint-by-num
bers" affair.
Freund guided the relatively inexperienced
group of senators — only four of whom served
in the previous senate — through a two-hour
lesson in parliamentary procedure during the

meeting. Freund accompanied each senate
agenda item and each vote with a statement ex
plaining the significance of the actions.
Like a child matching color paints to num
bers on a sheet, the senate responded to each of
Freund's instructions by filling in the desired
action.
In a flurry of legislation, it passed six bills,
several of which were holdovers from the old
senate. The bills included a collection of nine
Nominations Commission appointments, the
appointment of directors for the ASSU Pro
gram Board, Publications Board and Speakers
Bureau; an amendment to allow ex-officio sen
ate members to become senate chair; Publica
tions Board allocations for spring quarter; and
the release of $5,800 in Speakers Bureau re
serves.
The senate also reapproved the 1997-98
ASSU operating budget. The budget was
passed last week during an impromptu closed
session, potentially putting the bill in constitu
tional jeopardy. Last night, the budget was
considered entirely in open session.
The senate also elected freshman Matt
Spence as its deputy chair. Spence, who was
unable to attend the meeting, had requested
that the vote be postponed a week so he could
give a platform statement. The ASSU Consti
tution requires that the deputy chair be elected
at the meeting following the election of the sen
ate chair, however, so the senate chose to ig
nore request of Spence, the only declared can
didate, and elected him anyway.
