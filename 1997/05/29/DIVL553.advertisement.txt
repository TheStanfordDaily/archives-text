JVlinor in African Studies
The Center for African Studies offers a minor to undergraduates who choose to
specialize in African Studies. Students pursuing the minor can work with professors to
develop an individual program of study.
One of the most attractive aspects of taking courses relating to Africa is the wide,
interdisciplinary range of topics covered. The many possibilities of study include issues
dealing with history, anthropology, ecology, education, fine arts, medicine, and political
science. In addition to the academic classes offered, there are frequendy classes in
African art as well as language classes offered through the Special Languages
Department.
Students normally apply for the minor in the spring quarter of their junior year. Course
requirements include: 25 units in courses with significant African content; one
introductory course that deals with more than one region in Africa; three quarters of an
African language or six quarters of a non-African language that is spoken in Africa (such
as French or Arabic); a 25-35 page research paper written for an African Studies course.
Students intending to pursue the African Studies minor should complete the Minor
Declaration Form over the World Wide Web. Select "Minor Declaration"from the
Registrar's home page - http://www.leland.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/- to declare,
change, or drop a minor. If the declaration is approved by the Center for African
Studies, the student will be notified and a copy of the form routed to the Registrar's
Office. Upon satisfactory completion of all requirements, final certification of the minor
will be made by the Center for African Studies.
