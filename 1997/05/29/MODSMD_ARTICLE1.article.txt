## Sand Hill gets city OK but more negotiations needed with Stanford 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night unanimously passed the pro
posed Sand Hill Road Project but
made some amendments that will
require more negotiations with
Stanford.
The council will reconvene
Monday to consider Stanford's re
sponse to the proposed changes.
Yesterday's meeting was a con
tinuation of the previous night's
effort that ended in a nonbinding
affirmation of the first four of
seven issues the council identified.
Those issues dealt with new hous
ing on Sand Hill Road, extension of
the road to El Camino Real and ex
pansion of the Stanford Shopping
Center.
One of the major issues ap
proved last night was to preserve a
corridor of open space along Sand

Hill Road.
The original Sand Hill agree
ment negotiated by Stanford and
city staff limited Stanford's devel
opment of the 139-acre parcel
along the road to "academic and
recreational fields" until the year
2010. The council last night voted
to move the date to 2025.
"This represents an area of lim
ited opportunity for us to preserve
open space in this corridor," said
council member Greg Fazzino.
After an hour of discussion, the
council amended the measure to
change the "no development" date
and included a provision that pro
hibits any developments on a land
parcel between Campus Drive and
Welch Road that would increase
traffic flow.
The other major issue approved
last night involved with El Camino
Park, which is leased to the city by
Stanford.
The rent for the El Camino
Park area will be lowered to $1 per
year; in exchange, the city will
allow Stanford to directly lease
non-park areas that include the
American Red Cross, Holiday Inn,
Mac Arthur Park and Downtown
Transit Depot.
Currently, Stanford leases that
land, along wit h El Camino Park,
to the city, which in turn sublets
the non-park property.
City staff who negotiated the
agreement pointed out that the
forgone city revenues from the

hotel and other leases would es
sentially offset the financial bene
fit of Stanford's reducing the rent
on the park to $1 per year until
2013.
The revenues were estimated
using a best-case scenario, which
assumes continued high occupan
cy rates at the Holiday Inn.
A more likely scenario — in
cluding at least one economic cycle
downturn before now and 2013 —
would lead to lower revenues, in
creasing the attractiveness of this
arrangement to the city, argued
city manager June Fleming.
Council member Dick Rosen
baum asserted that another virtue
of the proposal is its elimination of
the uncertainty that might arise as
a result of the reappraisal of the
value of El Camino Park.

"I am pleased that Stanford saw
that this is a problem that is not
going to go away until we deal with
it,"he added.
The last issue discussed by the
council was related to technical
matters involving the city manag
er and changing the term of the
agreement to be consistent with
the 2010 date of some of the other
elements of the agreed-on pack
age.
After reaching consensus on all
seven issues, the council recessed
for half an hour to allow the city
staff time to negotiate the pro
posed amendments with Stanford.
"We reached agreement on
most issues, but we will not be able
to resolve two difficult issues
tonight," Fleming reported at the
end of the meeting.
