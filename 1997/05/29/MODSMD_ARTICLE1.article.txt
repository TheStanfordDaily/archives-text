### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night unanimously passed the pro
posed Sand Hill Road Project but
made some amendments that will
require more negotiations with
Stanford.
The council will reconvene
Monday to consider Stanford's re

Yesterday's meeting was a con

the road to El Camino Real and ex

Center.

city staff limited Stanford's devel

along the road to "academic and
recreational fields" until the year
2010. The council last night voted
to move the date to 2025.
"This represents an area of lim
ited opportunity for us to preserve
open space in this corridor," said
council member Greg Fazzino.
After an hour of discussion, the
council amended the measure to
change the "no development" date
and included a provision that pro
hibits any developments on a land
parcel between Campus Drive and
Welch Road that would increase
traffic flow.
The other major issue approved
last night involved with El Camino
