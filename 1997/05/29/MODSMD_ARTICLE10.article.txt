Recent Pfefferbaum case
raises serious concerns
about the rules of tenure

Tenure, according to
the Oxford English Dictio
nary, is the right to remain
indefinitely in one's academic posi
tion. It is granted, the august refer
ence work says, after a certain pro
bationary period, and it protects its
holder "against dismissal under
most circumstances."
At Stanford, though, it does not
appear to be so simple.
In recent months, this campus
has seen extensive protests in reac
tion to the denial of tenure for Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
and Asst. History Prof. Karen Saw
islak. There have been charges lev
eled against various administrators
that the University has no interest
in retaining and promoting faculty
of certain genders and ethnicities
and whose fields of study are inter
disciplinary in nature.
But the larger question — and
the one that is key to the continuing
saga of Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfef
ferbaum — is what exactly tenure
means.
Cases of young faculty fighting to
attain tenure are not uncommon.
But it's less often that a university
finds itself confronting the issue
raised by Pfefferbaum's case: to
what degree tenure can protect the
employment of professors amid the
rancor of academic debates and
sometimes-fierce internal politics.
That's why the Pfefferbaum case
is important to students, staff and
especially faculty, and that's why
the upcoming hearing on his dis
missal must be watched carefully.
Pfefferbaum is a widely respected
psychiatrist who has spent more
than 20 years as an employee of the
University — working, like many
other Stanford medical faculty
members, at the Veterans Affairs
Hospital in Palo Alto. In February

1995, he was demoted by Anesthesi
ology Prof. Richard Mazze, who
serves as chief of staff at the VA hos
pital and associate dean at the Med
ical School. The demotion came
after Pfefferbaum expressed con
cerns about Mazze's conduct to
then-Medical School Dean David
Korn. Pfefferbaum sees a direct
connection between the two events.
By July 1996, Pfefferbaum's
demotion coupled with what he has
deemed to be harassment — both of
himself and of his staff — caused
Pfefferbaum to resign his position
at the VA hospital. He expressly did
not, however, tender a simultaneous
resignation to the Medical School.
The University took his actions
differently. Stanford argued that
Pfefferbaum was employed specifi
cally to work at the VA hospital.
Resigning from the VA post, the
University said, was essentially the
same as resigning from Stanford.
The Santa Clara County Superi
or Court agreed with Pfefferbaum.
The professor was dismissed "with
out the hearing before the Advisory
Board to which he was entitled,"
determined Judge Peter Stone, the
man who struck down Stanford's
speech code in 1995. Tenured facul
ty members can be dismissed only if
the Advisory Board of the Academic
Council reaches a decision to do so.
University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday filed formal
charges against Pfefferbaum with
the Advisory Board. (The last time
the Advisory Board dismissed a
tenured faculty member was in
1971, when an English professor
was terminated for participating in
violent anti-war protests.)
Stone has seen to it that the
administration cannot summarily
remove tenured faculty members
from their jobs. Now, through Pfef
ferbaum's public hearing before the
Advisory Board, we will see whether
he has sufficiently neglected his
duties to justify termination, as the
University insists, or whether he is
being fired simply for being an
inconvenient thorn in the Universi
ty's relations with the VA.
