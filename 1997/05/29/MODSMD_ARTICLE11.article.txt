University places high priority on disabled access issues

IN RECENT MONTHS two student
jgroups and a number of individuals
have publicly questioned what the
University is doing about disabled access
at Stanford. Their queries, calls for action
and efforts to raise awareness at "Tea
and Cookies," "Cookies and Tea" and
other venues have been published in both
Stanford Report and The Daily.
As the chair of the Committee on
Facility Compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, I would like to high
light exactly what the University is doing
to improve access to campus facilities.
The first, and most visible, improve
ments have been all around us in the last
few years. Dozens of facilities, totaling
mo{v than 1 million square feet, have
undergone major renovations or are
being demolished and replaced. All across
t ho,'campus construction projects are cur
rently underway and many more are on
the!way. Each project requires the facili
ties* being renovated or rebuilt conform to
current codes, including the Americans
with Disabilities Act, seismic safety stan
dards, life / safety codes, etc. We estimate
Stanford has spent in excess of $7 million
on accessibility improvements alone as

part of current construction activities.
As significant as these expenditures
are, the University also recognized that a
comprehensive program to identify and
prioritize access improvements was nec
essary.
Therefore, in July 1996, Geoff Cox,
vice provost for institutional planning,
convened the Committee on Facility
Compliance with the Americans with Dis
abilities Act. The committee membership
includes representatives from Facilities
Operations Zone Management and Public
Works, Facilities Project Management,
the Disability Resource Center, the Cen
ter fort he Study of Language and Infor
mation, the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, the School of Medicine, the Plan
ning Office, the Department of Athletics,
Housing and Dining Services; it also
includes student representatives.
The committee is charged to:
• Recommend an overall approach to
prioritization, funding and implementa
tion of barrier removals;
• Oversee the completion of an ADA
based building survey;
• Prioritize individual building modifi
cations;

• Develop an information distribution
system for departments that will imple
ment barrier removal projects and devel
op new projects; and
• Develop a process to handle com
plaints concerning specific barrier
removals and / or accessibility enhance
ments.
Since the committee began meeting in
September, it has focused its attention on
the completion of a comprehensive ADA
based building survey. This survey will
form the basis for prioritization of barrier
removal projects throughout the campus.
In the preparation of the scope of work to
be included, the committee is asking the
selected firm to survey roughly 4.5 mil
lion square feet of space on the campus
that has not been specifically surveyed
and to evaluate existing surveys and
ongoing programs in an additional 2.6
million square feet of campus buildings.
Last week, the committee issued a
request for proposals to five independent
consulting firms that are qualified to per
form the survey. The selection process is
currently on track to choose a consultant
before Commencement and conduct the
survey this summer. The critical next step,

which will take place when the committee
reconvenes in the fall, is to tackle the list
of specific architectural barriers identified
by our consultant over the summer and
from that list develop and propose criteria
by which projects can be prioritized and
packaged for design and construction.
In addition, the committee has taken
action on recommendations included in
an accessibility survey that was already
completed for the Fire Truck House.
That survey addressed the issues associ
ated with lack of access to the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
which is located on the second floor of the
building. Based on the committee's rec
ommendation, $280,000 was requested
and obtained to install a much-needed
elevator in this building. The project is in
the final stages of design, and the eleva
tor should be in service for fall quarter.
Clearly the committee has much work
to do in the coming months to fulfill its
charge, but I am confident that we have
the right representation to make substan
tial progress in the removal of barriers to
access at Stanford.
