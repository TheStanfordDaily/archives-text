## The
						sermon at the Dish 
### 
IN THE BEGINNING there was noth
ing. Nada, zero, zilch, zip. And God
said, "Let there be something": and
there was something; and yea, it did
resemble Taco Bell. And it was void and
without form, and darkness was upon the
face of the Quad; and the Spirit of God,
hereafter called Leland, did call the struc
ture Stanford University.
And Leland said, "Let there be faculty";
and there was faculty. And Leland saw
that the faculty did much research and did
much desire tenure; and 10, some did gar
ner much recognition for they did win the
Prize Nobel or the Prize Pulitzer, and
Iceland saw that this was good.
And Leland said, "Let there be students
in the midst of the air, and let them learn
from the faculty." And 10, a student body
was created in the firmament, and adoles
cents did come from far and wide to learn.
And yea, they did study much and did gar
ner scores in the 99th percentile on the
test standardized. And Leland said, "Let
there be departments in the sciences and
the humanities, so there is variety": and it
was so. And many a student did earn many
a degree from many a faculty many a time,
and with much pleasure, one day.
And Leland said, "I need more money;"
for faculty and rent did cost many a dollar.
And Leland said, "Let there be housing
and food service, so I might take advantage
of the naive undergraduates. And let the
housing be somewhat reasonable and the
rooms not too large. And let the food be

cost-efficient and let taste be none too
important"; and it was so. And Leland did
call this service Housing and Dining, and
many a student did regret buying a meal
plan, a second day.
And Leland said, "Let there be alterna
tive housing. But let there not be too much
of it as to diminish dorm income;" and it
was so. And Leland did call this housing
the Row and it did take up much of May
field Avenue. And Leland said, "Let there
be a system by which students may live in
all housing;" and He did create the Draw,
and there was much wailing and gnashing
of teeth. And many a student did enter the
Draw, and half did draw preferred and half
did not. And some did draw unguaranteed,
and yea, some did get verily screwed. And
many a student did earn many a degree
from many a faculty many a time, and with
less pleasure, a third day.
And Leland said, "Let there be groups
of students to create enjoyment, distrac
tion and procrastination, and let them be
few in number. Let the male groups have
housing and the females have none. And
let them have many parties with much
alcohol"; and it was so. And Leland called
these groups Greeks and did enforce an
alcohol policy the likes of which no other
school has seen. And there was much liba
tion and minor-in-possession charges. And
10, many a student did hook up with many
a Greek and did regret it the following
morning, a fourth day.
Then Leland said, "Let the year be

divided in four and let each quarter be
taken up with no more then 20 units";
and it was so. And many a student did
curse the quarter system and did pay the
price for taking too many a unit by
pulling too many an all-nighter. And
sleep-deprivation did sweep the land like
a plague. And Leland did create the Cof
fee House for students to gather caffeine.
And many a student did earn many a
degree from many a faculty many a time,
and with the shakes, a fifth day.
Then Leland said, "I cannot remem
ber all the names of that which I have
created": and he did create many a mean
ingless acronym for many a meaningless
place. And 10, that which was nine sylla
bles was now two. And many a student
did see Flicks at Mem Aud and sup at the
Co Po, a sixth day.
And Leland did finish his work on
Stanford, and on the seventh day did rest
and look upon it. And Leland saw that it
was good, if not better than average. And
U.S. News & World Report did agree with
Him. And many a student did earn many
a degree from many a faculty many a
time, and the real world did come upon
them, a seventh day.

to say. .. for now.
