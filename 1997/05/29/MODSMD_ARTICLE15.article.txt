## Cardinal golfers plan to keep summer productive 
### Jeff Ellingson Staff writer 
After four years with the Stanford golf pro
gram, seniors Conrad Ray and Pete Ligotti will
take one last look back on their collegiate
careers before heading off the Farm for good.
"It's been a good four years, but I wish I had
a couple more," Ray said. "In the next couple
years, this is going to be a team to reckon with."
While most of the Class of '97 begins tackling
real-world jobs and applications to graduate
programs, Ray will enter the far more capri
cious but equally competitive world of pay-for
play golf.
"It's scaxy because there's no financial guar
antee involved," Ray said. "But I feel good about
the way I've been playing this spring about my
improvement — I'm just going to try to keep
that up."
After playing as an amateur for the summer,
Ray will attempt to get his tour card, which
would allow him to enroll in the official profes
sional tour and practice and play full time.
Last week, Ray bounced back from a disap
pointing finish at the NCAA West Regional to
set a course record of 66 while playing in the
first-round qualifier for the U.S. Open. A strong
performance in the next qualifier could launch
him into the field as an amateur.
"When Conrad Ray can go out and shoot 66
on a long, difficult course after having played it

only once and set a new course record, that
shows what kind of a potential he will have as a
pro," said Stanford head coach Wally Goodwin.
"I've never had a player who grew as much as a
player in four years as Conrad did."
Ligotti will also try his hand at amateur golf.
Although Ligotti did not start competing
with the varsity squad until late in the season,
he provided a boost for the Cardinal during the
West Regional, when he opened the first nine
holes of the first round on fire, notching a
remarkable 33. Although his 46 on the back left
him with an unimpressive 79 for the round, he
recovered nicely to post the low Cardinal score
for the second round, a 3-under-par 69.
"The average person wouldn't have recov
ered from the disappointment and frustration
Goodwin said. "That was one of the all-time
great turnarounds I've seen in golf."
Even if Ligotti's future does not lead to an
illustrious career on the PGA tour, he will prob
ably use his mechanical engineering degree to
stay close to the sport through the golf equip
ment industry.
Without Ray and Ligotti, the returning
members of the golf squad will spend their sum
mer working hard to ensure that next season is
as or more successful than this year.
"My plans are to play a full summer sched
ule, no different than any other year," said
sophomore Joel Kribel. In addition to his regu
lar training and tournaments, Kribel will com

pete Monday in the Sectional Qualifier for the
U.S. Open along with Ray.
One addition to Kribel's full summer sched
ule which should not be overlooked is his invita
tion to the Palmer Cup. A tribute to the leg
endary Arnold Palmer, the tournament carries
international prestige for everyone invited, even
in its inaugural year.
"Joel has been selected to represent the U.S.
in this international matchup," Goodwin said.
"It will be played much like the Walker Cup
Matches and (will be attended by) the best colle
giate players from the U.S. and Europe."
Freshman Dusty Brett hopes to enter the
season next fall with his momentum already
established.
"This year was a big step for me in getting
used to college tournaments," Brett said. "I
know a lot more about the game now, and doing
well in some tournaments in the spring helped
get my confidence up. I plan to work hard this
summer and come back stronger next year."
Joining Brett will be freshman Michael
Weimer, who plans to practice hard and com
pete in the Pacific Northwest Golf Association
Championship Tournament in mid-July.
Golf is "a crazy game," Kay said. "When
you're on the course you have to be your own
best friend and control all yovir emotions. It's a
game of control, and I think that's what makes
it so intriguing because you can never get too
good."
