# End of Ray's road lies in the PGA
## 
### Brie MacDonald 
No one knew his name. No one
asked him to play. But that didn't
stop senior Conrad Ray from
becoming one of the key members
of the Stanford men's golf team.
Now the walk-on from the Mid
west is on his way to the amateur
golf circuit, and he's got his sights
set on the U.S. Open and the PGA
Tour.
It just goes to show that hard
work and determination can make
all the difference.
"All I want is a shot to play,"
Ray told Stanford head coach
Wally Goodwin when he visited
campus four years ago.
At that time, some top schools
from the Midwest were recruiting
Ray to play football. But the Min
nesota native fell in love with the
Stanford atmosphere and opted to
try out for the golf team instead.
Even though he had been carry
ing his dad's golf bag around the
course since age 6, Ray's first loves
were always hockey and football.
So when he showed up to play golf
in the fall of 1993, he "started out
as a big banger," Goodwin said.
"He had obvious athletic talent
[but] he banged the ball around a
lot," Goodwin said.
That athleticism became even
more obvious as the years went by.
After putting in four hours every
day out on the course, Ray has
worked his way up to become the
captain of the squad and earned
the right to a large scholarship.
Halfway through Ray's senior
year, "something really turned on
the light bulb," Goodwin said. "In
the last part of the season, Conrad
didn't shoot over 74." That's quite
an improvement from Ray's first
year on the Farm, and he shows no
signs of stopping now.
Ray is currently working on
qualifying for the U.S. Open. This
summer he's lined up to play in at
least seven major amateur tourna
ments, finishing off with the U.S.
Amateur in Illinois. When October
rolls around, Ray will be off to
Qualifying School, where he'll
compete for a spot on the PGA
tour.
In order to get his tour card,
which guarantees an athlete cer
tain privileges while on tour, Ray
will have to make it through the
preliminary stages of the qualifiers
and then be one of the low 45 or 50
competitors out of the 150 that
make it to the final stage.
"I've always said, 'Maybe
someday,' " Ray said of turning
pro. "There's no guarantee in

Women's sailing
A poor final two races dropped Stan
ford to a seventh-place finish in the
ICYRA / Sperry Top-Sider Women's
Dinghy National Championships, which
ended yesterday in Portland, Ore.
Stanford was in fifth place after eight
races but out of contention for the title,
and all schools were battling a lack of

golf. It's exciting but scary."
And Ray's success hasn't failed
to make an impression on his
teammates.
"You see the strides he's made,
and it makes you think maybe you
can do the same thing," said junior
teammate Eri Crum, a former
roommate and fellow Sigma Chi.
"Conrad has improved more over
the lost three years than anyone
I've ever seen at the collegiate
level"
Freshman golfer Tylar Lunke
echoed those thoughts.
"He struggled as a freshman,
and now he's a great golfer,"
Lunke said. "He's progressed so
far."
Ray has served as a role model
for all of those freshman athletes
who get to Stanford and are sud
denly faced with the frightening
realization that they're in a whole
new league.
"He's someone to look up to, to
talk to about anything," Lunke
said.
So just how does an unknown,
nonrecruited athlete make it to the
top?
"Being surrounded by good
players and being able to play all
year long has really helped," said
Ray, who shared the green with
Tiger Woods before Woods left
Stanford to turn pro. "Tiger is
potentially the best [golfer] ever. It
can't help but rub off on you."
But it takes more than good
competition and talented team
mates to make the kind of
improvements that Ray has seen,
especially in the past year.
"He's as good a listener as I've
ever had," Goodwin said. "He's
gone as far as anyone I've ever
coached, considering how raw he
was as a freshman. He's wonderful
in every way — one of my all-time
favorites."
Ray's positive attitude also
impressed his teammates.
"Conrad's always taking the
good out of the bad and learning
from his bad experiences," Crum
said.
That determined, optimistic
outlook will be the key to Conrad's
success in the future.
"Getting out there right away,
the first year after college, even for
Tiger is pretty hard. Even though
it feels like I've got a lot on my
mind, I've realized that you've
really got to have fun and enjoy it,"
Ray said. "Stepping outside the
traditional path is different. I'm
opening my eyes to what else is out
there."
Tiger had better watch his back.

Stanford suffered through a brutal
