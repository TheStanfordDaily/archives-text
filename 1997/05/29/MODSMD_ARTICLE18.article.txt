# Winning shouldn't be everything
## Coaches owe athletes more than just titles 
### 
The player-coach relationship is a
delicate one. After working at The
Daily for four months now as one
of the sports editors, I've discovered that
I know a lot about Stanford athletics —
more than I ever wanted to know.

But one of the most interesting and
difficult things to report about is just
how fragile the player-coach relationship
is.
You hear things. Things that no one
wants to discuss on the record. You hear
about how the women's lacrosse team
petitioned for a new coach last year and
didn't get one. So all but three players
quit. The entire varsity squad was
manned primarily with walk-ons — the
only returning starter quit toward the
end of the season.
Or you hear about how members of
the women's gymnastics team went to
the administration with the same
demands. Not coincidentally, their
head coach resigned two weeks ago,
ostensibly to spend more time with her
family.
You hear about how an athlete is
thinking of quitting her team because
she can't get enough attention from her
coach. He, apparently, only focuses on
the winners.
Athlete-coach disagreements are a
persistent problem at Stanford. After all,
a coach can be the single greatest guiding
force in the college career of a student
athlete. A coach shapes the health, tem
perament and character of the athlete.
A good coach can maximize the talent
of the individual and produce the next
Olympic gold medalists or simply pro
duce a healthy well-adjusted student.
A weak coach can breed frustration
and discontent and produce selfish ath
letes and unhappy students.
Think of the Softball coach two years
ago. The athletes raised their concerns to
the administration and wore subse
quently sent on "retreat," which did
nothing to make their coach a better
coach. Hut instead of threatening to quit,
which has become all the rage, the play
ers stuck with it for one more year and
worked with the administrators, getting
them to come to games and observe
coach-player interactions.
This year was their first with a new
coach, and theyountf program has begun
to take shape. The team came close to a
playoff berth this year and is looking for

ward to improving next season.
You'd be surprised by the myriad of
problems these coaches face.
I have often wondered why the track
and field team continues to allow Jason
Lunn to compete despite the fact that he
has been charged with vandalizing The
Bollard eating club earlier this year. The
graffiti consisted of such statements as
"Gays should kill themselves" and "Fag
gots are the downfall of the U.S."
Whose; responsibility is it that a repre
sentative of an athletic team behaves in
such a manner? I suggest that it is at
least, in part, the coach's.
Is it not a reflection on the coach
when a 13-person recruiting class losfcs
10 people by their senior season, as
men's swimming did?
And the administrators in the Depart
ment of Athletics are faced with the ever
difficult decision on how to balance win
ning with character. Plus, sometimes
things are very political.
Coaches are signed for one, three or
five years or, in the cases of Tara and
Mike, six years. This means that con
tracts are continuously being reviewed.
The season of each coach is reviewed at
the close of the season by the Athletics
Department.
Nice coaches who aren't winning
should worry. Stanford does not win six
national titles by not prioritizing win
ning. Not-so-nice coaches who aren't
winning should probably worry, too.
But when it comes to competent
coaches who just aren't player-friendly
like, say, Don Nelson, troubles ensue.
By all measures the women's gymnas
tics coach had done great things with
the team, taking them to the NCAA
Championships her first year as inter
im coach. The team performed strong
ly all year hut faltered at regionals.
Her husband's position as the director
of annual giving in the Athletics
Department indubitably complicated
issues.
The men's swimming coach has won
six NCAA titles in 18 years at Stanford
and has captured the I'ac-10 champi
onship for 16 consecutive years but
apparently has problems holding on to
his swimmers.
Irrespective of all of these problems
that arise from the player-coach relation
ship, I must give credit to those coaches
who are great at Stanford.
The »se are the ones who know that
character-building builds better ath
letes; these are the ones who always put
the health and safety of the athletes
first. They know their sport inside and
out and know how to get the most out of
the team.
They are the ones whose lessons stay
with the athletes beyond their careers in
the sport and beyond their time at Stan
ford.
They are the ones who produce the
real winners.
