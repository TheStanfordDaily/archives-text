# Shen overspent budget by $9,841
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
Rounding out his extravagant
administration, junior Bill Shen
ended his year as ASSU president
$9,841.20 over budget.
Documents provided by the
ASSU financial office show Shen,
whose term expired May 6, spent
$19,091.20; he had been allocated
$9,250.
The president's budget is not
funded through student fees;
rather it comes from interest pay
outs on the ASSU endowment, a
fund of about $2.8 million.
"Clearly, I'm not pleased with
having exceeded my prescribed
budget," Shen said. "I strongly be
lieve that it was an unfortunate re
sult of the new executive structure
and the unprecedented expecta
tions that came with it. Our at
tempts to chart new territory by el
evating the visibility of student gov
ernment as well as its educational
mission didn't come cheaply."
Budget deficits are initially sub
sidized by surpluses in other ac
counts, such as that of the ASSU
Senate, which did not spent its en
tire allocation this year. If that
proves insufficient, debts are cov
ered by funds from the endowment.
Although all payments made
from an ASSU account must be
approved by the financial manag
er or a member of his staff, those
protocols provide little security.
"When an officer of the [ASSU I
orders something or signs a con
tract for services, he does so in the
name of the [ASSU|," Financial
Manager John Hall explained.
"Vendors don't recognize our pro
cedures, and when a bill comes, it
has to be paid."
Responsibility, he agreed, re
mained in the hands of the ac
count bearers — in this case Shen.
The Daily reported in October
that Shen was rapidly closing on

his annual limit, having spent lav
ishly on programming during the
first four weeks of the school year.
In addition to initiatives such
as bike and voter registration,
Shen rush-ordered $3,000 worth
of custom-made, ASSU logo-em
blazoned adhesive notepads to dis
tribute to students — a large frac
tion of which remain in boxes in
the ASSU offices.
Since October, though, Shen's
expenses have been in more logis
tical areas. More than $3,600 in
spring-quarter payouts have been
for space rental, janitorial services
and refreshments for a series of
on-campus events.
According to Shen, his office
co-sponsored a number of student
forums, including "Cookies and
Tea," a public service minor dis
cussion and a interdisciplinary
program panel.
"Reflecting back upon the
array of speakers and programs
my office sponsored, I am proud of
our accomplishments," Shen said.
But not all late-term expenses
were logistical in nature. Shen au
thorized spending $000 on
Franklin day planners for his
staff.
"We were offered by the finan
cial office to purchase these plan
ners," Shen said. "They showed
us the catalog, and we decided to
go along with them."
Shen did, however, significant
ly augment his budget throughout
the year by soliciting co-sponsors
for a number of events. For exam
ple, nearly all of the costs incurred
bring to campus fall quarter
speakers Jesse Jackson, Dinesh
D'Souza and Ralph Nader were
reimbursed by other student
groups.
Co-sponsorship raised more
than $15,000, but that covered
less than half of the $33,000 Shen
spent, leaving his office more than
106 percent over budget.
