# Bon Appetit workers stage protest
## Call for wage and benefit improvement: Employers say demands unrealistic 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Calling for improved benefits
and better wages, 30 food service
workers from Bon Appetit protest
ed outside Tresidder Union at noon
yesterday.
Holding megaphones and chant
ing in English and Spanish, the
workers, all union members, called
on Bon Appetit to produce a new
contract with better wages and
benefits.
"We want a contract to improve
working conditions and to take
care of our families," said Elda
Garcia, a worker employed by Bon
Appetit for eight years, through a
union-provided translator. "We
want them to negotiate in good
faith with us."
Officials from Bon Appetit,
which manages eateries at Tresid
der and the Graduate School of
Business in addition to other col
lege campuses, said union workers'

demands were unrealistic.
"I can't believe the propaganda
they are throwing out there," said
Mary Clark, district manager for
Bon Appetit. "If there was some
thing reasonable proposed, then we
would have something to work
with."
Yesterday's protest continues a
period of bitter contract negotia
tions between union workers and
Bon Appetit management. Since
the formation of a union — Local
715 of the Service Employees Inter
national Union— last June, union
workers and management have
held a series of contract negotia
tions.
Union workers charge that Bon
Appetit has engaged in an open
anti-union campaign, laying off
leaders of the union and deliberate
ly stalling negotiations for a new
contract.
"It was no suprise that when we
got to the bargaining table, the hos
tility was already there," said

Danielle Mahones, an organizer for
the union.
Clark denied union members'
claims that Bon Appetit is unwill
ing to negotiate with its workers.
She said union members had can
celed several proposed meetings

and had taken nine months to pro
duce a complete contract proposal
making it impossible for Bon Ap
petit to give an immediate re
sponse.
