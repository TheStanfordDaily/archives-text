# 'Mission to Mir' simulates space exploration to the max
## NEW FILM USES JUST ONE SPECIAL EFFECT—THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN 
### 
Now playing at Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara,
"Mission to Mir" — the latest of four Imax films about space
exploration — is awe-inspiring. After experiencing this docu
mentary, you will agree that a production about a subject as
immeasurable as this deserves to be projected on the largest
movie screen on Earth.
The film size used in "Mission to Mir" is three times the size
of 70-mm film. The cameras used to record the images are
about as large as a suitcase, and as a result, astronauts were ini
tially very reluctant to take the equipment into space.
Atter seeing Mir in the film, it becomes understandable why
they were so reluctant: The station truly has no room to spare.
Mir has been in orbit since February 19K6, and whatever
nonorganic waste that has accumulated over the years can not
be disposed.
As a result, scientific instruments from the last decade fill up
every nook and cranny of the station. The only reason the as
tronauts are still able to move around is that they simply float
over the equipment stacked in the middle of several modules of
the station.
Another interesting fact superbly portrayed in the film is
that not all modules of the station are aligned in the same di
rection. Relatively speaking, several modules are oriented up
side down. When sitting in the node that connects all the mod
ules together, you can see one person doing an experiment
while another may be running on an upside-down treadmill in
another module.
The message prevalent throughout "Mission to Mir" is that
the human race must forget its differences in order to cooper
ate with each other. It is only in this way that will we be able to
explore space successfully.
The station Mir stands as a symbol of this need to work to

gether. On board, Russians and Westerners work and live to
gether. The name of the station was appropriately chosen to he
mir, the Russian word for "peace."
Initially, "Mission to Mir" takes the viewer behind the
scenes of Russian space exploration, including life .it a Russian
training center for astronauts. 1 iere we get to share in the cul
ture shock that is experienced by the Westerners there. Next,
we see something that until recently was top secret: the launch

ot a Russian spaceship.
Then the film chronicles life aboard Mir from the moment
the shuttle first docks. The emphasis ol the film is mostly on the
ways the astronauts try to make their lives as normal as possi
ble.
Sometimes, the realization that they are in total isolation
comes as quite a shock to astronauts. 1 or example, one crew
member received a book from her daughter. When she came to

the last page of the book, she read: "con
tinned in part two." Knowing that she
wouldn't he able to go to the store to get
part two for several more months marked
one of her most nostalgic moments dm
ing her stay on Mir.
"Mission to Mir,'' which is playing al
several of the 100 Imax theaters worldwide,
makes excellent use ol its gigantic, 15
story-tall screen. II you ever watched a
rocket launch on television and were im
pressed by it, be prepared lo be blown away.
Seeing a nearly life si/eil rocket lake oil on
a screen only (•»() feet away is awesome.
Calmer aspects of the film are no
less inspiring. The images of Mir floating
above the earth are spectacular. I )ne ol the
astronauts who filmed parts of the past
four space films says the Imax experience
is as close as most people will ever gel to
the real thing.
