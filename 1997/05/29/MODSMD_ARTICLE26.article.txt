# The 						Life and times of Den winslow
## A 						writer and private investigator shares the tricks of his trades 
### 
You might say that the characters in
"The Death and Life of Bobby Z" are
larger than life.
But what you might not know is that the
author, Don Winslow, has led a pretty
spectacular life himself.
Here's the way his publisher, describes
him: "Don Winslow has worked as a pri
vate investigator in London, New York's
Times Square and various other places
across the United States. He has also
worked as an actor, a journalist and a cattle
herder. He has sold salad dressing and also
safaris and has been employed as a 'mock
terrorist."'
And you thought your job was interest
ing.
But the varied careers were a departure
from Winslow's original goals. "When I
was a kid I was pretty focused on entering
the Navy," he told Intermission.
1 le expected to follow in the footsteps of
his father, a career Marine and Navy NCO.
1 le later changed his mind; at the Universi
ty of Nebraska in Lincoln, he pursued writ
ing by majoring in journalism before
switching to African history. He went to
South Africa during his junior year, where
he worked as a researcher and freelance re
porter. By this time, his life was taking
completely unexpected turns.
Back in the United States, Winslow
spent four years directing the Historical
Theatre Company. After that, he moved to
the town of Beyond Hope, Idaho, where he
worked herding cattle and delivering salad
dressing. I le ended up in New York, where
he managed movie theaters for three years.
It was in New York that Winslow got his
first job as a private investigator. A friend
hired him to go undercover and investigate
organized theft in a string of movie the
aters. Winslow worked through a detective
agency and stayed on to do assignments in
limes Square, London and Amsterdam.
"It was great from a writer's perspective

because when you're walking around Lon
don, you're never very far from literary his
tory," Winslow said. "The same is true of
New York, but there you have to know
more about it."
Winslow then worked for the Institute
for International Studies by leading a ter
rorist group in a series of simulated
hostage exchanges. He went to graduate
school and got a master's in military histo
ry.
At that point Winslow temporarily quit
the study of crime. He moved overseas and

spent five years leading photographic sa
faris in Kenya and China. He describes
those experiences as his most memorable.
"There were incredible sunrises and
sunsets; it was an intensely beautiful place,"
he said. "And that was my job. It was more
fun than you're supposed to have."
In Kenya, Winslow got engaged to his
wife, Jean, and he then settled down with
his new family in Los Angeles. That's where
he currently resides, doing freelance inves
tigative work and writing.
But how did all of this establish Don

Winslow as a writer?
Winslow decided he wanted to write
when he was still in college. One could say
that his many jobs, particularly those in
volving crime, were opportunities to build
experience for his writing career. While he
is still very much involved in private inves
tigation, he has put his ideas down on
paper. He has written six books, the most
recent of which is "The Death and Life of
Bobby Z."
Because of his hectic lifestyle, the meth
ods by which Winslow wrote this book are
interesting themselves.
"1 wrote it on a train while working on a
case in downtown L.A.," he said. "It was
about an hour and 20 minute train ride
into downtown from where 1 live. So I'd get
on in the morning with a double latte or
something with lots of caffeine, read The
New York Times and spend the last 20 min
utes to half an hour writing."
It took Winslow only 3 1/2 months to
write the book. He didn't spend too much
time editing it, either; he admits to not
having even read the book from start to
finish.
"I'm a little embarrassed about it,"
Winslow said. "But I have one of the best
editors in the world — a guy named Sonny
Mehta — so after his revisions I was pretty
confident that the book was what it should
be."
Winslow's experiences as an investigator
came into play when writing this book.
"Through my work I've interviewed a
lot of guys in prison" he said. "I guess you
get a sense of the career criminal mindset.
Many of them have the same downtrodden
attitude as Tim Kearney (the protagonist of
"Bobby Z"). They're losers."
It's also interesting that the ideas for
" The Death and Life of Bobby Z" all came
at the spur of the moment.
"I never knew from one day to the next
what was going to happen," Winslow re
marked. "I would just type, get this guy
into some hideous situation and go, 'Shit,
now what?' I wanted a random, out-of
control feel to it. Writing teachers hate to
hear this stuff, but it's the truth."
So what are the next great adventures in
store lor Winslow?
"It sounds kind ofgoopy, but the big ad
venture for me right now is my family, lie
said. "I want to show stuff to my son,
I homas. I think I want to go back to the
places I've been and see them through his
eyes.
And there's bound to be more writing.
Winslow is currently working on a book
about arson, titled "California l ire and
Lite." He's also co-authoring a piece ol
nonaction: a biography of Joe Hooper,
decorated Vietnam War veteran.
"l or me, writing is fun," Winslow said.
"It's a great way to see life.' Q
