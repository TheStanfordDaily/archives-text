# The
						Death and Life of Bobby Z Don Winslow; Alfred A. Knopf
## 
### 
Look out, Don Corleone. Here comes
Bobby Z.
"The Death and Life of Hobby Z" is
the newest book by crime novelist Don
Winslow. You can think of it as a crazed
chase through the deserts of the South
west and a peek into the deadly forces of
drug lords and gangs, along with a
pinch of bona fide California cool.
Now you're probably thinking, "That
sounds pretty standard for an action
story these days. What else is new?"
It's obvious that many of the plot ele
ments in"The Death and Life of Bobby
Z" — sex, drugs, guns and close calls —
are overused, but Winslow's style is
unique.
The story is told in the present tense,
adding tremendous vitality to the char
acters and events. On top of that, the
chapters are very short (averaging four
to live pages), which allows the reader to
move through the book with the break
neck speed ol a good action flick.
So just who is Bobby Z?
Bobby Z is a California drug dealer
and former surfer who established his
greatness while he was still in high
school. A smart, hard-dealing business
man, lie evaded the authorities by mov
ing across the ocean, only to mysteri
ously turn himself in to the Drug bn
forcement Agency years later. Now, a
Mexican drug lord named Don Huert
ero wants him treed in exchange for a
hostage 1 >1 A agent.
I lie only problem is, Bobby / is dead.
I hat 's where our real hero, 11111 Kear
ney, comes in. Tims i self-described
lifelong loser and world-class fuckup"
who has gotten himself in jail one too
many times. 1 le has most recently killed
a Hell's Angel named Stinkdog, an un
lucky third strike that counts him out in
the eyes ol California's justice system.
His future looks hopeless: imprison

ment without parole in an institution
where he is bound to die at the hands of
vengeful Hell's Angels.
The only thing that Tim has going for
him are the skills he learned as a Marine
in the Gulf War. That and the fact that
he is the spitting image of Hobby Z.
Tim decides to accept the DEA's offer
to pose as Bobby Zin the tradeoff— a
chance at freedom in return for whatev
er fate Don Huertero has planned for
Bobby Z. Unfortunately, Huertero
wants nothing more than the pleasure
of killing him mercilessly.
Now Tim's stuck in a deal where he's
gotten more than he bargained for.
Everyone is after him, from the Huert
ero's men and the PEA to the Hell's An
gels and a few hired assassins. On top of
that, he discovers Bobby Z's 6-year-old
son, who is a great kid but a sticky trav
eling companion for a man running for
his life.
Tim finds himself taking on not only
Bobby Z's image but his livelihood,
from the money to the women to the
cool Californian attitude. He adds his
wartime survival methods to the larger
than-life perception of Bobby Z to bring
himself past his reputation as a loser and
become the legend.
A great deal of the fun in"The Death
and I.ife of Bobby Z" lies in the baddies.
Apart from the masses of trigger-happy
Mexican goons and gang bikers, Kear
ney is chased by some interesting peo
ple.
For example, there's Bill Johnson, a
ranch cowboy whose foolproof plans
keep backfiring, and the Monk, Bobby
Z's conspiring right-hand man. There's
also an Indian tracker named Lobo
Rojas and a pvromamac called Boom-
Boom.
Meanwhile, Tim is aided in part by
One Way, a Laguna Beach bum who's
infatuated with the legend of Bobby Z.
Poor One Way took a fateful acid trip
and never came back; evervone around
