# T.S. Eliot, reinterpreted
## Senior-project drama production finds rich and innovative material in 'The Waste Land' 
### 
When first published, T. S. Eliot's odd and difficult poem
"The Waste Land" was hailed as a modernist manifesto
and derided as a splintered attempt at an epic.
" The Waste Land" has since wended its way into the com
mon ear and the canon of Western literature, popping up in CIV
ar. 1 City Lights alike.
Tonight, Rat's Coat Theater continues its own version of
Eliot's "The Waste Land," produced by senior drama major
Melanie Simpson as her final project. The performance plays on
the multivocality of the poem, using an 11 -person t.asi.
The dramatis personae range from actual figures such as
Madame Sosostris (albeit played by the distinctly male Geoffrey
Sobeiie) to invented roles in dud ms The German Singer (Anjcl
,V%n who delivers the "Frisch weht der Wind" quatrain in
high chariteuse style.
TSPSSea for dramatizing "The Waste Land" first occurred to

a decrepit New York theater. Although Shaw presented it as a
dramatic monologue, the power and the possibilities of "The
Waste land" capturcd Simpson's imagination.
"It got down to the wire, and I needed to find a senior pro
ject," Simpson said. u 'The Waste Land* was the perfect size, and
1 liked the idea of taking a strong, rich text that still allowed for
play with movement and staging."
Simpson and her adapters have played with the ambiguity of
the original poem, choosing to highlight certain themes and fig
ures. Simpson suggested "Memory and Desire" as the keynote
of her adaptation. She stresses, though, that she's not trying to
give the definitive interpretation of "The Waste Land."
"J don't think the poem can ever be thoroughly understood,"
Simpson said. "And 1 realize that there's something cither very
gutsy or very arrogant about staging such a famous work. ... I
just swallow hard and accept that I can't bring the entire picce
to life."
The unconventional staging of the piece is matched by its lo
cale, When Simpson requested a performance space for " The
Waste Land," she was assigned to Eleanor I'rosser Studio, the
standard senior project stage.
However, Simpson and her partners decided against it, feel
ing it was overused and inappropriate for their performance.
Instead, they began to seek out fresh space, considering con
struction sites and other unusual venues. While walking around
duringa break, Simpson was struck by spatial possibilities of the
loading dock behind Memorial Auditorium,
"The second I saw it, I loved the window above the ramp,"
said Simpson. She realized the window would function as a per
fect device to capture the voyeuristic aspect of the sexual inter
lude between the clerk and the typist. Certainly, the space is fully
exploited: a ladder snakes down one wall, and the double doors
to the dock frame the entrances and exits of the cast.
Still, the space is relatively austere, and much of the setting
effects are created by the actors rather than the props. In one
scene, the actors march in slow, herky-jerky movements to ere
ate the feel ofa dehumanized urban setting; in another scene, set
in a hyacinth garden, the actors crook their arms to denote tree
branches.

While "The Waste Land" was Simpson s brainchild, the pro
duction is extreme|r collaborative limtte, with each actor
working also as a doctor in to the semantics ol
