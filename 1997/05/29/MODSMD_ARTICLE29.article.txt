I )I : .SCI'NI)i.NTS rockin' alone tonight
—"Descendents," 1985
Quick — what's the first thing that springs to mind
when you think "punk rock"? Mohawks? Leather jackets?
Smashing the state? I'm willing to bet it's not dorky thick
glasses, a hot pot of coffee and a doctorate in biochemistry.
Yet these are exactly the attributes that define the De
scendcnts, the recently re-formed Southern California
pop-punk pioneers whose Caffeine Nation Tour — also
featuring Less Than Jake, Guttermouth and Handsome
hits the I.dge on Sunday.
The Descendents may not fit the punk stereotype, but
it's a safe bet that without them, none of today's popular
punk groups — Green Day, Face to Face, The Offspring,
NOFX or even Rancid — would ever have existed.
In 1981, when the Descendents released "Fat," their first
single as a full band, they already stood out among their
Southern California punk peers, bands like Black Flag, The
Adolescents and The Germs. Sure, the same musical influ
ences were there — the inarticulate rage, the sloppy, com
pelling energy — but something set the Descendents apart.
First of all, there was their appearance: led by vocalist
Milo Aukerman, a bespectacled honors student (who real
ly did go to college, leading to the band's first three-year

hiatus) and husky drummer Bill Stevenson, they were a far
cry from the punk norm.
Then there was their subject matter: Rather than ni
hilism or self-destruction, the Descendents sang about
girls, farting, caffeine and hamburgers. And finally, there
was the sound, a driving but tuneful fusion of surf, punk
and pop, anchored by Aukerman's angry-yet-melodic
sing / scream.
The Descendents were never popular on a large scale —
in 1985 they bragged that they "couldn't sell out a tele
phone booth" — but by the time Aukerman left in 1987 to
pursue his biochemistry doctorate, their coffee-fueled
groove and relentless touring had built up a sizable follow
ing and influenced a generation of younger bands who
would follow in their pop-punk footsteps.
But what's innovative at one time can becliched 10 years
later, and the Descendents reunion has been greeted with a
certain degree of skepticism. After all, punk is profitable
now like never before, and the last few years have already
seen far too many long-dormant bands resolve their differ
ences, dust off their amps and trot back out to compete
with their modern proteges for punk rock dollars.
With the Misfits, Social Distortion and even The Sex
Pistols actively touring, what sets the Descendents apart?
What makes their reunion special?
These tire the ALI.-O-Gistics:
Thou shall not commit laundry
Thou shalt covet thy neighbor's food
Thou shalt not create ties with the scathed
Thou shalt always go for greatness. . . .
Let nothing deter you in your quest for ALL.
—"All O-Gistics," 1987
"first of all, it's not a reunion," said bass player Karl Al
varez, who spoke with Intermission during a sound check
on the opening night ofthe Caffeine Nation tour. While the

Descendents name was put to rest
following Aukerman's departure for
grad school, Stevenson, Alvarez and
guitarist Steven Egerton continued
the band under the name All, releas
ing seven albums with a succession of
singers.
To Alvarez, who joined the band
along with Egerton in 1987 just in
time for "All," the last Descendents
album, the two bands are essentially
the same, sharing the same philoso
phy and basic sound and distin
guished only by their lead singers.
"It's kind of like a two-headed
monster thing," he said, explaining
that both bands still exist. "After we
finish this tour, All will record a new
album and do a tour, and then
there'll be another Descendents
album."
The current "reunion" was Auker
man's idea.
"He called us and said he had a
bunch of songs he wanted to do, and
things just mushroomed — it was a
very organic trip," Alvarez said.
"Milo hadn't done music in a while
and had a superabundance of mater
ial, so we decided to cut a full album
and for ease of doing things called
that particular version of the band
Descendents."
There's no doubt that the two

hands are very close: The separation between All and the
Descendents was always blurry. Everyone involved with the
Descendents remained close friends, even those members
who aren't part with the current incarnation. All covered
Descendents songs when they played live.
According to Alvarez, there's always been an "open-door
policy" with regard to Aukerman. He came back to do a
short tour a few summers ago when Chad Price, All's cur
rent lead singer, was unavailable. In many ways, what Al
varez said is true. Aside from the name, All and the De
scendents aren't really that different.
There is a big difference, though, in terms of public per
ception and media interest. All has a devoted cult follow
ing, but it never really hit the mainstream and was still
playing tiny clubs even after 10 years of non-stop touring.
With Aukerman's return, however, things have changed
— there are Descendents videos on MTV, "Everything
Sucks," the new album, has been reviewed in major maga
zines like Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly, and
three tours across the United States and to Europe — a first
for the band — have consistently sold out.
Regardless of this acclaim, however, the band members
insist Aukerman's return was spontaneous and that they're
just as surprised by the reaction as anyone else.
"We're kind of laughing at it," Alvarez said. "There's
kind of a nostalgia trip going on with Milo being back and
everything, and there's certainly a lot more hype nowadays
for the kind of music we play, but that has no relevance to
what's going on with the band."
Alvarez rejects the idea that Aukerman's return was mo
tivated by punk's increased marketability.
"He got tired of doing science for a while and wanted to
do some music again," Alvarez said. "It's just fortunate —
or unfortunate, depending on how you look at it — that he
chose to come back in the current musical climate."
Besides, the Descendents argue, it's not like being a little
bit more successful has changed the band or the way it does

things. Band members are still touring
and sleeping in an old bus and printing
their own T-shirts. As Alvarez sees it,
this is about love, not money — after 10
years of constant shoestring touring,
what other motivation could there be?
"People don't understand that he
sides the top 3 percent of musicians
that are really making a lot of money,"
he said, "the rest of us do this because
we like it, because it's physically plea
surable and intellectually challenging."
And the All experience continues
to meet this criteria for him. After
playing together for so long, Alvarez
says, the Descendents / All family con
nects on a special level.
"There's this disposable nature to
American culture nowadays," Alvarez
said. "Most bands are only together for
four or five years. They have one big
hit song and then they're gone. We're
different — after so long we really
work together well, like some of the re
ally good old rock 'n' roll bands or old
blues or country bands."
Will I sit around and talk about the
old days
Sit around and watch TV?
I never want to go out that way
Never hum out not fade away. ...
What will it he like when 1 get old?
—"When I Get Old," 1996

Even it the band is passionate about what it's doing,
there's still something odd about this comparison to old
bluesmen. It's especially strange because so many Descen
dents songs seem to forcibly reject growing up.
One ofthe All-o-Gistics, the band's "sacred code," pro
claims, "Thou shalt not commit adulthood." Back in the
1980s, Aukerman tauntingly asked, "What you gonna do
when you turn 31?"
Now everyone in the band is older than that. Aukerman
himself, once the king of adolescent girl songs, has been
married for several years. So isn't it a little strange to look
out every night on an audience full of kids that weren't

even in their teens the last time the Descendents were to
gether?
Alvarez says no.
"It's weird if you let it be, but there have always been 11-
year-olds at our shows, even in the old days." He claims
hanging out with a wide range of age groups gives the band
youthful energy to feed off and keeps him from becoming
a "sourpuss old man."
"American society is stratified according to age, and
that's really stupid," Alvarez said. "Artificial boundaries
suck."
The real strength of the Descendents, he said, is a devo
tion to this idea of no boundaries, even as you get older.
"It's about growing older without growing up. . .. Some
people stop questing and stop being" as they get older, he
said, and this is what playing in the Descendents helps him
avoid. "I don't want to end up sounding like my dad. ... I
don't want to end up an ossified judgmental old person."
Despite this philosophy, Alvarez concedes that today's

punk scene is a lot different than the one he remembers.
I le s diplomatic about whether or not he likes the new crop
of pop-punk bands that are, essentially, following in his
footsteps.
"Influence is kind of a tricky thing to talk about. We're
influenced by old bands, like Black Flag, but also by new
bands that are our friends, like Shades Apart."
Overall, however, he said "it seems like there were a lot
more distinct and original ideas before."
Today's punk is useful "for kids to have tribal identity
and for marketing," said Alvarez, "but it's pretty shitty
from a creative viewpoint. The fun of punk in the old days

was that it could be anything — there were no rules about
what was or wasn't punk."
For today's fans, Alvarez says, punk isn't about alien
ation the way it was at the beginning.
"Hack in the day punk kids didn't have the luxury of
choosing who they hung out with," he said. " There were
only a few outcast people who were into that kind of music,
and that was who you hung out with."
Today's punk, he contends, is a teen tribal subculture
like rave or goth or any other, without the threat and the
confrontational energy that once defined it.
But then, Alvarez conceded, that's the way things go.
"As time passes, the things that are confrontational just
end up becoming the norm." Besides, he said, it doesn't
bother him.
"It's outside of my control — my goal is to write songs
that are true to me and play music the way I want to play"
and anything outside that is secondary. That, for him, is
what the Descendents "reunion" comes down to. "The

whole thing is predicated on having .\ bunch of songs that
are lun to do," Ik- said.

With the Misfits, Social Distortion and even The Sex
Pistols actively touring, what sets the Descendents apart?
What makes their reunion special?
These tire the ALI.-O-Gistics:
Thou shall not commit laundry
Thou shalt covet thy neighbor's food
Thou shalt not create ties with the scathed
Thou shalt always go for greatness. . . .
Let nothing deter you in your quest for ALL.
—"All O-Gistics," 1987
"first of all, it's not a reunion," said bass player Karl Al
varez, who spoke with Intermission during a sound check
on the opening night ofthe Caffeine Nation tour. While the

Descendents name was put to rest
following Aukerman's departure for
grad school, Stevenson, Alvarez and
guitarist Steven Egerton continued
the band under the name All, releas
ing seven albums with a succession of
singers.
To Alvarez, who joined the band
along with Egerton in 1987 just in
time for "All," the last Descendents
album, the two bands are essentially
the same, sharing the same philoso
phy and basic sound and distin
guished only by their lead singers.
"It's kind of like a two-headed
monster thing," he said, explaining
that both bands still exist. "After we
finish this tour, All will record a new
album and do a tour, and then
there'll be another Descendents
album."
The current "reunion" was Auker
man's idea.
"He called us and said he had a
bunch of songs he wanted to do, and
things just mushroomed — it was a
very organic trip," Alvarez said.
"Milo hadn't done music in a while
and had a superabundance of mater
ial, so we decided to cut a full album
and for ease of doing things called
that particular version of the band
Descendents."
There's no doubt that the two

hands are very close: The separation between All and the
Descendents was always blurry. Everyone involved with the
Descendents remained close friends, even those members
who aren't part with the current incarnation. All covered
Descendents songs when they played live.
According to Alvarez, there's always been an "open-door
policy" with regard to Aukerman. He came back to do a
short tour a few summers ago when Chad Price, All's cur
rent lead singer, was unavailable. In many ways, what Al
varez said is true. Aside from the name, All and the De
scendents aren't really that different.
There is a big difference, though, in terms of public per
ception and media interest. All has a devoted cult follow
ing, but it never really hit the mainstream and was still
playing tiny clubs even after 10 years of non-stop touring.
With Aukerman's return, however, things have changed
— there are Descendents videos on MTV, "Everything
Sucks," the new album, has been reviewed in major maga
zines like Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly, and
three tours across the United States and to Europe — a first
for the band — have consistently sold out.
Regardless of this acclaim, however, the band members
insist Aukerman's return was spontaneous and that they're
just as surprised by the reaction as anyone else.
"We're kind of laughing at it," Alvarez said. "There's
kind of a nostalgia trip going on with Milo being back and
everything, and there's certainly a lot more hype nowadays
for the kind of music we play, but that has no relevance to
what's going on with the band."
Alvarez rejects the idea that Aukerman's return was mo
tivated by punk's increased marketability.
"He got tired of doing science for a while and wanted to
do some music again," Alvarez said. "It's just fortunate —
or unfortunate, depending on how you look at it — that he
chose to come back in the current musical climate."
Besides, the Descendents argue, it's not like being a little
bit more successful has changed the band or the way it does

things. Band members are still touring
and sleeping in an old bus and printing
their own T-shirts. As Alvarez sees it,
this is about love, not money — after 10
years of constant shoestring touring,
what other motivation could there be?
"People don't understand that he
sides the top 3 percent of musicians
that are really making a lot of money,"
he said, "the rest of us do this because
we like it, because it's physically plea
surable and intellectually challenging."
And the All experience continues
to meet this criteria for him. After
playing together for so long, Alvarez
says, the Descendents / All family con
nects on a special level.
"There's this disposable nature to
American culture nowadays," Alvarez
said. "Most bands are only together for
four or five years. They have one big
hit song and then they're gone. We're
different — after so long we really
work together well, like some of the re
ally good old rock 'n' roll bands or old
blues or country bands."
Will I sit around and talk about the
old days
Sit around and watch TV?
I never want to go out that way
Never hum out not fade away. ...
What will it he like when 1 get old?
—"When I Get Old," 1996

Even it the band is passionate about what it's doing,
there's still something odd about this comparison to old
bluesmen. It's especially strange because so many Descen
dents songs seem to forcibly reject growing up.
One ofthe All-o-Gistics, the band's "sacred code," pro
claims, "Thou shalt not commit adulthood." Back in the
1980s, Aukerman tauntingly asked, "What you gonna do
when you turn 31?"
Now everyone in the band is older than that. Aukerman
himself, once the king of adolescent girl songs, has been
married for several years. So isn't it a little strange to look
out every night on an audience full of kids that weren't

even in their teens the last time the Descendents were to
gether?
Alvarez says no.
"It's weird if you let it be, but there have always been 11-
year-olds at our shows, even in the old days." He claims
hanging out with a wide range of age groups gives the band
youthful energy to feed off and keeps him from becoming
a "sourpuss old man."
"American society is stratified according to age, and
that's really stupid," Alvarez said. "Artificial boundaries
suck."
The real strength of the Descendents, he said, is a devo
tion to this idea of no boundaries, even as you get older.
"It's about growing older without growing up. . .. Some
people stop questing and stop being" as they get older, he
said, and this is what playing in the Descendents helps him
avoid. "I don't want to end up sounding like my dad. ... I
don't want to end up an ossified judgmental old person."
Despite this philosophy, Alvarez concedes that today's

punk scene is a lot different than the one he remembers.
I le s diplomatic about whether or not he likes the new crop
of pop-punk bands that are, essentially, following in his
footsteps.
"Influence is kind of a tricky thing to talk about. We're
influenced by old bands, like Black Flag, but also by new
bands that are our friends, like Shades Apart."
Overall, however, he said "it seems like there were a lot
more distinct and original ideas before."
Today's punk is useful "for kids to have tribal identity
and for marketing," said Alvarez, "but it's pretty shitty
from a creative viewpoint. The fun of punk in the old days

was that it could be anything — there were no rules about
what was or wasn't punk."
For today's fans, Alvarez says, punk isn't about alien
ation the way it was at the beginning.
"Hack in the day punk kids didn't have the luxury of
choosing who they hung out with," he said. " There were
only a few outcast people who were into that kind of music,
and that was who you hung out with."
Today's punk, he contends, is a teen tribal subculture
like rave or goth or any other, without the threat and the
confrontational energy that once defined it.
But then, Alvarez conceded, that's the way things go.
"As time passes, the things that are confrontational just
end up becoming the norm." Besides, he said, it doesn't
bother him.
"It's outside of my control — my goal is to write songs
that are true to me and play music the way I want to play"
and anything outside that is secondary. That, for him, is
what the Descendents "reunion" comes down to. "The

whole thing is predicated on having .\ bunch of songs that
are lun to do," Ik- said.

Back after ten years (during which one of these guys got a doctorate — guess which one), the Descendents insist their return has nothing to

I )I : .SCI'NI)i.NTS rockin' alone tonight
—"Descendents," 1985
Quick — what's the first thing that springs to mind
when you think "punk rock"? Mohawks? Leather jackets?
Smashing the state? I'm willing to bet it's not dorky thick
glasses, a hot pot of coffee and a doctorate in biochemistry.
Yet these are exactly the attributes that define the De
scendcnts, the recently re-formed Southern California
pop-punk pioneers whose Caffeine Nation Tour — also
featuring Less Than Jake, Guttermouth and Handsome
hits the I.dge on Sunday.
The Descendents may not fit the punk stereotype, but
it's a safe bet that without them, none of today's popular
punk groups — Green Day, Face to Face, The Offspring,
NOFX or even Rancid — would ever have existed.
In 1981, when the Descendents released "Fat," their first
single as a full band, they already stood out among their
Southern California punk peers, bands like Black Flag, The
Adolescents and The Germs. Sure, the same musical influ
ences were there — the inarticulate rage, the sloppy, com
pelling energy — but something set the Descendents apart.
First of all, there was their appearance: led by vocalist
Milo Aukerman, a bespectacled honors student (who real
ly did go to college, leading to the band's first three-year

hiatus) and husky drummer Bill Stevenson, they were a far
cry from the punk norm.
Then there was their subject matter: Rather than ni
hilism or self-destruction, the Descendents sang about
girls, farting, caffeine and hamburgers. And finally, there
was the sound, a driving but tuneful fusion of surf, punk
and pop, anchored by Aukerman's angry-yet-melodic
sing / scream.
The Descendents were never popular on a large scale —
in 1985 they bragged that they "couldn't sell out a tele
phone booth" — but by the time Aukerman left in 1987 to
pursue his biochemistry doctorate, their coffee-fueled
groove and relentless touring had built up a sizable follow
ing and influenced a generation of younger bands who
would follow in their pop-punk footsteps.
But what's innovative at one time can becliched 10 years
later, and the Descendents reunion has been greeted with a
certain degree of skepticism. After all, punk is profitable
now like never before, and the last few years have already
seen far too many long-dormant bands resolve their differ
ences, dust off their amps and trot back out to compete
with their modern proteges for punk rock dollars.
With the Misfits, Social Distortion and even The Sex
Pistols actively touring, what sets the Descendents apart?
What makes their reunion special?
