# Exams create barrier for gratis
## Stanford has high failure rate in electrical engineering quals 
### Laura Lane Editorial staff 
Rachel Smith came to Stanford
intending to receive her doctorate
in electrical engineering. With the
confidence of her academic
achievements and the assurance
of her research adviser, she was
sure that the required qualifying
exams would not be a barrier.
After three grueling years at
Stanford, Smith, who declined to
have her real name used, will grad
uate next month — without her
doctorate. Unable to pass the
qualifying exams, she will gradu
ate with a master's the door to a
doctoral degree from Stanford
shut for good. For her, and many
others each year, the electrical en
gineering qualifying exams proved
to be an unyielding obstacle.
For more than 200 electrical
engineering graduate students
who matriculate into Stanford
every fall, qualifying exams per
vade the thoughts of most. Unlike
other top programs in the country,
quals at Stanford are highly com
petitive, with little more than half
passing each year.
Electrical engineering gradu
ate students must pass the quali
fying exams, or "quals," in order
to progress past the master's pro
gram, onto the doctoral program.
The exam is oral, with students
facing 10 professors in one-on-one
sessions that last 12 minutes each.
The department allows stu
dents to take the exam two times.
Failure to pass after the second at
tempt bars the student from pro
gressing toward the doctoral de
gree. However, the department's
quals appeals committee allows
the students a final alternative of
passing by petition.
"The purpose of the exam is to
select those students who will do
best in the doctoral program," said
Laurence Manning, an electrical
engineering professor who recent
ly retired as chairman of the quals
committee after more than 40

years. "We're trying to find out if
students have the ability to do re
search as a Ph.D."
The qualifying exams function
as the department's selection
process in admitting students into
the doctoral program. Master's
students are allowed to take the
qualifying exam to compete for
one of 70 to 80 spots open every
year in the doctoral program.
Of 126 students who took the
exam last January, 76 percent
passed. Last year, 84 students, or
58 percent passed the exam out of
the 146 students who took the
exam. In 1994, 45 percent passed
the exam.
"It is an advantage to take the
quals during a year when there are
fewer applicants," Manning said.
"The same thing would apply to
•admission for graduate or under
graduate study, since the number
of accepted stays fairly fixed."
Other top electrical engineer
ing programs have higher quals
first-time pass rates. Over the last
five years, the University of Illi
nois at Urbana-Champaign has
passed 80 percent of all students.
At MIT, more than 86 percent
have passed over the last 10 years.

"We believe that the people we
admit can complete a doctorate de
gree," said Marilyn Pierce, gradu
ate administrator at MlT's Elec
trical Engineering and Computer
Science Department.
At MIT, only about half of the
students admitted to the master's
program choose to take quals and
move onto the doctoral program,
according to Arthur Smith, direc
tor of the MIT electrical engineer
ing doctoral program.
Therefore, students at Stan
ford end up competing more with
their classmates than at other
schools, some students say.
"I think the solution |to the
competition] is to separate mas
ter's admissions from doctorate ad
missions," said Amr Awadallah, a
doctoral candidate assisting in the
current survey of student opinions
on quals. "Quals would then simply
become a tool which affirms the
student's research ability."
Pressure to maintain the level
of income received from tuition
has forced the electrical engineer
ing department to maintain a
high number of students it ac
