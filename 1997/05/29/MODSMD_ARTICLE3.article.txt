# Exams create barrier for gratis
## Stanford has high failure rate in electrical engineering quals 
### Laura Lane Editorial staff 
Rachel Smith came to Stanford
intending to receive her doctorate
in electrical engineering. With the
confidence of her academic
achievements and the assurance
of her research adviser, she was
sure that the required qualifying
exams would not be a barrier.
After three grueling years at
Stanford, Smith, who declined to
have her real name used, will grad
uate next month — without her
doctorate. Unable to pass the
qualifying exams, she will gradu
ate with a master's the door to a
doctoral degree from Stanford
shut for good. For her, and many
others each year, the electrical en
gineering qualifying exams proved
to be an unyielding obstacle.
For more than 200 electrical
engineering graduate students
who matriculate into Stanford
every fall, qualifying exams per
vade the thoughts of most. Unlike
other top programs in the country,
quals at Stanford are highly com
petitive, with little more than half
passing each year.
Electrical engineering gradu
ate students must pass the quali
fying exams, or "quals," in order
to progress past the master's pro
gram, onto the doctoral program.
The exam is oral, with students
facing 10 professors in one-on-one
sessions that last 12 minutes each.
The department allows stu
dents to take the exam two times.
Failure to pass after the second at
tempt bars the student from pro
gressing toward the doctoral de
gree. However, the department's
quals appeals committee allows
the students a final alternative of
passing by petition.
"The purpose of the exam is to
select those students who will do
best in the doctoral program," said
Laurence Manning, an electrical
engineering professor who recent
ly retired as chairman of the quals
committee after more than 40

years. "We're trying to find out if
students have the ability to do re
search as a Ph.D."
The qualifying exams function
as the department's selection
process in admitting students into
the doctoral program. Master's
students are allowed to take the
qualifying exam to compete for
one of 70 to 80 spots open every
year in the doctoral program.
Of 126 students who took the
exam last January, 76 percent
passed. Last year, 84 students, or
58 percent passed the exam out of
the 146 students who took the
exam. In 1994, 45 percent passed
the exam.
"It is an advantage to take the
quals during a year when there are
fewer applicants," Manning said.
"The same thing would apply to
•admission for graduate or under
graduate study, since the number
of accepted stays fairly fixed."
Other top electrical engineer
ing programs have higher quals
first-time pass rates. Over the last
five years, the University of Illi
nois at Urbana-Champaign has
passed 80 percent of all students.
At MIT, more than 86 percent
have passed over the last 10 years.

"We believe that the people we
admit can complete a doctorate de
gree," said Marilyn Pierce, gradu
ate administrator at MlT's Elec
trical Engineering and Computer
Science Department.
At MIT, only about half of the
students admitted to the master's
program choose to take quals and
move onto the doctoral program,
according to Arthur Smith, direc
tor of the MIT electrical engineer
ing doctoral program.
Therefore, students at Stan
ford end up competing more with
their classmates than at other
schools, some students say.
"I think the solution |to the
competition] is to separate mas
ter's admissions from doctorate ad
missions," said Amr Awadallah, a
doctoral candidate assisting in the
current survey of student opinions
on quals. "Quals would then simply
become a tool which affirms the
student's research ability."
Pressure to maintain the level
of income received from tuition
has forced the electrical engineer
ing department to maintain a
high number of students it ac


Vanes3a Bartsch — Daily
cepts into its master s program,
said Antony Fraser-Smith, chair
man of the graduate admissions
committee and associate chair
man of the department of Electri
cal Engineering.
The department also feels that
accepting the high number of stu
dents gives the faculty the oppor
tunity to select doctoral candi
dates differently from the tradi
tional paper application.
"When I warn incoming stu
dents about quals, the general at
titude is, "That's just another
hurdle we'll cross." Fraser-Smith
said. "These students have been
very successful and have the feel
ing that they can't be hit with any
thing worse than previous acade
mic experiences."
Another alternative would be
to change the admissions proce
dure to admit students separately
into the master's and doctoral pro
grams, said Bruce Wooley, an elec
trical engineering professor and
chairman of the department.
This would then preclude half
of the students from taking quals.
With the current system, Wooley
said, students have a chance to
prove themselves either through
passing the quals or through re
search. In addition, the current
system allows the department to
choose from a wider population of
students to select those who would
perform the best research.
"I think quals are a brutal
process," said Tallis Blalack, doc
toral candidate and former mem
ber of the now disbanded student
quals committee. "But I also be
lieve that the professors could do a
much better job at choosing doc
toral students by having them
coming to Stanford to meet them

rather than a paper application."
The department also accepts 15
to 20 students each year who have
already received master's from
other universities. Unlike those
admitted into the master's pro
gram, these "post-master's" stu
dents must declare a research ad
viser at the time of application.
Although admitted for doctoral
study, the post-master's students
must also pass quals and compete
along with the master's students,
for a spot in the doctoral program.
"This is very unfair to students
accepted as post-master's for their
doctorate," said Smith, who was
admitted as a post-master's stu
dent. "Since it is easier to get in as
a master's student, they shouldn't
allow these students to compete
with the post-master's students."
The appeals process gives stu
dents such as Smith, who failed to
pass the exam after the second at
tempt, another avenue. The peti
tioning student must show evi
dence of the ability to do research
by presenting the appeals commit
tee with research projects, pub
lished papers or conference pre
sentations.
This year, five passed the exam
through petition out of the 10 pe
titions submitted. Last year, nine
passed through appeal out of the
16 petitions.
Students who petition unsuc
cessfully, such as Smith, are thus
not allowed to continue on to the
doctoral degree. Letters of en
dorsement and support from fac
ulty members also play a crucial
role in the committee's decision.
Many students also feel quals
are ineffective in examining a stu
dents aptitude for research.
Currently, graduate students,
undergraduates and alumni are
being asked to submit their opin
ions of quals in a survey which can
be found on the World Wide Web
(http://ee.stanford.edu/quals.html).

The deadline for submissions to
the survey is June 1.
"The current quals system
tends to test the ability to spend
hours and hours of time reading
textbooks and old questions," said
a student who responded to the
current survey. "The quals should
be used to pick out those people
who are strongest in research abil
ity instead of memorization."
A similar survey was taken in
1992. The results of the survey
served as the basis for recommen
dations the committee made for
change. Changes implemented in
cluded the publication of exam
questions by professors after
quals were finished.
However, one suggestion not
implemented in 1992 was to have
students take quals over more
than one day. Under the current
system, students are randomly as
signed days on which to take the
exam. After that, the computer as
signs students examining profes
sors based on students' professor
preferences in the form of rank
ings submitted prior to the
process. The current survey will
ask whether students still favor
the move toward multiple days.
Typically, each student re
ceives his top seven or eight pro
fessors with the remaining two or
three professors coming from the
lower portion of the student's
preference list, Manning said. Un
fortunately, students whose pre
ferred professors are not available
on the assigned exam day will not
be assigned. For example, Smith
was assigned her top seven pre
ferred professors, as well as her
10th, 17th and 18th preference.
"The solution is to require ex
aminers to exam every day," said
Manning. "Our weakness is facul
ty control. A faculty member may
have an important reason to be
out of town, but it's not fair if you
have no reason. The exam is ex

tremely important to students.
These few hours may affect the
complete career of a student."
Also fiercely debated over the
years is the subjectivity factor that
may occur during an oral exam.
The University of Illinois at Ur
bana-Champaign and MIT both
have a written component to the
exam. Students say a written exam
would allow them to show their
knowledge base whereas the oral
exam may not be as accurate in
measuring a student's knowledge.
International students who
may not be as expressive in Eng
lish worry that their research abil
ity is not accurately examined in
quals.
However, Manning said a stu
dent's performance in course
work, the grade-point average, can
be used as equivalent to a score on
a written exam. He favors using
the GPA in conjunction with the
orals score.
"I think it would be best if a
composite score based on both the
orals and GPA could be used to
rank the students," Manning said.
Manning also pointed out that
various factors exist that would
make it difficult to use GPAs in
consideration of student rankings.
Faculty members argue that con
sidering GPAs would force stu
dents to be "grade grubbers." Ad
ditionally, in considering GPAs,
the number of units would also
have to be taken into considera
tion, Manning said.
However, not all students are
against the current system of
qualifying exams.
"I had a positive experience,"
said John Owens, a doctoral candi
date who passed the quals after
the first time. "There's a sense of
camaraderie with other students.
It's a rite of passage.. . . You've re
ally shown yourself to be an out
standing student if you come [to
Stanford | and pass [thequals|."
