## The
						Mr. T Experience "Big Black Bugs Bleed Blue Blood" 
### 
The Mr. T Experience is perhaps the only
hand in the world that would cover Blondie's
"Sex Offender," Shonen Knife's "Flying Jelly
Attack," the"Spiderman"TV show theme song
and R.F.M.'s"( lan't (let There From I icre" and
include all of them on the same alhum.
That alhum, of course, is "Big Black Bugs
Bleed Blue Blood," .1 reissue of a 1989 seven
sonu IT that now includes an additional 24

assorted singles, covers and rare tracks.
Let me warn you off the bat: There is no
new stuff on this album. II you're anxiously
awaiting the sequel to last year's masterpiece,
"Love Is I)ead," this is not it.
Nevertheless, this chronological sampler
of MTX's early career from 19H9 to 1993
(when Alex, the drummer, left the band) is
certainly worthwhile; one can trace the

band's lyrical and musical
evolution from "A Song
about a Girl Who Went
Shopping" all the way to
1993's "Hello Kitty
Menendez."
The original FP has a
few gems, notably the
Sesame Street song "Up
and Down" (reminiscent
of MTX's reworking of
Schoolhouse Rock's "Ad
jective Song"); "At Gilman
Street," a hymn to that fa
mous home for dysfunc
tional teen punks; and
"The Fnd of the Ra
mones," a "Nostradamus
like prophecy," according
to Dr. Frank's liner notes.
Surprisingly, the
standouts on this album
(apart from several excel
lent tracks included on

other MTX records, such as "Love American
Style" and "More Than Toast") are the cov
ers. Hearing Dr. Frank trying to sing in
Japanese on "Flying Jelly Attack" is a riot, and
"Sex Offender" has a punch that Debbie
Harry just didn't give to the original.
The cover of the Partridge Family's
"Somebody Wants to Love You" oozes more
cheese than Jimmy Stewart in "It's a Wonder
ful Life" (although Dr. Frank insists that the
song was done "with no ironic intent").
M'l'X's version of the theme song to "Spider
man" brings back vibrant elementary school
memories (although I don't remember the
song sounding quite this cool).
By far the most amusing song on the
album is a cover of R.F.M.'s "Can't Get There
from Here," for which MTX wrote new
words, trying to approximate Michael Stipe's
"incomprehensible" lyrics. The result is hi
lariously catchy, with lines like "Donna Reed
is not my mom / hands down ain't she bad"
and "This is shower sugar beer now." This
song is much better than the original.
"Big Black Bugs Bleed Blue Blood" may
not be M'l'X's best record ever; in fact, it most
definitely isn't.
But it's a nice collection of some catchy
tunes, and it'll tide you over until the new
album is released in August or September. As
Dr. Frank writes in the liner notes, "Don't go
back. We'll be right away."
