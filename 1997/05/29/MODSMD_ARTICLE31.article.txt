# Sister 7
## "This the Trip" 
### 
I! you want raw, powerful energy, Sister 7
has it, and the band is set to lake you on a trip.
featuring the scratchy vocals of Patrice
I'ikc, this hand hints of "old school" rock n'
roll, belting out tunes that would have made
limi I lendrix and Robert Plant proud. At the
same time, there's has a slightly folksy sound to
it, ami on occasion, Pike's poignant lyricism is
reminiscent ol the harmonic tones of the Indi
go (tirls.
Ihe title song," I lus the Trip," is the best ex
amplcof the kind s strong, forcible sound. I he
song sports a bluesy lead in, followed by gritty
guitars and a driving beat, although the cho
ins, whii h happens to be the title of the song,
gets a bit repetitive, and you don't ever really
find out what the song is supposed to be about.
"Know What You Mean" is a bit softer, but
it still retains the energv that the band puts
forth in the rest of the album. I he lyrics are a
bit cheesy "A friend in love is a friend in
need, loi example but they're sung well, so
I guess that makes it OK.
loi the most part, the guitars and perms
sion are fairly impressive, with a tew gre.it solos
lor both, but what really carries the band is
Pike's angry vocals. A bit on the angst ridden
side, her singing brings a new dimension to the
album.

The band also has a knack for combining
other sounds into its own energetic style. In
"Tumblin' Down," the band mixes hard-hit
ting guitar i holds with a moving bass line and
1 astern world music harmonies. "Shelter" is
another good example of this combination,
with its undulating beat and head-bobbing
lyrics. The funky guitar on "Under the Sun"
gives a good complement to the rocking cho
rus line. These are very subtly mixed in,
though, so the band doesn't lose its own iden
tity in combining sounds.
In the last song on the album, "Some
Things are l ; ree," the band goes one step fur

I her, incorporating more guitar sound effects
and funk into the song. This one also sports a
happier tone, as Pike sings earnestly, "Livin' in
the sunshine / that's where I'll be/Stand by
the street sign / Some thingsare free." The song
also sports some killer guitar solos and a dri
ving bass line throughout.
Overall this band is talented and could very
well contend with any of the bands currently
being played on the radio. Sister 7 has the drive
and the power, and come Inly 15 when the
album is released, we'll see if fame will take
them on a trip.
