## "BAM's Slushee" 
### 
The curse and the blessing of all musi
cal compilations is variety. With so many
different bands, there's got to be some
thing for everyone. Of course, it everyone
likes one or two songs, there's also got to
be a lot of stuff for everyone to dislike.
This is very much the problem with
Hay Area Music magazine's new "Slushee"
compilation, consisting of 23 songs by 23
different local bands. While the album's
songs range from country to punk and
back again — and while there are a lew
memorable tracks — on the whole this
CD is eminently forgettable.
The first track perfectly sets the tone for
the rest of the album. The producers of
this CD got all the bands on the compila
tion together in one room and gave them
a Journey record to listen to. The result is a
decidedly mediocre cover of "Lights," fea
turing the horns of Punch the Clown and
the vocals of everyone else.
It's a nice idea, but it doesn't really work.
Not only is it disorienting to have a differ
ent voice singing every line (that's count
ing "whoa" as a line), but Journey's lyrics
and melodies certainly leave something to
be desired. So does the rest of this CD.
Simon Stinger's "My Dad's the Dean" is
kind of catchy, beginning with a 1 S>s()s har
mony and jumping suddenly into punky
pop. The chorus is the best part, but some
how two or three seven-second segments
don't redeem a three-minute song.
There are better moments, like Red
Letter Day's "She's Varispeed," a Simply
Red-esque love tune featuring high vocals
and a kazoo solo. Action Slacks' "The
Look" is an intriguing (albeit formulaic
and straight out of the Nirvana "How to
Play Soft and Then Loud" lesson book)
punk rocker with a lyrically unimpressive
but somehow memorable chorus.
The Kuntry Kunts' "Transition" is an
excellent country song with great vocal
harmonies and amusing lyrics: "I used to
be a little fluff/in the suburbs I did
live / Now I'm a dyke and my hair is spiked
/ and they think I've gone insane."
Unfortunately, these four songs are
joined by a dozen unexciting and generic
ones. Soda.'s "Old Things I launt" is a dull
and repetitive punk song, 1 lissyfit's "Look
Around" is both musically and lyrically
infantile and Smashmouth's "Beer (iog
gles" is a lame romp through fraternity life
with the lyrics "1 want someone, any
one / tall one, short one, skinny ones."
Clearly "BAM's Slushee" is no excep
tion to the compilation rule. I just can't
imagine anyone liking more than a few of
these songs, so don't blow your dough. On
the other hand, if you want a collection of
mediocre crappy songs, go right ahead.
