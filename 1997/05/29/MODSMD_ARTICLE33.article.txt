## Poster Children "RTFM" 
### 
The sixth album from this Champaign,
111., hand is eclectic and absorbing.
"RTFM" (Read the Fucking Manual)
ranges from catchy pop to trancy grooves
hut returns often to the mechanisms of
singsong vocals and thrashing choruses.
This latest Poster Children effort sounds
very much like an art-rockers Swell album
with Midwest progressive musical tastes.
On the pop side, there is the beautiful "0
for 1," which is clean and fast and works
around a single excellent riff until the noisy,
distortion-fest chorus. This same distortion
is the focal point of the tough, speedy pop
ballad, "King of the Hill."
Tracks like the trip-trance "Dream
Small" and bassy groove "King of the Hill"
attest that this album has been somewhat in
fluenced by the techno-ambient side project
the hand has been working on.
The pseudo-rapped vocals on "21 st Cen
tury" work excellently over a fast dance beat
that the Poster Children finally let develop
into a groove. The aptly named "Sleep" is a
ethereal feedback dream, while the sparse,
three-note groove "Afterglow" closes out the
album with a smile.

Not everything on this album is poaches
and cream, though. The slow thrashing he
comes repetitive and uninteresting on
"Black Dog" (not a Zeppelin cover) and
"Music of America." The fast pop fails on
"Attack" and "Happens Every Day."

There's also a CD-ROM clement to tins
disc that runs on computers with Windows
45. Because I don't have a computer, I
couldn't check it out.
But the Poster C Children World Wide Weh
site I found in my computer cluster (which

doesn't have Windows l ) 3)
says, "Inside the t'l) you
will find a video ol us
recording, technical read
outs ol our van, into about
old records, instructions
on how to start a record
Libel and how to make a
Web page, tour reports
Iroin both Rose and
Howie, interviews with
each band member and
i lips Irom some ol our old
videos." Wow, useful.
And clearly as proud
about it as it is about lis
music, the band boasts,
"()nce again, we did all the
artwork, and we did all the
programming ol the ( I >
R( )M part ourselves."

II thoii programming is. as their
music, then mayhe the musicians tin have
something to he proud 01. I.ct's hope any
Imp m their program are .is minim.il as the
weaker tracks on "K II M."

I wonder how many people wanted to make a phone call during this shoot.
