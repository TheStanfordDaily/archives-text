# The 						Muffs
## "Happy Birthday to Me" 
### 
Muffs vocalist Kim Shattuck may not have
rock 'n' roll's most beautiful voice, but at least
it's distinctive: Her abrasive, petulant croon

would be hard to mistake for anyone else. But
don't let her calculated effort to be bratty and
cute fool you.

Up to the point in tier higher register where
it disintegrates intoa ear-splitting shriek, Sh.it
tuck actually has a pretty nice voice, a husky,
honeyed warble that charms even as it makes
you wonder ii she could use a lew cough drops.
Previous Mulls albums have leaned heavily
on the shrieking part of Shattuck's vocal lal
ents, and one of the nicest features on "I lappy
Birthday to Me" is the extent to which it allows
her to actually sing.
Although I liked The Mulls' first two al
bums, "I lappy birthday to Me" has a richness
that transcends their previous efforts. The
Muffs have always been on the poppier side ol
pop-punk, and this release takes that evolution
even further down that road. ()n many ol these
tracks, like "Upside Down," only Shattuck's
rough vocals and drunken tomboy phrasing
keep the music from crossing over into pure
bubblegum.
Classic power pop references abound:
"Outer Space seems to recall the chorus ol
Cheap Trick's "Surrender," and much of the
rest ol the album dips even further back into
the guitar-pop playhook, suggesting the
"Help"-cra Beatles and othei early (>()s rock
and rollers. In fact, imagine your brattv but
cute 8-year-old sister singing I Want to I lold
Your I land," and you'll have some sense ol I he
Mulls sound.
"I lappy Birthday to Me" is lyrically indebt
ed to classic pop rock as well, albeit with a sub
versive 'Wis sensibility. Sweetly innocent songs
like "Is It All ()kay'" and "Where ()nly I < ould

(io" arc contrasted Willi slightly more checky
songs like "IVnnywhorc' .mil "I'm .1 I >ick
with its chorus of "I in ,1 diek I'm .1 dick .11 id I
could carc less"
While Ihe Mulls write.l d.irn line pop song,
some ol I lappv Birthday t<> Me drags .1 hit,
and the allium 1 tins out ol steam helore re.ic li
ing the end ol its 13 track length. Ihisisrealh
the only thing that keeps the allium Iroin tak
ing oil, though, and I lappy Birthday to Me'
remains a Basically satisfying piece ol rough
hewn ear candy.
