## Addicted to Love 
### 
II you losl your spec ial someone, just how
far would you go to gel back together? Or for
that matter, how far would you go just to get
even''!
That's the question .it the root of "Addict
ed to love," the new romantic comedy star
ring Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan.
Broderick plays Sam, an astronomer (of
all things) from a small Midwestern town,
lie is very much in love with his long term
sweetheart, a schoolteacher named Linda
(Kelly Preston).
I itida lakes a job in New York City, and
alter a lew months Sam gets a letter saying
she's leaving him. lie goes to New York at
once, eager to repair the relationship, only to
find that she has a new lover, a French restau
rant owner named Anton ( I cheky Karyo).
Sam moves into the rundown Building
next door and Builds complicated equip
ment to spy on the couple. Ile soon runs into
Maggie (Ryan), Anton's Bitter ex fiancee.
Whereas Sam wants to wait for the relation
ship to end so he can get I inda Back, Maggie
wants revenge.
Together they come up with a scheme to
ruin Anton by making Linda believe lie's
havingan affair. Some things work out beau
til ully, and others turn out surprisingly bad.
And, as vou miuht expect, Maimie and Sam

end up tailing for each
other.
The comedy here is
top-notch, especially
when Anton begins to
suffer. In one scene, for
example, Maggie pays
.i trainer to have his
monkey kiss Anton
with lipstick. The poor
man has a horrible
time explaining to
I.inda that he got the
red stains on his shirt
collar trom an animal.
Meanwhile, the plot
keeps you on your toes.
You have no idea what
evil plan Maggie will
hatch next or what stu
pid things Sam is
bound to do. I here are
enoimh wild twists and

turns to make you really wonder whether the
relationships will work out properly in the
end.
There's also some great imagery that
lends to the movie's romance. I)irector (Irif
fin Dunne, himself an actor, does a com
mendable job of creating fast paced, candid

scencs with the splendor of New York City as
the backdrop.
The neatest images in the movie are those
provided hv Sam's camera obscura, a device
that projects a telescope's view onto a wall. It
lets Maggie and Sam watch their former
lovers as though they were on a projection

television, and thus they live out interactions
with "ghosts."
Fans of either Broderick or Ryan should
be pleased with this film. It manages to show
a lot of heart without being too mushy, and
that's the way romantic comedies should be.

Spying with a camera isn't the only trick biker-chick Meg Ryan has up her sleeve.
