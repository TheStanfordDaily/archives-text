# Brassed Off
## 
### 
I w.in Mc( iregor's Litest film,
"brassed Oil,' scorns ,i far cry
from " Irainspotting lie finds
himscll dressed .ill in purple (I
can't imagine anything more lan
tastic) anil wielding .1 horn in a
hrass hand. However, as the 111111
progresses through political, la
111 ili.il, romantic and social c 1 ises,
Us dark side is revealed. I hough
the comic moments oiler the er
latic chuckle or two, "Brassed
I'll" is a somber and often gut
wreiu liing film.
I be somewhat cheesy title is a
reference both to the band at the
heart ol the movie and its second
meaning 111 British slang: "very
angry." I lie characters of this film
are indeed very angry, very sad
and sometimes very hopeless.
I lie raw emotion ol the cliarac
ters is touching and convincing,
although the filmmakers are 1111

able to succeed id their attempts to balance
il with hellvlaughs. its political
commentary, family drama and marching
haiul fiesta, "Brassed Oil" simply tries to
do too nuich.
Writer and directoi Mark Merman turns
his a 111i Margaret I'hatcher lens on the
mining pits, or collieries that are being

closed in rapid succession in the north of
I ngland. One pit in danger of being closed
is in the small town inhabited by miners
Andy (Mcllrcgor) and Danny (Pete
I'ostlethwaite, the actor best remembered
as the father from"In the Name of the Fa
ther" and Mr. Kobavashi from"The Usual
Suspccts" i. With the pit will go the miners'
livelihoods and their beloved band. I he ini

tial sadness of the
flagging band is
lifted by the return
of Gloria (Tara
Fitzgerald of
"Sirens"), a lovely
flugelhorn-play
ing lass who livens
up the all-male
band.
This up-swing
doesn't last for
long, however, as
catastrophe after
catastrophe befalls
band leader
Danny and his
bumbling son,
Phil, whose tragic
existence is the
most disturbing
and affecting as
pect of the film.
Played by Stephen
Tompkinson, Phil

pretty much endures everything terrible
that can happen to one person, including a
dent in his trombone, and his performance
left more than just me in tears.
The film's multiple personalities —
comedy, tragedy, musical — are disconcert
ing, and its upbeat ending is especially dif
ficult to reconcile with its tearv middle act.
However, the strength of "Brassed Off" lies

ultimately in the depth of the characters
and the level to which the actors make them
accessible. The only iffy factor is the
amount of boisterous brass band music one
person can take — and remember, these are
76 moody trombones.
