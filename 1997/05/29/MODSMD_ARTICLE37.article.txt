## The 						Lost World: Jurassic Park 
### 
If you look outside your window right now, you might be
lucky enough to see a tyrannosaurus rex. More likely is that
you'll see a line of people trying to see some of the dinosaurs.
"The Lost World: Jurassic Park" does not disappoint its eager
fans, who have been waiting four years to watch the spectacular
sequel to Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park."
I lore we have an addition to the dino horror lest, and the
movie really tries to expand into new territory. I'he dinosaurs
have become more vicious — more than one person is shown
eaten alive — as well as more lifelike. "The Lost World" is far
more graphic than its predecessor, but some of its edge has been
negated by the familiarity of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen.
"The Lost World" reintroduces us to lan Malcolm (Jeff
(ioldblum, funny as ever), a skeptical scientist who managed to
escape Jurassic Park alive. Malcolm is convinced by the aging
former president of Ingen Corp., John I iammond (Richard At
tenborough), to research the dinosaurs freely roaming on Isla
Soma, the island next to the ill-fated Jurassic Park.
While on the island, lan has to find his girlfriend, Dr. Sarah
I larding (Julianne Moore) and take care of his daughter, Kelly
(Vanessa Lee Chester). Joining Malcolm on this risky expedi
tion — or is it a rescue mission, as he fears? — are Eddie Carr
(Richard Schiff) and Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn,
"Swingers").

Impeding the researchers
are the new leaders of Ingen
Corp. The chief bad guys are
Hammond's nephew, Peter
Ludlow (Arliss Howard), Di
eter Stark (Pete Stormarc,
"Fargo") and big-game hunter
Roland Tembo (Pete Postleth
waite). Together, they hope to
bring Jurassic Park to the U.S.
mainland.
Eventually, the interaction
of humans and dinosaurs goes
awry, and people start to be
killed at a rapid pace. The best
moment in the movie comes
when the velociraptors give the
audience a well-orchestrated

startle; most of the people in front of me noticeably jumped out
of their seats.
There have been several rumors that a "Jurassic Park 3," a
prequel to either "Jurassic I'ark" or " The I ost World," could hit
theaters in a few years. This would most likely arrive without the
direction of Steven Spielberg, who has created a perfect mix be

tween the creepy atmosphere and humorous quips.
1 fear that this series would be much less involving without
Spielberg around; I would rather see the proposed trilogy end
with this film than watch ,1 less than perlect conclusion to the
wonderful world ol dinosaurs.
