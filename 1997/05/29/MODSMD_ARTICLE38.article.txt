# Once Upon a Time in China and America
## 
### 
"()nce upon a Time in China and America" is an awkward fairy
tale. 111 an attempt to unite East and West, it weds the Chinese kung
! u movie to the American western, creating an unlikely union held
together by a caffeinated plot line and fight sequences.
Jet Li, whose martial arts are as intense as Jackie Chan's hut
pumped up with special effects, stars as Wong Lei-Hung,
lounder and master of Po Chi Lam, a kung fu school and med
ical clinic. Rosamund Kwan plays Aunt Yee, Wong's fiancee.
Sometime during the Ching Dynasty, Wong and Yee travel
via stagecoach to San Francisco to see how the American Po I !hi
1.1111 branch is doing. On the way, they pick up a stranded cow
boy with bleached hair and an unsettling tendency to slip into a
surfer drawl. Together, they fend off an Indian ambush, during
which Wong gets swept away by a river, develops amnesia and
wakes up to find himself the only Chinese member of the Lagle
Indian tribe.
The rest of the story becomes a search for Wong, heavily
peppered with skirmishes among cowboys, belligerent Indians
and Chinese. These fights are something of a social phcnome

non, what with the eclectic mix of weaponry tomahawks vs.
scissor kicks vs. pistols. No matter what the good guy uses (usu
ally scissor-kicks), he wins.
More unrealistic than the fight scenes, however, is the ilia
logue. The only reasonable lines are in (iantonese, and the rest

.ire in 1 nglisli and Native American tongues. In .1 discomfiting
shilt, the Indians start oil speaking then native language, then
break out 111 perfei I I nglisli lor the rest of the movie. ()l course,
Wong can't understand them because the only I nglisli he
knows is: "who, "what, "when,' "where and "yeah."
There is .111 amusing conversation between Wong and .111
f.agle Indian, in which thc\ speak theii respective languages,
causing Wong to comment, "You don't understand a bit ol what
I 'm saying."
The cowboys use phrases straight out ol John Wayne movies,
with appropriate stares and sneers. ()ne ol the bail guys, ,1 lanky
chap with .1 greasy mustache and deadly spinning spurs, uses
particularly entertaining verbiage while lighting Wong. < lioke
strings are: "I Jam 11!", "What the hell .ire you?", "< let oil me!" ami
"You ain't net human."
As you tan see, this is not a quality film, but it is ridii ulously
funny. Il could even rise to bad movie cull lame Whether you
apprciiate that or not, you're bound to laugh.
