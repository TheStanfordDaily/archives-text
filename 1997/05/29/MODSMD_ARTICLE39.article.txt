## Video Column HAVE YOURSELF A GOOD CRY 
### 
(Chances are, if you've seen a (Chinese film, you've
seen one directed by /hang Yimou and starring
(long Li.
And if the Chinese film you saw was not one of
Yimou s, it probably was Chen Kaige's 1993
"Farewell My (loncubine

As (China's most prolific and award winning film
maker, Yimou's resume offers a healthy list of excel
lent films, any of which would be good choices for
rentals of course, Cannes Film Festival winner
"Farewell My (ioncubine" (along with Jane (lampi
on's " I he Piano") is .ilso a rewarding option.
To start with Yimou s repertoire, "Ju 1 )ou" (1990)
is an intense, erotii story set in the 1920s about a
cruel, old dye factory owner, Jinshan (I i Wei) and
his youni> wile, Ju I )ou ((ioim I i).

Scxn.illy mistreated by her husband, she turns to
I iaiu|ing (Li Baotian), her husbands adopted son. Eventu
ally, they begin .111 illicit affair, strongly dyed with tension
and wrought emotion.
Although it may seem like a strange story, the film hyp
not i/ingly draws you iu with its em pat het it.and dramatic
portrayal ol their plight.
Yimou's "Raise the Red I antern" ( I 1 ) 1 )I), also set in the
19205, is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen.
But it is also one ol the best.
Again, (long stars as Songlian, the fourth wife ol a rich
landowner. Being the fourth wife, she has about a fourth as
much power as the first wile.
She and the other three wives know that she is too edu
cated to be the fourth wife (or .1 third wife or .1 second wife).

So they scheme each night to keep the red lantern (the sym
bol for the master's bedtime location) from being raised
outside her room.
The trickery and spitefulness among the wives provides
a bleak picture of how powerless Chinese wives and concu
bines were as recently as the earlier part of this century.
"To Live" (1994), the

deserving winner of the

grand jury prize at Cannes, ranks right up there with
"Raise the Red Lantern." Beginning in the 19405, the story
marches smartly through all the major events of Commu
nist (Chinese history and makes you laugh, cry and think
along the way.
Cong again stars, this time as Jiazhen, whose gam

bling husband, Fugui (Ge You), loses all his money and
is reduced to running a shadow-puppet troupe. Despite
their meager circumstances, they manage to raise their
children amid Fugui's short-lived stint fighting in the
war between the Nationalists and the Communists, the
smeltings of the 1950s steel-sustained Great Leap For
ward and the political chicanery of the 1960s Cultural
Revolution.

And despite the personal tragedies that
unceasingly beset them, they manage to
maintain their sense of humor and gener
al contentment. At the end, 1 felt like I'd
lived 10 lifetimes in two hours.
Chinas political history is also promi
nent in the final Chinese flick, "Farewell,
My Concubine," even though the main
characters play stars of the ancient Peking
Opera.
Dieyi (Leslie Cheung), a feminine boy
finds protection in Xiaolou (Zhang
Fengyi), a bigger boy in the troupe. To
gether they gain fame in playing as a cou
ple — Dieyi in the woman's part and Xi
aolou in the man's.
A chronicle of their lives, the film be
gins with their brutal training in a boys'
performance troupe and reaches its in
tensity in their days as Peking stars. The
main conflict stems from Dieyi's love for
Xialou, which becomes devastation when

Xiaolou marries a prostitute, played again by Cong.
Another depressing movie — depressing hut good. If
you're looking for poignant, look for Cong's serene face,
which has graced the screens of many an excellent Chi
nese film.
