## Live-in volunteers at the Bridge display caring and commitment 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Four students have found a safe haven in the flurry
of Stanford life, a place where they listen and care for
one another and the community at large, a place they
call "home" and students call the Bridge.
Seniors Jack Chu, Mary Rahn, Joy Chen and Hayes
Morehouse are live-in counselors at The Bridge. They
run the 24-hour peer counseling center from inside the
house.
The dedicated four are "on call" all the time, never
knowing when they'll get a life-or-death phone call or a
drop in. Students come by The Bridge any time for
counseling. The counselors also get emergency phone
calls in the middle of the night. Trained to be ready for
anything, they sleep with the phone close to their beds.
When crisis situations arise, Rahn, a psychology
major, said the most fulfilling thing is just being there
for someone who is lonely.
"Regardless of how good my counseling skills are,

just being here for another is the greatest feeling," she
said.
Not all cases are successful, however. Morehouse
said the most frustrating calls are when people call and
talk for about two minutes and then hang up.
"There are people that come right and out say they
want us to tell them what to do," Chen said. "But we
don't."
The peer counselors adhere to "The Hridge Model,"
in which they are trained to listen, not to give advice.
They turn the questions back to the person, acting as a
sounding board.
According to Rahn, most people find the model
works well.
"They are surprised to find out that they knew what
they wanted to do all along and just needed someone to
walk them through the steps," she said.
Morehouse said the process of thinking aloud is ther
apeutic for the people who call.
" It feels great to take an hour to
just talk about yourself, knowing
that the person on the other end is
just there to listen to you and not
cast judgment on you," he added.
The Bridge receives about 200
phone calls each quarter — some of
which are informational and refer
ral inquiries; others, more personal
in nature, arc held in strict confi
dentiality, said Chu, a double major
in public policy and psychology.
The four live-in counselors de
brief each other and the 40 to 50 vol
unteer staff, who have weekly
shifts, using generalities. They are
careful not to reveal the person's
specific situation or identity.
"In debriefing, we usually talk
one-on-one about what counseling
skills were successful and how the
counselor felt about the counsel,"
Chu said.
Every Tuesday and Sunday
night, the live-in counselors have
"house meetings" over dinner. It's a
chance for them not only to take
care of business but also to spend

quality time together.
Chu compared their relationship
to a resident assistant team that
goes through good times and tough
times together.
The counselors pointed to a crisis
time in the middle of the year when
inspectors condemned the second
floor of The Bridge as sesmicaUy un
safe. Two counselors who had bed
rooms upstairs were forced to move
downstairs and give up their sin
gles.
"It turned the organization up
side-down," Chen said.
She added that the counselors
needed their own personal space be
cause of the intense nature of their
work.
Despite the cramped li ving quar
ters and the sornetimes-stressfu 1 at
mosphere of counseling and run
ning a student organization, the
four get along remarkably well, they
said.
Rahn and Chen were fellow
freshmen in Rinconada, but the
others only knew each other
through staffing and counseling
classes before living together at The
Bridge. Now, the four enjoy going to
movies or concerts together. Some
nonresident staff members also like

to stop by and hang out with them
on their off-duty hours.
"The greatest part of living at
The Bridge is getting to know the
generous and giving people," Rahn
said. "We share a sense of commu
nity and a sense of responsibility in
something amazing."
The Bridge Ls not just another or
ganization to the four peer coun
selors; it's their passion.
Morehouse said he is fascinated
with the idea of students organizing
themselves to help other students.
"To be here 24 hours a day, to de
vote my energies into that endeavor
is empowering," he said.
Chu agreed and added that the
well-being of The Bridge is impor
tant to him.
"It's like our baby," he said. "I
want to nurture it and see it grow."
For that reason, Chu and Rahn
will continue to live at The Bridge
next year to continue some pro
grams that began this year.
Currently, the four live-in coun
selors, with help from The Bridge
staff, run the Spring Faire, conduct
stress-reduction workshops in dor
mitories, train RAs in listening and
counseling skills and lead sections
for the peer-counseling class.
