## Live-in volunteers at the Bridge display caring and commitment 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Four students have found a safe haven in the flurry
of Stanford life, a place where they listen and care for
one another and the community at large, a place they
call "home" and students call the Bridge.
Seniors Jack Chu, Mary Rahn, Joy Chen and Hayes
Morehouse are live-in counselors at The Bridge. They
run the 24-hour peer counseling center from inside the
house.
The dedicated four are "on call" all the time, never
knowing when they'll get a life-or-death phone call or a
drop in. Students come by The Bridge any time for
counseling. The counselors also get emergency phone
calls in the middle of the night. Trained to be ready for
anything, they sleep with the phone close to their beds.
When crisis situations arise, Rahn, a psychology
major, said the most fulfilling thing is just being there
for someone who is lonely.
"Regardless of how good my counseling skills are,

just being here for another is the greatest feeling," she
said.
Not all cases are successful, however. Morehouse
said the most frustrating calls are when people call and
talk for about two minutes and then hang up.
"There are people that come right and out say they
want us to tell them what to do," Chen said. "But we
don't."
The peer counselors adhere to "The Hridge Model,"
in which they are trained to listen, not to give advice.
They turn the questions back to the person, acting as a
sounding board.
According to Rahn, most people find the model
works well.
"They are surprised to find out that they knew what
they wanted to do all along and just needed someone to
walk them through the steps," she said.
Morehouse said the process of thinking aloud is ther
apeutic for the people who call.
