## Down with action and adaptations 
### Alex Tung 
OK, let's talk movies. Like any other car
less Stanford student, I have a hard time get
ting out to watch them, but through com
mercial breaks during "The Simpsons," I
have managed to keep myself up to date on
what's coming out of Hollywood lately.
After seeing what's out there, my question
is this: Where's the creativity?
It seems that every new film is either an in
credibly expensive, poorly acted and plotless
action movie designed to make the produc
er's pockets bulge or a portrayal, in varying
degrees of quality, of some producer's inter
pretation of someone else's book.
Both kinds of movies have their own ap
peal — sometimes we want brainless enter
tainment which shows lots of cool stuff get

ting blown up, and sometimes book inter
pretations can be done well enough that
they even enhance the original or at least get
the average moviegoer to know who lane
Austen is.
And yet, there seems to be something
lacking in all this. There's a limit to the
number of times we can see a big explosion
and say, "That was worth the movie not
having a solid plot." There's a limit to the
number of books which can be reproduced
on the screen without losing most of the
original gusto and raising the ire of the au
thor and his or her readers.
So what's the alternative?
"Star Wars" has often been blamed for
causing the rise of money-seeking action

films, but I see it as an example to moviemak
ers everywhere that action movies can have a
good plot. Perhaps my perception is clouded
by my years oflove for the "Star Wars" series,
but whether George Lucas was looking for a
blockbuster hit in this or not (and there is ev
idence that he didn't expect it), it's clear that
he took the time and effort to really make the
script good.
Despite some very poor acting, "Star
Wars" was original — it had action and a
solid plot. Few movies can say that.
I am not advocating that all films should be
action movies with a good plot. I am merely
saying that movies need a solid, coherent and
original plot, arid if there happen to be a few
good special effects in there, that's fine.

The Tom Clancys and John Grishams of
the world have had their run in the movies,
and no doubt all will continue their on
screen endeavors, as will the Schwarzeneg
gers and Stallones. But I think Hollywood
and its audience need a break.
We need more independent filmmakers,
more of those Cannes and Sundance win
ners. We need more people who are willing to
make movies for the sake of making movies.
We need more people who will treat the film
as a genre in itself, not as some sort of Andy
Warhol interpretation of current bestsellers.
We need more of these people to boost the
industry, so whining schmucks like me can
go see a movie that's worth the money I have
to pay.
