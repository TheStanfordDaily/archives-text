# Expansion of parking planned in Manzanita, Governor's Corner
## Transportation hopes 1,210 new spaces will eliminate concerns 
### Vanessa Bartsch 
The construction of new residences at Gover
nor's Corner and Manzanita Park that caused con
cern over already scarce parking space has led to
University initiatives to add more than 1,000 new
spots.
Construction of the Lyman Graduate Housing
Center has condensed available local parking to the
lot near Suites and between Lagunita Court and
EAST House.
The Schwab Residential Center is taking up
what used to be a parking lot behind Manzanita
Park. In addition to the lost space, the two new res
idences will add a total of more than 500 new resi
dents.
Next year the Stanford campus will see 1,210
new spaces, according to Jeffrey Tumlin, program
manager at Transportation Programs.
He called West Residences parking "the most

challenging area to accommodate. All the land
from Lake Lagunita to Searsville Road is smack
dab in the middle of the habitat zone of the Cali
fornia tiger salamander."
Not only is the road a direct migratory path for
the salamanders, but it is not well lighted. Night
lighting disturbs the salamanders' mating habits,
Tumlin said
After careful planning, four salamander-friend
ly projects have received the go-ahead: Santa Tere
sa Street, Electioneer Road, Los Arboles Avenue
and Searsville Road will all be widened in order to
create 260 new street parking spaces.
()n East Campus, Tumlin said there are plans to
"create tremendous benefits without consuming
any additional land.
"Both the Wilbur lot and Bowdoin Street were
designed in the '50s when we had unlimited re-

sources and land," he added.
The plan is to add 1(53 new
spaces by narrowing Bowdoin
Street to two lanes with street
parking and by rearranging spaces
in the Wilbur lot.
Other changes include the loss
of 500 spaces for the construction
of the Center for Clinical Science
Research that is to be built be
tween the Medical School and
Campus. To compensate, addition

al parking along Welch Road will be
added along with a large expansion
of the Stock farm lots by adding a
new road, Oak Road, that will lead
to the old and new areas of the
Stockfarm lots. Also, the Track
House lot will be extended toward
the stadium, creating an additional
131 spaces.
Students reaction is mixed.
Kirtine Lee, the resident assistant
at EAST House has been dealing
with West Campus parking for
two years and said, "It's been
awful. It is absolutely ridiculous
that everyone out here pays for
parking but we aren't guaranteed

spaces so we end up getting tickets
for not being able to all fit into the
spots we have here that are sized
for toy cars."
Kate Didech, a freshman living
in Branner, said she has noticed a
huge increase in the demand for
parking. "It seems like after
spring break everyone and their
mother brought a car back, and
now even the illegal spots around
Branner and Kimball are taken."
She said she doesn't want to park
in the back of Wilbur or on Bow
doin Street. "I would rather park
illegally and take my chances with
a ticket for a night," she said.
