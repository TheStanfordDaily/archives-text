McVeigh's defense rests
DENVER (AP) — Timothy McVeigh's attorneys rested their case yester
day after 25 witnesses in just 3 1/2 days, wrapping up with video footage and
wiretaps portraying the government's star witness as a scruffy opportunist
who sold out an innocent man.
Jurors were told to return today for closing arguments, followed by jury
instructions and deliberations. Sources close to the case said U.S. District
Judge Richard Matsch is considering sequestering the panel throughout
deliberations, which would go through the weekend if necessary.
The modest defense — following a lean prosecution case that saw 137 wit
nesses in 18 days — came after Matsch refused to allow theories of a larger
conspiracy involving foreign and domestic terrorists.
McVeigh's lawyers were left trying to show that the real bomber may have
died in the blast, physical evidence was tainted in the FBI lab and key prose
cution witness Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, were drug-using liars.
McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, could get the death penalty if
convicted.
