# FTC pulls plug on Joe Camel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Trade Commission moved to ban suave Joe
Camel yesterday, charging R.J. Reynolds
with using the popular cartoon advertising
campaign to target children.
RJR, the nation's No. 2 tobacco firm,
vowed to vigorously fight the charge of
unfair advertising as "unprecedented,
unfounded and unwarranted."
The cigarette industry already has
offered to kill Joe Camel as part of a settle
ment to a legal assault on the tobacco
industry by state attorneys general, anti
smoking activists and plaintiffs in private
product liability suits.
Members of Congress, which must
approve any settlement, and tobacco foes
said the FTC's action now removes the
industry's offer as one of its bargaining chips.

But Mississippi Attorney General
Michael Moore said even broader advertis
ing curbs are still an ingredient of the peace
deal he is negotiating on behalf of 31 states
that have sued the industry.
"We need to stop the Joe Camels that we
can't even imagine before they hurt our
kids, not after," Moore said. "It's a crime
that FTC has taken so long to act."
Meanwhile, Joe Camel fans and foes
shouldn't expect the "cool" cartoon charac
ter in his trademark dark sunglasses to dis
appear immediately from billboards and
other ads. The FTC must first prove its
charge before an administrative law judge,
which could take slightly more than a year.
The first hearing is June 24.
The commission typically wins such
cases, said former FTC chief Michael

Pertschuk, now an anti-tobacco activist.
But New York marketing law expert
Linda Goldstein said the case will be a
tough one for the FTC to prove. The com
mission, she said, will have to show Joe
Camel causes children to start smoking. II
it can't, "they can't win."
RJR predicted it will win. "Joe Camel
has become the government's scapegoat
for issues our society has been unable to
resolve," said spokeswoman Peggy
Carter.
The FTC is seeking to ban Joe Camel
from most advertising, except in ads placed
in bars and nightclubs that restrict minors,
and order RJR to conduct anti-teen-smok
ing education for 10 years. The company
also would be forced to supply teen-smok
ing data for each of its brands.
