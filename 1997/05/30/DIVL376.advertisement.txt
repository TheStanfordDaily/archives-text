The Force of Ideas
Great ideas change enterprises as surely as they change empires. Powerful ideas—like democracy, liberty and free
enterprise—transform whole continents. Even so, the great commercial concerns of our time are carried more surely by the
force of good ideas than by natural resources, market power and market cunning. Ours is the task to find them.
