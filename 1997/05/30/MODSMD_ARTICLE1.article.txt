## Gay couples exchange covenant vows in Mem Chu 
### Vanessa Hua Editorial staff 
When Terry and Jason Allen-Rouman at
tended the baptismal of their godson last year,
they were honored to be chosen to care for the
child under any circumstance.
"It was courageous for my cousin to ask a
gay couple to be godparents," Terry said.
Being accepted as godparents was yet an
other affirmation of their union by their fami
lies. The Allen-Roumans were the first gay cou
ple joined in a "covenant ceremony" — the reli
gious blessing of same-sex relationships — at
Stanford Memorial Church on Sept. 6, 1993.
Four years later, one more male couple and a
female couple have been joined at Memorial
Church. Elizabeth and Nana Howton were the
first female couple united.
Although the couples found spiritual fulfill
ment in their covenant ceremonies, their
struggles for social acceptance continue. Public
debate swirls around the federal Defense of
Marriages Act passed by Congress last sum
mer. The law decrees that states can refuse to
recognize same-sex marriages granted in other
states and defines marriage as an act between
members of the opposite the sex. No states cur
rently have legalized same-sex marriage. How
ever, several cases challenging current laws
against same-sex marriage are moving
through the state courts.
Lesbians and gays may declare a relation
ship in two ways: a covenant ceremony or a do
mestic partnership registration. Neither op
tion offers legal protection. Although the reli

gious rites of covenant ceremonies are similar
to wedding vows, there are no legal documents
for the minister to sign. In weddings, ministers
sign marriage licenses.
In some cities, couples can register as do
mestic partners; Palo Alto has offered this pro
gram since last year. Some organizations, such
as Stanford, choose to recognize domestic part
ners and may offer benefits such as health in
surance.
Beyond the political and religious rhetoric
are the couples themselves — their experiences
are the true heart of the legal debate. The sto
ries of the Allen-Roumans and the Howtons

show the challenges and joys of each relation
ship.
The San Francisco Muni rattles down the
slope outside the Allen-Roumans' apartment,
inteijecting conversation with an occasional
clang. Artifacts from their world travels fill
their spacious apartment. In their living room,
family pictures crowd the table and mantel
piece, from great-grandfathers to a godchild.
This space represents the many memories that
the couple has collected.
