# 'I do'
## Gay couples exchange covenant vows in Mem Chu 
### Vanessa Hua Editorial staff 
When Terry and Jason Allen-Rouman at
tended the baptismal of their godson last year,
they were honored to be chosen to care for the
child under any circumstance.
"It was courageous for my cousin to ask a
gay couple to be godparents," Terry said.
Being accepted as godparents was yet an
other affirmation of their union by their fami
lies. The Allen-Roumans were the first gay cou
ple joined in a "covenant ceremony" — the reli
gious blessing of same-sex relationships — at
Stanford Memorial Church on Sept. 6, 1993.
Four years later, one more male couple and a
female couple have been joined at Memorial
Church. Elizabeth and Nana Howton were the
first female couple united.
Although the couples found spiritual fulfill
ment in their covenant ceremonies, their
struggles for social acceptance continue. Public
debate swirls around the federal Defense of
Marriages Act passed by Congress last sum
mer. The law decrees that states can refuse to
recognize same-sex marriages granted in other
states and defines marriage as an act between
members of the opposite the sex. No states cur
rently have legalized same-sex marriage. How
ever, several cases challenging current laws
against same-sex marriage are moving
through the state courts.
Lesbians and gays may declare a relation
ship in two ways: a covenant ceremony or a do
mestic partnership registration. Neither op
tion offers legal protection. Although the reli

gious rites of covenant ceremonies are similar
to wedding vows, there are no legal documents
for the minister to sign. In weddings, ministers
sign marriage licenses.
In some cities, couples can register as do
mestic partners; Palo Alto has offered this pro
gram since last year. Some organizations, such
as Stanford, choose to recognize domestic part
ners and may offer benefits such as health in
surance.
Beyond the political and religious rhetoric
are the couples themselves — their experiences
are the true heart of the legal debate. The sto
ries of the Allen-Roumans and the Howtons

show the challenges and joys of each relation
ship.
The San Francisco Muni rattles down the
slope outside the Allen-Roumans' apartment,
inteijecting conversation with an occasional
clang. Artifacts from their world travels fill
their spacious apartment. In their living room,
family pictures crowd the table and mantel
piece, from great-grandfathers to a godchild.
This space represents the many memories that
the couple has collected.

since the ceremony," said Terry,
who graduated the Graduate
School of Business in 1993.
As part of their continued com
mitment to each other, the Allen-
Roumans began hyphenating their
names this year. When they dis
cussed the possibility of having chil
dren, they decided their family
should have a common name.
Terry said the linkage of their
names strengthens perceptions of
their union.
"Family and co-workers are
more likely to ask about Jason,"
Terry said. "They're constantly re
minded by our names."
Despite their demonstrated
commitment to each other, the
Allen-Roumans face inequality by
corporate policies. For example, al
though Terry's workplace is accept
ing of gays, Jason is not eligible for
health benefits. Terry receives less
compensation than others in a sim
ilar job position. Also, in an incident
last year, the couple was not al
lowed to sit together after the air
line upgraded one but not the
other. Normally, married couples
are upgraded together.
"They told us, "You can't prove
you're married,'" Terry said.

legal documents as a wedding pre

such as power of attorney, which

Terry Rouman and Jason Allen
met in 1991 while serving as offi
cers of the Stonewall Gay Democra
tic Club of San Francisco. They pro
posed to each other on Christmas
Day to following year, and began
planning their covenant ceremony
in early 1993. They felt Memorial
Church best fit their needs. In par
ticular, they were impressed with
the sermons of former Assoc. Dean
Diana Akiyama.
Although spiritual, both men
had turned away from their reli
gious upbringing. Both Terry's
Greek Orthodox and Jason's
Catholic church have anti-gay poli
cies.
"The God that we recognize is
loving and does not discriminate,"
Jason said.
The Allen-Roumans currently
worship at Glide Memorial Church
in San Francisco, which is known
for its diverse congregation.

The Allen-Roumans were sur
prised to discover that they were
the first gay couple to request a
covenant ceremony at Memorial
Church. "We weren't tryingto be in
a history book," Jason said. "We
wanted create a better lives for our
selves."
Although the deans of Memorial
Church had anticipated such an
event, it had no formal policy. The
deans discussed the ceremony at
length, to set a policy. Akiyama said
the rationale came out of the funda
mental message of the gospel —
freedom.
Akiyama added, "Sanctifying
love and commitment is important
for couples to grow together."
The Allen-Roumans underwent
three sessions of premarital coun
seling, a requirement for all couples
being married. Ministered by
Akiyama, the couple discussed the
role of God in their lives and how to
make their relationship succeed.
Planning the wedding was an or
deal in itself. The couple constantly
had to see whether the businesses
would have a problem — the baker,
the florist, the tuxedo place, the re
ception hall, the musicians.
"It was a constant coming-out
process," Jason said. Store employ
ees became more aware as a result
of their ceremony and altered poli
cies. The Stanford Crate & Barrel
employees underwent special train
ing after one of the Allen-Rouman's
friends was met by an insensitive
reponse when trying to purchase a
gift. Employees became more sensi
tive to the need to treat same-sex
couples with respect.
Their ceremony encouraged
more than 300 friends and family to
participate. Akiyama asked those in
attendance to say "I do" at the be
ginning of the ceremony. At the re
ception, guests signed a "contract"
pledging their assistance to the cou
ple.
Family members offered sup
port, which has grown over the
years. "My father recognizes that
our marriage is as strong as his
own," Jason said. The circle of sup
port has rippled out to distant rela
tives. Both Terry and Jason look
forward to attending the Rouman
family reunion this summer.
As the coventant ceremony ap
proached, the Allen-Roumans had
worried that protesters would dis
turb the event, making it difficult
for same-sex couples to be united at
Memorial Church in the future. No
protest materialized. The ceremo
ny proceeded as planned, from the

procession down the side aisles to
the ride down University Avenue in
their getaway red convertible.
"We had to work so hard to get
that point. There was never expec
tation for us to get married," Jason
said. "The whole process was much
more active for us."
Unlike the Allen-Roumans,
Nana and Elizabeth Howton had
less difficulty in their ceremony
preparation.
The couple told the people who
worked at the reception site, the
bakery and the caterer that they
were dealing with a lesbian wed
ding and did not encounter discrim
ination.
Elizabeth said she thought the
the bottom line was economics and
that stores wouldn't let prejudice
get in the way of the sale. She added
that some businesses had already
dealt with similar situations.
However, in several stores the
gift registiy computer system re
quired that one partner be a bride
and the other a groom. The compli
cations were eventually worked
out. Both of them were allowed to
register as brides.
Nana, whose maiden name is
Motta, decided to take Elizabeth's
last name after the ceremony. Be
cause she did not have much con
tact with her father, Nana said she
did not feel a strong stake in keep
ing her surname.
After meeting at a social at the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity center and dating more
than four years, Nana and Eliza
beth were united in a covenant cer
emony July 2, 1995.
Elizabeth, a 1991 graduate, said
she was struck by the beauty of
Memorial Church her freshman
year.
"I knew I wanted to be married
there," she said. "Coming out
didn't change that. Being a lesbian
doesn't change the way I want to
lead my life."
The presence of family and
friends at the ceremony was impor
tant to the Howtons, who wanted to
show the strength of their relation
ship.
"I know it changed their atti
tude," Nana said. "Alter that, they
knew this relationship was going to
last."
Her mother, who had never left
Brazil or flown on an airplane,
came to the ceremony. Only one of
Nana's four sisters came, as the
others could not obtain visas in
time.
Elizabeth had the opportunity

to come out to extended family.
"That was the best wedding pre
sent," she said.
The couple was married by Epis
copalian minister Robert C*egg,
Stanford's dean of religious life.
Nana, who was raised Catholic, felt
her family could identify with the
ceremonial similarities of the two
denominations.
"Being in Memorial Church and
having a priest made the differ
ence," Nana said. "It wasn't like
being at city hall."
Their friends also lent their sup
port by participating in the ceremo
ny. One played the violin, one sang
and another acted as the reception
toastmaster. Nana's two closest fe
male friends served as best man
and the best woman.
The sexton kept the door closed
during the ceremony, keeping away
tourists. When the Howtons came
down the aisle and walked out the
door, cameras started flashing.
"When they saw two brides,
their mouths dropped," Elizabeth
said. "Our picture must be all over
Japan."
The Howtons expressed concern
over the lack of legal recognition by
the state. Married couples have
more than 1,000 benefits that they
probably don't even realize they
have, Elizabeth said. It's difficult to
duplicate that protection thorough
domestic partnership and patch
work documentation, she added.
The Howtons registered with
the Palo Alto domestic partnership
program in March last year. For a
$35 fee, couples can declare their
self-described status as partners.
Since its inception last year, 55 cou
ples have registered in Palo Alto.
"There's no legal consequence,"
Elizabeth said. "But we wanted to
get registered in a city that we love
so much, in a city that has been sup
portive."
Elizabeth's workplace has pro
gressive policies and offers domes
tic partnership benefits such as
health insurance.
"They offered benefits for
Nana," Elizabeth said. "I didn't
even have to ask."
The Howtons said they feel for
tunate in that regard. Lesbian and
gay couples feel they are forced "to
ask" for acknowledgment in soci
ety. For the Howtons and Allen-
Iloumans, the covenant ceremony
was the spiritual equivalent of a
wedding.
"We've been blessed, in our
minds and the eyes of God," Eliza
beth said.

munity center and dating more
than four years, Nana and Eliza
beth were united in a covenant cer
emony July 2, 1995.
Elizabeth, a 1991 graduate, said
she was struck by the beauty of
Memorial Church her freshman
year.
"I knew I wanted to be married
there," she said. "Coming out
didn't change that. Being a lesbian
doesn't change the way I want to
lead my life."
The presence of family and
friends at the ceremony was impor
tant to the Howtons, who wanted to
show the strength of their relation
ship.
"I know it changed their atti
tude," Nana said. "Alter that, they
knew this relationship was going to
last."
Her mother, who had never left
Brazil or flown on an airplane,
came to the ceremony. Only one of
Nana's four sisters came, as the
others could not obtain visas in
time.
Elizabeth had the opportunity

to come out to extended family.
"That was the best wedding pre
sent," she said.
The couple was married by Epis
copalian minister Robert C*egg,
Stanford's dean of religious life.
Nana, who was raised Catholic, felt
her family could identify with the
ceremonial similarities of the two
denominations.
"Being in Memorial Church and
having a priest made the differ
ence," Nana said. "It wasn't like
being at city hall."
Their friends also lent their sup
port by participating in the ceremo
ny. One played the violin, one sang
and another acted as the reception
toastmaster. Nana's two closest fe
male friends served as best man
and the best woman.
The sexton kept the door closed
during the ceremony, keeping away
tourists. When the Howtons came
down the aisle and walked out the
door, cameras started flashing.
"When they saw two brides,
their mouths dropped," Elizabeth
said. "Our picture must be all over
Japan."
The Howtons expressed concern
over the lack of legal recognition by
the state. Married couples have
more than 1,000 benefits that they
probably don't even realize they
have, Elizabeth said. It's difficult to
duplicate that protection thorough
domestic partnership and patch
work documentation, she added.
The Howtons registered with
the Palo Alto domestic partnership
program in March last year. For a
$35 fee, couples can declare their
self-described status as partners.
Since its inception last year, 55 cou
ples have registered in Palo Alto.
"There's no legal consequence,"
Elizabeth said. "But we wanted to
get registered in a city that we love
so much, in a city that has been sup
portive."
Elizabeth's workplace has pro
gressive policies and offers domes
tic partnership benefits such as
health insurance.
"They offered benefits for
Nana," Elizabeth said. "I didn't
even have to ask."
The Howtons said they feel for
tunate in that regard. Lesbian and
gay couples feel they are forced "to
ask" for acknowledgment in soci
ety. For the Howtons and Allen-
Iloumans, the covenant ceremony
was the spiritual equivalent of a
wedding.
"We've been blessed, in our
minds and the eyes of God," Eliza
beth said.
When Terry and Jason Allen-Rouman at
tended the baptismal of their godson last year,
they were honored to be chosen to care for the
child under any circumstance.
"It was courageous for my cousin to ask a
gay couple to be godparents," Terry said.
Being accepted as godparents was yet an
other affirmation of their union by their fami
lies. The Allen-Roumans were the first gay cou
ple joined in a "covenant ceremony" — the reli
gious blessing of same-sex relationships — at
Stanford Memorial Church on Sept. 6, 1993.
Four years later, one more male couple and a
female couple have been joined at Memorial
Church. Elizabeth and Nana Howton were the
first female couple united.
Although the couples found spiritual fulfill
ment in their covenant ceremonies, their
struggles for social acceptance continue. Public
debate swirls around the federal Defense of
Marriages Act passed by Congress last sum
mer. The law decrees that states can refuse to
recognize same-sex marriages granted in other
states and defines marriage as an act between
members of the opposite the sex. No states cur
rently have legalized same-sex marriage. How
ever, several cases challenging current laws
against same-sex marriage are moving
through the state courts.
Lesbians and gays may declare a relation
ship in two ways: a covenant ceremony or a do
mestic partnership registration. Neither op
tion offers legal protection. Although the reli

gious rites of covenant ceremonies are similar
to wedding vows, there are no legal documents
for the minister to sign. In weddings, ministers
sign marriage licenses.
In some cities, couples can register as do
mestic partners; Palo Alto has offered this pro
gram since last year. Some organizations, such
as Stanford, choose to recognize domestic part
ners and may offer benefits such as health in
surance.
Beyond the political and religious rhetoric
are the couples themselves — their experiences
are the true heart of the legal debate. The sto
ries of the Allen-Roumans and the Howtons

show the challenges and joys of each relation
ship.
The San Francisco Muni rattles down the
slope outside the Allen-Roumans' apartment,
inteijecting conversation with an occasional
clang. Artifacts from their world travels fill
their spacious apartment. In their living room,
family pictures crowd the table and mantel
piece, from great-grandfathers to a godchild.
This space represents the many memories that
the couple has collected.
"My love for Jason has grown every day

since the ceremony," said Terry,
who graduated the Graduate
School of Business in 1993.
As part of their continued com
mitment to each other, the Allen-
Roumans began hyphenating their
names this year. When they dis
cussed the possibility of having chil
dren, they decided their family
should have a common name.
Terry said the linkage of their
names strengthens perceptions of
their union.
"Family and co-workers are
more likely to ask about Jason,"
Terry said. "They're constantly re
minded by our names."
Despite their demonstrated
commitment to each other, the
Allen-Roumans face inequality by
corporate policies. For example, al
though Terry's workplace is accept
ing of gays, Jason is not eligible for
health benefits. Terry receives less
compensation than others in a sim
ilar job position. Also, in an incident
last year, the couple was not al
lowed to sit together after the air
line upgraded one but not the
other. Normally, married couples
are upgraded together.
"They told us, "You can't prove
you're married,'" Terry said.
A friend who is lawyer drew up
legal documents as a wedding pre
sent. They have legal protections
such as power of attorney, which
enables them to care for each other
in the event of an emergency.
Terry Rouman and Jason Allen
met in 1991 while serving as offi
cers of the Stonewall Gay Democra
tic Club of San Francisco. They pro
posed to each other on Christmas
Day to following year, and began
planning their covenant ceremony
in early 1993. They felt Memorial
Church best fit their needs. In par
ticular, they were impressed with
the sermons of former Assoc. Dean
Diana Akiyama.
Although spiritual, both men
had turned away from their reli
gious upbringing. Both Terry's
Greek Orthodox and Jason's
Catholic church have anti-gay poli
cies.
"The God that we recognize is
loving and does not discriminate,"
Jason said.
The Allen-Roumans currently
worship at Glide Memorial Church
in San Francisco, which is known
for its diverse congregation.

The Allen-Roumans were sur
prised to discover that they were
the first gay couple to request a
covenant ceremony at Memorial
Church. "We weren't tryingto be in
a history book," Jason said. "We
wanted create a better lives for our
selves."
Although the deans of Memorial
Church had anticipated such an
event, it had no formal policy. The
deans discussed the ceremony at
length, to set a policy. Akiyama said
the rationale came out of the funda
mental message of the gospel —
freedom.
Akiyama added, "Sanctifying
love and commitment is important
for couples to grow together."
The Allen-Roumans underwent
three sessions of premarital coun
seling, a requirement for all couples
being married. Ministered by
Akiyama, the couple discussed the
role of God in their lives and how to
make their relationship succeed.
Planning the wedding was an or
deal in itself. The couple constantly
had to see whether the businesses
would have a problem — the baker,
the florist, the tuxedo place, the re
ception hall, the musicians.
"It was a constant coming-out
process," Jason said. Store employ
ees became more aware as a result
of their ceremony and altered poli
cies. The Stanford Crate & Barrel
employees underwent special train
ing after one of the Allen-Rouman's
friends was met by an insensitive
reponse when trying to purchase a
gift. Employees became more sensi
tive to the need to treat same-sex
couples with respect.
Their ceremony encouraged
more than 300 friends and family to
participate. Akiyama asked those in
attendance to say "I do" at the be
ginning of the ceremony. At the re
ception, guests signed a "contract"
pledging their assistance to the cou
ple.
Family members offered sup
port, which has grown over the
years. "My father recognizes that
our marriage is as strong as his
own," Jason said. The circle of sup
port has rippled out to distant rela
tives. Both Terry and Jason look
forward to attending the Rouman
family reunion this summer.
As the coventant ceremony ap
proached, the Allen-Roumans had
worried that protesters would dis
turb the event, making it difficult
for same-sex couples to be united at
Memorial Church in the future. No
protest materialized. The ceremo
ny proceeded as planned, from the

procession down the side aisles to
the ride down University Avenue in
their getaway red convertible.
"We had to work so hard to get
that point. There was never expec
tation for us to get married," Jason
said. "The whole process was much
more active for us."
Unlike the Allen-Roumans,
Nana and Elizabeth Howton had
less difficulty in their ceremony
preparation.
The couple told the people who
worked at the reception site, the
bakery and the caterer that they
were dealing with a lesbian wed
ding and did not encounter discrim
ination.
Elizabeth said she thought the
the bottom line was economics and
that stores wouldn't let prejudice
get in the way of the sale. She added
that some businesses had already
dealt with similar situations.
However, in several stores the
gift registiy computer system re
quired that one partner be a bride
and the other a groom. The compli
cations were eventually worked
out. Both of them were allowed to
register as brides.
Nana, whose maiden name is
Motta, decided to take Elizabeth's
last name after the ceremony. Be
cause she did not have much con
tact with her father, Nana said she
did not feel a strong stake in keep
ing her surname.
