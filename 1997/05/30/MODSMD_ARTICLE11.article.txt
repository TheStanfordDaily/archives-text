Boy flies first-class to Jamaica
MIAMI (AP) — To a 12-year-old living in a
downtown shelter for runaways, the plush Sandals
Resort in Jamaica looked like a nice place to go.
So Rubin Livingstone set out for paradise.
And he nearly got there.
He had no money and didn't have a passport or
other ID. But that was not much of an obstacle for
the young adventurer (who apparently also failed
to grasp from advertisements that Sandals is for
couples only).
The boy managed somehow to get aboard an
American Airlines flight at the Miami airport
without a ticket.
Even better: A flight attendant told him he
could sit in first-class.
On the ground in Montego Bay, Jamaica, the
youngster walked right through customs. "He
didn't have any baggage, so he didn't have any

thing to declare," said a U.S. Embassy official who
asked not to be identified.
McVeigh jury hears summations
DENVER (AP) — Timothy McVeigh's attorney
urged jurors yesterday not to be swayed by sympa
thy for the Oklahoma City bombing victims, after
prosecutors delivered a wrenching closing argu
ment that portrayed the defendant as a terrorist
who killed children in the belief he was a patriot.
Using McVeigh's own words against him, pros
ecutor Larry Mackey said the 168 people who died
in the April 19, 1995, blast were not "tyrants
whose blood had to be spilled to preserve liberty."
But in the defense summation, lead attorney
Stephen Jones said the prosecution based a sub
stantial part of its case on emotion. Jones argued
that jurors should focus on the prosecution's evi
dence, which he said was badly flawed.
