# Girl, 7, killed as dad gambles

PRIMM, Nev. (AP) — On the road to Las Vegas,
right after the last hill in California, three casinos
straddle Interstate 15, beckoning eager gamblers
with bright lights, $1 hot dogs and a roller coaster
and log ride for kids.
The come-ons worked so well over the Memorial
Day weekend that the arcade at the Primadonna
hotel was kept open late.
It was here that 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson came
to play. And it was here that she died, raped and
strangled in a restroom stall.
Casino surveillance tapes showed her killer may
have played hide-and-seek with little Sherrice before
following her into the restroom. Some 300 video
surveillance cameras monitor the three resorts. In
the 25 minutes he was in with the girl, several
women used the restroom and didn't report seeing
or hearing anything.
Late Wednesday night, police arrested a Long
Beach, Calif., high school student after two teenage
girls told their parents he had bragged to them about
the killing. Police said 18-year-old Jeremy Joseph

Strohmeyer was the man seen on surveillance cam
eras lollowing Sherrice into the women's restroom.
"We don't have any doubt it's him," said Las
Vegas Police Lt. Wayne Petersen, who said
Strohmeyer was cooperating with police.
Classmates at Woodrow Wilson High School in
Long Beach — where he was two weeks shy of grad
uation — described Strohmeyer as smart but pro
foundly troubled and said he routinely mixed alcohol
with speed.
Over the weekend, Leroy Iverson arrived at the
Primadonna on what he said was supposed to be a
family vacation for Sherrice and her 14-year-old
brother. After driving from their south Los Angeles
home, however, the family had no room at the hotel,
and the father simply gambled the night away in the
hotel's casino.
While Iverson gambled, Sherrice and her brother
played in the arcade. Twice, security guards found
her alone and called her father. A third time they
found her sleeping on a chair in the arcade, only an
hour or so before she was killed.
