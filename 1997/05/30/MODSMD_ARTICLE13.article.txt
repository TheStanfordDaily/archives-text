Fiscal responsibility in
question after ex-ASSU
president's extravagance

The assu president
has a $2.8-million checking
account.
At the last meeting of this
year's ASSU Senate, Financial
Manager John Hall announced
that the political division of the
ASSU — as distinct from the
business and service projects —
had exceeded its 1996-97 operat
ing budget by some $10,000, the
majority of which was spent by
former President Bill Shen on
projects ranging from the Jesse
Jackson Dinesh D'Souza affirma
tive action debate to the now-infa
mous custom-printed adhesive
notepads
Shen overspent his $9,250 pro
gramming and discretionary bud
gets by $9,841 — that's an aston
ishing 106 percent overdraft.
While it's understandable to
stretch one's budget a little for
meaningful programming, as
Shen has insisted he did, it's
entirely unreasonable to spend
twice the amount of money avail
able to you, even if you do have
$2.8 million — the size of the
ASSU endowment — in overdraft
protection.
And while the $9,841 may not
seem like much to Shen, it's a lot
from a student's perspective.
With the money Shen overspent,
a student could purchase 3,082
Jamba Juice smoothies or pay for
a full quarter's tuition, room and
board.
However, blame cannot be
directed solely at Shen. It is the
existing budgeting structure that
leads to this type of behavior.
Shen, for the most part, had no
oversight and never had to
arrange for any extension of funds
to cover his additional expenses.
Some of the items paid for were

spent out of his pocket, and he was
simply reimbursed without regard
to the senate-created constraints
placed on his budget.
If the president's budget was
underfunded, as Shen contends,
reallocations should have been
made by the senate's Budget and
Finance Committee. (The total
presidential budget, including
salary, has been increased for the
upcoming year.)
Mechanisms must be put in
place that will protect the ASSU
from this lack of oversight. The
Budget and Finance Committee
did freeze Shen's accounts in
early spring to stop the extrava
gance, but the hold soon was
released to pay outstanding con
tracts. What is a budget worth if
it can be easily bypassed with
loophole policies supported by the
financial office?
Under the new endowment
structure designed by Hall, politi
cal budgets will be monitored by a
designated manager. But such a
position already exists; this year
it just wasn't filled.
While the ASSU is not in dan
ger of going into the red, its cur
rent fiscal practice casts doubt on
its services and reliability. Filling
this monitoring position should
be a top priority for incoming
Financial Manager Don Coleman.
It also makes little sense to
allow this type of fiscal behavior
considering the limited funds
available to other ASSU divisions.
The Program Board, Community
Service Board and Publications
Board are not allowed to allocate
more funds than they have. The
lack of a check on presidential
spending is inexcusable in light of
the aggressive oversight of other
funding sources.
Neither the financial office nor
the senate has expressed interest
in solving the problem of irre
sponsible budgeting, but it must
be addressed. Sound fiscal and
oversight policy is necessary in
maintaining the reliability of any
organization.
