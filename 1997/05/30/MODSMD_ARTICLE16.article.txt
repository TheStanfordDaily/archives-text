## A 						stranger known to all 
### 
THERE ARE TWO words Jose writes
with absolute confidence. J-O-S-E
and S-U-R X-3. His name and his
gang. Jose has already had more than his
share of the state of the world. He risks his
life jumping from rooftops and yells "I die"
at the top of his lungs.
"Jose is a bad liar," his teacher says."I
don't trust him at all."
"Jose is very strange," the school secre
tary says when I call.
"Oh, you know these kids," the yard
duty says. "Watch out for that Jose."
"My mom don't want me to play with
Jose," says Pablo, Jose's professed best
friend. His mother thinks Jose is the devil,
which is fitting perhaps; even the older
Surerio gang members on his street have
that perception. Each one has a nickname.
Jose, age 10, is known as "El Diablo."
Jose is the subject that grabs the atten
tion of graduate students writing theses.
Self-destructive. He is the statistic that
newspapers run in headlines. Youth gang
membership. But rumor has it he is also
the future of America. And America has
thrown up her hands not because she
doesn't care but because she doesn't know
what to do with him.
Pity is a suffocating feeling. I know; I
have spent days with my heart in my
throat because of it. It pours over me as
millions of children worldwide live in
absolute fear of murder by death squads
or embargoes. It boils up around me as
drive-bys pile bodies on the streets of

segregated America. Something is
wrong. It is a scream that wants to
escape from my throat but will never be
loud enough, never be passionate
enough. Something is wrong.
The person who grabs my hand and
pulls me out of the flood of fear and pity
always has a different face. Today, as I was
drowning, that person was Jose.
I know the Jose who jumps off buildings
and causes my heart to lodge in my throat.
But I know another Jose. One who offers
me a dry spot under the tree, even when it
means he'll have to stand in the rain. One
who fixes his mother's needlepoint and
holds his sister's hand. I know another
Jose, or rather, I know another part of the
same Jose. He rides on my shoulders and
then attempts to carry me on his.
Often the sheer enormity of raw pain
that tears at the heart of anyone willing to
open his eyes even a crack can be incapaci
tating. There is so much to be done that
even starting seems futile.
Because we forget when we hear only
about the hurt. We forget there are others
struggling under the same weight. I forget.
Until Jose reaches out his hand and
pulls me from the mire of my own help
lessness. Jose reaches out and reminds me
that what we carry on our shoulders is not
a burden. It is not the weight of a world of
bleak statistics. It is a child.
And I take that hand because one-quar
ter of the children in this country are born
to poverty or because one-quarter of the

children in other countries are born to die
before age 5. I take it because it has even
once been said of a child that "he was born
to die" and because that expectation some
how reduced the sharpness of the loss felt
by those of us who heard it on the news.
I take Jose's hand in respec, not in pity.
I take it because that hand is powerful.
Jose listens carefully. It is easy to miss,
perhaps, when he is in a fight or tagging
Sur X3. It is even easy to miss when he is
helping his mother with her needlepoint.
But Jose listens. He listens to the teacher
and to the yard duty and to his friends'
parents. And although he constantly
demonstrates generosity, concern and
affection, these are not the focus of veiy
many people's attentions. Maybe he is
turning into the devil before our eyes.
More likely though, he is turning into the
devil in our eyes.
I never feel helpless and I never feel pity
when Jose is holding my hand. Because
then I remember that he is as complex as I
am, as capable as I am of carrying others.
Because then I remember that we carry
each other. Do not pity the statistical
stranger. Learn his name.
