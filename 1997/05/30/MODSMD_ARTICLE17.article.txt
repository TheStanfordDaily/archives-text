Faculty diversity continues to be an unmet promise

AS MEChA, WE would like to
express our concern regarding
the University's commitment to
the hiring and tenure of minority fac
ulty. For more than 27 years, our stu
dent organization has worked to pro
mote and encourage the recruitment
and retention of faculty members who
will serve our community as strong
mentors as well as innovative and
insightful scholars. In light of the
recent events surrounding the denial of
tenure for integral members of the
Stanford community such as Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta and
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak, we
look to the University now more than

ever to provide a strong commitment to
faculty members who make their
respective departments vibrant compo
nents of the intellectual community at
Stanford.
When we look at the composition of
Chicano faculty in our own Chicano /
Latino community, for example, we
find only a small number of tenured
faculty members â€” one member in
each department at the most. From
Sept. 1, 1986, to Sept. 1, 1996, the per
centage of Latino faculty has only
grown from 1.67 percent to 2.76 per
cent. Over this 10-year period, percent
ages for women, African-American,
Native American and Asian-American

faculty have also failed to rise signifi
cantly.
As Stanford students, we find it
imperative that our University adminis
tration take its commitment to diversi
ty seriously. We believe that recruit
ment of minority / women faculty by
individual departments is important
and that the tenure process should be
one that values the intellectual scholar
ship that these faculty members bring
to the University. Furthermore, we find
it the responsibility of the University to
offer its faculty members the necessary
resources to support them in their path
of becoming long-term members of the
academic community at Stanford.

University President Gerhard
Casper said when he took office in
September 1993 that minority faculty
hiring is a "source of urgent concern."
We hope the University administration
will keep this commitment to diversity
in mind as it makes decisions involving
the tenure process. We look forward to
administrators' continued commitment
to diversity in the academic arena and
to providing our community and the
University the opportunity for stu
dents to gain from the invaluable con
tributions that these faculty members
offer.
