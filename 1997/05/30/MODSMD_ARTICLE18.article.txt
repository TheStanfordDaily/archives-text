# Community to suffer an artistic blow with dismissal of quartet
## 
### 
If the idea of a resident ensemble is
at all attractive to the University now, it
is due to what the Stanford String
Quartet has accomplished in its 13-vear
history. The quartet has grown into an
ensemble of international reputation
and provides this University with the
very model of what an ensemble-in-resi
dence can provide.
The quartet tours and records as an
independent ensemble, bringing Stan
ford's name and its commitment to the
arts to audiences around the world. The
quartet forms the foundation of the
string faculty and the chamber music
program within the Music Department,
provides both a laboratory for budding
composers, an outlet for accomplished
ones, and illustrates Beethoven quartets
in classrooms arid collaborates with dis

tinguished performers locally and
nationally. The quartet presents music
all across campus, from graduate
schools to dorms, gives regular open
rehearsals and participates in interde
partmental collaborations (such as the
recent Holocaust symposium presented
by the Center for the Humanities). The
quartet has forged strong ties with the
community through its support organi
zation, the Friends of the Stanford
String Quartet, as well as ongoing out
reach and educational events for school
children on the Peninsula.
The quartet is the only full-time fac
ulty ensemble on this campus and as
such provides one of Stanford's most vis
ible artistic assets. The notion that the
independence and autonomy that John
Etchemendy, senior associate dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
spoke of can only be achieved through
the "outsourcing" of chamber music is
untrue and harmful to the spirit of
music at Stanford.
Since March of last year the quartet
had been in consultation with the Music
Department and the dean's office in

forging a relationship that transformed
us into a full-fledged independent
ensemble-in-residence. Contract negotia
tions did not "break down." The Univer
sity decided to terminate the appoint
ments of the members of the quartet in
defiance of the agreement we had actual
ly reached, to the shock of all involved.
What the quartet has built over 13
years should not be allowed to be lost.
The relationships that have been nur
tured and allowed to grow between a
quartet and its school, through the con
tinued commitment and vision of its
members and its myriad supporters
across this campus should be valued, not
cut off. The Music Department, the Uni
versity and the community will be
diminished if this is allowed to happen.
