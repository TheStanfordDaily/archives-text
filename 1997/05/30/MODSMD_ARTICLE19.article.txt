# Senior Gift ads hook us on 'donation habit'
## 
### 
In the last two days, the Senior Gift
has spent $1,286 promoting itself with
ads in The Daily.
This is a lot of money, particularly
when considered along with all the
other money spent on mailings, phone
calls, bullhorns and all the other tac
tics used to get us to give.
Obviously the $20 they ask us to
give doesn't really matter; what mat
ters is that we become addicted to giv
ing and that we improve the statistics
on giving that factor into our public
reputation.
I'm not saying that donation to Stan
ford is bad. I'm just questioning the val
ues of a university where most students
will receive more telephone calls asking
them to donate to the Senior Gift than
they will from their freshman academic
adviser.
