The special day for blushing grooms and
dashing brides is every day at Memorial
Church.
About 180 weddings take place at Memor
ial Church each year, said wedding coordina
tor Betsy Koester. There are up to five wed
dings on any given Saturday.
The cost is around $1,050 for current stu
dents and $1, 350 for alumni. That includes
the clergy, the organist and three premarital
counseling sessions.
Despite the myth of three year waiting
lists, a couple can set a date for a wedding in
as little as three months, depending on what

day they choose. Koester said that she books
popular dates up to a year in advance.
The lead time of three months is necessary
for counseling sessions and to coordinate
scheduling with the clergy, said Assoc. Dean
for Religious Life Maurice Charles.
Charles noted that the administration of
wedding and covenant ceremonies is com
pletely separate. Weddings are scheduled by
the wedding coordinator, while covenant cer
emonies are handled at the discretion of cler
gy-
In addition, covenant ceremonies must be
scheduled around the slots reserved for wed
dings. Couples interested in this type of cere
mony must avoid the slots reserved for wed
dings, Charles said.
