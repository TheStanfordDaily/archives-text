Afler a year's absence, Extravaganza is back this
year as the Asian American Students Association's last
cultural celebration for Asian / Pacific Islander Her
itage Month.
The event, in White Plaza from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
today, will feature food booths and information tables
for student cultural organizations.
Cultural performances will also be given by a number
of groups, including Bhangra Dance by Nakhra, Hawaii
Club Luau, Stanford Taiko and Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford.
"We're trying to show the diversity of the Asian-
American community incorporated into the overall di
versity of Stanford," said sophomore Andrew Chiang,
AASA vice-chair. "Diversity and unity can and should
coexist, and [theyl are both things that we should cele
brate as a sensitive Stanford community."
This is AASA's firstyear running Extravaganza. The
event was organized by Okada House for the past 13
years. According to AASA Chair Jane Kim, a sopho
more, Okada decided last year that it would not organize
Extravaganza in order to focus on organizing other her
itage month events that go beyond food and cultural
performances.
"Okada wanted to expand on API Heritage Month.
Instead of doing just cultural performances, they decid
ed to do events like Comedy of Color and Da Hype, which
bring in two new dimensions — comedy and hip hop —
which aren't normally presented as part of the Asian-
American community," Kim said.
"One of the main purposes of Extravaganza is to

bring communities together to celebrate API Heritage
Month, and we want to do it in a visible way," she added.
"We're trying to attract people who don't normally
come to Asian-American events."
The event will also display various non-Asian cul
tures as part of its aim to reach out to other communi
ties.
"I think inviting other ethnic performing groups or
other folklore groups adds a lot to the ambiance of the
festivities," said junior Ines Barbosa, a member of Bal
let Folklorico.
"Ethnic pride isn't necessarily exclusive. By inviting
other groups, it's a celebration of ethnicity as a cultural
trait and part of an identity," she said.
Sophomore Daniel Lin, chair of Stanford University
Nikkei, a Japanese-American student group, said the
aim of the event is to "embrace the breadth or the span
of API Heritage Month.
"The organizers went out of their way to make sure
the diversity of interests, people and issues is covered,"
Lin said. He added that he thinks this year's event has
encouraged a wide variety of groups to participate.
The event aims not only to reach out to other ethnic
communities but also to manifest the diversity within
the Asian -American com mu nity, according to fresh man
Shelley Tadaki, who will be secretary of AASA next year.
"A lot of times when people think of AASA, they
think of East Asian, but hopefully when they see us
putting on this event they'll see how diverse the Asian
community here is and how the different ethnic com
munities are working together — that they have things
in common," she said.
Tadaki said AASA would try to cosponsor Extrava
ganza with other student groups next year.
