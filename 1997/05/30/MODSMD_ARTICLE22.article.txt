# Six students win Hoefer Prizes

The winners of a new prize awarded May 21 repre
sent all areas of undergraduate academics and exem
plify the universally required talent of clear commu
nication in writing.
The first annual Hoefer Prizes were awarded to six
students for compositions produced for Writing in the
Major classes, which ranged in subject from philoso
phy to civil engineering. Nominated by their respec
tive professors, each student's work earned depart
mental recognition and a check for $250.
The idea of the prize is to encourage students to de
velop superior writing skills. It also aims to reward
faculty who foster clear and persuasive writing, said
Ellen Woods, the School of Humanities and Sciences'
assistant dean for undergraduate education.
The award was established by the Hoefer Family
Foundation and Kurt Hoefer, who graduated with a
bachelor's in economics in 1987.
"During the award presentations, it was made ob
vious how demanding Writing in the Major classes are
and how the students came up to the challenge week
after week," Woods said. "But it was also evident how
well the faculty had been able to coach them."
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Daniel Stack nominated
sophomore John Mongan, selecting his work out of
piles of Chemistry 134 lab reports.
"John collected incredible data and had the dili

gence to get it right," Stack explained. "And besides
this, his presentation and thought process were so
well organizedâ€” uncluttered."
While Mongan may have an upper hand on other
aspiring chemists, the ability to write well is a skill
often neglected in scientific courses. "In the real
world," however, "we're not judged necessarily by
what we've done," Stack said, "but how we present it
and write it up."
Julie Kennedy, an earth systems lecturer, echoed
Stack's sentiment. "If you can't communicate your
results effectively, you might afe well not have done
anything at all," she said.
Kennedy nominated senior Irene Chan for her
paper detailing the results and experiences of her bi
ology research internship. Chan's skillful integration
of highly technical data with personal reflection made
it especially remarkable, she said.
Both faculty members agreed that the move for
stronger writing requirements is a good direction for
the University. Revisions that created more hefty for
eign language requirements, added Writing in the
Major and developed the new system of requirements
were implemented in 1996.
Writing in the Major mandates that undergradu
ates complete one writing-intensive course within
their major to graduate.
The other award winners were seniors Jonathan
Brown, Sandy Lui and Rahul Young and junior
Regine Spector.
