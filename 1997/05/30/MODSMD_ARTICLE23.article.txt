## Card starts CWS vs. Auburn 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team is off to
Omaha, Neb., for one reason and one
reason only — to bring home the nation
al championship.
The Cardinal (43-18) received the No.
3 seed in a pool of eight teams behind
top-ranked Alabama (52-12) and defend
ing champion Louisiana State (53-13).
Stanford opens play today at 12:30 on
ESPN (STV Channel 34) against the No.
6 seed, Auburn (49-15). Also in the field
of eight are UCLA (45-19-1), Miami
(Fla.) (49-16), Rice (47-14) and Missis
sippi State (46-19).
The juniors and seniors on the team
have been to Omaha before, when the
Cardinal made an early exit after three
games in 1995. This time, the last chance
for many, hopefully will be different.
"The guys who have been there before
aren't just happy to go again," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess. "They
want to win it."
Leading the charge for the Card
recently has been sophomore third base
man Josh Hochgesang. He was named
the most valuable player last weekend in
the West Regional at Stanford, where

the Card qualified for the series.
Hochgesang hit .500 with eight hits, two
home runs and seven RBIs — in four
games.
Junior pitcher Kyle Peterson (11-2)
earned two of the four victories in the
regional, one against Northeastern and
one in the championship game against
Fresno State. Against the Bulldogs,
Peterson faced the minimum number of
batters over the final 7 2/3 innings and
allowed only two runs in the complete
game victory. Peterson, who grew up
outside Omaha, has attended the series
his whole life, and playing in it for the
second time is a dream come true.
"The College World Series is very spe
cial for me," he said.
Yet while individuals have helped the
team reach this point, one of the Cardi
nal's strengths is its depth of talent and
great chemistry. Going into the play
offs, Stanford had a team batting aver
age of .338, with eight out of the nine
starters batting better than .300. Every
game seems to have a different hero, a
different player stepping up to the occa
sion.
"We don't have many big-name play
ers," said junior catcher Jon Schaeffer.
"No one is trying to steal the show. Wt

all give anything to win on offense or
defense, whatever it takes."
This team's attitude has defined the
Cardinal all season and could be the
extra something that all championship
squads need. This positive attitude com
bined with the determined work ethic of
the team should lead to success.
"We have worked hard all year,"
Schaeffer said. "You can never be upset
with failure if you work hard, but nor
mally good things will happen."
Another strength of the Cardinal
entering the series is its pitching staff.
While making it through the regionals
requires much pitching depth, the series
does not. In fact, it is possible to win the
national title with only two starting
pitchers. This works in favor of the Car
dinal, which has an exceptionally talent
ed top few pitchers but not as much
depth as some other squads.
The top two starters in Omaha will be
Peterson and sophomore Chad Hutchin
son. Hutchinson has been effective
recently, tossing a four-hit complete
game against Texas A&M in the region
al. Other important contributors, most
likely out of the bullpen, will be sopho
mores Jeff Austin, Brent Hoard and
Tony Cogan.
