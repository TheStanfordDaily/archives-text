# Patience pays off for Schaeffer

If you can't recognize a certain
Stanford baseball player down on the
field, check his hair.
Yellow? Shaved? Psychedelic?
Chances are it's junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer.
Besides emerging as the premier
run producer for the Cardinal's pro
lific offense, Schaeffer doubles as a
novice hair experimenter.
"People have often told me that
they can't recognize me because I've
died my hair or changed the style,"
Schaeffer said. "It always changes."
He claimed that the changes on his
scalp can affect the Cardinal's perfor
mance on the field.
"Last year, we weren't playing
very well," he said. "So I changed my
hair. Then we won 16 games in a
row."
More often, however, the team
would rather Schaeffer not tinker
with his magic touch. This year, he's
helped Stanford steam to a 43-18
record (21-9 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) and a berth

in the NCAA Baseball World Series in
Omaha, Neb. His 20 home runs, 73
RBIa and .367 average make him
Stanford's No. 1 offensive weapon.
But it wasn't always this good for
Schaeffer. During his first two years,
he was relegated to designated hit
ting duties as a backup catcher to All-
American A.J. Hinch, who was select
ed by the Oakland Athletics in last
year's draft.
"Being behind Hinch had its pros
and cons," Schaeffer said. "For one
thing, if you're not going to play
because someone's taking your place,
he's the guy not to play for. And I
learned a lot about the game from
him."
But Schaeffer, at heart, was a
baseball player, not a bench warmer.
"I remember hoping that Hinch
would sign a contract and leave
school after his junior year so that I
could play," Schaeffer said. "But he
decided to stay on.
"It was tough sitting there, hoping
I could play."
Last year, as a sophomore desig
nated hitter, he tied the team high in
home runs with 11 but hit only .292,

a far cry from this year's offensive
explosion.
"I'm proving to myself that I could
produce," Schaeffer said. "I set, some
goals at the beginning of the season
and have been able to hit way above
them."
Schaeffer has certainly made up
for any previous lack of playing time.
As a feisty cleanup hitter this year,
he was named third-team All-Ameri
can at catcher and appointed to the
All-Six-Pac team.
"It is always nice to be recog
nized," Schaeffer said.
Stanford's College World Series
appearance will be the second for Scha
effer. The team went his freshman
year but was eliminated after three
games.
"That year, we were just happy to
be there," he said. "But this year it's
different. We know we have a great
chance and that we're the team to
beat. You have to go into the series
that way. If you don't think you're
the best, you can get caught in all the
hype about how good the other teams
are and lose your focus."
Schaeffer hopes the team
makes the most of its chances
this year, as he's considering
leaving the Farm next year for
professional baseball.
"I'd love to play pro ball," he
said. "It's a goal of mine. If the
chance comes up, I might take
it. But I like it at school, too, so
whatever happens is fine."
If baseball goals don't crys
tallize, Schaeffer has dreams of
a music career as a backup plan.
"Music is my passion," he

said. "Eventually, I would like
to own my own record label. I
don't have any talent, but I
think I have an ear for good
music."
Schaeffer concedes one point,
though: "Obviously, that's
biased. Everyone thinks that
their taste is best."
At the very least, he does own
the biggest CD collection in
town.
But during the series, Schaef
fer will put music plans on the
back burner and make baseball
his top priority.
"I want to do anything I can
to help the team win," he said.
"I'll even play shortstop or
something."
