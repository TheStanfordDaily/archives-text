## Unlikely story rises in pursuit of dream 
### 
I've never considered myself to
be one of those reporters who
would break her neck to get a
story. I'm definitely not the Lois
Lane type, and I've never ended
up in physical danger just to get
the news. (Pause to allow my edi
tors and those die-hards in the

news room to pick themselves up
ofT the floor.)
When you think about it, sports
doesn't require that kind of gung
ho, show-no-mercy, I'm-getting
this-story-dead-or-alive attitude.
We just go to the games, talk to
the players and coaches and pre
tend to have a greater knowledge
of the game than our readers.
That's why I was surprised to
find myself in Salt Lake City
thinking ahout what a great story
my whole trip would make. But
once the thought hit me, I
couldn't get rid of it. I thought
about it more and more as we
trailed down the highway, and by
the time I got home, I was getting
downright philosophical about the
whole thing.
"Don't let weeds grow around
your dreams."
That's one of the quotes on my
wall from Life's Little Instruction
Book. It jumped out at me just
hours after my return from Utah.
Being engrossed in the world of
sports longer than I can actually
remember, I've seen a lot of
dreams. When you think about it,
that's what makes sports so great
— the fairy-tale season that ends
with a championship, the improb

able hero who makes the game
winning play.
We've all witnessed those
moments in sports, and some are
even lucky enough to have experi
enced them. But after my trip to
Utah, I learned what it really
means to "not let weeds grow
around your dreams."
Most people (myself included)
are too busy with everyday life to
follow their dreams. We think if
we keep one eye on our dream and
one eye on the road, the weeds
won't grow. And that may be true,
but if that's all you're doing, noth
ing is going to grow and your
dream is going to stay just that, a
dream.
When my friend told me she
wanted to go to Utah to try out for
the Utah Starzz — one of eight
new professional basketball teams
in the Women's National Basket
ball Association, I said, "Go for it."
Then I agreed to make the 12-
hour drive with her so she
wouldn't have to go alone. That's
where it all began.
Forget the fact that I had a
paper due Friday and was sched
uled to go white water rafting
Sunday — tryouts were Thursday
and Friday at the Salt Lake Com
munity College so we had to leave
Wednesday. I packed the cooler
and some clothes, secured a
promise from my friend that we
would stop in Reno on the way
back and was off for Salt Lake
City, ETA 1 a.m.
Some 10 hours later we were
cruising along the highway just an
hour from Salt Lake. My friend
had already lost one credit card;
we had almost run out of gas twice
(thank Cod for Delle, Utah!), and I
was beginning to question our
sanity. That's when I realized a
person's dreams don't have to
make sense to anybody but that
person.

I didn't have to understand why
we were 1,000 miles away from
school while all of our friends were
probably in bed or up studying.
What I did know was that our rea
son for being there didn't have to
matter to anyone but my compan
ion. I think I understood her rea
sons, but in the end that was abso
lutely irrelevant.
Two hours later, I was wonder
ing why I agreed to any of this as
we settled into the bucket seats of
my friend's car rather than a
motel. "Dreams, keep thinking

about dreams," I reminded myself
the next morning as I changed and
freshened up at a 7 Eleven bath
room.
Then we went to the tryout,
and I started to get an idea. Yes,
I'm sometimes a little slow with
these things, but give me a break
— I had slept in the car. Finally
the light bulb went on, and it
occurred to me that this was a
great story. As I watched the 150
women who gathered for the try
out, I found myself looking around
and trying to figure out what their
stories might be.
Some didn't have a chance of
making the team, and I thought
that surely they knew that. But
they still came, and I found myself

respecting them for that. The ages
ranged from graduating seniors in
college to women whose children
came along to watch, and I
thought the combined careers of
all these women were probably
filled with championships, individ
ual honors and more dreams than
I could imagine.
But here they all were. For some
the experience was the start of a
new dream; for others it was per
haps the end of a dream — one last
shot at that hope. I looked back at
my friend and started to think,
"She's graduating from Stanford
next month; she has a great job
lined up after graduation. She
hasn't played basketball competi
tively in three years and only decid-

Ed one week ago to do this. Most
people would think she's crazy."
But looking at the group of
women there, I decided coura
geous was a better word, not just
for my friend but for all the
women. I realized every one of
them would be willing to sleep in a
car or drive much more than 1,000
miles or do just about anything to
get a shot at their dream. That's
when I realized these women
didn't let weeds grow around their
dreams, because succeed or fail,
they had taken the chance and
turned their dreams into a reality.
It was one of those moments in life
when you feel as though you wit
nessed something special, and it
was definitely worth the trip.
I've never considered myself to
be one of those reporters who
would break her neck to get a
story. I'm definitely not the Lois
