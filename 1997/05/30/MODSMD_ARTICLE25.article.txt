## Unlikely story rises in pursuit of dream 
### 
I've never considered myself to
be one of those reporters who
would break her neck to get a
story. I'm definitely not the Lois
Lane type, and I've never ended
up in physical danger just to get
the news. (Pause to allow my edi
tors and those die-hards in the

news room to pick themselves up
ofT the floor.)
When you think about it, sports
doesn't require that kind of gung
ho, show-no-mercy, I'm-getting
this-story-dead-or-alive attitude.
We just go to the games, talk to
the players and coaches and pre
tend to have a greater knowledge
of the game than our readers.
That's why I was surprised to
find myself in Salt Lake City
thinking ahout what a great story
my whole trip would make. But
once the thought hit me, I
couldn't get rid of it. I thought
about it more and more as we
trailed down the highway, and by
the time I got home, I was getting
downright philosophical about the
whole thing.
"Don't let weeds grow around
your dreams."
That's one of the quotes on my
wall from Life's Little Instruction
Book. It jumped out at me just
hours after my return from Utah.
Being engrossed in the world of
sports longer than I can actually
remember, I've seen a lot of
dreams. When you think about it,
that's what makes sports so great
— the fairy-tale season that ends
with a championship, the improb

able hero who makes the game
winning play.
We've all witnessed those
moments in sports, and some are
even lucky enough to have experi
enced them. But after my trip to
Utah, I learned what it really
means to "not let weeds grow
around your dreams."
Most people (myself included)
are too busy with everyday life to
follow their dreams. We think if
we keep one eye on our dream and
one eye on the road, the weeds
won't grow. And that may be true,
but if that's all you're doing, noth
ing is going to grow and your
dream is going to stay just that, a
dream.
When my friend told me she
wanted to go to Utah to try out for
the Utah Starzz — one of eight
new professional basketball teams
in the Women's National Basket
ball Association, I said, "Go for it."
Then I agreed to make the 12-
hour drive with her so she
wouldn't have to go alone. That's
where it all began.
Forget the fact that I had a
paper due Friday and was sched
uled to go white water rafting
Sunday — tryouts were Thursday
and Friday at the Salt Lake Com
munity College so we had to leave
Wednesday. I packed the cooler
and some clothes, secured a
promise from my friend that we
would stop in Reno on the way
back and was off for Salt Lake
City, ETA 1 a.m.
Some 10 hours later we were
cruising along the highway just an
hour from Salt Lake. My friend
had already lost one credit card;
we had almost run out of gas twice
(thank Cod for Delle, Utah!), and I
was beginning to question our
sanity. That's when I realized a
person's dreams don't have to
make sense to anybody but that
person.
