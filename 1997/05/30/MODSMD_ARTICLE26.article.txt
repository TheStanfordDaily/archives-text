### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Both the men's and women's Ultimate
Frisbee teams have an opportunity to prove
their greatness this weekend at the national
collegiate tournament, beginning today and
continuing through Sunday.
Today and tomorrow will consist of pool
play, while the semifinals and finals are on
Sunday. As the top seeds, both teams expect a
spot in the finals.
La Familia, the men's team, and Superfly,
the women's team, have had nearly a month
since regionals to prepare. Both teams have
been tapering for the last couple weeks in
order to maximize their performance at
nationals. The women's team has concentrat
ed on mental imagery as a means of improv
ing its performance, while the men have been
building their mental toughness.

The players have been anticipating the
tournament since the beginning of the sea
son. They are anxious to play, especially tin?
rookies, who have never been to nationals
before.
"We were ready to play the week after
regionals," said women's coach .Jennifer Don
nelly.
The proximity of Davis, Calif., the location
of this year's national tournament, is wel
come to many players.
"A lot of our friends and family will be able
to go," said junior Joy Chen. "We'll have some
fans."
Today, the women will play Seaweed, the
North Carolina-Wilmington women's team.
It should be an exciting match; Stanford lost
to Wilmington last year in the finals.
Pool games will be played to 15 points, quar
terfinal matches to 17 and finals matches to
19. The games last from 2 1/2 to .'1 1/2 hours.

The men's team will play the Yale team,
called Superfly, and the North Carolina-
Wilmington team, called Seamen, today. Like
the women's team, La Familia expects its
toughest competition from Wilmington,
which has one of the top players in the coun
try in Callahan Award runner-up Broc
Adams.
Tomorrow, the squad will play Carleton,
Rice and Wesleyan.
The women's team is very confident going
in to the tournament, and its practices have
been going fairly well. The only exception
occurred last Monday at practice when
freshman Camille Yu dislocated her shoul
der.
The men's team is "relaxed, confident and
looking good," according to captain Christian
Dodge. Its one concern in the playing capabil
ity of sophomore Omer Atesman, whose knee
continues to bother him.
