Live hy intuition and inspiration, and let
your whole life he a revelation.
Words to live hy if you're fifth-year senior
Amanda Renteria. The starting third base
man of the Stanford soft hall team has made
a habit of taking chances and pursuing lofty
goals in her athletic career. The quotation is
copied onto her computer and could he con
sidered her personal motto judging hy her
actions on the playing field.
So it should he no surprise that after a
three-year hiatus from haskethall, Renteria
decided to try out for the Utah Star/./., one of
eight teams in the Women's National Bas
ketball Association.
Hailing from the tiny town of Woodlake,
Calif., Renteria said most of her family and
friends thought she was crazy even to come
to a school like Stanford. They really thought
she had lost it when she decided to try out for
the Cardinal's basketball team in fall 1992
a team that returned all five starters from
its national-title campaign the year before.
"My goal since I was little was to play col
lege ball," Renteria said "It wasn't a matter
of 'Can I?' or 'Will I?' but '1 need to try.'
Regardless of what kind of standing they had
at the timn, I believe if I put my mind to
something and if I m really persistent at
something it can happen. I saw it as an
opportunity vs. a challenge, and if I didn't

take the opportunity, that was something I
was missing out on."
Renteria made the team and after her sec
ond year of basketball joined the upstart soft
hall program in midseason. She scored 12
runs in just 14 games that year and found a
permanent place on the diamond, earning a
scholarship and All-Pacific 10 Conference
honorable mention in her second season.
"It was a developing program, and I there
were| financial reasons," Renteria said. "And
that goes back to one of my goals to earn a
scholarship to Stanford. In order to do that,
it was with softball at the time. Also, I missed
the sport. 1 love softball, and when you're not
doing it, you realize how much you miss it."
So basketball was put on the back burner,
and Renteria pursued a successful softball
career and a double major in political science
and economics. But she never completely
abandoned basketball and continued to play
pickup and intramurals. When her softball
career ended three weeks ago, Renteria
decided to take advantage of the growing
opportunities in women's sports and try out
for the Star/./.
"It was another opportunity," Renteria
said. "And if I didn't take it, I'd be selling
myself short. I don't think that many
women my age get the opportunities that
I've been given. I would consider it an
opportunity to have the ability to try out, to
