# Multi-talented Renteria shoots for WNBA
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Live hy intuition and inspiration, and let
your whole life he a revelation.
Words to live hy if you're fifth-year senior
Amanda Renteria. The starting third base
man of the Stanford soft hall team has made
a habit of taking chances and pursuing lofty
goals in her athletic career. The quotation is
copied onto her computer and could he con
sidered her personal motto judging hy her
actions on the playing field.
So it should he no surprise that after a
three-year hiatus from haskethall, Renteria
decided to try out for the Utah Star/./., one of
eight teams in the Women's National Bas
ketball Association.
Hailing from the tiny town of Woodlake,
Calif., Renteria said most of her family and
friends thought she was crazy even to come
to a school like Stanford. They really thought
she had lost it when she decided to try out for
the Cardinal's basketball team in fall 1992
a team that returned all five starters from
its national-title campaign the year before.
"My goal since I was little was to play col
lege ball," Renteria said "It wasn't a matter
of 'Can I?' or 'Will I?' but '1 need to try.'
Regardless of what kind of standing they had
at the timn, I believe if I put my mind to
something and if I m really persistent at
something it can happen. I saw it as an
opportunity vs. a challenge, and if I didn't

take the opportunity, that was something I
was missing out on."
Renteria made the team and after her sec
ond year of basketball joined the upstart soft
hall program in midseason. She scored 12
runs in just 14 games that year and found a
permanent place on the diamond, earning a
scholarship and All-Pacific 10 Conference
honorable mention in her second season.
"It was a developing program, and I there
were| financial reasons," Renteria said. "And
that goes back to one of my goals to earn a
scholarship to Stanford. In order to do that,
it was with softball at the time. Also, I missed
the sport. 1 love softball, and when you're not
doing it, you realize how much you miss it."
So basketball was put on the back burner,
and Renteria pursued a successful softball
career and a double major in political science
and economics. But she never completely
abandoned basketball and continued to play
pickup and intramurals. When her softball
career ended three weeks ago, Renteria
decided to take advantage of the growing
opportunities in women's sports and try out
for the Star/./.
"It was another opportunity," Renteria
said. "And if I didn't take it, I'd be selling
myself short. I don't think that many
women my age get the opportunities that
I've been given. I would consider it an
opportunity to have the ability to try out, to

hot corner.
have the option to try out, to be
able to challenge yourself at a
new level. It hasn't always been
the case that women can try out
for a professional team in the
United States."
The tryout was a two-day
affair with 150 players vying for
seven spots on the incomplete
Starzz roster. Renteria's prepara
tion was limited due to softball,
but after just two days of practice,

she made a lasting impression.
She wasn't selected to fill one of
the seven open spots on the team
but was placed on a list of an addi
tional 15 players for future
options.
But for Renteria, the tryout
was a success because she took
advantage of the opportunity. If
she hadn't tried, she pointed out,
she "definitely would have
failed."
"Being there, I realized that
my generation [of women] is on
the verge of making it," Renteria
said. "When I was little, we used
to watch the NBA, and we're

going to be there some day. I
think it's amazing to be on the
brink of that and to be able to
watch it as it passes right in front
of you.
"That became extremely
apparent just seeing all the
women out there trying to accom
plish their dream. It was some
thing all of us talked about, and it
was something we never imag
ined we'd be doing. At that point,
it's not even whether you make it
or not. It's more that in some way
you're a part of this new level of
basketball, this new level of
women's athletics."

Starzz head coach Denise Tay
lor agreed with Renteria about
the opportunities in women's
sports and said she was pleased
with the level of talent at the try
outs.
"I think it went really well,"
Taylor said. "It's like a dream. To
not come would be like missing
out on a dream you've always
hoped for. Just the opportunity to
try out is exciting, and for some
people it'll be an opportunity to
play."
Renteria's collegiate career
may be over, and her professional
career was perhaps short-lived,

but she hopes always to be
involved in sports in some fash
ion. After graduation, she'll start
her new job and pursue opportu
nities outside the sports world.
But she'll take the experiences
and knowledge her pursuits at
Stanford have given her into
whatever arena she enters.
"I think with everything it's an
opportunity," Renteria said.
"Whether I was trying out for the
[Stanford] basketball team,
whether we're playing No. 2
UCLA in softball or whether its
going to try out for the Utah
Starzz, I think it's all the same

feeling â€” having the adrenaline,
going against all odds.
"I don't think there's a better
feeling than really believing in
everything you have. I wouldn't
be where I'm at now if it weren't
for those times I took the chal
lenge or the opportunity. I think
it's the same excitement I get
every single time I try something
new. I have so many opportuni
ties that other people don't have,
and if I don't take advantage of
it that's selling myself short.
And I guess in doing that it's led
me to more successes than fail
ures."
