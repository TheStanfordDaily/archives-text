# You too can find love!

You've heard of Masters and Johnson.
You've even heard of Timmy and Lassie,
and Psych and Zimbardo. But the two
greatest social scientists of our time are
actually Bambi Fischer, Ph.D., and Susanah
Hateman, M.D., two people who currently
are visiting Stanford and will leave on the
next bus. On their way from the CoHo to
the station, they've conducted a revolu
tionary study that reveals some shocking
facts about dating at Stanford. They've
also found a great recipe for strawberry
marmelade. But first, their surprising
results regarding love, sex and Stanford!

WHERE PEOPLE MEET

WHAT MEN LOOK FOR

YOUR LEVEL OF ATTRACTIVENESS
One shocking discovery they've made is that your chances of getting a date do
not depend on your astrological sign, as has commonly been believed in the past.
No. In fact, your chances of landing some tonight actually depends on two fac
tors: your level of attractiveness and your expectations. This means that if
you're hot and willing to fool around with some ugly, cheap loser nobody else
wants, you're pretty much guaranteed a date! On the other hand, if your level of
attractiveness is low and your expectations are high, well, you'll be alone. Sad,
but true.
DATING HABITS

Shocking, isn't it? Well, things get even more scary next week, when Dr.
Clarissa Larynge investigates the use of squirrel parts in the making of food
at Lagunita. Until then, good luck finding a mate.
