Three legal suits have been filed in the wake
of the resignation of Dr. Robert Stebbins from
the Medical Center's medical staff and voluntaiy
clinical faculty May 12.
Stebbins, who has been an oncologist in pri
vate practice in Palo Alto for the past two
decades, relinquished his right to admit patients
to the hospital and to do voluntary part-time
teaching at the hospital amid allegations of sexu
al misconduct.

Stebbins has been charged with two counts of
violation of Business and Professional Code Sec
tion 729 for engaging in sexual conduct with pa
tients. The maximum punishment for this
felony includes a three-year prison term and a
$10,000 fine.
Stebbins turned himself in to the Palo Alto
Police Department on Tuesday after a warrant
was issued last week. He is currently out on his
own recognizance, having agreed to appear for
his arraignment in Palo Alto Municipal Court
June 26.

care. It is also a matter of state law, so it is not
something we could or would take lightly," said
Laurie Vaughan, associate director of the Med
