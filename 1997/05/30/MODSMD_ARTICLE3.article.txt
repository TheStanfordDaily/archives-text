# Oncologist faces sexual misconduct charges
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Staff writer 
Three legal suits have been filed in the wake
of the resignation of Dr. Robert Stebbins from
the Medical Center's medical staff and voluntaiy
clinical faculty May 12.
Stebbins, who has been an oncologist in pri
vate practice in Palo Alto for the past two
decades, relinquished his right to admit patients
to the hospital and to do voluntary part-time
teaching at the hospital amid allegations of sexu
al misconduct.

Stebbins has been charged with two counts of
violation of Business and Professional Code Sec
tion 729 for engaging in sexual conduct with pa
tients. The maximum punishment for this
felony includes a three-year prison term and a
$10,000 fine.
Stebbins turned himself in to the Palo Alto
Police Department on Tuesday after a warrant
was issued last week. He is currently out on his
own recognizance, having agreed to appear for
his arraignment in Palo Alto Municipal Court
June 26.
"Stanford takes these kinds of allegations ex

tremely seriously, as our most important mis
sion is to protect patients and ensure quality
care. It is also a matter of state law, so it is not
something we could or would take lightly," said
Laurie Vaughan, associate director of the Med
ical Center's Office of Communications.
Stanford Hospital Chief of Staff Lawrence
Shuer said news of these accusations came as "a
shock" to the hospital community.
However, both Vaughan and Shuer empha
sized Stebbins' relatively tangential relationship
to the University.
"He was neither an employee of
Stanford Hospital nor of the Med
ical School," said Vaughan.
"I don't believe he taught cours
es at the Medical School or that he
had students doing research with
him," Shuer added.
Both explained that in his role as
voluntary clinical faculty, Stebbins
would occasionally have had resi
dents or medical students accompa
nying him on his hospital rounds.
Although Stebbins has only
been charged with two counts,
there have been other alleged inci
dents.
A civil case against Stebbins was
filed Wednesday by several of Steb
bins' former patients and their
112 amily members.
According to Attorney John
Winer, who is representing two of
the patients and the husband of a
third, Stebbins has been having
"relationships" with patients peri
odically over the past three years.
Winer said that one of the rela
tionships lasted for two years and
another for six months. He added
that Stebbins allegedly became vi
olent with at least one of the
women.

"He would threaten them,
telling them that he had a gun and
that he wasn't afraid to use it,"
Winer alleged.
Winer continued, saying that
"Stebbins treated one of my clients
and her dying daughter. When she
tried to end the relationship, he al
legedly threatened to withhold
treatment from her daughter. He
also (allegedly) began a sexual rela
tionship with a dying patient's wife."
Winer said his clients have filed
a suit to receive monetary compen
sation for the injuries Stebbins has
caused them and to make an ex
ample of the physician.
"My clients need hundreds of
thousands of dollars to cover the
cost of future psychotherapy,"
Winer said.
Stebbins also faces having his
medical license revoked by the Cal
ifornia Medical Board.
"I've known Dr. Stebbins for 13
years, and he's a decent man and a
superb doctor. I believe his conduct
was not criminal," Stebbins' attor
ney, Doron Weinberg, told the San
Jose Mercury News last week.
Detective Jim Coffman of the
Palo Alto Police Department em
phasized that "there are no win
ners here," commenting on how
difficult it was for the women to
come forward with the charges
and the possible impact on Steb
bins' professional reputation.
