Points:
0-20 - It's unlikely that you'll ever get a date in your
life. You'll end up a bitter, resentful person and even
tually lead a minor slave revolt in Haiti.
20-40 - You have good scoring skills, but you still need
to work at it. It also might help if you started wearing
deodorant and showering occasionally.
40-60 - You're very good, and you probably do get a
date once in a while. But once in a while is not
enough, is it? I suggest working harder at it and not
be afraid of crying in public in order to get what you
want.
60-80 - You really are quite skilled at the dating game.
You don't need any aavice from me; you're probably
in a relationship already. Heck, you're probably in
several relationships right now. Lucky you. (Although
beware of the barking dog who scratches in the night;
your luck may change drastically.)
