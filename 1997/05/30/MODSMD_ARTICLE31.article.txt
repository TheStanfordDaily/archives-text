# THE 						SECRET DIARIES OF AIMEE THANATOGENOS!
## 'My life as a math equation!' 
### 
Sometimes Aimer wakes up screaming in the
middle of the night in fear that someone,
somewhere, is having a hotter time than she
is. Its enough to send her running to the nearest
sushi har to stuff herself with some California
rolls. Aimee gets vers touchy on the whole
"enjoyment of life' issue I cringe at those beer
commercials shot in exotic locales, lor one thing.
Also. I spend most of my tune sending hate mail
to celehrit tes who look happy in paparazzi photos
But Aimee has had a had time lately. For one
tiling, she drew into Wilhur; her hest friend
Moira drew into Boh. \lso. her hest friend, (iahe
Stenophalus. just got a high-paying job in DC
giving massages to loeal tropin wives Well. I'm
not jealous or anything After all. I do have a
great joh at I he l)ail\ and make hig hucks on the
side selling alcohol to undiT ige kids from Pal>
High But still, it's not enough that Aimee suc
ceed-. her friends must fail, too In Aimee's ideal
world, everyone'-; unhappv and Aimee listens to
their troubles lot the entertainment value. Of
course, \iniee wasn't alwa\ s t his wav I 'here was

a time when she was kind, generous, and gentle
to the touch. Then she turned 4. and there was no
looking hack.
The only thing that keeps me going these
days is that wonder called e-mail E-mail is my
life. Everything that happens in between the
times 1 check my messages is just filler. Further
more. there are only two states of being: expecta
tion for the next time you'll check e-mail and the
act of e-mailing itself Meaning lies in getting
good messages. These include personal notes of
congratulations or news that you have won either
a> money or h> more money A personal message
from Green saying you have an overdue book
does not count as a good message If all the e-mail
you get is either junk mail or hate mail, then your
life has no meaning. You might as well close your
account and go hack to a life of alcoholism.
One reason Aimee is so bitter and resentful is
because next year she won't he the only celebrity
on campus Yes, believe it or not. I am a celebrity
here. People often recognize me from my mug
shots and stop me. Usually they either hit me or

punch mi' on the stomach and call me a depraved
maniac, hut sometimes they're very nice tit me
and offer to find me psychiatric help. .Just the
other day this very sweet f'rosh from Alondra
offered me a strait-jacket and a year's subscrip
tion to Perversions Illustrated, hut I had to
decline because I never accept gifts from
strangers, unless it's got a designer label or
makes funny noises when I sit on it.
But yes, next year Aimee will have to share
the spotlight with Chelsea and that fake red-head
Tabitha Soren. We all know that's not her real
name. Who other than a witch named Samantha
would name her child Tabitha? Yes. Tabitha is a
star at MTV. but 1. too. was associated with that
station. For a long time I worked as laundry
woman in the basement of the building. I
scrubbed and cleaned the suits that I'abitha wore
and never a word of thanks!
But enough of this resentment, bitterness,
and self-hatred. I'm joining a convent. Kxcuse me
while I drink mvself to death

A candid moment of sweetness between Aimee and her
dad, Louis Thanatogenos. Aimee's father eventually
stnnnpfi tnurhina hpr iffpr a sexual harassment suit.
