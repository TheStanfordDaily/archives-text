About 200 students rallied
yesterday against what they saw
as attacks on academic freedom
and scholastic diversity at the
University.
The protest came after the re
cent denial of Asst. Anthropology
Prof. Akhil Gupta's appeal for
tenure. Gupta received his second
rejection notice from the Office of
the Dean of the School of 1 lumani
ties and Sciences last Friday.
Students started their protest in
front of Dean John Shoven's of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
office at noon with a speech by An

thropology Prof. George Collier,
who represented the department
and called for more departmental
autonomy in tenure decisions.
The rally then moved to the Fac
ulty Club, where the group thought
Shoven would be having lunch.
"We don't know if we got
through to them," said junior Aly
Remtulla, a spokesperson for the
student group Undergraduates for
the Tenure of Akhil Gupta. "They
closed the gates on us."
Gupta is now taking his appeal
to the Provost's Office. According
to Senior Assoc. Provost Kathryn
Gillam, the review process will

start when the office receives
Gupta's official appeal. Provost
Condoleezza Rice is expected to
hand down the final decision by
June 15.
The student group, which said
there Ls a pattern of mismanage
ment and intervention in depart
mental affairs by the dean's office,
protested "the disconcerting corre
lation between the [tenure] denials
and the gender and ethnicity of the
scholars in question." They focused
the rally on the two recent denials of
Gupta and Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak, who was rejected
at the dean's level last month.
"We are doing this right now be
cause we want [Rice] to look at
[Gupta's appeal] fairly," Remtulla
said.
Commenting that "fair and dis
tinguished faculty" have been in

volved in the Gupta decision,
Shoven said it was unbiased.
"I recognize the strong support
Sawislak and Gupta have," he said.
"I appreciate that. The only thing I
find troubling is that people are
quick to see bias where there is
none."
Shoven added, "Our process is
fair and impartial."
The rally was sponsored by
groups such as MEChA, the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center, the Women's Center and
the Black Student Union.
Commenting that Sawislak is a
labor historian and Gupta an inter
pretive anthropologist — two acad
emic fields "not held to be impor
tant" — Remtulla said the tenure
granting process "seems like a big
backlash against this kind of schol
arship, strongly related to sex, eth
nicity and national origin.
"A lot of minorities and women
are involved in this kind of scholar
ship," he said. "It's an issue for
everyone."
