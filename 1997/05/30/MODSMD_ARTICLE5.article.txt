# Tenure reform a goal

Provost Condoleezza Rice spent
much of yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting presenting a report on ap
pointments and promotions and
outlining the 1997-98 University
budget.
The Provost's ad hoc Committee
on Promotions and Appointments
Procedures presented a report that
recommended numerous changes
in how faculty are appointed and

The $ 1.4 billion budget was char

"long, yellow form" — now filled out
by candidates for a variety of hiring,

This was a recommendation Rice
endorsed.
She also approved an idea to
change the process for promoting
those faculty in the Medical School
whose research is principally clini
cal. Such faculty, called Medical
Center line faculty, will no longer
have promotions reviewed by the
full faculty Advisory Board, as regu

subgroup of that board.
The report said the changes were
due to "a lack of clarity as to the cri

line are to be evaluated," given the
fact that their research takes place
in a clinical setting, and a "percep

awry."
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron, who
chairs the Advisory Board, admitted
