# Tenure reform a goal
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice spent
much of yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting presenting a report on ap
pointments and promotions and
outlining the 1997-98 University
budget.
The Provost's ad hoc Committee
on Promotions and Appointments
Procedures presented a report that
recommended numerous changes
in how faculty are appointed and
promoted, notably clinical faculty at
the Medical School.
The $ 1.4 billion budget was char
acterized by Rice as "essentially
good news" and includes no cuts of
the sort carried out two and three
years ago.
Appointments and promotions
Rice said the committee she ap
pointed to look into how the ca
reers of Stanford faculty begin and
progress was formed in response to
a variety of criticisms of the
process from administrators and
faculty.
The committee's report listed
several of those criticisms, many of
which argued the process was too
longand drawn-out. The committee
came up with a series of procedural

reforms, most of which were ap
proved by Rice and will be promul
gated through the President's Of
fice.
One important change is that the
"long, yellow form" — now filled out
by candidates for a variety of hiring,
promotion and tenure functions —
will be replaced by a series of differ
ent forms for different situations.
This was a recommendation Rice
endorsed.
She also approved an idea to
change the process for promoting
those faculty in the Medical School
whose research is principally clini
cal. Such faculty, called Medical
Center line faculty, will no longer
have promotions reviewed by the
full faculty Advisory Board, as regu
lar tenure-line faculty do, but by a
subgroup of that board.
The report said the changes were
due to "a lack of clarity as to the cri
teria against which faculty in this
line are to be evaluated," given the
fact that their research takes place
in a clinical setting, and a "percep
tion that the process has gone
awry."
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron, who
chairs the Advisory Board, admitted
the change — which the board en
dorsed — was "something of a sur
render" after substantial efforts had
been made to accommodate Medical
Center line faculty into the regular
process.
Another mqjor recommendation
was to increase the amount of feed
back candidates receive after a deci
sion in a non-tenure promotion or
reappointment.
Rice noted this would be especial
ly important for junior faculty at the
various stages before a tenure appli
cation, so they will be able to address
early on any concerns that might
later interfere with a tenure applica
tion.
History Department Chair Nor
man Naimark commented that the
process was still long and cumber
some and had too many levels. He
said he hoped the committee's rec
ommendations would not mark
the end of attempts to find a solu
tion.
"There's got to be something bet
ter out there," Naimark said.
Rice said such delays and compli
cations generally take place before
applications reached her office mid
that when her office takes extra
time, it is either because of proce
dural errors earlier in the process or

because it is a complicated case
where they needed to collect extra
information.
In these circumstances, Rice said
"expediting the case would mean
turning down the case."
Budget
The provost's budget presenta
tion contained few surprises. The
$1.4 billion budget showed a surplus
of $89 million, but Rice stressed that
this was in very restricted funds.
"I want to assure you, there is no
money to spend there," she said.
The budget figures include a plan
to increase the return on the endow
ment by half a percentage point,
with the money to go toward infra
structure.
Rice said there is ongoing uncer
tainty about government research
support but that a reserve built up
over the past few years has allowed
the budget to absorb a recent change
in funding for graduate tuition re
mission that cost Stanford $7 mil
lion.
1 lowever, Rice said, "we are now
in a position to make some key in
vestments in the academic pro
gram."
She cited Stanford Introductory
Studies as an example of an invest
ment already in place and said she
was open to suggestions about areas
in which extra investment might
bring substantial academic gains.

The budget assumes a continua
tion of need-blind admissions, a pol
icy that received much praise but
also some questions from faculty as
to the wisdom of the policy's lack of
merit scholarships.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid James Mon
toya said Stanford had shown a
steady ability to attract middle-in
come students of the sort who wou Id
be most likely to be deterred by a
lack of merit scholarships and that
recent increases in the number of
admitted students choosing Stan
ford have not been biased toward
any income segment.
Other business
The senate heard a third report
dealing with the new draft Comput
er and Network Usage Policy.
The policy seeks to clarify what
current University policies and
practices on intellectual property
and privacy mean in the context of
using University-owned computers.
The policy will not apply to dorm
clusters, where usage policies come
from the Office of Residential Edu
cation.
Rice also announced that Assoc.
Psychology Prof. Ann Fernald will
be joining her office as vice provost
for faculty development. Her re
sponsibilities will include providing
support for new faculty, junior fac
ulty and department heads.
