### Katie Chang 
The selection committee in charge of the re
gional search for next year's part-time
Women's Center director will announce it?
final decision by June 15 after a series of up
coming community meetings.
The four final candidates, Fabienne
McPhail, Madhuri Mathema-Kilpatrick, An
gela Dolittle and Susannah MacKaye, will fin
ish interviews next week.
The Women's Center is now able to hire a
professional director due to additional Univer
sity funding it was given last year. For the past
15 years, the center has been led by graduate
interns.

"I think it is important that the Women's
Center create an active, affirming community
that seeks to celebrate diversity," said Anne-
Marie Nunez, a graduate student intern who
currently serves as director of the center. "I
think (the new director] should have the abili
ty to help the center educate the community
about gender issues and promote the causes of
women."
The selection committee — consisting pri
marily of students and members of the Office
of Student Activities — narrowed the original
pool of candidates from 125 to five.
The committee looked for candidates who
voiced a vision for the center that matched the
one the student staff had vocalized throughout

the year.
Mathema-Kilpatrick, an alumna with u doc
torate in women's studies, excited about the
Women's Center. "I don't have definite ideas
about the center because I want students to
come in with issues that are important to them
instead of me imposing ideas on them. I want to
make sure that it is the students' center, not
my center," she said.
Nanci I lowe, adviser to the center and direc
tor of the Office of Student Affairs, said the
center feels that expansion of the director role
is important to its progress.
"Most importantly, the director should pro-
vide continuity and stability for
the center from year to year,"
Howe said.
Next year, the center wants to
build on existing programs such as
the faculty brown bag lunch series
and panels during which students

can discuss their research proposals.
Candidates are interviewed by
Howe, Dean of Students Marc
Wais and the center's student
staff, among others. Open forums
will be held for each candidate, and
student views on the candidates
will be taken into consideration.
Students and administrators
involved with the center ex
pressed excitement about the can
didates and the prospect of having

the first professional Women's
Center director.
"I think it has been a really in
teresting process with a lot of real
ly great candidates," said Troy
Gilbert, assistant director of stu
dent activities and a member of
the selection committee. "I think
it is very interesting to imagine a
Women's Center with profession
al leadership that it hasn't had be
fore."
