## With 11-4 win, Card advances in College World Series 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — So what if he's not a starter?
Sophomore Jeff Austin, the long reliever who's
doing the bulk of the pitching for the Cardinal dur
ing the College World Series, turned in another
valiant effort yesterday, leading the team to a 11-4
victory in Stanford's third College World Series
game to keep its championship hopes alive.
Stanford (45-19), facing the Auburn Tigers (50-
17) for the second time in the tournament, had to
win to avoid elimination. Austin (5-2) made sure

the Cardinal did, shutting down the Auburn of
fense for the last six innings.
Austin's impressive pitching yesterday called to
mind his outing in Stanford's World Series opener,
when he took over for starter Chad Hutchinson
and pitched the final four innings of the Cardinal's
8-3 victory, giving up just two hits and no runs
while striking out five.
This time, Austin took over from struggling
sophomore starter Brent Hoard in the bottom of
the third and pitched the final 6 1/3 innings, giving

up no earned runs and six hits.
Austin "did a great job," said
Auburn right fielder Adam Sulli
van. "Once you see a guy one time,
you should do better against him.
But he was too much for us. He
pitched his butt off."
Austin modestly talked off the
victory.
"I was fortunate on the first day
to come out and have really good
stuff," he said. "But today I wasn't
as sharp. I worked on hitting my
spots and letting the defense play
behind me."
Stanford's offense, on the other
hand, had been running at less
than full speed. Coming into the
game, the top four in the Cardinal
batting order were hitting just .172
in the College World Series while
the bottom five were batting .378
— so Marquess juggled the lineup.
"I felt like we needed a change,"
Marquess said. "And hitting is

contagious. Once one guy starts
hitting, everyone relaxes a little
and loosens up."
Senior first baseman Luke
Quaccia said the result was "a real
breakout day for us. We hit some
extra-base hits, which really get
runs on the board a lot faster."
The Cardinal's newly revamped
offense jumped out in front quick
ly, scoring one when sophomore
third baseman Josh Hochgesang
grounded in junior outfielder and
leadoff hitter Joe Kilburg. Quaccia
followed with a two-run blast over
the left-center field fence.
But Stanford was overtaken in
the bottom of the third when a la
boring Hoard, after getting the
first two outs on fly balls, gave up a
double in the left-field corner to
Auburn second baseman Rob
Macrory.
Hoard lost his cool. After walk
ing first baseman Jamie Kersh on
four pitches, his second offering to
Auburn's Josh Etheredge nicked
the first baseman's arm, sending
him to first and loading the bases.
Then he walked third baseman

Chad Wandall on a 3-2 pitch to
bring in a run, keeping three men
on for Auburn center fielder Tim
Hudson. Hudson had entered the
game batting .399 with 18 home
runs and 93 RBIs.
Hoard didn't face the Tigers'
menacing slugger as Marquess
elected to bring in Austin. But
Austin gave up two straight singles
for three runs, and the Tigers took
the lead 4-3. Those were the last
runs the Tigers scored.
Stanford tied the game in the
fourth on a single up the middle by
junior shortstop Jay Pecci that
brought in junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer for the Cardinal's fourth
run.
Stanford scored four more in
the sixth with a rash of hits, an
other in the seventh via a homer to
right by sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut and two more in the
ninth on three singles.
With the win, Stanford earned
another day of life. The team plays
today at 4:30 p.m. PDT against
Louisiana State (55-13) in the next
step toward Saturday's champi

onship. Stanford must beat LSU
today and Friday to reach the final
game.
