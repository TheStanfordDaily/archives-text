## Editor's farewell A 						time it was, it was 
### 
THE FOUR MONTHS that
represent the pinnacle of my
Stanford career came to a
close last night as I put the final
touches on this piece — the four
months that I have determined,
despite searching far back in my
memory, have been the best time
of my life.
It's hard for me to identify what
exactly I liked so much about
being editor in chief. But no mat
ter what answer I come up with, it
always has something to do with
the people: the people I talked to,
the people I helped, the people I
learned to understand.
Leading up to this position, I
spent more than two years at The
Daily writing and editing various
sections. The noticeable change in
moving into the editor's chair was
that it allowed me to meet a dif
ferent set of people in a different
set of circumstances than existed
for me as a writer.
As a writer, you interview people
for a specific purpose. You plan
when you are going to talk to them
and what you are going to say. You
know, after a while, the general
course an interview takes, and
there aren't many surprises.
But you can't plan for the peo
ple you meet as editor in chief. You
never know what word or phrase
or graphic in yesterday's paper will
cause tomorrow's uproar. You
don't know who will show up in
the afternoon demanding a correc
tion or threatening to sue for libel.
And while I'm not sure which I
prefer — getting to run this whole
ship or concentrating on my own
little piece of it — serving as editor
in chief has offered me more than
one unexpected challenge.
The element of the unknown
makes this job harder, but more
fulfilling, than anything else I've
ever done. It exhausts me at the
end of every day, but it gets me up
again every morning.
That's something I wasn't sure
1 would ever find as an editor. I've
spent the majority of my time at
The Daily in a managerial posi
tion, most of that as news editor or
managing editor.

Until Feb. 1, I saw editing as an
inevitability but not something I
anticipated eagerly. I had been suc
cessful as a writer, so there was no
question I would move on to edit
ing. Managing, I knew, would be
necessary experience for someone
like me who planned a career in
journalism. I also, like most Stan
ford students, am a leader and not
a follower; moving up The Daily's
ladder was natural.
Working in such capacities for
the past three years, I have never
regretted the long hours I put in at
The Daily. I have never felt like it
was a waste. But I never, until now,
thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
I've liked it so much because it
has been my most intense learn
ing experience. And although
what I've learned is far from
shocking or profound, it was
taught to me in the most effective
way — I lived through it.
What I take back with me as I
return to writing is a deeper under
standing of the way people act. I've
observed people working together,
people fighting by themselves and
people blinded by anger. More
closely, I've watched myself in each
of these roles, and I've developed a
deeper understanding of who I am.
Really, there's not much more I
could ask for in an experience. To
learn about yourself and the peo
ple around you while doing some
thing you love with similarly moti
vated colleagues is not an opportu
nity that shows its face often.
I got the chance. And maybe
that's enough of an explanation of
why I liked it so much.
