## To never say never again 
### 
SO IT'S 11 days until graduation,
and I'm starting to feel like it's
about time to cut the cord and bust
on out of here. Stanford wasn't a bad
place to gestate, really; it didn't smoke,
fed me nutritional and not entirely
untasty food and kept me safe from the
big, bad world outside. But it's getting a
bit warm in here — a sort of fetid,
armpit-y kind of warm — and I'm rest
less. I can't seem to keep from screaming,
wiggling and kicking, trying to stir up
some action in here all by myself.
In all this hectic, end-of-Stanford
madness, I haven't had much of a chance
to really think about the various ways
that Stanford has coddled me, fed me
and formed me. Looking back, I think
I've learned some things. I've learned
that eating coffee grounds and Sweet
Tarts to stay awake can have an adverse
effect on your digestion. I've learned the
differences between vegans and vegetar
ians. I've learned that the words "hege
mony," "marginal" and "juridico-politi
cal" should be liberally applied to any lit
erary, cultural or historical analysis.
And I've learned that palm trees don't
necessarily equal warmth.
My Stanford experience was Purity
Tests and California Bowls, happy hours
and English seminars, Lambda Nu and
Lifskada. It was incredible times spent
with Max, Diana, Jen, Liz, Emily, Erin,
Patrick, Clifton, Zanja, Jon, Brad,
Rahul, Toma, Steph, Melissa, Steve,

Colleen, Amelia, Monica, Moi, Blythe
and many more intelligent and truly
kick-ass people than I can name. It was
feeling at home in the Women's Center,
having picnics at Half Moon Bay, playing
spades at the Coffee House and going to
parties in the City.
It was also "I Never" games. The
more I think about it, nothing sums up
my Stanford experience better than "I
Never." I know it sounds weird to say
that a dumb, high-schoolish drinking
game sums up my entire college experi
ence, but in a way it's true. In case
you've been trapped in a test tube some
where and don't know what I'm talking
about, let me explain: "I Never" is a
drinking game that basically involves
admitting incriminating or embarrass
ing things to a group of people. Each
time someone admits something you've
also done, you drink.
I first played "I Never" at my frosh
year ski trip. Naive and innocent 18-year
old that I was, I was in awe of my frosh
resident assistants, who admitted to
doing everything from skinny-dipping in
Lake Lag to dropping acid. In hindsight,
I can see that these accomplishments
were something less than radical. But at
the time they were kind of inspiring.
Some little part of me resolved, at that
moment, to dive headlong into college. I
wanted to try everything — well, almost
everything. I wanted to root out every
nook and cranny of every possible Stan

ford experience. I wanted to drive my IQ
score up and my purity score down.
So maybe I'm exaggerating a little
about the"I Never" thing. I did have
higher ambitions than to systematically
and nerdily apprentice myself to these
vague forms of college debauchery. Still,
systematic or not, I have of late noticed
that I get drunker faster during "I
Never" games. And I have managed to do
a lot of things I had never done before I
got to Stanford. Before Stanford, I never
did a tequila shot, I never pulled multi
ple, consecutive all-nighters, and I never
demonstrated putting a condom on a
banana in public. I never read Flaubert,
Foucault or Freud. I never petitioned or
demonstrated for a political cause. I
never shared a room with another per
son. AH those experiences, in my dorm, in
class, in the Women's Center, were a
huge, amazing learning experience that I
could never replace.
But like I said, lately it has started to
get kind of limited. I feel like I've
exhausted the possibilities of Stanford
for now. I'm antsy. Sure it's painful, but
my four years are over, and it's high time
to squeeze my way out.
