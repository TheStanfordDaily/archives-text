Pending Stanford-UCSF merger shrouded in secrecy

STARTING WITH HIS inaugural
address, University President Ger
hard Casper has repeatedly paid
homage to the University's German
motto, "Die Luft der Freiheit wcht,"
"The wind of freedom blows."
Yet no Stanford president in modern
times has adopted a tighter practice of
communications command and control.
This top-down, corporate style has been
especially apparent in the pending merg
er of the UC-San Francisco and Stanford
Health Services, which may involve as
much as $1 billion.
From the outset, Casper and the
Stanford Board of Trustees explicitly
ruled out any faculty participation in the
basic decision.
This action ignores a 1988 agreement
with the Faculty Senate Steering Com
mittee that the senate "should be
informed during the early stages of con
sideration of any academically related
joint venture that is thought to be a fea
sible proposal for development."
Prior senate discussions indicated
that "joint ownership ventures have
serious potential for influencing faculty
appointments as well as teaching and
research programs."
Casper initially argued that the UCSF
merger would have little or no academic
impact because it did not include the
medical schools. Yet subsequent public
reports have said the merger could lead
to "coordinating departments and faculty
chair recruitment packages, sharing in
program investments and coordinated
teaching programs."
In February, Casper went a step fur
ther, saying he was "not sure" that
future medical faculty appointments
should be subject to review by the Advi
sory Board, a University-wide elected fac
ulty group. "We have to become more

functional in our thinking about the
intensity of the University's involvement
in Medical School affairs. We have to per
mit the Medical School some greater lee
way than it has now." In the past nine
years, clinical faculty have increased by
49 percent at Stanford.
Secrecy has been a sine qua non of the
merger process. In a letter leaked to the
press from UCSF sources last fall,
Casper threatened to pull out of the
merger unless the new corporation could
conduct its business behind closed doors.
In a recent joint statement with UC
President Richard Atkinson and Peter
Van Etten, CEO of UCSF / Stanford
I lealth Care, Casper backed off a bit. He
said failure to preserve secrecy would
make the merger "questionable."
University lobbyists are working hard
in Sacramento to keep the doors closed,
with little outcry from journalists.
Newsletters cranked out by adminis
trators of UCSF / Stanford Health Care
have cautioned employees to beware of
any news coverage critical of the merger.
Nonetheless, a four-page New Eng
land Journal of Medicine article on
"The Folly of Academic Hospital Merg
ers" by Spyros Andreopoulos, emeritus
director of communication at Stanford
Medical Center, has spread like samiz
dat in the former USSR.
"By placing their hospitals under a
separate, independent corporate umbrel
la, Stanford and UCSF have relinquished
their control of education and clinical
research," Andreopoulos observes.
"Management structures that tie the
hospital, medical school and university
together more closely than before may
improve operations. Johns Hopkins did
just that recently by merging its medical
school with its hospital.
"If academic centers want to stop

competing with one another and to coop
erate on patient care and research, they
can exchange letters of understanding.
Collaboration can already be seen in
research on AIDS, heart disease and can
cer," he said. Stanford and UCSF have
many such collaborations. They are a far
less bureaucratic, more flexible approach
In their relentless, one-sided effort to
tout unspecified savings and create the
impression of a "done deal," Stanford
and UCSF officials have ignored their
own history:
In 1913, when Stanford's hospital
and medical school were located in San
Francisco, a strikingly similar proposed
merger with UC failed on the issue of
transferring public assets to a private
institution.
In 1959, when Stanford Hospital
moved south and merged with Palo Alto
Hospital, the public-private division
proved unworkable. The University
bought out the city's interest.
More recently, UCSF lost $29 million
when it merged with Mt. Zion Hospital.
And the merger of Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital with Stan
ford Hospital and the purchase of three
private group practices have done little
to boost occupancy rates.
An independent review of the pro
posed merger, commissioned by the UC
Regents last fall, found that Stanford
realized $46 million in operating profits
from 1991 to 1996 while UCSF lost $42
million. Those figures have been kept
quiet at Stanford.
So have the bottom line provisions of
the merger agreement. After the first
year, there's no guarantee the medical
schools would receive their previous level
of financial support from UCSF / Stan
ford Health Care, the UC report noted.
If this support proved "unsatisfacto-

ry" or the merger resulted in "extraordi
nary losses," the merger could legally be
dissolved. But this would be "difficult to
implement in practice after the passage
of only a short period of time," the report
added. "Too much will have changed."
Faculty will be expected to seek out
side financial support from government
or corporations for research. The days
of "unfunded" research covered directly
by the Medical Center itself are over,
Van Etten said.
Having successfully kept the Stan
ford faculty at bay and in the dark,
reporting mainly ex post facto, the Uni
versity administration is now trying to
enlist their support in working out the
merger's details. If it succeeds, officials
will take the credit; if not, the faculty
will get the blame.
On several occasions, Casper has
warned privately that if the UCSF merg
er fails, Stanford may be forced to turn
to Columbia / HCA â€” the nation's
largest for-profit hospital chain and the
target of repeated exposes bv The New
England Journal of Medicine. The Wall
Street Journal and "60 Minutes."
Faculty at UCSF have speculated that
the merger may actually be an interme
diate step toward that end.
Columbia administrators have
expressed amazement at the deliberate
exclusion of faculty from the initial
merger discussions by Stanford and
UCSF. Top practitioners are usually
Columbia's first target in a takeover.
Whatever the outcome, Stanford's
sustained failure to be candid with its
faculty and other key audiences on all
facets of the merger may cost it dearly
in the long run.
