# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## A 						eulogy to my alma mater; or, me and my lady 
### 
The following should be read aloud over
the melancholy sounds of a church organ.
It is advisable to keep a box of Kleenex
handy.
AHHH, IT IS good to see so many
familiar faces. We all know why we
are here: To bid a final, fond farewell
to a university we've all known well and
loved, for better or for worse. Together,
we've hurried down her hallowed halls and
biked through her plush gardens, and I
believe that I must say my piece before I let
her move with grace and solitude to her
final resting place (sniff, sniff).
I first met Stanford just more than
four years ago during what she used to
affectionately call "Pro Fro Week." I
wish I could tell you that it was her ded
ication to excellence that drew me into
her gentle arms, but it wasn't. I wish I
could tell you that it was her academic
splendor that made me look at her that
all-too-important second time. But that
wasn't it either. It was her body, plain
and simple. It was the way she looked
that made me follow her across the Great

Plains, over the Rockies and through the
woods — for she was beautiful. Palm
trees, sunshine, a lake of sorts, a yuppie
town "just a bike ride away."
It was love at first sight. Not a Romeo
and-Juliet-bipolar-stack-of-dead-bodies
type of love but more like that deep crush
kind of love you got in sixth grade when
Shirley Goldhaber — who had been devel
oping a little faster than the rest of the
girls — sat next to you at lunch and "acci
dentally" knocked over your pint of milk
with her left breast. (More organ music.)
Ahhh, Stanford. (Sniff, sniff.) As I
approached her for a second time that
September, she already knew my name.
In fact, she screamed it at the top of her
lungs as I approached her timidly. That's
the kind of thing a man doesn't forget.
Those first few months Stanford was
very good to me. I made a fool of myself in
front of the entire campus in Big Game
Gaieties. I stayed up all night talking
with new friends in Wilbur hallways. My
resident assistant taught me how to
drink and dance at the same time (which
was harder than I thought it would be).

Of course, like every romance, this was
just the honeymoon period — back in
those days when I went to Flicks every
week, knew virtually every bit of the dol
lies' choreography to "All Right Now"
and actually paid my phone bill more
than once a quarter.
Soon, my relationship with Stanford
seemed a little strained. She kept forcing
Philosophy CIV down my throat with
reckless abandon and wouldn't even stop
when I begged and pleaded. "It's good for
you" she said.
"Mary Poppins used a spoonful of
sugar to get it down," I replied with Dis
ney-esque frosh glee.
"Fuck Mary Poppins," she said as she
grabbed a sizable helping of Kant and
Nietzsche to ram down my esophagus.
As you can see, we occasionally got
into small misunderstandings.
She angered me when she canceled the
Big Game Bonfire, which, apparently,
was so enormous that you could see it
from Tangiers. For the sake of tiger sala
manders. I show her love, respect and a
$27,001) check every year, and she's wor

ried about lizards. She also upset me with
that debacle she called "Writing and Crit
ical Thinking," when the only thing criti
cal was my condition after that PC-laden,
let 's-show-you-how-to-th ink-and-tell
you-that-you-can't-write poor excuse for
four units. And don't get me started on
the "Party Planning" / bust-your-under
age-drinking-ass move she made a few
years back, imploring the police to make
cease and desist "any signs of frolicking
or glee" on her property.
But I loved her, you know. She was
like a mother to me. Sure, she never
made me instant oatmeal or dropped me
off at soccer practice or even wrote me
notes when I was late to homeroom every
day, but in her gentle — albeit bureau
cratic — arms, she nurtured me. She may
not be "socially responsible" or "fully
renovated" or "have a viable conservative
newspaper," but she is responsible for
putting about 6,000 of the most wonder
ful people out there in the same room,
giving them toys and encouraging them
to play witli and love one another.
Stanford is still alive for me. Aside

from the bimonthly mailings I will surely
receive requesting donations, she will
remain in my heart forever. (The organ
grows in volume.) Sure, I was first
attracted to her physical appearance, but
that's how all great romances begin.
Soon we grew to love each other for less
superficial reasons. (More organ.) We put
aside our differences, and I found my
niche — that part of Stanford that helped
shape who I am. And I found the part of
me that helped make Stanford who she is
(sniff, sniff).
The world without Stanford in it fright
ens me immensely. No, really, it scares
me. Rut I guess the fates have brought us
here for a reason. The organ music and
Kleenex can mean only one thing.
I guess it's time to move on.

Jeremy Desmon, a recent graduate in
public policy, wants everyone who hasn't
e-mailed or called him recently to do so
immediately. He'll miss you all.
