Grasp of hate crimes
extends to all students
Freshman year, the track team lost to
UC-Berkeley for the 23rd year in a row.
Afterward, the coach pulled me and all
of the other freshmen on the team aside.
He told us to remember the way Cal had
celebrated and taunted us. lie told us to
keep it in our minds. "This won't hap
pen in three years," he promised.
This spring, I came back to watch the
meet against Cal. It was the first meet I'd
watched in the three years since I quit. I
watched and celebrated as Stanford lead
(56 to 65 with only a couple of races to go.
Then I watched the men's half-mile
run and I got sick to my stomach.
A couple of weeks before, Jason
Lunn, Stanford's half-mile star, had
allegedly written "Fags must die!" and
"Gays are the downfall of the United
States!" on the walls of The Bollard eat
ing club. Now, he was running in a Stan
ford uniform and, as far as I knew, he
hadn't even apologized. He scored a
point for the team. My old coach smiled;
I left — bitter, sad and disgusted.
I returned to my dorm and wrote my
coach and Jason a letter. I told them
that the message that the Stanford Ath
letics Department sent to everyone is
that the only thing that matters is the
scoreboard. I told them that I didn't
know how the meet had turned out and
that I didn't care; even if Stanford had
ended up scoring more points than Cal,
in my mind, we had all lost. Later that
night, I learned that Stanford did win. It
should have been a momentous experi
ence for me; instead, it meant nothing.
The next day, I got a response from
Jason that was one of the most powerful
and painful letters I had ever read. He
told me his side of the story and what
had been going on inside of his head. He
told me of his regret, his pain and how
the whole incident had been misinter
preted. Yes, he had screwed up like he
never had before and he knew it. But he
also wanted me to know that he wasn't
the monster the Stanford community
had made him out to be.
I learned that Jason had turned him
self into the police the day after the inci
dent, as soon has he had sobered up.
There hadn't been a chase and a two
week time lag as the police had made it
seem like in their conversations with The
Daily that, ironically, were intended to
protect Jason. I learned that Jason had
written much more on the walls than
just the hate speech, including drivel like
"all stupid people should go in the trash
can." He wasn't deliberately writing hate
speech. He was babbling drunk and free
associating (and also using a pen, not the
spray paint that The Daily's word "graf
fiti" unintentionally implied).
Perhaps what he wrote was in the
back of his mind; perhaps, as he claims,

it was snippets from things that some
one at Rice University had said earlier in
the day. I learned that Jason had tried
to apologize to the gay community but
that they weren't ready and they hadn't
given him the chance.
But most important, I learned about
Jason and about some tremendous per
sonal struggles he has been going
through, struggles that would change
anyone's perception of what happened.
They don't change the fact that what
Jason did was completely unconscionable
and wrong. The words should still bring
chills to all of us, and Jason should —
and will — be punished. I know Jason
did something awful. But the rest of us
did something awful, too.
The Rev. Maurice Charles gave a
powerful speech after learning what
Jason wrote. He described the intimate
connection between hate speech and real
violence and described how hate speech
allows us to destroy people without
"knowing their names." Charles wrote
of his own experiences confronting
stereotypes, "The greatest learning that
took place during my college and gradu
ate school years was the learning of the
real names of newfound friends, real
people, who had been hidden previously
beneath my unspoken names for them."
By "not knowing someone's name,"
Charles meant replacing a person and
his life with an epithet, a stereotype or
an image of one-dimensional evil. It's
what motivates hate speech, but it's also
what we did to Jason and what caused
my visceral reaction at the track meet. I,
like many others, assumed Jason was an
unrepentant monster and that the worst
stereotypes of athletes and the Athletics
Department had been confirmed.
In part, I wanted to assume the worst;
or, at least, it was easiest to assume the
worst. I, like many others, have a craving
not to be victimized but to be able to play
the part of the victim and to spin reali
ties to make it appear like the world and
its demons are all against me. Sometimes
that's true. Sometimes it's not. In this
case, we all assumed the worst and never
gave Jason a chance.
I grew up Christian, but I quit many
years ago. However, there's one tenet that
I wish I had been better able to keep with
me: People were created in the image of
some sort of perfection. Fveryone, even
people who are gay and even Jason Lunn.
No, we shouldn't bend over backward for
everyone, but we should try to understand
everyone and give each other the benefit
of the doubt. This is true in our personal
relations, activism and everything else we
do. We'll only learn the truth once we
learn each others' names.
Hate speech is only possible when we
ignore this lesson. But being a victim
doesn't mean that one cannot perpetu
ate the problem too.

Turks' censorship and
deception cannot mask
genocidal past
I read with great interest the May 16
letter to The Daily by Funda Akin, Ali
Hortacsu and Muhamet Yildiz. I join the
writers in calling for an "honest and open
debate about the roots of the Turkish-
Armenian conflict" as a means of improv
ing relations between the two nations, in
that region and throughout the world.
The authors' attempt at questioning the
validity of characterizing the massacres as
genocide, however, only hurts this cause.
Rather than try to prove what has
already been proven through decades of
scholarly examination by American,
French, English, German, Austrian and
even Turkish sources and an over
whelming abundance of evidence in the
form of documents, pictures and testi
monials stored in the archives and diplo
matic records of these states, I will com
ment on the real significance of this let
ter, which lies in the unhealthy denial
that continues today.
The Armenian Genocide was the most
important human-rights issue of the
first decades of the 20th century. In fact
Raphael Lemkin, the father of the Geno
cide Gonvention, originated the term
"genocide" in order to describe the Holo
caust and the Turkish atrocities against
the Armenian nation. Thus, the Armeni
an experience was then and remains
now one of the original examples of
genocide. Despite these facts the Turk
ish government has devised increasingly
insidious ways of denying that the geno
cide occurred. Over the past few decades
the Turkish government has become
more and more sophisticated in its
attempts to rewrite history.
Beginning in the Gold War era,
Turkey has periodically coerced the U.S.
government on the issue of the Armeni
an Genocide recognition by threatening
to close U.S. air bases in Turkey. In the
1980s, Turkey coerced Gongress to
defeat resolutions that would have desig
nated a national day of remembrance of
the Armenian Genocide.
In 198*2, the Turkish government
tried to force the cancellation of an aca
demic conference in Tel Aviv at which
the Armenian Genocide was to be dis
cussed by making threats to the safety of
Jews in Turkey. The United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Wash
ington reported similar threats over
plans to include reference to the Arme
nian Genocide in its exhibits.
The Turkish government pays public
relations firms in the United States mil
lions of dollars each year to cleanse its
human rights image, past and present.
Today, the Turkish government
would like the world to believe that the
systematic extermination of a defense-

less and stateless people was a civil war.
This sort of propaganda can be very
strong and very compelling. Sadly, I now
realize that it has been successful in
deceiving even some of my brilliant col
leagues here at Stanford. It is sad that
even at this fine university, exceptional
intellects can be convinced of half
truths. This fact stands as a testimonial
to the success of the Turkish govern
ment's shameful quest.
For Turkish individuals, it is even
harder to uncover the truth since Turkey
is a country with no real freedom of
press. In fact, Turkish publisher Ayse
Nur Zarakolu was sentenced to two years
in prison in 1995 for publishing a trans
lation of "Armenian Taboo," by French
writer Yves Ternon. During the same
year, the Istanbul State Security Court
banned the book "Genocide as a Ques
tion of National and International Law:
The 1915 Armenian Event and its Con
sequences," written by an American aca
demic. These actions are typical of the
Turkish government's strict prohibition
of the writing or publishing of any mate
rials pertaining to the Armenian geno
cide and other human rights violations.
Censorship lends itself to biased opin
ions. It masks the truth in order to
deceive even a well-meaning and educat
ed public. For this reason, I invite Akin,
Hortacsu and Yildiz to question long
held assumptions and to use the freedom
they now enjoy at Stanford to investigate
the issues for themselves. Regrettably,
however, even as they attempt to free
themselves of years of misinformation by
investigating in the academic world, they
will need to be careful. The Turkish gov
ernment is funding chairs of Turkish his
tory at many elite American universities
in order to cleanse its image and deny its
past. Recently, Prof. Heath W. Lowry,
who holds the Ataturk Chair of Turkish
Studies at Princeton University
(endowed by $750,000 from the Republic
of Turkey), has been exposed as working
closely with the Turkish government to
discredit scholarship that mentions the
Armenian Genocide.
This unconscionable effort has drawn
the concern of some of this nation's most
resjKicted scholars and intellectuals who
have signed a petition condemning the
efforts of the Turkish government and
charlatans like Lowry. The distinguished
list of scholars includes William Styron,
Arthur Miller, Susan Sontag, Kurt Von
negut, John Updike, Seamus Heaney,
Joyce Carol Gates, Norman Mailer, Alfred
Kazin, Henry Ixmis Gates Jr., David Reis
man, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Robert N.
Bellah, Raul Hilberg, Robert Jay l,iflon,
David Brion Davis, Derek Walcott, Nancy
Tucker, Ronald Suny and more.
These scholars know the danger in
rewriting history and denying crimes
against humanity. They realize that the
Turkish government's denial of its
actions has major moral and ethical sig
nificance. Allowing the Turkish govern

ment to escape the consequences of the
Armenian Genocide allows it to continue
its current policy of massive human
rights violations against the Kurds.
The denial of genocide is the final
stage of genocide; it murders the dignity
of the survivors and destroys the remem
brance of the crime. Denial of genocide
strives to reshape history in order to
rehabilitate the perpetrators and demo
nize the victims. The Turkish govern
ment's denial of the Armenian Genocide
encourages, by its very nature, the cur
rent, programs that deny the Holocaust
and the Cambodian genocide; it encour
ages genocidal episodes that are currently
occurring or have recently occurred in
Rwanda, Burma and Bosnia. Turkey has
killed almost an entire nation. liet us not
allow it to kill the truth.

Men's swimming coach
uses tactics that round
out the competive edge
We would like to address comments in
Alda Leu's Thursday column, "Winning
isn't everything." In it, she said our
coach, Skip Kenney, "has problems hold
ing on to his swimmers." Any team that
excels at the national level is comprised
of individuals who are already dedicated
to that team. We would not be as suc
cessful as we have been if the commit
ment of our team members was ques
tionable. Our shared commitment to the
team is one of the motivating forces dur
ing competitions and practices. In a
school like Stanford, students inevitably
have many talents and opportunities.
Sometimes our teammates choose to pur
sue other interests. It is unjustified to
blame Skip for their decisions.
We are also disturbed by Leu's insin
uations that Skip has problematic rela
tions with his athletes. Skip coaches our
team with philosophies that go beyond
athletic competition. I le encourages our
development in all areas - athletic, aca
demic and personal. Our program would
not be* as successful as it is (and has
been) without contributions from every
member of our team, of which Skip Ken
ney is an integral part.
Although Leu disagrees, it is possible
for a coach to produce a team of both
"real winners" and champions. We are
not sure how she reached her conclu
sions about our relationship to Skip.
Perhaps in the future she will speak
with us before speaking for us.
