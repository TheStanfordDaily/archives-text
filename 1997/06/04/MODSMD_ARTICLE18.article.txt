The Task Force on Resident Programs and
Student Housing for Undergraduates may rec
ommend changes to housing for first- and sec
ond-year students in addition to changes in the
housing Draw before the end of the quarter,
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldfvar told The Daily on Monday.

The task force was con
vened at the end of fall quarter
at the request of University
President Gerhard Casper to
evaluate the system of housing
assignments and the relation
ship between residential edu
cation programs and under
graduate housing.
Still in the process of final
izing its recommendations, the

task force hopes to report its
findings to Provost Condoleezza Rice next
week. Rice may then choose to make those con
clusions public, Saldfvar said.
Chaired by Saldivar, the task force includes
three staff members, three faculty members
and three students.
According to Saldfvar, the task force spent
much of its time trying to understand how the
system currently functions and explored spe
cific aspects of its charge in the spring. Issues
facing the task force are complicated and have
no "clear-cut, simple answers," he added.
The task force's recommendation on the fu
ture availability of all-frosh housing may be
particularly significant.

Undergraduate curriculum is changing by
emphasizing the interaction between first- and
second-year programs, Saldfvar said, and the
recommendations of the task force will take
this framework as a model.
"This is a major course of direction" Saldf
var said of curricular changes but cautioned
that the task force is "not about to recom
mend a wholesale transition of housing
overnight."
According to Saldfvar, much of the task
force's work involved carefully considering
what impacts its recommendations may have
on students.
The task force will also make concrete rec
ommendations for changes in the Draw. There
is a "pretty clear consensus among students
that the system functions," but it may "need a
great deal of refining, perhaps reconsidera
tion," Saldfvar said.
Although specific recommendations are not
known yet, Saldfvar stressed the fact that the
Draw "can be improved and should be im
proved."
In evaluating the Residential Education
system, the task force discovered that "things
function fairly well," Saldfvar said. There is no
crisis to resolve, he explained, as students are
"getting along well and feeling secure."
According to Saldfvar, the task force will
make recommendations that seek to "fine
tune" Res Ed by improving computer services
and integration between advising and academ
ic activity in the residences.
Finding that residential "staffs do a won
derful job," the task force will make recom
mendations "to enhance what the staffs can

do," including some additional incentives for
faculty members to become resident fellows.
Saldivar praised Sophomore College as a
practical example of a program that fosters res
idential interactions between students and fac
ulty.
One of the most anticipated developments
for the next academic year will be the imple
mentation of freshman seminars, Saldivar
noted. Starting off at 80 in number, the semi
nars will immediately expose freshmen to
"some of the best minds Stanford has to
offer."
According to Saldivar, just as Sophomore
College and sophomore seminars have helped
students "make wise decisions," freshmen
"will find it easier" to explore new areas of aca
demic interest early enough to be able to
change their minds or to learn more as sopho
mores before making final decisions.
Saldivar also predicted that the changes im
plemented this year in the Area One require
ment, which is now fulfilled by the Cultures,
Ideas and Values Program, "will prove to be
positive ones" because they will give students
more substantive course choices and will allow
them to focus on several specific works during
fall quarter.
Attempting to define the role of the task
force in the University's committee structure,
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies des
ignated the task force as its Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising for the
current year.
The permanent oversight structure is yet to
be determined and the task force may make
recommendations on the issue in its report.
