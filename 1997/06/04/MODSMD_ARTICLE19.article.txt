More than 200 major grants
for undergraduate research
were awarded by the office of
Undergraduate Research Op
portunities last week.
"We want the students to be
come the discoverers and cre
ators of new knowledge instead
of simply being a sponge to soak
up old knowledge," said URO Di
rector Laura Selznick.
In addition to the major
grants, which totaled $455,000,
almost $25,000, in small grants
was awarded this year. Major
grants are for up to $2,500 while
minor grants have a maximum
of $500. According to Selznick,
this year's number of grant win
ners represented an all-time
record and showed how far the
program had come since its first
year, when only 20 major grants
were handed out.
Money for the program
comes partly from private indi
viduals such as Lynn and David
Mitchell and Peter and Helen
Bing and partly from charitable
trusts such as the Samuel Wool
ley Memorial Fund.
"A lot of the money we get is
from private donors who want to
make a difference in the quality
of education here at Stanford,"
Selznick said.
While a large amount of the
money came from an endow
ment that was raised as part of a
fund-raising campaign during
Stanford's centennial celebra
tion in 1991, the other portion
came through annual donations.
The projects cover a number
of disciplines ranging from the
humanities and sciences to nat
ural sciences and engineering.
All projects will extend over

three quarters and culminate in
an honor's thesis. A number of
students will be undertaking re
search that has never been done
before. Students applying for
grants had to find faculty spon
sors and submit proposals,
which were then evaluated by
faculty in the various depart
ments. Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon
Saldivar went over applications
at the last stage in the selection
process.
Some of the awards will be
used mostly for expenses such as
room and board, which allows
students conducting research to
get by without having to find a
job for the summer.
"Getting the award was
great. It was the one thing that
would enable me to conduct the
research," said junior Noam Liv
nat, who, along with junior
Michael Okun, will be building a
solid state laser gyroscope.
Other awards will be spent
primarily on travel, as many of
the students will be conducting
research abroad.
"I'll be in Hong Kong during
the transition [to Chinese rule),
and will be conducting inter
views with various companies
and executives," said junior An
drew Blackburn. 1 le will be ana
lyzing the change in intellectual
property rights during the
changeover.
Many of the grant recipients
were happy to find that the URO
was willing to fund projects out
side the "stereotypical research
area" of the sciences.
"I'm really grateful to Laura
Selznick and the people at the
URO for recognizing a project in
the humanities," said junior Ally
Field, who will be going to Paris
to study French new wave film.
