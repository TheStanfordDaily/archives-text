After months of negotiations between Bon Appetit
and union representatives, a tentative contract agree
ment was reached last night, with both sides emerging
pleased.
The agreement covers three main areas: wage in
creases, seniority issues and the creation of a fair griev
ance procedure.
Specifically, the agreement guarantees a general
wage increase each year, along with an automatic raise
after a new employee's probation period and a wage in
crease after a worker's initial annual evaluation. The
agreement also raises wages for those working the
graveyard shift.
Sandy Galvez, an organizer for the Service Employ
ees International Union Local 715, said that seniority
issues were a big concern to union members and that
the new contract goes a long way in addressing them.
She said Bon Appetit reduces operating hours during
the summer in response to less business and that full

time workers have their hours cut as a result.
The union has complained that when Bon Appetit
resumes normal hours in the fall, new workers are
hired and old workers do not go back to full-time hours.
According to Galvez, the agreement will help to solve
this problem.
On Monday night, the union and Bon Appetit man
agement reached an agreement on a grievance proce
dure for workers who feel Bon Appetit management
has violated the contract or made an unfair decision.
The new procedure would give workers a way to appeal
any decision they believe to be unfair.
In yesterday's negotiations, the union tried to light
for more holidays for its workers but eventually con
ceded after other demands were met.
Union negotiators were very optimistic about the
new agreement. "This is a great triumph," Elda Garcia,
a member of the negotiating team and a kitchen and
line prep worker for Bon Appetit, stud in Spanish. "At
last there is justice at work and power for the
workers."
However, other union members felt they
were not being kept abreast of the issues.
"As an employee, I don't know what the
conditions are," said Barbara Macia, anoth
er Bon Appetit worker. She was concerned
that she had been given no information
about recent union meetings with Bon Ap
petit management.
Union officials said they will present the
full settlement to members today, and a
vote will follow on Thursday. If approved,
the new contract will take effect immediate
ly; if rejected by union members, both sides

will return to the bargaining table.
Miguel Torres, a cook for Bon Appetit,
said he believes 95 percent of the workers
support the union. "1 feel that today we
have received more justice for everyone,"
Torres snid in Spanish after the settle
ment.
However, Daniel Calbow, a Bon Appetit
cashier, said he felt most employees were
not in favor of the union and its actions.
In regard to last Wednesday's protest or
ganized by the union, he said, "I think that
anything that hurts business hurts jobs."
Union organizers were eager to put their
problems with Bon Appetit in the past.
Bon Appetit representatives also ex
pressed optimism with the outcome.
"We're happy that we could finally reach
an agreement with them," said Mary Clark,
a district manager for Bon Appetit.
