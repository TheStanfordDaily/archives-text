# Camarillo, Long and Beach recognized
## Profs earn Bing awards 
### Samir Raiyani 
History Prof. Albert Camarillo, Biology
Prof. Sharon Long and Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. David Beach were recognized as this
year's Bing Fellows.
The Bing Fellowships for Excellence in
Teaching are funded by a $5 million fund es
tablished by Peter and Helen Bing in 1991 to
offer a variety of incentives for improved
teaching. The awards carry a $10,000-a
-year stipend for a three-year term for each
winner. Two-thirds of the money is to be
used to improve teaching or the curriculum,
and the remaining is left to the fellow's dis
cretion.
Beach has pioneered efforts to integrate
the fields of design, manufacturing, market
ing and precision engineering. He directs the
Product Realization Laboratory, where 400
students annually get an opportunity to un
derstand the interaction between manufac
turing and design.
"He has amazingenergy and enthusiasm,"
said Chuck McCall, a graduate student in the
course in computer-aided prototyping taught
by Beach this quarter. "He is not afraid to get
his hands dirty. .. . He's my hero."
Beach also teaches the new joint Graduate
School of Business and School of Engineering
course that offers teams of business students
and engineers an integrated experience in mar
ket research, product design, prototype manu
facture and product management.
Long is an authority on the subject of how
leguminous plants prepare proteins with the
help of symbiotic bacteria in the absence of
fertilizers. Her research group uses a combi
nation of genetics, molecular biology and
chemistry to study the communication be

tween the plant and the bacteria during this
process.
Long has pursued the idea of the new in
terdisciplinary science core for non-science
majors with great zeal.
"We tried to teach more of the science of
everyday life in this experimental version of
the course," she said.
"I belong to a community of scientists who
are really excited about their teaching... .At
scientific conferences, we are discussing more
and more the courses we teach and our exper
iments with education," Long said, emphasiz
ing the strong relationship between scholar
ship and education.
Camarillo has been in the news recently
as one of the chief proponents of the Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity Pro
gram.
"It took us two years, but it is really grati
fying, now that we have 28 majors in its very
first quarter," he said. "Stanford has now as
sumed the role of a leader not only in the area
of plurality in the student population, but also
in the academic study of the issues of race and
ethnicity."
Camarillo, considered by his peers as the
top Chicano historian in the country, received
the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for outstand
ing service to undergraduate education in
1988 and the Walter J. Gores Award for Ex
cellence in Teaching in 1994.
Like other winners of the fellowship, Ca
marillo teaches a number of undergraduate
courses while mentoring many doctoral stu
dents at the same time.
"It is interesting that some of my students
are now considered young leaders in my area,
and I am considered more of a middle-aged
scholar," he said.
