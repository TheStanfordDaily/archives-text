# Shen reflects on past year
## Ex-ASSU president summarizes accomplishments while in office 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
Life is easier these days for Bill Shen.
He goes hiking. He spends afternoons
reading in the Oval. He rarely thinks of
adhesive notepads. Retirement, he has
discovered, has its privileges.
Not that Shen, a junior, lived a partic
ularly stressful life as ASSU president,
just a busy one. When he left office two
weeks ago, ayear after becoming the first
single chief executive of the ASSU in 27
years, Shen ended a three-year relation
ship with Stanford student government
that has monopolized his life since fall
quarter of his freshman year.
The job, he said, had its share of high
and low points. On one hand, he orga
nized a huge "get-out-the-vote" effort,
aided in the passage of a new judicial char
ter and brought several issues to the fore
front of University discussion. On the
other, he exceeded his budget by nearly
$10,000, including a now-infamous pur
chase of $3,000 in adhesive notepads.
"I had a really steep learning curve,"
he said. "I think (Vice President Nick
Thompson] and I had a lot to be proud
of."
His chief accomplishment and most
enjoyable project, he said, was the
"Voice Your Choice '96" campaign, a
three-tiered effort Shen led in the fall,
aimed at voter registration, education
and participation. As part of that pro
gram, the ASSU President's Office reg
istered 1,200 students to vote in the No
vember national election and brought
Ross Perot, Ralph Nader and an affir
mative action debate featuring Dinesh
D'Souza and Jesse Jackson to campus.

Shen said he also "feels privileged" to
have worked with the senate on the pas
sage of the new judicial charter. The
timing of the charter was unique, he
said — few ASSU administrations are
able to help pass a major change in Uni
versity policy "on their watch."
Perhaps Shen's most notable actions
came when he worked closely with
Thompson, one of the best-known stu
dent activists on campus.
"The great thing about Nick is that
he really got me to think outside of the
box in terms of what student govern
ment can do," Shen said. "We learned a
lot from each other."
Collectively, Shen and Thompson set
their sights high, targeting several ad
ministrative issues and a major Ameri
can news magazine.
The pair began their fight with the
idea of creating a socially responsible en
dowment for the University, which was
originally a campaign issue. While the
University denied Shen and Thomp
son's request for the second endow
ment, Shen still claimed victory.
The issue, he said, got confused when
it moved from the campaign to public
debate, and supporters lost sight of its
original goal. "The fact that we were
able to put this issue at the forefront of
campus discussion," Shen said, "is
where the potential of the ASSU lies —
setting a sort of agenda for ASSU dis
cussion."
Ideas take time to be adopted, he said,
and often give rise to other topics of dis
cussion. The ASSU adoption of Thomp
son's crusade against the college rank
ings issue of U.S. News & World Report,
for example, stemmed from the endow

ment debate, as did the pursuit of a stu
dent seat on the University Board of
Trustees.
Another byproduct of a Shen cam
paign issue was the support of a propos
al to create a University minor in public
service. Shen ran on the promise to gain
credit for community service work, but
quickly adopted the proposed minor, an
issue about which he became passion
ate.
"We're talking about people going
into East Palo Alto, applying what
they've learned — there's a real acade
mic component to that," he said.
Shen added he hopes the accomplish
ments of his administration are not
overshadowed by his spending habits.
Shen spent $9,841.20 over his budget
during the year, a fact that does not
make him proud.
He did, however, offer a slight de
fense of his actions. "Call it reckless, but
I wanted to do things and get them
done," he said. "All I would ask for is a
little credit for having good intentions."
Hopefully, Shen said, people will look
upon his administration and focus on
the positives. Even if they don't, he said
he has a great deal of consolation in the
friends he has made while in office, few
of whom he would have met had he not
been president.
"That's the one thing I leave with, I
think," he said. "If nothing else, I'm
leaving with a lot of strong friends that I
have a lot of respect for."
While Shen currently serves as a
member of the search committee for a
new dean of admissions, he said he has no
plans involving ASSU participation and
hopes to enjoy being a senior next year.
