## 
### Jim Tankersley Staff writer 
The ASSU Constitutional Council
will meet this weekend to review the
actions of the ASSU Senate in certify
ing the Sophomore Class presidential
election at its last meeting.
ASSU Graduate Senator Michael
Slemmer filed a complaint to the
council early in the week to protest
the certification of Cardinal Quad as

Sophomore Class presidents at the
senate's May 24 meeting. The consti
tutional challenge is the first ever to
come before the constitutional coun
cil.
The complaint alleges that the ac
tion was unconstitutional for'two rea
sons: first, that the certification repre
sented a direct violation of the ASSU
bylaws, which in turn violates the
ASSU Constitution; and second, that
the Sophomore Class election was con

ducted under campaign spending lim
its, which Slemmer said violate the
free speech provision of the constitu
tion.
Four additional senators attached
their names to the complaint, and
council member Doug Natelson imme
diately called a meeting of the council.
An exact date of the meeting has not
been set, but details will be posted on a
newsgroup — su.org.assu — when
available.
