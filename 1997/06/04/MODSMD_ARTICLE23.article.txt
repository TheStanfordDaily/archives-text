## Ecologists write letter to President Clinton Document addresses issue of rapid global climate change 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Four Stanford professors joined 17
renowned ecologists from across the nation in
sending a letter to President Clinton on May 20
outlining the projected consequences of rapid
climate change. Biology Prof. Harold Mooney
organized the effort in preparation for a global
climate summit scheduled for December in
Kyoto, Japan.
The ecologists' biggest concern is that if
greenhouse gases continue to be emitted at the
current rate, the climate will change at the
fastest rate in 10,000 years.
In their letter, the scientists emphasized that
the rapid climate change would be much worse
than a slow change, even if the net change is
equal.
This change, added to pollution, habitat frag
mentation and habitat loss, may have detri
mental effects on certain species. Some animals
and plants may not be able to adapt to such a
rapid change, potentially resulting in the extinc
tion of less-resilient species.
In the letter, the scientists admitted the diffi
culty of predicting the response of a particular
species to rapid climate change because such an
event is unprecedented in recent history.
They do know that "significant climate

change has in the past and will in the future
require many species to shift their ranges.
Species vary in their ability and opportunities to
adapt or migrate. The rate of projected change is
enough to threaten seriously the survival of
many species."
The scientists recommended a dramatic cut
in greenhouse gas emissions. According to
Mooney, emissions eventually need to be cut by
more than half in order to stabilize the climate.
However, these reductions could be implement
ed gradually over the next century.
"Accordingly, we believe that the prudent
course would be to limit climate change to the
lowest rates feasible given emissions that have
already occurred," the scientists told the pres
ident. They recommended to limit global
warming to no more than 1 degree Celsius per
century.
Currently, experts predict that the global
mean temperature could increase by as much as
1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius, or 2 to 6 degrees
Fahrenheit, over the next century.
Ecologists fear that fires, floods, erosion,
droughts, storms, pests and pathogen out
breaks may increase during a rapid climate
change. These events could affect the quality of
the planet's water and soil, not to mention the
detrimental effects on the carbon cycle.
The change in temperature could mean rapid

sea level rise, which could lead to severe beach
erosion and could threaten coastal marshes and
mangrove forests.
A rapid climate change could also endanger
protected areas, like national parks and forests,
and the species that habitate there. In addition,
urban development on the boundaries of the
parks could also limit the re-establishment of
these species.
Stanford's representation in drafting the let
ter included Mooney, Biology Profs. Paul Ehrlich
and Peter Vitousek, Stephen Schneider, a profes
sor at the Institute for International Studies, and
Christopher Field, who works at the Carnegie
Insitution of Washington at Stanford.
At the December summit in Kyoto, inter
national leaders will aim to restrict emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
In preparation for the summit, the group
sent copies of the letter to Vice President A 1
Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs
Timothy Wirth, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman, Energy Secretary Federico Pena
and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit.
Also receiving the letter were Carol Brown
er, administrator of the Environmental Pro
tection Agency and James Baker, administra
tor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
