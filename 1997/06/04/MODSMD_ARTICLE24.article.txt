# Bug explains reflexes

What is a reflex?
A: A reflex is an action that
occurs immediately in
response to some kind of stimu
lus. Reflexes are unconscious
reactions to stimuli. This means
that you don't think about a
reflex; It just happens. That's
probably why you don't even
realize half of the reflex actions
you perform everyday.
For instance, just in your
eyes, there are many reflex
actions: the contraction and
dilation of the pupils, the move
ment of your eyes in synchrony,
the blinking when something
touches your eye and the fixa
tion of your eye on bright and
interesting objects. Yes, ogling
is a reflex. Unfortunately, that
has never worked as an excuse
for me.
The simplest theory of how
reflexes work is based on the
reflex arc. The idea behind the
reflex arc is that one nerve cell,
or neuron, detects something
that looks somewhat important
and then connects to another
neuron that activates a muscle.
Of course, this only describes
the simplest of reflexes. Usually
in more complex species, there
are other neurons in the path
way that transmit the signal
along.
You've probably heard of the
knee-jerk reflex either from
checkups with your doctor or, if
you're lik< me, from watching
Fred Flintstone kick his foot
into his mouth every time the
doctor hit his knee.
This reflex occurs when

someone taps your knee below
the knee cap. This stretches the
tendon, which activates a senso
ry neuron. The neuron then
sends a signal toward the spinal
cord. When the electrical signal
reaches the spinal cord, the
spinal cord immediately sends
another signal back down
toward your thigh, activating
the muscles that cause you to
kick.
If you've followed me so far,
you'll notice that the brain was
never involved in this decision.
The most basic reflex arcs do
not involve complicated neural
systems.
Really, it would be silly to
have to "think" about every one
of your reflexes. It doesn't real
ly take brain power to realize
something like, "Hey, my hand
is getting really, really hot.
Maybe it wasn't such a good
idea to rest it on top of the
stove." No, simple reflexes are a
little more primal, a little more
like, "AAAHHHH! Hot! Ow!
Ow! Ow!"
Plus, leaving the brain out
makes the reflex action faster.
Even though you would proba
bly never notice it, sending the
signal up your spinal cord to
the brain and then back down
again wastes time. However,
some reflexes are obviously
hooked up to higher cognitive
processes.
This was first discovered by a
dog and his owner, a guy named
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov. Initially,
Pavlov would present his dog
with food and ring a bell at the
same time. The dog would drool
when the food was presented,
which is a normal reflex.
However, after Pavlov did
this enough times, when he just
rang the bell and did not pre
sent food, the dog still started to
drool. This showed that it is
possible to create and modify
the reflex arcs that are already
present in the dog.
The meaning? Complex
reflexes are changeable. You
can suppress some reflexes and
you can generate new ones. So,
if you can't learn to suppress
your ogling and drooling reflex
es, you'll just have to create a
new, "Who me? I wasn't doing
anything!" reflex.
