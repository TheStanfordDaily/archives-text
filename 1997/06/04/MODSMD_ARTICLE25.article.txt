# Volunteers recruited for diarrhea study

It's a messy business, but some
one has to do it.
Recruit a bunch of people. Feed
them a culture of diarrhea-causing
bacteria. Then sit back and watch
what happens.
David Bieber, senior research
scientist in the Division of Infec
tious Diseases, is the leader of a
study at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter that is doing just that.
Bieber and his colleagues are
interested in the process of viru
lence in a strain of bacteria called
enterophathogenic E. coli. These
bacteria colonize the upper small
bowel and cause diarrhea in
humans.
A characteristic of these bacte
ria is the thin, filamentous pili that
extend from the surface of the bac
terial cell. Many of these pili bun
dle together into large ropes that
interweave between the bacterial
cells, causing the bacteria to clump
together in large aggregates.
Bieber and Gary School'nik, an
associate professor at Stanford's
Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
believe it is the pili-dependent
aggregation of the bacteria that
allows them to attach to the wall of
the intestine and ultimately cause
diarrhea in humans. The idea is
that "the aggregate is the infec
tious unit," said Bieber.
To test their theory, the Stan
ford scientists needed human vol
unteers. Lab mice were not an
option, as these bacteria do not
cause a diarrheal disease in other
animals.
Bieber advertised around cam
pus and soon found 34 volunteers
for the study. You would think it
would be difficult to recruit volun
teers for a study like this. Not so.
"People were clamoring at the
doors," Bieber said.
Nancy Andersen, purchasing
coordinator at the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, is an old hand at
participating in clinical studies,
blood and bone-marrow donation
to name a few. For Andersen, it is
an easy way to earn money and it's
also fun to participate.
Peter Cotton, a graduate stu
dent in mathematics, heard about
the study from a friend and took
part in it about six weeks ago. He
received the wild type bacterial
strain and subsequently developed
diarrhea.
When asked what motivated
him to do the study his answer was

rather vague: "Break the
monotony," "thought it would be
fun," "change of surroundings,"
"curious to see what would hap
pen," "long-term goals seem pretty
good." Cotton had diarrhea for
almost two days but said he was
never in any real discomfort and
would be involved again in similar
studies.
After receiving a verbal expla
nation of the study and completing
a questionnaire to ensure
informed consent, volunteers
underwent an extensive medical
examination before a bed was
reserved for them at Stanford's
General Clinical Research Center.
Only four participants chick
ened out just before the treatment
was scheduled to begin. Usually
"people who show initial interest
are by and large interested enough
to follow through," Bieber said.
On the first day of the study,
patients were admitted to the hos
pital and fasted for two or three
hours. Then came the bacteria.
The patients were first required to
drink a cup of sodium bicarbonate,
which was followed with "a shot
glass" of bacterial suspension.

There is no smell and no
taste. It's basically a
slightly salty drink with
the salty taste coming
from the buffer solution,
not the bacteria.
"If I were to put it in a
glass . . . you wouldn't
notice the turbidity at
all," said Bieber. "No
one's gagged or spit it
out." The sodium bicar
bonate was swallowed
first to neutralize the acid
of the stomach and give
the bacteria every chance
to colonize the gut. As
Bieber said, "It's a wimpy
bug ... a pathogen that
you can snuggle up to."
Then the waiting
began. Patients were con
fined to their rooms — all
the better to be close to
the bathroom. Inserts,
fondly known as "hats,"
were placed inside the toi
let. Stool specimens were
deposited in the hat and
examined by a nurse
before a diagnosis of clini
cal diarrhea is assigned.
Samples were taken to
identify the bacteria and
for future molecular anal
ysis.

Patients were kept in the hospi
tal for four clays and began a
course of antibiotics on the last
two days to kill any remaining bac
teria. These bacteria are very sen
sitive to antibiotics, which is the
reason Bieber was comfortable
using the strain in humans. A nor
mal healthy adult would cure
themselves without any antibiotic
intervention.
This was a double-blind study,
meaning nobody knew which
patients received an innoculum of
which bacteria. Half of the patients
were given the wild-type bacteria
— the strain that causes diarrhea
in most people. The other half
received an innoculum of a geneti
cally altered strain of this bacteria.
The engineered strain lacks the
gene that expresses the pili on the
surface of the bacterial coll. By
comparing the number of patients
that developed diarrhea after con
suming each of the bacterial
strains, Bieber was able to deter
mine the effects of pili on the abili
ty of tin? bacteria to cause diar
rheal disease in humans.
After completing the study, the
hypothesis was confirmed.

Patients infected with the strain of
bacteria lacking the gene for pili
production were less likely to
become ill. Those that did develop
diarrhea had less severe symp
toms. Thus, the rope-like pili that
link the bacteria together play an
important role in their ability to
anise disease.
"The ultimate goal of this
research is to look for expression of
virulence genes at the site of infec
tion," said Bieber. An extension of
the study is in preparation and
more volunteers are needed. Using
small biopsy samples taken direct
ly from the intestine, Bieber will
see if the bacterial genes that pro
duce the pili are turned on at the
site of infection in patients who
develop diarrhea.
Bieber cautiously speculates
that eventually there will be some
way to intervene in the
pathogenicity of this organism.
Although the frequency of infec
tion is low in the United States,
this type of diarrhea is a major
health problem responsible for
malnutrition and death among
children living in developing
countries.

Ropc-like bundles called pili link the bacteria together and enable them to
attach to the surface of the intestine. This aggregation is important in caus
ing diarrhea in humans.
