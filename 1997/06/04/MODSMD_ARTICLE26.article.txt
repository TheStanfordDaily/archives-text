Thalidomide heals mouth ulcers

The drug thalidomide effectively heals severe mouth
and throat ulcers in people infected with HIV, accord
ing to a study published in The New England Journal of
Medicine and sponsored by the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
"For the many patients with HIV infection who suf
fer from these ulcers, eating can be excruciatingly
painful, which exacerbates wasting and debilitation,"

said Jack Killen, director of the institute's AIDS division.
"Thalidomide is the first treatment shown in a scientific study to
heal these ulcers, but the course should be carefully monitored and
limited in its duration because of the drug's potential toxicity."
Thalidomide is known for its ability to cause severe birth defects.
But patients only experienced minimal side effects such as drowsi
ness and rashes while taking thalidomide.
Of the patients receiving four weeks of thalidomide, 55 percent
healed completely. Only 7 percent of patients receiving placebo
healed. Almost all of the patients receiving thalidomide healed at
least partially.
"Thalidomide appears to have great potential as a therapy for
HIV-infected patients who have severe oral aphthous ulcers," said
Lawrence Fox, one of the study's authors. "But only when adminis
tered by a physician who is vigilant for the possible serious side
effects including irreversible, painful peripheral nerve damage, rash
and birth defects."

Debate over Martian life rages

When Chemistry Prof. Richard /arc th«■
results of his controversi.'d study of a meteorite from Mars,
lie didn't expect the scientific debate to Ixromc o emotion
aland disruptive.
The original study contained four basic lines of argu
rnent to support the life-on-Mars hypothesis 'I he mete
orite they examined, named ALHMOOI, came from Mars,
it contained a pattern of organic compounds that could

have boon produced by the fossili/ation of microorganisms; it contained
several unusual minerals commonly produced by microbes, and when
examine by an electron microscope, it revealed textures that appear to
look like tiny microfossils.
Since its initial publication, numerous scientific papers have been pre
sen ted and published attacking various aspects of the initial study. Hut.
more have claimed to provide additional support.
The most highly contested part of the study are the textures that look
like microfossils. Some scientists argue that these texture , were probably
artifacts of the electron microscopy process. To get a surface to show up
on an electron microscope, it must be coated with a t bin layer of gold. Thi.
coating is not uniform and could create textures that aren't really there
/are confessed that the need to respond to criticism ha.- ->et progress in
his lab back considerably. "I never imagined how disruptive this could
be," he said. "Nevertheless, this is a real science story unfolding, warts
and all. It shows that the course of true science, lik«* that of true love, sel
dom runs smoothly."
