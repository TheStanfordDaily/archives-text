The Palo Alto City Council is on the verge of
approving Stanford's proposed Sand Hill Road
Project. On Monday night, it resolved the re
maining conflicts with the University, paving
the way for final approval.
In a series of unanimous votes, the council
accepted Stanford compromise proposals re
garding a new parking garage at the Stanford
Shopping Center, future development in part
of the West Campus area and a market that is
part of the apartment complex.
"It's difficult to believe we are coming to the
end of this journey," said Councilwoman Liz
Kniss, drawing laughter from the audience.
The council voted to allow Stanford to build
one new parking garage as part of its shopping
center expansion. A previous proposal con
tained two smaller garages. The council's deci
sion to limit Sand Hill Road expansion to two

lanes also freed up parking spaces unavailable
in Stanford's original proposal. The new park
ing structure will be limited to a height of 24
feet.
Also as part of the compromise, Stanford
would not be responsible for providing a Trans
portation Demand Management program, re
quested by the council to promote transporta
tion alternatives for new employees at the
shopping center.
Stanford also agreed to limit development
of a 139-acre area on the campus side of Sand
Hill Road to "athletic or academic fields"
through the year 2020. The council originally
sought to protect this area and others from
significant development through the year
2025, with the aim of protecting at least some
open space in the Sand Hill corridor.
In a last concession to Stanford, the council
agreed to let the University decide whether, at
the end of two years, a small deli market in the

Stanford West apartment complex develop
ment would continue to operate. Originally,
city negotiators proposed having veto power
over termination of the marketplace.
"Retailing decisions belong with retailers,"
said Councilwoman Micki Scneider, arguing
in favor of the compromise. She added that
she found it hard to believe that the store
would be economically viable, saying it was
too small.
Representatives of Stanford and Palo Alto
will now produce a final version of the devel
opment agreement, which must win final ap
proval by the council.
"No one likes every aspect of this package,"
said Palo Alto Mayor Joseph Huber, although
he called the compromise a good one.
"I don't think we'd want any other neigh
bor than Stanford University," he added. "Hut
this community will not take a reactionary ap
proach to proposed development."
