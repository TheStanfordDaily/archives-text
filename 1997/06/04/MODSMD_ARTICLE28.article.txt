# Milwaukee takes Peterson in draft
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
OHAMA, Neb. — Middle Amer
ica has held a special place in Kyle
Peterson's heart for many years,
but now it holds a new meaning.
Peterson, the Stanford baseball
team's ace, was picked No. 13
overall in the June Amateur Draft
by the Milwaukee Brewers. The
draft began yesterday, and the ju
nior was notified of his first-round
selection just before the Cardinal
took on Auburn in its third game
of the College World Series.
In later rounds, junior catcher
Jon Schaeffer was drafted in the
ninth round by the Minnesota
Twins. Junior outfielder Joe Kil
burg was selected in the 10th
round by the Cleveland Indians,
and junior shortstop Jay Pecci was
picked by the Cincinnati Reds in
the same round.
"It is real exciting," Peterson
said. "The wondering is out of the
way."
Peterson has made a lasting
impression on the Stanford base
ball community through his
achievements on the field and
grace off of it.
While on the Farm, the three
time All-American and 1995 na
tional freshman of the year has
compiled a 35-9 record with a 3.54
career ERA. The only two-time
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division pitcher of the year has set
the school's all-time strikeout

record at 356, breaking current
Cleveland Indian pitcher Jack Mc-
Dowell's record of 337. He also
holds the single-season strikeout
record at 149; he broke Stan
Spencer's previous record of 145
in Omaha on Sunday.
"Kyle is a real pitcher," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "I have had guys who throw
harder or throw a better curve.
But Kyle is a competitor. You give
Kyle the ball, and you get a chance
to win.
"He knows what it takes to
win," Marquess added. "He is the
type of pitcher [Atlanta's Gregl
Maddux is. He has earned this,
and it couldn't have happened to a
better guy."
Holding the draft during the se
ries is controversial, as it distracts
players in Omaha. As exciting as
the selection is for Peterson, he
still is focused on winning the na
tional title with the Cardinal.
"We still need to win three
more games here. Then I will be
ready to think about the Brew
ers," Peterson said. "It is impor
tant to keep perspective on why we
are in town. There are 25 guys on
the club, and it would be selfish to
think about myself now."
When questioned by a reporter
whether he liked beer and cheese,
Marquess interceded and told Pe
terson, "Don't answer that."
With a grin on his face, Peter
son ignored the advice. "I like
cheese," he said.
