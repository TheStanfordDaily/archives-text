# Conley elected chair
## Fac Sen head hopes little controversy will arise next year 
### Boris Bershteyn Staff writer 
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley, who was elected chair of
next year's Faculty Senate, said
she is looking forward to a leg
islative year relatively devoid of
controversy.
"Like any senate chair," Conley
said she will try to be responsive to
the constituency of faculty and stu
dents. However, the senate is main
ly a "reactive body," she noted, and
will consider issues that are referred
to it.
According to Conley, the next
session is not likely to see many
"burning" issues, at least none as
contentious as this year's debate
over the new legislation on the Area
One requirement, which is current
ly filled by the Cultures, Ideas and
Values Program.
The senate's agenda will include
questions of training for teaching
assistants and regular reviews of in
terdisciplinary programs, she said.
Conley also added that she does
not expect the merger between
Stanford Health Services and UC-
San Francisco Medical Center to
cause much legislative activity.
Although she would like to see
legislation that adjusts academic
structure to accommodate the
newly merged entity, such as proce
dures for joint appointments, Con
ley said she is pessimistic about the
prospects of such proposals appear
ing before the senate so soon.
Controversial tenure cases are
also unlikely to have legislative con
sequences, Conley noted, unless
policy changes in the way appoint
ments and promotions are made are
proposed.
Conley's affiliation with Stan
ford is life-long. Born in the area 56
years ago, she earned her bachelor's
and medical degrees here, as well as
a master's from the Graduate
School of Business.
Chairing the senate is not the
only exciting development in Con
ley's career â€” in August she will re

place Anesthesiology Prof. Richard
Mazze as chief of staff at the Veter
ans Affairs Hospital in Palo Alto.
The Advisory Board of the Acad
emic Council hearings about the
status of Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pf
efferbaum, who tried to get reas
signed from VA employment to the
Medical School, will hopefully be re
solved by the time she becomes chief
of staff, Conley said.
The University administration is
arguing that Pfefferbaum cannot
leave his VA assignment without vi
olating his academic duty to Stan
ford.
"I thought that I could do the
same as Pfefferbaum," Conley
noted, but the hearings will proba
bly help to clarify the issue.
In early 19905, Conley, then
chair of the Medical School's Facul
ty Senate, caused a media flurry
when she resigned from the school
after a professor who Conley be
lieved to be a sexist was promoted to
chair the Neurosurgery Depart
ment.
The media "labeled the case as
sexual harassment," Conley said,
but her departure was really about
the school's administration contra
dicting its own stated goal of mak
ing women and minorities feel com
fortable in the medical profession.
Several months later, after the
University took steps to combat sex
ism, Conley returned to her posi
tion.
At the time, Conley told The
Daily that her actions have probably
jeopardized her chances of serving
in an administrative position.
Conley said she remains a "pari
ah" at the school, although the re
cent appointments are a "semi
vote" of confidence from the Uni
versity.
It is important that people real
ize there is more to her work at the
University than women's issues,
Conley said. "Am I unidimension
al?" she exclaimed. "No way."
"I tend to be a bit outrageous,"
predicted Conley about her style of
leading the senate.
