### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
While the school year is coming to a
close, the loose ends of several adminis
trative projects are starting to wrap up,
making this time of year particularly
busy for Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Among the issues he is currently work
ing on are the renovation of Tresidder
Union, the disability access needs

analysis report and the progress of the case concerning
anti-gay vandalism at a Suites eating club.
Tresidder renovation
Renovating Tresidder may seem like a never-ending
process to some, but according to Wais, students' pa
tience is about to pay off.
Tresidder's proposed fitness center recently received
University approval for funding. Wais still anticipates
the center being open by the first day of fall quarter.
He said he hopes the fitness facility will enhance
Tresidder by bringing a center closer to the dormitories,

complementing other vendors and increasing traffic at
Tresidder.
Cheryl Ix'vick, the senior associate director of athlet
ics, said she anticipates that the new facility will offset
congestion at Arrillaga Family Sports Center.
"1 really believe this new fitness center will help to
address the clearly identified needs of recreational ath
letes," Wais said.
Levick said this facility will not only be accessible to
the handicapped but will also incorporate new weight
machines for disabled individuals.
"We plan on having special machines that allow indi
viduals to use the weights while staying in their wheel
chairs," she said.
According to the facility's design is currently
in the hands of the architect, who will hopefully approve
the plans, so construction can be finished by the first day
of classes next fall.
Next door to the facility will be Pulse Copy, which
moved into the former location of the recreation center
on May 12. Pulse General Manager Jonathan Marder
