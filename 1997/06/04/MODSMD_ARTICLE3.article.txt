# Renovations top dean's list
## Tresidder fitness center, disability access on agenda for Wais 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
While the school year is coming to a
close, the loose ends of several adminis
trative projects are starting to wrap up,
making this time of year particularly
busy for Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Among the issues he is currently work
ing on are the renovation of Tresidder
Union, the disability access needs

analysis report and the progress of the case concerning
anti-gay vandalism at a Suites eating club.
Tresidder renovation
Renovating Tresidder may seem like a never-ending
process to some, but according to Wais, students' pa
tience is about to pay off.
Tresidder's proposed fitness center recently received
University approval for funding. Wais still anticipates
the center being open by the first day of fall quarter.
He said he hopes the fitness facility will enhance
Tresidder by bringing a center closer to the dormitories,

complementing other vendors and increasing traffic at
Tresidder.
Cheryl Ix'vick, the senior associate director of athlet
ics, said she anticipates that the new facility will offset
congestion at Arrillaga Family Sports Center.
"1 really believe this new fitness center will help to
address the clearly identified needs of recreational ath
letes," Wais said.
Levick said this facility will not only be accessible to
the handicapped but will also incorporate new weight
machines for disabled individuals.
"We plan on having special machines that allow indi
viduals to use the weights while staying in their wheel
chairs," she said.
According to the facility's design is currently
in the hands of the architect, who will hopefully approve
the plans, so construction can be finished by the first day
of classes next fall.
Next door to the facility will be Pulse Copy, which
moved into the former location of the recreation center
on May 12. Pulse General Manager Jonathan Marder


Wais
said the copy center will not cele
brate its official re-opening until
next fall. However, people am still
take advantage of the center's new
services, which include a copy area
that will be available to use 24 hours
a day, every day.
Wais said he is also pleased with
the campus' reception to the new
Jamba Juice. Out of the smoothie
company's 50 locations in Califor
nia, Jamba Juice's Tresidder loca
tion broke all sales records on its

first day of business. Wais said he is
still keeping an eye on the smoothie
bar.
"The University is concerned
about the long wait at Jamba Juice,"
Wais said. "I just want to tell stu
dents if they've been discouraged by
the lines, please give Jamba Juice a
second try."
Wais assured that the University
has been in contact with Jamba
Juice management, who have said
they are planning to increase their
staff behind the juice counter in
order to reduce the long lines.
Overall, Wais said he is optimistic
about next fall at Tresidder. "Our
hope is by the first day of classes, it

will mean for the first time in a long
time that Tresidder Union will l>e
fully occupied."
Disability access
Architects recently completed a
needs analysis report for most of the
campus's community centers, Wais
said. The report has been forwarded
to the community centers and the
Disability Resource Center. Wais
said he will wait for the centers to
tell his office their priorities for dis
ability access.
Construction for the long-await
ed elevator for the Fire Truck 1 louse
is slated to begin the day after Com
mencement.

Anti-gay vandalism
While track team member Jason
Lunn, a junior, luis already faced
criminal charges in the April 7 anti
gay vandalism at The Bollard eating
club, the Office of Judicial Affairs
has taken recent steps in the case to
determine whether there has been a
violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
"The investigation has recently
been completed, and the case will
be adjudicated through the Univer
sity's judicial process," Wais said.
Violators of the Fundamental
Standard may face removal from
the University.
