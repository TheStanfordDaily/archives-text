## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
While many students began to
cram for finals on Monday, mem
bers of Volunteers Increasing the
Visability of AIDS took a day away
from their books to lobby at the
state capitol for the seventh annual
AIDS Lobby Day.
Sophomore Simon Martinez,
who participated in the event last
year as part of a community service
class, helped coordinate the Stan
ford effort.
"It gives people a voice that ex
tends beyond a protest on campus,"
Martinez said. "That's one day that
[state legislators! hear a direct
story. There's nothing more influ
ential than talking to the person
who's voting on this."
Participants spoke with legisla
tors primarily on four topics — the
AIDS Drug Assistance Program,
support for funding for HIV test
ing at family planning clinics and
mobile clinics, support for pending

legislation and welfare reform pro
visions.
The first piece of legislation they
lobbied for was Assembly Bill 1099,
the "Return to Work" bill spon
sored by Assemblywoman Carole
Migden, D-San Francisco. This bill
would make it easier for people
with HIV or AIDS to return to work
by continuing their Medi-Cal eligi
bility.
The bill was sent to the Senate
with a 72-1 vote yesterday.
The second piece of legislation
was Senate Bill 885, the "Needle
Exchange Bill," which has been ex
tremely controversial. According to
Martinez, there are currently 20
exchange sites in the state, four of
which are illegal underground
sites. Possession of a syringe with
out a prescription is illegal in Cali
fornia.
This bill, sponsored by State
Sen. Diane Watson, D-Los Ange
les, would allow certain areas, in
cluding Los Angeles, Long Beach,
San Jose and San Francisco, to set

up legal needle-exchange pro
grams if the cities requested them.
Legislation on ne<xlle exchange
is of particular importance be
cause, according the San Francisco
AIDS Foundation, most new HIV
infections in the United States are
linked to intravenous drug use.
New developments in treat
ment, such as protease inhibitors,
were introduced this year, making
some people think AIDS is no
longer an important issue, Mar
tinez said. Although the number of
AIDS deaths in the United States is
declining, the number of people liv
ing with HIV is still rising.
Junior Karen Wang, who
helped Martinez organize the ef
fort, said the group tried to speak
with every representative from t he
South Bay.
Martinez said several students
spoke with the aide of State Sen.
Byron Sher, D-Stanford. "He was
extremely receptive. He supports
needle exchange."
The contingent of Stanford stu

dents attended the event with rep
resentatives from San Jose AIDS
Resources and Information Ser
vices.
"If we went up with a service
provider, we felt we would have a
stronger presence," Martinez said.
I le also said he felt he represent
ed many of the people who could
not make the trip to Sacramento.
"Some people have a desire to
speak to their congresspeople, hut
they can't because of their illness,"
Martinez said.
Compared to the number of lob
byists, service providers and people
with AIDS and HIV, Martinez said
there were relatively few students
at the event.
Other Stanford students who
went on the trip include freshmen
Jessica Stanton, Jessica Werner
and Annie Liu and sophomores
Patrick Dominguez and Emilie
Hard. Cowell Student Health (-en
ter's student projects coordinator
Benjamin Morgan accompanied
the group to t he capitol.
