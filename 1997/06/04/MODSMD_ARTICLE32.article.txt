# From Forsythe to McClatchy: What's in a name?
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Kimone Gooden Contributing writers 
As the Science and Engineering Quad
rises to become the campus's newest
major building project, we must be re
minded that it is just the latest of these
such projects.
David Packard and William Hewlett
gave the funding to Stanford for the new
science quad. However, this was certainly
not the first building project to which ei
ther of these generous Stanford alumni
donated money
This story is the third in an occasional
series about the histories of various Stan
ford buildings and how they got their
names.
Roscoe Maples Pavilion
Stanford's basketball court, which saw
the men's and women's basketball teams
go a combined 27 to 0 this past season at
home, was dedicated on March 1, 1969.
Maples replaced The Pavilion — now
known as Burnham Pavilion — as the pri
mary varsity basketball arena. The Pavil
ion only had seating for 2,700, and a larg
er arena became necessary as basketball's
popularity grew.
Roscoe Maples, a 1904 graduate, do
nated $1.7 million from his estate when
he died in 1963. Of this money donated by
the California lumber man's estate, $1.2
million went to the basketball arena. It
cost a total of $3.3 million to build.
Maples was originally only to have
6,000 seats. However, after a furious
fundraising effort to get the capacity up to
8,000 seats — capped off by a $500,000 do
nation from David Packard — the capaci
ty was increased. Currently, the facility
has 7,391 seats
Lane Hall
Also known as the History Corner,
Building 200 was originally built in 1903.
However, the building underwent a
major renovation, along with a number of
other buildings in the Quad, in the late
70s. In order to get the building up to
earthquake safety standards, the Univer
sity began $7 million refurbishment pro
ject on the History Corner in August
1977. The new building was opened for
business again in October 1979, and dedi
cated on February 8, 1980.
The building was renamed after Bill
Lane and his family last year. The Lane
family, along with 2 other families, donat
ed $20 million to Stanford to help rebuild
and reinforce buildings damaged in the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The Lane
family has traditionally been generous to
ward the Farm, as they also helped fund
the restoration of the Red Barn and the
Stanford Governor's Mansion in Sacra
mento.
Braun Music Center
Dedicated May 25, 1984, the Braun
Music Center gave the Music Department
what it had been wanting for about 40
years: a new home.
Before Braun's opening, the music cen
ter was primarily located in the Knoll and
some classroom trailers behind the Knoll,
which was built to be the home of Stan
ford's third president, Ray Lyman Wilbur,
in 1919.
In 1979, plans for the music center
were first introduced, and after several

delays, construction began in 1981.
Scheduled to open in August 1983,
Braun's opening was delayed by a series of
odd events, including a strike by the Unit
ed Stanford Workers and a fierce wind and
rain storm that damaged the developing
building.
A substantial portion of the $7.4 mil
lion used to construct Braun was donated
by the Carl Braun trust. A Los Angeles en
gineer, his daughter graduated from the
music department. Braun's trust also do
nated funds for the Braun Auditorium in
the Mudd Chemistry Building, and along
with the Lane and Pigott families, funds
toward the reconstruction of buildings
damaged in the 1989 earthquake. The Ge
ology Corner now also bears his name.
Some of the music center's funding also
came from William Hewlett and his wife,
Flora.
Forsythc Hall
The hall that houses much of Stan

ford's networking structure is named
after George E. Forsythe.
Forsythe, who died of cancer at 55 in
1972, was the first chair of Stanford's
Computer Science Department. After
graduating from Swarthmore College and
Brown University, he made his way to
Stanford, where he became a math profes
sor in 1957.
In 1961, Forsythe became the director
of the Computation Center and Computer
Science division of the department, and
became the first chair of the Computer
Science Department when it was formed
in 1965.
Forsythe Hall was dedicated January
14, 1980. Students now remember
Forsythe by typing in his name every time
a student logs into Axess.
Hechtcl International Center
Much of the funding for Bechtel came
from the Bechtel family and its company,
(lie Bechtel Multinational Construction

Co. Their funding relationship with Stan
ford, however, extends beyond the Inter
national Center; the Bechtel family also
donated some of the funds needed to ren
ovate Encina Hall
The center is housed in the former Zeta
Psi fraternity house. Stephen I). Bechtel,
then the senior director of the Bechtel
Corporation and a past member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, donated the
bulk of the capital needed to renovate the
old fraternity house. In 1963, 44 years
after the house was built, it became Bech
tel International Center.
Since its inception in 1963, the center
has undergone several renovations. In
1978, a new wing was added, the patio
was renovated and conference room was
built. These expansion were made possi
ble by the Bechtel and Lane families. In
the early 80s the center was given a clock
that showed different times around the
world by the Japanese Student Associa
tion.
Before Bechtel was established, the in
ternational center was located was an old
faculty home on Lausen Street. This
house serviced the international commu
nity until 1961 when a fire destroyed it
White Memorial Plaza
The infamous White Plaza, home to
every protest, walk-out and student gath
ering on Stanford campus, was named by
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond White of Kansas
City, Mo, in memory of their two sons
both members of the class of 1949 — that
died in tragic accidents. John died in Octo
ber 1952 in a surfing accident at San
Onofre Beach and his younger brother
William died in July 1948 in a training
plane accident on Randolph Field in
Texas.
The Claw was constructed in White
Plaza in 1963, after a world-wide, year
long search for an appropriate sculpture
both in Europe and America. The chosen
design was by Arstides Demetrios, a San
Francisco artist.
Ten years after its construction, the
claw received a complete renovation by
the artist. This renovation, which consti
tuted opening the arms of the claw, where
the water runs, and replacing the old, cor
roded copper tubing with new tubing lined
with plastic. The funding to renovate the
claw was also provided by Ra\ mond
White.
Meyer Library
On December 2, 1966, the unnamed
new undergraduate library was dedicated
with much fanfare. The name was not an
nounced until that day, when it became J.
llenry Meyer Memorial Library.
However, that name, at least in the
minds of most students, did not last for
long. Sometime after it opened, stu
dents began to call the library UGLY as
kind of an odd acronym for undergradu
ate library — and because, well, they
thought it was kind of ugly. This name
persisted throughout much of the 70s
and 80s.
When it opened in 1966 — complete
with a snack bar and smoking lounge on
the first fioor — Meyer was met with
"near universal approval," according to a
Daily article. The approval did not last,
though. Ever since, the architecture has
been criticized for making the building
noisy and for being a waste of space (be
cause of the huge hole in the middle of the

third and fourth stories). Also, the nu
merous little windows, according to some
legends, went unwashed for decades after
the opening.
Meyer was named after a prominent
San Francisco banker and the president of
the California Railway Company. His
daughters, Alice Meyer Buck — a 1904
graduate ■ and ()lgaMeyer, donated $5.2
million toward the library.
Sweet Flail
Opened in August 1986, Sweet Hall
brought together many academic re
sources in one place, including the Under
graduate Research Opportunities office,
the Center For Teaching and Learning,
various computing resources, and the
other organizations now housed there.
Previously, these centers and offices were
scattered around campus.
The building is named after Adelbert
H. Sweet and Amy Whatmore Sweet.
Their daughter, Elaine Sweet, a graduate
of Stanford in 1919, donated some of the
funds fort he building in their memory.
Adelbert, Amy, and Elaine — now you
know where those sillv e-mail machine
names came from.
McClatchy Hall
Also known as Building 120, Mc-
Clatchy 11all was rebuilt and given its new
name in the early 1980s.
According to Communication Prof.
1 lenry Breitrose, who was the department
chair while the building was reconstruct
ed, the McClatchy family has had a close
relationship with the University for years
and donated a large amount of the $16
million needed for the reconstruction.
The family owns one of the largest news
paper chains in the country, including
The Sacramento Bee. Two of the family's
sons, Jim and C.K., also graduated from
the department.
Breitrose said each of the stones form
ing the outside of the building were re
moved individually for the seismic recon
struction, numbered, and put back. For
the new McClatchy I lall, a two-level base
ment was dug and an extra floor was
added to the building. It reopened in 1984.
The funding for the fourth floor, the
('handler Journalism ('enter, was provid
ed by the family of the majority stockhold
er of the Los Angeles Times. Otis Chan
dler and two sons, Norm and Harry, are
Stanford graduates, Breitrose said.
Varian Labs
If you have ever taken a red-eye flight,
you have benefited from the genius of
Russell Varian. Born in 1898 in Washing
ton D.C, Varian was diagnosed with a
reading disorder.
This deficiency caused him to be held
back in school repeatedly, so much so that
at one point he was four years older than
the other members of his class. However,
this deficiency was made up for with a
highly analytical mind that aided him im
mensely in his scientific endeavors, and he
eventually rebounded in school
So much, in fact, that he graduated
from Stanford with a bachelor's degree in
physics in 1925 and a master's in 1927. He
eventually invented the Klystron, a high
power microwave source and amplifier
that aids aircraft in blind landings
The Varian physics laboratories were
opened in 1962, honoring Varian three
vears after his death in 1959.
