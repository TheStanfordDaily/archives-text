# Stanford awarded Internet 2 funding

Last week, the National Science Founda
tion announced that Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
USC and CalTech had been awarded a $3.85
million grant to develop a super high-speed
network.
The project, sometimes called Internet 11,
will consist of high-speed network rings in
both Northern and Southern California that
will be connected both to each other and to a
greater national system. The foundation's
grant is the first source of outside financing
for the project.
Raman Khanna, director of Distributed
Computing and Communications Systems, a
division of Information Technology Systems
and Services, said the new network will
"allow our researchers and educators to
make changes in the way people teach.
We're no longer restricted by geogra
phy," Khanna said. "Of course, there are re
search advantages, but there's also collabo
ration."
The Internet II project, composed of
more than 100 universities and research in
stitutions, will use network computing to

develop cutting-edge research and educa
tion opportunities. Project participants will
use the powerful connections to access su
percomputers, exchange information and
develop advanced scientific computing ap
plications.
Internet II is supported by the founda
tion's "very high speed Backbone Network
Service" (vBNS), which was developed in
conjunction with MCI. It is capable of trans
mitting 622 million bits per second. By 2000,
the foundation and MCI hope that new tech
nologies will allow the network to transmit
2.4 billion bits per second. In contrast,
today's averagp household modem transmits
28,800 bits per second.
According to the foundation, "the vBNS is
only available for meritorious high band
width uses and will not be used for general
Internet traffic," such as e-mail.
This new speed and power will create more
opportunities for exchanging information,
such as distributed workstation computing,
distributed massive datasets, the control of
remote instrumentation and multimedia col
laboration tools. The network will also sup
port remote access to supercomputers that

was previously unavailable because of the
"narrow pipes" the general Internet current
ly uses.
One of the advantages of such a large, fast
system is its ability to transmit images and
video much more efficiently. Thus, the new
system should permit "real time" video con
ferencing.
This prospect excites Khanna, who imag
ines a joint seminar program, where, "for ex
ample, faculty at MIT could use video-confer
encing to present lectures [at Stanford)."
Stuart Lynn, UC-Berkeley's associate vice
president and the project's principal investi
gator, told the San Francisco Chronicle that
the network will also give more students ac
cess to state-of-the-art research tools, such as
a sophisticated electron microscope at the
UC-Kiverside campus.
Khanna also said Stanford will be working
on the University's internal system. The in
ternal upgrades will use Stanford funds
rather than the foundation's grant.
"We're currently transmitting at 100
megabits per second, and we'd like to im
prove that to 622 megabits per second,"
Khanna said.
