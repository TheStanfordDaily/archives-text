# Phone Axess lets students get grades
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Students without summer Internet access
no longer have to rely on the U.S. Postal Ser
vice to deliver their grades. Students can ac
cess their grades through a new feature called
phone Axess bv dialing 725-AXES or 725-
2937.
"When students leave campus, sometimes,
they're going where they don't have a computer,

hut they're still anxious about whnt their grades
are," said Registrar Roger Printup.
Graduating seniors will also he able to bene
fit from this new service. Beginning 8 a.m. on
June 13, they can call the number to see if they
have completed their requirements for gradua
tion.
To access the system, students would enter
their Stanford ID numbers followed by their
PIN, similar to the online AXKSS program.
Although accessing grades and degree coin

plction are the new system's only current func
tions, Printup said he would like to expand it.
"We'll certainly be interested in student re
sponse to see if we could extend other functions
for this system," Printup said.
However, he said there will be many other
functions that phone Axess cannot replace, such
as entering demographic information.
Students will still receive their grades through
the mail this summer, but Printup said he hopes
the this system will eventually N> eliminated.
