# Residential Computing to be reorganized under SUL
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Residential Computing will become
part of the Stanford University Libraries
Sept. 1, increasing its academic influence
and financial stability from its current
status under the Office of Residential Ed
ucation.
"We see that there are a lot of benefits
in moving to the library system," said Res
Comp Director Jeff Merriman.
In addition to the reorganization, Mer
riman also said Res Comp will make avail
able computers that run Windows 95 or
Windows NT next year in major dorm
clusters, in an effort to reach out to per
sonal computer users.
Move to libraries
Merriman said he feels that Res Comp,
which formerly operated as part of Res
Ed, will be able to provide more academic
resources to students by acting as a sub
sidiary branch of the library.
"This will hopefully give us a stronger
academic voice," said Merriman, as Res
Comp will now have much closer connec
tions to the academic component of the
University. "We hope to restore linkages
with faculty and have a role in influencing
how technology is being used in teaching
and learning."
Karen Nagy, the deputy University li
brarian, said she hopes the new partner
ship will lead to a number of new pro
grams, such as increased resident com
puting coordinator training about such li
brary resources as Socrates and Folio.
"For example, when Writing and Crit
ical Thinking and CIV classes have li
brary orientation, we can keep RCCs in
formed about the type of instruction to
give at the dorm level," she said.
Another benefit Nagy cited was the in
creased interaction with students that
Res Comp will allow the libraries to have.
"We don't often hear the voice of the
student, especially the undergraduate,
about what is needed," she said. "This
will give more of a student voice."
"For undergraduates, Res Comp has
become a primary computing resource,"
he said, adding that this is not always the
case.
The first residential cluster of any sort
was not installed until 1984 in Roble Hall.
Also, the first in-room Internet connec

tions were not offered until 1988, in
Rains Houses, and it was not until 1993
— when this year's seniors entered as
freshmen — that every residence had
some sort of a cluster.
Res Comp has grown quickly without
any sort of master plan, according to Mer
riman, thanks in large part to donations
from companies such as Apple, IBM and
Digital. During the budget cuts of the
early 19905, the relatively new depart
ment was hit hard, experiencing a num
ber of cutbacks even as it was utilized by
more students.
Making Res Comp part of the library
structure will give it stability as part of
a generally funded area with more of a
voice with the University, Merriman
said
Nagy agreed, saying that "because [li
braries! and Information Technology
Systems and Services are the central com
puting organizations, we have a strong
voice about forecasting models and
what's needed on campus. It gives Res
Comp stability."
As an example of how the move will
help Res Comp have a stronger voice,
Nagy cited the need to battle misconcep
tions such as the often-held belief that as
increasing numbers of students have
computers of their own, the need for resi
dence computer clusters will decrease.
"This is simply not the case," she said.
"There is still a need for higher-end com
puters, because many students have com
puters that are a generation old," while
every computer in the residences is re
placed on a three-year cycle.
Also, as part of a larger organization,
Nagy said Res Comp will not have to
worry as much about funding problems.
"Since we're a larger organization, we
have more flexibility with our budgets,"
she said.
Due to the budgetary stability, Merri
man said he did not anticipate another in
crease in in-room connection fees next
year. Last year, Res Comp raised the fee
to $45, up from $30 and $10 in the previ
ous two years.
Merriman said the only concern he had
about the move was that RCCs may have
more responsibilities as more programs
are implemented due to the partnership
with libraries.
"We need to make sure we do this in a
way that does not add to the RCC work

load," he said, citing larger in-room con
nection subscription rates as the
reason that the RCC workload is increas
ing.
Nagy added that she wanted to make
sure that Res Comp and Res Ed kept their
strong relationship.
"Res Comp is still going to be a service
provider for Res Ed," she said.
Networking support
Merriman also said ITSS had reaf
firmed its support of Res Comp by agree
ing to fund and support the in-room con
nections network more than in the past.
While he said ITSS and Res Comp have al
ways had "an incredibly great relation
ship," he said the degree of ITSS support
for the connections has changed over the
years.
Nagy said ITSS has committed to take
a much larger role with the connections.
"ITSS will take care of the network
connectivity clear through to the face
plate in the wall," she said. "Before, Res
Comp took care of much of what went on
in the individual dorms."
Chip Haven, the acting director of net
working systems, said that as the net
work has grown, funding has become
more and more of an issue.
"Budgeting has always provided for
the original equipment," he said. "The
problem is that there has not been any
(budgeted) funding for maintenance and
upgrade."
As a result, many dormitories now
have outdated in-room connections and
equipment. For example, the connections
in Rains, not updated since they were in
stalled, are 10 years old — a technological
eternity.
Haven said that he hopes Information
Technology Systems and Services will re
ceive a budget of abouts3oo,ooo per year
to pay for a cycle of replacing the net
working equipment in every dormitory
once every five years. In addition, he said
it is not clear how "spare parts and the
people" would be funded on top of the an
nual $300,000. He said he expected this to
be determined by the fall.
The PC increase
Finally, Merriman said Res Comp has
committed itself to providing a multi
platform environment in each dorm clus
ter, so students will have both Macintosh

and Windows systems at their disposal.
"If you're a PC user, it would be nice if
there is a PC in your cluster," Merriman
said.
Merriman hopes to have a "Wintel"
machine — Windows 95 or Windows NT
running on a Intel computer — in every
large dorm cluster by the fall. However,
whether this happens depends in large
part on a grant proposal submitted by
Stanford to Intel Corp.
"This is still up in the air," he said.
If the grant does not come through,
Merriman said Res Comp will look at
other, software-based alternatives to pro
vide a Windows platform in the clusters,
for now.
This possible move was applauded by
several of next year's RCCs.
"Through this change, students will
not have to be as worried about the for
mat of their disk or where they can print
their Word for Windows files," said Ben

Chelf, next year's RCC in Twain.
According to statistics from the recent
residence survey, PCs and Macintosh
computers are used in almost equal num
bers on campus among first-year stu
dents, and PC ownership may be gaining
on Macintosh ownership. Of the 4(5.9 per
cent of first-year students who indicated
that they planned on buying a computer,
21.1 percent said they would buy a Mac
intosh or a Macintosh-compatible com
puter, while 25.1 percent said they would
by a PC-compatible computer.
Hobby Lee, next year's RCC in liran
ner and a computer science coterminal
student, said the switch is necessary.
"In today's computing world, we can
no longer ignore the market dominance of
PC's running the Windows operating sys
tem," Lee said. "I think it's an excellent
decision for Res Comp to start supporting
the PC, which is the platform of choice
outside of Stanford."

for now.
This possible move was applauded by
several of next year's RCCs.
"Through this change, students will
not have to be as worried about the for
mat of their disk or where they can print
their Word for Windows files," said Ben

Chelf, next year's RCC in Twain.
According to statistics from the recent
residence survey, PCs and Macintosh
computers are used in almost equal num
bers on campus among first-year stu
dents, and PC ownership may be gaining
on Macintosh ownership. Of the 4(5.9 per
cent of first-year students who indicated
that they planned on buying a computer,
21.1 percent said they would buy a Mac
intosh or a Macintosh-compatible com
puter, while 25.1 percent said they would
by a PC-compatible computer.
Hobby Lee, next year's RCC in liran
ner and a computer science coterminal
student, said the switch is necessary.
"In today's computing world, we can
no longer ignore the market dominance of
PC's running the Windows operating sys
tem," Lee said. "I think it's an excellent
decision for Res Comp to start supporting
the PC, which is the platform of choice
outside of Stanford."
