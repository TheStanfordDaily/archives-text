## A
						sentimental journey through Palm Drive and beyond

"Long may 11] run."
— Neil Young
As I sit in front of the computer
screen, bathed in the glow of blue
light, a single crystalline tear falls
down the smooth planes of my face and
drops on my gently heaving bosom! Myr
iad thoughts of my years at Stanford fill
my mind — the lessons I have learned,
the adventures I have had and, most
important, the friends I have made (both
of them)!
As a graduating senior, I feel com
pelled — nay, morally obligated (wink,
wink, Casper) — to share the pearls of
wisdom I have gathered during my time
as a student! And as a Daily reporter, I
have the forum to do so! Ah, Daily! At
special times like this, it's more than a
vehicle for printing photos of staffers'
dogs and birthday wishes for staffers'
roommates!

In order to include all the staples of a
farewell column, I'd like to break it down:
1. Gratuitous references, invariably
including alcohol, to my friends,
how cool they are and what ragin'
good times we've had together
Last weekend, around 4:20 in the
afternoon (hee, hee! 4:20! get it?!) my 27
best friends and I were whitewater raft in'
down the American River, drinkin'
brewskis and sunnin' ourselves. Sudden
ly, I realized what the meaning of life
was! It's really complicated to explain
here, so I'm not even going to try! Hut it
was so cool!
This revelation got me thinking! OK,
so I have made some social mistakes! In
fact, lots! But it's never too late to apolo
gize, right?! So, to all the people who have
had the experience of me accosting you
and proceeding to critique your personal
ity while I was totally drunk — sorry! I

didn't really mean it! To all the people
who have had the experience of me
accosting you and proceeding to critique
your personality while I was sober —
actually, never mind!
2. Nuggets of truth imparted to me
by wee ethnic children
At Menlo Oaks School, when I used to
show up to tutor little Jose (not his real
name, though this is a real story), he
would catch sight of me and run in the
other direction! Then I would chase him
around the playground until he disap
peared in the crowd of other kids! Then
he would leave on the bus! This taught
me a super-important lesson: I am not
good with kids! Good to know, huh?!?
Painfully forced similes and
metaphors
Yesterday, I was eating cereal for break
fast, and I thought how Stanford is like a

raisin — it's brown and wrinkly but
sweet inside. Then I went to the comput
er cluster and thought how Stanford is
like e-mail — you're always expecting
something momentous, but mostly it's
just messages from the Women's Coali
tion list! In fact, the most momentous
thing that happens is that you come
home from a party plastered and send
really incriminating messages declaring
your love to boys who think you're a
loser! Then it occurred to me that maybe
this simile doesn't apply! Then I was
walking to class and I thought how
Hoover Tower is like a big penis! Then I
laughed because, you know, penises are
funny!
4. Tributes to Daily columnists past
I saw some squirrels this morning! Then
I masturbated! Then 1 went back and sat
in my room in the Deke house and
thought about how I hate everyone! Then

I masturbated some more! Then I mas
turbated again!
5. The future
Right now, I have so many questions!
Like, what comes next?! Why will no one
hire me?! If I use a tampon, will I still be
a virgin?! It's impossible to know every
thing, but time will tell! And meanwhile,
I have not only my Stanford degree, but I
also have the love and affection of many
wonderful people! So, thank you,
Mommy, Daddy, Nicky, Bitty, Winnie,
Pookie, Jesus Christ, all my fabulous sis
ters in KD (the only sorority that's really
not like a sorority!) and The Daily! With
out your support, I could never have
become the woman I am today! =)
