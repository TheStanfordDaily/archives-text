# ROUND UP â€“ THE YEAR IN REVIEW
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
This has been, in many people's minds, some
thing of a year for Stanford. Looking back, adminis
trators, faculty and students have all faced a lot of
challenges, but their heroic efforts have finally,
after much struggle, succeeded in bringing us 365
days closer to the 21st century.
Students spent several of those days in line at
the various new eateries in Tresiddet Union, includ
ing the actual Polio's that has replaced the poten
tial Taco Bell that students had been hoping for
since who knows when.
Tresidder also got a Jamba Juice, an establish
ment specializing in in covincmg people that they
can take a blender and make a meal out of some
thing you would normally call a drink, something
you would normally call a dessert and a whole
bunch of things you would not normally eat at all.
The academic side of things didn't exactly make
it through the year unaltered. The biggest change
of course, was changing the current CIV program
to a two-plus-one format.

This caused great consternation because stu
dents thought the change would lead to an
increased math requirement in CIV. The concern
was largely allayed when students were assured
that even freshmen who insist that two plus one
equals four are guaranteed some kind of a B.
The year has also seen a major personnel
change. Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya has been around for
so long that every undergraduate at Stanford has
been admitted on his watch.
As a result, the administration decided to hold
Montoya responsible for the mess resulting from all
the lunatics he's admitted. He has therefore been
promoted to vice provost for student affairs and
will be in charge of making sure all those under
graduate lunatics behave themselves.
These are only a few of the changes that have
made the Farm (we hope and trust) a better place
to live. However, there are still refreshing signs of
continuity. The most remarkable of these is that,
exactly a year ago today, the date was precisely the
same as it is now. It's good to know some good
things go on.
