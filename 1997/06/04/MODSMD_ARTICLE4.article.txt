# Dining Services accused of worker mistreatment by union
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Union officials are involved in an ongoing dispute with
Housing and Dining Services over hiring practices, with the
union claiming regular jobs are being lost to temporary work
ers, a charge vigorously denied by Dining Services officials.
According to Lenny Mcßride, a field representative of Unit
ed Stanford Workers, Dining Services is one of several parts of
the University that hire temporary workers and contractors
for what are essentially permanent jobs. Such workers are not
union members and not subject to union wage or benefit
scales.
The collective bargaining agreement between the Universi
ty and the union says anyone working "at least 20 hours a week

for a period actually lasting at least four months" is a "regular
staff" worker and is therefore subject to the union agreement.
Mcßride alleged that Dining Services regularly evades the
definition of "regular staff" by hiring workers for four months,
dismissing them temporarily and rehiring them, a practice he
called "outrageous."
Melanie Jones-Carter, the operations manager for Dining
Services, denied that any such practices were in place, calling
the allegation "absolutely not correct."
She said employees working fewer than 20 hours a week
were used "to fill vacancies created by absences, illness, vaca
tion, restricted work duties and seasonal changes."
She added that Dining Services employs 300 to 550 stu-

dents, some of t hem Stanford stu
dents earning a minimum of $7.97
an hour, and some outside stu
dents making a minimum of $5.60,
which is still more than the legal
minimum wage.
In addition, she said, there are
130 full time non-clerical employ
ees and 25 to 30 workers hired
through a temporary agency to
work on a contingency basis, often
because student employees have
less time to work during finals and
midterms.
However, Ronald Taylor, the
union's chief shop steward who
works in Housing and Dining
maintenance at Stanford, con
firmed Mcßride's view that tem
porary workers were holding per
manent jobs.
"There are people who've been
out there for years in temporary
positions," Taylor said.
Rafael Nendel-Flores, a sopho
more who is a head hasher for
Murray and Yost dining halls, said
he was acquainted with several
workers who were hired through
the Manpower Temporary Ser
vices and yet had worked regular 1\
for well over four months.
"They know the schedules;
they're in there every day," Nen
del-Flores said.
He also said he could only recall
one instance of a temporary work
er showing up for contingency
work. According to Nendel-Flo
res, his dining hall consistently
employs fewer student workers
than its capacity, especially this
year.
He added that one employee he
knows well, whom he declined to
name, had worked for an extended
period for Manpower and the I *ni
versitv at the same time. nfTiriallv

working 20 hours a week for each
hut in effect doing the same job 40
hours a week.
Nendel-Flores said many work
ers he knew were anxious to obtain
the benefits of permanent employ
ment but had not been able to se
cure such a status.
Although such workers are in
effect permanent, Mcßride said, a
worker being paid $7 an hour as a
temporary worker or contractor
might, receive $15 per hour if he
were a permanent union employ
ee, and that temporary employees
do not receive any of the health
and other benefits of union work
ers.
Mcßride rejected any idea that
the hiring of temporary workers
was necessary to keep Dining Ser
vices financially healthy.
"It's not like Stanford is a
struggling university, and what
they're doing to the workers is out
rageous ... It's people's lives,
that's the bottom line," Mcßride
said.
He added t hat t he hiring of tem
porary labor for permanent jobs
was "a threat to other workers"
and undermined their bargaining
posit ion.
The union has been making ef
forts for several years to have the
temporary positions made into
permanent ones but has no way of
making Dining Services negotiate
on the subject and therefore "has
not made dent," Mcßride said, al
f hough he said he had been able in
a few instances to have temporary
workers hired as regular staff.
According to Jones-Carter,
"when a pet manent staff position
is required, it is always filled by
permanent ongoing staff, not a
temporary who comes and goes."
Jones Carter added, "We hire
in accordance with the terms of
the union agreement in terms of
hot h the spirit and the letterof the
agreement
