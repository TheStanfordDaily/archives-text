# Asian fellows 'Treated' to Bay Area tour
## 
### Julia Beeson 
For many Stanford students, contact with Asian
culture may be limited to Chinese night at Wilbur
Dining Hall. But for the seven Stanford Treat Fel
lows, the Asian experience goes much deeper.
Selected in the fall, Treat Fellows help host stu
dents visiting from Asia each quarter. The fellows
will later travel to Asia this September for a two
week study of the region.
The Treat Fellows' two-week study / travel sem
inar in Asia will give the Asian participants an op
portunity to reciprocate hospitality and introduce
their own culture.
Gaylen Flint, co-director of the Trans-Pacific
Exchange, the group that oversees the Treat Fel
lows, feels that the most valuable experience the
students learn is the "first-hand knowledge of the
Asian students."
"For many of the fellows, the Treat program is
their first and only way of getting in touch with
Asia," Flint said.
The Trans-Pacific Exchange is a division of Vol
unteers in Asia, a group that brings numerous
study groups from Asia to the United States each
year.
Nine students from Thailand and Singapore de
parted for home May 25, completing their two-week
visit to Stanford, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
The Asian students were from Chiang Mai Univer
sity in Thailand and the National University of Sin
gapore.
In the past, there have also been Japanese sci
ence and technology students, business students
from Singapore, Japanese women's university stu
dents and political science students from Thailand.
The Treat Fellowship involves studying the
countries from which the groups come, learning
cross-cultural skills and making use of the diverse
interests of the fellows to plan programs introduc
ing the Asian students to U.S. society.
As part of the program schedule, the Trans-Pa
cific Exchange arranged for the students to tour dif
ferent companies such as Intuit, a computer soft
ware company in Silicon Valley and ()dwalla Inc., a
natural juice company.
The students also toured San Francisco, the
Monterey Peninsula, Berkeley and the Stanford
area with Treat Fellows during their visit.
Both the Asian students and Treat Fellows said
the highlight of the visit was the discussion panels

hosted by the Treat Fellows

in the dormitories. Flint
credited the program

for giving the Treat
Fellows invaluable
leadership opportuni
ties.
"Although the actu
al process of hosting
the students has been

fun — teaching each
other new words, telling

stories about our families — the best times I've had
have involved arguing about foreign policy or rec
ognizing misunderstandings about each other's
cultures," said Treat Fellow Shawn Salmon, a ju
nior.
As much as the fellows study the policies of each
country, they still bring biases to the exchange,
Salmon said. Similarly, she said that visiting students
come with media-influenced images of America.
"Much of the fun of hosting is seeing how our col
lective biases and images change when in contact
with the new culture," Salmon said.
Salmon first learned about the Treat Fellowship
after talking with Volunteers in Asia representa
tives at MuFuUnSun, an Orientation annual fair
— during which different organizations on campus
publicize their group and try to recruit students.
Earlier this quarter, the Treat Fellows organized
a discussion panel on race and diversity in the Unit-

Ed States. They discussed some of the stereotypes
and the prejudices that are present in the United
States and Asia.
The panel began with an ice-breaker in which
every student had to state a stereotype common
about his respective countries.
Students from Singapore discussed the stereo
types that often confront them, such as the miscon
ception that Singaporeans are "too practical and
not creative."
Students from Thailand discussed the stereo
types that surround their country, such as Thai
land is generally "still developing and poor."
Freshman Kathy Steel said what she likes being
able to see the students again a few months after
hosting them.
"It's fun to just talk to visiting students about
what they do in their countries and what some of
the differences are between our lives," Steel said.
