## Theft suspect missing after run into lake 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
Police are still looking for an unidentified suspected
bicycle thief that disappeared into Lake Lagunita early
Monday morning after having been chased there by
Stanford police officers.
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department
searched the lake extensively yesterday but has called
off the lake search without finding any substantive ev
idence.
"A search of the lake didn't turn anybody up — just
the suspect's jacket," said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. "We suspect he got away and so are current
ly working on some other leads."
Peter Ligotti, a senior who is a focus assistant in
Yost, called the police at about 2:30 a.m. when he saw
a suspicious man crouching in the bike racks. He had
pulled up to the racks on his motorcycle and noticed an
object like a large garbage bag about two feet away
from him. "When realized it was a person hunched up
in a ball, I tried to walk away as normally as possible,"
said Ligotti. "I went inside to the pay phone and called
911."
After deputies arrived on the scene, the suspect ran
away toward the lake. The police radioed for assistance
and then chased the assailant, who, on encountering
the perimeter of the lake and seeing no other way out,
decided to enter it.
As the suspect backed farther and farther into the
deep recess of the lake, Stanford Police Deputy Ken
Bates, one of the first to arrive on the scene, tried to ne
gotiate with him.
The suspect, however, refused to exit the lake, threw
off his jacket and soon found himself almost complete
ly immersed in water until he finally disappeared.
"He kept backing into deeper water," said Niemey
er. "At one point, the water reached his neck level."
By this time, however, Stanford police officers
had set up a mild perimeter around the lake. The
suspect, however, did not seem to resurface after dis
appearing.
The individual is only described as a white male.
Stanford police suspect that this man is responsible for
a rash of recent expensive bicycle thefts that have oc
curred in the vicinity of the lake, said Niemeyer.
"We found some huge, hydraulic lock-destroying de
vice near where the suspect started to run away," said
Niemeyer.
"Also, this man seems to fit the description of the
supposed bicycle thief," added Niemeyer.
For once, Niemeyer hopes that the culprit escaped.
"I'm hoping that the individual did not succumb,
but rather got away," said Niemeyer. "For one time I'm
rooting for the bad guy."
