# College World Series
## Stanford pounded 10-5 by Tigers' power stroke LSU hitters overwhelm Cardinal pitching 
### Jennifer Splansky Staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Sometimes
things just don't go your way. No
matter how hard you play, the
other team is just having a better
day.
That is the only way to explain
the Stanford baseball team's (44-
19) 10-5 loss Sunday to the
Louisiana State Tigers (55-13) at
the College World Series.
Stanford, the No. 3 seed, beat
sixth-seeded Auburn (then 49-
16) 8-3 Friday in the tournament
opener and lost in its second
game on Sunday to the No. 2 seed
and defending NCAA champs,
LSU. That left the Cardinal still
alive in the double-elimination
national championship but with
a harder road to reach the cham
pionship game. Stanford faced
Auburn in a rematch yesterday to
stay alive.
The game against LSU was
simply a hitting clinic by the na
tional champs, who drilled five
home runs en route to the 10-5
victory.
"They gave us a good beating
today," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't give
them anything. It was hard to
contain their power; they are a
great team."
LSU's five home runs give the
Tigers a record 184 homers on
the season, crushing the old
NCAA record of 161 set by
Brigham Young in 1988. Stan
ford has hit 99 long balls this sea
son, breaking its old record of 93
set in 1990. Nine Tigers have
more than 10 home runs, and five
have 15 or more. LSU has home
red in every game this season,
and every member of the squad
has homered at least once.
Junior college transfer Bran
don Larson leads the LSU squad
with 40 home runs, two coming
against the Cardinal in Sunday's
game. The Tiger shortstop be
came the fourth player in NCAA
history to hit 40 homers in a sea
son by going 3-for-5 with three
RBIs and three runs scored. Lar
son and junior first baseman
Eddy Furniss hit back-to-back

bombs in the fifth inning. Junior
left fielder Wes Davis and sopho
more catcher Clint Earnhart also
drove balls out of the park in
LSU's five-home-run perfor
mance which ties the CWS
record.
Lost in the offensive hoopla
was an outstanding pitching per
formance for LSU by AU-Ameri
can junior Patrick Coogan (14-3).
Coogan threw 7 1/3 innings
against the Cardinal, keeping
Stanford off balance all day.
"He just shut us down," said
junior catcher Jon Schaeffer,
who had two RBIs, with a run
scoring single in the eighth in
ning. "We couldn't get anything
going. I give the credit to him."
While Coogan pitched bril
liantly, Stanford junior Kyle Pe
terson (11-3) had an uncharac
teristically poor outing. The ace
gave up seven earned runs and
nine hits in five innings. The
Omaha native did not have the
typical control and movement on
his pitches. But regardless of Pe
terson's pitching, LSU simply hit
phenomenally.
"They hit my good pitches, and
they hit my bad pitches," Peter
son said. "Sometimes you just
have to shake your head and
move on."
Peterson did not help his cause
by walking the first batter of the
ballgame and hitting the second.
Larson followed with an RBI sin
gle and was later driven in by
Furniss' single. Junior center
fielder Mike Koerner followed
with a standup double, and Fur
niss scored on a sacrifice
grounder by sophomore third
baseman Trey McClure. By the
end of the first inning, LSU was
up 3-0.
Peterson lamented his atypi
cal control problems, which set
the table for the Tigers.
"It got to me early," Peterson
said. "I give them credit though.
It is hard for my offense to fight
uphill the whole way, and I take
responsibility for that."
The Cardinal was never able to
catch up to the LSU firepower.
No Cardinal player had more
than one hit, and Stanford's big

guns in the three and four spots
were 1-for-15 in the first two
games of the tournament.
After the three-run first in
ning, LSU put two on the board
in the fourth and two more in the
fifth. Sophomore lefty Tony
Cogan came on in relief in the
sixth inning and allowed two
runs in the seventh and one in
the eighth. Junior southpaw Josh
Koons closed out the game pitch
ing a scoreless ninth.
The Cardinal chipped away at
the LSU lead with two runs in the
fifth. Freshman designated hit
ter John Gall led off with a walk,
and sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut followed with a
standup double to the right-field
corner, moving Gall to third. Se
nior first baseman Luke Quaccia
came through with an RBI single
to left, scoring Gall and moving
Gerut to third. Gerut scored on
sophomore Omaha native and
second baseman Tony Schrager's
sacrifice fly to center field.
With three runs in the bottom
of the eighth, Stanford closed the
gap to 10-5. The Card, however,
came no closer to victory.
But Stanford is never ready to
throw in the towel.
"We have battled back all
year," Peterson said. "It is wrong
to think this team is out of it. No
one said it would be easy."
In the game prior to the LSU
battle, Stanford had an easier
time with Auburn. In fashion op
posite from Sunday's battle, the
Card relied on pitching all game
long. Sophomore starter Chad
Hutchinson (8-3) earned the win,
pitching out of many jams and
close encounters, but sophomore
reliever Jeff Austin earned his
fourth save and stole the show.
With the bases loaded and no outs
in the sixth inning, Austin came
in and didn't allow any runs after
a Schrager error.
"I like to play in those situa
tions," Austin said. "I like to
come in fired up."
Austin struck out five Tigers
and allowed only two hits.
"Austin pitched a whale of a
game," Marquess said.
Auburn had plenty of scoring
opportunities but could not con
vert them into runs.
"We had opportunities, but
Hutchison and Austin were ter
rific," said Auburn bead coach
Hal Baird. "We just couldn't
solve them."
Stanford's pitching shut down
Auburn's star center fielder, Tim
Hudson. Hudson, who was bat
ting .404 with 17 home runs and
87 RBIs, went 0-for-5. The first
five batters in the Tiger lineup
were 1-for-19 on the day, and
Auburn went 0-for-13 with men
in scoring position en route to
leaving 14 runners on base.
The Cardinal offense was well
balanced all day, with all but two
of Stanford's batters getting hits.
Quaccia went 3-for-4 with two
runs scored. Gall, freshman right
fielder Edmund Muth and junior
shortstop Jay Pecci each had two
hits. Pecci also played phenome
nal defense all day long with five
assists and no errors.
Stanford's big inning came in
the fifth when the Cardinal
scored five runs. Quaccia led off
with a single to center and moved
to third on Pecci's single. Junior
left fielder Joe Kilburg followed
with a line-drive single to left,
scoring Quaccia. Muth drove in
Pecci with a single up the middle.
Sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang bounced the ball by
third baseman Chad Wandall for

an error, scoring Kilburg. Muth
scored on a sacrifice fly by Scha
effer, and Gall followed with a
single to right. Gerut then skied a
high fly ball, which led the
Auburn center fielder, second
baseman and shortstop to collide
as Gerut's ball fell, scoring
Hochgesang.
Stanford added two more in
surance runs in the bottom of the
eighth and held on to win 8-3, hut
Auburn battled back to beat Rice
10-1 and force yesterday's re
match.

OMAHA, Neb. — Sometimes

That is the only way to explain
the Stanford baseball team's (44-

the LSU lead with two runs in the
fifth. Freshman designated hit
ter John Gall led off with a walk,
and sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut followed with a
standup double to the right-field
corner, moving Gall to third. Se
nior first baseman Luke Quaccia
came through with an RBI single
to left, scoring Gall and moving
Gerut to third. Gerut scored on
sophomore Omaha native and
second baseman Tony Schrager's
sacrifice fly to center field.
With three runs in the bottom
of the eighth, Stanford closed the
gap to 10-5. The Card, however,
came no closer to victory.
But Stanford is never ready to
throw in the towel.
"We have battled back all
year," Peterson said. "It is wrong
to think this team is out of it. No
one said it would be easy."
In the game prior to the LSU
battle, Stanford had an easier
time with Auburn. In fashion op
posite from Sunday's battle, the
Card relied on pitching all game
long. Sophomore starter Chad
Hutchinson (8-3) earned the win,
pitching out of many jams and
close encounters, but sophomore
reliever Jeff Austin earned his
fourth save and stole the show.
With the bases loaded and no outs
in the sixth inning, Austin came
in and didn't allow any runs after
a Schrager error.
"I like to play in those situa
tions," Austin said. "I like to
come in fired up."
Austin struck out five Tigers
and allowed only two hits.
"Austin pitched a whale of a
game," Marquess said.
Auburn had plenty of scoring
opportunities but could not con
vert them into runs.
"We had opportunities, but
Hutchison and Austin were ter
rific," said Auburn bead coach
Hal Baird. "We just couldn't
solve them."
Stanford's pitching shut down
Auburn's star center fielder, Tim
Hudson. Hudson, who was bat
ting .404 with 17 home runs and
87 RBIs, went 0-for-5. The first
five batters in the Tiger lineup
were 1-for-19 on the day, and
Auburn went 0-for-13 with men
in scoring position en route to
leaving 14 runners on base.
The Cardinal offense was well
balanced all day, with all but two
of Stanford's batters getting hits.
Quaccia went 3-for-4 with two
runs scored. Gall, freshman right
fielder Edmund Muth and junior
shortstop Jay Pecci each had two
hits. Pecci also played phenome
nal defense all day long with five
assists and no errors.
Stanford's big inning came in
the fifth when the Cardinal
scored five runs. Quaccia led off
with a single to center and moved
to third on Pecci's single. Junior
left fielder Joe Kilburg followed
with a line-drive single to left,
scoring Quaccia. Muth drove in
Pecci with a single up the middle.
Sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang bounced the ball by
third baseman Chad Wandall for

an error, scoring Kilburg. Muth
scored on a sacrifice fly by Scha
effer, and Gall followed with a
single to right. Gerut then skied a
high fly ball, which led the
Auburn center fielder, second
baseman and shortstop to collide
as Gerut's ball fell, scoring
Hochgesang.
Stanford added two more in
surance runs in the bottom of the
eighth and held on to win 8-3, hut
Auburn battled back to beat Rice
10-1 and force yesterday's re
match.

OMAHA, Neb. — Sometimes
things just don't go your way. No
matter how hard you play, the
other team is just having a better
day.
That is the only way to explain
the Stanford baseball team's (44-
19) 10-5 loss Sunday to the
Louisiana State Tigers (55-13) at
the College World Series.
Stanford, the No. 3 seed, beat
sixth-seeded Auburn (then 49-
16) 8-3 Friday in the tournament
opener and lost in its second
game on Sunday to the No. 2 seed
and defending NCAA champs,
LSU. That left the Cardinal still
alive in the double-elimination
national championship but with
a harder road to reach the cham
pionship game. Stanford faced
Auburn in a rematch yesterday to
stay alive.
The game against LSU was
simply a hitting clinic by the na
tional champs, who drilled five
home runs en route to the 10-5
victory.
"They gave us a good beating
today," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't give
them anything. It was hard to
contain their power; they are a
great team."
LSU's five home runs give the
Tigers a record 184 homers on
the season, crushing the old
NCAA record of 161 set by
Brigham Young in 1988. Stan
ford has hit 99 long balls this sea
son, breaking its old record of 93
set in 1990. Nine Tigers have
more than 10 home runs, and five
have 15 or more. LSU has home
red in every game this season,
and every member of the squad
has homered at least once.
Junior college transfer Bran
don Larson leads the LSU squad
with 40 home runs, two coming
against the Cardinal in Sunday's
game. The Tiger shortstop be
came the fourth player in NCAA
history to hit 40 homers in a sea
son by going 3-for-5 with three
RBIs and three runs scored. Lar
son and junior first baseman
Eddy Furniss hit back-to-back

bombs in the fifth inning. Junior
left fielder Wes Davis and sopho
more catcher Clint Earnhart also
drove balls out of the park in
LSU's five-home-run perfor
mance which ties the CWS
record.
Lost in the offensive hoopla
was an outstanding pitching per
formance for LSU by AU-Ameri
can junior Patrick Coogan (14-3).
Coogan threw 7 1/3 innings
against the Cardinal, keeping
Stanford off balance all day.
"He just shut us down," said
junior catcher Jon Schaeffer,
who had two RBIs, with a run
scoring single in the eighth in
ning. "We couldn't get anything
going. I give the credit to him."
While Coogan pitched bril
liantly, Stanford junior Kyle Pe
terson (11-3) had an uncharac
teristically poor outing. The ace
gave up seven earned runs and
nine hits in five innings. The
Omaha native did not have the
typical control and movement on
his pitches. But regardless of Pe
terson's pitching, LSU simply hit
phenomenally.
"They hit my good pitches, and
they hit my bad pitches," Peter
son said. "Sometimes you just
have to shake your head and
move on."
Peterson did not help his cause
by walking the first batter of the
ballgame and hitting the second.
Larson followed with an RBI sin
gle and was later driven in by
Furniss' single. Junior center
fielder Mike Koerner followed
with a standup double, and Fur
niss scored on a sacrifice
grounder by sophomore third
baseman Trey McClure. By the
end of the first inning, LSU was
up 3-0.
Peterson lamented his atypi
cal control problems, which set
the table for the Tigers.
"It got to me early," Peterson
said. "I give them credit though.
It is hard for my offense to fight
uphill the whole way, and I take
responsibility for that."
The Cardinal was never able to
catch up to the LSU firepower.
No Cardinal player had more
than one hit, and Stanford's big

guns in the three and four spots
were 1-for-15 in the first two
games of the tournament.
After the three-run first in
ning, LSU put two on the board
in the fourth and two more in the
fifth. Sophomore lefty Tony
Cogan came on in relief in the
sixth inning and allowed two
runs in the seventh and one in
the eighth. Junior southpaw Josh
Koons closed out the game pitch
ing a scoreless ninth.
The Cardinal chipped away at
the LSU lead with two runs in the
fifth. Freshman designated hit
ter John Gall led off with a walk,
and sophomore center fielder
Jody Gerut followed with a
standup double to the right-field
corner, moving Gall to third. Se
nior first baseman Luke Quaccia
came through with an RBI single
to left, scoring Gall and moving
Gerut to third. Gerut scored on
sophomore Omaha native and
second baseman Tony Schrager's
sacrifice fly to center field.
With three runs in the bottom
of the eighth, Stanford closed the
gap to 10-5. The Card, however,
came no closer to victory.
But Stanford is never ready to
throw in the towel.
"We have battled back all
year," Peterson said. "It is wrong
to think this team is out of it. No
one said it would be easy."
In the game prior to the LSU
battle, Stanford had an easier
time with Auburn. In fashion op
posite from Sunday's battle, the
Card relied on pitching all game
long. Sophomore starter Chad
Hutchinson (8-3) earned the win,
pitching out of many jams and
close encounters, but sophomore
reliever Jeff Austin earned his
fourth save and stole the show.
With the bases loaded and no outs
in the sixth inning, Austin came
in and didn't allow any runs after
a Schrager error.
"I like to play in those situa
tions," Austin said. "I like to
come in fired up."
Austin struck out five Tigers
and allowed only two hits.
"Austin pitched a whale of a
game," Marquess said.
Auburn had plenty of scoring
opportunities but could not con
vert them into runs.
"We had opportunities, but
Hutchison and Austin were ter
rific," said Auburn bead coach
Hal Baird. "We just couldn't
solve them."
Stanford's pitching shut down
Auburn's star center fielder, Tim
Hudson. Hudson, who was bat
ting .404 with 17 home runs and
87 RBIs, went 0-for-5. The first
five batters in the Tiger lineup
were 1-for-19 on the day, and
Auburn went 0-for-13 with men
in scoring position en route to
leaving 14 runners on base.
The Cardinal offense was well
balanced all day, with all but two
of Stanford's batters getting hits.
Quaccia went 3-for-4 with two
runs scored. Gall, freshman right
fielder Edmund Muth and junior
shortstop Jay Pecci each had two
hits. Pecci also played phenome
nal defense all day long with five
assists and no errors.
Stanford's big inning came in
the fifth when the Cardinal
scored five runs. Quaccia led off
with a single to center and moved
to third on Pecci's single. Junior
left fielder Joe Kilburg followed
with a line-drive single to left,
scoring Quaccia. Muth drove in
Pecci with a single up the middle.
Sophomore third baseman Josh
Hochgesang bounced the ball by
third baseman Chad Wandall for

an error, scoring Kilburg. Muth
scored on a sacrifice fly by Scha
effer, and Gall followed with a
single to right. Gerut then skied a
high fly ball, which led the
Auburn center fielder, second
baseman and shortstop to collide
as Gerut's ball fell, scoring
Hochgesang.
Stanford added two more in
surance runs in the bottom of the
eighth and held on to win 8-3, hut
Auburn battled back to beat Rice
10-1 and force yesterday's re
match.
