OMAHA, Not). "Omaha: somewhere in mid
dle America." Counting Crows, "Omaha."
Most of t he Stanford baseball team would tell
you that the Counting Crown had it right. For most
players and fans, Omaha is an old cow town, an
anonymous Midwest berg whose Johnny Rosen
blatt Stadium located in the middle of Omaha's
old cattle processing neighborhood - becomes
host to the city's biggest sporting event every June.
But for three of t he Cardinal's corps, the voyage
to this sprawling city in a homecoming: to fresh
man reliever Brian Fearnow, sophomore second
baseman Tony Sehrager and junior starter Kyle
Peterson, Omaha is the town that gave them their
starts in baseball.
More precisely, it was Omaha's youth baseball
leagues that christened the three into the sport.
And the name behind those leagues belongs to
Sehrager's father, Marley.
Harley Sehrager and his Pacesetter Corp. do
nate more t ban $ 1 million every year to yout h I -it
tie League and Select League baseball. The result
has been thousands of children and teenagers
wearing uniforms wit h the name of the Schrager's
corporation across their chests and on their hats
and the transformation of "Sehrager'' into a
household name in ()maha.
"I played in the league for a few years,'
Sehrager said "There's been quite a few Division
I players that got their start on one of thePaceset*

ter teams, and one guy's signed wit It a t« ain in the
majors. It's a great opportunity."
Peterson and Kearnow also began on Pucesot
ter teams.
"Tony's dad is really influential in Omaha, a
real proponent of youth baseball," Peterson said.
Now that the household name has returned to
Omaha, the public eye has been t rained on him.
Reporters wait for Schrager outside t he Cardinal's
locker room and his :it bats arc replayed on the
evening news.
But Schrager says the scrutiny doesn't make
him nervous.
"It's exciting to be here," belaid. 'Hut I don t.
know that we're any more nervous than t he other
guys. I don't think the fact that we'r c I rum < >inaha
[juts any more added pre: .-lire on us
Fearnow agreed. "In f;u*t, it, might he good for
us," he said. "We've played on t hat field before, so
at least we know it bet ter than anyone el.se.'
But it is Peterson who claim.- the highest
Omaha following. His return to town ha- left a
trail of local reporters and news camerie in his
wake. People stop Peterson to shake his hand and
get autographs.
"people recognize me now, with all the cover
age," lie said. "It's different to go somewhere
where people point you out. It's fun
Still, Peterson, too, aid he doe n't feel any
extra pressure.
"There's not any more pre? .sure than at a nor-
mal World Series game," he said.
"It is more exciting, having lots
of friends and family in the
stands."
If Peterson and Schrager felt
the pressure, they won't admit it.
But the players haven't been at
their best. In two starts at second,
Schrager has hit a respectable 2-
for-6 with a run scored and an
RBI on a sacrifice fly. But he
dropped a double-play ball in the

opener for an error against
Auburn. And Peterson, in Sun
day's game against Louisiana
State, turned in the shortest start
of his career, pitching only live in
nings and giving up nine hits and
seven runs.
The three natives would never
blame their mistakes on their
homecoming nerves. But there
were four articles in the Omaha
World I lerald about Peterson the
day after his lackluster perfor
mance. Schrager's blown double
play was the teaser for Channel
s's sports report.
The natives nervous? Never.
