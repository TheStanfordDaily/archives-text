# TOP 10 SPORTS STORIES OF THE YEAR
## Mix of team, individual achievement highlights year 
### Robin Davidson, Brian Lee Alda Leu Editorial staff 
Every year, the Stanford athletic program pro
duces spectacular memories and standard-setting
performances. This year was different only in that it
raised the bar of expectation.
Pickingonly 10 defining moments could never cap
ture the breadth of athletic achievement here on the
Farm, but here's our best effort.
ISix national championships. Sports Illus
trated might think that UCIjA is the top "jock
school," but when the Cardinal men's tennis
team topped Georgia in the finals of the NCAA Cham
pionship to win a record-setting sixth national title
for the school, Stanford staked its claim as the most
elite athletic program in the nation. The previous
mark of five team championships was set three times,
twice by the Card in 1994-95 and 1991-92 and once by
UCLA a decade earlier.
Men's tennis added to a pile of titles already won
by men's and women's cross country, men's and
women's volleyball and women's tennis, the last com
ing in just a few days earlier. A seventh title is still a
possibility, with baseball competing for the College

World Series crown this week.
2 Starbird breaks career-scoring record.
Senior Kate Starbird secured her place in Stan
ford history and set a new standard in the
record books when she surpassed Val Whiting as
Stanford's all-time leading scorer. After a scorching
month of January when she averaged almost '29
points per game, Starbird's performance all but
guaranteed that she would break Whiting's mark of
2,077 points.
That night finally came against Washington on
Feb. 22. On Senior Night and against the team very
near her Tacoma, Wash., home, Starbird needed just
13 points to tie Whiting's record. And that's how
many she had heading to the locker room at halftime.
Just under two minutes into the second period, Star
bird made the basket and was fouled, sending herself
to the free throw line and sending the sellout crowd
into a frenzy.
Starbird ended her career with a third-straight
trip to the Final Four, the Naismith national player of
the year award and the records for most points in a ca
reer (2,215), a season (753) and a single game (44).
3 Stanford well-represented in Olympics.
Stanford athletes, past and present, and coach
es racked up 22 medals at the summer Olympics
in Atlanta. Stanford tallied 18 gold medals, two silver
and two bronze — more than Australia, Great Britain
or South Korea.
Among the current Stanford athletes were: senior
Mike Lambert (volleyball), junior Sean McClain
(fencing) and freshman Catherine Fox (swimming).
Stanford coaches Tara VanDerveer (women's basket
ball), Skip Kenney (men's swimming) and Sherry
Posthumus and Zoran Tulum (fencing) also con
tributed to the United States' dominating perfor
mance.
4 Resurgence of Cardinal football. The finish
was amazingly improbable. After a dismal 2-5
start, bowl hopes seemed ludicrously over-am
bitious. However, a remarkable four-game winning
streak, capped by a Rig Game win at Berkeley, sent
Stanford on to its second-consecutive postseason
game.
And while the regular season finish was enough to
satisfy most fans, Pacific 10 Conference coach of the
year Tyrone Willingham brought his troops to the
Sun Bowl in F1 Paso, Texas, hungry. The Card didn't
disappoint anyone but Michigan State, crushing the
Spartans 38-0 on New Year's Eve. The bowl win was
Stanford's first since 1993, and the shutout was the
first since the Card blanked Oregon in 1974.
sBasketball5 Basketball advances to first-ever Sweet
16. A breakdown at the end of the season near
ly cost the Cardinal an at-large bid in to the Pig
Dance. However, a key 81-80 win over eventual na
tional champ Arizona propelled Stanford into the
tourney as the six-seed in the West Region.
A win over Oklahoma in the first round brought
the Card up against three-seed Wake Forest and na

tional player of the year center Tim Duncan. Crafty
coaching by Mike Montgomery neutralized the
Demon Deacon's inside dominance and resulted in a
72-66 victory. In the Regional semifinals, Stanford
nearly pulled off a huge upset, taking two-seed Utah
into overtime on a clutch Brevin Knight three-poilit
er in the waning seconds but eventually falling to the
Utes in the extra period.
6 Five-year reign of women's swimming
ends. The women's swimming and diving team,
after owning the national title for five years,
failed to extend its reign after turning in one of its
worst performances in years at nationals. Almost all
of the swimmers were off-par with one shining excep
tion in freshman and two-time Olympic gold medalist
Catherine Fox. She was the only Cardinal swimmer
to win any event — the 50-yard freestyle race and
100-yard backstroke.
Stanford fell to USC 406-395 despite being heavy
favorites; Stanford qualified 18 swimmers compared
to USC's 12 for the championship.
7 Stellar signings reload programs. Despite
this year's overall success, the future may hold
even bigger things with the signing of a trio of
blue-chip talents. On the gridiron, the Cardinal adds
a third gun to its arsenal of quarterbacks in All-Amer
ican talent Randy Fasani. Compared favorably by
some trade publications to former Stanford passer
John Elway, Fasani has been rated as highly as (he
fourth-best offensive prospect in the nation by re
cruiting experts.
While football reaps the benefits of one phenom,
basketball boasts a pair in t in towers Jarron and
Jason Collins. Both rated amo' the top 30 prospects,
the brothers (6-foot-10and 6-11, respectively) should
make an immediate impact, bolstering a thin front
line with junior center Tim Young and adding star
power to a team that loses All-American point guard
Brevin Knight.
BPeterson,8 Peterson, sluggers shatter records. In
game one of the Pac-10 Championship Series
against Washington, junior hurler Kyle Peter
son, likely in his last season as a Cardinal, fanned (he
338 th batter of his career, breaking the strikeout
mark held by 1993 Cy Young winner .Jack Mi l )owell
(Class of'B7). In the first round of the West Regional,
the Card faced a different I lusky squad in Northeast
ern and in victimizing the I luskies to the tune of a 12
3 rout, established a new single-season team home
run mark with 94. The previous best of 93 was set by
the 1990 squad.
The Cardinal's accomplishments weren't wasted
on the record books however, as Stanford advanced to
Omaha, Neb., in pursuit of its third College World Se
ries crown.
9 Men's tennis three-peats. The men's tennis
team won its third consecutive national champi
onship at UCLA last month, crushing the (leorgia
Bulldogs 4-0. The championship also clinched the record
for Stanford for number of NCAA titles in one year.

The Card made it back-to-back championships in
199(5 with a 4 I defeat of UCLA. In 199. r >, the Cardi
nal barreled over (leorgia at home 4-0 to begin its
reign. I .osing only one star! ing senior in (J rant Elliot,
the s(|iiad might just make it a clean sweep for junior
Paul (loldst ein next year.
/\Woiin'irs volleyball wins third in five
I fl lyears. The Stanford women's volleyball
JL has sot the standard of excellence in
the 19905.
After Texas ruined the (lard's hopes of a repeat in
1995, Stanford returned to the tournament this sea
son with a mission. That mission was accomplished
when the Cardinal won its third national champi
onship in the last five years.
The 15-7, 15-15, 15-5 win over Hawaii was the most
lopsided national championship match in NCAA his
tory and put a punctuation mark on Stanford's dom
inance in women's volleyball. Only UCLA boasts as
successful a program as the (lard, and the Bruins are
the team t bat Stanford edged for its nat ional titles in
1992 and 1994 -
