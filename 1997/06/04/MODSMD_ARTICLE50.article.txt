# Card chases strong finish at NCAAs
## 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field
team will be well represented at this
year's NCAA track and field cham
pionships in Bloomington, Ind. The
event begins today and continues
through Saturday.
"We have a lot of people quali
fied," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"This is double the number that
we've ever had."
Leading the charge will be senior
Rob Reeder, who will run both the
10,000 and 5,000 meters. Reeder
will be joined in the 10,000 by fresh
man Brad Hauser. Freshman Brent
Hauser will run the 5,000 meters

along with Reeder. Also in the 5,000-
meter field will be junior J.J. White.
Junior Jason Lunn will run the
1,500 meters along with freshman
Michael Stember. Junior Jeff Allen
will compete in the 400 hurdles
thanks to his impressive late-season
performances.
The Cardinal should finish well
in the distance events. Cardinal run
ners have run times that are among
the fastest in the country. These in
clude a quick 13:39.75 by Brent
Hauser in the 5,000 meters and
29:05.25 by Rrad Hauser in the
10,000 meters.
.Junior Justin Strand rounds out
the talented men's squad. Strand
will compete in the hammer, going

into the event with one of the coun
try's leading throws at just over 233
feet.
The women's squad is stacked in
the distance events as well. Junior
Monal Chokshi will compete in the
3,000 meters. Sophomore Mary
Cobb will run the 5,000 meters
along with junior Sama Renfro. Ju
nior Sara Moore will represent the
Cardinal in the 1,500 meters. Junior
Kortney Dunscombe's recent per
formance at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championship was enough to
qualify her for the 10,000 meters.
Sophomore Tracve Lawyer will
try to improve on her already im
pressive scores in the heptathlon
competition, while freshman Sum

mer Pierson will try her might in the
discus.
Stanford has had an outstanding
year. Perhaps the highlight of the
season was defeating California at
the 104 th annual Big Meet on both
the men's and women's sides. The
women went undefeated in dual
meets for the entire season. The
men snapped a 25-year losing streak
against Cal.
The teams also had impressive
performances at the recent Pac-10
Championship. The women cap
tured an unprecedented third-place
finish. The women totaled 110
points, compared to only 23 five
years ago.
"Placing third at Pac-lOs was
great," Chokshi said. "Our strength
is more overall now — the team is
coming toget her."
Although the men finished tied
for sixth, they were only five points
away from third. The men were able
to score more points at Pac-10s than
any other squad in Stanford history.
"Track and field is the oldest
sport in the conference," Lananna
said. "When you win a Pac-10 title,
there's something to bo said for your
squad. You've arrived when you win
Pac- 10s."
The squad is very optimistic
going into next season. The team re
turns a host of talented freshmen,
who gained lots of experience this
season. Several wore able to hit Pac
-10 qualifying marks throughout the
season.
Included in those talented frosh
are the Hauser twins, who are red
shirt freshmen this year. Stember
has also had an impressive season
for Stanford.
The women throwers have had a
wonderful year. Totaling lots of
points for the Cardinal this year in
the throwing events were freshmen
Joy Coff, Beatty, Maggie Isaac,
Cassie Komuld and Pierson.
Almost everyone competing at
NCAAs will l>e back again next sea
son. Reeder is the only one graduat
ing this year. The remaining 14 will
be back on the track for the Cardi
nal.
"This was an encouraging sea
son," Renfro said. "It was a huge
season for the freshmen. They were
introduced to the college scene and
did really well. We've got a good re
cruiting class coming in next year.
We'll definitely be stronger next
year."
