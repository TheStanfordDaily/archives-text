# Formal injects humor into season
## 
### 
With the year winding
down my thoughts re
cently turned to the topic
of this sports column. I knew it
would be my last of the 1996-97
school year, and I wanted to make
it a good one.

I began to ponder all the poten
tial topics and a long list soon devel
oped. I could go with the six nation
al championships thing, but I fig
ured that's old hat. Then I thought
I could write a recap of the year in
sports from my view, but I was told
Stoner already picked that one so it
was out too.
I juggled the possibility of writ
ing about the NBA playoffs. But we
all know how that one would go,
and there's probably not much I
could tell you about the Bulls you
don't already know. After a chat
with my editors, I discovered that
the other columnists had chosen
more serious topics and that's
when I decided that after a year of
ups and downs, surprises and dis
appointments, the NCAA record
for national titles and a whole lot of
other stuff, I'd provide something
we all need a little of at some point
— comic relief.
The way I see it, we all need to
laugh every now and then. I mean,
if you weren't meant to laugh at
sports, they wouldn't sell those
sports bloopers videos every year,
right? Didn't you all laugh when
that ball bounced off Jose
Canseco's head for a home run?
And when we witness those hilari
ous moments on the playing field,
we're not quick to forget them.
So I was all set to write about
some of the most hilarious occur
rences I had witnessed this year,
like junior outfielder Dawn Kobata
crashing through the left-field
fence against Arizona or cheering
on the Stanford football team from
the UCI-A student section in the
closing minutes of the Cardinal's
21-20 victory over the Bruins (OK,

I'm probably the only one who
thinks that was funny).
But seriously, I decided we all
needed a good laugh in the wake of
one of the most successful years in
Stanford sports history. And that's
when my true inspiration hit and
changed everything. It was 2 a.m.,
and I was sitting on a bench in
Santa Cruz because the buses had
all left and I was one of about 25
who had been left.
If you can't laugh at yourself in
those moments of desperation
when nothing is in your control,
when can you? And since sports is
just a metaphor for life (or some
thinglike that), I decided to recount
here for all of you my experience at
the varsity athlete formal. I know
it's not exactly sports column mate
rial, but there were athletes there
so let me run with it.
First, just let me say I had a great
time, and it was a really fun night.
But the Captain's Council or who
ever is in charge of this thing could
use a lot of help. I'd like to point out
that I'm not an at hlete, and neither
was my date. But I promised a

friend I would go, and instead of
having her set me up with someone
else I told her I would find my own
date if she could get me a ticket.
She gave me hers and decided to
try her luck without one. I didn't
think that was the best idea, but she
got in with no problems, so it was
cool. This, I think was the first
problem. We had more people there
than tickets.
I had heard this was a possibility
and bus transportation might be
crowded. So we arrived at Tresidder
Union a little early and got to Santa
Cruz without much problem. Com
ing home, however, was a different
story.
Some genius decided it was al
right for the first bus to leave only
half full. I don't know whose deci
sion this was, but I'd like to thank
them for teaching me to handle the
adversities in life with a smile on my
face. (I guess if you look at the pic
ture I'm not really smiling, but I
promise I took it well).
Fortunately, my wise and sober
friends were able to make a few
phone calls and track down a ride

for us. I've never been more thank
ful to two people my entire life than
I was when our ride pulled up in
that Jeep Cherokee. It actually
wasn't that awful, and looking back
I'm sure it will be something that
sets this formal apart from others I
have attended at Stanford.
But sometime during that hour
and-a-half wait, I promised those
present that I would use all of my
journalistic powers to ensure that
the entire world (or at least all of
The Daily's circulation) knew of
their suffering. So here it is guys.
We sat at a bus stop, imd it was cold.
We had to wake up friends and con
vince them to come get us.
It wasn't a pretty night, but we
can all look back and laugh now be
cause we persevered. And, just like
Jose Canseco, we can go back out on
that field and face our fans knowing
that no matter how ugly it gets we
will survive.

Robin is done driveling. If you
didn 't laugh, it'sprobably because
you weren't there and for that she
is truly sorry.
