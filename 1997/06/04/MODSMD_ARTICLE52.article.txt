### Cordy Crockett Contributing writer 
Superfly, the Stanford
women's Ultimate Frisbee
team, returned triumphant
from Davis, Calif, this weekend
as the 1997 Ultimate Players
Association college national
champions.
La Familia, the top-ranked
men's team, placed second in
the open division of the tourna
ment, going undefeated until a
21-13 loss in the finals.
The teams that made it to
the finals of the tournament re
flect the growing popularity of
Ultimate on the West Coast.
Stanford and British Columbia,
the only schools representing
the Western region, played each
other in the women's final. On
the men's side, Stanford and
UC-Santa Barbara represented
the Western region.
"It shows the Western re
gion is strong, and we have hot
teams here," said senior cap
tain Abby Hoover.
In pool play, top-seeded
Stanford defeated Georgia,
Yale, North Carolina-Wilming
ton and Oberlin. The victory
against North Carolina was

particularly sweet for the Su
perfly, who lost to the team last
year at nationals.
"We were sick of losing in
the finals," Hoover said. "We
wouldn't have it happen
again."
In the semifinals, Superfly
handily defeated Rutgers 17-
11, and in the finals, it tram
pled British Columbia 19-6.
"It was the best we've played
all year," Hoover said. "We
peaked at the right time."
On Friday, the top-seeded
men's team defeated Yale 17-5
and UNCW 17-4. On Saturday,
it took Carleton 17-10, Rice 17-
1 and Wesleyan 17-4 in pool
play, going undefeated. On
Sunday, it defeated the East
Carolina Irates 19-7 in the
semifinal before falling to the
UC-Santa Barbara Black Tide
21-13 in the final.
"We played as well as expect
ed until the finals," said sopho
more ()mer Atesman.
However, in the final, the
Black Tide quickly scored the
first two points. The wind
never died down, and La Famil
ia could never get ahead.
"We couldn't get our offense
going," said Atesman.
