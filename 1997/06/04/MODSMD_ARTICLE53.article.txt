# Reflections of a sports junkie
## 
### 
I'm in Omaha now for my 16th overnight road trip
of the school year, and I've spent 57 free nights in
hotel rooms in the last eight months with Stanford
athletics. I've edited all year, as six NCAA champi
onships rolled in, and trust me — nothing could top
this year.
Six titles and banner years in the major sports
marked the best campaign in NCAA history. The
sports you never hear about also shined in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs. Synchronized swim
ming was edged out of a national title at Ohio State.
Women's sailing was ranked No. 1 much of the year.
Softball became a winning team right before our eyes,
and like softball, men's soccer found a new coach and
excelled.
The first signs
We knew it *vas going to be a special year when
Stanford claimed two national titles in one early No
vember day in Tucson, Ariz. Cross country — both
genders — came away with their first rings under
coach Vin Lananna. That caught us by surprise.
Comeback season

Football looked
atrocious. Tim
Carey went to
Hawaii after a
fourth different
quarterback beat
him out for the
starting job. And
redshirt freshman
Chad Hutchinson
spent a lot of time
with the chiroprac
tor as a reward.

But with the season on the line, Hutchinson threw
a fourth-and-12 pass somewhere toward Oakland.
And senior Andre Kirwan caught it. The most hope
less pass in recent Stanford history went for a huge
gain and resurrected a season. In its first overtime
game ever, Stanford prevailed.
With a 2-5 record heading into the UCLA game,
Stanford maintained that it wasn't playing out the
string. I stepped onto the hallowed Rose Bowl turf
with the Bruins leading 20-14. Then Hutchinson, and
a much-maligned offensive line, took over.
Senior Brian Manning — who started the year
touted as one of the best receivers in Stanford history,
ended it on the bench and then won MVP of the East-
West Shrine Game to be drafted by the Miami Dol
phins (so how was your senior year?) — caught his
lone pass of the game in the left side of the end zone,
and Kevin Miller drilled the extra point 21-20 and 3-5.
USC came to apathetic Stanford Stadium for a night
game. Senior Pete Swanson picked off Brad Otton.
Three hundred pounds rumbled down the field and gave
Stanford a good chance to pull off the stunner. With a
24-20 deficit, USC set up for a Hail Mary. I set up shop
on the sidelines, near the left corner of the end zone.
Right in front of me, the ball landed in somebody's
arms. Nobody knew for sure. Then the official sig
naled touchback, and I never saw sophomore Tim
Smith emerge with the ball because I was too busy
jumping up and down on Fox Sports and running to

hug Ed Guzman. Right then, nobody would have
cared if we finished 4-7. We beat USC.
But Smith crushed a Cougar right in front of me
the next week as redshirt freshman Troy Walters re
turned a punt 75 yards for a score near the end of the
first half. "Thirty thousand" braved the rain to form
the smallest crowd of the decade at Stanford Stadium
as the Cardinal set up a Big Game for the Sun Bowl.
Stanford gave Cal the Axe from the get-go. Junior
Kailee Wong, who had led a defensive uprising all year
long, returned an atrocious Pat Barnes pass for an im
probable touchdown as Stanford made 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci look silly. Cal laughed all the way to
the Aloha Bowl and made him look even more ridicu
lous in a blue-and-gold Hawaiian shirt. Cal closed its
season with a five-game losing streak; Stanford won
its Final five.
The Sun Bowl was one big party, and we watched it
from a camera deck. Senior Josh Madsen's intercep
tion and lateral to senior Leroy Pruitt for a touchdown
started the festivities and was a truly great play. The
38-0 triumph was Stanford's first shutout in 22 years.
The record quest begins
Women's volleyball barely got on the KZSU air
waves for its national championship match but steam
rolled Hawaii in record-breaking fashion. A year after
losing four fine seniors, Stanford staked its claim as
the best team ever.
The Cardinal figured the record of six titles could go
down over spring break. But Stanford went 0-for
spring. Women's swimming didn't win. Neither did
the men. Women's hoops fell short. They all were in
the top three, yet we were disappointed. That's how
good they are.
Men's basketball memories
Listening on our way to the airport for women's
basketball's trip to Los Angeles, my broadcast partner
Ray Sal loom kept telling us the score of the men's
game was 17-2 and other ridiculous margins. The
team and I thought he must have been lying, but we
listened on the plane via telephone and watched the
LA. stations all whine about Stanford's 109-61 de
struction of the Bruins.
We were in Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson for the
end of the men's game at Maples against Arizona. I'll
never forget sophomore Peter Sauer's shot tickling
the twine and sparkinga group of Wildcat fans to gripe
about those damn refs who cost them the game. Who
would have thought that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot preparing to leave for
Missoula, Mont., for the West Regional, we heard se
nior Brevin Knight's three-point heave that sent
Stanford to overtime with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank Luisetti was great in his
day and created a shot and Adam Keefe and Todd
Lichti could play ball, but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.
The wins continue to accrue
Should've-been-junior Tiger Woods ran away with
the Masters and doesn't leave home without his mil
lions. How was your junior year?


Jeremy
Stone
Troy Clardy and I were at
Sunken Diamond preparing to call
a baseball game against Arizona
when the perennially heartbroken
men's volleyball team blew a 2-0
lead against UCLA in the national
championship match. But normal
ly stoic Chris Crader of KZSU lost
it when four-time All-American
Matt Fuerbringer stuffed Paul Ni
hipali to take the fifth game 15-13
and claim a first national title for
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford tied the record in the
homeland. Taube Family Tennis
Stadium looked immaculate de
spite the heat as Stanford didn't
need doubles to win the national
title — its first in six years. And
freshman Lilia Osterloh paved the
way for a Tigerlike departure by
bulldozing through the individual
draw. So that'swhy senior Katie
Schlukebir, the top-ranked player
in the country, wasn't at the top
spot for Stanford.
Over the top
I remember checking the Inter
net constantly to see if men's ten
nis could break the record against
Georgia. Finally, Daily writer
Hillary Stamm beat the World
Wide Web to the punch and called
with the good news. The Cardinal
had its sixth, and senior Grant El
liott was the man to put Stanford
in the record books.
A women's hoops groupie
I saw junior Vanessa Nygaard in
a leopard-skin dress in Hawaii and
was courtside for some heartfelt

standing ovations to Tara Van-
Derveer, new Cal head coach Mari
anne Stanley and senior Jamila
Wideman after her appearance on
Sports Illustrated's cover. Stan
ford spanked Tennessee in
Knoxville for the first time. I drank
Pepsi at the Diet Coke Shootout.
Senior Kate Starbird proved she
was one of the best open-court
players in the world. KZSU and
The Daily scooped everybody by
laughable margins about redshirt
sophomore Kristin Folkl's return.
But it ended all wrong.
This was Stanford's year in
women's hoops. And while it didn't
have a happy ending, there are lots
of things I'll cherish about my ex
perience with the team this year.
In Missoula, Mont., Stanford
administered the worst regional
final beating ever to Georgia with
defensive tenacity. Wideman
played out of her mind and earned
her first career blocked shot
against Virginia's All-American
Tora Suber.
And the composure of Stanford
after the Cincinnati debacle was a
sight to behold. Knowing they blew
a 15-point lead, knowing the same
team beat them twice even though
it supposedly could never happen
again with Folkl (who went 8-for
-8) and if Old Dominion shot poorly
from the outside (they were 1-for
-12) and knowing they blew count
less opportunities to win a game
they felt they would win, Stanford
players weren't curt to the press.
They didn't shun the fans. And we
all shared their pain.
I'll never forget Wideman get
ting fouled / traveling to sidestep
Old Dominion's Clarisse
Machanguana and her three clang
ing off the rim. I'll never forget se

nior Charmin Smith draining two
free throws to send the game into
overtime. I'll never forget Starbird
dropping to her knees at the foul
line after the horn sounded.
But my favorite memory of the
year was more pleasant. Starbird
had scored at such a frenetic pace
that she had a chance to break
the school's career scoring record
Feb. 22 on Senior Night. The
electricity in the crowd was phe
nomenal.
Proving a 112 air for the dramatic,
she tied the record at the buzzer to
end the first half. The buzz grew
throughout Maples during the in
termission.
Washington's Gena Pelz made a
bad pass that was stolen by Star
bird. In transition, she dribbled
through a couple of defenders, laid
it up and in and was fouled.
Starbird had become Stanford's
all-time scoring leader in signature
Kate Starbird fashion, and I had
nailed the call.
She seemed stunned by it all af
terward, and after KZSU's extend
ed postgame show the venue had
emptied. But Starbird was still
there. She signed a couple pro
grams for some kids and my dad's
hat. Then in the parking lot, my
folks took off and I hugged them
goodbye. I looked around and saw
one other car. And the greatest
scorer in Stanford history stepped
inside her less-than-luxury sedan
and drove off.
I followed her out of the parking
lot and knew that I could broadcast
the rest of my life and never enjoy
such a surreal evening again.

Jeremy Stone thinks that worse
things could happen than a fifth
year of Stanford athletics.
