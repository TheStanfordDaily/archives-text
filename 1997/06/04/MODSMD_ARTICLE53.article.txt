# Reflections of a sports junkie
## 
### 
I'm in Omaha now for my 16th overnight road trip
of the school year, and I've spent 57 free nights in
hotel rooms in the last eight months with Stanford
athletics. I've edited all year, as six NCAA champi
onships rolled in, and trust me — nothing could top
this year.
Six titles and banner years in the major sports
marked the best campaign in NCAA history. The
sports you never hear about also shined in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs. Synchronized swim
ming was edged out of a national title at Ohio State.
Women's sailing was ranked No. 1 much of the year.
Softball became a winning team right before our eyes,
and like softball, men's soccer found a new coach and
excelled.
The first signs
We knew it *vas going to be a special year when
Stanford claimed two national titles in one early No
vember day in Tucson, Ariz. Cross country — both
genders — came away with their first rings under
coach Vin Lananna. That caught us by surprise.
Comeback season

Football looked
atrocious. Tim
Carey went to
Hawaii after a
fourth different
quarterback beat
him out for the
starting job. And
redshirt freshman
Chad Hutchinson
spent a lot of time
with the chiroprac
tor as a reward.

But with the season on the line, Hutchinson threw
a fourth-and-12 pass somewhere toward Oakland.
And senior Andre Kirwan caught it. The most hope
less pass in recent Stanford history went for a huge
gain and resurrected a season. In its first overtime
game ever, Stanford prevailed.
With a 2-5 record heading into the UCLA game,
Stanford maintained that it wasn't playing out the
string. I stepped onto the hallowed Rose Bowl turf
with the Bruins leading 20-14. Then Hutchinson, and
a much-maligned offensive line, took over.
Senior Brian Manning — who started the year
touted as one of the best receivers in Stanford history,
ended it on the bench and then won MVP of the East-
West Shrine Game to be drafted by the Miami Dol
phins (so how was your senior year?) — caught his
lone pass of the game in the left side of the end zone,
and Kevin Miller drilled the extra point 21-20 and 3-5.
USC came to apathetic Stanford Stadium for a night
game. Senior Pete Swanson picked off Brad Otton.
Three hundred pounds rumbled down the field and gave
Stanford a good chance to pull off the stunner. With a
24-20 deficit, USC set up for a Hail Mary. I set up shop
on the sidelines, near the left corner of the end zone.
Right in front of me, the ball landed in somebody's
arms. Nobody knew for sure. Then the official sig
naled touchback, and I never saw sophomore Tim
Smith emerge with the ball because I was too busy
jumping up and down on Fox Sports and running to

hug Ed Guzman. Right then, nobody would have
cared if we finished 4-7. We beat USC.
But Smith crushed a Cougar right in front of me
the next week as redshirt freshman Troy Walters re
turned a punt 75 yards for a score near the end of the
first half. "Thirty thousand" braved the rain to form
the smallest crowd of the decade at Stanford Stadium
as the Cardinal set up a Big Game for the Sun Bowl.
Stanford gave Cal the Axe from the get-go. Junior
Kailee Wong, who had led a defensive uprising all year
long, returned an atrocious Pat Barnes pass for an im
probable touchdown as Stanford made 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci look silly. Cal laughed all the way to
the Aloha Bowl and made him look even more ridicu
lous in a blue-and-gold Hawaiian shirt. Cal closed its
season with a five-game losing streak; Stanford won
its Final five.
The Sun Bowl was one big party, and we watched it
from a camera deck. Senior Josh Madsen's intercep
tion and lateral to senior Leroy Pruitt for a touchdown
started the festivities and was a truly great play. The
38-0 triumph was Stanford's first shutout in 22 years.
The record quest begins
Women's volleyball barely got on the KZSU air
waves for its national championship match but steam
rolled Hawaii in record-breaking fashion. A year after
losing four fine seniors, Stanford staked its claim as
the best team ever.
The Cardinal figured the record of six titles could go
down over spring break. But Stanford went 0-for
spring. Women's swimming didn't win. Neither did
the men. Women's hoops fell short. They all were in
the top three, yet we were disappointed. That's how
good they are.
Men's basketball memories
Listening on our way to the airport for women's
basketball's trip to Los Angeles, my broadcast partner
Ray Sal loom kept telling us the score of the men's
game was 17-2 and other ridiculous margins. The
team and I thought he must have been lying, but we
listened on the plane via telephone and watched the
LA. stations all whine about Stanford's 109-61 de
struction of the Bruins.
We were in Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson for the
end of the men's game at Maples against Arizona. I'll
never forget sophomore Peter Sauer's shot tickling
the twine and sparkinga group of Wildcat fans to gripe
about those damn refs who cost them the game. Who
would have thought that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot preparing to leave for
Missoula, Mont., for the West Regional, we heard se
nior Brevin Knight's three-point heave that sent
Stanford to overtime with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank Luisetti was great in his
day and created a shot and Adam Keefe and Todd
Lichti could play ball, but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.
The wins continue to accrue
Should've-been-junior Tiger Woods ran away with
the Masters and doesn't leave home without his mil
lions. How was your junior year?
