Six championships and counting. In a year in
which Stanford broke the national record for
most NCAA championships, it is fitting that the
Cardinal assert its rightful title as the best athletic
program in the nation.
With nearly

10 percent of
Stanford's stu
dent body partici
pating in varsity
athletics, it
would be easy to
pinpoint the
Farm as a breed
ing ground for
jocks. I was going
to write this edi-

torial as a rebut
tal to Sports Illustrated's placement of Stanford as
the third best jock school in the nation, and I was
going to claim that the Cardinal definitely deserved
the top spot more than second-place Notre Dame or
first-place UCLA. After all, a school that gets
spanked by 48 points in its most venerated sport can
not possibly be the best jock school in the country.
But then I realized that rather than having the
best jock school in the nation, Stanford simply has
the best athletics program. Now let me explain the
difference. According to Sports Illustrated (the reign
ing authority in sports, along with Sports Center and
Daily sports), a jock school is "any college or universi
ty in which sports are central to campus life, a place
where sports-minded students can flourish."
The best athletics program, by my own humble de
finition, is the school that wins the most in the widest
variety of sports while graduating its athletes and
staying out of trouble with the NCAA infractions
committee.
Are sports central to campus life at Stanford?
Well, it can be argued that watching and cheering for
Cardinal teams for the most part does not take center
stage on the Farm. We don't pack the student section
of Stanford Stadium for games against no-name
teams the way Michigan does, no matter how good
our football squad is in a given year. The Card also
does not fill its arena to capacity every week for its

women's volleyball team the way that Hawaii does,
even though the Stanford squad pounded the Wahine
in this season's national championship match.
And perhaps Stanford's intramural and recreation
al athletes are on the whole not the caliber of those at
Notre Dame. So what if the Fighting Irish full contact
intramural football champions could beat Stanford's
flag-football champs, not to mention some Division II
schools' varsity teams. And who cares that the Wilbur
court Michael Jordan and Karl Malone wannabees
would get mauled on UCLA's blacktop courts.
None of that diminishes the fact that Stanford has
the very best varsity athletics program in the nation.
Period. You want winning? Stanford has won 27 na
tional titles this decade, more than any other school in
the country. You want variety of sports and gender
equality? The Card won titles in men's and women's
cross country, men's and women's volleyball, and
men's and women's tennis this season alone. You
want high graduation rates? Stanford athletes have
one of the highest in the nation. You want clean pro
grams? Stanford has never had a varsity program on
probation.
Furthermore, the Cardinal has the potential to do
even more winning in a wider variety of sports.
Women's basketball and swimming are perennial
championship contenders, as are men's water polo,
gymnastics and baseball.
And quite frankly, Stanford isn't all that shabby
as a jock school anyway. Club sports such as rugby,
polo, skiing and fencing are among the nation's best,
and those Sunday afternoon recreational Frisbee
players can play a tough game themselves. 1 lowever,
I must admit that the Cardinal does lack in some
jock-school essentials like courses in coaching foot
ball (Florida) and fans who commit battery and prop
erty damage when their school loses football games
(Weenies).
No, Stanford is not the best jock school in the
country. All the Cardinal does is win, win, win, win,
win and win; all in a single academic year.

Ben Hur would have likely enrolled in the instruc
tional classes on chalkboard writing and projector
operating had he attended a real jock school like
Georgia.
