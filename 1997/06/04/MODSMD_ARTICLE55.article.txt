# Derrick Delmore: slick as ice
## Excels at sport despite long-distance coach 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
One super-athlete students
may not know Stanford had — un
less they happened to be watching
a nationwide broadcast of the fig
ure skating championships — is
freshman Derrik Delmore.
Five-foot-six with a lean frame
and a modest smile, it may not be
easy for fellow students to tell that
Delmore is one of the nation's top
male singles skaters and a strong
candidate for the future Olympic
Games.
Delmore, who took silver in the
Junior World Figure Skating
Championships and won the U.S.
Olympic Festival title in 1994, has
competed in every nationals com
petition since he was 12 years old.
He has also represented the United
States in five international compe
titions.
"My goal is the Olympic games,"
Delmore said. While a possibility
for the next year's games in
Nagano, Japan, Delmore is looking
to be a part of the national team for
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah.
Born and brought up in Fort
Washington, Md., coming to Stan
ford was not an easy decision for
the 18-year-old. He had always
trained in the same Virginia club
with one mentor, professional
coach Shirley Hughes. While
Hughes flies out whenever she can
to coach Delmore, for the most
part, the disciplined athlete trains

on his own at the Ice Oasis rink in
Redwood City before and in be
tween classes.
"I made it very clear to (my
coach and parents) coming to Stan
ford was something I really want
ed," Delmore said. "I knew I would
have regretted it in the future if I
didn't."
With the support of his parents
and Hughes, who were both initial
ly against his decision, Delmore
has adjusted to life in college and
continues to balance his rigorous
academic life with his competitive
career on the ice.
Despite his hectic daily schedule
and the inconvenience of being
separated from his coach, Delmore
calls himself "extremely lucky,"
adding that he has felt nothing but
happy and welcomed since arriving
at Stanford.
"The people here havejust made
it a wonderful place, an amazing
first year," Delmore said. Stanford
professors "are really supportive
and helped me out a lot."
This year, Delmore competed in
the Eastern Championships dur
ing finals week fall quarter and in
nationals in the winter, finishing
11th in the country.
According to Delmore, this sat
isfying result is especially reward
ing as it follows the nightmare of
the season before, when the Amer
ican audience watched in horror as
his skates came apart 20 seconds
into his free program on the final
day of competition. Delmore was

forced to withdraw from his first
senior nationals competition that
year due to the mishap.
"I knew a lot of people were
doubting me and my sincerity at
my skating because of my choice"
to come to Stanford, he said. "I was
glad I could prove them wrong."
Delmore started his skating ca
reer at age 8, partly in response to
his parents' attempt to keep their
son active during the winter.
With a lopsided-smile, Delmore
recalls his first day on the ice over
10 years ago, when his friend from
school took him to a skating rink.
"She was dancing circles
around me," Delmore said. "And 1
was just like any other kid, ankles
turned in, holding on to the (side)
boards — that was kind of my in
centive to get started."
Another talent Delmore has —
which has greatly complemented
his artistic skating style — is
music. A pianist for 11 years, Del
more still enjoys playing for his
dormmates in his little spare time.
"It was always a skating-piano
thing," said Delmore. "People were
always wondering which one I was
going to be. I finally chose skating
(last year) because I enjoy it a lot
more."
As easygoing and laid-back as he
may come across, Delmore admits
life does get more than a little too
hectic.
"I try to keep myself calm. 1 tell
myself I can get through it all," he
said.

Delmore, who calls himself a
"typical teenager," enjoys going to
parties and movies, dancing and
listening to music to help him
relax.
"I have a normal college life for
the most part," Delmore said.
"Whatever college kids do — that's

what I do."
Sure enough, Delmore tries to
take advantage of various Stanford
activities, such as going white
water rafting with his dormmates
and participating in dorm trips.
"It's hard to see where skating
is going to take me, but it'll bea fun

journey, especially since I have no
clue what my future profession is
going to be," he said.
While Delmore sees himself
going to a graduate school, it is like
ly skating will be the main focus for
quite some time — at least until the
2002 (Jlympics in Utah.
