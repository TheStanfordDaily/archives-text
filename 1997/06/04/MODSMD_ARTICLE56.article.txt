# Stanford students take winners for granted
## Don't miss the next Tiger 
### 
Ive heard that Tiger Woods is coming back to
Stanford to play golf. All right, so I'm lying. But
what if it were true?
Would you trek out to the course at the golf team's
first meet next year and watch EI Tigre hit superhu
man drives and 200-yard nine irons? You think you
might skip a chem lecture and maybe even plunk
down a few bucks to see a living legend?
Well I m sorry, but you've already missed what
was probably your only chance.
Unless you're a freshman, and was never able to
pass up the opportunity to see Tiger play, you've
given up something definitely worth venturing out
side the 24-hour study room for — an athlete pos
sessing such epic skills that his greatness might tran
scend the playing field, the next Michael Jordan per
haps, not an athlete, not an entertainer: an icon.
And he was right here a year ago, doing his Tiger
thing in front of pitifully small crowds when the golf

team happened to
be playing on its
home course. For
less than the cost
of a movie, you
could have
watched him work
his magic.
Tiger's now in a
different stratos
phere though,and
it'll cost you a lit-

tie more than a couple hours of study time to catch
him. The artist formerly known as the world's best
young golfer has simply become the world's best.
People outside the Farm know what they've got
on their hands and they're not about to take him for
granted. They flock to no-name tournaments like the
Greater Sheboygan Classic just cram into a gallery
with thousands of other Tiger-crazed fans. A fren
zied mob of people, all clamoring to watch . . . golf.
And what is all this craziness worth in dollars?
Let's just say that the $40 million Nike gave Tiger
last summer is beginning to look like pocket change.
With endorsements and winnings, he will likely have
zoomed past $100 million by the time he reaches the
hoary age of 25.
The going price on a round of golf with Tiger could
finance a small country. Just 18 holes, a little more
than two hours of work if one walks fast, and he gets
a fat paycheck with lots of cute little zeroes. The
funny thing is, Tiger doesn't even accept all these of
fers. No, there's a waiting list for the honor of drop
ping $100,000 into his pocket. What's ironic, is that
it's not entirely inconceivable that 15 years down the
road, some of us, with all our premed, prelaw, pre
business aspirations, might be the next bunch of
ridiculously-wealthy, corporate idiots paying to
spend a little time with him.
Now I know not everyone is a sports fan, and cer
tainly not everyone likes golf, but the entire world
has caught Tiger Fever and somehow, I feel like we
missed out on something truly special. Some day,

when we tell people that we went to Stanford, they'll
ask about Tiger, who by then will be the definitive
athlete of our era, and we'll answer that we really
didn't have time to watch him because we had to fin
ish a really important CIV paper. On second thought,
it'd probably be a better idea to just lie.
The level of apathy displayed towards the Stan
ford sports program is somewhat disconcerting. We
enjoy an embarrassment of riches among our ath
letes, and yet we take them completely for granted.
There might not be another Tiger Woods in the
mix, but redshirt freshman quarterback Chad
Hutchinson might just be the next John Elway,
based on his polished passing towards the end of
this season. Or maybe he's the next Greg Maddux.
After all, the Braves felt confident enough in
Hutchinson to make him their top draft choice and
offer him $1.5 million two years ago. Then again, I
guess that would make him the next Bo Jackson or
Deion Sanders.
Speaking of two sport stars, why not take in some
women's hoops and see redshirt sophomore Kristin
Folkl. Shwoing Hashes of brilliance after rejoining
the team late this season, Folk! provided a key boost
to the Card's Final Four run, despite a year away
from the sport. However, the only thing scarier than
Folkl getting ready to dunk on you (guys, how can
you not love a girl who can jam?) is the fact that bas
ketball's only her second best sport. It's in volleyball,
where she helped lead Stanford to its third title in
five years, that Folkl truly excels.
If you're lucky, you might be able to catch junior
Kyle Peterson, another Stanford pitcher, before he
leaps into major league stardom. However, it's un
likely that Peterson, projected as one of (he top pitch
ers in June's amatuer draft and slated to go as high
as No. 4 overall, will take the mound in a Stanford
uniform after this season.
Maybe football, baseball and hoops aren't your
cup of tea though. Park youself in the stands at a
women's tennis match and keep an eye out for
freshman Lilia Osterloh. At the NCAA singles
championship, she embarrassed the field, cruising
through the draw wit hout dropping a single set. On
her way to the title, she casually swept aside the
Nos. 1 and 3 players in the country. With that kind
of performance, how much longer do you figure
she'll be hitting volleys as a collegian instead of at
Wimbledon?
The year is just about over and really, there isn't
much left in the way of sports. But when you get back
to the Farm next year, do yourself a favor and take in
a football game, go root for volleyball, hike over to the
Stanford Golf Course to watch the team, or check out
water polo at deGuerre. Just go out and spend a little
time supporting Stanford athletics. Who knows? You
just might catch a glimpse of the next big superstar.
And you won't even have to lie about it.

Brian IjCC is going to miss Alda, Stoner, Robin, Ed,
Katie and the rest of Daily sports because he no longer
has any other friends.
