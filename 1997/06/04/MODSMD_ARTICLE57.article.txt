4 "Tho cares?" This was the response to a
\l\l question on an internal Daily survey
V ▼ about the best coverage of a sports
beat this volume.
"They are all the same" was a response to a ques
tion about the best sports articles.
I am reminded of how about two months ago a let
ter to the editor chastised The Daily for its lack of ad
equate coverage for the recipients of the dean's

awards. The let
ter's parting shot
read: "There al
ways seems to be
plenty of room for
sports coverage in
The Daily. Isn't it
too bad that ex
traordinary schol
arship can't be
recognized with

at least this much
space, if only for one day?"
Varsity athletes make up about 10 percent of the
population at Stanford. There are H3 varsity sports
and 18 club sports. Everyone is an athlete in some
shape or form — or knows one.
Sports provide an invaluable part of the college ex
perience, not only for the athletes who participate in
the sport but for all students.
I must admit that at times 1 have questioned a sys
tem that gives more money to some athletes for food
in one quarter than it does to its President's Schol
ars.
Hut sports in themselves generate funds for the
University. Football raises more than $10 million in
revenue alone. Now that men's basketball has found
its niche, we should expect to see more money coming
in from that direction as well. Women's basketball
has held its own for quite some time now.
Additionally, the Athletics Department's budget of
$22 million and the athlete's scholarships receive
funding from money fund-raising, alumni donations,
and revenue from the golf course and summer camps.
For the individuals involved in these sports, the
challenges and lessons afforded by participating are
invaluable. Excelling at a sport gives some of these
athletes an opportunity to attend a top-notch private
university. They learn about hard work, teamwork
and discipline.
Sports foster school spirit, unity and morale. One
of the most attended functions in my house this year
was not the ski trip, not the barbecue, but one that

had absolutely nothing to do with Residential Educa
tion — the men's basketball Sweet 16 game against
Utah. The entire lounge was filled, and everyone was
fixated on the TV screen.
I mean, what else can compel a Stanford student
to be late to a 7 p.m. final than an overtime game in
the Sweet 16?
What would the rivalry against Cal be if we didn't
have Big Game, Big Meet, Big Skate, Big Swim? Face
it, a rivalry based on the number of Nobel laureates
would only fire up a select few, whereas sports appeal
to the masses.
It doesn't just have to be varsity athletics, any
thing from a club sport to an IM team to a pickup
game can draw the enthusiasm of spectators and par
ticipants.
The dining room in my house was empty for din
ner Sunday. And it's not because everybody was busy
studying for finals or working on projects. They were
watching the Bulls-Jazz game.
What other than sports can inspire students to
sleep out for seats or a spot on the IM roster? Sure,
signing up for Writing and Critical Thinking classes
freshman year drew a few early risers, but I bet it
wasn't nearly as fun.
That's really what I am getting at. Sports are fun.
Playing them, watching them, writing about them.
They give this campus much needed energy and
make being here a little more enjoyable.
After all, this campus, as well as this newspaper,
would be a lot more boring if all we had to focus on
were research and studying.
That's why there's always "plenty of room" in the
paper to devote to sports. Because it is fun and inter
est ingand appeals to more Stanford students than an
esoteric institution like the ASSU Senate.
That's why sports stories are not "all the same."
Because each team has its own struggles and suc
cesses. Because the teams are made up of unique in
dividuals with different backgrounds and histories.
Because each game, each meet, each match has its
own highlights and significance.
That's why sports deserve the money and cover
age they get.
And so, in response to the individual who scrawled
"Who cares" on the survey, listen closely to my an
swer.
I do.

Aldci Leu would like to thank the sports writers, for
doing (i great job this volume; Brian, for always being
in good spirits, and Jeremy, for being constant.
