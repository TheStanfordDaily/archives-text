John Paul Hammond celebrates the blues
with raw-boned guitai riffs, emotionally
charged vocals and a low-down gritty
vibe. With acoustic and national steel qui

tars, bottlenecks and harmonicas, he pre
sents musical stories of life and love with
honesty and strength. Hammond is a riv
eting Delta blues player equally at home
with the gritty, gutsy sound of Chicago's
South Side. After three decades of touring
and dozens of records, he still has an un
pretentious, wide-eyed enthusiasm for the
music. The show starts at 8 p.m. at the
Freight & Salvage Coffee House, 1111
Addison St., Berkeley. Tickets are $ 13.50.
Call (510) 548-1 761 for tickets and infor

A Korean-American woman obsessed
with an unfinished novel, a guilt-ridden
Korean pilot posing as a doctor and a
singing Isaac Newton encounter one an

room transforms into a cloud in the
heavens as they realize they are con
nected in mysterious ways to the 1983
tragic downing of a Korean Air jet in So
viet airspace. The Council of Angels has
decreed that the law of gravity will be re
pealed until these three formulate a
fourth law of motion — the law of emo
tion. The star, Steve Park, has been in
such films as "Do the Right Thing" and
"Fargo." The show is Thursdays through
