# Quintessential ‘Quidam’
## Cirque du Soleil's latest show soars, contorts and tumbles into town 
### 
Every once in a while, we are reminded that magic truly ex
ists — not the magic of David Copperfield floating across the
Grand Canyon hut the kind when things come together per
fectly. In its Bay Area premiere in Oakland last week, Cirque du
Soleil's "Quidam" included heart-in-your-throat aerial, high
flying, balancing and manipulation acts, delightful clowns,
hypnotic music and an amazing set that wrapped the audience
in a surreal fantasy.
Modeled around the circus theme, "Quidam" has the ex
pected contortionists and daring maneuvers, but it strings
the elements together in the plot of a little girl's disillusion
ment with the world. The French word "Quidam" (pro
nounced "key-dahm") means "a nameless passerby, a solitary
figure lingering on a street corner, a person rushing past, a
person who lives lost amid the crowd in an all-too-anony
mous society."
The show sought, in the words of director franco 1 )ragonc,
to "highlight our frailties and ouranguish in the face of the new
millennium that lies before us. It also underlines differences,
conveying positive feelings and resentment and confronting
our dreams with our nightmares."
It is difficult to say if the show accomplished this, but for 2
1/2 hours, it succeeded in unraveling the imagination.
When the lights dimmed in the yellow-and-blue big top in
Oakland, a long-faced ringmaster, bald except for a rooster's
crown of hair, waddled out with four mysterious white-suited
figures. The four figures snatched up an audience member and
carried him into the back. They returned with him similarly
outfitted in white and pushed him to the center of the stage,
where he introduced himself as Klihu Harris, the mayor of
Oakland, and wished Cirque du Soleil a successful run. With
that, the real show began.
Chris Lashua appeared first, twisting, rolling and turning
around stage in a contraption called the "German Wheel." The
wheel is two meters in diameter and consists of 2 metal hoops
joined at six points. Lashua precariously balanced himself as
the wheel spun like a coin.
This act was followed by four young girls, each dressed like
the fin Man and holding two sticks linked by a string, on

which they slid, juggled and tossed a wooden spool,
called a "diablo" or "Chinese yo-yo."
Another children's same was transformed into

a unique circus act in "Skipping Ropes." Twenty performers
were on stage at the same time, performing solo, duo and
group jumps with amazing rhythm and acrobatic moves.
"Aerial Contortion in Silk" was one of the many amazing
displays of balance, strength and fluid grace. In this act, Isabelle
Vaudellc joined and separated two columns of red silk as she
twisted her body into amazing positions. The contrast of red
against her flesh-toned costume brought an additional sensu
ality and elegance to the piece.
Meanwhile, between these diverse performances, a trio of
clowns called "Les Macloma" made the audience laugh as they
played off each other's characters. Unlike typical clown acts,

they maintained a sense ot sophistication amid the ah
surd and comical scenarios.
Alter the 20 minute intermission, the show took oil
again with the captivating "Vis Versa," an ait involving
remarkable strength and balance engineered by a man
and-woman dim, Yves Decoste and Marie 1 aure Mes
nage. Involving intense concentration and utter reliance
on each another, the two performers glided into impos
sible positions without the slightest tremor, bringing to
mind a sense of harmony and the beauty of the human
form.
"Quidam" ended with a grand finale of "Haiu|uine,"
showcasing 14 performers who astounded the audience
in sequences of human pyramids and acrobatics. At one
point, two men were simultaneously catapulted to
wards one another, one arcing only a foot higher than
the other.
"Quidam" is the show you have waited all year to see.
It's pure magic.
