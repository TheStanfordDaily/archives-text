# Masters of their trade
## THE 						STANFORD ART GALLERY SEES BOTH THE SUBLIME AND THE RIDICULOUS AS THIS YEAR'S FINE ARTS GRADUATES SHOW THEIR WORK 
### 
DOMINATED BY THREE large installations, this year's
master of fine arts exhibition shows pieces that range
from the sublime to the ridiculous, most of which are
genuinely engaging pieces of art.
The five students participating in the thesis exhibition are
Margaret Crane, Melanie Klein, Creg Lam Niemeyer, Rigo 97
and Jaime Snyder. They chose to work in mediums that range
from metal sculpture todigital photography, with varied success.
This show serves two important functions. Aside from the
fact that it is a requirement for graduation from the master's

program in studio art, the exhibit puts the Art I )epartment into
.1 campus spotlight. As one of the few opportunities people
other than art students have to view the work of the artists, the
emphasis on this display cannot he understated.
()ne wall of the gallery is devoted to C irane's multimedia in
st.illation, "Sunset." A series of 43 digital photographs (in which
the black shimmers when viewed .it certain angles), seven brief
texts and two gold-scripted sentences that are scattered across
the south wall, "Sunset" is meant to "evoke the torrid universe of
an imaginary soap opera, drawing from the modern incarna
tion of melodrama in order to explore the seething pathology of
late-2()th-century urban life," according to an Art Department
press release.
The piece clearly captures that "torrid universe," but as an ex
ploration into the modern urban psyche it is poorly lacking.
Over-the top texts that drop the names of characters dealing
with melodramatic subjects like detox, nervous breakdowns
and lost marriages play excellently off thf stiffly-posed pictures
and create a very real soap opera.
But soap operas clearly do not project society's reality .it the
viewer, and the mundane lack of insight into the causal pattern
of society's problems force this piece to rest its weight on the
wonderful medium of digital photographs.
I lie highlights of the show hide in one of the two back rooms.
Klein's robotic creations are visually, emotionally and intellectu
ally stunning. In the middle of the room hangs "flying fish,"
(steel, motor, rubber, hardware, wire) whose bulbous belly and
thin rubber fin flop around in agony every five minutes or so.
In one corner, the skeletal "Dragon" (wood, springs, wire,
motor, lightbulband socket, coffee filters, oil, rubber, tape, steel,
hardware, brass) crouches, with .111 ethereal frame that suggests
.1 beast of lolkienian proportions; the only movement in the
piece is a brilliant representation of the flames the dragon would
shoot from its belly.
Behind .1 divider lurks "Not One; Not Two," (steel, alu
milium, muslin, acrylic, motor, lighthulhs and sockets, switch
cs, melon bailer, hardware, epoxy). Three wing like flaps twist

within a tall mesh wire cage lit In
flickering lightbulbs like hats on
a dark night, casting a bramble
ol twisted shailows on the walls.
In addition to the visual el
lects, all three pieces produce a
cacophony of metallic screeches.
Along with two less successful
pieces ("Breathing" and "Owl"),
the exhibit is a strong combina
tion ol "levity and desperation,"
as it is billed, and a successful
demonstration ol Klein's mate
rially transformative sense. •
The open-ended installation
"Clear C Ait" by Lam Niemever,

combines six distinct pieces into an articulate commentary on
the way people use and conceptualize their use ol paper and
other wood products.
Dominating the center of the gallery is "Oracle" (50 inkjet
prints, fivewastehaskets, garbage bags, black India ink), in which
the skylight panels, covered by inkjet prints of a clear-cut debris
area, reflect in the opaque surfaces of the ink filled wastebaskets.
lb be able to see the reflection vou must lean over the baskets.

but if you lean over too far your body cuts oft the light source;
Lam Niemeyer's subtle point is that it is difficult to find a good
balancing point for viewing the situation.
Inkjet prints in "Oracle," "Landscaping" and "Going West"
all contain images of cut tree limbs and stumps, a symbol re
peated in the physical separation of the installation pieces. This
sense of lack of connection is also present in the brilliant pieces
"The Adaptive Geometry Of Trees" (halogen bulb, water, tree)
and "How frees Are Made" (silkscreen on birch paneling,
sawhorses, fishing line).

The first is a severed tree branch grown inside of a box; the
second is an assembled hand-designed model of an oak tree
complete with three birds, that hangs from the ceiling by an al
most invisible thread over stacks of uncut models that lie on top
of the sawhorses.
The comment is complex; the oak tree is the same tree we
have seen destroyed in the pictures. We are given the Orphic
power to create that tree, but in so doing we are actually con
suming more wood — thus raising the issue of self-examination
for inconsistencies in our approach to the environment and
consumption.
Rigo 97's "bnglish Only" (paint and charcoal on gallery wall)
is somewhat disappointing in light ol his several San Francisco
projects, most notably the "Innercity Home" mural on Sixth
Street off Interstate 280.
This artist, who changes his name every year, has created for
the exhibition three large gray areas covered with words from
California's 50 living Native American languages, while over
both doors large rectangular areas are striped a foreboding yel
low and black. Written in black beneath one rectangle is the
word "bnglish," and beneath the other is the word "only" writ
ten in the same style.
What is most striking about the site-specific installation is

that several ol the
Native American
words appear to
have been erased
and then rewrit
ten, sometimes
multiple times.
Although this is a
powerful state
ment about the
resiliency ol the
Native American
people in keep
ing their lan

guagc and tradition alive, Rigo
97's attempt to play off of the
phrase "the writing on the wall"
lacks real emotion or tension.
I he series of five pieces hang
ing along the north wall of the

gallery are almost too esoteric to understand. Although the Art
Department s flier claims Snyder's "individual pieces do not
make formal closure but hold their detail in finely calibrated con
stellations," these textuallv lush and diverse pieces tail to work.
The combination of metals, wood, fabric and several other
highly textured substances is a commentary on the verv melding
together of such disparate elements, but the titles "throughout
the graces and greats we have had witness," "the thieving gob

lins," "a story of three wonderful beggars," "suffocate then spine"
and "wives mismatched to homes" simply fail to place and pre
sent the work. These are pieces of art that are meant to be made,
not viewed, and the lack of diversity from piece to piece in this
series of aesthetic nightmares is disappointing.
The show is a once-a-year opportunity for master of fine arts
students to engage the Stanford community in an artistic dia
logue. The exhibit is well-structured, it's free, and it's good
enough to warrant a change in the system: How about making it
more than an annual event and letting the first-year students ex
hibit work at a separate show as well?
There's no reason not to go; if you don't like it, you can leave.
And if you do, you can support the artists and the art program
here at Stanford. H

This year's muster ol fine arts exhibition will be at the Stanford
Gallery through lime 15. Admission is free.

Intermission talked with mastei of fine arts student Gregory
Lwi Nietneycr, otic offive graduates exhibiting work at the
Stanford Gallery. His installation is entitled "Clear Cut."
Intermission: What motivated you to create "Clear Cut"?
Gregory Lam Niemeyer: One of the bedroom ceilings
of the Hearst Castle is really a 13th-century ceiling.
(William Randolph) Hearst had it brought over here from
Italy for his castle, and when he found out it was too big he
had it cut up into pieces that would fit.
I think that's a pretty radical approach to art, but 1
found this to be a really good metaphor for what we actu
ally often do in different ways. Nationally, internationally,
at home and with friends, there's a tremendous amount of
cutting and splicing — we take what we can and then cut
and run.
I use a lot of paper in my art, and this piece really helped
me understand my relationship to my materials. 1 think it's
better to criticize what you are doing than to criticize what
you aren't doing.
I: Where are the photographs you use from?
GLN: The pictures I took myself from areas where the
Simpson Co. and Pacific Lumber are operating up in Ar
cada. I used appropriated photographs to work out issues
of positioning in unusual places (like the gallery), and then
I began using my own photographs.
It's liberating to work with other people's work because
the emotional investment is not as intense, and I tried to
transfer that sense of liberation to my work with my own
images. My images are very specific to my art. They fit
more specifically to my intentions, and 1 have a more inti
mate understanding of them.
1: How did you deal with positioning the pieces of your in
stallation in space?
GLN: Three of the five artists were doing wall pieces, so
the wall space was highly contested. I was excited to use the
ceiling and other spaces, and 1 feel that the ceiling really de
fines the other pieces of my installation and their posi
tions. For example, the piece "Going West" points west,
and it marks the boundary between healthy forest and de
stroyed forest.
i wanted to create a space that you could walk into from
any angle and leave from any angle, so there's no real order
to the pieces. So I tried to mark the corners to make it like
an open cell with permeable surfaces. And I wanted to cre
ate a distinctive feeling when underneath the ceiling. It's
like a glass house or womb within the gallery.
For "Landscaping," 1 mounted the photographs
straight on the wall because 1 distrust frames. They're a tra
ditional form of presentation that assume a certain narra
tive that I wanted to get away from. So the wall itself is the
frame; some photographs are even aligned with the archi
tectural edges ot the walls that reinforce the ending of the
piece, which 1 hoped repeated the theme of cutting.
/.* Does the open-ended aspect of your piece force it to in
teract with the other artwork and their materials?
GLN: Yes. My piece is also a comment on the room it
self as a manifestation of power over nature. That place
used to be a redwood grove, the remnants of which are still
next to it. The grove had to be clear cut to make room for
the gallery.
