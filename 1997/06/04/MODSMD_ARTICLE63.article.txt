## Director Peter Greenaway on text, sex and the death of cinema 
### Wendy Lee 
THERE IS A surreal scene in PeterGreen
away's latest film, "The Pillow Book," in
which the camera pans down a young
mans chest that is covered with calligraphy.
The music is the anthemic, Third Reich-esque
beginning of U2*s song, "Daddy's Gonna Pay
for Your Crashed Car."
Then, as the song changes into a techno
beat, we watch the man (played by Ewan Mc-
Gregor) reveal that his whole body is lavishly
decorated with Japanese characters, turning
the scene into a weird parody of a striptease.
Yet there is method about this madness for
British director Greenaway.
Greenaway's films are known for their visu
al extravagance and outrageous subject matter.
He's also known for working with actors at
times when they have not yet become Holly
wood property — such as Ralph Fiennes and
Julia Ormond, both in "Baby of Macon"
(1993) — and for taking on venerable British
actors such as loan Plowright in "Drowning by
Numbers" (1988), John Gilgud in "Prospero's
Books" (1991) and Helen Mirren and Michael
Gambon in " The Cook, The Thief, His Wife
and Her lx>ver" (1989).
It was this last film that brought Greenaway
out of art-house obscurity in America. The full
frontal nudity of its stars, adulterous sex, psy
chological and vis

ceral violence — all
combined with
haute cuisine —
were the sensational
ingredients.
And in Green
away's latest film,
these elements are
just as essential, ex
cept that the act of

"It's all an excuse for me to indulge in
different ways,, on lots and lots of
different levels, in a celebration of text
and sex! 112 — Peter Greenaway

writing on the body with a brush and ink takes
the place of the food fetish.
The pillow book of the film's title refers
specifically to the writing of a courtesan
named Sei Shonagon from the Japanese Impe
rial court in the 10th century. It also takes on
special meaning as the life story of the film s
main character, Nagiko, played by Vivian Wu.
The story centers around her personal jour •

ney as she competes with a publisher for
the affections jof a English translator
named jerome (McGregor). To get the at
tention of the publisher, who incidentally
also worked with her calligrapher father,
Nagiko sends first Jerome and then other
men to him with their bodies covered in
elaborately written poems about love,
death and rebirth.
Thus, the body becomes both a work of
art and literature.
"Without any attempt to illustrate the
book in any way, I would take some of its
sensitivities, primarily the major sensitiv
ity that Sei Shonagon said, 'Wouldn't the
world be desperately impoverished if we
didn't have literature and we didn't ac
knowledge our own physicality?'" Green
away said.
"And the movie is just about that, lt'sall
an excuse for me to indulge in 1,000 differ
ent ways, on lots and lots of different levels,
in a celebration of text and sex."

The film is not only a celebration but also a
response to Greenaway's general sense of anxi
ety and disquiet about our cinema, "a cinema
which is predicated on text."
"Whether your name is Spielberg or Scots*
csc or Wenders or Goddard, there's always a
necessity to start with text and finish with
image," he said. "I think it makes it highly
questionable (whether| we really feel confi
dent that cinema is an autonomous medium
that creates its own product. Why do we have
to keep running off to the bookshelf all the
time?"
In his quest for moving away from a text
based narrative, Greenaway has looked toward
different methods to provide structure for his
films.
"My search all the time," he said, "is to find
alternative systems for organizing material.
'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"
is based on a color-coded system. 'A Zed and
Three Noughts' is based upon the alphabet.
'Drowning by Numbers' stands for itself.
"There are other ways of trying to finding
taxonomies or strategies or ways of organizing
material, which I personally take very largely
from 20th-century painting."
Greenaway originally trained to be a painter
in London. Among his influences is the Dutch
artist Piet Mondrian; in particular, he was in
fluenced by Mondrian's conception of the

frame. In"The Pillow Book," Green away uses
an unconventional screen ratioand overlays to
create a visual montage on the screen.
"The screen isonly a screen is only a screen,"
he said. "I would disagree seriously with
(French film theorist Bazin on the
knowledge that cinema is a window on the
world. It is an artificial construct which is con
tained in its own conventions and devices, and

I think wc should acknowledge that in a very
self-conscious way."
As an art student, Greenaway was also inter
ested in the painting at the end of the 19th cen
tury that had a strong Oriental influence, often
called japonaisepe or chinoiserh; This predilec
tion led to his discovery of Shonagon's work.
"No particular requirement of my educa
tional sort of background or examination
caused (me) to examine the literature as well,
but just out of curiosity 1 did," Greenaway ex
plained. "1 went my way back through the !do
period, all the way right back to the Heian and
found this extraordinary book, very much
aware that a whole series of women were writ
ing at ibis lime."
Greenaway said that in some ways these
women were creating the Japanese language
"because it was the females at that time writ ing
quietly in their very dark interiors, incredibly
circumspect in their 1,001 robes, not allowed
to move, basically being, 1 suppose, wombs
and nothing else.*
A pillow book was a diary or a journal kept
inside the wooden pillow that Heian Dynasty
aristocrats of the 10th century laid their heads

on when they went to sleep at night.
Fast-forward about 1,000 years to when the
first translation of Shonagon's pillow book
into English was done by an Englishman
named Arthur Weilly. Greenaway was fascinat
ed by this man who introduced the Western
world to a culture that was, at that particular
time, hardly known at all.
"There is a way that Jerome (in 'The Pillow
Book ) is Arthur Weilly," Greenaway said. He
added that Weilly was "a man acting as a cata
lyst, introducing the notions of this ancient
text into a modern world, which in a sense is
what Jerome does in the film because he is the
catalyst that turns Nagiko and makes her es
sentially the pen. Because ultimately, to be vul
gar, the woman ends up on top."
The personal discovery that Greenaway
made about Shonagon's pillow hook was of the
Japanese hieroglyph as both image and text
and that cinema would be the ideal place to ex
plore that relationship.
He also became fascinated by the East,

where the "notion of culture is not divisive like
ours is in the VVest where we separate painters
and writers." The film's setting of Hong Kong
aptly provides the meeting of East and West, as
does the interracial love story between Nagiko
and Jerome.
The 5,000-year-old tradition of calligraphy
also appealed to Greenaway's sensibilities as an
artist.
"We're already talking about predominant
ly a system of communication whose days are
numbered because the whole world now is
horribly sated on the notions of the Western al
phabet and the conveniences of the computer
and the fax machine," he said.
Bui what he found most intriguing about
the hieroglyph is the tact that it is made by the
body and not a machine.
"I can draw the figure of a man," he said,
"that single gestural movement which is trade
by the body to express the notion of man in so
many thousand different ways - r its feminine
nature or whether it's old or rich or poor or de
cayingor dying. I can't make the letter 'A' do that
in the same sort of way, so there's a great excite
ment about the sheer visual energy that's con
tained in this sort of idea."

Greenaway quoted Lacan in hrnv
the body makes the text: "What lie ar
gues is about how important it is that
the mind is influencing the arm and
the arm is influencing the hand ami
the hand the pen."
Greenaway felt that, for example,
the act of typewriting has caused US t<>
have "broken that magic connection
between the notion of physically mak
ing the mark that signifies by this me
chanica! reproduction, which leads us
to lots of other propositions. Let's sup
pose, certainly, as our new prime min
ister in Great Britain has promised,
that every child of five will be given its
own free computer. Does this mean in
three decades we won't need to learn
to handwrite anymore?"
"The Pillow Book" deals directly
with the notion of "the book Ixung a
body and the body being a book."
Greenaway cited phrases common in
our language such as "I can read you

like a hook" or "Your life is an open page.' I le
believes that his film, with its healing motifs
"reflects the sense of unrest and anxiety ahout
notions ahout the machine age or the postima
chine age or the postelectronic age."
Film, he said, is a modern language that
comes from the electronic age. Hut in juxta
posing it with the ancient «irt form of calligra
phy as he does in"The Pillow Hook," he feels
that he "can make the present and the future
relate and blend optimistically with the past."
However, Greenaway did not sound partic
ularly optimistic about the condition of cine
ma in its present form.
"There are very, very few films that I can
think of that have actually created true cine
ma," he said. He cited Alain Resnais' 1961 fdrn
"Im\ Year at Marienbad" as one of the only
films that "approach the notion of real true
cinematic intelligence."
That film was based loosely on a novel by
