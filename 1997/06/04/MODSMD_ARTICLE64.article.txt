# Naked, nervous and nowhere to go
## Director Gregg Araki ends his teen apocalyptic trilogy with a bang 
### 
When you re a teenager, everything seems to take
on a hyper-reality. Relationships, material pos
sessions, the need to lit in with the-"cool' crowd
it's a wonder the young adults of today, the hope and fu
ture ol our nation, don't implode into a sticky pool of spent
passion from the pressures of being a teen.
It's with that kind of attitude that writer, director and
producer Gregg Araki conceives the characters and plot
lines for his films. His credits include " Totally Fucked Up"
(1993), a roller-coaster story about the relationships of a
close-knit group of gay and lesbian teens, and"The Doom
Generation" (1995), a tale ol sexual metamorphosis.
Araki's films have won critical acclaim lor being on the
cutting edge and uninhibited in their exploration of the
erotic. Most people either love or hate Araki's films. Per
sonally, I think the Araki's films are extraordinary because
they make you think. Most films I've seen about teenagers
growing up are utterly insipid, playing into cliched charac
ters that meander toward a predictable, saccharine ending.
Once in .1 while, however, there comes a film that goes
p.ist convention; its sharp social commentary cleverly
masked behind a twisted plot 110 one really expects.
"I leathers' and "Drugstore Cowboy" were two such films.

They re outlandish flicks
whose warped sense of

what's important and moral in the teen world made the au
dience contemplate the unbelievable sensorv overload
teens face growing up.
Hut the problem with doing another film like "Drug
store Cowboy" is having to surpass the creative plot — how
do you outdo something so cool? It's the problem of stay
ing 011 the cutting edge without being sliced up. Once peo
ple know you're cool, what you're doing isn't cool anymore
because everyone out there is parroting (or "pirating" may
be the better term) your ideas. This can get particularly bad
in Tinseltown because any breakthrough concepts imme
diately get copied and proliferated.
Araki has made films that fall into category of the iiber
cool. like the man himself said when 1 had the opportuni
ty to speak to him, "I'm into making art films with mean
ing, not some dry and dull production."
People who have seen Araki's films never say they are
trite or hackneyed. They always evoke an emotional re
sponse. 112 Rom my resident fellow, a communication profes
sor who called Araki "excessively and obsessively graphic,"
to one friend who thinks of him as "the filmmaker for Gen
eration X," anyone who has seen an

Araki film has something more to say
than the common, "Oh, it was a good /
bad movie."
Araki's latest film, "Nowhere," is the
finale in his teen apocalypse trilogy,
which began with "Totally Fucked Up"
and continued with "The Doom Cien
eration.' The title aptly reflects the
thoughts of the lead character, Dark
Smith (played by James Duval) who
says, "1..A. is like nowhere; everyone
here is lost."
It took a while for Duval's face to
click in my head, but lie's the guy who
played the crazy Vietnam vet's son in
"Independence Day." Because Araki's
films are so cultisli, they attract star*-
even though his films don't come close
to having a big-studio budget. It's
bizarre to see people like lohn Ritter
playing a televangelist or Shannon 1 >0
herty and Tracy lords sitting at a bus
stop gossiping about fashion — well
maybe not that strange — but you have
to see the outfits they're wearing to u 11
derstand whv the scene was trulv hilar
ious.
"Nowhere" is set in that most
bizarre fantasyland we call Los Ange
les. (Think about it; have you ever met
anyone who is "normal' and from
1..A.?) It follows a day 111 the life of a
group of teens, of whom Dark is the
central personality. He is desperately
looking for commitment and love
from his girlfriend, Mel (Rachel I'rue
from"The Craft"), who prefers to toy
with his emotions. In the space of one
day, Dark's friends separately experi
ence love, suicide, carjacking, murder.
S&M, drugs and even an alien abduc
tion.
The film is quite graphic; there is
lots of violence, the sex scenes are ver\
erotic and the dialogue is dirtier than
the men's bathroom in any dorm after
a three-day weekend. But all the sce
narios, with the exception of the alien

abduction, are within the realm of reality. You might even
know people like Dark's friends, or maybe you could cati
gori/.e yourself as one of the characters.
Araki said the characters are not based from his own life.
"But they are personal in that they are based on some real
ity I've observed or image I've seen and remembered," he
said.
From the way he described it, Araki himself seems to
have led a fairly sedate life. From growing up in Santa Bar
bara, Calif., to going to film school at USC, the 30some
thing writer / director would probably never be recognized
out 011 the street. It's as though his films are a total oppo
site to what he is like. While his films are graphic and out
spoken, Araki was unwilling to reveal details about himself
(such as whether lie currently has a boyfriend) aside from
what was pertinent to the film. The only connection be
tween himself and his films (other than the obvious) seems
to be the complexity hidden beneath a veneer of straight
forwardness.
Araki's films are incredibly dense — "lots of layers," he
said — with loaded terminology, hidden significance and
meaning, lake Montgomery, played by Nathan Bexton, a
fellow infatuated with Dark. He has an utterly angelic look,
and one eye is green while the other is blue.
Araki told me to interpret Montgomery's appearance in
any way I wanted, but his main point was "to make Mont
gomery different from every other 18-year-old out there."
Indeed, the characters in "Nowhere" are not meant to fit
into any convenient stereotype.
"I hate to make any generalizations about teens," Araki
said. "They're not a demographic to be categorized. The
only generalization I make in my films is that these teens
are searching for something. They're not quite sure what
they are looking for, but there is a deep longing and wanti
ng to find something."
In one of the most intimate moments in the movie, Dark
and Montgomery lie side by side in bed, naked, nervous
and looking for the right words to say.
"All my life," Montgomery says, "I've been searching for
the one special person 011 this awful scary planet whom I
can love and who will love me for what I am."
Oh, aren't we nil, only Montgomery will have an easier
time of it because he's gorgeous.
"We found him out in Bakersfield," Araki said of Bexton.
"He'd never done a movie before but when we saw him we
knew he was perfect for the part." The very fact Bexton was
found 111 near the middle of nowhere gives him a certain
aura of innocence.
Dark, Duval's character, is also a stunning figure and
was a point of a debate between myself and Araki. I asked
why Araki, in doing an otherwise great job of having a pan
racial cast, neglected to give a role to any Asians.
"What do you think Duval is? He's Asian," Araki point
ed out.
I said I )uval might be half Asian, but he certainly doesn't
look Asian.
"I've gotten a lot of criticism for not representing an
Asian 111 my films when in fact I've had an Asian 111 a cen
tral role 111 all my films," Araki ..aid. "I'm not into stereo
typing by how one looks or acts."
I could see his point. One could never guess Araki him
self was Asian except by his last name or meeting him in
person.
As for the graphic nature of his films, Araki surprised
me by saying, "I don't like violence in my movies. I turn
away from it, but when I do use it in my films, it's not done
for shock value, like in a lot of other films. For me it's more
an expression of chaos in the character's world."
Maybe, but in"The Doom Cieneration," one of the main
characters gets his private part "Bobbitized" by a crew of

"The only gen
eralization I
make in my
films is that
these teens are
searching for
something.
They're not
quite sure what
they are look
ing for, but
there is a deep
longing and
wanting to find
something."

gay bashers. In
"Nowhere," there
is this one partic
ularlv nasty S&M
scene that had
me grasping at
two certain areas
on my pectorals
in sheer pain, just
thinking about
what those two
girls did to Bart
(played by Jere
my Jordan), an
other one of
Dark's acquain
tances. (Look
carefully at our
cover this week
and you may see
what I mean.)
but those are
fairly minor de
tractions from
Araki's films,
which I genuine
ly feel are well
done because
they are provoca
tive instead ol
bland, they're
filled with social
commentary and
you have to look
11 n d e r 11 e a th
what's going on

iii front of your eyes and understand what the characters
Lire actually thinking. It's partly like sight gags in comedies
liki "The Naked Gun" or "Police Squad" where something
is going on m the background and il vou re not watching or
listening carefully enough vou ll miss it.
With Araki's films, symbolism can be obvious, like in
The Doom Generation" where all the price totals rung up
>it stores turn out to be $6.66 — a sign that the three main
characters are heading for hell. Others are not so blatant, like
the fact that these characters are always stopping at a conve
nience store, never a supermarket, a cafe or restaurant,
showing that they're always eating on the run, running not
only from the law but their own twisted and confused lives.
But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of "Nowhere'
and its predecessors is Araki's interpretation of sexual and
emotional relationships among people. We are used to
thinking of the man-woman monogamous dating situa
tion .is the social paradigm. In "Nowhere," Dark is trapped
in this mindset and is driven mad bv his girlfriend Mel sin
sistence that "humans are made to spread love to each
other as much as possible." While she is ultimately com
mitted to him and loves him dearly, she doesn t want to be
tied down to one person — not iust yet.
Her comments hit an interesting point. What some
would consider .slutty or a miserable failure to commit,
others would see as being completely realistic. Rather than
serial monogamy" or being constrained by racial and gen
der classifications, the characters in Araki s teen apoca
Ivpse trilogy explore love and intimacy on their own terms.
It a gu\ enjoys intimacy with another guy, he s not by de
fault gav, or if a black woman goes out with a white woman
(or man), she's not rebelling against the black community.
What if two people are genuinely fond of each other but are

interested in other people on
the side?
As Araki's films show,
teen relationships are a
ridiculous oxymoron. How
many people end up marry
ing their high school sweet
hearts? More appropriately,
how many end up divorcing
their high school sweet
hearts? The relationships in
his films show that so long as
there is a common under
standing, it shouldn't matter
if one person wants to expe
rience intimacy with some
one else. It's because people
are hobbled by insecurity
and social norms which have
failed to adapt to the realities

of the pressures teens face
today that cause a lot of angst in the IS- to 22-year-old
group. (iay or straight, 1 >ark shows how constrained everv
one can he when striving tor the idea ol the hetero monog
anions relationship.
All too often, movies today are much like the sot ial par
adigms Araki attacks in his films. I he\ re jusi meaningless
