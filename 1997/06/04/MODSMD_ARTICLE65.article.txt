## The 						Robert Cray Band "Sweet Potato Pie" 
### 
I le'sgot the soul of Sam and Dave, the wailing
ot'Al Green, the horns of the '70s, great bluesy
guitar riffs and the kind of finger-snapping swing
God usually reserves for trees in the wind.

There is some serious blues/ soul fusion
going on here, lolks, and il lasts throughout the
album.
Perhaps the only downfall ol the release is ih.it

the sound doesn't really vary much as the album
progresses. It's a whole lot of the same. Granted,
the stuff that's on there is fun, but it does get a lit
tle repetitive, to the point where you can predict

when a horn solo will come in.
Hut that is also what makes
the album great — it's easily
compared to what has been pro
duced by older artists. So what
does the album add other than
more material in a particular
style? (iood sounds.
My take on selected tracks....
Track one: "Nothing against
You" is a song made to snap to. It
swings and you just have to
smile as the chorus comes on.
Hut cheery as the music
sounds, the words are just de
pressing: "Nothingagainst you /
If I don't speak / II I pass you
by / look away when we
meet / If I turn my back / walk
away / (chorus) lust leave me
alone /to myself for a

while / and lot me be."
Vet the words don't seem inappropriate to the
music because of Cray's singing voice — it's the
pained strained singing sound that Otis Redding

was so adept at that makes this song move.
Track two, "Do It for Me," is another swinging
song with a sound that could've just as easily
come off of a "Sounds of the Late '70s" compila
tion. This is my favorite song on the album.
More great lyrics, and more great music: "Now
you've got my love, baby / give me some of
yours/would you do that for me?/Do it for
me / Clotta make you mine baby / give some more
time / would you do that for me / do it for me."
The words aren't that moving by themselves,
but the way they are phrased on the album is so
friendly and playful that they don't sound half
bad. It's a flirtatious song, which is always one of
the best kind.
Track 10: "I Can't Quit." The snare drum dom
inates the song, keeping it going almost like a
train engine, keeping time by playing on every
beat — it keeps the song from quitting, like the
song itself says:"I can't quit / loving you /1 can't
quit / darling, I'm hypnotized by the things that
you do / You lilt me up when I'm feeling
down / make me forget why I'm blue / There's no
need to wake me up now, baby /1 belong to you.
This song is no different from the rest: You
gotta move, you gotta groove, you gotta get down
to the song (if you're into '70s / soul / blues a la
Otis Redding/ Wilson Pickett).
