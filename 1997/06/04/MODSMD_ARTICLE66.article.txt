## "Trailer Park" 
### 
Hooray lor beautiful, jangling electro
acoustic indie folk rock. Belli Orion's debut solo
album is.i masterpiece ol finely cralted songs that
meld into a fantastic listening experience. This
album is 59:38 minutes ol simply blissful, melod
ic mood rock.
The artistry of "Trailer Park" is evident in the
finesse used to layer ()rton's simultaneously grit
ty aiul sensuous vocals over easy grooves that
range from folk to pop to trance. With music
more subtle than Sheryl ( tow, more varied than
Sarah Mil achlan, more accessible than Suzanne
Vega and more cerebral than I vel, Orton has
put together the pieces of her ama/ing artistry
into a coherent whole.
The sensitive, down to earth perspective of
the lyrics is t. learly C >i ton's own. She sings from
her heart, rejecting the (post)modernist de
mand that a poet reject one's lyric ego. The
woman behind that artistic sense is further
confirmed in the concise, somewhat existential
liner notes:
"One more thing. .. gender is just an excuse,
relationships shouldn't be an excuse, love is often
an excuse, although sometimes these excuses arc
all we have to hold onto, death is the reason and
living is the celebration."
"Trailer Park" starts with the folky rocker "She
Cries Your Name," using both sustained elec
tronic tones and drawn out string instruments
to create a bed of soaring sounds beneath gentle
acoustic picking and a funky drum beat. Ihe
trancy "Tangent" follows with eery, hauntinu

organ notes that develop into a mellow groove.
"Don't Need A Reason" is a gentle acoustic
tune that showcases Orton's magnificent vocals.
"I'm calling angels down to F.arth / and I don't
need a reason," she sings, neither defending nor
explaining herself but simply relishing the
process.
Orton's crafting of this album as a whole en
tity is evident in the placement of "Live as You
I )ream." She uses the short, upbeat pop tune to
raise the energy level of the album after the
slowing of "Tangent" and "Don't Need a Rea
son'' with excellent effectiveness. She then
maintains that tempo with the melodic folk
rock "Sugar boy."
The sparse " loucli Me with Your Love" ranges
from soft spoken word to easy groove to deep
trance, with I nya-escjue ambient harmonies in
the background, smooth soft drumming and a
catchy bass riff. Orton's commanding vocals
drive "Whenever," a sweet acoustic folk-pop tune
that leads to the midtempo, bluesy "How Far."
These two tracks are the only weak links 011 the
album; although they are marked with Orton's
distinctive vocals, the music ami lyrics are simply
not as remarkable.
"Someone's Daughter" is an upbeat pop track
centered around a happy guitar riff that contrasts
well with the melencholic "1 Wish I Never Saw
the Sunshine." The latter is the only song 011 the
album that Orton is not credited with having a
part in writing, but her emotionally laden vocals
make the track.

Finishing with the funky "Galaxy of Empti
ness" was another brilliant piece of album
crafting. An extended mellifluous groove that
gives "Trailer Park" a full sense of closure,
"(ialaxy of Emptiness" brings together the pop,
folk and trance elements of Orion's musician
ship.
I'm not kidding about this album. It is easily
one of my top 10 albums (to date) of 1997.
