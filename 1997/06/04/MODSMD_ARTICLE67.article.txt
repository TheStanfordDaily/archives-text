## "Pulsars" 
### 
Electronica may be "the next
big thing," but proponents of
rock's demise should check out
what happened during the last
big flirtation with electronic
music back in the 1980s. Key
boards and synthesizers seemed
like the wave of the future then,
too, but when was the last time
you heard a new song from Mod
ern English?
But wait! New wave isn't dead
— well, not quite. With their
self-titled debut, the Pulsars —
Chicago brothers David and
Harry Trumfio — drop a Casio
synthesizer-sized retro bomb
straight out of 1984, complete
with black shirts, sunglasses and
bad hair. The Pulsars aren't fool
ing around: This is a resurrection
of '80s synthesizer-pop at its
scariest.
The '80s references here are so
blatant that even though these
songs are new, you'll swear
you've heard them before. "Tun
nel," for instance, has stretches
that could be lifted verbatim
from "99 Luftballoons." The
other tracks are the same —
compare any one of them in with
the "Pretty in Pink" soundtrack
and you'll hardly know the dif
ference.
The Pulsars keep their music
current, however, by coupling it
with a dollop of'9os indie-rock
irony. Their brand of synth-pop
may sound cheesy today, but in
the '80s it was "futuristic," and
the Pulsars make skillful refer
ence to this transition from cut
ting-edge to chintz as they poke
fun at Macintoshes, robots and
other mainstays of Reagan-era
high tech.
This tongue-in-cheek tribute
to outdated technology may be a
little odd. But in the midst of
today's rabid high-tech hype, it
serves as a warning: lust because
electronica or the Internet is
touted as "the future" doesn't
mean that it's not going to end
up lame and dated a few years
from now. So hold onto that
Prodigy CD — in 10 years it'll be
as embarrassing as your Toto
collection.
