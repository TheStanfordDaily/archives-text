## Trial & Error 
### 
"Trial and Error" is a very bad movie.
Actually, to be honest, "Trial and Error"
is a very bad attempt at a movie.
Jeff Daniels stars as Charles Tuttle, a suc
cessful lawyer — if success is determined bv
the fact that he's just been made partner in
the firm owned by his fiancee's father. A few
days before the nuptials, Charles' future fa
ther-in-law sends him to a hole-in-the-wall
Nevada town to deal with a small family
problem that should only take a couple of
hours to remedy.
Of course, it takes much longer than
that. And, of course, hijinks ensue when
( harles best friend, Richard Rietti
Michael Richards, Kramer on "Seinfeld"),
shows up to throw Charles a bachelor party
ai his hotel. Thrown a little off-guard by a
beautiful waitress, Charles proceeds to get
completely trashed, participates in a bar
room brawl and wakes up in the morning
completely unable to function.
Kut, wonder ol wonders, Richard is an
actor looking to extend his limited acting
capabilities, and the next thing Charles
knows is that his totally incompetent best
buddy is pretending to be him in a court of

law. "This is a felony,"
Charles cries when he
realizes what's going
on.
Maybe, but the real
crime is that this
movie ever got made.
The worst part is how
all ol its female char
acters get completely
jacked at one point or
another. The cute
waitress, Charles'
spoiled-brat fiancee
and the female district
attorney (who is made
to look like a total
idiot in the court
room, despite the fact
that she is a real
lawyer) all end up hu
miliated at some
point. And by Daniels

and Richards' characters? Please! This is an
embarrassment to women everywhere.
Kssentially, there is not an original aspect
to "Trial and Hrror." Richards is the movie s

only bright spot, hut then lie's not actually
stretching himsell as an actor here. He's ha
sically playing Kramer, give or take a few
clumsy maneuvers and one liners. You'd he

better oil turning on the television and
watching "Seinfeld" — it's tree, and there's
no way it could he worse than this movie.
