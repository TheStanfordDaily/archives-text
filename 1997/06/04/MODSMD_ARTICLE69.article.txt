# Twin Town
## 
### 
"Twin Town" is a somewhat
uitty drama / comedy set in
Swansea, Wales, concerning the
absurd results of revenge taken en
tirely too far. Basically, the movie
is about two brothers (the "twins,"
played by I.lyr Evans and Rhys
llans) who decide to get even
when their father s employer re
fuses to pay their father (Huw
C.eredig) worker's compensation.
Meanwhile, two police officers
bumble their way around town
using sketchy methods of keeping
the peace.
I Ins movie is tilled to the brim
with raunchy vengeance, ranging
from peeing on karaoke singers to
beatings to killing poodles to
killing anyone else who gets in the
way. In other words, " Twin Town"
is a little — check that — a lot over
the top, though it does have a nia
soundtrack.

lliis rather disappointing
movie is the result of a script written and di
rected in actor / documentary filmmaker
Kevin Allen and produced by Danny Boyle
and Andrew Macdonald (who both worked
on " Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave").
However, none of the snappiness ol those
two films comes across in this one.
I ike "Trainspotting, Twin Town'

moves from place to place a lot and jumps in
and out of the lives of characters, but it is
completely incoherent. On that token, one
has to do some serious listening in order to
understand what's going on. Typically, it
takes about the first 10 or so minutes to at
climati/e to an accent in an l nglish speak
ing movie, but expect to go through more

than half tins
movie as con
I used a s .1 hip
[tie on Wall
Street.
And speaking
ol being out ol
one's element,
there seems to
he a lot ol
humor about .1
typical Welsh
f'amilv thai I
just could not
get. ()r perhaps
I did get it but
didn't think it
was all th.it
funny. C!learl \
there are some
cultural barri
ers that need t<>
be overcome in
order t<> truly
enjov "Twin
Town,' but I
was either too

critical, 100 American or too stupid to jump
over them.
A good side to this movie is that I wan
MacGregor, current representative of Scot
land, does not appear in this movie once. I
adore I wan, hut I have had enough. "Twin
Town" has only new faces in it (minus
Dougrav Scott, who plays one of the police

officers and has been in nothing anyone this
side of the Atlantic lias ever heard of) and
intentionally so. Ihe result is a cast tli.it
works well together, accents th.it are incom
prehensible and genuine and a pretty good
soundtrack. Buy the soundtrack. Skip the
movie.
