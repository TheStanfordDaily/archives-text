# The
						Pillow Book

Peter (ireenaway is arguably the most visually bizarre
filmmaker alive who's credited for being artsy and intellectu
al rather than just plain weird. I lis latest picture certainly de
livers on his other films' characteristics of random violence,
graphic sex and lushly photographed scenes.
"The Pillow Hook" is a modern telling of Sei Shonagon
collection of stories about a courtesan's life in 10th-century
Japan. The film chronicles the present-day coming-of-age ol
Nagiko (Vivian Wu of "The last Hmperor" and"The Joy
I uck (]lub"), .1 Japanese woman who grows up obsessed with
having calligraphy written on her body. As a (. hild, on each of
her birthdays her father writes .1 proverb on her face and her
aunt reads to her from Shonagon's pillow book. It is 011 one
of these nights that N.igiko witnesses her father making .1 sex
ual bargain with his publisher.
As .1 young woman, Nagiko flees Kyoto and a badly
arranged marriage for cosmopolitan (long Kong, where

she quickly rises as a fashion model. Here her calligraphy
fetish becomes erotic as she invites lovers to write on her
body. But Nagiko is always the paper and not the pen until
she meets Jerome (Hwan McGregor, in his pre-"Trainspot
ting" days), an Knglish translator who suggests that she
write upon him. This could be just another case of boy
meets-girl, girl-writes-on-boy, boy-falls-in-love-with-girl,
except a jealous publisher wants Jerome as his lover. This
man just happens to be the same one who blackmailed
Nagiko's father for sexual favors.
But, other than the gimmick of the body (literally) as a
book, this plot has relatively little significance. The strength
of this film — no surprise — is the way it looks; the interplay
among colors, the sensuous brush of black ink against the
skin. In a way this strategy works too well, leaving your eyes
saturated with images and leaving little breathing space. Per
haps in the attempt to capitalize on the techniques of televi

sion, the film uses a montage of screens within screens and
overlapping images. However, the overall look is more remi
niscent of MTV than anything particularly innovative.
This is film for film's sake, and unfortunately what gets lost
in the extravagant display of avant-gardism is a real story. I'he
characters never get beyond the level of attractive cardboard
cut-outs. Wu's Nagiko is an indifferent protagonist, and both
she and McGregor's Jerome bare their bodies but not their
souls. While sexual power and vengeance are among the main
themes, they are not adequately realized through the medium
of the writing fetish.
Greenaway has done better work in "Drowning by Num
bers" and"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,"
films in which themes and visuals cohere. This picture is un
deniably good to look at, but it once again proves that film
isn't just a series of beautiful images.
