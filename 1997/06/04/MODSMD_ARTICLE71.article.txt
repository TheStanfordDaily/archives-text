## A
						GRAND CARTOON DUO 
### 
Who has six legs (sometimes), four arms (usually),
two heads (hut only one brain) and a strange affection
for cheese?
Wallace and (iromit, that's who.
They're the latest, greatest human-canine duo to hit
the world ol clay mat ion. Wallace and (iromit's filmog
raphy only consists of three 30-minute cartoons, yet

they've inspired a huge following.
Wallace and (iromit have earned international at
claim lor their creator, director / animator Nick C ]lark.
All three lllms, "A (irand Day Out" (1989), " I he
Wrong Trousers" (1993) and "A (lose Shave" (1995)
were nominated for Academy Awards, and the last two
took home ()scars.
I or those of you who haven't hecn lucky enough to
see anv ol the cartoons, Wallace is an inventor whose

<. real ions tend to get out of hand. (iromit is h is faithful
dog who is always getting hi in out of trouble (sort of like Brain
in "Inspector (ladget"). Together they handle some really
wacky situations.
In their first cartoon, "A (.rand Day Out," Wallace is con
sidering vacation plans when he decides to fix his favorite
snack, cheese and crackers. When he sees that they're out of
cheese, he decides to travel somewhere where there's an end
less supply ol the skill: the moon.
lie and (iromit quickly build a rocket to complete their
trip. the moon, they have,..! the cheese they want, but first
they must deal with a coin operated security robot that looks
like a walkinu refrigerator.

It took Nick Park more than six years to produce "A Grand
Day Out" at the National Film and Television School in Bea
consfield, Kngland. All that work paid off, though; it got him his
first Oscar nomination and established a lovable set of characters.
The next cartoon, "The Wrong Trousers," is even funnier.
Park creates .1 terrifically goofy mood by introducing the title
.is if it were a horror film. The story centers around a strange
penguin who rents a room in Wallace's house when Wallace
runs short on cash.

Wallace has just invented the techno- trousers, a pair of re
mote-controlled legs intended to takellromit on walks. Un
fortunately, the mechanical pants fall into the handsof the evil
penguin, who uses them to commit a robbery. It's up to

Gromit, whom the penguin ousted from the house, to save
the day.
Here we can see a number of improvements in the ani
mation, which led to this film's Oscar. The backgrounds
and lighting are better. Park uses real sunlight to give the
work a more natural feel, and special effects like rain are in
tegrated seamlessly. The characters are also much
smoother; you can hardly tell that they're made from Plas
ticine. The Deneuin, with his beady, expressionless eves, is

an unforgettable villain.
Finally, there's "A Close Shave," which won a
second Oscar for Park. In another moneymaking
scheme, Wallace and Gromit are now window
washers (Gromit does all the work, of course)
who drive around in a nifty motorcycle. Wallace
falls for one of his customers, a wool-shop owner
named Wendolene.
Meanwhile, someone is stealing the local sheep
in a peculiar wool conspiracy. One of the sheep
turns up in Wallace's house and chews the place
up. Gromit gets framed for the crimes and ends
up in prison. Wallace has to break him out so
they can unravel the mystery.
The high-speed motorcycle scenes in this car
toon, including a few chases, are really fun. Park
overcomes technical challenges by using aerial
shots and scenes with dozens of cute little sheep.
Wallace and Gromit films are treats for adults
as well as kids. It's fun to watch a dog pour him
self coffee while reading the morning paper, or a

man whose sleeves aren't attached to his shirt. By the time
you've seen all three cartoons, you'll be humming along to
their theme song.
