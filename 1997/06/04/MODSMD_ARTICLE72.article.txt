Writer and English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino talks
about stale paradigms, a loathsome town called
Palo Alto, the Beat poets and New York in the 1950s

PROFESSORS AT UNIVERSITIES like Stanford who
don't have doctorates are mysterious.... How did they
get their jobs? Well, behind all that mystery often lies hid
den talent we may or may not see in the classroom.
In the case of Gilbert Sorrentino, an English professor for the
last 15 years, his resume is packed with lots and lots of words —
13 novels, 10 books of poetry, two translations and one book of
essays, to he exact. He also received the John Dos Passos Prize
lor literature, two Guggenheim Fellowships and an award for
literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. That's probably how he got the job.
Intermission unearthed his thoughts on high art, low art and
everything in between.
Intermission: What's the difference between what you're inter
ested in writingand what you havecalled "communicative"fiction?
Gilbert Sorrentino: Well, I'm not interested in that kind ot
fiction. It seems to me that the business of a writer is to make
something, and that's very different from using language to
lonvey ideas. I like the idea of making a poem or a novel that ex
ists in the world as a thing.
Now if you think of language as the medium by which that
kind of work can be produced, language becomes less transpar
ent. It becomes opaque and resists being used as a communica
tive device. It doesn't mean your language is gobbledygook or
impenetrable — it means that language calls attention to itself
as something made. And I think all good work, certainly all
good modernist work, operates like that.
I: You often quote texts from different time periods to support
i onr aesthetic. Is modernism something that became a movement
retrospectively, or was there a consciousness there?
(IS: I think modernism is indeed a movement. And 1 think
the basic impetus of modernism was the sense that there was no
longer the possibility for a communal art, for an art that spoke
to the people generally. You'd probably need a cultural histori
an to tell you exactly why this happened, but it certainly had
something to do with the fact that literary artists no longer felt
.is if language was theirs.
Somehow language had become a handmaiden to other dis
ciplines, and I think in the middle ot the 19th century artists
began to take the language back. You had (John) Locke s idea of
the poem, and I'm being reductive here, but Locke s idea of the
poem was essentially that it's a nice thing to curl up with on a
cold winter evening.
Well, that was the way poetry was thought of, not as some
thing that was there to wake you up but something that was there
to ... put von to sleep. Modernism changed that, but I think in
the process lost what might have been a larger audience.
Hut I don't think that is art's fault. Art is simply the sort of
thing that doesn't appeal toa large audience. Asa matter of tact,
I'm of the school that — and it is a highly criticized school
art that appeals to hundreds of thousands, it not millions, of
people is suspect. I can not believe that any real art can appeal
to that many people.
I: Like loni Morrison?
GS: Well, I don't know if she appeals to hundreds ot thou
sands of people, but she certainly is.. .a very safe person. Avery
safe artist. Not in terms of subject matter, certainly, but I ve
never been very interested in subject matter because subject
matter to me is simply part ot the form of any given piece.
I don't believe that there's a way of separating subject matter
and form at all. I don't believe you can say, Loni Morrison says
really interesting things about life, love and the pursuit of hap

piness, but I don't really like the way she writes."
/: One of the critical pieces you wrote for Kulchur magazine »%•<<>
very anti-pop art. Why don't yon like it?
(IS: Yes, in an old, old piece 1 wrote for Kulchur many years
ago, when the terminology wasn't even in place at the time and
[pop art | was called the new realism. Well, I really cut inv teeth
on abstract expressionism, and perhaps it's a romantic leftover,
but I think of abstract expressionism as the great art ol the ccn
tury — at least the great American art of the century.
The problem, I think, with popart is that it didn't know what
it wanted to do. You never knew whether the impulse was adu
latory or satiric. You didn't know whether Andy Warhol really
loved the idea of these iconic figures, likei Campbell's soup cans,
Brillo boxes and so on, or whether he was poking tun at the idea
of the iconic.
The joke was on us because it became quite clear in Andy's
career that what he was presenting to you as art he was not
shielding in any way; he was presenting a replication ot some
thing that you could never find the I 'rtext lor. You began to say,
"Gee, I wonder where that original (Campbell's soup can is that
Andy copied?"
Well, there was no original (Campbell's soup can. So essen
tially what Warhol's art said was, any( Campbell's soup can at am
point in history is exactly like my( Campbell's soup can. In otliei
words, "I'm not really makingart. What I'm letting you know is
that art is very much like the replication ot these iconic images.
Well, I thought this was just .1 weary reprise ot I >ada. I here
was no possible way that anybody could he shot ked by this stuff.
I: Speaking of art movements, m (mother interview, yon said
yon didn't huy the difference between postmodernism and mod
ernism.
(IS: Well, there are two schools ot thought here. Basically,
there are those who say postmodernism is an assault on mod

ernism and an at
tempt to till 111 p
modernism's ap
plecart, but I don't
see it that simply.
I think that
postmodernism is,
in essence, an ex
tension of late
techniques of high
modernism and an
address to ques
tions that were
posed but not
quite solved by
modernism. At
least (lames
Joyce's) "Ulysses,'
from the "Calyp
so" chapter on, is a
post m odern
novel. "I innegan's
Wake" is a post
modern novel.
"Watt" by Samuel
Beckett is a post
modern novel.
These were all
books, though, that
were published in

thehevdayol high modernism. So when you think ot artists like
that, you discover that there's 110 separating line between high
modernism and early postmodernism.
Many ot the things they do are the same: collage, Iragnienta
tion, intertextnality, intratextuality, etc. My leeling about this is
that there's a mindset which is postmodernism and a mind set
which is not. That doesn't mean that there's a dichotom) be
tween the works themselves.
Postmodernism also takes into account the idea ot popular
culture, popular art, popular this and popular that, as it mod
ernism didn't, but modernism did. Perhaps it didn t canonize
these things, which I think is perhaps something that shouldn't
be done anyway.
I mean, there's nothing the matter with popular ail or pop
ular culture, but you can't contuse it with other things, like a
play by Samuel Beckett. In other words, there may be a really in
teresting television show 011 which you say is lots ot tun to
watch, but its not like ( Beekett's) "I ndganie."
I: So yon wonltl preserve the ilistim tion between low and high
art?
(iS: ()h, absolutely. By the same token, I have 110 beet against
popular art or low art. I think it's perlectly terrific slut I. Ihe only
problem is that you c an t blur the ditferences.
I or example, people take umbrage it you sa\, "You know, I
really don't like the work ol 101111 ( heever. I don t think lies a

great scheme ot things, he's not Samuel Beckett, he s ih>i Marcel'

But people are annoved because what the\ think you re sa\

It's like saying television commercials are hiilli.inl 111 lenns ol
