Writer and English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino talks
about stale paradigms, a loathsome town called
Palo Alto, the Beat poets and New York in the 1950s

PROFESSORS AT UNIVERSITIES like Stanford who
don't have doctorates are mysterious.... How did they
get their jobs? Well, behind all that mystery often lies hid
den talent we may or may not see in the classroom.
In the case of Gilbert Sorrentino, an English professor for the
last 15 years, his resume is packed with lots and lots of words —
13 novels, 10 books of poetry, two translations and one book of
essays, to he exact. He also received the John Dos Passos Prize
lor literature, two Guggenheim Fellowships and an award for
literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. That's probably how he got the job.
Intermission unearthed his thoughts on high art, low art and
everything in between.
Intermission: What's the difference between what you're inter
ested in writingand what you havecalled "communicative"fiction?
Gilbert Sorrentino: Well, I'm not interested in that kind ot
fiction. It seems to me that the business of a writer is to make
something, and that's very different from using language to
lonvey ideas. I like the idea of making a poem or a novel that ex
ists in the world as a thing.
Now if you think of language as the medium by which that
kind of work can be produced, language becomes less transpar
ent. It becomes opaque and resists being used as a communica
tive device. It doesn't mean your language is gobbledygook or
impenetrable — it means that language calls attention to itself
as something made. And I think all good work, certainly all
good modernist work, operates like that.
I: You often quote texts from different time periods to support
i onr aesthetic. Is modernism something that became a movement
retrospectively, or was there a consciousness there?
(IS: I think modernism is indeed a movement. And 1 think
the basic impetus of modernism was the sense that there was no
longer the possibility for a communal art, for an art that spoke
to the people generally. You'd probably need a cultural histori
an to tell you exactly why this happened, but it certainly had
something to do with the fact that literary artists no longer felt
.is if language was theirs.
Somehow language had become a handmaiden to other dis
ciplines, and I think in the middle ot the 19th century artists
began to take the language back. You had (John) Locke s idea of
the poem, and I'm being reductive here, but Locke s idea of the
poem was essentially that it's a nice thing to curl up with on a
cold winter evening.
Well, that was the way poetry was thought of, not as some
thing that was there to wake you up but something that was there
to ... put von to sleep. Modernism changed that, but I think in
the process lost what might have been a larger audience.
Hut I don't think that is art's fault. Art is simply the sort of
thing that doesn't appeal toa large audience. Asa matter of tact,
I'm of the school that — and it is a highly criticized school
art that appeals to hundreds of thousands, it not millions, of
people is suspect. I can not believe that any real art can appeal
to that many people.
I: Like loni Morrison?
GS: Well, I don't know if she appeals to hundreds ot thou
sands of people, but she certainly is.. .a very safe person. Avery
safe artist. Not in terms of subject matter, certainly, but I ve
never been very interested in subject matter because subject
matter to me is simply part ot the form of any given piece.
I don't believe that there's a way of separating subject matter
and form at all. I don't believe you can say, Loni Morrison says
really interesting things about life, love and the pursuit of hap

piness, but I don't really like the way she writes."
/: One of the critical pieces you wrote for Kulchur magazine »%•<<>
very anti-pop art. Why don't yon like it?
(IS: Yes, in an old, old piece 1 wrote for Kulchur many years
ago, when the terminology wasn't even in place at the time and
[pop art | was called the new realism. Well, I really cut inv teeth
on abstract expressionism, and perhaps it's a romantic leftover,
but I think of abstract expressionism as the great art ol the ccn
tury — at least the great American art of the century.
The problem, I think, with popart is that it didn't know what
it wanted to do. You never knew whether the impulse was adu
latory or satiric. You didn't know whether Andy Warhol really
loved the idea of these iconic figures, likei Campbell's soup cans,
Brillo boxes and so on, or whether he was poking tun at the idea
of the iconic.
The joke was on us because it became quite clear in Andy's
career that what he was presenting to you as art he was not
shielding in any way; he was presenting a replication ot some
thing that you could never find the I 'rtext lor. You began to say,
"Gee, I wonder where that original (Campbell's soup can is that
Andy copied?"
Well, there was no original (Campbell's soup can. So essen
tially what Warhol's art said was, any( Campbell's soup can at am
point in history is exactly like my( Campbell's soup can. In otliei
words, "I'm not really makingart. What I'm letting you know is
that art is very much like the replication ot these iconic images.
Well, I thought this was just .1 weary reprise ot I >ada. I here
was no possible way that anybody could he shot ked by this stuff.
I: Speaking of art movements, m (mother interview, yon said
yon didn't huy the difference between postmodernism and mod
ernism.
(IS: Well, there are two schools ot thought here. Basically,
there are those who say postmodernism is an assault on mod

ernism and an at
tempt to till 111 p
modernism's ap
plecart, but I don't
see it that simply.
I think that
postmodernism is,
in essence, an ex
tension of late
techniques of high
modernism and an
address to ques
tions that were
posed but not
quite solved by
modernism. At
least (lames
Joyce's) "Ulysses,'
from the "Calyp
so" chapter on, is a
post m odern
novel. "I innegan's
Wake" is a post
modern novel.
"Watt" by Samuel
Beckett is a post
modern novel.
These were all
books, though, that
were published in

thehevdayol high modernism. So when you think ot artists like
that, you discover that there's 110 separating line between high
modernism and early postmodernism.
Many ot the things they do are the same: collage, Iragnienta
tion, intertextnality, intratextuality, etc. My leeling about this is
that there's a mindset which is postmodernism and a mind set
which is not. That doesn't mean that there's a dichotom) be
tween the works themselves.
Postmodernism also takes into account the idea ot popular
culture, popular art, popular this and popular that, as it mod
ernism didn't, but modernism did. Perhaps it didn t canonize
these things, which I think is perhaps something that shouldn't
be done anyway.
I mean, there's nothing the matter with popular ail or pop
ular culture, but you can't contuse it with other things, like a
play by Samuel Beckett. In other words, there may be a really in
teresting television show 011 which you say is lots ot tun to
watch, but its not like ( Beekett's) "I ndganie."
I: So yon wonltl preserve the ilistim tion between low and high
art?
(iS: ()h, absolutely. By the same token, I have 110 beet against
popular art or low art. I think it's perlectly terrific slut I. Ihe only
problem is that you c an t blur the ditferences.
I or example, people take umbrage it you sa\, "You know, I

high art or is it something else'<
(iS: My work has been criticized as not being passionate
enough because it's worked out and posited in certain ways.
Well, I think that's done with TV commercials as well. They're
really worked out and of course they have an agenda, which is
to disappear after they're done.
That's what's interesting about art, though. Art is interesting
because it has an agenda which is artistic. In other words, it's
only there lor itself.
It's a pain in the ass, basically, art is, because it's saying,
"Look, von don't like me? < io home. You don't want to read this
book? Don't read it. This picture offends you? Don't look."
I: So when you go home, do yon rem! John (.'.heever anil watch
TV?
< iS: ()l course I do. I do all sorts of things. I watch TV. I
haven t read ( heever in .1 long time, but I think I've probably
read all of( heever. In other words, I have a place for all this stuff
111 my life. I here's a place for ( heever. there's a place for situa
tion comedy, and there's .1 place for Jackson Pollock and lean
(ienet you just can't start confusing them.
I unny thing, for many years it used to be (Hie ol the great
jokes, among inv friends anyway, that academics always pre
tended they didn't know anything about TV. I hey would say,
"TV? Well, sometimes I watch PUS, but I don't know anything
about TV."
As 11 there was something so sleazy and weird about television
that it would somehow infect their minds so that they could no
longer read the latest monograph on Milton. I here was this
weird academic snobbery that pretended that TV was so crass
that even to get near a set would somehow destroy them.
I remember years ago reading ... .1 commentary... by l ./ra
Pound, in which lie's talking about something ( onfucius ap
parently said in one ol his Analects, and he said and this is a
paraphrase "The wise man pays attention to that which

Art is simply the sort of thing thot doesn't appeal to o large audience, lis a matter of fact. I'm of the
school that — and it is a highly criticized school — art that appeals to hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of people is suspect.
—Gilbert Sorrentino

everyone is paying intention to. I le also pays attention to that
which no one is paying attention to."
In other words, we're living in a society which is drenched hv
mass media, and the most powerful of .ill those is TV. lb not
know what's going 011 there, it seems to me like you've stepped
outside of reality. I mean, where are you? I spec iallv it you think
you have something to say about reality.
I grant you, the tube is filled with the most moronic stuff the
world has ever known, but occasionally you see something ter
rifle, which ol course never lasts . . . hut that's not to say it was
never on the box.
Television can do marvelous things, it just doesn't because it's
a slave to the market. I he market will destroy everything — that's
what the market does. The market destroys art because it has no
use lor it; it won't sell products. The market has no animus against
art; they say, "1 ook, give us art il it sells, we love it."
I: In 11 reeent issue the New Yorker, aetnally, is Andy Warhol's
drawing ol ( hanel No. :> for a ( hand ad.
(IS: Sure, they don't care. Its iust that art is useless to them if
it doesn't make money, and most >rt doesn't, so that's why they
don't want it.
That's the wonderful thing about being an artist. An artist
doesn't have to please anybody. I le can sax all the wrong things.
I lecan bother people. I ledoesii i have to worn about a market.
I le doesn't have to worry about a thing. I le's a tree spirit.
I le's not going lo make am money being a tree spirit, prob
ably, but the point is he's not beholden loanvbodv, which is \cry
bothersome to people. It's especialh bothersome, I think, with
art, because people understand that art doesn't have to please a
market, but the\ don't quite understand that art doesn't have to
please anvbodv.
I: I low are the painters voii like best related to the writers von

like best?
CiS: Well, I'm talking about my generation only, and in the 's()s
in the (aty of New York, there was a very restless sense among
artists of all kinds that all of the paradigms that they had been pre
sented were worn out and stale. Everybody began to try to do
something different So I think the spirit of creation in that time
was that all artists had a sense that something new had to be done.
It was easier for a poet whose models were French surrealists
and French post-surrealists or the Black Mountain school, which
had gone back to the teachings of Pound and Williams — it was
easier for writers working 111 that vein to have a rapport with ab
stract painters than it was for poets and writers in that vein to have
.1 rapport with, if you will, academic poets and writers.
A poet would be closer to a painter who thought the same
way about deforming the idiogram than he would with a poet
whose work was anathema to him. The poets of the s()s, the
New York school, Black Mountain, the San Francisco renais
sance— the Beat poets, of course — I think everybody began to
think of those arts as more involved with process.
It was the process of doing it which most interested them.
And I think that s probably what was going on more than any
uniformity o! technique. Of course, I realize that's a sentimen
tal, perhaps romantic vision, but it's those artists to whom I feel
allegiance, and that's because that's my generation and I was a
young man when all this was going on.
I: Would vvii be culled u Bent poet?
(iS: When I was a young man, I was often grouped with Beat
poets, but I really wasn't a Beat poet. Of course, nobody knew
how to talk about anything in those days.
So if you were a poet who wasn t writing in what was though I
ofas the way one should write poetrv, then you were a Be ♦! poet,
no matter what you were doing. But there were very great dif
ferences among the poets — there was the New York School,
which was very different from the Beats, very different from the
Black Mountain School. . . but what was going on with all these
people is that they had the same basic attitude toward language,

the same basic attitude with their desire to knock over the ap
plecart.
There was a kind oficonoclasm about this poetry, which en
raged people because it was the '50s— people were really angry
at this stuff. And of course, its interesting, most of those poets
are in the Norton Anthology now.
The'soswerea wonderful time in a way. It was a terrible time
politically, socially and culturally. And yet, artistically it was a
time of enormous invention and freedom, probably because of
that — you had to get rid of this junk that was going on all
around you. It was a weird time to be alive.
And the Beats were this great breath of fresh air. It's very hard
to tell young people what that meant. I mean, when you first
heard or read Allen ((iinsberg)'s "I have seen the best minds ot
my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical,
naked" — everybody who read that said, "Right!"
It was like a call to arms. It was all happening at the same
time, and it was happening in New York. New York was a tan
tastic place in the 30s, truly remarkable.
/. How does tluii compare with Sou I'rancisco?
(iS: The problem with San Francisco — and I know this is
not defensible, and I don't expect to defend it, and I don't ex
pect to have any rational way ot dealing with this either be
cause it's irrational, I grant you that — San Francisco is
much too charming and pretty tor anything real to come out
ol it. Period. There's not enough grit. There's not enough
greed. There's not enough unpleasantness for art to he made.
/: Ami vou're living in Palo Alto how is that?
iiS: There are no words for Palo Alto in my vocabulary. I
have been in main places, like the old song goes I've been
in some big tow lis and heard me some big talk — but I have
never in mv entire life known of anv itv like Palo Alto. It is

smug,
provincial,
narrow
minded,
philis t i n e,
bigoted.. . .
It has no re
deem i n g
qualities. It is
a loathsome
town.
Here's a
classic story
about Palo
Alto. There
used to be two
galleries in
Palo Alto:
I.ucv Herman
Gallery and
Smith Ander
son Gallery.
They were
both extraor

dinarilv good galleries. Thev showed very good painters with
reputations, and they showed excellent painters who were he
ginning to get reputations — painters who had galleries in LA.
and New York
All their work was excellent; they showed really good stutl.
Smith Anderson and l.ucv Herman went out of business in the
same year — three or four years ago — and the reason they went
out of business was that they could not sell anybody in Palo Alto
any pictures. And yet these are people who think nothing of
spending $90,000 on an automobile.
I: Yon knew both Willem de Kooning anil Allen (iinsberg, right,
who both just recently died?
C IS: Yes, of course. I )e Kooning was a funny guv, and he said
marvelous things, and many times they were funny because of
his accent. But I didn't know him terribly well; he was older than
I — by the time I got to know him he was surrounded by ador
ing fans.
I suppose one of the funniest stories about De Kooning is
when he heard that Grace Kelly had gotten married to Prince
Rainier of Monaco. He had a crush on Grace; so when he was
sitting at the bar one day and heard that she got married, he sat
at that bar for about an hour and just muttered imprecations
against Prince Rainier under his breath.... How dare he marry
Grace!
And Allen (Ginsberg), of course, is a legendary figure. Allen
was a marvelous guy. He was sweet and charming, warm-heart
ed and generous, and the great thing about Allen was his work
was, "uneven," as they say, but I think the work of all really good
writers is basically uneven because they're not afraid of their
work.
They're not afraid to make mistakes. \ le did what he wanted
to do. I le did exactly what he wanted to do all his life long, and
he had a hell of a ride, Allen — he had a hell of a ride. I didn't
feel bad when he died. I was just surprised because I always
thought Allen Ginsberg would live to be 100 years old. He
seemed like the kind of man who would never die. De Kooning
almost made it to 100.
but to go back to those years, I think what was interesting
about the artists of the 50s was that they really had no vision of
the possibility of success. You never dreamed you'd ever make a
living doing what you did.
And I think that was probably very healthy because you
didn't think in terms of success. It was a lot of fun — nobody
had a pennv ... but we all made it. We weren't thinking of
money at all; I suppose we were basically crazy.
We were doing this for God knows what reasons, we were
naive and hopeful, as (Robert) ('reeley put it when he was here
a few years ago. When somebody in the audience asked Greeley
about those wars, he said something to the effect that what he
remembers about those years was that everybody was so ab
solutely serious.
It wasn't like, "let's do this because it'll be fun." It was like,
"We really have to do this." We were really writing for our
lives. U

It's a pain in the ass, basically, art is, because it's saying,
"Look, von don't like me? < io home. You don't want to read this
book? Don't read it. This picture offends you? Don't look."
I: So when you go home, do yon rem! John (.'.heever anil watch

< iS: ()l course I do. I do all sorts of things. I watch TV. I

"TV? Well, sometimes I watch PUS, but I don't know anything
about TV."
As 11 there was something so sleazy and weird about television
that it would somehow infect their minds so that they could no
longer read the latest monograph on Milton. I here was this
weird academic snobbery that pretended that TV was so crass
that even to get near a set would somehow destroy them.

everyone is paying intention to. I le also pays attention to that
which no one is paying attention to."
In other words, we're living in a society which is drenched hv
mass media, and the most powerful of .ill those is TV. lb not
know what's going 011 there, it seems to me like you've stepped
outside of reality. I mean, where are you? I spec iallv it you think
you have something to say about reality.
I grant you, the tube is filled with the most moronic stuff the
world has ever known, but occasionally you see something ter
rifle, which ol course never lasts . . . hut that's not to say it was
never on the box.
Television can do marvelous things, it just doesn't because it's
a slave to the market. I he market will destroy everything — that's
what the market does. The market destroys art because it has no
use lor it; it won't sell products. The market has no animus against
art; they say, "1 ook, give us art il it sells, we love it."
I: In 11 reeent issue the New Yorker, aetnally, is Andy Warhol's
drawing ol ( hanel No. :> for a ( hand ad.
(IS: Sure, they don't care. Its iust that art is useless to them if
it doesn't make money, and most >rt doesn't, so that's why they
don't want it.
That's the wonderful thing about being an artist. An artist
doesn't have to please anybody. I le can sax all the wrong things.
I lecan bother people. I ledoesii i have to worn about a market.
I le doesn't have to worry about a thing. I le's a tree spirit.
I le's not going lo make am money being a tree spirit, prob
ably, but the point is he's not beholden loanvbodv, which is \cry
bothersome to people. It's especialh bothersome, I think, with
art, because people understand that art doesn't have to please a
market, but the\ don't quite understand that art doesn't have to
please anvbodv.
I: I low are the painters voii like best related to the writers von

like best?
CiS: Well, I'm talking about my generation only, and in the 's()s
in the (aty of New York, there was a very restless sense among
artists of all kinds that all of the paradigms that they had been pre
sented were worn out and stale. Everybody began to try to do
something different So I think the spirit of creation in that time
was that all artists had a sense that something new had to be done.
It was easier for a poet whose models were French surrealists
and French post-surrealists or the Black Mountain school, which
had gone back to the teachings of Pound and Williams — it was
easier for writers working 111 that vein to have a rapport with ab
stract painters than it was for poets and writers in that vein to have
.1 rapport with, if you will, academic poets and writers.
A poet would be closer to a painter who thought the same
way about deforming the idiogram than he would with a poet
whose work was anathema to him. The poets of the s()s, the
New York school, Black Mountain, the San Francisco renais
sance— the Beat poets, of course — I think everybody began to
think of those arts as more involved with process.
It was the process of doing it which most interested them.
And I think that s probably what was going on more than any
uniformity o! technique. Of course, I realize that's a sentimen
tal, perhaps romantic vision, but it's those artists to whom I feel
allegiance, and that's because that's my generation and I was a
young man when all this was going on.
I: Would vvii be culled u Bent poet?
(iS: When I was a young man, I was often grouped with Beat
poets, but I really wasn't a Beat poet. Of course, nobody knew
how to talk about anything in those days.
So if you were a poet who wasn t writing in what was though I
ofas the way one should write poetrv, then you were a Be ♦! poet,
no matter what you were doing. But there were very great dif
ferences among the poets — there was the New York School,
which was very different from the Beats, very different from the
Black Mountain School. . . but what was going on with all these
people is that they had the same basic attitude toward language,

the same basic attitude with their desire to knock over the ap
plecart.
There was a kind oficonoclasm about this poetry, which en
raged people because it was the '50s— people were really angry
at this stuff. And of course, its interesting, most of those poets
are in the Norton Anthology now.
The'soswerea wonderful time in a way. It was a terrible time
politically, socially and culturally. And yet, artistically it was a
time of enormous invention and freedom, probably because of
that — you had to get rid of this junk that was going on all
around you. It was a weird time to be alive.
And the Beats were this great breath of fresh air. It's very hard
to tell young people what that meant. I mean, when you first
heard or read Allen ((iinsberg)'s "I have seen the best minds ot
my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical,
naked" — everybody who read that said, "Right!"
It was like a call to arms. It was all happening at the same
time, and it was happening in New York. New York was a tan
tastic place in the 30s, truly remarkable.
/. How does tluii compare with Sou I'rancisco?
(iS: The problem with San Francisco — and I know this is
not defensible, and I don't expect to defend it, and I don't ex
pect to have any rational way ot dealing with this either be
cause it's irrational, I grant you that — San Francisco is
much too charming and pretty tor anything real to come out
ol it. Period. There's not enough grit. There's not enough
greed. There's not enough unpleasantness for art to he made.
/: Ami vou're living in Palo Alto how is that?
iiS: There are no words for Palo Alto in my vocabulary. I
have been in main places, like the old song goes I've been
in some big tow lis and heard me some big talk — but I have
never in mv entire life known of anv itv like Palo Alto. It is

smug,
provincial,
narrow
minded,
philis t i n e,
bigoted.. . .
It has no re
deem i n g
qualities. It is
a loathsome
town.
Here's a
classic story
about Palo
Alto. There
used to be two
galleries in
Palo Alto:
I.ucv Herman
Gallery and
Smith Ander
son Gallery.
They were
both extraor

dinarilv good galleries. Thev showed very good painters with
reputations, and they showed excellent painters who were he
ginning to get reputations — painters who had galleries in LA.
and New York
All their work was excellent; they showed really good stutl.
Smith Anderson and l.ucv Herman went out of business in the
same year — three or four years ago — and the reason they went
out of business was that they could not sell anybody in Palo Alto
any pictures. And yet these are people who think nothing of
spending $90,000 on an automobile.
I: Yon knew both Willem de Kooning anil Allen (iinsberg, right,
who both just recently died?
C IS: Yes, of course. I )e Kooning was a funny guv, and he said
marvelous things, and many times they were funny because of
his accent. But I didn't know him terribly well; he was older than
I — by the time I got to know him he was surrounded by ador
ing fans.
I suppose one of the funniest stories about De Kooning is
when he heard that Grace Kelly had gotten married to Prince
Rainier of Monaco. He had a crush on Grace; so when he was
sitting at the bar one day and heard that she got married, he sat
at that bar for about an hour and just muttered imprecations
against Prince Rainier under his breath.... How dare he marry
Grace!
And Allen (Ginsberg), of course, is a legendary figure. Allen
was a marvelous guy. He was sweet and charming, warm-heart
ed and generous, and the great thing about Allen was his work
was, "uneven," as they say, but I think the work of all really good
writers is basically uneven because they're not afraid of their
work.
They're not afraid to make mistakes. \ le did what he wanted
to do. I le did exactly what he wanted to do all his life long, and
he had a hell of a ride, Allen — he had a hell of a ride. I didn't
feel bad when he died. I was just surprised because I always
thought Allen Ginsberg would live to be 100 years old. He
seemed like the kind of man who would never die. De Kooning
almost made it to 100.
but to go back to those years, I think what was interesting
about the artists of the 50s was that they really had no vision of
the possibility of success. You never dreamed you'd ever make a
living doing what you did.
And I think that was probably very healthy because you
didn't think in terms of success. It was a lot of fun — nobody
had a pennv ... but we all made it. We weren't thinking of
money at all; I suppose we were basically crazy.
We were doing this for God knows what reasons, we were
naive and hopeful, as (Robert) ('reeley put it when he was here
a few years ago. When somebody in the audience asked Greeley
about those wars, he said something to the effect that what he
remembers about those years was that everybody was so ab
solutely serious.
It wasn't like, "let's do this because it'll be fun." It was like,
"We really have to do this." We were really writing for our
lives. U

When Sorrentino retires, he probably
won t end up living around here.
Writer and English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino talks
about stale paradigms, a loathsome town called
Palo Alto, the Beat poets and New York in the 1950s

PROFESSORS AT UNIVERSITIES like Stanford who
don't have doctorates are mysterious.... How did they
get their jobs? Well, behind all that mystery often lies hid
den talent we may or may not see in the classroom.
In the case of Gilbert Sorrentino, an English professor for the
last 15 years, his resume is packed with lots and lots of words —
13 novels, 10 books of poetry, two translations and one book of
essays, to he exact. He also received the John Dos Passos Prize
lor literature, two Guggenheim Fellowships and an award for
literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. That's probably how he got the job.
Intermission unearthed his thoughts on high art, low art and
everything in between.
Intermission: What's the difference between what you're inter
ested in writingand what you havecalled "communicative"fiction?
Gilbert Sorrentino: Well, I'm not interested in that kind ot
fiction. It seems to me that the business of a writer is to make
something, and that's very different from using language to
lonvey ideas. I like the idea of making a poem or a novel that ex
ists in the world as a thing.
Now if you think of language as the medium by which that
kind of work can be produced, language becomes less transpar
ent. It becomes opaque and resists being used as a communica
tive device. It doesn't mean your language is gobbledygook or
impenetrable — it means that language calls attention to itself
as something made. And I think all good work, certainly all
good modernist work, operates like that.
I: You often quote texts from different time periods to support
i onr aesthetic. Is modernism something that became a movement
retrospectively, or was there a consciousness there?
(IS: I think modernism is indeed a movement. And 1 think
the basic impetus of modernism was the sense that there was no
longer the possibility for a communal art, for an art that spoke
to the people generally. You'd probably need a cultural histori
an to tell you exactly why this happened, but it certainly had
something to do with the fact that literary artists no longer felt
.is if language was theirs.
Somehow language had become a handmaiden to other dis
ciplines, and I think in the middle ot the 19th century artists
began to take the language back. You had (John) Locke s idea of
the poem, and I'm being reductive here, but Locke s idea of the
poem was essentially that it's a nice thing to curl up with on a
cold winter evening.
Well, that was the way poetry was thought of, not as some
thing that was there to wake you up but something that was there
to ... put von to sleep. Modernism changed that, but I think in
the process lost what might have been a larger audience.
Hut I don't think that is art's fault. Art is simply the sort of
thing that doesn't appeal toa large audience. Asa matter of tact,
I'm of the school that — and it is a highly criticized school
art that appeals to hundreds of thousands, it not millions, of
people is suspect. I can not believe that any real art can appeal
to that many people.
I: Like loni Morrison?
GS: Well, I don't know if she appeals to hundreds ot thou
sands of people, but she certainly is.. .a very safe person. Avery
safe artist. Not in terms of subject matter, certainly, but I ve
never been very interested in subject matter because subject
matter to me is simply part ot the form of any given piece.
I don't believe that there's a way of separating subject matter
and form at all. I don't believe you can say, Loni Morrison says
really interesting things about life, love and the pursuit of hap

piness, but I don't really like the way she writes."
/: One of the critical pieces you wrote for Kulchur magazine »%•<<>
very anti-pop art. Why don't yon like it?
(IS: Yes, in an old, old piece 1 wrote for Kulchur many years
ago, when the terminology wasn't even in place at the time and
[pop art | was called the new realism. Well, I really cut inv teeth
on abstract expressionism, and perhaps it's a romantic leftover,
but I think of abstract expressionism as the great art ol the ccn
tury — at least the great American art of the century.
The problem, I think, with popart is that it didn't know what
it wanted to do. You never knew whether the impulse was adu
latory or satiric. You didn't know whether Andy Warhol really
loved the idea of these iconic figures, likei Campbell's soup cans,
Brillo boxes and so on, or whether he was poking tun at the idea
of the iconic.
The joke was on us because it became quite clear in Andy's
career that what he was presenting to you as art he was not
shielding in any way; he was presenting a replication ot some
thing that you could never find the I 'rtext lor. You began to say,
"Gee, I wonder where that original (Campbell's soup can is that
Andy copied?"
Well, there was no original (Campbell's soup can. So essen
tially what Warhol's art said was, any( Campbell's soup can at am
point in history is exactly like my( Campbell's soup can. In otliei
words, "I'm not really makingart. What I'm letting you know is
that art is very much like the replication ot these iconic images.
Well, I thought this was just .1 weary reprise ot I >ada. I here
was no possible way that anybody could he shot ked by this stuff.
I: Speaking of art movements, m (mother interview, yon said
yon didn't huy the difference between postmodernism and mod
ernism.
(IS: Well, there are two schools ot thought here. Basically,
there are those who say postmodernism is an assault on mod

ernism and an at
tempt to till 111 p
modernism's ap
plecart, but I don't
see it that simply.
I think that
postmodernism is,
in essence, an ex
tension of late
techniques of high
modernism and an
address to ques
tions that were
posed but not
quite solved by
modernism. At
least (lames
Joyce's) "Ulysses,'
from the "Calyp
so" chapter on, is a
post m odern
novel. "I innegan's
Wake" is a post
modern novel.
"Watt" by Samuel
Beckett is a post
modern novel.
These were all
books, though, that
were published in

thehevdayol high modernism. So when you think ot artists like
that, you discover that there's 110 separating line between high
modernism and early postmodernism.
Many ot the things they do are the same: collage, Iragnienta
tion, intertextnality, intratextuality, etc. My leeling about this is
that there's a mindset which is postmodernism and a mind set
which is not. That doesn't mean that there's a dichotom) be
tween the works themselves.
Postmodernism also takes into account the idea ot popular
culture, popular art, popular this and popular that, as it mod
ernism didn't, but modernism did. Perhaps it didn t canonize
these things, which I think is perhaps something that shouldn't
be done anyway.
I mean, there's nothing the matter with popular ail or pop
ular culture, but you can't contuse it with other things, like a
play by Samuel Beckett. In other words, there may be a really in
teresting television show 011 which you say is lots ot tun to
watch, but its not like ( Beekett's) "I ndganie."
I: So yon wonltl preserve the ilistim tion between low and high
art?
(iS: ()h, absolutely. By the same token, I have 110 beet against
popular art or low art. I think it's perlectly terrific slut I. Ihe only
problem is that you c an t blur the ditferences.
I or example, people take umbrage it you sa\, "You know, I

high art or is it something else'<
(iS: My work has been criticized as not being passionate
enough because it's worked out and posited in certain ways.
Well, I think that's done with TV commercials as well. They're
really worked out and of course they have an agenda, which is
to disappear after they're done.
That's what's interesting about art, though. Art is interesting
because it has an agenda which is artistic. In other words, it's
only there lor itself.
It's a pain in the ass, basically, art is, because it's saying,

at that bar for about an hour and just muttered imprecations
against Prince Rainier under his breath.... How dare he marry
Grace!
And Allen (Ginsberg), of course, is a legendary figure. Allen
was a marvelous guy. He was sweet and charming, warm-heart
ed and generous, and the great thing about Allen was his work
was, "uneven," as they say, but I think the work of all really good
writers is basically uneven because they're not afraid of their
work.
They're not afraid to make mistakes. \ le did what he wanted
to do. I le did exactly what he wanted to do all his life long, and
he had a hell of a ride, Allen — he had a hell of a ride. I didn't
feel bad when he died. I was just surprised because I always
thought Allen Ginsberg would live to be 100 years old. He
seemed like the kind of man who would never die. De Kooning
almost made it to 100.
but to go back to those years, I think what was interesting
about the artists of the 50s was that they really had no vision of
the possibility of success. You never dreamed you'd ever make a
living doing what you did.
And I think that was probably very healthy because you
didn't think in terms of success. It was a lot of fun — nobody
had a pennv ... but we all made it. We weren't thinking of
money at all; I suppose we were basically crazy.
We were doing this for God knows what reasons, we were
naive and hopeful, as (Robert) ('reeley put it when he was here
a few years ago. When somebody in the audience asked Greeley
about those wars, he said something to the effect that what he
remembers about those years was that everybody was so ab
solutely serious.
It wasn't like, "let's do this because it'll be fun." It was like,
"We really have to do this." We were really writing for our
lives. U

When Sorrentino retires, he probably
won t end up living around here.
Writer and English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino talks
about stale paradigms, a loathsome town called
Palo Alto, the Beat poets and New York in the 1950s

PROFESSORS AT UNIVERSITIES like Stanford who
don't have doctorates are mysterious.... How did they
get their jobs? Well, behind all that mystery often lies hid
den talent we may or may not see in the classroom.
In the case of Gilbert Sorrentino, an English professor for the
last 15 years, his resume is packed with lots and lots of words —
13 novels, 10 books of poetry, two translations and one book of
essays, to he exact. He also received the John Dos Passos Prize
lor literature, two Guggenheim Fellowships and an award for
literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. That's probably how he got the job.
Intermission unearthed his thoughts on high art, low art and
everything in between.
Intermission: What's the difference between what you're inter
ested in writingand what you havecalled "communicative"fiction?
Gilbert Sorrentino: Well, I'm not interested in that kind ot
fiction. It seems to me that the business of a writer is to make
something, and that's very different from using language to
lonvey ideas. I like the idea of making a poem or a novel that ex
ists in the world as a thing.
Now if you think of language as the medium by which that
kind of work can be produced, language becomes less transpar
ent. It becomes opaque and resists being used as a communica
tive device. It doesn't mean your language is gobbledygook or
impenetrable — it means that language calls attention to itself
as something made. And I think all good work, certainly all
good modernist work, operates like that.
I: You often quote texts from different time periods to support
i onr aesthetic. Is modernism something that became a movement
retrospectively, or was there a consciousness there?
(IS: I think modernism is indeed a movement. And 1 think
the basic impetus of modernism was the sense that there was no
longer the possibility for a communal art, for an art that spoke
to the people generally. You'd probably need a cultural histori
an to tell you exactly why this happened, but it certainly had
something to do with the fact that literary artists no longer felt
.is if language was theirs.
Somehow language had become a handmaiden to other dis
ciplines, and I think in the middle ot the 19th century artists
began to take the language back. You had (John) Locke s idea of
the poem, and I'm being reductive here, but Locke s idea of the
poem was essentially that it's a nice thing to curl up with on a
cold winter evening.
Well, that was the way poetry was thought of, not as some
thing that was there to wake you up but something that was there
to ... put von to sleep. Modernism changed that, but I think in
the process lost what might have been a larger audience.
Hut I don't think that is art's fault. Art is simply the sort of
thing that doesn't appeal toa large audience. Asa matter of tact,
I'm of the school that — and it is a highly criticized school
art that appeals to hundreds of thousands, it not millions, of
people is suspect. I can not believe that any real art can appeal
to that many people.
I: Like loni Morrison?
GS: Well, I don't know if she appeals to hundreds ot thou
sands of people, but she certainly is.. .a very safe person. Avery
safe artist. Not in terms of subject matter, certainly, but I ve
never been very interested in subject matter because subject
matter to me is simply part ot the form of any given piece.
I don't believe that there's a way of separating subject matter
and form at all. I don't believe you can say, Loni Morrison says
really interesting things about life, love and the pursuit of hap

piness, but I don't really like the way she writes."
/: One of the critical pieces you wrote for Kulchur magazine »%•<<>
very anti-pop art. Why don't yon like it?
(IS: Yes, in an old, old piece 1 wrote for Kulchur many years
ago, when the terminology wasn't even in place at the time and
[pop art | was called the new realism. Well, I really cut inv teeth
on abstract expressionism, and perhaps it's a romantic leftover,
but I think of abstract expressionism as the great art ol the ccn
tury — at least the great American art of the century.
The problem, I think, with popart is that it didn't know what
it wanted to do. You never knew whether the impulse was adu
latory or satiric. You didn't know whether Andy Warhol really
loved the idea of these iconic figures, likei Campbell's soup cans,
Brillo boxes and so on, or whether he was poking tun at the idea
of the iconic.
The joke was on us because it became quite clear in Andy's
career that what he was presenting to you as art he was not
shielding in any way; he was presenting a replication ot some
thing that you could never find the I 'rtext lor. You began to say,
"Gee, I wonder where that original (Campbell's soup can is that
Andy copied?"
Well, there was no original (Campbell's soup can. So essen
tially what Warhol's art said was, any( Campbell's soup can at am
point in history is exactly like my( Campbell's soup can. In otliei
words, "I'm not really makingart. What I'm letting you know is
that art is very much like the replication ot these iconic images.
Well, I thought this was just .1 weary reprise ot I >ada. I here
was no possible way that anybody could he shot ked by this stuff.
I: Speaking of art movements, m (mother interview, yon said
yon didn't huy the difference between postmodernism and mod
ernism.
(IS: Well, there are two schools ot thought here. Basically,
there are those who say postmodernism is an assault on mod

ernism and an at
tempt to till 111 p
modernism's ap
plecart, but I don't
see it that simply.
I think that
postmodernism is,
in essence, an ex
tension of late
techniques of high
modernism and an
address to ques
tions that were
posed but not
quite solved by
modernism. At
least (lames
Joyce's) "Ulysses,'
from the "Calyp
so" chapter on, is a
post m odern
novel. "I innegan's
Wake" is a post
modern novel.
"Watt" by Samuel
Beckett is a post
modern novel.
These were all
books, though, that
were published in

thehevdayol high modernism. So when you think ot artists like
that, you discover that there's 110 separating line between high
modernism and early postmodernism.
Many ot the things they do are the same: collage, Iragnienta
tion, intertextnality, intratextuality, etc. My leeling about this is
that there's a mindset which is postmodernism and a mind set
which is not. That doesn't mean that there's a dichotom) be
tween the works themselves.
Postmodernism also takes into account the idea ot popular
culture, popular art, popular this and popular that, as it mod
ernism didn't, but modernism did. Perhaps it didn t canonize
these things, which I think is perhaps something that shouldn't
be done anyway.
I mean, there's nothing the matter with popular ail or pop
ular culture, but you can't contuse it with other things, like a
play by Samuel Beckett. In other words, there may be a really in
teresting television show 011 which you say is lots ot tun to
watch, but its not like ( Beekett's) "I ndganie."
I: So yon wonltl preserve the ilistim tion between low and high
art?
(iS: ()h, absolutely. By the same token, I have 110 beet against
popular art or low art. I think it's perlectly terrific slut I. Ihe only
problem is that you c an t blur the ditferences.
I or example, people take umbrage it you sa\, "You know, I

high art or is it something else'<
(iS: My work has been criticized as not being passionate
enough because it's worked out and posited in certain ways.
Well, I think that's done with TV commercials as well. They're
really worked out and of course they have an agenda, which is
to disappear after they're done.
That's what's interesting about art, though. Art is interesting
because it has an agenda which is artistic. In other words, it's
only there lor itself.
It's a pain in the ass, basically, art is, because it's saying,
"Look, von don't like me? < io home. You don't want to read this
book? Don't read it. This picture offends you? Don't look."
I: So when you go home, do yon rem! John (.'.heever anil watch
TV?
< iS: ()l course I do. I do all sorts of things. I watch TV. I
haven t read ( heever in .1 long time, but I think I've probably
read all of( heever. In other words, I have a place for all this stuff
111 my life. I here's a place for ( heever. there's a place for situa
tion comedy, and there's .1 place for Jackson Pollock and lean
(ienet you just can't start confusing them.
I unny thing, for many years it used to be (Hie ol the great
jokes, among inv friends anyway, that academics always pre
tended they didn't know anything about TV. I hey would say,
"TV? Well, sometimes I watch PUS, but I don't know anything
about TV."
As 11 there was something so sleazy and weird about television
that it would somehow infect their minds so that they could no
longer read the latest monograph on Milton. I here was this
weird academic snobbery that pretended that TV was so crass
that even to get near a set would somehow destroy them.
I remember years ago reading ... .1 commentary... by l ./ra
Pound, in which lie's talking about something ( onfucius ap
parently said in one ol his Analects, and he said and this is a
paraphrase "The wise man pays attention to that which

Art is simply the sort of thing thot doesn't appeal to o large audience, lis a matter of fact. I'm of the
school that — and it is a highly criticized school — art that appeals to hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of people is suspect.
—Gilbert Sorrentino

everyone is paying intention to. I le also pays attention to that
which no one is paying attention to."
In other words, we're living in a society which is drenched hv
mass media, and the most powerful of .ill those is TV. lb not
know what's going 011 there, it seems to me like you've stepped
outside of reality. I mean, where are you? I spec iallv it you think
you have something to say about reality.
I grant you, the tube is filled with the most moronic stuff the
world has ever known, but occasionally you see something ter
rifle, which ol course never lasts . . . hut that's not to say it was
never on the box.
Television can do marvelous things, it just doesn't because it's
a slave to the market. I he market will destroy everything — that's
what the market does. The market destroys art because it has no
use lor it; it won't sell products. The market has no animus against
art; they say, "1 ook, give us art il it sells, we love it."
I: In 11 reeent issue the New Yorker, aetnally, is Andy Warhol's
drawing ol ( hanel No. :> for a ( hand ad.
(IS: Sure, they don't care. Its iust that art is useless to them if
it doesn't make money, and most >rt doesn't, so that's why they
don't want it.
That's the wonderful thing about being an artist. An artist
doesn't have to please anybody. I le can sax all the wrong things.
I lecan bother people. I ledoesii i have to worn about a market.
I le doesn't have to worry about a thing. I le's a tree spirit.
I le's not going lo make am money being a tree spirit, prob
ably, but the point is he's not beholden loanvbodv, which is \cry
bothersome to people. It's especialh bothersome, I think, with
art, because people understand that art doesn't have to please a
market, but the\ don't quite understand that art doesn't have to
please anvbodv.
I: I low are the painters voii like best related to the writers von

like best?
CiS: Well, I'm talking about my generation only, and in the 's()s
in the (aty of New York, there was a very restless sense among
artists of all kinds that all of the paradigms that they had been pre
sented were worn out and stale. Everybody began to try to do
something different So I think the spirit of creation in that time
was that all artists had a sense that something new had to be done.
It was easier for a poet whose models were French surrealists
and French post-surrealists or the Black Mountain school, which
had gone back to the teachings of Pound and Williams — it was
easier for writers working 111 that vein to have a rapport with ab
stract painters than it was for poets and writers in that vein to have
.1 rapport with, if you will, academic poets and writers.
A poet would be closer to a painter who thought the same
way about deforming the idiogram than he would with a poet
whose work was anathema to him. The poets of the s()s, the
New York school, Black Mountain, the San Francisco renais
sance— the Beat poets, of course — I think everybody began to
think of those arts as more involved with process.
It was the process of doing it which most interested them.
And I think that s probably what was going on more than any
uniformity o! technique. Of course, I realize that's a sentimen
tal, perhaps romantic vision, but it's those artists to whom I feel
allegiance, and that's because that's my generation and I was a
young man when all this was going on.
I: Would vvii be culled u Bent poet?
(iS: When I was a young man, I was often grouped with Beat
poets, but I really wasn't a Beat poet. Of course, nobody knew
how to talk about anything in those days.
So if you were a poet who wasn t writing in what was though I
ofas the way one should write poetrv, then you were a Be ♦! poet,
no matter what you were doing. But there were very great dif
ferences among the poets — there was the New York School,
which was very different from the Beats, very different from the
Black Mountain School. . . but what was going on with all these
people is that they had the same basic attitude toward language,

the same basic attitude with their desire to knock over the ap
plecart.
There was a kind oficonoclasm about this poetry, which en
raged people because it was the '50s— people were really angry
at this stuff. And of course, its interesting, most of those poets
are in the Norton Anthology now.
The'soswerea wonderful time in a way. It was a terrible time
politically, socially and culturally. And yet, artistically it was a
time of enormous invention and freedom, probably because of
that — you had to get rid of this junk that was going on all
around you. It was a weird time to be alive.
And the Beats were this great breath of fresh air. It's very hard
to tell young people what that meant. I mean, when you first
heard or read Allen ((iinsberg)'s "I have seen the best minds ot
my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical,
naked" — everybody who read that said, "Right!"
It was like a call to arms. It was all happening at the same
time, and it was happening in New York. New York was a tan
tastic place in the 30s, truly remarkable.
/. How does tluii compare with Sou I'rancisco?
(iS: The problem with San Francisco — and I know this is
not defensible, and I don't expect to defend it, and I don't ex
pect to have any rational way ot dealing with this either be
cause it's irrational, I grant you that — San Francisco is
much too charming and pretty tor anything real to come out
ol it. Period. There's not enough grit. There's not enough
greed. There's not enough unpleasantness for art to he made.
/: Ami vou're living in Palo Alto how is that?
iiS: There are no words for Palo Alto in my vocabulary. I
have been in main places, like the old song goes I've been
in some big tow lis and heard me some big talk — but I have
never in mv entire life known of anv itv like Palo Alto. It is

smug,
provincial,
narrow
minded,
philis t i n e,
bigoted.. . .
It has no re
deem i n g
qualities. It is
a loathsome
town.
Here's a
classic story
about Palo
Alto. There
used to be two
galleries in
Palo Alto:
I.ucv Herman
Gallery and
Smith Ander
son Gallery.
They were
both extraor

dinarilv good galleries. Thev showed very good painters with
reputations, and they showed excellent painters who were he
ginning to get reputations — painters who had galleries in LA.
and New York
All their work was excellent; they showed really good stutl.
Smith Anderson and l.ucv Herman went out of business in the
same year — three or four years ago — and the reason they went
out of business was that they could not sell anybody in Palo Alto
any pictures. And yet these are people who think nothing of
spending $90,000 on an automobile.
I: Yon knew both Willem de Kooning anil Allen (iinsberg, right,
who both just recently died?
C IS: Yes, of course. I )e Kooning was a funny guv, and he said
marvelous things, and many times they were funny because of
his accent. But I didn't know him terribly well; he was older than
I — by the time I got to know him he was surrounded by ador
ing fans.
I suppose one of the funniest stories about De Kooning is
when he heard that Grace Kelly had gotten married to Prince
Rainier of Monaco. He had a crush on Grace; so when he was
sitting at the bar one day and heard that she got married, he sat
at that bar for about an hour and just muttered imprecations
against Prince Rainier under his breath.... How dare he marry
Grace!
And Allen (Ginsberg), of course, is a legendary figure. Allen
was a marvelous guy. He was sweet and charming, warm-heart
ed and generous, and the great thing about Allen was his work
was, "uneven," as they say, but I think the work of all really good
writers is basically uneven because they're not afraid of their
work.
They're not afraid to make mistakes. \ le did what he wanted
to do. I le did exactly what he wanted to do all his life long, and
he had a hell of a ride, Allen — he had a hell of a ride. I didn't
feel bad when he died. I was just surprised because I always
thought Allen Ginsberg would live to be 100 years old. He
seemed like the kind of man who would never die. De Kooning
almost made it to 100.
but to go back to those years, I think what was interesting
about the artists of the 50s was that they really had no vision of
the possibility of success. You never dreamed you'd ever make a
living doing what you did.
And I think that was probably very healthy because you
didn't think in terms of success. It was a lot of fun — nobody

solutely serious.
It wasn't like, "let's do this because it'll be fun." It was like,
"We really have to do this." We were really writing for our
lives. U
