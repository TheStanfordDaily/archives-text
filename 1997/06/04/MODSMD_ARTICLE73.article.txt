This is dessert: Slice oranees into wheels.
Find a gleaming glass bowl and alternate
the orange wheels with slices of sugared
ginger. Squeeze the juice of five limes on
top, and let it marinate through the morn

This is Italo Calvino: In Ersilia, to estab
lish the relationships that sustain the city's
life, the inhabitants stretch strings from tne
corners of the houses, white or black or gray
or black-and-white according to whether
they mark a relationship of blood, trade,
authority, agency. When the strings become
so numerous that you can no longer pass
among them, the inhabitants leave: The
houses are dismantled; only the strings and
their supports remain. '
This is Roman nonsense: For Ceres' feast
day, foxes with their tails on fire were set

loose in the Circus Maximus; nobody
knows why. 2
This is Saturday afternoon: Cut a white
pillowcase into tnree-inch squares. Dye
each square in a different foodstuff: mar

This is 1893 science fiction: In Henry
Olerich's "A Cityless and Countryless
World," the standard for money was time:
"In business, when you say 1 want so many
dollars, cents and mills for an article, we

This is Rosmarie Waldrop: The propor
tion of accident in my picture of the world
falls with the rain. Sometimes, at night, di

luted air. You told me that the poorer hous
es down by the river still mark the level of
the flood, but the world divides into facts
like surprised wanderers disheveled by a
sudden wind. When you stopped preparing
quotes from the ancient misogynists it was
clear that you would soon forget my
street. 4
This is Basil Bunting:
1 am agog for foam. Tumultuous come
With teeming sweetness to the bitter
shore
Tidelong unrinsed and midday parched
and numb
With expectation.... 5
This is Asian torture: Bamboo can grow
three feet in 24 hours, an accomplishment
that is capitalized upon, legendarily, in that
exquisite Asian torture in which a victim is

strapped to a mesh bunk a mere foot above
a bed of healthy bamboo plants whose
woodlike tips have been sharpened, lor the
first eight hours he is fine, i! jittery; then he
starts turning into a colander, by degrees. h
This is pepper toast: Cut thick slices of
rye or sourdough. Butter thickly and broil
for four minutes. Top with fresh-ground
pepper.
