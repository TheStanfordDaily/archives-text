Clinton's lawyer lashes out at Starr
WASHINGTON (AP) — Lashing out for the first
time, the first family's lawyer accused Whitewater
prosecutors yesterday of inflicting "leak-and-smear"
damage on Hillary Rodham Clinton and of violating
grand jury secrecy rules.
In a letter sanctioned by President Clinton, David
Kendall accused prosecutor Kenneth Starr of engag
ing in "a public relations offensive" that "is wholly
inconsistent with your professional obligations as a
prosecutor."
Kendall's attack was prompted by a New York
Times Magazine story on Sunday that quoted
unnamed prosecutors from Starr's office.
It contained "plain violations of grand jury
secrecy" rules imposed on prosecutors, Kendall
wrote.

Pope brings 7 presidents together
GNIEZNO, Poland (AP) — In an extraordinary
gathering, Pope John Paul II brought seven Euro
pean presidents together yesterday, telling them
that a united continent can neither ignore its Chris
tian roots nor be a club exclusively for the rich.
That such a large group of leaders accepted the
invitation and Hew to Poland for the audience was a
tribute to John Paul, who has used his nearly 19-
year-old papacy to outline a moral path for Europe.
The seven leaders attended a three-hour Mass.
The presidents came from Poland, Germany, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and
Ukraine. While only Germany is a member of the
European Union and NATO, most of the others —
all emerging from 50 years of communism — < r \re on
waiting lists for admittance
