## Matsch wants emotion out of McVeigh sentencing 
### 
DENVER (AP) — Determined to keep Timothy
McVeigh's sentencing hearing from becoming "some
kind of lynching," the judge yesterday barred prose
cutors from presenting victims' wedding photos, a
poem by a victim's father and testimony on funeral
arrangements.
U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch also said he
won't allow McVeigh's lawyers to turn the hearing
into a trial of the government's handling of the siege
at Waco. The hearing on whether McVeigh should
get the death penalty for the Oklahoma City bomb
ing begins today.
In addition, Matsch prohibited testimony from
any bombing survivors and victims' relatives who
were prejudiced by testimony from the trial. These
witnesses will be questioned before they may testify
in front of the jurors who will decide if McVeigh
should live or die.

"We have to guard this hearing to ensure that the
ultimate result and the jury's decision are truly a
moral response to appropriate information rather
than an emotional response," he said.
The jurors who convicted McVeigh of murder and
conspiracy on Monday will decide whether he should
die by injection for the April 19, 1995, bombing that
killed 168 people.
McVeigh appeared relaxed as he walked into the
courtroom one day after the jury found him guilty in
the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil. He smiled
often and laughed as he whispered to attorney
Robert Nigh.
Despite Matsch's rulings, the judge will allow
plenty of potentially wrenching testimony, including
that of a 10-year-old boy whose mother died and a
rescuer who held a hand buried in t he rubble, only to
feel the pulse stop.
