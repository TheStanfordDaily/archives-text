our cot/on-mouthed friends, hero's a time killer while
our much anticipated lager makes its way into veur hands.
It should be worth the wait. Hailing from the world's

Lager is aromatic and quaffable, with subtle malt /7avors
and a light hoppv finish. It's aged a full month-about
the time it should take to finish this puzzle.
