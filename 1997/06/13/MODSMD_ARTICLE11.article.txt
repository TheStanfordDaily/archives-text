## Reservations vanish in smoke of Stanford 
### 
SO 1 HIS IS it my last piece ever
as a Stanford writer. By the time
this hits the press, I'll be packing
up the last (ew things in my room, dust
ing out the crap under my bed and
preparing to step out the residence door
for the last time.
Within a few days, my college experi
ence will be reduced to nothing but
memories, plus a few photos, lots of
underused textbooks and reams of old
papers I'll probably never read again.
In case you can't tell, I'm starting to
feel a little nostalgic — and I hate it.
I used to think I hated Stanford, too.
For most of my time here, I thought t he
Farm was too bland, too ordinary, too
safe for someone as sophisticated as I
thought I was. My fellow students
seemed like guppies in a fishbowl: exult
ing as they conquered this safe, hermet
ically sealed little kingdom, without a
thought for the bigger, scarier world
outside.
I was better than this, I thought — I
was better than them. My freshman
roommates endeavored to "find them
selves" via dorm ski trips and "Crossing
the Line," but I just shook my head,
smiled what I hoped was a cynical.

worldwise smile and dreamed of the day
when I could get out.
Well, I guess that day is here. And
somehow I'm not as eager to leave as I
used to be.
Before the chorus of "I told you so"
begins, though, I'd like to say that I
haven't changed my mind fundamental
ly about Stanford. I still think that this
campus fosters isolation — not just
from the world beyond the Oval but
from disciplines and schools of thought
that might not match up to the "Stan
ford experience."
In part, this is because Stanford is
just too dang huge: There's something
weird about a school so large that many
students drive to class, so big that you
can spend four years here and never
even sec large areas of campus.
But it's not just that — it still seems
to me that, inadvertently or deliberate
ly, this place fosters a certain country
club proclivity for navel-gazing that
slowly rubs off on those of us who spend
our years here.
At first, I thought this indoctrination
was complete, that I was surrounded by
a uniform mass of uncommunicative,
self-obsessed overachievers content to

study five nights a week, go to Flicks,
get their diplomas and leave. Hut over
the years that first impression has
faded.
In large part this perceptive shift
meant overturning my own biases: As
I've slowly unraveled my prejudices and
allowed myself to see people for them
selves, developed the patience to dig
beneath the academics and the competi
tion and the pressure, I've been able to
really get to know a lot of good people
for who they are.
As one of my friends says, people at
Stanford surprise you — they think
about things more than they talk about
them or reflect them in their outward
appearance or behavior.
For better or worse, Stanford isn't
Berkeley or Reed College or Brown:
People here don't usually go out on a
limb to express themselves and their
differences to the world. But our uni
form of Stanford sweats and Tevas and
khakis is really a kind of camouflage,
concealing unique, creative people of
whom I've grown to be quite fond.
It's not my perfect world — I still
wish this was a place where more people
shaved their heads or protested for

their beliefs or spontaneously burst into
song on their way to class — but it's a
world that I've come to appreciate. And
it's a world I'm going to miss.
Earlier, I mentioned my cynical dis
dain for my frosh-year dormmates and
their unbridled enthusiasm for the "per
sonal growth" the Stanford experience
was supposedly slathering on them.
More than anything else I've said or
done during my years here, I'd like to
take that cynicism back. Because some
where along the way, almost without
my knowing it, I grew, too.
Before coming to Stanford, I'd never
told anyone outside my family I loved
them and really meant it. I'd never
known what it was like to see the sun
rise after 30 hours of studying or how it
feels to really have your heart broken or
what it's like to dance nearly naked in
front of 201) people.
Through Stanford, I've seen fire
works at a village festival in the Peru
vian highlands, interacted one-on-one
with the people who write my text
books, seen pre-Columbian grave goods
unearthed after 1,000 years under
ground. I've met great friends I'll keep
for life.

The Stanford experience may not
have created those experiences, but it
was the stage on which they unfolded.
So this column is really an apology:
to Max, Amelia, Sandra, Dena and
everyone else back in Gavilan who tried
to break through my world-weary
veneer and overwhelm me with their
zeal for self-expansion. And I guess it's
an apology to Stanford, too — sorry 1
misjudged you.
I've still got my reservations about
things, and 1 won't miss the ASSU Sen
ate or -luice Club or the Coffee House,
but I've got memories I'll keep with me
no matter where 1 end up. Congratula
tions, Stanford: Somehow you managed
to reel me in. Despite my best efforts,
my years here have had a major and
indelible impact on my life.
Just imagine what could have hap
pened if I'd actually made to "Crossing
the Line" back in 1993.

anthropology, still hasn't derided what
he's doing during the "Vacky Valk. "
