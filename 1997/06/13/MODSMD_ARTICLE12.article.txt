## Bureaucracy: A hard (but good) lesson to learn 
### 
I HAVE TO give Stanford credit. The
University promised me a great educa
tion, and it most certainly delivered.
The lessons I learned here went far
beyond what I anticipated when I entered
Stanford four years ago.
Unfortunately, not all of the lessons 1
learned here were positive ones. One of
the greatest that I take from Leland Stan
ford Junior University is that organiza
tions and bureaucracies often can he
unfair, blatantly stupid and even cruel.
Don't get me wrong I'm not bitter or
angry at all. In a way, I am very happy that
I discovered this from experience now and
not later in life.
What my good friend Jeremy had to go
through, thanks to the Stanford bureau
cracy, is a prime example. Anybody who
knows Jeremy likes him and recognizes
right away that he is brilliant, caring and
incredibly hardworking. He entered as a
part of the Class of '97, and be looked for
ward to graduating this weekend. But
instead of getting his diploma with me and
the rest of his classmates, he is making
plans to come back after taking a forced
year off.
Jeremy was suspended by Stanford
because he made the mistake of dropping
below 12 units the minimum for a full
time student too many times. After
dropping below nine units, he was put on

probation and after dropping below 12
units twice (which he did the second time
because he got some bad advice), he was
suspended for a year — but only after
being allowed to move into student hous
ing and going to class for half a quarter
because he was not sure if his appeals
would be granted.
If he had not been suspended, Jeremy
still would have graduated in four years
with good grades, despite the low units.
But, because he broke the rules — which
he admits he did — he was suspended. It
was a victimless crime.
Because he gave so much time to The
Daily (where he was one of the best sports
managing editors the paper has seen) and
to KZSU (where he broadcast three
sports) — both of which are likely to mean
more to his future career goals than a
Stanford degree — the University put his
life on bold for a year.
The Stanford bureaucracy — cold,
uncaring rules and procedures — did this
to my friend.
Thank goodness most of us never have
had to go through that. However, many of
us have had somewhat similar dealings
with the departments in Old Union. We
have all had business in Old Union to do at
12:30 p.m. or at 4:10 p.m but found most
offices closed, only open from 9 a.m. to
noon and I to A p.m. Many of us have been

treated rudely and been given the
runaround while dealing with the admin
istration.
As another example, numerous stu
dents doing honors theses get letters on a
quarterly basis saying that the committee
on academic standing has reviewed their
records and that they were put on aca
demic probation because they did not com
plete 12 units in a quarter.
Of course, the units counting toward
the thesis work are not credited until the
thesis is done (often several quarters
later), and thus, according to a computer
spewing out form letters, these students
are below the magic number 12.
If someone with half a brain had
reviewed any of these records, much less
an entire committee, such letters would
never have been sent.
If you think this is bad, try dealing with
the administration as a reporter. Setting
up an appointment to talk with many
administrators is nearly impossible, and
the prospect of getting a quick response
when working on a breaking is laughable.
Then, even when getting to talk to some of
these sources, getting them to give a
straight answer is an exercise in futility.
That is the nature of large, quasi-busi
ness-like, quasi-political organization such
as Stanford.
In my experience as a Daily reporter

and editor, I have had the opportunity to
meet with these administrators and work
with them and their various staff mem
bers, and I can say that the vast majority
of these people are wonderful, caring,
helpful and overworked.
Something just happens when all of
these individuals are lumped together into
a big organization. People all of a sudden
get treated badly, and seemingly illogical
decisions get made by logical people, as
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak and
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta can
tell you.
All of this knowledge will help me as I
head out to live in the "real world," wher
ever that is. Like Jeremy, I will have to
deal with pointless laws and procedures,
and if I mess up, I will get in trouble. I will
experience rude treatment, illogical hours
and the runaround in many of my busi
ness dealings throughout my life.
Finally, as someone who has chosen to
work in the low-pay, high-stress world of
journalism, these dealings as a Daily
reporter will prove to be invaluable train
ing for everything I encounter on the job. I
did not intend to learn this here, but I am
glad I did.
The other lessons I have picked up here
can be repeated by nearly everyone else
graduating now.
I have met extraordinary and vastly dif

ferent people on a daily basis. I have
learned from many of them, and therefore
I can better understand them, and all peo
ple, better.
In the classroom, I've been taught by
the world's best and brightest. The Histo
ry Department's class and faculty selec
tion is wonderful, and I understand the
world better because of what I learned
from the department. The Communica
tion Department, while woefully short on
writing and reporting classes and faculty,
gave me the opportunity to work with
some of the planet's coolest and finest
journalists, such as Ellen Goodman, Dale
Maharidge, William Woo and the Knight
Fellows.
Stanford lets me out into the world
now, having learned both positive and
negative lessons. After all, learning is cer
tainly not always a pleasant experience.
The world can be an illogical, unfair place.
So can Stanford.
With this lesson and others, 1 graduate
knowing that the $120,000 was most defi
nitely worth it — whether I liked it or not.

Jimmy Haegle, a graduating senior in
communication and history, is right: Pro
jects are cool.
