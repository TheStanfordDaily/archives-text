## It's life that offers some of the hardest questions 
### 
ON A SPRING Thursday near the
end of my freshman year, my CIV
section leader and I were taking a
walk past Sweet Hall together after
class. I was one of her pets, probably
because I actually participated in section
and defended her Jane Austen interpre
tations against the vicious attacks of
some insecure blockheads. In any case,
on this particular day, she was extolling
the virtues of my student savvy.
"You're so organized!" she said. "You
can do a million things at once and do
them all well."
I nodded. I'd heard this before, as I
guessed most Stanford students had.
But then she stopped walking, her eyes
narrowed, and I could tell she was zoning
in for a close personal analysis.
"You know what's going to happen to
you?" she prophesied. "One of these
days, you're going to fall in love, and
you're not going to know what hit you."
If I hadn't been so surprised, I proba
bly would've laughed. As if, I thought. As
if I would be lucky enough to find some
one to love who loved me back. And at
Stanford, of all places. And as if that
would affect me at all — moi, Ms. Per
fect, who was voted in high school "Most
Likely to Return as a Teacher." No Romy
or Michele was I. If ever there was an

unlikely candidate for love, I thought —
even if I wanted it — it was me.
I was the perfect prey.
The story is fairly predictable — in
fact, it's probably one of those 3 plots on
which all Judith Krantz novels are
based. Halfway through my Stanford
career. I decide I'm just too damn perfect
(and boring). I ace all my classes. I wear
fashionable outfits. Everyone professes
to think I'm smart and talented, but do
they like me as a person?
I don't even know them well enough
to be able to tell. I feel like Alfred
Prufroek, who considers rolling up his
pants legs and eating a peach daring.
I decide I'll become a reporter and
take a bunch of photography classes and
go on dates and "have fun." School is no
longer important. I try to explain this to
my parents, who do not recognize my
pitiful, late-adolescent rebellion for what
it is and think I've gone completely
berserk.
Everything remains relatively nor
mal. Though I do almost none of the
reading for my classes, I continue to get
very good grades. I have one or two suc
cessful crushes.
And then the prophesy comes true.
Oh, how sweet, you say. Now she'll final
ly loosen up and grow up and everything

will fall into place.
I suppose it could have happened that
way. Unfortunately, for reasons I still
don't fully comprehend, I entered into a
very intense, very painful romantic
involvement with someone who had a
steady girlfriend.
Personal pandemonium ensued: a
legion of secrets (many still untold);
breaking up and coming together count
less times; contracting mono and think
ing I was going to die, I was so sick
(though my ex-boyfriend, screw him,
remained completely healthy — at
physically); a rash of incompletes in my
classes; fights with my parents about
how I was ruining my life.
I became irrational. 1 ignored my
friends, who, thank God, had the good
grace to ignore what an idiot I had
become. I denied my newly plentiful aca
demic shortcomings. There were scream
ing matches and crying matches and
nasty e-mail matches.
Whereas I had never had much of a
reputation before, good or bad, I now felt
universally pegged as a remorseless,
boyfriend-stealing wench. I stopped eat
ing and exercising, and I cried every day
for at least two hours. As Jewel's lyric
goes, I was half-alive, but 1 felt mostly
dead.

The relationship continued, in greater
and lesser states of involvement, for two
years. It was me making the decisions,
although sometimes I could have sworn
I'd been invaded by a volatile stranger.
Ms. Perfect had most certainly taken the
A train to hell.
With her went a host of lost opportu
nities: When Phi Beta Kappa was
announced this year, I cried. My ex
bovfriend's girlfriend got it. Neither I
nor my exboyfriend did. I failed to write
any stories for a URO grant I won
because I was too busy mooning over my
love life. I took a bare minimum of class
es my senior year, and I was still strug
gling to finish my major and undergrad
uate requirements.
Other graduating seniors, plans made
and Stanford careers neatly concluded,
are having final conversations wit h their
thesis advisers, buying plane tickets to
study on a Fulbright and taking their
last quarter off so they can relax and
look for jobs. Why don't I feel like one of
them?
Regret is a dangerous emotion — it
does little good except, perhaps, to warn
you about the future. 1 had envisioned
myself excelling at Stanford, graduating
as a stellar member of my class, awards
and honors decorating my Crane paper

resume. Instead, I became an ordinary
student with a fairly good record whose
future plans currently don't extend past
two weeks at the beach in late August.
Right now, what's important to me is
figuring out why I ended up where I am
in the first place and what I'm going to
do differently from now on.
It's easy to make fresh starts. Cut
your losses: (iraciously accept the diplo
ma with the official seal, move to a new
city and blow a heartless kiss goodbye.
What's harder is trying to understand
why you might he leaving in the first
place.
With four years of Stanford education
under my belt, explanations remain elu
sive. My experiences over the last two
years have made me realize what 1 other
wise might not have: that the 1 112
questions aren't the ones you can wrap
up in a three-hour exam or a well-docu
mented thesis.
I'll be earning my degree in those
questions, 1 think, for the rest of iny life.
