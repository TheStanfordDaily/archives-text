## The
						Senior Gift: Giving pays back at Stanford 
### 
AS A FROSH living in West Lag
during the times of free printing
in dorm clusters (if you were will
ing to use the paper with the holes to
tear off the sides), I was genuinely excit
ed by everything that represented Stan
ford. I got involved in dorm government,
study groups for History CIV and 50-
series physics and the Ram's Head Big
Game Gaieties.
To round out my Stanford experience,
a guy in my dorm invited me to work
with him on a project where student vol
unteers raise funds for Stanford. I
looked up to Scott as a senior and fellow
Missourian, and he put me in charge of
recruiting for the 1994 Student Develop
ment Telethon.
As a student heavily dependent on
financial aid, I felt this was a great way
to help "give back" to Stanford by sup
porting The Annual Fund (as The Stan
ford Fund was known in those days). The
Telethon slogan fit: "Making Good Cents
for Stanford's Future."
As a senior, I came back from a quar
ter at Oxford and was again in West Lag
(this time as an RA). The West Lag clus
ter moved and got a great HP Laserjet. I
painted sets again for Gaieties, but this
time as a member of the Ram's Head
Board of Directors. CIV study groups
somehow turned into industrial engi
neering project groups, and the workload

more than doubled.
And I still find myself loving Stanford
and with a need to somehow give back
for all of these lucky blessings.
So this year, I volunteered to work on
Senior Gift. I doubt that Sarah, Meghvi,
Giff and I had any real clue what we were
doing when we volunteered to chair this
project, and I know the committee and
Senior Class presidents had no idea what
would be expected of them. What we all
knew was that we loved our time at Stan
ford, and we wanted to spend part of our
senior year saying thank you.
This time, the effort would be to get
donations from our fellow classmates.
It's a daunting task to ask for any
amount of money from a group of stu
dents, some of whom can't make their
tuition payment, many of whom don't
have jobs after graduation and a good
number of whom have a gripe or two or
three about Stanford and its administra
tion.
For the most part, we hoped members
of the senior class would want to find out
what The Stanford Fund was, could
scrape up $19.97 and would decide it was
money happily spent.
The money from Senior Gift was
never going to be enough to build three
more Row houses or to bribe the Plan
ning Office to let us have the Big Game
Bonfire back in Lake Lag. Still, especial

ly with matching funds, the gift would be
significant. The Senior Gift goes directly
into The Stanford Fund, a pool of unre
stricted money that is collected and
spent annually.
Specifically, money collected from stu
dents, alumni and friends of the Univer
sity through The Stanford Fund goes to
undergracluate education and student
life.
A whopping 60 percent goes to under
graduate financial aid scholarships,
ensuring need-blind admissions. About
30 percent of The Stanford Fund pot is
spent on undergraduate teaching, so the
deans of the three undergraduate
schools can recruit and retain great fac
ulty. The last 10 percent goes to special
things, like ethnic community centers or
The Stanford Fund-Student Group Part
nership, which helps student organiza
tions earn money by writing thank-you
notes to alumni.
Knowing our cause (supporting next
year's Stanford students), we set out to
sell the idea to our class. The Leland
Stanford Junior (pause) University
Class of 1997 is made up of almost 1,600
men and women — each with many,
many different opinions about their time
on the Farm.
It was an incredible experience talk
ing up Senior Gift with friends and
strangers. Some hate getting letters;

some hate getting calls; some hate White
Plaza; some hate getting knocks on the
door — some love all four.
Some couldn't wait to write their
checks and get their name in the paper;
some couldn't wait to tell us exactly what
they thought of Senior (Jilt and gulp this
school. We got it all, from hugs to snubs.
We learned a similarity in the hearts
of almost every Stanford senior: We have
gotten a lot out of our time here and
want to see a great place become even
better.
For a majority of our class, that meant
they wanted to give back by giving to
Senior Gift. Additionally, some said yes
and flaked. Some want to give as alumni
when they are able hut, not right now
($lOO,OOO plus $20 is understandably
over the edge for many of us).
Add all these up, and you have a class
that really loves Stanford.
And yes, oh yes, there were refusals
on the phone, in the dorms and especial
ly in White Plaza. Everything from
tenure issues to housing issues to admin
istration issues — lots of seniors have
issues.
"I won't give until Gupta gets
tenure." "I won't give until the Universi
ty invests solely in socially responsible
companies." "I won't give until they
change (blank) or fire (blank) or start
(blank)." Even "1 won't give ever!"

Personally, I have problems with
some decisions that Stanford has made
during our four years here. But 1 know
how much 1 have benefited from Stan
ford and how that will last the rest of my
life.
As a senior and as an alum, I want to
continue to give my opinion on what
Stanford is doing. I also want to continue
giving so they have the resources to do it
right.
A record 02 percent of this year's
seniors also gave to Senior (*ift. Their
gifts totaled more than $23,000.
With the generosity of matching
gifts and bonus incentives proved by
l'eter Bing, an anonymous donor and
the Parents Advisory Board, the final
gift to Stanford will be more than
$212,000.
When 1 come back to Stanford in 50
years to watch Gaieties, there may not be
any printers in Lag. The place is sure to
change, and I'm sure to agree with some
changes and not agree with others.
But no matter what, I'll have my
checkbook ready to give another $19.97.
Make. Naughton, along with Meghvi
Maheta, Sarah Wolf and Peter Clifford
would like to thank everyone who gave.
