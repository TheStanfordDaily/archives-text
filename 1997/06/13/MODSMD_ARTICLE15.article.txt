## A 						view in the mirror: Driving off into the future 
### 
THE FENCE WAS not high enough
to stop us. Hopkins Marine Sta
tion, the Stanford campus by the
sea, awaited on the other side. We had
spent the afternoon seeing creatures
behind the glass at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium here was a chance to touch
shore.
My greatest barrier would be crawling
up in my slippery sandals then leaping
down into the bushes below. But even
before we started climbing, a woman
walked up from the other side.
"(!an you let us in?" 1 asked. "We're
Stanford students, too." The brief identi
fication was enough lor her to let us in —
no secret passwords or handshakes
required, just friendly acceptance. I was
nddened, realizing that those days were
soon to end.
We wandered down to a rocky beach
and found that we were not alone. A seal
: ulined himself only 20 feet away from
ii His slippery sheen made him beauti
ful alien on land.
We stared and then scrambled for our
cameras The seal wiggled away sedately
before being caught on film. His bead
bobbed out of the waves as he paddled in
t he cove before beading out to sea.

Higher up we climbed, to watch the
Pacific splash up against the rocks. The
wind flung back the crest of the wave.
The swells began to grow, building the
force until it would splash into a wall of
foam.
My friend wanted to take a picture, so
he started watching the ocean through
the view finder. We tried to predict the
most powerful display but invariably
came up short. Trying to capture the
effervescent plucked at its beauty and
made it artificial. The wave moved of its
own chaotic accord, beyond our desires.
Nothing on this trip to Monterey had
turned out as expected. We had a late
start and only a vague idea of bow to get
there. We argued in the car and then
made up in a smoky A&W restaurant.
The most compelling animals in the
aquarium were the most grotesque. We
linked arms but had nonsensical conver
sations. We ended the day at that beach,
when the wind whipped against us, an
activating force.
This trek was marked "To Do" by my
group of friends. It's the first and only
one marked off our list of activities to do
before graduation. The lure of such lists
is the illusion of ordering the infinite into

the discrete. That's how I comprehend
life.
Through concrete details, 1 created
hundreds of lists at Stanford, on scrap
paper, in my calendar, on my hands. It is
satisfying busy work. Only after a bout of
planning can I luxuriate in the carefree.
"Did you finish wrapping up loose
ends yet?" a friend asked. 1 nodded to my
mental checklist: paid my bill, closed my
post office box, packed up old books and
papers. That's the easy stuff. As for
everything else in my life, 1 don't think
that's possible. To live is to be uncertain.
I've been counting down this entire
year. The units of time have been steadi
ly shrinking: year, quarter, months,
weeks and now days. I repeat the
descending number of days in a mantra,
until repetition makes the pas age of
time meaningless.
At first, graduation hovered on the
horizon, at point I traveled toward at
light speed. Now the day looms in a blind
spot of my consciousness.
My friends and I mutter gloomy pro
nouncements like, "I won't see you for a
long time." I acknowledge our impending
separation on a rational level but the
emotional shock hasn't hit me.

Last week, I turned in my final "final"
paper. I rejoiced but felt a curious sense
of disconnection. Trumpets should have
sounded or flashbulbs popped to record
this into posterity. Instead, I had to keep
telling myself that my work here was
done.
That's what made writing this column
difficult. Essays require closure, emotion
packed neatly into 500 words. Writing is
a constraint put on life, like taking pic
tures of the wave. I realize that's the only
way to understand myself.
My life at Stanford here is not so much
an ending but a stopping. No closure, no
last minute insight from the narrator.
1 nstead, it ends at t he peak of movement,
and that's how it will remain in my mem
ories. Searching for a conclusion yields
no answer.
I compare this moment to other depar
tures in my life. High school graduation
- sitting in the parking lot with my
li iends, sad but wondering about the
future. In Taiwan hoping I would ever
be reunited back in the States with my
friends. Ami each year at Stanford, the
in h of pat king and the flurry of dorm
goodbyes.
In each case, 1 have been fortunate

enough to see those whom I care about
again. Somehow, we made do each time.
This is what I hope for, but I don't know
if this is realism based upon past patterns
or just an optimistic rationalization.
For the first time in a long while, my
planner is empty — I don't know what to
fill it with in the coming weeks. I am
working at a newspaper, my dream job in
journalism. But right now, I have no
expectations and hence no list.
Stanford taught me that patience pre
vails over planning. I'll figure out what to
do when I get there.
I have been imagining this goodbye for
a while. Memorial Church in my rearview
mirror: My back seat is piled high with
loads of books, clothes and other valuable
junk. The murals and red tile roof peer
through the sliver of visible space in the
rear window.
I keep driving, past the stoplight,
down University Avenue, farther until
my past disappears into the background.
