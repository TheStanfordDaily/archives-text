## Return to amateur journalism well worth it 
### 
As many of you know, I entered the
draft last spring to turn pro. I
was chosen as the 13th pick in
the National Journalism Association
( NJA) amateur draft by the U.S.
Olympic Committee in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
However, after a disappointing
spring training with USA Wrestling,
complete with poor leadership and
cauliflower ear, I sought to re-enter the
college ranks this past fall.
I petitioned the always-conscientious
NCAA rules committee for my rein
statement as a college journalist, and
upon review of my case, I was granted
amateur status yet again.
After much debate, the board con
cluded that neither my $1.30 per hour
wage nor my boss at the Olympic Com
mittee should ever be used in the same
sentence with the word "professional"
again. They also agreed that there
should be a constitutional amendment
outlawing cauliflower ear and the desig
nated hitter.
So with a new lease on life and a new
attitude about the real world, I
returned to you, my faithful fans, and
began to enjoy Stanford life once again.

In the fall, I was lucky enough to
cover the Stanford football team — an
experience which I never want to forget
(except maybe the first few games).
Permanently etched in the half of my
brain that I reserve for sports informa
tion are such great moments as Andre
Kirwan's miraculous catch against Ore
gon and Troy Walters' grab against
UCLA.
I'll never forget the thrashing the Cal
Bears took in this year's Big Game or
the look on punter Kevin Miller's face
as he triumphantly marched the Axe
into the Stanford locker room that day.
I won't soon forget Chad Hutchinson's
stellar performance in the Sun Bowl
when the Cardinal shutout Big Ten
powerhouse Michigan State.
And oddly enough, I will never forget
the way in which head coach Tyrone
Willingham coached his team back
from a 2-5 start to a Sun Bowl victory.
I won't remember him for the plays he
called, though. Rather, I will forever
remember the manner in which he
won.
In a college sports world, driven by a
collective win-at-all-costs attitude, Will
ingham stands out as a coach who does

it right. He wins and loses with class.
He cares about his athletes and realizes
there is more to life than what happens
between the lines. He is a great com
petitor and a great coach.
And, despite the fact that he spoke
fewer words to me during this season
(4) than the Cardinal had wins (7), I will
always respect and admire the way he
does his job.
In the winter, I switched beats and
had the privilege of covering the
women's swimming and diving team
and the men's basketball team — both
of which had exciting seasons.
Covering the swimming team was
great fun even though the team failed
to bring home the championship. It
was fun to watch Olympian Catherine
Fox make an impact at the NCAA
championships in her freshman year.
It was exciting to see the team fight
USC to the finish for the national title
and to win the final relay event
although they had already lost the
championship.
And it was gut-wrenching to watch
senior co-captains Michelle Jesperson
and Sarah Anderson fight off tears in
our post-meet interview. I don't care

what the scoreboard said — this team
was a group of winners that should be
proud of what it accomplished.
As should the men's basketball team,
which turned in one of the most exciting
seasons the Farm has ever seen. With a
strong NCAA tournament performance,
the Cardinal earned a spot in the co ege
basketball "elite crowd."
The season also showcased Brevin
Knight, the finest player Stanford has
ever put on the hardwood. Knight con
cluded a brilliant career with a series of
great NCAA tournament games, and
with a shot that will, in all likelihood, go
down as the greatest shot I will ever
witness in person.
I speak, of course, of the leaning
three-pointer Brevin sank against Utah
to send the game into overtime. Even
though we lost, I will remember that
game as the most intense I ever attend
ed.
My performance as a reporter was
not without controversy, though. I
seemed to have angered a few people
midway through the season, when I
wrote that head coach Mike Mont
gomery should take some responsibility
for the team's losing streak, which, at

the time stood at three games.
I want to congratulate Montgomery
for a tremendous season, and to go on
record as saying that the g une against
Wake Forest was the finest-coached
game I saw during the entire college
basketball season.
So it is with a full heart that I
announce my retirement from the game
I have loved so dearly for the last four
years. 1 did consider playing for another
season, hut I chose to leave at the top of
my game and on my own terms. (Basi
cally, I didn't want to coterm).
Please don't he sad for Todd Bern
stein. I leave the game with no regrets,
a smile on my face and a stat line that
speaks for itself. I hope you have
enjoyed my ride as much as I have.

Todd Bernstein, who is graduating with
a bachelor's in communication, is
pleased to report that, in his four years
at Stanford, he spent more time at
Maples Pavilion than he did at the
library.
