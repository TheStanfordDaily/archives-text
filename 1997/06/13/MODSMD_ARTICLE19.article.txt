Overcoming adverse weather
conditions, the lOth-ranked
Stanford sailing team dominat
ed a field of 11 to win its first
ever co-ed team racing title at
the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association / Ronstan Team
Sailing National Champi
onships.
The event, held at Portland's
Willamette Sailing Club May 29-
31, also featured top schools
such as four-time defending
champion Tufts, second-ranked
St. Mary's College of Maryland
and No. 3 Boston University.
"We faced some tough teams
head-to-head, and we won every
race we sailed," said Stanford
coach Steve Bourdow. "We
would have been happy with a
top five finish, but we did really
well."
In round-robin competition,
the Cardinal squad of juniors
John Meade, Betsy Carmichael
and Danny Zimbaldi and sopho
mores Jessica Knape, Steve
Kleha and Adrienne Stoltz
manned a trio of boats flawless
ly, cruising to an 11-0 mark, two
wins better than the runnerup
Terriers.
Weak winds and rain left the
boats ashore for much of the
weekend. Less than ideal condi
tions nearly scuttled the compe
tition completely, but a light
westerly on the second after
noon allowed for the continua
tion of the first round-robin.
"Light winds were a big prob
lem," Bourdow said. "We were
spending lots of time just wait
ing and playing Frisbee and vol
leyball."
To compensate for the loss of
sailing time, the format of the
competition was altered and
race officials decided to forgo
the second round. As a result,
every race in the round-robin
became crucial.
In the early going, the Cardi

nal came away with a key victo
ry, beating eventual runnerup
St. Mary's.
Stanford went on to finish
undefeated, and St. Mary's
dropped one other race to co
runnerup Boston University,
which started strong but was
defeated by Old Dominion
before falling to the Cardinal.
The race was"in hindsight a
critical point in the regatta,"
Bourdow said.
Typically, the top four
schools by round-robin record
advance to a second round of
racing. Although the format
change prevented the Terriers
and Seahawks from challenging,
Stanford's commanding lead
made a reshuffling of the leader
board unlikely.
"When you get into the final
four without a loss, you will
most likely hold your lead,"
Bourdow said. "You would real
ly have to screw up to lose, and
we were sailing well."
Although Stanford was
ranked only lOth going into the
event, Bourdow was optimistic
that the Card boats could hold
their own against the nation's
best.
"We didn't do so hot in some
of the recent regattas," he said.
"It certainly affected our rank
ing."
It was largely the balanced
three-boat attack that frustrat
ed opponents and left them with
few weaknesses to take advan
tage of.
"Stanford sailed a more con
sistent series and had superior
boat-handling skills," said Tufts
coach Ken Legler.
While the title was a first for
the Cardinal, if was also a last as
the squad says farewell to Bour
dow, who is stepping down from
the helm of the program after
this season.
"I've thought a lot about this
being my last year," Bourdow
said. "This was a really cool way
to go out."
