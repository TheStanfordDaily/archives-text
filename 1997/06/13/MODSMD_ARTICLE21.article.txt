# FOUR YEARS IN STANFORD SPORTS
## A
						fan recalls his time with Card athletics 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Four years ago, a sports fan
entered the best academic insti
tution that would accept him.
Since then, I've missed a lot of
classes as Stanford has garnered
17 NCAA team titles. I've been
editing here for nine of those,
and I've broadcast three Final
Fours, the Sun Bowl and this
year's College World Series.
I was in Omaha last week for
my 16th overnight road trip of
the school year, and I've spent 57
free nights in hotel rooms in the
last eight months. Maybe I
should have individually
designed a major in sports cover
age.
I can think of more than a few
images that will linger with me
long after that CIV lecture has
left my recollection — heck,
they've already made it.
But whether you're a compul
sive die-hard or just occasionally
read the sports page on your way
to the crossword, it's safe to say
Stanford athletics have probably
blessed you with some cherished
memories. Perhaps no class in
the history of any school has
been blessed like Stanford's
Class of '97.
Beginnings and firsts
Football was the Pacific 10
Conference co-champion the year
before the Class of '97 arrived. I
didn't see Stanford win in person
until Homecoming sophomore
year.
Cal took down the goalposts at
Stanford Stadium that year and
claimed the Axe for the first time
in six years. Sickening. 46-17.
I listened to KZSU's only
broadcast of women's soccer ever
— in a downpour against George
Mason in the Final Four. Greg
Collins, Class of '96, wrote a col
umn about the horrors of penalty
kicks afterward that I still
remember. Stanford missed its
first three in the rain and hasn't
returned to the Final Four since.
I got on national TV for a sec
ond trying to distract Tennessee
from making a free throw at

Maples Pavilion at my first
women's basketball game in
December 1993. I broadcast
nearly every women's basketball
game at Maples the next three
years and never saw Stanford
lose again there. Never.
My first broadcast was men's
basketball against USC my fresh
man year. It was an utterly for
gettable game, but I wondered
how Stanford could have been 7-
23 the year before and thought
the freshman point guard,
Brevin Knight, looked pretty
decent.
Basketball suffered some post
season disappointment. The
women were stopped one game
shy of' the Final Four at Maples
Pavilion in a tearful goodbye for
Christy Hedgpeth, and the men
battled back from a colossal
deficit only to lose in the final
seconds at home in the first
round of the NIT — to Gonzaga.
Men's volleyball felt snubbed
after Indiana-Purdue-Fort
Wayne out-hyphenated Stanford
to the at-large berth in the Final
Four. Stanford was ranked much
higher, had a far more brutal
nonconference schedule and was

just flat better. But the site of the
Final Four — Indiana. Politics.
Baseball survived a bench
clearing brawl in the regular-sea
son finale. I'll never forget listen
ing to KZSU as pinch hitter Ron
Meyer blasted an extra-inning
homer to beat Arizona State in
the winner-take-all game for the
conference title. The year before
Stanford suffered through its
only losing season since 1965.
Then a statue was vandalized,
dividing a campus.
Rising talents
The best play I've ever seen
Stanford make on a football field
was by Nebraska starting quar
terback Scott Frost. His sinuous
run through the Oregon defense
at Stanford Stadium was an all
timer. The Ducks threw seven
touchdown passes though,
including one in the closing min
utes that steamed KZSU's Joe
Karlgaard.
Oregon went to the Rose
Bowl. Stanford finished 3-7-1.
With the line of scrimmage
inside the 10, the ex-genius
called a fake field goal in Big
Game. Inside the 10! No. One
blown two-point conversion
later, Cal still had the Axe, 24-23.
Damn.
For the second straight year I
missed Big Game in person. This
time, it was my first road trip as
women's basketball went to the
State Farm Tip-off Classic in
Jackson, Tenn. I secured a Fash
ion Bug credit card because I for
got to pack shirts. My headset
wouldn't work. It was truly fore
shadowing in real life. Stanford
beat Purdue 62-52 to avenge the
West Regional loss the year
before.
Kate Starbird blossomed into
Stanford's leading scorer but
didn't give good interviews.
Tara VanDerveer gave good
ones that peeved Washington
head coach Chris Gobrecht, which
led to a celebrated tiff at center
court following Stanford's 55-50
slugfest win at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
They pointed fingers at each
other and talked smack all thanks
to KZSU.
I saw the practices, and yes,
Stanford did "foul the hell out of
their post players" to prepare for
Washington, just like VanDerveer
said.
Kristin Folkl carried Stanford

to victory in that game, just as
she had aided Stanford women's
volleyball's national title. She
and Tiger Woods entered Stan
ford in 1994-95 amid much fan
fare. I saw Folkl slam a dunk in
practice. We're not talking toss it
home; we're talking backboard
rattling. I dreamed of calling a
Folkl dunk in a game.
Connecticut made Stanford
look silly in the Final Four, and
Massachusetts did the same to
the men in the second round.
But Knight almost had a
quadruple double in the regular
season, and Stanford won an
NCAA tourney game for the first
time since the NCAA champi
onship game in 1942. I listened to
North Carolina-Charlotte's
demise during my final exam.
Women's basketball was in
Arizona as Stanford tried to beat
the Wildcats at Maples. Who
could forget Bart Lammersen's
chance to be the hero slip away as
his putback clanged off the rim to
force overtime? And Damon
Stoudamire's 45 points made all
those Arizona diehards at
Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson
just too happy.

The Daily
broke the story
that VanDerveer
was leaving to
coach the
Olympic team
and assistants
were resigning.
Beat writer
Emery Chen
atoned for the
$82 bill I rang up
reading the
Final Four story
to the office from
an airplane, one
of the all-time
infamous
moments in my
editing history.
Men's gym
nastics was
ranked 14th
prior to NCAAs.
Coach Sadao
Hamada said he
didn't care about
rankings. Stan
ford won the
national champi
onship.
Men's tennis
did too to tie the
record of five in a
year by a single
school. And
senior Notah
Begay 111 and
Woods had a
chance to give
men's golf the
record No. 6. But
they both missed
key putts in the
stretch. Begay
and Woods still
wrapped up two
of the greatest
years in Cardinal
golf history.

A freshman named Kyle Peter
son started the year in Stanford's
bullpen. Then he went 14-1 to
earn national freshman of the
year honors and led Stanford to
the College World Series.
I was glued to the radio as
Stanford beat Texas Tech twice to
go to Omaha, battling rain which
pushed the regional into Tuesday.
As a result, all regionals now
begin Thursday (some used to
begin Friday).
Sunken Diamond was sup
posed to turn on the lights, but
after logistical and weather diffi
culties, Stanford decided to wait
until next year.

New faces
Stanford hired a new football
coach in Tyrone Willingham.
Walsh needed to go, but who the
hell was Tyrone Willingham?
Then Stanford went 4-0-1,
ensuring its best record in three
years by early October. Somebody
named Mark Butterfield replaced
record-setting Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback. Somebody named
Marlon Evans returned a kickoff
96 yards to help stun the defend
ing Pae-10 champs in Oregon, and
I jumped up and down on my bed.
Somebody named Andre Kirwan
caught a key pass to clinch the
deal. These people seldom played
for Walsh.
The team then hit a midseason
slump, prompting Cal alumnus
and Chronicle sportswriter Glenn
Dickey to state that "Willing
ham's total lack of charisma has
rubbed off on the Stanford team."
Meanwhile, Keith Gilbertson
of Cal had wasted two potential
redshirt years for his "star" quar
terback Pat Barnes, and the Rears
were en route to a 3-8 season.
Dickey had all along believed Will
ingham was an affirmative action
choice. C'mon.

Stanford kicked three 20-some
thing-yard field goals en route to
an early 16-0 lead at USC. It killed
us. The Trojans came back, Brian
Manning couldn't quite come
down with a two-point conversion
and Keyshawn Johnson finally
arose from a game-long slumber.
The conquest was all USC's, 31-
30.
Fifteen thousand empty seats
saw Stanford reclaim the Axe as
Mike Mitchell destroyed a sievelike
Bear defense. We were snubbed for
Honolulu but went to the Liberty
Bowl, where the offense regressed
and the defense provided a glimpse
of what was to come, but Stanford
fell to something tailed East Car-

olina.
I got to go to Hawaii for the first
time and call baseball during the
Sujx'r Howl. 1 would return later in
1996 to broadcast women's basket
ball.
Women's hoops became Ameri
ca's darlings, rolling through an
undefeated season with the great
est patchwork coaching staff ever
assembled. Amy Tucker proved
she could handle a role many
thought she could not.
Marianne Stanley got her life
back.
And Stanford went undefeated
in the Pac-10, with VanDerveer
often in the stands, and returned
to the Final Four.
Starbird blossomed into a very
thoughtful interview and made
history at Maples the day of the
East-West Shrine Game. Before a
TV audience, she poured in 44
points, using a barrage of threes,
slashing layups and free throws.
If you were at Maples you'll
never forget the around-the-bas
ket move she made to tie the 16-
year-old single-game record of 42
points. It was surreal.
This was the team that danced
with the dollies in the airport and

at center court and broke into
Samoan war chants with the ever
growing, ever-enthusiastic Muli
tauaopele army in Seattle at the
West Regional.
I'll never forget the overtime
semifinal win over Alabama. 78-
76. Starbird fouled out. We
couldn't win. But Mulitauaopele,
the hometown hero, scored the
only four points of overtime,
including a leaner with 2.7 seconds
left as the Tide's Latrice Davis fell
down or was bumped, depending
on who you're rooting for. No call.
My heart skipped a beat as Ail-
American Shalonda Enis of Alaba
ma got a perfect length-of-the
floor pass to tje — and iriissecj a
six-footer off the glass at the horn.
My calls of the Final Four got
on ESPN's highlight show. Stan
ford lost to Georgia after a scintil
lating late comeback.
Men's hoops, and Brevin
Knight in particular, scared the
hell out of UMass this time. I
remember holding my breath as
Peter Sauer capped a terrific per
formance — by missing a late
three. But what a run, including a
riveting 67-66 win at Maples over
UCLA on ABC. I didn't think that
could be topped — until a year

later.
Sean Flikke was picked off sec
ond base to end baseball's season.
An 18-game winning streak came
to an end with two bitter Saturday
losses at Stanford, which turned
on the lights for the first time after
a one-year delay and consequently
hosted a regional for the first time
in six years. My heart ached for
him, and I didn't think a loss could
be more painful — until next year.
Men's swimming finally didn't
win a title. Finally. But the women
did, and men's tennis stunned
UCLA for the first time all year to
repeat as national champs.
Stanford won just two titles. In
;ts down year, the Cardinal §till
ran away with the Sears 1 Direc
tor's Cup.
The climax
But nothing could top this
year. Six titles and banner years
in the major sports marked the
best campaign in NCAA history.
The sports you never hear about
also shone in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs.
Synchronized swimming was
politicized out of a national title at
Ohio State Women's sailing was
ranked No. 1 much of the year.
