# FOUR YEARS IN STANFORD SPORTS
## A 						fan recalls his time with Card athletics 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Four years ago, a sports fan
entered the best academic insti
tution that would accept him.
Since then, I've missed a lot of
classes as Stanford has garnered
17 NCAA team titles. I've been
editing here for nine of those,
and I've broadcast three Final
Fours, the Sun Bowl and this
year's College World Series.
I was in Omaha last week for
my 16th overnight road trip of
the school year, and I've spent 57
free nights in hotel rooms in the
last eight months. Maybe I
should have individually
designed a major in sports cover
age.
I can think of more than a few
images that will linger with me
long after that CIV lecture has
left my recollection — heck,
they've already made it.
But whether you're a compul
sive die-hard or just occasionally
read the sports page on your way
to the crossword, it's safe to say
Stanford athletics have probably
blessed you with some cherished
memories. Perhaps no class in
the history of any school has
been blessed like Stanford's
Class of '97.
Beginnings and firsts
Football was the Pacific 10
Conference co-champion the year
before the Class of '97 arrived. I
didn't see Stanford win in person
until Homecoming sophomore
year.
Cal took down the goalposts at
Stanford Stadium that year and
claimed the Axe for the first time
in six years. Sickening. 46-17.
I listened to KZSU's only
broadcast of women's soccer ever
— in a downpour against George
Mason in the Final Four. Greg
Collins, Class of '96, wrote a col
umn about the horrors of penalty
kicks afterward that I still
remember. Stanford missed its
first three in the rain and hasn't
returned to the Final Four since.
I got on national TV for a sec
ond trying to distract Tennessee
from making a free throw at

Maples Pavilion at my first
women's basketball game in
December 1993. I broadcast
nearly every women's basketball
game at Maples the next three
years and never saw Stanford
lose again there. Never.
My first broadcast was men's
basketball against USC my fresh
man year. It was an utterly for
gettable game, but I wondered
how Stanford could have been 7-
23 the year before and thought
the freshman point guard,
Brevin Knight, looked pretty
decent.
Basketball suffered some post
season disappointment. The
women were stopped one game
shy of' the Final Four at Maples
Pavilion in a tearful goodbye for
Christy Hedgpeth, and the men
battled back from a colossal
deficit only to lose in the final
seconds at home in the first
round of the NIT — to Gonzaga.
Men's volleyball felt snubbed
after Indiana-Purdue-Fort
Wayne out-hyphenated Stanford
to the at-large berth in the Final
Four. Stanford was ranked much
higher, had a far more brutal
nonconference schedule and was

just flat better. But the site of the
Final Four — Indiana. Politics.
Baseball survived a bench
clearing brawl in the regular-sea
son finale. I'll never forget listen
ing to KZSU as pinch hitter Ron
Meyer blasted an extra-inning
homer to beat Arizona State in
the winner-take-all game for the
conference title. The year before
Stanford suffered through its
only losing season since 1965.
Then a statue was vandalized,
dividing a campus.
Rising talents
The best play I've ever seen
Stanford make on a football field
was by Nebraska starting quar
terback Scott Frost. His sinuous
run through the Oregon defense
at Stanford Stadium was an all
timer. The Ducks threw seven
touchdown passes though,
including one in the closing min
utes that steamed KZSU's Joe
Karlgaard.
Oregon went to the Rose
Bowl. Stanford finished 3-7-1.
With the line of scrimmage
inside the 10, the ex-genius
called a fake field goal in Big
Game. Inside the 10! No. One
blown two-point conversion
later, Cal still had the Axe, 24-23.
Damn.
For the second straight year I
missed Big Game in person. This
time, it was my first road trip as
women's basketball went to the
State Farm Tip-off Classic in
Jackson, Tenn. I secured a Fash
ion Bug credit card because I for
got to pack shirts. My headset
wouldn't work. It was truly fore
shadowing in real life. Stanford
beat Purdue 62-52 to avenge the
West Regional loss the year
before.
Kate Starbird blossomed into
Stanford's leading scorer but
didn't give good interviews.
Tara VanDerveer gave good
ones that peeved Washington
head coach Chris Gobrecht, which
led to a celebrated tiff at center
court following Stanford's 55-50
slugfest win at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
They pointed fingers at each
other and talked smack all thanks
to KZSU.
I saw the practices, and yes,
Stanford did "foul the hell out of
their post players" to prepare for
Washington, just like VanDerveer
said.
Kristin Folkl carried Stanford

to victory in that game, just as
she had aided Stanford women's
volleyball's national title. She
and Tiger Woods entered Stan
ford in 1994-95 amid much fan
fare. I saw Folkl slam a dunk in
practice. We're not talking toss it
home; we're talking backboard
rattling. I dreamed of calling a
Folkl dunk in a game.
Connecticut made Stanford
look silly in the Final Four, and
Massachusetts did the same to
the men in the second round.
But Knight almost had a
quadruple double in the regular
season, and Stanford won an
NCAA tourney game for the first
time since the NCAA champi
onship game in 1942. I listened to
North Carolina-Charlotte's
demise during my final exam.
Women's basketball was in
Arizona as Stanford tried to beat
the Wildcats at Maples. Who
could forget Bart Lammersen's
chance to be the hero slip away as
his putback clanged off the rim to
force overtime? And Damon
Stoudamire's 45 points made all
those Arizona diehards at
Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson
just too happy.

The Daily
broke the story
that VanDerveer
was leaving to
coach the
Olympic team
and assistants
were resigning.
Beat writer
Emery Chen
atoned for the
$82 bill I rang up
reading the
Final Four story
to the office from
an airplane, one
of the all-time
infamous
moments in my
editing history.
Men's gym
nastics was
ranked 14th
prior to NCAAs.
Coach Sadao
Hamada said he
didn't care about
rankings. Stan
ford won the
national champi
onship.
Men's tennis
did too to tie the
record of five in a
year by a single
school. And
senior Notah
Begay 111 and
Woods had a
chance to give
men's golf the
record No. 6. But
they both missed
key putts in the
stretch. Begay
and Woods still
wrapped up two
of the greatest
years in Cardinal
golf history.

A freshman named Kyle Peter
son started the year in Stanford's
bullpen. Then he went 14-1 to
earn national freshman of the
year honors and led Stanford to
the College World Series.
I was glued to the radio as
Stanford beat Texas Tech twice to
go to Omaha, battling rain which
pushed the regional into Tuesday.
As a result, all regionals now
begin Thursday (some used to
begin Friday).
Sunken Diamond was sup
posed to turn on the lights, but
after logistical and weather diffi
culties, Stanford decided to wait
until next year.

New faces
Stanford hired a new football
coach in Tyrone Willingham.
Walsh needed to go, but who the
hell was Tyrone Willingham?
Then Stanford went 4-0-1,
ensuring its best record in three
years by early October. Somebody
named Mark Butterfield replaced
record-setting Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback. Somebody named
Marlon Evans returned a kickoff
96 yards to help stun the defend
ing Pae-10 champs in Oregon, and
I jumped up and down on my bed.
Somebody named Andre Kirwan
caught a key pass to clinch the
deal. These people seldom played
for Walsh.
The team then hit a midseason
slump, prompting Cal alumnus
and Chronicle sportswriter Glenn
Dickey to state that "Willing
ham's total lack of charisma has
rubbed off on the Stanford team."
Meanwhile, Keith Gilbertson
of Cal had wasted two potential
redshirt years for his "star" quar
terback Pat Barnes, and the Rears
were en route to a 3-8 season.
Dickey had all along believed Will
ingham was an affirmative action
choice. C'mon.

Stanford kicked three 20-some
thing-yard field goals en route to
an early 16-0 lead at USC. It killed
us. The Trojans came back, Brian
Manning couldn't quite come
down with a two-point conversion
and Keyshawn Johnson finally
arose from a game-long slumber.
The conquest was all USC's, 31-
30.
Fifteen thousand empty seats
saw Stanford reclaim the Axe as
Mike Mitchell destroyed a sievelike
Bear defense. We were snubbed for
Honolulu but went to the Liberty
Bowl, where the offense regressed
and the defense provided a glimpse
of what was to come, but Stanford
fell to something tailed East Car-

olina.
I got to go to Hawaii for the first
time and call baseball during the
Sujx'r Howl. 1 would return later in
1996 to broadcast women's basket
ball.
Women's hoops became Ameri
ca's darlings, rolling through an
undefeated season with the great
est patchwork coaching staff ever
assembled. Amy Tucker proved
she could handle a role many
thought she could not.
Marianne Stanley got her life
back.
And Stanford went undefeated
in the Pac-10, with VanDerveer
often in the stands, and returned
to the Final Four.
Starbird blossomed into a very
thoughtful interview and made
history at Maples the day of the
East-West Shrine Game. Before a
TV audience, she poured in 44
points, using a barrage of threes,
slashing layups and free throws.
If you were at Maples you'll
never forget the around-the-bas
ket move she made to tie the 16-
year-old single-game record of 42
points. It was surreal.
This was the team that danced
with the dollies in the airport and

at center court and broke into
Samoan war chants with the ever
growing, ever-enthusiastic Muli
tauaopele army in Seattle at the
West Regional.
I'll never forget the overtime
semifinal win over Alabama. 78-
76. Starbird fouled out. We
couldn't win. But Mulitauaopele,
the hometown hero, scored the
only four points of overtime,
including a leaner with 2.7 seconds
left as the Tide's Latrice Davis fell
down or was bumped, depending
on who you're rooting for. No call.
My heart skipped a beat as Ail-
American Shalonda Enis of Alaba
ma got a perfect length-of-the
floor pass to tje — and iriissecj a
six-footer off the glass at the horn.
My calls of the Final Four got
on ESPN's highlight show. Stan
ford lost to Georgia after a scintil
lating late comeback.
Men's hoops, and Brevin
Knight in particular, scared the
hell out of UMass this time. I
remember holding my breath as
Peter Sauer capped a terrific per
formance — by missing a late
three. But what a run, including a
riveting 67-66 win at Maples over
UCLA on ABC. I didn't think that
could be topped — until a year

later.
Sean Flikke was picked off sec
ond base to end baseball's season.
An 18-game winning streak came
to an end with two bitter Saturday
losses at Stanford, which turned
on the lights for the first time after
a one-year delay and consequently
hosted a regional for the first time
in six years. My heart ached for
him, and I didn't think a loss could
be more painful — until next year.
Men's swimming finally didn't
win a title. Finally. But the women
did, and men's tennis stunned
UCLA for the first time all year to
repeat as national champs.
Stanford won just two titles. In
;ts down year, the Cardinal §till
ran away with the Sears 1 Direc
tor's Cup.
The climax
But nothing could top this
year. Six titles and banner years
in the major sports marked the
best campaign in NCAA history.
The sports you never hear about
also shone in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs.
Synchronized swimming was
politicized out of a national title at
Ohio State Women's sailing was
ranked No. 1 much of the year.

Then-senior Andy Poppink slam dunks the ball in a 1995 Cardinal
men's basketball game.
Softball became a winning team
right before our eyes. Like soft
ball, men's soccer found a new
coach and excelled.
We knew it was going to be a
special year when Stanford
claimed two national titles in one
early November day in Tucson.
Cross country — both genders —
came away with their first rings
under coach Vin Lananna. That
caught us by surprise.
Gridiron
Football looked atrocious. Tim
Carey went to Hawaii after a
fourth different quarterback beat
him out for the starting job. And
Chad Hutchinson spent a lot of
time with the chiropractor as a
reward.
But with the season on the
line, Hutchinson threw a fourth
and-12 pass somewhere toward
Oakland. And Kirwan caught it.
The most hopeless pass in recent
Stanford history went for a huge
gain and resurrected a season. In
its first overtime game ever, Stan
ford prevailed.
Fifteen-game losing streaks
are hard to come by. But the
Beavers sacked Chad Hutchinson
about 37 times in the second half
and won 26-12 in Corvallis to end
theirs. I was out on the field as
classy Beaver fans taunted Stan
ford. "You guys suck! You can't
even beat us!" they mocked.
Gross. They didn't even know
how to take down the goalposts.
With a 2-5 record heading into
the UCLA game, Stanford main
tained that it wasn't playing out
the string. I stepped on to the hal
lowed Rose Bowl turf with the
Bruins leading 20-14. Then
Hutchinson, and a much
maligned offensive line, took over.
Senior Brian Manning, who
started the year touted as one of
the best receivers in Stanford his
tory, ended it on the bench and
then won MVP of the East-West
Shrine Game to be drafted by the
Miami Dolphins (so how was your
senior year?), caught his lone pass
of the game in the left side of the
end zone, and Kevin Miller drilled
the extra point. 21-20 and 3-5.
USC came to apathetic Stan
ford Stadium for a night game.
Pete Swanson picked off Brad
Otton. Three hundred pounds
rumbled down the field and gave
Stanford a good chance to pull off
the stunner. With a 24-20 deficit,
USC set up for a Hail Mary. I set
up shop on the sidelines, near the
left corner of the end zone.
Right in front of me, the ball
landed in somebody's arms.
Nobody knew for sure. Then the
official signaled touchback, and 1
never saw Tim Smith emerge
with the ball because I was too
busy jumping up and down on Fox
Sports and running to hug Ed
Guzman. Right then, nobody
would have cared if we finished 4-
7. We beat USC.

But Tim Smith crushed a
Cougar right in front of me the
next week as Troy Walters
returned a punt 75 yards for a
score near the end of the first
half. "Thirty thousand" braved
the rain to form the smallest
crowd of the decade at Stanford
Stadium as the Cardinal set up a
Big Game for the Sun Bowl.
Stanford gave Cal the Axe from
the get-go. Kailee Wong, who had
led a defensive uprising all year
long, returned an atrocious Pat
Barnes pass for an improbable
touchdown as Stanford made
49ers coach Steve Mariucci look
silly. Cal laughed all the way to
the Aloha Bowl and made him
look even more ridiculous in a
blue-and-gold Hawaiian shirt. Cal
closed its season with a five-game
losing streak; Stanford won its
final five.
The Sun Bowl was one big
party, and we watched it from a
camera deck. Josh Madsen's
interception and lateral to Leroy
Pruitt for a touchdown started
the festivities and was a truly
great play. It was Stanford's first
shutout in 22 years.
Highs and lows
Women's volleyball barely got
on the KZSU airwaves for its
national championship match but
steamrolled Hawaii in record
breaking fashion. A year after los
ing four fine seniors, Stanford
staked its claim as the best team
ever.

The Cardinal
figured the
record of six
titles could go
down over spring
break. But Stan
ford went 0-for
spring. Women's
swimming didn't
win. Neither did
the men.
Women's hoops
fell short. They
all were in the
top three, yet we
were disappoint
ed. That's how
good they are.
Listening on
our way to the
airport for
women's basket
ball's trip to Los
Angeles, my
broadcast part
ner Ray Salloom
kept telling us
the score of the
men's game was
17-2 and other
ridiculous mar
gins. The team
and I thought he
must have been
lying, but we lis
tened on the
plane via tele
phone and
watched the L.A.

stations all whine about Stan
ford's 109-61 destruction of the
Bruins. So much for 67-66.
We were back in Wilbur's for
the end of the men's game at
Maples against Arizona. I'll never
forget Sauer's shot tickling the
twine and sparking a group of
Wildcat fans to gripe about those
damn refs that cost them the
game. Who would have thought
that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot
preparing to leave for Missoula,
Mont., for the West Regional, we
heard Knight's three-point heave
that sent Stanford to overtime
with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank
Luisetti was great in his day and
created a shot and Adam Keefe
and Todd Lichti could play ball,
but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.
Should've-been-junior Tiger
Woods ran away with the Masters
and doesn't leave home without
his millions. How was your junior
year?
Troy Clardy and I were at
Sunken Diamond preparing to
call a baseball game against Ari
zona when the perennially heart
broken men's volleyball team
blew a 2-0 lead against UCLA in
the national championship
match.
But normally stoic Chris Crad
er of KZSU lost it when Matt
Fuerbringer stuffed Paul Nihipali
to take the fifth game 15-13 and
claim a first national title for
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford tied the record in the
homeland. Taube Family Tennis
Stadium looked immaculate
despite the heat as Stanford
didn't need doubles to win the
national title — its first in six
years. And Lilia Osterloh paved
the way for a Tigerlike departure
by bulldozing through the individ
ual draw. So that's why Katie

Schlukebir, the top-ranked player
in the country, wasn't at the top
spot for Stanford.
And 1 remember checking the
Internet constantly to see if men's
tennis could break the record
against Georgia. Finally, Daily
writer Hillary Stamm beat the
Web to the punch and called with
the good news. The Cardinal had
its sixth and senior Grant Elliott
was the man to put Stanford in
the record books, with Stanford
as the only school with a realistic
chance to break the mark in the
foreseeable future.
Moments to rcmeWibc'r
1 saw Vanessa Nygaard in a
leopard-skin dress in Hawaii and
was courtside for some heartfelt
standing ovations to VanDerveer,
new Cal head coach Stanley and
Jamila Wideman after her appear
ance on Sports Illustrated's cover.
Stanford spanked Tennessee in
Knoxville for the first time. 1
drank Pepsi at the Diet Coke
Shootout.
Starbird proved she was one of
the best open-court, players in the
world. KZSU and The Daily
scooped everybody about Folkl's
return by laughable margins.
But it ended all wrong.
This was Stanford's year in
women's hoops. And while it
didn't have a happy ending, there
are lots of things I'll cherish about
my experience with the team this
year.
In Missoula, Stanford adminis
tered the worst regional final
beating ever to Georgia with
defensive tenacity. Wideman
played out of her mind and earned
her first career blocked shot
against Virginia's All-American
Tora Suber.
And the composure of Stan
ford after the Cincinnati debacle
was a sight to behold. Knowing
they blew a 1/3-point lead, know

ing the same team beat them
twice even though it supposedly
could never happen again with
Folkl (who went H-for-8) and if
Old Dominion shot poorly from
the outside (they were l-for-12)
and knowing they blew countless
opportunities to win a game they
felt they would win, Stanford
players weren't curt to the press.
They didn't shun the fans. And
we all shared their pain.

I'll never forget Widernan get
ting fouled / traveling to sidestep
Old Dominion's Clarisse
Machanguana and her three
clanging off the rim. I'll never
forget Charmin Smith draining
two free throws to send the game
into overtime. I'll never forget
Starbird dropping to her knees at
the foul line after the horn
sounded.
But my favorite memory in

four years was more pleasant.
Starbird had scored at such a fre
netic pace that she had a chance
to break the school's career scor
ing record Feb. 22 on Senior
Night. The electricity in the
crowd was phenomenal.
Proving a flair for the dramat
ic, she tied the record at the
buzzer to end the first half The
buzz grew throughout Maples
during the intermission.
Washington's Gena Pelz made
a bad pass that was stolen by
Starbird. in transition, she drib
bled through a couple of defend
ers, laid it up and in and was
fouled.
Starbird had become Stan
ford's all-time scoring leader in
signature Kate Starbird fashion,
and I had nailed the call.
She seemed stunned by it all
afterward, and after KZSU's
extended postgame the venue
had emptied. But Starbird was
still there. She signed a couple
programs for some kids and my
dad's hat. Then in the parking
lot, my folks took off and I
hugged them goodbye.
I looked around and saw one
other car. And the greatest scor
er in Stanford history stepped
inside and drove off. I followed
her out of the parking lot and
knew that.

Stoudamire's 45 points made all
those Arizona diehards at
Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson
just too happy.

The Daily
broke the story
that VanDerveer
was leaving to
coach the
Olympic team
and assistants
were resigning.
Beat writer
Emery Chen
atoned for the
$82 bill I rang up
reading the
Final Four story
to the office from
an airplane, one
of the all-time
infamous
moments in my
editing history.
Men's gym
nastics was
ranked 14th
prior to NCAAs.
Coach Sadao
Hamada said he
didn't care about
rankings. Stan
ford won the
national champi
onship.
Men's tennis
did too to tie the
record of five in a
year by a single
school. And
senior Notah
Begay 111 and
Woods had a
chance to give
men's golf the
record No. 6. But
they both missed
key putts in the
stretch. Begay
and Woods still
wrapped up two
of the greatest
years in Cardinal
golf history.

A freshman named Kyle Peter
son started the year in Stanford's
bullpen. Then he went 14-1 to
earn national freshman of the
year honors and led Stanford to
the College World Series.
I was glued to the radio as
Stanford beat Texas Tech twice to
go to Omaha, battling rain which
pushed the regional into Tuesday.
As a result, all regionals now
begin Thursday (some used to
begin Friday).
Sunken Diamond was sup
posed to turn on the lights, but
after logistical and weather diffi
culties, Stanford decided to wait
until next year.

New faces
Stanford hired a new football
coach in Tyrone Willingham.
Walsh needed to go, but who the
hell was Tyrone Willingham?
Then Stanford went 4-0-1,
ensuring its best record in three
years by early October. Somebody
named Mark Butterfield replaced
record-setting Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback. Somebody named
Marlon Evans returned a kickoff
96 yards to help stun the defend
ing Pae-10 champs in Oregon, and
I jumped up and down on my bed.
Somebody named Andre Kirwan
caught a key pass to clinch the
deal. These people seldom played
for Walsh.
The team then hit a midseason
slump, prompting Cal alumnus
and Chronicle sportswriter Glenn
Dickey to state that "Willing
ham's total lack of charisma has
rubbed off on the Stanford team."
Meanwhile, Keith Gilbertson
of Cal had wasted two potential
redshirt years for his "star" quar
terback Pat Barnes, and the Rears
were en route to a 3-8 season.
Dickey had all along believed Will
ingham was an affirmative action
choice. C'mon.

Stanford kicked three 20-some
thing-yard field goals en route to
an early 16-0 lead at USC. It killed
us. The Trojans came back, Brian
Manning couldn't quite come
down with a two-point conversion
and Keyshawn Johnson finally
arose from a game-long slumber.
The conquest was all USC's, 31-
30.
Fifteen thousand empty seats
saw Stanford reclaim the Axe as
Mike Mitchell destroyed a sievelike
Bear defense. We were snubbed for
Honolulu but went to the Liberty
Bowl, where the offense regressed
and the defense provided a glimpse
of what was to come, but Stanford
fell to something tailed East Car-

olina.
I got to go to Hawaii for the first
time and call baseball during the
Sujx'r Howl. 1 would return later in
1996 to broadcast women's basket
ball.
Women's hoops became Ameri
ca's darlings, rolling through an
undefeated season with the great
est patchwork coaching staff ever
assembled. Amy Tucker proved
she could handle a role many
thought she could not.
Marianne Stanley got her life
back.
And Stanford went undefeated
in the Pac-10, with VanDerveer
often in the stands, and returned
to the Final Four.
Starbird blossomed into a very
thoughtful interview and made
history at Maples the day of the
East-West Shrine Game. Before a
TV audience, she poured in 44
points, using a barrage of threes,
slashing layups and free throws.
If you were at Maples you'll
never forget the around-the-bas
ket move she made to tie the 16-
year-old single-game record of 42
points. It was surreal.
This was the team that danced
with the dollies in the airport and

at center court and broke into
Samoan war chants with the ever
growing, ever-enthusiastic Muli
tauaopele army in Seattle at the
West Regional.
I'll never forget the overtime
semifinal win over Alabama. 78-
76. Starbird fouled out. We
couldn't win. But Mulitauaopele,
the hometown hero, scored the
only four points of overtime,
including a leaner with 2.7 seconds
left as the Tide's Latrice Davis fell
down or was bumped, depending
on who you're rooting for. No call.
My heart skipped a beat as Ail-
American Shalonda Enis of Alaba
ma got a perfect length-of-the
floor pass to tje — and iriissecj a
six-footer off the glass at the horn.
My calls of the Final Four got
on ESPN's highlight show. Stan
ford lost to Georgia after a scintil
lating late comeback.
Men's hoops, and Brevin
Knight in particular, scared the
hell out of UMass this time. I
remember holding my breath as
Peter Sauer capped a terrific per
formance — by missing a late
three. But what a run, including a
riveting 67-66 win at Maples over
UCLA on ABC. I didn't think that
could be topped — until a year

later.
Sean Flikke was picked off sec
ond base to end baseball's season.
An 18-game winning streak came
to an end with two bitter Saturday
losses at Stanford, which turned
on the lights for the first time after
a one-year delay and consequently
hosted a regional for the first time
in six years. My heart ached for
him, and I didn't think a loss could
be more painful — until next year.
Men's swimming finally didn't
win a title. Finally. But the women
did, and men's tennis stunned
UCLA for the first time all year to
repeat as national champs.
Stanford won just two titles. In
;ts down year, the Cardinal §till
ran away with the Sears 1 Direc
tor's Cup.
The climax
But nothing could top this
year. Six titles and banner years
in the major sports marked the
best campaign in NCAA history.
The sports you never hear about
also shone in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs.
Synchronized swimming was
politicized out of a national title at
Ohio State Women's sailing was
ranked No. 1 much of the year.

Softball became a winning team
right before our eyes. Like soft
ball, men's soccer found a new
coach and excelled.
We knew it was going to be a
special year when Stanford
claimed two national titles in one
early November day in Tucson.
Cross country — both genders —
came away with their first rings
under coach Vin Lananna. That
caught us by surprise.
Gridiron
Football looked atrocious. Tim
Carey went to Hawaii after a
fourth different quarterback beat
him out for the starting job. And
Chad Hutchinson spent a lot of
time with the chiropractor as a
reward.
But with the season on the
line, Hutchinson threw a fourth
and-12 pass somewhere toward
Oakland. And Kirwan caught it.
The most hopeless pass in recent
Stanford history went for a huge
gain and resurrected a season. In
its first overtime game ever, Stan
ford prevailed.
Fifteen-game losing streaks
are hard to come by. But the
Beavers sacked Chad Hutchinson
about 37 times in the second half
and won 26-12 in Corvallis to end
theirs. I was out on the field as
classy Beaver fans taunted Stan
ford. "You guys suck! You can't
even beat us!" they mocked.
Gross. They didn't even know
how to take down the goalposts.
With a 2-5 record heading into
the UCLA game, Stanford main
tained that it wasn't playing out
the string. I stepped on to the hal
lowed Rose Bowl turf with the
Bruins leading 20-14. Then
Hutchinson, and a much
maligned offensive line, took over.
Senior Brian Manning, who
started the year touted as one of
the best receivers in Stanford his
tory, ended it on the bench and
then won MVP of the East-West
Shrine Game to be drafted by the
Miami Dolphins (so how was your
senior year?), caught his lone pass
of the game in the left side of the
end zone, and Kevin Miller drilled
the extra point. 21-20 and 3-5.
USC came to apathetic Stan
ford Stadium for a night game.
Pete Swanson picked off Brad
Otton. Three hundred pounds
rumbled down the field and gave
Stanford a good chance to pull off
the stunner. With a 24-20 deficit,
USC set up for a Hail Mary. I set
up shop on the sidelines, near the
left corner of the end zone.
Right in front of me, the ball
landed in somebody's arms.
Nobody knew for sure. Then the
official signaled touchback, and 1
never saw Tim Smith emerge
with the ball because I was too
busy jumping up and down on Fox
Sports and running to hug Ed
Guzman. Right then, nobody
would have cared if we finished 4-
7. We beat USC.

But Tim Smith crushed a
Cougar right in front of me the
next week as Troy Walters
returned a punt 75 yards for a
score near the end of the first
half. "Thirty thousand" braved
the rain to form the smallest
crowd of the decade at Stanford
Stadium as the Cardinal set up a
Big Game for the Sun Bowl.
Stanford gave Cal the Axe from
the get-go. Kailee Wong, who had
led a defensive uprising all year
long, returned an atrocious Pat
Barnes pass for an improbable
touchdown as Stanford made
49ers coach Steve Mariucci look
silly. Cal laughed all the way to
the Aloha Bowl and made him
look even more ridiculous in a
blue-and-gold Hawaiian shirt. Cal
closed its season with a five-game
losing streak; Stanford won its
final five.
The Sun Bowl was one big
party, and we watched it from a
camera deck. Josh Madsen's
interception and lateral to Leroy
Pruitt for a touchdown started
the festivities and was a truly
great play. It was Stanford's first
shutout in 22 years.
Highs and lows
Women's volleyball barely got
on the KZSU airwaves for its
national championship match but
steamrolled Hawaii in record
breaking fashion. A year after los
ing four fine seniors, Stanford
staked its claim as the best team
ever.

The Cardinal
figured the
record of six
titles could go
down over spring
break. But Stan
ford went 0-for
spring. Women's
swimming didn't
win. Neither did
the men.
Women's hoops
fell short. They
all were in the
top three, yet we
were disappoint
ed. That's how
good they are.
Listening on
our way to the
airport for
women's basket
ball's trip to Los
Angeles, my
broadcast part
ner Ray Salloom
kept telling us
the score of the
men's game was
17-2 and other
ridiculous mar
gins. The team
and I thought he
must have been
lying, but we lis
tened on the
plane via tele
phone and
watched the L.A.

stations all whine about Stan
ford's 109-61 destruction of the
Bruins. So much for 67-66.
We were back in Wilbur's for
the end of the men's game at
Maples against Arizona. I'll never
forget Sauer's shot tickling the
twine and sparking a group of
Wildcat fans to gripe about those
damn refs that cost them the
game. Who would have thought
that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot
preparing to leave for Missoula,
Mont., for the West Regional, we
heard Knight's three-point heave
that sent Stanford to overtime
with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank
Luisetti was great in his day and
created a shot and Adam Keefe
and Todd Lichti could play ball,
but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.
Should've-been-junior Tiger
Woods ran away with the Masters
and doesn't leave home without
his millions. How was your junior
year?
Troy Clardy and I were at
Sunken Diamond preparing to
call a baseball game against Ari
zona when the perennially heart
broken men's volleyball team
blew a 2-0 lead against UCLA in
the national championship
match.
But normally stoic Chris Crad
er of KZSU lost it when Matt
Fuerbringer stuffed Paul Nihipali
to take the fifth game 15-13 and
claim a first national title for
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford tied the record in the
homeland. Taube Family Tennis
Stadium looked immaculate
despite the heat as Stanford
didn't need doubles to win the
national title — its first in six
years. And Lilia Osterloh paved
the way for a Tigerlike departure
by bulldozing through the individ
ual draw. So that's why Katie

Schlukebir, the top-ranked player
in the country, wasn't at the top
spot for Stanford.
And 1 remember checking the
Internet constantly to see if men's
tennis could break the record
against Georgia. Finally, Daily
writer Hillary Stamm beat the
Web to the punch and called with
the good news. The Cardinal had
its sixth and senior Grant Elliott
was the man to put Stanford in
the record books, with Stanford
as the only school with a realistic
chance to break the mark in the
foreseeable future.
Moments to rcmeWibc'r
1 saw Vanessa Nygaard in a
leopard-skin dress in Hawaii and
was courtside for some heartfelt
standing ovations to VanDerveer,
new Cal head coach Stanley and
Jamila Wideman after her appear
ance on Sports Illustrated's cover.
Stanford spanked Tennessee in
Knoxville for the first time. 1
drank Pepsi at the Diet Coke
Shootout.
Starbird proved she was one of
the best open-court, players in the
world. KZSU and The Daily
scooped everybody about Folkl's
return by laughable margins.
But it ended all wrong.
This was Stanford's year in
women's hoops. And while it
didn't have a happy ending, there
are lots of things I'll cherish about
my experience with the team this
year.
In Missoula, Stanford adminis
tered the worst regional final
beating ever to Georgia with
defensive tenacity. Wideman
played out of her mind and earned
her first career blocked shot
against Virginia's All-American
Tora Suber.
And the composure of Stan
ford after the Cincinnati debacle
was a sight to behold. Knowing
they blew a 1/3-point lead, know

ing the same team beat them
twice even though it supposedly
could never happen again with
Folkl (who went H-for-8) and if
Old Dominion shot poorly from
the outside (they were l-for-12)
and knowing they blew countless
opportunities to win a game they
felt they would win, Stanford
players weren't curt to the press.
They didn't shun the fans. And
we all shared their pain.

I'll never forget Widernan get
ting fouled / traveling to sidestep
Old Dominion's Clarisse
Machanguana and her three
clanging off the rim. I'll never
forget Charmin Smith draining
two free throws to send the game
into overtime. I'll never forget
Starbird dropping to her knees at
the foul line after the horn
sounded.
But my favorite memory in

four years was more pleasant.
Starbird had scored at such a fre
netic pace that she had a chance
to break the school's career scor
ing record Feb. 22 on Senior
Night. The electricity in the
crowd was phenomenal.
Proving a flair for the dramat
ic, she tied the record at the
buzzer to end the first half The
buzz grew throughout Maples
during the intermission.
Washington's Gena Pelz made
a bad pass that was stolen by
Starbird. in transition, she drib
bled through a couple of defend
ers, laid it up and in and was
fouled.
Starbird had become Stan
ford's all-time scoring leader in
signature Kate Starbird fashion,
and I had nailed the call.
She seemed stunned by it all
afterward, and after KZSU's
extended postgame the venue
had emptied. But Starbird was
still there. She signed a couple
programs for some kids and my
dad's hat. Then in the parking
lot, my folks took off and I
hugged them goodbye.
I looked around and saw one
other car. And the greatest scor
er in Stanford history stepped
inside and drove off. I followed
her out of the parking lot and
knew that.

Then-head football coach Bill Walsh contemplates his plan for the
Cardinal team during the 1994-95 season. Walsh was replaced by
Tyrone Willingham for the 1995-96 season.
Four years ago, a sports fan
entered the best academic insti
tution that would accept him.
Since then, I've missed a lot of
classes as Stanford has garnered
17 NCAA team titles. I've been
editing here for nine of those,
and I've broadcast three Final
Fours, the Sun Bowl and this
year's College World Series.
I was in Omaha last week for
my 16th overnight road trip of
the school year, and I've spent 57
free nights in hotel rooms in the
last eight months. Maybe I
should have individually
designed a major in sports cover
age.
I can think of more than a few
images that will linger with me
long after that CIV lecture has
left my recollection — heck,
they've already made it.
But whether you're a compul
sive die-hard or just occasionally
read the sports page on your way
to the crossword, it's safe to say
Stanford athletics have probably
blessed you with some cherished
memories. Perhaps no class in
the history of any school has
been blessed like Stanford's
Class of '97.
Beginnings and firsts
Football was the Pacific 10
Conference co-champion the year
before the Class of '97 arrived. I
didn't see Stanford win in person
until Homecoming sophomore
year.
Cal took down the goalposts at
Stanford Stadium that year and
claimed the Axe for the first time
in six years. Sickening. 46-17.
I listened to KZSU's only
broadcast of women's soccer ever
— in a downpour against George
Mason in the Final Four. Greg
Collins, Class of '96, wrote a col
umn about the horrors of penalty
kicks afterward that I still
remember. Stanford missed its
first three in the rain and hasn't
returned to the Final Four since.
I got on national TV for a sec
ond trying to distract Tennessee
from making a free throw at

Maples Pavilion at my first
women's basketball game in
December 1993. I broadcast
nearly every women's basketball
game at Maples the next three
years and never saw Stanford
lose again there. Never.
My first broadcast was men's
basketball against USC my fresh
man year. It was an utterly for
gettable game, but I wondered
how Stanford could have been 7-
23 the year before and thought
the freshman point guard,
Brevin Knight, looked pretty
decent.
Basketball suffered some post
season disappointment. The
women were stopped one game
shy of' the Final Four at Maples
Pavilion in a tearful goodbye for
Christy Hedgpeth, and the men
battled back from a colossal
deficit only to lose in the final
seconds at home in the first
round of the NIT — to Gonzaga.
Men's volleyball felt snubbed
after Indiana-Purdue-Fort
Wayne out-hyphenated Stanford
to the at-large berth in the Final
Four. Stanford was ranked much
higher, had a far more brutal
nonconference schedule and was

just flat better. But the site of the
Final Four — Indiana. Politics.
Baseball survived a bench
clearing brawl in the regular-sea
son finale. I'll never forget listen
ing to KZSU as pinch hitter Ron
Meyer blasted an extra-inning
homer to beat Arizona State in
the winner-take-all game for the
conference title. The year before
Stanford suffered through its
only losing season since 1965.
Then a statue was vandalized,
dividing a campus.
Rising talents
The best play I've ever seen
Stanford make on a football field
was by Nebraska starting quar
terback Scott Frost. His sinuous
run through the Oregon defense
at Stanford Stadium was an all
timer. The Ducks threw seven
touchdown passes though,
including one in the closing min
utes that steamed KZSU's Joe
Karlgaard.
Oregon went to the Rose
Bowl. Stanford finished 3-7-1.
With the line of scrimmage
inside the 10, the ex-genius
called a fake field goal in Big
Game. Inside the 10! No. One
blown two-point conversion
later, Cal still had the Axe, 24-23.
Damn.
For the second straight year I
missed Big Game in person. This
time, it was my first road trip as
women's basketball went to the
State Farm Tip-off Classic in
Jackson, Tenn. I secured a Fash
ion Bug credit card because I for
got to pack shirts. My headset
wouldn't work. It was truly fore
shadowing in real life. Stanford
beat Purdue 62-52 to avenge the
West Regional loss the year
before.
Kate Starbird blossomed into
Stanford's leading scorer but
didn't give good interviews.
Tara VanDerveer gave good
ones that peeved Washington
head coach Chris Gobrecht, which
led to a celebrated tiff at center
court following Stanford's 55-50
slugfest win at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
They pointed fingers at each
other and talked smack all thanks
to KZSU.
I saw the practices, and yes,
Stanford did "foul the hell out of
their post players" to prepare for
Washington, just like VanDerveer
said.
Kristin Folkl carried Stanford

to victory in that game, just as
she had aided Stanford women's
volleyball's national title. She
and Tiger Woods entered Stan
ford in 1994-95 amid much fan
fare. I saw Folkl slam a dunk in
practice. We're not talking toss it
home; we're talking backboard
rattling. I dreamed of calling a
Folkl dunk in a game.
Connecticut made Stanford
look silly in the Final Four, and
Massachusetts did the same to
the men in the second round.
But Knight almost had a
quadruple double in the regular
season, and Stanford won an
NCAA tourney game for the first
time since the NCAA champi
onship game in 1942. I listened to
North Carolina-Charlotte's
demise during my final exam.
Women's basketball was in
Arizona as Stanford tried to beat
the Wildcats at Maples. Who
could forget Bart Lammersen's
chance to be the hero slip away as
his putback clanged off the rim to
force overtime? And Damon
Stoudamire's 45 points made all
those Arizona diehards at
Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson
just too happy.

in six years. My heart ached for
him, and I didn't think a loss could
be more painful — until next year.
Men's swimming finally didn't
win a title. Finally. But the women
did, and men's tennis stunned
UCLA for the first time all year to
repeat as national champs.
Stanford won just two titles. In
;ts down year, the Cardinal §till
ran away with the Sears 1 Direc
tor's Cup.
The climax
But nothing could top this
year. Six titles and banner years
in the major sports marked the
best campaign in NCAA history.
The sports you never hear about
also shone in 1996-97.
Fencing was third at NCAAs.
Synchronized swimming was
politicized out of a national title at
Ohio State Women's sailing was
ranked No. 1 much of the year.

Softball became a winning team
right before our eyes. Like soft
ball, men's soccer found a new
coach and excelled.
We knew it was going to be a
special year when Stanford
claimed two national titles in one
early November day in Tucson.
Cross country — both genders —
came away with their first rings
under coach Vin Lananna. That
caught us by surprise.
Gridiron
Football looked atrocious. Tim
Carey went to Hawaii after a
fourth different quarterback beat
him out for the starting job. And
Chad Hutchinson spent a lot of
time with the chiropractor as a
reward.
But with the season on the
line, Hutchinson threw a fourth
and-12 pass somewhere toward
Oakland. And Kirwan caught it.
The most hopeless pass in recent
Stanford history went for a huge
gain and resurrected a season. In
its first overtime game ever, Stan
ford prevailed.
Fifteen-game losing streaks
are hard to come by. But the
Beavers sacked Chad Hutchinson
about 37 times in the second half
and won 26-12 in Corvallis to end
theirs. I was out on the field as
classy Beaver fans taunted Stan
ford. "You guys suck! You can't
even beat us!" they mocked.
Gross. They didn't even know
how to take down the goalposts.
With a 2-5 record heading into
the UCLA game, Stanford main
tained that it wasn't playing out
the string. I stepped on to the hal
lowed Rose Bowl turf with the
Bruins leading 20-14. Then
Hutchinson, and a much
maligned offensive line, took over.
Senior Brian Manning, who
started the year touted as one of
the best receivers in Stanford his
tory, ended it on the bench and
then won MVP of the East-West
Shrine Game to be drafted by the
Miami Dolphins (so how was your
senior year?), caught his lone pass
of the game in the left side of the
end zone, and Kevin Miller drilled
the extra point. 21-20 and 3-5.
USC came to apathetic Stan
ford Stadium for a night game.
Pete Swanson picked off Brad
Otton. Three hundred pounds
rumbled down the field and gave
Stanford a good chance to pull off
the stunner. With a 24-20 deficit,
USC set up for a Hail Mary. I set
up shop on the sidelines, near the
left corner of the end zone.
Right in front of me, the ball
landed in somebody's arms.
Nobody knew for sure. Then the
official signaled touchback, and 1
never saw Tim Smith emerge
with the ball because I was too
busy jumping up and down on Fox
Sports and running to hug Ed
Guzman. Right then, nobody
would have cared if we finished 4-
7. We beat USC.

But Tim Smith crushed a
Cougar right in front of me the
next week as Troy Walters
returned a punt 75 yards for a
score near the end of the first
half. "Thirty thousand" braved
the rain to form the smallest
crowd of the decade at Stanford
Stadium as the Cardinal set up a
Big Game for the Sun Bowl.
Stanford gave Cal the Axe from
the get-go. Kailee Wong, who had
led a defensive uprising all year
long, returned an atrocious Pat
Barnes pass for an improbable
touchdown as Stanford made
49ers coach Steve Mariucci look
silly. Cal laughed all the way to
the Aloha Bowl and made him
look even more ridiculous in a
blue-and-gold Hawaiian shirt. Cal
closed its season with a five-game
losing streak; Stanford won its
final five.
The Sun Bowl was one big
party, and we watched it from a
camera deck. Josh Madsen's
interception and lateral to Leroy
Pruitt for a touchdown started
the festivities and was a truly
great play. It was Stanford's first
shutout in 22 years.
Highs and lows
Women's volleyball barely got
on the KZSU airwaves for its
national championship match but
steamrolled Hawaii in record
breaking fashion. A year after los
ing four fine seniors, Stanford
staked its claim as the best team
ever.

The Cardinal
figured the
record of six
titles could go
down over spring
break. But Stan
ford went 0-for
spring. Women's
swimming didn't
win. Neither did
the men.
Women's hoops
fell short. They
all were in the
top three, yet we
were disappoint
ed. That's how
good they are.
Listening on
our way to the
airport for
women's basket
ball's trip to Los
Angeles, my
broadcast part
ner Ray Salloom
kept telling us
the score of the
men's game was
17-2 and other
ridiculous mar
gins. The team
and I thought he
must have been
lying, but we lis
tened on the
plane via tele
phone and
watched the L.A.

stations all whine about Stan
ford's 109-61 destruction of the
Bruins. So much for 67-66.
We were back in Wilbur's for
the end of the men's game at
Maples against Arizona. I'll never
forget Sauer's shot tickling the
twine and sparking a group of
Wildcat fans to gripe about those
damn refs that cost them the
game. Who would have thought
that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot
preparing to leave for Missoula,
Mont., for the West Regional, we
heard Knight's three-point heave
that sent Stanford to overtime
with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank
Luisetti was great in his day and
created a shot and Adam Keefe
and Todd Lichti could play ball,
but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.
Should've-been-junior Tiger
Woods ran away with the Masters
and doesn't leave home without
his millions. How was your junior
year?
Troy Clardy and I were at
Sunken Diamond preparing to
call a baseball game against Ari
zona when the perennially heart
broken men's volleyball team
blew a 2-0 lead against UCLA in
the national championship
match.
But normally stoic Chris Crad
er of KZSU lost it when Matt
Fuerbringer stuffed Paul Nihipali
to take the fifth game 15-13 and
claim a first national title for
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford tied the record in the
homeland. Taube Family Tennis
Stadium looked immaculate
despite the heat as Stanford
didn't need doubles to win the
national title — its first in six
years. And Lilia Osterloh paved
the way for a Tigerlike departure
by bulldozing through the individ
ual draw. So that's why Katie

Schlukebir, the top-ranked player
in the country, wasn't at the top
spot for Stanford.
And 1 remember checking the
Internet constantly to see if men's
tennis could break the record
against Georgia. Finally, Daily
writer Hillary Stamm beat the
Web to the punch and called with
the good news. The Cardinal had
its sixth and senior Grant Elliott
was the man to put Stanford in
the record books, with Stanford
as the only school with a realistic
chance to break the mark in the
foreseeable future.
Moments to rcmeWibc'r
1 saw Vanessa Nygaard in a
leopard-skin dress in Hawaii and
was courtside for some heartfelt
standing ovations to VanDerveer,
new Cal head coach Stanley and
Jamila Wideman after her appear
ance on Sports Illustrated's cover.
Stanford spanked Tennessee in
Knoxville for the first time. 1
drank Pepsi at the Diet Coke
Shootout.
Starbird proved she was one of
the best open-court, players in the
world. KZSU and The Daily
scooped everybody about Folkl's
return by laughable margins.
But it ended all wrong.
This was Stanford's year in
women's hoops. And while it
didn't have a happy ending, there
are lots of things I'll cherish about
my experience with the team this
year.
In Missoula, Stanford adminis
tered the worst regional final
beating ever to Georgia with
defensive tenacity. Wideman
played out of her mind and earned
her first career blocked shot
against Virginia's All-American
Tora Suber.
And the composure of Stan
ford after the Cincinnati debacle
was a sight to behold. Knowing
they blew a 1/3-point lead, know

ing the same team beat them
twice even though it supposedly
could never happen again with
Folkl (who went H-for-8) and if
Old Dominion shot poorly from
the outside (they were l-for-12)
and knowing they blew countless
opportunities to win a game they
felt they would win, Stanford
players weren't curt to the press.
They didn't shun the fans. And
we all shared their pain.

I'll never forget Widernan get
ting fouled / traveling to sidestep
Old Dominion's Clarisse
Machanguana and her three
clanging off the rim. I'll never
forget Charmin Smith draining
two free throws to send the game
into overtime. I'll never forget
Starbird dropping to her knees at
the foul line after the horn
sounded.
But my favorite memory in

four years was more pleasant.
Starbird had scored at such a fre
netic pace that she had a chance
to break the school's career scor
ing record Feb. 22 on Senior
Night. The electricity in the
crowd was phenomenal.
Proving a flair for the dramat
ic, she tied the record at the
buzzer to end the first half The
buzz grew throughout Maples
during the intermission.
Washington's Gena Pelz made
a bad pass that was stolen by
Starbird. in transition, she drib
bled through a couple of defend
ers, laid it up and in and was
fouled.
Starbird had become Stan
ford's all-time scoring leader in
signature Kate Starbird fashion,
and I had nailed the call.
She seemed stunned by it all
afterward, and after KZSU's
extended postgame the venue
had emptied. But Starbird was
still there. She signed a couple
programs for some kids and my
dad's hat. Then in the parking
lot, my folks took off and I
hugged them goodbye.
I looked around and saw one
other car. And the greatest scor
er in Stanford history stepped
inside and drove off. I followed
her out of the parking lot and
knew that.

Then-head football coach Bill Walsh contemplates his plan for the
Cardinal team during the 1994-95 season. Walsh was replaced by
Tyrone Willingham for the 1995-96 season.
Four years ago, a sports fan
entered the best academic insti
tution that would accept him.
Since then, I've missed a lot of
classes as Stanford has garnered
17 NCAA team titles. I've been
editing here for nine of those,
and I've broadcast three Final
Fours, the Sun Bowl and this
year's College World Series.
I was in Omaha last week for
my 16th overnight road trip of
the school year, and I've spent 57
free nights in hotel rooms in the
last eight months. Maybe I
should have individually
designed a major in sports cover
age.
I can think of more than a few
images that will linger with me
long after that CIV lecture has
left my recollection — heck,
they've already made it.
But whether you're a compul
sive die-hard or just occasionally
read the sports page on your way
to the crossword, it's safe to say
Stanford athletics have probably
blessed you with some cherished
memories. Perhaps no class in
the history of any school has
been blessed like Stanford's
Class of '97.
Beginnings and firsts
Football was the Pacific 10
Conference co-champion the year
before the Class of '97 arrived. I
didn't see Stanford win in person
until Homecoming sophomore
year.
Cal took down the goalposts at
Stanford Stadium that year and
claimed the Axe for the first time
in six years. Sickening. 46-17.
I listened to KZSU's only
broadcast of women's soccer ever
— in a downpour against George
Mason in the Final Four. Greg
Collins, Class of '96, wrote a col
umn about the horrors of penalty
kicks afterward that I still
remember. Stanford missed its
first three in the rain and hasn't
returned to the Final Four since.
I got on national TV for a sec
ond trying to distract Tennessee
from making a free throw at

Maples Pavilion at my first
women's basketball game in
December 1993. I broadcast
nearly every women's basketball
game at Maples the next three
years and never saw Stanford
lose again there. Never.
My first broadcast was men's
basketball against USC my fresh
man year. It was an utterly for
gettable game, but I wondered
how Stanford could have been 7-
23 the year before and thought
the freshman point guard,
Brevin Knight, looked pretty
decent.
Basketball suffered some post
season disappointment. The
women were stopped one game
shy of' the Final Four at Maples
Pavilion in a tearful goodbye for
Christy Hedgpeth, and the men
battled back from a colossal
deficit only to lose in the final
seconds at home in the first
round of the NIT — to Gonzaga.
Men's volleyball felt snubbed
after Indiana-Purdue-Fort
Wayne out-hyphenated Stanford
to the at-large berth in the Final
Four. Stanford was ranked much
higher, had a far more brutal
nonconference schedule and was

just flat better. But the site of the
Final Four — Indiana. Politics.
Baseball survived a bench
clearing brawl in the regular-sea
son finale. I'll never forget listen
ing to KZSU as pinch hitter Ron
Meyer blasted an extra-inning
homer to beat Arizona State in
the winner-take-all game for the
conference title. The year before
Stanford suffered through its
only losing season since 1965.
Then a statue was vandalized,
dividing a campus.
Rising talents
The best play I've ever seen
Stanford make on a football field
was by Nebraska starting quar
terback Scott Frost. His sinuous
run through the Oregon defense
at Stanford Stadium was an all
timer. The Ducks threw seven
touchdown passes though,
including one in the closing min
utes that steamed KZSU's Joe
Karlgaard.
Oregon went to the Rose
Bowl. Stanford finished 3-7-1.
With the line of scrimmage
inside the 10, the ex-genius
called a fake field goal in Big
Game. Inside the 10! No. One
blown two-point conversion
later, Cal still had the Axe, 24-23.
Damn.
For the second straight year I
missed Big Game in person. This
time, it was my first road trip as
women's basketball went to the
State Farm Tip-off Classic in
Jackson, Tenn. I secured a Fash
ion Bug credit card because I for
got to pack shirts. My headset
wouldn't work. It was truly fore
shadowing in real life. Stanford
beat Purdue 62-52 to avenge the
West Regional loss the year
before.
Kate Starbird blossomed into
Stanford's leading scorer but
didn't give good interviews.
Tara VanDerveer gave good
ones that peeved Washington
head coach Chris Gobrecht, which
led to a celebrated tiff at center
court following Stanford's 55-50
slugfest win at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
They pointed fingers at each
other and talked smack all thanks
to KZSU.
I saw the practices, and yes,
Stanford did "foul the hell out of
their post players" to prepare for
Washington, just like VanDerveer
said.
Kristin Folkl carried Stanford

to victory in that game, just as
she had aided Stanford women's
volleyball's national title. She
and Tiger Woods entered Stan
ford in 1994-95 amid much fan
fare. I saw Folkl slam a dunk in
practice. We're not talking toss it
home; we're talking backboard
rattling. I dreamed of calling a
Folkl dunk in a game.
Connecticut made Stanford
look silly in the Final Four, and
Massachusetts did the same to
the men in the second round.
But Knight almost had a
quadruple double in the regular
season, and Stanford won an
NCAA tourney game for the first
time since the NCAA champi
onship game in 1942. I listened to
North Carolina-Charlotte's
demise during my final exam.
Women's basketball was in
Arizona as Stanford tried to beat
the Wildcats at Maples. Who
could forget Bart Lammersen's
chance to be the hero slip away as
his putback clanged off the rim to
force overtime? And Damon
Stoudamire's 45 points made all
those Arizona diehards at
Wilbur's Sports Bar in Tucson
just too happy.

The Daily
broke the story
that VanDerveer
was leaving to
coach the
Olympic team
and assistants
were resigning.
Beat writer
Emery Chen
atoned for the
$82 bill I rang up
reading the
Final Four story
to the office from
an airplane, one
of the all-time
infamous
moments in my
editing history.
Men's gym
nastics was
ranked 14th
prior to NCAAs.
Coach Sadao
Hamada said he
didn't care about
rankings. Stan
ford won the
national champi
onship.
Men's tennis
did too to tie the
record of five in a
year by a single
school. And
senior Notah
Begay 111 and
Woods had a
chance to give
men's golf the
record No. 6. But
they both missed
key putts in the
stretch. Begay
and Woods still
wrapped up two
of the greatest
years in Cardinal
golf history.

A freshman named Kyle Peter
son started the year in Stanford's
bullpen. Then he went 14-1 to
earn national freshman of the
year honors and led Stanford to
the College World Series.
I was glued to the radio as
Stanford beat Texas Tech twice to
go to Omaha, battling rain which
pushed the regional into Tuesday.
As a result, all regionals now
begin Thursday (some used to
begin Friday).
Sunken Diamond was sup
posed to turn on the lights, but
after logistical and weather diffi
culties, Stanford decided to wait
until next year.

New faces
Stanford hired a new football
coach in Tyrone Willingham.
Walsh needed to go, but who the
hell was Tyrone Willingham?
Then Stanford went 4-0-1,
ensuring its best record in three
years by early October. Somebody
named Mark Butterfield replaced
record-setting Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback. Somebody named
Marlon Evans returned a kickoff
96 yards to help stun the defend
ing Pae-10 champs in Oregon, and
I jumped up and down on my bed.
Somebody named Andre Kirwan
caught a key pass to clinch the
deal. These people seldom played
for Walsh.
The team then hit a midseason
slump, prompting Cal alumnus
and Chronicle sportswriter Glenn
Dickey to state that "Willing
ham's total lack of charisma has
rubbed off on the Stanford team."
Meanwhile, Keith Gilbertson
of Cal had wasted two potential
redshirt years for his "star" quar
terback Pat Barnes, and the Rears
were en route to a 3-8 season.
Dickey had all along believed Will
ingham was an affirmative action
choice. C'mon.

Stanford kicked three 20-some
thing-yard field goals en route to
an early 16-0 lead at USC. It killed
us. The Trojans came back, Brian
Manning couldn't quite come
down with a two-point conversion
and Keyshawn Johnson finally
arose from a game-long slumber.
The conquest was all USC's, 31-
30.
Fifteen thousand empty seats
saw Stanford reclaim the Axe as
Mike Mitchell destroyed a sievelike
Bear defense. We were snubbed for
Honolulu but went to the Liberty
Bowl, where the offense regressed
and the defense provided a glimpse
of what was to come, but Stanford
fell to something tailed East Car-

olina.
I got to go to Hawaii for the first
time and call baseball during the
Sujx'r Howl. 1 would return later in
1996 to broadcast women's basket
ball.
Women's hoops became Ameri
ca's darlings, rolling through an
undefeated season with the great
est patchwork coaching staff ever
assembled. Amy Tucker proved
she could handle a role many
thought she could not.
Marianne Stanley got her life
back.
And Stanford went undefeated
in the Pac-10, with VanDerveer
often in the stands, and returned
to the Final Four.
Starbird blossomed into a very
thoughtful interview and made
history at Maples the day of the
East-West Shrine Game. Before a
TV audience, she poured in 44
points, using a barrage of threes,
slashing layups and free throws.
If you were at Maples you'll
never forget the around-the-bas
ket move she made to tie the 16-
year-old single-game record of 42
points. It was surreal.
This was the team that danced
with the dollies in the airport and

at center court and broke into
Samoan war chants with the ever
growing, ever-enthusiastic Muli
tauaopele army in Seattle at the
West Regional.
I'll never forget the overtime
semifinal win over Alabama. 78-
76. Starbird fouled out. We
couldn't win. But Mulitauaopele,
the hometown hero, scored the
only four points of overtime,
including a leaner with 2.7 seconds
left as the Tide's Latrice Davis fell
down or was bumped, depending
on who you're rooting for. No call.
My heart skipped a beat as Ail-
American Shalonda Enis of Alaba
ma got a perfect length-of-the
floor pass to tje — and iriissecj a
six-footer off the glass at the horn.
My calls of the Final Four got
on ESPN's highlight show. Stan
ford lost to Georgia after a scintil
lating late comeback.
Men's hoops, and Brevin
Knight in particular, scared the
hell out of UMass this time. I
remember holding my breath as
Peter Sauer capped a terrific per
formance — by missing a late
three. But what a run, including a
riveting 67-66 win at Maples over
UCLA on ABC. I didn't think that
could be topped — until a year

later.
Sean Flikke was picked off sec
ond base to end baseball's season.
An 18-game winning streak came
to an end with two bitter Saturday
losses at Stanford, which turned
on the lights for the first time after
a one-year delay and consequently
hosted a regional for the first time
in six years. My heart ached for
him, and I didn't think a loss could
be more painful — until next year.
Men's swimming finally didn't
win a title. Finally. But the women
did, and men's tennis stunned
UCLA for the first time all year to
repeat as national champs.
Stanford won just two titles. In
;ts down year, the Cardinal §till
ran away with the Sears 1 Direc
tor's Cup.

But nothing could top this
year. Six titles and banner years
in the major sports marked the

ford's 109-61 destruction of the
Bruins. So much for 67-66.
We were back in Wilbur's for
the end of the men's game at
Maples against Arizona. I'll never
forget Sauer's shot tickling the
twine and sparking a group of
Wildcat fans to gripe about those
damn refs that cost them the
game. Who would have thought
that team could ever win it all?
And in the Maples parking lot
preparing to leave for Missoula,
Mont., for the West Regional, we
heard Knight's three-point heave
that sent Stanford to overtime
with Utah. Then we saw it in the
training room. Wow. Hank
Luisetti was great in his day and
created a shot and Adam Keefe
and Todd Lichti could play ball,
but Knight is the best Stanford
player ever. Hands down.

Woods ran away with the Masters

year?
Troy Clardy and I were at
Sunken Diamond preparing to
call a baseball game against Ari
zona when the perennially heart
broken men's volleyball team
blew a 2-0 lead against UCLA in
the national championship
match.
But normally stoic Chris Crad
er of KZSU lost it when Matt
Fuerbringer stuffed Paul Nihipali
to take the fifth game 15-13 and
claim a first national title for
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford tied the record in the
homeland. Taube Family Tennis
Stadium looked immaculate
despite the heat as Stanford
didn't need doubles to win the
national title — its first in six
years. And Lilia Osterloh paved
the way for a Tigerlike departure
by bulldozing through the individ
ual draw. So that's why Katie

Schlukebir, the top-ranked player
in the country, wasn't at the top
spot for Stanford.
And 1 remember checking the
Internet constantly to see if men's
tennis could break the record
against Georgia. Finally, Daily
writer Hillary Stamm beat the
Web to the punch and called with
the good news. The Cardinal had
its sixth and senior Grant Elliott
was the man to put Stanford in
the record books, with Stanford
as the only school with a realistic
chance to break the mark in the
foreseeable future.
Moments to rcmeWibc'r
1 saw Vanessa Nygaard in a
leopard-skin dress in Hawaii and
was courtside for some heartfelt
standing ovations to VanDerveer,
new Cal head coach Stanley and
Jamila Wideman after her appear
ance on Sports Illustrated's cover.
Stanford spanked Tennessee in
Knoxville for the first time. 1
drank Pepsi at the Diet Coke
Shootout.
Starbird proved she was one of
the best open-court, players in the
world. KZSU and The Daily
scooped everybody about Folkl's
return by laughable margins.
But it ended all wrong.
This was Stanford's year in
women's hoops. And while it
didn't have a happy ending, there
are lots of things I'll cherish about
my experience with the team this
year.
In Missoula, Stanford adminis
tered the worst regional final
beating ever to Georgia with
defensive tenacity. Wideman
played out of her mind and earned
her first career blocked shot
against Virginia's All-American
Tora Suber.
And the composure of Stan
ford after the Cincinnati debacle
was a sight to behold. Knowing
they blew a 1/3-point lead, know

ing the same team beat them
twice even though it supposedly
could never happen again with
Folkl (who went H-for-8) and if
Old Dominion shot poorly from
the outside (they were l-for-12)
and knowing they blew countless
opportunities to win a game they
felt they would win, Stanford
players weren't curt to the press.
They didn't shun the fans. And
we all shared their pain.

I'll never forget Widernan get
ting fouled / traveling to sidestep
Old Dominion's Clarisse
Machanguana and her three
clanging off the rim. I'll never
forget Charmin Smith draining
two free throws to send the game
into overtime. I'll never forget
Starbird dropping to her knees at
the foul line after the horn
sounded.
But my favorite memory in

four years was more pleasant.
Starbird had scored at such a fre
netic pace that she had a chance
to break the school's career scor
ing record Feb. 22 on Senior
Night. The electricity in the
crowd was phenomenal.
Proving a flair for the dramat
ic, she tied the record at the
buzzer to end the first half The
buzz grew throughout Maples
during the intermission.
Washington's Gena Pelz made
a bad pass that was stolen by
Starbird. in transition, she drib
bled through a couple of defend
ers, laid it up and in and was
fouled.
Starbird had become Stan
ford's all-time scoring leader in
signature Kate Starbird fashion,
and I had nailed the call.
She seemed stunned by it all
afterward, and after KZSU's
extended postgame the venue
had emptied. But Starbird was
still there. She signed a couple
programs for some kids and my
dad's hat. Then in the parking
lot, my folks took off and I
hugged them goodbye.
I looked around and saw one
other car. And the greatest scor
er in Stanford history stepped
inside and drove off. I followed
her out of the parking lot and
knew that.
