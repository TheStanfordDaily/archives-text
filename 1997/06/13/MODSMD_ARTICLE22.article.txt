# The
						magic of Puff
## En route to championship, senior Eileen Murfee anchors volleyball 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
When talking to Eileen Murfee
one immediately is at ease. In her
somewhat husky Kathleen Turn
er-like voice, Murfee entertains
both teammates and reporters
alike with her easygoing manner
and a witty sense of humor.
Affectionately known as Puff by
her teammates (they have to think
a second if you ask for "Eileen"),
Murfee earned her nickname
when she first arrived on the Farm
in September 1993.
Having driven across the coun
try from her home in Tampa, Fla.,
the 6-foot-2 middle blocker came
to Stanford with a 105-degree
fever and hives. She thus earned
the name "Puff" after the tissues
that she constantly had to use.
But don't get her wrong; Mur
fee is by no means a softie.
"It is definitely an achievement
to hit someone in the face" with
the ball, Murfee said
"You are just that much better
than that person. Not only did
they shank it off their arms, but
you've hit it off their face and t hen
they shanked it."
Murfee seems to epitomize the
general character of the 1996
Stanford women's volleyball team
â€” fun-loving and a little goofy on
the outside, yet with a burning
competitiveness that dwells deep
within and which has helped make
the Cardinal national champion.
"I think I am fairly competitive
about everything," Murfee said.
"Along with competitiveness
comes confidence. And that is pret
ty true about everyone on our
team."
Murfee came to the Farm as a
high school All-American out of
Berkeley Prep in Florida. Her deci
sion to attend Stanford seems a lit
tle surprising considering that the
University of Florida, a school that
also has a top-notch volleyball pro
gram, lay right around the corner.
However, the decision became
easier after the star middle blocker
paid her first trip to Palo Alto.
"It was a tough choice between
Florida and Stanford," Murfee
said. "But when I came to visit, I
had the time of my life."
Life on the Farm and Stan

ford's strong academic reputation
might have wooed Murfee, but it
was not until her first season
began that she realized precisely
what she had gotten herself into.
Although ballyhooed in her own
right, Murfee was not the most
highly touted player ever to come
to Stanford. Teammates Kristin
Folkl, a junior, and freshman
Kerri Walsh both earned national
high school player of the year hon
ors, Folkl in 1994 and Walsh in
1996.
All Murfee did was earn consen
sus All-American honors, receive a
spot in Volleyball Monthly's Fab
50 and lead Berkeley Prep to four
state championships, not to men
tion her Florida Player of the Year
award as a senior.
Despite all that, Murfee did not
find a spot in the Cardinal starting
lineup for her first two seasons;
instead, she had to come off the
bench for the first time in her vol
leyball career.
"It wasn't as tough of an
adjustment because I knew it
would happen. You kind of learn to
accept that," Murfee said. "I guess
at Stanford, if you are not player of
the year in high school, you are

like everybody else."
Murfee seems to take it all in
stride, without any trace of bitter
ness and always with a smile.
Her upbeat attitude, work ethic
and obvious talent helped Murfee
break into the starting lineup at
the start of the 1995 season, and
she took little time to show that
she belonged in the lineup.
She received honorable men
tion on the All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence team by leading the squad in
blocks and having the third-high
est hitting percentage in the con
ference (.326).
She also recorded 256 kills and
proved to be the best Cardinal hit
ter in the middle.
"I like the way she goes about
her business," said Stanford coach
Don Shaw.
"She goes out there and does
her job, and that is all that I can
ask for."
One can only imagine the kind
of numbers Murfee could have
produced if she had not been the
third or fourth offensive option.
"I don't feel jealous," Murfee
said. "It is definitely good to be on
a great team."
This season, Murfee has taken

her game to a new level and in the
process somehow has found recog
nition on the star-studded Cardi
nal roster.
Murfee hit at an amazing .361
mark, recorded more than 300
kills and totaled almost 150 block
assists while often providing
very critical boost when the Card
seemed to need it the most.
1 ler superb play throughout the
year earned her a place on the All-
Pac-10 and All-District VIII teams.
It was only fitting when the rest of
the country woke up and honored
her as a second-team All-American
as well.
"The fact that she earned that
much recognition is all the more
impressive considering the play
ers around her," Shaw said. How
ever, Murfee's value to the team
transcends the number of kills
and blocks she has contributed,
for she has also proven herself as
a leader and earned the respect
and affection of her teammates
and coaches.
"Puff is a person who speaks
her mind, and that is how she is;
she doesn't change," Folkl said. "I
think she is great, and I wouldn't
have her any other way."
