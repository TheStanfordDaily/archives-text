# Wideman's intensity carries women's hoons
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
knew she had something special
in senior Jamila Wideman from
that very first recruiting trip to
Stanford.
"Because of her eye contact,"
VanDerveer explained. "I don't
know why I did, but I just said,
This is someone I look forward
to working with.' She just looks
right at you and doesn't break
eye contact in a way that you
know she just, I don't know. It
wasn't like it was anything arti
ficial, but she was just listen
' - 99
ing.
That's the kind of sentiment
Wideman evokes from Van-
Derveer. The day following Stan
ford's 83-82 overtime loss to Old
Dominion in the national semifi
nal the coach sat quietly, finding
difficulty with the words as she
sought to explain what is so spe
cial about her four-year captain
and point guard.
You get the impression from
VanDerveer and the other play
ers that words may be too limit
ed to describe Wideman. She's
not someone you can simply tell
another person about; she's
something you have to experi
ence.
Her focused gaze is penetrat
ing, and her confident demeanor
gives her the kind of presence
that takes up an entire room
without pushing others out of it.
In fact, just the opposite is true;
they're drawn in.
"Jamila is a deep person,"
VanDerveer said. "She's some
one who understands the big pic
ture. She's someone who gen
uinely cares about people.
"She's someone people trust
and have confidence in. She
says, 'Let's go,' and they go. And
I go, too."
Perhaps it's that indescriba
bility, that quality you just can't
express with words, that makes
Wideman such a great leader.
She gives the impression of
being in a place that's just a lit
tle above the rest, but she does it
without arrogance or without
even trying. Wideman knows the

fine line between confidence and
cockiness and has the charm to
dance all the way to it without
ever crossing.
"Charisma," senior guard
Kate Starbird said of Wideman's
presence. "She has more charis
ma than 10 people put together.
That helps to make a great lead
er. She's someone you want to be
around. She makes you feel good
about yourself. She's a good per
son to talk to."
She's also a good person to lis
ten to. All those qualities — the
maturity and wisdom beyond
her years, the charisma, the con
fidence — translate into an
incredible point guard on the
court. But it's more than her
versatility to make the pass or
the shot, to defend the passing

lane and then get the steal. It's
more than her vast knowledge of
the game that makes her an
extension of the coach on the
floor.
It's the way she controls her
team. It's the way she carries
herself on the court. It's the way
she has the courage to get up in
front of a teary-eyed team after
playing her final collegiate game
and get them to lift their heads.
"If you could've seen Jamila
in that locker room," Van-
Derveer said with a tone of
mixed sadness and respect. "I'm
like, 'I don't have anything to
say,' and she is such a leader of
that team. She said stuff that
will stick with me forever. Peo
ple were very upset, but she was
like, you should've seen it. She

was standing in front of every
one and she was like, 'Pick your
heads up.' And I was like — it
was really — they respond to
her."
What was an incredible
moment for VanDerveer and
undoubtedly everyone in the
room was, for Wideman, one last
opportunity to speak to her
team, an opportunity she had to
take no matter how painful it
proved to be.
"I knew that was probably
going to be my last opportunity
to address our team when I was
still going to be an part of it in
the intimate way that you are as
a player," Wideman said.
"I was in shock and obviously
very disappointed that it was
over for us, but I didn't want to
let that space of time disappear
because something about the
immediacy of that locker room
and that space of time felt final
to me.
"I didn't want to lose that
opportunity to try to catch some
thing for myself and maybe to
throw something out there for
our team to hold on to as some
thing positive, something spe
cial, that hopefully will remain
for people for as long as they live
and longer than the hurt of los
ing will."
You can bet Wideman suc
ceeded. So how can one person
mean so much to such a team?
No one seems to be able to say
what it is, but they can all tell
you Wideman is the one they
wouldn't want to be without.
"I don't think I could put her
role into words," Starbird said.
"She ran the whole team on and
off the court. If you look at our
team, the one person who wasn't
replaceable was Jamila.
"From the moment we
stepped on the campus as fresh
men, we knew she was the lead
er. I owe a large portion of the
personal success and awards I've
received to her because she's
been such a great point guard.
There are different types of
point guards. Jamila's the one
that's really unselfish, dis
tributes the ball, runs the team.
She's been making me look good

for four years."
Wideman doesn't think she's
the one to answer the question
of what makes her so special but
offers a small explanation of
what she brings to the court.
"Hopefully what people feel is
that I'm willing to give anything
of myself to be successful,"
Wideman said. "And not just in
terms of our wins and losses but
for our team to be the kind of
team that's fun to be on and one
that you'd want to remember.
"1 put all of myself into that,
and so people trust my motiva
tions. I think it in some way
engenders a certain amount of
confidence.
"In terms of basketball, I
leave it all on the court. There's
no secret; I give everything that
I have and maybe for some peo
ple that example is something
they respect."
If the praise of her teammates
and coaches is any indication,
respect is a good word for Wide
man. VanDerveer said she's a
person who can "make a differ
ence in our world, not just the
basketball world," and Starbird
is just thankful to have played
with her and known her these
four years.
"When 1 think of my experi
ence at Stanford, I think Stan
ford has allowed me to have a
friendship with Jamila Wide
man," Starbird said. "She's one
of the great people at Stanford."
Wideman will go down as one
of Stanford's great point guards.
Her love for the game and com
petitive nature make her a great
player, but those indescribable
qualities that are so rare will
make her unforgettable.
Like any true competitor,
though, the enjoyment of her
remarkable career is outweighed
by her loss, at least for the time
being.
"I think right now it's hard,"
Wideman said. "I guess one of
the labels 1 didn't want for this
team was, 'It was a special team
but . . .' And right now I can't
really separate the two. It. is a
special team, and it wdl always
be. But it's not how 1 ever imag
ined it would end for this team."
