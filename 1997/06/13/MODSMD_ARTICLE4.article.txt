## Sing, Muse: An epic of undergraduate proportions 
### 
SING, MUSE, of a boy, a boy who
lived in the kingdom of New Jer
sey, a land of big hair, super-malls
and Z. Cavaricci poofy jeans.
The "Garden State" was no Garden
of Eden, and the nearby Poconos were
no match for the peaks of Olympus, but
this kingdom did possess simple plea
sures, and as the boy grew, a love for
the musical poetry of Bon Jovi, along
with Jersey-style floppy pizza drowned
in oregano, grew with him.
But eventually the boy yearned to be
free of highway tolls and humidity, and
he heard much of a far-off land of sun
and palm trees where he might quest
for knowledge, learning and passion.
And so, he traversed Interstate HO for
many thousands of leagues, was swayed
briefly by the siren song of Sacramento
and made his way through the Golden
Land to a fortified city of sandstone and
red tile.
He arrived at the Farm.
He knew little of this place, and was
quite surprised to find that it was a
farm unlike any other that he had expe
rienced. The pastures were populated
with young men and women throwing
ultralight discs at each other. The food

he found at his first-year domicile was
remarkably unfresh for a place with so
much room to grow produce, and the
lettuce seemed to have bypassed the
color of green eons ago.
As he explored this farm more, he
saw people speed by him wearing shoes
that seemed to make them fly across the
ground. Truly, these shoes had descend
ed from Hermes himself!
The boy found places of constant
cominotion on the Farm and a fair num
ber of spaces of silence. He saw art,
heard music and reveled in the new
world he had finally found.
The boy did not remain alone very
long at this place. He quickly joined up
with a band of characters, each on his
own journey, and they came to share
many adventures and sorrows together.
There was The Philosopher, a long
tressed contemplative sort, endlessly
fascinated by invisible waves in the air
and inexplicable thoughts but able to
give a piece of this inspiration to anyone
who listened. Next was Hurlbut, an
artist-cum-computer geek who could
stop a room of people in their tracks
simply hy laughing. And then The Mad
Doctor, who paired the precision of a

watchmaker with occasional Bacchana
lian debauchery.
As time passed, this band increased
in number. It came to include Jimmy-
Grow-Bigger, Pat in the Hat and the
Sage Schnook of Post-Modernism. They
were a motley crew, to be sure, but
together they made a life for themselves
at the farm-less Farm.
They spent their meals laughing at
and with each other and had their share
of travels and trips, good and bad. They
were not skanks, but skank they did,
and they often raved about the raves
that lasted through the world of Eos.
Once every week, they would gather in
front of a square box of multicolored
fire to watch an epic comedy of Homer
ic proportions.
The boy spent four years on the
Farm, each one shorter and better than
the last. He was taught to speak in the
tongue of a far-off land and voyaged
there with a brilliant and bearded
teacher who would help him to learn of
how power was different than energy
and how success was self-defined.
He wandered again, this time to the
capital of the land of Americus and
found that energy-efficiency suited him

more than power ties and that suits
would never be synonymous with suc
cess. Alas, he preferred his Grecian san
dals and shorts to patent leather loafers
and slacks.
But mourn not for the boy, for he
found what he was looking for on the
Farm. A year and a day after first arriv
ing at this wondrous world, he met
Gaia, who taught him how to hug and
helped him to realize that bungee jump
ing in oatmeal at 4 a.m. was more
important than passing microeco
nomics.
Years later, fiery passion flowered
with Hanako, and his only regret was
that he hadn't met her earlier.
But after four years, this undergrad
uate epic came to a close. With his many
other drunken revelers, the boy donned
a toga the color of night, covered him
self with a pointy cap with a few loose
threads hanging down and walked
wackily to the promised land, wherever
that would turn out to be.
He watched as his motley crew start
ed to scatter to the corners of the globe,
and he began to despair. Prophets
warned of impending adulthood and
burgeoning responsibility. An oracle

told him that he was about to leave
behind the "best years of his life."
But finally, the boy laughed. He
would go on to shed many tears for the
friendships that would separate and
wane, but he feared not for his youth
and enthusiasm.
The Farm, at which he had dreamed
and experienced so much, did not create
the inspiration he felt; it simply housed
it. As long as he did not allow himself to
forget who and what motivated his hap
piness, no measure of adulthood or
responsibility could take it away.
And in the final hours of his colle
giate collage, where drama and melo
drama meet, the boy celebrated as he
never had before. The present gradually
faded into the future, and the boy
thought to himself: Where one epic
ends, another begins.

Rahul Young, a graduating senior in
public policy, realizes that there may
only be 10 people in the world who
understand this column. But that's OK
because he wrote it for them.
