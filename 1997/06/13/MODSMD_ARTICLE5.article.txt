## Graduation will allow the mind to take flight 
### 
WHAT MAKES YOU feel like a
senior? Is it a single, a thesis,
the pressure between your
shoulder blades, which you have named
"The Future?"
In high school, it was a lounge, a
good parking space and the ability to go
for Chinese food in the middle of the
day and not face the wrath of the head
of Upper School upon returning. It was
taking applications to the post office at
the last possible minute in the fall and
pasting the bumper sticker of your col
lege to a car window in the spring.
Four years later, the 'S' on my back
window is fading, and I am a senior
again. For a few more days at least.
I think my status finally hit me walk
ing across campus last Sunday night on
my way to "The Graduate," seeing the
throngs of my classmates dressed in
their black robes, caps in one hand, beer
bottles in the other. I was wearing
boots, perhaps the signature senior
shoe: noisy, cocky, impractical. This is
how it feels to be a senior: a little confi
dent, a little tipsy.
It's a little disorienting.
I know I'm a senior because the peo
ple around me are tallying up things
they've never done at Stanford, from

going up Hoover Tower to having sex in
the south stacks of Green Library.
I see casual acquaintances, people
from CIV section or No on 187 phone
banking and, in parting, we say, "I'll see
you soon" and then stop suddenly
because we know we won't. I find
myself looking a little longer at the
faces of my friends, trying to burnish
the images on the inside of my mind.
I haven't started taking pictures yet,
but I suspect a little alcohol and a little
nostalgia could send me out with a
bunch of similarly inclined people, pos
ing in the Quad, the Oval, in front of
Mem Chu. Photographs taken for an
album to be seen 15 years from now,
pictures that say "I was here."
As for how I got to be here, I have
absolutely no idea. I feel like I'm play
ing dress-up in my robe but as what? I
am too young to be a Supreme Court
justice and too old to go as Obi-Wan
Kenobi for Halloween.
People point to the trappings of my
responsible adulthood — job, apart
ment, diploma — but it doesn't seem to
fit right with a person who won't wear
socks and doesn't own a watch. How did
I get to be old enough to be "The Grad
uate"?

Clearly, 1 did, and for the first time in
many Septembers, I won't have a first
day of school this fall. No new pens or
legal pads or countdowns until the
three-day weekend.
The thought would probably be more
terrifying if I weren't absolutely certain
I will be back before long.
It is a small miracle to be a student. I
love the book shopping at the beginning
of the quarter, the way I have gone from
owning books to having a library. 1 love
the way the sky looks at 6 a.m., the time
when the neatly formatted pages are
coming out of the printer and the ice in
a 32-ounce Diet Coke has long since
turned to water.
I need to be a student, but my won
derful professors aside, I can't say I'm
going to miss it because I know I'm
coming back.
What I will miss most about being at
Stanford is that the University is the
vehicle for gathering together so many
of the people I love. There is the part in
"The Wizard of Oz" when Dorothy
turns to the Tin Man and says,"I think
I'll miss you most of all."
For me, there is no individual body
which inhabits the "you." Rather, it is
the crazy quilt of the really beautiful

people who have inhabited my life over
the past four years.
It seems specious to refer to my col
lege experience when there is nothing
singular about it; the whole is constitut
ed through and by the sum of its parts.
I would name names, but there's really
no point; each name would bring up
another and another and another.
More than anything, I take with me
are the syllables of time, the little
moments that have coalesced into the
memory of a feeling of completeness.
1 am ready to pack up and take the
experiences along. Amid the general
hue and cry over wanting to stay forev
er, about never having it as good as we
have it now, I am very glad to be gradu
ating.
I may not wear a watch, but 1 do
know that time only moves forward and
that's not entirely a bad thing. From
the end of high school, I remember the
feeling of having outgrown a space. It. is
not so different now.
It's tempting to write about gradua
tion in terms of beginnings and endings;
there's a nice symmetry to them and pat
homilies abound in discussing either
subject. Hut really we are entering the
middle, the muddle between the start

inggate and the finish line.
There is no catchword, no "plastics,"
that makes the navigation of this space
that graduates refer to as "the future"
easy.
But it shouldn't be. What lies ahead
seems to be much like Mrs. Robinson
herself, both unknown and familiar and
immensely appealing for the mix.
I am playing croquet in the Wacky
Walk, a nod to both my precious time in
Oxford and to the brilliant coming-of
age text of "Alice in Wonderland."
"Sometimes," said the White Queen,
"I've dreamed as many as six impossible
things before breakfast." Ultimately,
this is what it is to be a senior: the
ripeness of opportunities, the mar
velous scope of imagination, the audaci
ty to claim t he impossible for ourselves
time after time.
On Sunday, once again, the mind
takes flight.

ern thought and literature, is off to do
