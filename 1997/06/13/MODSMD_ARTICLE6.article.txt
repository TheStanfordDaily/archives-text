## Unforeseen, unforgotten: Four years of fortuities 
### 
"Our day-to-day life is bombarded with
fortuities or, to be more precise, with the
accidental meetings of people and events
we call coincidences. 'Coincidence'
means that two events unexpectedly hap
pen at the same time, they meet. ..."
— Milan Kundera, "The Unbearable
Lightness of Being"
AT ABOUT 8:26 a.m. on the first
day of Orientation, I waited for
my Branner key — entirely
unsuspecting of the significance of the
person who happened to be standing
before me in line.
Her name was Stacie. She was some
girl from Oregon.
But now I think of her — the first
person I met that day — as my fresh
man, sophomore and senior year
"roomie."
Later that day I saw Shirley, whom I
met the previous spring at a campus on
the opposite coast. Since then, she, who
was just another "pre-frosh" at a party,
has become one of my best friends and
was my sophomore and junior roomie.
Kismet? Serendipity? Yes. Both.
Those words epitomize the past four
years — random circumstance made
meaningful memory and forever friend.

In the first moments of Orientation,
I intended to get the best bed, the best
desk, the best closet — instead, I got the
worst of all those and a best friend.
But as the 1950s British artist
Lawrence Alloway said, "Yesterday's
tomorrow is not today." Likewise, so
many things I intended throughout my
years here have not come to fruition.
Yet I am fully content with what did.
True, if I had a dime for every rejec
tion, (in)decisional saga, homesick sob
session, major switch, paper-pumping
all-nighter, romantic fiasco, tearful
phone call home, thesis topic about
face, bike accident, grade disappoint
ment and stress-induced sleepless
night, I could pay for all four years of
my tuition, plus buy a Jamba Juice
smoothie for every person on campus.
But when I enter Stanford Stadium
this Sunday, I will no longer be the
flaky freshman who took 13 farcical
units her first quarter — Photography I
and two notorious requirements I won't
even name. Nor will I be the flummoxed
sophomore who planned to major in
hum bio, then poli sci, then fem studies,
then English, then finally modern
thought and literature.
And I will not even be the travel

obsessed Stanford in Oxford junior who
never slept a Wednesday night spring
quarter, took a trip to the Continent or
Scotland every other weekend and went
to Amsterdam three times in two
months.
For this Sunday, I will be one of the
1,600 seniors who made it to the finish
line — neither first, nor last, but next to
everyone else and flanked by my
friends.
Together with you, the Class of '97, I
will walk into the stadium my own
wacky way just like I walked onto cam
pus with you in September 1993. We
will create meaningful pandemonium
all over the field just as we did all over
campus for the past four years. And we
will be watched from afar by our fami
lies just as we have been watched since
we were frosh.
We will applaud each other, we will
hug each other, and we will walk out
together.
Then we will disperse.
Some of us will coterm, others will
pursue degrees on more (or less) tech
nologically oriented places than this
Farm, and still others will conduct their
research far from any university; some
will work on campus, others in San

Francisco and still others (including
me) in places like Indonesia; some will
marry, others will leave their loves, and
still others will seek love.
But one thing all of us will do — keep
in touch.
As Kundera says, Human lives "are
composed like music. Guided by his
sense of beauty, an individual trans
forms a fortuitous occurrence . . . into a
motif, which then assumes a permanent
place in the composition of the individu
al's life." Hence, Stacie, Shirley and the
many other "random" people I met here
who are now permanent motifs in my
life.
Kundera continues: "It is wrong,
then, to chide the novel for being fasci
nated by mysterious coincidences . . .
but it is right to chide man for being
blind to such coincidences in his daily
life. For he thereby deprives his life of a
dimension of beauty."
Feeling excitement and fear, I leave
here for an unfamiliar country that
speaks an unfamiliar language. Hut I go
enriched by a dimension of beauty made
up of Branner, Toyon, EAST, Oxford,
Roth; Screw-Your-Roommates / Sibs,
Taboo ski trips, boat dances, retreats,
THE GAME, special dinners; Nietzsche,

honors seminars, Green Library,
Oxford tutorials, Tresidder LaIR, my
thesis; Intermission articles, tutoring
sessions, a SIG internship, an NPK
internship; fro yo, Noah's bagels, Juice
Boosts, Salisbury's hummus, ricotta,
yogurt, La Costena's burritos, Korean
food, couscous like snow; "Brown-eyed
Girl" hyper-spaz dancing, "When Harry
Met Sally," two LSI) trips (Laguna Seca
Daze, silly), Haight Ashbury; sponta
neous midnight jaunts to the beach,
jogs around Lake Lag, walks to the
Dish, swims in de Guerre, Rollerblading
and skydiving . . . and the friends who
have done these things with me.
1 — "The Dancing Queen" — I will
survive, together with you.
So we embark on our freshman year
out of college — heads full of knowledge,
boxes full of books, eyes full of tears,
hearts full of memories and arms full of
friends. And keep in mind the Nigerian
proverb, "Hold a true friend with both
your hands."
