Stanford alumni and Silicon Valley pioneers
David Packard and William Hewlett jointly donated

cost of $110 million will sit west of the main
Five existing buildings, including the Physics
I'mik, will be demolished to make way for the pro

gift was the single largest donation in the history of
Stanford

After a year-long study, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education unveiled a 64-page
report detailing its recommendations for the future
of Stanford's undergraduate program. Changes
included the development of a three-quarter sci
ence core and strengthened writing and foreign
language requirements, as well as a call for longer
term looks at such facets of undergraduate life as
teaching, advising, grading and the academic calen
dar. The Faculty Senate spent the year reviewing,
debating, and voting on the report's proposals.
After more than four years of highly publicized
investigation and debate, the government ended its
indirect-cost dispute with Stanford, dropping all
claims that the University overbillcd it by $185 mil
lion in research costs over a 12-year period in
exchange for a $1.2 million fee. The controversy
made Stanford the focus of much negative press
attention and led to the 1992 resignation of then-
University President Donald Kennedy. The atten
tion on billing practices at Stanford and other
schools also led the government to create a new sys
tem of indirect-cost regulation.

Governor Pete Wilson was re-elected as well, beat

Dean of Students Michael Jackson and his wife,
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana Akivama,
announced their resignations from the University.
Jackson left in March to accept the position of vice
president for student affairs at the University of
Southern California, while Akivama planned to pur

sue a doctorate and serve as a lecturer at USC.

Palo Alto police arrested two men in connection
with the Nov. 13 murder of Stanford graduate stu
dent David Liu at a Palo Alto apartment. At the
time of the murder — which police said was moti
vated by robbery — the 23-year-old Liu was on aca
demic leave of absence while completing the work
requirement for a master's degree in product
design.

In response to the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education's report, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven announced that departments
in his school will be required to come up with minor
programs before the 1996-97 academic year. Minors
will probably require students to complete 25 to 30
units of work, Shoven said at the time. Faculty Sen
ate members were largely enthusiastic about the
idea.
Art Prof. Albert Risen, an internationally
renowned scholar responsible for obtaining most of
Stanford's outdoor art collection, died of an appar
ent heart attack. Elsen was also a highly regarded
teacher whose classes drew large numbers of stu
dents.
The Board of Trustees approved a 5.5-percent
tuition hike, slightly higher than the previous
year's 5-percent jump. The increase — which comes
from a 2-percent increase plus the inflation rate
brought tuition for the 1995-96 school year to
$19,695.
Stanford announced plans to create a new inter
disciplinary program to be called ('omparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity. The program will allow
students to choose a major or minor in C'hicano
Studies, Asian-American Studies or African and
Afro-American Studies. Much of the work behind
the proposal was done by two committees formed to
examine possible programs in C'hicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies in the wake of the May
1994 hunger strike.

In a precedent-setting decision, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Peter Stone struck
down Stanford's speech code. Stone ordered an
injunction against the Grey Interpretation to the
Fundamental Standard after nine Stanford stu
dents and alumni brought a suit against the Uni
versity in May 1994 The group argued that the code
violated California's Leonard Law, which extends

First Amendment protections to students at private
universities.

The Santa Clara County District Attorney's
Office charged former Bookstore general manager
Eldon Speed, former assistant general manager
Philip Chiaramonte and former controller Patrick
McDonald with grand theft and tax evasion, the
first criminal charges to be brought in a case
sparked when a Feb. 5, 1992, story in The Daily
revealed that senior managers at the Bookstore
were receiving perks unheard of at other university
bookstores. Speed and Chiaramonte both face up to
eight years in prison and McDonald five years for
such alleged crimes as using Bookstore money to
purchase a house in Twain Harte, Calif., and to
make personal loans.
University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice announced that Stanford
would neither support a University-wide boycott of
grapes nor allow administrative units — considered
to be representatives of the University — to boycott.
The decision, in response to a report released by a
committee formed after the May 1994 hunger
strike, effectively continued the current policy but
gave more University support to student education
on the issues.
University officials canceled the traditional Com
mencement procession in an effort to shorten cere
monies and move the event stage closer to the audi

After failing to get enough pledges to fill 90 per
cent of their houses with members, Kappa Alpha
and Beta 'I beta Pi lost their houses to the Draw.
Since the I niversity is reviewing its policy on Greek
housing, some unhoused fraternities or sororities
mav receive these houses in the future.

Provost Condoleezza Rice outlined $4.6 million
in budget cuts for the 1995-96 academic year, much
of which was to be achieved through holding al loca
tions to the I niversity's academic divisions con
stant, without increasing for inflation. Schools will
also be assessed a "space charge" based on the
square footage they occupy as well as a 6-percent
levy on expenditures from restricted funds.
