title.

work and coach at a prestigious university
like Stanford," Cook said.

Two freshmen named Ail-Americans
Right fielder Edmund Muth and designat
ed hitter John Gall were selected Monday to
freshman All-America teams by Baseball
America. Muth was a first-team selection and
Gall made the second team.
The left-handed Muth platooned with
Nick Day at the beginning of the season but
quickly settled into a more regular role. He
ranked among conference leaders in hitting
and ended with a .388 average, seventh best
in Stanford history and the best since San
Francisco Giant David McCarty batted .420
in 1991. No Stanford freshman has ever hit

for a higher average than Muth, who regis
tered nine home runs and 46 RBIs.
Gall also earned a starting spot for good
early on and never let up, crushing the team's
first grand slam of the year in the NCAA
West Regional against Santa Clara and
smacking 97 hits, the most since McCarty's
100 in 1991. Gall also drove in 59 runs with
18 doubles and eight homers.
