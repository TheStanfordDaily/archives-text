## Lavender Celluloid Film Festival Celebrates Diversity of lesbian and Gay Lives 
### 
These days if a film's too risky or too
smart or too anything, chances are no dis
tributor will go anywhere near it. Which is
why film festivals are such a blessing. And
the San Francisco International Lesbian &
Ciay Film Festival, ending Sunday, is a double

blessing. Though much has been said about
gay films moving into the mainstream, there
are still very few theaters showing anything
near what gay lives are like.
The Festival, on the other hand, reflects
the diversity of gay lives, showing movies

that probably won't play in Peoria. This
weekend you can catch anything from a
drama about lesbian desire and shitting at
titudes in contemporary New Delhi
("Fire") to a documentary about frat boys
dealing with love and the closet at USC
("Defying Gravity"). "Different for Girls,"
the closing night movie, is a romantic com
edy about Prentice, a bike messenger (Ru
pert Graves), who reunites with his old
friend Karl (Steven Mackintosh), who has
had a sex change and become Kim.
1 personally have a weakness for Graves,
whose presence in "Maurice' and "Where
Angels Fear to Tread" and other Forster
Hicks have done much to lighten many a
melancholy day and bring some hope into
my miserable little life. But this is the kind

of romantic comedy that we don't get very
often, and so we have to treasure it when it
comes along our way.
According to the recording at the Film
Festival's voice mail, everything's sold-out,
but tickets often become available at the last
minute, so it's worth going on stand-by on
the night of the screening. "Different for
Girls'" shows on Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at the
Castro Theater (429 Castro St.). Tickets
cost $15 general admission. "Fire" and "De
fying Gravity" show this Friday at 7 and
9:30 p.m. respectively at the Castro Theater.
Tickets cost $7.50. For a complete listing of
movies showing and ticket information,
call the 24-hour hotline at 703-8663. Run,
don't walk.
