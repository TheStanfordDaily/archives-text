# My Best Friend's Wedding
## 
### 
"My Best Friend's Wedding" presents itself
as a conundrum, both for the audience and
for the characters. It tells the story of two best
friends who vow to marry each other if still
single at 28. However, just movie minutes
from the crucial birthday, Michael (Dermot
Mulroney) announces his plan to marry rich
schoolgirl Cameron Diaz. Julianne, played by
lulia Roberts in full-on "Pretty Woman" red
hair armor, realizes that she is in love with her
best buddy and must somehow contrive to
sabotage the wedding before the credits roll.
This is the conundrum facing the characters:
Michael must choose between these compet
itive women, while julianne must decide how
to keep the couple apart.
The puzzle facing the audience is more
complex: Who to root for? This kind of
complexity makes "Wedding" stand out
from romantic comedies which are cute,
cuddly and predictable from start to finish,
lulianne's character is just despicable
enough, while Kimmy's character is just ad
mirable enough to make the outcome of the

film entirely unclear yet entirely believable.
It's a knotty problem, and one of the film's
strengths.
The character of Michael is unfortunately
undeveloped, and it is never clear why these
(wo women would go to such lengths to win
his love.
On the contrary, the most fantastic part of
the movie, both in performance and charac
ter is Rupert Everett's portrayal of lulianne's
gay counterpart, George. In George, Everett
is able to create a comic fiesta of wackiness.
The man who can rouse a luncheon to a cho
rus of Dionne Warwick classics is the man
everyone should be fighting over.
Director P. J. Hogan brings to this film his
zany antics from "Muriel's Wedding" —
minus the disturbing dramas which jarred
the comedy of that film — and uses them to
good, Beetlejuician effect.
In fact, "Wedding" becomes almost a mu
sical at times, and everyone in the cast with
the exception of Roberts (someone thankful
ly saw the disastrous results of her singing in
"Everyone Says I Love") gives singing a go.
Never mind Julia Roberts, lohn Denver is
represented in the repertoire — a clear sign of
a film that has its priorities straight.
