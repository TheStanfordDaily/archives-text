# Batman and Robin
## 
### 
Unfortunate is the first word that comes to
mind upon seeing "Batman and Robin," the
latest installment in the franchise. It is unfor
tunate that unimaginative director Joel Schu
macher has come to the helm of what Tim
Burton started so oddly and wittily in 1989. It
is unfortunate that instead of making a movie,
the filmmakers here decided to pay Arnold
Schwarzenegger $25 million to say 25-too
many one-liners involving the word "chill"
and string them all together with those uttered
by George Clooney et al. There are just too
many characters cluttering up the screen.
It is especially unfortunate that Schu
macher honestly believes that America is
hankering for prolonged shots of rubber
clad bums, chests and crotches, and that all
female action heroes would choose to do
their karate maneuvers and cape-swishing
leaps in the ever practical — but timeless —
six-inch heeled shoe. (Poor Alicia!)
These complaints aside, Clooney does as
good a job as can be expected — considering
the shaky script — and Uma Thurman chews

up the scenery in fine form. The set design
and art direction is impressive, and Gotham
looks good even if it sounds bad. Alicia Sil
verstone is given some horrifyingly bad lines,
but at least she isn't whining along with Chris
O'Donnell, who should be kicked out of the
Batcave to make room for Batgirl's six-inch
heels and pointy-eared hat.
