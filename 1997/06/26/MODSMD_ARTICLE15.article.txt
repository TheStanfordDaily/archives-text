## Peter Mulvey Deep Blue 
### 
The indie folk-rock scene has
been gaining popularity in recent
years, with artists such as Ani
I >il ranco and Ben Harper achiev
ing broad commercial success
without seeming to 'sell out'. With
Deep Blue," Peter Mulvey has
i rafted an alburn that places him at
the forefront of the ranks of folk
rockers ready to cross over into the
realm of financial success.
A truly talented singer-song
writer, Mulvey is not riding the
aging gravy train of Bob Dylan im
itators. "Deep Blue" is his fourth
studio album, and the tracks are
imbued with a maturity of intellect
and articulated emotion that in
. reases as the album progresses.
" I )eep Blue" blends acoustic flat-

picking and wavering electric solos
into subtly sophisticated music. The
album starts with "Grace," a trancy
anthem-rock tune that echoes of
U2's hit album "Joshua Tree" (ac
cording to his web site [www.peter
mulvey.com] one of the CD's in
"heavy rotation" in Mulvey's car
stereo is U2's newest, "Pop").
Several slow, slide-rock tunes
follow. "Smoke," "Midwife" and
"Take This" blend Mulvey's mellow
acoustic guitar and David
Goodrich's searing slide guitar into
gentle mood rock over Mike PiehPs
tantastic, understated drumming.
Although the opening riff of
No Sense Of Humor" sounds sus
piciously like a recent Shawn
Colvin pop hit, it quickly becomes
a bluesy, protagonistic romp.
"What a grand idea this is!/ I
should have thought of this be
fore./I could tell you loved me
when you throw my pills across the
kitchen and slammed/the bath

room door," he sings, viciously
teasing a lover.
The sparse, midtempo title
track chronicles the historical de
teat of chess champion Gary Kas
parov at the hands of the IBM com
puter Deep Blue. In case Mulvey's
complex emotional reaction to the
event isn't clear in the lyrics, the
liners notes list the track as a "song
tor deep blue," but it is simultane
ously "dedicated to Gary Kas
parov." The album then winds up
with five more eclectic songs that
range from quiet solo picking to
fast straight-forward rock. What
ever the incarnation, Mulvey's
sound (honed from playing in the
legendary acoustic battleground of
the Boston subway system) uses
several tools to create a well-pro
duced, balanced, beautifully
sounding album that even Leonard
Cohen and l'hil Ochs would be
proud to call their own.
