## Bimal Shah It's in student hands Teaching quality determined by learners 
### 
END OF a school year is
marked by many traditions.
Here at Stanford, in addition
to the usual pomp and circum
stance of commencement, it seems
there is yet another ritual: the an
nouncement of various teaching
honors. Bing Fellowships, Rhodes
Prizes and the Phi Beta Kappa
Teaching Award are a few. Each of
the awards recognizes excellence in
teaching, and although they have
slightly different selection criteria
and procedures, the recipients tend
to share certain qualities. The win
ners invariably bring clarity and en
thusiasm to the classroom and
humor quite often as well. They in
spire and they challenge and they
have surely played a part in more
than one student's decision to pur
sue advanced study in a particular
field.

The consumers of edu
cation — the students —
must begin to place a
higher value on the
quality of teaching
rather than the scholar
ly distinctions of a uni
versity s faculty.

The recipients of these honors
are undoubtedly deserving of our
respect and admiration, as are nu
merous other professors who have
not won such awards but are also
committed and capable when it
comes to teaching. Despite the
presence of these talented instruc
tors, there is still a common com
plaint heard from many of my fel
low students, namely that the
quality of teaching here could use a
boost. The usual targets for such
criticism are departments such as
mathematics where it's easy to
make fun of the professor or the
TA whose first, language is not
English. However, other depart
ments also receive their share of
criticism, and at least some of it
well-deserved.
If it's true that the quality of
teaching is poor (and I don't neces
sarily think that it is), why is this
the case? This is a question that
I've thought about on several occa
sions, but for which I still have no
definite answer. One possibility is
that professors simply lack the
skills to teach effectively even
though they truly want to do a
good job for their students. It
would seem then that the logical
solution is more instruction for the
instructors — that is, more advice
on how to teach effectively.
But what if this is not the case?
Maybe the real reason for lacklus
ter teaching is that some proles

sors regard teaching simply as
something they must do if they are
to do what they really like to do —
research. It's sort of like a child
who grudgingly eats his vegetables
so he can have his desert or like a
kid who does his chores so his par
ents will then let him play.
I am not trying to say professors
are childish. Nor I am trying to say
the two — top-notch scholarship
and excellent teaching — are mu
tually exclusive. Economics Prof.
John Taylor, one of the recipients
of the Rhodes Prize, is a case in
point. Widely acknowledged for his
excellent teaching by students who
have taken Economics 1: "Elemen
tary Economics", he is also a well
respected scholar and was a top
economist in the Dole camp during
last year's presidential campaign.
M y point is simply that if an insti
tution places a greater emphasis
on research rather than teaching,
and Stanford and its peers ar
guably do, the average teaching
performance will likely suffer.
What could the university do to
remedy the situation? Placing
greater priority on teaching by
linking its quality to the tenure
process might work, but universi
ties are reluctant to take this step.
It may sound surprising, but I
don't blame them for their hesita
tion. The reputation of a college de
pends mostly on the scholarly
achievements of its faculty and the
success of its graduates. Only to
the extent that the quality of
teaching affects the success of the
university's graduates does it have
an effect on reputation.
Does this mean the situation is
hopeless? Some will say universi
ties should forget about the nebu
lous concept of reputation and sim
ply focus on students. Yet reputa
tion is what drew many of us to a
school like Stanford in the first
place, so one can hardly expect a
university to dismiss it.
But students can help to re
shape reputation. After all, reputa
tion depends on the values of oth
ers. While institutions try to im
prove their images, they can do so
only by coming more into line with
the values of those who judge
them. The consumers of education
— the students — must begin to
place a higher value on the quality
of teaching rather than the schol
arly distinctions of a university's
faculty. Only if we redefine reputa
tion to reflect greater concern with
the quality ot teaching will univer
sities change. A.s much responsibil
ity as our university leaders must
hear, students are even more re
sponsible for their education.
While this may seem obvious to
many, it is an often forgotten point
in this discussion.
