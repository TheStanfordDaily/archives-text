## Basking in the surreal at Stanford 
### 
SUMMERS AT STANFORD,
I've come to realize, are
rather surreal.
Not surreal in the in-your-face,
Salvador Dali, of-course-clocks
don't-usually-melt way, but
rather surreal in the subtle, Rene
Magritte, on-first-glance-that
looks-like-a-normal-conservative-
ly-dressed-man-but-wait-there's-
an-enormous-apple-in-front-of-
his-face manner.
This is now my third summer
as a Stanford student, but it's the
first I've spent on campus. When I
spent the summer after my fresh
man year at home in South Or
ange, life around the New Jersey
suburb seemed no different than
it ever had, except perhaps it was
a bit hotter. When I spent last
summer in Manhattan, the city
seemed no different than it ever
had, except apparently there were
fewer homicides. And this sum
mer, at first, Stanford seemed no
different than it ever did.
But I quickly began to notice
subtle deviations from the Farm's
norms.
The throngs of athletic-looking
students surging out of Stern and
Toyon and Branner and Wilbur
whom I pass every day on mv way
back and forth to Mirrielees are
not Stanfordians out for their
evening jogs. Instead, they are
high school students on campus
for various sorts of camps. So far,
I've heard mention of a soccer
camp, a swimming camp and the
"Youth for Understanding" con
fab, whatever exactly it might be.
The phalanx of football players

who held up traffic for a good seven
minutes as they crossed Campus
Drive heading toward the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center were, I first
thought as I sat waiting to contin
ue my drive, the Cardinal squad
preparing for a new season. But
then I noticed they were all at least
a foot too short to be Division I-A
players. My trip to Safeway was in
fact not being delayed by Stanford
athletes but, apparently, by a high
school football camp.
And that's the surreal quality
of a Stanford summer. Everything
seems normal — the students
leaving their Escondido Road dor
mitories to take care of their days'
business, the athletes crossing the
street to Arrillaga — but at the
same time it's not quite normal.
Everyday life seems the same, but
it also seems different.
The lines at the Bookstore are
just as long, but the customers
waiting to pay are not students
buying their books. They're for
eign tourists buying their sweat
shirts and postcards.
Rollerbladers fly around the
Quad, but the skaters aren't stu
dents late for class. They're area
residents out for some peaceful
exercise.
Those few things that are un
questionably different during the
summer are transpiring on that
same familiar Stanford back
ground, and that makes the differ
ences seem surreal. The annoying
Rollerblade and skateboard kids
on the steps of Meyer Library are
gone for the summer (hopefully
their parents packed them off for

summer camp, or juvenile hall, or
something), but a trip to the li
brary seems strange when there's
no need to dodge kamikaze 15-
year olds. The lunch lines at
Tresidder are negligible, but a
Panino Mio almost doesn't taste
right when it's available that
quickly.
Of course, the most surreal
part ot a summer at Stanford is
living in an on-campus residence,
surrounded by other students and
checking e-mail via SUNet, yet
not attending classes and doing
the associated readings and as
signments. It means that when I
get home at the end of the day, I'm
free to go out for dinner or to a
movie, or just to sit and watch
television (God, I love "Nick at
Nite") without feeling any guilt
about the paper I'm not writing or
the problem set I'm not doing.
But the price of that luxury
comes at a real cost. Not having a
student-type lifestyle, at least for
the summer, means that I can't
sleep in until my first class, at 11
a.m., or even sleep through that
class if I so desire. Instead, I've got
to go to sleep early, to get up early,
to be at work bright and early.
And keeping a schedule like
that, on the same campus where I
usually stay up 'til all hours and
then sleep the day away, is the
most surreal part of all.

Jesse Oxfeld, a once and future
communication major, thinks it
would be fun to spend the day
wearing a bowler hat, a dark suit
and a large apple.
