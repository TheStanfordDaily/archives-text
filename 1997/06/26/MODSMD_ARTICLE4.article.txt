## Dekes lose their house Wais overrules judical board in setting punishment 
### Allison Hays Contributing writer 
After a May 25 incident in which
an intoxicated Delta Kappa Epsilon
pledge was taken to the hospital on
the advice of his dormitory's resi
dent fellow, Dean of Students Marc
Wais has evicted the Dekes from
their house, a sanction more severe
than that recommended by the
Greek Judicial Board, fraternity
members said.
When Wais was questioned re
garding the length of the eviction,
he said that "if the fraternity com
plies with all the University's sanc
tions, they have a written guaran
tee of reclaiming their house at 592
Mayfield Ave. as early as Septem
ber 1998."
1 le declined further comment on
the specific sanctions, citing the
confidentiality of the judicial
process.
Wais' action marked the second
time in the 1996-97 school year
that he elected to override the
board's recommended punishment
in favor of a harsher one. In Octo
ber, after a minor-in-possession ci
tation was issued at an Orienta
tion-week Sigma Chi party, Wais
upped the judicial board's suggest
ed sanctions to include alcohol and
social probation for the duration of
fall quarter.
Also, this marked the second
time in Wais' 21-month tenure at
Stanford that a disciplinary action
taken by his ofilce has resulted in a
fraternity losing its house. At the

start of the 1995-96 school year,
just after his arrival, Wais an
nounced that the Delta I au Delta
fraternity would lose its house be
cause of ongoing management and
behavior problems.
"After careful review as dean of
students, I provided the fraternity
what I believe to be fair and appro
priate sanctions based on the
events of May 25," Wais said.
Freshman Edward Hyuck re
turned home to Kimball Hall from
a Deke event May 25 in a suffi
ciently intoxicated state to prompt
his resident assistants to contact
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford,
the Kimball RF, for guidance. Rick
ford advised the RAs to bring
Hyuck to Stanford Hospital, where
he was found to have a very high
blood-alcohol level.
Rickford took action after the
incident to promote awareness in
the Kimball. "I wrote the entire
dorm immediately after this, urg
ing caution and moderation in the
light of this incident, reminding
them that alcohol can kill," he said.
"I don't think that anyone wants a
no-alcohol policy on campus .. . but
we have to hold paramount the
safety and well-being of the stu
dents."
Greek disciplinary actions in
volve a two-step process. First, the
Greek Judicial Board — made up of
students and advised by the direc
tor of student activities — con
venes, meets with the fraternity, re
views the facts and decides on a rec
ommended punishment. The dean

of students then examines the find
ings and recommended punish-
in addition to consulting with
University officials and reviewing
the fraternity's historical behav
ioral record and the recommenda
tions of past review boards in simi
lar cases, before determining the of
ficial sanctions..
"All of those elements are part of
the final decision, but the final deci
sion is mine to make," Wais said.
"The Greek Judicial Board
makes influential, not decisive sug
gestions," he added. "Their find
ings and recommendation serve as
the foundation of the decision, but
they are advisory in nature. The
sanctions I have added on to the
recommendations in this case are
appropriate and reflect the serious
ness of the events of May 25."
The judicial board recommend
ed that the fraternity be placed on
probation for one year and not be
permitted to throw parties during
that period. The recommended
sanction also had a community-ser
vice component. "Our decisions are
meant to be above all constructive,"
one judicial board member said.
Wais incorporated all but one of
the board's recommendations, but
he decided to take a tougher stance
when he forced the members out of
their house.
Some Dekes believe that Wais
punishment was too harsh.
"The judgment isn't fair," said
senior Bruce Gibney. "Although

the incident was serious, Deke's
good record, openness during the
review process and, most of all, the
pledge's decision to drop the matter
do not seem to have been adequate
ly considered by Dean Wais."
Many feel that there is a growing
chasm between the fraternity sys
tem and the administration. Junior
Matthew Lippert and other mem
bers of the Greek Judicial Board be
lieve that the proceedings in this
decision making process were not
conducted appropriately. In partic
ular, Lippert said "there has been a
flagrant lack of communication be
tween the board and the dean of
students. The process would be im
proved if we were given more of the
details that influenced the final de
cision."

The alleged lack of communica
tion was also an issue in the notice
Wais sent to the Dekes informing
them of their status. "The clearly
slipshod nature of Wais' memo —
names were misspelled and facts
were not correct — coupled with
Wais' total unfamiliarity with
precedent during the ejection meet
ing, which took place only hours be
fore the quarter ended, put a strain
on the already weak credibility of
the OH'ice of the Dean of Students,"
Gibney said.
In the last three years, four fra
ternities have been evicted from
housing. But Wais denied charge
that he is trying to phase out frater
nities. "Absolutely not," he said.
"The University cannot be held re
sponsible if the fraternities conduct
themselves in inappropriate ways
which force the University to pro
vide sanctions which sometimes in
cludes the loss of their housing priv
ilege."
