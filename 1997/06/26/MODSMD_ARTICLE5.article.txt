Gupta tenure case continues
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta's tenure
file has been directed to the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council for further consideration.
Provost Condoleezza Rice forwarded Gupta's case
to the Advisory Board after he filed a grievance protest
ing the decision of John Shoven, dean of the School of
1 lumanities mid Sciences, to deny him tenure.
According to the provost's office, the board's
recommendation is usually accepted by the Uni
versity president and is considered the final level of
peer review for faculty tenure. The board plans to
reach a decision by the end of July.
Gupta's case has drawn grassroots support
from graduate students and other anthropologists
around the country.
