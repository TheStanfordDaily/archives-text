### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
The Board of
Trustees met
June 12 for its
annual budget
approval meet
ing. Board Chair
Robert Bass said
the budget had
not been contro
versial among
the trustees and

was passed without impassioned
discussion.
The board approved the con
cept designs for the renovation of
all five residences in Cowell Clus
ter, to be renovated next summer.
It also approved the start of con
struction on the education build
ing, an upgrade of Memorial Hall
and the renovation of Encina
Hall, which will house the Insti
tute for International Studies.
Bass said the board did not dis
cuss the measure addressing stu
dent representation on the board
that appeared on the ASSU
Spring General Election ballot.

Bass said that because there are
students on the individual com
mittees of the board, student con
cerns are already being repre
sented.
The committee on external af
fairs did, however, hear a report
on the status of the project of the
new World Wide Web site being
set up as an alternative to the U.S.
News & World Report ratings of
colleges and universities. Clark
University in Massachusetts has
agreed to participate in building a
site.
Having been reelected as chair
man for next year, Bass said he
felt this year had been an good one
and that the initiation of Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper's
Stanford Introductory Studies
initiative was a "wonderful
achievement. The level of faculty
interest will result in 80 percent of
the freshman class being able to
participate in the freshman semi
nars," Bass said.
Bass also said the movement
toward the newly merged Medical
Center is "coming along," but he
refused to comment further.
