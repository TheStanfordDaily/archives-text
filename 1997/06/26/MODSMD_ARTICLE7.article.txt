# Blood donations needed
## 
### Elizabeth Pianca Contributing writer 
The Stanford University Blood Center has issued
an appeal for donors of all blood types to replenish
supplies used at the Stanford Hospital. On the week
end of June 14 and 15 four motor-vehicle accidents
and five organ transplants resulted in significant
blood transfusions that depleted the Blood Center's
reserve supplies.
"We are currently critically low on type O-nega
tive and type B-positive blood." said Caryn Huber
man, a spokesperson for the blood center. "Due to
the upcoming July Fourth weekend every blood cen
ter is running tight. Therefore we cannot rely on sis
ter blood centers to donate blood."
15 percent of all blood donations made annually to
the Stanford Blood Center comes from University
students, faculty and staff.
The hlood center usually sees a decrease in dona
tions during the summer months because there are
fewer students on campus and many community
donors go on vacation. Still, "there is usually an in

crease in blood requested by local hospitals," Huber
man said.
The Stanford Blood Center supplies Stanford
Hospital as well as the Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren s Hospital, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation
and El Carnino Hospital in Mountain View.
The blood center conducts 60 mobile blood drives
on the Stanford campus during fall, winter, and
spring quarters, Huberman said. None are scheduled
for the summer.
"We usually do not plan any drives in summer be
cause there are fewer students on campus," Huber
man said.
The blood center will he conducting a blood drive
on Wednesday at Stanford University Hospital from
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; they hope to increase supplies be
fore the July Fourth weekend.
The Blood Center's regular donation hours are
noon to 7:30 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thurs
days, and 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fri
days. The blood center is located at HOO Welch Road
near Stanford Hospital.
