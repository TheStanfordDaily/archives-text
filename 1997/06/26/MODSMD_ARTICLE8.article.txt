## Knight nabbed with 16th pick 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Brevin Knight, Stanford's career leader in as
sists and steals, fell to the 16th overall pick in the
NBA draft yesterday in Charlotte, N.C. The
Cleveland Cavaliers used the second of their
first-round picks to nah the recent graduate, who
had lasted until the 16th selection mostly due to
concerns about his 5-foot-9, 172-pound frame.
Knight bolsters a crowded backcourt for coach
Mike Fratello, who currently lines up All-Star
Terrell Brandon and Bobby Sura at point guard
and the 13th pick, Derek Anderson of Kentucky,
at shooting guard. Knight will have to battle for
minutes, but Sura could be moved to the 2-guard
and Brandon has been the subject of several
trade rumors.
Knight, the Frances Pomeroy Naismith
Award winner in 1997 as the nation's best play
er under 6 feet, became the first Stanford player
in five years to be drafted, following Adam Keefe,
Class of '92. He feels comfortable making the ad
justment to Fratello.
"His style is similar to the style I came from,"
Knight said on TNT. Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery "is an excellent X's and O's guy and so is
coach Fratello."
Cleveland has employed the most deliberate
offense in recent NMA history, milking the shot
clock and making little use of the transition
game. Most observers feel Knight's greatest
strength is his ability to push the ball up the floor
and penetrate in the open floor — not a current
facet of the Cavalier offense. Knight said he can
play within the structure of the Cleveland attack
but can add an up-tempo element as well.
Knight was the first player from a Pacific 10
Conference school to be selected, beating out
Pac-10 player of the year Ed Cray, a swingman
from California. San Jose States Olivier
Saint-Jean was the first pick from a Bay Area
school, going with the 11th selection to the
Sacramento Kings.
