# Third time's a charm
## Stanford wins the Sears Cup 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Outsiders have marveled at the many sides of
Stanford athletics for years. On June 17, Stanford
continued its near-monopoly of the Sears Directors'
Cup, awarded annually to the nation's best all-around
athletic program.
The Cardinal became the first university to shatter
the 1,000-point barrier in winning the award for the
third consecutive year in Division I. Stanford won an
NCAA-record six championships during the 1996-97
campaign but could have won the award anyway
without four of them due to outstanding campaigns
from several other sports, as Stanford placed 19 var
sity squads in the country's top 10.
"This is the perfect conclusion to an outstanding
year for the Stanford athletic program," said Athletic
Director Ted Leland. "It is truly an incredible feat to
win the Sears' Directors Cup three consecutive
years."
Stanford's 1,084 points blew away the only other
school to win a Sears Cup, North Carolina, which had
804. The Tar Heels edged UCLA by two points for sec
ond place. Teams are awarded 64 points for a first
place finish in each sport, 63 for second place and one
point for a 64th-place showing.
The Cardinal was ahead by less than 100 points
after winter sports were completed but used top-five
performances from baseball and women's golf and na
tional titles in men's and women's tennis and men's
volleyball to pull away. Stanford also finished tied for
11th in both men's and women's track and field and
won the school's first ICYRA sailing championship.
Leland accepted the award in Las Vegas at the
32nd annual convention of the National Association
of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. UC-Davis and
Williams College also repeated as winners of the Sears
Cup in Divisions II and 111, respectively, while Simon
Eraser (British Columbia) won for the NAIA.
Stanford's three Waterford Crystal trophies have a
combined value of more than $100,000. They are the
only all-sport awards in college athletics.
