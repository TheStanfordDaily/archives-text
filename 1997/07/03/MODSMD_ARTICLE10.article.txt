## Pick of the Week Everyone's working hard for their money in 'Profession' 
### 
The first time Shaw put "Mrs. War
ren's Profession" on the London stage,
the city witnessed an absolute scandal.
The play's sympathetic treatment of the
Mrs. Warren of the title, a prostitute and
pimp, caused the kind of critical and pub
lic outrage Oliver Stone & co. could only
dream of.
Hut that was a century ago. Playing
hooker may still land you in jail, but when
it comes to entertainment, there's noth
ing audiences today like more than a pret
ty woman. It's hard to imagine anyone
being offended by the content of this play
anymore, a work that never names exact
ly what Mrs. Warren's profession is, and
which makes sure to maintain the higher

moral ground.
Is this play dated? Yes, and director
Richard Seyd knows that. Seyd's straight
forward staging accepts Shaw's play for
what it is: A period piece deeply rooted in
its own historical moment. Seyd thankful
ly avoids updating the play and keeps all
the costumes and language accurate to
Victorian England.
The result is fascinating. Seyd trans
ports us back in time and encourages full
understanding of Mrs. Warren's situa
tion. The period setting ensures that the
audience maintains the "old" mind-set, so
that Mrs. Warren's (and her daughter's)
choices seem revolutionary, rather than
routine. Seyd will never let us forget that

this is no Happy Hooker. The women's
heavy costumes and their sometimes stilt
ed body language reminds us of the con
stricted lives that they lead.
But although the play's treatment of
prostitution betrays its age, the psycholo
gy of Shaw's writing is far from outdated.
The confrontations between Vivi Warren
(Maura Vincent) and Mrs. Warren (Con
cetta Tomei) are the high points of the
play. Those are electrifying moments that
work like revelations.
Aside from one moment of technical
wizardry, in which we catch the brief il
lusion of a train approaching during a set
change, "Mrs. Warren's Profession" is
shamelessly old-fashioned. It looks as if

it had been lifted, intact, from a produc
tion twenty, even fifty years earlier. But
that doesn't mean a lack of imagination
or inventiveness. It just means that
sometimes it's better to just do it
straight.
"Mrs. Warren's Profession" runs
through Sunday, July 13 at the Geary
Theater (405 Geary St.) in San Francisco.
It runs for 2 hours and 35 mnutes with
one intermission. Performances are Tues
day through Saturday at 8 p.m., and

p.m. Tickets cost $19-47.50. Call 749-2228
