# Action over the top but appeal limited in John Woo's thriller 'Face/Off'
## 
### 
"Face/Off" is so completely over the top in every way that
the odds of it being a film with mass appeal beyond the ac
tion bracket seem unbelievably low. However, with the ex
ception of a few horrifyingly cheesy moments, "Face/Off"
manages to be entertaining and intriguing as well as — for
the most part — in its own way, intelligent.
The basic plotline is a convoluted one, but essentially
breaks down to John Travolta beginning the film as griev
ing cop Sean Archer who is obsessed with hunting down
terrorist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) who has killed his
wee son. The chase goes beyond vendetta when Archer
must penetrate Troy's jailed terrorist group to find out

bomb secrets. The solution: a surgical procedure wherein
the two characters switch faces, and the actors switch
roles.
What this means is that both actors get the chance to play
the ludicrously wicked bad guy, and both tear up the scenery
doing it. It also means that each gets a chance to play the
other. Travolta, by dint of having more screen time as Troy,
gets to have the most fun. His Cageisms are hysterical, and
his is a gleeful terrorist who pokes fun at his own image —
and chin.
Cage has to spend a little too much time acting weepy and
distressed, although for good reason. As is the case all too

often these days, playing the villain is the only real way to
go (see Keaton, Kilmer, or Clooney for confirmation).
With two talented, Elvis-loving actors, and the ultimate
choreographer of slow-motion violence at the helm, John
Woo's third American outing is by far his best. The action se
quences become only slightly tedious, and are impressively
orchestrated. If some seriously dysfunctional familial rela
tions are overlooked, then "Face/Off" (the mantra of a funny
sequence involving Cage on hallucinogens) is an action
movie that almost avoids its pitfalls. Just be glad it doesn't
involve Las Vegas.
