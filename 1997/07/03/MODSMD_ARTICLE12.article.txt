# Another bad alien ressurection in Barry Sonnenfeld's eagerly awaited 'Men in Black'
##

Will Smith can be extremely funny, and
his performance in "Men in Black" is no ex
ception. Tommy Lee Jones can be droll, as
evidenced in"The Fugitive," and he is suc
cessfully droll here as well. Barry Sonnen
feld can be a fiendishly clever and pointedly
witty director — see the fantastic "Get
Shorty" — but there are only flashes of that
in "Men in Black." This is the problem: de
spite all the things it has going for it, "Men
in Black" never shows more than an occa

sional flash of Sonnenfeld's brilliant capac
ity for cleverness.
And, to put it plainly, this movie may be
the sign that Hollywood has officially OD'd
on the whole alien gig.
Yes, "Men in Black" is yet another alien
fiesta, timed right along with the furor over
Roswell. It features a variety of different
creatures, none of which are particularly
different or interesting. This is especially
disappointing when the alien shape of the

Nemesis creature is revealed to be a sort of
love-child between the Alien and the Ran
cor from "Return of the Jedi." It seems to
me that if the filmmakers were going to
make yet another creature fest that they
should have created something a little more
original.
Nevertheless, Jones and Smith are hav
ing a grand time cavorting and strutting
around as the Men In Black, a covert gov
ernment operation that monitors alien habi

tation of the planet Earth — and there is
quite a lot, as it turns out. The always under
appreciated Linda Fiorentino is along for
the ride (though she looks as stunning as
ever and has a sense of humor, we are sup
posed to believe that dead people are her
only friends), but is as underused as she is
under-appreciated. Sad, but true — charac
ter development has once again been sacri
ficed to the special effects god.
