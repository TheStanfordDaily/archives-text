## BrUCe Gibney: Campus viewpoint Dekes unfairly ousted 
### 
OF THE] MANY things one ex
pects Stanford to be, unso
phisticated, vindictive and
irrational are not qualities that
generally leap to mind. The Platon
ic academy, after all, is a place for
learning and growth, not a brutal,
gulag-minded stepparrent. But as
one might begin to suspect from the
absence of Plato and Socrates from
freshman reading lists, Stanford is
now hardly familiar with the idea of
the academy, much less anything
approaching its real execution — a
condition that explains the Univer
sity's otherwise inexplicable deci
sion to boot Delta Kappa Epsilonoff
campus.
A few weeks into Spring quarter,
a DKE pledge had too much to
drink at a fraternity event. Frat
pledges overindulging is, of course,
not unusual. What was unusual
was that this particular pledge
went to the hospital. The Universi
ty, recognizing an opportunity to
eliminate yet another fraternity,
leapt into action.
The whole matter was forward
ed to the Greek Judicial Hoard,
which recommended that DKE be
plactKl on extended probation, pay a
fine, and perform community ser
vice. The finding was not particu
larly surprising since I)KE had a
good reputation with the Universi
ty and because other fraternities
guilty of similar indiscretions re
ceived similar punishments. What
was unusual is that less than eigh
teen hours before the quarter was
scheduled to end, long after the
Draw and even after some mem
bers had gone home, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais summarily evict
ed the Dekes from the house.
The decision was a bad one for a
number of reasons. It was a bad de
cision because it all but ignored t he
advice of students and faculty. It
as a bad decision because it will
continue to adversly impact alumni
r Nations. Hut it was a bad decision
most importantly because DKE's
punishment did not fit the crime.
While it is clear that something un
fortunate transpired, it is in no way
clear that the University should
have evicted a fraternity from its
house, saddled it with virtually un
attainable criteria for winning the
house back, in the process effective
ly destroying the fraternity and
condemning the seniors to an in
convenient and expensive life off
campus. The decision reeked of in
appropriate vengance coupled with
rank hypocrisy. The University has
asked for second, third and fourth
chances and gotten them, and so
why can't DKE?
The answer is that DKE is a fra
ternity and in the brave new world
the administration seeks to create,
there is no room for groups of young
men who may occasionally exercise
poor self-restraint. The administra
tion heatedly contends that it is not
out to destroy fraternities and that
its decision-making process in the
DKE matter was rational and rea
sonable. That, to be blunt, is a lie.

The University is clearly on the
warpath against fraternities. The
University has eliminated almost
half of the fraternities that were on
campus when this year's seniors
first came and for transgressions
which on other campuses would
have merited probation.
As for rational and reasonable,
the decision was anything but. The
dilatory dean informed DKE of his
decision hours before the members
were scheduled to leave. He had
weeks to deliberate. Wais disinge
nously answers that the decision
was tardy because he wanted to
take the time to carefully review it.
Given the almost unbelievably slip
shod document handed to the
Dekes, spite seems a more believ
able answer to the question of time.
The memo outlining the eviction
was riddled with errors from the
start. Wais, who has an education
degree from Harvard, couldn't even
manage to spell the fraternity presi
dent's name correctly in his saluta
tion. Hardly what one would expect
of a carefully considered decision
from a compassionate administra
tion, but exactly what you would ex
pect from a petty and cavalier one.
Wais didn't manage to get his facts
right either. Shockingly enough, the
exact facts concerning the pledge's
health, the ostensible reason for
DKE's eviction, were not correct.
Nor was Wais' performance in
the last minute conference any
more convincing. Although Wais
was comfortable relying on "prece
dent" as justification for his deci
sion, when pressed, the dean
couldn't explicitly name a single
case. He would, he said, "have to
look them up."
The DKE debacle stretches be
yond the confines of a single house.
It profoundly colors the way that
students will interact with the Uni
versity. Unless 1 am gravely mis
taken, the dean of students cannot
be taken at his word. He can't be
trusted. How are students sup
posed to behave in an academy
where rules are arbitrary and
where decisions are made not on
the criteria of logic and fact but
rather on the trend in political
opinion? It violates the very pur
pose of any kind of government, a
firm and reliable contract between
parties. That's a pretty basic idea,
but one which seems to have es
cape the administration.
If the University has any inten
tion of regaining the trust of its stu
dents, it might well begin by sign
ing a document with the Dekes for
mally outlining the criteria that the
fraternity will have to meet to re
gain its house, criteria to be evalu
ated by an independent group.
Then we might better know that
the Deke decision was merely bad,
not characteristic.
