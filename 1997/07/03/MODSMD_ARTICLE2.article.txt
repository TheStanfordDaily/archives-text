## Palo Alto City Council approves Sand Hill November referendum will ask voters to choose between Stanford's proposal and alternative 
### Bobby Chen Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto City Council voted on
Monday to approve an agreement with
Stanford on the University's proposed
Sand Hill Road Project.
But before work can begin on the pro
ject, Palo Alto residents will vote Nov. 4 on
Stanford's proposal and most likely an al
ternative proposal developed by Mid-
Peninsula Action for Tomorrow.
City Council members said Monday they
will acknowledge the public's opinion if the
alternative proposal is passed, but Stanford
Director of Government and Community
Relations Larry Horton said the University
will not accept MPACT's initiative.
Under the compromise finally agreed on
by Stanford and the city council, the Uni
versity would be permitted to build an
apartment complex on Ohlone Field next to
Sand Hill Road. Stanford would add 80,000
square feet to the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, widen Sand Hill Road to four lanes be
tween Santa Cruz Avenue and Arboretum
Road and connect Sand Hill to El Camino
Real.
The agreement would restrict the Uni
versity's development of a 103-acre area
south ofSand Hill Road until the year 2020.
Stanford would foot much of the $342
million that it will cost to carry out the pro
ject.
Concerns about increased traffic conges
tion and the destruction of open space have
prompted some to initiate a campaign for

alternatives.
MPACT, a group comprised of Palo Alto
and Menlo Park residents, is currently col
lecting signatures in order to ensure its al
ternative initiative is placed on the Novem
ber election ballot.
"The generation of trips [number of
times a car travels| is more than we should
be asking this neighborhood to absorb,"
said Kim Maxwell, a Palo Alto resident and
co-chair of MPACT.
Proponents of the approved deal believe
the addition of two lanes will serve to de
crease the gridlock. However, MPACT sees
the city's environmental impact report as a
more accurate predictor of how traffic con
gestion will respond to the road's expan
sion.
According to Maxwell, 53,000 to 54,000
trips are projected on an expanded four
lane Sand Hill Road, about twice the cur
rent number.
"If you've ever driven up there, you'll
see that the problem is only partly related
to the size of the road," he said. It's more
related to the intersection ofSand Hill and
Santa Cruz Avenue."
"A four-lane road won't help intersec
tion congestion," he added. "I liken it to
widening the esophagus when the stomach
can't digest and the mouth can't chew."
MPACT's initiative would force Stan
ford and Palo Alto to consider what the
group feels are more effective methods of
alleviating the traffic gridlock.
"We'd like to explore alternative traffic
management technologies — for example,

building parking structures or lots along
(Interstate) 280 and bussing people into
Stanford," Maxwell said.
Additionally, some residents foresee
problems with overexpansion of the shop
ping center. The mall's expansion is cur
rently limited to an additional 49,000
square feet, and supporters of the alternate
initiative want to retain that boundary.
Reginald Rice, a 40-year Menlo Park res
ident and a supporter of the approved
agreement, believes widening Sand Hill
Road would decrease the amount of com
muter traffic that currently detours
through residential areas and the Stanford
campus.
"Everyone living west of Santa Cruz Av
enue wants to go to El Camino," he said.
"In order to do that, we have to cut through
the neighborhoods."
"With the wider road, more cars will
take a major artery like Sand Hill instead of
residential streets," he said.
Palo Alto Mayor Joe Huber also sup
ports the approved agreement as a good
compromise that will solve many residen
tial traffic problems.
"I personally have thought that we
should have four lanes on Sand Hill, even if
nothing was ever built there," he said.
Huber asserted that part of the goal in
adding lanes to Sand Hill is to divert traffic
from neighborhood streets to larger roads
that are designed to handle more cars.
"If you pull traffic out of places not de
signed for through traffic and putting it on
a through Sand Hill (that connects to El

Camino), no one's going to complain," he
said.
He added that ideas similar to MPACT's
suggestion of shuttles between Stanford
and designated parking have been consid
ered before but have always presented in
herent problems.
"Years ago we talked about a shuttle sys
tem in a Palo Alto complex as something to
do around (Highway) 101," he recalled.
"But are you going to get out of your car?
That's the question you always have to
come back to."
The second half of MPACT's alternate
initiative concerns the preservation of
Ohlone Field, a 46-acre field adjacent to
San Francisquito Creek. Stanford current
ly has the right to develop the field into an
apartment complex, but MPACT wants
Palo Alto and the University to work out an
alternative housing site.
"We would like to see the field left as
open space," admitted Maxwell, "The ini
tiative insists that Palo Alto negotiate with
Stanford for retention of the field. We'd
like to work together to transfer the devel
oping rights and induce Stanford to move
the housing component of the project."
Maxwell emphasized that the goal of
MPACT is not to impede the progress of
land development but to work toward al
ternatives to automobile reliance and the
destruction of open space.
"We have reached the end of this centu
ry and become wedded to the automobile,"
he added. "We must go to a divorce or at
least a partial separation."
