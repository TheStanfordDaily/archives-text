# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## Reflections from a synthetic throne 
### 
IT'S LATE SATURDAY
evening, and I'm sitting in the
most comfortable seat in the
world. It doesn't look like anything
special: a hard, red, plastic chair
with a sticky seat, one of about
twenty exact copies strung in a row,
none of which have armrests. But
as I lock my fingers behind my head
and lean back, my body slowly dis
solving into the tiny plastic
grooves, I think there is no place in
the world I would rather be sitting.
I look down from my synthetic
throne. Two rows behind me, a
man is explaining the intricacies of
batting to his small grandson. Just
to my right, three boys in their
early teens are arguing over foul
balls and ice cream. A blue-haired
woman down the stairs is bent in
tently on her scorecard.
I take a deep breath of warm
desert air. It's a sweet smell, a mix
of hot dogs and spilled beer and
sage. The sun is setting behind me,
casting a long shadow that is slow
ly consuming the field. I hear a
crack, then a cheer, then feel my
body shake as several hundred feet
pound the suprisingly pliable alu
minum benches beneath me.
I'm 19 years old and I'm a week
into my first attempt at true inde
pendence. I've left my home in Ore
gon, my school in California and my
friends everywhere to take a sum
mer internship writing sports for a
daily newspaper.
In Idaho.
Look at me. I'm in. . .Idaho.
The transition has been diffi
cult. It seems like I've been leaving
a lot lately, first mv friends at Stan

ford two weeks ago, then my
friends and family in McMinnville
last week. When I finally arrived
somewhere, in Boise on a hot Sun
day afternoon, I soon found myself
wishing that it, too, could be just
another stop on the line this sum
mer. After ail, it was missing every
thing that I had left.
Everything that is, except God.
And baseball.
i knew that God was with me
the whole time, but it took me a
while to realize that baseball was
there for me as well. This, I think, is
fairly strange, since I've spent the
last six days at Memorial Stadium
writing about the Boise Hawks
class "A" minor-league baseball
team. I really haven't had any other
assignments in my first week at the
Idaho Statesman. Baseball is my
job, and right now, my job is my life.
But it wasn't until I came back to
the ballpark tonight and experi
enced the game from the third-base
grandstand that I saw baseball as
my friend.
I'm lonely here. That's why I
came to the game on my night off.
And that's why I'm sitting alone
high above the home dugout, ab
sorbed in the eighth-inning action
of a blowout. I'm thinking about
my loneliness, and about the cor
rection box that ran in this morn
ing's paper due to an error in one of
my stories. And I'm not happy.
Something changes, though,
when I hear the young boy exclaim,
"He hit it, Grandpa! He hit it!" For
a second, I'm not at the game any
more. I'm at the kitchen table with
my father, being taught to read be

cause he's sick of finding the
Dodgers score in the newspaper for
me. I'm in the front yard playing
catch with my mother a year or two
before she quit playing because I
was too competitive. I'm in my bed
room with my brother, moving
stuffed animals around an orange
carpet infield.
I'm 19 again, back at the game,
and I realize that I may be lonely,
but I am not alone. I have a sum
mer of baseball ahead of me — a
chance to get back in touch with the
game I grew up with. In a larger
sense, it's a chance to pull my past
into my present. It's a time to com
mune with God, with baseball, with
myself.
One of the middle-schoolers is
pleading with his father. "Look
Dad, the Hawks are winning by
seven," he says. "They won by
seven last time we were here. If we
come every night, they'll never
lose."
The dad takes a long drink of his
Miller Lite. "I can only take one
Hawks game a week," he replies.
"You'd have to pay me to come to
all of them."
I laugh out loud, then settle back
into the world's most comfortable
chair.
I can't believe they're paying me
to watch baseball.
