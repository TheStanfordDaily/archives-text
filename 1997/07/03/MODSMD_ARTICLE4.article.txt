Robert Kinnally, current dean of admissions at
Sarah Lawrence College in New York, has been
named dean of undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid at Stanford.
He replaces James Montoya, who this week began
work as vice provost for student affairs. Kinnally will
start in September.
"I'm very excited about Bob's coming, and I think
he's going to do a great job for us," said Provost Con
doleezza Rice, who along with Montoya and Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper formed the committee
that made the decision.

Kinnally earned a bachelor's in English from Man
hattan College in 1982 and a master's in English and
American literature from New York University in 1987.
He has served in the admissions offices of the Universi
ty of Bridgeport in Connecticut, the State University of
New York-Purchase and Pace University. He was also
the director of financial aid at Sarah I^awrence.
Kinnally's background in financial aid was impor
tant to the decision committee, Rice said. The com
mittee chose from among six finalists selected by a
search committee earlier this year.
At Stanford, the offices of financial aid and admis
sions are merged, and his strong background in each
was impressive, Rice said.
