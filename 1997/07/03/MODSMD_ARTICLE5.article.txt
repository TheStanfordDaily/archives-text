# Stanford's area code changing
## 
### Jason Engleman 
Stanford's area code will
change to 650 on August 2 as
most of the Peninsula is removed
from an overcrowded 415 area
code. Pacific Bell has announced.
That means people attempting
to reach any Stanford telephone
— whether prospective students
looking for applications, employ
ers trying to hire students, or
your parents calling to check up
on you — soon will not be able to
reach the campus by dialing its
longtime 415 numbers.
Although the new area code
will go into effect on Aug. 2, a pe
riod of what Pacific Bell calls
"permissive dialing" will occur

until Feb. 28. During that time,
the 415 area code will continue to
work. After Feb. 28, however,
people dialing the 415 area code
will hear a message telling them
to use the 650 area code. Finally,
after five or six months, if your
friend in New York uses the 415
area code to reach you, he'll prob
ably end up talking to someone in
San Francisco.
The area code change must be
made, according to Maureen
Trimm, assistant director of
Stanford's Communication Ser
vices, because "the 415 area code
is running out of numbers."
As the Bay Area's population
balloons, the number of people
with second or third telephone

lines, modems, pagers, faxes and
other communication devices is
skyrocketing, Trimm said.
While San Francisco, Marin
County and some sections of Daly
City and Brisbane will keep the
415 area code, cities including
Burlingame, Half Moon Bay, Los
Altos, Menlo Park, Mountain
View, Pacifica, Palo Alto, Red
wood City, San Carlos and San
Mateo will join Stanford in the
new 650 area code. As a result,
while calls between Palo Alto and
San Francisco currently require
only a seven-digit number, after
August 2 the area code must be
dialed as well.
