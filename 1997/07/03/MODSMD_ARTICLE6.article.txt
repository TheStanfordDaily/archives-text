# Changing hands
## Britain returns Hong Kong to China after 156 years 
### 
HONG KONG (AP) — Torn between excitement
and anxiety, Hong Kong shed its 156-year-old colo
nial mantle today and rejoined China, its original
master and now the pilot of its course to the future.
"I have relinquished the administration of this
government. God Save the Queen," said a cable from
Gov. Chris Patten to London, sent at midnight as
sovereignty changed.
With a simple ceremony, the playing of both coun
tries' national anthems and a switch of flags, Hong
Kong was passed from the dwindling British Empire
to the world's most populous nation.
The Chinese flag and Hong Kong's new flag fin
ished their ascent up the flagpole eight seconds after
midnight.
In a moment, the territory's 6.3 million people
ceased to be British subjects and became citizens of a
new entity called the Special Administrative Region
of Hong Kong.
"China will tonight take responsibility for a place
and a people which matter greatly to us all," Prince
Charles said in a speech shortly before the Union
Jack came down before a global array of VIPs gath
ered in a hall overlooking Hong Kong harbor.
"We shall not forget you, and we shall watch with
the closest interest as you embark on this new era of
your remarkable history."
Chinese President Jiang Zemin called the han
dover "a victory for the universal cause of peace and
justice."
He said, "July 1, 1997, will go down in the annals
of history as a day that merits eternal memory — the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland."
As "God Save the Queen" played, Charles, heir to
the British throne, watched with a dejected expres
sion and a far-off look in his eye as the Union Jack de
scended.
Patten was less circumspect: He looked downright
sullen and spent just seconds in a post-ceremony
handshake gathering before turning on his heel and
walking off.
On the Chinese side, only Premier Li Peng smiled
slightly during the ceremony.
Shortly afterward, Charles, Patten and his family,
and others in the British delegation boarded the
royal yacht Britannia in Hong Kong harbor and
sailed away. Chinese and British well-wishers
reached out across a police barrier to hug Patten.
The brief handover observances at Hong Kong's
new convention center followed a day of parades,
speeches, performances and banquets, followed by a

night sky bursting with British fireworks over Victo
ria Harbor. Rain-drenched spectators joined bag
pipers in a spirited, emotional rendition of "Auld
Lang Syne."
Early Tuesday, 21 democratically elected lawmak
ers who lost their jobs under the new government —
and were replaced by lawmakers selected by China —
protested from the balcony of their old legislature.
"We are proud to be Chinese, but we also ask this
question: Why must Chinese leaders take away our
democracy?" Martin Lee, the leader of the Democra
tic Party, told about 1,000 supporters below.
"We shall return!" the former legislators shouted
to the cheering crowd.
Several pro-democracy rallies were held in Hong
Kong before the midnight handover, and most re
mained small and peaceful.
Just before the handover ceremony at the con
vention center, however, members of the April 5 Ac
tion Group, a coalition of Chinese activists, briefly
blocked the road. Police holding hands surrounded
them and moved them into an approved protest
area.
Jiang, the first Communist Chinese president to
visit Hong Kong, arrived only a few hours before the
day's festivities began. Before leaving Beijing, he re
newed pledges to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms —
including its freewheeling capitalism.
As Jiang flew into the airport, an exhausted-look
ing Patten moved out of Government House, taking
with him the British flag that used to fly over the of
ficial residence.
He bit his lip and swallowed hard as the band
played "God Save the Queen."
Later, at Britain's open-air sunset farewell cere
mony, Patten paid emotional tribute to the colony he
governed for five years. "I have no doubt that with
people here holding onto these values which they
cherish, Hong Kong's star will continue to climb," he
said.
China swiftly asserted its sovereignty with the ad
vance contingent of 509 troops moving across the
border from the city of Shenzhen. Early Tuesday,
4,000 People's Liberation Army troops were to arrive
in Hong Kong by ships, helicopters and armored ve
hicles.
China regards the return of its territory as a glo
rious event, and Beijing held massive celebrations.
Chinese streamed by the tens of thousands to
Tiananmen Square to view a clock counting the sec
onds to the midnight handover.

may pose a threat to their liberties.
