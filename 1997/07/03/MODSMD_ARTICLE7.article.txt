# Students get a head start on those millions

They started programming in BASIC on an
cient Apple lie's that are now collecting dust in
their basements. Now, in the heart of Silicon
Valley, they are beginning to make a profit off
of their own software.
They are still full-time students.
Many computer science students are re
quired to develop programs for their classes,
but a few go on to market their products and
sell them to users.
"It beats flipping burgers," said Tom Foun
tain, a computer science coterminal student.
As a freshman, Adam Tow, a recent symbol
ic systems graduate, began using the Newton, a
handheld version of the Macintosh. The New
ton was designed to recognize handwriting in
stead of requiring the user to type all text.
His sophomore year, Tow created a Stan
ford map for the Newton which could scroll
and find different buildings on campus for the
user.
That February, things really started to pick
up for Tow. He found that the sound of the
Newton utility Alarm Clock was very ineffec
tive, so he did something to change it. That
summer, he released his own version of Alarm
Clock to the public.

Since the success of Alarm Clock, Tow has
developed numerous applications for the New
ton, including a program that improves New
ton's handwriting recognition called Write T
here and one that allows users to compose
HTML documents called nHTML.
"Because my senior year was a little more
lax, I was able to focus a little more on pro
gramming," Tow said.
While his fellow programmers may spend
their summers coding for a larger company,
Tow decided early on that he did not want to
take that path.
"You're working for someone else. You're
trading time for money. It's also interesting to
building something from nothing," he said.
And build it he has. Since he released his
product line, Tow's company, Foundation Sys
tems, has acquired over 400 customers in 20
different countries.
But don't think he's rolling in the dough
yet. "For the most part, developers are strug
gling," he said.
Tow said that his parents, who ran a restau
rant while they both held other full-time jobs,
instilled the entrepreneurial drive in him.
"There were times when I was depressed as
hell," Tow said. "Building a business is hard.
Not everyone is meant to build their own husi
ness. You have to have a reason, a vehicle to do

it and you have to work hard."
Many Stanford students develop and mar
ket software, just not aH intensely as Tow.
Fountain was part of a team that developed
an Internet shopping software package for
their senior project. Four members of the team
are now in the process of trying to market the
package.
However, this is just a side project for Foun
tain, who has run his own computer consulting
firm since 1993. He currently has about 25 ac
tive clients in southern California and his
home, Colorado.
"All of my clients know that I'm a student
first," he said.
This business has been moderately prof
itable for Fountain, but for computer science
coterm Jason Dishlip, developing software htm
not been a huge money-maker.
"It's mostly stuff' I wouldn't necessarily
sell," Dishlip said. "I spend a lot of time talking
and philosophizing about it."
He has developed a chat program to keep in
touch with his friends across the country, but
added a feature that also allows participants to
draw.
Tow and other small developers are trying
to get started and may survive off a meager in
come for a while, but they just consider it an
occupational hazard.
