## Coaching flurry hits lacrosse, water polo Women's sports get new head coaches while Patrick leaves volleyball for Tennessee 
### Allison Otto Editorial staff 
In a hectic five-day span, the Cardinal
gained two head coaches and lost an assis
tant to continue a tumultous offseason.
Former Stanford Ail-American and cur
rent U.S. national team assistant coach
John Tanner has been named the new
head coach for the women's water polo
team, while former assistant Heidi Connor
was promoted to interim women's lacrosse
head coach.
Roh Patrick, who earned two NCAA
championship rings at Stanford, left to be
come head coach at Tennessee.
Water polo gets familiar face
Tanner's designation was announced
Friday by Athletic Director Ted Leland. He
replaces Ben Quittner, who guided the
team to a fourth-place national finish and
31-10 record in its second year as a varsity
sport.
"We are very excited about John's re
turn to Stanford," Leland said. "He will be
a wonderful addition to our coaching
staff."
Tanner comes back to The Farm after a
12-year stay at Pacific, where he served as
the aquatics director and head men's
water polo and swimming coach. Prior to
that, he served as the Stanford men's
water polo assistant to Dante Dettamanti
in 19H4.
Tanner graduated in 1982 with a degree
in political science. He expressed enthusi
asm about "being a part of the country's
premier athletic department."
"I am very much looking forward to
working with the women's water polo
team," Tanner said.

The Tiger men won 13 and lost 13
games last year, earning a fourth-place
showing in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and sixth place in the national
polls. UOP lost 7-3, 13-11 and 11-7 in its
three games with the Cardinal.
Tanner has worked under Leland be
fore. Prior to Leland's appointment as
Stanford athletic director in 1991, Leland
held the same position at his alma mater,
UOP, for three years.
Tanner also joins five other Cardinal
coaches who earned degrees from Stanford
â€” Dick Gould (Class of'6o, men's tennis),
Mark Marquess ('69, baseball), Chris Hor
pel ('75, wrestling), Ruben Nieves ('Bl,
men's volleyball) and Sheryl Johnson ('Bl
masters, field hockey).
Connor's promotion signals new era
Leland named Connor the interim Stan
ford women's lacrosse head coach yester
day. Connor, who served as assistant coach
last season, replaces Kay Cowperthwait,
who took a position at Amherst.

"We are thrilled that
Heidi will remain on
staff," Leland said. "She
represents what we look
for in a head coach."
Connor, a 1995 gradu
ate of Villanova, was a
four-time letterwinner
with the Wildcats, a team
captain during her se
nior year and the squad's
MVP. Prior to joining the

Stanford staff, she served as the women's
lacrosse coach at Conestoga High School in
Pennsylvania in 1996.
The Cardinal completed the 1997 sea
son with a 12-11 record although most of

the players were newcomers or walkons.
Many players quit after the 1996 season
and were unhappy with the coaching of
Cowperthwait. She remained, however,
and led the makeshift squad to a better
than-.500 season in 1997, her fifth season
as Cardinal head coach and the third year
as a varsity team.
"I want to take this program to the next
level," Connor said. "We have a lot of great
players, and I am looking forward to con
tinuing to work with them this next sea
son."
Connor will have a young nucleus of
players to build around. Thirteen of the
squad's 16 members were freshmen in
1997, including leading scorer Hedy Born.
Connor becomes the third new women's
coach hired at Stanford in the past 17 days,
joining Tanner and women's gymnastics
coach Mark Cook. She is Stanford's youngest
varsity head coach by a wide margin.
Patrick gets his big shot in Knoxville
On Saturday, Patrick was named the
new head volleyball coach at Tennessee by
Lady Vol women's athletic director Joan
Cronan. Patrick will fill the position im
mediately, replacing new national team as
sistant coach Julie Hermann.
"I am extremely excited about the oppor
tunity to coach at Tennessee," Patrick said.
"I plan to work very hard and hopefully
bring in some top-caliber players, and I look
forward to meeting with the team right
away. I feel this is a tremendous chance to
put Tennessee volleyball on the map."
Patrick signed a three-year contract
with a base salary of $50,000 per season
and will become the sixth head coach in
Tennessee volleyball history.
He spent the last three seasons with Stan

ford as the Cardinal went 92-6 and won two
NCAA championships, including last Decem
ber's victory over Hawaii in the title match.
"We have just completed a thorough
and exhaustive search to hire the right
person with the ability to take us to the

next level," Cronan said.
"I am excited about Rob
Patrick and the qualifica
tions he brings to the pro
gram."
Patrick leaves the odds
on favorite to repeat as
NCAA champion to in
herit a Lady Vol squad
trying to become nation
ally competitive and a

force in the Southeastern Conference.
Tennessee improved from a dismal 7-25
record in 1995 to a 17-16 mark in 1996.
Tennessee was 6-8 in the SEC last year
with a young squad and averaged fewer
than 300 fans per match.
While Patrick has never been a head
coach at the collegiate level, he has enjoyed
success with national club teams as a play
er and coach. The Miami (Ohio) graduate
worked as head coach of the South Bay
Volleyball Club's second 18-and-under
team and also assisted with the top team.
As a player, his coed teams won national ti
tles in 1990 and 1992.
Patrick's departure leaves Stanford
with just two members on its coaching
staff. Head coach Don Shaw is still assisted
by eight-year sidekick Denise Corlett.
Stanford has just seven weeks to fill the
vacancy before the beginning of the regu
lar season. Volleyball will kick off the
1997-98 athletic year for the Cardinal with
the State Farm / NACWAA tournament
August 22-23 at Maples Pavilion.
