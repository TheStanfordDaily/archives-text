# Wideman second in WNBA assists
## Ticket manager Wilder dies at 33 after bout with cancer 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
While her shooting numbers haven't
been up to par through two weeks of
the inaugural WNBA season, Stanford
alumna Jamila Wideman has lived up
to the hype that surrounds the third
ever draft pick.
The 5-foot-6 point guard skyrocket
ed to high draft status on the heels of a
dominant NCAA tournament and
ranks second in the league in assists
with 5.6 per game through five contests
for the Los Angeles Sparks. On the
down side, she has turned the ball over
2.6 times per game and shot just 31
percent from the floor.
"It's a lot different from college,"
Wideman said in a live Internet chat
yesterday."The players are much big
ger, much better, much faster and
much quicker. And there's five of them
who are exceptional" on the floor at
one time.
Wideman has teamed with Penny
Toler to give the Sparks one of the
quickest and most formidable back
courts in the league. Former USC foe
Lisa Leslie, the league's second-leading

scorer, has been the primary recipient
of Wideman's passes.
Despite their obvious talent, the
Sparks' youth and relative lack of size
has dropped them to 2-3. However, Los
Angeles has played better as of late,
and the Sparks will try to move above
the .500 mark on national television
this week at the Cleveland Rockers
(today at 4:30 p.m. on ESPN) and at
the Charlotte Sting (Saturday at 11
a.m. on NBC).
Wilder dies after fighting cancer
After 12 years in the ticket office,
Shelly Wilder had become a fixture in
the Department of Athletics. The Stan
ford ticket manager died .June 21 after
battling cancer, and department per
sonnel quickly praised Wilder for her
contributions to Stanford.
"Shelly's loss is felt through the en
tire department," said Cheryl Levick,
senior associate athletic director. "She
was very special, and I really admired
the courage Shelley showed through
her battle."
She was the primary ticket manager
for women's volleyball and basketball,
but Wilder. 33, had served her alma

mater in several other capacities since
earning a degree in human biology in
1985. She helped coordinate the Cen
tennial Celebration and served as
events and operations manager from
1989-91.
"We are truly saddened by the loss of
Shelley," said Director of Tickets Konn
Rauschenbach. "She has changed us,
not just because she has left but be
cause she touched us all."
She is survived by partner C.J.
Greene, parents John Wilder and Car
olyn Merovick and siblings Tori,
Christie and Sean Wilder.
A memorial service will take place

ward a memorial scholarship in her
name.
