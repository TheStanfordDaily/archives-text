## A
						Weekend Of Kind Veggie Fatty Organic Music: The
						High Sierra Music Festival 
### 
The High Sierra Music Festival played
from July 3-6 in Bear Valley in the Califor
nia Sierra Nevada mountains. The per
formers for all four days were extremely
numerous, including acts like the Radia
tors, Hooker T., Leftover Salmon, Sweet
Virginia, Michelle Shocked, Tony Furtado,
and a whole host of others.
I got up to the festival on the morning of
Friday, July 4. There were people camping
everywhere — almost literally. Apparently,
people not wishing to stay up very late
camped farther from the multiple stages;
obviously, I was camped pretty darn close
to the stages.
There were two primary stages: a main
stage and a smaller one. Both were con
stantly in use up until about 10:00 PM,
when they would close down, and a third
stage — the "Big Top" — would open for a
"special" show, running from about 11 to 2.
This "Big Top" show cost an extra $8 to at
tend, and tickets for it had to be purchased
that morning inside the main stage area.
The first act that I saw was Peter
Rowan with Jim Campilongo and the Ten
Gallon Cats, on the main stage. Jim and
the Cats are a four-piece band with a line
up of electric guitar, pedal-steel guitar,
bass and drums, and they are well worth
seeing. They are a valuable local musical
resource here in the Bay area and play in
northern California often. They started off
by ripping two or three of their own tunes,
with a groovy, quirky country-jazz rock
sound.
The venerable Peter Rowan then came
out for a good, long while and played some
of his own music with Jim and the Cats as
his backing band. I have to admit that this
did not make much sense to me, since Peter
Rowan was playing much more traditional
country-bluegrass music that clashed with

the Cats' meow. But both Jim Campilongo
and Peter Rowan were received very well
by the gracious crowd.
That night saw the appearance of
Medeski, Martin and Wood, also on the
main stage. They are a three-piece jazz
band, consisting of keys (lots of Hammond
B-3 organ), bass and drums. They put on a
very strong show, both collectively and in
dividually. If you weren't looking at the
stage, you could have easily believed that
more than three people were up there mak
ing all that sound. Their funky rhythms
and strong grooves were also a nice con
trast to the heavy country and bluegrass
rhythms that had pervaded almost every
other group that day.
Medeski, Martin and Wood's transitions
between songs were also notable. These
transitions felt random, except that each
member of the band was right there when
the next tune reared its head - seemingly
out of nowhere! Each member also took
time for an extended solo, with the other
two members dropping out. Of particular
note was the bass solo, played by Wood on
an upright bass. He slapped the hell out of
that bass, and it was absolutely delightful.
String Cheese Incident played eclectic
world-country rock on the main stage on

the second day. In general, they had a
strong set. However, I wasn't as impressed
with them as I would have liked to have
been. Their music was inconsistent, their
grooves were too subdued and many of the
guitar solos seemed unusually Phish-y.
However, they were excellent day-time,
wandering-about-t he-main-stage-area
music, and there was definitely no one else
at the festival like them.
Other acts that we saw that day includ
ed Manna (a 3-piece acoustic trance band
from Seattle), Hypnotic Clambake (a large
klezmer-bluegrass band from the East
Coast), the Chazzcats (an excellent 6-piece
swing-country band), the Radiators ("a
poor man's Little Feat" from New Orleans,
in the words of my friend Fungus),
Michelle Shocked, Artis the Spoonman
(playing with Leftover Salmon's opening
band), and Leftover Salmon.
Hypnotic Clambake, playing on the
small stage, was fantastic. Their combina
tion of klezmer, bluegrass, and whatever
else they happened to throw in was a mar
velously good time. At one point, they got
the entire audience holding hands in a
giant circle and, well, encircling, rapidly.
This broke down in the greatest free-for
all dancing that I have had the opportuni
ty of being a part of. Dust flying every
where, quick bluegrass beats coming at us,
everyone hooting and hollering - High
Sierra definitely has not seen the last of
this band.
Michelle Shocked turned out to be an
other highlight of the weekend. She had a
scaled down band with just a bassist, a
drummer and her on electric guitar.
Michelle hit the blues pretty hard during
her set, and her guitar screeched out some
pretty crazy sounds. She had a very strong
stage presence, and used it well as she got

serious on us one or two times. That said
and done, her next comment was, "Well,
I've pretty much said all that I came here
to say - now it's time for mindless par
tyin'!" The next song included an extend
ed solo by her, after which Michelle said,
"If Jerry Garcia can do all that noodly shit,
then so can I!" Cheering ensued, and she
rocked out for a few more tunes.
That night Leftover Salmon played at
the Big Top. The five-piece guitar, man
dolin, banjo, bass and drums band was in
fine form. The mandolin player started off
the set with some amazing mandolin work,
playing much faster than humans seem to
have been made to play music. The banjo
player seemed to be annoyed by the Big
Top situation, however; throughout the
evening, he made several comments about
how the "people didn't come to see us goof
around," and such. He seemed to be frus
trated by the fact that so many people had
been turned away, since only a set number
of tickets for the Big Top were available.
Jim Page, an acoustic guitarist and
rhyming man, then came out for a few
tunes, after which Leftover Salmon played
some more on their own. We ended up
leaving before the show ended, but 1 heard
later that Peter Rowan came out after that
to play a few tunes with Salmon. I can nei
ther confirm nor deny that report, since it
was delivered by a character of question
able consciousness.
The High Sierra Music Festival was a
great festival — nothing but music all the
way through. Even many of the audience
members were good musicians; if you didn't
want to see a major band play, then you al
ways had the option of wandering through
the camps and seeing what was going on at
any given moment. Which was much more
than you would have been able to take in,
anyway! The Festival was really worth the
trek, and there's a good chance that I'll be
going back next year. So should you!
