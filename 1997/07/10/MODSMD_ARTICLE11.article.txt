## Mike Oldfield Voyager 
### 
Before last Saturday, I had
never heard of Mike Oldfield. Now
I'm glad that 1 happened to pick up
his latest album "Voyager" out of
the stack of discs available for re
view this week. During further re
search, I found it hard to fathom
that I had never even heard a men
tion of this well- established com
poser, who has been developing his
t i\vn niche in a genre he self-defines
as "symphonic rock".
in case some of you are in the
dark about him just as much as 1
was, Mike Oldfield was born in
Kngland in 1954 to Irish and Eng
lish parents, and began playing the
guitar at an early age. His passion
for the guitar took him to composi
tion and professional accompani
ment at 13 years old, His first
major composition, "Tubular
Bells,'' was completed in 1973.
Most of the instruments in this
first 'rock and roll concerto' were
played by Oldfield himself and are
overdubs on the album.
After "Tubular Bells," Old
fi Id led a very secluded life while
the British pop world was turned
upside-down by the arrival of punk
nick. Shut away in a country re
treat. the impact of punk passed
< )ldfield by. Asked in a 1977 by an
interviewer for his thoughts on the
< xplosion of punk, he responded,
Punk rock? I've never heard of
it Oldfield's compositions span
nearly two decades in which studio
iikl musical technology have un
dergone sweeping changes. He de
bribes himself as an "ambassador
for instrumental music" though
Ins music bears little resemblance
to the New Age style that has func
tionally demolished the credibility

of the long instrumental format.
Oldfield's Irish heritage is evi
dent on "Voyager." His goal for the
work was to "capture the spirit of a
mythological world and try to
evoke the legends of the ancient
Celts" (liner notes). While listening
to the track "Celtic Rain" I was ac
tually asked if 1 was listening to
Enva. Much of Voyager has a very
sedate, Enya-esque feel, but de
parts from it in greater musical
complexity and its more symphon
ic complexity.
Although it is one of Oldfield's
few collections of short works,
"Voyager" still retains the continu
ous emotion of a symphonic piece.
The track "Mont St. Michael," the
denoument of "Voyager," is by far
the most profound statement on
the album. Culminating in an orgy
of traditional, symphonic and Irish
folk instruments, "Mont St.
Michael" is a pleasantly surprising
end to a collection which exudes in
tense compositional creativity, yet
lacks the drive and pizazz necessary
to push me to the edge of my seat.
