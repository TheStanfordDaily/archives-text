## Scott Peterson Caracas in my mind 
### 
WELL, IT SEEMED like I
hud just carted all my
Stanford moving boxes
home when suddenly I was distill
ing them into two suitcases and fly
ing off to begin a nine-week intern
ship in Caracas, Venezuela.
My internship is with Church
Resource Ministries, an interna
tional non-denominational Protes
tant missions organization based in
Anaheim, Calif. I realize that this
may not sit well with some mem
bers of Stanford's free-thinking
community, but it's the work I feel
call**! to do.
Although I won't be earning much
money, 1 hope to change lives by
building close personal relationships.
I have spent three weeks teaching
English in Caracas each of the past
two summers, so I will be able to con
tinue some relationships this year
that I have begun in the past.
Some pertinent answers to
prominent questions: Caracas is
the capital of Venezuela and is lo
cated in the north of this tropical
South American country. Though
the people speak Spanish, they do
not eat tacos and enchiladas except
in Mexican restaurants.
About 40 percent of the coun
try's inhabitants live in this city of
five million, which makes it a pret
ty crowded place. Over the past cou
ple years I've become accustomed
to the Metro subway system, which
is an easy if not always quick way to
navigate the city. Caracas is also a
t rue world-class city, with residents
from all over the globe and all the
modern conveniences like electrici
ty and running water. This didn't
surprise me on my first visit, but
I've met some norteamericanos
who are convinced that everything
south of San Diego must be a sort of
Third World wasteland.
Actually one of the best parts of
spending time here is simply learn
ing about a place different from my
home. Stanford students talk about
expanding their horizons, but mov
ing from Orange County to Palo
Alto was not nearly as eye-opening
as spending a few weeks in a foreign
country. Walking through the city,
registering for Spanish classes, I've
learned a lot about Venezuelans.
On (he surface, 1 noticed how effi
ciently traffic moves. For example,
no one stops unless they must.
Whoever gets a bumper in the in
tersection first has the right of way.
Crossing the street is more fun
because you can jaywalk even right
in front of cops. It's best to time
your steps to avoid inconveniencing
the autos, but if your judgment is
off, you can just put up your hand
casually and the cars will slow
down for you.
More importantly, though. I've
learned a little about a beautiful as
pect of Latin culture. In Venezuela,
people always come first.
Though not forcibly memorized
like a school lesson or acquired
through some kind of 12-step pro
gram, this notion permeates
Venezuelan life.

this is not to say that you
won't encounter the occasional
rude clerk or pushy subway travel
er, it's a definite indication that
friendships are usually genuine
and lasting, families large and lov
ing, conversations long and gifts
generous.
Learning about the Venezuelan
emphasis on people has also taught
me a lot about myself. While here, I
get to stay with two familias verie
zolanas. Living with people who are
hospitable often beyond their
means has been humbling.
Last weekend was my first with
Alfredo and Elena Arana and their
two children, a family whom I met
last year and who invited me to
share their apartment with them
for a couple weeks this summer.
Playing a form of basketball
with little Paco and Alfredito or
bouncing a battered miniature soc
cer ball on an equally battered half
court below their building, I could
hardly stop thinking of the poor
sports equipment. My observations
around the apartment were simi
larly pierced by thoughts of things I
could have brought, gifts inexpen
sive for me that would increase
their rather small number of
household goods and help to convey
my gratitude.
Yet the children's hugs and
words convinced me that my simple
presence with them was more valu
able than any stuff I could have
brought from los Estados LJnidos
— and convicted me of my own ob
session with material things.
How arrogant, how unseeing of
me to think I could improve their
life by bringing manufactured gifts
from a country engorged in the ma
terial. It is really I who receive the
blessing from my time with them,
both from the joy Paco and Alfredi
to and their parents give me, and
from the lessons in my heart that I
can bring back to the U.S.
The Aranas don't have that
much compared to my North Amer
ican family, but they also don't
have that little compared to many
other Venezuelans. Either way, it's
not important to them. It is impor
tant that they offered me their hos
pitality and I accepted.
Spending time with them, ex
pressing my love for them any way I
can, is the foundation of centering
my life on other people the way the
Venezuelans do. As such, the best
gift I can give Alfredo and Elena and
their family is not material but spir
itual. displaying in my words and ac
tions how happy and grateful I am to
bo with them, and how I will keep
them in my memories and prayers.
There's no question that I will
return to the United States and to
Stanford at the end of the summer,
and that American culture is still
my native one in many ways. But al
ready in mv brief time in Venezuela
I have discovered perspectives that
will, I hope, redefine my life.
