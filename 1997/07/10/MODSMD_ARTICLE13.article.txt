# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## The
						real world — destination Boise 
### 
GROWING UP, I had a defi
nite mental picture of what
"living on my own" would
be like. Mostly, it resembled the
Cosby Show episode when the
Huxtables teach Theo a life lesson
by turning his room into a "Real
World Apartment" and charging
him rent. That would be me, I
thought — stuck in a small room,
lying on a bare mattress, listening
to a stereo that represents all my
possessions in the world.
I was wrong. I'm not living in a
Cosby episode. I'm stuck in a mu
tant hybrid of Three's Company
and Gilligan's Island. My first
away-from-home, ofT-campus resi
dence is a house on the northwest
edge of Boise. I share it with four
other people: three physical thera
py interns doing tours of duty at
local hospitals and my fifty-some
thing, golf-fanatic landlady who
happens to be my editor's mother.
Like Three's Company, we're an
odd bunch to be sharing a house.
And like the crew of the S.S. Minow,
we're all marooned — in Boise. The
situation is a little strange, to say
the least.
Everything looked normal when
I first arrived at the modest yellow
brick house. There was an envelope
for me on the doorstep containing a
key, directions to my room and a
note from my editor (via her mom)
telling me to go to a ball game that
night. I found my room in the back
corner of the main level of the
house. So far. so good.
I went back outside to help un
pack the car. I heard a voice, turned
around and saw a half-naked, dirt

streaked man staring at me from
the kitchen. "You must be Jim," he
said in an accent straight out of
Fargo. "I'm Dave. I guess we're
housemates."
Thus I met Dave and Neil, two
wilderness-loving therapy interns
from the University of Wisconsin.
They live in the basement, drink a
healthy amount of beer on week
ends, camp whenever they can and
ride their mountain bikes almost
daily after work. I quickly learned
that they are both very smart, very
cool and more than a little crazy.
Riding with Dave on the way to
the grocery store one day, I remem
bered what a friend from school told
me about physical therapists. "Hey,"
I said jokingly, "I've heard that all
physical therapists are either pure
humanitarians or complete sadists."
"That's not true," he replied.
"We're all sadists." I laughed. He
did not.
I strained a groin playing basket
ball later in the week. My pain the
next day was Dave and Neil's
Christmas in July. They argued for
a long time over the proper treat
ment procedure I should follow. I
hobbled off somewhere around the
mention of shock therapy.
I escaped that incident without
harm or extensive rehabilitation,
but I could not escape their thera
pist world. Neil popped his head
into the room where I was typing a
few days later, excitedly displaying
a small black box.
"It's an EMG machine," he ex
plained, spending the next 10 min
utes describing the role of biofeed
back in physical therapy. He was

very technical and very excited
about the machine, even hooking it
up to himself to display the varying
levels of beeping noises it was capa
ble of emitting.
When he was done, he cocked an
eyebrow and put the box down. "It's
just a toy, a little trick," he said, and
walked out of the room.
Matt, the third physical thera
pist, moved in a few days ago. He
has yet to accost me with any ma
chinery, though he did beat me at
basketball.
I really don't see much of the
three guys, though, because they
work "normal hours" and I usually
do 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shifts. And I
never see Judy, my landlady. She's
always on the move, out drinking
with friends or playing in a golf
tournament or spending time at her
cabin in the mountains. I'm not
sure if she actually works any
where, but she has found time to
begin teaching me to bet the horses
at the track nearby.
It's definitely a different situa
tion than I imagined. It's certainly
not a bare mattress and a lonely
stereo — more like living at home,
but not in my house, and with my
family replaced by people who are
capable of tweaking with my mus
cle structure at any given time.
Strange as it is, it's fun. And at
least no one calls me "little buddv."

Daily sports editor Jim Tankersley
is spending his summer away from
home covering minor league base
ball for the Idaho Statesman. His
only regret is that no one feeds him
chocolate cake for breakfast.
