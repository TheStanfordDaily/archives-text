## A
						place of hope McDonald House provides families of ailing kids shelter, understanding ear 
### Katie Friedman 
Eleven years ago, Barbara Dro
tar's cousin arrived at the Ronald
McDonald House in Palo Alto suf
fering from three tumors. Last
month, he graduated with all A's
from Santa Clara University. Dro
tar visited her cousin during his
stay at the house and "couldn't be
lieve" the warm and supportive en
vironment that she found there.
Now a volunteer at the expanded
and refurbished Ronald McDonald
House, which reopened in 1992,
Drotar explained, "I'm here be
cause this is the place that doesn't
take my strength away from me at
all, even though I thought that it
would have. Here I have encoun
tered the most courageous people
in the world going through the
hardest times of their lives. It's an
honor to be part of it and to help."
Known as "the house that love
built," the Ronald McDonald
House; in Palo Alto was built in
1979, the fifth Ronald McDonald
House in the nation. Now, as one of
140 houses in the United States
and nearly 160 worldwide, the Palo
Alto center continues to offer low
cost accommodations to families
with children receiving treatment
for life-threatening illnesses at Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital or Stanford Medical Center.
At only $10 a night, a stay at the
house is significantly more afford
able than renting a room in the
hospital or a hotel. The center
never turns families away due to an
inability to pay.
But the house is much more
than a cost-effective temporary
residence. Drotar equated the nur
turing environment of the house to
"holding and touching preemie ba
bies vs. leaving them alone in an in
cubator."

"It is a place where you don't
have to pretend, a place where you
can feel at home because others un
derstand your circumstances," Ex
ecutive Director Honey Meir-Levi
said.
With 24 bedrooms / baths, the
house fosters a sense of community
among the families in residence.
Programs range from arts and
crafts evenings to barbecues to sin
galongs to an elaborate Christmas
party featuring real reindeer.
The house staff and volunteers
strive offer a break from the hospi
tal routine and to plan activities
that will ease the stress which in
evitably accompanies intensive
medical treatments. Additionally,
families are united to share
kitchens, play areas and comput
ers, as well as concerns, fears and
hopes.
"People make really deep
friendships here, almost like the
relationships among people who
live together in a dorm," observed
Meir-Levi. She cited the unique en
vironment as one of the house's
greatest strengths.
"I think that one of the most id
iotic expressions is, i know just
how you feel,' but the kids here can
genuinely say that to each other,"
she said.
Perhaps most important, the
house enables families themselves
to remain together.
Laura Celaya from Modesto,
Calif., is staying at the house with
her husband and three children.
When her middle child initially un
derwent treatment, Celaya accom
panied him, living in the hospital
for 1 1/2 months.
"I have a baby and an older son,
and it was very hard" being sepa
rated from them, she said.
Initially, Celaya had to petition
the hospital to allow her baby to

stay with her even for two days. It
was not until several weeks into
her son's stay that Celaya learned
about the Ronald McDonald House
from another patient's mother. Im
mediately, she put her name on the
waiting list, and she was admitted
one week later. Now, her family is
reunited, and appreciates the sup
port and privacy of the establish
ment.
"It's been great for my kids,"
said Celaya. "They enjoy it."
A paid full-time staff of only four
provides staffing for the house 24
hours a day, 365 days a year.
Drotar attributes the house's
success largely to the staunch and
generous support of the communi
ty. "Everything you see — every
bike, book, can of soda, piece of fur
niture — has been donated."
The house also depends heavily
on its dedicated contingent of over
120 weekly volunteers. Volunteer
ing can encompass anything from
working on projects with staff
members to leading children's art
projects to gardening in the facili
ty's well-maintained grounds.
While the house receives exten
sive support from the surrounding
community, Meir-Levi hopes to ex
pand awareness of the center on
the Stanford campus. She suggest
ed that numerous opportunities
exist for students to organize small
fund-raisers or to assist with those
already underway, to initiate activ
ities for the families in residence, or
to cook a dinner for those at the
house.
"We have some Stanford volun
teers," remarked Meir-Levi. "But I
could probably count them on one
hand."
Meir-Levi spoke highly of the
contributions made by one such
volunteer, Sarah Piper, a Stanford
senior who became involved with

the house through the Haas Center
for Public Sevice work study pro
gram.
Upon first visiting the facility
last November, Piper admitted
that she "didn't know much about
the Ronald McDonald House at
all."
While interning at the organiza
tion over the past year, Piper has

noticed a similar lack of knowledg
about the house among her peer.'
"When I tell people I work heri
they say, 'What? Where?' Peopl
always make the little joke abou
how I work at McDonald's. I thin
that people don't know much abou
the house, which is funny becaus
it's on Stanford land."
