## 
### Elizabeth Pianca Contributing writer 
Starting in August, the Stan
ford post office will be making
changes in the numbering of post
office boxes between 9941 and
11620.
"The boxes which are being
changed have duplicate numbers
at the central Palo Alto post of
fice," said Jim Ruiz, manager of
customer service at the Stanford
post office. "The result of this has
been that, for many years, individ
uals who have a post office box ad
dress between 9941 and 11620
have had their mail first sent to
the central Palo Alto office where
it is then forwarded to the dupli
cate post office box."
According to Ruiz, many of the
duplicate post office box numbers
at the Palo Alto central office be
long to large businesses who have
mailroom services that automati
cally open all mail.
"Students holding post office

boxes (with duplicate numbers)
have complained for years that
their mail arrives significantly
later then other students and of
tentimes opened," said Ruiz.
"Changing the numbering on the
boxes will end this problem."
Post office box numbers will be
increased by 6000. For example, a
student whose current number is
10005 will now get mail at P.O.
Box 16005.
Ruiz added that the change in
the numbering system will not af
fect the delivery of mail.
"A letter addressed with the old
P.O. box number will automatical
ly be sorted by our computer sys
tem and will arrive at the new P.O.
box number without any delays,"
he said.
However, Ruiz did suggest that
P.O. box holders who will be affect
ed send change-of-address notices.
"It is not an urgent matter that
they notify everyone as soon as
possible about the change, but I do
suggest that it be done," he said.
