Marguerite service expands
The Marguerite shuttle has expanded its route to
include Menlo Park.
Two additional buses will be added to the nine-ve
hicle fleet, the Palo Alto Weekly reported. This ex
pansion will add about $125,000 a year to the Mar
guerite budget and is funded partially by Stanford
and the Bay Area Air Quality District.
The new route will start from and end at the Palo

Alto Caltrain station and will hit more than 17 loca
tions along the way. The service will run during peak
hours from 6:45 to 9:38 a.m. and from 5 to 6:55 p.m.
If demand increases, more hours will be allotted.
Uiehl deliver emotional appeal
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — One of the
killers wiped away a tear yesterday while the parents
of slain American student Amy Biehl described their
daughter to a commission and said they never hated
her attackers.
The 26-year-old Fulbright scholar and Stanford
alumna from Newport Beach, Calif., was in South
Africa to help with voter registration for the na
tion's first all-race election in 1994 that ended
apartheid.
She died in the Guguletu black township outside
Cape Town in 1993, when a crowd of blacks stoned
her car, then beat and stabbed her.
The commission's amnesty panel is considering
whether to set free the four men serving 18-year
prison sentences for Biehl's murder. Though they
were convicted of murder, they never admitted their
role until testimony this week before the panel.
