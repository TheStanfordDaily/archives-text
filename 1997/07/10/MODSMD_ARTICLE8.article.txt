## Royals fire Boone Cavs, Knight ink three-year deal 
### Allison Otto Jeremy Stone Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
Continuing what has been a dif
ficult year for many ex-Stanford
baseball stars, the Kansas City
Royals fired Bob Boone as manager
yesterday.
Boone, hitting coach Greg
Luzinski and first-base coach
Mitchell Page were also fired by
general manager Herk Robinson,
who replaced Boone with Chicago
Cubs hitting coach Tom Muser.
The 49-year-old Boone lost his
last eight games as Royals skipper,
completing his first rm\jor-league
managerial stint with a three-year
record of 181-206.
"The day will come when this
club regrets that it fired Bob
Boone," Page said.
But Robinson, who gave Boone a
two-year contract extension after
last season, isn't so sure.
"I extended Bob Boone's con
tract because I thought he was the
right man for the job," Robinson
said. "Had I known we'd be 10
games under .500 with the addit ion
of (Chili Davis, Jay Bell and JefT
King to this year's team), I don't
know if I'd have done that."
The 49-year-old Boone was one
of the most durable catchers in
major league history and a star for
Stanford from 1967-71, teaming up
with current Stanford coach Mark
Marquess to lead the Indians to the
College World Series in 1967. He
led Stanford in hits in 1968 and
1969 and is a member of the Stan
ford Baseball Hall of Fame.
Boone is the only former Stan
ford player to become a
league manager.
Other former players trying to
return to big leagues
The 1997 Stanford media guide
lists 12 ex-Stanford stars currently
in the mtyor leagues. But Boone's
firing was the latest in a series of
roster moves that dropped the
number down to seven.
Right-handed pitcher Willie
Adams, Class of' 94, started the sea
son in the Oakland A's rotation.

But with a 3-5 record and an awful
8.82 ERA after 10 starts, he was
sent to AAA Edmonton. He has not
shined with the Trappers either,
going 2-3 with a 5.10 ERA in 42 1/3
innings pitched.
Journeyman first baseman
Mike Aldrete, '83, went from the
World Series champion New York
Yankees to the Toronto Blue Jays'
AAA team in Syracuse. Stanford's
third all-time leading hitter is bat
ting .297 after just 74 at bats.
Right-hander Brian Keyser, '89,
has toiled all year with the Chicago
White Sox's AAA squad in
Nashville. The two-time national
champion has performed well in re
lief for the Sounds, with a 5-2
record and 2.16 ERA in 28 games.
First baseman David McCarty,
Stanford's top hitter in the last 44
years in a three-year career that
ended in 1991, has penalized Pacif
ic Coast Ix'ague pitching for the
Phoenix Firebirds. The former
Giant will likely return to the par
ent club in September as he has hit
.341 with a team-high 16 home
runs and 64 RBIs in minor-league
ball.
Austin, Gerut represent U.S.
Junior right-hander Jeff' Austin,
whose recent pitching has reached
beat-wave proportions, was named
top pitcher for the USA Baseball
National Team following the 26th
annual USA-Japan Collegiate
Championship Series last month.
Austin hurled his most recent
scorcher in a 5-4 victory July 1
against the Korean National Team
at USC's Dedeaux Field. He
pitched six solid innings and al
lowed one earned run on five hits.
He struck out a season-high seven
batters.
Junior outfielder Jody Gerut
is 3 for 7 in limited action.
Knight signs with Cavs
Point guard Brevin Knight, '97,
agreed to terms Monday on a three
year deal with the Cleveland Cava
liers. The 16th overall pick in the
draft signed a contract Monday
that will pay him about $2.5 mil
lion. Guard Derek Anderson, the
Cavs' 13th pick, also signed.
