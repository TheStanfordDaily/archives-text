# Reveno returns as coach
## 
### Allison Otto Editorial staff 
Eric Reveno, a Stanford bas
ketball star during the late
1980s, was hired as a new assis
tant basketball coach for the
men's squad. Reveno's appoint
ment was announced Monday by
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We're delighted to have Eric
join the basketball coaching
staff," Montgomery said. "He
was a hard-working player from
our successful 1989 NCAA team.
He will be a perfect fit for our
program."
Reveno replaces former re
stricted-earnings coach Keith
Larsen, who has accepted a posi
tion as the athletic director and
head basketball and golf coach at
nearby Menlo College. Larsen
had assisted Montgomery for
five years. Doug Oliver and
Trent Jackson remain from last
year's staff.
Reveno, who graduated from
Stanford in 1989 with a degree in
economics, played in 116 games
during his four-year career on
the Farm. The 6-foot-8 Reveno
started in 30 games at center his
senior season, averaging 9.4
points and 5.1 rebounds per
game and helped lead the Cardi
nal to a '26-7 record, a 15-3 finish
in the Pacific 10 Conference and
a No. 12 national ranking. Stan
ford earned a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA tournament before a
shocking first-round loss to
Siena, marking the Cardinal's
first appearance in the tourna
ment since the 1941-42 national
championship season.
He was also second on the
team in steals with 40 and one of
the team leaders in shooting at
52 percent. For his career,
Reveno stands fourth on the
school's blocked shots list with
61 swats.
He played professionally in
Japan for four years after gradu
ation before returning to Stan
ford to earn a master's degree in
business administration in 1995.
Reveno continues a recent
trend of former Stanford basket

ball players who returned to the
Farm as assistant coaches under
their Cardinal mentors. Angela
Taylor and Ann Enthoven, who
played for the women's team
under Tara VanDerveer in the
early 19905, coached at Stanford
the last two years.
"Coach Montgomery and his
staff have done a fabulous job
with the basketball program,"
Reveno said. "I'm very excited
about coming back and con
tributing to their success."

The 31-year-old Reveno joins
a Cardinal squad coming off an
unprecedented trip to the Sweet
16 and a 24-8 season. The new
assistant coach will also have a
solid nucleus of players with
which to work. Only two players,
point guard Brevin Knight and
swingman Rich Jackson, gradu
ated from last season and sever
al highly touted recruits, includ
ing Jarron and Jason Collins, are
expected to contribute to an al
ready strong squad.
