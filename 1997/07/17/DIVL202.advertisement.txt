MINGS NEW VEGETARIAN MENU
Many vegetarian menus will provide the protein usually found in meat and poultry
by offering tofu. However, tofu is high in water content and may not fill the appetite.
To add substance to a meal, vegetarian merus often are overridden with pasta and rice
entrees that are high in calorics.
Soy gluten, a popular Chinese vegetarian mgredicnt provides protein without the
calories. Soy gluten is solid and contains the fiber and protein of soybean but is
starch-free and cholesterol-free. At Ming's, we prepare soy gluten dishes the same
way we prepare some of out most popular meat and potillry dishes. For instance, in
the vegetarian versions of our famous Chicken salad and Cashew Chicken, we
substitute shredded, cubed, and diced soy gluten for the meat items. These delicious
and healthy dishes satiate your appetite ... and leave you hungry for more.
More of Ming's that is. Stop by to see our new vegetarian menu ... or try our
traditional meat and poultry favorites.
