# Osterloh says she's ready for pros

Stanford barely got a chance to
know Lilia Osterloh.
The NCAA singles champion
and the top player on the national
champion tennis team called it a
career at Stanford this week in
order to concentrate on a more lu
crative career in the pros.
Few were overwhelmed by the
announcement.
Speculation had been brewing
since her torrid run through the
NCAA Championship, in which
she defeated Florida's M.C. White
6-1,6-1 in the title match, that the
Cardinal freshman would follow
the paths of John McEnroe and,
more recently, Scott Humphries
and leave Stanford after one year
for the pros. Osterloh never tried
to suppress those rumors.

Brennan feels that Osterloh could
materialize into a top-20 player in
a short period of time.
She came to Stanford as the top
junior player in the country but
struggled with shoulder injuries
at the beginning of the season.
But Osterloh and her devastating
forehand returned with a bang,
unseating junior All-American
Ania Bleszynski and senior Katie
Schlukebir, who was the top
ranked player in the nation ac
cording to the computers, at Stan
ford's top spot.
Osterloh finished the year 30-3
and 17-1 in dual-match singles
play, but it was her play in the
NCAA Championships that vali
dated the hype that had preceded
her arrival. She teamed with fel

low freshman Anne Kremer to
give Stanford a wicked 1-2 punch
at the premier slots, giving the
Cardinal one of the deepest line
ups in NCAA history.
She had hoped to make her pro
debut in next week's Bank of the
West Classic at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, but a hip flexor
sprain suffered at Wimbledon last
month will keep her out until —
most likely — the U.S. Open,
which begins in late August. Os
terloh lost in the first round of
qualifying at the Wimbledon 6-2
6-2.
Her loss leaves Stanford with
out three core players from last
year due to the graduation of
Katie Schlukebir and Sandra De
Silva. Stanford's top returning
players include senior Ania
Bleszynski, senior Julie Scott,
sophomore Teryn Ashley and
sophomore Anne Kremer.
Ironically, Kremer performed
better than Osterloh at Wimble
don. Kremer won two tough
three-set matches to qualify for
the draw only to meet eventual
champion Martina Hingis in the
first round. Kremer put up a bet
ter fight than all but one of
Hingis' competitors, falling 6-4,6-
4 to the Swiss 16-year-old.
While Kremer's international
singles ranking was higher than
Osterloh's entering last season,
Brennan and others feel Osterloh
has a shot to become one of Stan
ford's most successful pros. Only
one former Stanford woman —
Kathy Jordan — has ever ranked
higher than 18th in singles. Jor
dan reached fifth in the world in
1984.
