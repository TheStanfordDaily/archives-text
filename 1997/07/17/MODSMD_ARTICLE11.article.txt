# Shaw's slick — he brings back Wicks
## 
### Allison Otto Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Continuing a trend of former Stanford
athletes who return as coaches to the
Farm, Anne Wicks, a volleyball starter
from the powerhouse squads of the early
'90s, will assume the duties of assistant
coach. The appointment was announced
Friday by head coach Don Shaw. Wicks re
places Rob Patrick, who was named head
coach at Tennessee on June 28.
"We're thrilled to have Anne rejoin the
program," Shaw said. "She was a tremen
dous leader for us both on and off the court
in her four years here. Her experience as a
player and her familiarity with our pro
gram will certainly be an asset and will
make the coaching change transition a
smooth one."
The 6-foot-'2 middle blocker played at
Stanford from 1991-94. The three-year
starter was member of the formidable
1992 and 1994 NCAA title teams. Stan
ford was 115-12 in Wicks' career.
Wicks, who was dubbed "Slick" by her
teammates because of her leadership and
composure under high-pressure situa
tions, led the squad during her junior year
with 34 aces and 90 blocks. She was ap
pointed team captain as a senior.
O'Connor removes interim label
After nearly two years in an interim ca
pacity, Caroline O'Connor was named

head women's golf coach at Stanford on
Friday for good.
"We are excited that Caroline will re
main at the head of the women's golf pro
gram," said Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"We expect she will continue the tradition
of excellence in Stanford golf."
O'Connor, who was selected as interim
head women's coach in February 1996, led
the Cardinal to top-five finishes in five reg
ular and postseason tournaments during
the remainder of the season. The Cardinal
finished fifth at the NCAA Champi
onships that year, and this year O'Con
nor's squad captured six team and indi
vidual tournament titles and finished
fourth at NCAAs.
"I'm thrilled to be able to continue as
head coach here at Stanford," O'Connor
said. "With our returning players and in
coming freshmen, 1 think we can build the
women's golf program into the dynasty
that is characteristic of the Stanford ath
letic program."
Tim Baldwin, coach emeritus last year,
steps down after 18 years at Stanford. His
health problems led to O'Connor's promo
tion to interim head coach.
Austin continues to roll
Only an unexpected thunderstorm
could dampen Stanford pitcher Jeff
Austin's most recent scorcher for the 1997
USA Baseball National Team.
Wednesday, Austin led the U.S. to
a 2-0 victory at Space Coast Stadium in

Viera, Florida. The game was halted after
5-1/2 innings due to heavy rains, but not
before Austin struck out five, walked one
and improved his unblemished record to
3-0 on the season. The right-hander yield
ed a single with two outs in the first before
gaining momentum and retiring 12
straight batters.
During the sixth Austin burned
through the order before the rains erupt
ed and prematurely ended the contest.
Former two-sport great Johnson is
back in town
Catcher Brian Johnson, a former two
sport star for Stanford who graduated in
1989, returned to the Bay Area after the
San Francisco Giants acquired him in a
trade with the Detroit Tigers for backup
backstop Marcus Jensen. Both players
played high school ball at Skyline High
School in Oakland.
Johnson was sent to AAA Toledo last
we ■ after failing to gamer much playing
timt behind the younger Raul Casanova
and Matt Walbeck. He was hitting .237
with 18 RBIs in 139 at bats in the majors,
and Jensen was 0 for his last 26 and bat
ting a paltry .149.
The Giants have struggled offensively
at catcher all year, as Rick Wilkins and his
.199 average were benched in favor of fel
low journeyman Damon Berryhill.
Johnson was Stanford's starting quar
terback in 1987 and won two NCAA cham
pionship rings as a baseball player.
