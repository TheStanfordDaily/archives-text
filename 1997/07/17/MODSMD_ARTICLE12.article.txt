## Hoping for happiness: Truszczynski's 'Uncle Vanya' anticipates the winter blues 
### 
If you've any doubts that theater and pol
itics aren't hopelessly tied together, ask Pol
ish actor/director Jarek Truszczynski about
his days in the National Theater in Warsaw.
As Poland experienced the uneasy transi
tion from Communism to Socialism, "the
ater was a battlefield," he said.
Truszczynski recalled such dramatic mo
ments as the General Consul Kitting up in
the middle of a performance as a protest
against an inflammatory play criticizing the
current regime. And in another example of
life rising into drama, Truszczynski wit
nessed the blurring of the two during one
musical theater performance when the au
dience, deeply moved by the show, joined the
actors onstage for a big choir protest song.
"There were working people and soldiers
in the audience and tbey all joined us, to
show equality," said Truszczynski.
These days Truszczynski, who is 37, is
not breaking into song, but still bringing
music onstage, as director of Anton
Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya"' at the Nitery
Theater. One of his directorial touches is the
use of live music during the show, especially
Schubert's Fantasia in F Minor, Four
I lands.
"Uncle Vanya," a comedy about lovelorn
disillusioned men and women, is typical
Chekhov. A selfish, aging professor arrives
in the family estate with his beautiful wife,
disrupting the lives of the people living in the
land, especially Vanya. There's heartbreak.
There's talk about work. And, breaking with
tradition, there's even a gunshot. Underlin
ing it all, there's the piano music, played by
different characters to express everything
from boredom to joy to romantic longing.
Truszczynski's direction is also notable
for some striking visual images, making
good use of the set of three doors on the
background, and the symbolic advantages of
bringing candles onstage. Although this is
his first time directing, Truszczynski's
name may be familiar to some here, since
he's already acted in five Stanford produc
tions, including last year's well-received
"The Inspector General."
That Gogol play was directed by ac
tress/director Aleksandra Wolska, who is, by
the way, Truszczynski's wife. But they
didn't meet at Stanford. After a seven-year
stint at the National Theater, playing in

more than 30 productions everyone from
"Streetcar Named Desire's" Stanley Kowal
ski to Claire in a cross-gender version of
"The Maids," Truszczynski moved to the
United States. In Boston, while looking for a
director for a play he was doing, he met and
later married Wolska.
Wolska plays Helena in "Uncle Vanya,"
the woman who sparks tensions between
Vanya and his brother-in-law and unwit
tingly separates Sonya from the man she

loves, a local doctor infatuated with Helena.
Truszczynski doesn't make much ado of the
fact that, as Wolska's director, he's reversed
their usual roles, which consists of Wolska
directing him.
"It's a very professional relationship.
When I direct, she listens. And when she di
rects, I'm just quiet and do whatever," said
Truszczynski. "And then if you really have
problems, you can talk about it at home. But
not here '

"Uncle Vanya" also features Drama As
sociate Professor Rush Rehm as the doctor,
Lucja M. Kwasniak as Sonya, John Allen as
the Professor and James Shelby in the title
role. The play runs through July 27 at the
Nitery Theater in Old Union, playing
Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets cost $12 general,
$9 students and seniors, and are available
through the Tresidder box office or by call
ing 725-ARTS.
