# 'Temptress Moon' looks great but seems shallow
## 
### 
"Wind-flower-snow-moon" is the poetic
Chinese phrase used to describe wildly ro
mantic love. The character for "wind" can
also be translated as "temptress," and it is
after these two characters that Chen
Kaige's newest film, "Temptress Moon," is
named.
The time is the political upheaval of
Emperor Pu Yi's abdication from the
throne of China in favor of a modern re
public, in 1911. The film opens with the
arrival of the boy Zhongliang at the ex
pansive Pang family estate in rich, agri
cultural Suzhou. The estate represents
tradition and the old ways. Zhongliang
has been summoned there by his sister,
Xiuyi, who has married the heir to the es
tate. Although he is hopeful for a happy
life, his status sinks to that of a servant

for the opium-addicted family. He makes
two friends in the household, Ruyi, his
sister-in-law, and Duanwu, a poor rela
tive.
Under mysterious circumstances,
Zhongliang leaves the household sometime
after being coerced into kissing (at the very
least) his sister. He eventually makes his
way to Shanghai, a sophisticated city re
plete with dance halls and gambling dens.
It is a jarring contrast to the ancient seren
ity of the Pang estate.
Zhongliang (played as an adult by
"Farewell My Concubine" 's Leslie Che
ung) becomes a gigolo under the tutelage
of a gang boss. Basically, he seduces mar
ried women and blackmails them. When
the Pang patriarch dies in the 19205, the
boss sends Zhongliang home to try his

wiles on Ruyi (Gong Li), now mistress of
the household. Because she is still unmar
ried, Duanwu (Kevin Lin) has been as
signed as her aide and he loves her slavish
ly-
Starved for human contact, Ruyi falls
for Zhongliang's charms. However, this
particular job has broken Zhongliang's
spirit, for not only does he harbor resent
ment against the household, he has also
become attracted to Ruyi. He returns to
Shanghai, shattered. His boss brings Ruyi
and Duanwu to the big city in the attempt
to cure his lovesickness.
A story very much about selfishness,
"Temptress Moon" is beautiful to watch
with its lavish sets and exquisite costumes.
However, the film has many messages, and
the plethora of subplots weaken the mo

mentum of the main storyline. Xiuyi's sus
tained sexual interest in her brother is just
one of the many plot threads that diffuse
the focus of the film.
Just as in to Kaige's last film, "Farewell
My Concubine," it is difficult to sympa
thize with the characters. They are styl
ized almost to the point of caricature, lack
ing any human quirks or contradictions.
Ruyi and Zhongliang never seem vulnera
ble, despite the plot twists that show them
as victims of manipulation.
Densely layered with psychological nu
ance, this visually gorgeous film would be
more likeable with just a few less layers
and more realistic characterizations. Wild
ly romantic love just doesn't fare well in
"Temptress Moon."
