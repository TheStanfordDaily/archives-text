## Lilith Fair and H.O.R.D.E. fest come to Bay Area 
### 
It's festival season again for the
summer shed circuit.
The Lilith Fair rolled into
Shoreline Amphitheater on Tues
day, July 8. Opener Suzanne Vega
performed a quick six-song set with
just a stand-up bass for accompani
ment and was well received. Paula
Cole was singularly unimpressive
with her bland pop rock. The feel to
her set was simply one of tightly
polished studio rock, the sound
production was heavy on the
drums and Cole's set was thankful
ly brief.
The surprise of the show was a
fantastic set by Jewel. Alone with
just an acoustic guitar for her first
four songs, Jewel captured the au
dience with superb music and ten
sioned lyrics. A full backing band
joined her on stage for a number of
funky folk-rock tunes, after which
she remained alone on stage for
three more numbers, including a

searingly slow "Pieces of You."
Joined once again by her band,
Jewel finished her extended 12
song set with a beautiful "Save
Your Soul."
As darkness fell, Tracy Chap
man took the stage for an unsur
prisingly excellent set. Chapman
enthralled the crowd with "New
Beginning," "Fast Car" and "Give
Me One Reason." She also acqui
esced to the clamoring crowd for a
stripped-down subtle encore ver
sion of "Talkin' Bout A Revolu
tion."
Festival founder and closing
artist Sarah McLachlan, without
the charisma or musical genius of
Chapman, had trouble holding onto
the audience's attention. Her best
moment was perhaps her sparse en
core of "Ice Cream."
The major problem with the
show was its promoting. Billed as a
festival of women in rock, the

Lilith Fair is more accurately a fes
tival of acoustic guitar-playing
lead female pop-folk-rock vocalists
backed by male musicians. When
you consider that there were 17
backup musicians on stage during
the day, and the only female
among them was McLachlan's
backup vocalist, the show's label
ing as revolutionary is inaccurate
hyperbole. It was only a matter of
time, and hopefully future ver
sions of the tour will be more ad
venturous in their lineups.
Last Friday's H.O.R.D.E. festi
val was so tightly timed that acts on
the two stages were starting and
stopping within five minutes of
each other. Radio hipsters Squirrel
Nut Zippers let loose their funky
big band rock-lounge act on the
main stage but failed to fill up the
pavilion with their bar/club sound.
Boulder, Co.'s Leftover Salmon
played a disappointingly brief sec

ond stage set and were plagued by
poor sound, but still managed to
bring joy to the crowd with their
eclectic rock known as "polyethnic
ayun slamgrass." They are defi
nitely a band to see, as recent Fill
more gigs have proven.
Big Head Todd And The Mon
sters played an excellent main
stage set, with an added organ and
backup female vocals by
Miller. They unleashed a number
of hits, including "Broken Hearted
Savior," "Bittersweet" and "Cir
cle," and should consider adding
the tour organist and vocalist to
their permanent lineup. Ben Fold
Five then delivered a brief and for
gettable second stage set.
The next performer, Primus,
rocked the main stage. While a
fierce mosh pit developed on the
lawn, bassist and vocalist Les Clay
pool absolutely dominated the
stage and overwhelmed the crowd.

The Boston bund Morphine per
formed a quick five-song set on the
second stage, grinding out fantas
tic, bluesy swing-jazz-rock. Catch
them when you get the chance.
Headliner Neil Young and
Crazy Horse then took the main
stage for an intense hour-and-a
half set. Opening with a blazing
"Cinnamon Girl," Young scorched
the audience with the broken pre
punk anthem "Hippie Dream,"
and then launched into a four-song
acoustic interlude that included
the classic Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young tune "Helpless." Young
plugged back in for a roaring "Like
A Hurricane" but then began to
look haggard. When he ended his
set with an audience-approved
"Hey Hey My My," Young looked
ready to drop in exhaustion, but
had given the appreciative crowd
their money's worth.
