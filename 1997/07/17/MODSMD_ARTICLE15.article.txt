AS TINY AND PROSPER
OUS Hong Kong takes its
first tentative steps as a
part of mainland China, the peo
ple of the highly civilized region
remain cautiously observant and
acutely aware of the unforeseen
turns the future can hring.
Will China really transform the
riches of this urban land, or will
Hong Kong advance its vulnerable
motherland with its overwhelm
ing opulence?
According to Carleen Chou, one
of about 500 Stanford alumni cur
rently working in Hong Kong, the
region's businesses are already
seeing "subtle changes."
"I think a lot of companies are
shifting the focus of their opera
tions to Singapore but keeping
the Hong Kong operations run
ning just to hedge their position,"
said Chou, an associate at Morgan
Stanley, an American investment
bank. "This is apparent in the
movement of the expatriate popu
lation. A lot of (foreign) compa
nies have transferred their em
ployees to Singapore — 1 have
also been asked to transfer to Sin
gapore."
Other changes are apparent in
the former colony's education sys
tem. Hong Kong classes, now
taught in Cantonese, will trans
form to Mandarin over the next
two years. The two languages —
the former spoken in Hong Kong
and the latter in mainland China
— are similar only in the written
form.
According to Janice Wong, a
17-year-old high school senior,
language is not the only change
which will take place in Hong
Kong schools. Teachers' attitudes
and the mindset of her fellow
classmates are also changing.
"Our teachers will say that the
British larel not good," she said.
"They tell us that the British lead
Hong Kong to grow up, but also
used us to bring their economy up.
Before, everybody wanted to be
British and said only good things."
Commenting that Hong Kong
has benefited from the British ad
ministration, Wong said she is not
sure if China will be as helpful.
"China is my mother country
and there are things about it that
I like and don't like," she said.
"For example. . .there are bad
things in the government; officials
steal money and put it into their
pockets. But I don't worry that
I long Kong will become this way. I
think we are too sophisticated
I fori that."
Kavis Lo, a Bank of Hong Kong
employee, is in his third year of
exams to become a certified public
accountant. He hopes to be a CPA
within the next five years.
"I am scared of the Chinese
government, of corruption and of
t he insecurity of my job," he said.
Lo said he is afraid that ac
countants and others licensed by
the British government will be
forced to retake qualifying exami

nations under Beijing's rule.
Stanford junior Melvina Che
ung, an international student
from Hong Kong, expressed con
cerns about career potential back
home, commenting that many of
her high school friends are now
unsure where to go after college.
"I was bred in one of Hong
Kong's elite Anglo-Chinese
schools that aimed to prepare stu
dents for higher education
abroad," she said, adding that the
students in these schools often
went to American or British uni
versities and returned home to as
sume prominent positions in soci
ety.
"Now we are in somewhat am
biguous roles; the uncertainty of
(Hong Kong's future) has meant
we might look elsewhere to settle
down."
Perhaps the biggest concern
for optimists and pessimists alike
is human rights, and in particular,
freedom of expression.
Hong Kong media exercised
self-censorship long before the
stroke of midnight on .June 30, ac
cording to Nick Kristof, a New
York Times writer and Beijing bu
reau chief during the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.
"I don't expect reporters to be
dragged off to jail in Hong Kong as
they sometimes are in China," he
said. "But 1 think there will be
pressure put on the publications
and on the advertisers who keep
them afloat."
Henry Chiang, the Venezuelan
consul to Hong Kong, said the
South China Morning Post, one of
two major English language news
papers in Hong Kong, will not sur
vive the transition.
Its opponent, the I long Kong
Standard, was chosen by the Chi
nese government to run an adver
tisement informing the public
about the government-controlled
road detours that were in place
during the handover holiday. "Al
ready, there are obvious signs,"
Chiang said. "The South China
Post is not getting government in
formation. It is very pro-British.
They are running out of money."
Kristof also expressed concerns
over corruption and the possibili
ty that gangsters would be used to
punish journalists judged too ag
gressive by the Chinese govern
ment.
"That was a pattern in the bad
old days," he said. "If a Chinese of
ficial is angry at a critical journal
ist, there's no need for the police
to get involved — it would be sim
pler and more efficient for the
general to ask some gangster
friends to visit the journalist and
break his legs and arms. That, I
fear, is going to be one of the chal
lenges for Hong Kong journalists
in the upcoming years."
