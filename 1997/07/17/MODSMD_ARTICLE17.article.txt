# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## Clinging to major league dreams 
### 
THE HAWKS NEST is a sit
down restaurant that bor
ders the home bullpen at
Memorial Stadium in Boise. Dur
ing games, it's filled with fans who
pay eight dollars each — plus the
price of dinner — to watch baseball
from the comfort of a plastic table
down the left field line.
After games, the restaurant
stays open to serve the Boise team,
and the Hawks Nest adopts the
friendly, laid-back attitude of the
young players. Relaxing in groups
of four or five, the players will talk
with just about anyone — curious
fans, kids seeking autographs, and
even the occasional newspaper re
porter.
It's too early in the season for
me to know every player by sight,
so I rely on the few familiar faces to
guide me through. "Hey Steve," I
say to an Oregon-born pitcher who
played in the same league as I did,
back when I was a high school
freshman and still clinging to my
major league dreams, "which one is
Dougherty?"
He smiles, swallows a bite of hot
dog and points me to a man in a
green polo shirt hunched over a
table 60 feet away. "Thanks," 1 say,
and he frees one hand from the dog
to shake mv hand.
The first thing that strikes me
about Jeb Dougherty is his height.
He's maybe 5-foot-9 — one of the
few guys on the team shorter than
me — and his face has a certain
quality that makes him look
straight out of a British boys choir.
Only his sideburns, which extend
well below the midpoint between

his ears and jaw, offer any indica
tion that Jeb is the Hawks' right
fielder and not the batboy.
All the Hawks players are cor
dial, many of them are energetic
and a few of them go out of their
way to be friendly. But Jeb
Dougherty is more than that. He
is. . .enthusiastic. I ask him about
his hitting. He is coming off a two
hit, two-RBI game that was one of
his best outings of the season. He is
excited, even flattered, that any
one, let alone a reporter, would be
interested in how he plays baseball.
"You've been struggling lately,"
I say. He answers before I can make
the statement a question.
"You know, I really have had a
hard time," he says. "You know
what it is, Jim. I'm having trouble
adjusting to the wooden bats."
In my two weeks of covering the
Hawks, it is the first time anyone
on the team has called me by name
in an interview. And I've known
this guy for, what, two minutes?
It's unbelievable!
We keep talking for a good five
minutes more about his hitting.
He's been doing extra work with
the coaches. He feels like he's been
making solid contact, but tonight
was the first time he hit the ball in
the right places, and he happened
to score some runners.
It's a very relaxed conversation.
He's not speaking in sound bytes,
unlike some guys on the team who
are definitely used to reporters and
know how to sound good in print. I
get the feeling that Dougherty
hasn't exactly been the center of
media attention in the past. So he's

not treating me like a reporter, but
like an acquaintance.
I'm writing down one of his last
comments, about to thank him for
his time and move on, when he asks
me a question. "Where did you go
to college?" he says.
He asks if I know some people
(I've heard of some of them); his
roommate at San Diego State Uni
versity was from Palo Alto and
friends from Stanford visited once.
We talk for maybe five minutes
more. He misses the beach and his
friends, he says. I miss Southern
California too, I say, because my
girlfriend is there, in Hemet. He
grew up in a town a few miles away
from her, he says.
I shake his hand and thank him
for his time. Later that night, after
my story is filed and all the corners
of the stadium, the Hawks Nest in
cluded, are dark, I realize what was
special about the interview.
For a few minutes, someone
cared about how Jeb Dougherty
was playing. At the same time, the
short right fielder made me feel like
more than just a guy with a
notepad. I wasn't just interviewing
Jeb Dougherty, I was conversing
with him.
Boise is just a stop on Jeb's path,
which he hopes will lead to a major
league career. He's learning, he
said, getting to know the game and
himself a little better each day.
I think it's the truest thing I've
heard all summer.

Jim Tankersley is just waiting in
Boise until he gets called up to The
Show.
