## 700 grad students unassigned Despite 2 new residences, number without housing skyrockets 
### Kerry Shaw 
Seven hundred graduate stu
dents have not been assigned
housing for fall quarter despite
the construction of two new grad
uate residences this year.
The number stands in stark
contrast to last year, when only
233 people were unassigned. Last
year there were two couples with
children on the waiting list for
housing; this year there are 110.
"Palo Alto is a tight market
that tends to force people out."
said Melissa Piker, the summer
housing manager. She also specu
lated that more people entered the
Draw because of the construction
of the Schwab Residential Center
and the Lyman Graduate Resi
dences, which added 504 apart
ments.
"We actually thought that we
were going to have vacancies,"
Piker said. "When we opened
Rains |another graduate housing
complex] a few years ago, we had
several vacancies."
Kathleen Bransfield, the acting
manager of Housing Assignment
Services, said her office experi
enced a 20-to 25-percent increase
this year in the overall demand for
graduate student housing. De
mand among graduate students
with children increased for the
first time in 10 years, going up
14.6 percent. For couples without
children, demand increased 25
percent.
Nancy Tsai, a doctoral student
in mechanical engineering who
did not receive housing, sent an e
mail message to two graduate stu
dent groups on June 30 to see if

others are as frustrated as she is
with the University's housing sys
tem.
She has since then received 90
responses, three of which came be
fore eight o'clock that morning.
"Only one person did not have a
complaint," she said. "Not all of
the respondees had been dis
placed. Some people wanted to ex
press support for the cause."
Tsai eventually found housing
in Palo Alto for next fall that re
quired her to pay rent starting
July 3. She had already signed a
contract for summer housing
through September. Her petition
to be released from her contract
was initially rejected. "I'll be pay
ing two rents for six weeks," she
said.
Tsai said the lottery results
were posted late in May when she
had only two weeks to move out of
her spring quarter housing if she
elected not to take her summer as
signment.
Tsai said her housing search re
vealed that the highest on-campus
rent is $450 per person. "You can't
find a two-bedroom apartment in
Palo Alto for less than $1,350 a
month," Tsai said. That's $675 a
person, which is a 50-percent in
crease in rent that person would
have to pay."
Housing in Palo Alto is not only
expensive but also hard to find.
Most people take what they can
get because they know that "10
other people will be in line after
you," Tsai remarked.
To live within budget, students
have to search farther from cam
pus, but many students do not
own cars, Tsai added.

One student responding to
Tsai's survey expressed frustra
tion that his departmental stipend
— his only source of income as a
full-time graduate student — will
not cover rent costs off-campus,
Tsai said.
Tsai compiled the results from
her survey and presented them to
Housing Assignment Services in a
meeting July 2. She was hoping to
make it possible for graduate stu
dents to terminate their summer
contracts without penalty.
Currently, a summer contract
is for three months, and a school
year contract is for nine months
Next year, in response to recom
mendations by the Graduate Stu
dent Housing Advisory Commit
tee, students will be able to sign
12-month contracts, which will
eliminate the need for them to
enter the summer lottery.
Students will have the option of
being released from a year-long
contract if they file a termination
of occupancy card by the appropri
ate deadline.
After her meeting, Tsai was
released from her summer con
tract by Housing Assignment
Services.
"We were told that we were fi
nally released because we applied
for a petition during the interim
period between Spring and Sum
mer Quarter." Tsai said. "They
are still very reluctant to grant pe
titions."
For now, unhoused students
are advised to look at the housing
bulletin boards in Tresidder
Union and the Housing Assign
ment Services Office in Old Union
and on World Wide Web sites
