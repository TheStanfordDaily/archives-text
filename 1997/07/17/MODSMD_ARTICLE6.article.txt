# 231 undergraduates still seeking on-campus housing
## 
### Kerry Shaw 
Before most students leave campus for
the summer, they've been assigned housing
for the next year by the spring housing lot
tery. But this summer, 231 students are
unassigned — up from 159 last year — be
cause not enough spaces were available in
the Draw for everyone who wanted housing.
There's now a shortage of housing spaces
because fewer students are chwising to live
off-campus. That's the result of a tight real
estate market in Palo Alto, which is making
rental rates too expensive for students, ac
cording to Kathleen Bransfield, the acting
manager of Housing Assignment Services.
More on-campus spaces have become avail
able, though, because the former Delta
Kappa Epsilon house will be opened to un
dergraduates seeking housing.
A double room in Florence Moore Hall
costs $325 per month — although a board
plan costing $310 per month is required. In
comparison, the least expensive off-campus
room in Palo Alto advertised on the bulletin
board in Tresidder Union costs $600 per
month.
The long wait
Since 1992, the University has guaran
teed four years of housing to undergradu
ates. To meet that pledge this year, Housing

Assignment Services has to find housing for
any of the 231 unassigned undergraduates
who want it.
Enough are demanding housing that a
team of University housing officials is scour
ing the campus to find extra spaces.
The committee is specifically searching
for study and guest rooms in dorms that
could be easily converted to residential
rooms. They are also noting particularly
large rooms that could accommodate anoth
er resident.
"We don't want to have significantly
changed a residence so that we couldn't re
convert it back to its current configuration,"
Bransfield said. She emphasized that dorm
lounges and computer clusters would not be
considered for conversion.
Housing Assignment Services will not
know how many, if any, extra rooms will be
needed until assignments from the Waiting
List are made July 27.
The Waiting List is open to students seek
ing reassignment as well as students who did
not receive housing in the Draw.
Students on the Waiting List resubmit
their list of housing preferences and keep
their numbers from the original draw. New
comers are assigned higher numbers, based
on when they register for the Waiting List.
Rooms are made available when stu
dents' plans change over the summer. Some

students decide not to return to campus and
free up rooms, Bransfield explained. Gener
ally almost all students on the Waiting List
are assigned.
The availability of 592 Mayfield — the
former Deke House — for unassigned stu
dents was publicized in a June letter. Eligi
ble students were given the option of re-or
dering their choices.
Senior Aaron Simon received one such
letter. Simon drew 2,817 of a possible 3,000.
His group did not receive an assignment in
the Draw, and he is now seeking any on-cam
pus spot. He has renumbered his prefer
ences, placing the Deke House first.
Simon noted that there are 50 men on the
Waiting List ahead of his group. "We're not
hopeful of receiving a spot," he said.
Bransfield believes the Deke house will be
a popular choice among students, particular
ly among groups seeking to be reunited. The
availability of the Deke House won't help
solve the housing crunch — the Dekes evict
ed from their house are still guaranteed a
place somewhere on campus.
Wait-listed to walk-in
Simon and others who are unassigned are
not even guaranteed to be assigned housing
through the Waiting List. In fact, there are
always some Waiting List students who are
don't make it into the available spaces. A stu

dent who is unassigned after the Wait List
Round has one final hope: walk-ins.
Walk-ins match students with vacancies
that are created during the month of Sep
tember. Potential walk-ins show up at 6 p.m.
on Sept. 25 in Tresidder to find housing. In
order to claim a room as a walk-in, a student
must be willing to live anywhere on campus
with anyone of the same sex. Last year aftrr
walk-ins, there were some vacancies still
available, Bransfield said.
This situation presents another hassle for
students: living with an unknown room
mate, usually referred to as a "random.
Undergraduates are allowed to choose up
to seven other people with whom they would
like to live. The walk-in policy, which assigns
students to the first available rooms, does
not accommodate groups hoping to live to
gether and generally pairs students with
random roommates.
Simon says living together is his group's
top priority. He gave up his preferred year
and drew "unpreferred" in order to live with
his group. They are willing to search and pay
for off-campus housing if the University will
not house them together next year.
"I'm a little bitter at Stanford for putting
me in this situation," he said. "I expect a lit
tle more credibility behind the 4 years of
housing guarantee, especially from
a university located in an area with
a real estate market as tight as the
Bay Area's."
Brewton would also like to live
with his Draw group next year. "1
don't want to have to deal with
finding a place to rent on top of
working my summer job, my re
seal eh, studying for the MCAT and
summer school," he said
Off-campus prices
In the not-so-distant past, off
campus housing wasn't nearly as
unaffordahle. A look at the Class of
198 l's 15th-reunion hook shows
that more than 10 percent of its se
niors lived off-campus. This year,

that figure is estimated to be less
than 5 percent.
Tom Naughton, Class of '91,
lived off campus during his senior
year with three brothers from the
Kappa Sigma fraternity. Together,
they paid $1,400 per month for
what he describes as a one-and-a
half-bedroom apartment.
"I don't think even in New York
or Los Angeles I could live in an
equivalent apartment and pay the
rent that I paid in Palo Alto," he
said. Naughton is living in Dallas
now and paying $900 for a compa
rable apartment.
For comparison purposes
$1,200 in Ann Arbor, Mich., will
rent a four-bedroom house with
two bathrooms and a basement.
UCLA sophomore Christina White
pays $.'lOO per month for a one-bed
room apartment just two blocks
from campus.
