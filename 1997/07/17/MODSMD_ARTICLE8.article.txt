## Tennis, anyone? Stanford to host world's best at Taube 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The Stanford campus has hosted more than a col
lege's fair share of exciting sporting events.
Count the Bank of the West Classic among those.
The nation's oldest all-women's professional ten
nis tournament will hegin Monday after two days of
qualifying matches at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
Eight of the world's top 14 players (minus the injured
Steffi Graf) headline the marquee attraction, made
possible thanks to the $5.85 million, 4,500-seat stadi
um, which recently hosted the NCAA Championship.
The tourney represents the latest in a series of
huge athletic competitions to be held at Stanford.
Stanford Stadium has hosted World Cup matches and
Super Bowl XIX. Countless NCAA championships
have been contested, in whole or in part, on the Farm.
While no Super Bowl, the Bank of the West Classic
brings a collection of talent impressive for any tennis
tournament to an area with a strong predilection to
ward both women's sports and tennis.
The world's best player, 16-year-old Martina
Hingis of Switzerland, will be here. The new Wimble
don champion has lost just one match this year. So
will former No. 1 Monica Seles, who has struggled re
cently hut claims 82 titles in her career. Hingis
crushed Seles in last year's final 6-2, 6-0 and has con
tinued to roll since.
The move to Stanford represents a twofold positive
change in direction for the tournament. It used to be
a November stop on the tour but is now sandwiched
between the two premier tennis events, Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open, making it an attractive tuneup for
top players. Two other California tourneys follow.
Secondly, with the summer weather, it moves to
an outdoor venue. Formerly held at the Oakland
Coliseum, it was forced to move in 1996 due to the
renovation of that venue to Kaiser Arena in Oak
land. But after discussions about moving to Maples
Pavilion, the change of date made a move to Taube
desirable.
Thirty-two players and 16 doubles teams will com
pete in the $450,000 event, which was first held in
1971. Americans Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe
Fernandez will compete, along with Amanda Coetzer,
Conchita Martinez, Mary Pierce and Kimberly Po to
round out the list of ranked competitors.
The final four entrants in the draw will be the sur
vivors of a 32-player qualifying round beginning Sat
urday. Two matches will be played simultaneously on
adjacent courts for most of the tourney.
Tickets are still available through Bass Tickets at
(415) 392-4400 or (408) 998-BASS, and weekend
