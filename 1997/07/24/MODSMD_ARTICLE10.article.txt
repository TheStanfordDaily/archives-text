# Bad news, Bears
## Don't pity Kasser 
### 
John Kasser can't be a happy
man. First the California ath
letic director goes through
three football coaches in 18 months
as the Golden Bears lose consecu
tive Big Games while his women's
basketball program is mired in the
conference cellar along with his
baseball team. And now his men's
basketball team is on probation.
But as a Stanford-affiliated per
son, it's hard to have sympathy for
him. Maybe the NCAA says Cal did
everything it could to rectify the sit
uation, as Kasser says, but dis
graced former men's basketball
coach Todd Bozeman was there
until Cal had a losing season. If the
Golden Bears did in 1995-96 what
they did last year under Ben Braun,
would Bozeman even have been un
employed?
Everybody at Cal seems shocked
that Bozeman was so sleazy. Why?
Outsiders saw it from a mile away.
And throw out the scum — for all
that talent he enlisted, he just
couldn't coach. His strategy and
conduct in game situations made
Stanford people even more grateful
for Mike Montgomery. Bozeman
was a boy in a man's job, and one
obviously with a lot of money at his

disposal. But Cal didn't notice.
So suppose the university didn't
know he was dishing out dough to
Jelani Gardner's parents mot to
sound holier than thou, but can you
imagine that happening here?).
Does that make it any better?
What would happen to Ted Le
land if Tara VanDerveer was dish
ing out large sums of cash to John
Edgar Wideman to lure his daugh
ter Jamila here? Adios, Ted.
Now Iceland didn't hire Van-
Derveer, and Kasser joined Cal in
early 1994, after Bozeman replaced
Lou Campanelli in a ballyhooed
midseason coaching change. But
Bozeman stayed on as permanent
head coach for one year under
Kasser's regime. And Kasser gave

him a five-year contract. Fiueyears.
Yet nobody's outwardly mad at
him.
Instead, Kasser has been saluted
for hiring Ben Braun, a straight
arrow and fine basketball coach,
and Marianne Stanley to run the
women's program. Both those hires
were outstanding. And maybe he's
a nice guy, as everybody contends.
But Kasser still decided Boze
man was the man and gave him a
five-year deal. He stood by him
while the team was winning. His

department failed to monitor Boze
man's travel expenses and conduct.
Kasser shows zero remorse. He's
made a molehill out of a mountain.
He doesn't think the probation
will drastically affect recruiting. He
thinks Cal's fortunate to be banned
from postseason just one year —
the Bears probably wouldn't have
made it anyway. Hell, Cal can even
be on TV still. In other words,
thank God. And don't blame me —
I had nothing to do with it. I didn't
know about it. I did all that I could.
Most Cal people can't really crit
icize him because they wanted
Bozeman too. They were blinded
with the euphoria that came with
their 1993 run to the Sweet 16,

making Bozeman the youngest
coach ever to do that. And could he
recruit or what?
But flash back to four years ago.
Kasser wasn't around yet. The
Stanford men's hoopsters were 7-
23 and its football team was 4-7,
while the Golden Bear football
team was in the Alamo Bowl, Cal
women were in the NCAA tourna
ment and the men were in the
Sweet 16. What's up now?
It's not all Kasser's fault. But
why act so smug — pretend it's not
a big deal — when the fortunes of
Golden Bear athletics are shaky at
best and the athletic department is
on quasi-severe probation? Cal's
NCAA title in men's gymnastics is

great and all, but Stanford is killing
Cal not only in most Olympic
sports, but also the big ones. And
the Cardinal is doing it cleanly.
Stanford has not had the need to
admit wrongdoing. And Cal seems
to think that since they've hired
coaches with crystal-clean reputa
tions (excepting Stanley, who has
an undeserved bad rap), it's all
good. They're on TV still.
I'd love to think the Cal folks
have righted the ship, but why
should I be so sure? They're trying
to pretend the whole thing never
happened. Bozeman resigned under
pressure according to the San Jose
Mercury News, but Cal's Web site
says Kasser relieved Bozeman of his

duties. As if to say, we did fill we
could, but it was just too late.
Here's what the Cal media guide
for the ill-fated 13-14 season of
1995-96 says:
"Someday, people won't marvel
at the accomplishments of Califor
nia head coach Todd Bozeman. As
he seems destined to one day be es
tablished as one of the finest coach
es of his era in college basketball,
the things he is doing now won't
seem so remarkable."
If only they knew.

Mike Montgomery can attest that
good can triumph over evil. And as
for Bozeman, there's ahvays the
NAIA.
