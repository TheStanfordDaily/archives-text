# Bad news, Bears
## Don't pity Kasser 
### 
John Kasser can't be a happy
man. First the California ath
letic director goes through
three football coaches in 18 months
as the Golden Bears lose consecu
tive Big Games while his women's
basketball program is mired in the
conference cellar along with his
baseball team. And now his men's
basketball team is on probation.
But as a Stanford-affiliated per
son, it's hard to have sympathy for
him. Maybe the NCAA says Cal did
everything it could to rectify the sit
uation, as Kasser says, but dis
graced former men's basketball
coach Todd Bozeman was there
until Cal had a losing season. If the
Golden Bears did in 1995-96 what
they did last year under Ben Braun,
would Bozeman even have been un

Everybody at Cal seems shocked

Outsiders saw it from a mile away.
And throw out the scum â€” for all
that talent he enlisted, he just
couldn't coach. His strategy and
conduct in game situations made
Stanford people even more grateful
for Mike Montgomery. Bozeman
was a boy in a man's job, and one
obviously with a lot of money at his

disposal. But Cal didn't notice.
So suppose the university didn't
know he was dishing out dough to
Jelani Gardner's parents mot to
sound holier than thou, but can you
imagine that happening here?).
Does that make it any better?
What would happen to Ted Le
land if Tara VanDerveer was dish
ing out large sums of cash to John
Edgar Wideman to lure his daugh
ter Jamila here? Adios, Ted.
Now Iceland didn't hire Van-
Derveer, and Kasser joined Cal in
early 1994, after Bozeman replaced
Lou Campanelli in a ballyhooed
midseason coaching change. But
Bozeman stayed on as permanent
head coach for one year under
Kasser's regime. And Kasser gave
