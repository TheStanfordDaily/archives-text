# Stanford sends three to field hockey's Jr. World Cup team
## 
### Allison Otto Editorial staff 
The summer just got a little
longer for three members of the
Stanford women's field hockey
team.
Junior forward/midfielders
Sarah Medeiros and Carey Cloyd
and midfielder Justina Williams
were selected to participate on
the 1997 U.S. Junior World Cup
team.
The threesome, who repre
sent the greatest number of
players selected from any one
school in the country, will join 18
other American, athletes for the
competition Sept. 1-14 at the
Olympic Stadium in Seoul,
South Korea.
"I am extremely proud and

excited that these three players
have been selected to play on the
Junior World Cup Team," said
Stanford head coach Sheryl
Johnson. "Their selection really
speaks to the strength of our
program and their dedication to
field hockey."
Together, the team members
present a powerful triad. Cloyd,
who led the Cardinal last year in
scoring with six goals and five as
sists, was named to the 1996 All-
Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence team and earned Regional
All-American honors in 1996.
Medeiros, a 1996 All-NorPac
player, netted two goals and three
assists last season, while Williams
joins the World Cup team after
two impressive seasons on the
Farm.

All three will travel to Seoul
in late August. They will miss
the first four games of the Stan
ford season, but are expected to
return in time for the Cardinal's
Sept. 17 game at St. Louis, which
kicks off a four-game, five-dav
stay.
Austin's roll ebbs
When it rains, it pours. And
Stanford junior pitcher Jeff
Austin's recent sweltering sum
mertime streak for USA Base
ball suffered its first thunder
storm in a matchup against the
Australian national team Tues
day.
Facing off against the right
handed Austin at Victory Field
in Indianapolis, the Australians
grabbed the lead in the fourth
inning, notching four runs on six
hits to bring the score to 6-2. The
Americans tallied a run in the
bottom half of the frame, cutting
the lead to three before Austin
retired for the evening.
For the remainder of the
team, however, the night had
only just begun. The Americans
rallied in the bottom of the sev
enth and secured an 11-7 win,
their sixth straight victory over
the Australians.
Austin, who leads the team in
innings pitched at 27, and junior
outfielder Jody Gerut, who has
seen limited action this summer,
will face off against the Aus
tralians today at Millington Sta
dium in Millington, Tenn.
Table tennis stars reunite at
Maples
In 1971 an improbable team
of ambassadors convened at the
table. The pingpong table, that
is.
"Pingpong diplomacy" will be
relived Sunday at 6 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion in a silver an
niversary rematch between top
Northern California players and
the 1997 Chinese national team.
In the first volley in a game of
high-stakes negotiations that
ended the Cold War between the
U.S. and China, a team of U.S.
pingpong players were invited to
tour China in a series of "Friend
ship First" matches. The follow
ing year the Chinese team recip
rocated with a tour of the U.S.
The final match was held before
a standing-room-only crowd at
Maples.
Stanford alumnus Robert
Shur, who played at Maples as a
student in the 1972 games, will
return to stage a rematch
against former Chinese champi
on Liang Geliang.
