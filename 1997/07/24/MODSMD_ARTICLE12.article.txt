## Giving Enrique Chagoya A Hand: The
						Stanford Gallery transformed into Cannibal Island 
### 
Unfortunately, in these times when
artwork is tagged with descriptions
of "angry" or "political," it generally
seems that these are intended pejoratively,
to devalue the art. But Enrique Chagoya's
recent exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery reflects a series of work which is
"angr" and "political," and this is meant in
the most applauding way.
The politically-conscious energy of
Chagoya's work marks him as a critically
reflective artist and social commentator.
The work presented in this current exhibi
tion, "Insula Canibalium: Paintings and
Works on Paper," is innovative and com
pelling. It is a well-balanced mix of overtly
political statements and more subtle weav
ings, the intricate patterns of which emerge
as the body of work is viewed again and
again — something well-merited.
The source for the show's title is ex
plained in the wall text as a label from a
16th century Italian print "that depicts the
activities of the indigenous peoples of Cen
tral America." "Insula Canibalium" trans
lates to "Cannibal Island," as is also ex
plained. Immediately, in his naming of the
exhibition, Chagoya takes us into a world of
'translation' from historical sources. While
this is directly rendered from the foreign
title to the explicative wall text, Chagoya
also maneuvers in more subtle and subver
sive ways; his works are each a 'translation'
of history for people misjudged, misrepre
sented and generally silenced in traditional
recorded history, into a new tongue which
allows expression. From historical Euro
pean sources, Chagoya takes us into a world
which benefits from less traditional repre
sentation: that of the indigenous and the
colonized, the over-powered who, as
Chagoya brings them voice through his
work, refuse to be eternally defeated.
Chagoya's 1990 "Thesis/Antithesis" of
charcoal and pastel on paper presents itself
in the center of the gallery. It is a display of
polarities, of a precarious balancing act, two
feet in black shoes perched on two bare red
feet, emerging from the bottom of the
frame. Also in contradiction are two black
and red fingers, each pointing to the other,
perhaps accusingly; like the feet, it is un
clear where fault in this cycle of blame
should be placed, if at all. Whet her the shod
feet represent an oppressive burden, or if
they leave the red ones stronger for bearing
them — perhaps both. It would seem that
any argument which could be made must
necessarily integrate all opposing elements
and understand them as depending on one
another.
In his wall text Chagoya himself states:
"The art becomes a product of collisions be
tween historical visions and dominant par
adigms—a thesis and antithesis that end in
a synthesis in the mind of the viewer."
Borrowing an apt trope and using it to
power his argument, Chagoya presents sev
eral palimpsest-type images, which com
prise the majority of "Insula Canibalium."
In other words, for his surfaces, the artist
chooses historical materials which retain
the stories of where they have come from.
In a later wall text, Chagoya explains that
the displayed prints are drawn from his
most recent series, made up of fifty 19th
century European prints then used for ed
ucational purposes. Painted directly over

these prints, and ranging from leaving
them mostly visible to much greater obscu
rity, Chagoya makes the 'education' they
once provided into a multi-layered disci
pline: one must read the underlying histor
ical record literally through and often
around the subversive impositions.
Within the gallery, one of the first of this
series presented is entitled "The Death of
Columbus," from 1997. Displayed as a two
page fold opened up, on one side is the visu
al image and on the other, the explanatory
text. A loaded mingling of representations
of this controversial historical figure and
the artist's ghoulish figures and iconic sym
bols, the image obviously speaks to the less
er addressed issues migration and immigra
tion. Imprinted on the spine is a logo with
the text: "The Wetback Menace: Drastic Ac
tion Imperative to Halt Dangerous Threat
to American Security and Labor at Mexican
Border." Through his layered method of
historical interpretation, Chagoya is able to
understand contemporary Mexican-Ameri
can border issues through the lens of a fur
ther recessed historical moment. Perhaps
he is insinuating that our problems today
can at least partially be attributed to the
domineering nationalistic attitude repre
sented by this past moment, through its
icon.
One of the powers of Chagoya's work lies
in his own army of icons which he carries
and plants repeatedly; with each use, each
icon seems to take up more space within the
image, as it carries with it a history of hav
ing been seen elsewhere. Within this partic
ular exhibition, the use of disembodied body
parts is prevalent. As presented in large
scale and as a greeting at the gallery's en
trance "Thesis/Antithesis" itself presents
the sets of feet and the hands, each without
an attributable source. Throughout the ex
hibit such hands may appear on the border
of the page of one print, a heart in the mid
dle of another. Incomplete bodies, bodies in
pieces, become thematic on this "Cannibal
Island."
In"The Vintage Festival" — also a
painting on a 19th century print — a geom
etry of hearts connected to each other
through a series of veins wraps throughout
the pre-existing image, painted grapes
super-imposed over the figures' heads. And
a bandage is taped onto one corner, a token
remedy for these evicted body parts. An
image such as this one seems to align the
disembodied elements with those people
dispossessed bv these 19th century 'educa
tional' texts; each is forced to float through,
merely touch upon, the imprinted and
therefore permanent records. An image
such as "The Vintage Festival" represents a
network of dispossession, if looked at in this
light. Many have come together to chal
lenge the existing text which, it would seem
to suggest, has a contemporary bearing on
the controversies surrounding the tainted
politics of local grape harvesting.
Another such image of union is "Jesus at
the House of Simon," where it appears as
though the singular feet from previous im
ages have all paraded over and amassed at
the periphery of this image, and then
walked through together. In quite an auda
cious display, the feet walk straight across
the dinner table, infiltrating the religious
scene. One marked difference between this

image and some of the others of this series
is that in this one, the text is almost com
pletely painted over, whereas in most oth
ers it is left readable. As the collection of
feet march through in seeming protest,
they annihilate almost all of what has been
there before them.
It becomes clear that there is no singular
culmination in Chagoya's history-treading
process; it is on-going and each moment
holds weight. And as Chagoya's icons ap
pear again and again over time, patterns
begin to emerge between the separate mo
ments. One of the last images in the gallery
is "Recurrent Xenophobic Nightmare"
from 1995, acrylic and oil on amate paper.
In a much more overt display, a group of
darker skinned people, presumably "na
tives," cannibalize large limbs. Here the
disembodied parts again appear, but in this
case it is the colonial figure who is victim.
Bringing this 'nightmare' to light in a very
over-the-top manner, Chagoya demon
strates the absurdity of it.
Refreshingly, Chagoya's work is not
overly didactic. Rather, it encourages criti
cal inquiry. Much of this stems from the
fact that he does not deal in simple issues,

nor does he deal with his issues in a simple
manner. The work is built on the tension
first presented in "Thesis/Antithesis," in
both the image and the title. To integrate
the many, and often contradictory, layers of
historical vision is to try and achieve even a
momentary synthesis. Perhaps this is all
that can be demanded — this impermanent
fusion — before another layer is excavated
or another added on. The balance again
shifts.
