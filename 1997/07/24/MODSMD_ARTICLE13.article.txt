# Sex, Drugs and Money:
## The 						California Shakespeare Festival puts on "Pericles" 
### 
While Shakespeare hailed from
Stratford, England, his legacy is
alive and well in Orinda, California.
At the Bruns Memorial Amphithe
atre, the California Shakespeare
Festival offers outstanding perfor
mances just an hour's drive away
from Palo Alto.
" Pericles," the second offering in
the Festival's 1997 season, is a live
ly romance complete with a series of
sea voyages, separations, escapes,
and reunions.
The production, directed by
Roger DeLaurier, transports us
into a fantastical world in which a
queen emerges alive from her cof
fin. an alleged prostitute imparts
morality to her clients, and a
stranger in a loincloth captures the
heart of a princess.
DeLaurier regards "Pericles" as
an "epic journey from innocence to
experience to innocence regained.
It is a root parable, or a fable about
our life in time — neither comedy
nor tragedy in itself, but with the el
ements of both. It is about faith in
what time will bring; the possibility
of reunion, reconciliation and re
demption," (press release).
The Orinda production responds
capably to the challenges of staging
this "epic journey." The scope of the
play is vast — spanning six eastern
Mediterranean localities and detail
ing the triumphs and plights of sev
eral generations of heroes and hero
ines.
The exotic flavor of the play is
conjured up vividly through imagi
native costume design (turbans,
masks, revealing harem attire,
even a Super Size hookah in a
bawdy house scene), alternately
soothing and chilling music (featur
mg instruments ranging from
drums to a sitar to a shakuhachi
flute) and evocative lighting acutely
attuned to respond to each wrinkle
in the plot.
As the title suggests, the play
truly does revolve around the vicis
situdes of fortune the protagonist
experiences. Remi Sandri's Pericles
is noble, tenacious, and charismat
ic. His powerful presence domi
nates the stage. Even in the scenes
in which he does not appear, his
spirit seems to preside over the ac
tion — surfacing in his daughter
Marina's determined preservation

of her virtue even in a house of pros
titution ("If fires be hot, knives
sharp, or waters deep,/ Untied I
still my virgin knot will keep") and
his servant Helicanus's avowals of
uncompromising loyalty.
While Sandri conveys the moral
strength of Pericles, he also ac
knowledges the character's vulner
ability. His performance reflects
the consternation of a man torn be
tween desire and reason, the an
guish of one who does what must be
done and endures. We shudder with
Pericles at the injustice of his wife's
untimely death:
"O you gods! / Why do you make
us love your goodly gifts/And
snatch them straight away?"
And yet, soon afler he is forced to
cast the body of his wife overboard,
Pericles appears determined to ac
cept his fate, resolving that "the
end must be as 'tis." Sandri's Peri

cles is morally upright without
growing annoying. He never disin
tegrates into the stock hero, but re
mains throughout a complex, in
triguing individual.
As the one-woman Chorus,
Lynne Softer represents an alluring
force who navigates our journey
through the mystical landscapes.
Through her intervention, the
episodic materials of the play co
here in a unified point of view.
Other striking performances in
clude Kay Kostopoulos as Dionyza,
a jealous queen who orders the
murder of Marina, Peter J. Macon
as Antiochus, the incestuous King
of Antioch, and W. Francis Walters
as Simonides, Thaisa's kindly, dot
ing father.
Walters provides one of the most
amusing moments on-stage by in
terrupting his daughter's sensual
dancing with Pericles with the com

mand to "Unclasp!" He parts the
lovers with all the vehement insis
tence of a chaperone at a high
school prom.
The rare scenes in which the per
formance takes on a disingenuous,
mechanical feel result from a lack of
credible chemistry between Peri
cles and Thaisa. As the young
Thaisa, Lisa Porter is more plod
ding than playful. Eyelid batting
and hair tossing triumph over more
understated acting devices.
Porter's performance improves
tremendously when she appears
near the end of the play as an older
Thaisa miraculously preserved
from death to be reunited with her
husband. Even though the reunion
scene is relatively brief, the affec
tion between the two seems much
more palpable than in the preced
ing courtship exchanges.
As the daughter of Pericles and

Thaisa (horn on a ship and aptly
named Marina), Melanie Hermann
delivers a somewhat static perfor
mance. She maintains nearly the
same demeanor when picking flow
ers as when confronting a would-be
murderer. We are never struck by
the desperation of her circum
stances as we are with Pericles.
Like Porter, however, her perfor
mance becomes more compelling
towards the play's conclusion
The touching acting and staging
of "Pericles'" final scenes represent
a fitting conclusion for a play that,
for all of its tragic element s, t.s ulti
