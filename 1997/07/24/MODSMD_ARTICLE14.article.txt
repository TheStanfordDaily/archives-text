## Elise Lipkowitz Cultural baggage 
### 
WHEN I WAS growing up,
my mother used to say
that "good things come
in small packages." And being a
typical teenager, 1 brushed her
statement aside. It was clearly a
poor attempt to rationalize the
fact that neither she nor I. at 5-
foot-3 and 5-foot-4 respectively,
could reach the top shelf of the
kitchen cabinets without stand
ing on a chair.
Yet since I arrived in Japan
four weeks ago for a summer lan
guage study / homestay program,
that pithy phrase that I once so
nonchalantly dismissed has
gained new prominence in my
thoughts. As 1 explore the north
ern port city of Hakodate, my new
homo away from home, I am
-•trucK bv how much more there is
to what mom was saying than 1
>ver realized as a middle school
student. From mini-cars and tinv
homes to Pepsi cans that redefine
small and the three-quarters of a
centimeter long staples dispensed
from my host family's stapler, my
vorld has come to exist in minia
ture. And I'm loving it.
Last weekend I went with mv
host family to a flower show in
Hakodate. Though the flowers
were very artfully arranged, I
was most taken by the simple ele
gance of a blanket that had been
folded in the shape of a fan. And
that was not an isolated incident.
I now find myself staring at the
geometric designs on soup bowls
and tea cups rather than sum
marily consuming their contents.
Indeed, the Japanese have a flair
for making the small and ordi
nary into an art; my host mother
even insists on having foods of at
least five different colors on every
plate she serves. I also love the
cozy feel of our immaculately
clean little house in which every
bit of space is used efficiently.
And I don't really miss the spa
ciousness of the typical American
room. After all. any college stu
dent on move-out day can tell you
that clutter will fill as much space
as is available.
Yet the more time I spend here
in Japan, the more I realize how
deeply my initial reaction to my
mom's statement that "good
things come in small packages"
was shaped by American cultural
values. I've come to realize that
size is truly an American obses
sion. It seems that we are pro
grammed almost from birth to
prefer Range Rovers over Volk
swagen minis, a two story house
on three quarters of an acre over
a studio apartment, and to regard
tall and lean Harrison Ford as
sexier than Danny DeVito. In
America, si/e is equated with sta
tus. comfort and beauty. Posses
sion of a 32-inch color television,
an Olympic-sized swimming pool
and a Cadillac is perceived as the
id* al towards which we should
strive. Even the fact that we use

the expression "good things come
in small packages" suggests how
counterintuitive such a notion is
in our society.
Regardless of whether or not
we realize that we are size-con
scious, it is an image that we have
projected abroad through televi
sion, movies, music and the inor
dinately large amount of luggage
we bring wherever we go. And
such an image has a profound ef
fect on how we are viewed by for
eigners. I had been at my host
family's comfortable home barely
two minutes before my host
mother began apologizing pro
fusely for the modest size of her
home. While the Japanese cultur
al emphasis on humility probably
played a small role in triggering
such a statement, her remark also
reflected her concern for how I,
an American with lots of luggage,
would perceive my new home.
After all. she had no way of know
ing whether or not my home was
something out of "Beverly Hills
90210."
Part of gaining appreciation
for the beauties of the small and
commonplace that I'm finding all
over Japan involves recognizing
my American cultural baggage —
that innate construct that bigger
is better. While I've certainly
come to love the simple elegance
of tiny objects, I 'd be lying if I said
that I don't secretly chuckle at
the fact that people tell me I'm
tall or that I didn't think it was
strange when I saw a television
commercial featuring Scottie Pip
pin endorsing a Mazda mini-car.
As a product of a particular cul
ture, I can't help but have these
instinctual reactions. But what I
can do is to try to understand the
cultural roots of these reactions
and place them in a perspective
that enables me to appreciate
other cultures' values and prac
tices.
Somehow 1 don't think we will
see Scottie Pippin endorsing
Mazda mini-cars on American
television anytime soon. But in
our society where big is better, it
can't hurt to cultivate an appreci
ation for the small simple beau
ties of life. The Japanese are a
prime example of a culture in
which a reverence for simple
beauty exists simultaneously
with a desire for larger homes, ve
hicles, etc. And it appears that
having these two perspectives
may be healthier than the almost
exclusive premium Americans
place on bigness.
And Mom. thanks, you were
right. Good things do come in
small packages.
