# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## Home's where the wild things are 
### 
MY DAI) OFTEN jokes about
going away to college and
returning home for the
summer, only to find that his fami
ly had moved. The joke, he says, is
that first he left home, and then
home left him.
Of course, Dad knew his family
was leaving Los Angeles for Ari
zona, but he always made it sound
like he came home one day after fi
nals to find the locks changed and a
new family eating dinner at his din
ing room table. It was supposed to
be a funny story, but for some rea
son it always scared me. What if 1
try to go home someday, I thought,
and home isn't there anymore?
My fears came true last week. I
had a horrible day, one where
everything and everyone I know in
Boise seemed to turn on me all at
once. I was tired, battered and
ready to collapse into a void of self
deprecation. I really needed a place
to feel safe for awhile, somewhere
to hide out until the dark clouds
p;issed and I was ready to face the
world again, like my bedroom in
Oregon or Alondra room 300 at
Stanford. But for the first time in
my life. 1 had nowhere to go.
None of the familiar places in
Boise — the office, my rented room,
even the Episcopal church down
the street — offered me any com
fort. Only my brother, who was vis
iting me for the week, saved me
from a deep depression. He lis
tened. he hugged me. he let me vent
mv frustrations. But despite all his
efforts, he couldn't give me that
safe place to hide.
! finallv found that place, that

home, on a camping trip a few days
later. Dan and I met our parents
(who, in typical mid-life crisis fash
ion, were motorcycling through
Montana) in Idaho's Sawtoothed
Mountains for an extended week
end of relaxed "roughing it." The
rugged mountains cut by a clear
swift river provided some of the
most fantastic scenery I had ever
laid eyes upon, and my family set
out to enjoy every glorious minute
we had to spend there. We hiked,
we swam, we slept in tents and
roasted marsh mallows over the
evening fire. It was a good old-fash
ioned Tankersley family vacation,
something straight out of a child
hood memory.
When Dan and I were growing
up. our family went camping every
year. We took our ragged green tent
to countless mountain lakes all
across Oregon, and over the years
"summer" and "camping" became
almost synonymous in my mind. It
shouldn't have surprised me then
when I sat down next to the camp
fire the first night in the Saw-tootbs
and felt the inner peace and securi
ty that only "home" can provide.
I reflected on the feeling, think
ing back to the last time I was in a
new place: the start of college near
ly a year ago. Then, I was leaving my
house and family to live on my own
for the first time. But it didn't take
long to feel like my natural resting
place was in Alondra. with sixty
other freshmen who had left their
homes and their families to embark
upon the same adventure that I had.
1 realized that losing sight of home
is a Droblem that most collegc stu

dents encounter, and I can remem
ber several winter quarter conver
sations about the first time my
friends and I had slipped and called
our dorm rooms "home".
Now, more than ever, I don't see
home as a physical place. Locations
only remind us of the comfort we
associate with them. I don't really
miss my bedroom for its yellow
shag carpeting and Steve Sax
posters on the wall, or my dorm for
its asbestos ceiling and funny smell.
I miss doing AP history reading in
my brown easy chair, talking on the
phone until 3 a.m. and playing Nin
tendo on my parents' television. I
miss hanging out with my girl
friend. popping in on the guys down
the hall and staying up all night
cramming for statistics. I don't
have any good memories to associ
ate with places in Boise, and so the
comfort is not there.
For three splendid days, though,
I felt safe. Even in a mountain
range I had never visited, the pure
nostalgia of camping wrapped me
in a warm, comforting blanket. I
felt the love of my family, and re
membered that regardless of how
things turn out here. I have a caring
environment waiting for me.
They say you can never go home
again, but I think you just have to
know where to look for it. First, you
leave home. But home never leaves
you. You just have to be reminded
where it is. and sometimes, that's
where the wild things are.

In time, sophomore Jim Tankersley
will also come to call the Daily of
fices "home."
