## Afterburner races to third-place finish Solar car, a joint Stanford-Berkeley project, improves record in annual Sunrayce 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing write 
Stanford and UC-Berkeley stu
dents joined forces to place third ir
Sunrayce '97, a nine-day, 1,200
mile solar car race that follows t
route from Indianapolis to Col
orado Springs.
Thirty-six college team.s racec
from one checkpoint to another
accumulating times each day frorr
June 19 to 28. The total of the daih
times determined the winner.
The Stanford car, Afterburner
is the creation of the Stanford
Berkeley Solar Car Rayce Projecl
and is funded in part by grants
from Stanford's School of Kngi
neering. Afterburner runs on nine
car batteries, which are charged bj
solar cells on the car.
During the race, the car was dri
ven by one of four drivers. Othei
members of the 18-person tean
rode in a lead car and warned ol
bumps and turns in the road, whik
the rest of the team rode in a chast
car and monitored battery current
and voltage.
"This year's third place is a sig
nificant improvement from 1995't
fifth-place finish," said Dorian
West, a coterminal student in me
chanical engineering who partici
pated in both races. He explained
that the improvement was due pri
marily to a new shell and new solar
cells.
The team suffered a setback at
the starting line on the fifth day,
when the car would not start. After
a half-hour of frantic searching,
the team found an easily repairable

blown fuse.
"We kicked ourselves after
ward," said sophomore Judy Lieb
man, one of the car's drivers.
According to West, that break
down may have cost the team first
place. Afterburner finished just 50
minutes behind the winning car in
the 30-hour race. Regardless, he
noted, "90 percent of our enjoy
ment this year was that we had a
really great car that was capable of
winning."
West explained that Sunrayce
rewards the most reliable cars that

break down the least.
"You start to get really paranoid
about 10 minutes here and five
minutes there of lost time," he
said. He also explained that com
petitors are forbidden from going
the highway speed limit, which is
65 mph most of the way, and are
limited to 55 mph.
This restriction hurt the Stan
ford car, which can run on very lit
tle power and still reach speeds of
up to 70 mph, according to West.
The winning car was reliable
and broke down only once, but it

was also less aerodynamic, slower,
heavier and used up all its power
each day of the race, West noted.
"We stiil had 20 to 30 percent of
charge left each day,"he said.
After the race, team members
fulfilled a pledge they'd made part
way through. The men shaved
their heads, and the women dyed
their hair red.
Although Sunrayce was origi
nally thought to end the project's
competition year, the team re
ceived an unexpected invitation to
compete in the FLA Electro Solar

Cup in Japan this August. The in
vitation came when the MIT car,
which was the original selection
for the competition, crashed.
The Afterburner has since been
shipped to Japan and the team is
awaiting the chance to race against
other university and corporate
teams. They invited the MIT team
to come along as team members
but have not yet heard replies.
"One of our biggest goals now is
to have a lot of fun," said Liebman.
"The car is going to do as well as
it's going to do."
