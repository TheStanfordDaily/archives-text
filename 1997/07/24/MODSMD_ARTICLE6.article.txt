Summer burglars are on the prowl
Since the end of June, there has been a series of thefts
all over campus. "There has been a definite trend of thefts
since the summer conferences began," Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said. "There are a lot of kids on
campus now."
Most of the thefts have involved the breaking in and
stealing of goods in vending machines owned by two com
panies, Reliable and Canteen Corp. Fourteen such inci
dents have occurred, often with hundreds of dollars stolen
each time. Most of the crimes were committed in dormi
tories such as Wilbur, Branner and Roble halls, but some
office buildings also have been targeted.
A disproportionate number of thefts have taken place
at or around the Gilbert Biological Sciences Building.
Niemeyer said computers, including one from a profes
sor's office, and bikes have been taken. The police cur
rently are investigating the thefts; they have put up warn
ing fliers in the general vicinity.
In addition, several people have been caught trespass
ing in the faculty complexes, Niemeyer said.
Bookstore fraud trial postponed again
Three former Stanford Bookstore managers accused of
grand theft and tax evasion received a continuance in
their Santa Clara County trial.

Hearings have been delayed several times in the case
against former Bookstore General Manager Eldon Speed,
Asst. General Manager Philip Chiaramonte and Con
troller Patrick McDonald, which arose after a 1992 Daily
story uncovered that Bookstore managers were enjoying
perquisites unheard of at other university bookstores.
Justice W. M. Cain granted the defendants' request at
the latest hearing on Monday. The next hearing is sched
uled for Oct. 1 at 9 a.m.
Fire ravages field near museum
California's summer drought helped fuel a grass fire in
a field next to the Stanford Museum.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer,
the fire broke out in the brush near the intersection of
Museum Way and Palm Drive around 3:55 p.m. on July
17. The fire was able to consume two acres of vegetation
before being extinguished by Palo Alto fire fighters.
Niemeyer said the origin of the fire is unknown but the
fire department suspects it was accidentally set off by con
struction workers, who were using torches in the area.
Stanford Barn increases security
The Stanford Barn has installed new motion-sensor
lights in its courtyard following a number of plant thefts
that occurred in May and June.

Over a period of three weekends, 17 giant rose bushes
and several azalea bushes were dug out of the courtyard
and surrounding areas, the San Francisco Chronicle re
ported. Two large terra cotta planters were also removed.
The thefts were reported to the Palo Alto Police De
partment, and the missing plants have since been re
placed.
Sand Hill alternative goes to voters
Mid-Peninsula Action for Tomorrow, a group of Palo
Alto and Menlo Park residents, has obtained enough sig
natures to put an alternate proposal to Stanford's Sand
Hill development project on the November ballot.
Amid concerns about destruction of open space and in
creases in traffic congestion, MPACT collected more than
the 2,207 signatures necessary to send its initiative to vot
ers. '1 he measure calls for retaining current limits on ex
pansion of the Stanford Shopping Center, as well as main
taining Sand Hill Road's current two-lane configuration
and preserving Ohlone Field as open space.
I he alternative will be competing on the ballot with an
official agreement reached between Stanford and the Palo
Alto City Council, which was approved on June 30.
Stanford Government and Community Relations Di
rector Larry Horton has said Stanford will not proceed
with development plans if MPACT's proposal is approved.
