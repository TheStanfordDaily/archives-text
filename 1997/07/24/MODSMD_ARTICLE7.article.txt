# Cyclists strike back with Critical Mass
##

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
It's a car-eat-bike world out
there. Bicyclists in San Francis
co and other cities need only
raise their pant legs to prove it.
"Sometimes when I get to
work, I say a prayer: 'Thank
God I made it to work in one
piece,' " said legal secretary
Chris Coopey, who has a hefty
scar on her calf from a losing en
counter with a car and has faced
everything from insults to a pis
tol-packing BMW driver who or
dered her onto the sidewalk.
Now she and other two
wheelers have found a way to
strike back.
They call it Critical Mass, a
monthly bike ride that started
in the city in 1992 with 40 peo
ple and last month drew more
than 3,000. Now there are Crit
ical Mass rides worldwide, from
Seattle to Sydney, Australia,
and Boston to Bergen, Norway.
The goal is to create frustra
tion for motorists and give them
a taste of what cyclists say they
experience every day.
Nowhere, however, has it
been as huge — or as trouble
some — as San Francisco.
"Critical Mass has reached
critical mass," Mayor Willie
Brown says. "Enough is
enough."
Brown and others say Criti
cal Mass has become a traffic
mess. The ride often requires
more than 40 police officers to
patrol it at a cost to the city of
$7,000 a ride.
Initially, the mayor ordered a
crackdown on tomorrow's
event, threatening to enforce all
traffic laws and keep bicyclists
off the sidewalk. But he and the
bicyclists later worked out a
compromise.

The crackdown was an
abrupt change in policy for the
city, which has had an if-you
can't-beat-'em-join-'em atti
tude about Critical Mass (and
plenty of other things, too). Po
lice had even allowed the swarm
of bikers to run traffic lights to
quicken the pace.
But the resulting traffic jams
have many motorists in an up
roar.
"If they don't straighten up,
I'm against them," Ulyssies
Moore, a limousine company
owner, said of the renegade bi
cyclists.
Police have all but crunched
Critical Mass in other cities. In
Tucson, Ariz., a few cyclists
were arrested two years ago
after they dropped their bikes
and blocked an intersection.
"This is not San Francisco.
People here are not used to stuff
like that," says Kim Young, a
coordinator for Bicycle Inter-
Community Action and Sal
vage, a Tucson nonprofit orga
nization that refurbishes used
bikes and donates them
throughout Arizona and Mexi
co.
Earlier this year in Seattle,
there were similar arrests. An
other ride followed in an at
tempt to undo the damage.
In San Francisco, one bicy
clist characterized Critical Mass
as "60 percent recreational rid
ers, 20 percent activists and 20
percent total wackos."
In a bid for peace with City
Hall, the San Francisco Bicycle
Coalition has tried to dispel the
notion that the average bicyclist
is a lawbreaking freak and has
worked with the city to solve
problems caused by Critical
Mass.
