# Alumni trek to North Pole
## 
### 
A fundamental driver of man's need to learn is his
desire to explore, and the "holy grail" of exploration
for many has been the North Pole.
Until a century ago, no human had ever set foot at
90 degrees north — despite attempts by some of the
world's greatest explorers. But Saturday, a group of
Stanford alumni are expected to join the select group
of explorers who have succeeded — they will stand on
that utterly pristine part of the planet.
The trip is the two-week North Pole Expedition,
run by the Alumni Association's Travel-Study Pro
gram. The travelers left July 17 and will return Aug. 2.
One of the nearly 50 trips orchestrated by the
Travel-Study Program each year, the North Pole Ex
pedition is one of only six university-sponsored trips
ever to the Arctic.
This year's trip involves 34 Stanford participants,
along with some from the Smithsonian Institution
and USC. The group will travel aboard the Sovetskiu
Soyuz, a 75,000-horsepower Russian nuclear ice
breaker, one of only three ships in the world capable
of reaching the North Pole. The itinerary includes ex
ploration of the Russian Arctic, visits historical geo
logical sites and stations and views of breathtaking ice
caps and rare Arctic wildlife.
Unlike the treacherous expeditions to the North
Pole made by past explorers, this trip will present no
hardships for the Stanford group. Utilizing the excep
tional power of the Sovetskiu Soyuz, the group will
cut through the polar ice cap instead of over it. The
ship also provides luxury accommodations and an on
board hospital, stalled by two physicians — one Russ
ian and one an American Stanford alum. Land explo
rations are aided by two helicopters.
The trip started in Helsinki, Finland, and contin
ued to Murmansk, Russia, where the group boarded
ship. The Sovetskiu Soyuz crossed the Barents Sea en
route to the Franz Josef Land islands, an Arctic arch
ipelago rich in wildlife.
At Cape Norway, the group visited the historic
camp of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen.
After cutting through the North Pole ice caps, the
group will arrive at the North Pole, where a barbecue
is scheduled on the ice, followed by the "polar plunge"
— a quick dip in the Arctic Ocean.
The return trip runs through the Novaya Zemlya
islands and Vailgech Island before arriving back at
Murmansk. Over the course of the voyage the group
should see a variety of wildlife, such as polar bears,

Arctic foxes, Pacific walruses, seals and Beluga
whales. Birds such as puffins, kittiwakes, murres and
gulls also are abundant.
Like each of the trips provided by the Travel-
Study Program, the North Pole Expedition is staffed
by a Stanford faculty. Biology Prof. Craig Heller, who
heads the trip's faculty, specializes in the neurobiol
ogy of sleep, biological rhythms and thermoregula
tion. He has led trips to Antarctica, Alaska, the Cana
dian Arctic, the Galapagos Island, India and the Sea
of Cortez.
During the expedition he is lecturing on animals of
the high Arctic and their adaptation to life in the cold.
The group will learn about the biology of sleep, bio
logical rhythms, animal migration and navigation and
the deep sleep of hibernation.
Heller is aided by Prof. Mikhail Grosswald of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, a geologist.
Yar Petryszyn, associate curator of the mammal col
lection at the University of Arizona, will lecture on
ozone depletion and global warming. Beau Riffen
burgh from Cambridge University, an expert on the
history of Arctic explorations, and Gordon Smith, pro
fessor of government and international studies at the
University of South Carolina, who specializes in Russ
ian politics and law, round out the lecture team.
This year's trip will be the second conducted by the
Travel-Study Program to the North Pole. The first
North Pole Expedition was held in 1992; eighty Stan
ford alumni attended. The experience was a memo
rable one for the group. Program coordinator I leather
Johnston Fessler said the sight and experience of the
immense, open isolation left the group in awe.
That's an accurate description, said Sue Mathew
son, Class of '57, who attended the 1992 Expedition.
Mathewson described the ship as "magnificent" and
said the captain's "open-bridge" policy allowed her
and some others to steer the icebreaker through ice,
an experience she will never forget.
The best part of the trip for Mathewson, though,
was the chance to meet the Russian people. The
Sovetskiu Soyuz has a crew of 140 Russians to serve
98 passengers.
"It was my first real contact with the Russians, and
they were wonderful," Mathewson said. She recalled
volleyball games with the Russian women, picnics on
ice caps and conversations with the captain. "My
memory of the Russian people was definitely the best
part of the trip."
