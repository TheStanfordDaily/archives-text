# VanDerveer fills coaching staff with former Illinois star
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
It was a busy week for coaches in the
VanDerveer family.
.Just two days after Heidi VanDerveer
was named head coach of the WNBA's
Sacramento Monarchs, her sister Tara
filled the final vacancy on her staff at Stan
ford. Tonya Booker, a former point guard at
Illinois and coach at Clemson, was appoint
ed to VanDerveer's trio of assistant coaches
yesterday.
Booker "is very enthusiastic and has a
great love for the game," Tara VanDerveer
said. "Tonya is an outstanding addition to
the program."
Booker joins longtime associate head
coach Amy Tucker and Karen Middleton,
who served last year as an assistant to Heidi

VanDerveer at Eastern Washington and
was hired earlier in the offseason.
Booker and Middleton replace Angela
Taylor and Ann Enthoven. Enthoven and
her husband Nick are expecting their first
child later this year, and Taylor is now
player-personnel director for the WNBA.
Hinch tearing up minors
While the year has been difficult for
Stanford stars in the miyor leagues, A.J.
Hinch is proving the trend doesn't hold true
for those in the minors.
The Ail-American catcher, who graduat
ed in 1996, was drafted in the third round by
the Oakland Athletics. After starting this
year in A ball, he was recently promoted all
the way to AAA Edmonton after iryuries to
A's catcher George Williams led to the pro
motion of Trapper starter Izzv Molina.

In nine games with the Trappers before
last night, Hinch was batting a mind-bog
gling .680 (17-for-25). The amazing start
could lead to a September call-up to the big
leagues earlier than expected for Hinch.
The rosters expand to 40 players on Sept. 1.
Other AAA players hoping for a promo
tion include first baseman David McCarty,
who is hitting .336 with a team-high 18
home runs and 75 RBIs for the Phoenix
Firebirds of the San Francisco Giants orga
nization, and Fdmonton pitchers Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine.
Adams and Lorraine, the aces of the 1994
Stanford squad, have struggled with the
Trappers. Adams is 4-3 with a 6.12 ERA in
nine starts since his demotion from Oak
land, and Lorraine is 6-7 with a 6.05 ERA in
18 starts.
Stan Spencer and Brian Keyser have led

their pitching staffs. Spencer, the co-ace of
the 1990 Cardinal squad that won a school
record 59 games, is 3-1 with a 3.56 ERA in
seven starts for the Las Vegas Stars of the
San Diego organization, and Keyser is 7-2
with three complete games and a 2.54 ERA
for the Nashville Sounds in his quest to re
turn to the Chicago White Sox.
Paul Carey, the national freshman of the
year in 1987, is hitting .216 with nine home
runs and 48 RBIs for Pawtucket, the Boston
Red Sox AAA affiliate.
A pair of recent Stanford graduates have
been slugging in AA ball. Infielder Steve
Carver, who led the 1995 squad with 77
RBIs, is hitting .274 with 14 home runs and
42 RBIs in 69 games for the Reading
Phillies, and Dusty Allen leads the Mobile
Bay Bears with 100 games played, 355 at
bats, 24 doubles, 14 home runs and 58 RBIs.
