## Jazz Workshop celebrates 25 years 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
For 25 years, Jim Nadel has spent eveiy
summer at Stanford jamming with jazz
greats.
A cofounder of the Stanford Jazz Work
shop in 1972, Nadel, a lecturer in Stanford's
Music Department, invites premier artists
to campus each summer to teach and per
form. His guests over the years have includ
ed trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and tenor sax
ophonist Stan Getz, and this year bassist
Ilay Brown is featured.
But for Nadel, an alto saxophone player,
it all gets down to enjoying and helping oth
ers enjoy the unique art form of jazz — a mu
sical expression that he said is becoming in
creasingly popular.
Jazz, Nadel said, offers a "balance of force
und fun. It can be inviting to anyone who is
willing to do some serious listening."
The flexibility and variety of the music
make it accessible as well as pleasurable.
"Good jazz has a conversational aspect — an
interplay between the musicians — that's a
delight as a listener," he explained.
Twenty-five years ago, Nadel and fellow
musician Bert Carelli organized the work
shop as a six-week long series of Monday and
Tuesday meetings. On Monday, musicians
from around the Bay Area got together for
jam sessions at Tresidder Union; on Tues
day, they discussed what they had played
and planned for the next week.
Since then, the festival has expanded to a
summer-long event with 30 performances;
camps for children, college students and
adults; master classes; and private lessons.
The number of people interested in partici
pating has increased dramatically, as has
the size of the audience, said publicist Jon
Yanofsky.
As a tribute to the silver anniversary,
Nadel and other workshop organizers chose
to add even more color to the festival with a
performance of Duke Ellington's "Black,
Brown and Beige."
The three performances of the 50-minute
show in late June — two at Stanford and one
in San Francisco — marked a revival of the
music, which Ellington performed at
Carnegie Hall in 1943 and then never again
in its entirety.
"Black, Brown and Beige" chronicles a
mythical African from his enslavement on
African soil through emancipation in Amer
ica, World War I, the birth of Harlem and
World War 11. Ellington was not generally
considered a political activist, Yanofsky
said, and the somewhat political nature of
(he piece may have been part of the reason it
was not well received at its debut.

Ellington performed parts of "Black,
Brown and Beige" later in his career, but no
complete score remained. The Stanford per
formance was based on a score compiled
from Ellington's original notes, some of
which a researcher found in the Smithson
ian Museum archives.
The Stanford Jazz Workshop recruited
drummer Louie Bellson and pianist Joe
Williams, both of whom performed with
Ellington, as part of a successful remount
ing of the piece. All three performances sold
out or came close.
Nadel, who was part of the orchestra for
"Black, Brown and Beige," recalled it as a
"high point of my musical life."
For Williams, now 78 years old, and oth
ers, the performance was "an event of great

importance," Nadel added. "For them it was
. .. among the greatest music they had ever
played."
Part of the success of the Stanford Jazz
Workshop comes from the diversity of the
music and musicians, Nadel said. In addi
tion to classic pieces like Ellington's and
even earlier music, much of what is heard
during the summers at Stanford is experi
mental. That, in turn, gives the artists and
participants something to take back with
them and teach to others. The combined
emphasis on teaching, learning and sharing
with the community has remained strong
throughout the workshop's history, Nadel
said.
Brown, one of this year's featured per
formers, has played with Gillespie, Oscar

Peterson and others during his more than
60-year career as a musician. His trio will be
performing Monday at 7:30 p.m. and Aug. 8
at 8 p.m., both times at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
In another of the few performances re
maining, Conrad Herwig offers his "The
Latin Side of John Coltrane" on Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. at Dinkelspiel.
Concerts to be held at Campbell Recital
Hall in the Braun Music Building include
Wes Montgomery tonight at 7:30, vocalist
Madeline Eastman on Saturday at 8 p.m.,
saxophonist Harvey Wainapel on Wednes
day at 7:30 p.m., and the Peter Apfelbaum
Sextet on Aug. 9 at 8 p.m.
