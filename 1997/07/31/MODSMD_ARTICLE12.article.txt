# Ford hits the sky in thriller 'Air Force One'
## 
### 
Call it nit-picking, but there seems to be
an obsession in Hollywood with film scores
that bash you over the head with the mood
of each scene. Maybe it's all the fun to be
had with fancy Dolby sound, but filmmak
ers these days seem to think that we need
to be told what to feel. It's the most dis
tracting thing about "Air Force One," an
otherwise smart and claustrophobically
suspenseful summer action movie.
Whether it's sensitive family bonding vio
lins, or evil Communist terrorist-at-large

choral march or a stirring President-as
heroic star inspirational trumpet, it's just
too much.
Nevertheless, there's a lot more to Wolf
gang Peterson's latest than the score, and
most of it is quite snazzy. Harrison Ford is,
of course, perfect (and almost believable)
as the moralistic, honest, loving, faithful,
brave President we all wish we had. He is
wonderful in scenes of desperation, espe
cially when his daughter's life is at risk.
Ford's understated pain is moving, and his

love for his family — and his country —
shines through and drives the film.
The brilliant action choreography and
the camera work within the tight space of
the plane pull the audience into the film.
Air Force One is hijacked by fanatical ter
rorists, and it's a disturbing image. The no
tion of the most secure structure in Ameri
ca being penetrable is frightening, and the
movie's balm is that the country's leader is
actually going to come to the rescue — and
does. Glenn Close as the vice-president is

convincing and occasionally funny, though
there's not enough of her and I wanted to
see more.
In a time when the integrity of the Oval
Office is questioned without cease, this film
is notable for having what seems like the
most creative and fantastical alien life form
of the summer: a Presidential hero! Seems
as improbable as archaeology being excit
ing. Thank goodness for Harrison Ford. No
wonder Clinton loves this movie.
