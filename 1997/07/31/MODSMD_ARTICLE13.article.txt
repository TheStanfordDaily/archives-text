NO ROCK 'N ROLL FOR ME
Summer's a time for big-time concerts and
wild paloozas of all kinds, but the Stanford
Summer Orchestra provided a refreshing
change (of pace, of styles, of everything) in its
big concert last Saturday. Director Giancarlo
Aquilanti started the evening with Felix
Mendelssohn's "Fingal's Cave Overture," Op.
I'll and finished with Antonin Dvorak's Sym
phony No. 8 in G Major, Op. 88. But the highlight
of the evening was the orchestra's spirited, en
ergetic performance of Aquilanti's own Con
certo per Violoncello e Orchestra, featuring a
bravura turn by cellist Alison Hu. Stanford's
summer session may be a little sleepy without
the energy of all the students and faculty, but
Dinkelspiel itself was crackling with excite
ment in a terrific show.
STANFORD ENTERTAINERS
IN THE NEWS
First Chelsea, now this. Stanford's becom
ing paparazzi paradise. The story: School's out
and so's Danny Pintauro, the former sitcom
star of the ABC series "Who's the Boss?"
I'intauro has always been open about his
sexuality at Stanford, even volunteering at the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Center
during the year, but now he's taken his open
ness one step further, doing what most actors
twice his age won't even think of doing. He's
publicly declared that he's gay in a July 15
story in the National Enquirer.
"Kveryone had already heard about it," Pin
tauro told Entertainment Weekly magazine,

which ran a cynical piece in its .Julv 25 issue
suggesting that he's come out as a way of
"bringing his career back."
Clearly they have not seen the good work
that Pintauro has done in the past three years
in such Drama Department productions as "La
Bete, Ham s Head shows like Gaieties and
Winter One Acts, or even the SCBN comedv se
ries "The Oval."
AS REAL AS YOU WANNA BE
It used to be documentary history. Now it's
a franchise. But that s OK. In its sixth season,
set in Boston, the cameras follow another set of
housemates as they find out what it's like to be
on "The Real World."
These include Genesis, described by one of
the residents as a "lipstick lesbian"; .Jason, a
pretentious pseudo-poet; Montana, a 20-year
old who spouts brilliant observations on reli
gion ( 1 don't like what the church has done to
women") as well as her housemate Kameelah
("She must learn to use her energy for good,
not evil"). These quotes are paraphrases, but
you get the point.
Kameelah, by the way, is a junior at Stan
ford, a fact that becomes clear after you sec her
wearing Stanford gear in shot after shot, day
after day. The show's hardly begun and al
ready there's conflict. On the first episode, the
housemates decided that Kameelah was over
bearing and domineering when in fact she was
just being a friendly, outgoing, typical Stanford
student.
After living in Kimball and Ujamaa, it'll be
interesting to sec how Kameelah deals with
MTV. The show airs Wednesdays at 10.

Cellist Alison Hu and conductor Giancarlo Aquilanti led the Stanford Summer Or
chestra in an evening of terrific, energetic music at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. If you
weren't there, you missed a great show.
