## New ballroom comedy 'Shall We Dance?' an invitation to romance 
### 
There was a time when movies were an ex
cuse for couples to make out in the dark, and
that's still true. But in our self-obsessed age
if self-help books and personal improvement,
thi' p eat love affair may be the one going on

between "I"and "me," and, surprisingly
enough, that can be as satisfying as Dick and
Jane.
"Shall We Dance?" a terrific dramedy that
broke box office records in Japan, appears to

be a conventional love story at first. Sugiya
ma (Koji Yakusho), an ordinary businessman
with a wife, daughter, and perfect home, feels
there's something missing in his life. Every
night, on the train ride from work, Sugiyama

sees the image of a melancholy young dancer
looking out from the window of a dance stu
dio.
Trying to get close to the beautiful dancer,
Mai, Sugiyama signs up for dance lessons. At
the studio, Sugiyama meets other people like
him, including two other potential love inter
ests. lit;, of course, k(H>ps the lessons a secret,
from his wife, who nevertheless nets suspi
cious and hires a detective.
From the synopsis, "Shall We Dance?"
sounds like some French domestic farce, hut
this captivating comedy is not really interest
ed in bedroom romp and romantic liaisons.
At its core, the film revolves around the idea
of loving one's own life, and being happy
doing what one does. In this case, it's danc
ing, which becomes a metaphor for reaching
out for people, trusting them, and making
real bonds.
The shots of Sugiyama dancing by himself
in the rain is suggestive of the film's philoso
phy. The image does evoke another famous
night stepper, Gene Kelly. But if Kelly
danced out of romantic joy in "Singin' in the
Rain," Sugiyama here dances simply because
he enjoys dancing.
Kather than talk about erotic or romantic
love, "Shall We Dance?" explores self-love
and respect. The romantic climax of the story
provides a twist in the usual "love" letter to
point out instead the enthusiasm and joy in
volved in doing something that you love.
"Shall We Dance?" is tbe kind of feel-g(X)d
movie where not a line is wasted, not a shot
gone in vain. Everything contributes to a
powerful overflow of emotions that provide a
great payoff in the film's final half hour, ('all
it sentimental, call it schmaltz, but "Shall We
Dance?" has a grip tight into the hearts of its
viewers.
