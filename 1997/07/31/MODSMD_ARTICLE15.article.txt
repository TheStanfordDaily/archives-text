DARRYL THE PILOT took
two passes to square up for
landing on the rippled rib
bon of grass that was our runway.
It didn't help the five passengers
confidence (or stomachs) that our
little Cessna was chasing one of the
fleeting summer storms that driz
zle their way across the Amazon
jungle every afternoon. Riding co
pilot, I could see through the rain
drops the weedy transversal our
scratch of open land cut between a
river and a mountain peak.
Four other college students and
I were visiting a jungle village
called home to native
Sanoma Indians and for the last
thirty years, a small team of
Venezuelan missionaries. We had
spent the morning flying south
from Caracas on the country's na
tional airline, and our passage over
the rainforest was in a small plane
operated by Mission Aviation Fel
lowship. With almost painful con
centration, Darryl set our plane
down just north of the river, pulling
a U-turn at the end of the airstrip
and jouncing to a stop right in front
of the wooden house of our mission
ary hostesses. The ride down the
runway was like rolling back
through time or, more accurately, a
National Geographic special.
From all sides of the little jun
gle village rushed the indigenous
people, short, brown and curious.
Our plane was surrounded by clus
ters of little boys called ulupui,
and upon our exodus from the
cabin, five gringos suddenly be
came movie stars wading through
a pressing crowd of fans.
The missionaries' house, built
by Elisabeth's late husband Her
nan, had a split door dividing the
entry room from the kitchen. As
we ate, our every movement was
scrutinized by the crowd of Sano
ma peering over the bottom half of
the door, and only the learned
meaning of the drawn slide-latch
prevented them from pressing in
around the table.
Over dinner, a fabulous meal of
traditional Venezuelan fried ba
nanas and fresh wild boar from the
rainforest, Elisabeth and Maribel
explained their work amongst the
Indians. In addition to offering rel
atively extensive medical care in
the infirmary and pharmacy, the
missionaries helped the native
people build both a pre-school and
school atop a hill behind one of the
main clusters of houses. When we
entered the school I was surprised
to encounter chalkboard instruc
tions for factoring polynomials. It
turns out that most of the Indians
learn to do math better than the
average Venezuelan.
The Sanoma also learn to read
and write their language, which
was documented by Hernan before
his death. As a linguistics mqjor, I
was fascinated to observe the Sano
ma syllabary; the language has six
vowels and only nine consonants.
Of course the missionaries'

biggest motivation for document
ing the language was their ongo
ing effort to translate the Scrip
tures. Many of Majawaha's resi
dents attend the church Hernan
and Elisabeth started, and it is
currently headed by one of the
Sanoma.
Our first night in the village we
were the featured guests at an im
promptu church service, so we
obliged by singing a few worship
songs in and Spanish.
They sang for us too, and I won
dered if our music sounded as pe
culiar to them in rhythm, melody
and construction as theirs did to
us. The generators went off at
8:00, but afterwards the night
was more alive in silence and iso
lation than when the pathways
were lit with electric lights. We
fell asleep that night to the
pounding of summer rain on the
tin roof, but not until we had fin
ished a long conversation under
the stars.
The following morning fea
tured a trip in a dugout canoe to a
waterfall twenty minutes down
river. We had to park the boat
above the fall and take a short
hike through the jungle to view it
from below.
On the way down the river we
passed a section of sparser foliage
dotted with bits of twisted metal.
Darryl quietly pointed out that
this was where Hernan and a mis
sionary pilot had died in a crash
three years before. Though most
of the plane had been carried
away to use as spare metal, the
jungle was still noticeably
thinned out in a semicircle on the
riverbank. The site was a sober
ing reminder of what may be
asked of you when you devote
your life to your faith.
As one considering vocational
ministry for my future, I could
not help but pose a few questions
to God. Why, when workers are so
few in places like Majawana,
would he take such a faithful ser
vant like Hernan away? And what
plans does God have for me?
I wondered if I would have the
courage to continue as a mission
ary the way Elisabeth had after
losing such a close loved one. And
I was reminded once again that all
our lives are in the hands of a God
whose plans are not our own.
The work goes on in Ma
jawana. The church continues to
grow under the direction of the
native pastor, and soon Elisabeth
will continue the Scripture trans
lation begun by her husband.
I don't know why Hernan died
in the middle of his work, and I
don't know where I will be led in
the future. But the dedication of
the missionaries to their work
with the Sanoma reassures me
that my faith is not misplaced. Ul
timately, God is good.
