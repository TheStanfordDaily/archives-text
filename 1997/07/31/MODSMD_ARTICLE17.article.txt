# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## Fear and loathing in Mountain Home 
### 
WE WERE SOMEWHERE
on 1-84 on the eastern
edge of Ada County when
the hunger began to take hold. I re
member saying something like
"My stomach's really growling,
maybe you should drive...
My brother had put the shade
down in the seat next to me to
block the sun's reflection from his
eyes. "Cut the Hunter S. Thomp
son bullshit," he muttered. "We're
almost there, and I'm not driving."
I snapped out of my gonzo day
dream, looked at the freeway
stretching uninterrupted for miles
ahead and the rolling hills that
surrounded the car, and then
turned to Dan. "What the hell are
we doing?" I asked.
It was a good question. It was al
most 8 p.m. and we still had about
twenty miles to go to the town of
Mountain Home. We were search
ing for food — McDonald's to be
exact — and now found ourselves
in the middle of nowhere on 1-84.
The roots of our predicament
had occurred about 45 minutes
earlier, when we left my West
Boise house in the steel-gray fami
ly Caravan, which my parents had
dropped off along with my brother
at the beginning of the week. Dan,
about to turn seventeen and re
cently employed at his first sum
mer job, was flaunting his new
found wealth by taking me out to
his favorite restaurant. And since
this was a special occasion, he an
nounced, we would not be eating at
the McDonald's down the street.
No, we would drive towards down
town, see a little bit of the city, and

find Mayor McCheese somewhere
on the other side of Boise.
So we drove, passing the capitol
building, several parks and about
800 sets of Golden Arches on our
way t0... what? We weren't sure.
But we didn't feel like stopping, so
we just kept driving, eventually
turning left onto the eastbound In
terstate when we had run out of
city. We hit the open road and were
so lost in our own conversation
and the sounds of "Satisfaction"
that we barely noticed the green
sign reading "Mountain Home —
39."
About five miles out of Boise, we
turned down the tape and re
turned to the subject of dinner.
The little adventure had been fun,
we agreed, but it was getting late
and we really needed to stop in the
next McTown on the freeway. No
problem, we said, there has to be a
suburb coming up soon.
Geography note: Boise has no
suburbs on east 1-84.
After ten more minutes of dri
ving, we accepted the fact that we
had left civilization and were now
driving a barren stretch of open
road. And we decided to keep dri
ving. Dan remembered the Moun
tain Home sign; we set our sights
on the unknown town on that
green sign.
Our mentalities changed with
that decision. This was no longer
dinner, this was a road trip, our
own American odyssey, two guys
saying "the hell with it, we're
going to Mountain Home." Forty
miles for a Big Mac. Peter Fonda,
move over.

The train came out of nowhere.
We passed over a hill and there it
was, big engine and hundreds of
boxcars screaming along a track
down to our right. The low sun
glinted off the shiny engine and
bounced along the cars, and I
couldn't take my eyes off it. We fol
lowed the train for several miles,
watching it like the old HO-scale
railroad set that sat for years in
Dan's bedroom. Then we saw the
exit, and as I turned the car to
enter the Mountain Home city lim
its, we were neck and neck with
the iron horse. For a few short
minutes we matched speeds, and
men in boxcars waved to us as we
drew alongside their open doors.
Eventually, the track and the
road split, and we continued into
downtown Mountain home, a cozy
little town of 10,000 with one main
street and, yes, a McDonald's. We
pulled into the shaded parking lot
and placed our orders nearly an
hour after we left the house. We
didn't mind standing in line or
that the girl behind the counter
needed two tries to get Dan's order
right. What's a little wait after 40
miles?
It was the best Big Mac I've ever
eaten And as the sun set on Moun
tain Home when we pointed the
Caravan back toward Boise, I fig
ured out why. Burgers are easy to
come by, but brothers and adven
tures are not. Especially in Moun
tain Home.
