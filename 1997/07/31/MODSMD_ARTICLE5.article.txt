# Jane Austen society studies author's works

The Jane Austen Society of
Stanford meets monthly to discuss
relevant issues regarding the novel
ist's life and times and will be in
volved in a national convention in
San Francisco in October.
The society is an unofficial
branch of a nationwide organiza
tion and was founded by Sandy
Lerner in 1984. Lerner went on to
found Cisco Systems with her hus
band. Now a millionaire, Lerner
has amassed one of the largest pri
vate collection of works by female
English novelists and has recently
purchased a 17th-century mansion
in England previously owned by
Austen's brother, which will be
come a study center for women's
literature.
The members of the society at
Stanford consist mainly of Stanford
faculty and staff, some of whom are
serious scholars and some who ap
preciate her work on a more infor
mal basis. "Jane Austen has done
much to advance the recognition of
women writers in general," said
Linda Perry, president of the Jane

Austen Society. "This is mainly at
tributed to her genius and consis
tent popularity."
Most of the meetings consist of
lectures on specialized topics of the
era and informal discussion. Last
month, the group met for a garden
party at the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den. Lately, talks have been given
on a wide array of topics ranging
from smallpox, which was preva
lent during Austen's time, to the
history of the development of the
English garden. Some of Austen's
contemporaries that the club has
discussed of late are the Brontes
and Fielding.
One of the more high-profile top
ics that has been highlighted by the
society is Austen's sexuality. Eng
lish Prof. Terry Castle spoke on that
controversial topic, and her views
on the matter received worldwide
attention when she introduced her
radical coryecture that Austen was
gay, which was published in the
London Review of Books.
Because of Austen's burgeoning
popularity in the cinema, especially
last year, the club sometimes exam-
ines the interpretation of her nov
els to film. Much attention has
been allotted to Austen because of
her success in Hollywood, a topic
with which the society has been re
cently interested. Although some
members criticize the rendition of
her novels on film — particularly
"Emma" — some are pleased.
"I was pleased with 'Emma,' "
said Perry, "even though the fdm
makers had cut out a significant
portion of the novel. There is al
ways a limit when you only have
two hours to tell a story."
Recent articles in Forbes and
The Wall Street Journal emphasize
Austen's marketability. Her three
most recent movies have raked in
over $97 million so far, and more
are on the way, including a new
version of "Pride and Prejudice."
The next meeting will take place
on Sept. 16, when Ted Adams will
speak on the naval mutinies of the
19th-century, a topic which bears
direct relation to Austen's novel
"Persuasion."
