# Waiting list leaves 81 undergrads unassigned
## 
### Jason Engleman 
Even after Housing Assignment
Services placed 131 wait-listed stu
dents in the last remaining residen
tial spots, 81 undergraduates to
whom the University has guaran
teed housing remain unassigned for
next year.
A total of 114 undergraduates
were left unassigned after Waiting
List results were released. However,
33 of those students were not guar
anteed housing, and another 22 are
willing to live only in the residences
they've requested. Thus the 59
unassigned undergraduates willing
to live anywhere have first priority
for housing spots as they become
available, followed by those willing
to live only in certain places, fol
lowed by unguaranteed students.
Additional housing spots will be
assigned through the Walk-in
process, which will occur during the
first week of fall quarter.
Traditionally, there are a large
number of vacancies to assign at
Walk-ins because of previously as
signed students who turn down
their housing assignments in the
late summer, according to Housing
Assignment Services. Last year, 84
spots became available for fall-quar
ter Walk-ins.
The 59 students without housing
who have guaranteed years remain
ing and are willing to live in any res

idence for which they are eligible
must be housed by the end of the
first week of fall-quarter classes, in
accordance with the University's
policy of four years of guaranteed
housing.
It's a "pretty exhausting
process," said Kathleen Bransfield,
manager of Housing Assignment
Services.
Although spots are expected to
open up for Walks-ins, it seems un
likely that enough spots will become
available to house every unassigned
student. Those who are unguaran
teed and those who are not willing to
accept any housing assignment
have an "extraordinarily slim"
chance of receiving an assignment,
said Bransfield.
The university's main concern,
though, is finding spaces for the 59
guaranteed students willing to take
anything. The University has gone
"through residences and identified
spaces that would be able to be used
as student rooms without requiring
a huge amount in terms of conver
sion," Bransfield said.
Already, the University has been
converting study rooms in Florence
M(x>re Hall into residential rooms.
Also, some guest rooms will house
students. These spots will be
"counted as available space,"
though it is possible that not all will
be used. It is also possible that some
of these newly opened up rooms

might even be considered "more de
sirable" than other spots in the res
idence, according to Bransfield.
Bransfield also pointed out then
was "no increase in the occupann
of any room that had already beer
assigned during the first round.'
People do not have to worry about
coming to school in September anc
finding they have an extra room
mate.
The incoming freshman class
will be affected. Some rooms in La
gunita, traditionally used as upper
class singles, will be converted into
frosh doubles. This, in turn, will in
crease the number of spots avail
able for the general student popula
tion.
The reason for the housing
crunch this year is because of an in
crease in the number of incoming
freshman and transfer students —
that's due both to a higher yield rau
as well as to a concerted effort by the
University to increase the overall
student population, according tc
Bransfield.
Ultimately, though, the Univer
sity may not need to make good on
all of its housing guarantees a*
unassigned students simply give up
on the housing assignment process
"My drawmates and I are pretty
torn at this point," said junior Mark
Brewton, "but there's probably a
better-than-even chance we will bt
forced to live ofT-campus."
