Stanford Hospital ranks top 10
The Stanford University Hospital ranks eighth
in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Re
port's latest ranking of "America's Best Hospitals."
The annual rankings are compiled based on ran
dom polling of 2,550 physicians from the American
Medical Association. Doctors were asked to list the
top five hospitals in their specialties regardless of
cost or location.
Stanford earned rankings in the top 30 for most
of the 17 specialties included in the survey, with
top-10 berths in oncology, cardiology and urology.
Menlo Park sue Sand Hill project
The Menlo Park City Council voted Tuesday to
follow through with a lawsuit to stop Stanford's
proposed Sand Hill Road developments.
The council voted 3-2 to challenge the adequacy
of an environmental impact report that played a
large role in helping negotiators finalize the com
promise between Stanford and Palo Alto.
The council reversed a July 15 decision not to
pursue a lawsuit against the Sand Hill project.
Council member Paul Collacchi had surprised his
constituents by voting against the lawsuit. At the
time, he had said legal action was not the most ef
fective method to oppose the development plans.
Following criticism from his supporters, Collac
chi made a motion at the July 21 meeting to recon
sider legal action.
Menlo Park's decision to file a lawsuit presents
the latest obstacle for the development agreement
between Stanford and Palo Alto. According to that

proposal, which will go before Palo Alto voters in
November, Stanford would build housing complex
es on Ohlone Field and expand the Stanford Shop
ping Center. Sand Hill Road would also be extend
ed to El ('amino Real and widened to four lanes be
tween Arboretum Road and Santa Cruz Avenue.
Stanford Director of Government and Commu
nity Relations Larry Horton said the University is
prepared for litigation, emphasizing that Menlo
Park's decision to sue will not impede development
progress.
