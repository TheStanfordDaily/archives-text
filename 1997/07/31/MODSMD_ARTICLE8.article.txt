# Stanford battles Emory for MLK archive

A bidding war between Stanford and Emory
University for Martin Luther King Jr.'s
archives has drawn nationwide attention to
Stanford's Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject, directed by History Prof. Clayborne Car
son.
The archive, based in Atlanta, is run by the
King family, which began negotiations to
transfer or sell the collection because of the
suffering financial condition of the King Cen
ter. Stanford is involved in the negotiations
mainly due to the relationship of the King fam
ily with Carson, who was personally chosen by
Coretta Scott King to oversee the papers pro
ject in 1984.
Controversy over the negotiations emerged
recently when Emory officials and others ex
pressed a strong desire to keep the archives in
the South, King's birthplace. When The New
York Times asked Julian Bond, former leader
of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Com
mittee, about the possibility that the papers
may be moved to Stanford, he said, "I think it
would be awful. This was a Southern organiza
tion. The papers belong in the South."
Rudolph Byrd, director of African-Ameri
can studies at Emory, said, "I think it would
create a rupture in our collective memory that

would have unknown and far-reaching conse
quences."
The negotiators for the King family felt
that such comments were meant to put pres
sure on them to deal solely with Emory. This
has prompted the King family estate to halt ne
gotiations temporarily. Phillip Jones, presi
dent of the firm that manages the estate, said
in a statement: "We have decided to postpone
indefinitely all talks with the universities. This
has become a competitive situation. This is not
the spirit in which we approached this."
Jones also pointed out that King himself do
nated many of his papers to Boston University,
his alma mater. "We see Dr. King's legacy as a
national legacy and not just a southern lega
cy," he said.
When negotiations do resume, Stanford will
make a strong effort to obtain the collection.
University Librarian Michael Keller is a prime
player in the negotiations, as is Carson, who
acts as a consultant on the matter. Carson
maintains the only standing relationship be
tween the King family and Stanford. The pro
ject has a variety of sponsors and funding, in
cluding the University, the Center for Nonvio
lent Social Change and the National Archives.
The aim of the papers project is to organize,
annotate and publish 14 volumes of literature
mostly by King himself, including letters,
speeches and sermons. At the backbone of the

project are interns, usually students who do re
search on relevant people or places alluded to
in the text. "I like working here because it
gives me a chance to see an alternate side to Dr.
King, not just a vision of him which the media
molds," said Andrew Davidson, a master's stu
dent from Cornell University who works as an
intern with the project.
Carson stressed the need for the University
to put more money into similar projects in the
humanities. He expressed concern over the na
ture of the current negotiations. "Some may
think it's a competition, hut that was not what
was intended," he said. "When Emory sensed
that Stanford wanted the archives, that is
when the competitive spirit emerged."
It is not known exactly how much Stanford
is willing to pay for the collection, though the
University has in the past paid $1 million for
the collection of beat poet Allen Ginsberg and
close to that sum for the archives of the Black
Panther party, both housed at Green Library.
Many, including Carson, realize the signifi
cance of Stanford's obtaining the King collec
tion. "The importance is the actual value of the
materials," Carson said. "But it's also symbol
ic, and this collection would stimulate others to
place their collections here. It would con
tribute to the reputation of the University and
encourage researchers and certain students to
come here who otherwise would not."
