## Hingis sweeps titles at Taube Kremer bounced in second-round match by Wild 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
When Martina Hingis puts her
mind to it, she can accomplish
anything.
After dropping the middle set
in her quarterfinal and semifinal
matches at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, the world's top-ranked
tennis player feasted on Conchita
Martinez 6-0, 6-2 in 53 minutes
Sunday to capture her second
consecutive Bank of the West
Classic title.
Then she turned around and
won a doubles crown for dessert,
teaming with Lindsay Davenport
to beat Martinez and Patricia
Tarabini 6-1, 6-3 later in the af
ternoon.
Although the sixth-seeded
Martinez had whipped Hingis 14
months earlier, few doubted that
the 16-year-old Swiss legend in
the making would fail to win her
10th championship of the year.
Hingis, who is 50-1 this year,

had lost 6-1 in the second set of
her semifinal against fourth
seeded Davenport and 7-6 (9-7) in
a second-set tie-breaker to Laura
Wild in the quarterfinals. On the
other hand, Martinez had not
dropped a set and had dispatched
second-seeded Monica Seles 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 in the quarterfinals and
Amanda Coetzer, the No. 3 seed,
6-4, 6-0 in the semis.
As in her two prior matches,
Hingis' concentration wavered
again slightly in the second set of
the final, as she dropped the first
two games to Martinez. But
Hingis turned the juice back on
and won the final six games to
close the match and collect
$79,000 of the $450,000 purse.
Hingis connected on 92 per
cent of her first serves while Mar
tinez made 35 unforced errors —
one every 90 seconds. While Mar
tinez complained of a lack of sleep
due to a late doubles match the
night before, Hingis played as ef
ficiently as ever — dropping six

games in two matches Sunday
and further distancing herself
from a legion of pretenders.
The Stanford crowd had hoped
for a Hingis-Anne Kremer
matchup in the quarterfinals,
but Wild derailed that matchup
by defeating the Stanford sopho
more 6-2, 6-4 in the second
round.
Kremer had pulled off the
stunner of the first round as a
wild card by shocking fifth-seeded
Mary Pierce in a three-set grudge
match to force the meeting with
Wild.
But Kremer's absence, and
that of Seles, didn't prevent sell
out crowds from flocking to Stan
ford for the weekend matches.
Kremer's showing also fueled
speculation that she might follow
former teammate Lilia Osterloh's
lead and turn professional. Kre
mer has a higher pro ranking
than Osterloh and is a veteran of
top-notch competition as a six
time national champion of Lux
embourg. But she would not spec
ulate as to her future.
Osterloh's departure earlier
this month leaves Stanford with
out three top players from last
year's NCAA title-winning squad.
Kremer would likely inherit the
top spot in the lineup if she re
mains, joining sophomore Teryn
Ashley, senior Julie Scott and se
nior Ania Bleszynski, who lost in
the first round of the Bank of the
West Classic in doubles.
Osterloh did not compete in
the tournament due to injury, but
former Stanford star Debbie Gra
ham, who graduated in 1992 and
overcame a nearly fatal blood clot
two years ago, lost with partner
Rita Grande to Hingis and Daven
port 6-2, 6-4 early on.
The success of the 27th-annual
event pleased tournament orga
nizers, and the Bank of the West
should be a summer staple on the
Farm for years to come, with just
one year expired on a 10-year
deal.

Martina Hingis had plenty to smile about Sunday en route to her sec
