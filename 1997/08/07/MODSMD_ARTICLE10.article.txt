## WHAT'S THE TOPIC? A
						review of Thomas Pynchon's "Mason & Dixon" 
### 
Put most simply, "Mason & Dixon" is a
long-winded and archaically spoken story
of two men whose lives would have been
nearly unnoticed were it not for their
seven-year task of carving a 233-mile line
across a small portion of America's poten
tial, a task delegated by a crown that in less
than a decade would lose all jurisdiction
over America and thus make the line's
practical, if not symbolic, significance es
sentially naught. But for those of us famil
iar with Thomas Pynchon, those readers
who name "V" (1963) a late 20th-century
masterpiece, who consider "The Crying of
Lot 49" (1967) a timely and intuitive cri
tique of modern life, and who have at
tempted unsuccessfully, but with great re
ward for our trials, to battle his 1972 mag
num opus "Gravity's Rainbow," we expect
more than just a simple story.
From Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, we ex
pect genius, and with M&l), he delivers.
No matter how much Pynchon you have
read before, it doesn't matter. For although
many of the old tricks are here: the sailors,
the puns, the sudden bursts from trite lyri
cists, the allusions to societies, past, pre
sent, and unknown, the paranoia that pur
sues us, shadowlike, and the obscure refer
ences to each preceding work, this novel is
unlike anything else Thomas Pychon has
ever written. This mammoth 773-page
'road journey' sprawls westward from its
British opening with all of the subtly of the
burgeoning colony it seeks to replicate in
its pages; it caravans across ocean and
mainland, and along the way Thomas Pyn
chon gives us what we have long desired he
would, a new task for the American novel
ist, and a new novel in an attempt to real
ize this task.
During the sixties and early seventies,
Thomas Pynchon was the great American
post-modernist. In a canon that includes
Bartheleme, Barth, Coover, Gaddis and
Delilo, Pynchon has always stood out as the
supreme master, the epic craftsman. His
novels defined American post-modernity for
much of the academy and an endless stream
of essays has been produced during the past
twenty-five years in worship of his work.
Yet "Mason & Dixon" is not a novel for
academia, but for America. In the same
way that his earlier novels ushered in a
new age, the way his works, drawing their
inspiration from the conditions of life in
the country of late-capitalism, made Amer
ica the home of the post-modern novel, this
work reaches back beyond those origins,
beyond all of the roads already taken to a
time before any roads or cities had been
written to reconceive the history of the
United States in novel form. Pynchon
reaches into the beginnings of the present
to give time to the topic of our foundations
and to uncover the dark inspirations of our
destiny long before that destiny was made
manifest.
"Mason & Dixon" is a return to story
telling. But as must be the case in late-cen
tury America, it is also a novel about story
(re(telling, about novel as sermon, spoken
from the living room pulpit of the Reverend
Wicks Cherrycoke, the one who offers the
tales, who creates the mythologies, who
reinvents the past, steals it away from the
power elite, from the history books, and
gives it a more honest rendering, or at least
a more critical one. This Reverend Wicks

Cherrycoke got himself in trouble early in
his life for making Luther-like postings
that "were Accounts of certain Crimes [ he]
had observ'd, committed by the Stronger
against the Weaker." Pynchon revives this
early task of the Reverend's and turns it
into a novel a bit longer than those single
posted pages.
In this book, Pynchon indicts George
Washington not only as a slave owner
(whose slave makes a fool of our first king)
but also as a hemp-toking tobaccomonger
who engages the surveyors in a bit of light
conversation about various conspiracies in
volving the Jesuits, the Masons, the
British, the French and the Native Ameri
cans. Pynchon blesses Dixon as the source
of Thomas Jefferson's "pursuit of happi
ness," spoken in the midst of a few brews
and overheard by the scribe himself. He
presents Ben Franklin as a hipster, a Tim
othy Leary of the 18th century with stylish,
colorful shades and a suspicion of all
things, and a raver to boot. On the other
side of the Atlantic, Dr. Johnson makes a
cameo as a kingly statesman who rolls his
rotund form from city-place to city-place,
while Boswell tracks him as a note-taking
dullard.
All of this speaks to those of us who have
never quite been convinced by the hyper
romanticized versions of America's past,
nor thrilled either by the more serious con
demnations of our white-bread beginnings.
Pynchon writes as a satirist must, never
quite condemning outright, but placing his
characters in positions that make it obvi
ous what critical position you would be
foolish not to hold about them. This novel
is more sincere than any of Pynchon's pre
vious works, and it is ultimately about
more than the satire, the jokes, the odd fig
ures of history, or the occasional mechani
cal duck or electric eel.
The hero (and topic) of this novel is not
Mason or Dixon (though they are the most
real and most realized of any of Pynchon's
previous characters), nor is the hero any of
the other characters that stumble about in
this volume. The hero instead is the
that stands between them all, connecting
them, making them into a single historical
force. This ampersand is placed so devas
tatingly (and, in rumor, with immense care
on the part of the author) directly in the
center of the cover, calling out to us in a
way that most titles refuse, calling out as
the essence of the novel. Both Mason's and
Dixon's full names are obscured by the
edges of the book. Only the ampersand is
completely visible, not as a line that di
vides, but as a intricate swirl which, along
with the sides extending infinitely away
from it, encompasses everything. This is a
novel about Mason and Dixon, about Amer
ica and Britain, about the European and in
digenous cultures, about the Enlighten
ment and all of the ages that came before it.
This is a novel not about either/or, but
about the "both/and."
"Mason & Dixon" is about a country on
the cusp of many revolutions: political, eco
nomic and cultural. In this America, there
are lines that not only separate North from
South, but East from West, the past from
the future, and the modern from the pre
modern. But what unifies these separa
tions, what appears at the borderland be
tween them, is the richness of their suspi

cions, their celebrations, their deviousness,
and their sincerity. This is the content of
"Mason & Dixon" and the two infamous,
always recognized, always confused sur
veyors witness this collision.
In this book, with his heartfelt satire,
Pynchon does not wish, as our leaders do
these days, to make simple apology for slav
ery, for genocide, for environmental devas
tation or for conquering a land without
even the courtesy of a question mark. He
does not intend to settle a guilty soul with
the words 'I'm sorry,' but rather attempts
to force the ultimate unsettling: to make us
realize the supreme importance of slavery,
genocide and the conquering of America in
our origins, to make us realize our present
dependence upon those actions, and ulti
mately to show how we would not exist as

we do now without a long series of devas
tating tragedies and the silence that al
lowed them to occur.
We have a long history of complacency
in America, and we have killed, maimed,
slaughtered and oppressed many people to
the best of our ability en route to creating
our superpower nation. In this Pax Ameri
cana era, Thomas Pynchon takes a single
semi-elitist step away from that history
and attempts to forge a line of his own
across America using the novel as his in
strument. If you take the time to listen, you
will hear the voice of an alternative past,
and also the encouragement to join him as
novelists and historians in writing works
that reconceive the past, and, it is hoped,
redirect the future.
