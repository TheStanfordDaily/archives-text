Faith No More
"Album of the Year"

News of Faith No More's demise has been
greatly exaggerated. However, it wasn't un
warranted.
With vocalist Mike Patton recording with
his band Mr. Bungle, keyboardist Roddy Bot
tum starting up the band Imperial Teen, and
drummer Mike Bordin on tour with Ozzy Os
bourne and Black Sabbath during the latest
Ozzfest tour, there was reason for the die
hard FNM fan to wonder if there was going to

be another Faith No More album of "Epic"
proportions, their wildly popular single from
their 1989 double-platinum album, "The Real
Thing." However, the release of their latest
album, "Album of the Year," is proof that
Faith No More is still around, even though
this album is hardly what we'd expect from a
band who put together "The Real Thing."
Faith No More's seventh album is a smor
gasbord of diverse genres and themes. The
album kicks off with "Collision," a heavy, no
holds barred sonic blasting of abrasive gui
tars, thundering drums, and Patton's out-of
breath exhortations. However, on the next
track, "Stripsearch," soft, electronic beats
coupled with Patton's slow, soft vocals whisk

the listener into a mystical, tranquil, contem
plative state.
"The Last Cup of Sorrow," the album's
first single, is soothing and simple, yet heart
racing passages interspersed by anthemic
choruses ofTer a sense of spontaneity and wild
adventure.
The album serves as an excellent reminder
of the incredible range of Patton's vocals. At
one moment, he croons softly and sweetly like
an experience lounge singer, and in the next
he shifls into machine-gun-like exhortations
and Tarzan-like wails.
While the band gets kudos for packing an
impressive, unending array of genres and mu
sical techniques into a 45 minute album,

"Album of the Year" is a schizophrenic search
for identity gone astray. Granted, musical ex
perimentation is something to encourage in
this day and age where new bands rely on
repackaging old classics to win the hearts of
the mainstream masses. However, the hand's
experimentation hardly takes your breath
away; no single track on this album is out
standingly memorable, leaving the listener
somewhat confused and unimpressed.
Is Faith No More worthy of their self
proclamation of "Album of the Year"? Let's
just say that Faith No More views the cup
(and their album) as half
full, not half empty.
