Fool's Progress
"Fool's Progress"

Formerly known as Acoustic Junction,
Fool's Progress is a band that has serious
R.E.M. syndrome — an amazing potential
simply fails to be actualized. The self-titled
debut under their new name has not altered
Fool's Progress' sound at all; melodious
acoustic jam rock layered with syrupy har
monies and trembling lyrics, "Fool's
Progress" is less innovative than Big Head
Todd and more self-delusional about the
importance of the music than almost every

body else in the world. Are they preppies or
hippies? You make the call.

Plastiscene
"Plastiscene" EP

This tour-song EP can be found in any
record store in the country, with a thousand
different titles cut by a thousand different
bands. That's right, Plastiscene's self-titled
EP is just another poppy modern alt-rock
Beatles rip-off, albeit one whose scratchy
vocals and musical compositions also in

voke a groove-jam sound reminiscent of
Blind Melon. Forget it, though — I won't
even give this album to friends as a party
favor.

Sherri Jackson
"Sherri Jackson"

Sherri Jackson's self-titled debut album
is strong enough to land her a 45 minute
slot on the Grateful Dead-spinoff "Further
Fest" touring the country this summer. She
is an odd sight among the psychedelic sym
phonies of bands like moe., Ratdog and The

Black Crowes — a diminutive African-
American woman playing violin among
cock-rocking guitar-strumming white
males — and yet her live act contains an in
tense energy that was well captured on her
new album.
Jackson uses fierce folk-rock like a
weapon, attacking topics from denial and
poverty to love and misogyny. With a pres
ence and lyrical touch as commanding as
An DiFranco and a subtle grasp of the
pop-folk tradition of Arlo Guthrie and
Paul Simon, Jackson has crafted together
a no-nonsense, funky and strong debut
album.
