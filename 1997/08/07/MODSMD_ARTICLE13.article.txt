# String Cheese Incident
## 
### 
Live At The Maritime Hall, San Francisco
July 25 and 26
Bay Area music fans got a special treat
on Friday and Saturday nights, when the
Boulder, Colo, band String Cheese Incident
(SCI) played two fantastic sets at the Mar
itime Hall in San Francisco.
Blending high country bluegrass, swing,
bottleneck blues and a pinch of cajun zyde
co into an attractive, seamless rock is not an
easy thing to say, never mind do. But with a
line-up that includes fiddle, mandolin,
acoustic guitar, keyboards, bass and drums,

SCI let loose a high-energy blast of unique
rock that was barely contained by the room.
One of the most impressive aspects of the
show was the band's technical and stylistic
excellence. Drummer Michael Travis often
kept a stick in his left hand to play his kit,
while simultaneously pounding rhythms on
a set of congas with his right. Only man
dolin/violinist Michael Kang was a disap
pointment; every solo and rhythmic chord
he played on the mandolin sounded exactly
like it was on an electric guitar. Without
tapping into the folk-style picking and
strumming of classic mandolin, Kang occa
sionally held the band back from achieving
a complete groove.

Some highlights from both nights in
cluded a 25-minute-long jam on the high
country ballad " 100 Year Flood," a fantastic
salsa-style "Pirates" jammed into "Waiting
For The Snow" with a percussion segue,
and a Friday night triple encore that fea
tured Merl Saunders on keys for a finale of
"Reggae Women."
I got the chance to talk to pianist Kyle
Hollinsworth afler the show, and he told me
that String Cheese Incident should be back in
San Francisco at the Fillmore Auditorium
sometime in October. So catch them then, or
surf on over to their website at www.stringchee
