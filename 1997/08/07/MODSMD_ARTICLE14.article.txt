## Jesse Oxfeld Why burst the bubble? 
### 
The word sometimes
changes, but the sentiment
is always the same. Stan
ford, people have told me derisive
ly since first I arrived here, is a
bubble. Others call it a cocoon,
and still others don't bother with
the niceties and simply say that
it's its own little world, complete
ly insulated from the problems
and issues and concerns of society
at large.
At first I resisted those labels.
Despite what people said, I be
lieved things aren't that different
here than in the "real world."
After all, we had a big debate
between Jesse Jackson and Di
nesh D'Souza about affirmative
action. Of course, that was after
Stanford's president had made
very clear that the school's affir
mative action policies would re
main unchanged. But still ....
After all, every third-party
presidential candidate came here
to speak, including such heavy
weights as Ross Perot and Ralph
Nader. Of course, a Daily poll con
ducted just prior to the election
showed that 65 percent of stu
dents planned to vote for Bill
Clinton. But still ....
After all, Stanford students
and staff were active in the fight
against the anti-homeless "sit
lie" ban in Palo Alto. Of course,
"sit-lie" is on the books, no one
seems to care much anymore, it
only affects about a dozen pan
handlers on University Avenue in
downtown Palo Alto, and the few
homeless people living on campus
are treated more as sources of
amusement than as recipients of
sympathy. But still ....
The fact I've come to realize is
that the critics have a point. Per
haps John Donne is right, that no
man is an island, but the fact re
mains that Stanford, in most re
spects, is one, ent ire of itself.
It is a campus obsessed with
navel-gazing, where the big ex
citements of the year were the ar
rivals of I'olio Rev and Jamba
Juice, and where the big scandal
is that a few popular professors
didn't get tenure. It's a place
where the "real world" we're in
sulated from is Palo Alto, which
itself is fairly far removed from
the real "real world."
But where the critics are
wrong is in suggesting that
there's anything so terribly
wrong wit h living in such an insu
lated environment. Over the last
few months I've begun to suspect
that I rather like my bubble, and
in the last few weeks I've grown
sure of it.
In April, while on the East
Coast for spring break, I paid a
visit to the University of Pennsyl
vania. Three years ago when I
was trying to determine where to
go for school, my choice came
down to Penn and Stanford. I was
leaning toward Penn; it was the
sale option. It's close to home, an

enormous number of its students
are, like me, from New Jersey,
and it has a very large Jewish
population. At nearly the last
possible moment before my re
sponse had to be mailed, I flip
flopped. Schmuck, I said to my
self, you got into Stanford. Why
in God's name wouldn't you want
to go there?
Wandering Penn's campus in
April, I was reminded once again
how right my choice was. Never
mind that I was wearing a bulky
overcoat, wool scarf and leather
gloves — and that 1 was cold nev
ertheless. Never mind that I was
in a strange place and the faces I
saw didn't belong to friends.
What I realized that 1 really
didn't like about Penn's West
Philadelphia campus, and what I
really missed about Stanford, was
exactly what the Farm's criticized
for: its cocoon.
Students at Penn are bom
barded daily by the problems of
the real world. At The Stanford
Daily the doors are hardly ever
locked, and when they are, it's
with a lock roughly as secure as
those on the bathrooms of most
suburban homes. When 1 went to
visit The Daily Pennsylvanian, I
had to call up to their office from
an outdoor phone box and get
buzzed through two sets of doors.
As I chatted with the DP's edi
tors, they mentioned how difficult
it can be to entirely redesign a
front page late at night when a
University staff member is
stabbed and killed near his office.
I came back to Stanford not
only aware of its bubblicious char
acter but missing it. And I've been
noticing more and more just how
different from "real life" living on
the Farm is.
The crisis of the summer is
that a few hundred undergrads,
poor bubelehs, don't have Univer
sity housing for next year. The
best example the Dean of Stu
dents Office can come up with of
potentially cataclysmic college
student debauchery is a pledge
who — perish the thought —
came home drunk from a fraterni
ty event!
Of course, although I mock
what passes for controversy here
on our insulated little island, I'm
the first to recoil from contact
with the harsh realities beyond
our safe shores.
This summer, I've had to get
up earlv(ish) to go to work, and
that horrific experience, I must
admit, makes me want to rush
back to my oasis and stay there as
long as possible. Thank goodness
I'll be there again come Septem
ber.
