# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## Dispelling myths about Boise 
### 
BOISE IS A city of several
nicknames, among them,
"City of Trees," "Silicon Val
ley North," "The (lem City," and
"The Capital of Idaho." While some
of these names are well-deserved,
others only serve to perpetuate
dangerous stereotypes about the
city and Idaho in general. As an
Acute Cultural Observer (that's the
official Gannett title for "Sports In
tern"), I feel it is my duty to expose
these unjust pseudonyms and sys
tematically make fun of them.
Myth #1: Boise is "The Boring
City."
Several things could lead an un
aware citizen to believe this nick
name is a true representation of the
city. Like reading any of my past
columns, in which I complain of
having nothing to do, or ever visit
ing the city unaccompanied by a
Boise-sawv local. Do not be fooled
by my pathetic life or your raw ob
servations, dear reader. Boise has
plenty to do, provided you have a
piece of identification verifying t hat
you are 21 years of age.
Not that you actually need to be
21 to enjoy the late-night Boise hot
spots. Youjust need to have an II). If
you are a native Boisean you know
this and you have had a drinking
age ID since you turned 12. And you
laugh at the out-of-towners who,
void of proper identification, spend
their Friday nights playing Zelda II
on their eight-hit Nintendos. Boise
is exciting, but only if you know how
to work the system.
Myth #2: Boise is "A City of
Cars."
On the surface, Boise appears to

be a stereotypical western US city,
with little public transportation
and no tolerance for non-automo
tive commuters. Beneath the sur
face, however, is a different story.
Boise has a wonderful subter
ranean transportation system. It's
not a subway, it's a sewer. And tak
ing it to work is probably safer than
riding your bike.
As far lis I can tell, I am the only
resident of Boise without a car. I
think every local gets an automo
bile from the city at the same birth
day party as they get their fake IDs.
They all own bikes too, of course,
but they never use them for menial
tasks such as riding to work. No,
they take them on outdoor adven
tures, down mountains, across
streams and over great canyons
with single bounds. So they natu
rally resent any one who would sub
ject such a magnificent machine to
do something as tedious as com
muter transportation (the same
way that you or I would resent
someone using a laser-disc player to
listen to Hanson). Also, they hate to
share the road.
"Hey idiot, use the sidewalk," is
a phrase I often hear from the seat
of my blue Schwinn. It's usually fol
lowed bv a wind rush and some sort
of projectile object. I always glance
to my right, just to acknowledge
that i heard their advice, and more
often than not, I find no such side
walk on the street.
Myth #3: Boise is "The Potato
Capital of the World."
One rumor that I really wish
could be t rue. I imagine streets with
tubers, fountains flowing au gratin

sauce, ballpark vendors screaming
"hash browns, get your hash
browns here!"
Alas, Boise is not a city packed
full of potatoes. The potato section
at my local Fred Meyer grocery
store is modest at best, and most
people buy packaged stuff anyway.
You know, boxes that say "Made
with real Idaho potatoes" on the
side. If not for the "Famous Pota
toes" inscription on the bottom of
every car license plate, which pass
ing motorists so kindly allow me to
read as they swerve to run me ofT
the road, I wouldn't even associate
potatoes with the city. That is, if I
had never seen The Machine.
Deep within the heart of the
Idaho Statesman's lunchroom liesa
magnificent homage to the state's
prime agricultural product. It is a
vending machine, emblazoned with
red and black "Ore-Ida" lettering,
and for the small price of $1, it dis
penses a little piece of heaven: pip
ing* hot French fries in just 45 sec
onds. They are not too greasy, not
too salty, and just warm enough to
feel good sliding down the throat.
"French fries gixxl enough to keep
you from driving forty miles to
Mountain Home."
Now there's a motto on which to
build a city. And it sure beats "A
great little town in the middle of
nowhere."

Despite their physical similarities,
nineteen-year-old Jim Tankersley is
of no relation to twenty-three-year
old Sandeep Gupta. holder of Con
necticut drivers license no.
