## New admissions dean eager to get started 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Robert Kinnally likes to tell the
story of the first time he was accept
ed to Stanford.
Almost 20 years ago, when he
was a graduate student in English,
he was "incredibly psyched to get in
to Stanford," which was his "dream
school." He was impressed by the
calls he received from faculty who
were interested in what he thought
about the program, and what he
would like to see on campus.
But he didn't receive enough fi
nancial aid and instead went to New
York University. Still, Stanford fin
gered in the back of his mind as a
place where he would like to be.
Now, Kinnally has a second
chance, this time as dean of under
graduate admissions and financial
aid. Beginning this fall, Kinnally
will step into the shoes of former
Dean James Montoya, who has
moved up to the post of vice provost
for student aflairs. Kinnally's job
description includes deciding who
among Stanford's 17,000 applicants
will be accepted.
Is he daunted by his new mis
sion? "Not really," he explained.
"I'm an optimist."
Stanford marks quite a change
for Kinnally. Sarah Lawrence is a
small liberal arts college in
Bronxville, N.Y., with a student
population that could be housed in

Wilbur Hall, totaling about 1,000
undergraduates and 200 graduate
students. The school has no under
graduate mtyors; students are sim
ply awarded degrees.
Montoya is convinced that Kin
nally is ready for the Farm. "He'll
make a great dean," Montoya said.
Faculty at Sarah Lawrence rush
to praise Kinnally, or "Dean Bob" as
he was known to just about every
one. Music Prof. Chet Biscardi has
taught at Sarah I>awrence for 20
years and insisted that "all of the
student body improved with Bob's
arrival."
He recalled a faculty meeting

when admissions statistics were re
vealed. The number of applicants,
the yield rate and the average SAT
scores had risen. After the an
nouncement, the first reaction was
from a professor asking Kinnally if
he could promise the college to stay
as dean.
Kinnally said he did not have
plans to leave Sarah Lawrence, but
a friend e-mailed word that Mon
toya, whom Kinnally described as
"Mr. Admissions," was leaving and
that he should consider applying for
the position. Kinnally took the ad
vice and a few weeks later, he was
one of six finalists flown to campus
to interview for the position.
In his two-hour lunch interview,
Kinnally was grilled by a 14-mem
ber search committee made up of
faculty and students. University
President Gerhard Casper, Provost
Condolee/za Rice and Montoya
made the final selection based on
the committee's recommendations.
Rice said she was impressed with
the fact that Kinnally had increased
diversity and academic interest at
Sarah Ijawrence. She also noted
that he is "very dedicated to the af
fordability of a Stanford education."
Montoya lauded his "wonderful
sense of humor," while Assoc. Math
ematics Prof. Rafe Mazzeo, who was
also on the committee, called Kin
nally an "up and coming star in the
field."
The committee was looking for a

candidate who could understand
Stanford's commitment to diversity
in all areas — ethnicity, academic
interest and extracurricular inter
ests, for example — as well as how it
could be achieved, said committee
chair Margaret Brandeau, an elec
trical engineering professor.
History Prof. David Kennedy
said the committee's positive recom
mendation was based on Kinnally's
background and personal qualities.
"We're impressed by his youth
and energy and by his clarity of
thinking and expression," Kennedy
said. "In particular —just speaking
for myself — I was impressed by his
willingness to say he didn't know
when he didn't know something.
"He's kind of a no-nonsense guy,
and 1 think that's a very appesding
characteristic," he added.
The committee asked Kinnally
about subjects like admissions, fi
nancial aid, big-time athletics, tech
nology and administrative affairs.
He was also presented with hypo
thetical situations such as, "You're
at a dinner for accepted students.
How do you convince a parent to
send her student to Stanford over
Berkeley?"
"I wouldn't talk about another
school," he responded. "That's just
not right. I would tell nothing about
|the other school] and everything
about Stanford. When I was
through, it would be the most obvi
ous choice, and they wouldn't have

another question."
KinnaJly's skill rests in more
than words. He has extensive expe
rience in college admissions. He has
served in the admissions offices of
the University of Connecticut-
Bridgeport, State University of New
York-Purchase and Pace Universi
ty. He also appeared on CNN to de
fend the high cost of education.
Kinnally visited Stanford on July
16. He said his first goal was to get to
know as many of his future col
leagues as possible.
Kinnally said he hopes to bring
an "open-door policy" to Stanford
similar to his style at Sarah
Lawrence, inviting opinions and
criticism from the university com
munity.
He also said he hopes to continue
Stanford's commitment to diversi
ty. "In college people say, 'I met
someone for the first time who was
such-and-such. . ." he explained.
"But what they really mean is, '1
met someone who was not like me.'
People simply learn more in a di
verse community."
Kinnally said he plans to keep
the admissions process as personal
as possible, to look at each candidate
as an individual. He said he doesn't
buy into rankings, such as those
published by U.S. News & World
Report.
Those rankings have been con


Robert Kinnally
troversial at Stanford in the past;
then-ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson launched a nationwide
campaign last year to discourage
universities from submitting infor
mation for the rankings.
For prospective freshmen, Kin
nally offered this advice: "We are
looking for students who have chal
lenged themselves as much as pos
sible, considered within in the con
text of where they're from.
"We're looking for a balance, for
people who have used as much of
their energy as they can possibly
muster. But don't sacrifice having
a life."
That comes from a man who Ls
described as throwing himself so
completely into his job that "he
doesn't have much of a life," accord

ing to one colleague at Sarah
Lawrence. Perhaps that's because
"Dean Iioh" wrote a personal note
on the acceptance letter of each ad
mitted student, a policy that he isn't
sure he'll he ahle to continue next
year.
Kinnally does have a life outside
of college admissions. Me keeps in
touch with his mother, father and
sister, who all live in New York, and
is an accomplished organist who
has been playing since he was 14.
During his term at Sarah
Lawrence, he served as the director
of music at the Immaculate Con
ception Church.
Kinnally said he is not sure if he
will bring his musical talents to this
fall's Hig Game Gaieties.
"Of course I would like to," he
said. "1 understand .Jim Montoya
was a hit. Hut first I have to find out
what the talent scouts say. I
wouldn't want to step on Jim's
toes."
