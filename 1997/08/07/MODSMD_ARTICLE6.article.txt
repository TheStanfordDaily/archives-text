It's 3 a.m. and time for a decision. Someone's playing
the soundtrack to the movie "Grease." A couple is liter

culus homework or watch "The Rock" in the lounge?
For the students in the Stanford Summer College for
High School Students, dorm life is one of many aspects of
college students experience.
In addition to 35 commuter students, 130 students
are living in Branner Hall for the summer, taking
classes and learning about life on campus. Program di
rectors chose participants from a pool of 350 applicants
on the basis of their academic achievement and their
interest in summer study as demonstrated in applica
tion essays.
The goal of the program is to reproduce a realistic
Stanford experience — from typically Stanfordesque
get-to-know-each-other sessions to having conferences
with professors — "enhanced with activities that are
age-appropriate," according to program director Thom
Massey. He and the seven resident counselors plan
weekend trips to places like Yosemite National Park,
Great America and Santa Cruz, plus activities like hall
Olympics and talent shows.
The RCs are current Stanford students, chosen for
their level of interest, organizational skills and energy
level.
Senior Radhika Dasmahapatra, an RC, was interest
ed because of "the chance to stay on campus during the
summer and share Stanford with others who are excit
ed alxnit being here," she said. "Basically, we're just sup
posed to be around, answer questions and get to know
the kids."
The students heard about the program from
brochures, counselors or a World Wide Web site. They
decided to apply for reasons varying from the distance
from home to the opportunity to test if they could sue

ceed at college like Stanford.
"The prestige was a factor," said Myra Chen. "I
thought it would be fun to be challenged, and it's bet
ter than spending the summer on the couch."
Jesse Tandler has been researching colleges for the
past two years. "I wanted to spend time at Stanford be
cause it's in the middle of Silicon Valley," he explained. "I
love the campus, and I wanted to meet a lot of interesting
intellectual people."
Begum Guvenc applied to the program because of
the warm weather and, she said, because "I want to go
to Yale, and I shouldn't go to Harvard's summer pro
gram because Yale and Harvard are rivals."
According to Roberta Bassett, the program's assistant
dean, there is a common misconception that the program
is a feeder into the admission pool.
"There's a marginal amount of truth in that, but a
pre-college experience is more important for the op
portunities for the students to live on-campus, be inde
pendent and guide their own behavior in a contained,
more protective environment," she said. "Doing well in
these programs helps show something in the admis
sions process, but it's not a specific, automatic entry."
Students are required to choose one writing class
from among 10 offered, with subjects ranging from
canonical writers to popular culture.
Tandler said the class improved his writing. "I
never wrote for clarity," he said. "I wrote for elegance,
to get my thought across and to entertain the reader. I
never focused on how the reader understands."
In addition to that class, students are taking every
thing from astronomy to yoga to chemistry to fiction
writing. The classes are more intense than some ex
pected. "We never read 40 pages about a paragraph in
high school," said David Lai.
"The professor won't write everything down on the
