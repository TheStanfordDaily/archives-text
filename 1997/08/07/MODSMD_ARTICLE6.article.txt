# A 						taste of the university life
## High school students explore their future at summer program

It's 3 a.m. and time for a decision. Someone's playing
the soundtrack to the movie "Grease." A couple is liter

culus homework or watch "The Rock" in the lounge?
For the students in the Stanford Summer College for
High School Students, dorm life is one of many aspects of
college students experience.
In addition to 35 commuter students, 130 students
are living in Branner Hall for the summer, taking
classes and learning about life on campus. Program di
rectors chose participants from a pool of 350 applicants
on the basis of their academic achievement and their
interest in summer study as demonstrated in applica
tion essays.
The goal of the program is to reproduce a realistic
Stanford experience — from typically Stanfordesque
get-to-know-each-other sessions to having conferences
with professors — "enhanced with activities that are
age-appropriate," according to program director Thom
Massey. He and the seven resident counselors plan
weekend trips to places like Yosemite National Park,
Great America and Santa Cruz, plus activities like hall
Olympics and talent shows.
The RCs are current Stanford students, chosen for
their level of interest, organizational skills and energy
level.
Senior Radhika Dasmahapatra, an RC, was interest
ed because of "the chance to stay on campus during the
summer and share Stanford with others who are excit
ed alxnit being here," she said. "Basically, we're just sup
posed to be around, answer questions and get to know
the kids."
The students heard about the program from
brochures, counselors or a World Wide Web site. They
decided to apply for reasons varying from the distance
from home to the opportunity to test if they could sue

ceed at college like Stanford.
"The prestige was a factor," said Myra Chen. "I
thought it would be fun to be challenged, and it's bet
ter than spending the summer on the couch."
Jesse Tandler has been researching colleges for the
past two years. "I wanted to spend time at Stanford be
cause it's in the middle of Silicon Valley," he explained. "I
love the campus, and I wanted to meet a lot of interesting
intellectual people."
Begum Guvenc applied to the program because of
the warm weather and, she said, because "I want to go
to Yale, and I shouldn't go to Harvard's summer pro
gram because Yale and Harvard are rivals."
According to Roberta Bassett, the program's assistant
dean, there is a common misconception that the program
is a feeder into the admission pool.
"There's a marginal amount of truth in that, but a
pre-college experience is more important for the op
portunities for the students to live on-campus, be inde
pendent and guide their own behavior in a contained,
more protective environment," she said. "Doing well in
these programs helps show something in the admis
sions process, but it's not a specific, automatic entry."
Students are required to choose one writing class
from among 10 offered, with subjects ranging from
canonical writers to popular culture.
Tandler said the class improved his writing. "I
never wrote for clarity," he said. "I wrote for elegance,
to get my thought across and to entertain the reader. I
never focused on how the reader understands."
In addition to that class, students are taking every
thing from astronomy to yoga to chemistry to fiction
writing. The classes are more intense than some ex
pected. "We never read 40 pages about a paragraph in
high school," said David Lai.
"The professor won't write everything down on the

board — it's all up to you to take good
notes," said Herman Liu. "If your
work is not up to standard, it's up to
you to go see the professor," he said.
"We really have to do the work.
The professors aren't going to call
home if we don't turn in a paper,"
Cristella Sanchez said.
Megan Thorsen said: "I feel like
I'm learning stuff at a pace that I
like. The people here understand
half of what I say, unlike at my school
back home. And I love the band here
— they're all crazy! They have real
spirit."
Other high points include the
friendships formed, the Bookstore
and living in a dorm with a diverse
group of people from across the coun
try and around the world.
"I thought Stanford was really

quiet; it's called the Fu. m, but
there's a lot to do," said Celeste Liou,
citing Co flee House concerts and
group viewings of "The Simpsons"
as among the many distractions.
Also, "it's safe here and now I know
how good the academics really are,"
she said.
"I love the Bookstore!" Liu said.
"Everything's in there. I like to go
in and sit down and look at the new
books." He also appreciated the
chance to manage his time. "I'm
more disciplined here; I don't pro
crastinate like I do at home," he ex
plained.
But some aspects of dorm life took
some getting used to. The food in the
cafeteria, for example, has few fans.
Chen thinks that the problem is that
everything's overcooked. "If they
just took it out of the oven five min
utes earlier, it would be so much bet
ter. We decided that they probably
leave it in to kill the bacteria, but why
are they so worried about bacteria?

We see all the food just loosely
wrapped in Saran Wrap and that's
probably why," she said.
Liou has an issue with the toilets.
She said, "The toilets have no backs.
Not that we ever lean back on a toi
let, it's just nice when there's a back.
And we have to put the paper on the
seat every time we go to the bath
room."
"It's hard to study here," Cather
ine said. Lai agreed: "We never
sleep. Everyone's up all night."
Liou thinks that returning to high
school after a summer at college will
be difficult. "I'm dreading returning
after experiencing this quasi-college,
with all the freedom, both socially
and intellectually. At high school, you
have to take classes you aren't even
interested in," she said.
