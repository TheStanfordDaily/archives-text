Kimball custodian dies
Flora Domondon, a Kimball custodian and mother of
four, died July 13 around 8 a.m. She had been removed
from life support equipment two days earlier following an
asthmatic attack and aneurysm on July 4 that left her in
a coma.
She is survived by her children Catherine Aguilar, Ben
jamin Domondon Jr., Robert Domondon and Donna Men
chaca, as well as numerous grandchildren.
In a statement, Kimball Resident Fellows John and
Angela Rickford remembered Domondon as "not only ef
ficient and hardworking with her responsibilities, but she
was a fantastic people person, who made all the people
with whom she came in contact — students and staff alike
— feel happier."
Domondon had served as a Stanford staff member for
15 years.
Memorial services were held for Domondon in San Jose
on July 16 and 17. Anyone wishing to send their condo
lence's to her family should address correspondence to:
The Family of Flora Domondon, 2175 Ramish Dr., San
Jose, Calif. 95131.

Aeronautics prof, dead at 91
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof. Emeritus Nicholas
HofT — who pioneered research on the stability of rein
forced aluminum monocoque aircraft construction —
died Monday of natural causes.
Born in Hungary, Hoff emigrated to the United States
in 1939. He obtained his doctorate from Stanford in 1942.
While teaching at Brooklyn's Polytechnic Institute, he de
veloped new ways to overcome a serious inherent insta
bility in the construction of thin aluminum aircraft fuse
lages, paving the way for safe modern air travel.
In 1957, HofT returned to Stanford by invitation from
then-Provost Frederick Terman to start the Department
of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He retired from Stan
ford in 1971 after expanding his extensive work on the
stability of thin-shell structures.
He is survived by his wife, Ruth; his stepdaughter,
Karen Brandt, of Palo Alto; and his brother, George Hoff,
of Santa Barbara.
A private service will be held today; a public memorial
is planned for the Stanford campus after classes start in
the fall.

Memorial contributions may be made to either the
Nicholas Hoff Graduate Student Award in the Aeronau
tics and Astronautics Department or to charities of the
donor's choosing.
