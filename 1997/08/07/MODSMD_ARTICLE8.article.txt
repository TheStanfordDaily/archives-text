## Kataoka transforms sport into art 
### 
The Bank of the West Classic
ended 11 days ago, so it's easy to
think that the event is a distant
memory. But Drue Kataoka will re
member it for quite a while.

Sure, the tourney provided a rare
chance to see the world's best in their
sport — right here on Stanford turf.
Kataoka, a Stanford sophomore, was
more than a spectator. She was a
teacher — not of tennis, mind you, but
of art.
The world's No. 1 player, 16-year
old Martina Hingis of Switzerland,
cruised through the event with cus
tomary ease. She took home the sin
gles and doubles trophies, $79,000 and
a couple of paintings. And she received
a lesson in sumi-e, a form of Japanese
brush painting, from Kataoka.
She purchased a painting of a ten
nis champion holding her trophy.
"She said, 'That is me because I win
a lot of tournaments,' " Kataoka said.
"And she liked the backhand in anoth
er one."
The two-hour brush painting les
son came on the heels of a doubles vic
tory for Hingis on July 26. She had
been intrigued by the paintings at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium, which
Stanford men's tennis coach Dick
Gould had commissioned from Katao
ka, earlier in the event.
According to Kataoka, Hingis un
derstood the correlation that Kataoka

has used to revolutionize her art form.
"Art is so linked to sports and
music," Kataoka said. "Martina saw
how closely they are linked."
I tried to surmise how tie-breakers,
aces and treble clefs tied in with paint,
rice paper and brush strokes.
Kataoka explained that in sumi-e,
the artist grinds her own ink on stone
prior to painting, comparing it to an
athlete's pregame routine. She said
the brush strokes of the artist are
much like the strokes of the netter.
"You can never go over the same
stroke twice — there's just one
chance," Kataoka said. "In tennis, if
you execute a stroke you're not happy
with, you can't take it back."
Just ask anybody who has ever hit
an easy winner into the net.
Hingis learned what many around
Stanford and throughout the art

world have known — that Kataoka's
break from the traditional bamboo
and seascape subjects of her art form
into the action of music and sports is a
winner.
Head to the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center and you'll find lots of
Kataoka's work. Her artistry is also on
display at Taube, the Coffee House
and University Art Center in Palo
Alto. She'll be in Hawaii for an exhib
it later this month — right about
when Hingis will be preparing for the
U.S. Open.
Kataoka's star, much like Hingis',
is rising. And now her work will be on
display somewhere in Switzerland.

Jeremy Stone has never been painted
while in the act of double faulting.
But there have been plenty of opportu
nities.
