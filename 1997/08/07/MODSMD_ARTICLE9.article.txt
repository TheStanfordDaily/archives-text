### Allison Otto Editorial staff 
Senior Olympia Scott and former Stanford stand
out Kate Starbird were selected Monday as members
of the 1997 U.S. women's World University Games
team. Thirty-seven of the nation's top basketball play
ers participated in the Colorado Springs, Colo., try
outs, which ended with the selection of 12 players.
The World University Games, which take place
every two years for current university athletes or re
cent graduates, will be held Aug. 21-29 in Palermo
and Trapani, Italy. The United States has won nine
medals in 10 World University Games appearances.
"We have a lot of versatility, a lot of size in the post
and quickness at the same time," Scott said. "If we can
really share the ball well and work hard on defense,
then we'll have a good chance in Italy."
Murfee gets taste of national team
Former Stanford women's volleyball star Eileen
Murfee also stepped into the international spotlight
as a member of the U.S. national team. The team
began its travels by squaring off Tuesday against
Hungary in the Canada Cup in Winnipeg.
The 6-foot-2 middle blocker, who graduated in
June, garnered three kills and seven digs during the
three-game Hungarian victory.
The team travels next to Sicily, Italy, for the 1997
World University Games August 19-31.
Austin crushes Nicaragua
For Stanford junior pitcher Jeff Austin, the strikes
just keep on coming.
The right-hander struck out nine and allowed just
one run on two hits in seven innings to lead the U.S.
baseball team to its second straight victory Sunday af
ternoon at the XIII Intercontinental Cup held in
Viladecans, Spain. The 10-1 win over Nicaragua
boosted the team's record to 2-1 for the tournament.
As with the majority of his summer season Austin
(4-0) controlled the game, retiring the first six batters
he faced before allowing a leadofT homer to open the
third. He concluded the game by dismissing a season
high nine batters before retiring in the eighth.
