Europa Europa
by Solomon Perel
Published by Wiley and Sons,
Europa Europa examines a
world gone mad. This deeply
moving memoir of a Jewish
boy coming of age in the
midst of World War II
recounts Perel's painful
struggle from which there
appeared no escape. An
important work for students,
historians, and citizens alike!
You MUST read this book;
we have and we love it!
