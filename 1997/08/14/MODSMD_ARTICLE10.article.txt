## Romantic comedy 'Serenade' a little too bizarre 
### 
In "Love Serenade," director Shirley Barrett may
have had one mission: to tell a time-worn story with
as bizarre a twist as possible.
Set in the comatose Australian town of Sunray,
it's the story of sisters Dimidy (Miranda Otto) and
Vicki Ann (Rebecca Frith), 21 and 26, who feel that
their lives lack luster. When three-time divorcee Ken
Sherry (George Shevstob) moves in to take over Sun
ray's tiny radio station, the two sisters enter into
fierce competition for his affections. Which brings
me to the movie's first bizarre element.
Bizarre Element #1: What is Desirable about Ken
Sherry? OK, he's new and different, but so were the
Spice Girls. I can buy the fact that the sisters are in
love with an older man, if this man has at least one
redeeming quality. Ken Sherry has none. (The deep
voice isn't enough.) He has the face of a rat, the nose
of a parrot and the personality of a snake. He is also
easily old enough to be the girls' father, but the fa
ther figure theory is ruled out because he has no wis
dom or care to impart to them.
When he warns Dimidy, "You don't want to get in
volved with me," the audience is in complete agree
ment, and we wonder how long it will take naive lit
tle Dimidy to figure this out for herself.
The movie's next hour is the two sisters back
stabbing, giving silent-treatments, throwing temper
tantrums and feigning docility as they struggle for
and alternately earn his affections. As this drama
unfolds, the soundtrack rolls to '70s classic rock,
which leads t0....

Bizarre Element #2: The Bad Music Video Analo
gy. Watching "Love Serenade," one has the feeling of
being trapped in a bad music video. Scenes don't
match the music. Soul music throbs as pelicans stare
at murky Australian wetlands. Love ballads stream
as Dimidy casually rides her bicycle. Country music
drones as Ken Sherry does his daily routine. The
soundtrack is lively; the cinematography is crisp.
They just don't fit together.
At the end of the film, which I won't spoil for you,
the director gives a whole new meaning to the term
"creative license," hence Bizarre Element #3.
In the final five minutes, the supernatural is
evoked, and after you have assumed (silly you!) that
this was a movie that operated under the rules of the
normal world, where normal things happen, your
perceptions are shattered.
But since we're given almost no warning that the
supernatural can occur, the effect is not, "How in
teresting. ..." but rather "Was I really watching the
same movie this whole time?"
Believe it or not, the ending makes the movie
worthwhile, if not for entertainment or aesthetic ap
peal, but simply because it's so bizarre. At the least,
it's a great conversation starter. See this movie just
to talk about the ending. The rest of it is tolerable
enough to get you through: the scenes of Australia
are amazing, the characters are at times witty, and
because of that ending, the film certainly is memo
rable. You decide if that's a good thing or not.
