## Carey Jones How to survive the draw 
### 
IT SEEMS TO me that a lot of
the talk around campus these
days has revolved around the
undergraduate housing draw. As
it turns out, I've got quite a few
friends who are still unassigned.
Having listened to their irrational
fears of living three to a room in a
Lagunita single, I'm definitely
loyal to these homeless friends
and classmates of mine. However,
I've got housing problems of my
own.
It all started my freshman year.
As my current roommate, Jessica,
and I planned to draw together,
we visited Row houses and
sketched out a sophomore year
which would be free from Univer
sity dining, house meetings, and
cheesy get-to-know-each-other
dorm programs. We had faithfully
taken part in all these things our
freshman year, but now we were
ready for a change. As we looked
toward our Stanford future we en
visioned open kitchens and larger
rooms. We used a preferred year
and made up our list, placing 553
Mayfield at the top and Cardenal
at the bottom. Seven Row houses,
one dorm.
As the assignment deadline ap
proached, we waited anxiously for
the results. Jessica and I had
dreams of living in 553 Mayfield
and swore to each other they were
too real not to come true.
That fateful Saturday, we sat
down at the computer and tried to
log on to Axess, only to be told re
peatedly that all servers were
busy. Finally, close to noon, too
excited to realize that we had just
missed another delicious Wilbur
Hall brunch, we connected to
Axess. Jessica held my right hand
in a death grip as I typed in the
necessary information with my
left index finger. My hand hovered
over the Return button on the
keyboard. We closed our eyes,
took deep breaths, counted to ten,
and I pushed Return.
Draw number: 1801.
Residence: Serra.
For a moment, we were
shocked into silence. What and
where in the world was Serra? It
wasn't on our list. It must be a
mistake, of course.
No such luck. A few hours and
several conversations with sym
pathetic (and not so sympathetic)
dorm mates later, we resigned our
selves to the fact that we would be
spending our next year in Stern
Hall. Stern, of sickly-pink stucco
wall fame. Serra, the headquar
ters of — did we hear that correct
ly? — the Stanford Christian Fun
damentalists.
We could get out of this mess,
we told each other. Every day, we
checked the available housing no
tices on the Internet and called
the numbers listed, only to be told
that the house had already been
rented, or was too small for two
people, or was not to be rented to
undergraduates.

Jessica and I went home for the
summer and tried not to think
about the fact that we wouldn't be
living in a row house come au
tumn. And as the first day of
school approached, we arrived on
campus with a definite sense of
apprehension.
As it turned out, Serra wasn't
as bad as we had imagined. I
wouldn't say we bonded with any
one in the dorm, but this definite
ly was in our favor when we want
ed to study. We hated the smell
that wafted into our dorm every
evening from Late Nite, but then
again we were able to keep our
room well-stocked with gum and
bottled water. Our friends never
visited, but we did ingratiate our
selves with the staff of a certain
Row house and ate free lunches
there almost every day. On the
whole, it was a year of character
building.
But that didn't stop us from
wanting to try again for the Row
house of our dreams and use up
our last preferred year. This time
the house we wanted was Grove
Lasuen. We made up another
draw list, carefully checking last
year's assignment results and
making sure to space our choices
evenly so we wouldn't draw off
our list.
So how did we end up in anoth
er dorm, Castano, with a decent
by-most-standards draw number
of 767? That's another story alto
gether, but let's just say that we
didn't quite get that careful spac
ing of choices down so well.
So we're looking forward to an
other year of housing just like the
two we've already had at Stan
ford. But we're making the best of
it. I got a letter in the mail the
other day from Jessica, architect
to-be, entitled "The Room Plan,
1997-98." Enclosed was a detailed
floor plan of our tiny room-to-be,
carefully mapped out to provide us
with the illusion that we actually
live in a much bigger space. And in
a rare moment of sarcasm, my
roommate wrote this: "We LOVE
Castano. We LOVE Stanford din
ing. We LOVE quiet dorms. We
LOVE living close to nowhere. We
LOVE that nobody even knows
where Castano is."
Hopefully, I have helped to put
Castano on the Stanford map. But
even if not, I've decided to live next
year by another of Jessica's care
fully titled paragraphs, "The
Power of Positive Thinking": "We
may have no faith in the Stanford
Housing Draw. . .but this year our
room will be awesome, even if we
have no visitors. We have to live in
it, and we will enjoy it, no matter
what!"
And to all my friends who are
still homeless, there will be a cozy
little room in Castano where you
are welcome to crash anytime.
