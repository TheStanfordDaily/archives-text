# Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho
## The 						importance of living one day at a time 
### 
THE BOISE HAWKS, like all
professional baseball teams,
have their good days and
their bad days. Fortunately for the
Boise fans and especially for me,
the Hawks beat writer for the
Idaho Statesman, most of the
minor-league team's good days
have come at home. The Hawks
have lost only five games in Boise's
Memorial Stadium this year, mak
ing for happier spectators, better
natured players and, most impor
tantly, easier-to-get quotes.
Unfortunately the Hawks have
hit a small slump in their last two
home games, losing both while
managing few hits to please the
crowd and few good textbites to
please my editors. Thus I, the
writer, am also in a bit of a slump,
one that I fear could afiect my col
umn as well as my game stories if
not reversed soon.
When baseball players try to
break a slump, they usually adopt
bizarre rituals that are direct de
partures from their former equal
ly-bizarre rituals. They switch to a
new lucky batting glove, eat Dori
tos before the game instead of
Twinkies, even go days without
washing their underwear. I see no
reason why breaking out of a writ
ing slump should be any different,
so 1 have decided to make a bizarre
change in ritual: this column will
be positive.
I will not make fun of my city, or
talk about loneliness, or even wax
poetic about the wilderness or my
family. There will be no mentions of
the saving graces of the national
pastime, no comments on my reli
gious beliefs, not even an off-the

wall "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas" reference for my editors to
cut.
All of those things, you see, were
contributing to my slump. I realized
today that for the first time in a long
while, I had really enjoyed my day at
work. I found that I was thinking
positively, looking on the bright
side, enjoying the day for the good
things it brought me instead of fo
cusing on setbacks. And I liked that.
In the past year at Stanford, I
had grown to adopt a sort of "live
for today" attitude to fit my
lifestyle. This was due mainly to
the influence of a good friend and
drawmate of mine, who often tells
me in his Long Island accent, that
people who don't enjoy their lives
are wasting their time. He thinks
everything should be done for the
moment, that the future and past
are moot compared to what we are
doing right now. His words always
make me think (they also often
make me join him on late-night
food runs when I should be study
ing), and I have adapted them into
a life philosophy that works for me.
I decided this year to eryoy every
day for its positive side, to always
look for a redeeming feature in any
situation. My ultimate goal is to al
ways be content with exactly the
present moment. I have very happy
memories of the past, which I often
reflect upon, and high hopes for the
future, which I take time out to
dream about, but nothing can
change the fact that I am living
today. And for a few glorious
months at Stanford this spring, I
was getting out of bed in the morn
ing and looking not forward or

back but right in front of me.
That haa changed this summer.
I have fallen into the pattern of liv
ing days just to get through them.
That's because I've been depressed
a lot this summer, and escapism in
the form of looking forward to up
coming events is an easy way to
conquer that. True, there have cer
tainly been days this summer that
have been far and away better than
all others â€” my trip to Southern
California last week to see my girl
friend, for example. But I can't
shake the feeling that I'm missing
something.
For me, each day is too precious
to approach as simply another
bend in the bike path. With rare
but notable exception, I can almost
always find something positive to
take away from 24 hours of breath
ing in and out. Call me a misguided
optimist or a man out of touch with
reality, but I get angry thinking
about the number of days I have
wasted this summer feeling de
pressed.
Yes, I can't wait to be home to
see my family. Yes, I am excited to
be back with my friends when
school starts next month. Yes, I
have had a tough time this sum
mer. But I have two weeks left to
draw as much positive from the ex
perience as I can. Devoting myself
to living for the moment is a great
way to break out of a slump.
And at least I'm still washing
my underwear.

Jim Tankersley hopes to wax poetic
again next week in his race for the
utility correspondent's golden
glove.
