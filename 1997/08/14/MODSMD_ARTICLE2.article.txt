## Advisory Board grants Gupta tenure 
### Bobby Chen Editorial staff 
After seven months of waiting,
Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta has finally achieved one of
the most difficult academic feats:
a tenured position on the Stanford
faculty.
The faculty Advisory Board
voted Friday to recommend
Gupta's promotion to associate
professor with tenure. University
President Gerhard Casper accept
ed the Board's decision.
Provost Condoleezza Rice tele
phoned Gupta later that day to in
form him of the positive outcome
of his appeal.
The case first came to the at
tention of the Stanford communi
ty, as well as anthropology schol
ars and professors nationwide,
when administrators of the School
of Humanities and Sciences
turned down Gupta's initial

tenure application on Jan. 6.
Based on a reading committee's
report, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven and his four
associate deans denied the promo
tion, despite the unanimous back
ing Gupta had from the Anthro
pology Department's tenure com
mittee.
The decision was appealed at
the dean's level by Gupta, but a
special committee appointed by
Shoven turned him down for the
promotion again in May.
Gupta then appealed to Rice,
who forwarded the case to the Ad
visory Board without further rec
ommendation after concluding
that procedural difficulties involv
ing the dean's committee might
have interfered with a fair review
process.
According to Kathy Gillam, se
nior associate provost for faculty
affairs, the Advisory Board is a
panel consisting of seven senior

faculty members elected at large
by the faculty.
They meet regularly "to review
all cases of faculty appointments,
reappointments and promotions
that come from the provost," she
said.
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron, the
chair of the Advisory Board, said
Gupta's case was unique in sever
al respects.
"First of all, we had a some
what different set of evidence to
look at," he said. "Some of the case
was not available to us on proce
dural grounds, so we had to get
more outside evidence."
He said the panel obtained out
side letters through the Provost's
Office in order to better under
stand the situation.
Efron pointed out that tenure
grievances are usually unsuccess
ful, with heavy odds against them
being upheld.
"It's quite unusual to have a

grievance upheld," he said. "This
case was upheld on certain techni
cal grounds — not on grounds of
bad review, but technical difficul
ties. That's what made it unusual.
"I've been on the Advisory
Board a long time and never had a
case like this come up, against the
recommendation of the dean's of
fice and without recommendation
from the provost's office," he said.
"That put us in the position of a
primary review board."
Efron said decisions regarding
promotions are ordinarily ap
proved by the department, the
dean overseeing the department's
school and the Provost's Office be
fore reaching the Advisory Board.
Rebecca Stein, a doctoral stu
dent in modern thought and liter
ature and a member of the Ad Hoc
Committee to Tenure Akhil
Gupta, said the results of Gupta's
tenure case will serve as a land
mark for future tenure decisions.

"The decision to grant Gupta
tenure establishes an important
institutional precedent for future
tenure appeals by women and peo
ple of color who constitute an out
rageously low percentage of Stan
ford's tenured faculty," she said.
"The reversal is a victory not only
for cultural anthropology at Stan
ford, but for all scholars and stu
dents of non-traditional scholar
ship."
Stein said now that Gupta's
case has been resolved, the Uni
versity will be under scrutiny
when it considers other minorities
and women for permanent faculty
positions.
In particular, she considers
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawis
lak's ongoing tenure process as a
more rigorous test of Stanford's
commitment to diversifying its
faculty.
Like Gupta, Sawislak was de
nied tenure by a dean's committee
following a unanimous recom
mendation for promotion by her
department.
"While (the Gupta decision
was) indeed a victory on several
fronts, it remains to be seen if the
University can demonstrate a
commitment to a diversity of fac
ulty and scholarship," Stein said.
"The case of Prof. Sawislak will be
an important test in this regard."
Sarah Stein, a doctoral student
in history and one of numerous
students supporting Sawislak's
tenure campaign, said she was ex
cited to hear that Gupta had been
offered tenure.
"I hope it is a sign that the ad
ministration is listening to the
concerns of faculty and students
who are worried about the preju
dicial nature of the current hiring
and promotions system," she said.
"Each case is individual because
each candidate has to be evaluated
only on the basis of their skills and
what they have to offer the Uni
versity."
She said she believes Sawis
lak's academic qualifications will
lead the University to offer her
tenure if the case is reconsidered.
"Regardless of Gupta, I believe
she's a strong candidate on her
own," Stein said. "Hopefully, this
represents a new sensitivity to
ward a tradition of discrimination
within the tenure system."
Much of the controversy sur
rounding Gupta's tenure appeals
process has involved questions
about whether the University is
truly dedicated to faculty diversity.
However, Efron emphasized

that only Gupta's merits as a
scholar and professor were consid
ered in the Advisory Board's deci
sion to promote him.
"Especially in this case, race
and gender played absolutely no
role at any level," he said. "It was
conducted as a merit-only consid
eration, as it always is at the
tenure level."
Efron also stressed that, while
the Advisory Board's recommen
dation effectively overturned
Shoven's decision to deny Gupta
tenure, the end result should not
be interpreted as a repudiation of
the dean's office.
"Stanford is really quite noble,
I think, as a first-class university,"
he said. "It really does give a good
chance to people from inside to get
promoted to tenure.
"From a corporate point of
view, it would always be safer to
hire people at tenure level from
outside, and it's good that we
don't do that. But, as a result, you
must have a strict review process.
The dean's office is responsible for
administering that review
process, and they were trying to do
a good job at it," Efron said.
"I don't fault them at all. It's
not easy to do the job that they
were trying to do. I thought they
were doing it honestly and with
the interest of both the University
and the individuals in mind," he
said.
Assoc. Dean for Humanities
John Etchemendy refused to com
ment on the outcome of Gupta's
appeal. Shoven and the other asso
ciate deans were unavailable for
comment.
Gupta, who received word of
his promotion as he was preparing
to depart for a Woodrow Wilson
Center fellowship in Washington,
D.C., was also unavailable for
comment.
