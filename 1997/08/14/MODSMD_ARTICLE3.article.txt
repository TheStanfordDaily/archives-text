# Art museum construction celebrates milestone

### Marisa Paulik 
The steel framework of the new wing of the Can
tor Center for the Visual Arts was completed Tues
day evening in a "celebratory moment," said Jim Sei
gleman, the museum's director.
In a process called "topping off," all the people
who had a significant role in the building's creation,
from the architects to the donors to the construction
workers, gathered and participated in the tradition
of signing the last steel beam.
According to the old steel industry tradition, an
American flag and a small redwood tree sat atop the
beam. The tree indicates that no one was hurt during
the construction of the building, and it was to be
planted after the ceremony.
"It's an another milestone in a seemingly endless
process, but it's an important one," Seigleman said.
The new wing and the renovation of the former
Stanford Art Museum will be finished and opened to
the public in January 1999, said Mona Duggins, the
associate director. The museum has been closed
since 1989 because of damage suffered during the
Loma Prieta Earthquake.
"The museum will bring programming and exhi
bitions and be a very big part of life at Stanford,"
Provost Condoleezza Rice said in a speech at the
Rodin Sculpture Garden before the ceremony. "I'm
delighted with the way the program is moving and
the way our devoted supporters have stayed with
us."
John Freidenrich, a University trustee and donor
with his wife, Jill, to the museum's renovation, said:
"It's great to see it moving along and we're anxious
to have it completed. We're very happy with our
gift."
Arash Azarkhish, a project engineer for the con
struction firm Rudolf and Sutton described himself
as "the guv who coordinated the construction of the
building." He called the ceremony "a nice milestone
to reach. The steel gives everyone an idea of what the
building will look like. And, it's a huge headache
done with."
Evan Reis, engineer from Degenkolb Structural
Engineers, felt "justification that it all worked out. It
looks good, like we expected." He's especially glad
that the steel framework is done. "There's a lot of

steel because the artworks need protection. Of
course, there's the people, but in office buildings
there's all the desks and filing cabinets that aren't as
valuable, aren't irreplaceable items."
It was important for the new wing to remain faith
ful to the original design, Reis said. "We emphasized
the good points and kept what worked," he said.
"This actually saved the University money. We took
advantage of what the Museum had to offer."
He found it more exciting to work on the old mu
seum than to work on the new wing, he said. "When
we're gone, you'll be able to go in and you won't see
anything we've done."
The museum, built 1890, was the first reinforced
concrete building west of the Mississippi and, at the
time, both the largest concrete structure and the
largest private museum. The Museum came through
the 1906 earthquake with little damage and the dam
age from the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake could
have been worse, according to Reis. "The walls are
very thick, 2 feet thick. Like building blocks, they
rock when shaken."
Reis and his company also worked on other on
campus projects, including the renovation of the
Memorial Church. As a Stanford alumnus, he feels
it's important to give back. And, he added, he uses
his work as an excuse to avoid giving money to the
Alumni Association.
"It's wonderful to see the steel up," said the ar
chitect, Richard Kosheluk. "It happens so fast —just
three weeks ago there was nothing there and now
there's the framework. It's a momentous thing,
when the space you've been envisioning and imagin
ing for years finally start to take form."
Starting on the project in November 1994, he has
picked every piece of material. The new wing "is not
replicating the old building but responding to it. The
color and palette of materials" are similar, he said,
"but it's definitely of the 1990'5."
Kosheluk describes the new building as "separate,
yet it completes the old building. The old one is mas
sive, with small windows and tiny pieces of glass. The
new one will be open, transparent. It's the same set
of proportions used in different ways."
"It's nice to be at this point, but we have nine
months to go," Kosheluk said. "The fun's just begin
ning."
