## Students risk burdensome debt 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Horror stories abound among Stanford students
and recent graduates who are drowning in debt accu
mulated while they were in college. One graduate has
accumulated $28,000 of debt from three credit cards.
Now she is working full-time to meet the minimum
payments.
Apparently Stanford is not as isolated as one would
think when it comes to racking up debt. Credit card
use among college students all over the country is on
the rise and Stanford is no exception.
At the non-profit Consumer Credit Counseling
Service in Palo Alto, spokesperson Marilyn Thain and
others work to help people regain control of their fi
nances. Thain said she's seen more and more Stan
ford students coming in for advice in recent years.
Credit card companies aggressively seek out col
lege students because in many instances "a college
graduate will earn more money during his lifetime,"
said Thain. They also "try to obtain a customer at a
very early age and hope for a long-term relationship,"
she said.
Citibank, for example, has approximately 1 million
student cardholders, according to Mark Rodgers,
Citibank's vice president of bank consumer affairs.
His company was one of the first to approach college
students for credit cards.
Citibank found that students were great cus
tomers, said Rodgers, adding that their default rates
are lower than for the general population. "Citibank
also found that credit cards provided an excellent op
portunity to establish relationships with these cus
tomers early in their life path," he added.
At Stanford, you can walk through any depart
ment in Main Quad and see brochures for Citibank,
American Express and Discover Card as you enter
lecture halls. Buy something from the Stanford Book
store and you realize that an American Express
brochure has already been placed in your bag.
The "Big Four" — Discover, Visa, American Ex
press and Mastercard — rent spaces in front of the
Bookstore at the start of each quarter, where they
offer giveaways from free candy to free trips in order
to lure prospective Stanford cardholders.
Wells Fargo, the Stanford Federal Credit Union
and the Alumni Association each offers its own cred

it cards, some of which are mailed to Stanford post < •
fice boxes without students requesting them.
Thain speculated that Stanford students, becauw
of the selectivity of their institution, may be targete
more frequently than students at other schools. On
recent graduate recalls applying for a card at his
bank. "Oh, you'll get it for sure," said the teller.
"They always give it to Stanford students."
To lure students, companies promote travel dis
counts, no annual fees and free long-distance calling,
in addition to promises of helping to build a credit his
tory. But many students find themselves surprised by
provisions contaim>d in the "small print," which they
often don't read.
Some people who seek the help of Thain's office
planned to get a high-paying job, and spent according
to that income, she explained. When they didn't get
the job, they were lefl with debts they couldn't man
age, Thain said.
Sometimes a scholarship changes. Students are
suddenly expected to direct more of their money to
ward the cost of tuition, but they do not have an
"emergency fund" to supplement their living expens
es.
"Students often underestimate the cost of food,
utilities and rent, especially in this area," and create
insufficient budgets, Thain said. "Sometimes when
people spend, they don't think about how this will
translate to their monthly statement," she said.
Ideally, students would pay their balance in full
every month to prevent the accumulation of debt. Be
cause this may not always be realistic, Thain advises
paying at least the minimum to avoid accumulating
"bad credit."
Bad credit is accumulated "when you don't pay the
minimum payment in the time frame the creditors
ask," Thain said. Bad credit can follow you for years,
even decades, when requesting a loan to buy a house,
for example.
If used correctly, a credit card can be an asset.
Thain noted that it enables you to make purchases
when you don't have the money in your pocket; it is
safer than carrying around large amounts of cash,
and it allows you to build a credit history. At
Citibank, the belief is that "having a credit card rais
es the comfort level for students and parents alike,
especially for emergencies or unexpected events,"
said Rodgers.
