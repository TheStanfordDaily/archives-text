## Spikers scrimmage Saturday; A's add Stanford duo 
### Allison Otto Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
With the start of the season just around the corner,
the Stanford women's volleyball team will tune up for its
national-championship defense at the Cardinal and
White scrimmage Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
The scrimmage begins at 10 a.m. A talk by head coach
Don Shaw, kids' clinic and autograph session will follow.
Stanford opens its season at home in eight days with the
State Farm / NACWAA tournament, featuring Brigham
Young, Penn State and Stanford's first-round opponent,
Texas A&M.
Three women, no men named Rolex tennis All-Stars
Stanford tennis stars Julie Scott, Ania Bleszynski and
Lilia Osterloh have been selected to the 1997 Rolex Colle
giate All-Star team.
The trio are among 26 of the top collegiate tennis players
in the nation selected yearly by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association and Tennis Magazine.
Osterloh, a freshman who turned pro last month, was
named to the All-Star team as the top-ranked player in the
Rolex Collegiate Rankings and as the NCAA singles cham
pion last season. Osterloh, who finished 30-3 last season,

was just the third freshman to capture the singles title in a
convincing 6-1, 6-1 victory over Florida freshman M.C.
White.
Scott and Bleszynski, who finished in the No. 2 spot as a
tandem behind only Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas of
Florida, were selected to the team by virtue of winning the
doubles title at the Rolex National Intercollegiates last Feb
ruary.
No Stanford men were selected to be on the team.
Austin rocked by Cuba
Some days on the mound are worse than others.
Stanford junior Jeff Austin suffered through one of the
worst of his 1997 summer season days Saturday during a
sound 7-1 U.S. loss to the Cuban national team.
The right-hander began the outing by hitting leadoff hit
ter Jose Estrada, who promptly stole second base and moved
to third on a wild pitch. One out later, shortstop Omar
Linares grounded out to second to score Estrada and put
Cuba ahead to stay 1-0.
Austin tossed 5 2/3 innings, allowing seven runs (five
earned) to suffer the defeat. He yielded eight hits and three
walks and struck out four.
Saturday's loss sent the Americans to the bronze medal
match at the Intercontinental Cup.
Big Game only three months away
While it may seem like a long way off, the 100 th Big Game
is already generating publicity. Now, it even has its own
Web site accessible through both Stanford and California's
official athletic department sites. The site's location is
http://www.fansonly.com/biggame.
Stanford is ranked 18th in the preseason AP poll, its
highest spot in the poll since Stanford won the Blockbuster
Bowl after the 1992 season. Only Washington, whom the
Cardinal does not play this year, is ranked higher among
Pacific 10 Conference teams. California is not ranked.
Murfee paces U.S. over Canada
Eileen Murfee's seven digs and .417 hitting percentage
guided the United States to a four-game victory over Cana
da for the silver medal in the Canada Cup.
The middle blocker, who graduated from Stanford in
June, leads the World University Games team in attack per
centage (.556) and blocks (14) and ranks one off the pace in
digs (19).
Murfee and the U.S. national team will begin play Tues
day in Sicily, Italy, at the World University Games. Stan
ford's Kate Starbird and Olympia Scott will also be in Italy
representing the U.S. in women's basketball.
Stanford's mtyor-league presence grows
Two former Stanford pitchers retuned to the same big
league team and another was traded in a hectic week.
Willie Adams and Andrew Lorraine, aces of the 1993
Stanford team that finished under .500, were promoted
from AAA Edmonton to join the beleaguered Oakland A's

rotation, and Rick Helling was traded from Florida to Texas
for journeyman Ed Vosberg.
Adams (3-5) atoned for a dreadful first stint with the A's
in a start Saturday against Milwaukee, pitching five innings
of two-hit shutout ball and earning the win. Lorraine (1-0)
debuted last night against former Stanford star Mike Mussi
na at Baltimore, outdueling the All-Star for five innings.
Lorraine yielded just one earned run on six hits and struck
out three in the 4-2 A's victory.
The right-handed Helling was 2-6 with a 4.38 ERA in 31
games for the Marlins, and the southpaw Vosberg had simi
lar numbers (1-2 with a 4.61 ERA in 42 games) for the
Rangers.
Clark starting for 49ers — for now
Due to Brent Jones' left knee injury, tight end Greg
Clark has been thrust into a starting role in the preseason
for the San Francisco 49ers.
Clark, who started at Stanford the last two years, was a
third-round draft pick of the Niners and expected to be
the primary backup to Jones, who says he can return by
opening day Aug. 31.
Clark's next start should be Monday night at 5 p.m. on
ABC against Jacksonville at 3Com Park.
