## Music ‘Wedding' brings back Bacharach 
### 
I have to say I'm a little an
noyed. Long before the PBS Spe
cial, before "Austin Powers," be
fore "My Best Friend's Wedding";
long before it was hip, neat, in, or
anything, I already knew that Burt
Bacharach + music = cool. I had
that guy in my walkman way be
fore Mike Meyers put him on his
soundtrack for "Austin Powers."
And I'm not talking just the
Burt Bacharach of such kitsch '60s
soft rock hits like "What the World
Needs Now Is Love" or "Wishin'
and Hopin'." But the Bacharach
who composed the soundtracks for
"Casino Royale" and "Butch Cas
sidy and the Sundance Kid," the
one who made Dionne Warwick a
star with ballads like "Walk on By"
and "I'll Never Fall in Love
Again." Even the Bacharach of
such Broadway musicals as
"Promises, Promises." Yeah, take
that, Austin Powers.
But for whatever reason, maybe
the current trend led by Hanson
towards more melody and less
grind in contempo music, but sud
denly Bacharach's melodious, lush
sounds, previously relegated to el
evator radio stations, have become
the hit of MTV.
The best evidence of
Bacharach's appeal is the success
of the "My Best Friend's Wedding"
soundtrack, which features covers
of some of the composer's biggest
hits. The album is climbing up the
charts, due as much to the film's

success as to interest in
Bacharach's oeuvre. And de
servedly so. "My Best Friend's
Wedding" is a rare soundtrack,
one that works as both a pop
album and as movie music.
For whatever you may have
heard about Julia Roberts' roman
tic comedy, that film's a musical at
heart. The scene where Rupert
Everett breaks into an impromptu
version of "I Say a Little Prayer"
works as a complete production
number, a joyful showstopper to
rival anything Kander & Ebb have
lately put on Broadway.
Director P. J. Hogan clearly
knows the value of a good, fun mu
sical number (as evidenced by the
delicious "Waterloo" sequence in
his previous effort, "Muriel's Wed
ding"). Listening to the soundtrack
brings to mind that and other
scenes from the movie, although
the other big musical number,
Cameron Diaz's deliberately awful
version of "I Just Don't Know
What to Do with Myself' has been
thankfully replaced by a legitimate
rendition by Nicky Holland.
Surprisingly for a soundtrack,
the album has amazingly strong
thematic unity. Befitting the film's
romantic concerns, the songs are
all about love, heartbreak, loneli
ness, longing, and the works.
Bacharach has a knack for ex
pressing romantic desire, which
comes through even in Ani
DiFranco's ironic, tongue-in

cheek cover of "Wishin' and
Hopin'. " I especially liked what
Mary Chapin Carpenter does with
"I'll Never Fall in Love Again."
Usually sung in a more upbeat
manner, Carpenter canvasses the
song's rueful bitterness and
charges it with a raw sadness that
makes Hal David's lyrics all the
more poignant.
Granted, you need to be in a cer
tain mood to eryoy this sound
track. It helps if you've been re
cently dumped, hurt or disappoint
ed by love, or in a severe state of
erotic deprivation. (Masochists,
this is a must-buy.) Jann Arden's
version of that unrequited love
classic "You Don't Know Me"
beats even Louis Armstrong's. On
the sadness scale, this ranks a 10
(out of 10). And Tony Bennett of
fers a devastating hymn to roman
tic longing in the sad, sad "The
Way You Look Tonight."
Neither of those two songs are
Bacharach pieces, and in fact only
about half of the album is
Bacharach material, but that's
okay. This sudden revival of inter
est in the composer's material
demonstrates his particular ap
peal, especially in movie sound
tracks. People are gradually
learning how his songs have the
kind of intensity and emotion that
can evoke an entire dramatic
world. The singers become char
acters in a show, expressing feel
ings that work in and out of the

context of a story.
There is the axiom that in a mu
sical, the musical numbers come
out when the characters have a
powerful, sensory urge to break
into song. And as the"I Say a Lit
tle Prayer" scene in "My Best
Friend's Wedding" suggests, this
may be just right. And I don't

think it's by accident Hogan set
the"I Just Don't Know What To
Do with Myself' sequence in a
karaoke bar. This soundtrack will
have you belting away the songs
when you least expect it, but that's
okay, since nowadays Bacharach is
cooler than Zima on ice.
