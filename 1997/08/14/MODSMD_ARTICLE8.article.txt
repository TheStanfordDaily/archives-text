ditorium. Tickets cost $8 students and $15 general admis
sion and are available at the box office or at the Tresidder
Ticket Office. Soloist Timothy Ding will perform Pranz
Schubert's song cycle Winterreise. The songs will be sung
In Mandarin Chinese, to the verses of an ancient Chinese
poem. English subtitles will be provided.
SHE'S SO REAL
The adventures of Stanford junior Kamcelah Philips,
stranded in the Ileal World Boston, courtesy of MTV, contin
ue. The editors of the series seem to have figured out what
the scoop on Kameelah is. The angle they picked is deep on
the melodrama but shallow on the psychology: Kameelah,
whose dad shot her mom, has never recovered from that and
so presumably channels her frustrations towards other
black men, target of choice being Syrus, the nearest person
of color in the house. Most recently, the cameras caught
Kameelah giving sisterly advice to lesbian Genesis on the
subway, and the advice ran along the lines of something like
this: Men are pigs. Men are pigs. So watch out. And yeah,
there's much to watch for as the saga continues. The Ileal
World Boston airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on MTV.
