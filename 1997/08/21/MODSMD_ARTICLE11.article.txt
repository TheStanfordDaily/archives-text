## Derek Bell: Master of the Irish harp 
### 
Entertainment caught up to famed Irish
harpist and member of the Chieftains Derek
Bell on the morning of Tuesday, August 19.
Despite the lack of an Irish Coffee at breakfast,
Bell had plenty to say about his ride to the top
of the genre of Irish folk music:
Entertainment: So how did you get started
on the harp?
Bell: For many years I was the one and
only harp player and English horn and extra
percussionist for the BBC Radio Orchestra.
I'm happy to My that I'm collecting my pen
sion tiller 24 years, but I'm sad to say that the
tax man is taking 50 of my 200 dollars every
month.
It was a funny accident that I got started
on the harp. I was the artistic manager of a
symphony orchestra as well as my other
work-this was in 1957-and the way it worked
was that we got locals to fill up the ranks of
the orchestra, and then put BBC players into
the first chairs. Well, this meant getting a
harp | player I from Dublin or Glasgow, and it
got to the point where it was all the harpist
could do to keep the instrument in tune, since
she was away from it so often.
tSo one day I was summoned to the office —
I expected to get fired for something, but that
was to come later — and I was told to tune the
harp. I had a tuning fork and all that, but it
was such a bother I got ready to throw myself
into the river. Anyhow, the harp was just sit
ting around in the offices of the orchestra, and
I got interested in it as an instrument of com
position. I eventually asked to be able to take
it home, and I got two lessons. Now, two
lessons is not enough to master an instru
ment that's been evolving for 4000 years, and
so I went to Gwendolyn Mason, and she gave
me more lessons.
The thing was, this was still the orchestra
harp. There was a tradition of Irish music at
the BBC Station, and I though it would be
good to play some Irish music on the Irish
harp, not on the orchestra harp.
E: What are the differences between an or
chestra harp and an Irish harp?
B: Well the Baroque Irish harp has a cou
ple of requirements. The first is that the
sound board has to be carved from a single
solid piece of wood. Another is that the tuning
pins must have metal braces on either side of
them. Now, the Neo-Irish harp takes the old
harp form and builds it a bit like a pedal harp.
I feel like a bit of a faker playing it in front of
people sometimes, who think that it's a real
Irish harp.
E: Did the new album | "The Mystic Harp" ]
require many overdubs of the two harps?
D: No, we arranged the pieces so that they
could be played on the harp in one take. There
was some overdubbing with the oboes, be
cause I'd decide that I wanted to use a rose
w<x)d or an African wtxxl oboe instead of
whatever was on there.
E: Where do you get your oboes?
B: Everybtxlv who plays in a nu\jor orches
tra goes to the factory of F. Ixiree in Paris for
their oboes. Some of them go back and forth
whenever their oboes crack, Pittsburgh in the
winter to Paris and back.
E: 1 low else did you influence the composi
tions of the album?
B: They were all written by Donald Wal
ters, who is a man with incredible illumina
tive faculties and a man whom I respect
tremendously. The truth is, I was generally
content to let them stand as they were. It
would have been presumptuous of me to in
terfere with the pieces. David Miller arranged
Walter's melodies, and I took their work to
gether as a single whole.
E: You've worked with a lot of people over
the years. Recently, you've recorded with
Sting, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello and

Marianne Faithfull, among others. Have you
felt the differences between traditional and
contemporary folk music from working with
musicians from a younger generation?
B: I don't bother with the distinction of
contemporary and traditional. Either it is
'pure', which means traditional musics on
original folk instruments, or it is 'experimen
tal'. We (the Chieftains) can work with any
one we want to — with Van Morrison, a 'soul'
singer, with Mick Jagger, a 'rock' singer, even
with the flautist James Galway. What the his
tory books will decide, if we are so lucky, Ls
whether the Chieftains adapted to playing
with those musicians, or if those musicians
adapted to playing with the Chieftains.
E: It is said that you are an expert on Irish
legend and lore as well the music. Is it true
that the poets and musicians were the only
ones allowed, even made to sit out the battles,
so that the battles could be adequately chron
icled?
B: Not the musicians. There was a terrible
battle in 1320, and the tinpan players and
harpers were sent into battle along with the
rest, and 30 tinpan players were slayed in a
single day.
E: A potentially devastating event to the
musical tradition...
B: Not really-the tinpan is a much easier
instrument to play.
E: Is that a bit of professional jealousy in
your voice?
B: Oh no. I can play the tinpan.
E: Does the knowledge of the history of the
legends come into your playing? Not just in
terms of the musical tradition and tech
niques, but also the artistic, creative element.
B: We have a piece called "Sea Images"
that is a lament about a disastrous shipwreck.
And then there is the "Napoleon Suite", writ
ten over the historical background of the Irish
involvement on the side of the French against
the English. I contributed 16 bars to that one,
of courtly harp music from the Napoleonic
court.
E: Thanks for talking to us, Derek. Any
thing else you want in the article?
B: Try to be in your seats and sober by 7:30,
even if you do get drunk by the intermission
break.
