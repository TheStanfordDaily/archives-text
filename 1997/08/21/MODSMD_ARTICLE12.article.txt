# Kelley Deal: High On Life and Kicking Ass
## 
### 
After a well-publicized stint in rehab for
heroin, member of the (currently on sabbat
ical) alternative supergroup "The Breed
ers " Kelley Deal has been steadily working
on her own project. "The Kelley Deal
6000," ("tkd6k " hearafter) which does not
include her Pixies/Breeders/Amps-alumni
sister Kim, has begun touring in support of
their recently released second album,
"Boom! Boom! Boom!" On August 13, En
tertainment had the chance to talk to Kelley
Deal, via phone, about her recent work,
drugs, horror movies and Minnesota:
Entertainment: How's life on the road?
Deal: Oh, it's fun. We |tkd6k] just fin
ished a month-long East Coast tour of 21
dates. And next week we're leaving for the
West Coast.
E: What do you like about touring?
D: We rent a big RV and drive around in
that instead of a bus. And we don't sleep in
hotels either, we just use the RV.
E: Do you ever camp out in the desert or
in good weather?
D: No, not really. We really like the RV.
E: How's it been to be on the road, liv
ing the rock and roll life, and having drugs
all around and you trying to stay clean?
D: It's fine. People at shows don't come
up and say, 'Hey girl, here's some heroin,
let's get high." If I liked pot then I'd have
a lot more trouble staying sober, because
people always have bags and offer them to
me. I don't even really like beer.
E: You don't drink?
D: Whoa, no, no, no. I like alcohol plen
ty, just not beer.
E: What's your drink of choice? Vodka?
Rum and coke?
D: Irish whiskey — I like Jamison a lot.
E: Bushmills too?
D: It'll do in a pinch.
E: Frank Zappa had this thing where
he'd make the rest of his band, "The Moth
ers of Invention," stay sober—
D: Yeah, I heard they couldn't smoke or
drink.
E: — do you put any expectations on
your band like that?
D: No, they do what they do. Out of the
four of us, three of us are mostly sober any
way, so just having us all together is
enough to stay sober. The drummer [Nick
Hook| is the only one that drinks really,
and if he has like two beers, then it's a big
night.
E: How'd you hit on the name for
tkd6k?

D: It's taken from an African cult that
moved from New York to Hawaii. The cult
was based on pot and free love and medi
tation, and I just though it was funny. I
mean, God, you can start your own cult!
Anyway, the "6000 State"was one level of
enlightenment for them.
E:The name kind of echoes Galaxie
500.
D: I haven't really heard them.
E: You should check them out. One of
their old albums has just been reanimated.
D: There's a good movie called "Reani
mator."
E: What's it about?
D: Some guy who brings dead bodies
back to life. I think it was done by the same
people who did "Evil Dead" and "Dead Or
Alive."
E: So you like B-grade horror flicks?
D: Oh yeah. Everything about it, the old
English libraries and whodunits of mur
der-mysteries too. I even wrote a song
about it, called "Murder In A." It was in G
originally, but sounded better in A. It's
about what one wears to a murder.
E: What does one wear to a murder?
D: A matching pantsuit and gabardine.
E: What have you been listening to re
cently?
D: Brainiac, and my own album.
E: Do you like "Boom! Boom! Boom!"?
D: Yeah, I'm really excited about it.
E: Putting it out on your own label
must have been intense.
D: That was the only way I could have
done it, without the record execs breath
ing over my shoulder.
E: What's your favorite track off the
new album?
D: For live performance, it's definitely
"Total War." As far as the studio versions,
it vacillates every day. Right now I think
"Baby I'm King" is my favorite song, for
today.
E: "Baby I'm King" is a pretty mini
malist track.
D: I don't think of it in those terms. I
put on as much instrumentation as a track
needs. I don't believe in having like 72 gui
tars on there anyway, I have trouble lis
tening to even three guitars. At most,
tracks on "Boom! Boom! Boom!" have two
rhythm guitars, a lead guitar and a bass
guitar.
[At this point Kelley excused herself to
talk to someone in the room. All I could


dudes?
overhear was "Yeah, he went to
pick up a crocodile with David.
Yeah. "|
E: Even though the album is
pretty eclectic in sound, everything
from electric slide guitars to spacey
chimes and heavy distortion, you
pulled the title from one of the few
commercially viable tracks. What's
up with the tribute to alt-pop?
D: No, it's nothing like that.
"Brillo Hunt" was one of the first
tracks I wrote for the album, and
the title was just there, always and
instantly.
E: It seems like there's a lot of
anger on the album — tracks like
"Scary," "Get The Writing Off My
Back," "Stripper," —
D: I'm not angry-anger takes too
much emotional energy. I'm just
writing and singing.
E: What do you think is the dom
inant emotion of the album?
D: I'm not sure. It's all over the
place.
E: Where did the concept for the
insert come from?
D: When you're on tour, every
one takes pictures and gives them

to you, and so we had all these pic
tures we wanted to do something
with, so we made a collage.
E: How does it feel to be a rock
star?
D: I don't feel like I'm a rock star
yet. When I do, then you can ask
that question (laughter).
E: How's living in Minnesota?
D: It's great. I just became a
Minnesotan today, actually. I was
getting stopped by the cops too
many times and having them tell
me that I had to get Minnesota
plates, so I went and took the DMV
test today. It's also not too far from
Dayton, Ohio, my home town.
E: Do you have family there,
still?
D: Yeah. Kim actually just flew
me down there last week for a trib
ute concert to Jimmy Taylor of the
Brainiacs. We (The Breeders)
played, and Guided By Voices too.
E: How's your love life?
D: It's fine. Yeah. We just sent
out a bunch of singles of "Shag,"
which is the first single from the
new album, and I'm pissed because
in the press release it says that the
topics I deal with include "the
beauty of a crack-free life, paranoia
of the far-right, and my past slut
activity."
E: that's not what the press re

lease I have says. That last part is
replaced with "ghosts who com
fort loved ones left behind, and fel
low Daytonites Guided By Voic
es."
D: Good, because I know that
people are going to focus in on that
too much.
E: When did you engage in your
'slut activity'?
D: It was all in my 20's.
E: That's kind of late, given that
you started in on drugs at the age
of 14. It's just that sex and drugs
often follow each other closely.
D: Exactamundo. I didn't really
start in on sex until I discovered al
cohol, which was pretty far along
the line. It went pot, pills, heroin,
alcohol.
E: "Exactamundo?!" That's a
word that doesn't get used enough.
D: Yeah, isn't it cool?
