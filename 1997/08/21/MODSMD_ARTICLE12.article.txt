# Kelley Deal: High On Life and Kicking Ass
## 
### 
After a well-publicized stint in rehab for
heroin, member of the (currently on sabbat
ical) alternative supergroup "The Breed
ers " Kelley Deal has been steadily working
on her own project. "The Kelley Deal
6000," ("tkd6k " hearafter) which does not
include her Pixies/Breeders/Amps-alumni
sister Kim, has begun touring in support of
their recently released second album,
"Boom! Boom! Boom!" On August 13, En
tertainment had the chance to talk to Kelley
Deal, via phone, about her recent work,
drugs, horror movies and Minnesota:
Entertainment: How's life on the road?
Deal: Oh, it's fun. We |tkd6k] just fin
ished a month-long East Coast tour of 21
dates. And next week we're leaving for the
West Coast.
E: What do you like about touring?
D: We rent a big RV and drive around in
that instead of a bus. And we don't sleep in
hotels either, we just use the RV.
E: Do you ever camp out in the desert or
in good weather?
D: No, not really. We really like the RV.
E: How's it been to be on the road, liv
ing the rock and roll life, and having drugs
all around and you trying to stay clean?
D: It's fine. People at shows don't come
up and say, 'Hey girl, here's some heroin,
let's get high." If I liked pot then I'd have
a lot more trouble staying sober, because
people always have bags and offer them to
me. I don't even really like beer.
E: You don't drink?
D: Whoa, no, no, no. I like alcohol plen
ty, just not beer.
E: What's your drink of choice? Vodka?
Rum and coke?
D: Irish whiskey — I like Jamison a lot.
E: Bushmills too?
D: It'll do in a pinch.
E: Frank Zappa had this thing where
he'd make the rest of his band, "The Moth
ers of Invention," stay sober—
D: Yeah, I heard they couldn't smoke or
drink.
E: — do you put any expectations on
your band like that?
D: No, they do what they do. Out of the
four of us, three of us are mostly sober any
way, so just having us all together is
enough to stay sober. The drummer [Nick
Hook| is the only one that drinks really,
and if he has like two beers, then it's a big
night.
E: How'd you hit on the name for
tkd6k?

D: It's taken from an African cult that
moved from New York to Hawaii. The cult
was based on pot and free love and medi
tation, and I just though it was funny. I
mean, God, you can start your own cult!
Anyway, the "6000 State"was one level of
enlightenment for them.
E:The name kind of echoes Galaxie
500.
D: I haven't really heard them.
E: You should check them out. One of
their old albums has just been reanimated.
D: There's a good movie called "Reani
mator."
E: What's it about?
D: Some guy who brings dead bodies
back to life. I think it was done by the same
people who did "Evil Dead" and "Dead Or
Alive."
E: So you like B-grade horror flicks?
D: Oh yeah. Everything about it, the old
English libraries and whodunits of mur
der-mysteries too. I even wrote a song
about it, called "Murder In A." It was in G
originally, but sounded better in A. It's
about what one wears to a murder.
E: What does one wear to a murder?
D: A matching pantsuit and gabardine.
E: What have you been listening to re
cently?
D: Brainiac, and my own album.
E: Do you like "Boom! Boom! Boom!"?
D: Yeah, I'm really excited about it.
E: Putting it out on your own label
must have been intense.
D: That was the only way I could have
done it, without the record execs breath
ing over my shoulder.
E: What's your favorite track off the
new album?
D: For live performance, it's definitely
"Total War." As far as the studio versions,
it vacillates every day. Right now I think
"Baby I'm King" is my favorite song, for
today.
E: "Baby I'm King" is a pretty mini
malist track.
D: I don't think of it in those terms. I
put on as much instrumentation as a track
needs. I don't believe in having like 72 gui
tars on there anyway, I have trouble lis
tening to even three guitars. At most,
tracks on "Boom! Boom! Boom!" have two
rhythm guitars, a lead guitar and a bass
guitar.
[At this point Kelley excused herself to
talk to someone in the room. All I could
