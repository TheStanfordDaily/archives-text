## Jim Tankersley: My own public Idaho Pedaling through my past 
### 
THE PEDALS ON my tired
blue Schwinn make a steady
whirr as they spin in rhythm.
For a long time, that is all I hear -
the song of the pedals and an occa
sional groan from another piece of
the mechanism. Whirr. Whirr.
Squeak. Whirr.
What I see is darkness, broken
by an occasional street light or two
toned illuminated sign advertising
gas at $ 1.32 a gallon. But the urban
lanterns only shine for themselves,
and even when I pass beneath
them, I still see the darkness. It
cloaks the weary Schwinn, and I
feel like a moving black hole as I
whirr and squeak home.
It's about 11 p.m., early in most
cities but well past weeknight bed
time for the majority of Boiseans. I
am traveling between an American
Ix'gion baseball tournament and
my rented room. Six miles separate
me from the house on Crestwood;
two weeks separate me from home.
It's a warm night, and I have al
ready begun to sweat under my
fully loaded backpack. The bike
has no headlight, a tribute to my
disorganized room that cleverly
hides most of my possessions just
when I need them. I am alone on
the road, invisible to the few cars
who speed past.
I cross the train tracks early in
the ride, and the minor jolts the
bike takes pale in comparison to
the shakedown in my mind. Mem
ories of a long-ago family Amtrak
vacation, of electric engines in my
brother's bedroom, of boxcars and
hobos and Mountain Home. I hear
a Willie Nelson song, etched into
my conscious by thousands of car
trips with my dad's tape selections,
and surprise myself by humming
along.
I pass through an intersection
and the lights fall away. I have
reached the first of many residen
tial neighborhoods on my journey,
and the houses are painted a deep
navy blue. I see this area every day
riding to work, yet it takes almost
complete darkness for me to truly
look at it. There is an elementary
school to the left. I've passed it
dozens of times, but today I final
ly realize that it isn't just a build
ing with a big yard. In a week or
two it will be alive with the excit
ed sounds of children returning
for a new year, a chance to start
fresh.
The whirr is suddenly joined by
a new sound. Crickets. In the mid
dle of the city. They surprise me,
but the moon blows me away.
It appears in a clearing, full and
bright. For a moment, the navy
houses turn silver, and for the first
time on the trip, my darkness is
broken.
I turn onto a windy road that
follows a ridge overlooking most of
the city. The moon follows. Far to
the right I see the twinkles of
downtown buildings, and behind
them the dotted lights of the
foothills. The lights flicker occa
sionally, but the city is silent and

static as I whirr past the halfway
point.
Ahead, a traffic light abruptly
changes and a car roars. I squeeze
hard on the brakes and feel the
Schwinn buck underneath me as it
slams to a stop. My heartrate is in
cut time. Headlights burn my eyes,
and I am momentarily dizzy. But
the light turns green, the cars
move past, and I am back to my
darkness.
Again I find myself amidst a
cluster of houses. Sprinklers churn
in nearly every yard, and a few
homes radiate soft yellow light
from upstair bedroom windows. I
am overwhelmed by a feeling of
calm, a sensation I associate with
late summer evenings spent relax
ing in the backyard or just peering
down the long, friendly streets of
McMinnville, Oregon, from the
front porch of my home. When I
pass a boy shooting on a driveway
hoop under garage lights, the nos
talgia is reality, and I am home
again, bouncing shots ofT a rickety
wood backboard with my brother
Dan. Then I am back to my 15-
speed chariot, rounding a corner to
once again find darkness.
There is one mtyor street left to
cross before the house, and it is
packed with cars returning from
the Western Idaho Fair. They honk
and yell as they race past. I get a
good look at the lights of the fair,
located just down the hill, as I turn
onto Crestwood. Among the thou
sands of flashing and moving
lights, 1 notice the great Ferris
Wheel has stopped, bulbs burned
out on one side.
I turn from the fair and look
once again at the moon. It remains
bright and beautiful, and I have
trouble pulling my eyes from it. Fi
nally, I break away and pedal down
the street — my street? — past
more darkened houses that repre
sent the homes and lives and
dreams of hundreds of people.
There is an oak tree in the front
yard of 7940 Crestwood, a yellow
brick house with a dying lawn. Its
branches hide a streetlight that
bathes the entire yard in a warm
orange glow. It's a good tree, I
think.
On either side of the river is the
tree of life. . .and itsleaves arc for
the healing of the nations.
I park the bike and stare at the
great oak. I think of the birch trees
at a certain blue house in McMin
nville, of the waving leaves outside
the window of Alondra room 300.1
think of that boy playing basket
ball, of the kids returning to school,
of the lives and dreams of countless
dark houses. It's my first moment
of peace with Boise.
After two months, I have finally
gained comfort from the ci y.
