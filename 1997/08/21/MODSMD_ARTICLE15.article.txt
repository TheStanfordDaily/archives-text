## Satisfying summers come in many shapes 
### 
IT WAS THE ruin that forced me
to realize that summer is coming
to its close. In their gentle mas
sage of the pavement four floors be
neath my apartment window, the
raindrops played the opening chords
of nature's entr'acte, signaling the
end of our academic intermission
and calling the actors back to their
places on the stage.
For me, it is a call to shed my role
as summer editor of this humble
newsmagazine and return to the
struggles I left three months ago,
those of an unassigned, undeclared
junior-to-be in search of housing, a
and a career. Unlike most of
my colleagues who wield the editor
ial pen, I have no plans to continue
this line of work off the Farm. Jour
nalism, in my life, is a pleasant di
version from problem sets and pa
pers, one that entertains, enriches
and pays a pittance. I er\joy it, and
that, by my reckoning, makes it a
good way to spend a summer.
Even so, my comfortable office
hours and low-stress timetable
leave me wondering if I haven't frit
tered away these sunny months. By
comparison, my friends and
coworkers have seemed far more
productive than me.
Living in Boise, Idaho, Jim
Tankersley, whose words have
graced this page for the last seven
weeks and to whom I have ceded
the slightly larger left-hand space
for this week's column, has waxed
poetic about his experiences writ
ing for a daily newspaper covering
the greatest of all games — base
ball. As an incoming sophomore,
winning a full-time job writing
sports is an achievement in itself,

but Jim will return from the Rock
ies also having braved a hostile
wilderness alone.
learning Spanish and teaching
English in Venezuela, Scott Peter
son, another contributor to this
page, found significant use for his
linguistics training and pedagogical
tendencies. The spiritual growth he
has experienced through his mis
sionary work will serve him well in
any arena and will certainly be an
asset as he applies to seminary.
In other areas, hundreds of
Stanford juniors and seniors spent
their waking hours preparing for
last Saturday's MCAT, the stan
dardized test taken by all medical
school applicants. By brushing up
on chemistry, biology, physics and
reading comprehension, these
masses have liberated themselves
from the pre-med curriculum, free
ing them to devote their final years
as undergraduates to their own in
tellectual passions.
Nothing that I have done this
summer can compare if weighed
against the potential returns my
peers may er\joy from their time in
vestments. I have not significantly
advanced my resume, I have not
taught small children to speak a
second language, and I have not
cleared any mqjor hurdles enroute
to graduate school.
Like life, the Stanford experi
ence is a series of choices. Every
member of the University commu
nity must make daily decisions
about what paths to pursue and
which paths to pass by. There are
too many opportunities to be ex
plored; there are lacrosse teams
with which to play and a cappella

groups in which to sing and campus
publications for which to write.
Summers, as parts of that experi
ence, are the ultimate bringers of
opportunity. They are like univer
sally accepted magic tokens with
which college students, Stanford
students chief among them, can
purchase twelve-week excursions
into the real world.
On returning to the Farm or,
more importantly, when seeking
permanent placement in the real
world, students are held account
able for the purchases they make.
As soon as my peers begin to return
to campus the questioning will
begin: "So, what did you do this
summer?" And, after stories of res
cuing Bengal tigers from poachers
and writing Newt Gingrich's press
releases, when the query comes
around to me, I will swallow my
pride and, with as much dignity as I
can muster, explain that I stayed on
campus and edited The Weekly.
Very soon after those words
have escaped my mouth, however, I
think I will continue, "I taught my
self HTML and reread The Great
Gatsby and finished a dozen poems
and learned to drive a standard
transmission."
Even though some eyebrows
might rise at the choices I made, I
make no apologies for my summer.
Although they may be less produc
tive than those of my peers, I have
been more than satisfied. Besides, I
still have one more token left.

Patrick Bernhardt will enter into
semi-retirement thus fall when he be
comes the Daily's director of staff de
velopment.
