## When at Stanford... Campus won't be built in a day 
### Jason Engleman 
The construction boom at Stanford
never seems to end. Currently, 10 major
projects are in progress. Demolition
started this week on the Physics Tank,
which will make way for parts of the new
Science and Engineering Quad.
According to Stewart Kramer, build
ing manager for the Physics Depart
ment, the demolition of the Physics
Tank is "part of a whole project to im
prove science and engineering on cam
pus."
One addition to the space soon to be
formerly occupied by the Physics Tank
will be a new lecture hall to be shared by
the Physics, Biology and Chemistry de
partments. This building, a Materials
Research Annex to the already-existing
McCullough Building, will include one
large lecture hall, one smaller lecture
hall and three underground classrooms.
One noteworthy feature is a rotating
stage, which will allow professors to pre
pare demonstrations for one class even
while another is in progress.
Across campus, construction contin
ues on Green Library West. Opened in

1919, the building was severely damaged
in the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
The project has been delayed because the
original architect went bankrupt and
had to quit and it took almost a year to
get the building permit. In addition, ne
gotiations with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which is helping to
pay the $32 million price tag, have been
slow, according to Barbara Weber, senior
construction manager for the project.
The renovated library, which is un
dergoing the largest seismic upgrade on
campus, will ultimately include ethernet
ports at every seat, which will, according
to Weber, "bring the library up to the
21st century."
Other major construction projects dot
the campus:
• Phase II of the Serra Mall Project
will turn Serra Street into a pedestrian
only mall from the edge of the Main
Quad, past Memorial Auditorium and
Hoover Tower, and to the corner of
Galvez Street, near the Landau Econom
ics Building.
• Memorial Auditorium will be
equipped with new entry ramps to bring
the building into compliance with the

Americans with Disabilities Act. Also,
the water pipes will be replaced, an or
chestra lift to allow musicians to play at
seating level or stage level will be con
structed, and the auditorium will be re
painted, retiled and recarpeted.
• A three-story addition will be added
east of Littlefield Center, which will pro
vide conference and office space for the
Graduate School of Business. Also, the
area between Littlefield and the main
Graduate School of Business building
will be re-landscaped.
• The seismic strengthening and
retrofitting of Buildings 10 and 240 in
the Main Quad will be completed by the
end of August.
• The School of Education building
will have a new elevator, a wheelchair
accessible restroom on its first floor, a
new fire-alarm system and upgraded
power for computer systems. Some of
fices have been remodeled, and the snack
bar will move from the first floor to the
basement.
• Finally, a new sixth floor will be
added to the east wing of Encina Hall,
which will be air-conditioned. An eleva
tor will also be installed.
