Stanford alum dies in Alaska
Diana Forsythe, Class of '69, died Aug. 14 while on a Sierra Club
sponsored trip to Alaska. She was attempting to cross the Sadlreochit
River in waist-deep water when she lost her footing and was swept
into the current.
Forsythe was able to remove her backpack and tried to swim to one
of the sand bars, but the current carried her away. Her body was
found 200 miles downstream; she had apparently hit her head
against one of the rocks in the river.
Friends and colleagues mourned her loss Monday. She was the
daughter of the late Prof. George Forsythe, who founded Stanford's
Computer Science department.
Felony charge in sex case
Felony charges against former Stanford oncologist Robert Steb
bins were reduced Aug. 12 by a judge in Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Stebbins was arrested in May on felony charges that he had sex with
one of his patients and with the mother of another.
The judge dismissed the felony charge that Stebbins had sex with
the mother of a patient, because the woman was not actually his pa
tient.
The other charge was reduced to a misdemeanor after the judge
said that sex with only one patient is a misdemeanor, and not a felony.
Menlo Park files lawsuit
Attorneys for Menlo Park filed a 24-page lawsuit against Palo Alto
Aug. 14, challenging the Sand Hill Road projects approved by Palo
Alto and Stanford. The lawsuit claims the environmental impact re
port was inadequate and asked the court to dismiss it. The lawsuit
contends that Palo Alto committed seven violations of the California
Environmental Quality Act in approving the project's environmental
impact report and requests that the city begin a new report.
Palo Alto and Stanford have 30 days to file a response to the law
suit.
Stanford-UCSF Merger delayed
The merger between Stanford Health Services and the UCSF
medical centers has been delayed from Sept. 1 until Nov. 1. A series
of legal agreements were not completed in time for the University of
California Board of Regents and the Stanford Board of Trustees to
sign them earlier this month.
The regents and trustees now plan to sign the papers at their
meetings in September.
