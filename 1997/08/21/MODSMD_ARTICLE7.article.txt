# Heart surgery debuts at Stanford
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
A new procedure for laser-based
heart surgery was performed for
the first time in the United States
at Stanford Hospital on July 31.
The procedure, called percuta
neous myocardial revasculariza
tion, uses lasers to stimulate blood
flow into the heart, without neces
sitating the kind of highly-invasive
measures used in open-heart
surgery. This procedure can treat
previously untreatable bouts of
angina like those experienced by
67-year-old Kenneth Buch of Las
Vegas.
Buch's angina attacks had con
tinued despite previous heart
surgeries to relieve his suffering,
prompting him to volunteer for the
new, experimental treatment led
by Dr. Stephen Oesterle, an associ
ate professor of medicine and di
rector of Stanford's Cardiac
Catheterization and Coronary In
tervention Laboratories.
A history of heart disease
According to the American
Heart Association, coronary dis
ease is responsible for more than
half the deaths in the United
States each year.
Angina occurs when the heart
muscle doesn't receive enough
blood to function, generally due to
an accumulation of plaque. The re
sult is chest pain. It can occur
when blood flow to the heart is
enough for normal needs but not
enough when the heart's needs in
crease, for example, during moder
ate exercise.
Angina is classified among lev
els according to the severity of pain

it causes. In cases of severe angina,
the pain is "debilitating," Oesterle
said.
The first recourse for severe
angina patients has been either by
pass surgery or an angioplasty.
Some people (called "no-option pa
tients") are unable to accept these
treatments, and live in constant
pain. It can be "terrible, miserable,
and incapacitating," Oesterle said.
"It would be the equivalent of feel
ing a muscle cramp in your arm
every time you brushed your
teeth."
Until recently, it was assumed
that their fate was dismal: live in
pain for the rest of your life. How
ever, PMR may offer some hope.
History and development of
PMR
PMR was developed by a team
of researchers during the past two
years. It is a minimally invasive
procedure that uses a coronary
catheter with a laser to access the
heart of the patient via a small hole
in the upper thigh.
By drilling laser channels
through heart muscles, the growth
process is believed to be stimulated
in the heart. It expands upon a
process called transmyocardial
revascularization, which surgeons
have been performing for years.
Unlike angioplasty and bypass
surgery, PMR enables doctors to
treat angina without surgery. The
process is so minimally invasive
that patients can be conscious dur
ing the process. Buch, the Stanford
patient, was awake but sedated
during the two-hour procedure.
PMR is expected to be less ex
pensive than other treatment
methods. It will also require less
recuperation time and offer less

risk of damage to other organs that
can occur during surgery.
The American Heart Associa
tion expects PMR to benefit people
who are high-risk candidates for a
second bypass or angioplasty, and
people who are too weak to under
go surgery. Oesterle explained
that PMR is a final resort for peo
ple who are not candidates for an
gioplasty or bypass surgery, but it
is not an alternative to them.
Funding and future of PMR
PMR is essentially a product of
Silicon Valley wealth, explained
Oesterle. He said that more than
85 percent of the medical startups
in the United States are situated in
Silicon Valley. "They have a kind
of symbiotic relationship with
Stanford," he explained. Because
of the Stanford Medical Center's
proximity to these firms, compa
nies are eager to fund projects at
Stanford to see where their money
will be going.
PMR was funded by the Cardio-
Genesis Corporation, a medical
startup, which has been known its
a leader in transmyocardial revas
cularization.
Before PMR was allowed to be
tested on humans, Oesterle's crew
practiced on more than 100 ani
mals. After many successful at
tempts, Oesterle decided that it
was time to begin to work on hu
mans. His group then submitted
PMR to the FDA for approval.
In March 1997, permission was
granted to test PMR in Europe. It
has since been tested on 25 pa
tientsin Germany, Switzerland
and other areas of Europe, where
regulations are not as prohibitive
as in the United States. Eighty to
90 percent of all patients in Eu
rope experienced significantly
milder angina after the treatment.
In July, the group received FDA
approval to begin testing on pa
tients in the United States, and a
temporary permit for a trial run
was issued for the procedure. Be
cause of this recent approval, PMR
will now be tested in about 10 med
ical centers nationwide, including
the hospitals at Duke and Cornell
universities. Oesterle has flown to
medical centers in Asia and Eu
rope to teach other doctors how to
use the procedure.
The Stanford team is not al
lowed to change the device, which
is considered the "first generation
prototype" by the FDA. Until a
final approval is issued, no im
provements can be made. Oesterle
conceded that PMR could be im
proved, but that is it good enough
to get the job done for now.
During the next two years, re
searchers will randomize 200 pa
tients to monitor for progress fol
lowing the treatment.
