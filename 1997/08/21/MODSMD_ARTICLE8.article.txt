## Rosy future? Football hopes for championship run 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The last time Stanford played
in the Rose Bowl, Tyrone Willing
iiam had just celebrated his 18th
birthday two days before. Senior
center Blaine Maxfield, who turns
25 today and is two years older
than anybody else on the team,
wasn't born.
They'd like to change that.
And with 14 starters returning
Irom last year's squad that won its
last five games, many Stanford
fans feel that the Liberty Bowl or
the Sun Bowl won't be quite as
satisfying this year.
Willingham's goal remains to
idvance to a 12th game, which
would make him the second coach
in Stanford history to lead three
•onsecutive Stanford teams to a
oowl. Tiny Thornhill did the trick
n his first three years from 1933-
15.
Thornhill went to three Rose
Bowls. Senior running back Mike
Mitchell, in his fifth year with the
Cardinal, would settle for one.
"Really for this team, the sky's
he limit," Mitchell said.
The media thinks the limit is a
>erth in the Cotton or Holiday
Bowl, which is where the Pacific
10 Conference runner-up is head
•d. No. 3 Washington is a unani
nous selection to win the Pac-10.
Jut Arizona State, last year's
•hamp, is picked fifth. USC is com
ng off a 6-6 season. Even the
luskies lost their prized running
>ack Corey Dillon, who decided
>ne year of college was enough.
So far, everything seems to be
n place for the No. 18 Cardinal.
The offensive skill positions
,)ok as solid as any group in the
•onference. Redshirt sophomore
luarterback Chad Hutchinson
oins seniors Mike Mitchell and
Vnthony Bookman at halfback
ind seniors Jon Ritchie and Greg
-omella at fullback. At the wide
tuts senior Damon Dunn and red
shirt sophomore Troy Walters
how speed and promise and can
eturn kicks as proficiently as any
andem in the nation.
The core of last year's un
>roven offensive line returns,

ind left tackle Nathan Parks.
Tight end represents the offense's
>iggest puzzle, as Greg Clark now
■suits up for the San Francisco
I9ers.
A veteran group of defensive
inemen and linebackers will need
to help a young secondary. Seniors
Kailee Wong, Carl Hansen and
Bryan Werner are a tough trio,
and senior Anthony Willis will
most likely try to replace Pete
Swanson at nose tackle. Seniors
Chris Draft and Jon Haskins are
tough inside linebackers.
But Lerov Pruitt, Eliel Swinton

and Josh Madsen are huge shoes
to fill in the backfield.
"We replace those three, and
I'll be a good coach," said defen
sive coordinator Bill Harris.
Still, all the men expected to
start in the secondary — seniors
Alistair White, Kadar Hamilton
and Corey Hill and junior Tim
Smith — have seen significant
time in the past.
Cardinal needs nonconfer
ence wins
Stanford was 1-2 last year prior
to Pac-10 play, with unimpressive
losses to Utah and Wisconsin, who
went on to meet in the Copper
Bowl. The Cardinal hopes to get
rolling early against San Jose
State before the true test — No. 7
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The Cardinal opens the season
at home against the Spartans in a
12:30 p.m. contest that could give
Stanford only its second season
opening win in 11 years. The last
time Stanford notched a victory in
game one was in 1995 — at San
Jose State.
The Spartans finished 3-8 in
former head coach John Ralston's
final year and their first season in
the Western Athletic Conference.
New head coach Dave Baldwin in
herits a squad that lost its best
player, wideout Windrell Hayes, to
an ongoing dispute with Baldwin.
Welcome to Division 1-A, coach.
Last year, San Jose State man
aged just a safety in a 25-2 loss at
Stanford. The Spartans have beat
en Stanford just 10 times in 52
meetings.
The Cardinal has never met the
Tar Heels, who will clash with
Stanford on ESPN2 at 3 p.m. PDT
Sept. 13. Stanford may have
picked a bad year to open their ri
valry — North Carolina feels it has
a chance to dethrone perennial At
lantic Coast Conference champion
Florida State.
Coach Mack Brown has assem
bled one of the top defenses in the
country for the Tar Heels, who re
ceived four No. 1 votes in the pre
season AP poll. Sophomore Dre'
Bly led the nation in interceptions
as a freshman last year.
The offense is tough as well.
Chris Keldorf was a first-team all-
ACC pick at quarterback last year,
and Octavus Barnes and Na
Brown form a difficult duo to stop
at wide receiver.
Stanford opens its Pac-10 slate
at Oregon State Sept. 20, before
returning to Palo Alto for Home
coming against Oregon Sept. 27
and a nonconference battle with
Notre Dame Oct. 4.
Because Stanford and Wash
ington do not meet this year, the
first Rose Bowl tie-breaker for the
teams is nonconference wins.
The 1997 Cardinal will need
more than one.
