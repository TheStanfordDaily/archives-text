No women's volleyball team has
claimed three NCAA titles in a
four-year span.
The 1995 Stanford squad
seemed poised to end that string,
but the Cardinal lost to Texas in a
five-game heartbreaker at the
Final Four.
Now, Lisa Sharpley, Kristin
Folkl, Barbara Ifejika, Debbie Lam
bert and Paula McNamee are try
ing to do what Cary Wendell, Anne
Wicks, Marnie Triefenbach, Wendy
Hromadka and Maureen McLaren
could not.
Folkl and Sharpley headline the
senior class for Stanford, which
opens its national-title defense to
morrow evening at the NACWAA /
State Farm tournament at Maples
Pavilion. No. 2 Penn State will
face No. 8 Brigham Young in the
first match at 5 p.m., and the No. 1
Cardinal will meet No. 12 Texas
A&M at 7 p.m.
Both matches will be televised
on ESPN2 on a tape-delayed basis,
with Stan ford's match beginning at
10:30 p.m. The consolation and
championship matches are slated
for Saturday at 5 and 7 p.m., re
spectively, with the final televised
Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. on ESPN.
A potential Penn State-Stanford
final could be a preview of the na
tional championship match in De
cember. But much must happen be
fore then.
Stanford has a chance to obliter
ate the NCAA's all-time longest
home winning streak. With 49
straight victories, the Cardinal
stands in fourth place, just nine
wins behind Florida's 58-match
spurt that ended in 1994. Stanford

could break the record Nov. 2
against USC.
This weekend's victories are not
automatic.
Texas A&M has never reached
an NCAA regional final but feels
this could be the year to surprise
Nebraska in Big 12 Conference and
reach a new plateau.
"This is, by far, the most talent
ed team I have ever coached during
my 11-year career," said head coach
Laurie Corbelli.
The Aggies were 25-8 last year
and reached the top 10 for the first
time. Texas A&M handed the Stan
ford seniors one of their six career
losses with a thrilling 15-11,15-12,
15-17, 4-15, 15-12 triumph in
Chicago on Sept. 8, 1996, in the
teams' only previous meeting.
Third-team Ail-American out
side hitter Kristie Smedsrud leads
the way for the Aggies, but four
other starters and six reserves re
turn from last year's squad. Like
Stanford, the Aggies need to re
place a starting middle blocker.
Amber Woolsey should get the nod
to replace Page White, an all-Big 12
player last year.
Penn State has never been
ranked higher at the start of a sea
son. With a 20-18, fifth-game loss in
the East regional final last year, the
Nittany Lions would like to atone
for its postseason agony.
" I hope there are enough return
ing players that recognize exactly
how close they were to returning to
the Final Four," said longtime head
coach Russ Rose. They "let a great
opportunity slip through their
hands."
Last year, Penn State started
three freshmen. But setter Bonnie
Bremner, middle hitter Lauren
Cacciamani and Carrie Schonveld

shone in their debut seasons, and
senior Ail-American middle hitter
Terri Zemaitis joins them to form a
formidable lineup.
The Nittany Lions' biggest hole
comes at outside hitter, where All
American Angie Hammer has grad
uated.
"I think that with the loss of
Angie, as well as of our other three
seniors, our volleyball IQ went
down significantly," Rose said.
Brigham Young head coach
Elaine Michaelis has no such wor
ries.
"With starters coming back in
every position and a year of experi
ence for our setter, I think one of
our biggest strengths will be expe
rience," Michaelis said. "This is
also the most athletic team we've
had in years."
Last year's Cougars came within
one match of the Final Four, and
setter Anna-Lena Smith, the fresh
man of the year in the Western Ath -
letic Conference's Mountain Divi
sion, ran the show. Two-time All
American Amy Steele gave Smith
an imposing target.
