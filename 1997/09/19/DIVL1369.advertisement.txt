WHAT'S NEW IN HISTORY?
[ * comparative * thematic " provocative
The Department of History is proud to announce a new series of undergraduate lecture courses, specially
conceived to introduce students to the variety of questions that we ask about the past and the variety of
approaches we use to explain its meaning. These courses are not designed like the usual survey level course.
