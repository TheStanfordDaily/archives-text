Look who wants our recipe...
£ April IH, IW7
Dear Sir,
I was a guest at youi restaurant and I chose to eat two of your specials
and they were excellent. One was the corn soup with cumin. Would
you be willing to send me the recipe? I liked it so much that I would
enjoy preparing it for my husband (I'm not a good enough cook to
piepare the main course, the gulled dorado, but I compliment you on
that as well )
I look forward to my next meal at Pro Itono I shall recommend your
restaurant to my friends in the San Francisco area.
Sincerly,
Susan Sheehan
