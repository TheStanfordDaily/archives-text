498-1440
Modem Pool
Access
Has Changed
As of Autumn Quarter 1997, dial-in connections to Stanford's
Central Modem Pool (498-1440) are no longer allowed from the
many campus dorms and houses that provide individual Ethernet
access for every resident. The University established this policy in
1996 to free up dial-in resources for off-campus users as it brings
the much faster Ethernet service to on-campus residents. Buildings
where dial-in access to 498-1440 are still allowed are listed below.
Residences still providing dial-in access to 498-1440
Residents of the buildings listed below still have access to the Central Modem Pool, but better
alternatives are probably already available. Contact your Resident Computing Coordinator
(RCC) for information about your SUNet connection alternatives. You can find your RCC's contact
info on the Web at http://rescomp.stanford.edu/RCC_Directory.html or by calling Residential
Computing at 3-4800.
