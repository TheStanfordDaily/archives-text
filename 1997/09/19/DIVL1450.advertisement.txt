Introducing* the fastest, easiest way
to hook up your phone.
Attention class!
It's your first day on campus, and the first thing you need to do is get
your phone hooked up. Unfortunately, thousands of other students will
be calling us with the same priority. Now there's a better way: If you're
living off campus, just go to www.pacbell.com/college and order your
phone service on line. A few clicks with a mouse, a little typing, and
you'll be connected in no time.
To make it even easier, we've organized four suggested combina
tions of service. These flexible combinations will help you save
time and organize your life-all priced especially for students.
So the choice is yours. Go on line and order your phone service the easy
way at www.pacbell.com/college.
