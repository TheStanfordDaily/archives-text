A Message from Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford Chapter
- - • ««
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their undergraduate scholarly
accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is open to undergraduates of all majors. To
be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve academic distinction in the major as well as in courses
across a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about one
fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines (revised July, 1997*) define "breadth" of study as excellence beyond the major field. To
be considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring Quarter, at least
three courses iin each of the following three major domains of knowledge: Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math;
and Social Sciences. To be considered for election, transfer students must have taken at least two courses at Stanford in
each of these major domains.
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the BULLETIN for the
undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Courses taken for GER Area 1 will not be
considered as satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
A grade of"+" or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" criterion is not considered
a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students wishing to
be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of students' names from their
academic records before consideration. Students who desire that their records not be made available for consideration by
the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old Union.
" NOTE: Seniors who graduate in 1997-98 will be covered under the old guidelines (see Stanford Bulletin 1996-97).
