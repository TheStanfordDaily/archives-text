Let Yourself Go
A fantasy. An insurrection.
A dream dispossessed.
A fatal confrontation,
dance of desire.

You can see it all—live —at A.C.T.,
San Francisco's Tony Award-winning
professional theater. Have a unique and
unforgettable sensory experience, on the spur
of the moment, for the price of a movie.
We're appearing live on campus September 25.
Stop by. Talk about theater, pick up a season
calendar, see a show.
