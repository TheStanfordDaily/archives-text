entrees that are high in calories.
Sov gluten, a popular Chinese vegetarian ingredient provides protein without the
calories. Soy gluten is solid and contains the liber and protein ol soybean but is
stare h-lree and cholesterol-lree. At Ming's, we prepare soy gluten dishes the same
way we prepare some ol tint most popular meat and poultry dishes. I'Or instance, in
the vegetarian versions ol our lamous Chit ken salad and Cashew C hicken, we
