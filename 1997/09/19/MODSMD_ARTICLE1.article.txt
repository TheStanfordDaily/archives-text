James Montoya envisions great possibilities in his new
position as Vice Pmvost for Student Affairs as he leaves
his previous post as Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid.
"I very much look forward to the broad perspective that
this position offers, ranging from technology to manage
ment of a much larger staff," said Montoya.
"I am excited about the opportunity to work with grad
uate students and graduate student concerns as well as with
undergraduate student concerns, as well as the opportuni
ty to work with the cabinet of the University," he added.
Montoya intends to focus on the big picture as he plans
for the future of student affairs.
In the upcoming year, Montoya will concentrate on the
issues of using technology to better meet student needs,
implementation of the new judicial system, and space for
student activities and the student affairs office.
Montoya will also focus on researching student needs.
"1 have a special interest in areas related to food and
food service, so I hope students will feel free to invite me
to eat at their residence halls not only as a way of getting to
know me, but also giving me the opportunity to sample res
idence hall food," said Montoya.
"We also will be conducting focus group this fall as
one way of developing a questionnaire we will be sending

compass both graduate students and un
dergraduates, Montoya intends to con
tinue to maintain ties to the area of ad
missions and financial aid.
"This position gives me the opportu
nity to stay in touch with many of the is
sues that interested me in admissions and
financial aid," said Montoya.
"I appreciate the fact that I will be
able to work closely with the new Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid Itob
Kinnally."
Although Montoya has been very
busy preparing for his new position, he
did find time to offer Dean Kinnally
some advice.
"We talked a lot about balance and
how it is important not only to !*• visible
on campus, but to visible off campus

as a national spokesperson for higher ed
ucation," said Montoya.
"We also talked about the most en
joyable aspects of the position, and that is
having an impact on the life of students
in a way that very few people have," he
added.
As Montoya's responsibilities
change with the new position, he will no
longer appear on stage in the Hig Game
Gaieties festivities.
"I have had an extraordinarily enjoy
able time participating in Gaieties," said
Montoya. "It is Dean Kinnally's time to
shine."
Montoya assures the students that his
replacement will be up to the task.
"As I was meeting with various dean
candidates, I thought 'would this person
enjoy being in Gaieties?'," said Mon
toya. " There was no question in my mind
that Mob Kinnally would thoroughly
enjoy that opportunity."
