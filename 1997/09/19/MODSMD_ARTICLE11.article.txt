American astronaut in danger?
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Russia's aging, leaky Mir
space station poses an unacceptable risk and NASA
should not send any more Americans, leaders of the
House Science Committee said yesterday after a hearing
on Mir safety.
Astronaut David Wolf is scheduled to be launched
on space shuttle Atlantis next week to the Mir. He is to
become the sixth astronaut to live on Mir, replacing
Michael Foale, who has been on the Russian space sta
tion since May.
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis, chairman of
the committee, said there is enough evidence "to force
NASA to re-evaluate whether to send David Wolf up on
the shuttle next week."
Peggy Wilhide, a NASA spokeswoman, said space
shuttle plans are unchanged.
"We are confident in our people and our process,"
she said.
As a final safeguard, NASA is awaiting a safety
report from Thomas Stafford, a former astronaut, who
has been in Russia talking with space officials, Wilhide
added.
