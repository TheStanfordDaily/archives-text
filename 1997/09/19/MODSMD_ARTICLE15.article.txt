# Proposition 209 goes into effect
## Stanford still has no plans to change University's affirmative action policies 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
In light of recent legal develop
ments regarding Proposition the
University continues to stand by its
commitment to affirmative action,
said Director of University Communi
cations Terry Shepard.
California's anti-affirmative action
ballot initiative, Prop. 2(W, approved
in November's election, was officially
implemented Aug. 28 after clearing
the last of several legal hurdles.
The legislation prohibits state
agencies from using racial or gender
preferences in hiring and contracting
decisions. As a private institution, this
prohibition does not apply to Stan
ford's admissions and hiring policies.
The ballot initiative was passed in
November's election with 54 percent

of the voting public in favor of it.
A Daily poll of registered Califor
nia voters at Stanford taken before the
November election showed a 5 1 ).3 per
cent majority opposed to Prop. 2() l >,
with l c >.h percent in favor of it and 21
percent undecided.
At a Faculty Senate meeting in Oc
tober, University President Gerhard
Casper affirmed Stanford's commit
ment to its affirmative action policies
"It is the responsibility of educa
tional institutions such as Stanford to
find and educate those who can be
come the leaders of the future in a mul
tiethnic and multiracial society," said
Casper. "Alas, our society is i|iiite
color-conscious, and we therefore
cannot yet afford to be colorblind."
"We do not admit minorities to do
them a favor. We want students from a
variety of backgrounds to help lull ill

our educational responsibilities,"
Casper added.
Asst. Dean of Students and Direc
tor of El Centro Chicano Frances
Morales said that since Prop. 2(W
passed in the November election, she
has received phone calls from con
cerned parents of prospective appli
cants.
" 1 hey 're under the belief that Prop
2(W affects Stanford," she said. "I ex
plain to them that Stanford is commit
ted to its affirmative action policies."
Because of federal laws requiring
institutions receiving federal money
to practice affirmative action, any
attempts at changing Stanford's at
firmative action policies in a manner
similar to Prop. 2() 4 > would be diffi
cult.
"It's very complicated," said Di
rector of the Office for Multicultural

Development S.illv Dickson about ef
forts to make sweeping affirmative ac
tion policy changes. "People try t(
simplify it and it can't be done."
I he implementation of Prop. 20*' at
the state level has been difficult he
cause it conflicts with other portion;
of California law.
On Sept. 9, (iovernor Pete Wilson
a Republican, asked the Democrat
controlled state legislature to repeal o
amend more than M) statutes that In
said violate Prop. 2l) ( > Ihe state legis
lature is on recess until January.
The text of Prop 2(l'' reads, "Tlx
state shall not discriminate against, o
grant preferential treatment to, any in
dividual or group on the basis of race
sex, color, ethnicity or national origii
in the operation ol public employ
ment, public education or public con
trading."
