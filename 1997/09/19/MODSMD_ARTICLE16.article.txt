# Knight Fellowship Program founder dies
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Communication Prof. Emeritus Lyle
Nelson, who founded Stanford's Knight
Fellowship Program for journalists, died
on Sept. 5 of heart failure.
At Stanford, Nelson held the posi
tions of director of University relations,
Communication Department chair and
Thomas M. Storke Distinguished Pro
fessor of Communication. On the na
tional level, he served as chairman of the
National Board of Foreign Scholarships,
which oversees the Fulbright program,
and staff director of the 1965 White
House Conference on Education.
Nelson, 79, placed a premium on
honesty and integrity in reporters, said
former Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, w ho came to Stanford from
the University of Michigan at the same
time as Nelson. "He was an ardent be
liever in open communication, the free
press and ethics," Beyers said.
When the campus erupted into

protest over the Vietnam War, Nelson
maintained a philosophy of presenting
the University "the way it is. The minute
you try to gloss it over and present it in a
distorted light, you're in for long-run
trouble," he told alumni.
l"he "tell it like it is" attitude also
played a part in Nelson's teaching, as he
tried to train journalism students to be re
sponsible and honest.
Beyers said Nelson once told a stu
dent w ho had been caught cheating that
it shouldn't matter whether other stu
dents cheated or not.
"Isn't there room for one honest per
son who says. But my standards won't
permit me to do so'?," Nelson chal
lenged. "What happens to a democratic
form of society if all citizens say, '1 have
no obligations to rules and standards of
decency and honesty'?"
With attitudes such as that student's.
Nelson warned, "the great opportunities
of the age of communication w ill go un
fulfilled."
To avoid that, he called on reporters

to "overcome or surmount their own
egotism, vanity, greed and aggressive
ness ... strive to develop characteristics
of fairness, openness, humility and the
willingness to share."
Nelson was born Feb. 2K, 19IS, in
Yamhill, Ore., and graduated from the
University of Oregon, where hew as ed
itor of the campus newspaper. His in
volvement with student newspapers
continued at Stanford, w hen he support
ed The Daily in its move to become in
dependent of the University after a po
lice raid on The Daily's offices in 1971.
In 1966, Nelson founded a West
Coast counterpart to Harvard Universi
ty's Nieman Fellows. ITie Stanford pro
gram — endowed by the John S. Knight
Foundation in 1982 — brings profes
sional journalists from around the world
to Stanford for a year of study.
Nelson and his wife, Corrine, "have
literally been Stanford family to hun
dreds of journalists, particularly those
from overseas," while working with the
program, Beyers said. At a program re

union in June, the Knight Foundation
announced a $250,(XX) gilt to the Lyle
and Corrine Nelson International Jour
nalism Fellowship.
A memorial service tor Nelson is
scheduled for Sept. 2 l ) at 3 p.m. at
Memorial Church.
