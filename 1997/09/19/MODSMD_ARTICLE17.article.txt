## Virus vs. virus Turning the tables on HIV infection 
### Ravi Patel Contributing writer 
How does one attack HIV, a virus that hides itself in the cells of
the immune system? According to researchers at Yale University,
with another virus.
Researchers at Yale have taken a common and relatively harm
less livestock virus and changed its genes so that it targets HlV
infected cells and destroys them.
The virus, called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), effectively

controlled HIV infection in laboratory-grown T-cells and reduced the amount HIV to
barely detectable levels, according to a report appearing in the September 5 issue of
Cell.
The study's senior scientist, John K. Rose from Yale's Pathology and Cell Biolo
gy Departments, calls this a completely new approach that can be used to control dis
ease.
HIV works by displaying a protein called gp 120 that binds to a protein called CD4
and a coreceptor, CXCR4, both found on helper T-cells.
HIV then proceeds to invade the T-cell and take over iLs internal machinery, repli
cating itself while impairing the function of the cell and leading to the cell's destruc
tion. During this process, viral proteins including gpl2o are expressed on the surface
of the infected and dying T-cell.
Ironically, the researchers used HlV's method of infection against itself. They
adapted the VSV virus to look like an uninfected T-cell by replacing the protein shell
around the virus with the CD4 protein and a coreceptor.

Because of the gpl2o expressed on their membranes, HIV-infected cells unknow
ingly bind to the altered VSV viruses. The infected cells are in turn attacked by the
VSV virus and kitted.
In the experiment, the Yale team infected human T-cell lines with a laboratory
strain of HIV. They then added the altered VSV virus and discovered that the VSV
cut the amount of HIV to levels between 300 and 1(),(KK) times lower than the levels
of HIV produced in control cells.
One limitation of the virus is that a specific strain is needed for different types of
viruses depending on which coreceptors they attack along with C'D4. Because T-cells
are infected only in the later stages of HIV infection, and the coreceptor that is cur
rently targeted is the CXCR4 found on T-cells, this treatment is only g<x>d for late
stage HIV infection.
Researchers are currently working on viruses that incorporate coreceptors such as
CCRS and CCR3 found on macrophages, cells that are infected early in the HIV pro
gression. By incorporating CCRS and CCR3, in addition to CXCR4, VSV treatment
can potentially be applied to early-stage HIV infection as well.
Before the effect of the VSV system on infected humans can be gauged, animal
models must be tested. Rose regards the virus as "likely to be sate," but human clin
ical trials are at least a year away.

Theoretically, the altered VSV virus
poses no threat to normal human cells be
cause the proteins placed on it can only
bind to HIV infected cells. Even the VSV
virus in its unaltered form rarely infects
humans and exhibits either no symptoms
or only mild flu-like symptoms.
Despite HlV's well known propensi
ty to mutate to avoid defenses, it is un
likely that resistance will develop to VSV
therapy. "If the HIV virus mutated to

avoid binding to CD4 or a coreceptor, it
would no longer be able to attack any
human cells," says Prof. Patricia Jones,
chair of the biology department.
Jones adds that even "if the treatment
does not completely eliminate the HIV
infection, it can be helpful in limiting the
HIV virus and keeping the number of T
cells in the body up."
Because of their ability to target spe
cific cells, VSV-like systems have the po
tential to help treat other diseases, like
cancer. Researchers envision using the
VSV virus to shuttle viruses uno die body
that destroy infected or cancerous cells.
