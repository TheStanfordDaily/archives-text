# Quakes inspire new studies
## Risk index determined 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
If you crawl under a desk every
time you sense the tremor of a bull
dozer trundling past your dormitory,
relax. According to the newly devel
oped Earthquake Disaster Risk
Index, students ambling through
Stanford's arcades may be just as
vulnerable to earthquakes as their
counterparts walking through Har
vard's hallowed halls.
The index, which rates overall
earthquake risk in 10 different cities,
was developed by Rachel Davidson,
a Stanford doctoral student in civil
engineering, for her doctoral thesis.
According to the index, Tokyo is
high risk with a score of 54. San
Francisco's score of 37 makes it less
risky than Tokyo, but, surprisingly,
about as risky as Boston and St.
Louis, which have scores of 39 and
36 respectively.
What makes Boston so similar to
San Francisco in overall earthquake
risk is its much higher proportion of
seismically unsound buildings.
Because of the instability of so much
of the built environment in Boston,
the overall risk posed by the admit
tedly infrequent earthquake is quite
high.
In addition to accounting for the
size and frequency of earthquakes,
Davidson used four other factors—
exposure, vulnerability, external con
text and emergency response and
recovery—to compile the index.
She also looked at variables such
as geographical distribution of inhab
itants, likelihood of physical dam

Researchers are working on methods to prevent damage such as this from happening again in the
event of another large earthquake.
