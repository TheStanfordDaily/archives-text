# Quakes inspire new studies
## Risk index determined 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
If you crawl under a desk every
time you sense the tremor of a bull
dozer trundling past your dormitory,
relax. According to the newly devel
oped Earthquake Disaster Risk
Index, students ambling through
Stanford's arcades may be just as
vulnerable to earthquakes as their
counterparts walking through Har
vard's hallowed halls.
The index, which rates overall
earthquake risk in 10 different cities,
was developed by Rachel Davidson,
a Stanford doctoral student in civil
engineering, for her doctoral thesis.
According to the index, Tokyo is
high risk with a score of 54. San
Francisco's score of 37 makes it less
risky than Tokyo, but, surprisingly,
about as risky as Boston and St.
Louis, which have scores of 39 and
36 respectively.
What makes Boston so similar to
San Francisco in overall earthquake
risk is its much higher proportion of
seismically unsound buildings.
Because of the instability of so much
of the built environment in Boston,
the overall risk posed by the admit
tedly infrequent earthquake is quite
high.
In addition to accounting for the
size and frequency of earthquakes,
Davidson used four other factors—
exposure, vulnerability, external con
text and emergency response and
recovery—to compile the index.
She also looked at variables such
as geographical distribution of inhab
itants, likelihood of physical dam

Researchers are working on methods to prevent damage such as this from happening again in the
event of another large earthquake.
age, degree of disruption to the economy,
and efficacy of emergency response and
recovery teams, among others.
"It has become clear that the old para
digm of evaluating risk and developing
mitigation strategies needs a fresh and in
novative look," said Haresh Shah, profes
sor emeritus of civil engineering and
Davidson's thesis adviser.
"Rachel's work, for the first time,
makes it possible for various decision
makers to understand the risk of potential

disaster that their communities face, and
how it compares with what other commu
nities around the world are facing."
Communicating the substantial dan
ger posed by earthquakes is the goal of
Davidson's research.
"We've gained a lot of knowledge in
the study or earthquake hazards, but there
is a big gap in implementing it. We need a
new tool to communicate what we know
about earthquake risk," Davidson said.
According to Gil Jamieson, chief of
risk assessment in the mitigation direc
torate of the Federal Emergency Manage
ment Agency, Davidson's index will be
an important tool assisting officials at all

levels of government in formulating poli
cy.
Evaluating the risk faced by each com
munity and targeting it is a necessary pre
requisite to achieving the agency's goal of
"disaster-resistant communities, he said."
Hie approach can also be adapted to
assess risks for fires, floods, hurricanes
and other natural disasters. Combining
such risk assessments could produce a
multi-hazard total risk index that could
guide disaster-mitigation policy.
A comprehensive total risk index
could also be useful to the government as
a guide for how to deploy its emergency
response efforts, said Davidson.
