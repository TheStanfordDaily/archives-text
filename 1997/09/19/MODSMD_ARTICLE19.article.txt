Californians are accustomed to living in a state of
perpetual disaster preparedness â€” storing canned
foods and bottled water, tying down water heaters
and buying pricey earthquake insurance.
However, recent research by Anju Gupta, a post
doctoral researcher in civil and environmental engi
neering, has produced some unexpected results
regarding the concept of preparedness.
According to Gupta, "investing the same amount

of money in earthquake protection kits and seismic
upgrades... is a better investment lor Californians
than paying the premiums on the policies issued by
the California larthquakc Authority."
In her doctoral thesis, Gupta used a comprehen
sive approach to evaluate the effectiveness of differ
ent earthquake mitigation strategies such as earth
quake insurance or retrofitting. Previous approaches
generally used one specific criterion to evaluate
those strategies.
Gupta also combined perspectives from the 112 ields
of structural engineering, economics, geology, insur

anee and sociology to analyze cost effectiveness of
seven different earthquake mitigation strategies, a
method that results in wli.it she calls strategy eflec
tiveness charts (SI:C). She compiled her charts
"partly by aggregating studies and partly by starting
new studies."
According to Richard Roth, chief pioperty casu
alty actuary with the California Insurance Depart
ment, "typically, experts in one field have very little
understanding of what experts in the other fields are
doing. So methods like the SliC that integrate these
