# New approach toward quake preparedness unveiled
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Californians are accustomed to living in a state of
perpetual disaster preparedness — storing canned
foods and bottled water, tying down water heaters
and buying pricey earthquake insurance.
However, recent research by Anju Gupta, a post
doctoral researcher in civil and environmental engi
neering, has produced some unexpected results
regarding the concept of preparedness.
According to Gupta, "investing the same amount

of money in earthquake protection kits and seismic
upgrades... is a better investment lor Californians
than paying the premiums on the policies issued by
the California larthquakc Authority."
In her doctoral thesis, Gupta used a comprehen
sive approach to evaluate the effectiveness of differ
ent earthquake mitigation strategies such as earth
quake insurance or retrofitting. Previous approaches
generally used one specific criterion to evaluate
those strategies.
Gupta also combined perspectives from the 112 ields
of structural engineering, economics, geology, insur

anee and sociology to analyze cost effectiveness of
seven different earthquake mitigation strategies, a
method that results in wli.it she calls strategy eflec
tiveness charts (SI:C). She compiled her charts
"partly by aggregating studies and partly by starting
new studies."
According to Richard Roth, chief pioperty casu
alty actuary with the California Insurance Depart
ment, "typically, experts in one field have very little
understanding of what experts in the other fields are
doing. So methods like the SliC that integrate these
disparate factors are extremely worth
while."
Gupta also assessed the efficacy ci
earthquake kits and the seven earth
quake mitigation strategies — including
high-level, moderate-level and low
level retrofitting insurance policies with
a 10-percent deductible, a 15-percent
deductible, a hypothetical policy with a
3-percent deductible and coverage up to
15 percent of the value of the structure.
The most effective policy, she con
cluded, was to target high-level retro
fitting at people living in older buildings
constructed before stringent earthquake
building codes were implemented. This
targeted strategy maximized the number
of lives saved and minimized the cost of

rebuilding.
"Her work provides a clearer picture
of how various technical and nontech
nical strategies improve the perfor
mance of urban areas in future earth
quakes," said Haresh Shah, professor
emeritus of civil engineering.
"Her results could be of tremendous
value to local, state and federal govern
ments in their efforts to develop and im
plement cost-effective risk reduction
strategies."
An added advantage of Gupta's strat
egy is that it can be fine-tuned to reflect
a change in the relative value of saving
lives versus reducing economic disrup
tion.
"Because the range of issues in
volved are explicitly accounted for, SEC
allows us to identify the best strategies
on the basis of real benefits, not on theo
retical ones," Gupta said.
