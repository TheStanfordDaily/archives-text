# Lunn sentenced in graffiti case
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
John Jason Lunn, a senior and track team
member who defaced a Suites eating club
with anti-gay graffiti last spring, has been
sentenced to two years probation.
Lunn pleaded no contest to charges of mis
demeanor vandalism in Palo Alto Municipal

Court on July 31. As part of his sentence,
Lunn must pay a $1()0 fine, perform 160
hours of community scrvice, seek counseling
and retrain from drinking alcohol.
Lunn could not be reached for comment.
Homophobic graffiti — including the
statements, "Gays should kill themselves"
and "Faggots are the downfall of the U.S.!"
— was found scrawled on the walls and table

cloths of The Bollard eating club on April 7.
A wall clock was stolen, and juice bars and
coffee grounds were found strewn on the
floor.
Lunn came forward the next day and ad
mitted his role in the crime. According to in
formation given to the police by Lunn's girl-
friend, she, Lunn and a student from
UC-Berkeley had gone to a movie to
gether on the evening of April 6 and
then returned to Lunn's room, where
they started drinking.
They entered the eating club look
ing for something to eat, at which point
Lunn began writing on the walls.
Lunn's girlfriend and the other
man, who were not charged, told police
that they had asked Lunn to stop but
that he did not.
Stanford students and administra
tors reacted to the vandalism with
shock and anger. Troy Gilbert, the ad
viser of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, called the vandal
ism "a complete anathema to the idea

of a university," and Dean of Students
Marc Wais declared it "a very sad day
at Stanford."
More than 300 students participated
in a rally later that month in response to
the vandalism and other hate crimes on
campus. At the rally, students chanted,
"We're here, we're queer, we will not
stand for fear; we're here,
straight, we will not stand for hate."
Santa Clara County District Attor
ney Karyn Sinunu recommended last
spring that Lunn be given the maxi
mum penalty possible and said she
hoped he would serve jail time for the
offense.
In a recent interview, Sinunu ex
plained that Lunn had received a typi
cal sentence in a graffiti case involving
a first-time vandal but said she was dis
appointed.
Sinunu said she did not agree with

the outcome. "I personally think (the
vandalism) was much more than that."
Sinunu had wanted to try the of
fense as a hate crime but could not be
cause of a loophole in California law:
Crimes can only qualify as hate crimes
if they are federal offenses.
However, vandalism cases must in
volve damages of $S,(XX) or more to
qualify as a federal offense.
But Sinunu said that because her of
ficial complaint against Lunn repeats
the homophobic statements verbatim,
Lunn's permanent record will reveal
the nature of the crime.
A previous anti-gay incident on
campus, the 1994 vandalism of the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture by six var
sity athletes, also could not be prose
cuted as a hate crime because of a dif
ferent loophole instate law, Sinunu
said.

In that case, in which $10,(XX) of
damage was done, state law did not
recognize hate crimes against institu
tions rather than individuals.
"It's unbelievable the two loop
holes that Stanford has faced," Sinunu
said. "Two of these hate crimes have
come out of one of the most enlight
ened institutions. 1 don't understand
that."
As well as criminal charges, Lunn
faced an investigation under the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard,
which dictates a code of behavior for
all Stanford students.
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, Lunn's case has already
gone through the Stanford judicial
process and has been resolved.
Wais declined to give the results of
the investigation for confidentiality
reasons.
