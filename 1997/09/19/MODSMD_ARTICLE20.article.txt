U.S. residents urged to
prepare for heavy rains
as El Nino approaches
Stanford students accustomed to dry
California weather should start thinking
about stocking up on umbrellas, rain-

coats and galoshes. People living in flood-prone areas
should seriously consider sandbags and flood insurance.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) is asking residents of the United States to pre
pare for expected heavy rains and increased flooding
problems associated with this year's powerful El Nino.
"It is less expensive to protect homes and property
before they are damaged than to repair them afterwards,"
said FEMA Director James L. Witt.
El Nino is a periodic tropical Pacific Ocean climate
pattern characterized by warm, long lived ocean cur
rents. El Nino usually results in increased precipitation
and higher temperatures for many parts of the United
States. The El Nino for this winter, however, is expect
ed to be the strongest since the winter of 1982-1983.
Unusually wet weather has been predicted by the
National Oceanic and A.mospheric Administration's
Climate Prediction Center (NOAA) for the southern part
of the U.S. from California all the way to the Atlantic
coast.
More information about the upcoming El Nino can
be obtained by visiting the NOAA's web site at

Study casts doubt on
effectiveness of TB vaccine
A tuberculosis vaccine that has been
given to more people worldwide than any
other vaccine may be ineffective, accord
ing to a recent analysis by Stanford School
of Medicine researches.

Peter Small, an assistant professor of medicine, and
Marcel Behr, a postdoctoral fellow, found that bacterial
strains used in the current vaccine have been cultured lor
too long in the laboratory and are now substantially less
effective at preventing disease.
The vaccine, called BCG or Bacille Calmette-Guerin,
is a li v e bacterial vaccine taken from a form of tuberculo
sis that affects cows. It was First used in humans in 1921
following development by two French scientists named
Calmette and Guerin.
Apparently, the bacterial strains used for the BCG vac
cine have been continuously cultured for many years.
Before modern technology permitted freeze-drying of
bacteria for long-term storage, scientists were forced to
keep growing the bacteria in the laboratory. The only way
to keep the cultures growing was to transfer subsamples of
bacteria to flasks of fresh culture broth every couple of
weeks. Each transfer is called an "in vitro passage."
Since 1921, some of the current vaccine strains have
gone through as many as 1,5(K) passages. Small and Behr
analyzed five BCG strains and found that loss of effec
tiveness correlated with the number of passages they had
undergone. The researchers believe that the BCG vaccines
have evolved in the laboratory and are now significantly
weaker than the First vaccines developed in 1921.
"Our findings provide a very interesting starting point for
scientists who are trying to improve the vaccine," said Small.
