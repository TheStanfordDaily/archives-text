# Single-electron diode proposed

With the advent of
semiconductors and
smaller electrical com
ponents, computers and
other equipment can
now fit into the palm of
vour hand. and

researchers continue to look for ways to
make the technology even smaller.
Wayne Richardson, a research asso
ciate in Stanford's Gin/ton laboratory,
recently proposed the first-ever design
of a single-electron diode a revolu
tionary breakthrough in mesoscopic
electronics that will open up many new
areas of research m tins field.
"Ibis is the first tune that sorneoni
has shown theoretically bow a single
electron diode can l>e built," Richardson
said.
Ordinary diodes are important com
ponents in electronics because they
allow electrical current flow in one
direction but not the other. Ibe advan
tages of using a single-electron diode

include increased fxiwcr efficiency and
an enormous amount of sensitivity in
electrical equipment that was unthink
able until now.
I expect that all the normal uses of
the ordinary diode which needs thou
sands and thousands of electrons to
work can in principle In.' handled by a
single electron tunneling diode," said
Richardson.
I he design of the single-electron
diode is based upon what is termed .1 |>-
n junction." A [> n junction is simply a
crystal made of two different materials.
Hie "p-typc" material contains many
positively charged particles called
"Ilol' â€¢ " whereas the "n type" material
coma. negatively charged particles
called "donors."
P-typc material is placed next to n
ty|)e material, and soon, a region called
the "depletion layer" forms between
them. Ihe depletion layer allows current
to How only in one direction. I lectrual
contacts are then placed on either side of
the crystal to form a normal diode.
Richardson uses gallium arsenide in
his design lor a single electron diode.

Gallium arsenide is purposely contami
nated, or "doped," with different kinds
of impurities to create the pn junction.
Ibe impurities create the charge in the
p- and n type materials When a heavily
doped pn junction is cooled to temper
atures around absolute zero, it acts as a
single electron diode.
Richardson's research on single
electron diodes has also made the design
of a single electron transistor [xtssible.
A transistor s main function is to ampli
fy current or voltage tor example,
when a voltage is applied to a transistor,
it can output .1 current that is a multiple
of the input current.
Previous single electron transistors
were unable to provide 1 ufHe ic ntly
stable current, but wiih Richardson's
research, tins device is possible. Other
single electron devices similar to the
transistor and diode could also be
designed using the new technology.
Although plans have not been made
to build this device, Richardson hopes
that lie and some of his colleagues at
Stanford can construct a working proto
type in al>out two years
