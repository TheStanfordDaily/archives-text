# BEHIND THE SCENES
## 
### 
Gerhard Casper
Among Casper's many
achievments since taking the
helm of the University in 1992,
the president has undertaken an
overhaul of undergraduate educa
tion,creating new programs such
as Sophomore College and the
new freshman seminars, Stanford
Introductory Studies. He has suc
ceeded in these initiative even
during at time of tightening bud
gets and consolidation.
Before coming to Stanford,
Casper had served at the Universi
ty of Chicago since 1966, begin
ning as an associate professor of
political science and law and be
coming dean of Chicago's law
school and eventually provost of
the university.

Paul Brest
After 19 years as a Stanford
law professor, Paul Brest accepted
the position of dean of the Law
School in 1987. An expert in con
stitutional law and civil rights, he
has kept the Law School at the
forefront of law education in the
country.
He began his career with a
clerkship on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals and spent two years working
in Jackson, Miss., ta farther civil
rights for African Americans. Just
before coming to Stanford, Brest
spent a year as law clerk to U.S.
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Harlan.
He has held the Kenneth and
Harle Montgomery Chair in Pub
lic Interest Law and is now the
Richard E. Professor of law.

Franklin Orr
When Petroleum Engineering
Prof. Franklin "Lynn" Orr was
named permanent dean of the
School of Earth Sciences in April
1995, he knew his biggest task
would be dealing with the Uni
versity's ongoing budget cuts.
But his plans also included
improving what he called already
good programs in the earth sci
ences. He was active two years
ago in an extensive review of the
school and followed up on a
committee's recommendations.
Before coming to Stanford in
1985, Orr taught at the New Mex
ico Institute of Mining and Tech
nology, did research at the Shell
Development Company and acted
as assistant to the director of the
Office of Federal Activities of the
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

A. Michael Spence
He came to Stanford from its
eternal rival in all matters academ
ic, but former Dean of the Harvard
Faculty of Arts and Science
Spence has been successful in his
move to a focus on business.
Spence came into his dean's
position hoping to give the already
highly ranked Business School a
more firm "sense of direction."
Also the Philip H. Knight Pro
fessor of Economics and Manage
ment, Spence has been widely rec
ognized, winning the J.K. Gal
braith Prize for Excellence in
Teaching and the John Bates Clark
Medal from the American Eco
nomic Association, among others.

SO YOU RECOGNIZE Casper, and probably
Condi too. You might even know what jobs
they hold, but do you know what they actually
do?
Most likely, you don't, and you don't know much
about the rest of the people who run the University,
either.
President Casper is the leader of Stanford Univer
sity, but under his guidance, responsibilities are di

vided among many administrators, including the 12
who comprise the University Cabinet.
The 11 individuals who advise the president — the
provost, the academic deans, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center director and the Hoover Institu
tion director — each guide their respective Universi
ty divisions, reporting to the president and imple
menting his directives while also carrying out their
own initiatives.

Condoleezza Rice
As provost, Rice is Stanford's
chief budget and academic officer,
with jurisdiction over all areas of
the University.
Rice has spent much of her
four years as provost dealing
with budget cuts, formulating
and carrying out $18 million in
cuts from the University budget
over three years. While working
on the task, she has found time to
teach both during the year and at
Sophomore College.
Rice, a political science profes
sor, also serves as top aide on
President George Bush's National
Security Council. She is a recog
nized expert in Russian and East
ern European affairs, as well as an
accomplished pianist.

John L. Hennessy
Formerly chair of the Comput
er Science Department, John Hen
nessy replaced James Gibbons as
dean of the School of Engineering
last June. As dean of the nation's
top-ranked engineering school,
Hennessy will have to maintain
and build on that reputation in an
era of shrinking funds lor research.
A major priority for Hennessy
will be the full integration of com
puters and information technolo
gy into both research and teach
ing. Hennessy is well qualified to
do this, both as a teacher and as a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
In IW4 he founded a company
called MIPS Computer Systems,
based on a new method of com
puter architecture called reduced
instruction set computers, that he
and a colleague developed as
Stanford.

Richard Shavelson
As dean of the Sch(x>l of Edu
cation, Richard Shavelson has
been working hard to give his
school some continuity and to
move it smoothly into the future.
lie took over the position of
dean at his alma mater after the po
sition had been vacant for two
years. Just after taking the reins,
Shavelson began a school-wide
review and continues to examine
education training at Stanford.
Before returning to Stanford,
Shavelson taught at UCLA, UC-
Santa Barbara and the Rand Cor
poration, as well as filling visiting
professorships in Australia, Fin
land, Switzerland and Germany.

Burton Kichter
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Burton Richter
came to Stanford as a postdoctoral
fellow in 1956 and stuck around,
becoming a professor in 1967 and
director in 19H4.
The winner of the 1976 Nobel
Prize in physics, Richter directs the
administration of the accelerator, a
center dedicated to basic research in
elementary particle physics.
Richter specializes on experi
mental particle physics with high
energy electrons and has been a
member of advisory committees to
the Fermi National Accelerator
laboratory, the Max Planck Insti
tute and the U.S. Department of Ln
ergy, which awarded him the E.O.
Medal, among others.

Eugene A. Bauer
Entering his second year as
dean of the School of Medicine,
Bauer has had to come to grips
with shrinking budgets for Stan
ford Health Services and other
dramatic changes in the health
care industry.
Before being named dean,
Bauer was head of the Depart
ment of Dermatology for seven
years, focusing on strengthening
both the clinical and research as
pects of the department. Earlier,
he served on the faculty of Wash
ington University and completed
his residency and a research fel
lowship at the Barnes Hospital in
St. I.ouis.
He is involved with the Society
for Investigative Dermatology and
a general medicine study section
to review grant proposals to the
National Institutes of Health.

Charles H. Kruger
When Charles Kruger, a profes
sor of mechanical engineering, was
named dean of research and gradu
ate policy in 1992, he inherited the
complicated and touchy issues of
an indirect cost controversy and
graduate student dissatisfaction.
Since then, Stanford has settled
questions of its impropriety in re
porting indirect costs with the fed
eral government, and many gradu
ate issues, such as insufficient
housing, are being worked on.
A member of the Stanford fac
ulty for 35 years, Kruger hits also
chaired the Faculty Senate.

John It. Shoven
As dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, John
Shoven looks over the largest and
broadest school on the Stanford
campus.
Among the issues Shoven has
acted on in the past year are the
implementation of minors in hu
manities and science and the de
velopment of a new major in Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity — with concentrations in
Asian-American Studies, Chicano
Studies and African-American
Studies, as well as other areas. I le
also dealt with the closure of the
Food Research Institute.
Before moving into the dean's
position, Shoven was Charles R.
Schwab Professor of Economics
and served as chair of the Eco
nomics Department.

John Kaisian
The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved since
Kaisian took over as Hoover direc
tor in 19XK, replacing W (ilenn
Campbell, the institution's head
for 31 years.
The Hoover Stanford relation
ship hit a low point during the
mid-1980s when faculty success
fully stopped the Reagan Presi
dential Library from locating on
campus and supported a move
ment to bring the institution under
"normal academic governance."
Raisian has worked diligently
to improve relations since then
and seems to have been success
ful.

Gerhard Casper
Among Casper's many
achievments since taking the
helm of the University in 1992,
the president has undertaken an
overhaul of undergraduate educa
tion,creating new programs such
as Sophomore College and the
new freshman seminars, Stanford
Introductory Studies. He has suc
ceeded in these initiative even
during at time of tightening bud
gets and consolidation.
Before coming to Stanford,
Casper had served at the Universi
ty of Chicago since 1966, begin
ning as an associate professor of
political science and law and be
coming dean of Chicago's law
school and eventually provost of
the university.

Paul Brest
After 19 years as a Stanford
law professor, Paul Brest accepted
the position of dean of the Law
School in 1987. An expert in con
stitutional law and civil rights, he
has kept the Law School at the
forefront of law education in the
country.
He began his career with a
clerkship on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals and spent two years working
in Jackson, Miss., ta farther civil
rights for African Americans. Just
before coming to Stanford, Brest
spent a year as law clerk to U.S.
Supreme Court Justice John M.
Harlan.
He has held the Kenneth and
Harle Montgomery Chair in Pub
lic Interest Law and is now the
Richard E. Professor of law.

Franklin Orr
When Petroleum Engineering
Prof. Franklin "Lynn" Orr was
named permanent dean of the
School of Earth Sciences in April
1995, he knew his biggest task
would be dealing with the Uni
versity's ongoing budget cuts.
But his plans also included
improving what he called already
good programs in the earth sci
ences. He was active two years
ago in an extensive review of the
school and followed up on a
committee's recommendations.
Before coming to Stanford in
1985, Orr taught at the New Mex
ico Institute of Mining and Tech
nology, did research at the Shell
Development Company and acted
as assistant to the director of the
Office of Federal Activities of the
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

A. Michael Spence
He came to Stanford from its
eternal rival in all matters academ
ic, but former Dean of the Harvard
Faculty of Arts and Science
Spence has been successful in his
move to a focus on business.
Spence came into his dean's
position hoping to give the already
highly ranked Business School a
more firm "sense of direction."
Also the Philip H. Knight Pro
fessor of Economics and Manage
ment, Spence has been widely rec
ognized, winning the J.K. Gal
braith Prize for Excellence in
Teaching and the John Bates Clark
Medal from the American Eco
nomic Association, among others.

SO YOU RECOGNIZE Casper, and probably
Condi too. You might even know what jobs
they hold, but do you know what they actually
do?
Most likely, you don't, and you don't know much
about the rest of the people who run the University,
either.
President Casper is the leader of Stanford Univer
sity, but under his guidance, responsibilities are di

vided among many administrators, including the 12
who comprise the University Cabinet.
The 11 individuals who advise the president — the
provost, the academic deans, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center director and the Hoover Institu
tion director — each guide their respective Universi
ty divisions, reporting to the president and imple
menting his directives while also carrying out their
own initiatives.

Condoleezza Rice
As provost, Rice is Stanford's
chief budget and academic officer,
with jurisdiction over all areas of
the University.
Rice has spent much of her
four years as provost dealing
with budget cuts, formulating
and carrying out $18 million in
cuts from the University budget
over three years. While working
on the task, she has found time to
teach both during the year and at
Sophomore College.
Rice, a political science profes
sor, also serves as top aide on
President George Bush's National
Security Council. She is a recog
nized expert in Russian and East
ern European affairs, as well as an
accomplished pianist.

John L. Hennessy
Formerly chair of the Comput
er Science Department, John Hen
nessy replaced James Gibbons as
dean of the School of Engineering
last June. As dean of the nation's
top-ranked engineering school,
Hennessy will have to maintain
and build on that reputation in an
era of shrinking funds lor research.
A major priority for Hennessy
will be the full integration of com
puters and information technolo
gy into both research and teach
ing. Hennessy is well qualified to
do this, both as a teacher and as a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
In IW4 he founded a company
called MIPS Computer Systems,
based on a new method of com
puter architecture called reduced
instruction set computers, that he
and a colleague developed as
Stanford.

Richard Shavelson
As dean of the Sch(x>l of Edu
cation, Richard Shavelson has
been working hard to give his
school some continuity and to
move it smoothly into the future.
lie took over the position of
dean at his alma mater after the po
sition had been vacant for two
years. Just after taking the reins,
Shavelson began a school-wide
review and continues to examine
education training at Stanford.
Before returning to Stanford,
Shavelson taught at UCLA, UC-
Santa Barbara and the Rand Cor
poration, as well as filling visiting
professorships in Australia, Fin
land, Switzerland and Germany.

Burton Kichter
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Burton Richter
came to Stanford as a postdoctoral
fellow in 1956 and stuck around,
becoming a professor in 1967 and
director in 19H4.
The winner of the 1976 Nobel
Prize in physics, Richter directs the
administration of the accelerator, a
center dedicated to basic research in
elementary particle physics.
Richter specializes on experi
mental particle physics with high
energy electrons and has been a
member of advisory committees to
the Fermi National Accelerator
laboratory, the Max Planck Insti
tute and the U.S. Department of Ln
ergy, which awarded him the E.O.
Medal, among others.

Eugene A. Bauer
Entering his second year as
dean of the School of Medicine,
Bauer has had to come to grips
with shrinking budgets for Stan
ford Health Services and other
dramatic changes in the health
care industry.
Before being named dean,
Bauer was head of the Depart
ment of Dermatology for seven
years, focusing on strengthening
both the clinical and research as
pects of the department. Earlier,
he served on the faculty of Wash
ington University and completed
his residency and a research fel
lowship at the Barnes Hospital in
St. I.ouis.
He is involved with the Society
for Investigative Dermatology and
a general medicine study section
to review grant proposals to the
National Institutes of Health.

Charles H. Kruger
When Charles Kruger, a profes
sor of mechanical engineering, was
named dean of research and gradu
ate policy in 1992, he inherited the
complicated and touchy issues of
an indirect cost controversy and
graduate student dissatisfaction.
Since then, Stanford has settled
questions of its impropriety in re
porting indirect costs with the fed
eral government, and many gradu
ate issues, such as insufficient
housing, are being worked on.
A member of the Stanford fac
ulty for 35 years, Kruger hits also
chaired the Faculty Senate.

John It. Shoven
As dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, John
Shoven looks over the largest and
broadest school on the Stanford
campus.
Among the issues Shoven has
acted on in the past year are the
implementation of minors in hu
manities and science and the de
velopment of a new major in Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity — with concentrations in
Asian-American Studies, Chicano
Studies and African-American
Studies, as well as other areas. I le
also dealt with the closure of the
Food Research Institute.
Before moving into the dean's
position, Shoven was Charles R.
Schwab Professor of Economics
and served as chair of the Eco
nomics Department.

John Kaisian
The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved since
Kaisian took over as Hoover direc
tor in 19XK, replacing W (ilenn
Campbell, the institution's head
for 31 years.
The Hoover Stanford relation
ship hit a low point during the
mid-1980s when faculty success
fully stopped the Reagan Presi
dential Library from locating on
campus and supported a move
ment to bring the institution under
"normal academic governance."
Raisian has worked diligently
to improve relations since then
and seems to have been success
ful.
