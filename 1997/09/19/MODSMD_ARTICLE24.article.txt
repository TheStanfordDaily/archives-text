As another year on the Farm be
gins, returning students and faculty
will undoubtedly notice the facelnt
that the campus received during the
summer.
There were about 20 major con
struction project and nearly two
dozen parking and repaving projects
across campus.
The result of this "summer-to
end-all-summers", as Bob Hockey,
infrastructure and planning manager
for Facilities Operations put it, is a
revamped campus and a safer envi
ronment for students.
Some of the more noticeable
changes around the campus are the
repaving of central campus, espe
cially around the White Plaza, the
changes to Serra Mall, the addition
of a disability access ramp to Memo
rial Auditorium, the renovations to
Fire Truck House and new bike racks
around Meyer and Green libraries.
The flurry of campus improve
ment projects this summer has sever
al causes. Facilities Project Manage
ment, which is in charge of the con
struction projects around campus, is
nearing the end of its biggest five
year building project, Hockey said.
Additionally, according to Hock
ey, a fund made up of unused con
struction monies from previous years
designated money to repave surfaces
around campus this summer.
Besides White Plaza, most of the
major parking lots, including the
Wilbur Hall, Maples Pavilion, Serra
Street, Roble and Cowell Cluster lots
were repaved this summer, along
with major streets such as Santa
Teresa Street, Bowdoin Street, and
Welch Road.
Coinciding with the repaving
project in central campus is an effort
to replace bike racks. New racks

have been installed around Meyer
Library, the Career Planning and
Placement Center and some build
ings behind the Main Quad.
This is part of a $200,(XX) project
to replace all the old bike racks
around the middle of campus. The
new racks will be installed at sever
al-month intervals, with the next
batch of bike racks due in late Sep
tember, said Campus Bike Coordi
nator John Ciccarelli.
As a result of the bike rack re
placement, a number of bikes left on
racks in central campus were im
pounded over the summer. According
to Ciccarelli, notices were given to
managers of the buildings near the
racks via e-mail, and signs were post
ed by the racks warning bike owners
of the change several days ahead of
time.
The racks were also taped off
with yellow warning tape for several
days. The impounded bikes are now
stored at the Stanford police station,
where they will remain for several
more months for pick-up by owners,
Ciccarelli said.
Memorial Auditorium also un
derwent significant modifications
this summer. The section of Serra
Street in front of the auditorium has
been repaved and the sidewalks ex
tended. This is part of a general plan
to close all of Serra Mall to motor
traffic.
Additionally, on-street parallel
parking was installed along Santa
Teresa Street, Bowdoin Street, Elec
tioneer Road and Welch Road to
compensate for decreases in parking
lot space and also to improve traffic
safety.
According to Hockey, the amount
of building reconstruction and
repaving done this summer was triple
the amount in previous summers.
The total cost for the summer pro
jects was approximately $2 million.
