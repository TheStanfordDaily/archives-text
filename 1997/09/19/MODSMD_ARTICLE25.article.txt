# 'Sex' is out
## Popular orientation program revamped 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
There is no more "Sex in the 905," at least not at Stan
ford.
In place of the popular orientation program, the
Health Promotion Services Unit of Cowcll Student
Health Center has created two programs called "The
Real World" and "Up2U@Stanford" to better acquaint
freshmen with the pressures of college life.
"The Real World" focuses on a range of topics from
sexual assault to body image problems, and "Up2U"
specifically addresses alcohol abuse.
The Real World
"Sex in the 90s" had been needing a facelift for a few
years, explained Carol Pertofsky, the director of the
Health Promotion Unit.
She explained that freshmen have been entering
Stanford more informed about health issues and need
ed a program that would not repeat what they already
knew.
The title was selected by Sally Baird, the coordina
tor of the Campus Sexual Assault Prevention Program
and her staff after a contest to find a new name was an
nounced in May.
It beat out another popular choice, "Hoo Tow meets
Lake Lag," Baird said.

Once the title was decided, project planners began
to refine the program, which had been a series of vi
gnettes about sexual health followed by a monologue.
They reviewed survey responses from more than I,(XK)
students.
Many students felt that the program was "too much
like an infomercial for all the programs at Cowell,"
Pertofsky explained. "It felt stilted," she said and
added that this year's program has tried to be more en
gaging.
"The Real World" keeps some of the best vignettes
from the older script, but also includes an integrated
video, similar to that used in last year's Big Game Gai
eties.
The on-campus resources are mentioned briefly
during the performance and explained further in the
colorful new "Wellness Zine" that will be distributed
to all freshmen. This replaces the slip of paper that
used to list resources.
The goal of the program, Pertofsky said, is for the
students to become better informed about how to cre
ate healthy, safe relationships in which people can
have fun and be true to their own values.
She noted last week's sexual assault in Casa Zap
ata, last year's attempted rape on campus and the
binge drinking death of a freshman at Louisiana State
University as real-life examples of why programs
such as this are necessary.
"We just want the freshmen to fully enjoy their

Stanford experience," she said. "We just want them
to love life."
"The Real World" will take place this Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium and will be followed by small
group discussions led by Resident Assistants.
The program, Pertofsky said, will feature more
explicit material as well as some suiprise video
footage about sexual issues.
Up2u@Stanford
"Up2U" is a new program that specifically targets al
cohol abuse. It started as a final project in a class taught
by Elise Lenox, director of Cowell's Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention Program.
During fall quarter last year, a team of undergraduates
submitted a videotape of different students' attitudes to
ward alcohol on campus.
Lenox was impressed by their work, and she showed
the footage to the then-Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds' task forces on Alcohol Policy and on
Party Planning, which agreed to fund the new program.
I be video consists of a fifteen-minute series of inter
views with Stanford students speaking about their expe
riences with alcohol.
Jason Engelman, a sophomore who helped develop
the initial video and also served as "Up2U'"s summer
project co-ordinator, said the video tried to "get a per-
spcctive and not to have an administrator
waving his finger at you."
"A lot of students come into Stanford
and find that it's not the 'Animal House'
drinking mentality," Lenox said.
"Ideas from high school, movies and
pop culture about what drinking in col
lege is like are not necessarily realistic
nor are they compatible with academic
success."
She added that sometimes students
don't realize this "until they get their fall
grades."
lhe video, she hopes, will challenge
those norms by offering perspectives
from real Stanford students.
"Up2U" assumes that students will
make responsible decisions if they are
informed of repercussions.
Ljenox cited a statistic that three
quarters of Stanford students are respon
sible about drug and alcohol use.
Through interviews with students
and police officers, the program informs
its audience of the laws governing drink
ing at Stanford.
"Our program is about making
choices," she explained. "With freedom
comes responsibility. The RAs are not
patty police."
