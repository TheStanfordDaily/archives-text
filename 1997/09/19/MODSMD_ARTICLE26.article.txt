Stanford's current "class shopping"
system may soon yield to course pre-reg
istration, in the hope of making the first
weeks of a quarter more manageable for
instructors and students.
"But don't hold your breath," said
University Registrar Roger Printup. "A
course pre-registration system is unlikely
to be put in place before the year 21XX)."
The issue of course pre-registration is
part of the ongoing assessment of the
Network for Student Information, the
current data system used by the Regis
trar's, Admission and Financial Aids and
Bursar's offices.
The assessment of the NSI was

prompted by University faculty and
staffs desire to explore pre-registration
and degree-audit options, Printup said.
Degree auditing would allow stu
dents to examine potential scenarios on
line while they plan the classes they will
need to take in order to satisfy the re
quirements of their proposed program of
study.
These options simply cannot Ix: ad
ministered under the current computer
system, said Printup.
"The current system was implement
ed in the early 1980s and is still a main
frame," he added.
Adoption of the course pre-registra
tion system, however, docs not mean that
students would be unable to change their
minds after registering, said Printup.

"Stanford does a very good job of
trying to meet the desires of students to
take the classes they want to take. No
change in that philosophy is anticipated
with the potential implementation of
the pre-registration system," Printup
said.
The assessment of the NSI is spear
headed by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies and the Committee for Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement.
"The pre-registration system would
allow the faculty to learn the size and the
make-up of their classes in advance, al
lowing them to choose the right class
room, order the proper quantity of course
materials and engage the proper number
of teaching assistants," said Economics
Prof. John Taylor, chair of C-US.

"In short, the pre-registration system
has the potential to make the first few
weeks of the quarter go more smoothly,"
Taylor said.
The committees will begin their as
sessment of the issues by gathering infor
mation on "whether pre-registration can
lie done automatically enough to provide
timely information," said Taylor.
"We want to make sure students have
the flexibility under the pre-registration
system to move to another course," he
added.
In addition, focus groups involving
students, faculty and staff will be con
ducted throughout the year, said Printup.
According to Taylor, the committees
plan to offer their recommendations by
the end of this academic year.
