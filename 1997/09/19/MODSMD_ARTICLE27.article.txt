Dekes lose their house for one year
As the result of a May 25 incident in which an intoxicated Delta Kappa Epsilon
pledge was taken to hospital, Dean of Students Marc Wais decided to evict the
Dekes from their house.
Wais said that "if the fraternity complies with all the University's sanctions,
they have a written guarantee of reclaiming their house at 592 Mayfield Avenue as
early as September 1998."
The house was returned to the jurisdiction of Housing Assignment Services and
filled with unassigned students from the autumn quarter waiting list.
Again, Stanford tops in NCAA
Stanford reasserted its dominance in collegiate athletics by taking its third con
secutive Sears Directors Cup, the trophy awarded annually to the nation's best all

While taking a record-setting six national championships and placing 19 teams

its closest competitor, North Carolina, by more than 200 points.
In its fourth year, the NCAA's Sears Cup is the only all-sport athletic award in
the nation.
Knight will play for Cleveland
Brevin Knight, Stanford's career leader in assists and steals, was taken in the
16th overall pick in the NBA draft on June 25. The Cleveland Cavaliers used the
second of their first-round picks to nab the 1997 graduate.

Knight, the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award winner in 1997 as the nation's
best player under 6 feet, became the first Stanford player in five years to be drafted
by the NBA, following Adam Keefe, Gass of '92.
Knight was the first player this year from a Pacific 10 Conference school to be
selected, beating out Pac-10 player of the year Ed Gray, a swingman from UC-
Berkeley.
New dean of admissions takes over
Robert Kinnally, previously dean of admissions at Sarah Lawrence College in
New York, was named Stanford's dean of undergraduate admissions and financial
aid. Former Dean James Montoya became the vice provost for student affairs in late
June.
Kinnally, who holds degrees from Manhattan College and New York Universi
ty, first applied to Stanford almost 20 years ago. Accepted to the Farm's doctoral
program in English, the new dean instead went to NYU because Stanford did not
offer enough financial aid.
The widely popular "Dean Bob," as he was known at Sarah Lawrence, left be
hind a reputation for maintaining close relationships with students and faculty at the
small liberal arts college, whose entire population could be housed in Wilbur Hall.
Sand Hill Project to face voters
On June 28, the Palo Alto City Council approved an agreement with Stanford
on the University's proposed Sand Hill Road Project.
But before work can begin on the project, Palo Alto residents will vote Nov. 4

on Stanford's proposal and an alternative proposal developed by Mid-Peninsula
Action for Tomorrow, a citizen group.
Council members said they will acknowledge the public s opinion if the alter
native proposal is passed, but Stanford Director of Government and Community
Relations Larry Horton said the University will not accept MPACT s initiative.
Under the compromise finally agreed on by Stanford and the council, the Uni
versity would be permitted to build an apartment complex on Sand Hill Road. Stan
ford would also add 80,000 square feet to the Stanford Shopping Center, widen
Sand Hill Road to four lanes between Santa Cruz Avenue and Arboretum Road and
connect Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real.
Although still under development, the MPACT plan would greatly curt?il that
expansion.
Gupta wins tenure
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta won his long battle for tenure on Aug. 8
when the faculty Advisory Board voted to grani his appeal.
University Provost Condoleezza Rice had asked the board to make a ruling
when the case came before her last spring.

in the School of Humanities and Sciences.
Students and anthropology scholars nationwide rallied around the popular south
Asian specialist, urging the University to grant his appeal.
A second dean's committee denied that appeal in May, but after gathering ad
ditional information, the board took the unusual step of overturning that recom
mendation.
