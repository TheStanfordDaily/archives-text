# Justices preside at mock Borden trial
## Rehnquist, O'Connor hear 19th-century ax murder case, audience votes to acquit 
### Bimal Shah Editorial staff 
The I .aw Sch<x)l celebrated a new en
dowed professorship Tuesday evening
with a mock trial of the famous 19th-cen
tury Lizzie Borden case.
U.S. Supreme Court Justices William
Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor,
IxHh Stanford alumni, were on hand to
serve as the judges for the dramatization.
With I .aw Sch<x)l faculty and stu
dents performing the roles of witnesses
and attorneys, the dramatization com
bined realism and humor.
Rehnquist and O'Connor several
times interrupted the dueling attorneys
with questions, as the justices are accus
tomed to do during regular Supreme
Court hearings.
One of the lighter moments was when
the court was called to session with the
traditional "all rise," and the entire audi
ence in Dinkelspiel Auditorium rose to
its feet.
Lizzie Borden, a young New England
woman, was accused of the ax murders
of her father and stepmother in their Fall
River, Mass. home on the morning of
Aug. 4, 1892.
Borden's jury — composed entirely
of men—acquitted her, finding it hard to
accept that an otherwise respectable lady
could have committed such an awful
crime.
Yet the circumstantial evidence and
the absence of any other suspects in the
case convicted Borden in the public
mind. She lived a social outcast the rest of
her life.
The Lizzie Borden case was"the OJ
Simpson of the last century," both in
terms of the nature of the crime and the
publicity, according to Development
Services Manager Derek Rosenfield,
who helped organize the event.
While Simpson's attorneys played the
race card, Borden's actual counsel fo
cused on the gender of the accused. In

Tuesday's performance, Borden's de
fense attorney, played by Law Prof. Bar
bara Babcock, intentionally took the gen
der defense to a new and funnier level.
She told the audience that the killings
were the act of a madman, and thai Bor
den is neither mad nor a man, provoking
much laughter from the audience.
The prosecutor, played by I larvard
Law Prof, and Stanford Board of
Trustees member Charles Ogletree, at
tempted to shift the focus back to the facts
of the case.
Babcock's closing drew the most
laughter and applause of the evening.
The highlight was a short rhyme: "Willi
out an ax or a dress, I iz/ie's not a mur
deress. Rather than the criminal type,
she's just the victim of media hype. So
put aside the ugly rhyme that links her
name with brutal crime and give us with
out a doubt or worry an honest verdict
from an American jury."

Gerald Uelman, a member of the ().J.
Simpson defense team and a former vis
iting professor at the I .aw School, penned
the rhyme for the event. Uelman was
also responsible for the famous line, re
ferring to a glove that was a key prosecu
tion exhibit in the O.J. Simpson case, de
livered by lead Simpson attorney Johnnie
Cochran, "II it don't fit, you must ac
quit."
After the closing arguments, the jus
tices gave the audience-jury its instruc
tions.
As the crowd was deliberating, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper, rose
from the front of the audience to assure
everyone that the ax used in the murder
was not the Stanford Axe of Big Game
fame. "We almost never let go of it,"he
said, adding "Beat ("al" as he sat down to
much applause.
Ibe audience, which included the
packed house al Dinkelspiel Auditorium

as well as a full crowd in Kresge Audito
rium who watched by a live feed, voted to
acquit.
The event marked the establishment
of the Judge John Crown Professorship
and the installment of Babcock as the in
augural chairholder.
('r< >wn, who died this year, obtained a
bachelor's degree from Stanford in 1951
and served for 22 years as a trial court
judge in C hicago. He also gave his name
to the ('rown Ouadrangle and the Robert
('rown I ibrary at the I .aw School.
Babcock said she is very happy to
have her name linked professionally to a
man whom she respected enormously. In
many ways, the trial court is the most
challenging level of the American judi
cial system, Babcock said.
As for the mock trial celebration,
Babcock said, "It took me back to the old
days when 1 was a criminal defense attor
ney."
