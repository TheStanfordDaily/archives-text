# New concentrations, faculty in program
## Changing Hum Bio 
### Jason Engleman 
New opportunities await students
in the Program in Human Biology,
Stanford's second largest undergradu
ate major. Two highly regarded visit
ing scholars will teach new courses
and three new areas of concentration
will be offered to majors.
Nobel Laureate Baruch Blumber
will be a visiting scholar and, along
with Lecturer William Hurlbut, will
teach Human Biology 158: "Epi
demics, Evolution and Ethics" fall
quarter.
Also joining the program's faculty
is Philip Lee, a former assistant secre
tary for health in the U.S. Department
of I lealth and Human Services and the
former chancellor of the UC-San Fran
cisco Medical Center. I le will co-teach
a course on health policy.
After completing core courses,
Human Biology majors will have
three new options when choosing an
area of concentration — Health Poli
cy, Health and Human Performance
and Environmental Policy
I lealth Policy is headed by Human
Biology Lecturer Donald Barr. He is a
practicing physician with a doctorate in
sociology and a research focus on or
ganizations and medical care quality.
Students who ch<x>se Health Poli
cy as their area of concentration will be
able to select courses from the depart
ments of Economics, Sociology and
Anthropology as well as the Program
in Public Policy.
'Ihe second new concentration,
Health and Human Performance, will
be headed by Lecturer Gail Butterfield
and Assoc. Medicine Prof. Gordon
Matheson.
Butterfield, a registered dietitian,
also teaches Human Biology 120:

"Human Nutrition." Also, she is cur
rently doing extensive research on el
derly and young women at the Veter
ans Administration Hospital in Palo
Alto.
Matheson, meanwhile, researches
athletic injury at the School of Medi
cine. Recently, he has taught Human
Biology 159: "Sports Medicine,"
treated Stanford athletes, started the
Sports Medicine division at the Med
ical School and is working on opening
a new sports medicine clinic.
The Health and Human Perfor
mance concentration will offer cours
es, internships and research opportuni
ties in nutrition and spoils medicine.
Ihe third new concentration, Envi
ronmental Policy, will be coordinated
by Arm in Rosencranz. He earned a
law degree and a doctorate in political
science from Stanford and is the
founder and former president of Pacif
ic Environment and Resources Center,
an environmental organization dedi
cated to protecting global forests and
wildlife. He has also written widely on
international and comparative envi
ronmental policy.
While the Environmental Policy
concentration will contain some tech
nical science, it will focus on the social
sciences.
According to Rosencranz, while
the Program in Earth Systems comes
close, there is really "no program at
Stanford that focuses on environmen
tal studies."
Ihe concentration will consist of
courses in environment and free trade,
environment and human rights, global
forests, wildlife protection and envi
ronmental justice. Within the concen
tration students will be able to focus on
either international or U.S. environ
mental policy.
