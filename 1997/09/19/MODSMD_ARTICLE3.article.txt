## Washington press, Secret Service take over the Farm

"I"his year's typical confusion and disarray accompanying
the arrival of Stanford's 1,650 new students will he intensified
by the presence of the President of the United States, the Secret
Service and hundreds of journalists.
Security will he bolstered today as President Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton drop off their daughter
Chelsea, who will enter the Class of 20()1.
I lowever, Stanford officials have worked with the Secret
Service all summer to diminish the effects of President Clin
ton 's first visit to the Stanford campus on the throngs of students
and parents who also will be lofting beds, unpacking suitcases
and walking to campus events.
"We're doing everything to minimize disruption to the flow
of traffic and activity taking place," said Heather Dunn, the di

rector of New Student Orientation.
Roads and freeways will remain open, except during the
motorcade carrying the first family from an area hotel to
Chelsea's dormitory.
President and Mrs. Clinton plan to attend Orientation activ
ities for parents, including a lunch with Provost Condoleezza
Rice and a dinner with University President Gerhard Casper.
Wilbur Field, the site for both meals, was fenced off from
public view on Wednesday.
The largest security action will take place in the Main Ouad,
where the Clintons will attend the University's Convocation,
highlighted by a speech former Casper. Personnel working in
the buildings lining the Inner Ouad must leave at noon to allow
for a security sweep of the area prior to the 3:30 p.m. ceremo
ny.
Citing security concerns and an ex
ceptionally large class of new students,
University officials will only allow those
with special name tags and tickets en
trance to Casper's speech. In prior years,
anyone on campus could attend.
"We'd like to create a more public
event," Dunn said. "Given the space, the
seating is limited. We first want to ac
commodate parents and students."
Hie media, which began swarming
campus as early as Monday, will tie
given scant access to the first family.
Thirteen members of the White Mouse
press corps arrived with the Clintons
aboard Air Force One at Moffett Field
last night. Hut the intense Beltway media
interest also required a separate overflow

plane to accompany the President's air
craft.
"The Washington press corps has
been so good about protecting [Chelsea
Clinton's] privacy, but we'll see," said
Marsha Berry, Hillary Clinton's press
secretary, who has been working with
University communications officials
since Tuesday to prepare for the presi
dential visit.
Reporters scoured campus yester
day, interviewing students, UPS work
ers and anyone who would speak to
them, sometimes even filling stories
with inaccurate information. American
Journal, a syndicated television news
magazine, reported that many of Stan
ford's sororities plan to rush Chelsea
Clinton in the coming weeks. In reality,
Stanford's Sorority Rush does not occur
until April.
During President Clinton's years in

office, the White House has protected
Chelsea's privacy, and the White House
press corps has obliged.
"She probably has had more privacy
than any child I've ever known in the
White House," said Helen Thomas,
White House correspondent tor United
Press International and the dean of the
press corps. "It is in many ways unjour
nalistic."
I "horn as, who has covered eight dif
ferent presidents, said even today's press
access is somewhat of an anomaly, tx--
cause the White House has rarely al
lowed ('he 1 sea to be the focus of a media
event.
I"he expected 250 journalists will Ik*
located in 112 ord Center, which has been
turned into a press filing center. Between
10 a.m. and noon, Stanford officials and
students will brief the press on different
aspects of University life, from under

graduate education to lihkl services.
Alter a lunch at noon, the media may
be given a photo opportunity of the Clin
tons at a yet unspecified part of campus,
allowing I uist ("oast networks the oppor
tunity to broadcast footage of the first
family on the evening news.
Additionally, media will be allowed
at Convocation with a view of the ('1 in
tons, Hoth CNN and MSNBC plan live
broadcasts of ('asper's address if the ca
pability exists.
AliC News said yesterday that il
would broadcast a portion ol the Convo
cation live on World News tonight for
its liast ( oast viewers il the photo oppor
tunity does not occur.
President Clinton, in an effort to keep
the focus on new students, will not Ik
making any speeches on campus, al
though he will speak at a San ( arlos ed
ucation roundtable tomorrow.
