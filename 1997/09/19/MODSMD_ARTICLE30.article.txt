# Hoover fellow decries recent police brutality, war on drugs
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
The recent alleged New York City
police torturing of a handcuffed Hait
ian immigrant in a police station bath
room was not an aberration, according
to a research fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
Rather, former San Jose Police
Chief Joseph McNamara argues that
the incident exemplifies the warlike
mentality prevalent in modern Ameri
can police departments.
This summer, McNamara discussed
his views on the New York incident on
the Today Show and BBC Radio and in
Time magazine, among other publica
tions.
An outspoken critic of current ap
proaches to law enforcement and of the
war on drugs, the Hoover fellow con
tributes regularly to newspapers, mag
azines and television shows.
McNamara's interest in police goes
further than speaking out about law en
forcement mentality: He has written
five books — three of them best-selling
detective novels — and is working on a
sixth.
Brutal mentality
What happened to Haitian immi
grant Abner Louima, who was alleged
ly sodomized and beaten by police, re
flects dangerous trends among some
police officers, according to McNama
ra.
"Unlike in Europe, police in Amer
ica have never been part of the military;
in our society, police should be peace
servants," McNamara contended. "If
you create a mentality of soldiers . ..
(he police will look for enemies."
However, he contended, police
chiefs, mayors and even President
Clinton are moving in just that direc

tion.
McNamara asserted that police who
have seen a lot of violence and hostili
ty have the tendency to get cynical and
begin to view certain people as the
enemy.
"The New York incident is not the
traditional case of police brutality —
it's an atrocity of an occupation army,"
he said. "Unfortunately, political lead
ers keep emphasizing to the police that
the only way to reduce crime is to start
a war against crime."
Ihis police philosophy stems from
the argument that tough enforcement
of minor crimes sends the hardened
criminal the message that he should
think twice before striking, said McNa
mara.
Sadly, he added, such policing in
evitably comes down hardest on poor
and minority citizens, reinforcing their
distrust of the police.
Instead, in his writings, McNamara
urges police departments to work
closely with the citizens they are paid
to serve.
McNamara's argument is backed
by his 15 years as police chief of San
Jose, where he began an innovative
program of community partnership.
"We entered into a partnership with
the people to work against [problemat
ic conditions], which allowed people to
take back their neighborhood," he told
Hie Daily in an interview two years
ago.
As a result of McNamara's reform,
San Jose recently has been recognized
as the safest city in America.
Now, McNamara is doing research
for a new book on police gangsterism.
While the overwhelming majority
of police are good men and women,
McNamara said, "there is a pattern of
police gangster crime on duty."
His research has revealed several

patterns: The victims are usually mi
norities, and the crimes are exposed by
someone outside the police depart
ment. Furthermore, the police code of
silence protects the guilty officers, and
the mayor and the police chiefs engage
in damage control.
Trends in gangsterism are not al
ways obvious except when looked at
on the national level, he said.
"Instead of looking for scapegoats,
I ask scholarly 'Why do these things
occur?' " he added.
McNamara hypothesizes that the
cause of police gangsterism is rooted in
the same warlike mentality that leads to
police brutality.
"Although crime is actually on the
decline, increased television coverage
of crime increases public fear and leads
to demand for more tough cops," he ar
gued.
A war worth waging?
One of the results of the warlike
mentality in law enforcement has been
a criminalization of drug use that
hasn't solved drug-related problems.
" The war on drugs has done more
harm than the drugs themselves" is the
message McNamara has been advanc
ing in national media for the past
decade.
McNamara propounded the same
argument as part of a panel of experts
speaking at Kicker Dining Mall last
year.
While efforts to reduce drug con
sumption in this country have failed,
the costs of fighting the war on drugs
have reached $40 billion, McNamara
said.
"The government cannot stop the
drugs from coming in," McNamara in
sisted. Instead, he added, the United
States shouid stop treating drug users
as criminals and focus its energy on

education and treatment.
Rather than wasting time pursuing
small-time drug users, police officers'
efforts would be better spent protect
ing innocent people on the street, Mc-
Namara wrote in a 1993 San Jose Mer
cury News article.
"We cannot stop the drug trade be
cause of its high profit margin: $5,()00
worth of drugs in foreign currency can
bring in $100,000 on American
streets," McNamara said. " I he war on
drugs simply creates criminal corrup

tion around the world."
McNamara pointed out that today's
illegal drugs achieved that status only
in 1914, as a result of lobbying by reli
gious groups. McNamara questioned
the validity of separating drugs into
legal and illegal categories.
"Alter all, alcohol causes people to
be belligerent, while no murder has
been committed by someone under the
effect of marijuana," he said.
McNamara argues it is time to re
examine the war on drugs. He is orga

nizing a November conference that
will bring together 100 mayors, police
chiefs and public health directors to
consider drug policies.
The conference is only a first step.
"We need a presidential commission
to look at the harm of the drug war vs.
the harm caused by drugs," said Mc-
Namara. "Throughout history, every
culture has used psycho-active sub
stances. [Our war on drugs) makes it
more difficult to get away from
drugs."
