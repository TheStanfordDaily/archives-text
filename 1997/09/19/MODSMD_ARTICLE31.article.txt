# Magazine ranks campus activism
## Stanford found to be the nation's fifth most active, Wisconsin first 
### Kumar Narayanan 
MotlfeYponei, a liberal y]
investigative journalism, ranked Stan
ford the fifth most activist campus in the
country in its latest issue.
The magazine, based in San Francis
co, has been ranking activist campuses
for four years. This year's list was led by
the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
followed by Mount llolyoke, the IJni
vcisity of Massachusetts-Amherst and
the University of Minnesota-Morris.
I he methodology, according to
Mother Jones Communications Direc
tor Richard Reynolds, was to survey
more than 20 activist organizations
icrov. thi country, including Amnesty
International and I labitat tor I lumanity.
According to Reynolds, the magazine
asked, "What have you noticed? What
schools came up the most?"
However, the issues that Mother
Jones recognized at Stanford were not
those that raged on campus in the last
year, several prominent activists said.
The tanking noted protests against
I'aco Bell, which occurred two years
ago, and this year's rating of disability
access to campus buildings by a student
group.
Issues such as the boycott of U.S.

News & World Report's annual college
rankings, rallies in favor of tenure for

Senior Kelly Naylor, who has been
involved in many campus issues, com
mented that activism is "difficult to
quantify, but I admire (Mother Jones']
effort to recognize it."
Senior Salomon Varela, co-chair of
MEC'IiA, a Chicano / Latino student
group, said the survey shows that "stu
dents were not as apathetic as people
thought."

Across the nation, students are focusing
"on the Third World and abroad — is
sues that aren't necessarily right on
campus," according to Reynolds.
In addition, he said he sees the Inter
net as "a highly effective tool," as many
activist groups use technology to bring
together groups across the nation. Hie
Stanford led Forget U.S. News Coali
tion. along with many other groups, has
nationwide e-mail lists and World Wide
Web pages.
Activism at Stanford dates back to

Vietnam anti-war protests, when stu
dents claimed their voice. It "provides
with opportunities to partici-j
pate in the democratic process and to ef
fect change," Dean of Students Marc
Wais said.
The immediate future of campus ac
tivism is taking shape as students return
for the year. While there is no promi
nent issue such as Prop. 209 to rally
around, students are organizing a myri
ad of other projects.
Naylor said she is working on creat
ing a public service minor and expand
ing service learning programs. She also
is crafting a series of dialogues on ac
tivism and its role in the Stanford com
munity.
Varela said MEChA will work toed
ucate students about issues surrounding
migrant workers and grape picking and
"just try to keep people aware of the is
sues and let them get involved."
However, "it's hard to tell what is
sues students will get involved in,"says
junior Cathy Rion, a leader at the
Women's Center.
Activism also has a unique link at
Stanford to the classroom. "Sometimes
|activism) can be a direct application or
response to what students have dis
cussed in the classroom," Wais said.
