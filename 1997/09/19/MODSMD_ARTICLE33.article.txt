# THE 						SECRET DIARIES OF AIMEE THANATOGENOS!
## 'My life as junk mail!' 
### 
Moi, Aimee Thanatogenos, had just
returned from a fabulous summer
spent at a cruise yacht, sipping tequi
las and frolicking with handsome silver fish,
when I had to face reality. I was hack on cam
pus, and this time I wasn't here as just anoth
er pretty blonde with a penchant for alco
holism and a minor in linguistics. This time I
had a job. An occupation. A mission. A new job
as an HA.
Yep. A Resident Assistant. A crusader for
the values of Residential Education. A mem
ber of that brigade of hundreds of clear-eyed,
hard-working and enthusiastic men and
women hired to bring some cheer into the lives
of freshmen recently separated from their par
ents, lovers and nutritious food. At first Aimee
didn't feel like she was up for the job, but after
a few shots, everything seemed within reach. 1
mean, it's a tough job, but it sure beats licking
steel poles at sleazy clubs, and it's more fulfill
ing than performing brain surgery on a really
dumb person.
Aimee barely survived RA training, which
is an intense 2-week period not unlike boot
camp or a really good dieting program. Aimee
lost 20 pounds, most of which was regained
after a quick trip to the local Burger King.
Training is tough, and in my "suggestions for
improvement" comment list, I wrote that

maybe instead of all those peer counseling
technique sessions and sex ed presentations,
Residential Education might consider showing
"A Clockwork Orange" in slow motion, or
home videos of Al Gore vacationing in the
Bahamas.
Aimee to her credit did attend all her
workshops, hard-working girl that I am. But I
thought they were like theme parties, and so
for the panel on alcohol policy 1 came com
pletely smashed, and for the one on sexual
harassment 1 dressed like Pamela Lee Ander
son and sat on the lap of a random Row HA.
They escorted me out of the building, and left
me on the gutter, which is line, because I made
friends with several passing squirrels and
waved hello at a policeman who threw a crumb
of bread at me.
But whatever sacrifices Aimee had to
make in the name of Residential Education,
they all seem well worth it. Aimee is very
excited to meet her new residents and is eager
to share stories, poems, needles and cookie
recipes with them. Last weekend she and her
staff* went on a retreat where we got to talk
about our incoming frosh, and we decided on a
lot of fun things to do. I don't remember exact
ly what those things were, but one of them had
to do with going to the City, which is great
because I need a new prescription from my

shrink.
Some people may think that Aimee is
mentally incapacitated to be an RA, which is a
lie, and I know that because I have this paper
which I carry in my pocket that says that it's a
lie. Actually, now that I think about it, it's
actually a restraining order that I carry in my
pocket, but oh well. I'm not supposed to go
into Donner at any time at the risk of getting
frisked and forced to lick the legs of their din
ing room chairs.
Aimee is very excited about being an RA.
And anyone who disputes that is a big, fat liar.
Either that, or he's my therapist. Aimee would
go on talking, but she's exhausted and needs
to catch some Zz's to keep up with those wild
'n crazy frosh. As you read this last sentence,
imagine a huge black hole emerging in front of
you and sucking you into it. Oh good.

RA AIMEE THANATOGENOS (top)
indulges in quiet time alone in the mornings,
but in the evenings she likes to perform
impromptu Chopin with her residents Mikal,
Christian, Scott, Andrew, David, Yar and
Michael.
