# TASTELESS TABLOID TRASH OF THE WEEK
## CONSPIRACY THEORY! 
### 
My, oh my! This summer has witnessed the pass
ing away of not one, not two, but three famous
celebrities: Lady Diana, Mother Teresa and
designer Gianni Versace. Faster than Newsweek
can stop the presses and plaster one deceased's
photos on its front cover, it looks like another
celeb is hitting the bucket. Coincidence?
Armageddon? We think not. Were the deaths
unrelated? We think not. Is your boyfriend
cheating on you with your sister? We think so.

Diversions dug deep to find out what these
three celebs had in common and has come
across some shocking evidence. It wouldn't be
too farfetched to say that there may be some
weird conspiracy going on and that the end of
the world is coming and all that money you
invested in long-term mutual funds was for
naught. You may think the three deaths were
unrelated, but then again...
