## Farm living rich with rites A
						lesson in Stanford tradition 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, you got in, you picked
out some semi-attractive yet reasonably
priced bedding, and you're getting the
hang of Stanford. Congratulations, you
made it. But now is not the time to rest on
your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on
campus, it's imperative that you make
the most of a few fundamental traditions
— which will soon become second-na
ture, like clapping too fast and jumping
at just the right time when the Band plays
"All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon get one
tradition under your bell by way of the
Orientation square dance. Yes, it's
cheesy. Yes, you'll look like a redneck.
But get out there and do-si-do your tiny
little heart out — it will be one of those

Hallmark memories of years to come,
unforgettable if only for the fact that you
actually put aside your embarrassment
and kept your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on the
Quad, your one chance for guilt-free
tongue jousting with a total stranger:
You submit because you're supposed to.
In order to become a Stanford man or
woman, according to legend, a freshman
must kiss a senior in the Quad under the
light of the full moon. It's a little sleazier
and not quite as poetic as it sounds, but
be a good sport. Hopefully the moon
won't provide enough light for anyone
to recognize you later and incriminate
you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be seen
at Stanford's one regular weekly social
