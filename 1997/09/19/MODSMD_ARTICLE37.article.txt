## Farm living rich with rites A 						lesson in Stanford tradition 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, you got in, you picked
out some semi-attractive yet reasonably
priced bedding, and you're getting the
hang of Stanford. Congratulations, you
made it. But now is not the time to rest on
your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on
campus, it's imperative that you make
the most of a few fundamental traditions
— which will soon become second-na
ture, like clapping too fast and jumping
at just the right time when the Band plays
"All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon get one
tradition under your bell by way of the
Orientation square dance. Yes, it's
cheesy. Yes, you'll look like a redneck.
But get out there and do-si-do your tiny
little heart out — it will be one of those

Hallmark memories of years to come,
unforgettable if only for the fact that you
actually put aside your embarrassment
and kept your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on the
Quad, your one chance for guilt-free
tongue jousting with a total stranger:
You submit because you're supposed to.
In order to become a Stanford man or
woman, according to legend, a freshman
must kiss a senior in the Quad under the
light of the full moon. It's a little sleazier
and not quite as poetic as it sounds, but
be a good sport. Hopefully the moon
won't provide enough light for anyone
to recognize you later and incriminate
you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be seen
at Stanford's one regular weekly social

outing, Flicks. These almost-up-to-date
movie offerings staged in Memorial Au
ditorium are a great opportunity to
check out male pattern baldness trends
among those in the orchestra seats, as
well as your one shot to nail that prep
school kid in your CIV class during the
pre-show paper fight. Word has it that to
achieve the nirvana of true senior status
one must successfully float a paper air
plane from the balcony and hit the
movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a less
wholesome, frenzied rite as the student
body heads on down to the resting place
of our beloved founders, Mom, Dad and
little Leland, and dances on their graves.
A little morbid and ungrateful, perhaps,
but the Mausoleum provides a perfectly
eerie backdrop for the wickedness of the
holiday.
Once November rolls around, all the
cosmic energy on campus focuses on
one deliciously malicious goal: to beat
Cal. Out comes the name calling (they're
a bunch of Weenies), the Axe -wielding
and the most high-schoolesque display
of Stanford spirit you will get out of a
group of semi-apathetic smart people.
Two years ago, Stanford reclaimed
the Axe — a hallowed article awarded to

the winner of each Big Game — for the
first time since 1993.
Big Game week includes many can't
miss-or-you 're-lame events such as Gai
eties, a student-written comedy revue
that takes the opportunity to playfully go
for the Cal jugular — as well as to send
more visible Stanford icons up in flames
— in a joking, pseudo-plot filled musi
cal. Hey, and when they say "Branner
sucks," they're only teasing. Don't take
it personally.
You also leam the Axe Cheer (high
lighted by such tricky and complex lines
as "Give 'em the Axe" and "Right in the
neck.") Although Big Game week has
never been the same without the tower
ing Bonfire (canceled four years ago be
cause of the tiger salamander population
in the Lake Lagunita bed), plans are al
ways in the works to find a "healthy" al
ternative.
Big Game itself is the one time you
can do the "We Got In" cheer without
feeling like your ego's the size of Mon
tana. The Cal band dodges frozen or
anges thrown from the stands and the
Axe Committee prepares to take back
their baby. And that electrical night, no
matter what the score, the campus erupts
in snoozing, boredom-ridden silence as
the all-day tailgates take a toll and cam
pus turns lame, lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a turn for
the worse as everybody and anybody

tries to reverse the dateless trend that has
crushed the campus under its weight. As
fun as the whole blind date concept is in
theory, in reality it proves even more
painful as dormitories throw Screw Your
Roommate parties. Although you may
not meet your potential soul mate, it is a
good way to get back at your roommate
for their snooze button addiction.
More twisted, but no less sexually
frustrated is Exotic Erotic in the spring.
Trying to pretend they haven't gotten out
of shape yet, students flock together in
scantily clad, shameless public ecstasy.
This is the one time all year people get to
press their naked flesh against the naked
flesh of others, reveling in semi-lust and
ogling the disappointingly small socked
penises and see-through bras of their
dormmates.
And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frustration,
that usually lasts for two weeks each
quarter during Dead and Finals Weeks,
another tradition rears its ugly head. At
midnight, every night of Dead Week,
students cough their tonsils out in the
Primal Scream, yelling out CIV reading
frustrations and writer's-block woes.
These are just a few of the traditions
which give Stanford a kicked-back yet
amusingly off-beat atmosphere. No one
takes them very seriously now, but you'll
miss them all too soon when you under
go that last tradition — graduation.
