# Party guide reflects new alcohol policy
## 
### Tracy Jan Hussein kanji Editorial staff 
Students arriving on campus this
week will find that Stanford offers near
ly limitless opportunities — including
the chance to get drunk.
While the University prohibits the il
legal use, possession and distribution of
alcohol on campus, it has traditionally
shied away from strong enforcement of
this policy.
But last fall s controversy over Uni
versity efforts to tighten control over al
cohol consumption on campus resulted
in the formation of an alcohol task force
composed of students, faculty and ad
ministrators. Its recommendations have
not been finalized.
"In my mind, the policy really hasn't
changed much," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais. "We emphasize the educa
tional aspect along with the clear notice
that Stanford is not the sanctuary from
the law."
The policy states, "The University,
as an educational institution, approach
es student conduct issues from a per
spective that places emphasis on indi
vidual responsibility and development.
Education about and prevention of alco
hol and other drug-related problems will

continue to be the primary emphasis and
goal."
The only major change since last
year was made in the University party
planning guidelines; student groups are
no longer required to inform the Office
of Student Activities before hosting a
party. However, prior notification is
strongly recommended to ensure public
safety, depending on the scale of the
party.
This change occurred in direct re
sponse to the frustration caused by po
lice presence at a few high profile par
ties last fall, perceived by students as a
crackdown on underage drinking. The
new party-planning guidelines are also a
result of the Alcohol and Greek Life
task forces.
"Although the old requirement of
notification was well-intentioned, I
think people perceived it as Stanford po
lice being more intrusive than in past
years," Wais said. "My understanding is
that there was not a significant increase
in [Minors in Possession] last year com
pared to other years."
Rather than opting for a "police
state" college atmosphere — where res
idence staff enforce campus policy —
