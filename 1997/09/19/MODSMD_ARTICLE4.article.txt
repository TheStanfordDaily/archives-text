# Stanford moves up in U.S. News
## And the Winner Is... 
### Will Parks 
Stanford University, ranked sixth
in last year's U.S. News & World Re
port rankings, has moved up one notch
to fifth place overall in the nation.
The University, however, did not
participate in all parts of the surveys
that the magazine distributes to all ac
credited four-year colleges.
According to Terry Shepard, direc
tor of University communications,
Stanford "did not participate in the
reputation rankings, which ask three
officers (president, provost and dean
of admissions) to rank all other
schools in our category by quartile."
Shepard added that the University
did supply objective data for the sur
vey, such as the class size and student
faculty ratio.
