# Stanford moves up in U.S. News
## And the Winner Is... 
### Will Parks 
Stanford University, ranked sixth
in last year's U.S. News & World Re
port rankings, has moved up one notch
to fifth place overall in the nation.
The University, however, did not
participate in all parts of the surveys
that the magazine distributes to all ac
credited four-year colleges.
According to Terry Shepard, direc
tor of University communications,
Stanford "did not participate in the
reputation rankings, which ask three
officers (president, provost and dean
of admissions) to rank all other
schools in our category by quartile."
Shepard added that the University
did supply objective data for the sur
vey, such as the class size and student
faculty ratio.

University President Gerhard
Casper took issue with the magazine
last year after the release of the 1997
rankings.
In a personal letter to James Fal
lows, editor of U.S. News, Casper re
quested that changes be made to the
magazine's "America's Best Col
leges" issue, reportedly the best-sell
ing issue of the year for the magazine.
Casper wrote to voice his concern
"that much about these rankings - par
ticularly their specious formulas and
spurious precision - is utterly mislead
ing."
Citing the movement of colleges up
and down in the rankings from year to
year, Casper wrote that "such move
ment itself - while perhaps good for
generating attention and sales - cor
rodes the credibility of these rankings
and your magazine itself."
In step, Casper continued, as he has
for the last few years, to withhold the
subjective part of the survey, while
University Provost Condoleezza Rice
and James Montoya, then dean of un

dergraduate admission and financial
aids, joined him last >ear.
"Many colleges and universities,
including Stanford, have begun to
consider withdrawing from the annual
U.S. News survey on the grounds that
its methods of ranking institutions are
misleading and inaccurate," Casper
declared in a statement announcing
the decision.
In addition to withholding informa
tion, Stanford began a web site at
http://www.stanford.edu/home/statistics
to help college students decide for them
selves which college is best for them.
Following Stanford's lead, Clark
University, Alma College, Bryn
Mawr, Rice University and others
have released objective information
on the Internet, Shepard said.
Casper noted that managers of the
Internet search service Yahoo! had ex
pressed willingness to provide a cen
tral link to these pages.
U.S. News stated in the magazine
that they felt compelled to continue
the overall rankings to "serve as an ob
jective guide by which students and
their parents can compare schools."
In response to last year's criti
cisms, the magazine has made a few

changes. The biggest change in the
rankings has been the decision to
round the score of each college to the
nearest whole number.
This change has created numerous
ties in the rankings which, according
to the magazine, are meant better to il
lustrate the negligible difference in the
quality of schools of similar ranking.
In cases where schools have not
fully cooperated, U.S. News uses
comparable data from various other
sources, such as the NCAA, the Amer
ican Association of University Profes
sors, and data they collected them
selves in a prior year.
Nick Thompson, last year's ASSU
vice president, organized the Forget
U.S. News Coalition to initiate similar
action among other institutions.
Speaking on the future of IT INC,
current ASSU President Emily An
drus and Vice President Ben Decker
promised that FUNC will not deviate
from its mission.
"I think they will ontinue to sup
port efforts on other campuses," said
Decker. "I think the central idea is: I
think you need to explain how you gel
the numbers .. . and take it with a
grain of salt."
