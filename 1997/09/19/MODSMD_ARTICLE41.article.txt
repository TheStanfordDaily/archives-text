# Answers for the dazed and confused
## 
### 
As helpful as your RA may be, your first few weeks
at Stanford can be a little disorienting. So to make your
first weeks at Stanford as worry-free as possible, we
compiled this list of answers to some of the most fre
quently asked Orientation week questions:
• How do I pay my University Bill and ensure my fi
nancial aid?
To pay your bill, go to the Oak West lounge on the
second floor of Tresidder Union. If you already have a
check for the amount due, just look for the big box in
which to deposit your yellow envelope. If you suspect
an error in your bill or need to get loan disbursements or
pick up scholarship money, thene are several specific
counters to assist you. But if you hfcve questions, come

activities that you think are important or sound interest

fer credit and wish to take a math class, you need to take
the math placement test. All math placement tests are
taken using computers in dorm clusters and last one

hour. You should plan to take the lest before you meet
with your adviser. Your score, which you will get as
soon as you finish the test, is strictly confidential.
Chemistry: Placement tests are also available for
students planning to enroll in a chemistry class at Stan
ford. Check your Orientation calendar for times and lo
cations. As with the math test, your score is personal in
formation.
Foreign language: If you have studied a foreign lan
guage and plan to take the same language at Stanford,
you need to take the placement test. The University re
quires all students to achieve competency in a foreign
language equal to a third quarter, first year course. If
you do not have AP language credit, you should plan to
take this test. Even if you do have AP credit, check with
