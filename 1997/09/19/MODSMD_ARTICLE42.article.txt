## Year-long discussion to be led by Lag RF

Following President Clinton's call in June for a national
conversation about race and racism, West Lagunita Resident
Fellow Stewart Burns responded by organizing the first Stan
ford Dialogue on Race, taking place this school year.
A historian and writer, Burns said he hopes the yearlong
dialogue — which will take the form of student research and

"I grew up in a completely white town, but I was always
concerned with racial issues, especially segregation," he said.
Burns recalled a shocking scene of the treatment of blacks
shown on a television broadcast in spring 1963.
"Kids were being attacked by police dogs and assaulted
with a firehose. The blast was so ferocious that it ripped off
their shirts and pushed them up against the trees," he said of
the episode in Birmingham, Ala.
That summer, Bums took a month-long trip across the
United States by himself, sleeping in train compartments at
night and exploring new cities during the day. Along the way,
Bums, then 14, encountered racial slurs in Chicago and at
tempted to desegregate a train station waiting room in Alaba
ma by sitting in the section delegated for "colored" passen-
