# Stanford Dialogue on Race to begin this fall
## Year-long discussion to be led by Lag RF 
### Tracy Jan Editorial staff 
Following President Clinton's call in June for a national
conversation about race and racism, West Lagunita Resident
Fellow Stewart Burns responded by organizing the first Stan
ford Dialogue on Race, taking place this school year.
A historian and writer, Burns said he hopes the yearlong
dialogue — which will take the form of student research and
residence-based discussions — will culminate in concrete
policy recommendations to be made to the White House.
"My hope is that the process of dialogue is constructive
and participatory, leading to substantive results, actual ideas
and policy proposals," he said.
Burns first came to Stanford in 1989 as the editor of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, an ongoing compila
tion of King documents directed by History Prof. Clayborne
Carson. Two years later, he and Jane Benson became RFs of
West Lagunita in order to work more directly with students.
Burns has also taught King courses in the History Depart
ment, focusing on the civil rights movement and the Mont
gomery bus boycott.
Burns' interest in race began in the early 1960s as a school
boy in Williamstown, Mass. His liberal parents, supporters of
civil rights, instilled the values of fairness and equality in
their son.
"I grew up in a completely white town, but I was always
concerned with racial issues, especially segregation," he said.
Burns recalled a shocking scene of the treatment of blacks
shown on a television broadcast in spring 1963.
"Kids were being attacked by police dogs and assaulted
with a firehose. The blast was so ferocious that it ripped off
their shirts and pushed them up against the trees," he said of
the episode in Birmingham, Ala.
That summer, Bums took a month-long trip across the
United States by himself, sleeping in train compartments at
night and exploring new cities during the day. Along the way,
Bums, then 14, encountered racial slurs in Chicago and at
tempted to desegregate a train station waiting room in Alaba
ma by sitting in the section delegated for "colored" passen-

gers.
At the end of that summer, Burns
took part in a King march in Washing
ton, D.C. The events led to his active in
volvement in the civil rights movement
that lasted beyond his college years at
Columbia University.
Currently, Burns is working on his
first novel. He has also written a book on
the Montgomery bus boycott titled
"Daybreak of Freedom," which will be
available in bookstores in October.
As an RF, Burns said he encourages
interested Stanford students to work
with him on book projects and to con
duct independent research on race.
The campus-wide discussions on

race will emphasize possible solutions to
race-related problems and give "permis
sion for everyone, including white stu
dents who may normally feel excluded,
to engage in this dialogue," Burns said.
"Everyone has an experience of race
and racial identity and each one is as
valid as the other."
According to Bums, Stanford has
"really changed in terms of its racial
composition" over the past 10 years.
Stanford's admissions and financial aid
policies have made its student body the
most racially diverse of any private uni
versity, he said, although the faculty
needs to catch up.
"With California the key battle
ground on race and with the University
of California system in turmoil... it is
incumbent upon the West's preeminent
private university to assert leadership in

resolving California's racial crisis,"
Burns wrote in his dialogue proposal.
California voters passed Proposition
209 last fall, calling for an end to affir
mative action in the state. In addition, the
University of California system made a
well-publicized decision to stop consid
ering race as a factor in admission.
Those decisions have offered plen
ty of discussion material, Burns said.
He plans to conclude the dialogues
with the daylong Stanford Town
Meeting on Race in April — designed
to synthesize the year's work and com
memorate the 30th anniversary of
King's assassination.
"1 see the dialogue as an open-ended
process that could lead in a lot of direc
tions," Bums said. "The talk can't just
be the touchy-feely stuff; it must lead to
action."
