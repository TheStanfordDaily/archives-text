## Campus jobs extend beyond dining services 
### Piers Henwood Staff writer 
With only four years to explore the endless opportunities
available to Stanford students, why wallow behind the counter
of Wilbur dining services throwing liquefied mashed potatoes
on unappreciative classmates' plates?
For students desiring more inventive forms of on-campus
employment: take heart. There is indeed life beyond hashing.
Since 1989, the Financial Aids Office has provided the Uni
versity with a unique computer database, rewarding resourceful
students with employment listings that stretch well beyond the
boundaries of Housing and Dining Services.
The Student Employment Database is an excellent way for
incoming students to align their particular interests with job op
portunities, according to Susan Farrell, who until last year co
ordinated the office's work-study programs.
"Using [the database], everyone can match their interests with
jobs on campus which seem most appealing to them," she said.
The database, intended for students on financial aid only, is
accessible through Folio, Stanford's on-line computer net
work. Folio is available in dorm and library computer clusters
across campus.
Job opportunities are divided into categories, allowing stu

dents to focus on general areas like counseling, sales, retail or
lab-related employment. After choosing a category, the student
is presented with information on jobs listed within that area, in
cluding descriptions of duties involved, skills required and
hourly wages.
After finding an interesting job listing on the computer, a
student must visit the Financial Aids Office for contact names
and telephone numbers, Farrell said.
Particular jobs in the database are also set aside for students
granted Federal College Work-Study. This program is designed
for students whose families have an annual income of $15,000
or less.
Employers of these students are only required to pay 25 per
cent of the student's salary, leaving the federal government to
cover the remaining 75 percent.
According to Mary Morrison, assistant director in Financial
Aids Office, this policy aims to increase the number of em
ployment opportunities for the students who need them most.
"The students benefit [from the work-study program] be
cause everyone wants to hire them, since the employer need
only pay a quarter of the salary," she said.
Students interested in employment who are not on financial
aid may wish to venture into the counsel
ing wing of the Career Planning and
Placement Center, where a veritable li
brary of binders contain employment in
formation available to anyone. Typical
jobs listed here range from research op
portunities with Stanford professors to

computer-related positions at various lo
cations around campus.
In addition, the network of Stanford
libraries provides ample employment
potential for any student interested in
the University's literary resources. One
notable example is the Department of
Special Collections in Green Library,
which often requires assistance in order
to categorize newly arrived bodies of
work.
Linda Long, a public services assis

tant for the department, noted that stu
dents can help tremendously with the
processing of new collections.
"In the past, students have helped us
put (new collections] into acid-free fold
ers. .. and have organized collections by
typing up guides," she said.
To make Stanford employment even
more attractive, the average wage for on
campus jobs through Stanford is $8.10 —
an amount that is well above federal min
imum wage.
