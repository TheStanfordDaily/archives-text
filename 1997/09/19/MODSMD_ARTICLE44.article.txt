# Stanfordese 101
## Going from the Co Ho to the Co Po on a quest for a fro yo 
### Jimmy Boegle Staff writer 
Unbeknownst to everybody from the outside
world, Stanford students all speak a different lan
guage. It is true; soon, you will be speaking this
language, too.
The language is called Stanfordese. Basically,
it consists of taking two or more words and mak
ing them into catchy little rhythmic smaller words.
You may ask, "Why is this?" The answer: We
don't know. We just do it. All of us.
Here is a short Stanfordese-English dictionary
to get you through the next few days. You may

want to carry it around with you.
Co Ho: The Coffee House. A traditional Stan
ford hang out in Tresidder Union that serves food
and drinks such as coffee.
Co Po: The Corner Pocket. Another tradition
al Stanford hang out in Tresidder that serves pizza,
smoothies and fro yo (see below). However, they
do not sell pockets.
Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Another audi
torium, located across from the Co Ho (see
above).
Flo Mo: Florence Moore Hall. A big dormito
ry located just off of the Row, named after a
woman named Florence Moore. She gave Stan

ford lots of money.
Fro Yo: Frozen Yogurt. Served at the Co Po
(see above), a substitute for ice cream. Many Cal
ifornians are scared of ice cream because it has fat
in it; thus, they eat fro yo.
Mem Aud: Memorial Auditorium. An audito
rium located across from Hoover Tower. They
show Flicks there every Sunday night. Flicks are
cheap movies with paper fights included.
Mem Chu: Memorial Church. A non-denom
inational church located in the Quad.
MuFulJnSun: Music and Fun Under the Sun.
An event that happens during the first week back
to campus involving music and fun. The Student

Activities Fair will be held this year during the
event.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman. You were
one of these once. The official term is now "ad
mits." Ihis term is disliked by most students, as
there is no potential Stanfordese word for it. If you
host a pro fro, you are a pro fro ho. If you coordi
nate the dorm's pro fro ho group, you are a pro fro
ho do co. Whoa.
KesComp: Residential Computing. Hie peo
ple who put the computers in your dorms and take
care of them. Usually.
Kes Ed: Residential Education. Hie people
who put on many programs in your dormitories all

year. No relation to the horse, Mr. Ed.
Tnes Ex: Tresidder Express. The on-campus
store, located in Tresidder. Iliey sell Cheetos, de
odorant and other tasty things.
That should enough to get you through the first
few weeks. To test your knowledge, look at the
following paragraph:
My pro fro ho stopped at the Co Po to get a fro
yo on her way luick from MuFuUnSun. She ran
into a friend that worked for Res Comp in a build
ing between the Co Ho arul Dink.
It this made sense, congratulations! And if you
realized that there is no building between the Co
I lo and Dink, you're way ahead of the game.
