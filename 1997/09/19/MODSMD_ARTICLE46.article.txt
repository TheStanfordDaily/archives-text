Try and pick up
your mail from your
boxes and get your
parcels as soon as
you get a notice. The
boxes tend to get too
full, and we don't
have the space here
to store all the pack
ages we get. It would

certainly help us.

Post Office
Don't take 20 units. You'll spread
yourself too thin, and you'll feel like
you can't do a good job in your class
es. Many students get pressure from
upperclassmen and feel like they're
wasting their parents' money if they
don't take a heavy course load. There
are lots of fun things to take advan
tage of around the Stanford campus.
Explore!
—Laura Smoller, acting assistant pro
fessor of history

As far as financial matters are con
cerned, ask — don't assume. Come in,

pay, ask us.

brarian arul freshman adviser

We're here to help you.

While I could quibble with the ques
tion, my criticism is consonant with my

advice: learn to think
critically and inde
pendently.
—Jean Fetter, for
mer assistant to the
president
Although you
will be overwhelmed
with the many activi-

ties, opportunities and resources that
Stanford has to offer, it is critical to re
main focused on your primary purpose,
which is your academic course of study.
Moreover, 1 would strongly encourage
the students to engage the faculty on a
personal level before or after class or

during office hours. Students are the
ones that need to take this initiative.
—Marc Wilis, dean of students
Be calm. We know that some students
will not have loans in place by the Sept.
24 payment date. But there's a way to

help students get reg
istered. If a loan hiis
been authorized, but
the loan check isn't
in, students can defer
for the amount of the
bill which will be
paid by the loan.
Once the loan check
arrives, pay the bill

with the loan check and the bursar's of
fice won't charge for interest or a loan fee.
—Cynthia Rife, director of student
awards, Financial Aids Office
Relax. Enjoy your roommates. Lie

Enjoy this great experience in all its
dimensions. Relax.

You should be a BIG success —

Good. lake the classes and curriculum
that fit you, not some recipe.
—AloeLozano, associate dean of student
affairs, School of Engineering
