Somehow, borrowing a car from that guy down
the halJ who you've only known for a few hours and
driving all over the Bay Area to pick up stuff you
forgot to bring to school may seem sketchy.
There are plenty of places within biking and
walking distance of your residei «e where you can
shop for those forgotten items, /jid when you real
ize after only three days that ycj cannot eat another
bite of dorm food, there are other places to eat as
well.
For on-campus shopping, try the Bookstore, the
lesser known Central Stores or Tresidder Express,
affectionately known as Tres Ex.
The multi-floored Bookstore carries a stagger
ing supply of writing supplies and Stanford apparel,
from fluorescent index cards to the übiquitous
sweatshirt. Several times during the year, wall
posters of every style and size are for sale in front of
the Bookstore. There is a small cafe upstairs and Mi
crodisc, on the lower level, has great discounts on
computers and software for Stanford students.
Located near the athletic facilities at 330 Bonair
Siding, Central Stores also has good discounts on
computers, engineering supplies and boxes, al
though it is less well known than the Bookstore.
While it doesn't carry computers, Tresidder Ex
press will come in handy when you need a late night
Big Slam Pepsi, or you run out of toothpaste. Stan
ford's version of 7-Eleven faces the patio behind
Tresidder and is open from 7:30 a.m. to midnight
every day.
If you are willing to head off campus for slightly
lower prices, a Safeway supermarket and Pay Less
Drug are just north of Stanford on El Camino Real,
only a short biking distance away. Both are open 24
hours. Safeway carries all those goodies for stock
ing your newly rented refrigerator while Pay Less
has more hangers, Q-tips and toenail clippers than
you could ever need.
All that shopping may make you hungry and for
tunately for those with weak stomachs, there are
plenty of eateries other than dorm cafeterias within

walking or biking distance.
The cafeteria in Tresidder is open from 7 a.m. to
2 p.m., serving breakfast and lunch. Both Baker
Street, which sells sandwiches, and the Corner
Pocket, which sells pizza, frozen yogurt and
smoothies, are also in Tresidder.
Open Monday through Friday until 2 a.m. and
until midnight on the weekend, the Coffee House is
good for both studying and just relaxing. The
CoHo's late hours allow for quite a social scene as
late evening sets in.
Polio Rey's and Jamba Juice round out the
Tresidder vendors, offering Mexican burritos and
fruit juice smoothies respectively. Polio's is open
from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.; Jamba Juice also opens at 11
a.m. but closes at 9 p.m.
If you are sick of campus food altogether, there
are several restaurants in downtown Palo Alto with
plenty of good grub to fill you up. Check out this
week's Intermission issue for local values.
