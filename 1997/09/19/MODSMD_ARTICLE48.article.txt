# Transfers discover a new campus for a second time
## 
### Greg Farber Rebecca Bowen 
Unlike most of the 1,600 new faces in the community,
you've been to college a couple of years already. But those
resident assistants have already mistaken you for a freshman
dozens of times, and you're still trying to find Susan Dellwo's
office. Like the freshmen, you have no idea what CIV stands
for, much less why everyone else your age has a horror story
to relate about it.
Whether you're concerned about buying a bike helmet,
learning the names of your fellow residents or pondering the
best route from Governor's Corner to the Quad, here's some
advice to help out with your first few weeks on the Farm.
There are some things that every transfer student should
know.
First things First — ostensibly you came here for the acad
emics. Like most transfers, you probably have a million wor
ries about which credits Stanford will permit you to transfer.
Don't sweat it too hard the first few weeks here; after lobby
ing your cause to the transfer credit office, all you can do is
wait.
Be sure to ask the upper-class students in your residence
about good / easy / interesting classes and professors. Locat
ing engaging professors in your field early will give you a
head start on finding an adviser, who can help to make sure
that you graduate on time.
Also, head to department open houses to talk to students
about their majors and professors about their research fields

— if nothing else, it's an opportunity for free food. The quick
er you become academically plugged in, the sooner you will
feel comfortable sleeping through those fun early morning
classes.
Second, take advantage of the abundance of activities here
on campus, ranging from wind surfing to fountain hopping.
Your introduction to acronyms and activities begins at Mu-
FuUnSun, which is definitively the place to score lots of free
stuff and sign up to receive hundreds of e-mails from various
ethnic, political, athletic, artistic and self-help organizations.
Residential Education has also planned several valuable
activities that should keep you busy. Attending some of the
various discussion groups following scintillating presenta
tions such as "The Real World" and "Up2U@Stanford"
should give you a sense of how your fellow transfer students
feel about debauchery at Stanford.
On the subject of intoxication and camaraderie, some past
transfers have chosen to rush the Greek system. Rush for
transfers can be informal, and unlike for freshman, it occurs
all year long. For those so inclined, intramural sports also
combine a great workout and tan that is sure to impress your
old college friends over Thanksgiving.
So instead of rehashing tales of your former academic in
stitution with fellow residents, seek out all the Farm has to
offer. Oh, and here's a few final tips to ease the transition: Only
graduate students wear bike helmets; your RA is the onJy per
son who will bother to learn everyone's name; and if you live
in Governor's Corner, there is no best route anywhere.
