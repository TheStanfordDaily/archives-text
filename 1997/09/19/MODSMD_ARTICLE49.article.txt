# Undergraduates participate in many community service areas

University President Gerhard Casper recently called on
Stanford students to "not shy away from the social and po
litical issues of their time, from shaping the social and po
litical values of society, from engaging in public service."
This message of community involvement is alive and
well within the Stanford population.
According to recent surveys of graduating seniors,
more than 70 percent of undergraduates are involved in
public service. Although there are many avenues for stu
dents interested in pursuing public service while at Stan
ford — including ethnic organizations, the Greek system
and programs in residential education — most students
begin their search for community service opportunities
with the help of the Haas Center.
Established in 1985, the Haas Center for Public Service,
located on the comer of Campus Dr. and Salvatierra St.,
helps more than 3,000 students annually in their local, na
tional and international voluntary efforts. In recent years,
the Haas Center has launched an overwhelming 70,000
hours of voluntary service by Stanford students.
The center is home to more than 20 student service or
ganizations and University programs, ranging from East
Palo Alto tutoring programs such as Ravenswood Stanford
Tutoring Program to the Community Service Writing Pro

gram, an option which fulfills the freshman Writing and
Critical Thinking requirement.
The center also focuses on connecting students' service
work to their academic work. In particular, the Haas Cen
ter is also working with Stanford professors in an effort to
add to the more than 60 existing service-learning courses
available.
Programs like the Community Service Writing Pro
gram and the Community Service Work-Study Program,
which allow students to use public service hours to meet fi
nancial aid work requirements, can help students further in
tegrate community service into their academic lives as
well.
The Haas Center itself contains vast resources to help
individual students pursue service. The Information and
Resource Center, located on the first floor, is filled with
books and pamphlets concerning volunteering opportuni
ties, and students can hook up to Odyssey, Stanford's on
line network containing more then 600 listings of commu
nity service work.
Peer advisors are also available during Haas Center
hours, both by appointment and for drop-in meetings.
Usually students with a large amount of volunteering ex
perience at Stanford, these advisors are a good resource
for incoming freshman trying to decide how to volunteer
at Stanford.
