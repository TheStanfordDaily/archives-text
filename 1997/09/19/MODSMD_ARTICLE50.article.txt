This weekend, hundreds of hours will be spent preparing

Soon after arriving on campus, my roommate noticed an
incredibly attractive woman in his Chem 31 class. She was,
he relayed, a Pre-Med Goddess — a PMG.
He could not, however, muster the chutzpah to ask her
out. He plotted and planned for weeks for the perfect oppor
