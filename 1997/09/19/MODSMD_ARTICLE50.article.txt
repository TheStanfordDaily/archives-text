# Dating
## Love on the Farm is not impossible 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
This weekend, hundreds of hours will be spent preparing
the Stanford class of 2001 for the challenges awaiting them
over the next four years. But for the all the pomp and cir
cumstance, the message you should take away is simple:
"Freshmen, welcome to the Farm where the winds of
freedom blow, everyone hates the Weenies, and no one ever
dates."
There is no disputing the First two parts of that message.
There are also few disputes with the third. Some — in the
minority — will try to refute the third with anecdotes or by
parading about with their significant others, attempting to
prove the claim a myth.
The problem, however, is not imagined. It is sufficiently
serious to merit concern from even the highest of Stanford
officials. Addressing Sophomore College, Stanford's sum
mer seminars for second year students, University President
Gerhard Casper offered hope to the romantically disenfran
chised.
"You can make a choice," Casper proclaimed. "You can
go out on a date."
Statistics would indicate that the solution might be that
simple.
Herant Katchadourian, a professor of psychiatry, behav
ioral sciences and human biology, conducted an in-depth,
decade-long study on the Stanford class of 1981. Ten per
cent of his sample set married another Stanford student. An
additional 10 percent married someone they met in graduate
school — presumably, for some portion of the group, also at
Stanford.
However, statistics offer little help to those caught on the
losing end — like my freshman roommate.
Soon after arriving on campus, my roommate noticed an
incredibly attractive woman in his Chem 31 class. She was,
he relayed, a Pre-Med Goddess — a PMG.
He could not, however, muster the chutzpah to ask her
out. He plotted and planned for weeks for the perfect oppor
tunity to dazzle her with his witty banter and hopefully be-

come her life-long soul mate. His
chance finally came with our dormito
ry's annual Screw Your Roommate.
The SYR — its name derived from
the ancient fraternity parties where
members set up their friends with the
ugliest women they could find — is,
these days the most important social
event for anyone seeking love. Almost
every dormitory, at some point during
the year, will hold one.
It goes something like this: you
will convince your roommate to ask
out the date of your choosing, and
everyone will pretend it's a blind date,
ignoring the fact you didn't have the
courage to make the date yourself.
For the PMG, I recruited a mutu
al female friend to ask the PMG out
for my roommate. While I sat in the
room, she placed the call on my
speakerphone. The question was
posed. The obligatory pause was al
lowed while the PMG and whoever
else happened to be in her room trad
ed glances and quickly dove for the
freshman face book. Out of courtesy,
my accomplice repeated my room
mate's name and, in deference to its
complexity, spelled it.

The pause seemed to last forever,
112 inally the PMG drew in an audible
breath on the other end and quickly,
but clearly so as not to confuse the
message, replied: "I'msorrybutlhave
togooutoftownthatweekendbye." Si
lence — and eventual a dial tone —
followed.
"Well," I said after hanging up the
phone, "maybe it's her grandmother's
9()th birthday."
"Yeah," my accomplice replied
sharing a look that did not convinc
ingly convey her agreement.
My roommate took the rejection
well when I told him, shrugging off
the defeat and turning back to his cal
culus, but, as 1 discovered later, it
weighed heavy on his mind.
letter that night, after we had both
gone to bed, he laid staring at the ceil
ing. The pressure of class, the SYR
and other things that 1 was never fully
aware pushed him over a line. Me ad
mitted — as some many other Stan
ford students do — his desperation in
a single sentence repeated every night
for the next six months in what, by his
own admission, was the most pathetic
time of his life.
"Pat," he whined. "1 need a
woman."
I have witnessed too many gtxnl
men and women reach this point. For
my roommate there were other PMGs,

but none induced the same enthusiasm.
Deflated, many victims of Stan
ford's social environment, such as my
roommate, never seem to recover.
They drift hopelessly through four
years of half-hearted hopes of happi
ness.
But the problem isn't irreversible.
Life, unlike an honors theses, is best
without extensive planning.
My roommate spent his entire
freshman year pining over women he
knew only from afar, but Fate eventu
ally smiled on him. Eight days before
the end of the year, he met a woman in
the most informal of settings: our
dorm lobby. Within an hour of meet
ing, this woman appeared at our door.
Before I could even politely excuse
myself, phone numbers were ex
changed, and a date was made.
Despite finals, the two of them saw
each other often and successfully car
ried their budding romance into the
next year.
It seems that President Casper's
words might well hold the solution to
the dating problem at this university:
let go of your insecurities and Fate
may smile upon you.
If it doesn't, you can console your
self as the rest of us unlucky souls do.
Remember: if you don't find love in
this environment, 1.6(H) new fresh
men arrive one year from today.
