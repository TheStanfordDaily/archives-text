# New survey aids in roommate matching
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
It's a mystery to most incoming
freshmen exactly how they ended up
with their roommates. It often seems
that something as simple as musical
preferences provided the basis for the
match.
As it turns out, that's not too far
from the truth.
For about a decade, the roommate
destiny of Stanford freshmen has been
controlled by two students working at
the New Undergraduate Student Infor
mation Project. Part of Housing As
signment Services, project coordina
tors act as the main point of contact for
students from the time they accept ad
mission to Stanford to when they ar
rive on campus.
Senior coordinator Amanda Boyd
and junior coordinator Susanne Ek
lund spent the summer sorting through
piles of information from freshmen
and transfers, trying to find perfect
matches. Up until today, they were re
vising the list and rearranging posi
tions.
Without a whole lot of information

'We pair them like
anyone else would
— if they listen to
the same music or
go to bed at the
same time.'

at their disposal, Boyd and Eklund
matched roommates based on any sim
ilarities they could find.
"We pair them like anyone else
would — if they listen to the same
music or go to bed at the same time,"
Boyd explained.
A new form freshmen filled out
made the process somewhat easier this
year, she said.
In the past, the same form used for
matching roommates also went to
freshman advisers and so was limited
in terms of information on the stu

dents' living habits. Last year, as ju
nior coordinator, Boyd helped develop
a separate form for use in roommate
assignments.
Much of the work is done by a com
puter program, which assigns students
to dormitories based on preferences
for ethnic theme dorms, single-sex
floors and all-freshman dormitories.
The program coordinators then sort
through the results and make changes
to ensure a geographic and ethnic bal
ance within each dormitory.
"We want each dorm as much as
possible to be a microcosm of the
class," Boyd said.
Diversity is a goal within rooms,
too, Eklund added. Students should
have a chance to share different cultur
al and geographic backgrounds but
have enough in common that they feel
comfortable spending Saturday after
noon together, she said.
Finding out if matches were suc
cessful is not easy, Boyd said, but the
coordinators make dorm presentations
during the year and on occasion hear
about a good match.
"I had a couple of guys last year
[tell me] they were kindred spirits,"

Boyd said.
And whoever matched Eklund with
her freshman roommate did a good
job, which helped convince the senior
to apply to the two-year position last
winter. She has had the same room
mate throughout her Stanford career.
I he pairing takes up several weeks
of the summer, when the coordinators
are also busy answering new students'
questions. After each mailing goes
out, they are inundated with questions.
Most students call to ask what their
rooms will be like or whether they
should bring certain items. One in
coming freshman called to say he was
6-foot-10 and didn't know how he was
going to find a long enough bed.
There's a temptation to tell the
freshmen just not to worry about
anything, Boyd said, but they really
do need reassuring. "I have to think
back to remember that the questions
they're asking are the same ones we
had," she said.
Next year, as senior coordinator,
Eklund said she plans to continue run
ning the project in a similar way. A
new junior coordinator will be hired
during winter quarter.
