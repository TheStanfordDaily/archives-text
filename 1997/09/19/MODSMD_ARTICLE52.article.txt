## Financial Aid adds new technology

Financial Aids Office's new Inter
active Voice Response system offers
students an easy way to stay informed
about the status of their financial aid
application and award.
The new system alleviates much of
the confusion surrounding the finan
cial aid process by addressing stu
dents' most frequently asked ques
tions.
By next week, students calling the
Financial Aids Office at 723-3058

will be able to select the hotline and
find out if their financial aid applica
tion is complete and what, if anything,
is missing. Students will also be able
to find out if their loan checks are
ready to be picked up.
"We implemented the IVR to pro
vide students with better service,"
said Cynthia Rife, director of student
awards.
Traditionally, loan availability in
formation has been posted outside the
Financial Aids Office and near the
line for loan pickup in Tresidder
Union during the first day of the quar
ter.
Frequently, students did not look
at the postings and spent several hours
standing in line only to find out that
their loan checks were not ready, Rife
said.
"Now, students can use the voice
response system before getting in line
to collect their checks," she added.
The introduction of the IVR is the
second step in office's effort to be
come more efficient. Last year the of
fice implemented a computer system
to address data processing.
"We had a difficult year and need
ed a new system to provide informa
tion on personal financial aid and
general policy," said Rife.
This year's addition of the IVR
came as a result of a Student Commu

nication Services initiative.
"They saw the Financial Aids Of
fice as a great place to implement the
IVR," said Rife.
Along with releasing the IVR, the
office also announced that this year
the loan check processing has gone
more smoothly than in the past. As a
result, a greater than average percent
age of loan checks have arrived and
are available for pickup on Monday
and Tuesday.
The present situation is a drastic
improvement from last year's delays
in aid calculations, which were
caused by the computer system's in
stillation.
Last fall students received bills
that did not reflect scholarships,
grants or other credits and had to defer
parts of their bills until the changes
had been processed.
Former Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid James
Montoya said last year that the real
test of the computer system would
come after it was up and running.
This fall's increased processing
efficiency seems to indicate that the
system has passed that test.
Even with the new IVR system and
the high percentage of loan checks
available, not everyone will be able to
