Greetings from cheery resident assis
tants, helping hands from smiling Orien
tation Volunteers and introductions to
KM) new light-hearted faces. Stanford
seems like a pretty secure place to many
new students.
In making the transition to campus
life, however, freshmen and transfer stu
dents often become overly trusting and
rather careless during their first few days
on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a recent
study of 58 schmils called "Crime at
College: the Student Guide to Public
Safety," Stanford was ranked one of the
15 safest campuses in the nation
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm — and the at
mosphere of Orientation can he the ideal
time for crooks to make their mark.
In most cases, however, simple pre
cautionary measur. s can help deter theft
from ruining a good first year.
Lock up that bike
For the past decade and a half, the

number one reported crime on campus
has been bicycle theft. In 1 996 alone,
384 bikes were reported stolen and
through the first seven months of 1997,
213 bikes were stolen.
But Stanford Police speculate the ac
tual number of thefts is twice that num
ber, because many do not bother to re
port their stolen bikes.
"We are trying very hard to [ decrease
the trend]," Stanford Police ('apt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. Hike thieves "just come
out of the woodwork."
To avoid becoming one of the many
unfortunate victims, Niemeyer advises
students to lock up their bicycles. Al
though U-locks are the most effective
locking devices, he also recommends
getting "Bad Bones," which span the
length of the lock and can make it five
times stronger.
Iliieves "tend to stay away from
bikes with that device on it,"he said.
Niemeyer also added that there is lit
tle value in lixking a bike to itself, since
thieves can just "toss the bike onto a
truck and go." He recommends locking
bikes to an immovable object, such as a
bicycle rack or post.
Most of the bikes recovered are high
quality mountain bikes, according to
Niemeyer. Obviously, he said, the better
the quality of the bike, the higher the
likelihood that it will get stolen.
In recent years the Stanford Police
have worked to be more visible and
catch more bike thieves, Niemeyer said.
He also urges everyone to register his or
her bike with the police because "with
out a victim, we can't prosecute [a
thief]."
Daniel Smith, special services man
ager at the Department of Public Safety,
echoed Niemeyer's urge to register
bikes.
"It's not unusual for the police to
catch a thief but have no victim," he said.
Smith added that bike registration
will continue to be easy this year: For a
fee of $3.50, students can register their
bikes at the Transportation Programs of
fice in 855 Serra in front of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium for this week only.
In addition, California state law man
dates that anyone under 18 wear a hel
met when riding a bike. The law also
"strongly encourages" those 18 years
and older to wear a helmet, and bike
lights continue to be required for those
riding at night.
Dorm room safety
Ideally, dorm residences are sup
posed to be locked up after midnight.
This is usually not the case, however,
since students go in and out of their
dorms well after that time. Many choose
to prop the door open as they make their
early morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not usually
try their luck in the dorms after mid
night. Instead, many know when stu
dents won't be in and hit the dorms
while most students are at lunch, dinner
or in the shower.
"All it takes is for [burglars] to walk
down the hall and try one of the doors,"
Niemeyer said.
In 1996, there were 177 reports of
structural burglary, and for the first half
of this year, 108 burglaries were report
ed to the police department.

There is, however, a simple solution
to keep from becoming a statistic,
Niemeyer said — keep doors locked
whenever rooms are empty, even if it
will be for a short period of time.
In addition, 140 cases of vehicle bur
glary were reported in 1996.
According to Stanford Police, this
time of year is notorious for vehicle bur
glary since there are so many students
moving things into their new residences.
Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime, "body
crime" (like aggravated and sexual as
sault) is relatively rare on the Stanford
campus.
In all of 1996, there were six reports
of aggravated assault and seven reports
of forcible sex offense.
Most sexual assaults are acquain
tance (or date) rape and often involve al
cohol, Niemeyer said.
The Department of Public Safety
strongly recommends using routes high
lighted on the Suggested Travel Routes
Map. Although they may not be the
shortest distance between two points,
the routes are well traveled, adequately
lighted and located in open-space areas.
SURE Escort Service is also avail
able and will accompany students by
motorized cart anywhere on campus.
Students can contact the free service by
calling 725-SURE.
Perhaps the most important crime
busting tip is personal awareness and re
sponsibility. If a situation feels suspi
cious or threatening, change directions,
go to a populated area, call a friend to
meet you or call 9-911 from a campus
phone or 911 from an off-campus
phone.
If you are the victim of a crime, call
the police immediately — when a crime
goes unreported, a criminal may attack
again. Also make sure to report any sus
picious persons, vehicles or activities to
the police.
In order to help those who have been
sexually assaulted, the Sexual Assault
Resource Center located in Cowell Stu
dent Health Center is open 8 a.m. to 5
p.m. Monday through Friday for infor
mation and counseling. In addition the
Campus Sexual Assault and Recovery
Team is available 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(also in Cowell) and operates 24-hour
crisis services.

Bicycle theft ranks highest among Stanford crime. Locking bikes to stationary objects and using "Bad Bones" with U-locks greatly reduce
the risk of falling victim to thieves.
