# Dorm lives
## Residences boast rich histories 
### Jimmy Boogle Staff writer 
Welcome to Stanford, and wel
come to your new dormitory — your
home for the next nine months. As
you become acquainted with the
campus, you will begin to discover
that there is a lot of history here. Your
dormitory is definitely no exception.
I lete is a brief history of each dor
mitory or house that will be home to
freshmen during this IW7-9K school
year.
Hranner Hall
Branner sucks. Period. That is
how everybody feels, unless you ac
tually live there; it is an unofficial
Stanford rule. Branner is the largest
all-frosh dorm on campus, and every
year, the Brannerites arc generally
known to be the most boisterous, ob
noxious group of frosh on campus.
Their annoying chants at football
games and their annual disruption of
Gaieties, the Big Game week musi
cal, have annoyed other students for
decades.
However, Branner was not always
known for its obnoxiousness. The
dormitory opened in 1924, named
after John Casper Branner, Stan
ford's president from 1913-15. Orig
inally an all-women's dormitory, the
dorm changed between all-male and
all-female several times before even
tually becoming one of the first coed

dorms on campus. When only women
lived there, the urinals in the bath
rooms were reportedly made into
flower pots of a sort. During one of
the all-female periods, current
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor made her home there.
Recently, Branner has been home
to its "Branner Presents" speaker se
ries, which brings people from the
campus and beyond to discuss issues
and events. The dorm also puts out a
semi-yearly literary magazine.
Though Branner features two-room
triples today, only two people origi
nally were to be assigned to each set
of rooms.
Florence Moore Hall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall ol l ( )5b.
The dorm made headlines for its in
credible cost, lhe structure with
seven different divisions — Alondra,
C'ardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro,
Mirlo and Paloma — cost over $2.b5
million to build. Of that, over $1 mil
lion was donated by Florence Moore.
Her husband, Robert Moore, joins
her in having a residence named after
him, a row house called Robert S.
Moore South or, more commonly,
Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it cur
