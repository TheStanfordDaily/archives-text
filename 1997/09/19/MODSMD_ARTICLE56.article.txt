# Dorm lives
## Residences boast rich histories 
### Jimmy Boogle Staff writer 
Welcome to Stanford, and wel
come to your new dormitory — your
home for the next nine months. As
you become acquainted with the
campus, you will begin to discover
that there is a lot of history here. Your
dormitory is definitely no exception.
I lete is a brief history of each dor
mitory or house that will be home to
freshmen during this IW7-9K school
year.
Hranner Hall
Branner sucks. Period. That is
how everybody feels, unless you ac
tually live there; it is an unofficial
Stanford rule. Branner is the largest
all-frosh dorm on campus, and every
year, the Brannerites arc generally
known to be the most boisterous, ob
noxious group of frosh on campus.
Their annoying chants at football
games and their annual disruption of
Gaieties, the Big Game week musi
cal, have annoyed other students for
decades.
However, Branner was not always
known for its obnoxiousness. The
dormitory opened in 1924, named
after John Casper Branner, Stan
ford's president from 1913-15. Orig
inally an all-women's dormitory, the
dorm changed between all-male and
all-female several times before even
tually becoming one of the first coed

dorms on campus. When only women
lived there, the urinals in the bath
rooms were reportedly made into
flower pots of a sort. During one of
the all-female periods, current
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor made her home there.
Recently, Branner has been home
to its "Branner Presents" speaker se
ries, which brings people from the
campus and beyond to discuss issues
and events. The dorm also puts out a
semi-yearly literary magazine.
Though Branner features two-room
triples today, only two people origi
nally were to be assigned to each set
of rooms.
Florence Moore Hall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall ol l ( )5b.
The dorm made headlines for its in
credible cost, lhe structure with
seven different divisions — Alondra,
C'ardenal, Faisan, Gavilan, Loro,
Mirlo and Paloma — cost over $2.b5
million to build. Of that, over $1 mil
lion was donated by Florence Moore.
Her husband, Robert Moore, joins
her in having a residence named after
him, a row house called Robert S.
Moore South or, more commonly,
Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it cur
rently is coed. It has been renovated
several times. An improvements pro
ject was completed in 1975, costing
$1.3 million. Housing for about 100
students was also added in the 1975
renovation.
Flo Mo may best be known for two
things. First, it houses the only resi
dential Cultures, Ideas, and Values
(CIV) track: Structured Liberal Edu
cation or SLE. Second, ice cream is
served daily in the dining hall. The
often recounted story is that Florence
Moore gave the money to build the
residence on the condition the dessert
be served every day.
Lagunita Court
The set of dorms, which also
shares its name with Stanford's occa
sionally full artificial lake, was con
structed in 1933. Today it is home to
five different four-class sections:
Adelfa, Eucalipto, Granada, Naranja
and Ujamaa.
Occasionally referred to affec
tionately as "the fire trap," Lagunita
has seen at least one major fire in its
history. The resident fellows' apart
ment in West Lagunita burnt down in
November 1974. The fire, which
caused $ 12,000 in damage, was ruled
to be accidental.
In March of 1976, the Olivo Mag
nolia house, as it was called then,
changed its name to Ujamaa, a
Swahili word meaning "family
hood." Ujamaa is the African-Amer
ican ethnic theme dorm.
Kimball Hall
The newest dorm housing frosh
on campus, the $10.75 million Kim
ball Hall, opened in the fall of 1991.
Kimball Hall is named after
William and Sara Kimball. William
Kimball earned his bachelor's de
gree from Stanford in 1941. After he
served in World War 11, he attended
Harvard, where he earned his MBA.
A successful San Francisco busi
nessman, he was a long-time mem
ber of the Board of Trustees.
The four-class dorm, along with
upper-class dormitories Lantana and
Castaiio, which together make up

Manzanita Park, allowed Stanford to
guarantee all undergraduates four
years of on-campus housing. Today,
Kimball — often referred to as "Hotel
Kimball" because of its newness com
pared to all other frosh dormitories
(the second-newest dormitory hous
ing freshmen opened in 1957) — re
mains one of the most popular resi
dences in the yearly undergraduate
housing draw.
Roble Hall
The oldest active dormitory on
campus, Roble Hall arguably has the
most interesting history of any dorm
on campus.
Roble — which means "oak" in
Spanish — opened in its current lo
cation in 1918 as a women's resi
dence. When it was constructed,
records showed it was built entirely
with reinforced concrete. However,
it was discovered in a 1987 review of
dormitories for earthquake safety
that the records were incorrect.
After discovering that the exterior
walls were made of a hollow clay tile
with a reinforced concrete floor and
frame, Roble was determined to be
the least safe building on campus in
the case of an earthquake.
It was so unsafe, in fact, the Uni
versity decided to close the dormito
ry. On Dec. 19, 1987, it closed its
doors and its residents were relocat
ed when they came back from winter
break. Many of the 294 displaced
students tried to convince the univer
sity to let them stay through the year,
saying they would take their chances.
However, their pleas were to no
avail.
After some discussion Stanford
decided to renovate Roble at a cost of
$7.6 million.
Roble reopened in September
1989 — ironically, just weeks before
the Loma Prieta earthquake. Roble
survived the 7.0 earthquake with no
serious damage. Roble remained a
popular residence following the ren
ovation, as it was the most difficult
dorm to draw into in the 1990 hous
ing draw. However, with the recent
renovations to other dormitories
such as Florence Moore and Wilbur
Hall, its popularity has decreased
sharply in recent years.

Stern Hall
Lucie Stern Hall, the concrete
block of dormitories located on the
eastern portion of campus, opened in
1949. The $1.2 million dormitory
was partially built on money given
by "Aunt" Lucie Stern, a Palo Alto
socialite known for her weekly din
ner parties for Stanford students.
A long-time Stanford benefactor
who was made an honorary member
of the student body in 1941 by the
ASSU, Stern passed away in 1946.
She left a bequest in her will for
$400,000 to build a men's dormitory,
and ultimately another $200,000
from her estate was given to Stanford
to build the dorm that would bear her
name.
Stern Hall's unique, very square
architectural style has been much

maligned since before its opening.
Renovated in 1995, Stern now is the
color of a slightly pale pumpkin. Six
different houses are in Stern: Bur
bank, Donner, Larkin, Serra, Twain
and Casa Zapata, the C'hicano / Lati
no theme dorm Stern is also home to
Lucie's Late Night I'izza, a popular
after-hours Stanford hangout run by
Housing and Dining Services.
Toyon Hall
Toyon Hall opened in 1923. Orig
inally an all-male residence, it cost
$400,000 to construct.
The dormitory is currently a four
class dorm that bears a striking re
semblance to its sister dorm Branner.
Toyon gets its name from a California
evergreen holly tree, which is known
for white flowers and bright-red
berries. Its lounge is a popular place

for campus concerts and events due to
its high ceiling and second floor bal
cony.
In the original plans for Toyon
Hall, a large kitchen and dining room
were to be built in the back of the
building, behind the lounge. Howev
er, this portion of the plans was de
layed due to a lack of funding. The
lounge and kitchen were never built,
which led to the birth of the Toyon
Eating Clubs, located behind Toyon.
Toyon residents and many graduate
students have their meals there.
Wilbur Hall
Wilbur Hall, built in 1956, was
named after Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Wilbur became Stanford's president
in 1916. He retired as president in
1941, but he actually stayed on as
president until 1943 while a replace

ment was found. I le also served as the
Secretary of the Interior under U.S.
President Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
alumnus, from 1929 to 1933.
Wilbur has been known as a
perennially unpopular residence.
However, it gained a new life after
renovation in 1993, rising in draw
popularity as a result. It consists of
eight houses: Arroyo, Cedro, Ju
nipero, Okada, Otero, Rinconada,
Soto and francos.
Some interesting crimes have
been committed at or around Wilbur
over the decades. Arsonists set fire
in Junipcro in both 1971 and 1972.
Also, a statue of Solo, I.eland
Stanford Jr.'s dog that used to play
in the field where Wilbur now
stands, has been stolen from the
Wilbur house of the same name nu
merous times.


Roble Hall awaits Its residents. The dorm, Stanford's oldest residence, was declared unsafe for occupany in 1987. It was closed for reno
vation, but opened in time to ride out the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.
