# New Tresidder facility offers more fitness options

Having feasted on your first cou
ple of delectable Food Service meals
you may wonder how anyone could
gain weight at college. But statistics
say many students are prone to gain
ing the "Freshman 15."
Fear not, young Cardinal, for the
Farm offers plenty — from foot trails
to free weights — to keep you fit.
A good pair of running shoes is all
that's required for a quick jog or walk
around campus, to Palo Alto or up in
the Foothills behind campus. The
Campus Drive loop is approximately
four miles and is a good way to famil
iarize yourself with Stanford's lay
out. The "faculty ghetto" in the
streets branching off Mayfield Av
enue offers quiet roads and pleasant
residential views.
Beyond the "ghetto," to the south
west, lie the Foothills, a favorite des
tination for runners and walkers
alike. You may enter the fenced area
at three points along Junipero Serra
Boulevard: near the intersection of
Campus Drive East, at the intersec
tion of Stanford Avenue or up a dri
veway near the intersection of
Frenchman's Road.
The main paved loop is slightly
more than three miles but there are
plenty of dirt paths there as well if
you wish to lengthen or shorten your
trip. The Dish — Stanford's large
radio telescope — and the Stanford
Solar Observatory are located in the
area, and the hills are home to a vari
ety of wildlife including jackrabbits,
squirrels, moles, snakes, skunks,
foxes, birds and the occasional taran
tula.
Stanford's golf course — at the in

tersection of Campus Drive West and
Junipero Serra — is excellent not
only for golfing but also for jogging.
Its lush rolling hills provide respite
from the hustle and bustle of central
campus. Mondays (when the course
is closed to golfers) are particularly
enjoyable, since you don't have to
dodge golf balls, golf carts and
golfers who have gone astray — but
watch out for the sprinklers.
Lake Lagunita —or Lakebed La
gunita, depending on the season — is
another good place for a stroll. The
circumference is about nine-tenths of
a mile, and the area is particularly en
joyable in spring when the lake is full.
If biking is more your speed, take
a ride around Palo Alto for starters.
For ideas on longer rides, a guide to
local bike paths and rides is available
at the Bookstore or you can contact
the Stanford Cycling Club for ideas.
Oh, and don't forget your helmet.
For those who like to cruise on
more than two wheels the campus has
some idyllic rollerblading venues.
For smooth cruising, try the Quad's
sandstone walkways (but beware of
pedestrians). Avoid the area around
the Clock Tower — it can get very
crowded, especially between classes.
In-line skates can be rented for
about $10 at a number of local stores
such as Palo Alto Sport Shop and Toy
World. For a couple extra bucks, you
can protect yourself with helmets,
knee pads and wrist guards.
If you prefer indoor exercise —
and you will, come January — Stan
ford offers several facilities to non
varsity athletes. There's the relatively
new Arrillaga Family Sports Center
next to Maples Pavilion, equipped
with a huge weight room and basket
ball courts.

You also can use the free weights,
weight machines and exercise bicy
cles at Roble Gym. Stairmasters and
Lifecycles are located in the Ford
Center. Volleyball and basketball
may be played in the adjacent Burn
ham Pavilion.
Another workout center just
opened this fall on the first floor of
Tresidder Union, between the Coffee

House and The Stanford Store. The
center is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on
weekends. Be warned, though, there
are no shower facilities.
Racquetball, handball and squash
courts and outdoor swimming facili
ties are located in the DeGuerre com
plex between the Varsity Tennis Sta
dium and Sunken Diamond on the

northeast side of campus. Roble Pool
is also open fall quarter. Tennis courts
can be found at the corner of Arguello
Way and Serra Street, in Escondido
Village and across from the golf dri
ving range near Governor's Corner.
Intramura! and club sports, in ad
dition to regular Athletics Depart
ment activities, are a way to blend
physical fitness with a social atmos

phere. Classes and intramural sports
vary by quarter, and sign-ups are usu
ally held the day before classes begin.
If you've never seriously exer
cised before, or would like to develop
a structured exercise program, con
tact a physician at Cowell Student
Health Center for advice. Cowell's
nutritionist is also available by ap
pointment.
