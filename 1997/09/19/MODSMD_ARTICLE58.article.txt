## Fulfill a GER, find a major or just have fun with one of these 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
With CIV, Writing and Critical Thinking, general educa
tion requirements and a major or two to fulfill, Stanford fresh
men may think their schedules for the next 12 quarters are al
ready mapped out.
Not so. The point of a liberal arts education is to do a little
experimenting, and many upperclassmen think their best edu
cation — and their most fun — has come in some unique
forms.
Here is a list of some of Stanford's most popular classes,
which can make that quarter of CIV, calculus and chemistry a
little easier to swallow:
Sleep and Dreams (Human Biology 11,3 units). Hardly
anyone at Stanford gets enough zzz's, which is one reason
many students take advantage of this class. Not only do you
learn to analyze your own sleep habits, but PTof. William De
ment designates one side of the auditorium as the "sleeping
section" for tired students.
Human Sexuality (Human Biology 10, 3 units). Hardly
anyone at Stanford gets this either, but Prof. Herant
Katchadourian doesn't designate any part of the auditorium as
a remedy. Nonetheless, this is one of the University's most
popular classes because of Katchadourian's lively teaching
style. Sexual behavior and the relationship of sex and society
are discussed.
Introduction to American Law (American Studies 179,
5 units). Students leam about the basic structure of the Amer
ican legal system and its relationship to American society.
Johnnie Cochran wanna-bes can practice reading and arguing
case law in class.
The Question Course (Center for Teaching and learn
ing 116,3 units). Students leam how to think critically, eval
uate arguments and, as the course title implies, ask questions.
Environmental Science and Technology (Civil Engi
neering 170, 3 units). Popular Prof. Gil Masters lectures on
the environment, its deterioration and how to avoid causing
more damage to Mother Earth.
Visual Thinking (Mechanical Engineering 101,3 units).
This class exercises the mind's eye as students sketch 3-D de
signs and build their own unique contraptions. Take some
foam boards, a mousetrap and a Hershey bar and come back
with a rocket launcher!
Improvising (Drama 103,3 units). Students get to show

off their spontaneity in front of the class as they act without a
script. Hilarious moments are sure to pop up.
Elementary Economics (Economics 1, 5 units). Many
Stanford students say this class was their best experience in the
classroom. Prof. John Taylor is known for his pumpkins,
cameo appearances by his family and a spiritual visitation by
the voice of Adam Smith.
Writing and Reporting the News (Communications 104,
5 units). This small class is popular each quarter. Students are
sent on assignments to cover events and are also given in-class
deadlines. Recently, students pretended the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake had just occurred and were given two hours to sift
through the information in order to write an in-depth story.
Introduction to Psychology (Psychology 1,4 or 5 units).
Stanford's psychology professors are among the leading re
searchers in their field, and they transfer this expertise to the
class through guest lectures on their specialties.
The Psychology of Mind Control (Psychology 164, 5
units, offered 199H-99). If you see students wandering around
in nice suits, minus the pants, chances are they are performing
an experiment for this class. Students leam about hypnosis,
persuasion and the vulnerabilities of target populations, with a
goal of learning to resist such strategies.
Status, Friendship and Social Pressure (Sociology 5, 4
or 5 units,). If you want to know why your ex-lover acted the
way he or she did, ask Prof. Joseph Berger. He introduces stu
dents to many contemporary theories involving romance and
friendship.
Social Dance of North America 1 (Dance 46,1 unit). To
gear up for the popular Ragtime Ball in the fall and the Vien
nese Ball in the winter, students put on their dancing shoes for
this popular class taught by the head of the Dance Department,
Richard Powers. Powers gives his own fancy demonstrations
as he teaches students the fox-trot, swing, tango, two-step and
waltz.
Fiction Writing (English 90,5 units). Interested students
must enter a lottery in order to gain a spot in this class. Those
that do get in say the class is worth it, as they get to exercise
their writing skills and imagination throughout the course.
Introduction to Wilderness Skills (Geological and En
vironmental Sciences 7, 1 unit). Students leam how to live,
travel and work in the wilderness. Topics include animal track
ing, environmental ethics and first aid. Weekend outings allow
students to practice orienteering, ski techniques, caving and
rock climbing.
