## Football earns split, looks to Oregon State Squad seeks redemption for last year's catastrophe in Corvallis 
### Dave Flemming 
October 19 was undoubtedly the
low point of the 19% season for the
Stanford Cardinal.
On that day in Corvallis, Ore., Stan
ford was humiliated by Oregon State,
26-12, in a game that was not as close as
the score indicated.
What made the defeat so hard to
swallow for the Cardinal was that Ore
gon State had carried in an astonishing
15-game losing streak, the longest in
the nation at the time. It had also not de
feated a Pacific 10 Conference oppo
nent since 1994, a string of 12 straight
conference losses.
Tomorrow, Stanford (1-1, 0-0 Pac
-10) will have the chance to atone for
that loss when it faces the Beavers (1-0,
0-0) in Corvallis at 1 p.m. in the Pac-10
opener for both teams.
Stanford is looking to rebound not
only from last year's loss to Oregon
State, but more importantly from a
tough 28-17 loss at No. 6 North Caroli
na last week.
If Stanford needs any motivation for
this game, there are plenty of memories
from last year to urge on the Cardinal.
Begin with the 255 yards rushing
Oregon State amassed last year, versus
only 27 rushing yards for Stanford. Or
the 11 times quarterback Chad
Hutchinson was sacked in the game, an
Oregon State team record. The simple
fact that Stanford is only 6-4 in its last
10 games at Corvallis — against a team
that hasn't had a winning season since
1970 — should be enough to ensure
that the Cardinal doesn't take the
Beavers, who were only 2-9 last year,
lightly.
"This is a must-win situation for us,"
said senior defensive lineman Bryan
Werner.
Indeed, if Stanford wants to be a
contender in the Pac-10 and a national
ly ranked team, this is a game it has to
win. But the Oregon State squad it faces
tomorrow is a much different group
from last year's, returning only 11 of 22
starters.
The biggest change, however, oc
curred when former head coach Jerry
Pettibone resigned at the end of last sea
son and the Beavers hired USC offen
sive coordinator and Corvallis native
Mike Riley.
Riley has abandoned the option
based offense Oregon State employed
for years, making way for what he
hopes to be a more multi-dimensional

attack.
"We've made the transition into a
more balanced offense," Riley said.
"The best way to attack a defense, I
think, is to both run and pass."
Stanford, meanwhile, must prepare
for this balanceJ game plan without a
key member of its defense. Junior free
safety Tim Smith, one of its biggest
playmakers on the defensive side of the
ball, tore the anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee in the closing moments
of the North Carolina game and is out
for the season.
The injury "has huge implications,"
said Stanford head coach Tyrone Will
ingham. "Tim is one of our playmak
ers. [The secondary] is the area we
were concerned about coming into the
season. But you have to rise above
that."
Oregon State's offense revolves
around its quarterback, senior Tim
Alexander, an extremely athletic player
who passed for 207 yards and rushed
for 80 in the Beavers' season-opening
33-7 win over North Texas. Alexander
was previously an option quarterback,
but now is being asked to pass more in
Riley's new scheme.
On the Stanford side, the Cardinal
has played well defensively thus far, but
is seeking more consistency from a unit
that came into the season with so many
expectations placed upon it.
"We've played well in spurts," said
senior linebacker Jon Haskins. "But as
far as playing a total game, we haven't
even come close."
The Cardinal offense has sputtered
in the early season as well. In particu
lar, the running game has struggled,
generating only 43 total yards against
North Carolina.
The running game "hasn't existed
thus far," Willingham said. "We've got
to improve."
But after narrowly losing to a talent
ed Tar Heel squad on the road last week,
Stanford knows it can be a very gotxl
team.
"I hope we're angry (after the loss).
I hope we're upset," Willingham said.
"But I hope we saw we have the ability
to achieve our goals.
"Am I angry? Am I upset? Yeah, I
guess you could say I am an unhappy
camper. I always think 11-0."
While 11-0 is impossible now, Stan
ford can get back on the winning track
this weekend in Corvallis. And ii the
Rose Bowl is still in its future, it is a
game the Cardinal cannot afford to lose.
