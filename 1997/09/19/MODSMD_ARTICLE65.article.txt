# Cardinal beats San Jose State, falls to tough North Carolina
## 
### Dave Flemming 
The Stanford football team began its season at the
extremes ol college football. Not surprisingly, Stan
ford beat lowly San Jose Stale and lost to powerful
North Carolina.
Surprisingly, though, the Cardinal looked more
impressive in defeat than victory. 'I"he uninspired 2K
-12 win over the Spartans was less than spectacular,
while Stanford played sixth ranked North Carolina
extremely close in a 28-1 7 loss in front of a hostile
Tar Heel crowd.
Stanford (I I), which entered the season ranked
17th and with high hopes for a successful season, had
opened with two straight victories only once in the
last ten years. That coveted 2 0 start remained elu
sive after the loss at North Carolina.
The defeat also snapped Stanford's Division I
best six-game winning streak, which dated back to
Oct. 26, 19%.
North Carolina entered the season returning nine
starters from what was the nation's best defense in
19%. Last Saturday, that far Heel defense limited
Stanford to 234 total yards arid made big plays down
the stretch to ruin the Cardinal's upset bid.
Stanford led 17-14 entering the fourth quarter at

Kenan Stadium, and appeared to be in good position
to steal the win before being outscored 14-0 in the
final period.
I'he Tar Heels finally broke open the hard
fought, physical contest late in the fourth quarter. < )n
fourth down with 5:42 left, Stanford was forced to
punt from its own 23-yard line, trailing 21 17. The
snap to senior punter Kevin Miller was slightly off
line, giving backup Tar I leel salety Quinton Savage
time to block the kick.
Freshman salety Antwon Black picked up the
ball at the seven and easily ran it into the end zone for
a Tar Heel touchdown and an insurmountable 28-17
lead.
"("ITie blocked punt) changed everything," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham. "Before
that, we had a chance to go down the field on our next
series and score."
Junior Oscar Davenport, North Carolina's back
up quarterback extraordinaire, put the Tar Heels
ahead for good early in the fourth, tossing a spectac
ular 15-yard touchdown pass to wideout Octavus
Barnes.
Davenport relieved ineffective senior starter
Chris Keldorf and tormented Stanford all evening,
completing 12 of 14 passes for 116 yards and two

touchdowns. I le also made several key runs through
out the game.
Stanford's missed opportunities in the third quar
ter set up Davenport's heroics. The Cardinal tied the
game on a five-yard scramble by redshirt sopho
more quarterback ( had Hutchinson with 7:2(> to go
in the third.
The Cardinal got the ball back on the ensuing
kickofl when returner Domonique Williams fum
bled at the 15-yard line. Hut Stanford could only
manage a field goal to make the score 17-14.
North Carolina fumbled again on its next posses
sion, giving Stanford the ball on the Tar I feci 2X. Hut
three plays did not net a first down, and Miller
missed a 40-yard field goal.
Stanford's chances came despite a first half dom
inated by North Carolina. The Cardinal rushed for
minus-11 yards during the lirst two periods and was
oulgaincd 20ft yards to 41.
Stanford actually struck first in the game, scoring
on an 11 -yard pass from I lutchinson to fullback Jon
Ritchie five minutes into the contest. The play was
set up by a spectacular 52- yard punt return by emerg
ing star Troy Walters. The touchdown gave Stanford

a 7-0 lead, and the Cardinal had the
early momentum.
Five offsides penalties plagued
Stanford, four coming on a 99-yard
North Carolina scoring drive that tied
the game 7-7. Stanford did not earn an
other first down in the half, and the Tar
Heels scored again to take a 14-7 half
time lead.
Those missed opportunities left the
score 17-14 going into the fourth quar
ter, setting up Davenport's heroics and
the blocked punt that sealed Stanford's
fate.
Stanford 28,
San Jose State 12
Stanford did not impress in a sea
son-opening win over San Jose State
on Sept. 6.
The Spartans, ranked 111 out of 112
Division 1 teams by Sports Illustrated,
were in the game until Cardinal senior
linebacker Jon Haskins returned an in
terception 22 yards for a touchdown
late in the fourth quarter.

With 3:30 remaining in the game,
San Jose State had the ball, having nar
rowed Stanford's lead to 21-12, before
Haskins ended the threat.
For Stanford, the game was filled
with mistakes and missed opportuni
ties. Miller missed his only two field
goal tries, from the makeable distances
of 21 and 35 yards. Stanford was also
penalized 11 times for 101 yards, the
most of the Tyrone Willingham era. In
addition, Hutchinson was sacked four
times.
There was no score until nearly five
minutes had elapsed in the second
quarter, when Stanford scored on a
two-yard run by senior fullback Greg
Cornelia. The scoring drive was
sparked by Cornelia's 32-yard run on a
fourth-down play.
The Cardinal got in the end zone
again on its next series, this time on a
pass from Hutchinson to senior tight
end Tommy Hanson. The score re
mained 14-0 at halftime.
Hutchinson finished his solid day
with the second 300-yard passing per
formance of his career. He completed IS
of 36 attempts for 302 yards and a touch
down. He was also intercepted twice.

After halftime, Stanford scored on a
21-yard reverse by senior wide receiv
er Damon Dunn with 2:31 left in the
third quarter. It was the fourth time in
five career reverse attempts that Dunn
has scored a touchdown. With the
score 21-0, Stanford finally looked as if
it would put away the undermatched
Spartans.
But San Jose State made the game
interesting. Less than two minutes into
the second quarter, Spartan junior re
ceiver Oliver Newell beat cornerback
Johnson for a 50-yard touchdown re
ception to cut into the Stanford lead.
Minutes later, after Hutchinson had
thrown an interception on the Stanford
36-yard line, San Jose State quarter
back Brian Vye ran into the end zone
himself and made it 21-12.
Perhaps the biggest highlight for the
Cardinal was the play of junior flanker
Troy Walters. Walters tied his career
high with eight catches and set a new
high with 166 yards.
"No. 1 and most important," said
Willingham after the game, "is we got
the win, despite the fact that we didn't
play the kind of ball we should have."
