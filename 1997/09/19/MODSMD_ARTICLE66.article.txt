# Major setback for defense
## Smith tears ACL, out for the year 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Junior free safety Tim Smith will undergo surgery and
miss the rest of the season with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee.
The loss is a big setback for a Cardinal team that had
an inexperienced secondary to begin the season. The fact
that it comes right before the team's Pacific 10 Confer
ence opener tomorrow at Oregon State only compounds
the problem.
Smith injured the leg in last week's 28-17 loss to
North Carolina. He has four tackles and two pass break
ups so far this year.
The Cardinal must now juggle its thin secondary and
shake up a defense that has been inconsistent thus far. Ac
cording to head coach Tyrone Willingham, the most like
ly move Saturday is to move starting cornerback Alistair
White to safety and start junior Chris Johnson at corncr
back.
Last season, Smith emerged as a backup to Josh Mad
sen and eventually won the starting role. He led the team
with four interceptions and also contributed 2H tackles
(three for a loss), three sacks, a forced fumble and a
blocked kick.
"You have Tim Smith, who was one of our playmak
ers. He was counted on for... leadership," Willingham
said. "But like any other team that wants to be successful,
you have to rise above that because at some point during
the season you're going to lose someone who's important
to your football team."
Despite the loss, Willingham feels that reserves will
be able to fill the gap. Johnson and junior Frank Primus
both saw extensive play in the season opener against San
Jose State.
"Initially, it looked like our whole secondary was in
dismay," said senior linebacker Jon Haskins. "But I think
we've got some guys who could step up. We're not going
in with some totally fresh guys. We'll be all right."
