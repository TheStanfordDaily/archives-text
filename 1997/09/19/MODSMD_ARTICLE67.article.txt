# Willingham inks restructured deal to stay long term
## 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Head coach Tyrone Willingham
re-emphasized his commitment to
the Stanford football program by
agreeing to a restructured contract on
Sept. 9, ending speculation that he
might soon leave for a more lucrative
offer from the NFL
Willingham said the new contract
has taken him "off the market."
"Because of the way things are
shuctured, it will allow me and the
coaches on our staff to feel like there
is a real commitment to not only I y
rone Willingham, but to the Stanford
football program," he said. "I think
that if I am comfortable and the uni
versity is comfortable, that elimi
nates some of |the media's| spolia
tion."
Kxact terms of the contract were
not released, but it will still run
through 2001 and has been enhanced
with incentives that would reward
Willingham should the team be suc
cessful.
Though there is no clause in the
agreement which binds Willingham
to the University, he believes that the
commitment Stanford has shown
will help him remain on the Farm.
'There is |a guarantee to stay],
but it's not on paper, and all of life is
not always on paper," Willingham
said. "I think that we joined in today
as a joint commitment to make this
program the things that the Universi
ty wants and the things that I want. I
believe in the best interests of the in
stitution and the best interests of the
young people involved in the pro
urarn."

Willingham also said that he feels
this contract will impress the
school's pledge to excel in football
upon all facets of the program.
"I think it's exciting to our new
recruits out in the country that are
looking at Stanford and wanted to
say, 'What will the program be
shaped like?' I think they have a
clear definition of what our program
will be shaped like," he said. "I think
it's important to the young men in
our program to know that I will be
their head coach because I made that
a commitment when I sal in their liv
ing rooms."
Athletic director l t d I .eland feels
that with Willingham fully commit
ted to Stanford's football program, it
will be easier to move tfie team in a
winning direction.
"I think in order to [succeed| in
the sport of football here at Stanford,
we have felt that stability in the pro
gram is of critical importance," Le
land said. "The other tiling we're
looking for is to make sure we have
the light person in the job given the
nature of our program, which has
first and foremost an educational im
perative, and secondly a desire to be
as good as we can be and to win and
to be a top 10 program. We don't be
lieve those two goals are mutually
exclusive, especially i! we have the
right leadership."
Willingham has proven himself to
be an able coach in his first two years
on the F arm. He has led the team to
consecutive bowl appearances, in
eluding a "W O rout of Michigan State
in the Sun Bowl last season.
Despite a dismal 2 5 start last sea
son, Willingham was able to turn the

team around with a five-game win
streak and a sweep of the three major
California schools.
This year (he team, currently
ranked 24th after last week's 2K-I7
Joss to North Carolina, faces its
biggest opportunity under Willing
ham's tutelage. With a bye against
Pacific 10 Conference favorite
Washington, Rose Howl talk is in the
air. Since the Huskies have gone to
the Rose Howl as recently as IW3,
the Cardinal must simply tic their
record in order to make it to Pasade
na next lanuary.
The University initiated talks
with Willingham hist August when it
became evident that his status as a
coach was rising sharply.
"I think that through maybe offi
cial and unofficial sources it became
evident to us that a lot ol people were
interested in lytone," I .eland said,
"so we fell that we had to be proac
tive and make sure that the support
for the football program was at a
level that made I yrone comfortable
given the fact we'd have to be awlul
ly naive to think thai Tyrone wasn't
going to be hot property. I think
that's the impetus lor what got us to
where we are today.
"We're committed to playing big
time football in the l'ac-l() Confer
ence and being successlul and we
know that takes some financial re
sources. We're very excited that
we've been able to announce today a
renewed commitment to Stanford
football and I think a renewed com
mitment to I'vrone Willingham,
whom I think is the best person we
could possibly have to lead this pro
gram."
