# VOLLEYBALL
## Women's volleyball chasing repeat, history 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
History — that upper tier of sports im
mortality that kids dream about while
shooting hoops in their driveways or
playing catch at recess. It's that swing of
the bat in Game 7 of the World Series, it's
catching the winning touchdown pass on
fourth-and-long or nailing that last-sec
ond jumper in OT — it's that phenome
non that changes mere athletes into he
roes and turns a program into a dynasty.
It's also the fact that in women's col
lege volleyball, no individual player has
ever won three NCAA championships
and no program has ever won four. And
it's the opportunity that Stanford's five
seniors and the rest of the women's vol
leyball team have to write themselves
into history.

A repeat as national champions would
give seniors Lisa Sharpley, Kristin Folkl,
Barbara Ifejika, Debbie Lambert and
Paula McNamee three national titles in
their college careers. It would also give
Stanford its fourth.
So receiving that accolade must be the
foremost thing on the Cardinal's collec
tive mind, right?
Well, not exactly.
"It's definitely a motivation, but it's
not on the forefront of our minds," Ifejika
said. "It's not really what I'm thinking
about. It's just about winning — winning
the Pac- l()s again and winning a national
title and being able to sustain that intensi
ty coming off a national championship
season."
With five returning starters and five
new freshmen, the chances for a repeal
sound good, but right now Stanford is

more likely concentrating on getting over
injuries and getting the freshmen adjusted
to the college level.
"This preseason has been very odd,"
Folkl said. "And 1 think that's primarily
due to injuries. There's definitely a lack
of intensity in practice, and I attribute that
to not having everyone healthy. Plus, it's
been extreme this year having five new
freshmen."
Another reason why the Cardinal may
be so business-like rather than relishing in
the possibilities the future may hold has a
little to do with history itself. When
Sharpley, Folkl and company were fresh
men, the Cardinal won its second nation
al championship in three years.
I"he following season, Stanford was a
favorite to repeat and then-seniors Mamie

Senior Kristin Foikl brings down the hammer in the Cardinal's match
against Penn State on Aug. 23. Penn State won 15-8, 15-13, 15-9 to
displace the Cardinal as the nation's top-ranked team.
Tricfcnhach, Wendy Hromadka, Mau
reen Mclaren and Wendell had the
chance to do what this year's seniors hope
to accomplish. But Texas defeated Stan
ford in the national semifinal, ending the
Cardinal's repeat run.
"That's definitely been hanging over
our heads," said of the loss in
1995. "I'm ready to win back-to-back,
but we have a long way to go if we want
to make it."
Hut rest assured, Lambert and her co
horts learned from that experience her
sophomore season and not only know ex
actly what it will lake to make it, but will
do everything in their power to get there.
"This year it's totally different,"
Sharpley said. "That year we found out
what happens when you don't put every
thing into it. I don't see it being as crush
ing [if we don't win this year] bccausc we
are putting so much into it. We're not
happy with anything less than that."
Indeed, winning a national title has
become something of an everyday occur
rence on the Farm. (Okay, more like once

or twice a quarter.) But the fact is, the
women's volleyball program has
asserted itself as the team to beat in the
'90s. Winning the national title never
seems to be out of the question, and the
Final Four has almost become an annual
event for Cardinal fans.
"Winning the Pac-l()s is always a
goal," said head coach Don Shaw. "The
other one is to win the national champi
onship. At the end we want to look and
see: did we do everything to give our
selves the chance? Then if we don t win,
it's because someone else played bet
ter."
But by and large it's been the Cardi
nal that has played better year after year,
and with this year's core of seniors lead
ing the way there's a gmxl chance for a
repeat.
"That will be a nice thing to sit down
and l(X)k at once it's over, if it happens,"
Shaw said. "It's a nice motivation for
them. W hen they put in the work day to
day, the result is a gtxxJ one, and they
know better than anyone how much hard
work pays off."
If Shaw is right about this year's
team, you can bet this will be one year
when history is made, not repeated.
