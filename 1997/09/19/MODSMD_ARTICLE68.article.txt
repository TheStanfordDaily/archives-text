# VOLLEYBALL
## Women's volleyball chasing repeat, history 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
History — that upper tier of sports im
mortality that kids dream about while
shooting hoops in their driveways or
playing catch at recess. It's that swing of
the bat in Game 7 of the World Series, it's
catching the winning touchdown pass on
fourth-and-long or nailing that last-sec
ond jumper in OT — it's that phenome
non that changes mere athletes into he
roes and turns a program into a dynasty.
It's also the fact that in women's col
lege volleyball, no individual player has
ever won three NCAA championships
and no program has ever won four. And
it's the opportunity that Stanford's five
seniors and the rest of the women's vol
leyball team have to write themselves
into history.

A repeat as national champions would
give seniors Lisa Sharpley, Kristin Folkl,
Barbara Ifejika, Debbie Lambert and
Paula McNamee three national titles in
their college careers. It would also give
Stanford its fourth.
So receiving that accolade must be the
foremost thing on the Cardinal's collec
tive mind, right?
Well, not exactly.
"It's definitely a motivation, but it's
not on the forefront of our minds," Ifejika
said. "It's not really what I'm thinking
about. It's just about winning — winning
the Pac- l()s again and winning a national
title and being able to sustain that intensi
ty coming off a national championship
season."
With five returning starters and five
new freshmen, the chances for a repeal
sound good, but right now Stanford is

more likely concentrating on getting over
injuries and getting the freshmen adjusted
to the college level.
"This preseason has been very odd,"
Folkl said. "And 1 think that's primarily
due to injuries. There's definitely a lack
of intensity in practice, and I attribute that
to not having everyone healthy. Plus, it's
been extreme this year having five new
freshmen."
Another reason why the Cardinal may
be so business-like rather than relishing in
the possibilities the future may hold has a
little to do with history itself. When
Sharpley, Folkl and company were fresh
men, the Cardinal won its second nation
al championship in three years.

Senior Kristin Foikl brings down the hammer in the Cardinal's match
against Penn State on Aug. 23. Penn State won 15-8, 15-13, 15-9 to
displace the Cardinal as the nation's top-ranked team.
