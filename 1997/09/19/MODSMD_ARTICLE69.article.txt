# Maples to host Sooners tonight
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
After a grueling two-week road
trip to the East Coast and the Pacif
ic 10 Conference opener against
California Tuesday night, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team
(8 2, 1-0 Pac-10) returns to the
Maples hardwood tonight against
Oklahoma (6-3).
The 7 p.m. match against the
Sooners is the nightcap of the two
day Stanford Showcase, which
features 20th-ranked Colorado (4-
1) and No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara (9-
0) in the 5 p.m. opener. Stanford
will play the Buffaloes tomorrow,
and UCSB will face Oklahoma.
The Showcase is "shaping up
better than we originally had
planned," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "Oklahoma's got al
most everybody back from last
year, and Colorado had a young
team that's a year older now. Santa
Barbara is always good too. It'll be
two good matches both nights."
For the Cardinal it's the chance
to start a new home-court win
streak. Stanford's last match at
Maples was a three-game loss to
then-No. 2 Penn State Aug. 23. The loss
ended a 50-match win streak at Maples,
the fourth longest in NCAA history, and
bumped the Cardinal out of the nation's
top ranking. But after limping into a two
week road trip after the Penn State loss,
the injury-plagued Stanford squad is
probably happy to return to the Farm.
The Sooners, on the other hand,
would probably be just as happy to play
somewhere else. In its 22 years of exis
tence, the Oklahoma volleyball program
has only made two trips to the NCAA
tournament (1987 and 1988), and last
season the Sooners finished seventh in
the Big 12 with an 8-12 conference
record.

Bui despite the fact that Oklahoma
hasn't been to the NCAA tournament in
10 years — the same tournament that
Stanford has won three of the last five
years — everyone involved with the
Sooner program says that Oklahoma is
ready to go to the next level. Last spring
the Sooners posted wins over UCSB,
Texas and UCLA, and this season they
add two top freshmen to an experienced
team.
Oklahoma freshman middle blockers
Danielle Cornelius and Holly McMillan
are strong and dynamic players and are
expected to make big contributions for
the Sooners, hopefully relieving some of
the offensive pressure felt by the left
side. That's where the majority of the
Sooner offense will come from, as se
niors Patrice Arrington, Kim Coffey and
Melissa Peterson will rotate as outside

hitters.
Tomorrow's match against Colorado
should provide a little more excitement
for Maples-goers. Overall, the Buffaloes
were 19-10 last season, finishing fourth
in the Big 12 (13-7) and advancing to the
second round of the NCAA tournament
before losing to eventual runner-up
Hawaii.
Colorado returns five starters from
that squad and began the preseason with
a top-25 ranking. The Buffaloes also re
turn sophomore setter Kelly Campbell,
who finished third in the nation in assists
per game last season. Stanford senior
Lisa Sharpley, a two-time All-American
and arguably the best setter in the coun
try, was 11th in that category but has
been sidelined for most of this season
with a knee injury.
"She' s getting better, but she's not all

the way back yet," Shaw said of Sharp
ley. "In the last match against Penn
State, I played her one game and then
pulled her out because I didn't want to
overdo it."
Other notables for Colorado are ju
nior outside hitter Sarah Lodge, who
posted 416 kills last season, and middle
blocker Alison Koepke, the Buffaloes'
lone senior and Colorado's fourth all
time leading blocker.
The Buffaloes have had more suc
cess in the postseason than their Big 12
counterpart, making an appearance in
the NCAA tournament in six of the last
seven seasons.
"We want it to be a good show for
women's volleyball," Shaw said.
"We're in better shape now than in the
beginning of the preseason, and I think
we'll see that this weekend."
