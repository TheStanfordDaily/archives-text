# Card stumbles from top spot, starts 8-2
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The early goings of the the 1997 sea
son have been anything but typical for
the 4th-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team.
The Cardinal entered the season hav
ing won 49 straight matches at Maples
Pavilion. A 12-15,15-9,15-11,15-9 win
over Texas A&M Aug. 22 in the first
round of the State Farm Classic
stretched that streak to 50, the fourth
longest in NCAA history, and Stanford
looked poised to set the record for

longest home-court winning streak on
Nov. 2 against USC.
The Cardinal also began the season
as the nation's No. 1 team and every
body's pick to repeat. Sounds typical so
far, but little known to the rest of the
world was the fact that Stanford was suf
fering from an injury bug the size of
Texas cockroaches. The injury-plagued
squad had very limited practices, and the
preseason training was not as intense as
head coach Don Shaw would have liked.
Enter Penn State. Just two matches
into the Cardinal's season, then-No. 2
Penn State walked out of Maples with a

15-8, 15-13,15-9 victory in the finals of
the State Farm Classic, a win that put the
Nittany Lions in the nation's top spot for
the first time in that program's history.
Suddenly, it's the end of the win
streak and the submission of the No. 1
ranking. Penn State is the fat cat in
women's volleyball, and life on the
Farm isn't as rosy as we were expecting
it to be. Senior setter and team co-cap
tain Lisa Sharpley is on the sidelines
with a knee injury, and sophomore out
side hitter Kerri Walsh is serving left
handed rather than pelting those jump
serves we're so used to seeing because
of a shoulder problem.
But trophies aren't handed out until
December, and holding the nation's top
ranking all season wouldn't be much of
a consolation prize for the loser.
"I think Penn State is a very good
team," said senior middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika. "They're definitely head
and shoulders above us at this point in
the season. We have a very long way to
go, which is a great eye-opener, espe
cially this early."
After a pair of straight-game victo
ries over Nevada and Sacramento State,

the Card headed east for a potential re
match with Penn State at the IKON
Husky Invitational on Sept. 5-6, but first
Stanford had to get past Missouri and
Connecticut.
Neither could slow the Cardinal.
Both fell in straight games, and against
Connecticut Sharpley got back into the
action for the first time since the Penn
State loss, putting up 13 assists in just
one game. Freshman Lindsay Kagawa
guided the Cardinal offense through the
other two games with 25 assists.
That led to the rematch. Again, Penn
State was able to snare the victory, but
this time the match was much closer, a
14-16, 15-6, 15-12, 15-7 loss. Folk! led
all hitters with a career-high 39 kills, but
Penn State proved to be overpowering.
"The preseason has been hard be

cause we've been plagued by injuries,"
Folkl said. "Sharpley's first complete
match was [against Duke and Walsh]
still hasn't swung full speed. But the in
tensity in practice has picked up. I feel
like we've come a long way, but we still
have a long way to go. We're just getting
to where we wanted to be."
In the Pacific 10 Conference opener
at Cal Tuesday, Stanford rolled in
straight games.
"We're getting better with a new
look to the team," Shaw said. "Anytime
you lose three seniors and you insert five
freshmen, it's going to be a new look.
They were very hard workers, tough
competitors, and brought experience to
the team. But the freshman have done
great things for us so far."
