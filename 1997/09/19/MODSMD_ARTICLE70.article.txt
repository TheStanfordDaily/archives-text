The early goings of the the 1997 sea
son have been anything but typical for
the 4th-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team.
The Cardinal entered the season hav
ing won 49 straight matches at Maples
Pavilion. A 12-15,15-9,15-11,15-9 win
over Texas A&M Aug. 22 in the first
round of the State Farm Classic
stretched that streak to 50, the fourth
longest in NCAA history, and Stanford
looked poised to set the record for

longest home-court winning streak on
Nov. 2 against USC.
The Cardinal also began the season
as the nation's No. 1 team and every
body's pick to repeat. Sounds typical so
far, but little known to the rest of the
world was the fact that Stanford was suf
fering from an injury bug the size of
Texas cockroaches. The injury-plagued
squad had very limited practices, and the
preseason training was not as intense as
head coach Don Shaw would have liked.
Enter Penn State. Just two matches
into the Cardinal's season, then-No. 2
Penn State walked out of Maples with a

15-8, 15-13,15-9 victory in the finals of
the State Farm Classic, a win that put the
Nittany Lions in the nation's top spot for
the first time in that program's history.
Suddenly, it's the end of the win
streak and the submission of the No. 1
ranking. Penn State is the fat cat in
women's volleyball, and life on the
Farm isn't as rosy as we were expecting
it to be. Senior setter and team co-cap
tain Lisa Sharpley is on the sidelines
with a knee injury, and sophomore out
side hitter Kerri Walsh is serving left
