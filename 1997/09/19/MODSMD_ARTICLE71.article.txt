# Freshmen step in amid great expectations for 1997 season
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
There are a lot of things that go into the
making of a championship program — tal
ented players, good coaching, perhaps
even a little luck.
But at the top of that list is gcxxl re
cruiting, and that's an area that the Stan
ford women's volleyball program has al
ways excelled in.
Currently on the court for the Cardinal
are two former national freshmen of the
year, sophomore outside hitter Kerri
Walsh and senior co-captain Kristin Folkl.
Folkl was dubbed Volleyball Maga
zine's recruit of the decade when she
signed to play on the Farm in 1994. Ac
companying her in that class were fellow
seniors I.isa Sharpley, named the nation's
No. 2 recruit behind Folkl, and middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika, labeled Canada's
top high sch(x)l player.
season Walsh headlined a fresh
man class that probably could have made a
huge impact anywhere, except maybe at
the school that had gotten one of the best
recruiting classes ever just two years prior.
Walsh's classmates on the court include
outside hitters Sarah Clark and Jaimi Gre
gory, who spent most of last season com
peting for time with the likes of Folkl,
Walsh and senior outside hitter Debbie

Lambert and l<x>k to do much of the same
this year. Those two groups would be
tough acts to follow for any class, but with
the standard of excellence set in recent
yeans by Stanford volleyball and the quest
for back-to-back national championships
so prevalent, the five new faces on the
court have some pretty big shoes to fill.
"As a whole I think they're doing
well," Folkl said of her freshmen team
mates. "It's tough to come into a top notch
program, but they've all contributed in
some way. It's a good class."
Here's exactly who makes up the
freshman five: first there's Jennifer Det
mcr, a 6- foot-3 m idd le blocker from Thou
sand Oaks, Calif. Detmer will likely see
the most time, as she and senior Paula Mc-
Namee are sharing time Rt the spot vacated
by departed All-Amcrican Eileen Murfee.
Detmer was All-Section as a senior at
Ihousand Oaks High and was also an All-
State selection in basketball.
"She's going to be a great blocker,"
said head coach Don Shaw. "She's a gtxxl
athlete, and she's got good size. She's got
all the tools to be a great volleyball player."
One freshman who's getting more time
on the court than she was expecting is 5-9
setter lindsay Kagawa. Kagawa's role
was supposed to be as a back-up setter to
Sharplcy. Hut after a knee injury sidelined
Sharpley, Kagawa was asked to step into a

starting role on several occasions.
Also affected by the knee injury to
Sharpley is Robyn Lewis. Shaw was plan
ning to redshirt the 5-10 setter this year, but
with Sharpley questionable during the pre
season, so was the status of Lewis's eligi
bility.
"I was intending to redshirt her this sea
son," Shaw said. With Sharpley and Ka
gawa playing ahead of Ixwis, "we'd be
wasting a year of her eligibility. But she's
a great player. If Sharpley doesn't heal, she
won't redshirt."
Rounding out the freshman class are
Alex Newell and Monica Sergott. Newell
Ls a 6-1 walk-on from London, England,
and eould see time at both middle blocker
and outside hitter. Sergott, also a walk-on,
will play primarily as a defensive special
ist in the back row but also adds depth at
setter.
"They've already made an impact,"
Lambert said. '"Ihey're contributing right
off the bat. It's not a really dominating
class like ours was with three starters, but
they add a lot of depth."
One of the first priorities for the five
new faces will be getting adjusted to the
differences at the college level as well as
living up to the standard of Cardinal vol
leyball.
