# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Tough start slows Cardinal 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
For the No. 16 Stanford women's soccer
team, the notion of easing into the season slow
ly evaporated with the first wisps of fall.
Against some of the country's toughest oppo
nents, Stanford jolted and bumped to a 3-2
record in the first three weeks of the season.
The Cardinal finished on a streak in last
year's Pacific 10 Conference championship
season, and Coach Steve Swanson's goal for
this year was "to try to continue that run into
this season."

Despite a tough 1-0 overtime loss last Sun
day at the hands of Southern Methodist in the
Clemson Classic Tournament in South Caroli
na, Swanson thinks the momentum still swings
the Card's way.
"Our chemistry has been tremendous. Our
other strengths are our conditioning and the
way we play together as a team," he said.
Against SMU, the Cardinal controlled most
of the game, but was unable to score despite
outshooting the Mustangs, 12-5. After one
overtime period, the game remained scoreless.
But with six minutes remaining in the second
overtime, SMU's Mary Anne Means pelted a

ball from 28 yards out that sailed over goal
keeper Erin Bryla's head.
Swanson, eternal optimist, put a positive
spin on the loss.
"The loss was a good lesson for us," he said.
"We have to put away our chances. Hopefully
we can take away something from this."
The Cardinal was still on a high from a 2-1
tournament-opening victory against No. 11
Clemson two days earlier. Stanford opened the
season in the Lone Star State with a 2-0 victory
over Texas on Aug. 31. Two days later, follow-

ing an 80-minute lightning delay, the
Cardinal fell to No. 8 Texas A&M, 2-
1.
In the home opener against St.
Mary's on Sept. 7, Stanford opened
up the floodgates to win, 5-0. The
Cardinal outshot the Gaels 26-2 and
scored four first-half goals.
Swanson thinks his team is poised
to take on the rest of the season.
"I think our team has come a long
way in a short time," he said. "This is
a young squad with a ton of poten
tial."
