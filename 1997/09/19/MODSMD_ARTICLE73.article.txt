## Despite losses, women's soccer strives for repeat NCAA Tournament berth

At this time last year, new coach Steve
Swanson had inherited a disheveled team
â€” one ripe for a rebuilding year. But 11
weeks later, the team had surprisingly won
six of its last seven games to become the
Pacific 10 Conference champions.
So this year, with a tumultuous season
behind them, expectations for Swanson
