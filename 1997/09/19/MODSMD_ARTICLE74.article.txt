The Stanford women's soccer team, nurs
ing fresh wounds from last weekend's 1-1
showing in a tournament in Clemson, South
Carolina, returns home this weekend for the
Stanford / Nike Invitational.
On newly inaugurated Maloney Field,
Stanford (3-2) has faced but one opponent:
Saint Mary's, which fell to the Cardinal 5-0
two weeks ago. This afternoon Stanford faces
New Mexico at 5 p.m., following a 3 p.m.
game between San Francisco and Wake For
est.
Sunday, Stanford meets No. 15 Wake For
est at 1 p.m.

Coach Steve Swanson emphasized the im
portance of this weekend's games to keep the
team on track.
"We beat Clemson [last weekend], and we
played well against SMU despite the loss," he
said. "But we've got to get things rolling
here."
Today's game against New Mexico (4-1)
"is critical, especially coming on the heels of
the SMU game," Swanson said. "It's critical
in terms of starting going again."
Getting in tune against New Mexico is im
portant, especially with Sunday's game pitting
the Cardinal against a highly ranked opponent.
Stanford, ranked no. 16, is 1-1 this year in
