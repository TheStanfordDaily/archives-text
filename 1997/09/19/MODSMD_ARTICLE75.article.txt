# MEN'S SOCCER
## Soccer hangs season on teamwork, defense 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark says the
key to a successful soccer season is teamwork.
If early games are any indication, 1997 should
be successful indeed for the 15th-ranked Cardi
nal.
The team (5-0-0) has already blazed its way
to a perfect record and extended the school
record for longest winning streak to 10 games.
Many of the true challenges of the season
are yet to come, Clark said, starting with the
Cardinal's match today against Wisconsin, the
defending national champions. I"he game, a
part of the St. Mary's Tournament, is scheduled
to begin at 2 p.m.
Beating a recent national champion is not
easy, Clark said. He added that he has his own
incentive to win the match: In his previous pt>-
sition as coach at Dartmouth College, Clark
met Wisconsin once before — and lost.
"We're looking forward to the game," he
said of his Stanford squad. "I think it's a new
opportunity to stake a claim" as a strong team.
Sunday, in the second part of the St. Mary's
Tournament, the Cardinal will meet UC-lrvine, a
team Stanford squeaked past in a meeting last year.

"Both will be difficult games," Clark said,
"but as 1 said to the team, if we do our stuff
properly, 1 don't think we need to fear any
team."
That attitude may come in handy as the team
plows through a tough set of games. Meetings
are scheduled later in the season with Wash
ington, Dartmouth and Harvard, among others.
Washington was ranked ninth nationally as of
Sept. 8, while another upcoming Cardinal op
ponent, Indiana, is No. 1.
Clark has been emphasizing to his players
that nothing will stop them if they work togeth
er.
"We put a huge emphasis on being a team,"
Clark said. "We talk about how everyone in the
squad is important and every role is important."
How the last player on the squad practices
will affect the rest of the team, all the way up to
the starters. "It's a chain reaction," Clark said,
"and 1 think we have a tremendous commit
ment from everyone on the team."
The players' commitment — something
Clark thinks is greater at Stanford than it might
be elsewhere due to student motivation — will
go a long way toward making men's soccer a
better-known and better-respected sport among
Stanford's star teams, he said.

As the team builds, other Cardinal athletes
act as role models. "Stanford being an Athlet
ics Department like the Stanford Athletics De
partment, you're surrounded by a lot of very
motivated athletes," he said. Soccer team
members "don't have to look very hard for
other role models."
Right now, Clark said, his team "still has
something to do to catch up with other teams."
"But 1 think that's nice," he added. "That's
one of the incentives — when you see the
other Stanford teams having been successful
on a national level."
Further motivation is provided by the fans,
and Clark said he expects to get bigger crowds
during home games this year, in part due to the
efforts of Bill Scott, a volunteer coach on sab
batical from Philips Academy in Andover for
a year.
Scott is a longtime friend of Clark and has
"taken it on himself to be a community rela
tions man," Clark said. "He's doing a great job
in drumming up interest in the Palo Alto and
Stanford area."
About 350 people attended the home open
er against Chico State on Monday, and Clark
expects that number to grow past 1 ,(XX) during
the season.
