# 15th-ranked Cardinal rolls to undefeated mark, record streak
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team has started its season in
high form — with 11 goals, five wins and one school record.
The 15th-ranked Cardinal's 5-0-0 record extends the
team's winning streak to 10 games, dating back to last sea
son. That breaks the record of nine consecutive victories set
in 1980-81.
"We're very happy," said head coach Bobby Clark.
But he cautioned that the team can't become complacent
if it is looking for continued success. "Obviously, the sea
son's got a ways to go, so 1 don't think we (should) get
overexcited. But it's always great to get off to a good start."

In five games, the Cardinal has allowed only two goals,
in large part due to the efforts of freshman goalkeeper Adam
Zapala. One of those goals came in a 2-1 win over San Jose
State in the season opener. The only other goal scored by a
opponent came Monday during a 3-1 win over Chico State
at New Maloney Field.
Chico State shouldn't have gotten on the scoreboard,
Clark said, but that complacency slipped in after Stanford
earned its third goal — one of several "lapses" Clark said
he's observed in his team's play.
"We've actually won the five opening games, but I don't
think we've played to our potential, not for 90 minutes of
any of the games so far," he said.
Stanford came alive in the second half of its season open

er to beat San Jose State, using a tighter defense and a more
aggressive offense to erase a 1 -0 Spartan lead.
In the opening round of the Coors l.ighl Classic in Las
Vegas on Sept. 5, the Cardinal posted its biggest blowout of
the season, a 4-0 victory over Cal State-Northridge. Junior
co-captain A.J. Sauer delivered two of the four goals that
paid back the Matadors for their victory over Stanford last
year.
Three days later, Stanford concluded the tournament on a
high note with a 1-0 win over UNI.V. Again, Sauer took con
trol mi offense, scoring the match's only goal in the 80th
minute. His efforts earned him Player of the Week honors in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
Joining Sauer as early standouts on the team are two

freshmen, Zapala and forward Corey Woolfolk. Woolfolk.
who was named "Mr. Soccer" in Michigan as a high
school senior, has been active in scoring and assisting
goals.
Clark said he is excited about this year's recruits, which
also include transfer Simon Elliott, a junior who had attend
ed Victoria University in New Zealand. "When you get a
transfer, you expect him to make a contribution," Clark ex
plained. "And he certainly has. We'll still see the best of
Simon."
Elliott scored the lone goal in the Cardinal's win over
UC-Santa Barbara last Saturday. Zapala also continued his
stellar play in that game, lowering his goals-against average
to .25/ game.
