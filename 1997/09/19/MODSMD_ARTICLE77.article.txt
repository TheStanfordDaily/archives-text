LOS ANGELES - How perfectly fitting that up 3-0,
with four grueling three-set matches in progress, it was
Stanford senior Grant Elliott who delivered the Cardinal a
third consecutive NCAA championship.
Fans rushed court 6 of the Los Angeles Tennis Center,
screaming their undying appreciation for Elliott, and car
ried the team captain around the court. Elliott made a Car
dinal dream come true, giving Stanford its sixth NCAA title
this year, more than any school had ever achieved in one
academic year.
"This is a moment I will never forget," Elliott said. "It's
like, euphoria."...

TUCSON, Ariz. —The Stanford women edged out top-ranked Villanova to
capture their first NCAA cross-country title. The Cardinal finished with 101
points, just under Villanova's total of 106. Brigham Young finished third with 1 36
points.
"Wc thought that maybe this could happen," said senior Monal Chokshi. "We
knew our team was right up there, hut it's amazing and I can't believe it.
"I was just concentrating on my race," she said. "I think we all had our own
goals. We just wanted to go out and run our best."...
Chokshi was the first Cardinal runner to cross the finish line, clocking in at

sions, 6-1,6-7 (4-7), 6-2.
"Victories like Geoff's against top players like Sessions
are truly remarkable," Elliott said.

Cardinal victory to give Stanford the championship.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Stan
ford men's volleyball team, which had
staked its claim to the national title all year,
saw its dream achieved Saturday at Ohio.
Beneath the dusty rafters and faded
banners of St. John Arena, the top-ranked
Cardinal (27-3) defeated fellow Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation member UCLA
(24-5), earning the school's first-ever
championship in the sport and fourth of the
academic year. Appropriately, the historic
15-7, 15-10, 9-15, 6-15, 15-13 victory
came at the expense of the second-ranked
Bruins, the most celebrated men's colle
giate volleyball program in the land.
.. .The two teams traded points [in
game five] until the game was tied at 13-13,
with UClj\ senior outside hitter Paul Ni
hipali, an All-American and all-tournament
selection, serving. Nihipali promptly put his
serve into the net, giving Stanford the chance
to serve for the match.
With senior setter Stewart Chong
serving, Fuerbringer followed Nihipali,
and when Nihipali went for the kill, Fuer
bringer was there. The biggest block in
Stanford men's volleyball history gave the
Cardinal the game 15-13, and the match
and secured its first national championship.

the fifth Wildcat runner and helped clinch the title for Stanford...

Stanford athletes are back.
Will the upcoming year see them repeat the
NCAA record-breaking triumphs of the previous
season, when the men's and women's volleyball,
cross country and tennis teams brought home three
pairs of championship crowns for a total of six na
tional titles?
The men's and women's cross country teams,
which each chalked up first-place finishes in Reno
earlier this month, were the ones who set the tone for
the victorious 1996-97 season by sweeping the two
national titles in the fall.
"To have both teams win was clearly a special
and magic moment for all of us," said Vin Lananna,
coach of both the men's and women's cross country
teams. "It's a lot easier to be good at Stanford, where
you know all other teams are very good and expecta
tions are high."
The strength of the Stanford athletic program
motivates all coaches and athletes to push and
excel, according to men's volleyball coach Ruben
Nieves.
"Winning the championship is just plain sweet
and of itself, a wonderful sense of accomplishment
not only shared between the players and coaches, but
also with the Athletics Department, alumni and for
mer coaches who paved their way for us and every
one else involved," he said.
"We are all proud here at the Athletics Depart
ment, and for the men's volleyball team to be able to
contribute to that enormous success and pride, it just
feels plain good."
Nieves said his team — which graduated seven
members, including four starters — is "far from a

preseason favorite," but is aiming for yet another
championship title.
"We are much younger and inexperienced, but
like many other Stanford teams, we've reached a

point where we'll be good every year," he said.
"(Historically,) even. ni|n on the Stanford vol
leyball team thinks about w ujning the championship,
and the players this year utll be thinking about it

too."
Women's tennis coach Frank Brennan, who says
his team is "still dancing in the streets" from last sea
son, also said the squad is ready for another chal

lenging — and rewarding — season.
"Last year couldn't have gone better for all of us,"
he said. "Not only do the two (tennis) programs rub
off on each other a lot, but the entire Athletics De
partment rubs off on each other. Every time a team
wins, we're all proud."
"The first phone calls after we won were all from
fellow coaches—we help each other be aggressive,"
he added. "When Ruben's team won, we knew it was
his first and was special, so we were real happy for
him and congratulated him."
While women's volleyball coach Don Shaw said
he is still often amazed at the strength of Cardinal
athletics, each win is "almost taken for granted and
not as much appreciated" due to the number of cham
pionship titles.
"It's interesting here at Stanford," he said. "Some
teams at other schools will win a championship, and
they'll be talked about forever. But at Stanford,
you'll be talked about maybe for weeks, till the next
team wins."
Shaw, whose team currently stands at a solid 8-2,
urged students to take advantage of opportunities to
see the "very best in just about every sport."
Starting with the Stanford Showcase today and
tomorrow, where the Stanford women's volleyball
team plays some of the nation's best in Maples Pavil
ion, Stanford students will not have to wait long to
see the champions in action.
"I know there's a lot of activities going on for the
freshman this weekend, but 1 hope people get out
there and get their first taste of collegiate athletics at
the national level," Shaw said. "If they want to see
the best, they should go for it."
"We're very fortunate that on any given after
noon, we can go to an athletic venue on campus and
watch the best," Nieves said.

TUCSON, Ariz — After a successful
season that witnessed the capturing of
both the Pacific 10 Conference and Dis
trict VIII titles, the men's and women's
cross country squads yesterday earned the
one award that had always eluded them:
the NCAA championship.
The Cardinal teams, both ranked sec
ond in the nation heading into the NCAA
meet, beat the field of 22 teams to capture
the first set of men's and women's cross
country national championships in school
history.
The men easily upset defending cham
pion and top-ranked Arkansas. The Car
dinal finished with 46 points, 28 ahead of
the Razorbacks. Pac-10 rival Oregon fin
ished third with 140 points...
.. .Sophomore Brent Hauser (31:10)
and Nutter (31:11) garnered the rest of the
Cardinal's points by taking 14th and 15th
overall, respectively.
Both the Cardinal and the Razorbacks
had three runners finish in the top 10 over
all, with Arkansas gaining a three-point
advantage. But the Cardinal depth proved
to be too much, as Stanford's fourth and
fifth men finished before the fourth man
from Arkansas

STANFORD, Calif. — The No. 2 Cardinal women's tennis team captured
Stanford's ninth NCAA team title yesterday by handing No. 1 Florida its first de
feat in 63 consecutive dual matches at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Stan
ford has now tied the NCAA record for championships in a single academic year
with five — for the third time.
Stanford junior Julie Scott clinched the victory and the NCAA Championship
for the Cardinal (30-1) with an overhead winner in the third set of her No. 5 sin
gles match. The junior co-captain's 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-2 win over sophomore
Stephanie Nickitas gave the Cardinal the 5-1 win in singles.
The title was the First for Stanford since 1991, a long drought for a program that
won its sixth straight title that year

CLEVEIANI) — It's why they trained so hard in the
preseason. It's why they played the toughest schedule in the
country. It's why they worked so diligently to make them
selves the most complete team in the country.
So that they could be champions.
The Stanford women's volleyball team (31-2) earned
the right to call itself the best squad in collegiate volleyball
by winning the NCAA title in Cleveland.
On the first day of winter in subzero temperatures, the
Cardinal provided some heat by scorching the Hawaii Rain
bow Wahine in the championship match....

.. .Stanford moved to a 13-5 lead [in game three) after
an ace by Walsh and a kill by Ifejika as the Band, Tree and
every Cardinal fan in the arena sat at the edge of their seats
in anticipation of victory.
Hie moment finally arrived in a fitting manner, as tour
nament MVT Walsh went high for a kill, pounded it through
the deflated Wahine defense and gave a look of disbelief
and exhilaration that can only Ix- etched on the face of a
first-time champion....

.. .Scott (29-1) began to pull away from Nickitas early in the third set as she
broke serve in the second game to go up 2-0. The Gator sophomore, who earned
an NCAA title last year in doubles, fought oil two match points in the final game
but was forced logo to the lob on another. With the crowd buzzing and the rest ol
the Cardinal ready to charge the court, Scott put the Florida season, win streak arid
reign as defending champions to rest with the slam....
