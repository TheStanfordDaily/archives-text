# Six titles, we will watch them fall: Seven reasons to think seven in '97-98
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
The trophy case in Arrillaga Family Sports Center is getting crowded. That's the
price of dominating college athletics like no school in history.

It's also old news.
A new school year has dawned on Palm Drive, relegating the six 1996-97 nation-

al titles to the pages of history and the shelves of the Stanford Sports Hall of

Fame Room. And as students new and old settle in for another fall on

the Farm, the question arises: Can Stanford win six again?
Don't sell the Cardinal short, sports fans. Six is not the Na
tional Championship ceiling. Here are seven reasons why Stan
ford could break its own record with seven titles this year (and

maybe even get some respect from Sports Illustrated).
1. Repeat times six. Each of the 1996-97 championship teams
has a good shot at winning it all again this year. Three of them

— women's volleyball and men's and women's cross coun
try — have already begun play. All three are at or near the
4 r ai n„

top of the polls.
Cross country is just getting into its season, having com
peted only once this year, but looks to be as good or better
than last year's team. (See reason number two.)

Volleyball has struggled early — if you can call a No. 4
ranking and an 8-2 record, with both losses to No. 1-ranked

Penn State, struggling — but injuries and the task of integrat
ing an unusually high number of newcomers have kept the team

from finding its rhythm. Come December, when Kerri Walsh and
Lisa Sharpley are at full strength and coach Don Shaw sets a rotation,
Stanford will be in great position to win its fourth title in six years.

2. Success perpetuates itself. Stanford had a superb recruiting year in 1997, thanks
in no small part to its success on the field. A talented freshman class should provide
both cross country teams with depth and help offset last year's key losses. Volleyball
features five freshmen, one of whom — setter Lindsay Kagawa — has already

seen lots of playing time due to Sharpley's injury.
The two biggest Stanford recruits, literally and figuratively, are Jason
and Jarron Collins, twin post players from Los Angeles who will help

make Stanford one of the tallest teams in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. They are two of the most highly recruited players in

Stanford history, and will help the Cardinal men push for

their first post-World War II hoops title down the
road.

I Big year for men's hoops. Stanford's front line will boast six players 6-foot-8 or taller
this season, including 7-foot junior Tim Young and sophomore rebounding ma-

chine Mark Madsen. The Collins brothers join Mark Seaton and Pete Van Elswyk

— who both saw action last year — and Young and Madsen to form one of the
teepest corps of big men in the nation.

Many will write the Cardinal out of the national picture due to the loss of
Brevin Knight to the Cleveland Cavaliers. But if the team can find a go-to play-

er for clutch situations, and the big men play as strong as they look, watch

out. A team this deep can go places. Besides, if Arizona can win
the NCAA Tournament....

4. End of a year-long dry spell. The most amazing aspect of
the six-title year? Every championship was captured on land.

t was the first time in more than five years that water polo,
men's swimming and women's swimming all failed to
earn titles. Both the men and women finished second at

NCAAs last year, and both teams are hungry to reclaim
the national throne.

A year in the '90s without a Stanford title in the
pool is as rare as an Oregon State football win in con
ference. 1996 was a fluke that shouldn't be repeated
this year.

5. Good teams are due. Both Stanford's baseball and
women's basketball teams danced on the edge of national

glory last year, and both came up short. Both teams have

been consistently good for several years. Both teams are due.
Perhaps this will be the year for one of them.

6. Kristen Folkl. The only individual on this list, but with good rea
son. Folkl is a player-of-the-year candidate in both volleyball and

basketball. The latter is truly impressive because the senior sat out half
the 1996 basketball season before returning Feb. 20 vs. Washington State.
One of the greatest athletes in school history, she could lead two teams to
titles this year.

7. Coaching counts. Cross-country head man Vin Lananna won
national and conference coach-of-the-year honors in

IW6 Four more Cardinal coaches took Pac-10
prizes. You don't get six titles without great

coaching, and great coaches don't settle
for less than national championships.
Especially at Stanford.
