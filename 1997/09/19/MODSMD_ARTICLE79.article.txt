## Cross country prepares to defend national titles 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
Heading into the 1997 season, the Stanford men's and
women's cross country squads are the teams to beat. Both teams
claimed upset NCAA titles last year in Arizona and they hope to
have a repeat sweep at this year's championships in Greenville,
South Carolina.
"We have very strong teams this year. Both the men and
women are very excited about this season," said head coach Vin
Lananna.
The men lost three runners from last year's winning team but
have an impressive lineup to pick up the slack. Junior twins Brad

and Brent Mauser will lead as captains of the team. Brad placed
sixth at last year's nationals, earning him All-America honors.
Brother Brent also earned All-America honors, placing 14th,
and enjoyed a great season in track and field, earning All-Amcr
ica honors in the S,(XX) meters.
Other returnees to the Cardinal lineup include juniors Jason
Balkman, Jon Weldon and Ryan McCalmon and seniors Jason
Lunn, Nathan Nutter and Jason Perscheid. Nutter finished 15th
at last year's championships.
Redshirt freshmen Dave Abril, Thomas Murley and Michael
Stember, who all have competed at the national level, will also
add depth to the team this fall. Murley earned a spot on the U.S.
Junior National team, which competed in Italy at the World

Championships this year. Stember has seen international com
petition as well, racing in the Pan Am games in lx>th Chile and
Cuba.
The men's team will also enjoy the addition of several stand
out freshmen runners, including high school Ail-Americans
Jamey Gifford and Isaac Hawkins. Brian Burke, Gabriel Jen
nings, Jonathon Riley and Grant Robison are the other newcom
ers.
"Any coach in the country would be happy to have these five
guys on their team," Lananna said.
The women's squad returns perhaps an even more impres
sive group of runners, led by junior Mary Cobb. Cobb finished
third among Stanford runners at the NCAAs and earned All-

America honors. Cobb, a fifth-place finisher at the IWS NCAA
Championships, also earned All-America honors in track and
field for both the 3,(XM) and S,(XX) meters.
Seniors Kortney Dunscombe, Jessica Fry and Sarna Rcnfro
will add talent and experience to the team. Dunscombe earned
All-America honors in track in the 10,(MX) meters. Fry finished
1 (>th overall at NCAAs last season, second-best among Stanford
runners.
Renfro, the team captain, competed at NCAAs and also
earned All-America honors in track last spring in the S,(XX) me
ters. She was (he only woman to qualify for four distance events
