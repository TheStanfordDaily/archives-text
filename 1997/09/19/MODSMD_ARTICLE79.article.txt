## Cross country prepares to defend national titles 
### Becky Unruh Contributing writer 
Heading into the 1997 season, the Stanford men's and
women's cross country squads are the teams to beat. Both teams
claimed upset NCAA titles last year in Arizona and they hope to
have a repeat sweep at this year's championships in Greenville,
South Carolina.
"We have very strong teams this year. Both the men and
women are very excited about this season," said head coach Vin
Lananna.
The men lost three runners from last year's winning team but
have an impressive lineup to pick up the slack. Junior twins Brad

and Brent Mauser will lead as captains of the team. Brad placed
sixth at last year's nationals, earning him All-America honors.
Brother Brent also earned All-America honors, placing 14th,
and enjoyed a great season in track and field, earning All-Amcr
ica honors in the S,(XX) meters.
Other returnees to the Cardinal lineup include juniors Jason
Balkman, Jon Weldon and Ryan McCalmon and seniors Jason
Lunn, Nathan Nutter and Jason Perscheid. Nutter finished 15th
at last year's championships.
Redshirt freshmen Dave Abril, Thomas Murley and Michael
Stember, who all have competed at the national level, will also
add depth to the team this fall. Murley earned a spot on the U.S.
Junior National team, which competed in Italy at the World

Championships this year. Stember has seen international com
petition as well, racing in the Pan Am games in lx>th Chile and
Cuba.
The men's team will also enjoy the addition of several stand
out freshmen runners, including high school Ail-Americans
Jamey Gifford and Isaac Hawkins. Brian Burke, Gabriel Jen
nings, Jonathon Riley and Grant Robison are the other newcom
ers.
"Any coach in the country would be happy to have these five
guys on their team," Lananna said.
The women's squad returns perhaps an even more impres
sive group of runners, led by junior Mary Cobb. Cobb finished
third among Stanford runners at the NCAAs and earned All-

America honors. Cobb, a fifth-place finisher at the IWS NCAA
Championships, also earned All-America honors in track and
field for both the 3,(XM) and S,(XX) meters.
Seniors Kortney Dunscombe, Jessica Fry and Sarna Rcnfro
will add talent and experience to the team. Dunscombe earned
All-America honors in track in the 10,(MX) meters. Fry finished
1 (>th overall at NCAAs last season, second-best among Stanford
runners.
Renfro, the team captain, competed at NCAAs and also
earned All-America honors in track last spring in the S,(XX) me
ters. She was (he only woman to qualify for four distance events

onships.
Other returnees for the women are
sophomores Shaluinn Fullove, Mary
Huang, Kerry Dugan and Allison Twist,
and juniors Linn Schulte-Sasse and Ryan
Thomas.
Three redshirt freshman also return to
the Farm: Courtney Adams, Ashley Holt
and Christy Lacey-Krietz.

The women's team boasts an impres
sive freshman class, led by Julia Stamps
of Santa Rosa, Calif. Stamps has run on
six USA Track and Field world teams and
holds several course records, including
the best prep time on Stanford's course.
"Julia is going to step right into our
program," Lananna said. "She's one of
the best prep runners around."
Other freshman to watch include
Becky Gogel, an Ail-American in the
3,200-meter relay, Washington state
champion Ann Ramsey, Elena Villarreal
and Anne Gunnison.
"We're going to take this season week

by week, treating each meet as a chal
lenge. This is an incremental process —
one step at a time," Lananna said.
Both the men and women saw early
action this season, competing at the
Nevada Wolf Pack Invitational on Sept.
6. The men took first in the four-mile
race, ahead of California and Sacramento
State. Jon Weldon led all finishers with a
time of 20:58, and Jason Lunn finished
second in 21:02. Jason Perscheid,
Thomas Murley, redshirt freshman Seth
Williams and Jake Maas also finished in
the top 10.
The women also Ux)k first in the S,(XX)

meters, out-doing California, Nevada and
Sacramento State. Sophomore Sally
Glenn was the top Stanford finisher in
18:33, with Sarna Renfro close behind in
18:40. Shaluinn Fullove and Mary Huang
also finished in the top 10.
If Nevada is any indication of the sea
son ahead, the Cardinal can look forward
to many more first-place finishes. With
talent and experience, the Cardinal is the
team ahead of the pack in 1997.
"Our aim is first Pac-10 champs, then
District VIII champs, then a spot on the
winner's stand at nationals," Lananna
said.
