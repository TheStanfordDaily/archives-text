## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
John Schlesinger, a I ( W7 Stanford graduate, died
Aug. 18 of injuries sustained in a car accident in
Maine.
Friends and relatives attended a memorial ser
vice for the 23-year-old Schlesinger — who last year
was a coterminal student in English and a member of
the Stanford cycling team — on Aug. 21 in Con
necticut. He is survived by his parents and two sis
ters.
I lis friends, who called their teammate "Schles,"
remembered Schlesinger as intelligent with a gotxl
sense of humor and a determination to succeed.
"He was one of the smartest guys I have met in
ny life," said doctoral stude.it Dave Bailey, a close

friend. "He had an amazing sense of humor. In fact,
my first impression of him was that he was a very
funny guy."
Schlesinger raced with the cycling team for five
years and also edited the team newsletter, which pro
vided him an opportunity to write and to share his
wit. After graduation, Schlesinger had planned to
work as a freelance journalist in Italy.
As a cyclist, Schlesinger displayed a tremendous
amount of natural talent, team coach Art Walker
said. By the end of his first year in the sport, he. al
ready had advanced to a level above most beginners.
He raced in both collegiate and non-collegiate
competitions. last spring, Schlesinger won the
Wine Country ( lassie and placed third in the lixeter
Road Race, results that helped him
move into the highest category of non
collegiate racing.
Bailey spent a lot of time with
Schlesinger on road trips to races and re
membered that waiters would often
comment that he and Schlesinger
looked like tw ins. "In response," Bailey
remembered," John's face would light
up with a broad smile, his eyes would
twinkle, and he'd say in a nice, loud
voice, But don't you think I'm much
better looking?' "
His roommate for three years, senior
Andrew Lewis, remembered going out
to dinner with Schlesinger and other cy
clists after a race in Visalia, Calif. The
group was served salad and bread but
dinner still hadn't arrived two hours
later.

pretending he was going to
the bathroom, left the table and went
outside. He signaled to another member
of the group, and they all left. However
Schlesinger, concerned about his friend,
went to look for Lew is. The group ended
up leaving without him, and Schlesinger
wandered around town by himself for
several hours.
Although he had been stranded,
Schlesinger was able to laugh off the in
cident, Ixwis said, showing not only his
lightheadedness but that he would "risk
getting himself in trouble to help out his
friends."
When Stanford eliminated his e-mail
account this summer, Schlesinger could
no longer contribute to the cycling team
newsgroup, Walker said His absence,
Schlesinger quipped at the time, would
"render that newsgroup completely un
worth reading anyway."
"And it's true," Walker said. "It's re
ally not the same."
