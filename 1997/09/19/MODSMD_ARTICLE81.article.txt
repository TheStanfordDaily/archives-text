# FIELD HOCKEY
## Field hockey starts slowly, beats Drexel 1-0 
### Alda Leu Senior staff writer 
After placing three team members
on the U.S. Junior World Cup team —
more than any other school — presea
son expectations ran high for the Stan
ford field hockey team.
But the players' blessing was a team
curse, as the Cardinal dropped two of
their first three games without World
Cup stars Carey Cloyd, Justina
Williams and Sarah Medeiros.
Stanford finally kick-started the
year in its home opener against Drexel
Sept. 7, winning 1-0 with a goal from
senior Paige Mader.
The win served as vindication for a
slow start that knocked Stanford,
which finished 10-3-0 in 19%, slightly
off course towards an NCAA tourna
ment berth.
The squad played its first two

games at California against two
schools, Michigan and Michigan State,
that have historically fielded ranked
teams. The Cardinal lost both games,
falling 1-0 to the Wolverines on Aug.
30 and 2-0 to the Spartans on Aug. 31.
The losses eliminated hopes of an
automatic NCAA tournament berth for
Stanford. An undefeated season — and
a Western Division title — is the only
guarantee of a place in the tournament
come November.
Now the Card must work towards
improving its offense and pulling to
gether to win the rest of this season's
games and hope for a wild card spot.
The outlook is good with the return
of the three World Cup team members.
"[Medeiros and Cloyd] are both
strong forwards and they are both very
good at getting the ball in the cage. We
did miss them, but we did have very
strong people to replace them," Mader

Junior Monique Leroux and fresh
man Michelle Scott stepped up to take
the starting positions. Mader shifted to
center mid-field to fill in Williams'
spot.
Johnson hesitated to attribute the
team's slow start to the absence of
Cloyd, Williams and Medeiros. The
coach said she won't know how good
the team is until it plays at full strength.
Offense is still Stanford's primary
concern.
"We have an inexperienced and
young lineup and it took its toll," she
said. "We're just not taking enough
shots."
The youth of the team is partially
"by design." Johnson recruits large
classes every other year. This year's
entering group includes two walk-ons
and six recruits.
The freshmen class consists of

goalie Meg Crowley, forward Staci
Fujii, midfielder Sarah Hemmer, de
fender Emily Lash, defender Grace
Rauh, midfielder Melita Sawyer, for
ward Michelle Scott and forward/de
fender Nicole Waskovich.
Crowley should get some playing
time behind senior goalie Kelly Naylor
during this week's games and Scott,
who has been competing with a back
injury, will get some rest with the re
turn of the three starters.
With three players deemed worthy
of representing the U.S. international
ly, and eight fresh faces on the field, the
expectations are for Stanford to repeat
as Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence champions and continue to grow
as a team.
"I hope to win the rest of our games
from here on out and continue to work

on our passing and receiving," Mader
said. "We want to have a strong show
ing against the East Coast and show
them we have a developed program
and we are a competitive team."

The World Cup trio rejoined the
team this week when the Cardinal
headed to St. Louis, Mo., for four
games against several tough confer
ence foes.
Stanford takes on Ball State —
early favorite to take the Western Divi
sion crown — tomorrow morning, then
faces Miami (Ohio) on Sunday.
