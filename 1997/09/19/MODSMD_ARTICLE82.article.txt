## Card beats Davis Water polo brings back deep team 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
The tradition of the Stanford
men's water polo team is one over
flowing with success. In 28 years
on the Farm, the team has garnered
11 first-place finishes in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation,
eight national championships and
18 top-four finishes.
This year promises to be no ex
ception. With a starting squad com
posed entirely of veterans and a No.
3 ranking in the NCAA Water Polo
Coaches poll, a run for the 1997
NCAA title seems probable.
"Everyone has a lot of experi
ence," said 21-year veteran head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "I feel I
have a lot of depth. I have 12 guys
that I can play. This is probably the
deepest team we've ever had."
Five starters return for the '97
season, including two who earned
All-America recognition in 1996.
Among those is junior goalie Chris
Aguilera, who tallied 221 saves
during his first season as a starter in

'96. Regarded as one of the top
goalies in the country, Aguilera is
expected to serve as the anchor of
the team's defense.
Junior Crosby Grant, an honor
able mention All-American last
year, starts in the hole position. As
the team's top returning scorer with
27 points, Grant has developed into
a formidable center-forward and
ranks among the country's best.
Junior David Hay will share
playing time with Grant in the hole.
With his unique torpedo-like arm,
Hay will often be relied upon as a
scorer. Rounding out the starting
lineup is sophomore driver Brian
Heifferon. Touted as the team's
best all-around player, Heifferon
chalked up 24 points in his rookie
season.
Despite the team's strengths, in
juries like the one to junior defend
er Layne Beaubien during a recent
practice have hampered the squad.
Beaubien is a leading
defender," Dettamanti said. "This

is a big loss."
The Sept. 13 matchup against UC-
Davis proved favorable, however.
Sophomore Andy Walburger, fresh
off the bench, netted four goals in a
14-5 Stanford victory. Five Cardinal
goals were delivered in a steady on
slaught during the final 2:28 of the
first quarter.
"We did a nice job of creating a lot
of shots for ourselves," Dettamanti
said. "I was proud with the guys that
came off the bench."
"The team is starting to play bet

ter," Heifferon said. "You can easily
tell on defense."
This weekend is the true test.
Today, Stanford (1-0) challenges
fourth-ranked Pepperdine. The two
teams will face again during the
Southern California Tournament at
USC tomorrow and Sunday. Twelve
of the nation's top 15 water polo teams
will be present at the tournament.
Pepperdine has "a really good hole
man," Aguilera said. "We're really fo
cusing our defense on him."
According to Aguilera, the true
focus throughout the season, howev
er, will be on winning a champi
onship.
"That's all that matters," he said.
