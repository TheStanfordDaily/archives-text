# Five Bucks And A Bike
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Welcome to the Silicon Valley. You may have
already noticed that Palo Alto has plenty of cell
phones, yuppies and computers. True, it's been
called "Shallow Alto" by those who disdain
cleanliness and comfort, and the hard fact is
that the cost of living is quite high. The stores
here usually don't care if they get your busi
ness, and most don't cater to the student bud
get. Why should they, when CEOs lavishly
spend your monthly allowance on a daily basis
in these establishments? Fear not, Stanford
freshmen — it's a big, expensive world out
there, but the good news is that bargains and
value are yours for the taking. All you really
need is.. . .
FIVE BUCKS AND A BIKE
Groceries Galore —
For the Martha Stewart in You
It's 7 p.m. You have the sudden urge to bake
something (or you don't, but pretend you need
groceries). You only have your bike to get you to
your groceries. Where do you go?

I.JJ&FFood Store
In the world of grocery shopping, this is the hidden
treasure. A fresh-produce fan's delight, JJ 8c F has the
best deals on the freshest fruit every day, direct from
the growers. The store is family-run, and the staff is
friendly. JJ 8c F was recently remodeled, but it still re
tains the feel of a real grocery store. Its deli offers
great picnic supplies. 520 College Ave. 857-0901.

p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
2. John's Town and Country Market
The closest market to campus, it's your basic su
permarket. It doesn't overwhelm with its organ
ic, imported and whole-food zeal. John's also has
a deli with great burritos. Watch out for this place
during lunch, when it gets overrun with Palo Alto
High School students. 116 Town and Country
Village. 321-8438. Open Monday through Satur
day 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.

place to go. The back of the store offers a wide
selection of noodles, rice, dried fruits and
spices. A great place to go for picnic lunches and
baked goods, the store also stocks a combina
tion of organic and commercial products —
slightly on the expensive side in price. 64 Cali
fornia Ave. 323-8361. Open daily 8 a.m. to 9
p.m.

the West Coast and includes a flower shop. 525 El
Camino Real. 324-8630. 24/7, except for Christ
mas.
5. Whole Foods
The most aesthetically pleasing of the within-biking
distance markets, Whole Foods has a great deli, a
good bakery and a plethora of samples to entertain
the Stanford shopper. It offers a large selection of or
ganic products, including personal care items and
herbs. It's more expensive than Safeway, but it's also
the closest market to University Ave. 774 Emerson.

bakery open at 8 a.m.

Service Blues —
Without Creating Economic Ones
Your friends at Berkeley aren't the only ones who
can eat good food for under $5. You just have to
look around a little more for the bargains. All of
these restaurants are within ten minute's biking
distance from campus, and they all serve great
meals for about $5. (Okay, sometimes $7. But
you're in the heart of Silicon Valley, so this is as
cheap as its going to get!) Bon Appetit.

cinnamon rolls and omelettes. Regular donuts are
