# Five Bucks And A Bike
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Welcome to the Silicon Valley. You may have
already noticed that Palo Alto has plenty of cell
phones, yuppies and computers. True, it's been
called "Shallow Alto" by those who disdain
cleanliness and comfort, and the hard fact is
that the cost of living is quite high. The stores
here usually don't care if they get your busi
ness, and most don't cater to the student bud
get. Why should they, when CEOs lavishly
spend your monthly allowance on a daily basis
in these establishments? Fear not, Stanford
freshmen — it's a big, expensive world out
there, but the good news is that bargains and
value are yours for the taking. All you really
need is.. . .
FIVE BUCKS AND A BIKE
Groceries Galore —
For the Martha Stewart in You
It's 7 p.m. You have the sudden urge to bake
something (or you don't, but pretend you need
groceries). You only have your bike to get you to
your groceries. Where do you go?

I.JJ&FFood Store
In the world of grocery shopping, this is the hidden
treasure. A fresh-produce fan's delight, JJ 8c F has the
best deals on the freshest fruit every day, direct from
the growers. The store is family-run, and the staff is
friendly. JJ 8c F was recently remodeled, but it still re
tains the feel of a real grocery store. Its deli offers
great picnic supplies. 520 College Ave. 857-0901.

p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
2. John's Town and Country Market
The closest market to campus, it's your basic su
permarket. It doesn't overwhelm with its organ

during lunch, when it gets overrun with Palo Alto
High School students. 116 Town and Country

slightly on the expensive side in price. 64 Cali

The most aesthetically pleasing of the within-biking
distance markets, Whole Foods has a great deli, a
good bakery and a plethora of samples to entertain
the Stanford shopper. It offers a large selection of or
ganic products, including personal care items and
herbs. It's more expensive than Safeway, but it's also
the closest market to University Ave. 774 Emerson.

bakery open at 8 a.m.

Fight the Housing and Dining
Service Blues —
Without Creating Economic Ones
Your friends at Berkeley aren't the only ones who
can eat good food for under $5. You just have to
look around a little more for the bargains. All of
these restaurants are within ten minute's biking
distance from campus, and they all serve great
meals for about $5. (Okay, sometimes $7. But
you're in the heart of Silicon Valley, so this is as
cheap as its going to get!) Bon Appetit.

BURRITOS/WRAPS

Saturday noon to 11:30 p.m.
25. Uptown Yogurt
One of the best yogurts in the Bay Area (besides the
Yumi chain, which is too far away to be included in
this list). The store recently changed ownership, so it
will be interesting to see if the new leadership con
tinues the friendly service, generous portion sizes
and store sterility that yogurt-philes love so much in
their yogurt shops. 165 University Ave. 321-4547.

fering "burritos" in flavors like teriyaki and thai. But
