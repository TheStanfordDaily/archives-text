midnight, Sunday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
40. Petroglyph Ceramic Lounge
Pots, pans, plates, kettles and picture frames beckon you to
paint them. The store provides the ceramics and the
paints, all you do is pay and paint. They also glaze the work
once you're through to give that professional potter-look.
Good for parties, friends and gifts. 158 University Ave.
328 -4278. Open daily at 10 a.m. Closes Monday through
Thursday at 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday at 11 p.m., Sun
day at 8 p.m.
Books
When you finish your CIV reading and crave real print
ed enlightenment, here are some places to search.
41. Borders Books and Music
The mightiest of all the bookstores, this sometimes has
the feel of a public library rather than a store. People do
their homework at the tables in front, read magazines in
the cozy chairs and listen to weekly readings inside.
Chances are good that if the book you want recently came
to press, Borders will probably have it. 456 University
Ave. 326-3670. Open Sunday through Thursday 9 a.m. to
11 p.m., Friday and Saturday until midnight.
42. Know Knew Books
Well, the title sounds it all. Nothing here is new. The store sells
all kinds of books and you can trade/sell those CIV books
when you're done. A great stash of used vinyl records for $ 1.50
a pop, too. 415 California Ave. 326-9355. Open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday noon to 8 p.m.
43. Megabooks
Megabooks has the misfortune to be located right next
to Borders, who they have wittingly labeled "Goliath"
against themselves, "David." The store is small and
quiet — cozy in the way that all bookstores used to be.
They sell new and used books in all sorts of genres. The
staff is friendly, and the store is sensitive to local char
ity groups and causes. 444 University Ave. 326-4730.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
44. Printer's Inc.
Printer's Inc. has the best selection of foreign magazines any
where. See Cindy Crawford naked in (iermany! They have a
good selection of daily newspapers from around the world, a
friendly staff, a Printer's Inc. Cafe next door and a good se
lection of gift items. 310 California Ave. 327-6500. Open
daily 9 a.m. until 11 p.m., but you can buy magazines and
newspapers as early as 8 a.m.
45. Stacey's Professional Bookstore
Stacey's Bookstore is another one that has the unfortunate
condition of being within walking distance of better
known Borders. But at Stacey's I've found books that I
couldn't find at the Goliath of all bookstores, and its
technical and computer section is the best in the Valley.
219 University Ave. 326-0681. Open Monday through
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday until 10
p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Q
