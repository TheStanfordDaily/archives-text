## Santana: You Didn't Quite Cast Your Spell On Me, Baby 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
Santana, with special guest Rusted Root
Sunday, September 15 at Shoreline Amphitheater
It's gotten to the point where the heavy guns of
San Francisco's 1960's psychedelic rock are sadly
unreliable. The Grateful Dead are gone, Jefferson
Airplane faded into Jefferson Starship and Carlos
Santana has become a new age preacher.
During a show that consisted of one long set in
terspersed with occasional drizzle, Santana led his
seven piece band through few of the acid-laced

standards from his early work. Instead of com
manding attention with his brilliant guitar playing,
Santana seemed content to allow R&B vocalist
Tony Lindsay do the legwork. Although Lindsay
does have a smooth, powerful voice, his renditions
of classics such as "Black Magic Woman" were
sorely inadequate.
Seeing Santana standing by while Lindsay
slogged through the vocals alone was equally frus
trating. Only with their combined vocals on "Oye
Como Va" did the band really sparkle. The few times
that Santana did step to the microphone alone, he al
most always harped on the same theme: unity.
Santana's true humility while he spoke was im

pressive, but he constantly turned the stage into a
pulpit. "Peace, life, love, joy," he chanted repeated
ly. Santana's personal belief in transcendence gave
rise to a hanging stage backdrop of a Christ-like fig
ure. "Buddha, Krishna, Allah, Christ, it's all one,"
Santana later said.
The back-up band provided somewhat more in
teresting musical fare, with Karl Perrazo on percus
sion and Raul Rekowon congas standing out. Dur
ing one interlude, bassist Benny Rietveld and drum
mer Horatio Hernandez played a solid duet, fol
lowed by Rietveld crafting a stunning solo of "Sit
ting by the Dock of the Bay" by Otis Redding.
The band as a whole seemed to be showing

some fatigue. This was the 35th show of a 46-show
tour, and most of the band (including Santana
himself) reside in San Francisco. The energy on
stage picked up noticeably toward the middle of the
show when Santana invited all seven members of
Rusted Root on stage for a thunderous "Exodus" by
Bob Marley jammed into Marley's "Get Up, Stand
Up," back into "Exodus."
Rusted Root's opening set was well received by
the less-than-capacity crowd: a fun mix of classic
rockers and hippies. Tickets were still available at
the box office at show time, which may not be the
case when the Allman Brothers Band climbs on
stage at Shoreline on Friday, September 26.
