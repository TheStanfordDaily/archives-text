## The
						Game 
### 
"The Game" is one of the best Hollywood
movies to come to the big screen in a long time.
It's a fast-paced flick with an intriguing plot, ter
rific acting and incredible cinematography.
Michael Douglas portrays Nicholas Van
Orton, the guy with just about everything —
tonsofcash plus a mansion in San Francisco and
plenty of shiny black BMWs. He's a haunted
man however, Bruce Wayne-styie: he can't get
over witnessing, as a child, his father's suicide.
Instead of becoming a caped avenger, he be
comes a lonely and ruthless investment banker,
a "money mover."
When Van Orton turns 48, the age his fa
ther was at the time of his death, Van

Orton's brother, Conrad, played convinc
ingly by Sean Penn, gives Van Orton an in
vitation to Consumer Recreation Services.
CRS custom designs "games" based on psy
chological profiles of each customer. Cus
tomers are not told what the game will actu
ally involve, nor when it will begin. They are
only told that the game will give them some
form of happiness that they don't already
have.
Van Orton accepts the gift, revealing the
only weak plot point. It seems unlikely that
such a calculating businessman would allow
himself to be sucked into something without
knowing anything about it.

After Van Orton allows CRS to create his psy
chological profile, strange things begin to hap
pen to him. He knows it involves CRS, but he re
alizes that he's been scammed and his life is in
danger. The audience is kept in the dark as much
as he is and does not know why he is being fol
lowed, watched and pursued. As soon as some
thing is revealed, something else happens that
completely throws off any previous revelations.
Not only is the intricate plot nearly (law
less, the cinematography possesses the marks
of film noir perfection. Absolutely everything
glistens as light takes on the quality of liquid,
giving the entire film a surreal visual flavor
that complements the psychological confu

sion. To amplify this connection, every cam
era angle forces you to identify with Van
Orton. The audience is never given any extra
information.
The director, David Fincher ("Seven"),
melds visuals with plot, acting and the disturb
ing strains of discordant piano music to achieve
a masterpiece. He also pulls off a truly shocking
ending, the likes of which have not been seen
since "The Usual Suspects."
After sitting through two hours of nail-bit
ing and breath-holding, the audience leaves
gasping for air. Experiencing "The Game" is
worth the pain.
