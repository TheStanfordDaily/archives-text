# Different for Girls

Imagine Homecoming, 20 years from now.
You're working the reunion crowd, munching
on melon balls and potato salad when sud
denly you spot your sophomore-year room
mate. "Jack!" He looks the same, but his hair's
a lot longer and damn, is that a skirt? Wait a
minute, Jack never had breasts...
What would happen if you suddenly met a
guy who you'd once been very close to, maybe
even loved, and you discovered that he'd be
come a woman? In the British film "Different
for Girls," Paul Prentice, played by Rupert
Graves ("The Madness of King George"), a
charming but irresponsible motorcycle mes
senger, and Kim, formerly Karl (Steven Mack
intosh), face this question and work out the

answer in this enjoyable yet somewhat con
ventional romantic comedy.
Back when Kim was an effeminate Karl,
Prentice, a decent and gallant friend, rescued
him from the attacks of prep school boys un
willing to accept someone different.
The connection between their boyhood
and adult relationships is shadowy. The audi
ence is left wondering why exactly the wild
Prentice falls for this rather mannish-looking
woman with a prim and proper manner. Kim
and Prentice have very little in common and
it's not clear whether or not their closeness is
left over from their boyhood relationship.
After reuniting by chance on the street and
developing a delicate, cautious friendship,

Prentice is once again called upon to defend
Kim/Karl. This time he's thanked for his ef
forts with a brutal police beating.
When the police charge Prentice with as
sault in order to protect themselves. Prentice
needs Kim to testify on his behalf. The very
idea terrifies Kim and sends her into hiding.
After working four years to change from a
man to a woman, she is desperate to protect
herself from the stigma associated with a sex
change.
Kim's fears since "the change" have pre
vented her from living a full life. Giving Kim a
life is, of course, Prentice's job. His role is that
of a stock character in film romance — the
golden-hearted rake who brings vitality into

the empty life of a repressed virgin.
This film plays the gender-bending gim
mick well and reminds the audience of the
universal humanity that lies below the
specificsof sexuality. ()nce titled "(Crossing the
Border," this film asks the audience where the
line between love and sex lies. Are you a little
in love with your friends? Would you be at
traded to them if you were gay or you sudden
ly changed genders?
"Different for (iirls" takes a straightforward
look at these questions while providing some
good laughs and appealing characters. It runs
too long and needs a clearer resolution but
proves thought provoking and fun to watch.
