## Tanya Donelly—Lovesongs For Underdogs 
### 
The vocals on Tanya Donelly's new album
"Lovesongs For Underdogs" are everything we've
come to expect from the woman who helped to
form three different but widely successful bands
— Throwing Muses,The Breedersand Belly. The
new sounds remain those of a woman recently
come into her own, sultry with a hint of melan
choly backed by uninhibited raw power.

But even though Tanya has a voice that would
make Sarah McLachlin and most of the Lilith Fair
lineup eat their hearts out, her inexorable, de
pressing movement toward bland folk/pop has
finally come to a head with "I/>vesongs for Un
derdogs." 'ITiis album is a numbing tour de force
of power ballads, with lyrics that fall short of true
emotion and instrumentation that quickly grows
old.
There are a few pleasant songs scattered

throughout the album. "Lantern" departs from
the standard pop recipe of soaring background
strings and soft acoustic guitars with rough vo
cals, screeching guitar and abrupt pauses, and the
track "Goat Girl" has a catchy pop hook and
manages to stand out despite being buried to
ward the end. Rut fans of the Muses and The
Breeders are sure to be disappointed with the alt
supergirl's first solo attempt.
