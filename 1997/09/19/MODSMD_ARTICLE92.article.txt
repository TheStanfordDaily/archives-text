## Stanford's Free Frills 
### 
Welcome to Stanford! In case you had a summer
of too much work and too little fun, The Daily
has compiled a few helpful suggestions to make
your stay here as enjoyabfe as possible. Take ad
vantage of The Farms free adventures:

■ Should've done this summer: Watch Mira Sorvino run
around and scream in "Mimic."
■ Can do now: Watch "The X-files" with the rest of your dorm
mates. It's free, it's fun and just as freakish.
■ Should've done this summer: Watch Fred Savage's cinematic
turn in "Little Monsters" on video.
H Can do now: Watch Fred Savage's new show "Working," be
cause you won't be seeing him on campus this year.
■ Should've done this summer: Buy "Tiger Woods: Son, Hero
and Champion" at a video store near you.
■ Can do now: Borrow a camcorder and a tape and take it over
to the golf course. Make a little video and call it "A Hero's Golf
Course: Tiger Woods at Stanford." Sell it to a Pro Fro next year.

■ Should've done this summer: Watch Jodie Foster gasp in
"Contact."
■ Can do now: Experience the movie for free. Go sit by The Dish
and fall asleep with headphones on — you'll wake up with the
same facial expression as Jodie Foster. But if you see Matthew
McConaughey around, please let us know.
■ Should've done this summer: Go to some tropical paradise
with clear blue water, blindingly white sand and a cooler
of tequila.
■ Can do now: Go sit by Lake lag. Sure, it's more a forest of
weeds than a hike right now, but there is a patch of sand. Anil if
you wait until Spring Quarter, all ofthose shrubs will be covered
with water.
