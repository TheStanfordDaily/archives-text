# UC Regents OK merger of hospitals
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
In a decisive vote Friday, the Regents of the University of Cal
ifornia gave their Final stamp of approval to the merger between
UC-San Francisco and Stanford's medical centers, keeping the
merger well on target for completion by Nov. 1.
The Regents voted 12 to 4 to give UCSF the authority to exe
cute the Final stages of the merger, which would place all assets
of the two centers into a nonprofit corporation called UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care.
The move will concern the clinical services of the two centers.
The two Universities' medical schools will continue to operate
separately.
The merger must now receive approval from Stanford's
Board of Trustees, which is expected to sign off on the move.
USHC spokeswoman Judy Frabotta said it was possible the
board would give its approval early thus week.
Proponents of the merger, including administrators at both
universities, see it as ensuring Financial stability for the two cen
ters, as well as offering opportunities for economies of scale and
cooperation.
When the merger was Fust discussed, then-Stanford Health
Services head Peter Van Etten said the merged centers could "es
tablish a brand-name identity for academic medicine as synony
mous with specialized care in this area." Van Etten is now the
head of USHC.
Frabotta applauded "the final sign-off of the regents," stress
ing its importance, given that the most contentious debate had fo
cused on the role of UCSF.
Opponents of the merger, including Lt Gov. Gray Davis, a re
gent who voted against the move on Friday, have expressed con
cerns over the legality and wisdom of giving up full public con
trol of a state asset as important as UCSF's hospital.
USHC's board of directors includes representatives from both
universities, including UC Regents but, because of outside direc
tors, neither school has 50 percent representation, leading some
opponents to label the merger a "privatization" of UCSF's hospi
tal.
In an attempt to preserve public scrutiny, State Sen. John Bur
ton introduced legislation in March to place stringent open meet
ing and public record requirements on USHC.
According to Frabotta, these requirement* wi.n.i)d have "re
quired [USHC] to be even more open than UCSF was" before the
merger, which would have impaired USHC's competitive via
bility.
Eventually a compromise bill, written
after consulting both universities, passed
the state legislature. According to Frabot
ta, the bill now includes exemptions that
allow USHC confidentiality in its con
tracts and collective bargaining, and in
matters involving Stanford's pre-merger
finances.
Frabotta said both schcx>ls now sup
port the bill.
The merger still faces substantial op
position from unions representing UCSF
workers. Unions have asserted that merg
ing with heavily non-union Stanford will
hurt workers' job and wage security.
In addition, they charge that the merg
er will set the stage for layoffs that will
lead to understaffing and diminished
quality of care.
USHC has issued pledges to rehire
more than 90 percent of UCSF workers,
but unions still see future layoffs as a
threat.
