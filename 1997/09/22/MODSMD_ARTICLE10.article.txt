Socialist victory in Yugoslavia
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Slobodan Milose
vic's Socialist party claimed victory early this morning in
Serbian elections, after a vote many of his opponents boy
cotted because they said it was rigged.
"It is obvious that our party has a substantial lead in
both the presidential and parliamentary elections," party
spokesman Ivica Dacic said. Preliminary results were
expected this afternoon.
Milosevic, who controls the state media, was expected
from the beginning to see his party triumph in the vote.

Constitutionally barred from running for a third term as
president of the Serb republic, Milosevic engineered his
appointment as president of Yugoslavia this summer,
maintaining sweeping control of Serbia and of the election.
In protest, an alliance of pro-democracy parties urged
Serbs to boycott, hoping that a majority of the 7 million
registered voters would help make the vote invalid by not
participating.
By this morning, it appeared their effort had failed.
Milosevic's protege, Zoran Lilic, looked certain to take
the presidency or at least face a run-off in two weeks.
