## Editor's welcome Flipping the coin 
### 
Over the past two weeks, my life has been
focused almost completely on the Clin
ton's arrival on campus. The media cir
cus that has surrounded them, engulfing The
Daily as well, has influenced the way I see the
media, and how I will run The Daily this fall.
When I was elected editor-in-chief of The
Daily last May, I didn't think much about
Chelsea Clinton's decision to come to Stanford.
I was too excited with my own plans for the next
year including sending The Daily to the printer
electronically and setting up the paper's typeset
ting system. To me, Chelsea was just another
student.
By the end of the June, however, reporters
and news organizations began ealling The Daily
for information about her. The Daily needed to
have a single response to keep the rumors and
misinformation from spreading. I talked with
my staff about what kind of policy we wanted to
adopt in order to help us deal with the onslaught
of media.
We decided The Daily would treat Chelsea
Clinton as a regular student. In other words, if
she involves herself in a newsworthy event at
Stanford, we would do a story. If she has the
lead in a dance performance, or she founds a stu
dent club, we will do a story, as we would if she
were any other student. It is news that she; her
mother, the first lady; and her father, the Presi
dent of the United States, arrived on campus Fri
day.
But if she goes to an SAE party, or she skips
her CIV lecture, it's not news.
Moreover, if national news organizations call
The Daily looking for phone numbers or access
to student events, we will not link them to the
information. Chelsea is not an elected official,
and she deserves a private life.
Except to my staff, I didn't make the policy
public. I was therefore surprised when a reporter
from the San Francisco Chronicle called my
home more than four times in two days, in addi
tion to a multitude of phone calls to my office at
The Daily. He had heard about the policy and
wanted to do a story on how we weren't going
"bug Chelsea." I thought it might be a good idea
to make the policy public so reporters would
know not to bother us, and I agreed to an inter
view.
So much for thinking the press would lay off.
The next day, the Chronicle story went on
the AP wire, and my face and name were plas
tered on every newspaper I picked up. The
tables turned on me: I had previously been the
reporter asking questions. Suddenly, the press
attacked me on all sides.
That morning, the phone rang incessantly,
calls coming in from several major newspapers,
radio shows and television stations. At first I
was flattered, but when I thought more about it,
I realized I wanted to do as few interviews as

possible. Because The Daily decided not to join
the media rush surrounding Chelsea, participat
ing in the hype around our policy would be
counterproductive.
The press still wanted a story, however, and
The Daily's "no comment" stance was interest
ing to them. Reporters mobbed the Daily office.
When I turned down the interviews, they often
made nasty comments, like "What goes around
comes around," and "You'll be in these shoes
someday. Soon you'll be the asshole."
I felt guilty that I wasn't talking to all of
them. I was angry that the reporters felt they had
the right to overrun our office, bombard me with
questions and pester my staff.
I have been frustrated many times before
when people refused to talk to me when I was
writing a news story. 1 tried to explain that if
they didn't talk to me, their side of the story and
views would be left out, and the story wouldn't
be accurate.
Hut I had never felt what it was like on the
other side, to be cornered in my own office by
someone with a monstrous camera. 1 felt like no
one was really listening to me. The reporters
taking notes only heard sound bytes.
In an attempt to protect Chelsea's privacy,
my own had been invaded by ravenous press, a
group with whom I have always identified.
When the media becomes too voracious, and
reporters, in fighting for a story, make the peo
ple who are their sources casualties, the cause of
the public's right to know has gone too far. A
totally insatiable press is wrong, and it is up to
the media itself to pull back from tabloid and
irresponsible journalism.
If media curiosity invades the privacy of
someone who has not voluntarily chosen the
public light, it is the media's job to stop, analyze
the real news and publicize only that.
I have set a goal for The Daily â€” to be an
organization with principle: to report the news
that the public should and has a right to know
but to not to invade private lives.
Other student organizations at Stanford that
have been frustrated in the past because they felt
they were misrepresented. Please tell us if you
think the Daily isn't doing its job.
We are not sensational reporters out for a
quotation: Our goal is to listen and watch, then
report the news eloquently, accurately and fair
ly. We pledge to work with the Stanford com
munity to report our news with integrity.
