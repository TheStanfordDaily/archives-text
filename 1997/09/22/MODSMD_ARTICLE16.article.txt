## Defining home: my two paradises 
### 
Bill Shen

My first summer living away from home is
over. For the first time in my life, I was
cooking, cleaning and clipping coupons
while trying to survive on three different part-time
jobs. I'm not complaining... I've been dreaming
about this summer — complete with my own pad —
since the time in middle school 1 ran away from home
and camped in the minivan parked out front. (Boy, did
I show them!)

Still, home is home and last weekend I was totally stoked to leave my
apartment on campus and go home to Huntington Beach. I got to see my
old friends, hang out at Newport and shovel a plateful of The Harbor
House's "Hobo Potatoes" at 2 a.m., just what 1 needed after a summer that
went by too fast. I'm actually beginning to believe my friend Jeremy's
theory about shrinking time — time feels like it goes by faster as we get
older... a day when you're five is a heck of a lot longer than a day when
you're 50.
Well, 1 went home and did everything I wanted to do, saw everybody
I wanted to see and got no sleep in the process. And as I said goodbye to
Rachel, Zack and before returning to campus, I said something very
peculiar. Something that made me stop and think about the future, my
future — my identity. Before I boarded the commuter flight back to San
Jose, I shouted "I'll call you when I get home!" It was like a bad scene in
a bad movie where the victim screams in slo-mo. I quickly recovered and
said, "Did I just say that? Home? I really mean, Stanford. I'll call you
when I get to Stanford. I'm leaving home, not going home! Whoops."
Could it be? Could Stanford really be home now? The Bay Area is a
nice place to go to school, but home? Well, yeah. I never imagined that this
would happen, but after three years in school and a summer working in San
Francisco, I call the Bay Area home. And it's not because I'm stuck here.
This truly is the best place for school, in the best place on earth. Why?
Diversity.
It's a word with which we have a love-hate relationship. It's overused,
has Ux) many connotations, and we're not sure whether we should be
proud or ashamed of it.
Every Stanford student knows the "D" word. We are bombarded with
the concept from our earliest exposure to the University. Personally, I
value it, 1 embrace it, I enjoy it, I need it.
But what exactly is diversity? It is our strength as a community —

diversity of race, thought, even geography. It's a community that would
never want to be color-blind, but more importantly wants to be color-sen
sitive. It's a place where no one is afraid to challenge another's beliefs and
ideas in a respectful manner. It's an area where skiing and surfing is all
within driving distance. It's Dim Sum in Chinatown for brunch, the
Japanese Tea Garden after Opera in the Park, and then over to Oakland
for Roscoe's world-famous Chicken and Waffles (greens too) for dinner.
I'm not saying this is paradise, it's just as good as it gets. To be true,
I've met my share of racist trash (white or otherwise) at Stanford, and I
lived in a dorm with a perverted "cyber-stalker." The recent sexual assault
on campus has reminded us that it's too easy to forget that we're vulner
able and need to take precautions. No place is perfect. But without a
doubt, the Bay Area is fertile ground for social, intellectual and recre
ational growth. We're proud of where we are, and who we are — every
single one of us.
Therefore we have to be weary of taking more than we give and
exploiting our home. How much longer will the foothills be filled with
open trails and picnic benches? How many elderly ladies have to pick
cans out of the trash by Union Square before we realize the strange juxta
position of excess wealth and absolute poverty? How many more students
have to be turned away from higher education before we stop, think and
realize "Oh yeah, racism does still exist?" There's no room for compla
cency, even at home.
As I prepare for a year of wrapping up DRs and numerous (fingers
crossed) job interviews, I ponder life in D.C., New York, even Los Ange
les. But in my heart, I don't think I can leave the Bay Area for long. I care
too much and want to change so much more.
And what of Huntington Beach? I used to be racked with guilt, as if I
was having some kind of sick affair with the Bay Area behind my home
town's back. Well, I still can go back to HB to recharge. There's nothing
like sinking your feet into the soft, hot sand and running through old
memories with good friends. Home really is one of the few constants in
life. Even if San Andreas slips tonight and HB really does fall into the
ocean — home, HB, will always be. But I'm back in my suite, and despite
all that new blacktop (that shiz reaks) on campus, it's good to be home.
