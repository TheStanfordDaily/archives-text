Daily's Chelsea Clinton policy to be commended

Responsible journalism urged
1 wish to send you my Congrats on a policy that more papers should
take. I am a former college journalist and editor. I applaud you for having
a "gag-order" where Chelsea is concerned. Especially with the recent
activities revolving around the press handling of celebrities, it is refreshing
to find that young journalists are once again finding the line between news
worthyness and gossip reporting.
Again thanks for restoring my faith in my field of love, 1 hope to work
with you someday in the professional world.

I found this on the net. It said:
"Don't look for news about Chelsea Clinton in Stanford University's

school paper: The editor is promising to treat the first freshman like any
other student."
As a former Daily staff member (I was circulation manager in 1968 and
1969) I certainly hope you won't give Chelsea an undue attention!
I well remember being at Stanford and meeting students who had only
a first name. In 1965-1969, this was unusual. But I quickly discovered that
the first-name only students had last names such as Roosevelt or Salk.
There was then, as I hope is still, a certain sort of democratic elitism to
Stanford — you had the grades to get in, and we are going to treat you like
any other high-achiever.
My parents did not have names that were in Newsweek or the papers. I
remember feeling somewhat sympathic for the students with famous par
ents — the students who had no last names!
1 was pleased to read your viewpoint on this issue.
