Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott delivered
a keynote address on the emergence of a new Russia
during a conference titled "NATO After Madrid: Look
ing to the Future."
The conference to consider challenges confronting
NATO in the post-Cold War era, held at the Faculty
Club Friday, was organized by former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, former Carnegie Endow
ment for Peace President David Hamburg and Stanford
Engineering-Economic Systems Prof, and former De
fense Secretary William Perry.
Talbott urged the representatives from government
and academia to adopt a "strategic patience" policy to
ward Russia.
"Our goal, like that of many Russians, is to see Rus
sia become a normal modern state," said Talbott.
According to Talbott, achieving that goal requires
giving Russia time to integrate with the Western
world.
Talbott explained that the roots of Russian separa
tion lie in the nation's history and cited the three cen
turies of Russia's subjugation to the "Golden Horde"
from Central Asia. Talbott also added that some of Rus
sia's historical problems have been internal.

"It missed the advent of the modern nation-state in
the 16th century, the Enlightenment in the 18th century
and the Industrial Revolution of the 19th," said Talbott.
"The Bolshevik coup d'etat plunged Russia into mis
ery, brutality, isolation and confrontation with the out
side world."
Talbott added that the United States has a vested in
terest in Russia's joining the Western world.
"We are not simply neutral bystanders," argued Tal
bott. "We want to see the ascendancy of Russia's re
formers who look outward and forward rather thar. in
ward and backward for the signposts of national re
vival."
Several recent events point to Russia's self-libera
tion from Soviet communism, said Talbott.
"With Boris Yeltsin's victory (in the most recent
presidential election) over Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist electoral tide began to recede from its high
water mark," said Talbott.
"Second, after Five years of virtual free fall, Russia's
gross domestic product seems Finally to be stabilizing
and may be registering a real upturn."
Talbott also pointed to the end of war in Chechnya
and the May signing of the NATO-Russia Founding
Act as indicators of Russia's integrationist philosophy.
Talbott lauded the United States' facilitation of Rus
sia's progress.

"For our part, we are doing what we can to ensure
that the international community is as open as possible
to Russia," said Talbott.
Talbott cited as examples of the United States' lead
ership in this area President Clinton's joint work with
President Yeltsin toward Russian accession in 1998 to
the World Trade Organization and the inception of a di
alogue to accelerate Russia's admission to the Organi
zation of Economic Cooperation and Development.
"Integration is not an end in itself — it is a means to
an end," argued Talbot. "Now that Russia is eager to
join, the issue remains 'What kind of member is Russia
going to be?' "
Warning against the danger of the Western predis
position toward distrusting Russia, Talbot argued that
the United States must look beyond this skepticism and
work to ensure that Russia becomes a democratic na
tion.
The outward-looking nature of younger Russians
bodes well for Russia's future as a democratic member
of the world order, said Talbott.
He added that the establishment of the NATO-Rus
ria permanent council is the first step in that direction.
"This institution has real promise," said Talbott. "It
can help ensure that Europe is never again divided and
that a democratic Russia plays its rightful role in that
new Europe."
