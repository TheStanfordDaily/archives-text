After protracted negotiations, the Stanford Daily and the Uni
versity have reached a settlement in their longstanding lawsuit
over the newspaper's distribution rights.
During the 1994 World Cup soccer, the University entered
into an agreement that gave the competition's organizers the ex
clusive right to distribute programs and other material around
Stanford Stadium, where several of the matches were held.
I"he Daily had already printed 20,(XX) copies of a special
World Cup section and had to settle for distributing them in the
stadium parking lots instead.
The Daily filed suit for unspecified damages, arguing that the
exclusivity of the agreement violated its right of free speech and
its lease with the University. The lease allows The Daily to dis
tribute on campus as long it "does not physically interfere with
the free movement of persons or property at any place on cam
pus".
The lawsuit was met with considerable condemnation from
administrators, including University President Gerhard Casper

who said, "by no stretch of the imagination is this a First Amend
ment case."
The settlement reiterates The Daily's right to distribute its
newspaper and occasional supplements on the Stanford cam
pus.
Furthermore, the settlement requires that when the Universi
ty enters into negotiations with an outside party for use of the
Stanford Stadium, it must make a good faith effort to provide ac
cess by The Daily and other student publications.
If the outside party refuses such access, the University must
notify The Daily and arrange a meeting among the three parties
to discuss and negotiate access.
"1 think it's a good settlement for both parties," former Daily
Editor in Chief Sarah Katz said. "I wish it could have been over
two or three years ago when it started."
"The blame's on both sides," Katz said. Despite the lawsuit,
she added, both The Daily and the University managed to keep
the lawsuit separate from the rest of the relationship between the
two sides.
University Communications Director Terry Shepard shared
Katz's relief, and said "we're glad that's over with."
