# Media descends on Stanford
## 250 cover Clinton visit 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Two hundred fifty journalists covering President
Clinton's first visit to Stanford got their story, but they
sure didn't get much out of the Clintons.
The media spent the bulk of Friday in Ford Center be
fore being herded to the Law School's Crown Quad to
await a photo opportunity.
"Do we feel like cattle or what?" one reporter asked
rhetorically while Secret Service agents led photogra
phers toward Meyer Library.
At 2:30 p.m., after waiting nearly an hour, photogra
phers got their first opportunity to see the first family
strolling from Stern Hall past Sweet Hall and up stairs
leading to the emergency exit on the second floor of
Meyer Library.
Reporters standing behind the photographers shouted
questions at the family, exhorting the President to discuss
his day.
"All we can say is that it's great," the President said
quietly, looking toward the blue sky and the surrounding
buildings.
Many reporters, kept too faraway to hear clearly, mis
interpreted the President's only public comment the en
tire day.
"Maybe we should all stay. This is great," the Los An
geles Times reported.
" This is great, we should stay," the President said, ac
cording to Agence France Presse, an international wire
seivice.
The most interesting interpretation came from the San
Francisco Chronicle: "What a beautiful day."
Journalists were also able to attend Convocation, with
a bird's-eye view of the first family, who received a short
standing ovation as they entered the Main Quad. In his
address, University President Gerhard Casper made two
scripted references to the President and ad libbed a line
about running for reelection against a Stanford student.
As Casper quoted the French philosopher Montaigne,
photographers began madly clicking their cameras,
thinking that the President, who had closed his eyes, had
fallen asleep. However, as the quotation on life's
serendipitous path ended, the President opened his eyes
and nodded his agreement.
The Washington press corps was unhappy about the
photo opportunity arrangements and about Casper's
speech, but University officials attempted to minimize
