## Women's Center, American Indian Program, DRC get new heads 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Three community centers have new directors this year,
leaving the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Community Center as
the only center without a paid director.
Fabienne McPhail, formerly of the Black Community Ser
vices Center, will be the Women's Center's first-ever director.
Winona Simms has come from the University of North Dako
ta to head the American Indian and Alaska Native Program Of
fice. And Joan Bisagno's temporary position as head of the
Disability Resource Center has become permanent.
Women's Center
McPhail will lead the Women's Center in a half-time posi
tion, working afternoons to supervise and coordinate the cen
ter's activities.
She says that two of her interests for the center are sup
porting students in their academics and reaching out to other
community centers.
"The Women's Center can't exist in isolation, and we're
going to be working in collaboration with other centers and
student organizations," she said.
McPhail comes to the Women's Center from the Black
Community Services Center. Before coming to Stanford, she
lectured in women's studies and black studies at San Francis
co State University and taught at the California Institute for In
tegral Studies.
Some students involved with the center have long request
ed a full-time director. Formerly, the center was supervised by
a graduate student coordinator.
"They've run it as a collective, and this year we're going to
be making a transition," McPhail said. "We're going to need to
discuss together what it means to have an administrator and
how 1 can support their concerns."
American Indian Program Office
Winona Simms said that coming to Stanford from North
Dakota was a huge culture shock for her. However, the new di
rector of the American Indian and Alaska Native Program Of
fice said this experience may help her relate to students in a
similar position.
"For a lot of freshmen, coming to Stanford is like jumping

into ice water," Simms said.
Helping students make a successful transition into an often
intimidating academic environment is one of Simms' main
goals.
She believes that strong counseling and mentorship pro
grams help ease the transition to college life.
"Role models are important for the future of native people,"
Simms said. "Our youth and our students are our most valuable
resource."
Before coming to Stanford, Simms worked at the Universi
ty of North Dakota's counseling department. She also has ten
years of experience as a university administrator in charge of
retention and recruitment.
Simms said that encouraging academic excellence will also
be a focus for the program office.
"I don't see any reason why our community shouldn't have
a 100 percent retention rate," she said, adding that every stu
dent at Stanford has the skills and abilities to excel here.
Disability Resource Center
Joan Bisagnoofthe Disability Resource Center gained job
security this summer when her interim position as head of the
center was made permanent. She has been the acting director
for more than a year.
Bisagno's appointment is a step toward stability for a cen
ter that some disabled students feel has had a high staff
turnover rate.
In a meeting with Dean of Students Marc Wais last spring,
several students expressed their concern that constant staff
changes affected the quality of the center's services.
Future LGBCC director?
LGBCC community members have lobbied for years to
gain a permanent director for their center.
Now that the Women's Center has its first-ever director, the
LGBCC is the only campus center without a University-ap
pointed director.
Courtney Lake, the media liaison for the center, is disap
pointed that a director was not appointed for this year, but
hopes that the center will get a leader at some point.
"We submitted a proposal to Dean of Students Marc Wais
last spring and are in the process of revising it now,"
said.
