About 250 journalists and an unde
termined number of Secret Service
agents descended on campus Fri
day along with President Clinton,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and their daughter, freshman
Chelsea Clinton. The media's only
chances for contact with the Clin
tons came at a photo opportunity
outside Meyer Library and at Con

of the day, reporters called the
Ford Center home for a day as
Chelsea moved into her home for
the year.
