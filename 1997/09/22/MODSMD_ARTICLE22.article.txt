## Spikers sweep tourney 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team has had a
shaky preseason, and this weekend's
matches against Oklahoma and Col
orado in the Stanford Showcase at
Maples Pavilion may have shown
just why.
The Cardinal (10-2, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) probably expected
the No. 20 Buffaloes (4-4) to be more
troublesome than the unranked
Sooners (6-4). That proved not to be
the case.
Stanford looked like two differ
ent teams in the tournament, winning
with relative ease over Colorado 15-
10, 15-4, 15-4 on Saturday after
struggling somewhat on Friday night
in a 15-12, 15-10,15-6 win over Ok
lahoma.
"There were a lot of things we
needed to do better," said head coach
Don Shaw of Stanford's win over the
Sooners. "They were technical
things. Offensively we were great,
but defensively we lacked intensity.
We talked about that [before the Col
orado match, and it] was a much bet
ter night."
Indeed, the Cardinal's offense
was firing on all cylinders against
Oklahoma. Stanford jumped out to a
4-0 lead in game one against the
Sooners but could never quite pull
away. The Card led 8-4 and 12-8 be
fore squeaking out a 15-12 win.
The second game proved to be
more difficult, as the Stanford de
fense had trouble with the surpris
ingly simple Sooner offense.

Junior Sarah Neal squeezes off a bump pass in the Cardinal's
straight-game victory over Oklahoma on Friday.
"It should've been really easy to de
fend, but we made it hard on ourselves,"
said senior setter and team co-captain
Lisa Sharpley. "We've had some off
practices, and that shows in your games.
It's something we definitely need to
work on. I think our offense looked good
on both nights. Our defense was the dif
ference."
Oklahoma led 5-3 and 10-9 in game
two, but senior middle blocker Paula
McNamec and sophomore outside hitter
Kerri Walsh combined for four kills, and
treshman middle blocker Jennifer Det
mer got the game-ending solo block as
the Card rattled oft five unanswered
points to take the game.
"I think we shut down for a while,"
said senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl.
"They never gave up on the ball. Their
hitters did a great job of hitting where we
weren't, and we did a poor job of block
ing."
Stanford came out of intermission

ready to go and jumped on the Sooners
for a 6-1 lead that the Cardinal stretched
to 11-4 on the hitting of Walsh and
Folkl, who each finished the match with
19 kills. ITie Sooners only managed two
more points before Stanford middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika ended the match
at 15-6 with a block.
"I think it's a sign of a great team
when you're having a rough night and
pull it out," Folkl said. "It was a gut
check, and I think we came through."
Saturday's match against Colorado
was decidedly more of what Cardinal
fans are used to seeing. After allowing
the Buffaloes to take the first point of the
match, Stanford rattled off nine of its
own to take a comfortable 9-1 lead in
game one.
Colorado fought back to 12-9, and
the Maples contingency was probably
having Sooner flashbacks before Stan
ford finished off the game 15-10.
"Tonight was 1 ,(XX) times better than
last night, and that's not saying that
much," Ifejika said. "It definitely felt
better to execute and win in the Stanford
volleyball way."
Game one was really the only shot

the Buffaloes had, as they only managed
eight points in the next two games com
bined. Stanford mixed up the hitting and
showed some impressive defense from
the likes of sophomore outside hitter
Jaimi Gregory, who had 13 digs en route
to an 11-1 lead in game two.
From that point on, Stanford never
looked back, finishing game two 15-4
and pounding out a 10-2 lead in game
three. The Card put the Buffaloes away
15-4 to win the match and complete the
sweep of the Big 12 Conference rivals.
"We played a lot sharper today," Mc-
Namee said. "We can definitely be more
enthused about our performance. It
never feels good to win and have so
many errors. Today we stayed at our
level and set the pace of the game."
Note: The once-questionable status of
freshman setter Robyn Lewis is finally
decided. With senior co-captain Lisa
Sharpley's knee injury not improving as
much as Shaw would like, Lewis will
not redshirt this season and instead pro
vide much-needed backup at setter
along with fellow freshman Lindsay Ka
gawa.
