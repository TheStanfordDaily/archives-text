## Spikers sweep tourney 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team has had a
shaky preseason, and this weekend's
matches against Oklahoma and Col
orado in the Stanford Showcase at
Maples Pavilion may have shown
just why.
The Cardinal (10-2, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) probably expected
the No. 20 Buffaloes (4-4) to be more
troublesome than the unranked
Sooners (6-4). That proved not to be
the case.
Stanford looked like two differ
ent teams in the tournament, winning
with relative ease over Colorado 15-
10, 15-4, 15-4 on Saturday after
struggling somewhat on Friday night
in a 15-12, 15-10,15-6 win over Ok
lahoma.
"There were a lot of things we
needed to do better," said head coach
Don Shaw of Stanford's win over the
Sooners. "They were technical
things. Offensively we were great,
but defensively we lacked intensity.
We talked about that [before the Col
orado match, and it] was a much bet
ter night."
Indeed, the Cardinal's offense
was firing on all cylinders against
Oklahoma. Stanford jumped out to a
4-0 lead in game one against the
Sooners but could never quite pull
away. The Card led 8-4 and 12-8 be
fore squeaking out a 15-12 win.
The second game proved to be
more difficult, as the Stanford de
fense had trouble with the surpris
ingly simple Sooner offense.
