## Late comeback finally beats Oregon State 
### Dave Flemming 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — For 59 minutes Saturday after
noon, Stanford was reliving a nightmare. The Cardinal woke
up just in time.
Senior fullback Greg Cornelia powered into the end zone
from 2 yards out with 27 seconds remaining to give No. 20
Stanford (2-1, 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) a thrilling 27-24
win over Oregon State on Saturday.
On a picturesque day in front of 26,244 fans in Parker Sta
dium, Stanford's comeback prevented a loss to the Beavers (1 -
1,0-1) for the second straight year and allowed the Cardinal to
escape Corvallis with its hopes for a Pac-10 title still intact.
"After [Sunday, the game] is either a W or an L. We got a
W," said head coach Tyrone Willingham. "We arc still on
track to do the things we want to do."
Stanford had to rely on a perfectly executed, pressure
filled final drive to pull out the victory.
The Cardinal got the ball at its own 22-yard line trailing
24-20 with only 4 minutes, 45 seconds left. Up to that point,
Stanford had failed to score in the second half.
On the strength of four completions to junior receiver Troy
Walters and a fourth-down sneak by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Chad Hutchinson, the Cardinal moved to the
Oregon State 38. Then Hutchinson found little-used senior
wide receiver Jimmie Johnson over the middle. Johnson
made his third career catch and sprinted 25 yards through the
Beaver secondary to the 13.
Three plays later, Stanford found itself in another do-or
die situation, facing fourth-and-two at the 5-yard line. After a
Cardinal timeout, minor chaos ensued.
After the Stanford huddle broke — and with only 20 sec
onds left on the play clock — senior running back Anthony
Bookman sprinted off the field, and senior back Mike
Mitchell hurried on. Seconds later, Mitchell took the handoff
from Hutchinson and slammed through the line for a first
down on the 2. Cornelia then scored on second down for the
win.
Stanford's last-minute offense kept the Oregon State de
fense on its heels, something that had not happened all game.
The Beavers finished the day with seven sacks, nearing their
performance of a year ago, when they sacked Hutchinson 11
times in a 26-12 win.
"I don't know what it was," said Hutchinson, who had 63
of his 171 passing yards on the final series, "but when we got
into our two-minute offense, they couldn't do as much blitz
ing as they had." 11
The last-minute heroics by the Cardinal were made neces
sary in part because of Stanford's numerous mistakes
throughout the game.
In particular, Stanford's special teams struggled. After

scoring on a 14-yard pass from Hutchinson to senior Damon
Dunn with just 14 seconds left in the first half, Stanford ap
peared headed for halftime with a 20-11 lead. But on the en
suing kickoff, the Cardinal's coverage faltered, and Oregon
State's DeShawn Williams ran 96 yards for a touchdown —
the second-longest return in Beaver history — to cut the lead
to 20-18.
Stanford's kicking teams did not fare much better. In the
first quarter, a bad snap from redshirt freshman John Sande
sailed over senior punter Kevin Miller's head, and Miller, not
realizing he had time to kick the ball, retreated 30 yards out of
the end zone for an Oregon State safety. Stanford also had an
extra point blocked.
"We put pressure on ourselves with our errors," Willing
ham said.
While the Stanford pass protection had a rough day, the of
fensive line did open some large holes for an effective run
ning game.
Bookman finished with 120 yards on 14carries, including
a 60-yard touchdown run that gave the Cardinal a 7-0 lead.
Mitchell had 102 yards on 18 carries, wearing down the Ore
gon State defense with more methodical rushes. It was the
first time since Sept. 28, 1991, that Stanford had two backs
with 100-plus yards in the same game.
"Championship teams have to run the ball," Bookman
said. "We just made up our minds to run the ball. All week we
worked on it."
Oregon State, in its first season under head coach Mike
Riley, has abandoned the wishbone offense it employed in
previous years for a more balanced attack. The new offense
gave Oregon State a spark, and the Beavers, led by star quar
terback Tim Alexander, played like a team with new life.
Alexander, who prior to this season rarely threw the ball,
passed for a career-high 229 yards and used his scrambling
ability to allow receivers to get open downfield.
"Any time you have a quarterback who is a halfback and
can throw, you've got something," said Willingham, praising
the Oregon State signal-caller. "We have to pay tribute to our
opponent. They did an excellent job."
Alexander took advantage of a Stanford secondary that
was playing for the first time without junior safety Tim Smith,
who is out for the season. To their credit, though, the defen
sive backs did not give up a touchdown pass and didn't allow
a pass of more than 27 yards. And redshirt freshman safety
Than Merrill, one of the players filling in for Smith, had a
good overall game, making two key interceptions.
In the end, Stanford found a way to win its conference
opener for only the third time in 11 years.
This week, "half of the teams in the country lost and half
won. We won," Willingham said. "Honestly, you have to
value that. It is very difficult to win."
