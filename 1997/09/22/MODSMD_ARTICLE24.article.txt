# Men's soccer rolls, women hit roadblocks
## Cardinal sweeps weekend, stays undefeated this year 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The nation's longest winning streak continued this week
end for the Stanford men's soccer team as it took home first
place in the St. Mary's Fall Soccer Classic with two wins.
Those wins included a 2-0 victory Friday over Wisconsin,
a team ranked above Stanford nationally and the 1995 nation
al champion. Stanford (7-0) also topped UC-Irvine 3-0 Sunday
to capture the tournament title with a total of five goals to St.
Mary's four.
The Cardinal now has a 12-game winning streak dating
back to last season. This fall's seven wins have come in non
conference play. Stanford meets Sacramento State on Friday in
its first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation game.
With the loss, Wisconsin fell to 3-3. The Badgers are
ranked 16th in the nation in the NSCAA / Umbro poll, which
places Stanford 23rd. In the Far West region, the Cardinal is
fifth, following Washington, UCLA, California and UC-San
Diego.
A Soccer America poll ranks the Cardinal 17th.
Wisconsin started the game strong with four shots on goal
in the first nine minutes. But after Badger midfielder Ted
Storm was ejected from the game for pulling down Stanford ju
nior forward Adam Siegman, the tide turned in the Cardinal's
favor.
Junior Simon Elliott, a transfer from New Zealand in his
first season with Stanford, connected on a penalty kick to give
the Cardinal a lead it would hold throughout the game.
Stanford kept Wisconsin on its own side of the field during
the second half, and it was only a matter of time before junior
defender Jamie Clark scored the Cardinal's second goal. It was
Gark's first goal of the season, assisted by freshman forward
Corey Woolfolk.
Clark was named the tournament offensive MVP based on
his performances in both games.
In yesterday's game, the Cardinal won its 12th match of the
season by an even greater margin. The first half passed without
a score by either team, but senior midfielder Erik Morrison
broke the silence with a goal in the 62nd minute.
The second and third scores of the match followed within
10 minutes. Junior co-captain A.J. Sauer increased his season
goal total to four when he gave Stanford a 2-0 lead, and Wool
folk followed, with an assist by sophomore defender Gerard
Davis.
The weekend s successes, add to an already-remarkable
season for the Cardinal, which broke the school record for
longest winning streak with its 10th consecutive victory last
week.
Stanford has shut out most of its opponents thanks to the
fast saves of freshman goalkeeper Adam Zapala. Zapala,
Woolfolk and Elliott have showcased a
talented group of recruits, and head
coach Bobby Clark has said more of the
freshmen will likely make their marks
as the season continues.
