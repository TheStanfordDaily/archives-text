Fall. The time that everything arrives at
Stanford: freshmen, moving vans, even el Nino.
Everything except goals, that is.
The Stanford women's socccr team dropped
yesterday's game to Wake Forest 2-1 to finish a
winless weekend at the Stanford / Nike Invita
tional at New Maloney Field. The Cardinal also
fell to New Mexico 1-0 on Friday.
For the Card, it was more of the same: tons
of chances, but few goals.
After last weekend's 1-1 performance at the
Clemson Invitational, the No. 11 Cardinal (3-4)
was hoping to return to its home turf and deal
lovses to unranked New Mexico on Friday and
No. 10 Wake Forest yesterday. But things

didn't go as planned for Stanford, which lost
both matchups.
Most significant about the losses was the
continuation of the Cardinal's week-long scor
ing drought. After being shut out against South
ern Methodist last weekend in a 1-0 overtime
loss, Stanford didn't score against New Mexico
— losing in sudden-death overtime for the sec
ond game in a row — and managed only one
late goal against Wake Forest yesterday.
But Coach Steve Swanson upheld that the
team was outshooting opponents consistently
and just needed to brush up on finishing skills.
"The [scoring] problem would be vastly dif
ferent if we weren't getting the chances to
score," he said. "We would have a big problem
if we weren't making chances. We just have to
concentrate on little things individually.

"We should be able to sort this out."
Sophomore midfielder Ronnie Fair agreed
with Swanson in portraying the problem as a
fixable one.
"Sometimes you get unlucky," she said.
"But the goals are something that should come
to us, with this many chances."
I*he scoring problem was evident in Friday's
game against New Mexico, as the Cardinal was
blanked by the (6-1).
The two teams played the full W) minutes in
a scoreless tie. It wasn't until eight minutes into
overtime that New Mexico senior I-auric Hege
dom booted a goal past Stanford goalie Erin
Bryla for the 1 -0 victory.
Despite the loss, Stanford outshot the Lobos
18-7.
