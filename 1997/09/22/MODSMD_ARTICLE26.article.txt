### Allison Otto Staff writer 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team suffered its first two defeats
of the season over the weekend against
No. 4 Pepperdine but salvaged the
weekend with a fifth-place finish and
victories over Claremont, UC-Santa
Barbara and UCLA in the Southern
California Tournament at USC.
In a non-conference matchup Fri
day at Pepperdine, Waves senior driver
Jack Kocur got things started on a 9-2
Pepperdine victory when he netted a
man-advantage goal and a 4-meter
penalty shot early in the first quarter to
give Pepperdine a 2-0 lead. The Waves
then catapulted to a 6-0 lead before
Stanford sophomore driver Andy Wal
burger netted the Cardinal's first goal
with seven seconds remaining in the
first half.
Although Stanford senior holeman
Nathan Osborn tallied a point during
the second half, Pepperdine used an
overpowering defense to keep the Car
dinal at bay, while advancing its lead
by three to account for the final score.
Pepperdine "put together a tremen
dous effort on defense, and we did a
great job of converting our man-advan
tage scoring chances in the first half,"
said Waves head coach Terry Schrocd
er. "We forced Stanford into taking a
number of low-percentage shots."
The Cardinal (4-2) easily defeated
Claremont 8-2 on Saturday in the open
ing match of the Southern California
Tournament at USC's McDonald's
Swim Stadium.
After the Stags tied the game 1-1
just 40 seconds into the first quarter, the
Cardinal sprinted ahead, netting seven
straight goals before the Stags tallied a
point with 1 minute, 44 seconds left in
the game.
The Cardinal faced off against Pep
perdine later that afternoon in a re
match of Friday's game. The Waves
once again jumped to an early lead as
junior 2-meter man Jeremy Pope
