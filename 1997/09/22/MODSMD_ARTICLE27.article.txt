# Field hockey takes 2 of 3

### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Sarah Medeiros, Justina Williams
and Carey Cloyd returned to the Stan
ford field hockey team last week after a
stint with the U.S. Junior World Cup
squad. But Monique Leroux stole the
headlines by posting three goals in St.
Louis as the Cardinal improved to 3-4
with two wins in three games on the Bil
likens' artificial turf.
Only Northwestern spoiled the per
fect trip with a 4-0 trouncing of Stanford
on Thursday. The Cardinal routed host
St. Louis 3-0 on Wednesday to open the
tourney, and rebounded from the North
western loss by toppling No. 7 Ball State
3-1 on Saturday.
A meeting with winless Miami
(Ohio) closed the trip yesterday. Details
of that game were not available at press
time.
Stanford's defense controlled the

contest with St. Louis, as the Billikens
managed just two shots on goal, both in
the second half. Meanwhile, Leroux, a
junior forward, registered seven by her
self and scored Stanford's first goal with
25 minutes, 40 seconds remaining in the
opening half on assists from sophomore
Mallory Chambers and Medeiros, a ju
nior.
Freshman Michelle Scott scored an
unassisted goal with 17:23 to go in the
game, and sophomore Lindsey Duna
gan closed out the scoring with 4:22 left
with an assist from Williams, a junior
midfielder.
Northwestern provided a stiffer chal
lenge on Thursday. The Wildcats scored
three times in a span of 8:36 in the first
half, and Shanel Gohlser scored for the
second time with 17 minutes to go in the
match to cement a 4-0 triumph.
Senior goalkeeper Kellie Naylor,
who made just one save against the Bil
likens, stopped seven Wildcat attempts

before freshman Meg Crowley finished
the match.
Stanford mustered just two shots on
goal in the first half and six for the game,
while Northwestern tallied 12 on the af
ternoon.
The Cardinal survived a barrage of
shots from Ball State — a favorite in the
Western Division — in Saturday's
game as Naylor made eight first-half
saves. Stanford carried a 1-0 lead into
intermission thanks to Leroux's goal
midway through the first half, which
was assisted by senior midfielder Paige
Mader.
Leroux's second goal came with
25:02 left in the contest off an assist
from Chambers, and Cloyd extended the
lead 15 minutes later with an assist from
sophomore defender Julie Gwozdz.
Only a late score by Ball State's Kerri
Schoultz spoiled the shutout, but the
Cardinals posted 16 shots on goal to
Stanford's 10.
