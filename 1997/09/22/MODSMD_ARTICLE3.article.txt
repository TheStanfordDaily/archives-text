# Clinton extols charter schools

### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
As part of his visit to the Bay
Area, President Clinton announced
more than $40 million in grants for
public charter schools Saturday at the
San Carlos Charter Learning Center.
I*he president, with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton joined a
panel of educators, parents and stu
dents — as well as Oracle Corp. CEO
Uirry Ellison and U.S. Rep. Anna
Eshoo, D-Calif. — on a panel dis
cussing the benefits of charter
schools.
Charter schools are free and open
to all students but generally require
parent involvement. In return for
promising higher proficiency among
students, districts often give the
sch(K)ls more freedom to use alterna
tive teaching methods.
Eshoo, whose congressional dis
trict includes Stanford, congratulated
the Clintons, in the area to drop off
their daughter at Stanford for her fresh
man year, for sending Chelsea to "one of
the best charter schools in the country."
"We'll take good care of Chelsea
here," Eshoo said.
In her introductory remarks, Hillary
Clinton thanked the crowd for attending
the session on a Saturday morning, say
ing, "We just dropped our own daughter
off at college, so we're looking for our
own diversions."
Public school choice is a cause the
Clintons have championed since 1983. In
1994, the federal government amended
the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, authorizing funds for charter school
development. The funding Clinton an
nounced Saturday will provide for sever
al hundred more schools to open in the
next year.
The San Carlos Charter Learning

Center, which currently has about 130
students, was the first charter school to
open in California after the state legisla
ture passed a law in 1992 allowing the
schools.
Clinton called charter schools "an im
portant part of helping us lift our stan
dards ... as we enter the 21st century."
But for that to happen, he said, the na
tion needs a set of academic standards as
well as grassroots school-based reform.
Clinton recently has called for voluntary
nationwide standardized testing in read
ing and math.
"Excellence in education is more than
money," he said.
By 2000, up to 4,000 more charter
schools could be opened if all states pass
laws allowing them, Clinton said. This, in
turn, would have a "seismic effect," he
said. "This movement can sweep the
country."
Keeping ahead technologically also
will be important, Clinton said, thanking
Ellison, who promised his company

would donate $100 million for network
computers in schools around the country.
Several speakers noted Stanford's im
portance in the charter school movement.
Stanford Education Prof. Henry Levin
has been central in developing the notion
of "accelerated standards"—a theory ac
cording to which all students are treated
as gifted.
Panelist Greg Miller, a seventh grade
student at the San Carlos school, also
mentioned that Stanford is used as a re
source, with professors and graduate stu
dents teaching classes and offering their
expertise.
Making use of community resources,
along with concepts such as parent in
volvement, have all been part of the cul
ture of American education, the first lady
said, but some of those ideas have been
lost in bureaucracy.
What President Clinton wants, she
said, is for "every school — whether it is
called a charter school or not —to act like
one."
