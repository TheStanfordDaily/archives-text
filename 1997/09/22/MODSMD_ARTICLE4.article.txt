### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
Amid pomp, circumstance and the clicking of pho
tographic shutters, University President Gerhard
Casper welcomed new students and their parents Fri
day during Stanford's 107 th Convocation.
To the strains of "Hail, Stanford, Hail," an audience
of more than 5,000, including President Clinton and

first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, packed the Quad to
watch Stanford dignitaries in their ceremonial robes of
ficially open the University's academic year.
In his annual speech, Casper told his audience about
the many opportunities available to a Stanford student
and the difficulties of choosing among them.
The Class of 2()01, he pointed out, had already made
important choices that placed them in college and at
Stanford. But once on the Farm, Casper said, those

paths must necessarily diverge as students scatter their
efforts and attentions, investing them in only a small
fraction of the available opportunities.
"The main conundrum you face is this: In order to
make the right choices, you have to search widely,
while keeping in mind that — measured hy the quality
and intensity of your experience and the sense of bal-
ance in your lives — less may be more,"
he said.
ITiat tradition of opportunity, ac
cording the Casper, is the result of the
generosity of many generations of stu
dents.
"Stanford is nourishing because
many of your predecessors, now alumni,
have felt and presently feel a moral
obligation to give something back to
Stanford," he said.
One beneficiary of that generosity
spoke before Casper. New Student Ori
entation Coordinator Blake Harris, a
senior, used his brief remarks to en
courage students to honestly explore
their environment.

"While you are here I urge you not to
find yourself," he said. "And please
don't invent yourself. Stanford allows
you to be yourself."
Harris's remarks, as well as the entire
Convocation proceedings, were attend
ed by more than 250 members of the
local and national media, many comb
ing the crowd alter ceremonies conclud
ed for comment on the first family's
presence.
But the audience greeted the press
with apprehension, many avoiding cam
eras and reporters as they left the Quad.
And Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya received warm ap
plause when he noted that the "real news
story of the day," with glances to the
Clintons and the assembled photogra
phers, was Stanford's new class of "out
standing freshmen."
