# More blue phones added

### Katie Chang 
In the second phase of a project developed last
year, 25 blue emergency phones will be placed
along Escondido Road and side streets such as
Bowdoin Street and Mayfield Avenue.
According to Police Lt. Dencil Bandy, phones
will be activated as they are installed, with the last
to be in place by the new year.
A few phones will be put in service each week,
he added. Currently, the phones are being ordered,
and work has begun to install them.
Several emergency phones were installed
around the front of the campus last summer in the
first phase of the project.
Each phase costs about $350,(XX) and if funding
continues, a third group of phones will be installed.
Bandy said he hoped the campus will be ringed
with emergency phones by fall of next year.
The idea of emergency phones was originally
suggested by senior Bill Shen, last year's ASSU
president.
"Crime isn't one of the top concerns here on
campus, which puts us in a position where we be
come complacent about crime," Shen said. "It's a
wise move for the University to invest in campus
safety, and the returns can't be measured."

It is important for pedestrians to be
able to signal for help at any time.'

frey Cox is working toward the installation of this
second set of emergency phones.
"In a campus as spread-out as Stanford's it is
important for pedestrians to he ahle to signal for
help at any time," Cox said. "Wc think the program
has been a success and are delighted to he able to
expand it," he added.
Bandy estimated that the phones were used
about six times during last year for actual emergen
cies. In one instance, a student heard screaming
nearby and used an emergency phone to alert the
police.
Though the officer found that it was a false
alarm, Bandy emphasized the importance of the
phones as a safety measure.
"Response from the public is real positive," said
Bandy. "People who take those travel routes |with
installed emergency phones] feel much safer, and
the perception of safety is important. I want people
to feel safe "
