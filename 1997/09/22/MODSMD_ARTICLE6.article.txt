# ASSU leaders want 'concrete impact' in the year ahead
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Ihe leadership of the ASSU wants to
prove the cynics wrong: Confrontation is
out, and cooperation is in.
ASSU President Emily Andrus and
Vice President lien Decker, both seniors,
who won a slim majority in last year's
three-way election, have an ambitious
list of objectives for their term in office.
"We want to improve student ser
vices; we want to improve education for
undergraduates and graduates. And we
want to empower students to effect
change," Andrus said.
Many of the initiatives the two are
planning in order to attain these objec
tives will be rolled out in the upcoming
months.
"We are focusing," said Decker, "on
a concrete impact on the Stanford experi
ence."
Among the projects that the pair have
worked on this summer is a plan to host a
career fair that will afford students ma
joring in the humanities and social sci
ences the opportunity to meet and inter
view with companies interested in hiring
students with their backgrounds.
"'[here are not enough opportunities
for some majors. We are working with
the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter on getting a career fair that does not
only hx'us on business and engineering,"
Andrus said.

She and Decker have also pushed fc
a higher level of student representatioi
within the University. Ihe Universit;
maintains a number of standing commit
tees that discuss and make decisions or
issues relevant to the campus communi
ty.
Student representatives can serve on
many of them, but these positions are
often unfilled for long periods, some
thing Andrus and Decker say they hope
to change.
The two have already met with sever
al of the students who sit on those com
mittees to discuss their plans and rein
force communication and cooperation
between student representatives and the
ASSU.
Additionally, this summer the ASSU,
in conjunction with Stanford Student En
terprises, sent incoming students a mail
er describing the opportunities available
to freshmen in both organizations.
According to Decker, more than half
of incoming freshmen participated in
high school student government, and the
freshman class is historically the most
vocal and actively involved. Ihe mailer
sought to harness that enthusiasm.
"Students are not aware of how pow
erful student participation can be. We've
been taking steps to ensure students get a
voice in the University," said sophomore
Matt Spence, senate deputy chair.
Spence plans to strengthen the fresh
man associates program, which offers
freshmen interested in being senators the
opportunity to learn about the position.
"Each freshman senator will be paired
with a voting senator and work closely
with [Spence]," Decker said.
Andrus and Decker meanwhile are

taking steps to form freshman executive
positions. Currently, class offices are
first elected for sophomore year.
"Some way through the fall quarter
we can expect a freshman executive
body." said Decker.
Above all, Andrus and Decker think
that this year will be a refreshing change
from last year, when senate sessions
were often combative and former ASSU
President Bill Shen's office was plagued
by financial scandal.

We are not "focusing on big crusades
but getting the ASSU in order," said
Decker in an election interview with The
Daily.
Of the thirty senators, only four are
incumbents. With so many rookies, there
is a feeling of cooperation within the sen
ate and the executive leadership, accord
ing to the three.
"An important part of our vision is an
ASSU that coordinates among itself,"
Decker said.
