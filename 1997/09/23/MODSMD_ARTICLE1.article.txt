## Students question Cowell commitment after firing 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
A decision not to renew the contract of one of Cow
ell Student Health Center's most popular female physi
cians has generated widespread student concern.
Law and medical students, as well as undergradu
ates, reacted with disappointment when Cowell failed
to rehire Dr. Susan Anderson, an internist who special
izes in women's health, sports medicine and interna
tional health, travel and tropical wilderness medicine.
Students would line up for appointments with An-

derson, who acted as a mentor and role
model to the students she served.
After four years at Cowell, Anderson
was informed in June that her contract
had not been renewed due to "staff
problems," she said.
The five physicians at Cowell work
under year-to-year contracts, which
are renewed annually by Cowell Di-

rector Ira Friedman. Anderson said that to her knowl
edge, contracts are generally renewed without much
discussion.
Friedman declined to comment specifically on the
Anderson case.
"Personnel matters concerning individual employ
ees are confidential, and it wouldn't be appropriate for
me to discuss them," Friedman said.
Students who had interacted with Anderson said she
had a commitment to teaching that extended beyond
her basic duties as a clinician.
"I think [Anderson] was so popular among law stu
dents because she was a role model for combining acad
emia with other careers," said Erin Sawyer, a third-year
law student who has been a patient of Anderson's since
she was an undergraduate at Stanford.
According to Sawyer, Anderson became widely
popular with law students, mainly by word of mouth.
Sawyer said she had recommended Anderson to many
of her friends.
Another student, senior Naoko Nishitani, said, "I
think it's an outrage and a disgrace to the University
that it has released one of our finest and most support
ive medical practitioners."
Anderson has devoted much of her time at Stanford
to working with medical students and undergraduates.

"A staff physician at Cowell
should be teaching and mentoring,"
Anderson said, "It makes sense on a
University campus."
Anderson is an adviser in the
Human Biology Program and teach
es a required first-year seminar in
the Medical School, "Physician and
Patient."
She also developed a class for

third-year Medical School residents,
which sends them to work at Cowell
for one-month stints. The class, An
derson said, has become one of the
school's most popular electives.
Before she found out she would
not be returning to Cowell, Ander
son had been trying to make her posi
tion at Cowell "more academic," she
said, by incorporating mentoring, re
search and teaching into the job.
Currently, students in the Law
and Medical schools are circulating a
petition that advocates changing the

way in which contracts at Cowell are
renewed to a system that involves
student input.
According to Sarah Morgan, a
medical student and member of a
Stanford chapter of the American
College of Women's Health Physi
cians, student representation on
committees deciding on contract re
newal is especially important at
Cowell because the clinic is "an insti
tution that interacts with students."
Although Anderson will no
longer work at Cowell, the Medical

School's Office of Medical Educa
tion has hired her to a part-time
teaching position.
"We are trying to help her
through this tough time," said Elliott
Wolfe, director of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs at the Medical School.
"She is a superb physician,"
Wolfe said. "I believe exactly what
the students say. The administrators
at Cowell disagree."
