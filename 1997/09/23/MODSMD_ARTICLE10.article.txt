More trouble on Mir
MOSCOW (AP) — Troubles arrived in threes yes
terday at the Mir space station, just three days before
the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis is to be launched on a
visit to the ailing station.
First the Mir's main computer failed for the third
time in three weeks. I*hat problem was followed by
two new ones: the failure of a carbon dioxide removal
system and the appearance of a mysterious leak of
brown fluid.
Those on the Mir — two Russians and American
astronaut Michael Foale — were not in danger, space
officials insisted, and, as planned, NASA began its
countdown for Thursdays Atlantis launch.
"We would strongly dislike it if the shuttle launch is
postponed, because it is to bring a new computer and
other spare parts," said Viktor Blagov, deputy Rus
sian Mission Control chief.
However, the docking will only be possible if the
Mir's capricious computer functions properly
throughout the procedure — which is far from certain.
"It functions for one week, and then it gives us a
surprise like it did this morning," Blagov said at a
briefing. "It's difficult to forecast how the computer
will behave in the future."
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who met with visiting Vice President A 1 Gore for eco
nomic talks yesterday, sought to downplay the Mir's
woes.

Immigration deadline nears
WASHINGTON (AP) — Immigrants living in the
United States unlawfully will have to leave the coun
try to apply for resident "green cards" unless Congress
extends a provision that expires next week.
Currently, undocumented immigrants who are eli
gible to apply for legal residence are allowed to
remain in the United States while completing their
paperwork — provided they pay a $ I,(X X) fine.
'Hie impending expiration of that provision has
caused alarm in immigrant communities. And the
Immigration and Naturalization Service is expecting a
wave of applications from people rushing to beat the
clock.
"The message is to get that application in before
Sept. 30," said Paul Virtue, the INS' acting executive
associate commissioner.
In 1994, Congress wrote a regulation allowing
undocumented immigrants to remain while applying
for permanent residence provided they pay a fine and
either be already on track for legal residence or relat
ed to a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.
The idea for the propositi was twofold: Reduce the
hardship on foreigners eligible to legalize their status
and lessen the pressure on U.S. consulates overseas
where immigrants previously applied.
'ITie Clinton administration has asked that this pro
vision be extended, but Congress has yet to decide the
issue.
