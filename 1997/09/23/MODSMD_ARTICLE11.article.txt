# Clinton backs nuclear test ban
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Clinton
sent the Senate the long-delayed global test-ban treaty
yesterday and urged lawmakers to "end all nuclear tests
for all time" by approving the pact over objections of
some Republicans.
Announcing his action in an address to the United
Nations' 52nd General Assembly, Clinton called the
treaty "the longest sought, hardest fought prize in the
history of arms control." He signed the accord a year
ago but pocketed it while White House lobbyists tried
to build support.
In a 19-minute speech to U.N. delegates, the presi
dent also called for a permanent international court to
punish human rights violators.
And he pledged that the United States would pay
nearly $1 billion in past-due U.N. fees to "put the (jues
tion of debts and dues behind us once and for all."
Returning to the theme of his I J.N. address last year,
Clinton said the nations of the world must unite against
"21st century predators." He warned, "We're all vul
nerable to the reckless acts of rogue states and to an
unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers and interna
tional criminals."
The president met privately with foreign leaders,
including Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
before heading to the Metropolitan Opera's season
opening performance of "Carmen." He returned to
Washington last night.
His submission of the test-ban treaty is expected to
stir opposition from C i( )P senators who don't trust arms
control agreements or who insist that testing is needed

tii maintain America's nuclear stockpile.
The debate probably will restore battle lines I'tom
the vote on the Clinton-backed chemical weapons
treaty, ratified in April after many lawmakers remained
undecided until the last minute. The president needs
about 22 Republican senators to join Democrats in sup
port of the treaty.
"We intend to win this vote and failure is not an
option," said Robert Bell, a senior White House aim
control adviser.
Sen. I'had Cochran, R Miss., chairman of the Ciov
ernmental Affairs subcommittee that handles this issue
said his panel will hold a hearing next week on whethci
the United States can count on its nuclear weapons i«•
work without testing.
"If it creates a more dangerous environment anil is
an incentive for others to cheat and steal a march on tin
rest of the world and puts us at risk, then we would
make a bad mistake to approve the treaty," he said.
During a U.N. visit a year ago, Clinton became tin
first world leader to approve the historic Comprehen
sive lest Ban Treaty, which prohibits all nuclear tost
explosions.
I'he United States has not conducted a nuclear test
since IW2.
I lie treaty would take effect next September. A Sen
ate vote is expected in the spring. The accord is signed
by 146 countries, including Russia and ("hina.
India is believed to posses nuclear weapons but is a
treaty holdout. Pakistan, another probable nucleai
nation, won't endorse it unless India does.
