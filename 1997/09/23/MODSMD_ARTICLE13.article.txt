## Safety concerns 
### 
As students at one of the most premier
institutions in the world, we often take
our safety for granted — we leave our
room doors unlocked when we want to pop
down to the laundry room, to go grab a bagel
in the dining hall, to run downstairs to talk to
a friend... .
Most women feel comfortable walking
around campus at night, and many feel safe
enough to take an evening jog.
In the Stanford police recorded seven
forcible sex offenses, a category that includes
rape, sexual assault with a weapon, sodomy
and forcible fondling.
Although these numbers seem small, seven
offenses is still seven too many. In the past,
however, these numbers have been too small
for the student body to notice and take action
to safeguard against violence. Doors are still
propped open, waiting to be entered.
The recent sexual assault in Stern is our
wake-up call — one that should serve as a
warning that we are not immune from vio
lence. It also comes during a time of year
when students are most vulnerable — when
they are arriving back on campus.
Students have many things to worry about
these first days back including buying books,
unpacking and picking up boxes in storage,
not to mention hooking up computers, paying
the bill and finding a job.
Keeping the main doors of our buildings
shut and locked during this time is not a con
venient thing for us to do now, especially with
moving and other fall quarter hassles. Many
entrance doors stay wide open and residents'
rooms are often unlocked.
The University and the Stanford Police
Department offer guidelines to facilitate a
safer campus. More blue emergency lights
have been added around campus, the Mar

guerite schedule has been expanded and a safe
travel route map has been issued by the police
and printed in the Daily for public benefit.
However, there are many areas in which
the University could work to further ensure a
safe campus. The 8 p.m. cut-off for the Mar
guerite and inconsistency of S.U.R.E. escort
make biking or walking the primary means of
night time travel. Additionally, inadequate
parking around some residences and the dimly
lit sidewalks, caused in part by construction,
along main thoroughfares like Santa Theresa
create unnecessary risks for students.
While its true that later hours for the Mar
guerite and more shuttles for S.U.R.E. escort
could provide additional safeguards against
violence, residents should also help protect
themselves and their fellow dormmates from
crime by taking some precautions as well.
Ux'k your room at all times. This means all
of the time. It only takes someone a minute to
slide into an open door and steal a computer,
stereo or printer out of a person's room who
just stepped down the hall.
If you don't want to lock your own room,
that's your business. Hut keep others in your
house safe by always locking entrance doors
— especially now, during the most inconve
nient time for you to do it.
An inconvenient time for you is the most
convenient time for those who want to take
advantage of you.
Remember that the alleged Stern assailant
is still at large. It's your responsibility to stay
aware and to play it safe. A student's safety is
ultimately his or her own responsibility. Stan
ford, the institution, can only do so much.
Students and other residents can easily con
trol building access, and they should. By tak
ing simple precautions, you're saving yourself
from becoming the next victim.
