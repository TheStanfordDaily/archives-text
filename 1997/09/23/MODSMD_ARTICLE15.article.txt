## Chow mein, Condi and undergraduates

A pool party at Gerhard Casper's house is an
unexpected way to begin one's sophomore
year. But when my friends returned from
splashing around in the Casper pool, I jealously won
dered if I too would ever get the chance to play Marco
Polo with Gerhard. But, later that night when Provost
Condoleezza Rice taught me how to use chopsticks
over dinner at Mandarin Gourmet, all envy was gone.
That was the culmination of Sophomore College —

a two week program of seminars just for Stanford's eager sophomores.
I and more than 140 other sophomores returned to campus in early
September to take intimate classes fiom Stanford's top administrative
brass and marquee faculty. We lived down the hall from each other in
I>arkin and Donner while the University paid all costs, proving that
there is such a thing as a free lunch at Stanford — even if it is Stern
food.
Sophomore College was my best experience at Stanford so far, and I
hope every freshman will apply next year. More importantly, 1 hope
every Stanford student will be able to have experiences like this every
day.
Expanding the principles of Sophomore College will serve the cen
terpiece for the new ASSU Task Force on Undergraduate Education that
1 am helping to create this year as Deputy Chair of the ASSU Senate.
In"The Fall of Communism and the New World Order," twelve of
us listened in the Larkin lounge to Condi as she described the end of the
Cold War from her perspective, as a top advisor to President Bush. After
a year at Stanford, I had gotten used to reading editorials by Stanford
professors in The New York Times., but I hadn't gotten used to those
same professors knowing my name.
Of the 14 people involved in our class, ten were born outside the
United States. Between us, we had witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall,
boasted relatives who were Russian nuclear scientists, emigrated from
Romania, spoke fluent Russian and had a father assassinated in the 1978
Afghanistan revolution.
In the realities of University life, financial incentives favor graduate
programs — particularly federal funding for research — while under
graduates are largely ignored. In contrast to Stanford's culture of pre-

professionalism, it is refreshing to find the University standing firmly in
favor of undergraduate education.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Ramon Saldivar
described Sophomore College as an experiment with a new type of
learning. Saldivar remarked that the College is still an experiment —
one whose success depends on students sharing the experience with the
rest of the Stanford community. Here I'm helping to hold up the stu
dents' end of the bargain, but now I'm asking the University to hold up
theirs.
Stanford should insist that the opportunities of Sophomore College's
not be limited to the last two weeks of summer; its focus on undergrad
uate learning should carry over into the entire year. Eighty students
applied to Condi's class, but only 12 got in. Granted, not every Stanford
student wants to give up the two remaining weeks of their summer, but
every students who wants to should have that opportunity.
Six years ago Stanford was able to guarantee housing to undergrad
uates for four years. It was touted as a basic right in a private universi
ty. Likewise, Stanford should guarantee small classes, teaching by pro
fessors instead of TAs and a personalized education as basic tenets of a
private university. The new Stanford Introductory Seminars mark a step
in the right direction and show that more is possible in the future.
Stanford student government is taking the lead in this campaign. In
the coming weeks, the ASSU Senate will unveil a new Task Force on
Undergraduate Education. In this initiative, the highly successful ASSU
Teaching Awards will be expanded to recognize TAs as well as dedi
cated professors. Students should also be entitled to a course guide that
rates class difficulty and the professor performance, like their counter
parts at Harvard and other colleges. Undergraduates should sit on tenure
committees.
I'm not asking Condi to take everyone out for Chinese. And I know
that the pool at Gerhard's can only hold so many. But for $30,()()() a
year, it's good to know that Stanford is beginning to take steps in the
right direction.
