## New coaches hired by AD 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Maintaining the nation's most successful athlet
ics program is no easy task, but the Stanford De
partment of Athletics is doing its best to see that its
teams have the right leadership.
New faces will be found at the helm of women's
gymnastics, lacrosse and water polo this year, as
well as in the front office.
Darrin Nelson
Alumnus Darrin Nelson has been named as
an assistant athletic director. His foremost prior
ity is to head the administration of the new
NCAA policy that allows student athletes to
work part time. The policy will take effect on
Oct. 31,1998.
"It's going to be pretty difficult to administer
because you have to monitor how much they
make," Nelson said. "You have to make sure that
they're not making too much money. You also
have to be sure that they can handle it."
His primary concern regarding the new policy is
to see that students do not overburden themselves
with their priorities as employees, athletes and
most importantly, as students.
Nelson graduated from Stanford in 1981 after a
standout football career on the Farm. He is the
school's career record holder in touchdowns (40),
all-purpose running yardage (6,885), receptions
(214) and rushing yardage (4,033).
Besides overseeing the implementation of the
NCAA's new rule, Nelson also plans to take an ac
tive role in tutoring student athletes on campus, as
well as trying to publicize the Athletics Depart
ment's involvement throughout the surrounding
community.
Mark Cook
Mark Cook joins the Stanford gymnastics pro
gram after a three-year tenure as an assistant at
UCLA, the defending NCAA champions.
Despite the Bruins' success, Cook felt he would
not accomplish what he wanted until he could do so
with his own program. "I needed a head coaching
job for my goals," he said. "As an assistant, I
achieved my goals through that medium."
Cook spent 14 years as a head coach and two as
program director at the Clovis Academy of Gym
nastics in Fresno, Calif., before joining the Bruins
and is eager to finally take over a major university's
program.
Last season the Cardinal finished with a 6-7
record and placed fifth at the NCAA Western Re
gion Championships. Cook feels that he can help
the team improve into a national contender.
"One very general goal is to qualify and com
pete at the national level," Cook said. "1 want to es
tablish Stanford women's gymnastics as one of the
best teams in the country from this year forward."
