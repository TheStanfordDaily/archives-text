# Seeking help for a great sports page
## 
### 
Stanford has, hands down, the
best all-around athletics of any
college in the United States.
The University excels in everything
— from big names to Olympic
events to club sports.

The Stanford Daily sports section
has not. traditionally, been as well
rounded. There's simply not enough
page space or resources at I"he Daily
to cover every sport as in-depth as
football.
ITiis year's sports staff — manag
ing editor Bobby Cuza, co-editor F,d
Guzman and myself — is working to
change that. We want to cover more
sports with more depth, and to do
that, we're planning to expand our
coverage in several ways.
First, we're recruiting like crazy.
Perhaps inspired by the recent suc
cess of Stanford coaches like Mike
Montgomery and Don Shaw in lur
ing top-notch players to the Univer
sity, we're scouring the campus
looking for good writers who love
sports. We don't offer full scholar
ships or have our own exclusive
weight room, but we can deliver free

game passes and the chance to inter
act with some of the finest athletes in
the country.
Second, we're making better use
of our existing resources. I his col
umn is a good example. Daily sports
editors have a long history of writing
infrequent columns that may or may
not pertain to the Stanford commu
nity. Often, they focus on the nation
al sports world, writing about fa
vorite NBA teams or who's going to
win the Super Howl.
Those columns were interesting
and brought a touch of the "outside
world" to the Stanford-bent Daily
sports page. But Ed and I think we
can better use page space and our
editorial observations in the context
of the University. We're both huge
Dodgers fans, but as much as we
would love to whine about our
team's stretch drive collapse, we
won't.
Our columns will run Tuesdays
and Thursdays. and the bulk of them
will f<x'us on lower-profile sports
and athletes. We'll write about sail
ing, fencing and ultimate frisbee.
We'll spotlight walk-ons in any sport
and tell stories of inspirational ath
letes.
It's a chance to tell the school
about the teams and competitors
that play in front of few fans or toil
anonymously in practice while their
teammates own the spotlight. Both
Ed anil I are a bit biased, havmp
