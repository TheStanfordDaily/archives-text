# Seeking help for a great sports page
## 
### 
Stanford has, hands down, the
best all-around athletics of any
college in the United States.
The University excels in everything
— from big names to Olympic
events to club sports.

The Stanford Daily sports section
has not. traditionally, been as well
rounded. There's simply not enough
page space or resources at I"he Daily
to cover every sport as in-depth as
football.
ITiis year's sports staff — manag
ing editor Bobby Cuza, co-editor F,d
Guzman and myself — is working to
change that. We want to cover more
sports with more depth, and to do
that, we're planning to expand our
coverage in several ways.
First, we're recruiting like crazy.
Perhaps inspired by the recent suc
cess of Stanford coaches like Mike
Montgomery and Don Shaw in lur
ing top-notch players to the Univer
sity, we're scouring the campus
looking for good writers who love
sports. We don't offer full scholar
ships or have our own exclusive
weight room, but we can deliver free

game passes and the chance to inter
act with some of the finest athletes in
the country.
Second, we're making better use
of our existing resources. I his col
umn is a good example. Daily sports
editors have a long history of writing
infrequent columns that may or may
not pertain to the Stanford commu
nity. Often, they focus on the nation
al sports world, writing about fa
vorite NBA teams or who's going to
win the Super Howl.
Those columns were interesting
and brought a touch of the "outside
world" to the Stanford-bent Daily
sports page. But Ed and I think we
can better use page space and our
editorial observations in the context
of the University. We're both huge
Dodgers fans, but as much as we
would love to whine about our
team's stretch drive collapse, we
won't.
Our columns will run Tuesdays
and Thursdays. and the bulk of them
will f<x'us on lower-profile sports
and athletes. We'll write about sail
ing, fencing and ultimate frisbee.
We'll spotlight walk-ons in any sport
and tell stories of inspirational ath
letes.
It's a chance to tell the school
about the teams and competitors
that play in front of few fans or toil
anonymously in practice while their
teammates own the spotlight. Both

spent a lot of time in high school on
various varsity benches. But that ex
perience taught us that often the
best stories don't come from the
starting lineups, but from the color
ful characters on the sidelines.
We won't be abandoning nation
al event columns altogether, either.
Our columns will also try to fill an
other "hole" in Daily sports cover
age: keeping track of Stanford ath
letes after graduation. The Univer
sity has sent a lot of players to the
pros, and we plan to use those ath

letes as a gateway to big-time
sports.
We'll still tell you who will win
the Super Bowl, but only if we can
find the Stanford connection.
It all comes back to balance. The
Daily has long done a good job cov
ering prominent Stanford sporting
events. This volume, we're expand
ing to capture more sports personal
ities. College is unique because ath
letes are still "real" people who go to
class and hang out at parties. Spot
lighting those players is often the
best way to gain insight on sports
that many students know little
about.
It's an exciting time to be at Stan
ford, especially from a sports stand

point. We have more great teams
than any school in the country, a
school of big fish in the biggest pond.
The time has come to tell all of
their stories, to redefine the sports
section outside the mainstream.
We have lofty goals, striving for
great writing, better layout and
more comprehensive coverage. Just
as the University's teams excel on
the field, the Daily sports section
should excel in coverage.
The best athletics in the country
deserve as much.

column will appear on Tuesdays. If
you 're interested in writing for sports,
