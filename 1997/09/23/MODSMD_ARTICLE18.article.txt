# Setter key to winning
## With Sharpley limping, backups become essential 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The San Francisco 49ers crushed the Atlanta Falcons
this weekend 34-7, and any Falcons fans left in the world
learned two very important things they should've al
ready known: (1) their team is not very good, and (2)
Billy Joe Tolliver isn't much of a backup QB.
What does this have to do with Stanford women's
volleyball? Not much. Except maybe to illustrate the im
portance of having a good backup to run the offense.
Okay, so football and volleyball aren't that closely re
lated. In volleyball there's no quarterback. Instead the
setter handles the offense and calls more of her own
shots than any quarterback. But for some reason, her
role isn't even as glamorous as guiding an offense as mis
erable as the Atlanta Falcons'.
Senior co-captain Lisa Sharpley runs the much more
potent offense of the No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball
team, but in her final season, the Cardinal's third all
time assist leader is having to deal with a new hurdle in
her career — injury.
Sharpley had arthroscopic surgery on her knee in the
offseason and was cleared for play in the Card's opening
match Aug. 22. After playing in Stanford's first two
matches, Sharpley missed two weeks of action to rest her
ailing knee, then came back to play her first complete
match of the year Sept. 10 against Duke.
Despite posting a season-high 58 assists in last Fii
day's match against Oklahoma, Sharpley didn't look 1(H)
percent. Saturday against Colorado she saw limited
time, playing most of game one and briefly in game two.
"It's kind of day-to-day," Sharpley said. "On our
road tiip it was really good for almost a week and a half.
But sometimes it swells up to the point where I can't
bend. We're working really hard to manage the pain and
swelling. It's really irritated light now, but it's just a mat
ter of getting the inflammation and irritation down."
1 lere's where the roles of freshmen I .indsay Kagawa
and Robyn I ,ewis take astronomical leaps into the fore
front of Stanford's quest for back-to hack national
championships.
In Saturday's match against Colorado, head coach
Don Shaw did something even he admitted was quite
unusual for women's volleyball. I le played three diffei

ent setters in the match.
"She's not hack to 1(H) percent," Shaw said of Sharp
ley. "Say we go down with 12 players |toplay I JC'l A and
USC], and Sharpley has a rough night one night and
can't play the next. We need to have some depth at set
ter. She's not hack all the way, and we needed to get
Rohyn some experience."
I he volleyball literate world is probably turning flips
with questions like "why did Sharpley come out of the
match?" "Is she hurt too badly to play?" "What will hap
pen if she doesn't get healthy soon?"
Hut slightly less knowledgeable fans may not be
completely aware of Sharpley's importance. Sure, you
might think she's good. You've heard a lot about her;
you may even know that she's a lirst-team All-American
and three-year captain of the Stanford squad.
Hilt you probably don't realize how much of what oc
curs on the court is the setter's responsibility, The coach
has a set play for the beginning of a point, but if there are
any rallies alter that liist play, it's all on the setter.
"Whenever you have a first team All-Atnerican set
ter out, it's hard to say what one thing you miss," said se
nior outside hitter and fellow co-captain Kristin Folkl.
"We're missing her court leadership, missing her size
she's the tallest setter we have — and we're missing her
veteran, experienced play.
"She's able to read the defense and make the hitter
look really good. She's proven to be exceptional at that."
So she's the quai terback whodocsn't gel a huddle for
every play but still has to read the defense, pick an op
lion and then make the appropriate pass all in a brief in
stance. I )oesn't make Tolliver sound any better,does it?
Hut Sharpley does it, and she makes it look way too easy.
That's not to say that the freshman backups aren't
getting the job done when called upon. Kagawa led
Stanford to victory in four of five matches while subbing
for Sharpley, and Lewis had eight assists in her first
match for the ('animal on Saturday.
Hut Sharpley is the veteran; Sharpley is the All-
Ameriean. She's been there, done that and collected a
few accolades along the way. A two lime Ail-American,
Shatpley's name is painted all over the Stanford record
books, and she's arguably the best collegiate setter in the

country.
"I know Lisa is a competitor, and
I know how badly she wants to be
out there playing," Folkl said. "She's
been keeping a positive attitude. 1
know when she's out there she gives
everything she's got. When we need
her, when she really has to suck it up
for a game, I have no doubt in my
mind that she will."
