# A 						position breakdown of Stanford volleyball
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
In an attempt to clear up any confusion and make life a
little easier for all you volleyball fans, here's the position
by-position rundown of the fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team:
Setter
Senior co-captain Lisa Sharpley is quite possibly the
best setter in the game. Filtering her final year for the Car
dinal and her second year in the 5-1 offensive set, Sharpley
is third on the Stanford career assist list with 3,010. She's
third in assists for a single season (1,433) and second for a

single match (7H). She is also a two-time first-team All-
American and has tallied more than in the post
season.
The bad news where Sharpley is concerned is her
health. Knee surgery in the offseason has sidelined Sharp
ley for the first part of this season, and Stanford will defi
nitely he a weaker team if she doesn't make it back to
speed.
Lite good news for Cardinal fans are the two new faces
that have stepped up in Sharpley's absence. Freshman
I .indsay Kagawa was expected to be the backup setter and
fellow freshman Robyn Lewis was on her way to a redshirt
season when things changed.
Kagawa has started on several occasions, and lewis'

status iii no longer uncertain. She will not redshirt and even
nabbed eight assists in her first match against ('oloradolast
weekend.
Outside hitter
Senior co-captain Kiistiu Folk I and sophomore Kerri
Walsh are two of the biggest names in collegiate volleyball.
Both were considered the nation's top recruit out of high
school, and both lived up to that reputation by earning Na
tional Freshman of the Year honors in their rookie seasons.
Folk I is a three-time All American who is currently
sixth on the all lime kill list with 1,228 and has been Stan
ford's top player so far this year. I .as! season. Folk I post-
Ed a career-best 505 kills; she also re
joined the basketball team after a
one-year hiatus and helped guide
the Card to its third straight Final
Four.
Walsh put up some amazing num
bers as a freshman. Her team-leading
521 kills was the second-highest total
for a single season in Stanford history,
and she also led the team in service
aces (47) and digs (309), not to men
tion the fact that she was second in the
Pacific 10 Conference in hitting per
centage at .369.
The other hitters joining Walsh
and Folkl include senior Debbie Lam
bert and sophomores Jaimi Gregory
and Sarah Clark. After seeing limited
time as a freshman, Lambert's sopho
more campaign earned her honorable
mention All-Pac-10 honors.
Last year, Lambert split time with
Gark and Gregory. Gregory, who
also played in the back row, saw the
most action, earning 227 digs while
Lambert notched 133 kills.
Middle Blocker
Stanford's most consistent player
and its biggest loss from last season
are both found at this position.
Senior Barbara Ifejika is a three
year starter and a potential All-
American this year. Ifejika put up ca
reer-high numbers last season, with

131 block assists, 21 service aces and
12 solo blocks. She will be heavily
counted on to fill the void left by Ail-
American Eileen Murfee.
The two players competing for the
starting spot vacated by Murfee are
senior Paula McNamee and freshman
Jennifer Detmer. McNamee is a fifth
year senior and also a two-sport ath
lete on the Farm, playing basketball
with teammate Folkl.
McNamee has gotten the early
nod and played impressively, but
pushing her for that spot is Detmer, a
top-notch athlete Shaw believes will
turn into a fantastic blocker. Another
middle blocker is freshman walk-on
Alex Newell, who could also see time
at outside hitter.
Defensive Specialist
Junior Sarah Neal leads the way
in this category. Neal was a freshman
walk-on who has since earned a
scholarship. After seeing limited
time as a rookie, last season Neal
more than doubled her dig total from
'95.
Two other possible contributors in
the back row are sophomore Kather
ine Kuchenbecker and freshman
Monica Sergott, both walk-ons. Al
though Kuchenbecker didn't see
much playing time last season, she can
also come in as an outside hitter. Ser
gott has seen some early playing time
due to the injuries, and with Sharp
ley's absence could also provide some
depth at setter.

Middle blocker Paula McNamee
has helped fill the void created
by the departure of All-American
Eileen Murfee.
