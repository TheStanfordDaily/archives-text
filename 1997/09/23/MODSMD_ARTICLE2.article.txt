## GSB opens doors to diverse Class of '99 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
What do a fireman, a nationally
ranked figure skater, an NCAA
fencing champion and a soap opera
star have in common?
They and 358 others were chosen
for admission to the Class of 1999 at
the Graduate School of Business,
where a popular joke in the Admis
sions Office is that this year's class
"doesn't swim — they walk on
water."
In making their selections, the
admissions officers went through a
record-setting 6,559 applications.

Less than 7 percent of the applicants
were accepted, which again makes
Stanford's Business School one of
the most selective in the country.
According to MBA Programs
Director George Parker, this year's
class is "one of the most magnifi
cently eclectic bunches of high-ener
gy, achieving bright people."
Besides their wide-range of un
dergraduate majors, the Class of
1999 is diverse by any measure. I"he
112 women and 250 men hail from
119 different undergraduate col
leges and universities, of which Stan


Sam Mankiewicz — Dally
ford leads the way with 37 alumni,
followed by Harvard University
with 27 and the University of Penn
sylvania with 24.
I'hey have an average age of
23.35 and have on average worked
for 4.1 years before coming to busi
ness school. The students come from
35 different countries and 223 com
panies. Fifteen have earned scores
of 7HO or above out of 8(X) on the
CiMAT, and 38 have earned mas
ter's degrees.
In welcoming the class last week,
the Business School's Director of
Admissions Marie Mookini said,
"The differences among [the group]
— with respect to gender, national
origin, sexual orientation, and per
sonal and professional backgrounds
create a rich environment in
which to learn."

Members of this year's class have
worked for family businesses and
started them. One student claims
credit for the Madonna's hair acces
sories in "Evita," while another stu
dent designed the World Wide Web
page for the NBA.
These future CEOs have worked
for Noah's Bagels and Starbucks
Coffee and earned pilots' licenses.
One student has quite literally been
a rocket scientist.
"It's a time of real excitement to
have a diverse group of people who
have been doing really interesting
things with their lives join us for a
few years," said Assoc. Dean of
Academic Affairs Robert Flana
gan.
In selecting candidates for admis
sion, the Business School Admis
sions Office reviewed 13,118 essays
and 19,677 letters of recommenda
tion. Parker expected next year's ap
plicant pool to be about the same
size, if not greater.
