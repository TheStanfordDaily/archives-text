### 
The Stanford men's golf team kicked off its 1997-98
season last weekend at the rain-plagued William H.
Tucker Invitational in Albuquerque, N.M.
It wasn't quite the splashy start the Cardinal had
hoped for.
Stanford finished 22nd out of 23 schools in the rain
shortened tournament, a collective 51 strokes behind
tournament champion Georgia Tech. The tournament
was shortened from four rounds to three due to rain and
lightning storms at The Championship Golf Course last
Friday.
The Cardinal finished out of sight, 36-over-par. Geor
gia Tech finished at 15-under-par, blowing away second-

place Arkansas by eight strokes. Only Air Force finished
lower than Stanford.
Sophomore Dusty Brett shot a 74-73 —147 to finish
tied for 41st place, the best individual showing among
the Cardinal. Junior Joel Kribel shot 73-NO--153 and fin
ished tied for 92nd.
Freshman David Searle finished tied for Wth (76-
79—155) and sophomore Tyler Lunke was 109 th (75-
82—157).
New Mexico's Doug La Belle, playing on his home
course, tied for the individual title along with Okla
homa State's Edward Loar. Both shot a seven-under
137.
