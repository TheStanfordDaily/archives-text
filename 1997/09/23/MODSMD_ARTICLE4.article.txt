The new Tresidder Fitness Cen
ter opened its doors to Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff yesterday.
The new gym and exercise center is
located on the first floor of Tresid
der Union, next to Polio Rey.
The new fitness center is the re
sult of a summer construction pro
ject that moved the Pulse, the copy
ing and printing vendor, to another
first-floor location.
" There was a committee of peo
ple that helped plan the room," with
representatives from the communi
ty, including students, according to
Fred Stephens, strength training
coach and manager of the center.
"Today was just an official open
ing for use. We will have a grand
opening at some point," though the
exact date of the ceremony has not
yet been determined, Stephens said.
The gym will he run by the Depart
ment of Athletics. Its hours are 7
a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and X
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on weekends.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "The first important aspect of

this facility is that it literally marks
the first time in over a decade that
Tresidder Union is l(K) percent oc
cupied." According to Wais, there
had been ongoing debates over what
type of services should be offered in
the remaining space.
The center is open to all current
students, faculty and staff with a
valid photo II). According to
Stephens, the gym can accommo
date up to 60 fitness-inclined people
at one time. Though the facility just
opened, Stephens plans to have the
gym fully staffed soon.
"Eventually there will be one
person at the front desk, and then
people on the floor of the gym, help
ing people with the equipment
from helping with the cardiovascu
lar workout machines to giving stu
dents a full walk-through of the sys
tem," he said.
The facility in Tresidder contains
7,(XH) pounds of free weights, 19
weight machines, 10 stair climbing
machines, 10 recumbent and upright
exercise bikes and a treadmill. The
center also contains a handicapped
accessible multi-station machine
among its equipment.
Many students are already taking
advantage of the new gym.
"It's great. The place has really
nice equipment and it's just right
across the street from [Florence
Moore Hall J where I live," freshman
Alisha Beckum said.
Matthew Wenger, another fresh
man, said, "The gym seems to have a
good variety of cardiovascular ma
chines and a good combination of

weights and equipment."
Wais said he felt that the addition
of the fitness center to Tresidder
typified the progress that Tresidder
has made toward becoming a hub of
Stanford.
"Bringing in new tenants, like
Polio's and Jamba Juice, upgrading
the [Coffee House] and adding the
new fitness center has created an ex
citing mix of vendors that students,
faculty and staff will find convenient
and useful," he said.
Wais also said that Tresidder had
"maxed out" on food vendors,
which is why the University did not
add a gourmet pizza restaurant or a

bagel shop, though students had
brought those ideas forward.
Stephens emphasized that "this
facility is meant to complement
what we already have.
"We are not trying to take away
anything from the other gyms on
campus," he continued.
Wais added that the addition of
this new facility would help give
non-varsity athletes more opportu
nities to work out.
"Tresidder has lots of potential,
and we're hopeful with the new ven
dors in Tresidder that much of this
potential can be realized," Wais
said.
