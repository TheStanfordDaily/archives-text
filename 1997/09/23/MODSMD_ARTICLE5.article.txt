The inaugural class of Asia / Pacific
Scholars has arrived on campus three
years after University President Gerhard
Casper first announced the program.
The Asia I Pacific Scholars program is
modeled on the Rhodes Scholars program
at Oxford University. It aims to bring to
Stanford some of the finest graduate stu

dents in Asia as well as those who plan to
pursue careers involving that region.
The two- to three-year program is not
degree-granting but is meant to serve as a
supplemental program for graduate stu
dents in their intended fields.
Selection criteria include scholastic
achievement, leadership potential and
community involvement.
In addition, the selection committee
seeks a geographically and academically

diverse class. This year's group includes
individuals from China, Hong Kong,
India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singa
pore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and
the United States. The individuals have
studied subjects ranging from music to en
gineering.
"We would hope that these Asia I Pa
cific Scholars will learn to interact with
one another and with other Stanford stu
dents," Casper said in a statement. "Stu

dents learn at least 50 percent of whatever
they learn at a university from their fellow
students. It is very important that people
encounter others from very different
backgrounds."
Throughout their first year, the schol
ars will attend weekly seminars on issues
pertaining to Asia. Periodically, they will
meet with H;iy Area educators, scientists
and business leaders. In the spring,
the scholars will travel to Washing
ton for meetings with government
officials and Asian diplomats.
In the second year, participants
will take on the added responsibility
of acting as mentors to incoming
scholars.
As well as the more substantive
learning, program organizers expect
that the students will form perma
nent links with one another during
their years at Stanford.
"Our hope is that the scholars will
form lasting relationships," said
Walter Falcon, director of the Insti
tute for International Studies. "As
the scholars move into positions of
leadership, they will find it enor
mously helpful to draw upon the

friendships and insights that were
formed through association with
other Asia / Pacific Scholars."
While 19 students were selected
this year, the goal is to bring 25 stu
dents to Stanford in future years.
In order to fund the program, the
University is seeking to raise
$50 million in endowment funds.
About $9 million has been raised so
far, according to development offi
cer Steve Suda.
"We are pursuing a number of in
dividuals for funding the rest of the
program," he said.
Because of donations from sever
al people in Hong Kong, the Chinese
participants — of whom there are
five — are fully funded. The other 14
students have received partial fel
lowships.
Suda said he hopes that with the
program's start, donations will in
crease.
