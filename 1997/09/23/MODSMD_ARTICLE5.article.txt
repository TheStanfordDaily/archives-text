The inaugural class of Asia / Pacific
Scholars has arrived on campus three
years after University President Gerhard
Casper first announced the program.
The Asia I Pacific Scholars program is
modeled on the Rhodes Scholars program
at Oxford University. It aims to bring to
Stanford some of the finest graduate stu

dents in Asia as well as those who plan to
pursue careers involving that region.
The two- to three-year program is not
degree-granting but is meant to serve as a
supplemental program for graduate stu
dents in their intended fields.
Selection criteria include scholastic
achievement, leadership potential and
community involvement.
In addition, the selection committee
seeks a geographically and academically

diverse class. This year's group includes
individuals from China, Hong Kong,
India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singa
pore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and
the United States. The individuals have
studied subjects ranging from music to en
gineering.
"We would hope that these Asia I Pa
cific Scholars will learn to interact with
one another and with other Stanford stu
dents," Casper said in a statement. "Stu

dents learn at least 50 percent of whatever
they learn at a university from their fellow
students. It is very important that people
encounter others from very different
backgrounds."
Throughout their first year, the schol
ars will attend weekly seminars on issues
pertaining to Asia. Periodically, they will
meet with H;iy Area educators, scientists
