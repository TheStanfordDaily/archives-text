# New yell squad replacing cheerleaders
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
A fresh Cardinal face will lead
Stanford students at stadiums and
on the courts this year.
After "a fair amount of dis
cussing," the Department of Ath
letics last spring reached a decision
to fund a new spirit squad which
would replace the cheerleaders,
said Asst. Athletic Director Bob
Carruesco.
"The cheerleaders were out
standing and dedicated," he said.
"We appreciated their hard work
and were concerned about break
ing their short-lived tradition. Hut
the yell squad is not intended to
take away from anyone. We're al
ways looking for ways to improve
the entertainment value."
The Athletics Department met
with the cheerleading squad and
the Stanford Band to discuss alter
natives and asked the Band to be
responsible for selecting the new
yell leaders.
The squad will be formed
around senior Chris Bon/on, a for
mer Tree, and junior Andy
Bradley, the Band's announcer
and commentator.
While the squad is "still in its
developmental stage," Bon/on
said he is looking forward to lead
ing a "light-hearted and laid-back
squad" that will do "a little bit of
crazy running around to fit the
Stanford mold."
"We are working fiercely to get
things going," he said. "It's going
to be a new stvle that we have. As

you know, fans here are a little dif
ferent from fans at other places.
Itiey're a little more intellectual
and witty. So it's going to involve a
little more humorous cheering to
get everyone involved. The people
down on the field will be having a
great time, so people up on the
stands should too."
Like the cheerleaders, the yell
squad will cheer for men's and
women's basketball and volleyball
as well as football.
The Band, the dollies and the
yell group are all expected to work
together to lead the student body,
Carruesco said.
"If it doesn't work out, we can
always go back to the cheerleading
thing," he said. "But we are hoping
by midseason they would have es
tablished themselves, and it will
become a thing that goes on from
year to year, like the dollies and
their tryouts."
While there are no limitations
as to who can join the squad, try
outs may be held if there is a large
number of interested students,
Bon/on said.
"We're definitely ready to
branch out and have a good time,
have a lot of fun," he said.
Commenting that the squad's
"trial run" at the San Jose State
football game two weeks ago went
well, Bon/on said an improved
group "will be there for sure" at
the Oregon match this weekend.
"With the men's and women's
basketball and volleyball and the

football team getting better, [the
University] wanted something that
could inspire Stanford students, he
said. " I hey have confidence that this
type of thing is what the Stanford
community likes and can relate to."
