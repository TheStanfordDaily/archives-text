# Forecasting the future
## Engineering dean considers changes 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Since his appointment as dean of
the School of Engineering a year ago,
John Hennessy has begun to prepare
the school's departments for future
expansion of various engineering
fields.
"Engineering moves quickly," he
said. "We want to offer students the
opportunity to know that they are
doing the best work in their fields."
Because many of the current fac
ulty in the school will soon retire, this
is an especially appropriate time to
think strategically about which de
partments are growing and to ana
lyze how the field is shifting, Hen
nessy said.
He has asked all of the engineer
ing department chairs to submit five
year plans describing their depart
ments' future directions.
A majority of the proposed
changes involve analyzing whether
to replace the retiring faculty with
new experts in the same field or to

bring in experts from different ex
panding fields. Because this process
will not increase the number of facul
ty, there should be few problems
funding the new positions.
In addition, some positions which
were at one time closed due to the
University's financial constraints will
be opened again for new faculty. The
school has received additional billets
by teaching freshman seminars.
One of the major concerns in the
school is being able to compete with
corresponding departments at other
universities.
"Stanford has always been fairly
small as an engineering school, com
pared to other universities," Hen
nessy said. "We've always tried to
pick the emerging areas and be first
in those areas."
Some definite steps have already
been taken towards increasing the size
of the Chemical Engineering, Indus
trial Engineering and Materials Sci
ence departments, which are the
smallest of the engineering depart
ments.
I"he Industrial Engineering De
partment is actively recruiting facul
ty for its Work Technology and Or
ganization program as well as for its
Supply Chain Management pro

gram. Other departments will soon
follow.
One area of focus in this ongoing
discussion is developing programs in
bioengineering and biomedical engi
neering, which are in high demand
by students.
Because the School of Medicine is
located close to the engineering
buildings, linking the two in develop
ing the bioengineering and biomed

ical engineering programs should
not be as difficult as on other cam
puses, where the two schools are
across the city from each other, Hen
nessy said.
"We're at a talking stage now," he
added. "The five-year plan is an on
going, working document. There
have been meetings of faculty to dis
cuss where they want to go, and we 11
see from there."
