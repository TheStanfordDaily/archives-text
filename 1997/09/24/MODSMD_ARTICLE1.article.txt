# Forecasting the future
## Engineering dean considers changes 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Since his appointment as dean of
the School of Engineering a year ago,
John Hennessy has begun to prepare
the school's departments for future
expansion of various engineering
fields.
"Engineering moves quickly," he
said. "We want to offer students the
opportunity to know that they are
doing the best work in their fields."
Because many of the current fac
ulty in the school will soon retire, this
is an especially appropriate time to
think strategically about which de
partments are growing and to ana
lyze how the field is shifting, Hen
nessy said.
He has asked all of the engineer
ing department chairs to submit five
year plans describing their depart
ments' future directions.
A majority of the proposed
changes involve analyzing whether
to replace the retiring faculty with
new experts in the same field or to

bring in experts from different ex
panding fields. Because this process
will not increase the number of facul
ty, there should be few problems
funding the new positions.
In addition, some positions which
were at one time closed due to the
University's financial constraints will
be opened again for new faculty. The
school has received additional billets
by teaching freshman seminars.
One of the major concerns in the
school is being able to compete with
corresponding departments at other
universities.
"Stanford has always been fairly
small as an engineering school, com
pared to other universities," Hen
nessy said. "We've always tried to
pick the emerging areas and be first
in those areas."
Some definite steps have already
been taken towards increasing the size
of the Chemical Engineering, Indus
trial Engineering and Materials Sci
ence departments, which are the
