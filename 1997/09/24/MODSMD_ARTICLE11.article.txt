### 
ASSIRA, West Bank (AP) — At least three
of five suicide bombers who carried out recent
attacks in Jerusalem were on a list of Islamic mil
itants Israel had pressed Yasser Arafat's govern
ment to arrest, Israel announced yesterday.
The three bombers were among 88 Hamas
and Islamic Jihad activists that Israeli authorities
demanded the Palestinian Authority arrest to try
to prevent more suicide bombings. All three
lived in the West Bank village of Assira, a Hamas
stronghold.
A Palestinian security official said the three,
along with a fourth Hamas activist from Assira.
were cell mates in a Palestinian jail in the West
Bank town of Nablus for six months in 19%.
They were allowed daily furloughs and disap
peared after failing to return from one in
September 19%.

The disclosure was likely to embarrass Arafat,
who has insisted that the suicide bombers
responsible for the July 30 and Sept. 4 attacks in
Jerusalem came from abroad.
Nevertheless, Palestinian officials said yester
day that Arafat's government could not be
blamed for failing to prevent the bombings
because Israel was in charge of security in Assira
and all other West Bank villages. I he Palestinian
Authority controls security only in the seven
West Bank towns.
"They (the bombers) acted and worked under
the nose of Benjamin Netanyahu," Arafat advis
er Ahmed Tibi said of the suspects' activities in
Assira. Security there "was his responsibility."
However, Israel's military intelligence chief
said the suicide bombers received their instruc
tions from Hamas ringleaders operating from

areas under full Palestinian control and out of
reach for Israeli security forces.
Israel identified the suicide bombers from
Assira as Moawiya Jarara, 22; Bashar Salawah,
23; and lawfiq Yassin, 25. A possible fourth sus
pect was still under investigation.
Relatives said the four boyhood friends had
surrendered to Palestinian police in Nablus in
March 19%, when Arafat was rounding up hun
dreds of I lamas activists in response to four ear
lier Mamas suicide bombings in Israel.
I he four knew they were wanted by Israel
and believed they would be safer in Palestini
an custody. They ended up in a cell together
in a Nablus jail, where, according to a Pales
tinian security official, security was lax and
inmates were allowed frequent visits outside
prison.
