While members of the Class of 2(X)1
basked in the warmth and friendliness of
the Stanford community this past weekend,
a significant number of returning students
struggled with the absurdities of a less than
satisfactory storage retrieval system.
For those of us queued up in the base
ments of Wilbur, Stern and Lagunita, hopes
that storage retrieval would be more effi
cient than it had been in the past soon were
dashed.
Short time windows for storage pick-up,
a shortage of dollies and staff to assist in
retrieving the belongings and a continued
lack of information regarding storage
retrieval hours and procedures contributed
to this past weekend's de ja vu.
While we recognize how fortunate we
are to have storage space on campus avail
able to students during summer vacation,
we also believe that several short and long
term steps should be taken to make the
storage process more efficient and user
friendly.
This process should not continue to run
as it has been.
One of the first steps to improving the
system requires increasing the amount of
information available to students. Many
people seemed unsure of when storage
would be open. Therefore, signs regarding
storage hours should be posted in visible
areas in every dormitory on campus.
Posting this information on the Internet
is often insufficient notification because
many students need to get their computers
out of storage before they have access to
Stanford's homepage.
These signs should also denote the exact
location of the storage area. For example,
signs should make it clear that the entrance
to the Wilbur basement is between the
Wilbur office and the Wilbur east side din
ing hall.
In addition to increased information,
several organizational changes would also
facilitate the pick-up process. More dollies
and more people on duty in the storage
areas would make the How of people in and
out of the building much more efficient.
Perhaps a "storage crew" should also be
created to assist students in carrying boxes.

After all, many students cannot lift their
boxes alone and some students' parents can
no longer manage the physical labor that
storage retrieval requires. It also would be
helpful if short-term parking could be
blocked off in areas close to storage loca
tions, so that people do not have to haul
boxes long distances.
Storage hours should be greatly
increased, especially during peak arrival
and departure days. Additional staff could
help with this as well. It is absolutely ludi
crous to have a mere two and a half to
three hour time window each day during
these periods.
This problem becomes more significant
in June, when students are in some cases
forced to store books and computers
before they have completed their exams.
Longer hours are especially valuable on
(he weekends when there is less traffic on
campus and more parents are available to
help.
If longer hours are not possible, perhaps
it would be worthwhile to stagger the hours
the various locations are open to prevent
the"I need to get my bike from Stern, my
computer from Wilbur, and my bed linens
from Lag in the next hour and a half" sce
nario.
Stanford is no longer a regional universi
ty and the need for a user-friendly, efficient
storage system is becoming increasingly
important.
Many Stanford students simply don't
have the luxury of being able to throw the
contents of their room into the back of the
family's station wagon in June and then cart
it all back here again in September. They
deserve something better than the current
storage system.
There is an old phrase that "first impres
sions are lasting impressions," and it is a
shame that for many students their first
impression this fall was one of frustration
with the inefficiencies and hassles of the
storage system.
We believe that Stanford is an accom
modating university, and we hope that in
the future the storage system will become
as user-friendly as other aspects of life in
this community.
