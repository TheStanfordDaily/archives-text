## Joel Beinin Albright's approach is misguided 
### 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived
in Israel on her first trip to the Middle East as I was
concluding a month of travel around the region. I
travel to Israel / Palestine about once a year to do
research and to visit family.
But this summer was the first time since the
Palestinian intifada that I took a thorough tour of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and made a
concerted effort to meet with a broad range of Palestinians as well
as Israeli peace activists.
What I saw had no relationship to peace, and almost no one I
spoke to — Palestinian or Israeli — had any hope that something
called a "peace process" was underway.
Only the United States government and the media that uncriti
cally report its views of the world share this illusion.
By any standard, the Secretary of State's trip to the Middle East
was a failure. She did not arrange a resumption of talks between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority or between Israel and Syria nor
did she extract substantial concessions from any party.
To underline Albright's failure, days after her departure Jewish
zealots occupied a house in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of
Ras al-Ammud. The house had been surreptitiously purchased by
Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz, who has been bankrolling
Jewish settlement in Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem for years.
Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues dividing the Palestinians
and Israelis. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres gave
Yasir Arafat a written promise that Israel would not alter the status
quo in Jerusalem so as to avoid prejudging the outcome of negotia
tions over its future.
That promise was breached consistently, though quietly, by the
former Labor government and loudly and demonstratively by Ben
jamin Netanyahu's Likud government since it came to power in the
19% Israeli elections.
Before those elections, then Israeli Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin
and PLO second-in-command Abu Mazen drafted a compromise
concerning Jerusalem that gave Israel control over most of the city
but allowed for a nominal Palestinian presence based in the suburb
of Abu Dis.
The settlement of Jews in Ras al-Ammud undermines the possi
bility of this arrangement by cutting off Abu Dis from the rest of
Jerusalem.
The "compromise" of installing yeshiva students in the
Moskowitz house in place of the families who occupied the proper
ty in nominal defiance of the Israeli government is meaningless.
Everyone knows that the students will secure the Jewish presence
in Ras al-Ammud.
The diplomatic maneuvering commonly designated as the
"peace process" was moribund long before the two suicide bomb

ings in Jerusalem on July 29 and Sept. 4 that preceded Madeleine
Albright's trip. Those bombings were morally reprehensible and
politically bankrupt.
They were also an expression of the desperation now widely felt
among Palestinians, including many who would never dream of
resorting to violence.
Most Palestinians believe that Israel is willing to withdraw from
less than 50 percent of the West Bank, leaving them a series of geo
graphically unconnected and economically unviable enclaves
resembling South African Bantustans.
There is good reason to suspect that this is Israel's plan. The map
embodying it was published in the Israeli daily Ha-Aretz last May.
As Prime Minister Netanyahu and his aides explained, the Pales
tinians needed to be liberated from illusions about what they could
achieve through negotiations with the Israelis.
It is conventional to argue that the peace process is dying
because of Palestinian terrorism or, less commonly, Israeli extrem
ism. Both factors will have a place in a detailed analysis of the diplo
matic history of the Middle East since the United States convened
the Madrid conference in 1991.
But underlying them is the consistent failure of United States
diplomacy to provide a countervailing force to the overwhelmingly
superior Israeli position vis-a-vis the Palestinians and other Arabs.
The United States has supported Israel in bullying the Palestinians
every step of the way, culminating in the collapse of the peace process.
Because the balance of forces so strongly favors Israel, Wash
ington policy makers have generally seen this as a low-cost strategy
for securing a pax Americana.
This strategy may be about to blow up. Public opinion through
out the Arab world is, to put it mildly, disgusted with the United
States.
In response, several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and
other traditional United States allies, have indicated that they will
not attend the Middle East Economic Summit in Doha next month.
Even if the meeting is held, no major deals will emerge from it.
As Shimon Peres outlined in his book, The New Middle East, the
economic restructuring of the region is the real agenda of the peace
process.
Unrestrained support for Israel threatens to undermine this
objective and to render the United States impotent as a mediator in
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
This incapacity will eventually force Japan and Europe to play a
larger role in the region in order to secure its stability, something
United States policy has sought to block for many years. This is the
broader significance of Madeleine Albright's failure.
