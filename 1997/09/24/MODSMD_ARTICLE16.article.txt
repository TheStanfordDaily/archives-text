Crime threats also occur with
in the Stanford community
In yesterday's editorial on safety concerns, a logical
connection is made between "locking doors" and stu
dent safety, especially against forcible sexual offenses.
Of course, it is plausible, in a trusting and "safe"
community like Stanford, that an "outsider," a "preda
tor." could gain easy access to dorm rooms, with mal
ice aforethought.
Moreover, the tone of this article fits nicely into the
classic fears we have come to believe from what we see
on television and in the news.
Rut is the assailant always a stranger, as your edito
rial implies? To frame the story in this way is to ignore
that many women (and men) who are victims of such
attacks know their aggressor. On college campuses.
that might mean another student, staff member, TA.
or faculty member.
Although Stanford, to its credit, fosters a supportive
and trusting sense of community, the threat from
crime is not necessarily only from "outside."
At least a fraction of the zeal with which you call

for the useful precautions of door security and better
lighting should be expended on educating and being
no less "kindly vigilant" with each other.

Degree of religious diversity
on campus is remarkable
Have you ever wondered about the religious back
grounds of students who live and study with you here
at Stanford?
Every year, along with the mountains of other forms
incoming freshmen fill out in preparation for their first
year at Stanford, students are invited to complete a
small blue card titled, "Religious Preference." This
year roughly one third of the incoming class replied.
The results present a fascinating portrait of per
haps greater religious diversity on this campus than
one might expect.
112 ive hundred and twenty-two students in the fresh

man class claim a wide variety of religious traditions,
from mainline Christian traditions to Hindu, from Jain
to Quaker, from Jewish to Buddhist to Muslim to
Baha'i.
In fact, these S(X) plus freshmen represent at least
32 distinct religious affiliations.
Even while the majority of students returning blue
cards claim some sort of Christian tradition, the 350
students who describe themselves as Christian belong
to at least 18 different Christian denominations,
including Roman Catholic (the largest single religious
group, with 146 students). Baptists. Lutherans,
Reformed, Non-denominational and more.
However, at Stanford University this year, a full
quarter of all students who claim a religious back
ground are not Christian. Eighty-eight Jewish students
returned religious preference cards, along with signifi
cant numbers of Muslim. Hindu, Baha'i, and Unitari
an. Other students returned cards with an Agnostic,
Atheist or Pagan designation.
Truly, religious diversity as broad and wide as that
which exists at Stanford is one of the defining marks of
this University at the close of the 2()th century.
What can and does this mean for all of us who work

and study here?
First, expect this to be a place where religious con
viction meets intellectual inquiry, in the classroom and
in your residence. Use the many resources in and out
of the classroom to explore and develop in your own
religious tradition.
Second, access Stanford's religious diversity. The
many religious experiences and traditions of our stu
dent body present us with an amazing field for mutual
learning, appreciation and growth. Yet some students
report that of all the identities they share and discuss
with one another, religious convictions can be among
those most difficult to make known.
Religious identity is deeply personal as well as com
munal. involving our most profound sense of self. Dis
cussions about religious identities, thus, require trust, a
commitment to listen openly and to avoid easy classifi
cations and judgments.
"No religion is an island," esteemed ethicist Rabbi
Abraham Heschel wrote in 1966; Today with the
growth in religious diversity the statement is only all
the more powerful.
