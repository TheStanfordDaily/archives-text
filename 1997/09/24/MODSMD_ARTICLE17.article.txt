## 'Jet streams' and 'trade winds' found on Sun 
### Akash Garg Contributing writer 
Stanford's Solar Oscillations
Investigation group has made two
important discoveries that will
hopefully shed new light on many
unanswered questions about the
sun. The research team discovered
"jet streams," or rivers of hot, elec
trically charged gas flowing
beneath the surface of the sun, as
well as "trade winds" that trans
port gas beneath the sun's surface.
Hopefully, these findings will
help scientists understand the
famous sunspot cycle and sudden
solar flares that affect the Earth
with communications and power
disturbances. Physics Prof. Phillip
Scherrer, the primary investigator
of the SOI, made these discoveries
using the joint NASA/ESA Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) satellite.
"We have detected motion sim
ilar to the weather patterns in the
Earth's atmosphere," said research
associate Dr. Jesper Schou.
"Moreover, in what is a complete
ly new discovery, we have found a
jet-like flow near the poles. This
flow is totally inside the sun. It is
completely unexpected and cannot
be seen at the surface."
Even though these polar
streams are relatively small fea
tures on the sun, they are immense
when compared to the jet streams
found on Earth.
"Ringing the Sun at about 75
degrees latitude, they consist of
flattened oval regions about 17,000
miles across where material moves
about 10 percent faster than its

surroundings. Although these are
the smallest structures yet
observed deep inside the Sun, each
is still large enough to engulf two
Earths," said Scherrer.
The large size makes sense con
sidering the sun's diameter is more
than KM) times that of the Earth's.
Because the jet streams consist of
plasma, they generate magnetic
fields as they move around. Mag
netic fields also have the ability to
push the plasma. The electrical
nature of the plasma leads to
behaviors that are uncommon on
Earth.
The research team has also dis
covered trade winds similar to
those found on Earth. Due to the
sun's gaseous state, it rotates much
faster at its equator than at the
poles. However, Schou and Dr.
Alexander Kosovichev, a senior
research associate, have found that
there are belts in the northern and
southern hemispheres where cur
rents flow at different speeds rela
tive to each other.
Six of these gaseous bands
move slightly faster than the mate
rial surrounding them. The solar
belts are more than 40 thousand
miles across and they contain
"winds" that move about ten miles
per hour relative to their sur
roundings.
The first evidence of these belts
was found more than a decade ago
by Dr. Robert Howard of the
Mount Wilson Observatory. The
Stanford researchers have now
shown that, rather than being
superficial surface motion, the
belts extend down to a depth of at
least 12,(XX) miles below the Sun's

surface. Research associate Dr.
Craig DeForest speculates that
these belts may be responsible for
sunspots.
"In one way, the Sun's zonal
belts behave more like the colorful
banding found on Jupiter than the
region of trade winds on the
Earth," said DeForest.
"Somewhat like stripes on a
barber pole, they start in the mid
latitudes and gradually move
toward the equator during the
eleven year solar cycle. They also
appear to have a relationship to
sunspot formation as sunspots
tend to form at the edges of these
zones." DeForest added.
The last discovery from the SOI
group is startling — the entire
outer layer of the sun, to a depth of
at least 15,(XX) miles, is slowly flow
ing from the equator into the
poles. The polar flow rate is fast
enough to transport an object from
the equator to the pole in a bit
more than a year.
"Oddly enough, the polar flow
moves in the opposite direction
from that of the sunspots and the
zonal belts, which are moving from
higher to lower latitudes. So
sunspots act something like ships
steaming against the wind. When
they break up, we can see debris
that is left caught in the polar flow
and carried away," DeForest said.
Researchers are optimistic that
learning more and more about the
"trade winds" and "jet streams" of
the sun will permit them to predict
and understand more about phe
nomena like solar flares which can
cause damage to communications
and power systems on the Earth.
