New purpo.se found for the brain's major cell type

Glial cells, which make up 90 pcrccnt of the cells in the
human brain, were once thought to be the relatively
unimportant padding for the more important nerve cells.
However, recent research by scientists at the Stanford
School of Medicine has concluded that the glia play an
important role in developing and maintaining connec
tions among the nerve cells in the brain.

Using populations of pure glia and nerve cells, postdoctoral fellow
Frank Pfrieger and Assoc. Neurology Prof. Barbara Barres showed that
nerve cells connected poorly in the absence of glia, while combinations
of the two types of cells resulted in strong connections between nerve
cells.
Barres and Pfrieger discovered that while connections, or synapses,
could be made by nerve cells without glia, the transfer of electric mes
sages across these synapses was inefficient and failure-prone. The
researchers ultimately found that glia secrete an unidentified factor
which somehow makes the synapses more effective and less likely to
fail.
Until now, no one realized that glial cells had such an important role.
According to Barres, "the brain is the only tissue in the body where we
don't know the function of the major cell type." Researchers had
believed glia only played passive roles, such as insulation for nerve cells.
Though compelling results have been achieved using isolated popu
lations of cells, Barres said that the importance of glia in the intact brain
has yet to be determined.
With the identification of the glial factor, researchers may be able to
answer many questions about the human brain that have puzzled scien
tists for years.
Dedication of major telescope scheduled

A new telescope resulting from a cooperative effort
between Stanford and four other universities around the
world is scheduled to he dedicated at the University of
Texas McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas, on
Oct. 8.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) will be one of
-J the world's largest, most powerful and most economical

new optical telescopes.
As a joint project of Stanford, University of Texas at Austin, Penn
sylvania State, Ludwig-Maximiiians-Universitat Miinchen and Georg-
August-Universitat Gottingen, the HET is designed to collect and ana
lyze light from comets, planets, stars and other astronomical bodies
using a technique called spectroscopy.
The telescope has 91 computer-aligned mirror segments spanning 36
feet, making it the largest telescope mirror in the world. Pioneering
cost-conscious science, the entire design and construction process
required only $13.5 million, one-sixth the cost of a Keck telescope.
Scientists hope to be able to make much progress with the new tele
scope at McDonald Observatory. The observatory has the clearest and
darkest site for astronomical observation in the nation, with an average
of 230 clear nights per year and no light pollution.
Several representatives from Stanford will attend the dedication cer
emony, and Jacqueline Wender, assistant to the president, will read a
letter from President Casper.
