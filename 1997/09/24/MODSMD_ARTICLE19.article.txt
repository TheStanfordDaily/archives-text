# Unmanned tractor plows first fields

A Stanford research team has developed an
automatic tractor driving system that will help
farmers become more efficient and effective.
Led by doctoral students Gabriel H. Elkaim
and Michael O'Connor of the Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department, the team has devel
oped a control system that automatically guides a
20,(XX) pound tractor using the global positioning
system (GPS).
The control system, which previously could
only precisely maneuver a tractor traveling at a
fixed speed with fixed loads, has been perfected to
control a tractor moving at any speed and pulling
any load with centimeter level precision.
The system has proven to be far more precise
than any human driven tractor. This level has
been achieved by using GPS, a group of 24 satel
lites operated by the U.S. Department of Defense.
The system was originally created for military use,
but has since been made available for civilian use.
Normal GPS systems have an accuracy of
about 1(X) yards, but by using a system called dif
ferential GPS that uses a local base station, meter

level accuracy can he achieved.
However, this meter level accuracy is still not
precise enough to guide a farm vehicle. The Stan
lord team overcame this problem by adapting a
method used in automatic aircraft landing sys
tems. By using an additional ground station called
a pseudolite that emits GPS-like signals in addi
tion to differential GPS, centimeter-level preci
sion can be achieved that is precise enough to
guide vehicles.
Automatic control of vehicles will have many
applications such as the development of smart
roads with vehicles that automatically "drive"
their passengers to a destination and the opera
tion of vehicles in hazardous areas.
However, according to O'Connor, "farm vehi
cles will be the first major application." Farm
vehicles are ideal for automatic guidance. Hie
GPS signals can be blocked by mountains or tall
buildings, but most farmland has direct lines of
sight.
Even if the creation of a totally autonomous
tractor is not yet possible, there are advantages in
adding the guidance system to tractors with
drivers. Farming activities such as bedding, seed
ing, disking, fertilizing and other procedures are

fairly monotonous. Many farmers face the risk of
falling asleep and damaging crops. II the driving
were done by a control system, the driver could
concentrate on other tasks.
" This kind of control system, which does the
basic driving, frees the operator to make higher
level decisions," O'Connor said.
An automatic guidance system would also
allow tractors to operate during poor visibility
conditions such as night, dust or fog. This could
increase the time in which farmers could harvest a
crop.
In addition, with the guidance system, almost
anyone would be able to drive a tractor, instead of
having the need for experienced operators. The
best precision obtained from human operated
tractors measured by the Stanford team is about
10 centimeters, while the automatic system
achieves an accuracy of two centimeters.
This high amount of accuracy is needed forcer
tain farming techniques. In melon farming, farm
ers use buried hoses called tapes to water the mel
ons. Ifowever, after the crops grow it is difficult to
locate the tapes.
Currently, the tape locations are
marked at each end of the field.
Tractor drivers are expected to
drive across a field avoiding the
tapes based on the markers. This
can be difficult and thousands of
dollars of damage occurs every year
to tapes. This problem would be

solved with the use of the (il'S gnid
ance system.
GPS control can also be used to
allow one driver to operate a whole
convoy of tractors or allow farmers
to plow fields in a spiral pattei n that
minimizes plowing time.
This use of GPS in both automat
ic tractors and precision farming
could also reduce pollution due to
excess fertilization and allow farm
ers to save money.
