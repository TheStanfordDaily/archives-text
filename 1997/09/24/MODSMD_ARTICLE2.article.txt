# Wolff back for good on Farm
## 
### Tracy Jan Editorial staff 
Less than a month after return
ing to California, Tobias Wolff en
ters an office resembling a dorm
ro-om at the start of a new school
year: cramped and littered with
boxes.
But instead of clothes and toi
letries, these boxes contain books
— a lot of books.
On his cluttered desk, rolled
posters sit next to a paperback
copy of "This Boy's Life," a mem

oir of Wolffs childhood in the
1950s that was recently made into
a major motion picture. For now,
the bookcases lining the otherwise
blank walls remain empty.
"[Stanford] is home in many
ways, for me and my famify,"
Wolff said. "[My wife and I] had al
ways hoped to come back when the
time was right."
As sounds of construction
crews floated up through the win
dows of his fourth-floor office,
Wolff said, "1 remember Stanford
to be a very peaceful campus when
1 was here."
Wolff, a former Stegner Fellow
with Stanford's creative writing
program, taught at Stanford from
1976 to 1978 as a Jones lecturer be
fore moving to upstate New York,
where he taught at Syracuse Uni
versity with other well-known writ
ers, such as Raymond Carver.
"I liked upstate New York a lot,
though over time those pewter
skies began to weigh heavily,"
Wolff said. "I had great colleagues,
who became my friends and com
panions."
Back under Stanford's clear
blue skies, Wolff said he hopes to
spend time with his family, settle
into the English Department and
get a good deal of writing done.
However, his work in progress
remains secret. "I never tell what
I'm working on because I'm very
superstitious and can then feel it
physically leave me," he said. "But
I'll probably start writing about
Syracuse now. I never write about
a place when I'm actually living
there."

Wolff has written three collec
tions of short stories, a novel and
two memoirs. Besides finding time
to write, Wolff is looking forward
to meeting his students. He said he
discovered teaching to be a re
warding experience after his two
years at Stanford.
"[Teaching] has been, for me, a
wonderful way of combining inter
ests —my love for reading and talk
ing to people," Wolff said. "It's the
stimulation which I require for my
writing. The literary culture that
I'm living in — it's a great gift for a
writer to find people with the same
intensity and devotion."
Although hesitant to reveal his
favorite authors for fear of leaving
out a writer, Wolff said, "I read a
lot of poetry and history, but I tend
to avoid reading, by instinct, the
type of thing that I'm working on
during the period. 1 read for both
inspiration and relief."
This quarter Wolff will teach
one section of intermediate fiction
writing as well as the Stegner Fel
lows workshop. Wolff said that
next year he hopes to teach more
undergraduate writing workshops
and literature courses.
"Writing is a continually frus
trating experience because you
never say things quite as well as

you want to say them. But it has to
be that way so you are continually
asking more of yourself" said
Wolff, who started writing as a
teenager. "Dissatisfaction is kind
of built into the job."
His two sons, aged 17 and 18,
are both talented writers, accord
ing to their father. "My 18-year old
is in Russia and will write for a
newspaper about his travels," he
said. "But I think the children of
writers are reluctant to embark on
[writing] as a field."
Neither of Wolffs parents was a
writer, but his older brother Geof
frey has also succeeded as an au
thor.
"That could be a competitive
and disagreeable fact but, to tell
you the truth, it's been wonderful,"
he said. "We share a world in com
mon, and that has drawn us clos
er."
Eager to start his new life with
his wife, two sons and 8-year old
daughter, Wolff said, "We had a
good 17 years [in New York]. Now
we're looking for a good 50 years
here."
"I'll be [at Stanford) forever, as
long as my legs keep me upright,"
Wolff said. "They'll have to carry
me out."


Author Tobias Wolff has been hired as the new director of Stanford's
Creative Writing Program.
