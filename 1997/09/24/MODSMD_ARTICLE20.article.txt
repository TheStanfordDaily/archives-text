# Stress hormones linked to social behavior
##

Always stressed? Unable to
unwind? Chronic stress may indicate
that you have been spending too
much time at the bottom of the
social totem pole.
In a recent study, a team of
researchers led by Stanford Profes
sor of Human Biology and Psycholo
gy Russell Fernald has discovered
that African cichlid fish that exhibit
high levels of Cortisol fail to develop
the mature sex organs and flamboy
ant coloration of their more relaxed
counterparts.
Their findings, published in the
Aug. 15 issue of Journal of Neuro
science, suggest that, at least in male
cichlids, high stress levels lower
reproductive success. This role of
stress hormones in social systems,
however, may he widespread, Fer
nald added.
The study builds on previous
investigations, in which the Fernald
lab had discovered a causal relation
ship between a cichlid s social posi
tion and its physiology.
Cichlids are territorial fish who
scavenge scraps of plant debris from
a lake's gravel-strewn shallows.
Males who own territory offer
females foraging rights, in hopes of
inseminating eggs that the females

lay on their territory.
Male cichlids which successfully
defend their territory against other,
opportunistic males earn the charac
teristics of a dominant, or alpha,
male. ()nly the alpha males are sexu
ally developed enough to produce

sperm with which to fertilize the eggs
of female cichlids.
Within minutes of securing a ter
ritory, victorious cichlids metamor
phose into flashy alpha males: cam
ouflaged sandy gray coloration turns

into bright blue or yellow. I.ater, the
fish become larger, acquire an atten
tion-grabbing stripe next to their
eyes and reach sexual maturity.
During this metamorphosis, cer
tain cells of the brain responsible for
producing the gonadotropin releas-

ing hormone (CinKH) swell to eight
times their si/e and secrete this hor
mone in vast quantities. GnRH,
which mediates vertebrate sexual
development, stimulates these phys
iological changes in the male ciehlid.

This process, however, also works
in reverse. When a usurper defeats
the alpha male, pushing him down
on the social hierarchy, the defeated
cichlid loses all the characteristics of
the alpha male, including the ability
to inseminate eggs from female cich
lids. The size of CinRH producing
cells shrinks, the quantity ol hoi
mone secreted declines, the gonads
shrink, and the male's coloration
returns to dull normalcy.
"In our lab. we have shown that
behavior influences the brain. We've
seen that behavioral encounters can
modify the CinRH producing cells,
and we know that this hormone in
turn triggers changes in body struc
tures that influence reproductive
success," l ernald said.
lernald studies the social interac
tions, along with the neurological
and physiological changes ol the
cichlid in aquariums that simulate
the conditions of their native Lake
Tanganyika. As in the wild, the cich
lids scavenge for food among the
gravel.
In an experiment involving moni
toring of the behavior and blood Cor
tisol levels of 20 male and female
cichlids. the Fernald team discov
ered .i correlation between stress,
Cortisol and reproductive success.

"Darn those stress hormones!" Gonadotropin and Cortisol deter
mine fish social behavior.
I"he team covered half the aquarium
floor with gravel and pot shards, leav
ing the rest of the floor bare, as a
refuge for unsuccessful fish.
Soon after the cichlids were intro
duced to the tank, the males began
fighting for territory in the sites with
gravel. Ownership changed frequent
ly during the first weeks as did the col
oration of the male cichlids. More im
portantly, during this interval of insta
bility the females refused to lay eggs,
said Fernald.
Over time, however, a few males
established control over the desirable
locations in the tank and transformed
into flashy alpha males. The unsuc
cessful males, meanwhile sulked in
the bare part of the tank, in appear

ance almost indistinguishable from
the female cichlids.
After examining the blood Cortisol
levels of male cichlids at various
stages during the establishment of the
social hierarchy, Fernald found evi
dence that suggested that the stress
hormone Cortisol links behavior and
physiology.
During the period of turmoil, all
males showed similar levels of Corti
sol, with males temporarily in posses
sion of territory showing higher levels
of Cortisol than other males.
Cortisol is also known as the hor
mone responsible for the "fight or
flight" response, which provides ani
mals an extra btxist of strength or
speed in response to danger. Its pres
ence in fish exposed to a stressful en
vironment was reasonable and ex
pected.
However, after the fish had solidi

fied their territorial claims, their Corti
sol levels changed. Despite engaging
in high levels of activity — driving off
encroaching males and attracting fe
males — the alpha males showed
lower Cortisol levels. The other males
however, showed persistently high
Cortisol levels.
The scientists concluded that the
difference in Cortisol levels between
alpha males and their antagonists of
fers evidence that stress hormone re
sponds to one's social situation.
"The interesting new thing we
have found is that stress depends not
only on the social state of the individ
ual male but also on the stability of the
community," Fernald said.
The stress hormones may also af
fect the size of GnRH producing brain
cells and thus direct sexual develop
ment. More research, said Fernald, is
needed to verify this hypothesis.
