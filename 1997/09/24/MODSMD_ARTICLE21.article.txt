INTRAMURALS

â–  SIGNUPS: Thursday, Oct. 2, beginning
at 7 a.m. in Ford Center

With the addition of European style
handball and a pair of one-day tourna
ments in the fall, the IM directors are look
ing to expand the number of sports offered
despite a decrease in field space.
Babb said swimming and late-night has
ketball will be added in the spring, and the
Department of Athletics is Irving to ac
quire new field space for next year's pro
gram.
Although handball may not have
seemed the most obvious addition, said
Babb, there were numerous requests for it
over the summer from graduate students,
whd'make up a large percentage of intra
mural teams.

The number ol requests and the ability
to accommodate the indoor sport made
handball an easy choice.
"We've had a lot of requests for it,"
Babb said. "There is plenty of space. We
just need to have enough teams."
Other requests in the past have includ
ed women's field hockey and year round
play for popular sports such as basketball
and soccer. But handball was the only re
quest for which there is enough interest
and available space, Babb said.
In order to gauge interest, the IM de
partment will take sign ups for handball
teams up until < K tober 7, the same as with
single elimination tournaments like table
tennis and billiaids. Eventually, however,
handball teams will compete in leagues.
Although as ninny as halt of the six in
tramural fields have been eliminated by
the new soccer stadium, there will not be
any reduction in the number of football
teams.
Babb said (>0 football teams will be al
lowed in league play, and there is enough
field space for additional teams if neces
sary.
"IMs will be sharing fields with club
teams, so everyone will be vying for field
spaces," she said, "but at least for this quar

ter, there will be no reduction in teams.
We're doing everything we did last year
plus additional teams."
Although field space should not pose a
problem dining fall or winter quarter, the
spring field sports soccer and soft ha 11
have already taken cuts Last spring, there
were 24 softhall teams and (>() soccer teams,
hall of the usual number for each.
"Spring always poses a problem since
we have to split the fields between two
large field sports," Babb said. " There were
a lot ol people interested who didn't get to
play."
1 "he intramural department is setting
new goals for itself, including internal de
partmental improvements. Ihe directors
want to create more incentives for referee
participation and have mandatory clinics
to keep the sports "within the bounds and
make it fun," Babb said.
I hey also want to publicize the individ
ual and tournament competitions more
than in past years.
"We're looking to get more people in
volved in those types of sports," Babb said.
With improved communication with
referees anil participants, the new direc-
