# More than a coach

Discipline.
It's the word you'll hear over and over
again in reference to Stanford football head
coach Tyrone Willingham.
It's how he is, it's what he brings to the
team. But that's an outsider's perspective.
Ask his players, and they will talk about
respect — the all-encompassing respect that
he has for his players, and that they have for
hini.

FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAY: Stanford (2-1, 1-0) vs.
Oregon (3-0, 1-0) at Stanford Stadium, 7:15
p.m. TV: none. Radio: KZSU-FM (90.1)

Ask an assistant coach and he will discuss
Willingham's "relentless pursuit of his goal"
and his staunch work ethic.
Hut ask Willingham himself and he will
say, "flexibility."
Flexibility?
A - lie is quick to point out, in addition to
being football coach of a top-25 team and
Rose Bowl contender, Willingham is a fa
ther too.
"I have children that are growing and
changing, and I am very much a parent for
90-sonie young men," he said.
Flexibility is the key to dealing with
them.
"Being at Stanford," Willingham said,
"we have a different kind of young man, not
to say any better, hut treated a little differ
ently — we bring in the best student athletes
in the country."
His players agree that his influence has
transcended the football field.
"He's a lot like a father figure. He has
great insight on common sense in life," said
sophomore wide receiver Rossi Jones.

"Everything that he teaches us about foot
ball can be applied to real life experiences.
He teaches us that you are successful not
only as Stanford football players; he really
wants to sec us succeed as individuals."
Born and raised in North Carolina, Will
ingham's biography reads like that of many
successful coaches. His journey to Stanford
has taken him through assistant coaching
JjflflT l ; -Ht Michigan tetate, his alma mater;
Central Michigan; North Carolina State;
Rice; Stanford and the Minnesota Vikings.
Scanning his list of credentials, it is the
sunny California school that stands out both
in location and student attitude. It is also the
one that Willingham returned to as head
coach in December 1994.
Since then, his accomplishments have
continued to grow. In two short years as the
Card's head coach, Willingham has led the
team to two consecutive bowl appearances
and is steadily progressing toward a third
straight bowl berth. After his first season at
Stanford's helm, Willingham was voted
1995 Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the
Year.
Every coach wants to win, but few want
to do it like Willingham does. When he says
that he wants to create a tradition of winning
at Stanford, he isn't just talking about statis
tics. To him, winning means "on the field, in
the classroom and creating a social con
science."
Willingham is the type of coach that
makes an effort to talk to his players. Will
ingham is the type of father that makes time
for his family and goes to his daughter's
gymnastics meets, the type of interviewee
that takes the time to ask the reporter about
her life and academic career, the type ol per
son who buys pizza for students sleeping out
for basketball tickets.

Another side of Tyrone: "I have children that are growing and changing, and I am very
much a parent for 90-some young men," said the Cardinal's head coach.
He is "probably the hardest
working college football coach in
the nation," said team assistant Kit
Harris. "He'll be watching tape at 11
p.m. on a Sunday night. No other
coach does that."
Willingham is quick to disagree,
however, saying that 14-hour work
days are generally the coaching

norm. Also, he expects the same de
votion from his players and staff.
"You can't short-cut football
and be successful — football is the
greatest team sport, but the physical
and mental demands are tremen
dous," he said.
His players have learned through
his example, living their lives with
the same principles that he exempli
fies.
Willingham has a theory about
how to avoid problems. Experience

has shown him three areas in which
problems tend to occur, and he is
quick to caution his players against
them.
The first is the hour — most "ac
cidents" happen after midnight. The
second is substance — in many cases
drugs and/or alcohol are involved.
And the third is location — restau
rants and bars, in conjunction with
areas one and two, lend themselves
to trouble.
But he doesn't need to set hard

and fast rules. He only needs to cre
ate an environment of expectation
and lead by example.
"Everybody on the team has so
much respect for Coach," Jones
said. "When he walks into the room
everyone is silent and all eyes are on
him."
And what do those 90-some
young men see?
Discipline. Hard-work. Respect.
Flexibility.
Character.
