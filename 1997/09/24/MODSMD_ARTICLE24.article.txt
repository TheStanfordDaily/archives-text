# Line seeks success
## 
### Dave Flemming 
Offensive linemen might be
the most underappreciated mem
bers of any football team.
Grappling in the trenches, a
lineman's performance — when
good — often goes largely unno
ticed by fans who instead focus on
a galloping running back or a
quarterback picking apart an op
ponent's secondary.
But as almost any football
coach will tell you, there is no
more critical component of a
team's success than its beefy
blockers on the offensive side.
"It's what's up front that
counts," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham.
"When you play well up front,
that gives you the ability to do the
things you want."
This assertion seems especial

ly true for the Stanford offense,
l ake, for example, Saturday's 27-
24 come-from-behind win over
Oregon State.
Pass protection from the Car
dinal's offensive line — consist
ing of starters Jeff Cronshagen,
Andrew Kroeker, Mike
McLaughlin, Eli Murriss and
Geoff Wilson — was poor most of
the day. ()regon State sacked rcd
shirt sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson seven times, in
cluding four times in Stanford's
first six possessions of the second
half. On all six of those posses
sions. Stanford failed to score.
But on the Cardinal's final se
ries, a 7K-yard, game-winning
touchdown drive, the line hardly
allowed a Beaver defender near
Hutchinson, and he responded by
completing five of seven passes
for 63 yards.
One of the defining characteris
tics of Stanford's first three games
has been that sort of inconsistency
on the offensive line.
Pass protection in particular has
been a problem. Hutchinson has
been sacked 15 times this year, by
far the highest total of any quarter
back in the Pacific 10 Conference.
And although the running at
tack improved considerably at Ore
gon State, it was not effective the
previous week against North Car
olina, netting only 41 yards.
"We haven't pass protected as
well as we need to," Willingham
said. "We've been inconsistent
(with all aspects of our line play)."
The slow start for the line resem
bles in many ways what happened
last year on Stanford's offensive
front.
A major reason that Stanford
dropped five of its first seven games
in 1996 was the struggles of that

unit. In its first seven games, Stan
ford allowed 32 sacks and rushed
for an average of 2.6 yards per
carry. During the season-ending
five-game winning streak, the Car
dinal was sacked only 14 times, and
gained 4 yards per rush.
It was apparent to all in 19% that
as the offensive line went, so went
the entire team. This year the Stan
ford players know that is again the
case. And the lineman themselves
know they must improve soon if the
team expects to live up to its high
expectations.
"We're off to a better start than
last year," said junior center
McLaughlin, "but we still have to
play much better."
Injuries have certainly been a
part of the troubles thus far. Senior
tackle Brian Donoghue suffered an
ankle injury against San Jose State
and has missed the last two games,
leaving the Cardinal thin. To make
matters worse, junior left tackle
Cronshagen sprained his knee
against Oregon State and is expect
ed to miss three weeks.
But that is not a sufficient expla
nation for the line's mediocre play

thus far, according to Willingham.
"We can't use injuries as an ex
cuse for not performing," he said.
Stanford's line also has had to
replace both Brad Badger and Nate
Parks, who graduated last year and
now play in the NFL. Sometimes it
takes time for an offensive line to
gel as a unit — a critical process,
since performing well together is
the only way a line can succeed.
All of the blame for the poor
pass protection cannot be put on
the line, either. The running backs
and the effectiveness of the passing
game play crucial roles in how a
team rushes the ball. As for pass
protection, that may also be more
complicated than it appears.
"When you look at a sack, every
one likes to point at offensive line
men," Willingham said. "But there
are other things which go into it.
Backs (picking up their blocks), re
ceivers (running the correct routes)
— everybody plays a part."
Whatever the reasons for its lack
of execution, there are signs the
Cardinal offensive line is getting
closer to where it needs to be.
"The line blocked better on the

last drive [against Oregon State]
than it had the whole game," said
senior running back Mike Mitchell.
"It shows what desire and determi
nation do."
McLaughlin also thinks the solu

tion to his unit's woes may be as
simple as getting down and dirty.
"We have to simply be more
physical," McLaughlin said.
If the line can indeed play with
more intensity and tenacity,

McLaughlin is confident every
thing will be fine. That will go a long
way toward solving Stanford's of
fensive troubles.
"We can be the best line in the
nation," McLaughlin said.
