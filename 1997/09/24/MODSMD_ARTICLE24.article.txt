# Line seeks success
## 
### Dave Flemming 
Offensive linemen might be
the most underappreciated mem
bers of any football team.
Grappling in the trenches, a
lineman's performance — when
good — often goes largely unno
ticed by fans who instead focus on
a galloping running back or a
quarterback picking apart an op
ponent's secondary.
But as almost any football
coach will tell you, there is no
more critical component of a
team's success than its beefy
blockers on the offensive side.
"It's what's up front that
counts," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham.
"When you play well up front,
that gives you the ability to do the
things you want."
This assertion seems especial

ly true for the Stanford offense,
l ake, for example, Saturday's 27-
24 come-from-behind win over
Oregon State.
Pass protection from the Car
dinal's offensive line — consist
ing of starters Jeff Cronshagen,
Andrew Kroeker, Mike
McLaughlin, Eli Murriss and
Geoff Wilson — was poor most of
the day. ()regon State sacked rcd
shirt sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson seven times, in
cluding four times in Stanford's
first six possessions of the second
half. On all six of those posses
sions. Stanford failed to score.
But on the Cardinal's final se
ries, a 7K-yard, game-winning
touchdown drive, the line hardly
allowed a Beaver defender near
Hutchinson, and he responded by
completing five of seven passes
