STANFORD STADIUM. Nov.
23. — (ompletcly fulfilling expecta
tions for the season. Stanford's Indi
ans, for the most part playing in
their last Big Game, drove two first
quarter touchdowns to set upa 13 to
0 victory that saw California not
only beaten, hut stopped cold.

I hrills start
ed early as Bob
B lit 11 ngham
dropped on a
Stanford fum
ble in the first
minute of play
to set upa Bear

running and passing attack that
ended when I lank Spai ks attempt
ed field goal from the 6-yard line
wjis wide.
Soon after, Stanford opened
her first touchdown drive on her
own 20. Twelve well-mixed plays
were good for 74 yards to give
(irayson a fourth down chance to
make a touchdown from a yard off.
I he Portland Boomer barelv
sneaked over; Monk Moscrip's
field goal was good. Score: Stan

ford 7, ('alifornia 0.
Several minutes later Wes
Muller recovered I'erry Schwartz's
fumble on the Bear 24-yard line to
set up the next Stanford score.
Bones Hamilton lost one, the
(irayson passed to Hamilton, who
latcralcd to Bill I'aulman lor a first
down on the 12-yard line.
(irayson picked up three at tack
le, and then failed to gain. Little
Jimmy Coffis sailed through Larry
I ul/ on a reverse on second down to
score standing up. Moscrip's con
version try was wide, and the score
was Stanford 13. ( alifornia 0.
Stanford spent the remainder of
the first quarter and the early part of
the second in California territory.

Towards the end of the period Floyd
Blower of the Bears found a hole that
gave him a 26-yard gain to the Stan
ford 44, and then kicked to the Car
dinal 13.

Seconds before half time, Califor
nia climaxed a threat with two in
complete passes over the Stanford
goal line, which gave the Indians pos
session on the 20 as the half ended.
The third quarter for the most part
was played harmlessly enough in mid
field and shallow Stanford territory,
neither team scoring so much as a first
down. Intermittent California passes

were stopped without completion.
California fumbled on her 30,
Stanford recovered and then fum
bled on the 21 to give the ball back to
the Bears for the only excitement
during this period.
Superior Stanford line play served
to prompt Stanford's two first half
touchdown marches, and the in
spired Cardinal line, playing its best

game of the season, stopped Califor
nia's attack line cold.
Monk Moscripand Keith Topping,
Indian ends, rushed passers Floyd
Blower and Don Fowler so fast that
they had little chance to pick out their
receivers or to time their throws. The
both proved distinct threats through
out, on running plays as well as in the
pitching department, however.
