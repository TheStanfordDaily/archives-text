# CIV replacement pilot begins
## 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
In addition to the beginning of
fall quarter classes, today also marks
the partial implementation of a new
program designed to satisfy the
Area One requirement.
"Introduction to the Humani
ties" will replace the Cultures, Ideas
and Values program when it is fully
implemented in 2(XX). Until then,
freshmen have the option of choos

ing between the two programs.
Under the new program, unani
mously approved by the Faculty
Senate in May, each freshman will
take a one-quarter introductory
course taught by a team of faculty
members in fall quarter and a subse
quent two-quarter thematic se
quence in winter and spring quar
ters. Freshmen will choose the initial
fall quarter course before matricu
lating and the winter-spring se
quence after arriving at Stanford.

"There will most likely be be
tween four and eight first-quarter
classes given and between six and 12
second-quarter sequences offered,"
said Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry
Elam, the director of the Area One
Program, which for now encompass
es both "Introduction to the Hu
manities" and CIV. "Ideally we
would have six first-quarter courses
and nine second-quarter courses."
The number of courses to be of
fered when the program is fully irn

plemented was not included in the
highly-debated legislation.
This year, the Area One Program
offers three Introduction to Human
ities courses: "The Word and the
World: Conversations Across Time
and Space"; "Great Works I," which
is a revamped version of its CIV
namesake; and "Why Read It?"
" This has never been done be
fore," said French and Italian Prof.
Robert Harrison who is team-teach
ing "Why Read It?" with History
Prof. Keith Baker and Elam. "It's a
pilot course for a new model."
In designing the new program,
the Senate attempted to allay many
of students' perceived reservations
with the ( IV program including the
daunting amount of reading, the
lack of any variety and the feeling of
being stuck on a three quarter track
and the impossibility of reasonably
teaching and learning everything mi
merely three quarters.
"There were recurrent com
plaints from students that there was
far too much reading and that those
readings were, necessarily, superfi
cial," I larrison said.
Assoc. Asian Languages Prof.

Haun Saussy, who is team teaching
"The Word and the World" with
English Prof. Larry Friedlander and
History Prof. Timothy Lenoir, rcit
eratcd many of I larrison's points.
"It was counterproductive to just
teach so many books," said Saussy,
whose course will offer five works
instead of the common 10 offered in
CIV.
1 larrison said the goal of the first
quarter course is to develop the im
mediate capacity to read rigorously
and analytically and to appreciate
how inexhaustible and endlessly re
readable a classic truly is
A major purpose of "Why Read
It?" — which will cover only four
books — "is not to do 'coverage,' but
to select works that give multiple
perspectives of analysis," Harrison
said.
'Hie opportunity to have three
professors teaching a first quarter

freshman course is "a luxury," Elam
said.
"Introduction to the Humani
ties" offers smaller depart merits that
would otherwise not have the re
sources to teach a three-quarter CIV
sequence the ability to get involved,
Saussy said.
" I"he change lowers the harrier
for getting into [the Area One Pro
gram] with one or two courses," said
Saussy. " ITiis is important."
Three distinct winter-spring se
quences will be offered this year, in
cluding "The Ancient Mediter
ranean World," "Myth and Moder
nity," which no longer has a similar
(IV sequence being offered this
year, and "Great Works II III," a
continuation of "Great Works I."
Although the new program will
replace CIV, the Program in Struc
tured Liberal Education will remain
intact, said Elam.
