# CIV replacement pilot begins
## 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
In addition to the beginning of
fall quarter classes, today also marks
the partial implementation of a new
program designed to satisfy the
Area One requirement.
"Introduction to the Humani
ties" will replace the Cultures, Ideas
and Values program when it is fully
implemented in 2(XX). Until then,
freshmen have the option of choos

ing between the two programs.
Under the new program, unani
mously approved by the Faculty
Senate in May, each freshman will
take a one-quarter introductory
course taught by a team of faculty
members in fall quarter and a subse
quent two-quarter thematic se
quence in winter and spring quar
ters. Freshmen will choose the initial
fall quarter course before matricu
lating and the winter-spring se
quence after arriving at Stanford.

"There will most likely be be
tween four and eight first-quarter
classes given and between six and 12
second-quarter sequences offered,"
said Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry
Elam, the director of the Area One
Program, which for now encompass
es both "Introduction to the Hu
manities" and CIV. "Ideally we
would have six first-quarter courses
and nine second-quarter courses."
The number of courses to be of
fered when the program is fully irn

plemented was not included in the
highly-debated legislation.
This year, the Area One Program
offers three Introduction to Human
ities courses: "The Word and the
World: Conversations Across Time
and Space"; "Great Works I," which
is a revamped version of its CIV
namesake; and "Why Read It?"
" This has never been done be
fore," said French and Italian Prof.
