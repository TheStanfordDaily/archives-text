# Savoyards mix operetta with academia

Few performing groups can lay claim to having a
Nobel laureates as cast members, yet in 25 years the
Stanford Savoyards have had five.
Phe Savoyards, who derive their name from the
Savoy Theater in London, are a group of students, facul
ty, staff and alumni who perform Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas on campus. The group, founded in 1973, will
celebrate its 25th anniversary next year.

Over the years, it has included Nobel laureates in
physics Burton Richter, Richard Taylor and Douglas
Osheroff and in economics William Sharpe and Kenneth
Arrow.
Physics Prof. Osheroff won his Nobel Prize last year a
few months after appearing in the production of "Rud
digore," performed periodically since 1975.
"We try to involve eminent faculty," said Rita Taylor,
executive producer of the Savoyards for 24 years. The
practice has been a tradition since the very first produc

tion of "Ruddigore."
The faculty and administrators arc often woven into a
scene in the second act of the supernatural operetta as
"ghost ancestors."
This year, however, the Savoyards will not he per
forming "Ruddigore." Their fall production will he
"HMS Pinafore," Nov. 7,8, 14, 15 and 16. Auditions for
the fall performance begin today.
"[The Savoyards'] origin was mostly in the Music De
partment," said Rita Taylor, wife of Nobel laureate
Richard. It was formed by a group of graduate and un
dergraduate students, with a few faculty and staff.
Over the years, however, it has become "more com
munity-oriented," Taylor said, as the student audience
fluctuated and involvement of alumni, staff, family and
faculty increased.
In addition to the Nobel laureates, "Ruddigore" per
formers have included former University President
Richard Lyman, Stanford I rustee Otis Pease and vari
ous deans including former Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and former Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter.
The Savoyards' first production was "Pirates of Pen
zance."Throughout the 1980s they remained immensely
popular and even staged several summer productions,
under the direction of an music graduate student, Henry
Rosack.
In June they competed at a Ciilbert and Sullivan festi
val in Berkeley, netting a Best Supporting Actress prize
and national recognition. The Wall Street Journal re
viewed their performance and "noted [the Savoyards)
for quality and our standards" according to sophomore
Doy ( harnsupharindr.
I hey will be celebrating their anniversary with a per
formance of "Patience" in late April. Their anniversary
celebration will include alumni and past performers
from across the nation and a campaign to broaden their
