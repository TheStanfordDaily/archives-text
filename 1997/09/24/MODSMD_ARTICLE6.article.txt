University President Gerhard Casper honored
57 students for their performance during the fresh
man year as part of Sophomore Welcome activities
yesterday afternoon.
I he President's Award is given to students who
"h;ive exceptionally distinguished academic
records that exemplify a strong program of study in
the freshman year," according to the Stanford Bul
letin. Students normally must h;ive completed
Wuting and ( ritical Thinking and ( IV hist year for
consideration.
A panel appointed on behalf of ( asperchose the
winners. Nominations came from advisers and pro
fessors who have worked closely with freshmen and
a list provided by University Registrar Roger Print
up.
In addition to recognition in front of their class
mates, the winners will attend small-group lunches
at the Faculty Club with Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldivar later in the
year. This gives the recipients and Saldivar an o|v
portunity to discuss factors that made their fresh
man years successful, said I .aura Selznick, director
of Undergraduate Research Opportunities.
Saldivar explained the importance of honoring
students lor their achievements during their first
year. "When we only do the awards after four years,
it doesn't lake into account the changes students go
through," he said.
" The first year's tough," Saldivar noted. "It'sim-
portant for us to recognize the ob
stacles and triumphs."
Selznick added: "I think it's reas
suring for students to know that the
faculty do notice them."
Winners of the honor seemed to
agree. "It's good to know that the
University remembers the sopho
mores," said Raj Kulkarni.

"It's definitely special," recipient
Will Cain added.
The awards were just one part of
the afternoon's activities. Sopho
mores also listened to older students
stress the importance of exploring
options during their sophomore
years and the freedom that Stanford
affords.
"Not everything needs to be done
in the sophomore year," senior
Sophia Ford said "The road you
take doesn't have to be a rigid and

well-traveled path."
"Don't create barriers that don't
exist," added junior Paul Bodnar,
who used a Chappell-Lougee grant
to do research on Egyptian hiero
glyphics last year.
Hut the most well received com
ment of the afternoon came from
President Casper. After noting that
the next millennium does not offi
cially begin until 2001, he told the
class of2ooo, "You are the highpoint
of the second millennium."
