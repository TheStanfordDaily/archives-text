# ASSU fees jump
## Students pay higher rates after generosity at last spring's polls 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Returning undergraduates glanc
ing at their autumn quarter Univer
sity bill may have been surprised to
discover a 75.2 percent increase in
ASSU special fees levies.
Undergraduates will pay $156 to
special-fee groups over the course of
this school year. Meanwhile, gradu
ate students will pay $66. Last year
undergraduates and graduates were
assessed $89 and $63 respectively.
Many students were shocked at
the magnitude of this year's fee in
crease. "I was surprised by the per
centage jump," said Will Cain, a
sophomore majoring in symbolic
systems. "If it increases the same
percentage every year I would be a
little upset."

The University charges students
the fees on the tuition bill, and the
ASSU distributes those monies to
the appropriate student groups.
Every spring the student body votes
to approve individual fee requests
proposed by campus organizations.
L.ast year, the student body voted
for every request but one — an un
precedented show of support for stu
dent groups.
"Groups weie successful because
students value the services special
fees prov ide," said ASSI I Vice Pres
ident Ben Decker. "When groups
requested funds, students were very
receptive."
According to the ASSU Consti
tution, a group obtains funding if it
meets two voting requirements: It
must receive a majority of the votes
cast, and that majority must total 15

percent of those eligible to vote.
for the past two years, groups
had the option to request funding
from undergraduates, graduates, or
both populations.
Previously, organizations were
not given the option to target a spe
cific student population — they
could only ask for funds from the en
tire student body. Some organiza
tions who were denied funding could

have received money if that option
had existed.
Three years ago, "people were
mad that fees were very high, and
graduate students were upset," said
Donald Coleman, chief executive of
ficer of Stanford Student Enterpris
es, the business side of the ASSU.
"After the 1995-% school year, we

overhauled the way fees were as
sessed. With this amendment, the
Common Sense Reform, graduates
were removed from the undergrad
uate funding pool.
"Historically, graduates vote less
than undergraduates and they vote
'yes' less frequently," Coleman said.
"When you look at who's getting the
money, it's mostly groups that apply

exclusively to undergraduates."
Coleman expects about $1.2 mil
lion to be distributed through his of
fice to student organizations.
Groups such as SCBN, which for
several years had failed to receive
funding from the combined student
body, won approval for the first time
last year when they chose to apply
only to undergraduates.
"This is a very equitable way to
fund a wide variety of groups," said
Coleman. "Now undergraduates are
doing things that they couldn't have

done otherwise."
Meanwhile, graduates are not
forced to pay for services or pro
grams which they don't use.
"Graduates lead a separate
lifestyle," Decker added. "They
have separate needs and their lives
are not centered on campus events."
Students who object to paying
fees for a student group can apply
for a refund through the World
Wide Web at http://assu.stanford.
edu/refund. The refund request will
apply to all three quarters.
