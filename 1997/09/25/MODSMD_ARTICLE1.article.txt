## Students pay higher rates after generosity at last spring's polls

Returning undergraduates glanc
ing at their autumn quarter Univer
sity bill may have been surprised to
discover a 75.2 percent increase in
ASSU special fees levies.
Undergraduates will pay $156 to
special-fee groups over the course of
this school year. Meanwhile, gradu

undergraduates and graduates were
assessed $89 and $63 respectively.
Many students were shocked at

must receive a majority of the votes
cast, and that majority must total 15

percent of those eligible to vote.
for the past two years, groups
had the option to request funding
from undergraduates, graduates, or
both populations.
Previously, organizations were
not given the option to target a spe
cific student population — they
could only ask for funds from the en
tire student body. Some organiza
tions who were denied funding could

have received money if that option
had existed.
Three years ago, "people were
mad that fees were very high, and
graduate students were upset," said
Donald Coleman, chief executive of
