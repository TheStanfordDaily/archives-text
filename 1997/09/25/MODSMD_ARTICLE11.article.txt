## Editorial Activism, Stanford-style 
### 
IN THE LATEST ISSUE of Mother
Jones — a liberal magazine of inves
tigative journalism — Stanford was
rated as one of the ten most activist cam
puses in the nation.
It's easy to understand why many stu
dents and staff may have approached this
research with legitimate skepticism. After
all, who would expect that a student body
like ours, which is often characterized as
"apathetic," would rank as the fifth most
activist campus on campus?
That Mother Jones gave Stanford such a
high rating is certainly not cause for us to
take credit and feel proud of our achieve
ments in the realm of activist causes.
The article recognized not the activism
of Stanford students in general, but the
activities surrounding two issues that the
student body as a whole gives very little
attention: freeing Burma from corporate
power, and improving access to campus
resources for students with disabilities.
Both issues occupy only the periphery of
most of our minds.
It's true that Pepsico stopped doing
business with Burma, and this move was
largely credited to the outcries of Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford and
other students across the nation against
human rights abuses. However, it is also
true that the majority of students on cam
pus wanted a Taco Bell moved into
Tresidder Union despite the concerns of
SEAS.
Similarly, renovations to several Stan
ford buildings to comply with the Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act began soon after
students protested with flyers criticizing the
poor level of campus accessibility. But, how
many bikes did you see on your way to class
or to work yesterday that blocked access to
a stairway on campus?
Activism at Stanford is more often than
not an isolated and little-recognized area

where the majority of students avoid any
strong stance.
it is "politically correct" to simply have
an open mind, and accept "diversity" and
"individualism" of the campus in its entire
ty. It's not often that you see a Stanford stu
dent or faculty member rising up to support
Pepsico in Burma.
Students, faculty and staff respect the
plight of many activist groups on campus,
hut fail to join in the rally or for that matter,
opposition to the rally. The political cor
rectness of this community seems to pre
vent us to from committing ourselves much
at all.
To most people on campus, an activist
cause is just another activist-cause.
The article in Mother Jones didn't men
tion all these examples of activism at Stan
ford. There are those who fight for workers'
rights and there are those who fight for
minority representation. In the past year
alone we've seen individuals and groups on
campus speaking out for labor issues, envi
ronmental issues, affirmative action, gay/
lesbian rights, multicultural education and a
number of other causes.
The success of many causes championed
by these students deserves more recogni
tion. The fact that it takes an article in a
magazine outside of campus for us to rec
ognize the impact of just two of the many
movements says something about our own
inattention to these issues.
Not everyone has to be an activist, and
not everyone has to agree with every
activist cause. Hut perhaps it's time that we
take interest in the issues being fought out
on our campus and in society, and either
take a stance of criticism, or give credit
where it is due.
It's better to have an opinion and
express it than to sit back and silently pre
tend to agree in a mire of political correct
ness or apathy.
