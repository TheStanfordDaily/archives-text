## Emily Andrus Taking time out to reorient 
### 
This week I discov
ered Stanford.
Again.
I saw eager, new faces
and met people from all
over the world. I sat
enveloped by "red roofs
and azure skies" (and

baked in the sun) as I listened to President
Casper's famous "Why are you here?"
speech echo off the walls of the Quad.
I was reoriented.
I attended a cappella fest, Faces in the
Community and MuFuUnSun. I explored
my new residence. I wavered back and forth
for hours on exactly which classes to take. I
considered what it means to be part of a
community. In many ways I relived my
freshman experience. But this time it was
different.
This summer, working as an investment
banking analyst and living with four Stan
ford graduates in San Francisco, I saw life
after Stanford first hand. I thought a lot
about the unique opportunities and daunt
ing responsibilities that lay ahead of me in
my last year of college. It wasn't until I sat
in a dark auditorium listening to my fresh
man roommate, Kamron, performing the
last solo of her Stanford a cappella career
that I fully realized what had changed. I no
longer have the curious excitement of a first
year student. I have the urgent excitement
of a senior. While Kamron's voice captivat
ed a packed Memorial Auditorium, I
looked back upon my Stanford career, this
time with a new perspective.
Ever since my freshman year I have been

setting goals and working toward the next
step — running the entire way. During this
year of extensive commitments in which 1
will have to eventually make the dreaded
decision about the direction of my life, I
promised myself that 1 will no longer run.
Not this year.
That is not to say that I will not have my
share of unsuccessful balancing acts. There
will be moments when 1 question whether 1
have made too many commitments. I will
undoubtedly worry about making the right
career choices, not to mention about getting
the interviews necessary to realize those
choices. I recognize that senior year will
keep me busy and my schedule full. It is
now up to me to fill it with as many mean
ingful experiences as time permits... and
then maybe a couple more.
This is why I value this reorientation, this
welcome to the last year of an incredible era
of my life. Every program I attended, every
poster I saw, every conversation I over
heard last weekend reminded me of my
freshman year and reminded me of all the
things I will never forget about the life I live
at Stanford.
The page in the Freshman ASSU mailer
I sent out this summer that is most mean
ingful to me says this: "Get involved. Gain
experience. Make a difference." I hope that
if I were to choose to live my life according
to a formula it would be this.
Stanford presents us all with a world of
opportunity to get involved, to gain experi
ence and to make a difference — whether
in a University policy, our academic pur
suits, a service organization on campus or
the life of our next door neighbor. Our

challenge is to find a part of this world in
which we can best participate. I know that
as 1 look back at the decisions I have made
in the past couple of years, 1 will never
regret committing time to dillerent organi
zations, taking a break from studying to get
acquainted with my peers and missing a
couple hours of sleep to sit and talk with my
roommates. For all the time I have put into
Stanford, 1 have received much more in
return.
As 1 embark on the remainder of my
Stanford experience, 1 will take with me this
new-found awareness and cling to each
experience just a moment longer. 1 will stop
to watch the sun set over foothills. 1 will visit
the Rodin sculpture garden. I will enjoy the
crisp silhouette of palm trees against the
midnight sky as I make my way home from
the ASSU.
This year, like last year and the vear
before that, a new crop of Stanford seniors
will travel this captivating and tumultuous
journey of our last undergraduate year. A
new batch of freshman will discover a lot
about Stanford and even more about them
selves. Sophomores and juniors will return
to a campus where they feel increasingly
more at homo.
In the meanwhile, my task is clear. 1 will
continue to make lasting relationships and
immerse myself in serving the school and
people who have given so much to me.
I have 263 days, twelve hours, a couple
minutes... and not a moment to spare.
