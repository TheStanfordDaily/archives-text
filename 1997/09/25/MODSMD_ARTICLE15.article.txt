Old boy network continues to exist at Stanford Medical Center

A recent cluster of departures by
women physicians, which may or
may not be connected, is having a
profound effect on students at the Medical
Center and all of Stanford. These women
are our research sponsors, our mentors,
our caregivers and, above all, our role
models.
Of course the administration will point
to the numbers and emphasize that men
leave as frequently as women. However,
one woman makes up a far greater propor
tion of female faculty members than does
one man among the men. ITiere are 37
tenured women on the faculty of the
School of Medicine. This is nearly 10 more
than in 19%. but still only represents 15
percent of total tenured faculty, 2()6 of
which are men.
Who are the women that arc leaving.'

Most notably, there is Dr. Susan Anderson
a well-respected and popular physician at
Cowell. An article published in The Daily
on Tuesday addressed some of the ques
tions students have been asking since Dr.
Anderson's contract was not renewed ear
lier this year, but her case is just the tip of
what might be a very large iceberg.
There are other women as well. Some,
like Dr. Anderson, fall prey to contract ter
mination, while others leave of their own
accord. These doctors often express the
opinion that they did not feel that they
were working in a "woman-friendly envi
ronment" here at Stanford and that their
views and efforts were largely unnoticed, if
not outright thwarted.
One prominent physician at the medical
center was very outspoken about individu
al choices and independence. She spoke

openly with medical students and was her
self a shining example of tolerance. From
her, students learned respect, which can
have a great impact on the patient-physi
cian relationship and the outcome of care.
Additionally, this physician was eager to
teach students on a one-on-one basis and
was a research advisor for many.
Now that her contract has been termi
nated, students can no longer do research
under her tutelage or learn from her lead
ership.
Certainly all this talk of women leaving
will remind some of Frances Conley, who,
in 1 Wl. resigned as chair of neurosurgery
to protest the sexual harassment she, and
others, perceived at Stanford Medical
School.
What kind of environment are we learn
ing in when, seven vears later, in an inter

view in "Stanford Today" Dr. Conley is
asked, "Do you feel you are still a pariah?"
and her answer is, "Yes, absolutely." You
can't help but wonder about the values
imbued and examples set when the strong
women, the outspoken women and the
women who will stand up for a cause feel
like "pariahs."
Given the changing face of medicine,
toward a more preventative and inclusive
focus, Stanford and its medical school can
not afford to maintain an environment
where women are falling by the wayside,
leaving in search of more supportive col
leagues. We cannot continue to operate
under the "old boy network" model of pro
fessional conduct.
Students of all levels — undergraduates,
graduate students and medical students
alike — should recognize the great travesty

that is occurring and make efforts to sup
port their role models and to encourage
the administration to do everything possi
ble to keep strong women role models
where we need them, right here on the fac
ulty.
After all, such role models are part of
the quality we expect in a Stanford educa
tion — the service these women provided
in this capacity should have been more
carefully considered in evaluating them
and/or making efforts to retain them. We
expect more attention to be paid to this
issue in the future — while Susan Ander
son and others may be lost to us, the func
tion they fulfilled must not.
