The Language Corner is reborn.
Thanks to generous support from the Pigott family
following the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the building
that houses many of Stanford's language programs was
renamed Pigott Hall in a dedication ceremony yesterday.
University President Gerhard Casper, Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Charles Pigott, a Stanford trustee, ad
dressed faculty, staff and other Pigott family members
who gathered to celebrate the reopening of the language
programs' new home.
The damage to the University caused by the earth
quake led to $250 million in restoration and seismic work,
Casper said.
"The Pigott family's commitment gave much-needed
assistance that allowed us to move the project forward,"
he added.
Casper also lauded the Pigotts' academic contribution
to Stanford.
"The University also benefited from their knowl-

edge as students," said Casper. Fifteen members of the
Pigott family have attended Stanford in the past decades.
The Pigott gift is a very timely one, as it facilitates
Stanford's growing identity as an international universi
ty, Rice noted. "We have a heavy responsibility to make
certain that our students are initiated to languages and
cultures of other nations," she said.
The renovation of the language corner is historically
accurate, preserving the colors, paint and even the light
ing of the pre-earthquake days, said Donna Robertson,
director of donor relations at the Office of Development.
The restoration won the 1997 Preservation Design
Award from the California Preservation Foundation.
The Pigott family's connection to Stanford dates back
to the early 1920s when Paul Pigott earned a bachelor's
degree in geology and mining.
Paul Pigott served as a Stanford trustee from 1957
until his death in 1961. His son, Charles Pigott, became a
trustee in 1993.
"Stanford has had a greater influence on the Pigott
family of three generations than anything else,"
Charles Pigott said.
