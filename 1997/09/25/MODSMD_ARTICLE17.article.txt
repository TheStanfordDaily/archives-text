## Men's soccer looks to continue winning ways 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The 12th-ranked Stanford men's soccer team opens
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play at home to
morrow with two goals: maintaining its perfect record
for the season and beating a team that kept it out of
NCAA tournament play last year.
The Cardinal (7-0) is looking to extend its school
record 12-game winning streak — the longest in the na
tion — with a win over Sacramento State at 5 p.m. at
New Maloney Field. The same matchup last year re
sulted in a 2-2 tie.

■ TOMORROW: Stanford (7-0-) vs. Sacramento
State (1-7) at New Maloney Field, 5 p.m.

But the Hornets (1-7) are a better team than their
reeord this year shows, said Stanford head coach Bobby
Clark.
"They're having a tough season results-wise," Clark
said, "but 1 watched them a week ago, and they're a
team that could certainly hurt us."
Clark, however, reiterated his confidence that his
team can top anyone with the right mindset. The tough
est thing about this weekend's contest is getting in the
best frame of mind.
After several weeks of having the campus to them
selves and nothing but soccer to think about, the play
ers were confronted with choosing classes, paying bills
and catching up with friends this week.
"The preseason is over for us now," Clark said.
"This is always a difficult time. There's no reason for it
to be a difficult time, but we've gone from having the
campus to ourselves and nothing to do but focus on soc
cer to suddenly [having] players running around with
classes."
In recent practices, Clark has tried to combat the
stress and excitement by emphasizing that the players

should clear their minds of everything but soccer by Fri
day.
He wants to ensure, he said, that no one is "running
around making sure you've got the correct amount of
units. If you leave these things to the last minute, you'll
be running around on Friday afternoon trying to take
care of things."
Last season, the team's first game after the start of
classes resulted in a loss. "One of our poorest perfor
mances was against Cal State-Northridge, and it was
the same weekend," Clark said. "It's so important that
they're able to make the adjustment from the presea
son atmosphere to the student-athlete atmosphere."
One thing that will help the team concentrate on the
game is a desire to top the Hornets this year, said junior
defender Jamie Clark, who was named offensive MVP
at last week's St. Mary's Fall Soccer Classic.
Despite its record, Sacramento State is "a good
team, and we've had problems with them in the past,"
he said. "This season has been a lot about getting a lit
tle revenge on teams that got us out of the tournament
in the past." That includes both Cal-State Northridge
and Sacramento State.
The Cardinal will focus on the Sacramento State
midfield. Though there won't be any changes to Stan
ford's game plan to account for the Hornet's strong
midfield, Clark said, that's where pressure may come.
"They have a good midfield," he said. "If we let
them get into the game at all, they could hurt us without
question."
Sacramento State did lose one of its better forwards
to graduation last year.
"I suppose that's a plus," Clark said. "He was the
one player who caused a lot of problems. Hut they've
got a lot of solid players."
The game will not be approached as win No. 13 in
the streak, Clark said, but rather as "the most impor
tant game of the season."
A win will likely help Stanford continue to move up
