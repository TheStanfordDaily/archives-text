# Johnson conies up big for S.F. Giants
## 
### 
When all is said and done in
the San Francisco Giants'
1997 season, Marcus
Jensen may turn out to be the team's
most valuable non-player.
You see, he was the inconsequen
tial half of the July 16 trade with the
Detroit Tigers that brought Oakland
native and Stanford alumnus Brian
Johnson back to the Bay Area. Most
people usually point to the July 31
trade with the White Sox that
brought Roberto Hernandez, Danny
Darwin and Wilson Alvarez to San
Francisco as the shot in the arm the
Giants needed to battle the archrival
Dodgers down the stretch.

But Johnson's presence may be
what makes the difference, or at least
provides some distinct snapshots of a
memorable pennant race.
Sure, he's been a steadying influ
ence for a weary and patchwork
pitching staff since his arrival, while
also providing some occasional pop
from the eighth spot in the batting
order (.281 batting average, 11 home
runs). It's just that lately, that pop has
become a sonic boom that has clearly
rattled the Dodgers' fortunes.
Take Sept. 18 at the stadium for
merly known as Candlestick. More
than 52,000 maniacal Giants fans wit
nessed a classic see-saw battle be
tween the two bitter rivals.
San Francisco desperately needed
a win to forge a first-place tie. With a
5-5 deadlock in the 12th inning, John
son led off the inning against Dodger
reliever Mark Guthrie. One fat pitch
later, Johnson had touched off the
biggest block party this side of Mardi
Gras.
"It's been fun," Johnson said.
"What's been nice about it is that
everybody has played a part, even
me. I've been here two months and
the whole roster has really con
tributed, which is really unusual."
The 1990 Stanford graduate
knows all about entire team efforts
from his years on the Farm. He
played six positions and batted .2%
for Stanford's back-to-back College

World Series championship teams in
1987-88.
With future major leaguers like
Ed Sprague, Jack McDowell and
Mike Mussina littering the Stanford
roster, it was clear that Johnson's
catching career would have to be put
on hold. Not to say that he was with
out his moments in the sun, such as
the two-run double he hit in the 1988
title game against Arizona State.
"We just had a great team," John
son said. "We all got along really well
and played very similar to [the Gi
ants] in that we were underdogs in
both those national championship
games. Those were great times."
But there was more than baseball
on Johnson's mind when he came out
of Skyline High in Oakland in 1986.
After all, one doesn't get named Cal
ifornia Athlete of the Year three
straight years by just excelling in one
sport. A talented prep quarterback
with solid scrambling ability, Johnson
wanted to pursue both sports serious
ly in college. Stanford was really the
only school that realistically provided
that opportunity.
"They were the only ones with the
good track record of letting guys play
both sports all four years," Johnson
said. "Both programs were very
strong, especially for a quarterback
where you get a chance to throw the
ball. Also, the Stanford education
was a big plus because you really
carf t compare it to any other school."
Playing time did not come right
away on the gridiron, as Johnson red
shirted the 1986 season. Neverthe
less, he was able to learn a great deal
from quarterback John Paye, who
along with running back Brad Muster
guided the Cardinal to a Gator Bowl
berth. At least that's what Johnson
claims.
In Detroit, "they were asking me
questions for the media guide," John
son said, "and they asked if I'd ever
been to a bowl game. I said yes, in
1986 I was part of the team, but I red
shirted that year and I didn't play. It
comes out in the media guide as 'I led
the team to the Gator Bowl.'
"That story's taken on a life of its
own. ESPN has run it. You know, I
thought they were going to start say
ing I won the Heisman Trophy in the
next sentence."
However, Johnson can correctly
claim he's won as many Big Games as
Stanford legend John Elway: one.
That was a resounding 31 -7 victory in
