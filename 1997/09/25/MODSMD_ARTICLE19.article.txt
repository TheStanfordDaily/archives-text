When the Stanford eross country team hosts the
Stanford Invitational this Saturday at the Stanford C iolf
Course, one of the women competing for the Cardinal
will be freshman Julia Stamps.
Although only a freshman, Stamps is very familiar
with the course.
"I'll probably know this course better than anyone
by the time I get out of here," Stamps said.
Not only does she know the course, she holds the
current high school record for it. A native of nearby
Santa Rosa, Stamps has been competing here for years.
For the geographically challenged, Santa Rosa hap
pens to be right in the middle of Sonoma County,
known for its wine and enchanting countryside.
"I love Sonoma County, it's so beautiful there. I can
see myself ending up back there," Stamps said.
That made deciding on Stanford an easy choice.
Being an only child, Stamps is very close to both of her
parents, and Stanford is not far from home.
But that's not the only thing that gave Stanford the
edge over other schools.
"The track team is awesome. It's a neat society, its
own little world," Stamps said. "It's beautiful, in Cali
fornia, the academics are strong, and there's so much
diversity. When I lined up my pluses and minuses, I
couldn't find any negatives."
Stamps applied for early admission last year and
didn't bother filling out an application anywhere else,
which was good news for head coach Vin Lananna and
the rest of the cross country squad.
"Stanford is really a perfect match for her," Lanan
na said. "She's made a very smooth transition."
Stamps is regarded as the women's top recruit. I ler
career highlights speak for themselves. In high school,
she was a national cross country champion, as well as a
three-time state champion.
Last year, she won both the I,6<K) and 1,2()0 meter
state titles in track and field. Stamps also won the },2(X)
meter junior national title four years in a row.
Stamps has also demonstrated her talent on an in
ternational level. She has competed in the Pan Am
games in both Chile and Cuba, taking the 3,(XX)-meter
title in Chile. She has raced for six United States Track

and Field teams in several European
countries, including Budapest, Por
tugal and England.
"Racing in Europe is a lot differ
ent than racing in the United
States," Stamps said. "Whoever
makes it to the finish line wins. Each
trip you go on, you learn something
different. Here, if you hump some
body with your elbow, you're dis
qualified. There, it's a good race
strategy. Somebody stepped on my
shoe, and it ripped in half."
Stamps has learned much more
than just race strategy in her many
trips abroad. Cuba stands out in her
mind as one place that really opened
her eyes.
"It's such a poor country,"
Stamps said. "I just wanted to ask
what I eould do to help out. It really

makes you appreciate what you
have and not take things for grant
ed."
Stamps started running in the
sixth grade. Had she been a better
soccer player, though, she may not
have ended up where she is today.
"I used to play soccer. I think the
coaches felt bad about cutting me
from the team." Stamps said, "so
they suggested that I run distances. I
started out in the 2(X) meters and the
high jump, but I wasn't fast. Then I
started running distance."
For most of her career. Stamps
has trained alone. But she's also
found that running with a team
makes things a lot easier.
"She's a young lady who's very
team-oriented," said assistant coach
Beth Alford-Sullivan. "She's been
an asset to the team. She's very
coachable, very willing to go with
the flow, learning as she goes."
Stamps has gone with the flow
since she got to the Farm. Like the

other freshmen, she's getting used to
CIV and finding her classes. Her
mom helped out with the dorm
room decorating before Stamps got
back from preseason training, which
made moving in a little easier.
"There were some things that I
didn't like that much, but I didn't
want to tell her," Stamps said, "so
I'm kind of rearranging my room a
little now."
Although her academic plans
are not solid at this early point in
her career, growing up in the wine
country has had an influence. Her
interests lie in viticulture, and she
may decide to further her education
at UC-Davis or Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
Her interests also lie in future
successes in track and field and cross
country. In the back of her mind, the
Olympics loom, as they do in the
minds of most athletes her caliber.
But for now. Stamps is taking
things one race at a time.
