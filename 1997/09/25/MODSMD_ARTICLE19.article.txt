When the Stanford eross country team hosts the
Stanford Invitational this Saturday at the Stanford C iolf
Course, one of the women competing for the Cardinal
will be freshman Julia Stamps.
Although only a freshman, Stamps is very familiar
with the course.
"I'll probably know this course better than anyone
by the time I get out of here," Stamps said.
Not only does she know the course, she holds the
current high school record for it. A native of nearby
Santa Rosa, Stamps has been competing here for years.
For the geographically challenged, Santa Rosa hap
pens to be right in the middle of Sonoma County,
known for its wine and enchanting countryside.
"I love Sonoma County, it's so beautiful there. I can
see myself ending up back there," Stamps said.
That made deciding on Stanford an easy choice.
Being an only child, Stamps is very close to both of her
parents, and Stanford is not far from home.
But that's not the only thing that gave Stanford the
edge over other schools.
"The track team is awesome. It's a neat society, its
own little world," Stamps said. "It's beautiful, in Cali
fornia, the academics are strong, and there's so much
diversity. When I lined up my pluses and minuses, I
couldn't find any negatives."
Stamps applied for early admission last year and
didn't bother filling out an application anywhere else,
which was good news for head coach Vin Lananna and
the rest of the cross country squad.
"Stanford is really a perfect match for her," Lanan
na said. "She's made a very smooth transition."
Stamps is regarded as the women's top recruit. I ler
career highlights speak for themselves. In high school,
she was a national cross country champion, as well as a
three-time state champion.
Last year, she won both the I,6<K) and 1,2()0 meter
state titles in track and field. Stamps also won the },2(X)
meter junior national title four years in a row.
Stamps has also demonstrated her talent on an in
ternational level. She has competed in the Pan Am
games in both Chile and Cuba, taking the 3,(XX)-meter
title in Chile. She has raced for six United States Track
