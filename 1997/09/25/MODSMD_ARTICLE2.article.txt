# Undersea adventure and a lofting tool
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
As students move into their dorm rooms this week,
few will put as much effort into decorating their rooms
as Erin Thompson, who makes it an ongoing project
each year.
Last year, her home under the sea included a life
size whale, an octopus with three-dimensional lips,
and various species of fish that swam on all sides of her
dark blue walls. The water trickled from the fountain
underneath her loft, where live fish actually swam.
"It's natural for me to he underwater," Thompson
said as she Hopped down backward onto her queen
size waterbed. By birth, Thompson is a Pisces, the fish
sign on the astrological calendar.
Like a true Pisces, Thompson likes California be
cause it is close to the ocean and warmer than her na
tive state of Maine. As a water skier, she thrives in the
warm climate.
Thompson competed in the All -S t; u tournament
as captain of Stanford's water-skiing team and placed
16th in the nation last year.
When the phone rang, Thompson would scramble
into her submarine to answer it. When home on the
first floor of the Enchanted Broccoli I orest,she spent
most of her time in the submarine, the area beneath
her loft.
The communication major wrote her papers for
class from the computer inside her sub. I langing from
the ceiling of the loft, the computer also functioned as
the control panel of her submarine.
"Basically, I live this fantasy life," she said.
Thompson lives her fantasy life in everyday practi
cal terms according to a simple carjte diem philoso
phy.
"I make it a point to have as much fun as possible,"
she said. "You only live once, so seize the day."
"One of my friends told me that my job at Stanford

is to be perpetually stoked," she
said.
Acknowledging the truth of it,
Thompson added, "People are al
ways looking to me to get them psy
ched up."
Thompson models her life of fun
for others. Last year, when not in
Oasis 1 ()4, the name of her underwa
ter room, she could be seen riding
her unicycle to class, playing the
trumpet in the Stanford Band or

doing both at the same time.
Thompson also plays and sings in
a group called "Eating like Truck
Drivers," which debuted at the Cof
fee House last spring.
Her other joys include oil paint
ing, photography and looking for in
teresting collectibles for her room at
flea markets and thrift stores. Fish
shaped candles, an anchor for her
door-stop and rocks from the Russ
ian River lined her walls.
Oasis 104 was a museum of those
collectibles, displaying Thompson's
eye for art and creative spirit. She
painted all the murals herself in the

beginning of the school year, built
her own loft for the submarine and
set up the water pipe for her foun
tain.
Before falling sleep, Thompson
performed a nightly ritual: first un
plugging the Easter and Christmas
lights that streamed across her room
before turning on her disco ball,
which projected hundreds of mov
ing bubbles along her ocean walls.
As always, Thompson falls
asleep to the fantasy world. In a way,
she has mastered the art of living
what she dreams.
