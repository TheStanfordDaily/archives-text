# Undersea adventure and a lofting tool
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
As students move into their dorm rooms this week,
few will put as much effort into decorating their rooms
as Erin Thompson, who makes it an ongoing project
each year.
Last year, her home under the sea included a life
size whale, an octopus with three-dimensional lips,
and various species of fish that swam on all sides of her
dark blue walls. The water trickled from the fountain
underneath her loft, where live fish actually swam.
"It's natural for me to he underwater," Thompson
said as she Hopped down backward onto her queen
size waterbed. By birth, Thompson is a Pisces, the fish
sign on the astrological calendar.
Like a true Pisces, Thompson likes California be
cause it is close to the ocean and warmer than her na
tive state of Maine. As a water skier, she thrives in the
warm climate.
Thompson competed in the All -S t; u tournament
as captain of Stanford's water-skiing team and placed
16th in the nation last year.
When the phone rang, Thompson would scramble
into her submarine to answer it. When home on the
first floor of the Enchanted Broccoli I orest,she spent
most of her time in the submarine, the area beneath
her loft.
The communication major wrote her papers for
class from the computer inside her sub. I langing from
the ceiling of the loft, the computer also functioned as
the control panel of her submarine.
"Basically, I live this fantasy life," she said.
Thompson lives her fantasy life in everyday practi
cal terms according to a simple carjte diem philoso
phy.
"I make it a point to have as much fun as possible,"
she said. "You only live once, so seize the day."
"One of my friends told me that my job at Stanford
