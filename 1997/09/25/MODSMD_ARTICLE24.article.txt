# THE
						FURTHER YOU GO, THE ROUNDER YOU GET: CHUCK GARVEY OF MOE. HOLDS COURT
## 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
On the morning of Wednesday, Sept. 17, Intermission hud
the chance to speak with Chuck Garvey, guitarist and vo
calist for the hand moe. After a summer spent as the open
ingact on the Further Festival tour, Garvey fled to his girlfriend's
apartment in Cincinnati. Although the roots of the hand's name
remain a mystery, Garvey talked about playing in San Francis
co, touring with Further Festival and the string of drummers
moe. has gone through.
Intermission: I see I'm calling the 513 area code, but I don't
know where that is...
Chuck Garvey: It's Cincinnati.
I: Is that where you're from?
CG: No, I'm from Utica, New York, but right now I'm
homeless. We've been touring so much that 1 decided to go
homeless for the next six to eight months. During breaks in
the tour I generally go to my girlfriend's or my parents, so I fig
ured I'd pay one-fourth as much for storage as I would for my
apartment during that time. It's a little strange not to have a
place of my own, though.
I: What's the touring schedule for the next few months?
( (i: It's pretty heavy. I think we've got 46 shows between
now and Thanksgiving, and then we're taking December off.
I'm doing an acoustic thing fora week in I Jecember, and then
we're playing around New Year's in S.in Francisco. After that
we go right into the studio to record another album.
I: Moe. is playing .it the Great American Music Hall for
New Year's I'.ve, right?
(i: Yeah, we're playing a three-day run. It's pretty amazing
for us to do that. 1 mean, in March we had an unexpected sell
out at the C ireat American, and the crowd was great. And on
Sept. 27 we're playing at the Fillmore. So that New Year's run
will only be our third time in San Francisco!

I: That's pretty good, given that San Francisco is definitely
a town seen as a barometer for a lot of rising bands. But did
you know that Leftover Salmon, Missing Man Formation and
String Cheese Incident are playing a show together on New
Year's Eve in San Francisco?
CG: No, that's the first I've heard about it.
1: You said that moe. was going back into the studio in Jan
uary to record another album. How king will that take?
CG: Well, maybe two weeks of pre-production, four weeks
of tracking, and then another two weeks of mixing.
1:1 low much of the material that'sgoingon the album is al
ready written, and how much of that is old vs new?
CG: Some of it is written, and some of that is older stuff that
we've been playing for years but never recorded. I think the
oldest tune is 2 1/2 to 3-years old. We've also got a new batch
of songs that we've only played six or seven times in front of
audiences so far, but by January we'll have played them
throughout the fall. And we'll probably write a new batch of
songs for the album right before we go into the studio too,
which won't have been played live before we record them.
The oldest stuff was written right after we recorded "No
Doy." We wrote and rehearsed five or six new songs immedi
ately after we got out of the studio and wanted to record again
right away, but that wasn't an option.
I: I low was playing at the Further Festival?
( (1: Further was great. It was both good and frustrating at
the same time. It was good to see the massive production and
to be hanging out with these quality musicians, and Bruce
I lornsby put on an amazing show every night. We were play
ing with the big boys.
I: But...
(X i: We only got to play about 35 minutes a day. It felt like
we were playing with handcuffs because we're used to much
longer sets. It really showed us the importance of playing our
own shows and doing our own thing.
I: What about jamming with Bob Weir | rhythm guitarist

for the Grateful Dead)?
CG: It was cool. The first time he
came out during our set we played
"Mama Tried." Bob told us that the
song basically played itself, and it
did. We didn't play to perfection,
but it was fun and easy to do.
Then, Bobby told us he wanted to
jam something, really explore, and
we said 'O.K.' to that. We had played
"(That's It For) The Other One" a
year before, and so we played that at
Saratoga, which is a killer venue. It
was the best experience 1 had jam
ming on the whole tour. The end
of-the-evening jams were cool but
always felt rushed, all these musi
cians rotating through. We had lots
of space on " The Other One," and
Bobby really took it far out. I le has
a skewed sense of chords.
I: So is Bob going to show up at the
Fillmore?
CG: [Laughs] 1 have no idea what
will happen. We'll definitely have
some guests, but I can't say for cer
tain that Bob will be there.
I: Yeah, especially in San Francisco
you don't want to say that Bob will
be there if it isn't absolute.

CG: I can say for sure that Hob Weir will not be there
[ Laughs] That'll contuse them. 'What does he mean by that?
I: How was it living on the road with Further? Different
from when moe. tours alone?
CG: It's a pampered life on the road with Further. Well, I
shouldn't say that, but it was great to have catering and be
able to eat a real meal. You sort of have to do that, because
once we hit a site we were pretty much stuck there. But it was
nice to have drinks and lunch and dinner without worrying
about missing the gig.
One thing was that they hauled our gear for us. We paid
for the service, but it was nice. Another thing was, we defi
nitely got locked into a daily schedule. After a while, we real
ized that most of the amphitheaters we were playing were al
most always the same.
I: Where do you think moe. played their best shows?
CG: Our best show was definitely at Fiddler's Green out
side of Denver, CO. There was torrential rain and the field
it's more of a field than an amphitheater â€” wasn't covered,
although the stage is. But water and wind were whipping
around, the tarps over the mixing stage kept blowing offand
the first few rows of fans were standing knee deep in water
that had run down the field.
On top of that, we were afraid of being electrocuted. We
were up on stage playing our asses off, people were dancing
their asses off, and this lightening and thunderstorm kept
getting closer. It wasn't really so much of a life-and-death
thing, but there was just a tremendous energy generated that
was way above and beyond what any one band could do.
Another cool venue was near Springfield, Mass. We were
playing at a race car track set up next to the Riverside Amuse
ment Park and the stage was set up in the middle of the in
field. These kids with skateboards were shooting around the
high-banked turns of the race track and it was July 4.
I: Why has moe. had so many drummers?
CG: In any band, a good personality mix and creative
mix are necessary. We played with our first drummer, Ray
Schwartz, at a Halloween party that a mutual friend threw
in 1989 or 1990. I had known Rob Derhak [bass, vocals|
from before, and we got together and played a bunch ot
cheesy cover tunes. It was horrible and it was great, so we
kept on playing. But Ray did two things that aren't con
ducive to being in a band, namely go to graduate school and
get married.
Our second drummer, Jim, was good to start with, but he
was pretty much learning how to play as he went along, as
were Rob and 1. His style was statistically dense, which was
good tor a while, but then Rob and 1 wanted to stretch things
out more musically and Jim wanted them to stay more de
fined. An opportunity came up for him to go over to the band
Yolk, in Binghamton, and he went.
