# This Next Comic Has A Damn Good Chance Of Winning This Thing... The 22nd Annual San Francisco International Stand-Up Comedy Competition
## 
### Seth Weisburst 
Okay. You've
moved into
your room, not

ready to start classes yet, a
little down about summer
ending, and you want to hear
someone tell a few good jokes that
have nothing to do with Chelsea. I mean,
everyone's a comedian these days. My own
house mate, Dave Siegel, just interrupted me
to tell me a joke about an old man and a bowl
of custard. Ask him to tell it to you sometime.
But if you don't know Dave, I've got just the
thing for you.
On Sept. 18, the 22nd Annual San Francisco
International Stand-Up Comedy Competition
kicked off at The Edge, Palo Alto's own night
club and home to many traveling shows such as
this one. Johnny Steele introduced and emceed
the competition with a careful explanation of
the rules that was interjected with jokes about
Tiger Woods, Irish people and a drunk Ed
McMahon. His enthusiasm helped keep the
show rolling smoothly, although his commen
tary between performers received as many
groans as laughs.
Thursday night's first place winner was
James Inman, who got the loudest laughs for
his promotion of alcohol by comparing a list of

famous drunk people with famous sober people. The fa
mous drunk people included Hemingway, Faulkner and
Fitzgerald, while the list of famous sober people shined
with such stars as Saddam Hussein, Pat Sajak and the
Muppet Babies. His point was that the world might be a
much better place if the sober would do a little drinking.

Inman ended his routine by sharing his skepticism about Wal-
Mart's national decision to remove Rolling Stone, Spin, Cos
mopolitan and Sheryl Crows albums from its racks. Inman de
scribed that his way of rebelling against the company is to buy a
specific group of items that show how Wal-Mart's merchandise
can still be offensive. He wants to walk into a Wal-Mart and buy
fourteen leather belts, preteen panties, an economy-sized box of
condoms, duct tape, a power saw, plastic bags, a shovel and a candy
bar. The crowd loved him, and apparently the judges did too.
In second place was William Wesley Walls, who boogied all
around the stage with his bass guitar around his neck, shaking his
bald head back and forth. He made mediocre jokes and impres
sions into packaged material with his funky bass lines that followed
the punchlines. His material was limited, and most of his routine
involved singing and playing his bass. After explaining that the
Palo Alto Police Department didn't like him very much, he
launched into a brief cover of the Police classic "Every Breath You
Take" with slightly altered lyrics that included "Every law you
break, I'll be watchin' you."
After that he did a medley of older Prince tunes, and then he
boogied on backstage. Although he was not a great comic, Walls
was a good bassist. But Walls' fun ki tied approach was enough for

the judges, a trio of radio and newspaper personalities.
Scott Malone came in third place, a comic who looked
like a 14-year old Beck. He begun his routine by turning
his head to the side and imitating the PBS symbol. Simple
but effective. His slow-talking one-liner type of delivery
recalled comic legend Steven Wright and brought down

the house at The Edge.
Malone also talked about the challenges of being straight and
living in the Castro, and he explained that while homeless veterans
may have fought in Vietnam, he grew up in the 80s, and so he's got
his own problems. He finished his routine by reading from his cat's
diary. Scott Malone showed he was in control of the crowd and
clearly stands a good chance of doing well in this competition.
Mimi Gonzalez, one of the only two women who competed
'ITiursday, earned herself a controversial fourth-place ticket to the
semi-finals with her candid sexual humor that focused on her own
bisexuality. She said she didn't like hearing "You're such a strong
woman" from men, because that meant she would have to be on
top all night. She then instructed women how to respond to street
harrassers in ways that would make the harraser feel stupid. Al
though her confidence on stage was clear, her material seemed
familiar and drew fewer laughs than the other comics.
The final qualifying spot for the next round was fifth place,
and it went to Bobby Tessel, who also used the one-liner tech
nique, perhaps even more effectively than Scott Malone. A cou
ple samplers to tell your friends: "Ever wonder what happens
when you swallow the mouthwash? I know, but I'm not telling,"
and "Do you remember that scene in Goldfinger where he has

sex with the girl
and then comes
kick from the bath
room, and she's dead
and painted in gold?
That's happened to me
twice." While several comics
ran all over the Mage, Icssel chose
to stand completely still with his
thumbs in his front pockets.
Almost all of the comics were enter
taining, and each had unique quirks about
their performances. Another competitor worth
mentioning here is I )anny Vermont (his real last
nameisPevido.but lie's used that joke too many
times). Vermont was one of the most enthusias
tic comics, and he performed early, earning the
most laughs during the first part ot the compeli
tion. 1 got a chance to talk to him alter his perfor
mauce, and I found out that in his spare time he
writes for "Politically Incorrect (with Hill
M.iher)," I le also told me that lie majored in re
verse psychology at Ithaca C "ollege, never going to
class hut always getting As.
When it came time lor the final scoring, I was
ready to go home. Perhaps a few less comics for
one evening would have been a good idea. Hut
notwithstanding this, the three judges graded
each comic in seven categories: stage presence,
technique, delivery, audience rapport, audience
response, material and judge's personal impres
sion. The five winners that emerged from this
group of IK people will proceed to the semi finals, which
will be held during the first week of( )ctober. The finals will
be held from Oct. 9to Oct. 12, in varying locations with the
final evening at the Maritime 11.ill in San I'ranciscoC )ct. 12.
So ifbuyingbooks is getting you down or the Secret Ser

vice is making you feel too serious, bring a friend to the*
competition where you can laugh out loud and judge these young
stand ups for yourself.
