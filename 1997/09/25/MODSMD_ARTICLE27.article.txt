Rodin
You've seen him many times. I le's always sitting there in that one
spot. The same damn spot day after day. I le always seems to have an
unhealthy greenish hue. With his chin on his list and his elbow on Ins
knee, he frowns, contemplates and. .. thinks. Yes, he's... "The
Thinker." The god of acadcmia sits on a pedestal in front of Meyer l.i
brary, forever caught up in his reasoning and frozen in a single train
of thought that gives him his particular posture.
A more appropriate place does not exist for Ins meditation. I le is
the guardian of Meyer; a place where many eyes have closed in frus
tration or exhaustion while contemplating the book or computer
screen before them; where many chins have employed a hand as a
temporary resting place, while the mind goes into overdrive.
Perhaps "The Thinker" warns us of the effects of thinking too
hard. While his mental state stays dynamic, his physical presence re
mains static. Perhaps it is a case of "If you keep on making your face
like that, it's going to stay that way."
Didn't your mother ever warn you?
"The Thinker" didn't have a mother. He only had a father, the
French sculptor, Auguste Rodin (1840-1917). Rodin described "The
Thinker" 's activity: "Fertile thought slowly elaborates itself within
his brain. 1 le is no longer dreamer, he is creator."
That must also happen in the minds of those studying in Meyer.
"The Thinker" may not have had traditional parental influences,
but he was not left without brothers and sisters. The Farm displays
authentic casts of some of Rodin's finest work in a sculpture garden
devoted to the artist, as well as at a couple of other sites on campus.
During orientation of your freshman year you may have seen the
B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden established outside the
Stanford Museum of Art.
My initiation into Stanford coincided with my introduction to

that garden. 1 will never forget standing in front of "The (iates of
I lell" with my new dorm mates and having a heck of a time trying to
learn all of their names hy playing some game the RAsthought would
help us. It was at night, and the sparse garden lighting made the gates
all the more frightening.
It that or something similar was your llrst experience, the garden
deserves a second look, or first look it that's not the case. You li.ul het
ter take that look soon, because it will he closing down and will re
main closed until spring due to the construction on the Museum ol
Art. Kven though the noisy construction currently underway docs
not make for ideal conditions in which to appreciate the garden, it is
worth the discomfort.
Ideally, you should make two tl ips: one during the day when the
sun is high, and one during the night when the lights planted at the
bases of the sculptures cast eerie shadows and allow the pieces to take
on entirely different characters.
Actually, the garden was designed in such a way that during the
day, a maximum amount ol sunlight will tall on the si ulptures. I >ur
ing the day you can see how light makes Rodin's "Martyr" glisten,
emphasizing every curve and indentation ol the suffering woman's
body.
The sunlight also beats down on the "burgher ol ( ala is who
bows his head and covers it with his hands in anguish. (let up ilose,
and you notice that the light just barely illuminates the contours ol
his face contorted in pain.
At some point during your exploration ol the garden, you come
to Rodin's ultimate monument to human suffering, "The Ciates ol
Hell." Adam and Kve stand on either side of the doors while "The
Thinker" ponders the human condition at the top.
I he next stop on your tour of rediscovery might be the entrance
of the Quad, otherwise known as "Memorial ( ourt," 111 which four
Burghers ol Calais stand. Rodin created the burgher sculptures in
IHX9 to memorialize 14th century citizens of Calais who offered
themselves to the King ol l.ngland in order to end the siege on their
city. Today, they also memorialize Stanford men who died for their
country. Another burgher ol (Calais, "Kustache de St. l'ierre," can In
seen standing in torment next to the I listory < orner.
