# Campus Sculpture Walks
## 
### 
Other sculpture throughout the campus
Rodin's artistic genius is not the sole talent (ogive
our campus artistic flavor. Works by a variety of
other artists grace our grassy knolls.
On the west side ol the Quad, George Segal's
"(lay Liberation" is on display. The sculpture con
sists ol four white washed bronze figures: two
women sitting on a bench and two men standing.
One woman's hand rests delicately on the second
woman's thigh while the second's hand just touches
the first woman's hand. The two men stand close to
gether with one man's hand on the other's shoulder.
I he relationships between these solemn figures are
established very clearly and with the utmost respect.
Only about 50 yards away stands an unusual wall
in the middle of an octagonal patch ol grass. Known
.is "The Stanford Wall," this is the work of |osef Al
bers who, according to |oe Norman, a junior who
served as Sculpture ( onservationist on campus last
year, was not known as a sculptor. Albers was an aca
demic whose areas of expertise included the theory
ol color. I lowever, the wall displays a unique artistic
understanding of geometric shapes and lines.

In addition to "The Thinker," several other
pieces occupy the areas around Meyer library.
You've probably seen them so many times that you
don't even think about them anymore.
One of these is "Column I," created out of
stainless steel in 1983-84 by James Kosati. It is a
monumental pillar, the size of which cannot be ex
perienced fully unless you stand at its base. It was
later dedicated to the "memory of Albert Risen,
1927-95, Professor of Art History" who was
"teacher, scholar and guiding spirit of Stanford's
outdoor art collection." Hlsen was instrumental in
having the Rodin Sculpture Garden installed and
was an acknowledged expert on Rodin.
From "Column I," il you walk a closer to
Meyer, you will come across "Luna Moth Walk I,"
the newest edition to the outdoor collection. It has
an interesting name, but lack of a more appropri
ate description forces me to reiterate the phrase
that another student used to describe it: "it's that
origami thing." Luna may be new, but it's com
pletely covered with rust for... effect, I guess.
Walk a little way further, and you run into
"Mozart I," a striking web work of wires and tubes.

According to Norman, the artist, Kenneth Snelson,
constructed this piece in such a way that if some
nimrod decided to climb it, it would be able to
stand up to the abuse despite its fragile appearance.
Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden
One of the most unusual yet inconspicuous
parts of the outdoor art collection is the Papua
New Guinea Sculpture Garden. The garden holds
an ensemble of wood sculptures, stone works and
painted poles scattered between tall trees in front of
Roble Hall.
This is definitely a part of Stanford's sculpture
collection that benefits from Galifornia sunshine,
unless you enjoy being scared by the figures, which
become positively lurid in moonlight.
All of the pieces were created in the Sepik River
Region of Papua New Guinea by master carvers of
that area. Jim Mason, who received a Masters in
Anthropology at Stanford in 1993, raised the funds
and oversaw the project. The artists collaborated
with American and Papua New Guinea landscape
architects, which is made evident in the manner in

which mounds of earth covered with exotic plants
and ferns serve as gentle dividers for the different
parts of the garden.
Highlights of the exhibit include "Kara," creat
ed by Simon Ganbuto Marmos and Jo Mare
Wakundi. "Kara" is a totemic wooden pole carved
in the shape of a woman with a magnificent bird
perched onher head with wings out-stretched.
The human-animal relationship motif appears
in a majority of the work. One interesting devia
tion is a large pumice stone sculpture of writhing
figures thatis in fact a take on "The Gates of Hell."
The artists related the subject of Rodin's master
piece to a "flood that destroys the ancestral word
after a man tricks his older brother into killing his
wife." It is a nice example of art free of cultural
boundaries.
The Stanford campus is a wonderful place to
display and enjoy outdoor art. You'll find monu
ments to things past, present and future, Ameri
can and foreign. Experience the outdoor art col
lection for a second time, and you'll appreciate it
twice as much.

Meet at the Main Quad entrance,
facing the Oval
First Sunday of each month at 2p.m.

Rumor has it that this scary gator has already eaten three Roble freshman.

Snelson's "Mozart I" by Meyer Library is stronger than it looks.
