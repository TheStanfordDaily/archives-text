# Interview with Lee Tamahori, director of "The Edge"
## 
### Frederick Vallaeys 
011 my way to Lee Tamahori at his hotel in San Francisco, I
discover that my tape-recorder is broken. Luckily I'm able
to buy a now one at Union Square right before the inter
view, but when the interview starts, I can't get the recorder to work.
Tamahori grabs it out of my hands and starts fiddling with it, and
being the man who has just finished directing a great movie, "The
Edge," he fixes the recorder in no time. "What is your first ques
tion," Tamahori asked holding the microphone to my face.
Intermission: Did you have to deal with equipment failing in
the mountains?
Tamahori: No we didn't because all our equipment was...
Intermission: Better than my recorder?
Tamahori: No, we just take it in there knowing that we'll run
into problems, so we make sure that we got stuff to replace it
with. The camera equipment is notorious in cold weather, but
the equipment that we were dealing with has so much security
thrown at it, like cold-resistant batteries and heated eye-pieces
that it performed admirably well. The Canadian crew actually
loves dealing with these cold-weather filming situations. They
live to make movies like this.
Intermission: OK, so you had no troubles with your equip
ment, but during the filming, Anthony Hopkins came down
with some serious back problems.
Tamahori: Yeah, he inherited a back problem from his work in
"Nixon." It was the curse of Nixon that put him in severe pain
halfway through the shoot before he fixed it up. I'm really glad
he did because he was in agony, and I could see it affect his per
formance.
Intermission: What would have happened if his problem didn't
get fixed?
Tamahori: We would have had to shut the film down. There
was no doubt we were getting to a point that Tony was in an in
tolerable pain, and he could only do one take of each scene.
That situation, out in the wilderness, left me with inferior ma
terial which is very dangerous because it'll let Tony down; it'll
let the film down; and it'll let me down. And I couldn't just say:
"Tony, you gotta do it again!" because he was just physically in
capable of that. I knew that something had to be done, and for
tunately Tony took it upon himself. During a long weekend, he
went into the hospital on a pre-arranged date for a six-hour
surgery. This was a pretty serious surgery, but wow, he came
back to us a new man. We lost only about two or three days dur

ing which we were all sweating, as money was just hemorrhag
ing. But it was worth every penny to get him back in a better
condition.
Intermission: Both Alec Balwin and Anthony Hopkins were
portraying different characters from what they usually play....
Tamahori: Well, Alec was probably closer to what we've seen
him play in the past, even though he was much more refined.
But Tony is playing like you've never seen him before. He's just
playing a version of himself. He really liked this (role) because it
was a wonderfully perverse thing to do. Actors don't usually play
themselves, so at the same time it was wonderfully lazy as well as
very brave. Even though he just kept on being Anthony Hop
kins, I thought that it was a very difficult role and many other ac
tors were concerned about this as well because the character of
Morse is so withdrawn, reserved and alienated from real life...
an oddball really. An oddball who becomes a man, an interest
ing character.
Intermission: Did you pick the actors yourself?
Tamahori: I picked Alec, FJle [MacPherson], LQ [Jones], and
Harry [Perrineau], but Tony came along much later when we
were hunting for the lead role. Many actors had come and gone
over a six-month period, and then Tony came to us late in the
piece. We'd never even thought about him because we weren't
thinking British, and we weren't thinking in Tony's age range.
We wanted Morse to be somewhere in Alec's age range, more in
his forties. But actually when Tony came along it made it better...
the older the guy was, the more the paranoia about his trophy
wife increased, and it made it all more sensible somehow. You're
actually dealing with a man not quite at the end of his life, but
beyond his mid-life crisis. While he thinks that his life has passed
him by, he is about to have his most searing experience while he
is in his late fifties. The dynamic is somehow increased, so we
said "to hell" with having an American character. It'll just be
Tony being an oddball British billionaire.
Intermission: So was Tony really playing himself?
Tamahori: Well ye.'.h, the only difference is that Tony has mil
lions rather than billions (laughs).
Intermission: Would you prefer to make millions or be critical
ly acclaimed?
Tamahori (modestly): It doesn't really matter to me, I know
that we've got some good performances, a good story and a good
film. Knowing what great films are, and not being pretentious, I
wouldn't say that it's a great film, but 1 just think that it's good,

solid entertainment with some intelligent things going on with
in this genre. But, yes I'd like the film to make a lot of money be
cause that will get me another job, and it also increases the
chances that films like this one will get made again.
Intermission: How many of the bear-attack scenes and other
stunts made use ofstuntmen?
Tamahori: Well, I tried to make the actors do as much as possible.
I was making the actors do all their own stunts and that's when
you find out what they can't do. From there we worked back
wards, trying to do as much as possible with the real actors until
we were forced to use a stunt-double. There was a ton of prepara
tion that went into the scenes with the bear, and then we literally
spent a month shooting those scenes. This really drove Tony to
frustration because the action genre can be quite boring. You
spend four hours setting up the cast down there and then in a few
seconds it's all over and then you have the actors coming out of
their trailer to yell "Look out!," and that's it, that's their day's work.
Intermission: You really insist on driving your actors to their
limits, like when you had Elle pose in a loincloth in three degrees
below zero temperatures.
Tamahori: I like pushing actors to the edge.
Intermission: Would you do this stuff yourself?
Tamahori (very firmly): Of course not. Nobody's gonna do
that. Or else they can pay me the big bucks they pay Alec and
Tony. The stuntmen test the limits like when they jump into the
freezing lake to tell me how long someone can last in there. If it's
determined to be safe, then we'll do it.
Intermission: What was the toughest part about making this
film?
Tamahori: Making the bear attacks look real. I've never seen a
credible bear attack in my life in a movie, they all look pathetic.
People make the mistake of having an actor in what they call a
"maul" which is where the bear grabs the character and gives
him a bear hug while standing up. Well, I'm sorry but that's not
what bears do. It's absolute nonsense, it's just something that
movies made up, just like Western characters with their Stetsons
turned up on the sides. Anyway, when a character gets in a maul
they should be dead, and yet i n every other movie they somehow
manage to slip out of the bear's grip. So there is no credibility
there. I decided to film about what bears do best, which is attack
on all fours, viciously, brutally and fast.
Intermission: Have you ever been attacked by a wild animal?
Tamahori: No, never. I n New Zealand, we don't have any preda
tors besides humans. I was kind of naive about it and that was a
good thing probably, because I went further than someone else
might have gone. So I wondered why no one else had ever filmed
realistic bear attacks before, and then I found out that it was be
cause it's hard, so I said "we'll do it."
Intermission: And you did.
"The Edge" is truly a unique film that is exciting even though it has
none of the hallmark characteristics of Hollywood's summer block
busters. Tamahori s film requires a little bit of thinking, but that
shouldn't hurt now that we're back to studying.

determined to be safe, then we'll do it.
Intermission: What was the toughest part about making this
film?
Tamahori: Making the bear attacks look real. I've never seen a
credible bear attack in my life in a movie, they all look pathetic.
People make the mistake of having an actor in what they call a
"maul" which is where the bear grabs the character and gives
him a bear hug while standing up. Well, I'm sorry but that's not
what bears do. It's absolute nonsense, it's just something that
movies made up, just like Western characters with their Stetsons
turned up on the sides. Anyway, when a character gets in a maul
they should be dead, and yet i n every other movie they somehow
manage to slip out of the bear's grip. So there is no credibility
there. I decided to film about what bears do best, which is attack
on all fours, viciously, brutally and fast.
Intermission: Have you ever been attacked by a wild animal?
Tamahori: No, never. I n New Zealand, we don't have any preda
tors besides humans. I was kind of naive about it and that was a
good thing probably, because I went further than someone else
might have gone. So I wondered why no one else had ever filmed
realistic bear attacks before, and then I found out that it was be
cause it's hard, so I said "we'll do it."
Intermission: And you did.
"The Edge" is truly a unique film that is exciting even though it has
none of the hallmark characteristics of Hollywood's summer block
busters. Tamahori s film requires a little bit of thinking, but that
shouldn't hurt now that we're back to studying.
