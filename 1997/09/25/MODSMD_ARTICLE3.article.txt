To help her students grasp the com
plexities of the human nervous system.
Assoc. Biology Prof. Susan McConnell

to demonstrate a neural tube.
Innovative approaches to biology such
as these as well as her devotion to Stan
ford undergraduate learning has earned
McConnell the prestigious Laurance and
Naomi Carpenter Hoagland Prize.
The Hoagland Prize for excellence in
undergrat'iate teaching, which includes a
$7.(KM) stipend, was established ll years
ago as a means of recognizing outstand
ing professors at Stanford. Members of
last year's sophomore class submitted
nominations for the award.
The final selection was made by the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven in consultation with the other
deans and department chairs. Shoven's
presentation of the prize took place yes

terday at Junior Convocation in Memori
al Church.
In his presentation Shoven stated that
"over the years a stellar group of faculty
has been awarded the Hoagland Prize."
He noted that the "awards and prizes sig
nal the importance we place on teach
ing."
McConnell came to Stanford as a post
doctoral fellow in neurobiology at the
Medical School and joined the Stanford
faculty in 19K9. McConnell teaches Biol
ogy 32 in the biology core, an advanced
undergraduate course on developmental
neurobiology and a graduate class on
neural development. Her lectures in the
biology cor: as well as her mentoring of
students have earned her praise among
faculty and students alike.
One student in McConnell's biology
core class commented in that "while this
may seem rather bold, from my perspec
tive as a student, her teaching defines a
standard that others at Stanford might
well aspire to meet."

Another student praised her ability to
create an environment "where new and
innovative ideas are being bounced
around: no question is too ridiculous to
ask, even from a naive undergraduate."
McConnell's colleagues echoed the
comments of students. "Susan sets a stan
dard of teaching excellence (in the biology
core] that no one in the department can
match," said a tellow biology professor.
Receiving the award McConnell ap
peared overjoyed and said the Hoagland
Prize brought tears to her eyes. "It's real
ly wonderful to have this sense of appre
ciation from students," she acknowl
edged.
McC onnell ison sabbatical this year and
will probably not return to teaching in biol
ogy core for at least a few years. She says
she would like to focus on teaching smaller
undergraduate courses where students can
formulate and test hypotheses.
A gallery of photos and citations of
past Hoagland pri/e winners is on display
in the first floor of Sweet Hall.
