## Sweet 75—Sweet 75 
### 
1 \ Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic lias re
lumed to the music scene, but don't hope lor
Virvtimi: Return to Pop Culture. The member of
the nitish Seattle group has returned with a
sweeter sounding, more upbeat hand called
Sweet 75. In their self-titled, debut album, the
wle is rhythmical in a Smashing I'umpkins
vts softcned-by-the-10,000 Maniacs way.
I his makes sense, considering the fact that
sweet 7? is produced by Paul fox and I d 'I'hack
of Maniacs' fame.)
I he band consists of Venezuelan horn Yva
as Vegas on bass, guitar and vocals, with hob
k I .uric on drums and Novoselic on bass and
.iitar. 1 heir name is taken from the poet
■n'odore Roethke, who was once paid 573 for a
i Hin that he submitted to a magazine. In a later
■iter to the same magazine, he thanked them
for the "Sweet 75."
<. )n vocals, Yva Las Vegas brings a I atin rock
i isit \ in her songs. Her musical obi lit \ was
I discovered" by Novoselic when she sang
,1 ■ e folk songs at his birthday party. I lei
.a throbs with passion and lervor that are
nisient ol American disco tunes. In '()de
|)oll\ its easy to believe the woman when
roons "I want to be a countrv singei 1
to do it all night long / I want to hang with
I )oll\ I'arton."
\ real factof this album is that notwo songs
.ilike: each seems to have a lite and a person -
\ ol its own. A samplingol the titles alone l i -
the varying themes: "bite ol Mv Hand,"
\ id.i and "Oral Health." The songs com
ment each other so that the switch from one
i the other is hardly apparent. Instead, you
uduallv become aware that the beat and
nvtluns have moved on to another set ol
sounds.
I his can be a downer il you're looking lor an
intense musical epiphany where each song
rabs vour attention. But il you want good, solid
nisic, Sweet 75 could be an album worth
king out. It seeps in and out ol your focus,
iiist enough so that you catch lyrics like "I veil
II ie monkeys fall from the trees/I'm always
watching /so they don't fall on me in lapan
I rees." Another gem is"( antosde Pilon," which
is a l as Vegas lounge number sung in Spanish.
I he trio's different backgrounds also pulsate
in the album: Yva was a street musician in (.ali
fornia and Washington, Lurie played in New
York, and Krist played with that group called

Nirvana. Their range, experiences, styles and
talents form one crisp, cool debut album called
Sweet 75 that's inst catchy enough to play the
whole way through (The last time I said this

about .111 allium was in 1993, about Dave
Matthew's "Under the lable and I breaming").
In a recent interview, Yva said that she want
ed to "write music that moves people, that it

gives I hem chicken skin.' She's t.ilking iihont
H( «)se humps, .mil when Sweet / i steals your .it
tention, her sweet voice iloes just thill.
