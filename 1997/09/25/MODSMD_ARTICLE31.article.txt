# Space — Spiders
## 
### 
One of the cornerstones ot rock and roll is
rhythm. I roni the smoky rumble ot Ho 1 )iddley
to the aggressive swing ol the Stones to the ik In
pulse ot Big Audio Dynamite, rhythm is even
capable ot overshadowing melody and lyrics as
a song's most important element.
"Spiders," a new album from the group
Space, is ,i great example of how a good sense of
rhythm can rescue an otherwise lacking effort.
The groups creates an addictive, propulsive
sound, covering up even the most vapid lyrics.
Obviously owing a great debt to hybrid
bands like Big Audio 1 )ynamite, Space is a hap

hazard mix of hip-hop, reggae and techno
music. The band's sound, naturally, is «.|ii itc
eclectic, but unfortunately its lyrical sense is
painfully deficient.
The lead singer tries to mix the menace of
reggae with the impact of rap, which becomes a
good idea done poorly. The singing is stupid
and annoying and may he an attempt to draw
attention away from the horrific lyric s.
On "No-one understands," (which should
be outlawed as a song title) for example, we are
told that "If I wanted to be someone / think I
would be / Margaret Thatcher / She's so cool I
think she should / be c|ueen / Now it you
should agree with this/ Then I think you I
should be / Hung and drawn and quartered I

And then thrown into the sea / And then you il
never get out / Because you tan t swim.
Sophomoric doesn't even begin to describe
these lyrics.
Still, on tracks sikli .is Voodoo Roller the
lyrics actually work because they subordinate
themselves to the natural rhythm of the song.
Indeed, on the album s best songs, such .is
"Neighborhood' and "Mister Psycho, the
group's vision comes across perfectly, both are
aggressive, powerful songs, which could tunc
tion both as radio singles and dance tracks.
Space is capable of making great music. II
they could just sharpen their lyrics and shorten
their songs, people might even notice.
