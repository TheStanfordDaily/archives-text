## L.A. Confidential 
### 
With the recent wave of crime dramas,
it's surprising that one crime flick should
emerge with the right combination of plot,
violence, characterization and romantic ap
peal to keep audiences tantalized for two
hours straight. "L.A. Confidential," based
on James Ellroy's popular 19S0 novel, does
just that.
It's the classic tale of dark deeds in a sup
posed paradise. Ciuy Hudgeons (Danny I)e-
Vito), a sleazy tabloid writer, introduces the
mafia rings that lie under the Hollywood
glamour of the 1950s in his narrative.

Hudgcons gets
many of his sto
ries from
L.A.P.D. Sgt.

Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a narcotics
cop who tips off the media in return for
semi-celebrity status. Other members of
Los Angeles' finest include Bud White
(Russell Crowe), a violent character with a
troubled past, and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce),
the detective with a conscience who wants
to live up to his deceased father's name.
Problems arise for the three men when a
mass murder occurs at the Nite Owl Cafe.
All the evidence points to a trio of black
men, and the case is apparently closed. Hut
as Exley (and the audience) suspects, not all

is right in the City of Angels....
This movie does a great job of portraying
a period with the right blend of stereotypi
cal 50s noir and raw realism. It succeeds as
a "Chinatown" wannabe where movies like
"Mulholland Falls" draw short of the mark.
The acting is superb as well. Spacey, the
Oscar winner, is lovable as always as the coy
cop who's greedy enough to let Hudgeons
into his affairs, but smart enough to keep
himself out of trouble. Crowe, who was the
villain in the forgettable "Virtuosity," is fan
tastic as the tumultuous good cop / bad cop.
It's a treat to see "L.A. Confidential" be
cause it's one of those rare movies that has a
plot thick enough to have you working to
put the puzzle together. Be sure to stick
around for the end of the credits; there's a
cute finishing sequence,
