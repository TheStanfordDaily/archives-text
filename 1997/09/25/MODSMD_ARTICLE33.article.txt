# In & Out

### 
The new comedy "In & Out" is enjoyable,
hut it lacks the realism that warrants consid
ering it a great movie about "coming out."
After starring in a film about gay soldiers,
Brad Pitt rip-off Cameron (Matt Dillon) an
nounces 011 television that his former Eng
lish teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline),
is gay. This declaration might not have been
too unusual if it weren't for the fact that
Brackett plans on getting married in three
days to Emily (Joan Cusack).
The Brackett's town's quest to discover the
truth about his sexual orientation makes for
some funny situations. But if you've seen the
previews, there won't be any comic surprises

in the first half of the film.
The second half shows a vision of a perfect
world in which all people can live together in
peace, no matter what their race, religion or
in this case sexual orientation, happens to be.
Despite the possibility of cheesy cinema such
a situation creates, it works well here.
Kline's portrayal of a man who considers
himself to be straight but unable to suppress
his feminine side is very enjoyable. His more
serious struggle to discover his true self is also
nicely performed. It is not easy to be serious
and comical at the same time, but Kline pulls it
off.
The best performance of the movie, how

ever, is from Tom Selleck who plays Peter
Malloy, a gay tabloid TV reporter covering
the Brackett story. Selleck's "Magnum P. 1."
days are no where in sight, although he does
have an unforgettable kissing scene.
Some of the better jokes in this film ad
dresses the issue of super-skinny models.
Eating disorder poster-child Shalom Harlow,
who plays Cameron's girlfriend, serves as the
butt of the jokes. The subject of homosexu
als is treated in an upbeat manner, despite re
maining taboo in much of the country. For
this reason, coupled with a surprising plot
twist, "In & Out" is worth watching.
