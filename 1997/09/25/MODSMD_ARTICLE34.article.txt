# The
						Edge
## 
### 
The Edge" is an unusual action-adventure
film because it lacks the elements that we have
come to expect from the genre. While you
won't see any car chases, explosions, gun
fights or sex-scenes, David Mamets story is
so vividly rich that it will keep you on the edge
of your seat.
The story is suspenseful until the very end,
due to the tension between two men that dri
ves them apart while forcing them to rely on
each other for survival.
A billionaire bookworm in his fifties,
Charles Morris (Anthony Hopkins), and a
fashion photographer in his forties, Bob

Green (Alec Baldwin), are left stranded after
their plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness.
As they try to survive the attacks of a man
eating bear while attempting to make their
way back to the civilized world, matters be
come complicated when Morris blames
Green for stealing his trophy wife (Ella
Macpherson).
During their battle with nature, one of the
two men learns that the greatest threat is in
fact the dark side of man.
Morris and Green's fight with the bear is
outstanding. Director Lee Tamahori insisted
that his film depict bear-attacks in a realistic

fashion. Watching the life and death struggle
proves that Tamahori has succeeded. It's one
of the most exciting action sequences in films
this year.
Oscar-winner Hopkins demonstrates why
he's one of today's best actors. For the first
time, he is playing the role of an adventure
character. He changes from an intellectual
who has never really lived, into a man who
can survive nature's cruelty.
Balwin, on the other hand, plays his usual
rough-guy type. To his credit though, his
portrayal of Green has a lot more depth than
his usual characters.

Elle Macpherson also uses "The Edge" to
prove that not only is she a convincing ac
tress, she is brave as well. Not many actress
es could retain their composure while pos
ing semi-nude in freezing temperatures, as
she did on location in the Canadian Rock
ies.
When you combine a complex and sur
prising story with two great actors and a di
rector who will only settle for the best, all the
elements for a great film are there. "The
Edge" is thoroughly entertaining and well
worth seeing.
