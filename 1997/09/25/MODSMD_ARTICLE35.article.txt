## The 						Peacemaker 
### 
The Peacemaker," a tedious production starring George Clooney
and Nicole Kidman, is redeemed only by Clooney's charm and the
fine performance of Marcel lures as the vengeful terrorist. Produced
by I )ream Works SKG, a new studio founded by Steven Spielberg, Jef
frey Katzenberg and David Geffen, this talented group's company has
created an embarrassing first feature.
"The Peacemaker," an unthrilling thriller, centers around the hi
lacking of a Russian transport train and the theft of ten nuclear
weapons. The terrorists detonate one of the bombs as a strategic dis
traction and make off with the other nine. The rest o! the film con
cerns itself with the location of those bombs and the question of who
has them.
Throughout this movie, I was unconcerned about the terrorists
with the nukes. The movie lacks tension and fails to keep the audi
ence's attention. The early bomb-stealing sequence is great, but the
energy diminishes considerably with the introduction of Dr. Julia
Kelly (Nicole Kidman) and Lt. Tom Devoe (Clooney), the team as
signed to recover the weapons.
George Clooney is great as George Clooney— I actually believed
he was George Clooney playing a cocky military guy. Kidman is less
convincing as the nuclear expert. 1 think Dr. Kelly's primary claim to
being "very smart" is that she has brown hair and wears serious de
signer outfits.
The villain, portrayed by I )usan Gavrich (lures), presents the other
i. haracter problem. "The Peacemaker" continues a trend in which the
antagonist is supposed to be a bad-ass evil creep, but with deep feel
ings. 1 le bawls his manifesto at the audience, and suddenly we're sup
posed to sympathize with Mr. Nuclear Holocaust. This kind of ma
nipulative vamping takes credibility away from the heroes. "The
Peacemaker's" good guys are only tools in what has become the dull
mechanics of saving the world.
The movie's greatest flaw is that it's not genuine. The filmmakers
didn't believe in their own movie. Dream Works wanted a hit, so they
made a movie with explosions, car chases and snappy comebacks. In
the process they neglected creativity, quality or any kind of sincerity.
