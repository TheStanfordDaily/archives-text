In case you're not up on your British slang,
"The Full Monty" is when a male reveals his,
urn, crown jewels.
The film "The Full Monty," tells the story of
six unemployed men in a Yorkshire steel mill
town who try to become male strippers. By sub
tly mixing bawdy and intelligent humor, this
film charms the audience in true British fashion.
The unofficial leader of this stripper gang is
Gaz, nicely portrayed by Robert Carlyle
(" trainspotting") as a mischievous Peter Pan
type in need of cash. He's behind on his alimo
ny payments and worried that he's losing his son
Nathan's trust. When a popular male stripper
act comes to town and brings in the shillings, he
decides that is the way to go.
Gaz manages to get his buddy David to join
in the scheme and somehow Nathan also be
comes an accomplice — no, there's no kiddy
porn, he takes charge of the music. They hold
auditions and round-up four other hopeless
men.
Hilarious sequences follow in which the men
teach themselves to dance and attempt to ac

quire some erotic appeal. They are a miserable
bunch. Their routines resemble a "Barney &
Friends" video rather than Jennifer Beals's body
double in "Flashdance," whom they idolize.
In the midst ofall this gyrating and flaunting,
the men must overcome personal inhibitions as
well as society's judgment. Not only are they not
ideal Chippendale material, but they also have
disabling self-esteem issues. David has lost con
fidence in his testosterone and can't get intimate
with his wife on physical or verbal levels. (ierald,
laid off six months ago, still can't bring himself
to tell his wife.
While all of the resultant soul-searching does
warrant at least one "Full I louse" moment be
tween Gaz and his son, the levels of laughter are
maintained throughout.
Despite die potential for sap and the tempta
tion for disgustingly raunchy jokes, "The Full
Monty" proves itself to l>e one of those unusual
comedies that successfully addresses the issue of
fragile male egos as it puts a fresh perspective on
physical exploitation.
