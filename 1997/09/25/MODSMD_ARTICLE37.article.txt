Break out the kleenex, because the Oscar
race has just begun.
"A Thousand Acres," starring Michelle
Pfeifferand Jessica Lange, is the first of the tear
jerking movies th.it signals the end of the sum
mer blockbusters and the beginning of the fall
drama season of Oscar contenders. (iiven that,
it's nice to see that "A Thousand Acres" is wor
thy of at least a few of the nominations it is
bound to receive.
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning
novel by Jane Smiley, "A Thousand Acres"
tells the story of a farm in lowa and the fain
ily whose lifeblood it h.is been for three gen
erations. Jason Robards plays the third gen
eration lowa farmer and patriarch of the
Cook family. He's a man who is revered by
his community for his magnificent farm and
the fact that he raised his three girls himself
after the death of his wife. His two elder
daughters, Ginny (Lange) and Rose (Pfeif
fer), live in houses on the farm. The
youngest, Caroline (Jennifer Jason I.eigh), is
;i lawyer in Des Moines.

When the aging Cook can no longer !â€¢ ><>k
alter the (arm adequately, he dec ides to give i! to
Ins three daughters. This decision seis <ilt a
chain of events which rends the sisters and la
ther from each other. As their emotional battle
extends, it begins to affect everyone around
them.
"A Thousand Acres" is not above manipu
lating the heartstrings. I iowever, this is a solid
film which, despite its portrayal of the every
day, draws you in by revealing bow extraordi
nary the lives of average people i an be.
I be performances, especially those of I'feif
fer and Robards, are realistic, so much so that
you almost feel like you're engaging in
voyeurism. And unlike the usual fall dramas,
"A Thousand Acres" doesn't span enough gen
erations to be "epic," and it isn't grand enough
to be "sweeping." It is instead a quiet, sad.emo
tionally-engaging and evocative drama, which
relies on an excellent story and strong perfor
mances to become a movie th.it is genuinely
worth watching.
