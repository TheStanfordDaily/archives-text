Twenty-five years after its banish
ment, the Army Reserve Officer
('ruining Corps has returned to cam
pus this fall despite ongoing contro
versy.
Last year, students and faculty
members protested against bringing
R()'I C back to campus, disagreeing
with the military's policy of not
granting scholarships to openly de
clared homosexuals or disabled stu
dents. Stanford, on the other hand,
does not take sexual orientation or
disabilities into account when
awarding financial aid.
I t. Col. Robert Reed, who is or
ganizing Stanloid's ROT( program,
stresses that the Army's policy con
cerning homosexuality and disabili
ties is "something controlled by our
national political leaders. Stanford's
non discriminatory policy is very,
very important to us."
The Army ROTC will offer two
classes, "Basic Leadership Develop
ment'' and "Communicative Skills
and Organizational Leadership I'he
ory," which will be open to all stu
dents.
The classes are simply "here to
teach leadership skills," said Maj.
Richard (lon/ales, who will help de
sign and teach the courses.
Third-year law student David

Bradfute, an oppo
nent of Stanford's
KOTC program
said he is "very dis
appointed that
Stanford's admin
istration seems to
be going along with
the military and ig
noring its own dis
criminatory policy.'

The I Jniversity originally banned
ROTC m l l )73 when the ( acuity
Senate voted to force the military or
ganization off campus due to dis
agreements about bestowing faculty
status i)ii military officers and over
protests of the military's involve
ment in Vietnam.
Since then, Stanford students in
volved in Army, Navy and Air Force
R( )1C units have had to commute
to other universities. Numerous
Stanford students who are members
of ROTC have complained about
the situation.
Last January, Stanford Provost
Condoleezza Rice signed an agree
ment with Santa Clara University's
Army ROTC unit that stipulated
military science courses would ap
pear in the Stanford Bulletin. Che
I Jniversity also agreed to provide
classroom space on campus, consid
er transfer credit, and not interfere
