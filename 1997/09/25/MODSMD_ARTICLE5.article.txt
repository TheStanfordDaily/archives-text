## Newsweek journalist defends job in speech 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Hoover Media bellow Michael
Isikoli, an investigative journalist
tor Newsweek, spoke in defense of
his profession at the 1 loover Memo
rial liuilding yesterday evening.
At a seminar in Stauffer Audito
rium entitled "The Politics of Scan
dal in Washington," Isikolf related
his experiences as a journalist who
worked on several major stories in
Washington, including Whitewater,
the Iran Contra affair, and most re
cently, President Clinton's cam
paign finance problems. The talk
was the first of a year-long series at
the I loover Institution.
I le opened with figures detailing
the hefty cost of political scandals
for both taxpayers and private par
ties especially the millions of dol
lars involved in the high profile fias

col's he helped uncover.
"You might ask I low do I justify
my existence?' " he said.
!• ven Isikolf, a veteran corre
spondent .conceded that the scandal
industry has run amok. In some
ways "the politics of Washington is
scandal," Isikoli said. However, he
went on to maintain that "scandal
has always been a part of the politi
cal process and American history."
I le t< >ld the audience of about 35
that lus role was to provide informa
tion to the public. He cited White
water as a case that "was driven and
broken by the press, but ii did pro
vide important information."
According to Isikolf, everybody
looks for"the (iary Hart story a
single story that ended the career of
a politician," referring to the Sena
tor from ("olorado who left the I'ASH
Democratic Presidential race after
allegations of marital indiscretions
appeared in national media.
Isikoff said he believes, however,
that "this is the wrong way to look at
things."
In general, Isikoff said he cannot
determine a story's value. "I don't
know how important something is.
But is it something that voters
should know? I believe that they
should, and that is the press' role."
He cited the current campaign fi
nance reform movement as an ex
ample of the press doing its job. The
story involved illegal connections
between foreign businessmen and
President Clinton's campaign war
chest.
It began when reporters pursued
a tenacious check on the contribu
tors to the Democratic National
Committee's funds.
Isikoff, currently working on the
campaign finance reform story, has
been inside the Beltway for much of
his career. Before he came to
Newsweek in 1994, he worked at the
Washington Post and the Washing
ton Star.
He has earned several honors, in
cluding being a Pulitzer Prize final
ist. In addition, he has appeared as a
guest on National Public Radio,
Nightline and most recently,
MSNBC.
