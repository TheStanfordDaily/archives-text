HB 158-Epidemics, Evolution, and Ethics
"Evolutionary and historical perspectives on the genetic, environmental, and cultural factors in
volved in the susceptibility and spread of infectious disease.
"Ethical and social issues of disease and prevention and control including selective genetic scre
ening environmental interventions, and quarantine.
Baruch S. Bluniberg, M.D., Ph.D., Visiting Professor in Human Biology, received the Nobel Pri/e in Medi
cine or Physiology in 1976 for discoveries concerning the origin and spread ol infectious diseases. I lis pin
neering work in genetic polymorphisms led to the isolation of the I lepatitis 15 virus and to the subsequent
development of an effective vaccine.
William B. Hurl but, M.D., teaches biomedical ethics in the Program in I luman Biology. I lis i ourses in
elude the year-long Bioethical Issue* in Hitman Biolog i/, Admit 2000: Images of I lunimi Life in the Age of l>io
medical Technology, and Ethical Issues in the Neurosi iences.
Discussion-based seminar course, 4 units. Enrollment limited to 25 Human Biology students.
