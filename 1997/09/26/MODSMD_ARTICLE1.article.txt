# Sand Hill campaign beefed up
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Stanford University has spent $131,(XX) in the last two
months in preparation for the Nov. 4 referendum on the
expansion of Sand Hill Road, according to mandatory
campaign disclosure statements.
The University has outspent its opposition by a factor
of two to one. That opposition — the "Yes on Measure
M" committee — announced it has spent $66,158 in the
last two months and $81,527 since January.
Stanford's Office of Government and Community
Relations, essentially campaign headquarters for the
next 40 days, missed yesterday's 5 p.m. deadline but
mailed in its disclosure late last night from the San Fran
cisco International Airport.
Supported by the Palo Alto City Council, the Uni
versity hopes to expand Sand Hill and Quarry Roads to
four lanes, connect them both to El Camino Real, build
senior citizen and faculty / staff housing alongside Sand
Hill Road and expand the Stanford Shopping Center.
Voters will consider two separate plans for Sand Hill
Road expansion. The first. Measure M, was placed on
the ballot by petition and seeks to restrict the City of
Palo Alto and the University in their attempt to expand
Sand Hill Road. The second, Measure O, details the
University's plan and was placed unanimously on the
ballot by the Palo Alto City Council.
