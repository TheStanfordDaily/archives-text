# Sand Hill campaign beefed up
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Stanford University has spent $131,(XX) in the last two
months in preparation for the Nov. 4 referendum on the
expansion of Sand Hill Road, according to mandatory
campaign disclosure statements.
The University has outspent its opposition by a factor
of two to one. That opposition — the "Yes on Measure
M" committee — announced it has spent $66,158 in the
last two months and $81,527 since January.
Stanford's Office of Government and Community
Relations, essentially campaign headquarters for the
next 40 days, missed yesterday's 5 p.m. deadline but
mailed in its disclosure late last night from the San Fran
cisco International Airport.
Supported by the Palo Alto City Council, the Uni
versity hopes to expand Sand Hill and Quarry Roads to
four lanes, connect them both to El Camino Real, build
senior citizen and faculty / staff housing alongside Sand
Hill Road and expand the Stanford Shopping Center.
Voters will consider two separate plans for Sand Hill
Road expansion. The first. Measure M, was placed on
the ballot by petition and seeks to restrict the City of
Palo Alto and the University in their attempt to expand
Sand Hill Road. The second, Measure O, details the
University's plan and was placed unanimously on the
ballot by the Palo Alto City Council.
The University's plan will suc
ceed only if Measure O receives
both a simple majority and more
total votes than Measure M.
Stanford administrators are wor
ried voters will be confused by the
complexity of the two separate pro

posals.
"We must correct assertions
about Measure O and Measure M
that we do not believe are accuiate,"
said Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations.
"Our efforts are targeted at public
education."
This is the University's greatest
involvement in a political campaign
in its history, said Horton, who has

the number of days until the election
posted on his office door.
Should Measure M succeed, the
University "will not build the Sand
Hill Road extension to til ( amino
Real that is called for in Measure
M," lloiton said in a statement last
week. I lie plan calls lor three lanes,
with the middle lane designated
solely for public transportation or
ambulance use.

The "Yes on Measure M" cam
paign also announced that it has re
ceived $74,(XX) in donations and a
$15,(KM) loan from a Palo Alto resi
dent. Stanford is funding its entire
campaign only with University re
sources.
"A lot of people gave $49 because
they didn't want Stanford to know
who they were," said Peter Drek
meier, campaign director for "Yes

on Measure M." Both sides had to
disclose the sources of any donations
$.S() or greater.
Stanford spent the largest portion
of the money — $S(),(KX) — hiring
Public Affairs Associates, a consult
ing firm.
The University already has spent
more than $5 million over the last
five years in the preparation of re
ports analyzing the effects of the

Measure C) plan. If Measure () be
comes law, Morton said the Univer
sity will spend $20 million widening
Sand Hill Road to four lanes.
Revenue will be generated
through rent from the additional
Stanford Shopping Center space
and the new housing if Stanford is
victorious.
"It doesn't come out of tuition
dollars " I lorton said.
