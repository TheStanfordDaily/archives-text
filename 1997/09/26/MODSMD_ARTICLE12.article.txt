## NASA sends astronaut 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL., Fla. (AP) — With just hours
to go before liftoff. NASA gave the go-ahead yesterday
to put another American aboard the ramshackle Mir
space station despite pressure to back out before some
one gets killed.
Space shuttle Atlantis was scheduled to leave as
planned on a night flight with astronaut David Wolf.
NASA Administrator Daniel Cioldin insisted Ins
decision was not based on emotion or politics, but
rather science. I le relied on two concurring, last-minute
safety reviews conducted by outside experts.
"In light of the increased scrutiny and heightened
emotion, I can assure you: I his intensely rigorous inter
nal and external review of the shuttle Mir analyzed
thoroughly risk, readiness and, foremost, safety,"
Cioldin said.
In recent eeks, NASA had come under increasing
pressure from members til Congress and others not to
put another American aboard. Hut U.S. and Russian
space officials had warned that if the I Inited States
[Hilled out, it would be an insult to Moscow that could
jeopardize the project to build an international space
station.
Wolf didn't learn for certain until late Wednesday
that he would be Hying to Mir for a full, four-month
stay. Earlier, he had given (ioldin "a resounding yes"
when asked if NASA should press ahead.
"It's going to be a fun mission. It's going to be great,"
shuttle Mir program inanagei Frank ( ulbertson quoted
the 41-year old, never-married Wolf as saying.
During its 10 day flight, the shuttle will bring back
Michael Foale, the fifth American to live on Mir. 1 oak
has spent 4 1/2 months aboard the space station. In addi

lion, Atlantis and its crew of seven will deliver a new
computer along with other repair gear and urgently
needed supplies.
Gen. Yuri Glazkov, deputy commander of the cos
monaut training center near Moscow, insisted that he
would never send anyone to Mir and "expose him to
danger."
"Some people of the media s;iv it's Russian roulette,
something like that. It's not roulette," Gla/kov said.
"It's Russian ability to assess the situation. It's Russian
courage and self-assurance."
Goldin said there are always risks in spaceflight, and
NASA officials are "deeply touched" hy the public
interest in the flight and fears for the Mir astronauts'
well-being.
Hut "the decision to continue our joint participation
aboard Mir should not be based on emotion or politics,"
he said. "It should not be based on fear. A decision
should be based and is based on scientific and
technical assessment of the mission safety and the agen
cy's ability to gain add experience and knowledge that
cannot be gained elsewhere."
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, chairman of the
I louse Science Committee, which opposes sending
more Americans to Mir, said he does not believe C ioldin
was unswayed by U.S. Russian relations. What's more,
he said he hopes the safety evaluations are "not a
NASA whitewash of the many significant safety nsks
aboard Mir."
"We have learned from the ( hallenger accident that
ignoring safety warnings can lead to tragedy and a set
back of space exploration for years," the congressman
said.
