# Whitewater blues for Clinton
## Special prosecutor Starr subpoenas more documents 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed
records of President Clinton, the first lady
and top White I louse aides about possible
contacts with investigation witnesses,
lawyers familiar with the matter said yes
terday.
And in another sign of activity by Starr,
a new Whitewater grand jury began work
in Washington.
The subpoenas were issued recently by
a grand jury in Little Rock, Ark., seeking
evidence whether presidential aides or
friends have obstructed the investigation.
Prosecutors want information about
possible contacts with former Whitewater
business partners James and Susan
McDougal or disgraced Justice Depart

ment official Webster Hubbell, or their
lawyers, said attorneys familiar with the
new round of subpoenas.
In addition to the president and Mrs.
Clinton, the subpoenas demand docu
ments from some of the first family's clos
est advisers, including White House chief
of staff Erskine Bowles, adviser Mack
Mel.arty and Hillary Rodham Clinton's
former chief of staff, Margaret Williams,
the lawyers said.
The two subpoenas demand documents
from a list of about 50 White House peo
ple — "mainly White 1 louse lawyers but
it's a range of players" — according to one
Washington attorney familiar with the lat
est phase of Starr's investigation. He
spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Portions of the subpoenas focus on the
period between I eb. 12 and September of
last year a tumultuous time during the
investigation shortly after Mrs. Clinton
testified before a grand |iiry to explain the
mysterious discovery of her long sought
law firm billing records inside the White
I louse.
During that time the president provid
ed videotaped testimony to prosecutors
for a trial at which the Clintons' Whitewa
ter business partners were convicted.
James McDougal also turned on the
C lintons after his conviction and agreed to
be a cooperating prosecution witness
Susan McDougal refused to do so. She
went to jail last Sept. 9 rather than answer
questions from prosecutors.
