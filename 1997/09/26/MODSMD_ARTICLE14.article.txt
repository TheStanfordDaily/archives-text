Albert pleads guilty to assault
RI( I IM( )NI), Va. (Al') Marv Albert's attorney said the sportscastcr didn't want to
plead guilty to assault charges yesterday, but Ins case was gutted by laws that allow sur
prise witnesses and bar dirt from the accuser's past.
"Unfortunately under the rules in Virginia, much of our evidence was not allowed,"
Roy Black said. "I think if all our evidence had been allowed, we would not be in this posi
tion light now "
But legal experts said there is nothing unusual about Virginia's legal system.
So-called "rape shield laws," which limit evidence about the prior behavior of victims
of sexual crimes, are almost universal. I hey also said Virginia is not alone in allowing
attorneys call surprise witnesses.
" That's very standard evidence law," said 1 ail Dudley, who teaches law at the llni
versity of Virginia. "It just doesn't sound to me like any ol the judge's rulings are unusu
al at all."
Circuit Judge Benjamin N.A. Kendrick blocked almost all of the damaging evidenci
Black had against the woman who accused Albert of viciously biting her and forcing he
to perform oral sex in a hotel room leb. 12.
Black said Keiulrick's rulings excluded "approximately K.S to ( K) percent" ol his ease
including claims that the woman had a pattern of threatening past boyfriends.
