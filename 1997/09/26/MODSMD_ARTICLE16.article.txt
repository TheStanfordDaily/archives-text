## Editorial Inconsistency? Targeting fraternities 
### 
THE DELTA KAPPA EPSILON
fraternity was evicted from its house
at 592 Mayfield at the end of last
year for an incident involving an intoxicat
ed, underage pledge who was subsequently
taken to the hospital. This event marked the
culmination of a tumultuous year between
the Greeks and the University, in which the
University consistently denied cracking
down on fraternities while behaving in pre
cisely the opposite manner.
Although much of the aftermath of the
eviction took place over the duration of the
summer, effects on the Dekes and the rest of
the student population remain.
l or the Dekes, the inconveniences they
have faced have been many — they were
forced to enter the draw after the normal
draw process had already taken place and
were thus relegated to abysmal draw num
bers — many continue to search for housing
off campus.
Hut more importantly, Stanford students
must attempt to reconcile the apparent
intent and outcome of the University's
actions and come to terms with an adminis
tration that makes little attempt to reconcile
what it says with what it does.
In removing the Dekes from their hous
ing Dean of Students Marc Wais unilateral
ly decided to override the recommendation
of the Greek Judicial Board and evict the
fraternity from its house, in addition to
requiring them to attend alcohol abuse pro
grams and perform community service to
reclaim their house. The Greek Judicial
Board, which includes both students and
faculty, recommended that the Dekes be
placed on extended probation, pay a fine
and perform community service.

Although the actions of the University
have increasingly indicated a concerted
effort to crackdown on fraternities relative
to other groups, dorms and houses on cam
pus, the University continues to deny these
charges.
The Deke's eviction marked the second
fraternity in two years that had been forcibly
removed. The first was the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, which lost its housing due to
financial mismanagement.
"A lot of people think that the adminis
tration is out to get the Greeks, and that is
simply not true," Wais said to The Daily in
November of last year. "We have stated
directly in a variety of forms that we want to
strengthen Greek life on campus."
Wais' actions fail to support his state
ments.
Early last year he slapped heavy sanc
tions on the Sigma Chi fraternity for serving
minors at a party during Orientation —
police said that they entered the scene on an
anonymous tip. It was later revealed that
"anonymous tip" came from Fraternal
Affairs Advisor Heather Dunn.
In that instance, Wais again overruled
the recommendation of the Greek Judicial
Board and imposed stricter punishment.
Formulating punishment against the
advice of a board explicitly formed to
review such affairs should not be the man
ner in which decisions are made on this
campus.
Despite the protests of Wais to the con
trary, the University's actions indicate an
effort to remove fraternities from housing.
Its time that the administration behaves
in a manner that's consistent with its
expressed intent.
