Bikers inconsiderate on campus

It's tall quarter, and the inconsiderate
bicyclists are back on campus again. 1
was walking to work along Serra
Street a few mornings ago. At the corner
of (ialvez, a motorist, apparently lost and
possibly confused by the recent closing of
part of Serra. was proceeding slowly
through the intersection.
An incoming bicyclist sailed onto the
scene Displeased by the vehicle partially
blocking his path down the middle of the
street, he called out in annoyance, "Why
am I stopping?" (He was of course not
stopping at all, merely slowing down
slightly).
I rom the sidewalk. I replied, " There is
.1 stop sign, you know." As he passed
through around the vehicle, he shot back
ever his shoulder a comment to me which
I didn't quite catch, but which might have

been "Gimme a better reason."
It's a good thing I wasn't in his path: he
might have nearly mowed me down as so
many other bicyclists have nearly done as
I've tried to walk across Serra.
Bicyclists should be reminded that they
don't have an unfettered right of way.
Motorists stop and look at stop signs; intel
ligent pedestrians do too. Bicyclists should
at least slow down, and not regard with
airy condescension anyone who happens to
be where they want to go. And especially
at the start of the school year, we should
give a little slack to drivers, and others,
who are a little uncertain of where they're
headed on our confusing campus, or who
perhaps are merely trying to cross Serra
without hitting a lot of suicidal bicyclists.
