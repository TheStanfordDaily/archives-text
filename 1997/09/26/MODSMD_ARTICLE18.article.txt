LIKE overexcited
puppies that shit
on themselves,
freshmen are antithetical
to everything that tired,
jaded seniors represent. I
know antithetical is a big
word, freshpeople, but I
also know that you're

smart enough to know what it means — I
know because you have a nasty tendency
to repeat exactly what you got on the
SAT. Stop it. In four years you can parade
around LSAT scores, and that's much
more gratifying. Trust me, because with a
178, I know.
In a perfect world, advice is doled out
by people who care to people who listen.
In the real world, advice is doled out by
people who don't care to people who
don't listen. Witness this column.
But 1 can still give out advice. I would
advise you to take a long look at your
freshman advisor, because you'll never see
him again.
I would also advise you not to raise
your hand at any time in class. This mere
ly distracts the professor from a gratifying
50 minutes of self-aggrandizement and
often drags class onward long after more
seasoned students have finished the
crossword.
Do not plead intellectual curiosity. I,
for one, have the approximate intellectual

curiosity of a potato. I find it impossible to
believe that other people are different.
Nor do I care to have you prove me wrong
by asking questions three minutes before
class ends.
Neither should you protest loudly in
the CoHo that you are taking 21 units. The
better-looking, older people you are trying
to impress are more concerned with steal
ing pitchers to get back at the crone
behind the counter who took their fake ID
sophomore year. If you really want to
impress older students, try telling your
friends about the time you slept with Alan
Greenspan during you internship at Gold
man Sachs. Give it a shot, watch the ears
prick up.
You can also live without ever going to
the Food Service fun fair or Flicks and die
a contented alum. 11 you want dinner and
a movie, borrow the car from the electrical
engineering major down the hall. He
won't be needing it.
Without bragging about how you were
the smartest in Pallokaville High, or pes
tering the professor with questions, or
groaning under the load of a pre-med
major, what is a freshman to do, eh?
You could join a fraternity, if you enjoy
that kind of thing, which you probably
don't because Vice Provost of Student
Affairs James Montoya was about as care
ful in rejecting future partiers as he was in
rejecting attractive women when he was in

charge of admissions. Try it anyway.
You'll have plenty of time to explore the
limits of heterosexuality, a hobby that the
admissions office seems to be encouraging
in its admits. You might come iO like being
paddled. I did.
Drugs are another easy way to keep
yourself occupied. Make a point of trying
all the drugs — no point in regrets later.
Don't know where to get the goods? Just
hop in Dad's BMW and cruise the Ten
derloin looking naive; someone with be
with you shortly. Or if you're afraid of a
grisly death, go to EBF and have someone
there buy for you. No one's going to miss
one of those dirty hippies, right? Why,
your mother would be appalled to know
that they were even on your campus.
Don't be afraid to be promiscuous,
either. If you're ugly, that's okay. It just
means that you'll never sleep with anyone
who isn't ugly, unless you have a lot of
money. Either way, make the most of the
Harvard of the repressed. Surprise that
lonely industrial engineering co-term at
Full Moon on the Quad with a quick roll in
the ecologically conscious scrub grass.
Whatever you do, have fun. You can
always graduate with a degree in Commu
nication. And as for the money, your par
ents can't live forever, right?

compensates for inadequacies in other areas.
