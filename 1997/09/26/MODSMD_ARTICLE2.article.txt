## Bookstore Advisory Board formed as forum to hear student concerns 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
ASSU and Bookstore represen
tatives have formed a new commit
tee to improve the quality of the
store's student services in light of
complaints last year.
Bookstore Manager Jim
Sobczyk and ASSU President
Emily Andrus have set the first
meeting of the Bookstore Adviso
ry Board for Oct. 16. The board's
creation comes partly in response
to the work of the student group
SMOC, founded last year as Stop
Monopolies on Campus.
SMOC, which this year
changed its name to Students
Monitoring Organizations on
Campus, organized an exchange to
allow students to save money on
books in protest of what its
founders saw as unfair prices and
exchange rates at the Bookstore.
The board will consist of four
students, two staff members, two
professors and two Bookstore rep
resentatives. Andrus and ASSU
Vice President Ben Decker will se
lect the student members.
According to Andrus, applica
tions for the four student positions
will be available at the ASSU of
fice next week. All students are el
igible for the positions, Andrus
said.
Sobczyk will be responsible for

selecting the staff and faculty of
the board. He is currently obtain
ing recommendations from admin
istrators.
"This is the first time that the
students and the Bookstore have
come together in an effort to im
prove student services and serve
the needs of the Stanford commu
nity," Andrus said. "Sometimes
the Bookstore feels like it is being
picked on by the students, and
they want their own concerns to be
fairly heard."
Andrus said the main objectives
of such an advisory board are to
create an open dialogue between
Stanford campus and the Book
store and to make sure student and
faculty needs are being addressed.
It will also give the Bookstore an
opportunity to publicize or explain
its concerns, particularly in reply
to charges of overpricing, she said.
Sobczyk, too, is optimistic
about what the board can achieve.
"This committee enables us to
get feedback from students," he
said. "We have not had any com
plaints recently, but if anything
surfaces, we would like to address
the issues in an open and fair way."
The formation of groups such as
SMOC signaled to Andrus that it
was necessary to create a "forum
to voice student concerns," she
said.
Senior Eric Friedman,
SMOC's current president, said,
"I am very pleased with the good
faith effort that the Bookstore has
put into cooperating with us."
Many students responded posi
tively to news of the board's cre
ation, others felt the board needs
to prove itself. "1 seriously doubt
that the Board can do muoh to im
prove student services," said se
nior Wade DeGottardi. "As a stu
dent, 1 feel like I'm being ripped
off. I want prices lowered, and [the
Bookstore] can't do anything."
Sobczyk and Andrus plan to
hold board meetings several
times a quarter.
