# Students create issues forum
## Group aims to improve communication with administration 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
A group of Stanford students have formed an organi
zation concerned with giving students a forum to express
their opinions and have them heard.
The Stanford University Issues Forum, or SUNIF,
will organize debates twice each month on topics decid
ed by the forum's officers. The University administra
tion has already shown support for the concept, said
SUNIF President Om Kundu, a sophomore.
"Basically, the idea is that last year and in previous
years, we have seen that this university has real issues
which need to be confronted and there doesn't exist a
forum for open debate," Kundu said. "All of us at Stan
ford have strong opinions but no place to discuss them,
and that is what SUNIF wants to provide."
Kundu envisions an academic debate with pro and
con teams, each of which will consist of one faculty mem
ber, one administrator and one student. There will be an
application process for students who would like to speak
in the debates.
Kundu said he is talking to Stanford's student TV sta
tion, SCBN, about providing live coverage.
SUNIF organizers have been meeting with adminis

trators to rally support.
"Last week we had a meeting with [University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper], and he assured us that he would
expect the faculty and administration to be a part of
these debates," Kundu said. "He expressed a strong in
terest and very wholehearted support."
"We want to make students' concerns heard, and the
acknowledgment of those concerns has to come from the
administration," Kundu said.
Among the topics that he would like to see addressed,
Kundu said, are the course evaluation system and the
relevance of ethnic theme dorms. "And eventually I
would like to expand to issues that affect us outside of
Stanford," he said.
Kundu and SUNIF Public Relations Chairman Mar
tin Shim, a junior, emphasized that their group doesn't
have an agenda.
"We're not a biased group. We're just creating a place
for discussion," Shim said.
Currently, SUNIF has 25 members, with an officer
team of four, according to Kundu.
"The message that 1 really want to be sending out to
students is this: You decide whether students' opinions
will matter on this campus," he said. "Students at Stan
ford are the ones who will make or break this group."
