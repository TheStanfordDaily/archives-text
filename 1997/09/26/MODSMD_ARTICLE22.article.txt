## Soccer fights Bronco jinx 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
In three years of suiting up for the Stanford women's
soccer team, junior Tracye Lawyer has seen and experi
enced a lot: three convocations, nine finals weeks, 61
showings of Flicks, and more than 4,5(X) freshmen.
But one thing the forward has never seen is a Cardi
nal women's soccer team that's been able to beat Santa
Clara.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ TOMORROW: No. 17 Stanford (3-4) at No. 4 Santa
Clara (6-0-1) at Duck Shaw Stadium, 7 p.m.

Tomorrow, Stanford will try to reverse history when
it meets the fourth-ranked Broncos (6-0-1) at 7 p.m. at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium.
"The whole team's pretty pumped," Lawyer said.
The Stanford-Santa Clara soccer rivalry is one of the
biggest non-Cal rivalries in all of Stanford sports. But
recently, the results have all been one-sided.
Exhibit A: last season, after beating Stanford 2-1 in
the regular season, the Broncos dealt the Card a crush
ing 3-2 loss to knock the team out of the NCAA play
offs.
Exhibit B, 1995: see exhibit A. Following the stan
dard script, the Broncos handed the Cardinal another 3-
2 first-round playoff defeat in sudden-death overtime to
kick them out of the postseason.
Need anything else?
"They beat us last year in the regular season and in
the NCA As," said head coach Steve Swanson. "But you
can throw all of that out. For this game there is a lot of
emotion and a lot of tradition. Whether it's a scrimmage
or the playoffs, Santa C lara is al
ways an emotional game."
The recent losses will serve to
"fire us up." said senior midfieldei
Emily Hurt. "It makes lis want to
make it go our way this year."
The game comes at a critical time
for the No. 17 ( ardinal (3-4). which
last weekend dropped two games at
home in the Nike Invitational. I'he
team has seen its disappointing first
month hinge 011 one simple defi
ciency: an inability to shoot the ball
into the back of the net.
The Cardinal has outshot every
opponent this season, usually b\ a 2-
1 ratio.
"We're making plenty of chances
for ourselves," Swanson said.
"We're just not finishing them off."
"We've been playing well de
spite the results," Lawyer con
curred. "As far as finishing is con
cerned, it will come. Everyone on
this team can finish well."
Whieh is why a visitor to
women's soccer practice this week
would have seen Burt, Lawyer and
the rest of the team driving towards
the goal again and again, practicing
finishing drills late into the after
noon.
But perhaps the deficiency has
more to do with psychology than
skill.
"We've been unlucky," Swanson
said, "and that's dangerous because
it makes it hard to relax out there. If
we relax, we'll get a little bit better
shots and a little bit better crosses,
and that could make all the differ
ence."
