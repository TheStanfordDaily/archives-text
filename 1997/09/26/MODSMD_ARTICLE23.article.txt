"We just gotta score," said senior defenseman
Nathan Osborn. "We play solid defensively, and our of
fense is working. We're just not scoring."
"We need more goals," agreed Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti.
Converting the Cardinal's offensive opportunities
into goals has proved challenging for the team in the first
few games of the season.
Despite getting 10 shots on goal during a non-confer
ence matchup against the top-ranked Pepperdine on
Sept. 19, the Cardinal netted only two of those shots and
suffered a 9-2 loss.
In a rematch between the Waves and the Cardinal
the next day, Stanford fired off 19 shots, only three of
which were successful.
The Cardinal averaged 3.25 goals
per quarter during its 13-9 victory
over UC-Santa Barbara last Sunday
at the Southern California Tourna
ment. But despite the win, Detta
manti would have liked to have seen
a higher score.
According to him, optimizing
Stanford's 6-on-5 power plays is cru
cial to increasing the score. The Car
dinal is currently 15-for-34 on power
plays.
"We should he ahout 60 percent
on that," Dettamanti said.
Pacific will he no easy opponent.
Despite the graduation of several of
the Tigers' starters and a new inter
im head coach — replacing John
Tanner, now the head women's
water polo coach at Stanford —
scoring will he imperative for the
Cardinal in its first home game of the
season.
"They've only played one game,
so they don't have the benefit of
game experience, but they're always
a good solid team," Dettamanti said.
"They give us a tough game."
Several Cardinal starters will re
main on the sidelines Saturday due
to internal team infractions during
the Southern California Tourna
ment last weekend.
According to Dettamanti, fresh
man driver Kendall Benson, sopho
more holeman Michael Lipinski and
sophomore fielder Andy Walhurger
will probably step up as starters this
weekend.
"That'll give us six starters and
three subs," Dettamanti said.
Defensively, the Cardinal ap
pears solid, with junior goalie Chris
Aguilera tallying 47 saves for the
season.
"We've been working on our de
fense," Aguilera said. "We're trying
to put more pressure on the ball."
For now, though, scoring matters
most.
