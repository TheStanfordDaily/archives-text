"We just gotta score," said senior defenseman
Nathan Osborn. "We play solid defensively, and our of
fense is working. We're just not scoring."
"We need more goals," agreed Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti.
Converting the Cardinal's offensive opportunities
into goals has proved challenging for the team in the first
few games of the season.
Despite getting 10 shots on goal during a non-confer
ence matchup against the top-ranked Pepperdine on
Sept. 19, the Cardinal netted only two of those shots and
suffered a 9-2 loss.
In a rematch between the Waves and the Cardinal
the next day, Stanford fired off 19 shots, only three of
which were successful.
