be Arizona State, last year's 11-game
winner, right?
Good guesses, but all incorrect. Not
many people realize the Oregon Ducks,
with 24 wins from 1994-%, are the Pac
10's most successful team during that
stretch.
This season Oregon (3-0,1-0 Pac-10)
is off to another good start, and Stan
ford (2-1,1-0) will try to hand the Ducks
their first loss of the season when the
two teams face off tomorrow night at
7:15 at Stanford Stadium.
The Cardinal, coming off a 27-24 win
over the Ducks' intrastate rival, Oregon
State, is attempting to go 2-0 in the Pac
-10 for the second time in Tyrone Will
ingham's three years as head coach.
Stanford, after struggling to win
against San Jose State and the Beavers,
will also try to put together a complete

performance for the first time this sea
son, despite key injuries.
The secondary has been learning to
cope without one of its top performers,
redshirt sophomore safety Tim Smith,
who is out for the season. Now the of
fensive line must do some shuffling as
well.
Sophomore starting left tackle Jeff
Cronshagen will miss Saturday's game
with a sprained knee he suffered last
week, and his backup, junior Brian
Donoghue, is questionable with an in
jured ankle that has sidelined him the
past two weeks. If Donoghue can't play
against the Ducks, sophomore guard
Joe Fairchild will make his first career
start, leaving Stanford thin up front.
This adversity comes with the offen
sive line struggling even without in
juries. Stanford has allowed 15 quarter
back sacks, the most of any Pac-1()
team.
Better news for the Cardinal is that
All-Pac-10 middle linebacker Chris
Draft, who did not play last Saturday
with a hamstring problem, probably
will see action this weekend in Stan
ford's conference home opener.
Stanford players and coaches agree
the team's play needs to improve quick
ly if the Cardinal is to challenge for the
Rose Bowl. But there have been some
encouraging signs lately.
The running game picked up consid
erably against Oregon State, as seniors
Mike Mitchell and Anthony Bookman
both rushed for more than 100 yards.

The no-huddle offense also worked
well during the game-winning drive
against Oregon State and might be used
more often.
"II we can get a defense to soften up,
we'll consider more no-huddle," Will

ingham said.
And the defense, while giving up
more yards than it would like, has been
stingy in the second half. Against the

Senior fullback Greg Cornelia rumbles through the San Jose State defense
in Stanford's home opener Sept. 6. After two road games, the Cardinal re
turns to Stanford Stadium tomorrow at 7:15 p.m.
