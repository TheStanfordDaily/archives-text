be Arizona State, last year's 11-game
winner, right?
Good guesses, but all incorrect. Not
many people realize the Oregon Ducks,
with 24 wins from 1994-%, are the Pac
10's most successful team during that
stretch.
This season Oregon (3-0,1-0 Pac-10)
is off to another good start, and Stan
ford (2-1,1-0) will try to hand the Ducks
their first loss of the season when the
two teams face off tomorrow night at
7:15 at Stanford Stadium.
The Cardinal, coming off a 27-24 win
over the Ducks' intrastate rival, Oregon
State, is attempting to go 2-0 in the Pac
-10 for the second time in Tyrone Will
ingham's three years as head coach.
Stanford, after struggling to win
against San Jose State and the Beavers,
will also try to put together a complete

performance for the first time this sea
son, despite key injuries.
The secondary has been learning to
cope without one of its top performers,
redshirt sophomore safety Tim Smith,
who is out for the season. Now the of
fensive line must do some shuffling as
well.
Sophomore starting left tackle Jeff
Cronshagen will miss Saturday's game
with a sprained knee he suffered last
week, and his backup, junior Brian
Donoghue, is questionable with an in
jured ankle that has sidelined him the
past two weeks. If Donoghue can't play
against the Ducks, sophomore guard
Joe Fairchild will make his first career
start, leaving Stanford thin up front.
This adversity comes with the offen
sive line struggling even without in
juries. Stanford has allowed 15 quarter
back sacks, the most of any Pac-1()
team.
Better news for the Cardinal is that
All-Pac-10 middle linebacker Chris
Draft, who did not play last Saturday
with a hamstring problem, probably
will see action this weekend in Stan
ford's conference home opener.
Stanford players and coaches agree
the team's play needs to improve quick
ly if the Cardinal is to challenge for the
Rose Bowl. But there have been some
encouraging signs lately.
The running game picked up consid
erably against Oregon State, as seniors
Mike Mitchell and Anthony Bookman
both rushed for more than 100 yards.

The no-huddle offense also worked
well during the game-winning drive
against Oregon State and might be used
more often.
"II we can get a defense to soften up,
we'll consider more no-huddle," Will

ingham said.
And the defense, while giving up
more yards than it would like, has been
stingy in the second half. Against the



Allison Otto — Daily file
Senior fullback Greg Cornelia rumbles through the San Jose State defense
in Stanford's home opener Sept. 6. After two road games, the Cardinal re
turns to Stanford Stadium tomorrow at 7:15 p.m.
Beavers, Stanford allowed just four
yards rushing and six first downs
after halftime, and for the season
the Cardinal defense has given up
only SO total yards on the ground in
three second halves.
But Stanford may need a better
overall team effort to heat an ()rc
gon team that holds the nation's sec
ond-longest winning streak at six.
The Ducks are a young team,
having lost 11 starters from last
year's 6 S team. But they have a
numbei of potent offensive
Weapons.
I ailback Saladin McCullough is
one i>l the best runners in the Pac
-10. The senior is averaging almost
1(H) yards per game on the ground,
and last year scored a school-record

15 touchdowns. He also leads the
Pac 10 in kickoff returns.
"I think Saladin McCullough is
probably the best tunning back to
evei play here," said Oregon head
coach Mike Belotti.
Oregon also has two talented
quarterbacks who each figure to
play on Saturday. Junior Jason
Maas, a more traditional drop back
passer, is sixth in the l'ac 10 in pass
ing efficiency.
His counterpart, junior Akili
Smith, is more athletic and uses Ins
scrambling ability to make plays
Smith last year was considered the
top player in junior college football.
"(Maas and Smith) both are
doing some good thingi>, Belotti
said. "We will continue to rotate om
quar let backs."
Add to the mix talented speed
ster Pat Johnson, a wideout who
burned Stanford for a 45-yard kick
off return in last year's 27-24 ('ardi

nal win,and tight end Make Spence,
and the Ducks have averaged Ml
yards of offense per game
Hut the defense hits not been .is
strong for ()regon, allowing close to
4(H) yards each game. Ihe Ducks
haven't exactly won impressively,
either two of their wins have
been a come-from behind victory at
Nevada, a team which |ust recently
switched to Division I A, and last
week's 43-40 overtime win over
I lesno State, one of the Western
Athletic Conference's weaker
teams.
Stanford also has recent history
on its side. Oregon has started * 0
live of the last six years, but hasn't
made it to 4 0 since l l )KK. I he ( ar
dinal has beaten Oregon m live ol
seven tries in the 'Wis, including
two straight. Last year, Stanford
won a dramatic 27 24 contest that
was the first overtime game in
school history.
