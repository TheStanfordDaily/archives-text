# Unbeaten Oregon wins playing musical QBs

### Alex Pond Special to The Stanford Daily 
Three games into the 1997 season, it is
clear Oregon doesn't have a full-time No. 1
quarterback.
Don't expect one to be named anytime
soon.
Following the Ducks' dramatic 43-40
overtime victory over F resno State on Sat
urday, much of the conversation focused
on the quarterback situation.
There seems to be a general consensus
among football followers that a team needs
to name one starter, and often it is in the
best interest of a football team to have just
one quarterback taking the majority of the
snaps.
But splitting time at the position can
work, as proven by Ohio State in winning
the Rose Howl a year ago.
The bottom line is winning games. And
no matter how unspectacular, unimpres
sive, or unconvincing ()regon's three victo
ries have been, they have been victories
nonetheless.
The quarterback situation the Ducks
have, with Akili Smith and Jason Maas

sharing time, would certainly lie a quarter
back "controversy" had the Ducks not held
on to win all three games.
"We're going to do whatever we have to
to win," said ()regon offensive coordinator
and quarterbacks coach Dirk Koetter.
"The best thing for the Duck football team
is to play two quarterbacks."
Based on their performances up to this
point, one guy has not clearly stepped up
above the other. Hut it seems as if the Ore
gon coaches arc leaning toward Maas.
Moth quarterbacks saw action against
Fresno Slate, but Maas took the majority of
the snaps. I fe started the game and was also
sent in late in the fourth quarter with the
game on the line, just as he was in the
Ducks' previous two games against Neva
da and Arizona.
Maas finished 17-of-24 with IK9 yards
and two touchdowns â€” a solid overall per
formance, although he did throw two inter
ceptions, including one on the game's first
play that set up a Fresno State touchdown.
Smith was also impressive. I fe was 7-of
-12 with 70 yards and directed the team on
