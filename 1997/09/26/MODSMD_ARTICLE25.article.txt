# Unbeaten Oregon wins playing musical QBs
## 
### Alex Pond Special to The Stanford Daily 
Three games into the 1997 season, it is
clear Oregon doesn't have a full-time No. 1
quarterback.
Don't expect one to be named anytime
soon.
Following the Ducks' dramatic 43-40
overtime victory over F resno State on Sat
urday, much of the conversation focused
on the quarterback situation.
There seems to be a general consensus
among football followers that a team needs
to name one starter, and often it is in the
best interest of a football team to have just
one quarterback taking the majority of the
snaps.
But splitting time at the position can
work, as proven by Ohio State in winning
the Rose Howl a year ago.
The bottom line is winning games. And
no matter how unspectacular, unimpres
sive, or unconvincing ()regon's three victo
ries have been, they have been victories
nonetheless.
The quarterback situation the Ducks
have, with Akili Smith and Jason Maas

sharing time, would certainly lie a quarter
back "controversy" had the Ducks not held
on to win all three games.
"We're going to do whatever we have to
to win," said ()regon offensive coordinator
and quarterbacks coach Dirk Koetter.
"The best thing for the Duck football team
is to play two quarterbacks."
Based on their performances up to this
point, one guy has not clearly stepped up
above the other. Hut it seems as if the Ore
gon coaches arc leaning toward Maas.
Moth quarterbacks saw action against
Fresno Slate, but Maas took the majority of
the snaps. I fe started the game and was also
sent in late in the fourth quarter with the
game on the line, just as he was in the
Ducks' previous two games against Neva
da and Arizona.
Maas finished 17-of-24 with IK9 yards
and two touchdowns — a solid overall per
formance, although he did throw two inter
ceptions, including one on the game's first
play that set up a Fresno State touchdown.
Smith was also impressive. I fe was 7-of
-12 with 70 yards and directed the team on

two second-quarter touchdown drives. I le hit
A.J. Jelks for the first score and connected
with Blake Spence — a favorite target of both
quarterbacks — for the second.
When Smith entered the game late in the
first quarter, the Ducks trailed 14-7. He re
mained at the helm of the offense throughout
the second quarter, and the Ducks led 21-14
at halftime. But Maas was sent onto the field
to start the second half.
"I thought that was the best thing at the
time," Koetter said.
Maas, however, was not expected to go
back out.
"I was surprised to start the second half,
but not to come in at the end of the game," he
said.
Maas directed the Ducks to two more
scoring drives in the third quarter. With 11
minutes and 52 seconds remaining in the
game, alter the Bulldogs scored a touch
down to draw within 37-27, Smith was sent
back in.
But it w;is three-and-out for the Ducks. To
Smith's credit, the failure to advance was not
all his fault.
After Saladin McCullough rushed for two
yards, fullback Eric Winn dropped a pass in
the fiat that could have been caught, and
Smith was sacked on third down.
The Bulldogs then got within 37-34, and
Maas was sent out onto the field in
crunchtime, with just 8:34 remaining.
"At that point in time we were not doing
anything defensively to stop them and we
needed probably to get a spark back offensive

ly." said Oregon head coach Mike Bellotti.
Hut Oregon didn't find that spark. After
gaining a first down on a Fresno State pass in
terference penalty, the Ducks were forced to
punt.
Overall, the evidence for both quarter
backs was inconclusive. Both moved the ball
early on and scored some points, but both
also failed to move the offense late in the
game. Until, of course, Maas directed the
game-winning touchdown drive in overtime.
Fresno State head coach Pat Hill was im
pressed by Maas' poise in overtime.
"Maas definitely had some great compo
sure out there," I lill said. "I thought he did a
good job."
For now it seems Oregon fans, players and
coaches will have to live with the rotating
quarterbacks.
"It's not the best thing, but it works," Maas
said. "The bottom line is that you want to
win."
"I don't know what we'll do next week,"
Bellotti said. "We'll probably play both. 1
think it's worked out well for us and we con
tinue to get both game experience."
If the Oregon coaches are going to name a
No. 1 quarterback, they definitely won't say
anything about it.
"You guys aren't going to get me to crack
on this," Koettersaid when asked about nam
ing a full-time starter.
"There are different things that they do,
what they bring to the offense," Bellotti said.
"As long as our point total keeps going up,
and it does not adversely affect our offensive
performance or team morale, I'm not sure
that we have to make a choice."
As long as the Ducks win, morale should
not be a problem. It's difficult to complain
about what gets you wins.
