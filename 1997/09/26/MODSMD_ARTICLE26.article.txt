The fourth-ranked Stanford women's
volleyball team gets back into the swing
of its conference schedule this weekend
with matches against Oregon and Ore
gon State.
Both Oregon schools are steadily im
proving and seem to get a little stronger
every year, said head coach Don Shaw
The Cardinal (10-2, 1-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has won 27 straight conference
matches at Maples Pavilion, but the
Beavers will be looking to end that streak
tonight at 7:30 p.m.
Oregon State (7-4, 0-2) is hoping to
gain its first conference win after heart
breaking losses to Washington and
Washington State last weekend. The
Beavers managed to give the undefeated
and 6th-ranked Cougars their biggest
scare of the season just one week ago,
taking Washington State to five games
before falling 15-5, 11-15, 12-15, 15-4,15-
12.
"They had Washington State on the
ropes last weekend," Shaw said.
"They're solid. We need to play well. In

the Pac-10 these teams will battle you."
Oregon State definitely battled (he
Cougars. The Heavers had things knot
ted up at 12-12 in the decisive game five.

to be hit off the block and into the anten
nae but was called for a replay because
neither referee was certain that the ball
had hit the blocker.
Washington State won the ensuing re
play on a ball that two Oregon State hit
ters watched land between them, giving
the Cougars a 13-12 edge in the game
a particularly crushing blow with the
rally-scoring format.
Perhaps suffering a bit of a letdown,
()regon State was less impressive the fol
lowing night against Washington, losing

15-8, 15-6, 15-10.
Nevertheless, Oregon State will pro
vide a look that's a bit different from any
Stanford has seen this season, running
what Shaw calls a "modified" 6-2 offense.
The Beavers essentially make a double
switch when their setter gets to the back
row, bringing in another setter and a hit
ter. The idea is to stay with a bigger line
up by keeping the setter out of other po
sitions in the rotation.
"Oregon State is going with a bigger
lineup," Shaw said "That will keep us
honest. They've also got a couple of for
eign players (that give them a different
style)."
In addition to dealing with Oregon
State's offense, Stanford will be doing
everything it can to control injuries.
Sophomore outside hitter Kern Walsh is
just back after having her shoulder
stretched out earlier this week a pro
cedure that required Walsh to be put
under anesthesia.
Walsh returned to practice in the mid
dle of the week and hasn't missed any
matches because of the procedure. Hut
