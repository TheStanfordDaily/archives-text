FEILD HOCKEY
■ TOMORROW: Stanford (4-4) at Pacific
(1-6)
tomorrow, the Cardinal (4-4) travels to
Stoekton to play Pacific in what should he little
more than preparation tor an ()et. 4 match at
California.
fhe I p.m. game at Pacific "is a league
game, and we need to win," said junior mid
fielder Justina Williams, the team captain.
"We should win. In the past, they haven't been
a great team."
Stanford has a lot more on its mind than Pa
cific. Playing at Cal is always difficult, and 10
days after that game, the C 'animal will play the
first of four tough East ( oast teams in a tour
nament at Boston College.
"You could consider this a tune-up for the
C al game," she said, "but that doesn't mean we
can take it lightly."
fhe Cardinal can't afford another loss if it
hopes to receive one of four at-large bids to the
N( 'AA Tournament.
"II we win the rest of our games and receive
a ranking," Williams said, "we have a chance
to make the tournament. But it all depends on

an at-large bid."
Williams and fellow juniors Carey Oloyd
and Sarah Medeiros rejoined the team last
week after touring with the U.S. Junior World
Cup team. ITie Cardinal is 3-1 since their re
turn.
"I don't think our team was necessarily
weaker without them," said sophomore for
ward Mallory Chambers, "but with them
here, it adds a dimension our team was lack
ing."
More than anything, Chambers said, the
trio brings valuable experience back from its
international tour with the World ( up team.
"l.xperience is what you need to plav," she
said. "You can practice all you want, but until
von have theexpei icnce playing quality teams,
you're missing something."
( loyd. Medeiros and ( hambers. along with
junior Moniquc I eroux, share time in a front
line that has been Stanford's strength in the
[last four games.
"We're scoring more, and we're putting a
lot more pressure on the ball," Williams said.
I he captain also praised senior goalkeeper
Kelly Naylor, who allowed onlv one goal in the
( ardinal's three victories at a St. I ouis tourna
ment last weekend.
I lie lone goal off Naylor came in a 3 I upset
win over Ball State Saturday. In that game,
('hambers said, "our team looked incredible."
"We're coming together and gelling well,"
she said. "We lost some key games in the be
ginning of the season, but if we perform to our
ability the rest of the season, we can do it."
