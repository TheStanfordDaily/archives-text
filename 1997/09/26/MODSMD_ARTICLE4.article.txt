# All guaranteed students housed

All undergraduates who were guaranteed
housing have been placed in rooms after
three months of shuffling and finger-biting.
After last night's walk-in housing meet
ings, all undergraduates who agreed to be
placed in any housing the I Iniversity offered
had a room to sleep in. More than 230 under
graduates were left unassigtied after last
spring's housing Draw.
Housing Assignment Services found
spaces for some of those students during the
summer after converting study rooms and re
arranging room configurations. Other stu-

dents chose to live off cam
pus, giving up their guaran
teed year.
In June, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais decided
the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity would lose its
house for a year as punish
ment after a freshman be
came extremely drunk at a

pledge event and was taken to the hospital.
Although Dekes were guaranteed housing,
most chose to live off campus, opening up sev
eral more rooms for other undergraduates.
