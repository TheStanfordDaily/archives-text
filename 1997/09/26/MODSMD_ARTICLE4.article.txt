# All guaranteed students housed
## 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
All undergraduates who were guaranteed
housing have been placed in rooms after
three months of shuffling and finger-biting.
After last night's walk-in housing meet
ings, all undergraduates who agreed to be
placed in any housing the I Iniversity offered
had a room to sleep in. More than 230 under
graduates were left unassigtied after last
spring's housing Draw.
Housing Assignment Services found
spaces for some of those students during the
summer after converting study rooms and re
arranging room configurations. Other stu-

dents chose to live off cam
pus, giving up their guaran
teed year.
In June, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais decided
the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity would lose its
house for a year as punish
ment after a freshman be
came extremely drunk at a

pledge event and was taken to the hospital.
Although Dekes were guaranteed housing,
most chose to live off campus, opening up sev
eral more rooms for other undergraduates.

Deke president Mike Grenier, a
junior, said that a member who had
been in the area over the summer
had worked to find off-campus
housing for many Dekes, and that
Dekes entering the walk-in had the
last picks at the walk-in, because
they entered late.
Grenier, who is currently board
ing in the Kappa Sigma house, said
about 30 Dekes had expected to live
in the Deke house next year.
"The housing crisis is definitely a
problem," junior Joe Freund, a
Deke. "Had Delta Kappa Epsilon
not lost their house, it would have
been even more severe."
Freund called his off-campus
housing "less than ideal" and em
phasized the need for the Universi
ty to take action to resolve a crisis
that he called a "definite breach of
contract."
"The University owes us place
ment before the school year starts,"
Freund said.
But Kathleen Bransfield, the
manager of Housing Assignment
Services, disagreed.
"All students are guaranteed
four years of University housing if
they apply either in the first round
of the Draw or by the waiting-list
deadline as long as they indicate a
willingness to live anywhere."

All students who fit that category
have been placed in housing. Brans
field explained that many students
must wait until the end of the first
week to receive their housing as
signments because "we need to find
out the number of spaces available
because of no-shows."
"No-shows" are students who ac
cept housing assignments in the
spring but choose not to take the
room before fall quarter begins.
To accommodate the over
whelming number of students who
were unassigned, Housing Assign
ment Services had to do some cre
ative rearranging.
Two co-op spaces normal ly occu
pied by graduate students were as
signed to undergraduates and, when
possible, rooms normally occupied
by males were given to females or
vice versa.
Nine men remained unassigned
after Wednesday night, none of
whom was guaranteed housing.
Fourteen vacancies remain for
women.
A high yield rate in freshman ad
missions and expensive off-campus
housing caused the University's
problems this year.
"The crunch for housing reflects
the high acceptance rate, which is
exciting for the University," ASSU
President Emily Andrus said. "But
the University really needs to follow
through and provide undergraduate
housing."
