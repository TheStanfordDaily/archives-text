# Res Ed adjusting house staff schedules
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education is
shifting the timing of staff selection tor co
operatives and self-operated housing, a
move that concerns some of the current
staff of these houses.
Currently, co-ops and self-ops choose
their house managers, food managers and
financial managers during winter quarter,
and the new staff takes over at the begin
ning of spring quarter. A term lasts

through the following winter quarter.
For University-run housing, however,
all staff members are hired for terms last
ing from fall quarter through spring quar
ter.
Res Ed is trying to synchronize the hir
ing schedules so staff members in charge
of hiring chefs and cleaning crews will
have more experience during negotia
tions in the spring, said Laurette Beeson,
assistant director for student managers on
the Row.
But some staff members at self-ops are

concerned that managers will suffer with
out the hands-on training that the current
system allows.
Last year, Beeson and Assoc. Res Ed
Director Ann Porteus brought together
managers from Row houses to talk about
the situation. The changes have not vet
been discussed this year, Beeson said, but
a committee of Row residents and Row
stall members will be formed.
"We told the RAs last year at training
that each house would have the ability to
make the transition happen" in whatever

manner they chose, she said. That means
each Row house will decide whether the
curient staff should serve a fourth quarter
in the spring or whether the new staff
should take over in the spring and serve
four quarters through the end of next
year.
Res Ed is also considering forming a
committee to investigate a central appli
cant pool for all staff positions on the Row
in order to increase the number of people
applying for positions, Beeson said.
Some houses have had trouble filling
all their positions in recent years.
Houses that synchronized their
schedules with University-operated
housing this year include Xanadu
and 353 Campus Drive.
However, Xanadu Financial
Manager Ryan Balliet, a junior, isn't
convinced that the change was a

good one. "Personally, I think it'd he
better to have the managers and staff
take over in spring," he said.
Staying on the current time
schedule allows new staff members
to work with old staff members for a
quarter before the old staff leaves,
Balliet pointed out. That "allows for
a sense of continuity in the way the
house is run,"he said.
Senior Alex Teekell, the house
manager for Slavianskii Dom, said
the proposed changes take away
valuable training time from the in

coming staff.
"It's one thing to have somebody
point things out to you, hut until you
are faced with the full responsibility
of your position, it's tough not to
have a [current house manager] help
you," he said.
But Beeson argued that a newly
elected house manager or other staff
member might not be able to com
plete as effectively and efficiently
tasks such as renegotiation of cook
contracts and other house adminis
trative matters. In those cases, she

said, two quarters of experience
would be useful.
"The logistics of all this are not
out yet," Beeson said. "We do not
want to stick our noses in Row hous
ing business, but Row houses are a
Res Ed responsibility, and we are re
sponsible for helping them stay fi
nancially soluble."
In addition, Beeson claims new
staff members will receive the same
amount of training, so newer staff
members would not be any less qual
ified than in years past.
