# Res Ed adjusting house staff schedules

### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education is
shifting the timing of staff selection tor co
operatives and self-operated housing, a
move that concerns some of the current
staff of these houses.
Currently, co-ops and self-ops choose
their house managers, food managers and
financial managers during winter quarter,
and the new staff takes over at the begin
ning of spring quarter. A term lasts

through the following winter quarter.
For University-run housing, however,
all staff members are hired for terms last
ing from fall quarter through spring quar
ter.
Res Ed is trying to synchronize the hir
ing schedules so staff members in charge
of hiring chefs and cleaning crews will
have more experience during negotia
tions in the spring, said Laurette Beeson,
assistant director for student managers on
the Row.
But some staff members at self-ops are

concerned that managers will suffer with
out the hands-on training that the current
system allows.
Last year, Beeson and Assoc. Res Ed
Director Ann Porteus brought together
managers from Row houses to talk about
the situation. The changes have not vet
been discussed this year, Beeson said, but
a committee of Row residents and Row
stall members will be formed.
"We told the RAs last year at training
that each house would have the ability to
make the transition happen" in whatever

manner they chose, she said. That means
each Row house will decide whether the
curient staff should serve a fourth quarter
in the spring or whether the new staff
should take over in the spring and serve
four quarters through the end of next
year.
Res Ed is also considering forming a
committee to investigate a central appli
cant pool for all staff positions on the Row
in order to increase the number of people
