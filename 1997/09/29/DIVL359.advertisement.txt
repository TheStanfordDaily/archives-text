I was taught that the world had a lot of problems; that I could struggle and change them; that intellectual and material gifts
brought the privilege and responsibility of sharing with others less fortunate; and that service is the rent we pay for living —
the very purpose of life and not something you do in your space, time, or after you have reached your personal goals."
— Marian Wright Edelman
