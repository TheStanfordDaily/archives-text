Less than two years
after its launch,
Juno is already the
second-largest
online service in
the United States.
More than 2,800,000
people have created
Juno accounts.
Every day, thousands
more sign up.
And what we've done
so far is just the beginning.
In order to continue our
dynamic growth, we need
to expand our staff
dramatically in almost all
areas, including: software
engineering, marketing,
telecommunications, sales,
finance, analysis, product
development, graphic design,
strategic growth and
member services.
We only hire uncommonly
talented, accomplished, and
intelligent individuals
people who, in their fields,
are the very best. If you are
a college senior or graduate
student with a record of
outstanding achievement
(in any field—our president was
an English major),
we want to hear from you.
Want to be a part of one
