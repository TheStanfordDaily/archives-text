If You Understand These Terms, You Know
Where We're Coming From, And Precisely
Where We're Headed.
Read-Rite is the world's leading independent producer of
data storage recording heads and assemblies. And we're
intent on pushing our leading edge even farther.
We're dramatically expanding our
Research & Development to meet the challenge
of rapidly changing technologies. In disk applications, we're
accelerating the transition u Spin Valve, Giant MR, Colossal
MR, Spin-Dependent Tunneling detectors, and Magneto-
Optics. And we're pursuing multi-channel recording and
digital video recording for tape drive applications.
We've embarked on long-reaching explorations of
new technologies we know we'll need, as well as some we
want to know all about - just in case.
Because we're committed to writing at ever higher
data rates, developing ever-more-accurate thin film deposition
and controls, stretching the envelope of recording physics in
new technology sensors, and pioneering new pathways in
reducing error rates and establishing relationships to device
characteristics.
If you'd like to learn more about the opportunities
in Read-Rite Research & Development, call us at
(510) 683-7149. Fax us at (408) 956-2100. Or E-mail your
resume to steve.kohler@readrite.com.
Read-Rite is building a world-class body in
advanced recording technology; drivers of innovation on a
foray into the future, freely pursuing bold ideas. All to
conceive the next head, ahead of its time.
