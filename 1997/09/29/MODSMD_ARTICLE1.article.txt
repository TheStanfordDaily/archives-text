# No bonfire in Lake Lag for 100th Big Game
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
It's official: The Big Game Bonfire at
Lake Lagunita has been given the ax.
Four years after the bonfire was canceled
because of the presence of an endangered
species in the lake bed, the most recent study
has determined there is no safe way to con
tinue the tradition. Smaller fires have been
staged at other places on campus while stu
dents awaited word of whether the 100 th Big
Game would come complete with a Lake Lag
bonfire.

The bonfire has been a hallmark of Stan
ford ever since the early 19(X)s. It became a
subject of controversy in 1993, when scien
tists discovered that the tiger salamander —
named a "state species of special concern" by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — resided
in sandbanks of Lake Lagunita, where the
bonfire was held.
In 1994, the Axe Committee, the organi
zation that plans most Big Game festivities,
voluntarily discontinued the bonfire. Student
interest, however, has kept the idea of the
bonfire alive. Emily Andrus and Ben Deck
er, current ASSU president and vice presi-

dent, pledged to bring it
back.
Andrus noted that the
idea had at least received
due consideration.
"It's great that the Uni
versity has finally looked at
a proposal. There have been
years and years of uncer-

tainty," she said.
"Nobody denies that [the bonfire] would
have been the ideal thing if we could have
done it safely," Decker said. "The promise
was to push for a definitive solution. I think

that everything that could have been done
was done. Everything within the parameters
of possibility was tried. It's just not ecologi
cally feasible."
The Axe Committee hoped to devise an
alternative plan that would preserve the tra
dition. The University commissioned a
study by Stanford's Center for (Conservation
Biology, charged with finding a more ecolog
ically sound fire. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the California Department of Fish
and Game and Santa Clara County also
helped.
According to Bursar Jon Erickson, the

Axe Committee's adviser, the new bonfire
proposal called for such changes as lowering
the bonfire height and shitting the location of
the fire to a different part of the lake.
"A lot of people put in a lot of time and ef
fort to pursue this tradition," said Dean of
Students Marc Wais. "We were hoping to
pursue it in a smaller size and with safeguards
to minimize the harm to the salamander."

James Montoya and Vice Provost for Institu
tional Planning C ieoffrey C o\, with the assent


Wais
of University President Gerhard
Casper, eventually rejected the plan.
"In the end, even in a modified
version, the bonfire would have
caused too much harm to the sala
mander," Wais said.
In a joint press release Friday, the
Dean of Students' Office, the ASSU
and the Axe Committee expressed a
desire to design a new Big Game tra
dition.
" This announcement will relieve
some pressure," said Decker. "In
the past it has been up in the air,
and now at least we have a definite
answer, and we can move on."
Representatives of groups in
volved with Big Game planning will
meet during the next eight weeks in
order to gather ideas, plan and im
plement this year's new Big Game
festivities to replace the bonfire.
" The Axe Committee is very dis
appointed in the results of the study,
hut we're looking forward to work
ing with the University in coming up
with an alternative to the bonfire,"
said junior Matt Bramlage, chair of
the committee.
According to Bramlage, a fire
works show is one possible alterna

tive which the Axe Committee plans
to propose.
"We're hoping to come up with
an event or an activity that the en
tire student body can rally around,"
said Wais, who will be active in the
effort. He added those concerned

'This announcement will re
lieve some pressure. In the
past it has been up in the
air, and now at least we
have a definite answer, and
we can move on.'

are "hopeful to be coming up with a
new tradition within the next eight
weeks that can endure."
Students were disappointed but
said they accept the ecological limits
on the tradition.
" There's got to be some sort of
compromise," said Ze'eva Kushner,
a senior who has heard about the
bonfire for years. "A new tradition
could be cool."

new Big Game tradition may contact

2778.
