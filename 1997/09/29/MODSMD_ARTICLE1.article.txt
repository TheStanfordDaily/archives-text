# No bonfire in Lake Lag for 100th Big Game
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
It's official: The Big Game Bonfire at
Lake Lagunita has been given the ax.
Four years after the bonfire was canceled
because of the presence of an endangered
species in the lake bed, the most recent study
has determined there is no safe way to con
tinue the tradition. Smaller fires have been
staged at other places on campus while stu
dents awaited word of whether the 100 th Big
Game would come complete with a Lake Lag
bonfire.

The bonfire has been a hallmark of Stan
ford ever since the early 19(X)s. It became a
subject of controversy in 1993, when scien
tists discovered that the tiger salamander —
named a "state species of special concern" by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — resided
in sandbanks of Lake Lagunita, where the
bonfire was held.
In 1994, the Axe Committee, the organi
zation that plans most Big Game festivities,
voluntarily discontinued the bonfire. Student
interest, however, has kept the idea of the
bonfire alive. Emily Andrus and Ben Deck
er, current ASSU president and vice presi-

dent, pledged to bring it
back.
Andrus noted that the
idea had at least received
due consideration.
"It's great that the Uni
versity has finally looked at
a proposal. There have been
years and years of uncer-

tainty," she said.
"Nobody denies that [the bonfire] would
have been the ideal thing if we could have
done it safely," Decker said. "The promise
was to push for a definitive solution. I think

that everything that could have been done
was done. Everything within the parameters
of possibility was tried. It's just not ecologi
cally feasible."
The Axe Committee hoped to devise an
alternative plan that would preserve the tra
dition. The University commissioned a
study by Stanford's Center for (Conservation
Biology, charged with finding a more ecolog
ically sound fire. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the California Department of Fish
and Game and Santa Clara County also
helped.
According to Bursar Jon Erickson, the

Axe Committee's adviser, the new bonfire
proposal called for such changes as lowering
the bonfire height and shitting the location of
the fire to a different part of the lake.
"A lot of people put in a lot of time and ef
fort to pursue this tradition," said Dean of
Students Marc Wais. "We were hoping to
pursue it in a smaller size and with safeguards
to minimize the harm to the salamander."
