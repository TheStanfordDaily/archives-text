# Peace talks will resume

JERUSALEM (AP) - "Preliminary
steps" by the Palestinians to fight terror
ism will lead to a resumption in peace talks
with Israel after a six-month freeze, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
yesterday.
Netanvahu told his Cabinet he expect
ed an agreement to resume the talks to be
reached today at a meeting in New York
between Israeli and Palestinian officials
and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
As a result of what he called the Pales
tinian Authority's "first, preliminary
steps" to fight terrorism, Netanyahu said
he also ordered the release of half the tax
revenues being withheld by Israel
about $17 million â€” to the Palestinians.
Israel cut off tax transfers to the

Palestinians in the wake of two suicide
bombings in Jerusalem on July 30 and
Sept. 4.
The release of the badly needed money
came as the Palestinians stepped up their
crackdown on the Islamic militant group
Hamas, which claimed responsibility for
the bombings.
Over the past three days, Arafat's
forces have rounded up dozens of suspect
ed members of Hamas and closed 16
I lamas institutions, including a kinder
garten and a 'IV station.
Netanyahu said last week he would
continue building in the settlements.
Fhe Palestinians also want Israel to lift
the closure imposed on the West Bank and
Ciiiza following the Jerusalem bombings,
which killed 25 people, including five sui

cide bombers.
The closure has been eased to allow
13,(XX) Palestinians into Israel to work, but
tens of thousands more are barred from
reaching their jobs.
Israel's Finance Ministry said yesterday
that about $17 million would be handed
over to the Palestinians, which represents
about half the sum currently being withheld.
Israel returned about $47 million in two
previous releases. Israeli government
spokesman Moshe Fogel said Israel would
continue to withhold additional money
which comes from customs, income and
health taxes withheld from Palestinian
workers.
During her visit to the region this
month, Albright had urged Israel to stop
withholding the funds.
