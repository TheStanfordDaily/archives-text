THE Faculty Advisory Board's deci
sion in August to grant tenure to
Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta seemed to put an end to one of the
most serious campus controversies in
recent memory.
However, while the board's decision is
clearly a victory for Gupta, the questions
that surfaced during his tenure quest
remain largely unresolved.
We still do not know whether students
won a greater say in faculty promotions,
whether minority and women scholars
came closer to achieving greater recogni
tion and equality in the academic establish
ment, or whether non-traditional research
gained legitimacy among the University's
decision makers.
In a significant sense, therefore, there is
little closure to the controversy surrounding
Gupta's case.
Last year, the cultural anthropologist's
struggle captured the attention of our tradi
tionally apathetic campus and of the nation.
Despite unanimous support from the
Anthropology Department's tenure com
mittee, Gupta was initially denied tenure by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven and his associate deans.
Outraged by the deans' recommenda
tion to deny tenure to Gupta, students
formed the Ad Hoc Committee to Tenure
Akhil Gupta. Additionally, scholars from
other universities sent in scores of letters in
Gupta's support.
After Shoven denied Gupta's appeal in
May, Provost Condoleezza Rice took the
unusual step of forwarding his case to the
board without a recommendation. The
board granted Gupta tenure in August.
These procedural complications only
exacerbate the confusion over what the
board's decision means for the future of
tenure cases. Will the deans continue to
overrule department decisions on tenure
(as they did in cases of Gupta and, more
recently. Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawis
lak)? Will the advisory board again play the
role of a primary review board in tenure
appeals? Are organized protests still a nec
essary avenue for students to express dis
satisfaction about tenure decisions?
Sadly, in the months after the Gupta
affair, the answer to the last question is like
ly to remain "yes."
The tensions over last year's tenure deci
sions revealed that current outlets of stu

dent participation — class evaluations and
letters soliciting opinions on academics
entering the tenure process — fall short of
giving students the voice they desire.
So far the mechanics of the tenure sys
tem at Stanford have not been altered to
close the void between the level of current
student participation in the process and the
role they wish to have.
Of course, tenure is not an easy institu
tion to change. Guided by faculty members
who once went through the same process
themselves, tenure selection is a largely
confidential and extremely technical pro
cess.
At an institution of Stanford's., caliber,
only scholars ranking among the top few in
their field can enjoy the protection of aca
demic freedom that comes with tenure.
Reforms to a process that is both private
and highly selective do not happen quickly.
Yet, it is important to question the
extent to which the Gupta decision can
serve as a precedent for future cases.
The board insists that its decision was
made on "technical grounds," and not
because of a bad review by Humanities and
Sciences Deans.
Secondly, it remains unclear exactly how
much impact student uproar had on the
outcome of the case. While the student
committee was instrumental in bringing
attention to Gupta's plight, other factors,
like support from academics at Stanford
and other institutions, probably played an
important role as well.
Finally, because individual merit is sup
posed to be the fundamental focus of the
tenure process, evaluating the ramifications
of this decision for future cases is compli
cated by the fact that every professor's pro
file and situation is unique.
In short, Gupta's struggle for tenure is
not a final victory, but rather an indecisive
skirmish.
While it is important to celebrate the
fact that a minority scholar, whose work is
sometimes at odds with "old school"
research, has just secured a weighty posi
tion at Stanford, the issues highlighted by
Gupta's case — student voice, the compar
atively small number of tenured women
and minorities and non-traditional scholar
ship — will re-appear soon.
In fact, expect that Sawislak's tenure
denial will bring these same issues to the
forefront of campus life again.
