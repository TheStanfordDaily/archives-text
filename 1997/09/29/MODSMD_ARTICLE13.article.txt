## The
						importance of imagination 
### 
Robert Kinnally

WHEN I TALK
with high school
students about
the process of choosing a
college, I urge them to use
their imaginations. After
students have thoroughly
researched the colleges on
their "short list," I ask

them to do one last exercise: imagine them
selves at these places — doing the work,
participating in the community life.
To this exercise they should bring a sense
of who they are at the moment and an idea
of what they would like to become.
I suggest that they ask themselves these
questions: What are the opportunities for me
at this college? What values seem to ring
through the place? Are these values in line
with my own? What can 1 bring? Will the aca
demic and social experiences challenge my
intellect, my politics, my sense of perspective?
Once they have completed this exercise,
they should have a shorter list of near-per
fect matches. This exercise is quite valuable
as students are expected to call upon this
same sense of imagination once they arrive
at college.
I have always known that a true liberal
education was one where the intellect and
the imagination were at play.
Leland Stanford spoke about the value
of imagination as he was shaping the found
ing grant of this university. He was con
vinced that the best education was one that
taught more than the skills required to do a
job well.
Stanford spoke of the need for a true stu
dent to call on his or her imagination to cre
ate something. He was certain that this kind
of creative energy was more essential and
more powerful than skill alone.

I believe this kind of energy is also trans
forming. It can challenge a stale assump
tion; it can change the world.
Now at Stanford, I am helping to shape
the University by selecting and funding the
students who will transform and be trans
formed by this amazing place. This is a
tremendous responsibility, and I don't take
it lightly.
I bring 15 years of experience, a sense of
the value of a liberal education and a love
for Stanford to the job of dean of admission
and financial aid.
But because 1 am new to the Farm, Ill be
spending a lot of time this year learning
more about the Stanford experience while
sorting through the needs of admissions and
financial aid.
I am interested in hearing from you, the
students. Tell me about your Stanford expe
rience in general — the joys and the con
cerns. Let me hear your thoughts about the
admission process and financial aid.
1 will be announcing office hours soon;
but in the meantime, please e-mail me at
kinnally@forsythe. I look forward to hear
ing from you.
As a newcomer, I can't resist the oppor
tunity to give some advice to other new
comers — especially first-year students.
My own undergraduate experience was
perhaps the most transforming experience
of my life. It was a time when I first learned
that I could play in the world of ideas and
have that experience valued by others.
I could focus on my true passions —
English literature and the French language
— and do something with the connections I
saw between my passions and subjects such
as history, music and religion.
I attended Manhattan College, a fabu
lous place that prepared me well for the

future, including admission to a Stanford
graduate program.
The classes were interesting and chal
lenging, the teaching was first-rate and the
faculty accessible. I keep in touch with some
of my former professors to this day.
But back in the late 19705, my college
was one of those places that pushed stu
dents to select a major as early as possible.
This posed a problem for me since I liked
many subjects — English. French, Spanish,
religion, music, art history — and couldn t
pick just one.
After talking with both my advisor and
the dean, 1 was sent to the psychologist who
gave me an interest inventory test.
The results indicated that I was destined
to become a dietitian or a minister and that
I should pick my major accordingly. 1 didn't
know what my major was going to be, but 1
did know that I wasn't ready for the kitchen
or the seminary!
Justice and sanity prevailed, and I was
given an extension in the beginning of my
junior year to make my selection. I used the
extra time to explore, take intellectual risks,
continue working on my passions and even
find new ones.
Stanford is a place of endless opportuni
ties. Use your time here to explore, take
intellectual risks, challenge assumptions,
find your passion and utilize Stanford's
many resources to create your unique plan
for lifelong learning. Imagine now what it
will be like, then just go for it.
One last thing. The question most-often
asked of me since I arrived: "Will you be in
Big Game Gaieties?" My answer: "I imag
ine what it will be like, and I will just go for
it — anyway."

Robert Kinnally is the new dean of A dmis
sions and Financial Aid.
