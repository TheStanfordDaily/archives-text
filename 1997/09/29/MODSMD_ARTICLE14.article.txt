ROTC's status on campus
The article in the Daily on Sept. 25
regarding ROTC overstates the issue of
ROTC courses returning to the Farm.
Stanford has had cross-enrollment agree
ments with UC-Berkeley, San Jose State
and Santa Clara University for many years,
tinder those agreements, Stanford students
take ROTC classes at those institutions and
are eligible to receive credit at those
institutions for the work they complete.
Through their participation in ROTC,
students are eligible for scholarships that
are used to pay Stanford tuition.
It is important to note that the two
courses that are currently being taught at
Stanford by the Army ROTC are Santa
Clara University courses, not Stanford Uni
versity courses.
The classes are being taught here so that
Stanford students will be able to spend less
time commuting between the two campus
es, thereby making it easier for them to
enroll in Stanford courses.
Stanford has permitted other ROTC
program-related activities to occur on cam
pus in the past, so the two Santa Clara Uni
versity courses being taught here do not
represent the dramatic departure from past
practices that is suggested in the article.

The issue of whether ROTC courses
should be permitted to be used as transfer
credit is under review. The article correctly
pointed out that at present no Army
ROTC courses have been approved for
transfer credit.

'Don't ask, don't tell'
Lt. Col. Reed tells us that the Army's
policy on gays is "something controlled by
our national political leaders."
In reality. Congress enacted the "don't
ask. don't tell, don't pursue" policy only
after senior military leaders vocally
opposed President Clinton's proposal to
end military discrimination against gays.
"Don't ask, don't tell" codified into law
long-existing military policies barring gays
and lesbians from military service.
Ignoring the "don't pursue" part of the
policy, our armed forces are continuing to
investigate service members solely to dis
cover their sexual orientation and to dis
charge them from service.
If our uniformed leaders did not whole
heartedly support discrimination against
gays and lesbians, they would end the witch
hunts and testify before Congress about

how the ban on homosexuals is forcing
them to discharge many fine soldiers,
sailors, airmen and marines.
Until they do, it's at best disingenuous
for them to claim "Congress made us do it"
as a defense.

Monopoly deserves attention
Last year Stopping Monopolies on Cam
pus (SMOC) focused much attention on the
monopolies the bookstore and Tresidder
Express hold over Stanford students.
SMOC deserves praise for its work, but
it has overlooked what may be the largest
monopoly on campus: Housing and Dining
Services.
Students should be able to choose
where to spend their food money, be it at
Safeway, the Co Ho, area restaurants or on
food provided by the dining service.
It is a colossal outrage that we are
required to pay the University thousands of
dollars year for meals we may not even want.
Why should we submit to this? Is being
ripped off for food a requirement of
attending Stanford?
