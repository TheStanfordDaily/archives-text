# ‘Party of Five' actor tells of coming out
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Mitchell Anderson, an actor the
television show "Party of Five" de
scribed his experiences coming out
as a gay man in Hollywood to a large
group of gay and lesbian alumni, stu
dents and staff this weekend.
Anderson spoke at the Stanford
Gay and Lesbian Alumni Reunion
Homecoming Dinner, now in its
fourth year, which was created to
give gay and lesbian alumni a Home
coming event in which they could
participate openly as homosexuals.
"It's nice to see all of the different
generations coming together," said
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center Adviser Troy Gilbert.
Anderson spoke after the dinner
in Lagunita Court, describing when
he first publicly revealed his homo
sexuality last year. Because the num
ber of gay actors who are willing to
discuss their homosexuality openly is
still very small, he said, he became a
kind of spokesman for the gay and
lesbian community almost
overnight.
Best known for his role as Ross on
"Party of Five," Anderson is a grad
uate of Williams College and the Jul
liard School. He also played a doctor
in "Doogie Howser, M.D." and ap
peared in the television movie, "The
Karen Carpenter Story."
Anderson talked in personal
terms about his difficulties coming
out, both to himself and to the public.
As he began to lead a gay life in pri
vate, he said, he gradually found it
more and more difficult to keep his
private and public lives separate.
As an example, he recalled at
tending the People's Choice Awards
when "Doogie Howser" was named
best new series — without his com
panion Jim.
"I had to leave him at home," An
derson said. "That hurt. That hurt a
lot."
He said that playing a gay charac
ter on "Party of Five" has been a re

warding experience for him.
"For the first time in my life I can
bring a lot of myself to the show. I
don't have to do any research," he
said.
At the same time, he made clear
that he wants and expects to play
both gay and straight roles in the fu
ture. "I want to see a world where it
just doesn't matter," Anderson said.
Before Anderson's speech, two
students spoke about their GALA
sponsored internships.
Mia Bruch, '97, worked for the
AIDS Legal Referral Panel in San
Francisco, studying the issue of
mandatory AIDS testing and report
ing, which she opposes. Sophomore
Steven Aronowitz worked for Cali
fornia State Assemblywoman Sheila
Kuehl,one of two openly gay women
serving in the state assembly.
The dinner was preceded by a re
ception, the first official function
held in the center since its renovation
this summer. Alumni and students
alike took turns poking around the
redesigned space and riding the
newly installed elevator.
Attendees meandered about the
center for two hours, alumni talking
about what it was like to be gay at
Stanford in the past and students
talking about the current scene.
"It was so dark when I was here,
and now it's so bright and cheerful!"
exclaimed one happy alumna, point
ing to the white and violet color
scheme of the center.
An alumnus who graduated in the
1960s said, "This is a different world
from when I was here, back then
there wasn't any group or anything. I
thought I was the only gay person at
Stanford."
A disabled 1980s graduate re
membered having to be carried up
the back stairs every time he wanted
to visit the center. Students enjoyed
listening to these alumni memories.
"I think the students are begin
ning to realize how wonderful it is to
have a connection to alumni,"
Gilbert said."
