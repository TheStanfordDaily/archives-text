■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 58, Oregon 49

After the smoke had settled at Stanford Stadium, the
19th-ranked Cardinal had blown past Oregon 58-49 in a
wild offensive exhibition before a crowd of 44,721.
The offensive totals for the game were staggering.
The two teams combined for 107 points, a Stanford
record. The Cardinal and the Ducks also combined for
1,108 total yards in a game in which the scoring never
seemed to stop.
Stanford (3-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) played its
best offensive game in years and one of its greatest ever.
The Cardinal's 58 points were the most scored by a Stan
ford team since 1981, when Stanford beat Oregon State
63-9. And its 578 yards of offense was also the best single
game performance for the Cardinal since that same sea
son.
All this from an offense that in the first three games of
the season averaged 24 points and 333 yards.
"Coach (Willingham) said this week our offense was
going to have a coming-out party — he was right," said

redshirt sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson.
Despite such an impressive offensive display, the vic
tory was not sealed for the Cardinal until senior defen
sive end Kailee Wong, a Eugene, Ore., native, sacked
Ducks quarterback Jason Maas for a safety with five sec
onds left, producing the game's final two points.
Oregon (3-1.1 -1) came into the game undefeated and
looking for a share of the Pae-10 lead. Instead, Stanford
used huge individual performances from several offen
sive players to abuse the Ducks' defense and gain a share
of first place in the conference for itself.
Hutchinson had a near-perfect evening, completing
21 of 31 passes for 340 yards and a career-high four
touchdowns. He was especially impressive in the first
half, w hen he tossed all four of those scores.
Hutchinson's favorite target was redshirt sophomore
flanker Troy Walters. Walters, who has been Stanford's
big playmaker all year, caught 13 passes lor 169 yards and
two touchdowns, all career highs. Damon Dunn, the
Cardinal's other dynamic receiver, caught four balls of
his own for 109 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown
bomb in the first quarter, the seventh-longest scoring
pass in Stanford history.
"Offensively we know what we're doing now," Wal
ters said. "They have some young players in their sec
ondary, so we knew that anything we ran might work."
1 ndeed, not much Stanford did offensively against the
Ducks failed, as the running game was equally proficient
