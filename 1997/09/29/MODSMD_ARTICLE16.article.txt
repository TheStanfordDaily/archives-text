■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 58, Oregon 49

After the smoke had settled at Stanford Stadium, the
19th-ranked Cardinal had blown past Oregon 58-49 in a
wild offensive exhibition before a crowd of 44,721.
The offensive totals for the game were staggering.
The two teams combined for 107 points, a Stanford
record. The Cardinal and the Ducks also combined for
1,108 total yards in a game in which the scoring never
seemed to stop.
Stanford (3-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) played its
best offensive game in years and one of its greatest ever.
The Cardinal's 58 points were the most scored by a Stan
ford team since 1981, when Stanford beat Oregon State
63-9. And its 578 yards of offense was also the best single
game performance for the Cardinal since that same sea
son.
All this from an offense that in the first three games of
the season averaged 24 points and 333 yards.
"Coach (Willingham) said this week our offense was
going to have a coming-out party — he was right," said

redshirt sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson.
Despite such an impressive offensive display, the vic
tory was not sealed for the Cardinal until senior defen
sive end Kailee Wong, a Eugene, Ore., native, sacked
Ducks quarterback Jason Maas for a safety with five sec
onds left, producing the game's final two points.
Oregon (3-1.1 -1) came into the game undefeated and
looking for a share of the Pae-10 lead. Instead, Stanford
used huge individual performances from several offen
sive players to abuse the Ducks' defense and gain a share
of first place in the conference for itself.
Hutchinson had a near-perfect evening, completing
21 of 31 passes for 340 yards and a career-high four
touchdowns. He was especially impressive in the first
half, w hen he tossed all four of those scores.
Hutchinson's favorite target was redshirt sophomore
flanker Troy Walters. Walters, who has been Stanford's
big playmaker all year, caught 13 passes lor 169 yards and
two touchdowns, all career highs. Damon Dunn, the
Cardinal's other dynamic receiver, caught four balls of
his own for 109 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown
bomb in the first quarter, the seventh-longest scoring
pass in Stanford history.
"Offensively we know what we're doing now," Wal
ters said. "They have some young players in their sec
ondary, so we knew that anything we ran might work."

as the passing attack. For the second
straight week, both senior Anthony
Bookman and senior Mike Mitchell
had more than 1 (X) yards rushing.
Bookman totaled 150 on 17 carries,
while Mitchell wore down the Ore
gon defense with 24 rushes for 1(X)
yards.
The first series of the game pro
vided a clue as to what kind of night
it would be. On its fifth play from
scrimmage, Oregon scored on a 66-
yard touchdown pass from Maas to a
wide-open Pat Johnson. Just over
two minutes into the game, Stanford
was down 7-0.
But the Cardinal struck back on
its first possession, and the tone for
the game was set. On fourth down
from the Oregon 23, Hutchinson
made an acrobatic throw while being
hit by a Duck defender. Walters ad
justed in mid-air and came down with
his first score, capping a 65-yard

drive and tying the game at 7-7.
Two plays later, junior linebacker
Donnie Spragan sacked Maas and
forced a fumble, and senior end
Bryan Werner recovered for Stan
ford on the Oregon 12. On second
down, Hutchinson found senior full
back Jon Ritchie wide open for a 14-
7 lead.
Stanford increased the margin to
21-7 on the long touchdown recep
tion by Dunn late in the first quarter,
the third straight passing attempt by
Hutchinson that went for a score.
But as was the case all game, Ore
gon did not go away easily. Minutes
into the second quarter, quarterback
Akili Smith, who rotates with Maas,
found running back Kevin Parker,
and Parker sprinted through the Car
dinal secondary 35 yards for a touch
down, making it 21-14.
Again the Cardinal struck back
instantaneously. On Stanford's next
play, Bookman broke through the
Oregon defensive line and outran
the secondary for a 67-yard touch
down. For Bookman, it was the sec
ond straight game he scored on a run

of 6()-plus yards.
Stanford further increased its lead
after Oregon back Saladin McCul
lough fumbled on Stanford's 5-yard
line and the Cardinal recovered. The
offense turned the opportunity into
another touchdown, finishing a 96-
yard drive with a 31-yard pass to
Walters that made the game 35-14.
Die Cardinal had established a sea
son-high for points scored in a game,
and it was still the first half.
It may have been the stellar per
formance of the offensive line that
was most responsible for Stanford's
offensive success. Plagued by injuries
to sophomore starter Jeff Cronsha
gen and junior backup Brian
Donoghue, sophomore Joe Fairchild
made his first-ever start at left tackle.
Fairchild and the rest of the line
opened up holes for the running
game and gave Hutchinson plenty of
time to throw. The Oregon defense
sacked Hutchinson only once the en
tire night, remarkable considering
Stanford had allowed 15 sacks in its
first three games.
"Our pass protection hadn't been

very gtxnl until tonight," said head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "When
it's good, we have a chance to throw
the ball downfield."
Oregon made it a close game at
halftime by scoring twice within
seven seconds late in the second
quarter. After a touchdown by the
Ducks made it 35-21, the ensuing
kickoff bounced off the leg of Stan
ford sophomore Emory Brock, and
Oregon recovered. On its first play.
Mass found Johnson behind the sec
ondary again for a 47-yard touch
down that sent the game to the lock
er room at 35-28.
The second half was at least
somewhat less frantic. Stanford was
helped by two field goals by much
maligned senior Kevin Miller, who
came into the game only one-of
four on field goal attempts. On the
Cardinal's first two possessions of
the second half. Miller made two 33-
yard kicks to pad Stanford's lead to
41-28.
Two crucial touchdown drives
late in the game allowed Stanford to
hold on for dear life against an Ore

gon team that kept scoring points.
On one series bridging the third and
fourth quarters, the Cardinal drove
94 yards in 8:33, capped by Book
man's 9-yard touchdown run that
made it 49-35.
Both scoring drives were domi
nated by the running of Mitchell and
Bookman. At one point, the Cardi
nal ran 15 straight running plays,
churning out 1()8 yards and wearing
down the L)ueks.
While the Oregon defense was
completely ineffective, Stanford's
did not fare much better. The Cardi
nal allowed 530 total yards, including
361 through the air. Ducks quarter
backs also burned the Stanford de
fensive backs for six touchdown pass
es.
But despite the poor defense,
Stanford's offense was thrilled fol
lowing the game. And the bottom
line for the Cardinal was that it got its
eighth win in its last nine games.
"Finally tonight we all got on the
same page," Hutchinson said.
"Knowing you're going to score
every time you get the ball is fun."
The fireworks show that preceded Saturday's home
coming game was only a warning for what was to follow
on the field.

yard kicks to pad Stanford's lead to
41-28.
Two crucial touchdown drives
late in the game allowed Stanford to
hold on for dear life against an Ore

gon team that kept scoring points.
On one series bridging the third and
fourth quarters, the Cardinal drove
94 yards in 8:33, capped by Book
man's 9-yard touchdown run that
made it 49-35.
Both scoring drives were domi
nated by the running of Mitchell and
Bookman. At one point, the Cardi
nal ran 15 straight running plays,
churning out 1()8 yards and wearing
down the L)ueks.
While the Oregon defense was
completely ineffective, Stanford's
did not fare much better. The Cardi
nal allowed 530 total yards, including
361 through the air. Ducks quarter
backs also burned the Stanford de
fensive backs for six touchdown pass
es.
But despite the poor defense,
Stanford's offense was thrilled fol
lowing the game. And the bottom
line for the Cardinal was that it got its
eighth win in its last nine games.
"Finally tonight we all got on the
same page," Hutchinson said.
"Knowing you're going to score
every time you get the ball is fun."
