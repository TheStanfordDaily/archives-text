# Cardinal play calling results in big plays

Good players can make certain coaching deci
sions look like works of pis e genius.
Stanford's wild victory over Pacific 10
Conference foe Oregon not only provided the
Cardinal faithful with the most points ever at
Stanford Stadium, it also demonstrated a few
wrinkles in the Cardinal offense.
After watching the Ducks take the Cardinal
secondary deep for a 66-yard touchdown on the
game's first possession, Stanford's offense drove
the ball deep into Oregon territory. A short run
up the middle and two incomplete passes from
Cardinal quarterback Chad Hutchinson gave
Stanford a fourth-and-8 at Oregon's 23-yard line.
Then came decision time for Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham: time to kick a field
goal or go for the first down'? Surely the coach
would go to the wide receiver screen, a play that
had worked well for the Card on several past oc

casions.
Instead, sophomore wide receiver Troy Wal
ters faked the screen, broke to the outside and
snatched a touchdown pass from Hutchinson,
bringing the homecoming crowd to its feet and
setting the tone for the game.
"I think tlu y had some young defensive backs
in there, and it was a little tough on them," Wal
ters said. "We wanted to punch it in. The defend
er had his back to me, and l just went up and made
the catch."
After capitalizing on a turnover by the Ducks,
Stanford found itself sitting on a seven point ad
vantage with the ball on its own 20-yard line. A
typical play for such an occasion would be to run
it up the middle or possibly to the outside to give
the offense some more room to maneuver.
Not this time. Hutchinson executed a perfect
play fake, freezing the defense enough to allow se
nior wide receiver Damon Dunn to break free for
an 80-yard touchdown.
Stanford fans didn't have to wait long for an

other big play.
After a lumble recovery and a seven-play
drive, the Cardinal found itself on the Ducks' 31
facing third-and inches. Normally this is when
Stanford t urns to senior power running back Mike
Mitchcll to earn a fresh set of downs.
This time, Hutchinson again went to the air
and went deep, finding Walters in the end zone for
six more points.
"1 thought our play calling was great,"
Hutchinson said. "We ran the right plays at the
right times. We had the combination of good play
calling and the players then making the plays."
In the third quarter, Stanford faced a familiar
situation: fourth-and-5 at the Oregon 2H. Al
though the Card could have opted to try a 45-yard
field goal, Willingham once again decided to keep
the offense on the field. His players proved him

er Kevin Miller barely put a 33-yard
field goal attempt over the crossbar
— well short of 45 yards.
The only fourth down that Stan
ford didn't convert occurred late in
the same period, when senior full
back Greg Cornelia was stopped for
no gain on a fake punt.
In any case, the miscue was in
consequential, as Oregon went
three-and-out on the ensuing pos
session.
"I didn't think [the play calling]
was that bold," Willingham said.
"We were willing to take some
risks. It gives your team a chance to
catapult itself forward if you con
vert."
When you have a quarterback
on his way to throwing for 340 yards
and four touchdowns, and a receiv
er who catches 13 passes for 169
yards, maybe calling their numbers
in crunch time isn't so daring after
all.
