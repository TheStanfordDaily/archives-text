■ FRIDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 1
Sacramento State 0 (OT)

After more than an hour and a half of battle, ju
nior forward A J. Sauer scored the game-winner to
give his team a 1-0 win in its first Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation match. Stanford (8-0, 1-0
MPSF) extended its two-season winning streak to
13 games.
Despite the win, the team didn't play well
against the Hornets (1-8,0-1), Sauer said.
"It was kind of a struggle for us," he said. "I'm
glad we got a win. We didn't play great, but the fact
that we did get a win was good."
Once in sudden-death overtime, "there was a
sense of urgency on our team," Sauer said. "We
wanted to get it over with as sewn as possible."

Although the Cardinal controlled the ball for
most of the game, the Hornets worked hard
enough on defense to keep the match scoreless.
Sacramento State increased the pressure in the sec
ond half, tightening up the game and forcing Stan
ford to concentrate harder.
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark said last
week that his primary concern about the match was
maintaining concentration. The first game after
classes start is always difficult, he said, and last year
the addition of academics to the players' schedules
contributed to a loss to Cal State-Northridge.
But Sauer said classes weren't the problem. "I
think we prepared ourselves well for the game," he
said. "We were pretty focused. I just think that we
didn't finish our chances off."
What resulted, he said, was "probably one of the
worst performances that we've had all year."
The C ardinal's problems got worse two minutes
before the end of regulation play when sophomore
defender Andy Hemmerich was ejected after a
scuffle with Sacramento State's Brian Jones, who
got a yellow card. Playing with only 10 men in
creased the team's desire to finish the game quick
ly, Sauer said.
The key to the win. he said, was keeping "our
discipline even when we went down to 10 men."

In the first half of the game, playing with a full
team, the Cardinal controlled the tempo. Even
with improved I lornet play in the second half,
Stanford came out of the game with more than
twice as many shots on goal as Sacramento State.
Junior midfielder Simon Elliott, a transfer and
newcomer to the team, continued to prove his
worth by accounting for six of the Cardinal's l l >
shots.
Junior defender Jamie Clark assisted Sauer on
his goal.
Stanford's defense limited the 1 lornets to only
eight shots on goal, and freshman goalkeeper
Adam Zapala continued fiercely protecting his ter
ritory. Zapala has allowed only two goals in eight
games this season.
Despite playing tight defense and controlling
most of the game offensively, the Cardinal couldn't
connect on any of its shots. "It seems like we had a
lot of chances," Sauer said, "but we couldn't finish
them off."
Clark celebrated his birthday with the win,
which also marked his 100 th career victory. As a
collegiate coach, Clark — now in his second year at
Stanford — has posted a 100-46-13 record.
The win "starts us off on the right track," Sauer
