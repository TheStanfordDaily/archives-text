In this weekend's game, all Stanford was hop
ing for was a jump-start to ignite its stalled scoring
engine and restore confidence in the Cardinal's
machinery.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Santa Clara 3
Stanford 0

Instead, the Stanford women's soccer team
dropped its fourth game in a row, a 3-0 decision to
No. 5 Santa Gara (7-0-1) in front of 1,160 rowdy
Bronco fans at Buck Shaw Stadium.
The loss dropped the No. 17 Cardinal to 3-5
and prolonged its frustrations against Santa

Clara, which hasn't lost to Stanford in the last
three seasons.
Stanford's failure to score repeated a script
that has seemed etched in stone thus far this sea
son: plenty of shots, but no goals. In its last four
games — all losses — the team has scored just a
single goal. But up until this weekend, the Card
had outshot every opponent, often by huge mar
gins.
In Saturday's loss, the team kept to its script al
most to a tee. While the Cardinal didn't outshoot
the Broncos, it at least kept pace 12-9. But as
usual, just because Stanford created plenty of
chances didn't mean that the Cardinal scored
plenty of goals.
"Finishing is something that will come," said
head coach Steve Swanson. "It's nothing that we
want to dwell on."

Santa Clara came out quickly on Saturday,
scoring on a long shot just 2 minutes, 57 seconds
into the match.
Stanford spent the rest of the first half reacting
defensively to the Broncos' aggressiveness. By the
middle of the game, Santa Clara had taken seven
shots to Stanford's one, but until the last few sec
onds. only one had found the net. ITiat changed
just before halftime.
On a throw-in with 20 seconds left in the first
half, Santa Clara's Kim Pickup somersaulted to
the line and hurled the hall 20 yards, landing it just
in front of Stanford's net and in the middle of a
crowd of Stanford defenders, Bronco forwards,
and junior Cardinal goalkeeper Erin Bryla.
What happened next, said senior midfielder
Rita Hermiz, was slop.
"It was a fumbling goal. Some
one poked it through someone
else's legs," she said.
"The goal right before halftime
really hurt," Swanson said. "If we
could've come in at halftime down
just 1-0, it would have been a differ
ent story."
After halftime, it took only 28
seconds for Santa Clara to notch its
third and final goal, as Rachel
Weber scored from 10 yards out.
"On the third goal, there was a

miscommunication on the defensive
end," Hermiz said. "It should have
been 1-0 instead of 3-0."
Stanford outplayed Santa Clara
throughout the second half — out
shooting the Broncos 8-5 — but
failed to trim the 3-0 deficit.
"We completely dominated the
second half," Hermiz said. "The
problem was that we worked our
way up to playing like that. Santa
Clara came out aggressively."
"We showed we can play with
Santa Clara. "We're a good team,
and the second half showed that."
"We fought hard when we were
down, and that's a credit to our
team," Swanson said. "But we need
ed to bring that out at the beginning.
