In this weekend's game, all Stanford was hop
ing for was a jump-start to ignite its stalled scoring
engine and restore confidence in the Cardinal's
machinery.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Santa Clara 3
Stanford 0

Instead, the Stanford women's soccer team
dropped its fourth game in a row, a 3-0 decision to
No. 5 Santa Gara (7-0-1) in front of 1,160 rowdy
Bronco fans at Buck Shaw Stadium.
The loss dropped the No. 17 Cardinal to 3-5
and prolonged its frustrations against Santa

Clara, which hasn't lost to Stanford in the last
three seasons.
Stanford's failure to score repeated a script
that has seemed etched in stone thus far this sea
son: plenty of shots, but no goals. In its last four
games — all losses — the team has scored just a
single goal. But up until this weekend, the Card
had outshot every opponent, often by huge mar
gins.
In Saturday's loss, the team kept to its script al
most to a tee. While the Cardinal didn't outshoot
the Broncos, it at least kept pace 12-9. But as
usual, just because Stanford created plenty of
chances didn't mean that the Cardinal scored
plenty of goals.
"Finishing is something that will come," said
head coach Steve Swanson. "It's nothing that we
want to dwell on."

Santa Clara came out quickly on Saturday,
scoring on a long shot just 2 minutes, 57 seconds
into the match.
Stanford spent the rest of the first half reacting
defensively to the Broncos' aggressiveness. By the
middle of the game, Santa Clara had taken seven
shots to Stanford's one, but until the last few sec
onds. only one had found the net. ITiat changed
just before halftime.
On a throw-in with 20 seconds left in the first
half, Santa Clara's Kim Pickup somersaulted to
the line and hurled the hall 20 yards, landing it just
in front of Stanford's net and in the middle of a
crowd of Stanford defenders, Bronco forwards,
and junior Cardinal goalkeeper Erin Bryla.
