■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford

snack of the Oregon schools this
weekend in two conference wins.
Oregon State was the Friday ap
petizer and even gave the Card « lit
tle bit of a push in game three before
losing 15-4, 15-2, 15-10. But Oregon
w;is mercifully devoured yesterday
in just 63 minutes, going down in
names 15-3,15-2,15-5.
On Friday, the Beavers (7-7, 1-3
Pacific 10 Conference) managed an
early 2-1 lead before Stanford (12-2,
3-0) rattled off three straight points,
culminated by sophomore outside
hitter Kerri Walsh's solo block.
Walsh, who is suffering from a shoul
der injury, looked as healthy as she
has all season and finished the match
with nine kills and nine digs.
"Hie first two games we came out
and took care of business," said se
nior middle blocker Paula Mc-
Namee. "We played at our level,
which we haven't always done."
With the lead at 8-4, Stanford fi
nally took off. Oregon State didn't
score another point, as Stanford exe
cuted its offense with tremendous
ease. The Beavers were called for a
double touch at 14-4, then lost the
game on a soft tap from McNamee
into the open court.
Game two wasn't much prettier,
as Oregon State fell behind 14-1 be
fore losing ! 5-2. Stanford senior mid
dle blocker Barbara Ifejika and se
nior co-captain and outside hitter
Kristin Folkl led the power-charged
offense. 'I"he Beavers hit a paltry .161

over the first two games while the
Card cruised to a .500 hitting per
centage.
The Card came out less sharp in
game three, as Oregon State jumped
out to 7-4 lead.
But Stanford quickly went on a 6-
1 run to take a 10-8 lead. The
Beavers knotted the game at 10-10
on a service winner, before Stanford
rattled off five unanswered points to
take the match 15-10 on a Folkl kill
that probably left a dent in the floor.
"I'm fairly happy with my hit
ting," said Folkl, who finished with a
team-high 21 kills and 14 digs. "I'm
spreading my shots out a little more,
and I hope it continues."
Yesterday's match against Ore
gon (7-7,0-4) was nothing short of a
slaughter.
Stanford led 3-2 in game one
when it ran off eight straight points.
Oregon fought back for one more

point before Folkl put a punctuation
mark on the 15-3 win with a power
ful kill.
"I feel pretty good about the way
we played," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We weren't serving this well
a couple of weeks ago."
Game two was more of the same,
with McNamee leading the potent
offense early. The Ducks spread
their two points evenly throughout
the game and even saved one game
point before falling 15-2.
"We played awesome," said se
nior setter and co-captain Lisa
Sharpley, who finished the match
with 28 assists. "You succumb to
their level sometimes when you play
weak teams, and Sunday afternoon
games can be brutal. But we played
really well."
This time the Card showed no
signs of letdown in game three,
jumping out to a 10-3 lead, then clos
ing out the match, winning the final
three points of the contest on a
Walsh service ace, a block from Ife
jika and outside hitter Debbie Lam
bert and an Ifejika kill on the slide.
