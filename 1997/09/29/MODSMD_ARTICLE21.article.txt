### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Among the thousands of alumni back on cam
pus this weekend was U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-
Mont., who spoke to a group of students about
U.S. policy toward Asia, specifically China.
The Saturday event, a public policy workshop
sponsored by Stanford In Government, brought
about 25 people to the Hoover Institution.
According to Elizabeth Pianca, co-director of
the SIG Public Policy Forum Committee, the
small workshops are designed to foster a dia
logue between students and policy makers.
Baucus, who received both an undergraduate
and a law degree from Stanford, said the United
States must create a relationship based on "lead
ership and mutual respect" with Asia, much like
it has with Europe.
Citing the growing importance of Asia, both

because of its increasing population and its po
tential for trade, Baucus spoke of Asia's in
creasing connection to the United States but
lamented the lack of a concerted focus on Asia
in Washington.
"Our country is looking across the Pacific, but
our government is not," he noted.
Baucus also decried the lack of relationship
with Asia that is as consistent as the U.S. rela
tionship with Europe.
"American foreign policy should be strate
gic and not episodic," creating a more system
atic and long-term approach on issues rather
than dealing with "crises and individual issues
like trade and human rights out of context," he
said.
Calling for a comprehensive method of deal
ing with Asia and China, Baucus said that the
United States must "update its military alliance
with Japan and set trade on a more reciprocal

basis, establish a more equal relationship with
Southeast Asia that recognizes the region's mod
ern industrial societies and create a stable coop
erative relationship with China."
Drawing on historical anecdotes and his many
recent visits to China, Baucus stressed that the
United States should not give up its principles.
"We see human rights and trade as opposed
to one another when they are actually comple
mentary," he said.
However, he warned the federal government
not to shy away from engaging China on con
tentious issues.
"Sanctions should not be used for every
thing," he said.
After his speech, Baucus entertained ques
tions from students, who probed him on issues
ranging from improving China's record on
human rights to the role of technology in Amer
ica's relationship with Asian nations.
