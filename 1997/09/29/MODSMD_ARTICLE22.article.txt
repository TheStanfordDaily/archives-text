# Software improves search efficiency
## 
### Douglas Cajas 
Imagine asking your computer to
find out what history class you can
take this quarter that meets Monday
afternoon and satisfies the general
education requirement in social sci
ences.
Your answer is just a few clicks
away with new software developed
by a Stanford computer science pro
fessor that was implemented this
fall.
Last September, the infrastruc
ture committee of the Commission
on Technology in Teaching and
Learning — which University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper has charged
with redefining the University for the
21 st century — decided to implement
Infomaster, which is designed to
meet data access needs on campus.
Asst. Computer Science Prof.
Michael Genesereth developed In
fomaster, software that can cross
reference databases to give more
exact answers to users' requests. For
example, Genesereth said, an Info
master user could type in the ques
tion, "Is John older than Anna?"
and the program would search net
worked databases and find the an
swer.
The University has two goals for
the first two years of Stanford Infor
mation Network, the World Wide
Web site that uses Infomaster tech
nology.
First, Genesereth hopes the in
formation network will be trans
formed from a "centralized organi
zation to a decentralized system," in
which each department can include
more personalized information on
the site.
The second goal is to foster a
"grassroots effort to employ the new
technology for academic purposes,"
Genesereth said. The software is
like a spreadsheet in which the user
can enter two things as different as
salary information and the periodic
table of the elements. He hopes de

partments will fully exploit the soft
ware's capabilities; for example, a
user could access data from both the
Human Genome Project and the
stock market.
Genesereth said the information
network will not have an effect on
people's lives in its current state. If
further developed, however, its im
pact will be "nothing short of revo
lutionary."
A user could search for a specific
laptop within a specific price range
at a certain location, and Infomaster
will tell the customer where to find
it.
"It will revolutionize the way we
shop," Genesereth said. He ex
plained that just as the World Wide
Web began small but later mush
roomed, so too will the Infomaster
technology
Dennis Rayer, project manager
tor Information Technology Sys
tems and Services, said he does not
expect the information network to
replace conventional information
sources such as the Stanford Bul
letin. Rather, he sees it as "a quick
way to get answers to complex ques
tions."
Rayer said the information net
work could become "the primary in
formation broker for Stanford."
Right now, the information net
work includes only six categories:
course, instructor, textbook, class
room, school and department. The
idea, however, is that more people
will view the page and send in their
input and recommendations for ad
ditional topics.
Students and faculty will "tell us
what they would like on there, and
we would be more than happy to
gather the information," said Rayer.
He said possibilities for additions to
the site include links to event listings
and student and alumni informa
tion.

work can be found at http://sin.stan
