WATER POLO
■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 14, Pacific 7

No. 7 Pacific 14-7 in the team's first home game of the
season, breaking free of its scoring slump.
The victory upped the Cardinal's season record to 5-
2, while the Tigers fell to 0-2.
Stanford seized the lead early in the first quarter
when senior defenseman Nathan Osborn launched a
two-pointer past Tiger goalie Beau Barbour on a six-on
five power play.
The Cardinal went 4-for-9on power plays during the
match, while UOP scored on 1 -of-4.
Pacific was "concentrated on the guys on the bottom
line," Osborn said. "It wasn't anything spectacular, but it
was fun to shoot."

Stanford increased the intensity in the second quar
ter, when the Cardinal netted six goals. Junior fielder Je
remiah Robison started things off by rocketing an im
pressive two-pointer into the upper left corner of the
cage, giving Robison a hat trick.
Sophomore fielder Andy Walburger, termed "the
garbage man" by Dettamanti because of his ability to op
timize rebounds, followed up with a spectacular shot that
skimmed off the water past Barbour during a skirmish in
front of the cage.
Although the Cardinal led 12-2 after three quarters,
UOP fought back in the fourth when the Cardinal sub
stituted in its second unit, tallying five points to Stan
ford's two.
"At that point in time we lost a lot of our intensity,"
Osborn said.
Dettamanti agreed. "I was a little disappointed in our
second unit," he said.
The victory, however, was summed up by junior
goalie Chris Aguilera, who tallied eight saves and six
steals in the match. "1 thought we played well," he said.
Hut the Tigers "are definitely capable of playing better
than that."
