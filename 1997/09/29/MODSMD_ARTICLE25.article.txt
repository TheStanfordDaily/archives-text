ton Keflezighi, who won the race in 24:20, a new Stan
ford Invitational record.

five. Juniors Brad and Brent Mauser finished third and
fourth with times of 24:36 and 24:37, respectively, and se
nior Jason I.unn finished fifth in 24:56.
" This was just a race to see where we're at," Nutter
said. "It's an early assessment."
Stanford sophomore Jake Maas won the men's open
with a time of 25:25, and junior Ryan McCalmon placed
third in 25:49.

the first three spots. Freshman Julia Stamps raced to vic
