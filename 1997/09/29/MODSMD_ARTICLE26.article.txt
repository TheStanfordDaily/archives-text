FIELD HOCKEY
■ SATURDAY S RESULT:
Stanford 6, Pacific 0

The Stanford field hockey
team, though, seemed to make the
best of the situation this weekend.
Led by sophomore forward Lind
sey Dunagan's three goals on
three attempts, the Cardinal shut
out Pacific 6-0 on Saturday to im
prove its record to 5-4.
"It was a good team effort,"
said coach Sheryl Johnson. "We
were getting our shots off and it
was working."
While the scoring was limited

to Dunagan, forward Monique
Leroux and defender Julie
Gwozdz, Stanford used the op
portunity to give some of the un
derclassmen more playing time.
Freshman Meg Crowley
stepped in for senior goalkeeper
Kelly Naylor in the second half
and made three saves. Freshmen
Melita Sawyer and Michelle Scott
also played well.
"A lot of freshmen played and
were very aggressive," said cap
tain Justina Williams. "The level
of play didn't come down at all."
The Cardinal has been adjust
ing to the return of Williams and
teammates Sarah Medeiros and
Carey Cloyd from the U.S. Junior
World Cup team.
"We're going through a transi
tion period now," Johnson said,
"but everybody's happy to have
them back."
