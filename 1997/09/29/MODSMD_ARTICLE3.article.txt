### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
I"he United States will continue
to play a pivotal role in global affairs
in coming years, agreed a Law
School panel convened Friday after
noon at Dinkelspiel Auditorium as
part of Homecoming Reunion
Weekend.
Titled "Changing Rivals, Chang
ing Partners: Issues of International
Diplomacy," the panel brought t(v
gether former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, Carnegie
Corp. President Emeritus David
Hamburg, Provost Condoleezza
Rice and Engineering-Economic
Systems and Operations Research
Prof. William Perry, the former sec
retary of defense Law Prof. Thomas
Heller moderated the discussion.
The end of the Cold War and the
emergence of democracy in Europe,
Asia and Latin America are the two
most profound recent changes in
global politics, argued Perry.
"These changes create a great op
portunity for U.S. foreign policy,"
he said. "The major challenge is to

advance initiatives that allow us to
seize this opportunity."
The role of the United States is to
support democracy, said Ferry, cit
ing the formation of the Marshall
Center in Germany where 60 East
ern European military officers learn
about democracy every six months.
"I believe these students are
going to be the leaders of their mili
tary in the 21st century," he added.
"The United States has special
responsibility," Christopher agreed.
"Others will follow if we lead; if we
don't lead, it won't get done."
Rice warned against the poten
tial dangers of U.S. attempts to re
solve foreign conflicts.
"We tried state-building once
under difficult circumstances," she
said. "It was called Vietnam."
1 iowever important U.S. leader
ship will he to maintaining order, the
panel agreed that multilateral
peacekeeping will continue to
emerge as a trend.
Peacekeeping forces during the
conflict in Bosnia consisted of sol

diers from NATO nations plus 16
other countries including Russia,
said Perry.
I"he cooperation among NATO
and non-NATO countries was "a
stunning development that could
not have been contemplated a few
years ago," he added.
Multilateral peacekeeping is not
without faults, added the panelists.
Hamburg cited the massacres in
Rwanda that claimed a million lives
and that he said could have been pre

vented with a timely infusion of
5,000 troops as an example of the dif
ficulty of mobilizing resources under
multilateral peacekeeping.
I"he panel also considered the im
pact of N ATO expansion on t he suc
cess of Russia's transition to democ
racy.
"The trajectory for Russia is pret
ty good," said Rice. "NA TO expan
sion is not likely to threaten Russia's
democracy."
"Anybody who visits Moscow or
St. Petersburg will be impressed how
robust small businesses are," con
curred Perry. "Russia's participation
in Bosnia proved both to NATO and

Russia that they can work together
as partners."
The discussion then turned to
Asia and specifically to U.S. foreign
policy toward China.
"China has the greatest potential
of becoming our adversary in the
next few decades," said Christopher.
To avoid this conflict, the United
States must remain firm and pre
pared by maintaining troops in Asia,
he said.
Christopher also stressed the im
portance of staying engaged with
China by keeping an open channel
of communication about the issues
the two countries have in common.

such as the environment, nuclear
nonproliferation, narcotics and
trade.
The alternative to engaging
China will be a costly containment,
agreed Perry.
"If China becomes a threat, we
would have to increase our de
fense budget by $100 billion a
year," he added. "Even in the De
fense Department, that's real
money."
The panelists predicted that U.S.
leadership in dealing with global is
sues such as the environment and
weapons of mass destruction will
continue to be crucial.
