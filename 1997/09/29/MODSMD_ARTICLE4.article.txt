# Grad student issues surveyed
## Housing and parking listed as two biggest concerns 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
The results of a comprehensive survey compiled by
the ASSIJ Committee on Academics, Research and
Evaluation reveal that housing and parking are the is
sues of greatest concern to graduate students.
The survey, organized by former committee chair
Doug Natelson, a doctoral student in physics, was bro
ken down into three main areas: academic issues, de
partmental issues and community issues.
In addition to housing and parking problems, survey
respondents mentioned some problems that "can fixed
in a relatively simple way," Natelson said, such as "ad
ministrative problems at the Bursar'sand Registrar's of
fices."
Nearly 6(H) students responded to the survey, which
represents about H percent of the total graduate student
population. About half of the respondents were engi
neering students, making other schools underrepresent
ed.
The issues addressed ranged from the adviser system
to time required to receive a degree to the quality of
coursework. Students in the schools of Engineering and
1 iumanities and Sciences Ux)k an average of six or more
years to earn a doctoral degree, while others took less
time.
The methods of selecting advisers vary widely be
tween departments, so responses to the quality of advis
er systems also varied, Natelson said.
One thing the survey revealed is that many law stu
dents want advisers. While many graduate students
were content with their advisers, some expressed deep
dissatisfaction.

"I have never heard of an instance in my department
in which a faculty member expressed explicit interest in
taking part in the dissertation of a specific student,"
wrote one graduate student. "They seem to avoid work
as much as possible; some of my peers feel like they are
imposing when they ask for basic involvement."
Another set of questions focused on issues of fund
ing, workload and teaching. Only 4 percent of students
in the humanities found their pay adequate, although in
other departments as many as 20 percent were content
with their pay. Many said the tight local housing market
