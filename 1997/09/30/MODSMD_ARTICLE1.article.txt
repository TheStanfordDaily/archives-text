## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
Michael Moore, the author and
documentary filmmaker who has
made a career of confronting corpo
rations, said last night he hoped no
Stanford students would end up as
one of the CEOs he pursues.
Moore's film "Roger and Me,"
which chronicled Moore's attempts
to meet with General Motors CEO
Roger Smith to discuss CI M's lay-offs
of hundreds of workers in Moore's
hometown of Flint, won critical ac
claim in 1989.
Moore spoke to a full house last
night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
after a showing of Moore's new
movie, "The Big One," which will he
released in February.
The documentary, which follows
Moore on his current nation-wide
book tour for his recent book
"Downsize This: Random Threats
from an Unarmed American," main
ly focuses on Moore's activities when
he's not signing books.
Moore, continuing in the "Roger
and Me" vein, visits corporations in
each city he travels to, presenting a
certificate of achievement for
"Downsizer of the Year" to corpora-
tions who have recently shut down
plants and laid off workers.
According to Moore, these layoffs
are occurring even as corporate prof
its are skyrocketing. Iliis Mtx>re says,
is "economic terrorism" against
American workers.
With the cameras running at all
times, Moore attempts on film to also
present the Johnson Controls corpo
ration, which shut down a large Mil
waukee plant in order to move to
Mexico, with a check for $.K() to "pay

the first Mexican worker for their first
hour of work," said.
The documentary also shows
Moore's interactions with laid-off
workers throughout the country.
Moore advises Borders bookstore
workers in Des Moines, lowa, to join
a union, accompanies one laid-off
worker in Milwaukee to a temporary
employment agency and hugs one
weeping woman in Rockford, 111. who
was laid off from her job at a car deal
ership earlier that day.
The most popular segment in the
documentary among last night's au
dience, however, was his visit to Nike
CEO Philip Knight, a Stanford alum

nus. Knight, who is named as Moore's
third favorite "corporate crook" in
"Downsize This," was the only CEO
who agreed to meet with Moore.
Nike's alleged use of child labor
from Indonesia to make their athletic
shoes was protested at Stanford last
spring, when Knight spoke on cam
pus.
According to Moore, Knight is
"very worried" about the movie's re
lease, and since the filming has raised
the minimum age of child workers at
Nike factories from 14- to 16-years
old.
In the question and answer session
after the screening, Moore greeted

the audience with typical deadpan
humor.
"$3(),(X)0 a year? Do you know
how many movies you could make?"
Moore asked, referring to Stanford's
annual tuition fees.
However, Moore emphasized the
importance of political involvement
among Stanford students.
When asked "has your work made
a change in corporate America?"
Moore replied "No, it has not done
anything."
"It only changes when you come
out of this auditorium and become po
litically involved," Moore said. "Until
then, they just think I'm a joke boy."
