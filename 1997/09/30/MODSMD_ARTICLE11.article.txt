## AIDS drugs failing to work 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — Widely heralded new AIDS
treatments that seemed to stop; the virus' advance and
revive patients from near death are now beginning to fail
in about half of all those treated, doctors said yesterday.
The disappointing reports suggest the tough virus is
coming back after being knocked briefly into submis
sion, just as many experts feared it would.
"Over the past year, we had a honeymoon period,"
said Dr. Steven Deeks. " The epidemic will likely split in
two, and for half the people we will need new therapeu
tic options."
Deeks presented data from the UC-San Francis
co's public AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hos
pital.
Prescriptions of so-called three-drug cocktails — two
older AIDS drugs plus one of the new class of medicines
called protease inhibitors — have clearly revolutionized
AIDS care. In many places, more than 90 percent of
AIDS patients are taking these combinations, and typi
cally people start on them as soon as they learn they are
infected, even before they get sick.
Patients whose disease-fighting I cells were ravaged
by HIV have gotten out of bed and even gone back to
work. However, many worried from the start that the
virus would eventually grow resistant to the protease
inhibitors and resume its insidious destruction.
The latest data, presented yesterday at an infectious
disease conference sponsored by the American Society of
Microbiology, suggests this is indeed happening regularly.
Deeks and colleagues reviewed the records of 136
HIV-infected people who started on protease inhibitors
in March 1996, when Crixivan and Norvir, the first two
powerful protease inhibitors, came on the market.
Most patients responded dramatically. Their virus
levels dropped so low they could not be found on stan
dard tests. Rut since then, the virus has returned to
detectable levels in 53 percent.
Although this is ominous, no one knows exactly what
it means.
