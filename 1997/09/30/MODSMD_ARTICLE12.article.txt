South Africa investigates past inequalities
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission approaches a midnight deadline
today for those seeking amnesty for crimes committed during
apartheid.
Created as a way to investigate the past without sowing new dis
cord, the panel's successes seem greater than its failures in a nation
still trying to comprehend what happened under apartheid.
From army generals to ragged guerrillas, more than 7,(MH) South
Africans have petitioned the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
for amnesty since its creation two years ago.
Their testimony on killings, torture and other atrocities has shed
light on some of the horrors wrought by more than three decades of
white minority rule — although others remain veiled and after today,
may never he known.
So far, some notable figures, including Winnie Madikizela-Man
dela, the former wife of South African President Nelson Mandela,
have refused to apply for amnesty for past political crimes.
Doctor-assisted suicide to be reconsidered
SALF.M, Ore. (AP) — 'ITiree years after approving the nation's
first and only law allowing doctor-assisted suicide, Oregon voters are
being asked to reconsider.
The law has never taken effect because of legal challenges and will
probably remain stalled for months even if it survives.
The Legislature voted earlier this year to hold a referendum Nov.
4 on whether to repeal the law.
The referendum puts Oregon back at the forefront of the national
debate over whether people suffering from painful, fatal illnesses
should have the legal right to end their lives.
