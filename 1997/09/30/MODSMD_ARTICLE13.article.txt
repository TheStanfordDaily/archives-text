COLIN A, Chile (AP) A fite swept
through a home for retarded children in a
northern Santiago suburb early yesterday,
killing 30 residents, including several who
didn't recognize the danger and walked
back into the burning building after being
rescued.
Three children and one firefighter
were injured. Authorities took 134 sin -
vivors to a nearby school.
An electrical short circuit caused the
fire, according to a preliminary report by
the fire department. Residents' relatives
complained that the facility was in disre
pair and understaffed.
Some youngsters suffocated when they
walked back into the building.
"Apparently, some children thought it
was some kind of a game, I don't know,
but firemen said it happened several
times," said Ciuillermo Vidal, vice presi
dent of C'oanil, the private foundation that
administered the home.
Isabel Patino, another Coanil official,
said the children appeared to be attracted
by the fire and "totally lacked the notion
of danger." It was not clear why the adults
on hand were unable to keep the children
away from the fire.
Ms. Patino said all the victims were
retarded people, aged 6 to 40, though
most were children. While the home was
established for retaided childien, it also
housed some adults.
Ms. Patino described the degree of
retardation of the victims as ranging
"from severe to extreme.. that was one
reason for the high number of victims."
She said virtually all the residents took

medication "undei medical supervision"
hut added "that doesn't mean tliev were
drugged."
I he II) year old hiiek building is in the
eountivside outside ( olina, a suhuih just
north of Santiago.
1 uis I'aredes, whose son sutvived the
fire, complained that the home was badly
in need of repair and lacked the most
hasic lire safety feattues. It was not imme
diately cleai il the home had spiinklcis.
Other relatives complained that the
home was undeisiafled dining the night.
I hey said only seven people weie in
charge when the fire hioke out.
Vidal said since some patients sulieied
from both mental and physical disabilities,
it would have required "one person per
patient" foi a complete evacuation.
"It was impossible to icscue more chil
dren, especially those who were immo
bile," said one of the home officials, who
identified himself only as Nat ho.

minutes but "there wasn't much they
