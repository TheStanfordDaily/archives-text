# Gingrich and Clinton dispute over taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AT) I lie
Clinton administration hardened
its opposition yesterday to a bipar
tisan plan to revamp the embattled
IKS, saying the proposal was "a
recipe for conflicts of interest, less
accountability and less tr list."
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
quickly called on President < linton
to repudiate the statement.
II not, (Jingrich told ('linton in a
letter, "you will have allied yourself
with the IKS' bureaucratic machine
and turned your back on the mil
lions of Americans who have been
pulled through its gears."
"Clearly, the IKS is out of con
trol and needs to be reformed," the
Georgia Republican said.
Spurred by congressional test i -
mony last week asserting IKS
harassment and abuse of taxpayers,
Republican congressional leaders
pledged to pass legislation this year
to rein in the agency.
Sponsored by Sen. Hob Keriey,
I) Neb., and Rep. Rob Portman,
R Ohio, the plan calls for a nine
member oversight hoard of private

citizens to develop the IKS' bud
get and strategic long-term plan
ning.
This bill enjoys bipartisan sup
port in the I louse and Senate, and is
being championed by House
Republicans as the main IRS
rest ruct uring pr oposal.
In a counterproposal, the Trea
sury Department calls for an over
sight board of executive branch offi
cials. Republicans oppose the
administration plan as putting
potential political influence over
the agency.
Gene Sperling, the senior White
House economic adviser, said the
White House was appalled by last
week's stories of IRS misconduct.
But he said the oversight board pro
posed in the Kerrcy-Portman bill
was "extremely misguided."
It would be inadvisable, he said,
to have "part-time managers who
would be themselves involved in a
range of financial transactions."
As for IRS abuses, Sperling said
there are going to be disturbing
cases in any big organization.
