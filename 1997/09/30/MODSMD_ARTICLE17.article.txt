## Housing mess inexcusable 
### 
Although the 230 under
graduates left unassigned after
the housing draw last May were
promised to be informed of their guaran
teed housing assignments by the end of
•July, more than HO students had to wait
•Jintil last Wednesday to walk onto the last
• (ew housing spots available on campus.
** Such a scenario should not be repeated
!hi the future.
While we recognize the fact that all stu
"dents who were guaranteed housing and
'had checked the"I will live anywhere on
box did get a room, we are disap
pointed by the fact that this was not han
- pled in the most timely manner.
• * ()n-campus housing is a mess. First of
:>n, promising students housing and then
them wait until the night after the
'first day of classes to provide it is a prob
lem that leaves students frustrated with
*4he Draw and with the University. It is
'unfair to make students to deal with the
'hassles of moving in after classes have
'Commenced.
: : If assignment services can't provide
•Jiousing by at least the first day of school,
Then the I Iniversity shouldn't guarantee it.
In trying to combat this fall's housing
crunch, Housing Assignment Services
played room-arrangement acrobatics, con
verting previously unimaginable locations
into dorm rooms.
• Study rooms in dormitories were con
certed into singles and doubles. Residen
tial staff in Branner had to convert many
of the singles into doubles. Students were
assigned, at least temporarily, to the guest
rooms in Elliot Program Center. Rooms
normally occupied by males were given to
women when necessary, and vice versa.

The loss of study room space, the cram
ming of extra people into rooms and
upsetting the gender balance will
undoubtedly decrease the quality of stu
dent life.
Wait-listed students who were not
assigned during the summer were forced
to improvise for the few lirst days follow
ing their return to campus Many of them
had few options other than crashing in the
dorm rooms of friends or living out of
their cars. Because their housing had been
guaranteed by the University, these stu
dents were reluctant to seek out the
expensive housing available in the Palo
Alto area.
Part of reason for the problem is the
Palo Alto housing market that currently
has less than a 3 percent vacancy rate. Stu
dents do not have the luxury of quickly
being able to find an inexpensive apart
ment. If students do find an apartment that
meets their budget, there are often 10 other
students hoping to snag the spot as well.
The University is trying to ease situa
tion — two graduate residences have been
built in the last year, and spaces in co-ops
that were being filled by graduate students
have been given to undergraduates.
Stanford undergraduates will be okay
this quarter. But this fall's housing assign
ments cut too close for comfort. After the
walk-on, not a single vacancy was left for
men and a meager 14 slots are still avail
able for women.
If housing is such a problem, perhaps
time has come for the University to stop
guaranteed housing for undergraduates.
There's nothing admirable in unfulfilled
promises, and the housing problem will
only get worse.
