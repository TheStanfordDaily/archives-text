## Chipping away at monolitic thinking 
### 
Ann Porteus

How many times in
a given day do we
hear or use the
terms "THE University,"
"THE administration" or
"THE students"? Some
times such generalizations
serve a constructive pur
pose, and often they

don't; they are the result of monolithic
thinking that almost always oversimplifies
the rich complexities of University life; they
are based on unexamined assumptions and
stereotypes that prevent us from interacting
and communicating as real people about
complex issues.
"Res Ed" is another such term.
If not a monolith, then what is Residen
tial Education? Res Ed is at once a philoso
phy, a program and an office of student
affairs.
Res Ed is a diverse system of undergrad
uate housing providing students with an
array of educational settings — large, small,
theme, focus, student-managed, coopera
tive, apartments, suites, all freshmen, four
class and upper-class houses.
The residence and program support staff
is as diverse as the types of houses — RFs,
RAs, RCCs, 1 I As. A I As, I As, HAAs,
AAs, PHEs, RTs, RSASs, RDs, etc. The
most important part of Res Ed is the almost
65(H) students who choose to live in the
undergraduate residential system.
A monolith we are not — agreement
about anything is impossible!
So what is Res Ed about? Res Ed is
about the education of the whole person.

and it is about building healthy learning
communities. It entails supporting students'
academic progress as well as their intellec
tual, cultural, personal, social, spiritual,
emotional and physical development.
Res Ed is a collection of people — facul
ty, staff and students — engaged in a con
scious and deliberate process of learning
and community building. Community is the
foundation of the work in the residences
and is strongly linked with students' aca
demic success and achievement of responsi
ble citizenship.
The goal is to build pluralistic commu
nities where each student feels included,
where the environment is characterized by
mutual concern, empathy, the active
exchange of views and the freedom to differ
intellectually, culturally and politically.
The goal is to build intellectual commu
nities where critical thinking, risk taking,
experimentation, creativity and exploration
and free exchange of ideas are nurtured and
supported.
The goal is to build learning communi
ties where students teach and learn from
each other, where individuals and the whole
community grow as a result of consciously
attending to important issues.
The goal is to build reflective communi
ties where residents as individuals and com
munal groups take time to reflect on their
experiences, to examine assumptions and
norms, to question themselves and their
ideas.
The goal is to build responsible commu
nities where respect for self, others, the
house and the larger community is the

norm, where responsible decision-making is
fostered, and where students are held
accountable for their actions.
And the goal is to have FUN — to be a
little crazy, to do some mindless, but not
thoughtless things and to laugh a lot.
Res F.d is a proactive and reactive, for
ward-looking and reflective process. The
role of the residence staff is deliberate — to
watch for events (local, national or interna
tional) and consciously to turn them into
opportunities for social learning and for
intellectual and personal growth.
We try to cultivate comfortable (not con
flict-free), safe and non-graded environ
ments where students can discuss cultural
and social assumptions in order to enrich
and (reconstruct their social and intellectu
al identities.
We seek to create private spaces as well
as community spaces where students can
feel safe to do the things they like to do. We
seek to engage and involve residents in
every aspect of community building.
So how does this happen? Res Ed is
decentralized and dynamic. Though we
operate with some guiding principles, we
watch each residential community construct
its own soul and identity.
Each year residences are formed anew
and community is rebuilt by the dynamic
that arises from different people living
together, sharing their personal stories and
bringing iheir ideas and experiences to
bear.
