## Chipping away at monolitic thinking 
### 
Ann Porteus

How many times in
a given day do we
hear or use the
terms "THE University,"
"THE administration" or
"THE students"? Some
times such generalizations
serve a constructive pur
pose, and often they

don't; they are the result of monolithic
thinking that almost always oversimplifies
the rich complexities of University life; they
are based on unexamined assumptions and
stereotypes that prevent us from interacting
and communicating as real people about
complex issues.
"Res Ed" is another such term.
If not a monolith, then what is Residen
tial Education? Res Ed is at once a philoso
phy, a program and an office of student
affairs.
Res Ed is a diverse system of undergrad
uate housing providing students with an
array of educational settings — large, small,
theme, focus, student-managed, coopera
tive, apartments, suites, all freshmen, four
class and upper-class houses.
The residence and program support staff
is as diverse as the types of houses — RFs,
RAs, RCCs, 1 I As. A I As, I As, HAAs,
AAs, PHEs, RTs, RSASs, RDs, etc. The
most important part of Res Ed is the almost
65(H) students who choose to live in the
undergraduate residential system.
A monolith we are not — agreement
about anything is impossible!
So what is Res Ed about? Res Ed is
about the education of the whole person.

and it is about building healthy learning
communities. It entails supporting students'
academic progress as well as their intellec
tual, cultural, personal, social, spiritual,
emotional and physical development.
Res Ed is a collection of people — facul
ty, staff and students — engaged in a con
scious and deliberate process of learning
and community building. Community is the
foundation of the work in the residences
and is strongly linked with students' aca
demic success and achievement of responsi
ble citizenship.
The goal is to build pluralistic commu
nities where each student feels included,
where the environment is characterized by
mutual concern, empathy, the active
exchange of views and the freedom to differ
intellectually, culturally and politically.
The goal is to build intellectual commu
nities where critical thinking, risk taking,
experimentation, creativity and exploration
and free exchange of ideas are nurtured and
supported.
The goal is to build learning communi
ties where students teach and learn from
each other, where individuals and the whole
community grow as a result of consciously
attending to important issues.
The goal is to build reflective communi
ties where residents as individuals and com
munal groups take time to reflect on their
experiences, to examine assumptions and
norms, to question themselves and their
ideas.
The goal is to build responsible commu
nities where respect for self, others, the
house and the larger community is the

norm, where responsible decision-making is
fostered, and where students are held
accountable for their actions.
And the goal is to have FUN — to be a
little crazy, to do some mindless, but not
thoughtless things and to laugh a lot.
Res F.d is a proactive and reactive, for
ward-looking and reflective process. The
role of the residence staff is deliberate — to
watch for events (local, national or interna
tional) and consciously to turn them into
opportunities for social learning and for
intellectual and personal growth.
We try to cultivate comfortable (not con
flict-free), safe and non-graded environ
ments where students can discuss cultural
and social assumptions in order to enrich
and (reconstruct their social and intellectu
al identities.
We seek to create private spaces as well
as community spaces where students can
feel safe to do the things they like to do. We
seek to engage and involve residents in
every aspect of community building.
So how does this happen? Res Ed is
decentralized and dynamic. Though we
operate with some guiding principles, we
watch each residential community construct
its own soul and identity.
Each year residences are formed anew
and community is rebuilt by the dynamic
that arises from different people living
together, sharing their personal stories and
bringing iheir ideas and experiences to
bear.
The building of learning communities

happens through careful planning, through
serendipity and through sheer luck. It is
magical and powerful when it works, and it
is painful and clumsy when it doesn't. It
happens in a variety of ways — as many
ways as there are good ideas, and people
willing to act on those ideas.

Does it all work? In many ways, yes. In
some ways, no.
Do we have an "agenda"? Yes — human
rights, learning, reflection and supporting
students' academic progress and success.
Can students escape "Res F.d"? No
because students living in undergraduate
residences are part of Residential Educa
tion.
Is there a "canned" curriculum for our
houses? Most certainly not; it is up to each
house — staff and residents — to decide

what "programming" and community
development activities will take place.
Does it get "crammed down people's
throats"? Sometimes — by ovei zealous
staff members. Do voices get cut off? Some
times — when people don't listen to opin
ions, ideas or beliefs they don't share.
Do we interfere with academic progress?
1 don't think so, but some students do get
side-tracked by some very interesting non
curricular alternatives as they pursue a
broad personal education.

Do we "hand hold" too much? Perhaps
once in a while, but mostly we support stu
dents in finding their own way.
My challenge to you is that the next
time you make or hear generalizations
about "Res Ed" take time to look more
closely. Is the generalization based on an
anecdote, on the experience of one or two
individuals, on hearsay, on personal expe
rience, on an act by a single staff member,
on rumor, on a single event in a single res
idence, etc.?

As Gerhard Casper advised incoming
students a few years back, "think critically,"
and "search not just for the evidence, but
for the counter evidence as well."
Most importantly, 1 invite you — stu
dents, faculty and staff — to personally
invest in (his incredible ever-adapting,
multi-faceted residential experience. The
possibilities are endless, and we will all be
the richer as a result.
