SMOC is working with dining services
As president of Students Monitoring Organizations
on Campus (SMOC), I would like to respond to Greg
Walton's letter stating that SMOC has overlooked
"what may be the largest monopoly on campus: Hous
ing and Dining Services."
In truth, SMOC members have been working with
dining services for over a year and a half.
Beginning spring quarter in 19% and extending
through much of last year, 1 served on the Housing
and Dining Services Internal Review Committee. This
committee conducted a financial and operating review
of dining services.
Committee recommendations are highlighted in a
May 21 Daily article. These recommendations include:
1) holding the growth of the cost of room and board to
no more than inflation, while simultaneously renovat
ing residences through the C apital Improvements Pro
gram; 2) adding a smaller meal plan, possibly 10 meals
per week; 3) insuring student representation in decid
ing the fate of the eating clubs when Toyon is renovat
ed; 4) reducing guest meal charges so it's easier for fac

ulty to visit dining halls; and 5) pricing prepackaged
items such as Snapple closer to market value.
I hope this clarifies that we have been examining
the dining issue. SMOC appreciates student support
for our bookstore projects, and students can look for
ward to many new and exciting SMOC service projects
this year.

Cancellation of Big Game bonfire
in Lake Lagunita denounced
It is ridiculous that a "species of special concern"
is causing the cancellation of the Big Game bonfire.
At least the lack of a bonfire during my first three
years on the Farm was due to fire hazard, a threat
that anyone who has lived in California can under
stand.
ITiis is not the same as the spotted owl. Hie spotted
owl is endangered, while the tiger salamander is not.
Cutting down trees would permanently damage the
spotted owl's habitat, while a one-night bonfire would

not do anywhere near the same level of harm to the
shores of I ake Lagunita.
Although 1 admit I have not seen the evidence, I
sincerely question how a fire in the lake bed will so
adversely affect the tiger salamanders living on the
banks. The heat felt on the banks nearest to the fire is
no greater than that which would be felt on a 100-
degree summer day. Additionally, the bonfire's heat
will last far less than a full day.
I also question the extent to which efforts to accom
modate this not-even-endangered species have been
investigated and pursued. Would it not be enough to
capture a few dozen on the banks near the bonfire and
transplant them across the lake bed to the banks far
ther away from the fire?
Or perhaps spray hoses or drip irrigation could be
rigged to soak the banks where the salamanders live
to keep them sufficiently wet and cool?
While it is clear that we simply cannot ignore the
presence of other species in our environment, it seems
as though efforts to accommodate the long-standing
tradition of the bonfire have been either misdirected,
inadequate or both.

Former Stanford president Donald Kennedy
repeatedly told my class to "question authority." Per
haps the student body has become complacent in the
last 10 years and is willing to accept the decisions of
someone else's "most recent study" without trying to
find solutions itself.
It is my sincere hope that this misguided deci
sion can be reverse in time to honor a decades-old
tradition that is one of the cornerstones of Big
Game weekend, particularly on Big Game'slOOth
anniversary.
