## Liver, onions, bikers and the lessons derived from pain 
### 
Kelly Young

As a child, I hated liver and onions,
even though my mother insisted on
fixing it. I hated the smell, the color
and especially the taste of the slimy pieces of
meat. However, early on, I devised a strategy
to cope with my angst â€” I pretended to like
everything I hated.
The instant I smelled the stench of liver
and onions emanating from the kitchen, I
would shout, "Woo-hoo! Liver! We're hav
ing liver! I LOVE L-I-V-E-R!"
I would then manage to choke it down
with a smile on my face. It was painful, but it
worked. If nothing else, I received an ample
supply of iron.
As I grew older, 1 adopted this bizarre
strategy for every difficult or unpleasant task
that lay ahead of me. Dealing with a poten
tially painful situation with a smile or a laugh
made the painless situations seem like heav
en.
But somehow, somewhere my plan took
a turn for the worst. In my course of devel
opment, I came to truly enjoy pain. My liver
smile was no longer fake. Pain represented
an obstacle to overcome. Excluding long

term insanity, a love for pain is the only
thing that can explain my later years.
Why else would I intentionally run five
miles with bronchitis and knees which
popped every step 1 took? Why else would
I work all day in cornfields where ther
mometers registered 110 degrees in the
shade? And why else would 1 study in
Moscow, a city which is as stable as... well..
. a ruble?
I knew that living in Moscow would not
be the easiest thing I'd ever done, so 1 decid
ed to approach it with the same twisted opti
mism I had displayed while scarfing down
liver.
Enter the trip to Moscow via Western
Europe.
My parents accompanied me, trying to
show me what a wonderful quarter 1 was
missing by studying in Moscow instead of
Berlin. They just don't know a good
masochist when they see one.
On the first day of our trip, 1 missed my
one big opportunity for pain by three feet.
As we were walking near Amsterdam's
Dam Square, 1 crossed the street to avoid

three swaggering drunk Dutchmen. My
father followed, but my mother didn't.
Suddenly, I heard men shouting and tires
screeching. I spun around to find my mother
lying in the street with a man and his bike on
top of her. Vicarious pain! Her sole pair of
glasses were scratched, and her chin quickly
swelled to the size and color of a grape. As
she started to cry, she managed a laugh and
said, "At least it wasn't a car."'
That's my mom, the eternal optimist.
While Europe was exciting, 1 was anxious
to experience Moscow and its supposed
pain. 1 was tired of being a bystander; I
wanted to be the one with treadmarks across
my face.
After a teary-eyed gixxl bye with my par
ents at the Berlin airport, I was ready for my
first taste of Moscow. And I got it, while still
on the airplane. I struggled through the Cyril
lie customs form with only the assistance of
my ptx'ket dictionary. That took up most of
the three-houi flight from Berlin. Pain!
After landing, 1 wandered around
Sheremetyevo II airport for half an hour
looking for a Stanford representative. All

the while, men were shouting in my face,
"Otkooda'lV and "Taksi?!" Ah, pain!
Unfortunately, my joy was brought to an
abrupt halt when 1 spotted the center's
director.
When we reached my apartment, I was
ecstatic to find my host parents neither
spoke nor understood English. Convenient
ly enough, 1 knew very little Russian. Pain!
About that time, their 11-year-old daughter,
Natasha, walked through the door. Natasha
happens to be fluent in English.
Even with four layers of clothes on, I was
shivering in my apartment. However, my
host mother, Lyuba, informed me the city
would not be turning on the heat until Octo
ber. Pain! I hen, I realized that October was
only a few days away.
So far, my pain in Moscow just doesn't
seem to be as long-lasting as I would like. I
may resort to looking outside my home for
pain. In fact, I could simply stand in the tiny
road running alongside my apartment.
Oncoming cars will not stop. I'hey won't
even swerve. I am but a piece of road kill to
them. Pain!

If the real world proves to be tin) pleas
ant, 1 could always go underground. No, not
the Metro. That's for the Muscovite sissies.
I'm talking about spelunking below the
Metro. An extensive network of tunnels are
rumored to extend 15 levels deep and house
rats, drug dealers and the occasional black
magician. I lowever, this is only a back-up
plan.
And now, a few words from my mother:
"Moscow?! Kelly, why don't you apply to
Berlin?"
Oh. . . sorry.. . awkward moment.. .
wrong one. What about this one: "What
doesn't kill us, makes us stronger."
Yeah, Mom, tell that to the Dutch biker.
life in Moscow is much different than
the cozy, posh life at Stanford. Every day is
a new struggle, and that's why 1 love it.
Choking down the liver as a kid may have
initially brought tears to my eyes, but dessert
always seemed a little sweeter.
