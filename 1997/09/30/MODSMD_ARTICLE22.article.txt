# SEAS lauds Texaco decision
## Oil giant sells natural gas investments to British company

After years of protesting the dictatorial government
of Burma, Students for Environmental Action at Stan
ford is now celebrating what it calls another step toward
the country's liberation: Texaco has terminated its
Burmese operations.
Texaco sold its coastal natural gas investments to
Premier Oil of Britain Thursday following a decision in
April by President Clinton to bar new investment in mil
itary-ruled Burma in the interest of human rights,
democracy and environmental protection.
"It's a victory for the [United States] and a good mes
sage to Unocal and Arco," other petroleum companies
that still have major investments in Burma, said junior
Lauren O'Brien, SEAS coordinator.
"Who ever really thought that one of the big oil gi
ants would just pull out like that? What a victory for the
Free Burma Coalition." said Jill Shenker, SEAS coordi
nator, in a statement.
SEAS is an environmental justice group that has
been working against corporate involvement in Burma.
Burma's junta, the State Law and Order Restoration
Council, has been condemned by Secretary of State
Madeline Albright as a "flagrant human rights abuser."

SLORC has a right to a 15 percent stake in the gas
project, and multinational oil company investment in
Burma provides the largest legal source of foreign cur
rency to the regime, according to SEAS.
"The Burma issue involves human rights and envi
ronmental destruction, power struggle, corporate
power and misbehavior," said O'Brien. "SEAS was
originally involved, before I came to Stanford, in work
ing with the University to divest from Texaco."
SEAS had been working with the University's Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsibility to divest
from Burma. The committee came to the decision to try
to influence the corporations instead of withdrawing
their investments, said O'Brien.
Working with other national groups such as the Free
Burma Coalition, SEAS in the past has protested at the
corporate headquarters of Texaco and ARCO.
"The ultimate goal is to have a democratic and free
Burma," said O'Brien.
Last night, SEAS hosted a teach-in after its first
meeting of the year to educate participants about condi
tions in Burma. Dan Orzech, a (Kumar will find out who
this guy is), spoke about the history of Burma, current is
sues and work to liberate Burma in California and the
nation.
