# SSE expanding intern program
## 
### Margaret Lange 
Stanford Student Enterprises, the business side of
the ASSU, plans to expand its internship program this
year.
One of Stanford's largest employers, SSE was known
until last spring as the ASSU Business Projects. Since
then it has become an autonomous entity, although it
still provides the revenue used to run ASSU.
Freshmen generally do not work as paid employees
for SSE. However, SSE gives freshmen and transfer stu
dents priority when choosing people to fill its internship
positions. Last year, six students became interns for
SSE. This fall, SSE will choose 10 interns.
SSE runs familiar programs on campus such as Sun
day Flicks. It is also responsible for directing ventures
such as the Stanford Directory and the Stanford Store.
Sophomore Nic Esparza, internship program direc

tor, pointed out the importance of an organization such
as SSE in an aspiring businessperson's education.
"We're giving students a chance to get hands-on
business experience," he said, "when there are few
other opportunities on campus."
During fall quarter, the interns will collaborate on a
group project to help them integrate into the SSE com
munity. Winter quarter they will begin their work with
in one of the divisions of SSE. Esparza, who helped run
Flicks last year, is enthusiastic about the experience and
said it encouraged him to continue working for SSE, this
year as an employee.
The program planners also hope to offer speakers
and seminars to the interns, in keeping with the goal of
providing a hands-on business education.
Interested students can pick up applications from the
front desk in the ASSU office on the second floor of
Tresidder Union.
