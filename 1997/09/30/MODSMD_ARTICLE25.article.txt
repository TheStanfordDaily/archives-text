## Like a wall Zapala provides solid goaltending

Adam Zapala's saves have been key to the 11th
ranked Cardinal men's soccer team's undefeated season,
but he may be saving his best moves for upcoming games.
Zapala, a redshirt freshman from Cupertino, Calif.,
has allowed only two goals in eight games this year, his
first as Stanford's starting goalkeeper. Not admitting to
being too impressed with himself, Zapala gives much of
the credit for his success to his teammates.
"Statistics can be deceiving," he said of his No. 2 na
tional ranking in goals-against average. "In most of the
games, 1 haven't had to make too many saves."
He's made enough, though: Only two opponents have
been able to break through the Cardinal defense for
scores, San Jose State in the first match of the season on
Sept. 2 and C'hico State in the home opener Sept. 15.
Zapala's training last year, when he didn't play any
games, seems to have paid off. Practices, training sessions
with a goalkeeper coach and watching games from the
sidelines more than prepared Zapala for his work this
year.
"I learned a lot in that year," he said. "It was a little
humbling as well."
Brian Wiese, a master's student in prtxluct design, has

been acting as a full
time goalkeeper
coach for the Stanford
team. Head coach
Bobby Clark previ
ously had coached
Wiese during Wiese's
undergraduate career
at Dartmouth.
All of last year, as
well as this summer,

Wiese to sharpen his skills. Wiese said Zapala has an in
satiable appetite for soccer balls.
"I le loves being a goalkeeper," Wiese said. "I le defi
nitely likes to sit around having people shoot at him all
day."
Zapala's natural skill as a goalkeeper is complement
ed by his confidence and his interest in the game as a
whole. ( lark coaches the Cardinal with an emphasis on
the team, not individual players, making it important for
the goalkeeper to know what's going on well beyond his
territory.
Wiese describes Zapala as "a student of the game.
1 le's interested in strategy and tactics and in tune with the
team."

During the past year, Wiese and Clark have watched
Zapala grow from a freshman they nearly cut from the
team to one of its most valuable players.
Zapala came to Stanford from Bellarmine Prep in San
Jose, where he played both soccer and baseball. Al
though he misses baseball, soccer offered him the better
opportunity when it came time to choose a university, he
said.
The Stanford soccer team wasn't doing very well at
the time, but the school's academic reputation was a con
vincing argument, as was the fact that Zapala's older
brother, Matthew, is a student here.
The younger Zapala wasn't in optimal physical shape
when he first arrived at Stanford, Wiese said, and his fu
ture on a team with too many players was in doubt.
"He's really worked his way back into our hearts,"
Wiese said.
Last year was difficult mentally, Zapala said. It some
times was hard to get motivated, he said, if "the biggest
thing you were doing was training."
Part of the incentive to succeed as goalkeeper has
come from the competition of fellow redshirt freshman
Hobby Randolph. Randolph hasn't seen any play this
season, but he's right on Zapala's tail, Clark said.

Freshman goalie Adam Zapala makes a save dur
ing a recent practice. Zapala has six shutouts in his
last seven matches.
"Both of the goalkeepers have
done really well," Clark said. "They
both push each other."
Randolph needs to realize that
"the hardest job on any team is to
play second fiddle, but often that's
the thing that drives the first fiddle,"
Clark added.
Zapala said his focus is on work
ing with all of his teammates, Ran
dolph included.
As one of 24 Stanford soccer play
ers, Zapala said he shares the team's
goal of a national championship this
year.
That may not be entirely realistic,
he said, but the team "always comes
into a season looking to win a nation
al championship."
"People who don't know us
would have laughed at the com
ment," he said, but the team is moti
vated. In the same way, Zapala ar
rived at Stanford looking for action

in his first game even though the
competition was tough with three re
turning goalkeepers and fellow re
cruit Randolph.
Whether the Cardinal wins a na
tional title while Zapala is at Stan
ford or not, he said soccer will un
doubtedly remain part of his life.
His major may end up being
English or maybe political science
— and he's thought about public
policy once or twice — but Zapala's
post-Stanford plans call for playing
soccer as long as possible and then
combining his love for the sport, his
love for teaching and his love for
children.
Zapala has worked at sports
camps since seventh grade and
taught at the Stanford soccer camp
this summer.
In the meantime, he'll keep
blocking those balls, studying for
classes and working on his personal
goal for the season: to be the best he
can be.
"I guess that sounds a little
corny," he admitted, "like I'm going
into the military. It's true, though."
