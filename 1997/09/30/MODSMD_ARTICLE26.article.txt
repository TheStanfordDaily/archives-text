# A 						closer look at the 11th-ranked Stanford men's soccer team
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal men's soccer team, cruising through an
undefeated season after eight games, finds its strength in
depth and teamwork.
While each player has a role in his individual position,
it's "unit play," head coach Bobby Clark said, that has
earned the team a No. 11 national ranking.
With more than enough players at each position and
some overlap, the team should continue to improve. Per
formance is only at about 75 percent right now, Clark
said, adding that there's no reason the Cardinal won't
reach its full potential by the end of the season.
Where the team needs to improve, Clark said, is in
having more composure when in possession of the ball
and being more creative in attacking and opening up op
posing defenses.
Here's a breakdown of the team's strengths and
weaknesses on each part of the field:
Forwards
The combination of two strikers and three midfield
players who like to move forward gives the Cardinal a
penetrating offense.
"We're really playing with five attackers," Clark said.
"The whole team is at liberty to get forward."
Freshman Corey Woolfolk made himself known im
mediately as an offensive presence, while junior A.J.
Sauer has used his skill to score several goals, including
the decisive score in overtime in last Friday's 1-0 victory
over Sacramento State.
Strikers Adam Siegman, a junior, and Brandon

Garinger, a sophomore, have both scored this year.
They, Woolfolk and Sauer "all do slightly different
things," Clark explained, "but they all work."
Midfielders
Junior transfer Simon Elliott and junior Shan Gaw
complement each other as offensive threats in the mid
field. Gaw acts as the playmaker, and Elliott attacks,
Clark said.
Elliott, who previously played at Victoria University
in New Zealand, has put some points on the board for
the Cardinal this season, while Gaw's more behind-the
scenes work also has served the team well.
Elliott and Gaw are joined in the midfield by junior
Aaron Jones and senior Erik Morrison, who Clark said
"work hard up the flanks."
The midfield, he said, is good at anticipating the ac
tion and putting pressure on the other team. That keeps
the ball on the opponents' side of the field more often
than not. The Cardinal has had significantly more shots
on goal than its opponent in most games this year.
Defenders
Senior Dan Wytock, sophomore Gerard Davis and
juniors Jamie Clark and Eric Vandevelde make for a
solid backfield. The four practiced as a unit last spring
and are comfortable together now, Clark said.
As coach, Clark has focused his team on zone play.
"The big thing when you play zonally is playing together
... looking to put pressure on the ball together," he said.
The defenders will always try to win the ball back

from the opponents if it gets away
from them, but if that's not possible,
they will maintain a fierce defense.
"1 think they really understand their
roles well," Clark said.
Davis is one of Clark's recruits
from his time in New Zealand.
Jamie Clark — named offensive
MVP of the recent St. Mary's Fall
Soccer Classic despite being a de
fender — transferred from North
Carolina.
Wytock and Vandevelde have
been with the Cardinal since their
freshman years. Wytock anchors the
defense, while Vandevelde, Clark
and Davis have all been known to

move forward and even score on oc
casion.
Goalkeepers
Redshirt freshman Adam Zapala
has let hardly a ball by him all season
as the Cardinal's goalkccpci 1 lis .25
goais-against average is second-best
in the nation.
One of Zapala's greatest
strengths, Clark said, is "his ability
to stand up to shots."
"Lots of goalkeepers anticipate
shots," he explained. "Adam holds
his ground."
Creeping up in Zapala's shadow
is another strong player, redshirt
freshman Bobby Randolph. Al
though Randolph has yet to see any
play this season, he and Zapala
bring out the best in each other,
Clark said.
