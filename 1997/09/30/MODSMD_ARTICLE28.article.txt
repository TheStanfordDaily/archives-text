# Stanford mountain bike team takes off
## 
### 
John Bilderbeck has a loud
voice, a mischievous smile and
mannerisms straight out of
"Tommy Boy." He radiates energy.
1 le's one of the nicest guys you will
ever meet.

He is also easily seduced by stu
dents with metal between their legs.
Bilderbeek, a sophomore from
LasCruces, N.M., is one of the lead
ers of the reborn Stanford mountain
bike team. Once a small group of in
dividuals, the team has nearly
tripled in size this year and will com
pete in eight races, including the
first-ever mountain bike competi
tion at .Stanford.
A branch of the 1997 national
champion Stanford cycling team,
mountain biking is coming into its
own this year, in large part to pre
serve Stanford's No. 1 cycling rank
ing. Points scored in mountain races
— where Stanford has not compet
ed much in the past — count in the
national rankings.
"Mountain hiking gives (the cy
cling team) more of a cushion,"
Bilderbeek said. "If someone from

Stanford finishes a race, we get
points."
The rapid increase in member
ship is due in large part to the efforts
of veterans like Hilderbeck and
team captain Patty C 'iesla. As part of
the major recruiting drive, Bilder
heck hunts down and talks to men
and women on mountain bikes.
He'll break away from anything
class, errands, friendly conversation,
etc. to chase after a good bike.
"That's the easiest way to tell
someone who might be interested,"
Bilderbeck said. "I can spot a really
nice suspension fork from pretty far
away."
()wning a hot bike may earn you
a surprise visit from Bilderbeck, but
its not a prerequisite for joining the
team. Bilderbeck was riding a "mid
level'' mountain bike last year when
he got involved with the club
I le stressed that an interest in hi
cycles and the outdoors is all you re
ally need to start out. "Its an ei|tii[v
ment-heavy sport," he said. But "we
can take care of that later."
Riders also don't need a ton of
experience to join the team Moun
tain bike competitions are divided
into four classifications, one of
which is reserved for beginners.
Recreational bikers can also choose
to participate only in club rides
down the many trails off Skyline
Drive.
The serious racers compete in

Tankersley
several different events: cross coun
try, a long ride that goes both up and
downhill; downhill, a classic speed
test; dual slalom, a shorter downhill
race where bikes maneuver between
obstacles; and trials riding, where
riders do tricks around an obstacle
course.
In competition or recreation, the
area around Stanford is ideal for
mountain biking, Bilderbeck said.
Most trails are single-track — the
racing terrain of choice — and the
scenery is fantastic.
"On Skyline, you can be riding
through redwood forests, crossing
streams or going on the grassy side of
a hill," he said.
Bilderbeck loves the trails, devot
ing much of his free time to riding.
He usually comes home caked with
mud, legs aching, exhausted. His
right forearm is a tiger-striped red,
the remnants of a recent wipe-out.
But dirt and blood serve only as
marks of accomplishment.
"There's something about going
out (on the trail)," he said. "Every
time you go, you learn something, no
matter what. It's (an) improvement
every time."
When he's not on the trail, he tin
kers with his bike. He tixes his
friends' bikes. He washes, tunes and
adjusts his machine to no end.
"It just feels good to have a bike
in really good working order, then
go out and ride it,"he said. "It's real
ly awesome to go into the woods, go
really fast and be in control of this
piece of metal you're on."
Surprisingly, he is not an engi
neer. A self-proclaimed "complete
fuzzy," he is simply a man who loves

his hike.
The mountain bike team is a lot
like John Bilderbeek, though he
won't tell you that. It's a group of
people who love their bikes, but
aren't necessarily engineers. They
want nothing more than for their

fellow riders to share their enthusi
asm.
"We're not askinga lot out of the
racers," Bilderbeek said. "We're
just asking you to go out and ride,
something you would be doing any
way."
