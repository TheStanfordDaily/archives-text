# A 						novel idea
## Coffee shop to open near libraries 
### Nicoli Richardson 
A new coffee shop will open
later this quarter in front of Green
Library after two years of discus
sion and negotiation.
The coffee kiosk is sponsored
by the University in collaboration
with Peet's Coffees and Teas.
The Bay Area chain has loca
tions in Palo Alto, Menlo Park
and various other sites through
out San Francisco.
With the newest addition to
the Peet's chain being established
right here on Stanford's campus,
Sarah Williamson, the assistant
director of finance at Green Li

brary, said that she has received a
lot of positive reactions from peiv
pie who are anxious for the grand
opening.
Matt Louie, junior class presi
dent, said that he thinks that a cof
fee shop near a library can make a
lot of money. Senior Stephen Lee
said it just makes sense to have a
coffee shop near a library, so that
a person can just grab a book and
a cup of coffee and relax.
Peet's grand opening will be
sometime between Thanksgiving
and winter break. Peet's will
being doing its own on-campus re -
cruiting for student employees. The
coffee shop hours will parallel library
hours, probably closing half an hour
to an hour earlier than the library on
weekdays.
And to answer the question of all
those wondering, Williamson wants
everyone to know that there is still
going to be an absolute "no food or
drink" policy in the library.
This project is designed to bring a
convenience to University students
and faculty, Williamson said.
