Stanford's newly expanded collection of
introductory seminars for freshmen and
sophomores has found a warm reception
from students and acclaim from faculty.
"There has been a great deal of student
interest," said Todd Benson, director of the
Freshmen and Sophomore Programs Office,
which administers the Stanford Introducto
ry Seminars Program.
In fact, said Benson, hundreds of fresh
men jammed into Kresge Auditorium the
Sunday before classes began in order to at

tend a meeting featuring a panel of faculty
members and students discussing the intro
ductory seminars.
"All the seats were filled and the aisles
were crammed full," said Benson.
The seminars, the centerpiece of the
Stanford Introductory Studies initiative an
nounced by University President Gerhard
Casper in May IW6, provide opportunities
for first- and second-year students to work
closely with faculty as they explore a poten
tial major through freshmen seminars and
sophomore seminars and dialogues.
Although sophomore seminars and dia-
logues have been in existence for
two years, this year marks the inau
guration of introductory seminars
geared solely toward incoming
freshmen.
More than 180 faculty from
nearly 50 departments will be tak
ing part in the SIS program this
year. There will be about 180
courses offered this year, including
nearly 50 this quarter, 70 in winter
quarter and 60 in the spring. Sev
enty-seven of all the seminars will
be freshmen seminars.

"We have received 2,337 appli
cations from 1,199 sophomores
and 1,138 freshmen," said Benson.
He noted, however, that these fig
ures merely measure the number
of applications, not applicants.
Benson estimated the number
of students that applied at "proba
bly between 800 and 1,000." Of
those, 627 applicants were accept
ed into the seminars and dialogues.
Participating faculty members
laud the seminar initiative.
"I am very excited about the
course," said German Studies Prof.
Russell Berman, who is co-teach
ing a freshmen seminar entitled
"German Studies" with fellow

German Studies Prof. Elizabeth
Bernhardt.
Berman also praised the effort
by the administration in initiating
this program.
"In leading research universi
ties like Stanford, there is often a
tendency for faculty to teach grad
uate students or teach at a distance
from undergraduates," said
Berman. "That's bad."
The freshmen seminars being
offered this quarter are diverse and
intriguing, ranging from"The
Downside of Computing Systems"
and "Biotechnology" to "Camus"
and"The Brothers Grimm and
their Fairy Tales."
