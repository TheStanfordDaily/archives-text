An unprovoked attack occurred late Fri
day night at a Theta Delta ( hi party, injuring
one student.
The fight involved a Stanford sophomore
and Palo Alto resident Dominique Cassells
and occurred at 11:45 p.m. The victim suffered
a blow to the left cheek and the lip; he was
taken to Stanford I lospital for stitches.
Twenty-two-year-old Cassells, who was
out of prison on parole, started the fight after
alleging that someone had bumped into him,
according to Stanford Police ('apt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"We're not sure how they got in," said ju
nior Sam Williams, social chair of Theta Delt.
"They might have gotten in through the barri

cades (behind the fraternity)."
According to Williams, fraternity mem
bers were checking for student identification
at the front door.
" There were four to five guys out front," he
said. "They didn't get in through the front."
Alter hitting the victim, Cassells "was
asked to leave the party," Williams said. At
that point, Cassells "began swearing at our
fraternity members."
The police report said that another fight
broke out as Cassells was forcibly removed
from the party. That fight was broken up by a
sheriffs deputy on foot patrol.
Cassells was arrested and taken to San
Jose. He was booked on charges of battery
and resisting arrest. Police determined he was
sober at the time and that the incident con
strued parole violation.
