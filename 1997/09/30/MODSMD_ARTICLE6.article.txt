# On-campus housing scarce for grads
## 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
Due to an overwhelming demand for on-cam
pus graduate housing, an unusually large number of
graduate students were not assigned housing this
year.
"The housing demand rose dramatically in all
categories of graduate housing," said Kathleen
Bransfield, manager of housing assignment ser
vices.
She attributed the increase to several factors, in
cluding the rising costs of off-campus housing. The
average monthly cost of renting a one-bedroom un
furnished apartment in Palo Alto was $837.K0 dur
ing the 1995-96 academic year, while this year the
price has increased to $ ( /74.5(). ()n-campus housing
is a noticeably better value; a single-student apart
ment on the Stanford campus, including utilities
costs, $763.08.
Nancy Tsai, a doctoral student in mechanical en

gineering, was one of many students unassigned in
the First round of the Draw last spring. She began
lix>king for housing in the summer and was success
ful.
"We got lucky," she said. "'I "he market is getting
more and more difficult." Tsai, who currently lives
in Mountain View, cites the high rent rates in Palo
Alto as part of the problem. "With the stipend that
students receive, they w<>uld n<>t be able to aff< >rd an
apartment in Palo Alto," she said.
Benjamin Lawrance,a doctoral student in histo
ry, agrees. "You can't pay $I,(XX) a month in rent
with a $1 I,(XX)a year grant," he said. "It just doesn't
work out."
Another reason for increased interest in living
on campus may be the better quality of on campus
housing. Bransfield cites the recent renovation of
more than half of the units in Escondido Village as
well as the construction of two new single graduate
student residences.
All new graduate students who apply by the

first round May deadline and express a willingness
to live anywhere are guaranteed housing.
I lowever, the process is complicated by the fact
that many graduate programs continue admitting
students throughout the summer. I*hese new stu
dents get priority for housing in the waiting list
round and at walk-in draw, where they are consid
ered for housing before returning graduate stu
dents who applied by the first round but did not re
ceive an assignment.
The rationale behind this policy is that new stu
dents are at a disadvantage when seeking housing
locally, Bransfield said.
According to Bransfield, there was a 14.6 per
cent increase in the number of graduate students
with children seeking on campus housing.
'This is the first time in many years we have seen
an increase in the demand for students-with-chil
dren housing," she said.
Ilicrc arc currently 11 graduate
families on the waiting list for students
with children housing, but all others
have been assigned.
The demand for housing for cou
ples without children also rose by 24.5
percent. While last year all couples
willing to live in any housing were as
signed, this year only 80 percent re
ceived housing.

tempted to cope with the demand by
converting 26 additional apartments
to house couples without children.
1 lowever, this fell far short of demand
according to Bransfield.
Despite the construction of two
new graduate residences — Lyman
Graduate Residences and Schwab
Residential Center, which together
accommodate 504 students — 20 per
cent of single graduate students were

unassigned.
Generally, unassigned single
graduate students are encouraged
to attend walk-ins, where they may
find housing. This year, however,

all available walk-in spaces were
filled by new graduate students.
This left no spaces for continuing
students and left 541 students
unassigned.
