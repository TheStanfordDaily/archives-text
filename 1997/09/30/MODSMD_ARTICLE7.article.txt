# Asian languages prof revels in frosh humanities track
## 
### Jennifer Chien 
This quarter marks the debut of Introduc
tion to the Humanities, the revamped fresh
man humanities requirement.
Both the old Cultures, Ideas and Values
program and the five new Introduction to the
Humanities classes are being run concurrent
ly, with the intent that CIV classes be gradual
ly phased out.
Among the new Introduction to the Hu
manities professors who have never taught
CIV is Haun Saussy. associate professor of
Asian languages and his department's chair.
Saussy, who arrived at Stanford two years
ago from UCLA, is a member of a three-per
son team teaching "The Word and the World:
Conversations Across Time and Space."
Raised in a family with four generations of
lawyers, Saussy inherited the tendency to look
very scrupulously at texts. He believes that

being a professor "just gives you a wonderful
license to spend time thinking about the stuff
that matters to you."
Originally from Nashville, Tenn., Saussy
obtained his undergraduate degree from
Duke University. "I was the only Greek
major, which is an excellent trick to getting the
undivided attention of the faculty," Saussy
joked.
After three years in Paris, where Saussy
studied ( hinese, and a period at Yale where
he picked up a doctorate in Comparative Lit
erature, Saussy ended up at UCLA teaching
classes in Chinese literature.
In his brief period here at Stanford. Saussy
has taught comparative literature and Chi
nese, published essays on Greek and Latin lit
erature, and served as a professor by courtesy
of classics.
