# Asian languages prof revels in frosh humanities track
## 
### Jennifer Chien 
This quarter marks the debut of Introduc
tion to the Humanities, the revamped fresh
man humanities requirement.
Both the old Cultures, Ideas and Values
program and the five new Introduction to the
Humanities classes are being run concurrent
ly, with the intent that CIV classes be gradual
ly phased out.
Among the new Introduction to the Hu
manities professors who have never taught
CIV is Haun Saussy. associate professor of
Asian languages and his department's chair.
Saussy, who arrived at Stanford two years
ago from UCLA, is a member of a three-per
son team teaching "The Word and the World:
Conversations Across Time and Space."
Raised in a family with four generations of
lawyers, Saussy inherited the tendency to look
very scrupulously at texts. He believes that

being a professor "just gives you a wonderful
license to spend time thinking about the stuff
that matters to you."
Originally from Nashville, Tenn., Saussy
obtained his undergraduate degree from
Duke University. "I was the only Greek
major, which is an excellent trick to getting the
undivided attention of the faculty," Saussy
joked.
After three years in Paris, where Saussy
studied ( hinese, and a period at Yale where
he picked up a doctorate in Comparative Lit
erature, Saussy ended up at UCLA teaching
classes in Chinese literature.
In his brief period here at Stanford. Saussy
has taught comparative literature and Chi
nese, published essays on Greek and Latin lit
erature, and served as a professor by courtesy
of classics.

Assoc. Asian Languages Prof. Haun Saussy, right, looks at the World Wide Web page used for the new "Introduction to the
Humanities" course he team-teaches with Englsh Prof. Larry Friedlander, shown at left.
When he's not teaching, Saussy's
main hobbies include discussing
"Curious George" children's books
with his 6-year-old daughter, play
ing with his 2-year-old son and bik
ing.
The new program is a welcome
addition to Saussy's many responsi
bilities both in and out of the class
room. Praising Stanford for being
receptive to innovation, Saussy said,
"1 like [the new program J because of
the flexibility it gives to the (profes
sors! who participate."
"It used to be that once you got
into CIV, you had to promise to do a
whole series of courses, three quar
ters. and vmi had to do them for sev

eral years," he said. "And that's ask
ing a lot of a department, which also
has one or two majors to run, gradu
ate seminars and other commit
ments."
"Under the old system, there
were really only a few departments
who could commit to CIV as heavily
as the commitment needed to be
made," Saussy said.
Saussy believes that one advan
tage of the new, more compressed
first quarter is that it invites human
ists to show why what they do is
worth doing.
" The pressure is higher, and you
just have to perform. And I find that
exciting. It's more like a high jump
than a cross-country run,"he ex
plained.
Saussy positively described the
experience of designing a new

course with fellow team members
English Prof. Larry Friedlander and
History Prof. Timothy Lenoir.
"We went in for the first day and
we were just high-fiving each other
like mad because the students were
attentive and you could see that they
bought the things that we were
putting out there, like the [World
Wide Web] site," Saussy said.
By putting background materials
on the Web, lectures could be saved
for more in-depth discussions, he
said. "So that allows us to raise the
course to a higher level, because stu
dents become experts more quick
ly."
Excited about Introduction to
the Humanities' future, Saussy said,
"I would bet my bacon that it will be
successful."
