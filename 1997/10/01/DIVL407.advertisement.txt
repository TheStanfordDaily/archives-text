YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWO COMPLETELY
OPPOSITE, FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS TO
INVEST IN STOCKS. WE RECOMMEND BOTH.
Whether you want a tunc! that selects
specific stocks, or one that covers the
market, we're on the same page. Our CREF
Growth and CREF Equity Index Accounts
use two distinct strategies for investing in the
stock market, but both aim to provide what
every smart investor looks tor: long-term
growth that outpaces inflation. 00
The CREF Growth Account searches
for individual companies that we believe
are poised for superior growth. In contrast,
the Equity Index Account looks for more
diversification, with
a portfolio that
seeks to mirror the
experience of the
U.S. stock market as a whole.
Like our CREF Stock Account, the largest
singly managed equity fund in America? 00 and
our Global Equities Account, which actively
seeks opportunities
worldwide, our
accounts are managed
by experienced
investment professionals. They're the same
experts who have helped make IIAA-CREP
the largest pension system in the world, with
$190 billion in assets under management.
