### Michael Levin 
Three Stanford professors and an econo
mist from Montana State University are the
latest additions to the Hoover Institution.
All four will be senior fellows by courtesy.
Engineering-Economic Systems and Op
erations Research Prof. William Perry, for
mer secretary of defense, has been appoint
ed along with Economics Prof. Lawrence
Lau and History Prof. Stephen Haber, who
is an associate dean of the school of Hu
manities and Sciences. They are joined by
Montana State Economics Prof. Terry An
derson.
John Raisian, Hoover's director, said he
is both optimistic and excited over the latest
additions.
"I think the appointment of these four
people represents a new beginning for the
Hoover Institution in a phase of new pro
nounced activity in the area of public poli
cy," he said.
Perry , who held his cabinet post from
1994 to 1997, now has a joint appointment in
the Department of Engineering- Economic

Systems and Operations Research and the
Institute for International Studies. His pre
vious academic experience includes a part
time professorship at Stanford from 1988 to
1993, during which time he was co-director
of Stanford's Center for International Secu
rity and Arms Control.
"Perry is an eminent figure with huge
public policy experience, and he's a top
notch addition to the institution," said
Raisian. He added that Perry will bring
tremendous political knowledge to Hoover.
At Hoover, Perry will develop a book on
American defense strategies in the post-
Cold War era and aid fund-raising efforts.
Lau — the Kwoh-Ting Li Professor of
Economic Development — is the newly ap
pointed director of Stanford's Center for
Economic Policy Research. From 1992 to
1996, he served as co-director of Stanford's
Asia / Pacific Research Center.
"Lau is one of the foremost experts of
Asian economic policy, and he will play an
important role in upcoming domestic and
international conferences,"
Raisian said.
Haber, co-director of the So
cial Science History Institute at
Stanford, has published several
books on the early stages of eco
nomic development in Mexico,
Brazil and the United States.
He will assist with the institu
tion's goal of "understanding eco
nomic and political development
around the world," Raisian said.
Haber is currently working on
a book with the institution which
should come out this year.
Anderson is an economics pro
fessor at Montana State in Boze
man, Mont, and executive direc
tor of the school's Political Econ
omy Research Center, a think
tank thatfocuses on market solu

tions to environmental problems.
His research helped launch the
idea of free market environmen
talism, the subject of one of his 20
books.
"Anderson looks at the politics
of environmental policy in an ex
citing way, putting positive eco
nomic incentives into play to
wards bettering the environ
ment," said Raisian.
Anderson's first book with the
Institution, "Breaking the Envi
ronmental Policy Gridlock," dis
cusses the attainment of a clean,
safe environment through these
means.
Raisian selects senior fellows,
who are then approved by Provost
Condoleeza Rice and University
President Gerhard Casper.
Among the more than 100 current
fellows are three Nobel laureates
and several former cabinet mem
bers.
