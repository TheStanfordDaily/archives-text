Police arrest transient
A transient was found drilling into an AIM machine inside the
Graduate Sch(X)l of Business at about 7:45 a.m. Sunday. Two officers
arrived at the scene after an alarm in the machine sounded, said Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
One officer saw a man drilling into the machine and at first thought
he was technician, Niemeyer added. ITie officer knocked on the door
and the suspect let him in. However, the man ran away before the offi
cer could arrest him.
Tuesday morning, the police department was called about someone
sleeping in the downstairs lounge of the school. Police noticed the
sleeper matched the description of the suspect who was taken in and
later confessed to the drilling, Niemeyer said.
The suspect, Christopher Kelly, is a 20-year-old transient from the
Santa Barbara, Calif, area. He was charged with burglary, evading ar
rest, trespassing, possession of burglary tools and possession of stolen
property because he had "borrowed" the drill from the Drama De
partment. Kelly is currently being held at the county jail.
Bike shop break-in
Two men broke into a Los Altos bike shop on Friday at 4:15 a.m. Ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, police were able to
catch up to the suspects after witnesses identified a stolen truck.
When the police approached, Niemeyer said, the suspects left the
truck and fled on foot. Stanford police officers later found both sus
pects.
One of the suspects, Stanford freshman Bradley Griffith, 19, denies
the charges. The other suspect, James Daniel Lemming, is known to be
a prolific bike thief, according to Niemeyer.
