Bishops define homosexuality
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Catholic bishops are
advising parents of gay children to put love and sup
port for their children before church doctrine that
condemns homosexual activity.
In a groundbreaking pastoral letter, the bishops
say homosexual orientation is not freely chosen and
parents must not reject their gay children in a society
full of rejection and discrimination.
"All in all, it is essential to recall one basic truth.
God loves every person as a unique individual. Sex
ual identity helps to define the unique person we
are," the bishops say. "God does not love someone
any less simply because he or she is homosexual."
The document was approved by the Administra
tive Board of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops early in September and released yesterday.

MIT freshman dies from overdose
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — A freshman
found unconscious amid vomit and empty liquor bot
tles at a Massachusetts Institute of Technology fra
ternity has died of an alcohol overdose.
Scott Krueger, 18, of Orchard Park, N.Y., died
late Monday, three days after the fraternity pledge
was discovered in his basement room at the Phi
Gamma Delta house.
His parents said his blood-alcohol level had reached
.410 percent — five times the legal limit for driven in
Massachusetts. Authorities say that means he con
sumed about 16 drinks. The medical examiner said yes
terday that Krueger died of an alcohol overdose.
"You'd think people here would be smarter than
that. But in some cases, tragic things just happen,"
said John Fries, 18, an MIT freshman.
