# IRS management under fire

WASHING TON (AP) — Shaken by stories of IRS
abuse, the Clinton administration scrambled yesterday
to relieve taxpayer anxieties and prevent Republicans
from capitalizing on an easy target. President Clinton
promised improvements hut said, "We should not
politicize it."
1 louse Speaker Newt Gingrich responded with a
verbal shot at Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, saying
Rubin's attendance at financial meetings overseas last
week during the Senate's tax hearings showed he was
"too busy to administer the IRS."
From Congress to the White House to the Treasury
Department, the charges and countercharges grew hot
ter. Clinton was left in the difficult position of defend
ing an unpopular agency and promising to make it bet
ter — while rejecting a bipartisan proposal for a citizen
oversight board.
Questioning Clinton's priorities, Gingrich said the
IRS — "so badly managed" — had 10 times more staff

than government agencies battling illegal drugs or
immigration problems.
But Clinton said, "I believe the IRS is functioning
better today than it was five years ago. 1 think it has to
improve more. And I think we should not try to sweep
any of these problems under the rugs."
Rubin, in a news conference following Gingrich's
attack, defended his oversight of the tax-collection
agency. He also announced the IRS would start con
ducting "problem solving days" at offices across the
country to help taxpayers.
Rubin said the Clinton administration had moved to
boost customer service with an improved system to file
taxes by touch-tone telephone and better responses on
the agency's toll-free tax help line.
He also sought to put stories of IRS misconduct
in context of mistakes made within an organization
of 102,000 workers who collect $1.5 trillion
annually.
