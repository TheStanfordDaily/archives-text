THE S TANFORD DAILY has a pol
icy about coverage of Chelsea Clin
ton while she is a student at Stanford.
The Daily is an independent newspaper â€”
our decisions are in no way influenced by
the University nor was this policy policitally
motivated.
The Daily will only cover and comment
on Chelsea when she involves herself in a
newsworthy event at Stanford. For exam
ple, her arrival on campus with her parents,
the President of the United States and the
first lady, was a newsworthy event.
Last Thursday night, a Stanford Daily
columnist, Jesse Oxfeld, submitted his week
ly piece for publication. More than half of
the column was about Chelsea Clinton,
despite her having done nothing newswor
thy. Oxfeld had been given the opportunity
to write this column about Chelsea Clinton
for the paper on Monday, Sept. 22, when the
rest of The Daily's coverage about the Presi
dent's arrival ran. However, at the time,
Oxfeld said he did not plan to write his week
ly column on Chelsea Clinton, and asked,
therefore, for his column to run on Friday.
When his Chelsea column came in
Thursday night, Oxfeld was reminded that
he had said he wouldn't be writing his col
umn on that topic. The Daily is not in the
business of rehashing old news, and the
Clinton's arrival had already been thor
oughly covered. He was given the opportu
nity to rewrite it but declined, saying the
column wouldn't run at all.
Oxfeld had an assignment to write a reg

ular weekly column, for which he was paid.
He no longer has that assignment. Oxfeld
did not lose his position as a staff columnist
because he violated the Chelsea Clinton
policy. The violation was the culmination of
a series of work-related issues that consti
tuted cause for dismissal.
As a paid staff columnist, Oxfeld repre
sented the views of a Daily staff member.
The Daily reserves the right not to give
someone a "weekly spot for punditry, pros
elytizing and pontification," especially
when the work submitted is in violation of a
policy set out to protect students' privacy.
During the past few days, The Daily has
come under fire for limiting free speech. The
Daily's opinions page has always been and
will remain an open forum for the expression
of ideas and opinions. Along with stall colum
nists, we also run opinions by community
columnists: Iliese people are not employed
by The Daily and do not in any way represent
the views of The Daily. If one of them decid
ed to write about Chelsea, regardless of the
issue, we would run the column.
An opinions page should be an open
forum for members of a community to dis
cuss current issues. We have received letters
about Chelsea Clinton's arrival and about
The Daily's coverage, and we have printed
them. If something Chelsea Clinton is doing
deserves discussion, commentary submitted
from outside sources will be printed as well.
We are dedicated to preserving both the
right of freedom of speech and the principle
of individual privacy.
