# From the Editor

### 
Today's coverage regarding the decision
not to run a weekly staff column highlights
an issue about which the Stanford commu
nity should be informed. The news story
presents impartially the facts to our readers;
the editorial, which expresses the view of
the entire editorial board, explains the

rationale behind the decision not to run
Oxleld's column.
The Daily does not want to ignore
issues that the community is talking about.
We decided to cover this issue because we
felt it was relevant to the Stanford commu
nity.
