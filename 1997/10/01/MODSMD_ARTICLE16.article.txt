Sense behind Res Ed still
unclear
I was interested enough in [Porteus']
vision of Res Ed to read [her] editorial
in yesterday's Daily. I have struggled
personally to understand the policies
and actions of Res Ed, as they have
impacted my life greatly since I've been
a student here.
In my three years and one week of
living in undergraduate housing. I have
often been affronted by the actions of
Res Ed.

I feel sure you have heard many com
plaints about the intrusive nature of cer
tain programs â€” "Crossing the Line,"
for example, is a simple game that
allows Res Ed to find out exactly what
students think and feel and what they
are doing their private lives.
For example, my grades this quarter
will be revealed to my resident fellow in
Kimball. A student who is in her fourth
year and currently pursuing a coterminal
degree should not be subjected to this
humiliating intrusion.
I was assured when I entered Stanford

that my academic records were confiden
tial; however, it seems that nothing is too
confidential to be kept from Res Ed.
[Porteus] claims that Res Ed is a col
lection of people who behave differently
in different houses in different years. I
have had five different RAs assigned to
my halls. They have been uniformly
pushy and bossy to their residents but
fakely upbeat about Stanford and dorm
programs. It's hard for me to believe
that this type of behavior is not part of
the job description.
1 object to the philosophy that justi

fies Res Ed's overwhelming control over
our lives at Stanford.
Res Ed exists because some believe
that Stanford students are incapable of
directing their own lives, living harmo
niously together and becoming whole
people without interference.
If the University thinks so little of us,
then why were we admitted?
[She] argue[s] in [her] article that Res
Ed is not a monolith. In fact. Res Ed is
the embodiment of the word monolith.
In [her] own words, "Can students
escape 'Res Ed'? No."

Burn the bureaucrats
Maybe we could hold the bonfire off
campus this year, say on the front lawn
of the closest East Palo Alto building.
If we know anything about environ
mental protectionism, it's that govern
ment bureaucrats are certainly NOT an
endangered species.
