## Matt Pearl Finding your own chrysalis 
### 
THERE'S A STORY
I once read , called
"Hope for the
Flowers." It's about cater-
I pillars who try to climb
higher and higher without
knowing what's up there,
all the while stepping on
those they leave behind.

In the end, one of the caterpillars learns
that in order to go higher, she must become
a butterfly. After doing so, she convinces
her love, who is still climbing, to become a
butterfly as well; and the two fly away
together.
It is not difficult to apply this metaphor
to the everyday happenings of this universi
ty — people who climb not knowing where
they're going or why and not caring either.
People who don't question who they are;
people deathly afraid to give up the concep
tion of self they've been handed by their
parents, their friends, their religion and
schooling in order to listen to their hearts
and reach their greater potential.
"Stanford's so laid back," they say as
they whiz past me on their rollerblades
heading toward the Coffee House for a
double mocha-half-caf-Frappucino.
"Stanford gives you such latitude for per
sonal interests," the brochures reads — and
yet if you wish to save yourself $30,(KM) so
that after graduation you might be able to
afford a one-room closet in Menlo Park
pretty near your World Wide Web pro
gramming job, you needn't think of deviat
ing much outside your major.
"But there's a counter-culture here," a
girl with dreadlocks and a Pavement shirt
tells me. Even the word makes me shudder.
Not Pavement, counter-culture.
Say it again. Don't worry, you can say it
loudly. It's already become re-appropriated
and safe for general use.
You see, whether you're in the dominant
paradigm or anti-the dominant paradigm,

you're equally obsessed with the dominant
paradigm. Your new ideas will never be
really new, because they will be based on
what's already there.
Revolution has two meanings, the lesser
used one being to come full circle, which is
exactly what our revolutions seem to do —
bring us right back to where we started, with
the exception that now we're more apathet
ic than when we started. The real object is
to transcend. To take what's there and
make something better.
Don't get me wrong. When 1 punch my
card at the end of the day and go home to
watch the fun box, I'm still an idealist. I'm
still strong in my belief that things can and
will change, and that we're the ones who'll
bring that change.
My friends tell me sometimes how alone
they feel. I think they confuse me with their
therapist. Over a cup of tea and a Zanex,
they tell me how they came here because
they thought there would be passionate
people. But in reality nobody ever ques
tions anything, does anything or wants any
thing more out of life than an upper middle
class existence. They feel they can confide
in me because 1 don't want anything more
out of life than a pool shaped like Elvis's
head with a hot tub in the sideburn. I make
light, but their concerns are valid.
A world where people choose careers and
lovers without really knowing themselves,
without really knowing other people, is a mis
erable world. It's a world where the average
person changes jobs seven times and half of
married couples get divorces. It's the world
we live in, and it's on the path to disaster.
What's the solution? The solution is to
take some time and find you. Not the you
that you think you are, but the you that you
know you are. Time to stop being a cater
pillar and become a butterfly. Sure it'll take
a long time, years in fact, to unlearn every
thing you think you know. But someone
once said to me, "You know how old I'll be

by the time I've done this? As old as I
would have been if 1 hadn t.
What you need to do is to find your
voice, your passion. Find what it is that you
love to do, because it's the only thing that's
going to carry you through the rest of your
life. And I don't just mean a career but
everything — friends, lovers, hobbies, what
ever. Create a vision and work toward it
uncompromisingly. Sure, it will change, but
because you want it to, not because some
one else made you compromise it.
My passion is humor writing, though you
probably can't tell from this column. 1 fig
ured with only one shot I'd write something
that expresses some of my other concerns
rather than something that made you laugh
and got left in the stall.
Being your best you isn't always easy.
People try to get me to compromise my
vision all the time. I don't listen though. 1
know that the only person 1 have to answer
to at the end of the day is me. As long as 1
do the best job I can, I am successful. That's
the beautiful thing in all this. You don't
have to listen to anyone, because no one
knows more about what you should be
doing than you do. No one is keeping score,
and no one's giving out awards.
If you're focusing only on the goal, I'll
tell you something: It's death, and it's not so
pretty — sorry if I ruined the surprise. Try
instead to focus on where you are, where
you've been and where you're going.
When you have taken the time to do this,
you'll find that doors open and opportuni
ties arise. The universe is conspiring with
you. You'll be amazed by your potential.
Grab hold of these synchronous events and
don't be afraid to fail. There's a Zen saying
that goes, "If you fall down six times, get up
seven." That's great advice, especially for
me, who's fallen down 654 times.

"But there's a counter-culture here," a
girl with dreadlocks and a Pavement shirt
tells me. Even the word makes me shudder.
Not Pavement, counter-culture.
Say it again. Don't worry, you can say it
loudly. It's already become re-appropriated
and safe for general use.
You see, whether you're in the dominant
paradigm or anti-the dominant paradigm,

you're equally obsessed with the dominant
paradigm. Your new ideas will never be
really new, because they will be based on
what's already there.
Revolution has two meanings, the lesser
used one being to come full circle, which is
exactly what our revolutions seem to do —
bring us right back to where we started, with
the exception that now we're more apathet
ic than when we started. The real object is
to transcend. To take what's there and
make something better.
Don't get me wrong. When 1 punch my
card at the end of the day and go home to
watch the fun box, I'm still an idealist. I'm
still strong in my belief that things can and
will change, and that we're the ones who'll
bring that change.
My friends tell me sometimes how alone
they feel. I think they confuse me with their
therapist. Over a cup of tea and a Zanex,
they tell me how they came here because
they thought there would be passionate
people. But in reality nobody ever ques
tions anything, does anything or wants any
thing more out of life than an upper middle
class existence. They feel they can confide
in me because 1 don't want anything more
out of life than a pool shaped like Elvis's
head with a hot tub in the sideburn. I make
light, but their concerns are valid.
A world where people choose careers and
lovers without really knowing themselves,
without really knowing other people, is a mis
erable world. It's a world where the average
person changes jobs seven times and half of
married couples get divorces. It's the world
we live in, and it's on the path to disaster.
What's the solution? The solution is to
take some time and find you. Not the you
that you think you are, but the you that you
know you are. Time to stop being a cater
pillar and become a butterfly. Sure it'll take
a long time, years in fact, to unlearn every
thing you think you know. But someone
once said to me, "You know how old I'll be

by the time I've done this? As old as I
would have been if 1 hadn t.
What you need to do is to find your
voice, your passion. Find what it is that you
love to do, because it's the only thing that's
going to carry you through the rest of your
life. And I don't just mean a career but
everything — friends, lovers, hobbies, what
ever. Create a vision and work toward it
uncompromisingly. Sure, it will change, but
because you want it to, not because some
one else made you compromise it.
My passion is humor writing, though you
probably can't tell from this column. 1 fig
ured with only one shot I'd write something
that expresses some of my other concerns
rather than something that made you laugh
and got left in the stall.
Being your best you isn't always easy.
People try to get me to compromise my
vision all the time. I don't listen though. 1
know that the only person 1 have to answer
to at the end of the day is me. As long as 1
do the best job I can, I am successful. That's
the beautiful thing in all this. You don't
have to listen to anyone, because no one
knows more about what you should be
doing than you do. No one is keeping score,
and no one's giving out awards.
If you're focusing only on the goal, I'll
tell you something: It's death, and it's not so
pretty — sorry if I ruined the surprise. Try
instead to focus on where you are, where
you've been and where you're going.
When you have taken the time to do this,
you'll find that doors open and opportuni
ties arise. The universe is conspiring with
you. You'll be amazed by your potential.
Grab hold of these synchronous events and
don't be afraid to fail. There's a Zen saying
that goes, "If you fall down six times, get up
seven." That's great advice, especially for
me, who's fallen down 654 times.
