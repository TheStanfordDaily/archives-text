# Foreign Bureau: Berlin
## Marni Leff Historical reminders keep Jewish memories alive 
### 
I LOVE FANCY hotels. Because my par
ents accompanied me to Berlin — where
I am to spend three months improving
my German, learning about the culture and
somehow enhancing both my Stanford
experience and my life in general — I had
the opportunity to spend the better part of
last week in one such hotel.
I enjoyed my first day in the hotel
immensely, or at least as much as possible in
my jet-lagged stupor. But after a good
night's sleep, though my senses had not
completely returned, my mother's had. She
noticed a plaque mounted near the hotel's
main entrance and asked me to translate.
The plaque read as follows: "Since 1928
the Kempinski Restaurant hassttxxl here. It
was a famous symbol world-wide of Berlin
hospitality. Because the owners were Jews
this famous restaurant was aryanized' in
1937 and bought by force. Some relatives of
the Kempinski family were killed, while oth
ers were able to escape, llie Bristol Hotel
Kempinski reopened in 1952 would like the
fate of the founding family not to be forgot
ten."

A few days later, while having drinks in
the hotel bar with my parents and a German
colleague of my father's, I learned that sur
vivors of the Kempinski family and other
members of the Jewish community fought
hard to have the hotel's original owners
acknowledged.
When Bristol reopened the hotel in 1952,
it chose to use the original owner's name,
without paying tribute to the family. Mem
bers of the Kempinski family argued that if
the new owners were to benefit from the use
of the Kempinski name, they had a moral
obligation to remember the family's fate.
The plaque went up in the summer of 1994.
My mother's discovery of the plaque star
tled me, because despite an internship at the
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washing
ton D.C. this summer, I simply didn't expect
history to interfere with my stay in Berlin.
While I looked forward to the opportunities
I would have in Berlin to learn about the
Holocaust, 1 intended to do that research on
my own terms. I planned to summon the
ghosts only when I wanted to deal with
them. I never counted on being unexpected

ly forced to balance my desire to experience
Berlin with my Jewish background.
Though uncomfortable with my new
found knowledge about the hotel, I figured
all would be well once my program started.
I was wrong again. Ben J. Frank aptly called
Berlin an "open air museum of the nation's
history" in his book, "A Travel Guide to
Jewish Europe."
Monday as part of a get-to-know-Berlin
scavenger hunt, I made yet another highly
disturbing discovery. It turns out that the
KaDeWe, which some deem Europe's
biggest department store, like the Kempins
ki hotel, first was founded hy a Jew and later
"aryani/.ed" by the Nazis in the '30s.
Another stop on the scavenger hunt lead
me to the newly rebuilt Neue Synagogue.
Destroyed during the war, the building
reopened in NBB, as a cultural center rather
than a place of worship.
Two armed police officers sUxmJ outside
the synagogue smoking cigarettes. Earlier in
the day while passing another Jewish land
mark, I had noticed a pair of police officers
engaged in similar activity. 1 also remember

seeing police on patrol at yet another monu
ment while 1 was playing tourist with mv
parents last week.
None of the police officers that I
observed seemed to be working all that
hard. So I decided to ask the pair in front of
the synagogue if they ever did anything,
though I phrased the question a little more
delicately.
The police officer who answered me was
friendly, recognizing my accent. He
explained that Jewish institutions got a lot of
threats, so they were all patrolled. He said
that although at the moment il didn't appear
that way, the police officers who guarded
these monuments, museums and memorials
were more than token.
He was quick to add, however, that most
of the threats to Jews in Berlin came from
Islamic fundamentalists and other Arabic
groups, not neo-Nazis.
At the end of the scavenger hunt, my
group and I met up with staff from the Stan
ford Center in a cafe. I was talking to Jutta,
the internship and academic assistant. Jutta
explained to me that the German police

guarded not only institutions but also the
homes of prominent German Jews.
Hearing that upset me. Having police
guard the Neue Synagogue was one thing;
the intense security checks at the I lolocaust
Museum that I observed all summer pre
pared me for that. But the armed police
officers guarding any and every thing Jew
ish in Berlin set off some warning bells and
made me feel that I really ought to rethink
things.
I decided to go to Berlin while tucked
away inside the happy little bubble we call
Stanford. In Palo Alto, I could easily sepa
rate past from present. But in Berlin with
plaques, monuments and memorials seem
ingly on every street corner, doing so has
become a challenge. Shopping at stores and
staying in hotels whose owners I know per
ished at the hands of the Na/is gives me the
creeps. And I have come to realize the line
that divides "now" from "then" is lot less
clearly drawn than I previously thought.

column will appear here on Wednesdays.
