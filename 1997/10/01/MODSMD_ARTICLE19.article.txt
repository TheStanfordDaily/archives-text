Daily editor's personnel decision questioned and praised

Sleeth accused of fascism
I have just read about your antics while
trying to prove your worthiness to hold the
position of editor in chief at your school's
newspaper. To think you would fire Mr.
Oxfeld for expressing an opinion truly
brings back the days you must yearn for
when heroes like Stalin, Hitler and Lennin
(sic) ruled Asia and Eastern Europe. You
must feel slighted that by the time you got
to visit "Mother Russia" the Communists
were out of power.
To think, that in the land of the free, a
person would be censored, censured and
then sacked for writing an article about a
topic that might have brought to light bet
ter procedures for receiving royalty at your
campus. Chelsea Clinton, whether she likes
it or not, or whether or not your school
promised her privacy, is a public person.
How she effects the lives of others is news
worthy of report.
To think she is to be put above others at
your school, and receive special treatment
in [this] publication, flies in the face of
everything your teachers should be teach
ing you about journalism. Maybe Stam
ford's (sic) journalism program has forgot
ten about the First Amendment of The
United States Constitution and has adopt
ed the teachings of TASS. Maybe you
should suggest to the admissions depart
ment they put Chelsea's picture on the
school's brochure cover since she has been
anointed 'Queen of Stamford.'
I read your article about your trip on
the Moscow train. Maybe next time you
should hold your head high and be a proud
American instead of trying to become a
member of the same society that allowed

the murder of 4(X) million of their country
men by their government. Maybe you
should have smiled at the beauty-chal
lenged woman and told her that you were
an American and did not realize there
were rules about where to stand on a train;
instead you cowered off trying to hide your
heritage wishing you could grow warts of
your own. Pathetic.
Stamford should replace you and put
Mr. Oxfeld in your place. It seems to me he
at least was trying to do his job in reporting
more than what the powers-that-be tells
him too. You should be ashamed!

Oxfeld exploiting Chelsea's
proximity
[The Daily's] decision not to run Jesse
Oxfeld article on Chelsea Clinton, which
itself became an AP wire story today, was a
good one.
Kudos to you for exercising class and
good judgment in allowing her to lead
some semblance of a normal life. As for
Mr. Oxfeld, he appears to be grabbing his
Andy Warhol "15 minutes of fame" early
in life by exploiting his geographic proximi
ty to Chelsea Clinton. I think his 15 min
utes are up.

Congrats for living up to
promise
I just read the San Jose Mercury News
article about the decision by Carolyn
Sleeth to dismiss the columnist who insist-

Ed on writing about Chelsea Clinton.
Congratulations to Ms. Sleeth for living
up to her organization's promise to stay out
of Chelsea's business except when she cre
ates news. Ihe world is already awash in
self-serving pundits and garbage stories dis
guised as news or commentary, and I'm
impressed that your paper had the integrity
to eschew this waste of time and stick to
what's important. (Not to mention respect
ing Ms. Clinton's privacy.) Given Mr.
Oxfeld's preference for "punditry," per
haps he should seek work in Hollywood,
working as a script "writer'' for one of the
many sitcoms that elevate voyeuristic and
puerile perspectives.

Dissenting views belong in
opinions section
I find it distressing and appalling that
the student newspaper at one of the top
journalism school's in the nation, plans to
silence columns, news stories, etc. about
the daughter of the president, Chelsea
Clinton.
While she is entitled to privacy, her
presence on campus raises many issues in
which your paper, if it hasn't already, needs
to be covering. Such issues as security, i.e.
can the secret service push around cops
and do they get to bring guns on campus,
are very relevant to other students' lives. It
is admirable to want and to say that
Chelsea deserves to be treated like every
one else, but the reality is she is the daugh
ter of the President of the United States.
I'm not saying you should tail her around
or make every action of hers known. She

does deserve fairness and not sensational
ism, but some standard other than a ban on
coverage must apply.
What's worse is how you enforce the
policy on your opinion page. I was shocked
to read an AP story that a columnist was
fired because he disagreed and wanted to
write about it. An opinion page is a forum
for people's opinions, especially dissenting
ones.

What are they teaching yon
anyway?
Just read an article about the firing of
Mr. Oxfeld. If this is what Stanford stands
for, God help us all. I thought that a uni
versity, especially Stanford, was supposed
to be a place where any and all thoughts
could be examined regardless of their polit
ical "sensitivity ." I guess Stanford is just yet
one more place where political correctness
has run amok.
If you can't handle a story like this, you
children have a lot to learn about the real
world. Too bad your advisers don't have a
clue about what happens out here any
more than you do.
My opinion of the intellectual integrity
of Stanford has been lowered considerably.
Thanks for the lesson.

Call it censorship
I he one right most Americans have
casually allowed to slip away from them

is the right to privacy. Income tax,
school, military, credit information. All
of these are available to whomever
wants to spend the time or money to
obtain them. Why should Chelsea get
special protection regarding her exis
tence in the "real world"? Are we not
equal in the eyes of the law? Should she
not be offered up by the free press like
any one of us? Sleeth's dismissal of a
good journalist shows a dangerous and
short sighted censorship that makes me
hope this will be the end of her journal
istic career as well. I'rint is speech,
speech is free.

Offering a recommendation
Did your editor, Ms. Sleeth I believe
is her name, really fire a reporter for
submitting a story about Chelsea Clin
ton?
A recommendation. Beyond the fact
that the reputation the press in this coun
try is pretty shabby because of its very,
very left leaning bias, and beyond the sus
picion most people have that Stanford is
just another institution of "higher" learn
ing loaded with a bunch of air-headed,
politically correct, communist leaning
educators and flower children, doesn't it
strike someone there that firing an
employee for reporting on a subject that
one editor deems off limits is somehow
wrong?
Anyway, hope you beat Notre Dame
this weekend.

Sleeth to dismiss the columnist who insist-

Ed on writing about Chelsea Clinton.
Congratulations to Ms. Sleeth for living
up to her organization's promise to stay out
of Chelsea's business except when she cre
ates news. Ihe world is already awash in
self-serving pundits and garbage stories dis
guised as news or commentary, and I'm
impressed that your paper had the integrity
to eschew this waste of time and stick to
what's important. (Not to mention respect
ing Ms. Clinton's privacy.) Given Mr.
Oxfeld's preference for "punditry," per
haps he should seek work in Hollywood,
working as a script "writer'' for one of the
many sitcoms that elevate voyeuristic and
puerile perspectives.

Dissenting views belong in
opinions section
I find it distressing and appalling that
the student newspaper at one of the top
journalism school's in the nation, plans to
silence columns, news stories, etc. about
the daughter of the president, Chelsea
Clinton.
While she is entitled to privacy, her
presence on campus raises many issues in
which your paper, if it hasn't already, needs
to be covering. Such issues as security, i.e.
can the secret service push around cops
and do they get to bring guns on campus,
are very relevant to other students' lives. It
is admirable to want and to say that
Chelsea deserves to be treated like every
one else, but the reality is she is the daugh
ter of the President of the United States.
I'm not saying you should tail her around
or make every action of hers known. She

does deserve fairness and not sensational
ism, but some standard other than a ban on
coverage must apply.
What's worse is how you enforce the
policy on your opinion page. I was shocked
to read an AP story that a columnist was
fired because he disagreed and wanted to
write about it. An opinion page is a forum
for people's opinions, especially dissenting
ones.

What are they teaching yon
anyway?
Just read an article about the firing of
Mr. Oxfeld. If this is what Stanford stands
for, God help us all. I thought that a uni
versity, especially Stanford, was supposed
to be a place where any and all thoughts
could be examined regardless of their polit
ical "sensitivity ." I guess Stanford is just yet
one more place where political correctness
has run amok.
If you can't handle a story like this, you
children have a lot to learn about the real
world. Too bad your advisers don't have a
clue about what happens out here any
more than you do.
My opinion of the intellectual integrity
of Stanford has been lowered considerably.
Thanks for the lesson.

Call it censorship
I he one right most Americans have
casually allowed to slip away from them

is the right to privacy. Income tax,
school, military, credit information. All
of these are available to whomever
wants to spend the time or money to
obtain them. Why should Chelsea get
special protection regarding her exis
tence in the "real world"? Are we not
equal in the eyes of the law? Should she
not be offered up by the free press like
any one of us? Sleeth's dismissal of a
good journalist shows a dangerous and
short sighted censorship that makes me
hope this will be the end of her journal
istic career as well. I'rint is speech,
speech is free.

Did your editor, Ms. Sleeth I believe
is her name, really fire a reporter for
submitting a story about Chelsea Clin
ton?
A recommendation. Beyond the fact
that the reputation the press in this coun
try is pretty shabby because of its very,
very left leaning bias, and beyond the sus
picion most people have that Stanford is
just another institution of "higher" learn
ing loaded with a bunch of air-headed,
politically correct, communist leaning
educators and flower children, doesn't it
strike someone there that firing an
employee for reporting on a subject that
one editor deems off limits is somehow
wrong?
Anyway, hope you beat Notre Dame
this weekend.

Daily editor's personnel decision questioned and praised

Sleeth accused of fascism
I have just read about your antics while
trying to prove your worthiness to hold the
position of editor in chief at your school's
newspaper. To think you would fire Mr.
Oxfeld for expressing an opinion truly
brings back the days you must yearn for
when heroes like Stalin, Hitler and Lennin
(sic) ruled Asia and Eastern Europe. You
must feel slighted that by the time you got
to visit "Mother Russia" the Communists
were out of power.
To think, that in the land of the free, a
person would be censored, censured and
then sacked for writing an article about a
topic that might have brought to light bet
ter procedures for receiving royalty at your
campus. Chelsea Clinton, whether she likes
it or not, or whether or not your school
promised her privacy, is a public person.
How she effects the lives of others is news
worthy of report.
To think she is to be put above others at
your school, and receive special treatment
in [this] publication, flies in the face of
everything your teachers should be teach
ing you about journalism. Maybe Stam
ford's (sic) journalism program has forgot
ten about the First Amendment of The
United States Constitution and has adopt
ed the teachings of TASS. Maybe you
should suggest to the admissions depart
ment they put Chelsea's picture on the
school's brochure cover since she has been
anointed 'Queen of Stamford.'
I read your article about your trip on
the Moscow train. Maybe next time you
should hold your head high and be a proud
American instead of trying to become a
member of the same society that allowed

the murder of 4(X) million of their country
men by their government. Maybe you
should have smiled at the beauty-chal
lenged woman and told her that you were
an American and did not realize there
were rules about where to stand on a train;
instead you cowered off trying to hide your
heritage wishing you could grow warts of
your own. Pathetic.
Stamford should replace you and put
Mr. Oxfeld in your place. It seems to me he
at least was trying to do his job in reporting
more than what the powers-that-be tells
him too. You should be ashamed!

Oxfeld exploiting Chelsea's
proximity
[The Daily's] decision not to run Jesse
Oxfeld article on Chelsea Clinton, which
itself became an AP wire story today, was a
good one.
Kudos to you for exercising class and
good judgment in allowing her to lead
some semblance of a normal life. As for
Mr. Oxfeld, he appears to be grabbing his
Andy Warhol "15 minutes of fame" early
in life by exploiting his geographic proximi
ty to Chelsea Clinton. I think his 15 min
utes are up.
