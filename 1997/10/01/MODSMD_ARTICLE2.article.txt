## Media attention focuses on 'Chelsea question'

The Daily's policy to protect freshman
Chelsea Clinton's privacy has led to the firing of
one of its long-time employees, and has
brought the national media back to campus.
Senior Jesse Oxfeld, who refused to rewrite
an opinion column about Clinton's arrival on
campus Sept. 19, was fired Thursday after edi
tor in chief Carolyn Sleeth judged-that the orig
inal column violated the paper's pledge to keep
Clinton out of the spotlight.
Television crews and journalists from
around the country swept through The Daily's
offices and filled Oxfeld's voice mail box yes
terday, eager to determine whether Oxfeld's
termination was a breach of his First Amend

The Daily's policy, which states that Clinton
will be the focus of an article only if she commits
a newsworthy act, was announced by Sleeth last

policy were at issue.
Oxfeld said that while the policy is well-in

Opinions page, which he said he feels is exempt
from a policy relating to news articles.
"1 stand behind the column," Oxfeld said.
"You can agree or disagree with it. That's fine.
But the intended role of an op-ed page is to be
a conduit for public discussion."
In the column, Oxfeld questioned "why

give Chelsea and her family a 'normal' Stanford
experience while the first family itself is under
no similar obligation."
He also commented on The Daily's policy,
calling it "Clintonian" and describing it as
"don't ask (anything about her life), don't tell
(anyone outside the campus what you might
happen to discover about her life), don't pursue
(her, at all)."
Sleeth disagreed with Oxfeld's claim to "ed
itorial immunity." She said that Oxfeld, as a
paid staff columnist, had to work under the pol
icy's constrictions and his failure to do so gave
her no choice but to let him go.
In fact, Sleeth said that if Oxfeld had turned
in the column on Sept. 21, the day before it was
originally set to appear in the paper along with
