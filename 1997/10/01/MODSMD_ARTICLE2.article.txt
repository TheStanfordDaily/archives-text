## Media attention focuses on 'Chelsea question' 
### David Stein Staff writer 
The Daily's policy to protect freshman
Chelsea Clinton's privacy has led to the firing of
one of its long-time employees, and has
brought the national media back to campus.
Senior Jesse Oxfeld, who refused to rewrite
an opinion column about Clinton's arrival on
campus Sept. 19, was fired Thursday after edi
tor in chief Carolyn Sleeth judged-that the orig
inal column violated the paper's pledge to keep
Clinton out of the spotlight.
Television crews and journalists from
around the country swept through The Daily's
offices and filled Oxfeld's voice mail box yes
terday, eager to determine whether Oxfeld's
termination was a breach of his First Amend
ment rights.
The Daily's policy, which states that Clinton
will be the focus of an article only if she commits
a newsworthy act, was announced by Sleeth last
month. Since that time, the policy gained atten
tion from the national media.
According to both Oxfeld and Sleeth, nei
ther constitutional rights nor the integrity of the
policy were at issue.
Oxfeld said that while the policy is well-in

tentioned, it should not relate to a piece on the
Opinions page, which he said he feels is exempt
from a policy relating to news articles.
"1 stand behind the column," Oxfeld said.
"You can agree or disagree with it. That's fine.
But the intended role of an op-ed page is to be
a conduit for public discussion."
In the column, Oxfeld questioned "why
we're all expected to bend over backward to
give Chelsea and her family a 'normal' Stanford
experience while the first family itself is under
no similar obligation."
He also commented on The Daily's policy,
calling it "Clintonian" and describing it as
"don't ask (anything about her life), don't tell
(anyone outside the campus what you might
happen to discover about her life), don't pursue
(her, at all)."
Sleeth disagreed with Oxfeld's claim to "ed
itorial immunity." She said that Oxfeld, as a
paid staff columnist, had to work under the pol
icy's constrictions and his failure to do so gave
her no choice but to let him go.
In fact, Sleeth said that if Oxfeld had turned
in the column on Sept. 21, the day before it was
originally set to appear in the paper along with
a big spread on the Clintons' appear
ance, there would not have been a
problem.
However, Sleeth said, Oxfeld
chose to run the column on Sept. 26,
under the condition that there would
be no mention of Clinton.
"It was just that on Friday, |a col
umn on Chelsea] was no longer time
ly and no longer considered news
worthy," Sleeth said.
However, Sleeth was also quick to
point out that this violation was not
I he sole reason for Oxfcld's firing but
rather the "culmination of a series of
work-related incidents." She said
there had been tension between the
two for some time.
Oxfeld said that if there were any
work-related problems, no one ever
mentioned them to him, although he

said he felt the policy violation to be
some sort of an "excuse" for firing
him.
Oxfeld, who previously served as
The Daily's managing editor for spe
cial sections, said he was disappoint
ed in how everything turned out.
"I've given a lot of time, a lot of ef
fort, and —this may sound trite—but
a lot of heart and soul to The Daily,"
Oxfeld said. "It's hard to see my ca
reer at The Daily end over one col
umn."
Since Clinton's decision to attend
Stanford, Oxfeld has said he wanted
to be the "official Chelsea pundit."
He has made appearances for Na
tional Public Radio and the Today
Show, among others.
Following his firing, he was
swamped with interview requests.
Oxfeld said he has turned down,
with one exception, all offers to ap
pear on national talk shows or call-in
shows.
