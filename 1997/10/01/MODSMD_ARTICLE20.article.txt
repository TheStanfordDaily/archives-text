## CML patients need bone marrow transplants Genetic flaw causes CML 
### Ellen Licking Contributing writer 
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) is a cancer of the bone mar
row that is caused by the overpro
duction of white blood cells. It can
not be cured with chemotherapy or
radiation.
"Basically malignant cells in the
bone marrow grow so much faster
that they push out the healthy cells
until there are none left," said Dr.
Wendy Hu, a physician at the Stan
ford Bone Marrow Transplant Cen
ter.
Bone marrow, the spongy tissue
inside the large bones of the body,
produces three types of blood cells:
red blood cells, which carry oxygen
and other materials to all the cells in
the body; white blood cells, which
fight infection; and platelets, which
help the blood to clot.
The bone marrow cells that
develop into these three cell types
are called blasts. In CML patients,
white blood cell precursors, also
known as granulocytes, fail to
mature normally. Instead, these
immature blast cells continue to
grow and divide, eventually spilling
out of the bone marrow and into the
bloodstream.
In time, white cell maturation
ceases, and the circulatory system
contains increasing numbers of the
malignant precursor cells. Some
times malignant tumors form in such
places as the bone or the lymph
nodes. This condition is the dreaded
"blast phase," which heralds death
within three to six months unless a
suitable donor can be found.

Almost all the maligntuit cells in patients with
CML also haVt ,J a specific chromosomal abnor
mality called the Philadelphia (Phi) chromo
some. The Phi chromosome is the result of a
reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes
9 and 22. In this type of chromosomal rearrange
ment, a piece of chromosome 22 is swapped for a
piece of chromosome 9 and vice versa. Because
this exchange is reciprocal, no genetic material is
lost, and the total chromosome number remains
unchanged.
Although this translocation does not result in
the loss of any genetic information, it still has
drastic consequences. The substitution moves
the proto-oncogene abl, a gene involved in cellu
lar growth and differentiation, from its normal
position on chromosome 9 to the "breakpoint
cluster region" (BCR), a gene of unknown func
tion on chromosome 22.

The abl gene product is a tyrosine kinase, a
protein that modifies the amino acid tyrosine of
target proteins and activates them. It plays an
important role in transmitting signals outside the
cell to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the message
results in the transcription of specific genes
involved in growth and development. Under nor
mal conditions this signaling is tightly controlled,
and the abl gene product does not prematurely
activate its targets.
Juxtaposition of BCR and abl sequences,
however, disrupts this regulation resulting in the
creation of a novel protein that has increased cel
lular activity. As a result, many cellular pathways
that are not normally active are in operation. The
outcome is uncontrolled growth and prolifera
tion in the cells that express the Philadelphia
translocation.
In CML patients, a subset of the bone marrow
precursor cells are affected by the mutation, and
its uncontrolled growth can trigger the blast

phase of the disease.
Onee a patient is in blast erisis, his only hope
is an allogeneic hone marrow transplant, the
infusion of bone marrow cells from a genetically
different individual. The transplanted cells retain
the genotype of the donor, so they do not contain
the detrimental Phi chromosome.
Proteins called human leukocyte antigens
(HLAs) are used to match the donor and the
patient. These proteins are found on the surface
of white blood cells and other tissues. Three dif
ferent antigens, HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR
are used to determine whether or not a potential
donor and patient match.
Individuals have two sets of each antigen, one
set inherited from each parent. For this reason, it
is much more likely that a sibling will match the
patient than an unrelated individual. In fact,
brothers and sisters have a 25 percent chance of
