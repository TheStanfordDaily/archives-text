# Donors urgently needed
## 
### Ellen Licking Contributing writer 
Three years ago, Alan Kuo was on top of the world. I lav
ing earned his doctoral degree from Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, he moved to the Bay Area to begin a post
doctoral fellowship in an AIDS research laboratory at IJC-
San Francisco. His enthusiasm for scientific research was at
an all-time high. He was healthy, eager to explore the leg
endary beauty of the northern California coast.

A few months later, during a routine check-up, he learned that he wasn't
as healthy as he had thought. A blood test revealed abnormally high num
bers of white blood cells in his circulatory system. Further testing confirmed
that Kuo has chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood
in which the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells.
The only known cure for his condition is a bone marrow transplant from
a healthy donor.
CML, which is caused by a mutated chromosome, is like a bomb waiting
to go off. In its early stages, the cancerous cells are found only 111 the bone
marrow and are a minor component of the marrow cell population. At the
more advanced stage, the number of cancerous or "blast" cells increases
dramatically, spilling out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream.
It can take years for the disease to progress from the chronic to the acute
stage, and the event that triggers this transition is unknown.
In July, Kuo's world exploded. The number of cancerous cells in his
body had increased to the point where he was experiencing a high fever,
nausea, aches and pains. I le had entered the blast crisis stage ol ( ML, and
the prognosis was not good.
"Alan is really running out of time," said his oncologist at IJCSF, Dr.
Hope Rugo. Without a transplant from a matched donor, a person in his
condition has an estimated three to six months to live.
Despite long odds, Kuo, his family and friends haven't given up hope.
They have launched a campaign that is now global, thanks to e mail and the
Internet, in the hopes of finding a suitable donor. "I le has such a great spir
it — he can't not make it. All it takes is one person," says his friend Akiko
Hall.
That special individual must share the same white blood cell markers,
called human leukocyte antigens (lILAs), as Kuo. Like eye and skin color,
these antigens are inherited characteristics. I ialf of the antigens are passed
down from the mother, and the other half are passed down from the father.
Because of this genetic component, patients have the best chance of finding
a donor among people who share their ethnic background. For Kuo, this
means someone of Asian descent.
Currently 2.K million volunteer marrow donors are registered with the
National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). Of these, only 1(S0,(K)0 or IS.h
percent are Asian-Americans.
The probability that two unrelated individuals will share the same 1 11 As
varies widely depending on the frequency of the individual antigens in the



Katie Stokes Daily
population. On average, Cau
casians have an 81 percent chance
of finding a donor through the na
tional icgistry.
According to Karen Seth, out
reach coordinator at American
Asijm Donor Program (AADP),
Kuo's chances of finding a match
are much slimmer because he's
\sian. She estimates his chances
are one in 20,(HX) to one in 30,(XX).
AADP has helped promote
K no's cause by promoting minority
bone marrow drives throughout
the Hay Area. In August and Sep
teniber, they added 1,699 Asians to
Ihe national registry. Two weeks
ago, they registered 989 Asians
dining a three day drive at LJC-
Ik-rkeley.
A donation drive has been
scheduled ;it Stanford for Oct. 7 and
8. In addition, Kuo's friends and
family have organized bone mar
iow drives in Singapore, Taiwan,
:m<l Hong Kong in recent months.
I he NMDP works with these reg
is! lies to increase their pool of can
didate donors. Despite this interna
tional effort, Kuo is still without a
match.

Kuo and his family have been
amazed by the response his case has
received. As Seth noted, "There is
something special about Alan's
case which strikes a cord in people."
The guest book at his web site has
notes from people all over the
world who are rallying behind him.
"Don't give up till the last nanosec
ond. You not only have your caring
family members around, you also
have our blessing," writes a young
woman from Taiwan.
Stanford students have a chance
to make a difference in Kuo's life
on Oct. 7 and 8. A A DP, in conjunc
tion with the fraternity Lambda Phi
Epsilon and the graduate student
group Bio Mass, is sponsoring a
drive on campus. People can sign
up as bone marrow donors at two
sites, either in White Plaza or at the
medical student lounge in the Med
ical Center.
Volunteers will be staffing tables
at both sites from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
both days. For additional informa

AADP coordinator, at 1-800-59-
