# Donors urgently needed

Three years ago, Alan Kuo was on top of the world. I lav
ing earned his doctoral degree from Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, he moved to the Bay Area to begin a post
doctoral fellowship in an AIDS research laboratory at IJC-
San Francisco. His enthusiasm for scientific research was at
an all-time high. He was healthy, eager to explore the leg
endary beauty of the northern California coast.

A few months later, during a routine check-up, he learned that he wasn't
as healthy as he had thought. A blood test revealed abnormally high num
bers of white blood cells in his circulatory system. Further testing confirmed
that Kuo has chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood
in which the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells.
The only known cure for his condition is a bone marrow transplant from
a healthy donor.
CML, which is caused by a mutated chromosome, is like a bomb waiting
to go off. In its early stages, the cancerous cells are found only 111 the bone
marrow and are a minor component of the marrow cell population. At the
more advanced stage, the number of cancerous or "blast" cells increases
dramatically, spilling out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream.
It can take years for the disease to progress from the chronic to the acute
stage, and the event that triggers this transition is unknown.
In July, Kuo's world exploded. The number of cancerous cells in his
body had increased to the point where he was experiencing a high fever,
nausea, aches and pains. I le had entered the blast crisis stage ol ( ML, and
the prognosis was not good.
"Alan is really running out of time," said his oncologist at IJCSF, Dr.
Hope Rugo. Without a transplant from a matched donor, a person in his
condition has an estimated three to six months to live.
Despite long odds, Kuo, his family and friends haven't given up hope.
They have launched a campaign that is now global, thanks to e mail and the
Internet, in the hopes of finding a suitable donor. "I le has such a great spir
it â€” he can't not make it. All it takes is one person," says his friend Akiko
Hall.
That special individual must share the same white blood cell markers,
called human leukocyte antigens (lILAs), as Kuo. Like eye and skin color,
these antigens are inherited characteristics. I ialf of the antigens are passed
down from the mother, and the other half are passed down from the father.
Because of this genetic component, patients have the best chance of finding
a donor among people who share their ethnic background. For Kuo, this
means someone of Asian descent.
Currently 2.K million volunteer marrow donors are registered with the
National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). Of these, only 1(S0,(K)0 or IS.h
percent are Asian-Americans.
The probability that two unrelated individuals will share the same 1 11 As
varies widely depending on the frequency of the individual antigens in the
