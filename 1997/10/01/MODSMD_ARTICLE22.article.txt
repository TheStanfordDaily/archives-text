# GPS stiffens space station
##

As designs for space stations
become increasingly larger, main
taining stability is a major problem.
Massive space stations have a ten
dency to vibrate easily and go
through violent oscillations.
Although adding rigidity to the
space station would increase stabili
ty, more rigid space stations would
be less cost-effective. Using a flexi
ble structure can allow space sta
tions to be lighter and larger at the
same time without sacrificing any
thing but stability.
Dr. Harrison 'league, a former
doctoral student at Stanford, has
developed a control system that
uses signals from the Global Posi
tioning System (the Department of
Defense's satellite navigation sys
tem) to maintain stability on large,
flexible structures, such as space sta
tions.
Teague's system uses GPS
receivers attached to different por
tions of the space station that detect
movements with centimeter-level
accuracy. If movement is detected,
the system fires compressed air
thrusters to reverse the movement
and stabilize the structure. The sys
tem has the ability to make a flexi
ble structure behave as if it were a
rigid body.
"I think it's amazing that we can
obtain centimeter-level accuracy
using signals coming from 20,(XX)
miles away," said l eague.
league also developed proce
dures that could control highly deli
cate motions such as docking and

undocking of capsules because
these processes can cause major
changes in the dynamic properties
of space structures.
In order to test his system,
l eague constructed a large flexible
structure consisting of three 100-
pound aluminum blocks connected
by two long elastic aluminum tubes
in a straight line. Each block had
two arms containing a GPS sensor
and four compressed air thrusters.
The structure was supported by 12
threads from an overhead crane.
The test structure could simulate
many motions, including free rota
tion in the horizontal plane.
Because the test area was
indoors, league had to use anten
nas that simulated a GPS satellite.
The receivers sent the data from the
antennas to a computer that con
tained a detailed model of the test
structure. The computer calculated

the timing and (Juration of the air
blasts necessary to stabilize the
structure.
league has done demonstrations
where he has moved the structure in
the horizontal plane while rotating
it in the center by 35 degrees. The
structure, although very flexible,
behaves like a rigid body even dui
ing the most rapid movement.
Another test involved manually
moving one of the arms and then
letting the system stabilize itself
Almost immediately, the thrusters
moved the arm hack into its proper
position.
Space stations are not the only
structures that could benefit from
league's stabilization system
"There are many land-based flexi
ble structures such as bridges that
could use this system to analyze
movements in the structures and
possibly find flaws," l eague said.
