Stanford hosts ethics conference on
Alzheimer's disease

Recent developments in genetic
techniques have riveted the eyes of
the world on the scientific communi
ty. As a result, more and more
researchers are emphasizing the
importance of ethics in genetic
research. As part of an ongoing plan

to present genetics with an ethical face, Stanford will
host an ethics conference discussing the implications
of genetic testing for Alzheimer's disease on Oct. 25.
New findings have confirmed the role of genetics
in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and a
realistic chance now exists for the development of a
test to detect genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's. If
such tests are developed, ethical questions will need
to be addressed regarding the implications of such
testing on society.
The conference, titled "Genetic testing and
Alzheimer disease: Has the time come?" is the sec
ond annual conference of Stanford's Program in
Genomics, Ethics and Society (PGES). It will bring
together experts from various fields, such as medicine
and law, for an all-day meeting to discuss the ethical
questions surrounding genetic testing.
Among the presentations scheduled for the con
ference will be a panel on the genetics of Alzheimer's
moderated by Paul Berg, director of Stanford's Beck
man Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
Other presentations include panels discussing the
impact of the disease on family members and care
givers of Alzheimer's patients.

Visiting experts to teach new Hum
Bio courses

This year's Human Biology majors
will be taught by visiting faculty rang
ing from a Nobel Prize winner to the
former assistant secretary of health of
the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
-J Baruch Blumberg, a professor of

medicine and anthropology at the University of Penn
sylvania, won a Nobel Prize for his work on the Hep
atitis B virus. This year, he is teaching a fall quarter
Human Biology course titled "Epidemics, Evolution
and Ethics." The infectious disease expert is support
ed by an endowment intended to bring visiting lec
turers to Stanford to teach in the Human Biology
Program.
The former Department of Health and Human
Services official, Philip Lee, will teach a senior hon
ors colloquium on health policy. Lee is a former
chancellor of the UC-San Francisco and founder of
the Institute for Health Policy Studies at that institu
tion. He will teach along with Donald Barr, a physi
cian and sociologist who is now head of the health
policy track within the human biology major.
Other new faculty joining human biology are
nutritionist and dietitian Gail Butterfield and sports
medicine expert Gordon Matheson. Both will lead
another new concentration within the major, titled
"Health and Human Performance." They will teach a
variety of classes in the fields of nutrition, cardiovascu
lar disease, exercise physiology and sports medicine.
Armin Rosencranz, a former director of the
Human Biology Program and an environmental
lawyer will also begin a new track, called "enviro
mental policy."
