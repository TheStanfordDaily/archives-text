But she's got to be tired — tired.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ SUNDAY: Stanford (3-5) vs. Colorado College
at New Maloney Field, 3 p.m.

The fifth-year senior who is renowned for her
quickness has been a workhorse for Stanford ath
letics throughout her time on the Farm, donating
eight seasons to the school over five years — on
the tennis court and the soccer field.
Burt's career at Stanford is on its final leg. This
season is her last as a soccer player, and her tennis
eligibility ran out last year. So next spring will be a
rarity for Burt: a quarter without a sport to play.
"It will be nice to have an off-season this year,
because I've always been playing sports every
spring and fall," she admits. "I will get to be a nor
mal student for once."
Burt could be one of the most successful col
lege athletes Stanford has ever produced. In her
four years as a No. 2 and 3 doubles player for the
Cardinal tennis team, the squad never finished
lower than third in the nation and won an NCAA
championship last year.
Burt has brought the soccer team her magic
touch as well. ITie team finished No. 2 and No. 5
her first two seasons, lost to Santa Clara in the
NCAA tournament last year and is currently
ranked No. 17, with Pacific 10 Conference play
yet to begin.
Despite the tremendous success of all Burt's
teams, she said that this year's team is second to
none in one category: chemistry.
"This team is the closest I've ever been on,"
she said. "We all have a lot in common. We hang
out a lot and always get along. I love my team
mates."
Burt's soccer career has traveled a winding path.
Her first two soccer seasons — when she was nine

and 10 years old— were spent on an all-boys team
in an East Palo Alto soccer league, the closest
league to her Menlo Park home. She spent the next
few years on an American Youth Soccer Organi
zation team, playing against other girls her age.
Then, after seventh grade, she dropped soccer
altogether.
"I wasn't planning on playing in high school or
anything, and soccer was taking up most of my
time," she said. "I wanted to concentrate on ten
nis."
After three years away from the sport, Burt
took a circuitous route back in.
"My best friend, who had played on the all
boys team with me when I was nine, persuaded
me to come out for soccer my junior year in high
school," she said.
Soccer in junior year of high school snowballed
into soccer that summer with the (Mympic Youth
Development Program (OYDP), a youth league
not affiliated with her high school. And it just so
happened that Burt's OYDP coach was the wife
of the women's soccer coach at Stanford.
"I wasn't planning on playing soccer in col
lege," Burt said, "but I started asking my coach if
she thought I could make the team at Stanford, if
I could play that well."
The answer intrigued Burt, and she "started
getting more into it. I started playing a lot more."
When she came to Stanford in IW3, Burt
jumped right into the starting lineup, starting in 21
of 22 matches.
"I was really surprised," she said.
In IW4, her sophomore year, Burt was one of
just five players to start in all 20 matches as the
Cardinal advanced to the NCAA Final Four. She
ranked second on the team in goals, points and
shots on goal and earned first-team All l'ac-10
Academic honors.
Despite her unexpected early success, Burt
opted to sit out the soccer season during her junior
year. With only one sport to concentrate on, Burt
notched a 3-0 dual-match record in singles com
petition and a 7-0 doubles record in helping the
tennis team to a second-place finish at the N( A A
Championships.

But Burt hardly skipped a heat upon her return
to the soccer field last season, Steve Swanson's
first as head coach. Burt led the Cardinal in goals,
was elected team MVP and earned second-team
All-Pac-10 honors.

Now, after
three years of
Stanford soc
cer experi
ence, Burt
an All-Ameri
ca candidate
has reached
the apex of her
career.

"She's a great opportunist, she gets us into great

She became the natural leader for this year's
team, along with senior co-captain Elie Foster.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ SUNDAY: Stanford (3-5) vs. Colorado College
at New Maloney Field, 3 p.m.

The fifth-year senior who is renowned for her
quickness has been a workhorse for Stanford ath
letics throughout her time on the Farm, donating
eight seasons to the school over five years — on
the tennis court and the soccer field.
Burt's career at Stanford is on its final leg. This
season is her last as a soccer player, and her tennis
eligibility ran out last year. So next spring will be a
rarity for Burt: a quarter without a sport to play.
"It will be nice to have an off-season this year,
because I've always been playing sports every
spring and fall," she admits. "I will get to be a nor
mal student for once."
Burt could be one of the most successful col
lege athletes Stanford has ever produced. In her
four years as a No. 2 and 3 doubles player for the
Cardinal tennis team, the squad never finished
lower than third in the nation and won an NCAA
championship last year.
Burt has brought the soccer team her magic
touch as well. ITie team finished No. 2 and No. 5
her first two seasons, lost to Santa Clara in the
NCAA tournament last year and is currently
ranked No. 17, with Pacific 10 Conference play
yet to begin.
Despite the tremendous success of all Burt's
teams, she said that this year's team is second to
none in one category: chemistry.
"This team is the closest I've ever been on,"
she said. "We all have a lot in common. We hang
out a lot and always get along. I love my team
mates."
Burt's soccer career has traveled a winding path.
Her first two soccer seasons — when she was nine

and 10 years old— were spent on an all-boys team
in an East Palo Alto soccer league, the closest
league to her Menlo Park home. She spent the next
few years on an American Youth Soccer Organi
zation team, playing against other girls her age.
Then, after seventh grade, she dropped soccer
altogether.
"I wasn't planning on playing in high school or
anything, and soccer was taking up most of my
time," she said. "I wanted to concentrate on ten
nis."
After three years away from the sport, Burt
took a circuitous route back in.
"My best friend, who had played on the all
boys team with me when I was nine, persuaded
me to come out for soccer my junior year in high
school," she said.
Soccer in junior year of high school snowballed
into soccer that summer with the (Mympic Youth
Development Program (OYDP), a youth league
not affiliated with her high school. And it just so
happened that Burt's OYDP coach was the wife
of the women's soccer coach at Stanford.
"I wasn't planning on playing soccer in col
lege," Burt said, "but I started asking my coach if
she thought I could make the team at Stanford, if
I could play that well."
The answer intrigued Burt, and she "started
getting more into it. I started playing a lot more."
When she came to Stanford in IW3, Burt
jumped right into the starting lineup, starting in 21
of 22 matches.
"I was really surprised," she said.
In IW4, her sophomore year, Burt was one of
just five players to start in all 20 matches as the
Cardinal advanced to the NCAA Final Four. She
ranked second on the team in goals, points and
shots on goal and earned first-team All l'ac-10
Academic honors.
Despite her unexpected early success, Burt
opted to sit out the soccer season during her junior
year. With only one sport to concentrate on, Burt
notched a 3-0 dual-match record in singles com
petition and a 7-0 doubles record in helping the
tennis team to a second-place finish at the N( A A
Championships.

But Burt hardly skipped a heat upon her return
to the soccer field last season, Steve Swanson's
first as head coach. Burt led the Cardinal in goals,
was elected team MVP and earned second-team
All-Pac-10 honors.

Now, after
three years of
Stanford soc
cer experi
ence, Burt
an All-Ameri
ca candidate
has reached
the apex of her
career.
"We've re

ate chances and score goals," Swanson said.
"She's a great opportunist, she gets us into great
positions."
She became the natural leader for this year's
team, along with senior co-captain Elie Foster.
"With such a young squad, she really helps
bring the players along," Swanson said. "Leader
ship is a large part of what she does."
But Burt modestly shrugs off the importance
of her role.
"Everyone on this team |is a leader) by na
ture," she said. "To come here, you have to have
that in your nature. We are co-captains by name,
but everyone's on the same level."
But as her athletics career at Stanford reaches
its end, Burt is sure that her life in soccer is far
from over.
"There has been talk of starting a professional
women's soccer league," she said. "And that is
something that I would definitely not rule out."
At the very least, she said, she will continue to
play club soccer, although the level of competition
will probably not equal that of collegiate soccer.
But in true Burt fashion, the graduate student
who only has three quarters left on the Farm re
fuses to worry about specifics.
"I haven't really thought about my future yet,"
she admits. "I probably should some day."
