## 10-1 odds? Scared Cal wins, 21-18

Editor's note: When Stanford
meets California Nov. 22 at Stan
ford Stadium, it will mark the
l(X)th Big Game. To celebrate the
history of the cross-Bay rivalry,
The Daily will reprint stories of
classic Big Games, each with its
original body and headline. This

week's Big Game of the Week features the s('th Big
Game, a 1947 near-upset by the winless Cardinal that
California won on a late rally.

Marchie Schwartz was wrong.
He had prophesied that the Indians would win one
game this year.
They didn't. They lost their ninth in a row, the sea
son's finale, the Big Game, to California by the slender
margin of three extra points, 21 to 18, before 85,000
delirious onlookers in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
But it doesn't really matter that Marchie was wrong.
It doesn't matter at all. Stanford's 10 to 1 underdogs, on
the shortest end of the longest odds of any Big Game,
pushed California all over the field, had them shaken
and frantic before finally going down to deleat in the
fourth quarter of what may well have been the greatest
game in the 50-year history of this football classic.
Weird play
Victory c; ne for the Bears on a weird 80-yard pass
play from fullback Jack Jensen to halfback Haul Keck
ley, with less than four minutes remaining in the final
period.
Up to that point it had been anybody's ball game,
and even more unbelievable than that, for some eight
impossible, amazing minutes in the fourth quarter it
had been Stanford's ball game, 18-14.
Then, while the massive California rooting section
sat stunned and silent at the prospect of a Stanford tri
umph, Jensen took a shovel-lateral from quarterback
Bob Celeri, ran to his right and threw diagonally across
the field to Keckley, standing in the clear on Stanford's
40. His pass was short. Keckley had to come back to
ward the line of scrimmage and make an almost-shoe
string catch of the ball.
He wriggled through the Indian secondary and
sprinted 60 yards to the end zone, with Stanford's
Kendall Peck making a desperate attempt at a leaping
tackle from behind on the five-yard line.
Cullom converts
Jim Cullom. big California guard, calmly booted
home the conversion, as he had done twice before in
the game, and the Bears had their 21st point, and that
was that.
It was a California victory — as expected, but it was
a very hollow victory.

I"he close-to-capacity crowd had expected an over
whelming display of California power. Instead it saw
inspired Stanford power.
Ilie crowd had expected Jensen, Celeri, Dick Er
ickson and George Fong to run and pass the Bears to a
leisurely, lopsided win. Instead it saw brilliant Indian
performances by game captain George Quist, by quar
terbacks Ainslie Bell and Don Campbell, and by a
Stanford line that held tenaciously on defense and
opened gaping holes on offense — performances that
almost earned for Stanford the biggest upset in half a
century of Big Games.
Bears score early
While the late arrivals were still looking for their
seats, the Bears, starting from their 36-yard line after
receiving the opening kickoff, marched 64 yards to
their first touchdown in six plays. When halfback Ted
Kenfield broke through over his own right tackle and
dashed the last 30 yards into pay dirt, the game was
only three and a half minutes old.
Cullom added the extra point to make the score 7 to
0, and the crowd settled back to watch a good old-fash
ioned, scientific slaughter.
Then Stanford got its first offensive chance after
Martin Anderson returned the Bears' kickoff to the In
dian 27. Marty tried the center of the line with that
beautiful and previously successful fake pass and
handoff play from Ainslie Bell. He didn't gain an inch.
Bob Anderson attempted to skirt right end on second
down, but he too was held for no gain. Bell passed in
complete on third down. Three plays with no gain at
all.
It looked like the same feeble, ineffectual Indian of
fense that had had its nose rubbed into the dirt by every
opponent Stanford had met this season.
Cards revive
But just before the end of the first quarter, the Indi
ans did a complete about-face and began to move.
Starting from their own 32 after Quist had lost three
yards on a running play, Bell whipped a long pass to
end Dan Mevin, gixnl for 40 yards and a first down on
California's 28. Quist hit right tackle for four. Dave
Field galloped around right end to the 17, aided by a
perfect block by tackle Atherton Phleger, and Stan
ford had another first down as the second quarter got
under way.
Quist was held for a two-yard gain at right guard.
Martin Anderson lost one yard at right tackle. Wayne
Erickson made five yards to the 11 around left end.
Then, on fourth down with four yards to go, Bell shot a
pinpoint pass to Wayne Erickson, who made the catch
in the end zone behind the guarding of Cal's Jim Muir.
Quist's conversion attempt was wide, and the Bears
still led, 7 to 6.

Long drive
They went further out in front in
the waning minutes of the first half,
on a sustained drive which carried
from the California 20. Fong made
the touchdown through right guard
from the one-yard line. Cullom's
conversion was good. California, 14
to 6.
In the third quarter, Stanford's
surprisingly effective defense kept
California completely bottled up in
its own territory — stopping the
Bears' ground attack cold and spoil
ing Celeri's passing attempts.
Finally the terrific pressure ap
plied by the Indians began to pay off.
Stanford took over after a Jensen
punt on the California 36. Bell passed

to end Gene Martin for 16 yards and
a first down on the 20. Erickson made
two yards at left tackle. Bell passed
again, this time to Erickson, for five
yards.
An offside penalty against Cali
fornia gave Stanford a first down on
the Bears' eight-yard line. Bob An
derson made three at left guard.
Then Wayne Erickson took a shovel
lateral from Bell and scooted around
left end into the end zone without
being touched.
Kick blocked
Quist's conversion attempt was
blocked. But Stanford had narrowed
down the gap, 14 to 12.
What happened after that was
absolutely unbelievable. C enter
Dick Flatland recovered a Califor
nia fumble on Stanford's 34-yard
line, and Stanford went all the way
to its third touchdown in eiijht

plays, climaxed by Don Campbell's
over-the-center pass to Bob Ander
son in the end zone from 11 yards
out.
Quist missed again on the extra
point try, but nobody cared. Stanford
was actually ahead 18 to 14.
And they stayed ahead for eight
glorious minutes, while the Indian
rooting section, alumni and well
wishers went stark raving mad with
joy.
But it couldn't last. California
would not be denied. The Bears con
nected on that nightmare Jensen to
Keckley pass minutes before the
final gun, and that's the way it ended.
California 21, Stanford 18.
The Indians lost the Big One as
they had lost the eight others. But in
losing they played one of the greatest
games of football ever witnessed in
Stanford Stadium, or on any gridiron
for that matter.

ley, with less than four minutes remaining in the final
period.
Up to that point it had been anybody's ball game,
and even more unbelievable than that, for some eight
impossible, amazing minutes in the fourth quarter it
had been Stanford's ball game, 18-14.
Then, while the massive California rooting section
sat stunned and silent at the prospect of a Stanford tri
umph, Jensen took a shovel-lateral from quarterback
Bob Celeri, ran to his right and threw diagonally across
the field to Keckley, standing in the clear on Stanford's
40. His pass was short. Keckley had to come back to
ward the line of scrimmage and make an almost-shoe
string catch of the ball.
He wriggled through the Indian secondary and
sprinted 60 yards to the end zone, with Stanford's
Kendall Peck making a desperate attempt at a leaping
tackle from behind on the five-yard line.
Cullom converts
Jim Cullom. big California guard, calmly booted
home the conversion, as he had done twice before in
the game, and the Bears had their 21st point, and that
was that.
It was a California victory — as expected, but it was
a very hollow victory.

I"he close-to-capacity crowd had expected an over
whelming display of California power. Instead it saw
inspired Stanford power.
Ilie crowd had expected Jensen, Celeri, Dick Er
ickson and George Fong to run and pass the Bears to a
leisurely, lopsided win. Instead it saw brilliant Indian
performances by game captain George Quist, by quar
terbacks Ainslie Bell and Don Campbell, and by a
Stanford line that held tenaciously on defense and
opened gaping holes on offense — performances that
almost earned for Stanford the biggest upset in half a
century of Big Games.
Bears score early
While the late arrivals were still looking for their
seats, the Bears, starting from their 36-yard line after
receiving the opening kickoff, marched 64 yards to
their first touchdown in six plays. When halfback Ted
Kenfield broke through over his own right tackle and
dashed the last 30 yards into pay dirt, the game was
only three and a half minutes old.
Cullom added the extra point to make the score 7 to
0, and the crowd settled back to watch a good old-fash
ioned, scientific slaughter.
Then Stanford got its first offensive chance after
Martin Anderson returned the Bears' kickoff to the In
dian 27. Marty tried the center of the line with that
beautiful and previously successful fake pass and
handoff play from Ainslie Bell. He didn't gain an inch.
Bob Anderson attempted to skirt right end on second
down, but he too was held for no gain. Bell passed in
complete on third down. Three plays with no gain at
all.
It looked like the same feeble, ineffectual Indian of
fense that had had its nose rubbed into the dirt by every
opponent Stanford had met this season.
Cards revive
But just before the end of the first quarter, the Indi
ans did a complete about-face and began to move.
Starting from their own 32 after Quist had lost three
yards on a running play, Bell whipped a long pass to
end Dan Mevin, gixnl for 40 yards and a first down on
California's 28. Quist hit right tackle for four. Dave
Field galloped around right end to the 17, aided by a
perfect block by tackle Atherton Phleger, and Stan
ford had another first down as the second quarter got
under way.
Quist was held for a two-yard gain at right guard.
Martin Anderson lost one yard at right tackle. Wayne
Erickson made five yards to the 11 around left end.
Then, on fourth down with four yards to go, Bell shot a
pinpoint pass to Wayne Erickson, who made the catch
in the end zone behind the guarding of Cal's Jim Muir.
Quist's conversion attempt was wide, and the Bears
still led, 7 to 6.

Long drive
They went further out in front in
the waning minutes of the first half,
on a sustained drive which carried
from the California 20. Fong made
the touchdown through right guard
from the one-yard line. Cullom's
conversion was good. California, 14
to 6.
In the third quarter, Stanford's
surprisingly effective defense kept
California completely bottled up in
its own territory — stopping the
Bears' ground attack cold and spoil
ing Celeri's passing attempts.
Finally the terrific pressure ap
plied by the Indians began to pay off.
Stanford took over after a Jensen
punt on the California 36. Bell passed

to end Gene Martin for 16 yards and
a first down on the 20. Erickson made
two yards at left tackle. Bell passed
again, this time to Erickson, for five
yards.
An offside penalty against Cali
fornia gave Stanford a first down on
the Bears' eight-yard line. Bob An
derson made three at left guard.
Then Wayne Erickson took a shovel
lateral from Bell and scooted around
left end into the end zone without
being touched.
Kick blocked
Quist's conversion attempt was
blocked. But Stanford had narrowed
down the gap, 14 to 12.
What happened after that was
absolutely unbelievable. C enter
Dick Flatland recovered a Califor
nia fumble on Stanford's 34-yard
line, and Stanford went all the way
to its third touchdown in eiijht

plays, climaxed by Don Campbell's
over-the-center pass to Bob Ander
son in the end zone from 11 yards
out.
Quist missed again on the extra
point try, but nobody cared. Stanford
was actually ahead 18 to 14.
And they stayed ahead for eight
glorious minutes, while the Indian
rooting section, alumni and well
wishers went stark raving mad with
joy.
But it couldn't last. California
would not be denied. The Bears con
nected on that nightmare Jensen to
Keckley pass minutes before the
final gun, and that's the way it ended.
California 21, Stanford 18.
The Indians lost the Big One as
they had lost the eight others. But in
losing they played one of the greatest
games of football ever witnessed in
Stanford Stadium, or on any gridiron
for that matter.
Editor's note: When Stanford
meets California Nov. 22 at Stan
ford Stadium, it will mark the
l(X)th Big Game. To celebrate the
history of the cross-Bay rivalry,
The Daily will reprint stories of
classic Big Games, each with its
original body and headline. This

week's Big Game of the Week features the s('th Big
Game, a 1947 near-upset by the winless Cardinal that
California won on a late rally.

Marchie Schwartz was wrong.
He had prophesied that the Indians would win one
game this year.
They didn't. They lost their ninth in a row, the sea
son's finale, the Big Game, to California by the slender
margin of three extra points, 21 to 18, before 85,000
delirious onlookers in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
But it doesn't really matter that Marchie was wrong.
It doesn't matter at all. Stanford's 10 to 1 underdogs, on
the shortest end of the longest odds of any Big Game,
pushed California all over the field, had them shaken
and frantic before finally going down to deleat in the
fourth quarter of what may well have been the greatest
game in the 50-year history of this football classic.
