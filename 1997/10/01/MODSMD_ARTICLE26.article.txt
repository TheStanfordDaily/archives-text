SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Try as
he does to ignore it, Notre Dame
coach Bob Davie can't help but hear
the sniping.

FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAY: No. 19Stanford (3-
I) vs. Notre Dame (1-3) at Stanford
Stadium, 12:30 p.m. TV: ABC (STV
Channels 27 and 31). Radio: KZSU
FM9O.I

With a 1 -3 record after Saturday's
21-14 loss to Michigan, he's gone
from being the cure to what's been
ailing Notre Dame to the worst thing
since Gerry Faust. I le's too much of
a player's coach. He's so nice his
players aren't afraid of losing any
more. He's not fiery enough. In
short, he's not Lou 1 loltz.
Tough, Davie says. You don't
like his style, go watch someone else.
Like Tony Dungy's Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, maybe.
"A year ago, Tampa Bay
was.. .1-8. A lot of people were talk
ing about Tony Dungy at that time.
He was a first-time head coach. Was
he tough enough? Was he vocal
enough? All those things," said
Davie, who turned 43 on Tuesday.
"Perception is not always reali
ty," he said. "Tony Dungy is a prime
example of someone who is today
what he was last year. And that foot
ball team is 5-0."
He may have been using Dungy's
name, but it was clear Davie was
talking about himself. He doesn't
blame or berate his players. If he's
going to chew someone out, he'll do
it in private. He's as honest as possi
ble when talking about the team's
failings. He's tried to make football
fun for the Irish.
But that doesn't mean he's a
pushover. And his coaching style is
not the reason the Irish are 1 -3 head
ing into Saturday's game at No. 19
Stanford.
"People don't really watch us
practice, people don't really watch
those tapes and people don't really
know exactly how you coach be
cause they're not around a whole

lot," he saiil.
Because Davie ha<J been Holtz's
defensive coordinator for three
years, fans expected an easy transi
tion when he took over. Alter all,
he'd been around the program, he
knew how things worked at Notre
Dame and he had most of the of
fense coming back.
Instead, the Irish have struggled.
I"he offense was stuck in neutral
until the Michigan game, and every
one's run over the defense. Fans
were shocked and upset, and it
didn't take long before they were
making lists of possible replace
ments for Davie. T.ven I loltz said he
expected better.
What everyone forgets is that tins
isn't the same team as last year,
Davie said. I le's new to being a head
coach. I le put in new schemes. He's
got new offensive and defensive co
ordinators.

" There's still a major transition
going on in this program," he said.
"It was still a new program and a
new start. That's why I've remained
consistent and have not panicked,
because I fully w;is aware of that all
through the process."
(ietting Notre I )ame to where he
wants it to be is-going to take some
time, just like it did with Dungy's
Hues. Davie knows the Irish fans
aren't exactly the most patient in the
world, and he accepts that
In fact, he sympathizes with
them.
"You know, I enjoy coaching at a
place where people really care, and I
mean that sincerely. ()ne of the most
surprising parts of this job is just the
mail and the suggestions and the let
ters of encouragement and things
that vou get,'' he said.
