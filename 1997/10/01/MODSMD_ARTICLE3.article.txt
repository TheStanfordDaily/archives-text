# Part of Row under water
## Broken hydrant causes flooding on Dolores St. 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
Residents of houses along Do
lores Street near Slavianskii Dom
and Theta Xi were surprised yes
terday afternoon to see the street
flooded with muddy water running
downhill onto Mayfield Avenue.
About five minutes later the po
lice and fire department showed up
at the source of the flooding, a bro
ken fire hydrant on San Juan
Court, where new housing for fac
ulty is currently being built. Jim
Clark, an employee of Pete Moffet,
the contractor working at the site,
ran over the hydrant at the con
struction site in a red Ford truck.
There was a fountain of water
erupting 10 to 15 feet into the air
from the broken hydrant, which
normally sustains water pressures
of anywhere from Wto 120 pounds
