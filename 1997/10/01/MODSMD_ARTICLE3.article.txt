# Part of Row under water
## Broken hydrant causes flooding on Dolores St. 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
Residents of houses along Do
lores Street near Slavianskii Dom
and Theta Xi were surprised yes
terday afternoon to see the street
flooded with muddy water running
downhill onto Mayfield Avenue.
About five minutes later the po
lice and fire department showed up
at the source of the flooding, a bro
ken fire hydrant on San Juan
Court, where new housing for fac
ulty is currently being built. Jim
Clark, an employee of Pete Moffet,
the contractor working at the site,
ran over the hydrant at the con
struction site in a red Ford truck.
There was a fountain of water
erupting 10 to 15 feet into the air
from the broken hydrant, which
normally sustains water pressures
of anywhere from Wto 120 pounds
per square inch, according the fire
men at the scene.
"There were several pedestri
ans, and I was more concerned
about them, and I lost track of
where I was," Clark said, adding
that he backed into the hydrant
very slowly. "I was only going two,
maybe three miles per hour.'
The policeman at the scene took
a statement from Clark, but said no

charges would be filed against him.
"Accidents happen, this was just
an accident, the policeman said.
For nearly 40 minutes, the hy
drant spewed water while C lark
and the firemen attempted to cut
the flow of water into the hydrant.
They shut the valve and water
stopped flowing from the hydrant
shortly before 6 p.m.
After surveying the scene, Clark
said there was no damage to the on
going construction, and once all the
materials dried out work would
continue on the housing.
