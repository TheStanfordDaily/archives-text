# Two new graduate residences open amidst housing shortage
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
At r ♦ :ne when housing opportunities for graduates are in
high demand, two new residences have opened their doors to
more than 5»(X) lucky students.
One of the new dorms — Lyman Graduate Residences

was formally dedicated yesterday in a ribbon-cutting ceremo
ny. I Jniversity President Gerhard Casper, Senior Assoc. Dean
of the School of Engineering John Bravman and Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais all spoke at the gathering on Lyman grounds.
Together, they honored Richard Lyman, Stanford's sev
enth president, for whom the building complex was named.

University President Gerhard Casper chats with graduate students during a ceremony opening the common build
ing of the new Lyman Graduate Residences.
Noting that graduates today
make up for more than half the stu
dent population, Casper said he
was glad the University could serve
more of them.
"Graduate students have differ
ent needs than undergraduates,"
Casper said. Hut "they also have so
cial needs perhaps better met by liv
ing in a community setting."
A total of 224 rooms or 112
apartment units make up Lyman,
which is located behind the under
graduate residences of Sterling
Quad and Governor's Corner.
Out of the 280 beds in Schwab,
60 of them are set aside for corpo
rate executives who will be visiting
throughout the school year, accord
ing to Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Dining Services.
"Schwab is designed to be the
center for executive education
groups," he said.
In both Lyman and Schwab, two
students are assigned to share a unit
made up of two bedrooms and a
common room. While Lyman resi

dents share a bathroom and
kitchen, a private bathroom is
available to every Schwab resident.
"It's great," said economics
graduate student Daniel Eisenberg,
who said he had to draw at least 8(X)
out of 3,000 for his room in Lyman.
"The common rooms look great,
and the rent is comparable to [Es
condido Village] and Rains. The
only problem now is ants."
A last minute spurt in the con
struction process allowed the
brand-new building to look pre
sentable at the dedication, as much
of the residence was not completed
when the students started arriving
this month.
For law students who started
school the first week of September,
this delay was an especial inconve
nience.
"When I came three weeks ago,
only their top two floors were
done," said first-year law student
John Cauffman, who last year lived
in Crothers Hall.
A central feature of Lyman is
the Commons building, designed to
host social events such as barbe
cues, concerts and picnics. Built
around a large oak tree and featur

ing a large deck, the common space
is unique to the Stanford campus,
according to James Kelly, Lyman
Facility Projects Manager.
"It's an opportunity for under
graduates and graduates living
nearby to co-mingle," he said.
"Everybody seems to be really ex
cited about the place. I think it's a
win for the campus. The personal
feedback I've gotten from students
and parents is very, very positive."
"Before, Rains was sort of the
model for graduate housing," he
said. "Now, we are becoming the
new standard."
The main common building con
sists of a mailroom — to be opened
within the next few days — a laun
dry room, a piano room, a comput
er cluster and several lounges.
Even with the addition of these
houses, however, the prevailing
problem of graduate student hous
ing remains unsolved.
"We need both of these resi
dences to meet the demand for
graduate housing on campus," Guy
said. "Even with them added, it's
not enough, but we're happy
they're going to be completed and
occupied this quarter."

"There's more demand than
there are beds available," Guy
added.
This year, more than 500 gradu
ate students who applied for on
campus housing were unassigned.
Guy said there were no specific
plans to add more residences at this
point.
Although most residents agree
that they just feel lucky to live on
campus — particularly in the new
spacious residences — virtually all
say parking is a nightmare.
While graduate students living
in Schwab fight over space with
Toyon undergraduates, Lyman res
idents must share a common west
campus lot with undergraduates
living in Governor's Corner and
Sterling Quad, as well as visitors to
the nearby golf driving range.
"Eventually, you find a space,
but it's far — at least a five-minute
walk," said Cauffman, who com
mented that a lot of his classmates
ended up having to find housing off
campus. "Apparently, this place
was hard to get in, and we [here] are
psyched about this place. I'm think
ing about taking up golf now to help
out my law career."
