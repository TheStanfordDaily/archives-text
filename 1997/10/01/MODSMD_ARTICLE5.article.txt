# Social dance students charged $50 fee

Due to budget cuts in the dance divi
sion, the popular Dance 46: "Social
Dances of North America I" is charging a
$50 fee for the first time since its estab
lishment.
There have been several complaints
from students who wrongly believe that
the new fee is just a ploy to cut down the

surplus of interest in the class, said
Richard Powers, a drama lecturer who is
an instructor in the class.
Although it is true that the usually
long waiting list was reduced, the $50 is
being used to offset a large budget cut
that was handed down to the dance pro
gram just before it merged with the
Drama Department last year, he said.
The dance program was kept intact
during the IW6-97 academic year, but it

encountered a budget si rtfall this year.
" The option of chargn g a fee for the
social dance courses, patterned on the
fees for music lessons in the Music De
partment and other course fees in the
University, allowed us to keep a full of
fering of courses for this year," s.
Drama Prof. Charles Lyons, the depart
ment's chair.
"Every year, we came up with reative
ways of meeting the budget short
falls, but this year, drama and the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences decided on charging the
$50," said Powers.
The dance division then approved
the fee.
The size of the class is exactly

the same as without the fee, and
the students are told that "the fee
is contributing to the welfare and
survival of the entire dance divi
sion," Powers said. "They have
the honor of being the ones who
help the dance division continue
though the budget cut," he said.
This fee is regarded as an exper
imental method of offsetting the
effects of the budget cut and will be
reviewed at the end of this year.
