## Lawsuit filed to stop Stanford-UCSF merger 
### Leslie A. Gordon 
Three unions representing workers at UC-San
Francisco have filed a lawsuit attempting to block
the ongoing merger between their school's medical
center and Stanford's.
The lawsuit, filed Sept. 23 in Alameda County
Superior Court, was brought by the California Nurs
es Association, the University Professional and
Technical Employees union, and the American Fed
eration of State, County and Municipal Employees
union.
San Francisco Tomorrow, a nonprofit organiza
tion addressing urban and environmental issues, is
also a plaintiff.
The merger, set to take effect Nov. 1, will create
a single nonprofit public benefit corporation,
UCSF-Stanford Health Care.
According to Libby Sayre, executive vice presi
dent of UPTE, the merger "is contrary to the best
interests of [IJCSFj, the community, university em
ployees, and the patients of UCSF medical center."
Sayre has stated previously that union opposition
is based on concern for both the welfare of the hos
pital employees and a desire for the UCSF Medical
Center to remain a public institution.
The complaint alleges that the University of Cal
ifornia's Board of Regents was not authorized to
"give away" the hospitals without retaining over
sight over the new entity.
The complaint also asserts that certain advocates
of the merger stood to benefit indirectly from it, an
alleged violation of the state's Political Reform Act.
Regents, individually and as a group, are named as
defendants, along with University of California
President Richard Atkinson and members of the
US HC board.
A decline in the quality of health care — espe
cially indigent and charity care — is inevitable, said
Sayre, whenever a public entity is privatized. The
unions are particularly troubled by the lack of pub
lic oversight over the new entity.
Terry Lightfoot, the spokesman for Atkinson,
said that the University of Califor
nia would not comment on pending
litigation. Judy Frabotta, the offi
cial spokesperson for USHC, also
declined to comment because
USHC is not a defendant.
Unions representing UCSF em
ployees have consistently been
among the merger's most vehe
ment opponents. Stanford Medical

Center is substantially less union
ized than UCSF's.
Other union-filed lawsuits, in
cluding one filed by the California
Public Employee Relations
Board, have unsuccessfully at
tempted to halt the Stanford-
UCSF merger. Sayre said that
even if the court declines to issue
an injunction based on the Sept.
23 complaint, the unions will still
fight the merger. "Eventually it
will be undone or modified,"
Sayre said.
