# Food safety to be improved
## Clinton pledges up to $24 million in aid 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with soaring food
imports, disease-tainted fruits and vegetables and far
fewer safety inspections, the Clinton administration is
moving aggressively to police the world's food.
Under a plan President Clinton is to announce
today, the government would spend up to $24 million
inspecting farms overseas. Those failing to meet certain
food-safety standards would not be allowed to import to
the United States.
U.S. farmers also would face new sanitation guide
lines, The Associated Press has learned, in part to fore
stall any complaints that the United States would hold
foreign farmers to higher standards.
Critics charge that the food plan is an effort to
counter opposition to free-trade legislation Clinton has
pending in Congress. They argue that the I I.S. food sup
ply already is the world's safest.
"Clearly, being the world food police complicates
the trade environment we operate in," said John
Aguirre of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Asso
ciation.
But the Food and Drug Administration, which has
been pushing for the changes since 1993, said it hasn't
kept pace with Americans' food supply.
"The whole infrastructure of food safety needs to be
strengthened," said Associate Commissioner William
Hubbard.
FDA figures show budget constraints made its

inspections of domestic food supplies plummet from
21 ,(KK) in l l )81 to just S>,(KM) last year. Foreign food
imports have doubled to 2.2 million shipments a year
since 1992, while I DA border inspections were cut in
half. A mere 2 percent of imported foods are sampled
for contamination at the docks.
Why the focus on fruits and vegetables? From 1973
through 19K7, tainted produce accounted for just 2 per
cent of disease outbreaks in which the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention identified a food
culprit — a proportion that jumped to 5 percent of out
breaks from 1988 through 1991.
Then doctors uncovered pathogens previously
unknown in produce, like the cyclospora in
Guatemalan raspberries that sickened some 1,400
Americans this spring and the I ', coli that contaminated
unpasteurized U.S. apple juices.
There is no evidence that imports are more danger
ous than U.S.-grown produce, said Morris Potter,
CDC's assistant director of s diseases. "The concern is
arising now because imports are on the rise," he said.
Last year, 38 percent of fruits and 12 percent of veg
etables eaten in the United States came from other
countries, a doubling since 1986.
Under the Clinton plan, a new corps of FDA inspec
tors would check foreign food safety systems and ban
imported fruits and vegetables from countries that don't
regulate strictly enough, said an administration official.
