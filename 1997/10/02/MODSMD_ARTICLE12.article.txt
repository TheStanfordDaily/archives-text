Fundraiser tragedy in NJ

TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) —Before he
was found strangled near his home, ll
year-old Edward Werner was eagerly pur
suing a set of walkie-talkies, the top prize
for selling the most candy and wrapping
paper for his school's PTA.
He was going door to door alone — a
practice discouraged by most fund-raising
groups — and sales were going so well he
was flashing a $2(X) wad of bills to friends.
Yesterday, prosecutors said, Edward
was a victim of his own success, killed for

his money by a 15-year-old boy who
answered the sixth-grader's knock on the
door.
They say Edward was brought inside
the home, sexually assaulted and strangled.
ITie 15-year-old boy, whose name was
not released, was charged with murder
and aggravated sexual assault. This mur
der case that has focused new attention on
the widespread practice of using children
to raise money for schools and other non
profit organizations.
