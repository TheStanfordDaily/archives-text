### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping
weeks of intense maneuvering, Congress
approved legislation yesterday that clears
the way for a $3,(XX) cost-of-living increase
in lawmakers' $133, MX) pay.
The 55-45 Senate vote was the latest in a
series of close calls for the bill, which leaders
in both houses and parties nursed toward
passage over many weeks without permit
ting a direct roll call vote on a pay increase.
Even so, the anxiety was evident in the
Senate, where 19 of the 30 people seeking
re-election next year voted against the bill
"We shouldn't be receiving a (cost-of liv

ing adjustment) during that period of time"
when lawmakers are asking others to sacri
fice, said Sen. Sam Brownback, R Kan.,
who faces the voters in 13 months and was
one of a small number of senators to speak
out against the increase. "1 cannot support
|it] at this point in time."
While partisan tensions inevitably sur
faced, the issue exposed generational splits
within the two houses. In the House, the
younger, reform-minded Republicans were
vocal in their opposition, while the older
lawmakers of both parties provided the
bulk of the support needed for passage.
