## Editorial Responsiveness at work

For the first time in more than a decade,
Tresidder Memorial Union is now 1(X) per
cent occupied — and filled with businesses
and facilities that truly serve the interests of
the Stanford community.
Since his arrival on campus two years
ago. Dean of Students Marc Wais has been
extremely responsive to student voices in
each of the new additions. Polio's, Jamba
Juice and most recently, the new athletic
facility have been added to the student
union.
Slowly, Tresidder is becoming a "hub" of
activity, as Wais set out to accomplish.
There is a notable difference in student,
staff and faculty flow in and out of Tresid
der since these new businesses and facilities
have opened.
Wais has not only worked hard to meet
students' demand for a smoothie bar, but he
also worked to meet student demand for a
e night eatery.

weights, 19 weight machines, 10 stair-
machines, 10 recumbent and

upright exercise hikes and a treadmill. The
center also contains a handicapped-accessi
ble multi-station machine among its equip
ment.
Additionally, students stand to benefit
from having the equipment at a more cen
trally located position on campus.
Wais's decision to allot space for the con
struction of Polio's served as a delicate a
compromise between students that wanted
Taco Bell's cheap Mexican food and late
night hours and students that protested
against Taco Bell's parent company Pepsico
for their involvement in exploiting workers
in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
Although the complaint remains that a
Polio's meal costs twice that of Taco Bell.
Wais's attempt to address both sides of the
issue shines through nonetheless.
Granted, the windows of the Tresidder
Fitness Center make exercising in the gym a
public endeavor, almost to the point where
one must already look good to go work out,
but overall the center rounds off a series of
positive improvements.
Tresidder now houses a coffee house, a
computer cluster, a juice bar, a Mexican
restaurant, a fitness center, a copy center, a
ticket office and much more. Even though
there are still cries for such businesses as a
bagel shop and an arcade — the existing
enterprises provide excellent services to the
Stanford community.
Dean Wais, in this endeavor, recognized
the need to address student demands. We
applaud his efforts to balance and respond
to student, faculty and staff input.
He has succeeded in creating a place that
can now more adequately act as a central
gathering spot for those in the Stanford
community. Isn't that what a "student
union" is for anvway?
