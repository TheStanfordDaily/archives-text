## What's new on my plate 
### 
James Montoya

Early last
SPRING I just
assumed that I
would be spending this fall
as I had the previous one
— visiting high schools,
reading Early Decision
applications and perform
ing in Big Game Gaieties.

My life has changed, and I will miss see
ing the orange and turquoise color scheme
of Howard Johnson motels; performing the
macarena on the stage of Memorial Audito
rium; and reading applications into the
early hours of the morning. Three months
into my new position as Vice Provost for
Student Affairs, I can say with a straight
bow tie, I have no regrets, and not just
because I'm being well fed (The pesto at
Columbae is great!).
So what is a Vice Provost of Student
Affairs? One way to describe the position is
to list the areas I oversee: Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid, Registrar's
Office (including the Career Planning and
Placement Center and the Graduate
Admissions Office), Dean of Students
Office, Residential Education and Gradu
ate Residences, Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and Cowell Student Health Services.
Perhaps a better way to convey the scope
of my new role is to describe a few of the
initiatives with which I am currently
involved:
Network for Student Information (NSI)
Assevsment Project: We are assessing our
current academic information system to
determine the need to change or replace it.

The domain of NSI includes undergraduate
and graduate admission, undergraduate
financial aid, graduate awards, registration,
housing and dining, student finances and
academic support (academic records,
course scheduling, grading, and course eval
uation). Registrar Roger Printup is the
executive sponsor of the project and plans
to have the evaluation completed this win
ter. This is just one way I intend to work col
laboratively with schools, departments and
faculty to support their work.
Task Force Report on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for Undergrad
uates: In October of 1996 the Task Force,
chaired by Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar, was asked "to
evaluate the proper relationship between
residential programs and undergraduate
education and the system of housing assign
ments." The task force has recommended
that the vice provost for student affairs take
the role of implementation officer in over
seeing the necessary processes involved in
responding to the recommendation made in
this report.
Long range plan for student space: Stu
dent space issues, including residential
space, have emerged as a high priority for
student leaders. A comprehensive, long
range plan for student space will be devel
oped over the next 18 months and will start
with an assessment of specific needs. At the
same time, working closely with the ASSU,
we will determine how we can best support
the hundreds of student organizations at
Stanford.
Quality of life for graduate students: The

results of the Committee on Academics,
Research and Evaluation (CARE) survey
for graduate student life were featured in a
recent Daily article. This report, given to
me last spring by Doug Natelson (then chair
of CARE), remained a constant companion
this summer. I used the summer to familiar
ize myself with graduate student concerns,
including the negative impact of the local
housing market. Collaboration with the
Office of Research and Graduate Policy
and the ASSU will be key as we give further
consideration to the issues raised by the
report.
Survey on financing a Stanford educa
tion: The high cost of a university education
is on the minds of many Stanford families.
In conjunction with the Academic Planning
Project (supported by a grant from the
Irvine Foundation), we will survey a select
group of juniors and seniors and their par
ents to better understand how families
finance a Stanford education. The informa
tion we collect will be helpful to us as we
give further consideration to the complex
issues of cost and financial aid.
As I reintroduce myself to the members
of the Stanford community in my new role
as a vice provost, I typically ask for any
advice they are willing to send my way.
For the most part, the advice others have
offered is easy to follow: be visible, reach
out, listen and smile. It's good advice — that
I know. I suspect yours will be, too.

admissions and current vice provost for stu
dent affairs.
