issues with firing
and coverage deserve atten
tion
JV While Ido not have much of an opinion
way on the firing of a Stanford Daily
2§columnist, I do have an opinion of much of
JbJhe resultant fall-out.
First of all, there's the claim that this is
free speech issue, when nothing could be
further from the truth. The Constitutional
fright to free speech is the right to speak
%tjfreelv. not the "right" to have your words
to individuals without cost.
V*lTie latter is the definition of "free" many
V*are confusing with the correct one. If the
jjftired columnist wishes, he may, with his
funds, start up a newspaper — writ
tng, printing and distributing it as he wish
's. The Daily should have no obligation to
JjjJprint what it does not see fit, to subsidize
it opposes.
I do find some of the Stanford Daily's
•factions disturbing, however. There is the
►pclaim that the reason the rejected column
deemed unacceptable was because the
aJMs. Clinton's being here was no longer
This is a poor excuse. Opin
ion articles are often ideal for things which
long since faded from the front page,
I doubt there was any such policy
jibe fore Clinton came to town.
S Then, there is the coverage of the let
ters to the editor. The letters begin with a
Scrambling, vitriolic rant against the Daily's
! tilecision, and are followed by backing let

ters. Only at the end can one find well
written letters opposing the Daily. It's
almost as though the Daily is saying, "See?
This is the kind of person that opposes us,"
and follows with "and these are those who
support us." Such manipulation is decep
tive at best, pathetic at worst. In addition,
the fact that the editors decided not to cor
rect the spelling of the aforementioned
rant virtually assures that, even if it were
an otherwise excellent letter, it would be
put in an unfavorable light.
On a different note, let me end by say
ing that the Daily should refer to the presi
dent's daughter as "Ms. Clinton," "Miss
Clinton," or "Chelsea Clinton," not just
"Chelsea." Despite their efforts to assure
her that she'll be "just like any other Stan
ford student," 1 doubt the Daily writers are
on a first-name basis with her.

Newspapers lack respect and
dignity
1 heard with sorrow about Stanford
Daily's firing of a writer for his story on
Chelsea Clinton's first days at the university.
1 was not surprised at the firing.
This is fairly typical for newspapers,
although it's a little precocious for a stu
dent paper. Most media organizations are
like that: Revolving doors, with people fil
ing in. bodies being kicked out.
If Jesse Oxfeld's storv didn't suit the

editor, it could have been killed. Instead, a
human being's career was killed.
Human being. That's a term the media
should consider adding to its vocabulary.
Oxfeld learned a valuable lesson from
this: Get a degree in something that
counts, something like medicine or law or
computer science or accounting or educa
tion. Some profession where the employ
ees are treated with respect and dignity.
Respect and dignity. Two things you'll
never see at those sad, sad places called
newspapers.

Columnist deserves an apol
ogy
I am not a student but a computer pro
fessional concerned about the First
Amendment. The firing of the columnist
for writing about the impact of the Secret
Service / Chelsea's arrival at Stanford was
completely out of line and in my opinion a
stride into the grey area of violating the
First Amendment.
Technically it was not a breach, as the
paper has the right as a business / entity to
control its content, but from an outside
perspective the editor made the wrong call
An opinion column is supposed to be able
to voice ANY opinion... not just the ones
the editor feels are politically correct.
Also having almost entered into the
Secret Service as a profession, I under-

stand fully the impact that level of security
has on a visited site... and it is enormous,
imposing, uncomfortable and sometimes
very inconvenient for everyone outside the
security perimeter... so an opinion refut
ing that Chelsea's day was normed to a
regular level and that it imposed upon the
rest of the campus would be very valid.
1 think perhaps an apology is in order
and reinstatement for that columnist.

Journalists have a tendency to put a
story above common sense and compassion.
They often fail to understand that human
lives are involved. I'm glad there's an editor
who stands by decisions such as your own.

Answering critics detracts
from intent of policy
In a way I sympathize with you. but
mostly you embody all that 1 think is
wrong with the thinking, or lack thereof,
that prevails in academia, and in many
respects, journalism these days. You
believe in a Utopia and you believe your
role as a journalist is to promote that
vision. It is not. Just give us the news.
If you answer your critics on this
Chelsea issue in a public forum, you are

contradicting your policy, and accordingly,
you should resign. If you remain silent, you
are a fool who has been caught in a (politi
cally correct) trap of your own making.
Admittedly, I am enjoying your self
styled catch-22 from afar. You and the rest
of your free speech inhibiting ilk deserve
this quandary. Hopefully, you'll learn a les
son from this.
And, oh, you have made Chelsea the
center of attention on a much bigger cam
pus than Stanford — America and beyond.
If you have any character, you'll rehire
Mr. Oxfeld and apologize publicly to him,
the journalism world and to Chelsea Clin
ton for making her look like an defenseless
adolescent instead of a budding adult.

Chelsea's arrival definitely
newsworthy
1 think your decision not to run a col
umn by Mr Oxfeld was incorrect. I can
understand your policy of not writing about
Chelsea unless it is newsworthy. 1 applaud
that decision. 1 understand from news
reports that his column regarded the heavy
news coverage of Chelsea's arrival. The
extraordinary amount of press and security
is a newsworthy event. I ask you to recon
sider your decision to not run the column.
