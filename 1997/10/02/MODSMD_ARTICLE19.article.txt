## It pays to be small in Hong Kong

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A little
size advantage when it comes to
boarding a crowded subway car or
elevator. My five-foot-frame guarantees me
a spot in the most crowded train. Most peo
ple underestimate the luxury that can be
experienced, traveling the railway system
tucked between one guy's armpit and
another one's shoulder blade. Space is a
precious reward meted out frugally on the
crowded streets of the world's newest Spe
cial Administrative Region.
The size of the population dictates cul
ture in the most unexpected ways. ATM
machines don't have little mirrors over their
terminals. The simple fact is this: if you're
using the ATM, you don't need to keep an
eye on the person behind you. You can feel
him or her standing inches away. Philan
thropic Westerners who allow ATM-goers
"their space" too often find themselves at
the back of the line.
I didn't always appreciate being short, or
"vertically challenged," as those in my com
pany would delicately put it. Ever since
kindergarten, I was always the shortest kid
in the class. It came with its privileges. 1

always got to stand in the front row when
we took the annual class portrait. My
slouching was captured perfectly for my
mother to criticize later.
1 got to sit at the front of the class, where
I was struck by spittle as my teacher deliv
ered the weekly spelling list.
Tetherball during recess was a blast. My
opponent only had to swirl the ball over my
head a few times before it wrapped itself
around the pole.
"I win," they'd say after their 15 seconds
of fun.
I walked away in humiliation.
I was rewarded with loving nicknames by
people who used to be my friends: Tiny.
Munchkin. Tattoo.
After a while, I got sick of people telling
me that "big things came in small pack
ages." I grew to resent the economical
packaging of dynamite.
not even talk about movie theaters
or concerts.
Yes, it takes a real strong sense of self to
appreciate the shortness that is me.
After all, I grew up in the United States
— the land of the big people — a nation

that prides itself on having the biggest econ
omy and the biggest freedoms. It has big
morals, big lands and big intentions.
A combination worthy of conversation,
to say the least.
But may it either take the form of send
ing tons of milk powder to a nation of starv
ing, lactose intolerant people or pressing the
Chinese government on issues such as the
environment, America's big "best inten
tions" often manifest themselves in mis
guided terms.
Premier Li Peng (ranked second in Com
munist Party command) warned against this
at the annual World Bank / International
Monetary Fund conference last week in
Hong Kong. Western powers must be care
ful not to impose its values on a society that
is drastically different, he said.
Whether it be opening up Southeast
Asian markets or demanding faster demo
cratic reforms, the Western brand of values
need not always apply.
Vice Premier Zhu Rhongji also
addressed Fast-West differences. He said,
"If China had the same population size as
France, then any [economic] problem

would be no problem."
Population affects much more than allo
cation of Asian space. Useless labor is not
uncommon in the more industrialized
regions of China. When 1 took the subway
in Shanghai (which is an adventure in itself),
a person tore my ticket as I entered the
turnstiie to board the train, double-check
ing that 1 had paid the correct fare. When 1
reached my destination, 1 handed my ticket
to a second worker who was charged with
the responsibility of collecting all the used
tickets into a trash bin.
This was how he made his living. A far
cry from consulting.
But China is steadily changing, as can be
seen in the latest reorganization of the
Communist Party in the 15th People's Party
Congress. For the first time, not one of the
members of the Standing Committee is a
member of the military.
The people in Hong Kong closely
watched the 15th People's Party Congress
this month and took note of the conserva
tive shuffling of Communist Party powers.
As Jiang Zemin asserts his power and exe
cutes capitalistic reforms in the name of

Chinese socialism, Hong Kong minds its
space and watches.
China is changing. It is developing. Ajul
admittedly, it needs to carry out an almost
infinite number of reforms in its political,
economic and social realms. But this will he
done at its own pace — and though the tim
ing may not satisfy the expectations of the
richest developed nation in the world, the
United States should follow Hong Kong's
suit and mind more of its space. It should irv
harder to take into account the thousands of
years of history that present day Chinese
culture envelops. It should consider its 1 2
billion population. Many ideas, including
the American form of democracy, can't sun
ply be transplanted across the globe.
As I walk the streets of Hong Kong,
astounded by the number of people I walk
by who are still taller than me, I think to
myself: it pays to make smaller cultural
assumptions. And as I carve out a space for
myself between the subway car door and an
old woman's elbow, I think: it also pays to
be small in Hong Kong.
