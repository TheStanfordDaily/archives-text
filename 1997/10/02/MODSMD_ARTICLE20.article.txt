### Jaime Adame 
Visitors on their way to the Dish,
a popular draw for many local resi
dents, may be in for an unpleasant
surprise when they attempt to park
their cars on Frenchman's Road
near the Foothills.
A special Stanford Housing
parking permit is now required be
cause of a policy put into effect dur
ing the summer.
Complaints from area residents
about heavy traffic and automobile
break-ins resulted in the Universi
ty's new policy.
Although this move may incon
venience joggers and hikers, many
residents and officials both believe
that the volume of traffic was sim
ply too large when coupled with the
many pedestrians attempting to
reach the Dish by crossing Junipero
Serra, a major street, from French
man's Road.
"Safety is our number one prior
ity," said Jim Patell, president of
the Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholder's Association, a vol
unteer group that represents about

850 families living on campus that
lobbied for the move.
The Stanford Planning Office, as
well as Santa Clara County offi
cials, have been attempting to find a
long-term solution to the pedestri
an problem for the past two years.
According to Charles Carter of
the planning office, cars traveling at
high speeds as well as poor road vis
ibility have led to hazardous condi
tions for pedestrians.
The crossing is currently about
2(X) yards from the intersection of
Campus Drive East and Junipero
Serra.
Carter said that Stanford has ap
proved funding for a project to line
up the street intersection with the
pedestrian crossing. County offi
cials have agreed to provide a push
button pedestrian crossing light for
the intersection. The project is
scheduled for next summer.
Although the Dish sits on private
Stanford land, visitors are still wel
come as long as they park in other
areas of campus. Only residents liv
ing on Frenchman's Road are al
lowed to buy the permits.
