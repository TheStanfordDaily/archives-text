The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball
team heads to Los Angeles this weekend for
its first real test of the season.

■ SUNDAY: No. 4 Stanford at No. 21 UCLA
(5-4,1-3). Radio: KZSU-FM 90.1

The Cardinal (12-2, 3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) will face seventh-ranked USC (10-1, 3-
1) Friday at 6 p.m. and then take on No. 21
UCLA (5-4,1-3) Sunday at 2 p.m. The Women
of Troy are off to their best start in years, and
this season the Bruins are playing with some
thing to prove after not making last year's
NCAA tournament for the first time in the
program's history.
This weekend's contests are the two tough
est back-to-back matches Stanford has faced
since the State Farm Classic Aug. 22 and 23,
and head coach Don Shaw is expecting the
L.A. schools to give the Card a long, difficult
weekend.
"That's what I'm preparing for," Shaw said.
"I've been concerned about whether we're in
long-match shape at this point. Our practice
sessions have been longer than most of our
games. With volleyball you can be out there an
hour, you can be out there three hours. And
you need to be in the kind of physical condi
tion to be playing your best after three hours."

Aside from the physical challenge USC and
UCLA will likely provide, there is a rich histo
ry between these programs. Unlike UCLA,
which is considered as much of a big name in
volleyball as Stanford, USC has never had
much luck against the Card.
Stanford owns the series between these two
teams 37-8, and you can bet the Cardinal has
become a bit of a thorn in USC's side, ending
the Women of Troy's season in the NCAA
tournament seven out of the last nine years.
"Our record against them is pretty good,"
Shaw said. "They're tired of us, I'm sure.
They're hungry to beat us, and this is as good a
team and as good a start as they've had in a
long time. I'm sure they're fired up to play this
match."
This season USC is anchored by a strong ju
nior class led by middle blocker Jasmina
Marinkovic. Last year Marinkovic ranked in
the conference's top 10 in hitting percentage
(.360). kills average (4.16) and blocks average
(1.38).
"When they get a good enough pass,
Marinkovic is going to get the ball a lot," Shaw
said. "And she's very cagey, she's got a lot of
shots. Even if we stick blockers up there in her
face and commit to her, she's going to find
ways to put balls away."
USC has also added seven new freshmen to
replace the five seniors lost to graduation last
year. The Trojans' only loss this season was a
five-game loss to Washington State in Pull
man, Wash., 16-14,15-11,3-15,12-15,15-10.
"With USC we need to be prepared for a

quick attack," Shaw said. "The key
to beating USC usually is serving
them tough enough and in the right
spots to make it difficult for them to
run their middle attack."
Preparing for UCLA will be
quite a different story. Shaw says
one of the difficult things about this
weekend will be the contrasting
styles that UCLA and USC offer.
I"he Trojans are a smaller, quicker
team that will likely provide long
rallies and strong defense. The Bru
ins, on the other hand, are a bigger
squad that Shaw calls a "net-orient
ed team" and will put up some big
blocks at the net.
"Obviously we're scouting what
they're doing," senior middle block
er Barbara Ifejika said of the com
petition. "But most of our prepara
tion is making sure that we execute

and play well and get the job done,
in and out.
"We're confident and healthy,
that's definitely a good way to put it.
We've had a couple of good match
es against schools where the compe
tition wasn't that tough. Still, we
didn't sink down to their level. We
kept the level on our side very
high."
The Bruins definitely aren't as
tough as they have been in previous
seasons, but they're adamant about
returning to the NCAA tournament
this year. One of the first things
UCLA must do to accomplish that
goal is replace the void left by Kim
Krull. Krull led the Bruins in kills,
solo blocks and service aces last sea
son.
"Traditionally they've been very
good teams," Ifejika said of both
UCLA and USC. "Weird things
have happened in the past in L.A.
Good teams have gone down there
and played horribly, so it's an im
portant weekend for us."

and play well and get the job done,
in and out.
"We're confident and healthy,
that's definitely a good way to put it.
We've had a couple of good match
es against schools where the compe
tition wasn't that tough. Still, we
didn't sink down to their level. We
kept the level on our side very
high."
The Bruins definitely aren't as
tough as they have been in previous
seasons, but they're adamant about
returning to the NCAA tournament
this year. One of the first things
UCLA must do to accomplish that
goal is replace the void left by Kim
Krull. Krull led the Bruins in kills,
solo blocks and service aces last sea
son.
"Traditionally they've been very
good teams," Ifejika said of both
UCLA and USC. "Weird things
have happened in the past in L.A.
Good teams have gone down there
and played horribly, so it's an im
portant weekend for us."
