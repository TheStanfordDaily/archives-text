# Unselfishness personified
## Ifejika embodies team play 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Kristin Folkl, Kerri Walsh, Lisa
Sharpley — they're all names you
probably recognize as being top play
ers on the fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team.
But lurking in the shadows is a
name that you probably don't recog
nize, despite being a four-year starter
for the Cardinal and perhaps its most
consistent player over that period.
She's managed to avoid the limelight,
and as a result she's also missed out on
much-deserved recognition.
Senior Barbara Ifejika is one of the
most underrated players in the coun
try. The middle blocker has been a
maiastay in the Stanford program and
has helped guide the Card to three Pa

cific lOConference titles, NCAA
Final Fours and two national champi
onships.
Yet she hasn't even garnered all
conference honor-,. But you get the
feeling that Ifejika (pronounced ih-
FEDG-ih-kiih) hasn't given much
thought to individual accomplishment.
"I'm really not about trying to get
the personal honors,'' Ifejik 1 said. "I
could care less if I was first-team Ail-
American and lost. That would be re
ally bitter. So I'm contributing howev
er I can. and we're winning. That's
what I'm here for."
Perhaps a player who entered Stan
ford as Canada's No. 1 recruit and one
of Volleyball Magazine's top 25 might
expect more notoriety. After all. the
Brampton, Ontario, native was a
starter as a freshman, just like class

mates Sharpley and FolkJ.
"I think most players coming into
the program can pretty much expect
that," Ifejika said. "You may have
been the bomb when you were in high
school, but you're coming in with peo
ple who are all-world. You're playing
with Kristin Folkl, Kern Walsh and
Lisa Sharpley. ITieir awards and acco
lades are well deserved."
So just what has Ifejika done in her
Stanford career'.' Well, she's currently
just 29 blocks away from breaking into
the all-time top five on Stanford's ca
reer block list. ITiat feat would place
her in a distinguished group, one that
includes Kim and Bev (Xlen as well as
Nancy Reno.
Ifejika just goes about the business
of working hard and playing coasis-

recognition despite being one of the Caidinal's most consistent players.
