# Unselfishness personified
## Ifejika embodies team play 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Kristin Folkl, Kerri Walsh, Lisa
Sharpley — they're all names you
probably recognize as being top play
ers on the fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team.
But lurking in the shadows is a
name that you probably don't recog
nize, despite being a four-year starter
for the Cardinal and perhaps its most
consistent player over that period.
She's managed to avoid the limelight,
and as a result she's also missed out on
much-deserved recognition.
Senior Barbara Ifejika is one of the
most underrated players in the coun
try. The middle blocker has been a
maiastay in the Stanford program and
has helped guide the Card to three Pa

cific lOConference titles, NCAA
Final Fours and two national champi
onships.
Yet she hasn't even garnered all
conference honor-,. But you get the
feeling that Ifejika (pronounced ih-
FEDG-ih-kiih) hasn't given much
thought to individual accomplishment.
"I'm really not about trying to get
the personal honors,'' Ifejik 1 said. "I
could care less if I was first-team Ail-
American and lost. That would be re
ally bitter. So I'm contributing howev
er I can. and we're winning. That's
what I'm here for."
Perhaps a player who entered Stan
ford as Canada's No. 1 recruit and one
of Volleyball Magazine's top 25 might
expect more notoriety. After all. the
Brampton, Ontario, native was a
starter as a freshman, just like class

mates Sharpley and FolkJ.
"I think most players coming into
the program can pretty much expect
that," Ifejika said. "You may have
been the bomb when you were in high
school, but you're coming in with peo
ple who are all-world. You're playing
with Kristin Folkl, Kern Walsh and
Lisa Sharpley. ITieir awards and acco
lades are well deserved."
So just what has Ifejika done in her
Stanford career'.' Well, she's currently
just 29 blocks away from breaking into
the all-time top five on Stanford's ca
reer block list. ITiat feat would place
her in a distinguished group, one that
includes Kim and Bev (Xlen as well as
Nancy Reno.
Ifejika just goes about the business
of working hard and playing coasis-

tently good volleyball. And that's
something that's earned her the re
spect of her teammates.
"Something I've always ad
mired about Barb is that she's such
a consistent and steady player,"
Folkl said. "In this day and age,
with emphasis put on hot-dogging
and only going for offensive glory,
she is one player who has remained
faithful to being a great all-around
player."
That unselfishness has parlayed
itself into some pretty impressive
volleyball. This season she's second
on the team in total blocks (44) and
kills (112).
Not to mention the fact that as a
middle blocker, she's the staple of
the Cardinal's defense.
"Barb is so important, if she has a
bad night the entire team's defense
will be thrown off," Folkl said.

"That's why it's so crucial that she
plays how she does. For her all these
years to set up [the defense] so well
and to be so consistent makes our
job easier."
So how does Ifejika rate her own
performance? Not surprisingly, the
workhorse of the women's volley
ball squad speaks of team perfor
mance and personal improvement.
"I've learned some new things
every season," Ifejika said. "There
are a lot of things I still need to work
on for my own goals for this season.
I feel good about my career here, but
I'd like to end it spectacularly."
But sadly, the end of Ifejika's Stan
ford career will mark the end of her
volleyball career entirely. The political
science and African-American studies
double major has no plans to continue
her athletic career beyond college, but
instead hopes to attend law school.
And the hard work and dedica
tion she displays on the court isn't
absent from her studies.
"I definitely try to do as well as I
can in school," Ifejika said. "It's

been a tradeoff. I could have studied
and gone gnarly in school, but I also
wanted to try to have fun and play
volleyball. I think I've done a pretty
good job balancing all three."
But the last thing you'd expect from
Ifejika is a razor-sharp sense of humor.
So the first time she smarts off to you in
her distinctly elegant voice, you're not
quite sure if she's serious. That is, not
until you see that wry grin on her face.
"Our freshman still haven't fig
ured out when she's joking," Folkl
said. "They don't know. They're
like, 'Was she serious?' and we're
like 'Oooh, I don't know, she might
be really mad at you.' "
But when she's not playing jokes
on the freshmen, Ifejika is the kind
of person her teammates trust and
depend on. And she's very content
with the path her career has taken.
"In retrospect, I just feel like I've
been very, very blessed," Ifejika
said. "I'm starting to realize that
now that it's almost gone. It's
cliched, but it's true. It's been won
derful."

mired about Barb is that she's such
a consistent and steady player,"
Folkl said. "In this day and age,
with emphasis put on hot-dogging
and only going for offensive glory,
she is one player who has remained
faithful to being a great all-around
player."
That unselfishness has parlayed
itself into some pretty impressive
volleyball. This season she's second
on the team in total blocks (44) and
kills (112).
Not to mention the fact that as a
middle blocker, she's the staple of
the Cardinal's defense.
"Barb is so important, if she has a
bad night the entire team's defense
will be thrown off," Folkl said.

"That's why it's so crucial that she
plays how she does. For her all these
years to set up [the defense] so well
and to be so consistent makes our
job easier."
So how does Ifejika rate her own
performance? Not surprisingly, the
workhorse of the women's volley
ball squad speaks of team perfor
mance and personal improvement.
"I've learned some new things
every season," Ifejika said. "There
are a lot of things I still need to work
on for my own goals for this season.
I feel good about my career here, but
I'd like to end it spectacularly."
But sadly, the end of Ifejika's Stan
ford career will mark the end of her
volleyball career entirely. The political
science and African-American studies
double major has no plans to continue
her athletic career beyond college, but
instead hopes to attend law school.
And the hard work and dedica
tion she displays on the court isn't
absent from her studies.
"I definitely try to do as well as I
can in school," Ifejika said. "It's

been a tradeoff. I could have studied
and gone gnarly in school, but I also
wanted to try to have fun and play
volleyball. I think I've done a pretty
good job balancing all three."
But the last thing you'd expect from
Ifejika is a razor-sharp sense of humor.
So the first time she smarts off to you in
her distinctly elegant voice, you're not
quite sure if she's serious. That is, not
until you see that wry grin on her face.
"Our freshman still haven't fig
ured out when she's joking," Folkl
said. "They don't know. They're
like, 'Was she serious?' and we're
like 'Oooh, I don't know, she might
be really mad at you.' "
But when she's not playing jokes
on the freshmen, Ifejika is the kind
of person her teammates trust and
depend on. And she's very content
with the path her career has taken.
"In retrospect, I just feel like I've
been very, very blessed," Ifejika
said. "I'm starting to realize that
now that it's almost gone. It's
cliched, but it's true. It's been won
derful."
