# A 						case of building on a dream
## Ilia Christy culminates polo career with major award 
### 
At first glance, Ilia (In isty seems
like any other overachieving
Stanford student. She gradu
ated with a 3.5 grade-point average as a
biology major this past June and will be
attending the I Jniversity of Rochester
Medieal School in the fall of IWK.
No small feat, to be sure, but
nothing out of the ordinary at a plaee
like Stanford.
Hut a closer look reveals a remark
able story. Christy was recently
crowned the Outstanding Female In
tercollegiate Polo Player of the Year,
an award given annually by the Polo
Training Foundation for sportsman
ship, horsemanship and leadership.
She won it despite a severe lack of re
sources, despite the impending pres
sure of medical school and despite a
non-polo background when she ar
rived on the Farm in the fall of IW2.
That's right. She had never held a
mallet or competed with poloteams in
her formative years. But her deep ded
ication to building the women's fx>lo
team helped get Stanford to the |x>mt
where it nearly knocked off perennial
powerhouse Cornell in the national
semifinals last April in Ft. Worth, Tex.
Sure, the Pasadena, C alif., native
was an accomplished equestrian
rider. Hut riding on a horse while at
tempting to hit a small ball with a
four-and-a-half f<x>t mallet has to be
at least on par with hitting a baseball
in terms of the hardest things to do in
sports. That said, just imagine the
steep learning curve Christy had to
hit to get to where she is now, one of
the top female polo players in the
country.
"When I came here, I wanted to
continue riding," Christy said. "Riding
had been a really central part of my life,
and I wanted to continue that.
" I knew Stanford had an equestrian
team, and I had spoken with the coach
es months before I came up here. I was
planning on joining the equestrian
team. It seemed like the logical thing to
do, since that's what I've been doing
for the last nine years."
Hut after a few weeks, ("hristy real
ized her appetite for riding was not
going t()be fulfilled. She was in a league
of her own. and there was little else to
learn from riding once a week with
horses that were not capablc of what
she wanted to do.
Then the opportunity to take on a
true challenge presented itself.
"I met another girl on the equestri
an team who also wanted to do more
riding, so we tned it out for the polo
team," Christy said. "We liked the fact
that we could learn m > much fr< >m p< >l< >,
and we wouldn't have that opjxirtum

ty again (with equestrian). It's the
whole notion of learning that really in
spired me to join because it was some
thing we knew nothing about."
C ertainly, the g< >ing was l< >ugh at the
outset. Hut as soon as she was handed a
mallet, (liristy was h(x >ked. It was such
a novel feeling for her, and she took
every chance to improve her flitting,
practicing to the point of soreness. I fer
determination paid off, earning her a
spot on the women's team and kicking
off some seniors in the process.

"I relied heavily on my riding,"
Christy said of her first few competi
tions. "I would beat the other team
through my riding and not through hit
ting the ball because I still couldn't hit
the ball very well I was the defensive
weapon."
Hut amid the wonderful atmos
phere (>f a team s|x >rt and the blissi >t rid
ing every day, there were s< >me definite
roadblocks. She fx_'came acutely aware
of them when she became horse man
ager of the club her sophomore year
and then president the following year
The most glaring problem was
money, or lack thereof. Considering
it takes $57,(KH) to provide basic
health care tor 25 horses, it was a sit

uation where there was no margin
lor error. Talk about getting ready
formed school.
"We hardly callcd the vet out to
treat a sick animal,"(liristie said. "We
had the supplies and did it ourselves.
We diagnosed, and il we were con
fused, we'd ask our coach, who was an
excellent horseman."
But there was more thanjust taking
care of horses. ( 'hristy also hail to han
die fundraising, creating game and
travel schedules, keeping up memlx r
ship and being a liaison to the |x>|o
community. A lot ol tins meant estab
lishinj.' g<H kJ en<>ugh relationship with
the club spirts administrators that they
would trust ( hristy with a $10,()CK) an
nual contribution to help the jxilo
team.
Hut even then, the team had to do
things like work as ushers at different
athletic events, serve at the Viennese
Ball and clean up Stanford Stadium
after games just to even approach fi
nancial stability within the club.
Remember folks, she w;is still try
ing to keep her grades up at tins
time.
Nevertheless, the club improved.
Despite playing a slower brand ol jk>lo
on the West Coast, ( hristy and her
teammates played well as a team. I he
teamwork showed when the squad re
ally provided a still challenge to the
best teams in the country during na
tional competition last year llus past
spring, it knocked oil I'exasA&M U>-
14 in the national quarter finals before
falling to( ornell IK 12.

Christy's five years of tremendous
dedication were duly commended
last month with the player of the year
award. To say she fit the criteria for
the award is an understatement.
"She's very well respected by any
one who has anything to do with inter
collegiate polo," said head coach Wes
Linfoot "I just can't praise her enough.
She's put her heart and soul into the
game."
Now that Christy can sit back,
breath a sigh of relief and set her
sights on med school, can she say it
was worth the effort?
"I've learned more from polo than
anything else in my life," Christy said.
"It's done more for me than I would
ever have imagined. I've really grown
arid developed a lot through it and
changed who I am in the process. It's
just having the raw essentials and
working to fulfill a dream."

Christy's five years of tremendous
dedication were duly commended
last month with the player of the year
award. To say she fit the criteria for
the award is an understatement.
"She's very well respected by any
one who has anything to do with inter
collegiate polo," said head coach Wes
Linfoot "I just can't praise her enough.
She's put her heart and soul into the
game."
Now that Christy can sit back,
breath a sigh of relief and set her
sights on med school, can she say it
was worth the effort?
"I've learned more from polo than
anything else in my life," Christy said.
"It's done more for me than I would
ever have imagined. I've really grown
arid developed a lot through it and
changed who I am in the process. It's
just having the raw essentials and
working to fulfill a dream."
At first glance, Ilia (In isty seems
like any other overachieving
Stanford student. She gradu
ated with a 3.5 grade-point average as a
biology major this past June and will be
attending the I Jniversity of Rochester
Medieal School in the fall of IWK.
No small feat, to be sure, but
nothing out of the ordinary at a plaee
like Stanford.
Hut a closer look reveals a remark
able story. Christy was recently
crowned the Outstanding Female In
tercollegiate Polo Player of the Year,
an award given annually by the Polo
Training Foundation for sportsman
ship, horsemanship and leadership.
She won it despite a severe lack of re
sources, despite the impending pres
sure of medical school and despite a
non-polo background when she ar
rived on the Farm in the fall of IW2.
That's right. She had never held a
mallet or competed with poloteams in
her formative years. But her deep ded
ication to building the women's fx>lo
team helped get Stanford to the |x>mt
where it nearly knocked off perennial
powerhouse Cornell in the national
semifinals last April in Ft. Worth, Tex.
Sure, the Pasadena, C alif., native
was an accomplished equestrian
rider. Hut riding on a horse while at
tempting to hit a small ball with a
four-and-a-half f<x>t mallet has to be
at least on par with hitting a baseball
in terms of the hardest things to do in
sports. That said, just imagine the
steep learning curve Christy had to
hit to get to where she is now, one of
the top female polo players in the
country.
"When I came here, I wanted to
continue riding," Christy said. "Riding
had been a really central part of my life,
and I wanted to continue that.
" I knew Stanford had an equestrian
team, and I had spoken with the coach
es months before I came up here. I was
planning on joining the equestrian
team. It seemed like the logical thing to
do, since that's what I've been doing
for the last nine years."
Hut after a few weeks, ("hristy real
ized her appetite for riding was not
going t()be fulfilled. She was in a league
of her own. and there was little else to
learn from riding once a week with
horses that were not capablc of what
she wanted to do.
Then the opportunity to take on a
true challenge presented itself.
"I met another girl on the equestri
an team who also wanted to do more
riding, so we tned it out for the polo
team," Christy said. "We liked the fact
that we could learn m > much fr< >m p< >l< >,
and we wouldn't have that opjxirtum

ty again (with equestrian). It's the
whole notion of learning that really in
spired me to join because it was some
thing we knew nothing about."
C ertainly, the g< >ing was l< >ugh at the
outset. Hut as soon as she was handed a
mallet, (liristy was h(x >ked. It was such
a novel feeling for her, and she took
every chance to improve her flitting,
practicing to the point of soreness. I fer
determination paid off, earning her a
spot on the women's team and kicking
off some seniors in the process.

"I relied heavily on my riding,"
Christy said of her first few competi
tions. "I would beat the other team
through my riding and not through hit
ting the ball because I still couldn't hit
the ball very well I was the defensive
weapon."
Hut amid the wonderful atmos
phere (>f a team s|x >rt and the blissi >t rid
ing every day, there were s< >me definite
roadblocks. She fx_'came acutely aware
of them when she became horse man
ager of the club her sophomore year
and then president the following year
The most glaring problem was
money, or lack thereof. Considering
it takes $57,(KH) to provide basic
health care tor 25 horses, it was a sit

uation where there was no margin
lor error. Talk about getting ready
formed school.
"We hardly callcd the vet out to
treat a sick animal,"(liristie said. "We
had the supplies and did it ourselves.
We diagnosed, and il we were con
fused, we'd ask our coach, who was an
excellent horseman."
But there was more thanjust taking
care of horses. ( 'hristy also hail to han
