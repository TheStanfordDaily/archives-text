# A 						smashing 'Tosca' opens the San Francisco Opera's new season
## 
### Benjamin Lawrance 
The rededication of the San Francisco War Memorial
Opera House with a stupendous gala celebration has al
most overshadowed a reworking of Armando Agnini's
1932 production of Puccini's Tosca. But not quite.
As refreshing as it is immense in grandeur, Thierry
Bosquet's spectacular staging is well worth a trip to the city.
Carol Vaness returns to the opera house in inimitable
form, this time in the title role ofTosca. Richard Margison
also makes an impressive Cavaradossi and James Morris, a
memorable Scarpia.
Real life stories and urban myths abound in Illica's and
Giacosa's dramatic libretto. It is a whirlwind of political in
trigue and masterful orchestration.
While Angelotti, a political prisoner, is hiding in the
chapel, our hero Cavaradossi enters, reflecting on his new
work, which seems to bear a striking resemblance to the
love of his life, Floria Tosca. He finds Angelotti, gives him
some food and promises to aid him. Tosca enters the
church, and Angelotti hides again. The hero and heroine
sing of their love and plan for the future.
Later, Scarpia, the chief of police, enters the church and
pieces together the evidence. He knows Cavaradossi is hid
ing Angelotti and vows to capture both, as well as the heart
of Madame Tosca.
In the second act, Scarpia is dining alone in the palace
and making plans for the beautiful Tosca. Unbeknownst to
her, Scarpia's men followed her to Cavaradossi's villa and
arrest him. Tosca enters Scarpia's chamber and is horrified
to find her lover in chains. She reveals nothing of the loca
tion of Angelotti until she hears the cries of her beloved
from the torture chamber.
As he is dragged away for execution, Cavaradossi curses
Tosca. She appeals to Scarpia for his life, and a sordid deal

is struck. Before Tosca gives herself to her loathsome in
quisitor, she procures a letter of pardon and the promise of
a mock execution. Then, with the two alone in the palace
chamber, Tosca lungs at her aggressor with a knife, and he
falls to the ground.
In the final act, outside the castle that night, Cavarados
si is ragged before his executioners. He gains permission to
write a final farewell to his beloved, but Tosca runs over to
explain that it is to be a mock execution. Tosca conceals
herself and waits until the soldiers fire and leave.
Then as she approaches her beloved, she realizes that ii
has all gone wrong. The soldiers discover the body of their
chief, and the fatal conclusion ensues.
Mansouri's "Tosca" is a traditional interpretation and a
crowd pleaser. He has managed to recreate the most dra
matic moments with clarity and precision. The sets and
lighting ensure that the tension mounts with a complex
blend of aggression and suspense. There is depth and feel
ing inside the church; and unlike other budget adjustments
found in other companies, the torture chamber concept is
not dismissively simple. Perhaps most importantly in this
type of staging, the costumer has spared no expense.
The orchestra was also superbly rehearsed under the
baton of Nello Santi; and the busier scenes, which can often
fall victim to hesitation, were thrust along successfully. It's
difficult to find fault in this production.
The choice of Carol Vaness was a stroke of genius. She
rose to the challenge of Puccini's lustrous, arching arias.
And the trio of Margison, Morris and Vaness further en
hanced the drama of the production.
Tosca plays tonight and runs again with an altered cast
in January. Call the box office at (415) 861-4008 for more
information.
