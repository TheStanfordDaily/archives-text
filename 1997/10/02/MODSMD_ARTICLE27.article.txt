# 20 SCREEN MONSTER-PLEX OPENS

Finally, movie tickets for under $5!
That was my first reaction to the new
AMC Mercado 20, the 20-screen
megaplex that opened last Friday in
Santa Clara. The theater offers student
discounts so that a movie costs only
$4.75.
I went there with a friend on open
ing night to see how the place compares
to Shoreline where tickets cost $7.50.
The megaplex was swarmed with
people searching for parking spaces and
creating them along the walls of the
other buildings in the shopping center.
We overheard one manager yelling to a
worker about how they forgot to paint
the curb in front of the theater red. So
the loading zone was comically loaded
with parked cars.
The "Star Tours" experience
When you walk into one of the the
aters, it's like walking into "Star Tours,"
the ride at Disneyland. Three iron-solid
bars separate the upper section of seats
from the lower level. In the center void
of the theater there's a section for dis

abled people (kudos for that). It has
only three seats, each one 10 yards away
from the other. The whole thing looks
like some sort of sci-fi fantasy ship
where the disabled people get to be the
navigators.
The theater is one of the first in the
area to offer stadium seating, which
means 1) you sit three or four feet be
neath the person behind you and 2) you
have an unobstructed view. The seats
are cozy but the backs are so high that if
you want put your arm around your
date, you can't.
My friend, who had some stranger's
Keds hanging above his head, was less
keen on the seats.
AMC is somewhat stingy on screen
size. The actors are about twice as big as
they would be in real life. One theater
goer compared it to a really large Super
bowl party screen.
The Logistics
The megaplex planners cleverly di
vided the complex into three different
sections, with three snack areas. A good
idea, but not enough of a help when
there are 20 screens-worth of people
waiting for food.

There are several bathrooms
throughout the theater that seem to pop
up around every corner, which is good.
More bathrooms mean fewer lines and
less distance if you have to go during the
show.
The complex owners go to great
lengths to make it as easy as possible for
you to part with your money. The same
shows run on three or four different
screens at a time, so you can essentially
just show up and have a good chance of
finding the movie you want to see, as
long as it isn't sold out. Even 20 screens
isn't enough to prevent shows from sell
ing out.
One unique feature of the megaplex
is that you can buy tickets with your
credit card at a ticket-vending machine
from the front. You can buy tickets in
the traditional ways as well.
The verdict
All things considered, it was a good
theater experience, but not a great one;
the small screen and zealous parking
crowd detracted. At $4.75, it's still a
pretty good deal. If the theater can sort
out its chaotic growing pains, it'll prob
ably be a great place to go.
