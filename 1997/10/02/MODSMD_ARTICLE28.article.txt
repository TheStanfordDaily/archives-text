# CATS OPENS IN BAY AREA
## 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Cats may have nine lives, but this
week's performance of the Broadway
musical "Cats" only has two weeks in
the Bay Area.
The play is based on T.S. Eliot's
book "Old Possum's Book of Practi
cal Cats," with music by Andrew
Lloyd Webber.
"Cats" is performed by a theater
company called the National Tour of
Cats, one of only four companies in
the world that is allowed to perform
the play.
l-'ans of the musical can rejoice be
cause there are almost no detectable
differences between this show and
the Broadway one. The music and
lyrics are the same. The set was de
signed by John Napier who .ilso cre
ated the set for Broadway. According
to Jim Ambler, an actor in the pro
duction, "it's almost the exact same
show you would see on Broadway."
About the only difference between

this show and its New York counter
part is the cast itself. This group has
been on the road for 10 years, helping
make "Cats" the longest running
musical since its 19HI opening in
London. "Its a great time to be a part
of' Cats,' " Ambler observed. "People
come and see it and still love it. Peo
ple who see it for the first time are
wondering why they hadn't seen it
earlier."
"Cats" opened this Tuesday at the
(idden (iate Theater in San Francis
co. It will run for two weeks.
