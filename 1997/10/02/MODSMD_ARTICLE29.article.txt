# The 						Genius' arrives:
## Ray Charles kicks off the 1997-98 Stanford Lively Arts Season 
### Soren Johnson Staff writer 
In the black musical culture of 20th century
America, nicknames do not come easily. Little
Richard and Little Stevie Wonder received theirs
for succeeding at such a young age. The names of
Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf reflect the very
nature of their music. James Brown is "The hardest
working man in show business" because he earned
the title.
Ray (Charles is known as The Genius...
In 1936, a six-year old child of an impoverished
family from Greenville, Fla., began to display

symptoms of glaucoma, which would soon cause
him to lose his sight. While growing up, he had
learned to play piano, alto saxophone, organ, clar
inet, and trumpet as well as write music in Braille.
After suffering through the deaths of both his
brother and father, this child became a teenage or
phan following his mother's death in 1945. Two
years later, this young man left the South for Seat
tle to make a living from the only thing he had left;
his music.
On Sept. 30, 1997 at 8:30 p.m., Ray Charles
Robinson stepped onto the stage at Memorial Au
ditorium to thunderous and familiar applause.
The 12 time Grammy winner's smile gleamed to

the very last seat of the balcony. His 16-piece band
had warmed up the audience for a solid 20 min
utes, and the man was now ready to do his thing.
After performing a couple R&B standards, in
cluding "Let's Get It On," Charles' voice was
warmed up enough to deliver a powerfully emo
tional reading of "Georgia On My Mind." To the
audience, its effect was like the discovery of an as
tonishing beauty never to be forgotten.
In 1949, Swing Time Records gave Ray Charles
a chance to record, and he sang cocktail jazz in the
style of Charles Brown and Nat "King" Cole. His
music was polished and sophisticated, nothing that
would ever set the world on fire.

Three
years later, after
Atlantic pur
chased his con
tract, Charles'
musical style
began to change as
he experimented
with (using the vo
cals of gospel with
the rhythms of
jump-blues. By
the time he cut "I
Got A Woman" in
Charles had
invented an en
tirely new genre
soon to be called
soul music. The
sounds of the
black church were
secularized with
songs like "Hal
lelujah 1 Love Her
So." With the ad
dition of the
Raelettes, his fe
male chorus,
1959's "What'd I
Say" sounded like
the most sexually
charged church
service in America
and became his
first million-sell
er.
To mu c h
of black America,
however, Charles'
music was noth
ing short of blas
phemy. "What'd I
Say" was banned
on many stations.
According to the
blues legend Big
Bill Broon/.y,
"He's mixing the
blues with the
spirituals. He
should be singing
in church."
Charles
had crossed a line
no one had dared
to before him, and
his vision changed
the landscape of

American music. Little Richard turned a super
charged version of his music into rock and roll.
Further, the soul of James Brown, Sam Cooke and
Otis Redding would be unimaginable without Ray
Charles' example.
By 8:50 p.m., sweat began to run down Ray
Charles'cheek. Caught in the grips of his music, he
periodically rose as if constrained by his piano
bench. Returning to his seat, Charles convulsively
swayed his body to the music, stomping his feet in
time.
After strong versions of "Crazy After All These
Years" and "You Made Me Love You," Charles
slowly entered into "Angelina," a gorgeous ballad.
His voice has lost little of its emotional power over
the years. The band remained subdued for that
moment, as Ray Charles needed little help to stun
the crowd.
In the 19605, Ray Charles began to drift away
from soul music. After releasing a few surprisingly
successful albums of country and western stan
dards played with a R&B flavor, Charles began to
float between genres. Mostly, he produced bland
pop with only occasional signs of his former mas
tery of soul. Returning to nostalgic show-tunes, his
music began to resemble his early years when he
was polished and sophisticated. He was a heretic no
more.
In 1991, Time magazine named Charles' Diet
Pepsi ads, which also including the Raelettes, Cam
paign of the Year. To a new generation of Ameri
cans, Ray Charles was not a revolutionary, but a
salesman.
At 9:10 p.m., the Raelettes joined Charles on
stage. Unlike the racially mixed band, Ray Charles'
chorus of five females, dressed in dark brown, was
a reminder of his black roots, (living the Raelettes
a chance to sing, he rolled through a few songs
from his cocktail jazz beginnings, including
"Knock On Wood" and "People Are Gonna Say
We're In Love." Earlier, Charles delivered an un
usually jazzed-up version of "Some Enchanted
Evening."
Unfortunately, the sound was less than optimal,
making these show tunes, which rely so much on
lyrical content, a disappointment. Moreover, the
band's balance occasionally suffered during the
concert; one guitar solo was noticeably overhear
ing.
For the lull concert, Charles had also replaced
his customary piano with the more modern svn
thesizer. Regrettably, the fears of musical purists
became reality as the artificial sound of the instru
ment often distracted attention from the music
overall. On "I'm Singin' My Song For You,
("harles' beautiful and evocative vocals were negat
ed by the sound of space-age trumpets. Why here
fused to use the real thing is indeed a mystery. As
the musical critic J. D. Considine once wrote, "even
the most sympathetic listener (wishes] that
|( harles' | judgment was as sterling as his talent.
At 9:25 p.m., Ray Charles and the Raelettes
launched into his masterpiece, "What'd I Say," to
close the concert. The intro has changed some over
the years, but the song's groove remained as vi
brant as ever. The music dipped and swirled as the
sound began to convey a physical release, while the
call-and-response interplay between Charles and
his chorus turned the music into the concert's di
max. The audience finally got a glimpse of the
power and glory that is soul music.
The Genius had arrived at Stanford.
