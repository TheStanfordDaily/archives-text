Geeks on love. Steven J. Frank's 1996 Pocket
Rocket Prize-winning first novel, "The Uncertainty
Principle," is a funny, clever look at an MIT under
graduate's travails as he negotiates that roller coaster
ride known as a research project. Along the way,
wonderkid-narrator Paul Bustamante takes on the
high adventure of venture capitalist sharks, a some
times Zen mystic adviser he doesn't completely trust
and a girlfriend who is at least as smart as he is.
Although the beginning of the book is a bit of a
slog through a contrived summer camp scene, the
fun picks up when Paul arrives at MIT sometime
during his undergraduate career. Sadly, Paul feels
that EDGAR, the campus computer, is his biggest
friend and fan.
A prototypical scientific prodigy, Paul's reduc
tionist approach to life (reinforced by the venture
capitalists) means that he misses the implications of
a lot of his interactions with people. Although Paul
somehow ignores the people central to his life, even
tually he's influenced by some of his more peripher
al contacts.
One such person is his eccentric great-uncle
once-removed who pretends senility so he can think;
another is his roommate's girlfriend, whose well-de
veloped sense of wonder at the natural world's beau
ty annoys Paul.
Paul's dawning realization that he really doesn't
understand his friends and family is neatly dealt with
by Frank, whose prose does not dwell on reflective
introspection. The book's happy but somewhat
abrupt ending is satisfying and bereft of drippy sen
timent.
Readers unsatisfied with the end of Paul's narra
tive can find resolution in an epilogue Frank has
written in the voice of Paul's adviser, the yogi-quot
ing professor. In the form of a review-type scientific
paper, the shift in narrator and perspective also gives
Frank an opportunity to compare Paul's perspective
with that of his bhagwan.
Although thin on character observation (in keep
ing with the soul of the scientific narrator), the plot
rips right along. Frank's brisk prose amuses with its
frequent mathematical phrasings of the ordinary
phenomena in life, interlacing sex and physics in
grand nerd style — "I'm supposed to tell you what a
big dynamic RAM you have? Pay homage to your re
fresh rate?" Those who don't relish scientific
metaphors had best stay away.
As well, the technology-loving culture of MI T is
displayed for observation — most intriguingly, in
the guise of the fictional campus computer, F.I KiAR.
"The Uncertainty Principle" offers readers many
insights into the world of research, with its sharp ob
servations 011 the passions involved, the way funding
is obtained and the gaps between researchers, tech
nology licensers, marketers and the general public.
Equally important, Frank deftly takes readers
through the machinations of Paul's analytically bril
liant but emotionally immature mind. I was left
smiling when Paul finally learned to stop intellectu
alizing and just appreciate a nice sunset.
