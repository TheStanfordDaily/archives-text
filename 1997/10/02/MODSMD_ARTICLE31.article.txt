# The 						Uncertainty Principle
## 
### Angela Lee Contributing writer 
Intermission tracked down author Steven I. I'mnk (by e
mail, of course) ami asked Inm to contrast rail life with his

novel, Uncertainty Principle, us well as share a few insights into the intersection of science
atul law.

Intermission: I'm curious as to the basis lor I IXiAR, the MIT computer in the novel.
Is this a real fixture at MIT? II not, is it based on anything real?

Steven Frank: Mil was one of the pi
oncers in creating student oriented com
puter networks with its Athena project
(which still exists, as far as I know, hut has
largely heen supplanted by the Weh). The
idea of FIX JAR, however, like so much in
the book, was less fact than fiction: a way of
illuminating the soul of the place more than
describing an actual artifact. FIX iAR repre
sents one of those technology totems in
which we place so much faith too much
faith, perhaps, for our own good. I I X lAR is
mythologized into a sentient force the way
the Internet is today. I low that affects our
thinking and behavior is something I tried to
explore.
I: I low big, do you feel, is the gap be
tween researchers and technology licensers!'
And how have your experiences colored
your view of venture capitalists, who don't
come off all that well in the book?
SF: The gap between tech licensers
and researchers is closing rapidly, especially
at institutions whose specialty is tei hnology.
University licensing departments, for exam
pie, have become extremely sophisticated
about business arrangements to the good of
all involved; they have also grown closer to
researchers. A certain traditional rivalry and
mutual suspicion seems to be disappearing
Hut this is less so with venture capitalists.
Some are savvy. Most are hungry. To them,
a new venture is one more portfolio com pa
ny with performance expectations; to there
searchers, it's a life's dream. My rendition in
the book was a bit one sided, hut deliberate
ly so, since it reflected the perspective of the
researcher.
In fairness, scientists can drive their
|venture capitalists! cra/y. A lot of them
think they're smarter than these mere
"bankers" .it everything, including hanking
and business. So, as between science and
sales, I think the gulf is permanent but
when you think about it, maybe the tension
is healthy.
I: What made you decide to leave
your career as .1 researcher and become a
patent attorney?
SF: I hated lab. I lated if. Foved learn
ingahout science, loved theory,but couldn't
stand monitoring temperatures every two
minutes for hours on end. Also, I've always

liked dealing with people and solving problems. As I began to gel a sense ol how clue
less most of the legal profession is about science and the social distortions created l>v
such cluelessness, going to law school started to make a lot of sense.
And I've never regretted it. Patent law is about mediating between two worlds the
world of technology and the world of law th.it ordinarily repel each other as like
charges. In mv humble opinion, it's fun being a spectator; you get to see such a wide va
rietv of subject matter.
