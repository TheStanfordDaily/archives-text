Corporation, Pearson, Ber
telsmann, Sumner Redstone's Viacom and
S.I. Newhouse's Advance. According to
newsprint magazine The Nation, these eight
companies virtually control book publishing
in America and the world today.
If books collect and distribute ideas, as
most of us believe they do, it's more than
troubling that such a small group of first
world multinational corporations control
where, when and to whom ideas (books) are
released. While these eight are probably not
planting subliminal messages in their winter
releases, they are printing books with creativ
ity and thought playing second fiddle to prof
it.
Literature and thoughtful non-fiction are
risky propositions for publishers, because
bookstores have limited commitment to the
physical book. Cookbooks and self-help texts
might hang around a store for ages, but will
eventually sell. On the other hand, if a novel
fails to take off there is little or no chance it
ever will.
In order to keep the winners stocked,
booksellers clear shelf space by returning
books that aren't selling. It is unique to the
book industry that retailers can return unsold
copies. And when that happens, the publish
ers suck up the costs.
In this uncertain environment, the
megashops aren't taking any chances. Their
interest in commercial successes with a few
select books limits their interest in low- and
mid-list selections. They keep the pipeline
obvious and narrow, hoping desperately that
their old reliables and a few sleeper hits will
net them through the season. Low sellers are
forgotten. Yes, this is the way of the market
place, but it is also the very thing that will ef
fect the way our society thinks.

What do you do when the publishing in
dustry is awash with Grishams and Steeles?
What do you do when you love art and you
want to give it to people? What do you do
when people who have significant but non
marketable things to say cannot find a place
to say them?
You could start a small press called Cune
in a grassroots effort to collect writers and
artists. You build a book from their ideas and
efforts. You make every effort to start a revo
lution. You do commendable work.
You need to start from a whole different

mindset, but you do commendable work.
"An liar to the Ground," a 1997 antholo
gy edited by Scott C. Davis that features near
ly 100 writers and artists, is a political state
ment about how publishing is important to a
culture. Davis and company created this an
thology in order to liberate ideas that would

not be recognized unless someone searched
them out and gave them light.
His company, Cune Press, is trying to es
tablish an alternative to the gluttony of the
large corporate publishing houses. People
working at Cune Press contend that these
houses have sacrificed original texts in favor

of blockbuster trash.
Each contributor to "An Ear to the
Ground" is represented by a short piece, ei
ther some kind of personal essay or statement
of purpose. These are bookended by an orig
inal portrait, ail essay about them by a friend
or colleague and a quick bio. Unfortunately,
the biographical essays are often more in
sightful than the actual piece.
The sad truth is that Cune Press' worth -
while effort to publish the work of interesting,
valuable people has left it somewhat bereft of
interesting material. The editors seem to have
looked more for the writer than the writing.
But if the author is so important, perhaps
more important than the piece itself, why not
just have a compendium of author interviews
or something along the vein of, "Get them
while they're hot and unknown! The writers
of the 21st century."
Several of these contemplative pieces try
to demonstrate some kind of greater under
standing the authors have gained through
personal experience. However, many of the
pieces fail the form of the personal essay by
neglecting either the experience or the lesson
gained. Some have only experience. "I rode a
roller coaster. It was scary." Or, "1 was on a
train once and we thought we were gonna be
hijacked... but nothing happened." Others
have only a political statement, without any
attractive background detail on how the indi
vidual arrived at this belief.
Almost all of the pieces end too quickly.
The reader is drawn in, then abruptly thrown
off. Pages 1 wish were spent expanding and
resolving the details of the stories are instead
used for the biographical expositions.
The metaphor I'll naturally have to make
here is to interrupted sex. You're all wrapped
up with a person, close and wanting more,
when suddenly the person announces that he
or she is tired or just can't do it tonight. You
really want to be understanding, because you
like them and all, but despite all your sympa
thy you are still left with a feeling of distinct
discomfort and frustration.
However, several of the pieces are truly
compelling. lames Bash regrets the absence of
alleys in Portland's urban design. Stanford
English Prof. John Felstiner writes wonder
fully on his "search" for Kafka. Hillary Rollins
is charming as she relates how she fell for the
persuasive late-night infomercials of the
luiceman. And Frederic Hunter, in "Fathers
and Sons," wrote so gracefully about the sep
arations between parents and children that he
made me want to call my father.
There are actually quite a few good pieces
in this book, but they are mixed in with
strained and simplistic ones that "An Ear to
