# Wisdom you won't get from Grisham: Small presses bring creativity back into publishing

* F er, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation, Pearson, Ber
telsmann, Sumner Redstone's Viacom and
S.I. Newhouse's Advance. According to
newsprint magazine The Nation, these eight
companies virtually control book publishing
in America and the world today.
If books collect and distribute ideas, as
most of us believe they do, it's more than
troubling that such a small group of first
world multinational corporations control
where, when and to whom ideas (books) are
released. While these eight are probably not
planting subliminal messages in their winter
releases, they are printing books with creativ
ity and thought playing second fiddle to prof
it.
Literature and thoughtful non-fiction are
risky propositions for publishers, because
bookstores have limited commitment to the
physical book. Cookbooks and self-help texts
might hang around a store for ages, but will
eventually sell. On the other hand, if a novel
fails to take off there is little or no chance it
ever will.
In order to keep the winners stocked,
booksellers clear shelf space by returning
books that aren't selling. It is unique to the
book industry that retailers can return unsold
copies. And when that happens, the publish
ers suck up the costs.
In this uncertain environment, the
megashops aren't taking any chances. Their
interest in commercial successes with a few
select books limits their interest in low- and
mid-list selections. They keep the pipeline
obvious and narrow, hoping desperately that
their old reliables and a few sleeper hits will
net them through the season. Low sellers are
forgotten. Yes, this is the way of the market
place, but it is also the very thing that will ef
fect the way our society thinks.
Look Ma, I made a book
What do you do when the publishing in
dustry is awash with Grishams and Steeles?
What do you do when you love art and you
want to give it to people? What do you do
when people who have significant but non
marketable things to say cannot find a place
to say them?
You could start a small press called Cune
in a grassroots effort to collect writers and
artists. You build a book from their ideas and
efforts. You make every effort to start a revo
lution. You do commendable work.
You need to start from a whole different

mindset, but you do commendable work.
"An liar to the Ground," a 1997 antholo
gy edited by Scott C. Davis that features near
ly 100 writers and artists, is a political state
ment about how publishing is important to a
culture. Davis and company created this an
thology in order to liberate ideas that would

not be recognized unless someone searched
them out and gave them light.
His company, Cune Press, is trying to es
tablish an alternative to the gluttony of the
large corporate publishing houses. People
working at Cune Press contend that these
houses have sacrificed original texts in favor

of blockbuster trash.
Each contributor to "An Ear to the
Ground" is represented by a short piece, ei
ther some kind of personal essay or statement
of purpose. These are bookended by an orig
inal portrait, ail essay about them by a friend
or colleague and a quick bio. Unfortunately,
the biographical essays are often more in
sightful than the actual piece.
The sad truth is that Cune Press' worth -
while effort to publish the work of interesting,
valuable people has left it somewhat bereft of
interesting material. The editors seem to have
looked more for the writer than the writing.
But if the author is so important, perhaps
more important than the piece itself, why not
just have a compendium of author interviews
or something along the vein of, "Get them
while they're hot and unknown! The writers
of the 21st century."
Several of these contemplative pieces try
to demonstrate some kind of greater under
standing the authors have gained through
personal experience. However, many of the
pieces fail the form of the personal essay by
neglecting either the experience or the lesson
gained. Some have only experience. "I rode a
roller coaster. It was scary." Or, "1 was on a
train once and we thought we were gonna be
hijacked... but nothing happened." Others
have only a political statement, without any
attractive background detail on how the indi
vidual arrived at this belief.
Almost all of the pieces end too quickly.
The reader is drawn in, then abruptly thrown
off. Pages 1 wish were spent expanding and
resolving the details of the stories are instead
used for the biographical expositions.
The metaphor I'll naturally have to make
here is to interrupted sex. You're all wrapped
up with a person, close and wanting more,
when suddenly the person announces that he
or she is tired or just can't do it tonight. You
really want to be understanding, because you
like them and all, but despite all your sympa
thy you are still left with a feeling of distinct
discomfort and frustration.
However, several of the pieces are truly
compelling. lames Bash regrets the absence of
alleys in Portland's urban design. Stanford
English Prof. John Felstiner writes wonder
fully on his "search" for Kafka. Hillary Rollins
is charming as she relates how she fell for the
persuasive late-night infomercials of the
luiceman. And Frederic Hunter, in "Fathers
and Sons," wrote so gracefully about the sep
arations between parents and children that he
made me want to call my father.
There are actually quite a few good pieces
in this book, but they are mixed in with
strained and simplistic ones that "An Ear to

the Ground" could have done
without. Just as crucially
wounding to the book is the
lack of a truly unifying theme.
This book has a motivation, but
1 think a central thesis would
have done it some good, forcing
more editing and insisting on
relevance.
Although the subtitle of the
book is "Presenting Writers
from Two Coasts," perhaps
presenting "writing" from two
coasts would have been more
worthwhile. As interesting as
authors may be, books are
bought because of what they say
and how they say it, and less so
because of who is doing the say
ing.
If the writing does not have a
catch or if it gives up when the
tale is getting taut, the reader
will look elsewhere. Unfortu
nately, the personality and vi
sion of the people behind "An
Far to the Ground" cannot
make up for its frequently uno
riginal and bland ideas.
The roots of grassroots
publishing
Small presses like Cune and
university publishing organs
like our own Stanford Universi
ty Press are being issued the re
sponsibility of diversifying and
deepening our collective intelli
gence. The risks are great, and
failures are common. But there

is also a different ethic at heart here, and it
seems that something hopeful is taking root.
In 1965, the International Directory of Lit
tle Magazines and Small Presses listed 250
publishers. In 1997, the same directory
demonstrate- 'he phenomenal growth of the
small press' vhen it listed 6000 publishers.
Small t. use publishing is very much a
child of the '60s, a time when special interest
groups began establishing presses to distrib
ute their ideas. Some were small literary pub
lishers, others had ideological bents such as
ethnic or feminist literature.
During the '70s, distribution networks
began to grow up and these tiny presses (usu
ally characterized by printing less than 15,000
copies in a year) were able to get their vol
umes into stores. Finally, in the 80s, the per
sonal computer and desktop publishing ar
rived on the small press scene, making pub
lishing available to an ever-wider audience.
Small presses make it possible for mothers
to publish the books they wrote for their chil
dren, local history societies can tell the tale of
their town and unique, non commercial nov
elists can share their stories beyond their im
mediate family and friends. Small presses also
resuscitate lost, out-of-print works, expand
ing the number of copies available and mak
ing sure they get into the hands of libraries,
thinkers and interested readers.
University presses work in a similar fash
ion. The thesis, long-considered and slaved
over by the doctoral candidate, is chiseled and
polished into book form. University presses
guarantee that the ideas of their thinkers have
as much chance to be read as the thinkers

from the school down the road. These books
don't make money, and they usually don't
make waves. But intellectualism isn't dead
yet, and the university presses are essential to
the academic enterprise.
Books so arcane even grad students are
bored
The Stanford University Press is a subsi
dized scholastic publisher dedicated to the
work of academic thinkers. University press
es fill an important niche in the book market
by producing and selling intellectual works.
The commercial houses generally pass these
texts over because their profit potential is
marginal.
Stanford's press currently has about 1500
works in print. Recent titles include "The
Mottled Screen: Reading Proust Visually," by
Mieke Bal and "History in a Grotesque Key:
Russian Literature and the Idea of Revolu
tion," by Kevin M. F. Piatt.
According to University Press Marketing
Manager Bob Lloyd, "The original idea [be
hind university presses) was to take the re
sults of research by professors and grad stu
dents and publish it. However, most disser
tations are not in book form, they are writ
ten to prove something — but most of us
don't want to read every footnote. So (Uni
versity Press) acts as a filter. The ideas in our
books should be new and good, and ad
dressed to more than three dissertation ad
visers."
But in the contemporary publishing cli
mate, the most arcane academic works are no
longer attractive, as even subsidized presses
must pay attention to costs and sales.

"Most universities support their presses,
but they're expected to at least break even,"
says Lloyd. Stanford's press is subsidized by
the University, while "some presses have huge
endowments. I larvard and Princeton, for ex
ample. They can operate on the interest
alone."
As for the future of the university press,
Lloyd expects the physical book to continue
going strong. Although technological ad
vancement will continue to change the nature
of the book business, Lloyd believes that
"photocopying has actually had more effect
that the Web."
The changing nature of the book-buying
public has affected university presses as well
as commercial publishers. Efficiency and
market awareness are essential for all publish

ing houses to succeed. 1 lowever, the publish
ing industry should be wary of abandoning
creative works in l«ivor of formulaic best
sellers.
There is a tendency to give our silent
blessing to capitalism. Let the market work
itself out, they say; the good will rise to the
top and profits shall reveal the true value of
a book. Hut this tendency is insidious and
reinforces consumerism over considera
tion.
In this last most important thing, books
ideas we must collectively select quality
and wisdom before the glittering appeal of
money and marketing. Small presses are es
sential to distributing these ideas and should
be recognized for their significant cultural
impact.

tion," by Kevin M. F. Piatt.
According to University Press Marketing
Manager Bob Lloyd, "The original idea [be
hind university presses) was to take the re
sults of research by professors and grad stu
dents and publish it. However, most disser
tations are not in book form, they are writ
ten to prove something — but most of us
don't want to read every footnote. So (Uni
versity Press) acts as a filter. The ideas in our
books should be new and good, and ad
dressed to more than three dissertation ad
visers."
But in the contemporary publishing cli
mate, the most arcane academic works are no
longer attractive, as even subsidized presses
must pay attention to costs and sales.

"Most universities support their presses,
but they're expected to at least break even,"
says Lloyd. Stanford's press is subsidized by
the University, while "some presses have huge
endowments. I larvard and Princeton, for ex
ample. They can operate on the interest
alone."
As for the future of the university press,
Lloyd expects the physical book to continue
going strong. Although technological ad
vancement will continue to change the nature
of the book business, Lloyd believes that
"photocopying has actually had more effect
that the Web."
The changing nature of the book-buying
public has affected university presses as well
as commercial publishers. Efficiency and
market awareness are essential for all publish

ing houses to succeed. 1 lowever, the publish
ing industry should be wary of abandoning
creative works in l«ivor of formulaic best
sellers.
There is a tendency to give our silent
blessing to capitalism. Let the market work
itself out, they say; the good will rise to the
top and profits shall reveal the true value of
a book. Hut this tendency is insidious and
reinforces consumerism over considera
tion.
In this last most important thing, books
ideas we must collectively select quality
and wisdom before the glittering appeal of
money and marketing. Small presses are es
sential to distributing these ideas and should
be recognized for their significant cultural
impact.

W Try Hearst, Time Warn
* F er, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation, Pearson, Ber
telsmann, Sumner Redstone's Viacom and
S.I. Newhouse's Advance. According to
newsprint magazine The Nation, these eight
companies virtually control book publishing
in America and the world today.
If books collect and distribute ideas, as
most of us believe they do, it's more than
troubling that such a small group of first
world multinational corporations control
where, when and to whom ideas (books) are
released. While these eight are probably not
planting subliminal messages in their winter
releases, they are printing books with creativ
ity and thought playing second fiddle to prof
it.
Literature and thoughtful non-fiction are
risky propositions for publishers, because
bookstores have limited commitment to the
physical book. Cookbooks and self-help texts
might hang around a store for ages, but will
eventually sell. On the other hand, if a novel
fails to take off there is little or no chance it
ever will.
In order to keep the winners stocked,
booksellers clear shelf space by returning
books that aren't selling. It is unique to the
book industry that retailers can return unsold
copies. And when that happens, the publish
ers suck up the costs.
In this uncertain environment, the
megashops aren't taking any chances. Their
interest in commercial successes with a few
select books limits their interest in low- and
mid-list selections. They keep the pipeline
obvious and narrow, hoping desperately that
their old reliables and a few sleeper hits will
net them through the season. Low sellers are
forgotten. Yes, this is the way of the market
place, but it is also the very thing that will ef
fect the way our society thinks.
Look Ma, I made a book
What do you do when the publishing in
dustry is awash with Grishams and Steeles?
What do you do when you love art and you
want to give it to people? What do you do
when people who have significant but non
marketable things to say cannot find a place
to say them?
You could start a small press called Cune
in a grassroots effort to collect writers and
artists. You build a book from their ideas and
efforts. You make every effort to start a revo
lution. You do commendable work.
You need to start from a whole different

mindset, but you do commendable work.
"An liar to the Ground," a 1997 antholo
gy edited by Scott C. Davis that features near
ly 100 writers and artists, is a political state
ment about how publishing is important to a
culture. Davis and company created this an
thology in order to liberate ideas that would

not be recognized unless someone searched
them out and gave them light.
His company, Cune Press, is trying to es
tablish an alternative to the gluttony of the
large corporate publishing houses. People
working at Cune Press contend that these
houses have sacrificed original texts in favor

of blockbuster trash.
Each contributor to "An Ear to the
Ground" is represented by a short piece, ei
ther some kind of personal essay or statement
of purpose. These are bookended by an orig
inal portrait, ail essay about them by a friend
or colleague and a quick bio. Unfortunately,
the biographical essays are often more in
sightful than the actual piece.
The sad truth is that Cune Press' worth -
while effort to publish the work of interesting,
valuable people has left it somewhat bereft of
interesting material. The editors seem to have
looked more for the writer than the writing.
But if the author is so important, perhaps
more important than the piece itself, why not
just have a compendium of author interviews
or something along the vein of, "Get them
while they're hot and unknown! The writers
of the 21st century."
Several of these contemplative pieces try
to demonstrate some kind of greater under
standing the authors have gained through
personal experience. However, many of the
pieces fail the form of the personal essay by
neglecting either the experience or the lesson
gained. Some have only experience. "I rode a
roller coaster. It was scary." Or, "1 was on a
train once and we thought we were gonna be
hijacked... but nothing happened." Others
have only a political statement, without any
attractive background detail on how the indi
vidual arrived at this belief.
Almost all of the pieces end too quickly.
The reader is drawn in, then abruptly thrown
off. Pages 1 wish were spent expanding and
resolving the details of the stories are instead
used for the biographical expositions.
The metaphor I'll naturally have to make
here is to interrupted sex. You're all wrapped
up with a person, close and wanting more,
when suddenly the person announces that he
or she is tired or just can't do it tonight. You
really want to be understanding, because you
like them and all, but despite all your sympa
thy you are still left with a feeling of distinct
discomfort and frustration.
However, several of the pieces are truly
compelling. lames Bash regrets the absence of
alleys in Portland's urban design. Stanford
English Prof. John Felstiner writes wonder
fully on his "search" for Kafka. Hillary Rollins
is charming as she relates how she fell for the
persuasive late-night infomercials of the
luiceman. And Frederic Hunter, in "Fathers
and Sons," wrote so gracefully about the sep
arations between parents and children that he
made me want to call my father.
There are actually quite a few good pieces
in this book, but they are mixed in with
strained and simplistic ones that "An Ear to

the Ground" could have done
without. Just as crucially
wounding to the book is the
lack of a truly unifying theme.
This book has a motivation, but
1 think a central thesis would
have done it some good, forcing
more editing and insisting on
relevance.
Although the subtitle of the
book is "Presenting Writers
from Two Coasts," perhaps
presenting "writing" from two
coasts would have been more
worthwhile. As interesting as
authors may be, books are
bought because of what they say
and how they say it, and less so
because of who is doing the say
ing.
If the writing does not have a
catch or if it gives up when the
tale is getting taut, the reader
will look elsewhere. Unfortu
nately, the personality and vi
sion of the people behind "An
Far to the Ground" cannot
make up for its frequently uno
riginal and bland ideas.
The roots of grassroots
publishing
Small presses like Cune and
university publishing organs
like our own Stanford Universi
ty Press are being issued the re
sponsibility of diversifying and
deepening our collective intelli
gence. The risks are great, and
failures are common. But there

is also a different ethic at heart here, and it
seems that something hopeful is taking root.
In 1965, the International Directory of Lit
tle Magazines and Small Presses listed 250
publishers. In 1997, the same directory
demonstrate- 'he phenomenal growth of the
small press' vhen it listed 6000 publishers.
Small t. use publishing is very much a
child of the '60s, a time when special interest
groups began establishing presses to distrib
ute their ideas. Some were small literary pub
lishers, others had ideological bents such as
ethnic or feminist literature.
During the '70s, distribution networks
began to grow up and these tiny presses (usu
ally characterized by printing less than 15,000
copies in a year) were able to get their vol
umes into stores. Finally, in the 80s, the per
sonal computer and desktop publishing ar
rived on the small press scene, making pub
lishing available to an ever-wider audience.
Small presses make it possible for mothers
to publish the books they wrote for their chil
dren, local history societies can tell the tale of
their town and unique, non commercial nov
elists can share their stories beyond their im
mediate family and friends. Small presses also
resuscitate lost, out-of-print works, expand
ing the number of copies available and mak
ing sure they get into the hands of libraries,
thinkers and interested readers.
University presses work in a similar fash
ion. The thesis, long-considered and slaved
over by the doctoral candidate, is chiseled and
polished into book form. University presses
guarantee that the ideas of their thinkers have
as much chance to be read as the thinkers

from the school down the road. These books
don't make money, and they usually don't
make waves. But intellectualism isn't dead
yet, and the university presses are essential to
the academic enterprise.
Books so arcane even grad students are
bored
The Stanford University Press is a subsi
dized scholastic publisher dedicated to the
work of academic thinkers. University press
es fill an important niche in the book market
by producing and selling intellectual works.
The commercial houses generally pass these
texts over because their profit potential is
marginal.
Stanford's press currently has about 1500
works in print. Recent titles include "The
Mottled Screen: Reading Proust Visually," by
Mieke Bal and "History in a Grotesque Key:
Russian Literature and the Idea of Revolu
tion," by Kevin M. F. Piatt.
According to University Press Marketing

child of the '60s, a time when special interest
groups began establishing presses to distrib
ute their ideas. Some were small literary pub
lishers, others had ideological bents such as
ethnic or feminist literature.
During the '70s, distribution networks
began to grow up and these tiny presses (usu
ally characterized by printing less than 15,000
copies in a year) were able to get their vol
umes into stores. Finally, in the 80s, the per
sonal computer and desktop publishing ar
rived on the small press scene, making pub
lishing available to an ever-wider audience.
Small presses make it possible for mothers
to publish the books they wrote for their chil
dren, local history societies can tell the tale of
their town and unique, non commercial nov
elists can share their stories beyond their im
mediate family and friends. Small presses also
resuscitate lost, out-of-print works, expand
ing the number of copies available and mak
ing sure they get into the hands of libraries,
thinkers and interested readers.
University presses work in a similar fash
ion. The thesis, long-considered and slaved
over by the doctoral candidate, is chiseled and
polished into book form. University presses
guarantee that the ideas of their thinkers have
as much chance to be read as the thinkers

from the school down the road. These books
don't make money, and they usually don't
make waves. But intellectualism isn't dead
yet, and the university presses are essential to
the academic enterprise.
Books so arcane even grad students are
bored
The Stanford University Press is a subsi
dized scholastic publisher dedicated to the
work of academic thinkers. University press
es fill an important niche in the book market
by producing and selling intellectual works.
The commercial houses generally pass these
texts over because their profit potential is
marginal.
Stanford's press currently has about 1500
works in print. Recent titles include "The
Mottled Screen: Reading Proust Visually," by
Mieke Bal and "History in a Grotesque Key:
Russian Literature and the Idea of Revolu
tion," by Kevin M. F. Piatt.
According to University Press Marketing
Manager Bob Lloyd, "The original idea [be
hind university presses) was to take the re
sults of research by professors and grad stu
dents and publish it. However, most disser
tations are not in book form, they are writ
ten to prove something — but most of us
don't want to read every footnote. So (Uni
versity Press) acts as a filter. The ideas in our
books should be new and good, and ad
dressed to more than three dissertation ad
visers."
But in the contemporary publishing cli
mate, the most arcane academic works are no
longer attractive, as even subsidized presses
must pay attention to costs and sales.

"Most universities support their presses,
but they're expected to at least break even,"
says Lloyd. Stanford's press is subsidized by
the University, while "some presses have huge
endowments. I larvard and Princeton, for ex
ample. They can operate on the interest
alone."
As for the future of the university press,
Lloyd expects the physical book to continue
going strong. Although technological ad
vancement will continue to change the nature
of the book business, Lloyd believes that
"photocopying has actually had more effect
that the Web."
The changing nature of the book-buying
public has affected university presses as well
as commercial publishers. Efficiency and
market awareness are essential for all publish

ing houses to succeed. 1 lowever, the publish
ing industry should be wary of abandoning
creative works in l«ivor of formulaic best
sellers.
There is a tendency to give our silent
blessing to capitalism. Let the market work
itself out, they say; the good will rise to the
top and profits shall reveal the true value of
a book. Hut this tendency is insidious and
reinforces consumerism over considera
tion.
In this last most important thing, books
ideas we must collectively select quality
and wisdom before the glittering appeal of
money and marketing. Small presses are es
sential to distributing these ideas and should
be recognized for their significant cultural
impact.
