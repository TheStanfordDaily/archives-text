# An Interview with Prof. John Felstiner
## 
### Jen Godwin 
On Monday, Sept. 2V, Intermission spoke
with English Prof. John ielstmet about his
participation in "An Ear to the Ground" ami
his essay, "Looking for Kafka," in which he
searches for both rare first editions and a per
sonal connection with Kafka.
Intermission: How did you become in
volved with "An Ear to the Ground"?
John Felstiner: Scott Davis [the editor of
"An Ear to the Ground"] was a student of
mine in the '70s and has remained a dear
friend. Scott is an intrepid mountaineer.
He's climbed McKinley and Mt. Rainier.
This venture reminds me of that. I le's a guy
who wants to get somewhere on his own two
feet.
When he was here he was an English
major and a writer and that's how I got to
know him. He's also a builder and a con
tractor in Seattle, and he built his own
house. He's trekked through Syria. Scott
wrote a book about that which he's Mill try
ing to get sold. 1 tlunk it was those great el
forts and great futility that inspired this
book.
So that's Scott. I le's stayed in touch all
these years. He has published a prize win
ning book on labor movements and a col
lection of short stories, but he wanted to
work cooperatively, with local, emerging
writers. That's how 1 got involved and how
this all came about.
I: How did you come to write 'Looking
for Kafka'?
IF: Well, I had given a lecture on the topic
to the Stanford libraries, and then the Stan
ford magazine published it. This is really the
third version, and it's much smaller. 1 hated
to cut some parts, but 1 think it came out
very nicely.
I: This is a small press work. Along the
same vein, what kind of experiences have
you had with academic presses?
IF: My first book, The Lies of Artabout

Max Bierbom, was published in 1972 by
Knopf. Alter that I began at Stanford, and 1
wrote a book called 'Translating Neruda.'
That was published by the Stanford Press,
and I was very happy with them. They did a
wonderful job. They keep it beautifully in
print. 1 have good feelings about the Stan
ford University Press,. Hut I went to Yale for
my book on Paul Celan, because I wanted a
press with a deeper Jewish list. At the time
Stanford didn't have what I was looking for.
I: When did you start reading Kafka?
1 low did you begin collecting him? Will you
ever write a book about Kalka?
II: As long as I've been reading I've been
fascinated by Kalka, ever since my 20s I've
just loved him. About eight or nine years
ago, I cared about him so much I just want
ed to get closer. I discovered how much
Kalka cared about books. It was wonderful.
At that point I paid much too much to a
Berkeley bookseller lor a copy of 'In the
Penal ('olony.' So beautiful.
I made the decision to only buy books
made in Ins liletime, perhaps something he
had seen or touched. The next step was to
find something in Ins own hand. Several
years ago, his letters were auctioned oil, hut
the letters and the envelopes were sold sepa
rately. I then heard that one of those en
velopes was up for sale, and I bid for it by
telephone. 1 didn't get it. So that's 'Bidding
for Kafka,' |a section of l elstiner s work in
progress |.
The greatest Kalka collection in the
world is held by man in Indianapolis. At one
point recently he sold the whole thing. But
he kept back some of those envelopes. I ol
fered him a variety of different things, final
ly, finally, he traded me for something I had
of Celan's. The envelope was addressed to a
woman named Felice, and the back has Ins
wonderful signature. So th.it part of the
book will he ' Trading for Kafka.'
I think I will write something about him
someday. It will just be a thin volume, but it
will be called 'Looking for Kafka,' like the
lecture and the essay.
