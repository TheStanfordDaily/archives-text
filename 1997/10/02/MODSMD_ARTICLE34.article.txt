## Forest for the Trees Forest for the Trees 
### 
Before you rush out to your local music
store to buy the debut album from Forest for
the Trees, ask yourself the following questions:
Do you read middle school literary magazines
for their literary value? I lave you ever read po
etry aloud while playing bongo drums? Does
the double meaning of the phrase "Forest for
the Trees" seem deep to you?
If you answered yes to any of these ques
tions, you are probably in the target audience
for 112 orest for the Trees'eponymous lirst album.
The record fails in its intention — to probe the
eternal mysteries of human consciousness with
hip-hop beats and fat bass lines.
The group consists of Carl Stephenson, his
computer and several guest musicians. The
most famous of these is Reck, whose hit "Loser"
was co-wrilten by Stephenson.
The first track, "Dream," sums up every
thing that is right and wrong with the album.
Musically, "I )ream" is a melange of different in
struments and sounds that mix together in a
surprisingly logical fashion. Opening with the
wailing of bagpipes, it settles into a supple sitar
riffand then meanders through roaring waves,
falling rain and some bleating lambs who are
given a brief solo.
However, the grade-school lyrics keep the
song from being enjoyable on anything besides
a purely humorous level. The chorus states
"When I am dreaming/1 don't know il I'm
truly asleep or il I'm awake/and when I get
up /1 don't know if I'm truly awake, or il I'm
still dreaming." Buddha could not have said it
any better.
This pseudo beatnik poetry approach to
lyrics prevails throughout the album, ruining
the good songs and making the bail ones ab
solutely unlistenable. For instance, the song
"You (xeate the Reason" includes the lyrics
"There's a superstring theory/that there are
ten dimensions / six of which are so small / we
never see them."
Although the lyrics are overlaid on a hip
hop rhythm, they are sung a-rhythmically,
which comes out as a mess.
I )espite this Haw, there are a few genuine
ly enjoyable songs. The most appealing is
"Infinite ('ow," which skillfully mixes several
voices together (including spirited backup
vocals from beck) to create the impression of
a conversation in a crowded room. Also, the
chorus "How now, infinite cow" seems to

poke fun at the nonsensical platitudes that
pervade the album, such as "Oedipus is
bliss."
So if you're a Beck collector, or if you like to

get deep when you get down, or even if you
think "It's important that people consider the
fact / that the mind may be a mathematical ab
stract," (from "You Create The Reason") you

might want to get this album. Otherwise, I
would just save my money for an Introduction
to Philosophy textbook.
