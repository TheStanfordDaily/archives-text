# 311 Transistor
## 
### 
In its new release " Transistor," the pro
marijuana reggae punkers 311 push their
sound to its limit. The hand's music has always
been typified hv the melodic vocals of
Nicholas Hexum and 4th grade bully-sound
ing rap performances by SA Martinez, while
the instrumentation has been fueled by catchy
beats and powerful guitar riffs.
but with "Transistor," 311 ventures into
previously uncharted musical waters. The
seemingly limitless energy that bobbed heads
and shook rumps on 31 fs three previous al
bums has been eclipsed by sunshine leel-good

songs like "Beautiful Disaster," "Use ot Time,"
the spaced-out "Light Years" and the slow psy
chedelia of' Creature Feature."
Sure, there's plenty of rockirf and grindin'
on "Transistor" to go around. The title track
kicks the album off in high gear and is survived
by P-Nut's slap bass in "What Was I Thinking"
and the familiar 311 groove of "Tune In" —
"Now we live again / in LA, Tokyo and New
York / come on pay a fee / smoke your booty
weed / put gas in your tank / keep your city
bumpin."
There are important differences between

"Transistor" and 31 l's early work. The group's
entrancing spiritual tones have never been
stronger, and the cover artwork (which melds a
row of golden spark plugs floating against a soft
cloud-filled sky with a man seated in the lotus
position inside the glass bulb of each plug) re
inforces the aesthetics behind the album. An
other bonus is that the album contains 21
tracks, which is seven more than their previ
ously-longest album, the 1994 release "Grass
roots."
"Transistor" has the feelingofa space shut
tle that never blasts into deep space; rather, it

orbits the earth at 35,000 feet. The sticky
crunch guitar that was abundant on 31 l's
self-titled smash album in 1995 never really
gets going in this one. Instead, 311 chosea dif
ferent path, one that involves programmed
songs and mellower sounds. The group has
the ability to 'blast off at any given point dur
ing the album, but prefers to go into cruise
control.
Still, it's easy to nearly sense a strong whiff
of pot smoke rise from the CD player as you
enjoy the album.
