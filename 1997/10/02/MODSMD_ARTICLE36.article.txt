# Various Artists "The End Of Violence" Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
## Ry Cooder "The End Of Violence" Original Motion Picture Soundtrack 
### 
In the last few years, movie soundtracks
have changed fundamentally. In the 80s, suc
cessful movies featured one or two hit singles,
which were then issued with plenty of filler.
Needless to say, few of these albums ("Foot
loose," "Dirty Dancing," etc.) are currently
doing anything other than collecting dust next
to other relics of the decade, such as the Culture
Club and Duran Duran.
However, recent soundtracks, most notably
"Pulp Fiction," have attempted to make the
jump from marketing souvenir to 'grand, artis
tic statement' of the director. Typically labeled
as "Executive Music Producer," the director
works hard to prove how eclectic and refined
his musical tastes are. Moreover, by including
snippets of dialogue, the director never lets us
forget that the music was collected for the film

alone.
The soundtrack for"The End of Violence,"
the new film from Wim Wenders, is no excep
tion. (ust as he recruited U2, REMand Lou
Reed for the soundtrack to "The End of the
World," Wenders has rounded up notable tal
ent for his latest effort, including U2, Sinead
O'Connor, Michael Stipe, Los l obos, Roy Or
bison, Tom Waits, Ry Cooder and Howie B. In
deed, this album is an exercise in extreme eclec
ticism as country, techno and Latin tracks are
arranged side-by-side.
Remarkably, the music is of such high qual
ity overall that the musical schizophrenia suc
ceeds. O'Connor and U2 give a strong perfor
mance on "I'm Not Your Baby," which is one
more step down U2's journey toward techno.
Still, U2's "radicalism" is upstaged by the real

deal on Medeski Martin & Wood's "Disrobe"
and, more notably, D) Shadow's "Untitled
Heavy Beat (Part 1 & 2)." These should help to
remind the listener that at their heart U2 is just
a rock-and-roll band.
The album's country inclinations are sup
ported by Whiskeytown's beautiful lament
" Theme for a Trucker." l urther, Michael Stipe's
off-key vocals on "Injured Bird" show why he
has always seemed so out of place in the world
of rock; his voice belongs to country.
The soundtrack's most poignant moment is
provided posthumously by the old master him
self, Roy Orbison. 'The track "You May Feel Me
Crying" was produced by Brian Kno, after per
mission was granted by Barbara Orbison. The
musical accompaniment is fairly pedestrian,
but Orbison's voice is as awe-inspiring as ever.

No artist has over matched his combination of
power and vulnerability. Orbison's voice is a
national treasure, and this soundtrack is a wor
thy vehicle lor this gem.
Ry Cooder has also composed a second lull
album of music lor the movie. Unfortunately,
most of his experimental jazz is simply prema
ture landfill. Indeed, his best track, "I Mine Vi
olence," is included on the standard sound
track, makingl 'ooder's album that much more
superfluous.
