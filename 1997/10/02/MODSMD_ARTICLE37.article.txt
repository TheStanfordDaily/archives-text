# Fleetwood Mac The Dance
## 
### 
(Capitalizing on our generation's retro-pop
culture nostalgia, there has been a rash of clas
sic rock comeback attempts ranging from Led
Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page to the
Lagles. With the exception of the Rolling
Stones (don't call it a comeback, they never
left) however, most of these bands are here for
one last moment in the spotlight before fading
into the annals of rock history.
No doubt Fleetwood Mac heads for the
same fate, but the band is determined to go out
in full force. Fleetwood's new live album, "The
Dance," features the same subtle beats and
powerful harmonies that originally boosted
the group to stardom. And Stevie Nicks has not
lost an ounce of gold from her voice.
Fleetwood's sound has remained the same,
but the tastes of radio's general audience have
not. Perhaps the millions of die-hard fans sup
porting the group's new tour will help them
survive, but the time for this version of folk
rock and soft pop is over. Fleetwood Mac is un
likely to bask in the limelight for much longer.
I lie group's signature tlow of harmonized
background vocals carry through the album,
but also create the softer sound that has all but
died in this age of angry young voices belting
out frustration. In that vein, the album is a re
lief from the Alanises and Fiona Apples of the
music industry, who can't seem to sing about
anything without sounding pissed off.
The album is excellent for old fans as well as
new, because the group includes incredible
renditions of its classic hits as well as a few new
songs. Nicks puts in strong performances on
the classics "Fvervwhere," and a slightly modi-

lied (hut excellent)
version of "Rhian
non," while gui
tarist l.indsey
Buckingham pulls
out a hard-hitting
jazzy guitar solo
and powerful
singing on "I'm So
Afraid."
"Silver Springs"
is a beautiful ballad
with floating guitar
and piano [tarts in
termixed with
Nicks' moving
vocal solo. Like the
other songs on the
album, it works
well in concert, not
losing studio quali
ty sound. On one
of the new songs,
"Sweet Girl," Nicks
adds a rough edge
to her otherwise
soothing vocals,
perhaps indicative
of the influence of
current music

trends. Still, the change is not enough to keep
the fledgling song from getting lost in the mix
of great hits.
Powerful singing and playing abound in
most of the songs, hut at times during the
album the group's old age begins to show."(io

Your Own Way has lost sonic ol its forceful
undertones, .is have Buckingham's vocals on
"lusk."
Despite the enormous amounts of praise
and support lor this monumental comeback,
the fact remains that a group cannot survive

forever on its old hits. Unless Meet wood uin
t(Â»|) the Juris 111 with new ni.ilen.il, their
silver springs may well soon run dry.
