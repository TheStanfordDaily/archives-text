## The
						End of Violence 
### 
I ike* Ridley Scott 011 Quaaludcs, director
Wim Wonders ("Far Away So Close," "Until
the Hnd of the World") melts genre to his hid
ding once again with his new meta action
movie, "The hnd of Violence."
"Define violence." Cat (Traci I.ind), a stunt
woman turned actress, opens the film with this
demand. It's the central question that Wenders

deals with throughout the film: Is violence the
end of privacy that FBI surveillance creates in Los
Angeles? Is violence the nature of modern Holly
wood cinema consisting of action movies with
which Mike Max (Bill Pullman) makes his living
as a producer? Is violence the perverse pleasure
found in mental torture that Max derives from
ignoring his wife Paige (Andie MacDowell)?
The movie proposes several definitions of
violence in its story of conspiracy, car-jacking,
murder, filmmaking and love in Los Angeles. A
quintessential LA-type movie, Wenders' film

weaves from Malibu to East Los Angeles, fol
lowing the descent and moral awakening of
film-maker Max. Backed by a soundtrack from
LA-based slide-guitar legend Ky Cooder, the
film reflects on the nature of violence, espe
cially as seen in action movies.
"The End of Violence" is full of beautifully
composed shots and an attention to color on
par with Wenders' well-respected earlier ef
forts like "Wings of Desire" and "Paris, Texas."
Remarkable performances drive the film —
from Samuel Fuller, Gabriel Byrne, and of
course, Pullman, whose acting seems to have
improved exponentially in his latest films like
David Lynch's "Lost Highway."
While the narrative is perhaps a little bit
thin, in light of the film's contemporaries, the

hybrid Graham Greene-noir and Orwellian
paranoia story holds together well. Also, Wen
ders' flair for self-commentary punctuates the
movie in the form of off-beat humor, like in
the character of Zoltan Kovacs (Udo Kier), a
German filmmaker in Hollywood who, when
the filmmaking gets tough, laments: "Why did
I ever leave Europe?"
Wenders consistently delivers intelligent,
beautiful films. For someone of Wenders' in
ternational stature, taking on the Hollywood
movie machine was something of a risk —
clearly a risk that paid off. Striking visuals,
great acting, impeccable filmmaking and great
music remind viewers of the dimensions and
possibilities of good film.
