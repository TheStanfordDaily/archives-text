# Soul Food
## 
### 
"Soul lood," .111 involving and satisfying
ensemble drama, stars Vanessa Williams, Vi
vac a A. I ox and Ni.i I ong as three sisters
who must learn to appreciate and aid each
other with or without their beloved matri
arch, big Mama. The substance and emotion
make it a promising 112 irst film from l.dnioncls
I ntertainment, the new movie company
owned by music producer "Babyface" lid
monds.
"Soul I'ood" is set in a big midwestei n city,
where Mama |oe, or "big Mania" (Irma I'.
I lall), presides over weekly Sunday dinners ol
her "fabulous soul food." Big Mama's daugh
tors and their respective families attend.
Williams plays the eldest daughter Terry,
who is .m accomplished and cold attorney.
I ler husband Miles (Michael beach) is also a
lawyer, but he's unhappy in his marriage and
job. I le wants to be a musician.
Maxine (Iox) and her husband Kenny
(Jeffery 1). Sams) have a stable, happy mar
riage and "two and a half kids." The charming
I ong and gorgeous Meklii I'hifer play "Bird"
and l.em Davis, a pair of madly-in-love new-

Iyweds who must fight family members and
employers who reject hem because he's an ex
con.
Domestic scuffles arise when Mama Joe's
diabetes puts her in the hospital. Everybody

starts sleeping or fighting with everybody else.
The film implies that without Big Mamas
guidance and soul food, the family falls apart.
1 can believe that sharing good food and
spending time with your family strengthens

bonds, hut this movie fails to make the family
conflicts a direct result of Big Mamas absence.
The connection between her illness and the
battles among the children is not direct
enough, so the film's premise isn't entirely
convincing.
The movie is narrated in voice-over by
Ahmad (the engaging Brandon Hammond),
son of Maxine. He's capable of explaining
things because he has a special connection to
Big Mama. This connection is believable only
up to the point where they begin communi
cating by ESP, however, while Mama Joe is un
conscious. Ahmad's exposition is an annoying
element that moves the story along too quick
ly and too often states the obvious. "Soul
Food" features a wonderful cast — just let
them act and show the story.
The film moves between the sisters' story
lines easily and gracefully. All the conflicts de
velop fully and the characters earn sympathy
and affection. Despite the terminally cloying
child-wisdom of the voice-over, "Soul Food"
is well-shot and well-written by creator / di
rector George Tilman. It's a pleasure to watch
and a great example of good-hearted film
making.
