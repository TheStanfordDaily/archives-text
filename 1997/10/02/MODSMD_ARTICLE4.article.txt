# Fac Sen to take on student issues
## Course evaluation, TA reviews to be considered 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Tomorrow's Faculty Senate ses
sion inaugurates a year of continuing
deliberations about several issues
that generated student concerns last
year, including course evaluation and
a review of teaching assistants.
Both of these issues occupied
space on the senate's agenda last year
but have remained unresolved.
One of the issues of particular in
terest to students is disclosure of the
quantitative data from teaching eval
uation forms to the ASSI 1.
At the end of each course, stu
dents fill out forms rating the quality
and performance of professors,
teaching assistants, and the course
overall.
While forms now include a small
tear-off portion that asks students to
give advice to their colleagues, none
of the quantitative data, in which stu
dents rate aspects of the course on a
numerical scale, is available to stu
dents.

A Faculty Senate motion to en
courage the School of Humanities
and Sciences to make the quantita
tive information available for the
course guide was defeated in an un

usually narrow
vote in January,
but the issue has
remained a priori
ty for the ASSU.
"One of the
major goals for the
ASSU Senate is a
course guide," said
ASSU Senate

Chair Joe Freund, a junior. Such a
guide would allow students to com
pare courses and professors when
picking their classes. Without access
to course evaluations, creating a
course guide would he impossible,
Freund said.
"It's ridiculous to expect students
to fill out course evaluations honestly
... and then not make that informa
tion available," said Senate Deputy
('hair Matt Spence, a sophomore.
