# Fac Sen to take on student issues
## Course evaluation, TA reviews to be considered 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Tomorrow's Faculty Senate ses
sion inaugurates a year of continuing
deliberations about several issues
that generated student concerns last
year, including course evaluation and
a review of teaching assistants.
Both of these issues occupied
space on the senate's agenda last year
but have remained unresolved.
One of the issues of particular in
terest to students is disclosure of the
quantitative data from teaching eval
uation forms to the ASSI 1.
At the end of each course, stu
dents fill out forms rating the quality
and performance of professors,
teaching assistants, and the course
overall.
While forms now include a small
tear-off portion that asks students to
give advice to their colleagues, none
of the quantitative data, in which stu
dents rate aspects of the course on a
numerical scale, is available to stu
dents.

A Faculty Senate motion to en
courage the School of Humanities
and Sciences to make the quantita
tive information available for the
course guide was defeated in an un

usually narrow
vote in January,
but the issue has
remained a priori
ty for the ASSU.
"One of the
major goals for the
ASSU Senate is a
course guide," said
ASSU Senate

Chair Joe Freund, a junior. Such a
guide would allow students to com
pare courses and professors when
picking their classes. Without access
to course evaluations, creating a
course guide would he impossible,
Freund said.
"It's ridiculous to expect students
to fill out course evaluations honestly
... and then not make that informa
tion available," said Senate Deputy
('hair Matt Spence, a sophomore.


Natelson
Some members of the Faculty
Senate last year were reluctant to re
lease course evaluation information.
Such quantitative data, made readily
available through the World Wide
Web to the student body, would be
available to appointments commit
tees at other universities or for
defamatory purposes.
Freund disagreed. "If the profes
sor is not teaching well," he said,
"professors should not be shielded
from the quality of their teaching." A
course guide that makes such infor
mation public might give professors
an incentive to concentrate on teach
ing, Freund added.
"We walk a fine line between con
fidentiality and disclosure," said
Assoc. Religious Studies Prof. Hes
ter Gelber, chair of the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement. "It's a very
complicated issue."
Another issue open for consider
ation is the effectiveness and supervi

sion of teaching assistants. Physics
doctoral student Doug Natelson. an
ASSU senator and representative at
large to the Faculty Senate last year,
discovered that the University had
not evaluated teaching assistants for
nine years though internal legislation
mandated such a review every four
years.
ITie C-AAA Subcommittee for
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching has, for over an year, been
preparing a report on supervision of
teaching assistants. Its findings will
be discussed by the Faculty Senate
later this quarter.
"Different departments do differ
ent things, and there is a question of
whether each department does
things the best way," Natelson said.
For example, the Center for Feach
mg and Learning has a lot of re
sources for teaching assistants, but
relatively few departments use them,
Natelson added.
Psychology Prof. Russell Fernald,
chair of the subcommittee, said that
the Faculty Senate will receive a re
port on the issue but will not act until
later this fall.
