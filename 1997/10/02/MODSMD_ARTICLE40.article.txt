# The
						Ice Storm

### 
\ tar cry from I9 l )s's ebullient "Sense and
Sensibility," Aug I ee's current film, "The Ice
Storm," is a restless drama comedy that is by
turns humorous, tragic and often slightly dis
turbing. Adapted from Rick Moodv's novel of
the same name, the Him feels like a book anil is
refreshing!) lacking in Hollywood Jiches and
pat endings.
Powered by strong acting b\ loan Mien,
Ke\ in Kline, Sigournev Weaver and |ame\
Sheridan (the scary red-eyed devil man from
'The Stand"), "The Ice Storm' takes a wintrv
look at two troubled ( onnecticut families
plagued bv adultery, adolescent angst and Wa
tergate.
Set in 1 5)73, "The Ice Storm" centers on the
effects of the sexual revolution on the Hood
family, (iarbed in bell bottoms and humun
gous collars, Paul Hood (Kline) attempts to

conduct business as usual in his failing mar
riage to Plena (Allen) while conducting an af
fair with neighbor laneyCarver (Weaver). His
14-vear old daughter, played by a sullen
( hristina Kicci, is following in her father's foot
steps ("1 learned it from watching you!") by
disrobing with not one but two other tortured
youths: the (larver sons.
Needless to say, watching Wednesday Ad
dams get naked with Little Man Tate is a bit
alarming. But even more shocking is the por
trayal of the adult sexual interactions as being as
awkward and painful as the children's. The
Iloods and the Carvers attend a "key party" at
w Inch the attendees swap spouses, a scene which
is both funny and tragic for Plena and Paul.
I'he crucial party and subsequent after
shocks take place during a vicious ice storm, a
not so subtle metaphor for the icv distance be
tween Paul and Plena, as well as their children.
I ee is skilled at evoking affecting performances
from his actors, and he does so here. Allen's

work as Elena is especially noteworthy.
The movie's difficulty comes in trying to do
too much. Between the two marriages and the
four children there are too many storylines to
delve deeply into all of them. The film's ending
is abrupt, and leaves many issues unresolved.
While this does leave the viewer the chance to
use her imagination and come to her own con
clusions, it is nonetheless vaguely dissatisfying.
There are flashes of comic brilliance which
are laugh-out-loud funny. Weavers mono
logue on coming ofage rituals in other cultures
is a stand-out, as is a scene where Kline comes
upon his daughter making out with Elijah
Wood while wearing a Nixon mask. However,
the film swings from comedy to tragedy in a
disjointed and abrupt manner.
"The Ice Storm" defies pigeon-holing,
which is a wonderful quality in a movie. This
quality is also, however, what makes the film
difficult to watch and enjov.
