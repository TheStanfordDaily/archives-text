# Gravesend
## 
### 
Have you ever had one of those
nights where a bad situation just
keeps getting worse? Well, it couldn't
have been nearly as bad as the night
that four street kids from a tough
Brooklyn neighborhood experience
in "Gravesend."
Zane (Tony Tucci), Ray (Michael
Parducci), Chicken (Tom Mallov) and
Mikey (Thomas Brandise) are enjoy
ing their Saturday night doing nothing
in particular in Ray's basement. A sim
ple argument becomes disastrous
when Zane fires a supposedly un
loaded gun and kills Ray's brother.
Desperate to avoid the authorities,
Zane convinces Ray to allow the local
dope dealer, JoJo the Junkie (Macky
Aquilino), to get rid of the corpse. JoJo
demands compensation ("$500 and a
thumb") up front, so the fearful four
some scramble for the rest of the night
io come up with the cash.
As the night progresses, we are
treated to vicious and fruitless fights,
close encounters with cops, an at
tempted robbery and more bodies.
Eventually the guys stop trusting each
other, and some serious mind games
begin.
Off the screen, the media attention
surrounding "Gravesend" has focused
less on the movie itself than on the di
rector, Salvatore Stabile. In the foot
steps of filmmakers like Richard Lin
klater ("Slacker"), Kevin Smith
("Clerks") and Robert Rodriguez ("El

Mariachi"), Stabile stretched his tal
ents and resources to the limit while
creating his first film.
Stabile (now 22) began shooting
"Gravesend" when he was 19 years old
and a dropout from New York Univer
sity. His budget was a $5000 inheri
tance from his grandmother, his cam
era crew consisted ol three people who
illegally tapped into power lines for
lighting, and his cast worked for free.
Stabile submitted his movie to the
Hamptons Film Festival in New York,
where some big names agreed to invest
$60,000 in post-production. Soon
after, Oliver Stone offered to take pre
sentation credits for the film. Now Sta
bile has signed a two-picture deal with
Steven Spielberg and I )ream Works
SKG.
With its background in mind, one
can truly appreciate Stabile's sacrifices
for "Gravesend." The 16 mm film,
st retched to 35 mm for widespread dis
tribution, looks grainy but adds real
power during intense scenes like flash
back sequences.
The film also generates four aston
ishingly good characters, from the
near-psychopathic Zane to the Iright
ened but secretly murderous Mikey.
These guys make us question our abil
ity to handle outrageous situations,
and like many good movies,
"Gravesend" makes us feel better
about our own lives.
