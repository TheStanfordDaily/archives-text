# Kicked in the Head
## 
### 
After seeing the new film "Kicked in the
Head," you may wonder if the producers
themselves had been kicked in their heads

when they agreed to fund it.
The problem with the movie is its utter and
total lack of plot. The cinematography and the
editing suck as well, but it's the story that steals
the show by ruining the film entirely.
"Kicked in the Head" revolves around
Redmond (Kevin Corrigan), a twenty
something New Yorker who is utterly bored
with life. And he should he. He's going
nowhere, he has no family, no real friends
and no goals. Scratch that: He does have one
goal. After reading a fortune cookie that tells
him to look for his guardian angel, lu- goes
for it.
So he decides that the stewardess Megan
(Linda I'iorentino), who only calls him by
the oh-so-affectionate name "asshole," is
suddenly the woman who is going to change
his life. That's the closest I can come to find
ing some sense of conflict or plot in this
movie.
The rest of the time we watch as Redmond
lies to his Uncle Sam (played by James
Woods, to which I ask, "Why?"), swindles his
way in and out of Mafia deals and dodges
bullets that never seem to kill anyone. Some
times he is visited by a girl named Happy (Lili

Taylor). The movie could go on just line
without her, and you never figure out why
she was in it. My guesses are tli.it either she
owes the director a favor, or someone always
thought it would be fun to make a movie
with a character named I lappy.
The movie gets two dim stars because it
does have an interesting cast of characters:
the girl who steals dildos from the S&M sup
ply store, the raving drunk who claims the
world suffers from "diabolic pussy fever" in
an entertaining though vulgar monologue,
and the random dog that shows up in about
eight scenes.
lint these characters inevitably are like
everyone and everything in the movie: hope
less. Hveryone loves someone they t an never
have. The characters' motives are never c lear,
and the plot moves forward so hopelessly
th.it you have no idea once you've reached the
end.
I saw this movie with my friend and her
comment as we exited the theater was "That
was a long movie." She meant it, too. She
didn't realize that it had only been an hour
and a half.
