## HOW TO LEAD THE NATION AND MAKE A BOMB TOO 
### Randy Mano Contributing writer 
In lieu of watching last weekend's
record-breaking win against Oregon,
some of you might have gone to the
movies to see Michael Douglas panic
throughout "The Game." Or, a few of
you could have watched the comical
"In and Out" to determine Kevin
Kline's sexual orientation. But these
two fine actors, Douglas and Kline,
have more similarities than having the
top two films during the final weekend
of summer.
Each fit well into the role of Presi
dent. Four years ago, Kevin Kline
sparkled in "Dave," a comedy-satire

about an average citizen assuming the posi
tion of chief executive. The tide refers to Dave
Kovic (Kline), who is called upon by the White

House to replace the ailing President Bill
Mitchell (Kline, in a double role). Somehow,
Dave manages to woo the distant first lady
(Sigourney Weaver), trim over $650 million
from the budget and handle the antagonistic
chief of staff, Bob Alexander (Frank Langella).
One particularly classic scene is the visit to
the construction company. While donning a
hard-hat, Dave spreads two mechanical arms
as wide as possible and comments, "I once
caught a fish... this big." Another laugh-out
sequence takes place in the bathroom when
the first lady demands that Dave open the
shower door. just say that she begins to
suspect something is fishy after this moment.
Likewise, Michael Douglas mastered the
head-honcho persona in his winning comedy
"The American President" (1995). As a Demo
cratic President Andrew Shepard, he has the
dual challenge of keeping up with his teenage
daughter Lucy (Shawna Waldron) and fending

off republican candidate
Rumson (Richard Drey
fuss). Lobbyist Sydney

Allen Wade (Annette
Benning) slowly falls for the gentlemanly
Shepard, which complicates matters.
This, too, is a favorable look upon the pres
idency, which, in movies, is an indirect way of
commenting on our nation's leader. "Dave"
reveals the need to simplify the country's de
mands and to concentrate the president's at
tention on issues like homelessness and the
national debt. In contrast, 1 appreciated "The
American President" most when the president
is revealing his personal life — we see him
dance, buy flowers, talk on the phone and at
tempt to court the elusive Sydney.
Yet Douglas and Kline have not avoided the
occasional movie bomb; the following two
historical films happen to fill that category.
Douglas didn't bring much to last year's
"The Ghost and the Darkness," a sluggish ac
tion picture set in colonial Africa. His charac
ter, a wild-looking American hunter named
Remington, enters during the second half of

the movie to assist Irish engineer John Patter
son (Val Kilmer) with hunting man-eating
lions. But the movie proved too predictable for
my taste, despite some nifty academy award
winning roars from the mysterious lions.
Kline's foray into historical drama,
"Princess Caraboo" (1994), brings us to 1817
Great Britain, when a foreign woman going by
the name of Caraboo (Phoebe Gates) tries to
enter British royalty. As the Greek butler
Frixos, Kline tries to figure out her homeland
and her lineage. Despite the political intrigue
and mystery surrounding her arrival,
"Princess Caraboo" lacks any suspense in the
search for her identity.
Despite a few career mistakes, the two ac
tors, still in their prime (late 40s), should con
tinue to churn out quality mainstream films.
Each has already been honored by the Acade
my, with Kline earning best supporting actor
for "A Fish Called Wanda" (1988) and Dou
glas receiving best actor for "Wall Street"
(1987). And, with the two of them tearing up
the box office, things should only get brighter
for these two men.
