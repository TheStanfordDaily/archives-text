# Audits scrutinized in Bookstore trial
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
An investigator with the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office yesterday tried to discredit
audits performed on the Stanford
Bookstore as the nearly three-year
old trial of three former Bookstore
managers continued.
Sandee Torgrimson listed mis
takes and omissions from the audits
that she had found in her investiga
tion of Bookstore finances. The tes
timony by Torgrimson, who investi
gates financially related crimes for
the District Attorney's Office,
wrapped up preliminary hearings in
the trial.
Former Bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed, former Asst.
General Manager Philip Chiara
monte and former Controller
Patrick McDonald were charged in
March 1995 with several counts of

tax evasion and grand theft. The
District Attorney's ()ffice launched
its investigation in response to a
19 C >2 Daily article that revealed
Bookstore managers were receiving
perquisites unheard of at other uni
versity bookstores.
During the course of preliminary
hearings, members of the Book
store's Board of Directors and oth
ers connected to the nonprofit cor
poration have testified regarding
the board's knowledge of money the
managers spent on perks.
Torgrimson was called to refute
evidence contained in several audits
performed on the Bookstore's fi
nances in 1992. In her own investiga
tion, which she said included sorting
through checks and vouchers and in
terviewing Bookstore board mem
hers, Torgrimson found a number of
suspicious exchanges that had been
omitted from the audits, she testified.
In response to the Daily article,
the Bookstore board formed an
audit committee, which included
Psychology Prof. Emeritus Albert
Hastorf.
That committee hired two law
firms, Silk, Adler and Colvin of San
Francisco and Juttle and Taylor of
Los Angeles to provide legal advice.
ITie law firms then hired two ac
counting firms — Deloitte and
Touche and Neilson, Elggren and
Durkin Co. — to complete the
audit.
Asst. District Attorney Linda
Condron, who is prosecuting the
case on behalf of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asked Torgrimson about several
specific items — including a $25,(KX)
check for a down payment on a va
cation home for Bookstore employ
ees in Twain Harte, Calif. — that
Torgrimson said were omitted from
the audits.

While the audit by Neilson,
Elggren and Durkin reflected that
authorization for a loan to Speed to
build a personal home in Fremont
was given after funds had already
been distributed, "the audit did not
reflect that Mr. Chiaramonte or Mr.
Speed told the board that the funds
had already been distributed," Tor
grimson said.
Torgrimson also challenged the
objectivity of a second audit after
discovering a fax from an attorney
for Tuttle and Taylor to an accoun
tant with Neilson, Elggren and
Durkin.
Sent April 6, 1992, the fax con
tained a single paragraph, which
was inserted without alteration into
the audit, Torgrimson said. The
paragraph mentioned the media
coverage of possible fraud and said,
"We found no such evidence."
That the accountants in charge of
the second audit would use wording
provided by those working on the
first audit was questionable, Tor
grimson said.
