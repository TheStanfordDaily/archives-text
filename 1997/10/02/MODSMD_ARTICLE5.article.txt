# Audits scrutinized in Bookstore trial
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
An investigator with the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office yesterday tried to discredit
audits performed on the Stanford
Bookstore as the nearly three-year
old trial of three former Bookstore
managers continued.
Sandee Torgrimson listed mis
takes and omissions from the audits
that she had found in her investiga
tion of Bookstore finances. The tes
timony by Torgrimson, who investi
gates financially related crimes for
the District Attorney's Office,
wrapped up preliminary hearings in
the trial.
Former Bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed, former Asst.
General Manager Philip Chiara
monte and former Controller
Patrick McDonald were charged in
March 1995 with several counts of

tax evasion and grand theft. The
District Attorney's ()ffice launched
its investigation in response to a
19 C >2 Daily article that revealed
Bookstore managers were receiving
perquisites unheard of at other uni
versity bookstores.
During the course of preliminary
hearings, members of the Book
store's Board of Directors and oth
ers connected to the nonprofit cor
poration have testified regarding
the board's knowledge of money the
managers spent on perks.
Torgrimson was called to refute
evidence contained in several audits
performed on the Bookstore's fi
nances in 1992. In her own investiga
tion, which she said included sorting
through checks and vouchers and in
terviewing Bookstore board mem
hers, Torgrimson found a number of
suspicious exchanges that had been
omitted from the audits, she testified.
