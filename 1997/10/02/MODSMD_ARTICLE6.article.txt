# Alternative dorm rooms give students some space to breathe
## 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
Remember when you left for college and
your parents converted your bedroom into a
study? For some students, the scenario was
reversed: arriving on campus, they found
that their dormitories' study rooms had
been converted into rooms for them.
An unexpectedly large number of incorn
ing freshman caused a housing crunch this
year. Several dormitories had to modify
their study rooms to provide living space for
students who might otherwise be homeless.
However, what could have been a less than
satisfactory living arrangement actually
turned out to be a privilege for juniors Scott
Larson and Christina Greene and senior
Kim Myers.
The study rooms "are a lot bigger. Every
one's jealous," (ireene said. She shares her
room, a converted study room in Lantnna,
with one roommate. "Also, the furniture's
all new, so it's pretty nice."
As a transfer student, Greene said, she
was randomly assigned to a dormitory. "I
didn't know where I was going to be, but
when I saw the room I was pretty excited by
it because there's so much space."

According to Cirecnc, (he arrangement
has been completely beneficial. The room,
besides being larger than the other l.antana
doubles, also has much more lighting. I hree
rows of fluorescent lights and a wall of win
dows brighten lip the place.
However, the windows also constitute
the only drawback to the room, (ireene said.
"It would be easy for someone to climb on
the balcony outside and then climb in
through the windows, so we have to keep
our windows closed when we're not here."
Hut, (ireene added, "sometimes it's nice
to climb out onto the balcony ourselves."
Larson also expressed contentment with
his room, a single in Loro. In the past, he ex
plained, head advising associates and resi
dential computer co ordinators in Florence
Moore I fall had never gotten singles. I h<> e
were given to the KAs.
"This year, because they converted the
study rooms, the opportunity for singles was
open," said Larson, head AA lor I oro and
Mirlo.
"I wanted a single over a double. I pur
sued it. I was gung-ho about it," I .arson said.
"Living here was an opportunity rather than
something I'd complain about."

Junior Jason Larson puts his feet up on the stairs that lead up to the window of the converted study room in Loro that
he now calls home.
Like Greene's double, Larson's
single is also larger than the aver
age single. "I'm happy with it. It's
all advantages for me," Larson
said. "The windows are small, but
they're big enough."
Unlike the Lantana study
rooms, the ones in Florence Moore
have smaller windows higher up
from the floor. To comply with
safety regulations, steps were built
up to the windows in the converted
Florence Moore study rooms.

The window that faced the hall
way was papered over but no other
changes were made to Greene's
room, other than to the furniture.
Both Larson and Greene said
that they do not feel as though the
rooms they occupy had ever been
anything other than dorm rooms.
However, some signs of the former
study rooms remain, such as the
different door knobs.
"People who used to live here
sometimes walk by and say, 'Oh
there's the study room,"' Greene
said. "But I don't think ofit that way."
Larson agreed. "I keep on walk
ing past my room, but I imagine I'll

get used to it."
Myers, a Yost resident, agreed
that her room can easily be missed.
Located a short distance from Yost
and surrounded by greenery,
Myers' room is actually in the guest
house, where she lives with three
other women.
"Originally our draw group was
split, so we petitioned to be placed
in Yost, or at least on this side of
campus," Myers said. "Over the
summer we were told we all got
into Yost, but we didn't know we
were in a guest house until we got
here. I think for the most part we
really like it."

Two rooms, a kitchen, a bath
room, and a walk-in closet make up
the guest house. According to
Myers, they chose to have all the
beds in one room and everything
else in the other, to form a living
room. The kitchen is equipped with
a large refrigerator and a dishwash
er.
"All the furniture is brand-new,
and the ceilings are high so it makes
the place look really big," Myers
said. "We're separated from the
house, so it makes us feel a little dis
tant, but we still eat there, so it's not
a big deal if we make a little effort. I
think we got a really good deal."
