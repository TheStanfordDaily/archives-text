# Alternative dorm rooms give students some space to breathe
## 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
Remember when you left for college and
your parents converted your bedroom into a
study? For some students, the scenario was
reversed: arriving on campus, they found
that their dormitories' study rooms had
been converted into rooms for them.
An unexpectedly large number of incorn
ing freshman caused a housing crunch this
year. Several dormitories had to modify
their study rooms to provide living space for
students who might otherwise be homeless.
However, what could have been a less than
satisfactory living arrangement actually
turned out to be a privilege for juniors Scott
Larson and Christina Greene and senior
Kim Myers.
The study rooms "are a lot bigger. Every
one's jealous," (ireene said. She shares her
room, a converted study room in Lantnna,
with one roommate. "Also, the furniture's
all new, so it's pretty nice."
As a transfer student, Greene said, she
was randomly assigned to a dormitory. "I
didn't know where I was going to be, but
when I saw the room I was pretty excited by
it because there's so much space."

According to Cirecnc, (he arrangement
has been completely beneficial. The room,
besides being larger than the other l.antana
doubles, also has much more lighting. I hree
rows of fluorescent lights and a wall of win
dows brighten lip the place.
However, the windows also constitute
the only drawback to the room, (ireene said.
"It would be easy for someone to climb on
the balcony outside and then climb in
through the windows, so we have to keep
our windows closed when we're not here."
Hut, (ireene added, "sometimes it's nice
to climb out onto the balcony ourselves."
Larson also expressed contentment with
his room, a single in Loro. In the past, he ex
plained, head advising associates and resi
dential computer co ordinators in Florence
Moore I fall had never gotten singles. I h<> e
were given to the KAs.
"This year, because they converted the
study rooms, the opportunity for singles was
open," said Larson, head AA lor I oro and
Mirlo.
"I wanted a single over a double. I pur
sued it. I was gung-ho about it," I .arson said.
"Living here was an opportunity rather than
something I'd complain about."

he now calls home.
