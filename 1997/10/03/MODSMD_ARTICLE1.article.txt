'Hie Faculty Senate convened yesterday for the
first time this year and quickly got down to business,
including hearing reports from the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement and Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller.
Much of the meeting's discussion surrounded un
dergraduate academic issues such as the benefits and
drawbacks of preregistration for classes and whether
the " A+" letter grade constitutes grade inflation.
Many members of the senate favored preregistra
tion as long as it did not infringe upon the benefits as
sociated with the two-week "shopping" period.
"The shopping period is good for students," said
Ram6n Saldivar, vice provost for undergraduate ed
ucation. "But preregistration would help avoid prob
lems with the Bookstore and accommodating stu
dents in classrooms."
The shopping period has traditionally been a peri
od in which students can attend various lectures be
fore having to finalize their schedules. Some faculty
members, however, have found faults with such a sys
tem, citing overcrowded classrooms, disjointed lec
tures and a general disorganization that saturates the
period.
"Preregistration could solve some of these prob
lems," said Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven.
The senate will consider this issue later this acade
mic year.
Faculty members also discussed the issue of the
"A+" grade, and whether it leads to grade inflation.
"1 thought a 4.0 was a flawless GPA," said Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall. "Some professors may never
give an A+."
Other faculty members, howev
er, stated that some students who
did exceedingly well deserved to be
distinguished and that the grade
also had to be kept in order to nor
malize current students' grades with
grades from past years.
"[The grade] has been used for so
long, that to tinker with it would
throw everything off," said Univer
sity Registrar Roger Printup.
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley, the senate's chair, said that
the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement should
look into the issue.
Most of the meeting, however,
was devoted to the status of the Uni
versity libraries, especially the
progress of the reconstruction of
Green Library West.

Keller announced that Green
West is tentatively scheduled to
open in fall of 1999, as was planned.
He also outlined important tasks
that the libraries have been dealing
with, such as placing more journals
and catalogues online and attempt
ing to build-up their collections.
"We have a relatively young col
lection," said Keller. "It was a post-
World War II decision to become a
major research university."
University President Gerhard-
Casper also answered some of the
faculty members' concerns with the
lawsuits and union threats that have
surrounded the merging of the UC-
San Francisco Medical School and
the Stanford Medical Center.
"Being a lawyer and having a
knowledge of the courts, who knows
what can happen," said Casper.
"There's always a risk element here
that cannot be ruled out, but we are
still very confident."
