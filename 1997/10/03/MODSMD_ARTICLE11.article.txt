Teen crime down
WASHINGTON (AP)
Arrests of teen-agers for violent
crimes plunged 9.2 percent last
year, and Attorney General Janet
Reno said the second straight
annual drop was not "a blip" but a
real tre. J away from the juvenile
crime wave that rose steadily from
1987 through 1994.
At her weekly news conference
yesterday, Reno called on
Congress to allocate more money
for after-school programs "to
make it stick." The Republicans
who control Congress are writing
bills that focus on trying more
teen-agers as adults.
The drop during 1995 was 2.9
percent, and Reno said she had
"worried since that it might be a
blip. But now... we are making
real progress."

The FBI data also showed that
arrests of teen-agers for murder
dropped 10.7 percent in 19%, the
third straight annual decline after
a 169 percent increase between
1984 and 1993, when the juvenile
murder rate peaked.
But Reno was not ready to
declare victory. More than any
attorney general since Robert F.
Kennedy, Reno has roamed the
nation speaking on youth crime
and calling for a balance between
tougher penalties for wrongdoers
and prevention programs to keep
kids out of trouble and help young
offenders return to society.
"We still continue to hear of
too many serious violent crimes
committed by young people,"
Reno said. "We cannot be satisfied
by this reduction in youth vio
lence."
In 1996 for every 100,000

youths aged 10 to 17, there were
464.7 arrests for violent crimes,
down from 511.9 in 1995 and 527.4
in the peak year of FBI fig
ures showed.
This rate had spiraled up from
311.3 arrests in 1987 as drug gangs
throughout the country recruited
teen-agers as drug couriers and
armed them.
Professor Alfred Blumstein of
Carnegie Mellon University
attributed a major share of the
decline in teen-age killing to police
efforts to take guns from kids.
"It's not any one policy," said
professor Jack Levin, Northeast
ern University in Boston. "We're
putting violent kids in prison,
putting at-risk kids in programs,
finding after-school and summer
jobs, forming partnerships
between the police and communi
ty, taking guns off the street."
