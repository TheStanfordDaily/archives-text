# Two-year old starves to death
## Parents charged for murder, refrigerator found empty 
### 
PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) — The parents of a 2-year
old boy who weighed just 10 pounds when he died of
malnutrition told police they had no money lor food,
but a prosecutor says they had enough to pay life insur
ance premiums on their starving children.
The two younger children of Susan and Billy Gene
Mitchell subsisted on nothing but water for seven days,
police said. Their 6-year-old daughter got her only
meals at school.
The Mitchell's apartment had nice furniture, two
television sets, a video cassette recorder, a stereo and a
computer, police said. The kitchen, however, held noth
ing but a bottle of cooking oil and a spice rack.
"It looked like the typical house until you opened
the refrigerator and cupboards," said Detective Bruce
Watson. "We found a jar of water and two trays of ice
cubes."
Mitchell, 45, and Mrs. Mitchell, 37, were arraigned
Wednesday on murder charges. They are also charged
with two counts of endangerment involving their two
girls, ages 3 and 6. They pleaded innocent and bail was
set at $1.05 million each.

When 2-year-old Jeffrey died Tuesday he weighed
just 3 pounds more than his birth weight.
Prosecutor Tim Kaltenbach said the boy's death was
"the worst I've ever seen personally.... It was like
what you see in a ITiird World country."
The two girls — weighing 28 and 16.S pounds
have been hospitalized for malnutrition. They were list
ed in fair condition yesterday at Kosair ( hildren's Hos
pital in Louisville.
When found, the emaciated Melanie, 3, was too
weak to hold her head up. Billie, who ate breakfast and
luneh at school, was in better condition, police said.
It appears the entire family went without food for
days at a time. Watson said Mitchell, who has lost near
ly SO pounds in recent months, told him the family
would eat crackers, peanut butter and jelly when he
could afford it.
Mitchell, who retired from the Air Force in 1994,
claimed his monthly retirement check is being gar
nisheed for debts. Yet he appeared to be current on
bills including premiums for $6(),(XX) life insurance poli
cies for each child, Kaltenbach said.
