## Editorial Three cheers for yell squad 
### 
Last Saturday's football game against
Oregon was an energy-charged expe
rience. But it was not merely Stan
ford's high score of 58 that made it so —
from down on the field, the new yell squad
spent the entire game chanting and scream
ing, igniting audience enthusiasm.
The Athletics Department's creation of
the yell squad was a positive move. The yell
squad replaced Stanford cheer, which,
because of its similarity to the dollies, was
somewhat superfluous. We see this replace
ment as an excellent way to shift more atten
tion and focus to the energy of the crowd.
The squad, currently consisting of five
undergraduates and led by former Tree and
senior ..C hris Bonzon, has a laid back, stu
dent-oriented attitude. Its energy is similar to
the Band's: rambunctious and funky.
However, it is important that this energy
remain directed at the crowd. A valid criti
cism of the cheerleaders was that they were
not interactive enough with the crowd, and
at last weekend's game the yell leaders peri
odically appeared more interested in their
own presence in the limelight than in rallying

Stanford fans.
The cheers shouted at last weekend's
game varied from innovative cheers such as
"Punish them, punish them, for crimes they
did not commit" and "Repeated physical
blows is all they'll understand," to the simple
but effective "Yeah, yeah, hell, yeah."
Another positive addition that the yell
squad has made is the revival of some tradi
tional Stanford cheers including "That's all
right, that's 0.K., you'll all work for as some
day."
Although some have accused the squad
of yelling too many violent cheers, we feel
that they mean no harm. The squad is just a
combination of some outrageous undergrad
uates attempting to match the attitude of the
Stanford fan in the stands — a fan who is at
the game not only to watch Stanford win, but
out to have a rowdy, gtxxl time.
We expect that yell squad will be an effec
tive tool to capitalize on Stanford energy and
get students psyched up for games this sea
son, and we're looking forward to the
squad's leadership at tomorrow's Notre
Dame game.
