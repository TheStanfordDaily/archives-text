## Academics, athletics and the price of apathy

Surely the evidence of
a golden mean
between work and
play could not be made
plainer: On the one hand,
classes at Stanford are
hard, but on the other
hand, as if to compensate,
the weather is so pleasant.

If you're reading this article in the after
noon, lean your head out the window.
You'll probably hear the faint, hollow ring
of a basketball bouncing on asphalt; if it's
late at night, go out into your hall, and you'll
probably count more doors shut than open.
It's the second week of school and already
students are feeling the crunch.
There is, however, a danger to this bipo
lar approach to life — the temptation to let
the outside world pass by.
Usually justified in terms of a 20-unit
workload that leaves time for little besides
an occasional trip to Arrillaga Family
Sports Center, this lifestyle often manages
to crowd out any time to consider the fate of
the people and places beyond the Campus
Drive loop.
Escapism is the official University pas
time; is it any wonder that the news that
Stanford was named one of the most activist
campuses in the nation was greeted with a
collective shrug of disbelief?
From the moment you arrive at Stan
ford, you are asked to make a series of
choices — even deciding to come here
involved a choice. First you pick a major,
then a concentration within your major, and
then, often, an even more specific field in

which to do research.
This is what college is for: traveling to
the heart of an idea you care about deeply.
At the same time, one of the general princi
ples of student life seems to be that no one
wants to be exclusively an academic drudge.
An occasional break from studying is neces
sary.
Yet in its own way sports, the primary
way of fulfilling this need at Stanford, is just
as removed from our world of everyday
mundane relationships as the most abstract
philosophy.
Most of our daily interaction occurs on
both the physical and mental levels, yet it is
here that Stanford students seem to draw
the line at investing themselves — a with
drawal that manifests itself in the form of
apathy towards extra-curricular involve
ment.
The answer to why apathy is so prevalent
is simple: We've all forgotten why we were
originally admitted here — to be well
rounded. Not only are we expected to excel
academically; we're also called on to con
tribute to the lives of others, in our commu
nity and beyond.
Remember back in high school when
you were taking all those AP courses and
editing the school magazine and volunteer
ing a few hours a week and acting in the
school musical? It was exhausting, perhaps,
but fulfilling as well, thanks to both the con
tinuous sense of achievement, of obstacles
confronted and surmounted and of pride in
community involvement.
Being part of a community at Stanford
isn't just about scavenger hunts and dorm

cheers; it also means a continual willingness
to learn and react to the world around you.
And the lessons you learn will carry
beyond the present day. If we do not remain
engaged with the world around us while
we're still students, we won't be nearly as
successful in applying our knowledge to the
problems we will face when we finally
emerge from the ivory tower.
My prescription, then, is to stop burying
your head in the books. Join an organiza
tion whose mission you agree with, or, if
you can't find any, start one of your own.
In Palo Alto alone, there is a daily paper
and a weekly. In addition to those,
metropolitan newspapers and magazines
are available at Stanford libraries. Do some
walking around the fringes of campus; fig
ure out a better way to connect Sand Hill to
El Camino, or from where exactly those
tiger salamanders are emerging.
These examples are provided in order to
get you started; in no time at all you'll be
able to work your way through problems
like BART dissatisfaction and Tahoe devel
opment and eventually to the Federal bud
get deficit.
And even if you're not interested in
spending your Stanford career as a
protester, the next time you see a group of
irate students passing out flyers in White
Plaza, take one and read it — you might
actually learn something. Soon enough it
will be time to leave Stanford behind.
Be prepared for what lies ahead.
