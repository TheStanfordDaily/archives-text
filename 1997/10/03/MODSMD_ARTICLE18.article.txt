Support for Res Ed
Sommer Gentry's Oct. 1 letter to The
Daily raises concerns that many students
may harbor regarding Residential Educa
tion. However, as a member of Res
Ed, 1 feel obligated to defend an organiza
tion that she does not take the time to
understand.
I applied to be a resident assistant
because I care about our students. It is
hard for me to conceive of five separate
RAs who were "uniformly pushy and
bossy to their residents but fakely upbeat
about Stanford and dorm programs."
The residents in our dormitory cannot
be "bossed" by the house staff. We are
upbeat about Stanford because we enjoy
being here. We are upbeat about dorm
programs because we plan them.
Each RA, too, is different from the oth
ers in the system. Yes, there are similari
ties in our personalities, just as their are
similarities in personalities of mathemati
cal and computational science majors, of
which Gentry is one, but there is not one
mold fashioning the students who are cho
sen as Res Ed staff.
Gentry also addresses the subject of
grades being revealed to resident fellows.
This is a topic easily broached with RFs
(who are the only ones to see them); for
example, the RFs with whom I work have
a nice fire in their cottage after making
sure that no one is in danger of failing out

of school.
Gentry singles out "Crossing the Line"
as an intrusive program that "allows Res
Ed to find out exactly what students think
and feel and what they are doing in their
private lives."
This, again, is a sad misunderstanding
of the goal of this voluntary program.
"Crossing the Line" is a chance for resi
dents to reveal something about their lives
to other students in the dorm in a quiet,
confidential setting prior to a discussion in
which those ideas and feelings are dis
cussed among participants.
The mediator of the program is not a
part of Res Ed staff and does not record
names, faces or actions during the pro
gram.
Res Ed does want students to learn to
live harmoniously together, in that one
sense Gentry is correct; the entire goal of
Res Ed is for students to see learning
opportunities outside of the classroom, in
the diverse and amazing lives of their next
door neighbors and hallmates.
It is a shame that Gentry has not felt
this to be true. I am hopeful that she will
find the time and energy to get to know
the RAs in Kimball this year (who are an
amazing bunch of people) and to gain an
understanding of the diversity and pur
pose of Res. Ed.

Fraternity experience quite
valuable
I've already heard the murmurs of the
"intellectual elite" around campus. The
debate over the future of fraternities has
been renewed, and as always, it comes in
the face of a tragedy, this time at Fiji at
MIT.
Unfortunately, many who take their
shots at fraternities have little basis for the
broad assertions they make.
All I can do is offer what I've experi
enced. firsthand, as a member of an MIT
fraternity...
ITie first thing one has to accept is that
not all fraternities are alike. Even different
chapters of the same fraternity have vast
differences. Yet, somehow it has become
accepted, even at a place like Stanford, to
stereotype fraternities; even many of those
who fight to break the stereotyping of other
groups denounce all fraternities.
This is appalling. I don't know what fra
ternities did to deserve this treatment, but
I've never seen anyone at Stanford wearing
his Greek letters.
Have you ever thought about the fact
that you never hear good things about fra
ternities?
When a fraternity's members succeed,
whether collectively or individually, there is
no story. There is a plethora of stupid peo
ple in this world, and some of them find
their way into fraternities and do irresponsi

ble things â€” that's about all you hear.
When I entered my fraternity as a fresh
man in 199(), I lived with 39 other MIT stu
dents. All hut one (who died tragically, in a
non-fraternity related incident) graduated.
Most of them are pursuing graduate study
now.
I had the opportunity to live with a Mar
shall scholar, a winner of the 2.70 contest,
and some people who graduated the top of
their departments; and I lived with several
people who got the house deeply involved
in community service projects.
Are you bored yet? Probably, and that's
why these stories aren't newsworthy
enough to be broadcast. If the recent death
of a MIT freshman had happened in an
MIT dorm, you wouldn't be talking about
it. If this were a suicide at MIT (and I know
of more of them than I know of alcohol
related deaths), you wouldn't have heard of
it, or if you were to hear of it, somehow it
would not have invoked the same outrage.
If this happened at a minority event,
there would be no talk of dismantling the
organization. (This is only meant to illus
trate my point.)
In all these cases the problem would not
be made into a national issue. But the cur
rent agenda is to eradicate fraternities. I
fear the same trend will now hit MIT, where
the fraternities have been a vital part of the
MIT experience, especially since MIT does
not have enough housing to accommodate
all freshmen.

Finally, let me clarify two things. First, 1
am not claiming that we were all altar boys
in the fraternity. 1 was able to get my share
of buffoonery out of my system there.
What's important to realize is this: No
one was ever coerced to drink but if one
chose to, there were always others around
to ensure safety. When I was president, I
made sure people were carded at parties
and tried to ensure that no one left the party
alone and intoxicated.
In fact, 1 would claim that people are in
greater danger of serious peril at 11 a.m. by
Stanford's clock "tower" than at any frater
nity party 1 ever attended.
In the end. what you have to believe
about fraternities is that the great part of a
fraternity is the friendships you make. For
get about the often hyped "rituals" or
"secret handshakes," forget about hazing,
and forget about the homophobia and
misogyny with which we are often falsely
accused.
What I'll always value the most is the
friendships that I made, that I chose to
make as a fraternity member, and that is
something none of you intellectual snobs
around here can take away with your
debates and remarks.
So keep on murmuring those stereotypes
if you don't believe me, just don't do it in
front of me.
