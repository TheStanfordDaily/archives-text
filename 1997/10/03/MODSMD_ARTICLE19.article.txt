## Man, marmots and the myriad lessons from nature 
### 
Tienlon Ho

'"~T~Viis summer I lived in an old mining
I town in Colorado, in a cabin circa
JL 1860 that had no hot water, a
decrepit wood stove and crevices in the
Hoor the widlh of a copy of War and Peace.
Each day over breakfast and lunch, I
watched a family of marmots (furry, round,
vegetarian beasts) that were living under
neath my home.
Considering the run-down state of the
tloor, the marmots and 1 were essentially
sharing one cabin in the middle of
nowhere.
By "nowhere" I mean that the nearest
grocery store was an 18-minute drive into
the yuppie ski town. In that town, less for
tunate marmots made their homes under
the streets.
1 learned that marmots are not active
except during the summer, because they
fall into a continuous cycle of sleep-like rest
during Ihe eight colder months.

So, the time they are conscious is
extremely precious, and marmots seem to
know this. They spend most of their energy
eating dandelions and finding spots to bask
in the sun.
They enjoy each other's company
through a sort of economical form of com
munication, a language built wholly on
chirps.
They start conversations with the rising
of the sun and then chirp continuously
throughout the day: "Chirp!" translates
into "A nice big flower to eat over here."
"Chirp!" "Let's mate." "Chirp!" "Get away
from our house!"
But even more than eating and talking,
they prefer the hours in the sun, pointing
their noses high up into its rays, using their
furry soft snouts as solar panels.
Their battles for particular logs or rocks
consist mainly of a series of head-to-head
combats, whirs of tails rotating 360 degrees

and chirps.
The most precious locales for my mar
mots were the piles of broken cement
behind our cabin, left over from an aban
doned construction project.
For the marmots, other precious com
modities were my socks, anything woven
and soft and loose pieces of aluminum foil.
They always seemed to know where I had
set the goods aside.
Sharing was all right with me — after all.
they were family.
1 was surprised to discover that other
people didn't feel that way. One afternoon
in the ski town, a disoriented marmot had
crawled under the hood of a vacationer's
temporarily abandoned car and gotten
stuck. It immediately began chirping in dis
tress. But because few marmots wander
into the parking lot of the laundromat, it
was left to chirp until I found it a few days
later.

It was impossible to release it from the
maze under the hood without the car
owner, and I was alone in the parking lot.
A few people stopped and commented
that it was an interesting bird call, but
afraid of what was making those sounds,
they continued on their way.
1 heard from someone else who had tried
to help it that after a few days the chirping
slowed and then stopped before finally
someone came and drove the car away.
Until the animal became trapped
between the fan blades of a Chevrolet,
many people did not know the fact that
such a thing as a marmot exists.
And yet, the marmots I knew took every
moment to study and observe people,
almost admiring us.
(hit lack of interest in them might be the
result of being conditioned to the comforts
of modern life, or it might be the result of a
fear of I lie natural condition. All of this

depends on how we define "nature."
Ignoring the idiomatic question, I do
know this: I spent many hours alone in the
wilderness, watching animals like the mar
mots live merely by instincts and impulses.
And they know more about us than we do
about them.
I have observed human life in cities, in
the United States, Asia, and now in the
United Kingdom, and we have literally built
walls to separate ourselves from things, like
marmots, which inhabit the w(hkls.
While culture and architecture differs
everywhere, its effect is always the same.
If the land and the animals appear to us
to be different and strange, it is the result of
societal choices that make nature difficult
to know.
