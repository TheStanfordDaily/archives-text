For the women's soccer team,
this is it.
" This game is the season for us,"
said head coach Steve Swanson.
" This game means more than any
game so far."

WOMEN'S SOCCER
â–  SUNDAY: Stanford (3 5) vs Col
orado College (7 3 2) at New Ma!
oney Field, 3 p.m.

Sunday's 3 pin. game against
Colorado College (7-3-2) is the Car
dinal's last chance for a tuneup be
fore opening Pacific 10 Conference
play against formidable opponents
like UCLA and USC. And if last
week's game against Santa Clara is
any indication, Stanford isn't ready.
The Cardinal lost its fourth game
in a row last Saturday, a 3-0 loss at
No. 4 Santa Clara. Stanford is now 3-
5, a disappointing record for a team
that opened the season ranked No.
16.
"We certainly need to get on
track for Pac-lOs," Swanson said.
"Hopefully this game will gear us up
for a difficult season ahead."
The Cardinal hasn't been playing
poorly Despite the five losses, the
team had outshot every opponent
until last week, when the Broncos
edged the Cardinal in shots on goal,
12-9.
Stanford has suffered from a
cruel combination of bad luck and
poor finishing, a disastrous duo that
has put the Cardinal in the loss col
umn more times than one might ex
pect from such a talented team.
"This is a time in the year when
we realize that we've been playing
well," said senior midfielder Rita
Hermiz, "but we haven't been get
ting results. Santa ('lata showed us
that."
Swanson said that the biggest
concern at present is the ( ard s con
fidence.
"We've got to be careful, because
we're doing a lot of things right," he
said." We have to make sure that we
continue to do the things that we've
done in the past. I've felt we've been
unlucky. Hut it is how you react dur
ing adversity that tells a lot about
your team."
According to Hermiz, Stanford is
rearing to go.
"We're really getting excited to
play," Hermiz said. "We had a good
week of practice, and we'ie all on
the same page."
Stanford's last chance to prime its
gears before Pac-10 games is by no
means a giveaway. Colorado Col
lege has historically owned matches
against Stanford, going 5-2-1 against
the Cardinal over the last decade.
I Jke the Cardinal, the Tigers are
a team on a mission. Despite re
spectable winning seasons in the
past two years, the historically suc
cessful program has failed to break a
postseason drought that stretches
back to 1991. This year, Colorado
College sports a deep team of veter
ans, mostly players who sat through
the last two frustrating seasons.

I"he Cardinal will have to look
out for senior forward Martina
Holan, who hails from nearby Los
Altos. In Colorado College's last
game, Holan had two goals in a 3-0
defeat of Colorado. She ranks sec
ond on the Tigers' all-time points list
with 92 and second in goals with 39.
But just because she's a local girl,
Holan and her squad will get no spe
cial treatment from the Cardinal.
"We're going to play hard and
aggressively for all of the 90 min
utes," Swanson said.
