## Notre Dame comes to Stanford unranked, nursing a three-game losing streak and favored by a point 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
One team is 3-1, ranked in the top 20, and playing at home, where it hasn't lost in almost a
year.
The other team is 1-3 — nearly 0-4 — and lias lost three straight games. It also has to trav
el 2,(XX) miles to play on the road. Who's the favorite?
It's a given, right?
Not when that 1-3 team is Notre Dame.
Tomorrow at Stanford Stadium, Stanford (3-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) will play its final
non conference game of the season against the lighting Irish (1-3), who are off to their worst
start since 1986.

And the Cardinal is the underdog.
Perhaps oddsmakers' reluctance to give (he pregame
advantage to the Cardinal can be attributed to Notre

Dame football's storied history.
The Irish have won eight national champi

onships, more than any other school
Seven Notre Dame players have won

the Heisman Trophy, the most of any
university. And Notre Dame cui

rently has 48 players in the NFL
But this Fighting Irish

team is not the 112 ighting Irish
of years past.

Notre Dame enters tomor
row's contest with its first three

game losing streak since 1987. Its only
win of the season was a close 17-13 sea
son opening victory over a mediocre
Georgia Tech squad.

The Fighting Irish will also face Stan
ford unranked for the first time in eight
meetings, dating back to 1963.
Still, Stanford is not taking Notre
Dame for granted. Tomorrow's network
televised game is expected to draw a
crowd of close to 80,CKK). The players i

and coaches realize how well re
spected the Irish are, and what a
win would mean foi the Cardi

nal.
"We're not concerned

with their record," said .se
nior safety Kadar

Hamilton. "We know
they lost three games,
and we know they're
going to want to win."
Notre Dame "just

has such great tradition and history," said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham.
Stanford does have some reasons to be confident. Its offense was spectacular in last week s
58-49 win over Oregon, and it faces a Notre Dame defense allowing 370 yards per game.
One of the offensive highlights from last week was the running game. For the first time in
Stanford history, two Cardinal running hacks, seniors Anthony Bookman and Mike Mitchell,
each rushed for 100-plus yards in consecutive games.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback ( had 1 lutchinson led a deadly passing attack, throwing
for 340 yards and four touchdowns. In all, the ('ardinal offense racked up an astounding 57K
total yards.
The improved offense in the last two weeks has been the result of several Stanford players

stopping up (heir performances and making big plays. Aside from the run

ning hacks anil Hutchinson, senior widcout Damon Dunn and sopho
more flanker Troy Walters have been extremely effective. Walters
now ranks fourth nationally in receptions per game and seventh in re
ceiving yards.

Witlingham attributes much of the success to the im
proved play of the offensive line, which allowed only one
sack against Oregon and cleared the way for the running

game.
"I thought (the offensive line's) play was excel

lent," he said. "It's probably time to compliment our

line for the job they did."
I lie Cardinal defense is another matter. Alter

giving up 4 l ) points and 530 yards of offense to
Oregon, the defense must find a way to improve.
Injuries have not helped. With sophomore safe

ty Tim Smith out for the season, the secondary has
been particularly vulnerable, allowing 590 yards
passing in the last two games.

Senior all I'ac-10 linebacker Chris Draft is still

nursing a hamstring injury he suffered during the
North Carolina game. Me is questionable for to
morrow's game.

I he Notre Dame offense the

Cardinal will face tomorrow

has undergone many

changes this season
under first-year head
coach Hob Davie, and it
has been slow to adjust.

Senior Irish quarterback Ron Fowl us has been

a starlet in each of his lour seasons, and is five completions and
107 yaids away from becoming the all lime leader at Notre Dame in
both those categories. Nevertheless, Powlus has endured muchcriti
cism from Irish fans because he has failed to hi ing a national champi
onship to South Bend.
Notre Dame also has a talented runner in junior Autry I )enson,
who rushed for more than I.(KM) yards last season, and a mammoth
offensive line that averages 6-foot-6 and 290 lbs.

"They have some of the most talent
ed athletes in the country," Willing
ham said.
But the Fighting Irish have man
aged only a paltry 13.8 points a
game, and have been ineffective in
crucial situations. Last week against
No. 6 Michigan, with a chance for an
upset, Notre Dame got the ball three

times in the second half inside
Wolverine territory and failed to
score, losing 21-14.
"I do think we're a better football
team right now than we were at this
time last week," Davie said. "1 do
think we'll get this thing turned
around."
For Stanford, tomorrow's game
is a great chance to beat a Notre
Dame team and gain some national
attention. And it's hard to believe
that the Cardinal will take this 1-3
team lightly.
