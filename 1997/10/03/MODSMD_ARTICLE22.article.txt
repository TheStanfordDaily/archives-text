# Little Walters a big-time receiving threat

I he word is out on Troy Walters.
Since first bursting onto the scene last
season as a scrappy freshman wideout
with a nose for big plays, Walters has de
veloped into one of Stanford's most po
tent — and most secret — weapons.
But a talent as big as Walters' can only
Ie kept under wraps for so long.
After turning in a career game last Sat
urday against Oregon one in which he
tallied 13 catches, just one shy of the Stan
ford record, for 169 yards and 2 touch
downs— Walters is finally earning recog
nition as one of the marquee players in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Whether he is receiving or returning

punts, said Walters, "all I want to do on
the field is make something happen."

also fourth in the Pac 10 with 13.2 yards
per punt return.
Although almost half of all Cardinal
receptii mis (33 of 74) and passing yardage
(4K3 of I(H>4) can be accredited to Wal

do what the coaches ask, Walters said.
"II they throw it my way, then just catch
the hall and see what I can do alter that."
This is the attitude with which Wallers
laces each game, including tomorrow's
much anticipated showdown vs. Notre
Dame. Despite I he mystique surrounding
the histoiical matchup the I loltzes, the
Walshes, Touchdown Tommy, the early
Rose Howl encounters tomorrow's
game against Notre Dame is simply "a hig
game because it's the next game," Wallers
explains.
"Notre Dame brings .ill the tradition,
and they're one of the top programs in the
nation year in and yeat out," he said. "We
