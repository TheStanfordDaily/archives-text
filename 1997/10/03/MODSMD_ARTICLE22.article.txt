# Little Walters a big-time receiving threat

### Rafael Ruano 
I he word is out on Troy Walters.
Since first bursting onto the scene last
season as a scrappy freshman wideout
with a nose for big plays, Walters has de
veloped into one of Stanford's most po
tent — and most secret — weapons.
But a talent as big as Walters' can only
Ie kept under wraps for so long.
After turning in a career game last Sat
urday against Oregon one in which he
tallied 13 catches, just one shy of the Stan
ford record, for 169 yards and 2 touch
downs— Walters is finally earning recog
nition as one of the marquee players in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Whether he is receiving or returning

punts, said Walters, "all I want to do on
the field is make something happen."
I le certainly has made things happen.
Four games into the season, Walters is
one of the national and conference lead
ers in receiving and punt returns. He
ranks second in the Pac-10 with K.25 re
ceptions per game and his 120.K receiving
yards per game places him seventh na
tionally and third in the conference. I le is
also fourth in the Pac 10 with 13.2 yards
per punt return.
Although almost half of all Cardinal
receptii mis (33 of 74) and passing yardage
(4K3 of I(H>4) can be accredited to Wal
ters, the playmaker claims his role on the
team "is just like any other receiver."
"(I just 11y to) g<» out and execute and

do what the coaches ask, Walters said.
"II they throw it my way, then just catch
the hall and see what I can do alter that."
This is the attitude with which Wallers
laces each game, including tomorrow's
much anticipated showdown vs. Notre
Dame. Despite I he mystique surrounding
the histoiical matchup the I loltzes, the
Walshes, Touchdown Tommy, the early
Rose Howl encounters tomorrow's
game against Notre Dame is simply "a hig
game because it's the next game," Wallers
explains.
"Notre Dame brings .ill the tradition,
and they're one of the top programs in the
nation year in and yeat out," he said. "We

want to win every game, gain mo
mentum going into the Pac-10."
Walters has been helping guide
the Cardinal to victory for quite
some time now. Over the last eight
games — dating back to last year's
win at UCLA — Walters hits caught
54 balls for 774 yards and four touch
downs. He has had breakout perfor
mances ever since, and it appears
redshirt sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson has made Walters
his favorite target.
With patience and hard work,
Walters, who stands 5-foot-8 and
never was touted with big-time po
tential, has found a home away from
home at Stanford, both on and off the
field. The flanker, who has been run

ning around some of the nation's
toughest defensive backs since his
high school days at A&M Consoli
dated High in College Station, Tex.,
now leaves silenced critics gazing on
the sidelines.
"Stanford is a great place to be,"
said Walters, a communication
major. "The students are supportive,
the coaches are supportive. It's just a
good environment. You can really be
yourself here."
Walters said he plans to keep on
"having fun" on the football field for
at least two more years.
"Our goal is to go to the Rose
Bowl and win," he said. "I didn't set
that many individual goals because 1
felt that if the team accomplishes a
lot, I would, (too)."
"1 just try to make big plays and
make all the plays that come my
way."
