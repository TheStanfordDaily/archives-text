No. 3 California (6-1)

The Cardinal faces its premiere
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
match of the season at 5 p m. today
when it meets highly touted and No.
2-ranked California at Diablo Val
ley College P<x>l.
The rivalry between the two
teams is nothing new I ast year, the

Cardinal (5-2, 0-0 MPSF) went 2-1
versus the Bears (6-1, 2-0), and all
thiee matches were closely fought.
Hie Cardinal won 10-9 at Stan
ford, lost 7 9 in the Big Splash at Cal
and won 7in the semifinals of the
MPSFTournament in Berkeley.
I*his year, however, the tables
seemed to have turned. According
to Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti, the Bears will present their
"best team in four or five years."
"We're an underdog," Detta
manti said of today's match. "Cal is a
shooter-oriented team. Ibey've got
a lot of size and a lot of speed. "
The Cardinal will be keeping an
especially close eye on the Bears'
sizeable two-meter man Brent Al
bright, a ft foot 6, 215 pound senior
and three time All American with
an excellent left-handed shot.
According to Stanford sopho
more fielder Andy Walburger, the
Cardinal will put "heavy pressure
on [Albright] and force him to
make mistakes."
"He shoots a lot of outside
shots," Walburger said. "We're
gonna get in his face and [we're]
not going to give him an inch."
"I think we're looking forward
to (the Cal match). We're in a
mast-win situation."
Offensively, the Cardinal ap
pears solid. For the season, the
squad has netted 65 goals and con

verted 15 of 34 chances on power
plays.
Sophomore driver Brian Heif
feron leads the Cardinal squad
with 12 goals, including two 2-
pointers registered in last Satur
day's homecoming match against
Pacific.
The Cardinal will conclude its
weekend Sunday with a rematch
against UOP. Stanford defeated
the Tigers 14-7 last Saturday in the
first home match of the season at
DeGuerre Pool.
For now, though, the Cardinal
is focusing its attention on the
Bears.
*" rhe first league game sets the
tone for the rest of the year," said
junior holeman Crosby Grant.
