tute goalkeeper as a child, and Har
vard coach Stephen Locker is one of
Clark's close friends.
The connections don't end there.
Two members of the Stanford
coaching staff were on Clark's Dart
mouth teams, goalkeeper coach
Brian Wiese, a master's student, and
assistant coach Geoffrey Wheeler.
In addition, the Cardinal's volun
teer coach this year is Bill Scott, who
taught several members of the Har
vard team while they were students
at Phillips Academy in Massachu
setts. Scott is currently on a yearlong
sabbatical from Phillips.
In playing Harvard and Dart
mouth, the most important thing
will be to keep emotions out of the
picture, Clark said.
"There's obviously a lot of emo
tional stuff with coming back," he
said. "You can't let emotions creep
into sports. It's very, very important
that you stay focused on the job at
hand."
Clark, who last week earned his
100 th career victory as a college soc
cer coach, will be looking to contin
ue his and his team's success this
weekend. Stanford is riding high on
its undefeated record, including last
week's 1-0 overtime victory over
Sacramento State in the conference
opener. The Cardinal's 13-game
winning streak, the longest in the
nation, spans two seasons.
Although the pressure of MPSF
play will be absent this weekend, the
team will still need to concentrate
on its games. Harvard (2-1-2) is un
ranked but coming off a 16-2 season
last year, one of the best in the
program's history. Dartmouth
(3-1-1) is ranked No. 22 in the

NCSAA / Umbro Division 1 poll.
Cal (5-1-1, 1-0) and Dartmouth
kick off tournament play at 2 p.m.
today, followed by Stanford-Har
vard at 4 p.m.
Harvard's starting goalkeeper,
Jordan Dupuis, was one of Clark's
players in New Zealand. He will be
looking to improve his team's over
all record to 3-1-2. The team has an
even 1-1-1 record in Ivy League
play.
The Crimson, which was ranked
17th in the NCSAA / Umbro pre
season poll, has not lost a game since
its season opener against Pennsylva
nia. Harvard's players are excellent,
Clark said, but he added that "teams
can only be good if you let them be
good."
His hope for the match, he said, is
to "make it a game they remember,
but not for reasons they would like."
On Sunday, Cal meets Harvard
at 11 a.m., with Stanford's match
against Dartmouth scheduled for 1
p.m.
Dartmouth's Big Green has won
three of its last four games and is
ranked No. 2 in New England. This
week is the team's first showing in
the national poll. Last week's game
against lOth-ranked Boston Univer
sity resulted in a tie, but Clark said
Dartmouth outplayed and outshot
BU.
The team shows a somewhat sim
ilar depth to the Cardinal, with sev
eral different players having scored
goals. The Big Green also boasts a
talented goalkeeper, junior Matt
Nyman, who ranks third in the
country with a .41 goals-against av
erage. Stanford's Adam Zapala, a
redshirt freshman, is ranked just
above Nyman with a .25 goals
against average.
Overall, "it's a great weekend,"
Clark said. "It's a great opportunity
to see four good teams."
