# Irish linebacker thrust into new role
## 
### Joe Cavato Special to The Stanford Daily 
With the graduation last spring of
star inside linebackers Lyron Cob
bins and Kinnon Tatum, Notre
Dame's Jimmy Friday knew that he
would have some big shoes to fill.
What he didn't know was that he
would have to fill those shoes with
out the help of junior Bobbie
Howard.
Against Georgia Tech in the
Fighting Irish's season opener, Fri
day received his first start at the
strong linebacker slot — the first ex
tensive playing time of his career.
Three quarters later, Friday saw
himself in the weak linebacker posi
tion, calling the defensive plays,
after Howard suffered an injury.
Now, he's the inside linebacker with
the most experience.
"We've been really pleased with
Jimmy," said Notre Dame head
coach Bob Davie. "We've put him in
a tough situation. He practiced all
spring at [strong] linebacker then we
had to move him to [weak] line
backer in a game. This being his first
year actually playing, that's a pretty

heavy load on him."
Friday certainly has helped the
Irish defense. He leads the team in
tackles, and has stepped into a lead
ership role.
"Even though he is a young guy
who hasn't played much, he brings a
lot of leadership and a lot of focus as
far as getting the team ready to go,"
said junior linebacker Kory Minor.
"He's a great person to be around
and a great role model, and he's
doing a great job for us."
With the linebacking corps
thinned due to graduation and in
jury, Friday has been counted on to
take on the role of leader for less-ex
perienced linebackers like Ronnie
Nicks and freshman Grant Irons.
"(Howard) is a big loss to the de
fense," Friday said. "With him not
being there, 1 have had to get better
as far as communication and being
more vocal and thinking on my
toes."
"He's been forced to become a
leader," Davie said. "It's really un
fair to Jimmy because he's had to get
the other younger linebackers lined
up. So it's put an added load on him,
but I think it's kind of accelerated his

growth a little bit. He's been a leader
for us, and even though it's not fair to
ask him to be, 1 think he's responded
well."
Friday has not yet developed the
big-play capability of Tatum or Cob
bins, but he has given the middle of
the defense exactly what it needs —
consistency.
"He's been very steady," Davie
said. "He hasn't made a whole lot of
big plays, but he's been very consis
tent, and he's kind of been a stabiliz
ing force in there even though he's a
young guy himself."
In Friday's first two seasons at
Notre Dame, the high school Ail-
American was forced to watch from
the sidelines. But he took advantage
of the opportunity to learn.
"I definitely learned a lot from
them (Tatum and Cobbins)," Friday
said. "Just watching them lead by ex
ample and just talking to them with
whatever questions I had has been a
benefit to me. Lyron lived right
down the hall from me my freshman
year, and we talked about a lot of dif
ferent things."
Friday's transition from backup
to starter and from starter to leader

is not the only change he has had to
make in his relatively short time
wearing the blue and gold.
His freshman year, Friday was
moved to defensive end. His goal on
the line was to get as big as possible,
but he was forced to shed that weight
when he was moved back to inside
linebacker.
"I felt that I needed to lose some
weight," Friday said. "I was up to
about 255 pounds, and 1 knew that I
had to lose some weight to increase
my quickness. Playing inside line
backer involves more lateral move
ment, and you have to be more
rounded. You have to take on block
ers and be able to drop back into
pass coverage. So you can't be one
dimensional."
Now Friday's found a home in the
middle of the defense.
"He decided to stay at linebacker,
and through the offseason he made a
commitment to become a better
player," Davie said. "So it's fun to
see a guy like that get some rewards
for all the hard work he's put into it."
