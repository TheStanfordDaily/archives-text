# The
						Way It Is.

### 
Occasionally we ask a distinguished member of
the Stanford community to speak frankly about the
issues that affect us all.
This week we have asked Mr. Dale Ornery to
express his opinions. Mr. Ornery graduated two
years ago but still lives in the Palo Alto area, drinks
at the coffee house, and goes to EBF parties. He
insists that "smokers have rights too" and expresses
this right 40 times a day.

Mr. Ornery, / have often heard />eo/>/e
coinj)Utin on campus that thctv is "Yo
dating at Stanford".
You know I get this one a lot. People
conic up to me, and they look at me like
they're going to cry, and they say, "Mr.
()rnery, win* is it tli.it there is no dating
;it Stanford?".
1 take a drag on my cigarette and
say, "(let a life, you tosspots."
Has it ever oceurcd to you that if you
spent a) a little more time actually ask
ing people out 011 a date and h) a little
less time downloading porn from the
Internet that your chances of going out
on a date might increase?

All right, here's another way to think
about it. These are things that aren't
going to get you a date: studying with
your door elosed, picking your nose in
the 24-hour study room, smelling of dog
snot half the day, enmiug out of your
room every week only to gel so drunk
that you think the funniest thing in the
world is lying faee down in the earpet
and vomiting. Sound familiar? That's
right, that's you. That's why you're not
going out on dates.
Whine less. I have a hang-over and
have to deal with a sensation similar to
a thousand midgets hanging on the
inside of my skull with tiny silver mal
lets. I don't want to listen to your dat
ing problems.
