### Molly Masland 
Forty Stanford workers lost their
jobs last week after Vice Provost
Geoffrey Cox announced on Sept.
25 that the University will eliminate
the Facilities Project Management
office in an effort to cut costs and im
prove the efficiency of Stanford's
billion-dollar building program.
The 20-year-old unit, formerly in
charge of running campus building
projects, will be replaced by a new
organization called Capital Planning
and Management. Instead of em
ploying University construction and

project managers, the new organiza
tion will contract with outside con
struction companies to complete
building projects. Assoc. Vice
Provost Michael Rosenthal will
head the new unit.
The shakeup followed the July 25
resignation of former Project Man
agement Directoi Mark Jones who
cited "philosophical differences"
with Stanford officials over the cam
pus building program as the primary
reason for his departure. The office
has received criticism in recent years
from a number of University offi
cials and faculty for project delays

and cost overruns.
For most of the staff, however,
the layoffs came as a surprise.
"I'm sad to be leaving," said Ad
ministrative Support Services Man
ager Victoria Waxstein. "From all
tangible indicators, it looked like
Mark Jones and the rest of the de
partment were doing an incredible
job. Stanford's losing the best of the
best that they went to a lot of trouble
to recruit."
During the last two years, Stan
ford has engaged in a nationwide re
cruitment effort to hire employees
for the department. Many of those

workers, some hired as recently as
six months ago, are now being asked
to leave. The University will provide
severance packages for workers who
qualify based on length of employ
ment and is encouraging employees
to apply for jobs in other campus de
partments.
Stanford officials hope that the
new plan will result in construction
projects being completed faster and
at less cost than before. According to
( ox, "Our goal here is to have con
sistently better results on our build
ing projects We want to get the
best service from the best experts."
