# Shoven secures $4 million for H&S

### Caroline Perry 
The benefits from a recent $4 mil
lion endowment to create new re
sources for the School of Humanities
and Sciences will soon be felt by both
faculty and students.
The money will be used to estab
lish the Vernon R. and Lysbeth War
ren Anderson Deanship for the
School of Science and Humanities, a
discretionary fund for the head of the
school.
The school contains 40 different
departments and does about 80 per
cent of undergraduate teaching, said
Kathy Veit, associate director of the
Office of Development.
An endowment ordinarily is used
to pay the salary of the chairholder,
but in this case John Shoven, the
school's dean, is planning to use it for
the whole school.
Shoven will not have access to all
of the money at once. He can only
spend the payout, a percentage of the

endowment that is allotted to him by
the Board of Trustees.
The dean's apportionment will
usually be about 5 percent per year.
This year that figure will be between
$200,000 and $250,000. The amount
grows yearly as the endowment's
principal grows through investments.
Shoven doesn't have any specific
plans for the money as of yet. He said,
however, that it would be used to
bring in "new faculty and programs."
Shoven feels that the endowment
is a "tremendous gift" and that the
money will "make the job of dean a
lot more rewarding" now that he has
enough capital to "support exciting
new ventures."
Veit said she felt that perhaps a
portion of the endowment would be
given to current department chairs
for speakers or programs they want
ed to present.
"The fund will enable [the dean]
to respond to initiatives by the facul
ty," she added. The original proposal

requesting an endowment said the
funds would be used to "provide im
portant supplementary support often
needed by the dean in recruiting and
retaining the school's most stellar fac
ulty" as well as allowing the dean to
"place expanded resources at one of
the most important points of deci
sion-making in the school" â€” the de
partment chairs.
Vernon and Lysbeth Anderson,
according to Shoven, have been
friends of the University for a long
time. Both received bachelor's de
grees from Stanford, Vernon Ander
son in 1953 and his wife in 1954.
Vernon Anderson was both a co
founder and CEO of Vidar Corp., a
company working on digital tele
phone transmissions systems, and he
was also the first president of Silicon
Graphics.
The Andersons have been very
active on fundraising committees for
Stanford. Vernon Anderson has also
served on numerous advisory boards

including the Alumni Association
Executive Committee and the Grad
uate School of Business Advisory
Council.
He also served on the Stanford
University Board of Trustees from
1985 to 1990. Lysbeth Anderson is
the president of the V&L Anderson

Family Foundation
and serves on the
Planned Parent
hood board in Mar
Monte.
According to
Shoven, the Ander
sons made the en
dowment because
they felt that the

School of Humanities and Sciences is
pivotal to getting a well-rounded ed
ucation at Stanford.
The endowment has been warmly
appreciated by all those involved.
"We're absolutely thrilled about
it," said Veit. Shoven said enthusias
tically, "It's fantastic."
