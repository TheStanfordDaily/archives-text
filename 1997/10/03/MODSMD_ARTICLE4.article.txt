# CS lecturer fights axing
## Clausing may take legal action 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
After losing his position in the
Computer Science Department,
Lecturer Stephen Clausing is far
from forgetting the issue.
Clausing, who was hired four
years ago, taught such classes as
( omputer Science 105 A: "Introduc
tion to Computers," the introducto
ry course intended for non majors,
IcMB,l c MB, a senior project course, and
195 A and 1958, software engineer
ing courses.
Since his dismissal, 19.SA and
1958 are no longer being offered.
Because of unresolved disagree
ments, (Causing, who now works for
Apple Computer, filed grievances
with the University. He is currently
speaking to a lawyer, and he said he
will soon be pursuing legal action
against the I Jniversity.
Clausing, who lectured at Yale
I Jniversity for seven years before
coming to Stanford, said he followed
the 105 A syllabus faithfully during
his first quarter at Stanford, despite
thinking it was "old-fashioned... a
watered down version of HKiA"
the introductory programming

course for technical disciplines.
Among other changes he made,
Clausing added lectures on a variety
of computer science topics and
switched to teaching a more general
programming language.
Initially, students evaluated his
teaching performance as poor.
Clausing's ratings, however, rose al
most 70 percent after he revamped
the curriculum.
Despite extraordinarily high stu
dent ratings, a discrepancy of 40
points in evaluation scores during
his third year teaching 105 A
brought ( 'lausing under scrutiny.
Clausing said part of the unfavor
able student evaluations of 105 A
could be attributed to the shortage
of teaching assistants for the course.
"On one occasion, there was a
single 105 teaching assistant in the
computer LaIR, who was complete
ly swamped, and four section lead
crs for another class, who had noth
ing to do," Clausing said. "We were
simply not providing adequate sup
port for the students. Moreover,
there seemed to be a fundamental
inequity in the staffing between 105
