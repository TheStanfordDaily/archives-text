# CS lecturer fights axing
## Clausing may take legal action 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
After losing his position in the
Computer Science Department,
Lecturer Stephen Clausing is far
from forgetting the issue.
Clausing, who was hired four
years ago, taught such classes as
( omputer Science 105 A: "Introduc
tion to Computers," the introducto
ry course intended for non majors,
IcMB,l c MB, a senior project course, and
195 A and 1958, software engineer
ing courses.
Since his dismissal, 19.SA and
1958 are no longer being offered.
Because of unresolved disagree
ments, (Causing, who now works for
Apple Computer, filed grievances
with the University. He is currently
speaking to a lawyer, and he said he
will soon be pursuing legal action
against the I Jniversity.
Clausing, who lectured at Yale
I Jniversity for seven years before
coming to Stanford, said he followed
the 105 A syllabus faithfully during
his first quarter at Stanford, despite
thinking it was "old-fashioned... a
watered down version of HKiA"
the introductory programming

course for technical disciplines.
Among other changes he made,
Clausing added lectures on a variety
of computer science topics and
switched to teaching a more general
programming language.
Initially, students evaluated his
teaching performance as poor.
Clausing's ratings, however, rose al
most 70 percent after he revamped
the curriculum.
Despite extraordinarily high stu
dent ratings, a discrepancy of 40
points in evaluation scores during
his third year teaching 105 A
brought ( 'lausing under scrutiny.
Clausing said part of the unfavor
able student evaluations of 105 A
could be attributed to the shortage
of teaching assistants for the course.
"On one occasion, there was a
single 105 teaching assistant in the
computer LaIR, who was complete
ly swamped, and four section lead
crs for another class, who had noth
ing to do," Clausing said. "We were
simply not providing adequate sup
port for the students. Moreover,
there seemed to be a fundamental
inequity in the staffing between 105
and 106."
Gausing said that despite requests
for more teaching assistants, the Com
puter Science Department denied
him the aid, saying it needed to con
serve departmental resources.
Instead, Gausing said he was told
to reduce the difficulty level of assign
ments, so that the staffing level he had
would be able to accommodate him.
"I refused to reduce the syllabus to
some Mickey-Mouse routine," Gaus
ing said. "So I began working volun
tarily as a TAin the helper hours on
Sundays. This was too late and too lit
tle. As a result, the course was made a
failure, and the resulting low evalua
tion scores were held against me."
"Not once was I told in specific
terms how I had failed as a teacher.
When I challenged the system of
teaching evaluation I was told smugly
that the system worked fine and in any
event it was not my prerogative to
question it," Gausing said. "Did I
mumble in the classroom? Were my
lectures difficult to understand or ir
relevant? Was I unfair in grading?
What did I do wrong?"
After Gausing was informed he
would not be reappointed last au
tumn, he began an appeal process. He
also issued an "urgent appeal" e-mail
to former students, asking them to

write letters in his support.
Gausing received more than 70
letters over the summer. Students'
comments in their letters to the Uni
versity praised Gausing's "exception
al teaching skills," his "dedication"
and his "deep understanding of the
material."
Some students, although they ac
knowledge Gausing's understanding
of the material, were not impressed
with his teaching style. A student who
took 106 A from Gausing, and who
wished to remain anonymous said he
thought Gausing was "well versed in
the knowledge — he was competent.
But he didn't impart enthusiasm to
the material. He didn't have an excit
ing lecture style."
"That there are glaring contradic
tions in the data," said Gausing, "ap
parently does not bother my depart
ment, but for scholars who are used to
weighing all the facts, we should be
disturbed. If Stanford is unwilling to
put in place an evaluation system that
would acquire such information, then
the fault lies with Stanford, not with
me. Even lecturers deserve this con
sideration. My career is rather impor
tant to me, and I will not stand by and
see my reputation as a teacher ruined.
I refuse to go gently into that good
night."
Neither the Provost's Office nor
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts,
the department's chair, had any com
ment on the issue.
