### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Islam has arrived in the Religious
Studies Department — at least tem
porarily. With the appointment of
Visiting Asst. Prof. Ebrahim Moosa,
the department is offering two cours
es in Islamic studies this quarter.
Students have long asked for a
commitment from the department to
the study of Islam, raising the issue re
peatedly in public student forums
such as the "Tea and Cookies" with
University President Gerhard
Casper. Only one course in Islam is
regularly offered at Stanford, and that
is through the I listory Department.
"I'm ecstatic," said computer sci
ence masters student Ibrahim Maska
tia, the president of the Islamic Soci
ety of Stanford ( Jniversity. "True, it's

only for one quarter, hut I hope this
indicates the beginning of a trend."
Moosa comes to Stanford from
the University of C ape Town in
South Africa. Because of other com
mitments, he will only be at Stanford
during fall quarter.
Both Moosa and Muskatia credit
ed Prof. Arnold F.isen, chair of the
Religious Studies Department, and
Dean of the Chapel Robert (iregg
with the decision to invite Moosa to
Stanford.
Muskatia praised Moosa and said,
"I hope he can be an adviser to the Is
lamic community here at Stanford."
History I'iof. Joel Bcinin, who
teaches what was until now Stan
ford's only regular class on Islam, I lis
tory 185: "Introduction to Islamic
Civilization," was supportive of the
department.
"I think it's an excellent thing for
them to do," he said. "I hope they
continue this."
Moosa will teach two courses this
quarter. The first is a survey course,
Religious Studies 27: "Introduction
to Islam." The second, Religious
Studies 110: "Islam in the Modern
World," explores the reforms of
Islam in the 19th century, the rela

tionship between Islam and the state,
gender issues and Islamic education.
Even with the addition of these
two courses, the Religious Studies
Department offers a large majority of
its courses in East Asian religions,
Christianity and Judaism. It offers no
regular courses on Hinduism.
Moosa said he hoped that the de
partment would continue to exhibit a
commitment to the study of Islam
even after his departure.
"My function is to advise the de
partment about how to proceed from
here," he said.
