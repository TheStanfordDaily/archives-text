Islam has arrived in the Religious
Studies Department â€” at least tem

University President Gerhard
Casper. Only one course in Islam is
regularly offered at Stanford, and that
is through the I listory Department.

Moosa comes to Stanford from
the University of C ape Town in
South Africa. Because of other com

during fall quarter.
Both Moosa and Muskatia credit

Muskatia praised Moosa and said,
"I hope he can be an adviser to the Is
