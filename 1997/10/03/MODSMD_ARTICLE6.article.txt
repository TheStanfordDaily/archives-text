## Viennese Ball will move off campus 
### Nathan Watanabe 
In a striking break with tradition,
winter quarter's Viennese Ball will
be held at the Hyatt Rickeys in Palo
Alto and not at Roble Gym — the
first time the dance has been held off
campus in its long history.
Reanimating the classical dance
styles and august ambiances of prior
centuries, the Viennese Ball re
mains one of the more time-hon
ored events on campus; yet tradition
takes a back seat to comfort as stu
dents opt for the "less constricting"
environment of an off-campus facil
ity to the conditions at Roble.
"We had been thinking about
changing the location of the dance for
a while, and last year on the [World
Wide Web], through a survey, we dis
covered that students preferred a
place with more space," Viennese
Ball Committee Chair Phoebe Ho, a
senior, said. " The Web feedback had

a lot to do with our decision."
"The major reason for the
change was to accommodate more
people — more space for more stu
dents," said senior Lauren Hill, a
hotel liaison for the ball committee.
The yen for extra room notwith
standing, holding the event off cam
pus allows the committee to split the
work with hotel employees, avoid
ing, according to Hill, "the severe
preparation headaches that every
one went through last year."
In line with the change in accom
modations, ticket sales hope to ben
efit from the larger space provided,
as prior years were characterized by
students sleeping out in notoriously
twisted lines for tickets.
"It's really difficult to get tickets,
and I'm concerned about the ticket
prices since last year's were pretty ex
pensive," said senior Leslie Cho. Last
year, sleeping out garnered $5 deduc
tions on ticket prices, however this

year, sleeping out will yield no reduc
tion in the cost of the $65 ticket.
"You don't have to sleep out toget
tickets for the dance," reminds I 10.
Another consideration for the lo
cation change is the fact that Roble
staff issued a stern warning to the
dance committee members last year
after the facility was damaged dur
ing set up for the ball.
"They drilled holes in the walls
and they left glue in the courtyard."
said Asst. Athletic Director Shirley
Schoof. "We treat the gym like our
home. I don't hold a grudge against
them, but I was disappointed."
"It was completely out of line,
and [Schoof] had every right to be
angry," said I lill, who also served as
last year's ball committee chair.
"However, I don't think she was jus
tified in saying we didn't care about
the place.
