# Farm breeds enterprising spirit

If Andrew Pelletier and Mustafa Jamil, seniors,
and Red Byer, '95, had to write ;in essay titled "What
I did on my summer vacation," they would not write
about idle trips to the beach or dull family reunions.
Instead they'd write about what it's like to start their
own company.
They've seen the levels of success reached by Stan
ford alumni such as Jerry Yang, creator of Yahoo!,
William I lewlett and David Packard, founders of the
namesake computer company. And this past summer
Pelletier, Jamil and Byer took the initiative and seized
hold of the entrepreneurial spirit hy starting Apell
Communications. The company's first project is to
launch an online retail center called Tsunami Wharf.
Pelletier, a senior majoring in economics, discov
ered the need for an online World Wide Web site that
offered the kind of luxury goods that he himself want
ed to purchase. I le said he wanted a single site that ex
hibited sports equipment and accessories, consumer
electronics, high-end watches, cigars, smoking acces
sories and wine.
"I've always wanted to run a company," Pelletier
said. "But the bureaucracy that exists within large, es
tablished companies makes it nearly impossible to


Ted McGuire Daily
work your way into that position be
fore the age of 50."
Recognizing that there is money
waiting to be made through the in
ternet by targeting the Web's largest
demographic segment: the young,
college-educated, urban profession
al, Pelletier then approached his
friend Jamil with the opportunity to
take part in his venture.
Jamil, a senior, also sees this pro
ject as a highly plausible and attrac
tive career option.
Pelletier and Jamil eventually
recognized the need for a graphic
designer who could design the site's
layout and infrastructure as well as
create a logo. The pair became a trio
when Byer, their freshman resident
assistant and friend, joined the com
pany.
On many occasions the three
would start working on the project
during the evening only to find
themselves still engaged until early
the next morning.
"We would pull all-nighters, and

I would have to go to work the next
morning," said Byer, a laser engi
neer at Lightwave Electronics in
Palo Alto. "I didn't mind because I
was having such a good time, and I
believe it's a valuable experience to
work on a team where everybody is
willing to give the others in the
group the opportunity to do what
they are good at."
The trio is designing the site to be
both an online mall and a 24-hour
trade show that will provide shop
pers with a fun format within which
they can locate and purchase high
quality products. The company also
aims to become the premier retailer
for their product suppliers.
Stanford is certainly no stranger
to the entrepreneurial spirit. Silicon
Valley is a prime example of how
this spirit manifests itself for those
associated with the University. TT>e

Terman, was dean of the Schcxil of

Graphics and Sun Microsystems are
examples of the many companies
started by Stanford professors, ad
ministrators or students.
