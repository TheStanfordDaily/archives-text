In his new book, Exegesis, Astro Teller gives us a
voyeuristic view of a world that is becoming
increasingly familiar to us, the world of cyber
space. This intriguing story exemplifies how one
can get emotionally caught up in technology. This
is how one Email can turn into an entire story that
is more than ever true to life. Astro Teller is a
twenty-six year old Ph.D. student at Carnegie
Mellon, where he specializes in artificial intelli
gence. Exegesis is his first novel.
