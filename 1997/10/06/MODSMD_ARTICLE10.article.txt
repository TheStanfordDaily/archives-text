Clinton videotapes
released
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House released videotapes
yesterday showing President Clin
ton greeting donors at 44 finance
related coffees during the year
before his re-election. The presi
dent is seen thanking his visitors
without directly asking for money.
In footage from one reception, a
former Democratic Party chair
man could be heard refusing five
checks from a donor who offered
them inside the White House —
while Clinton talked golf with
another guest.

The DNC official, Don Fowler,
tells the donor the checks could be
handled later.
The tapes were provided to the
news media by the White House
without comment late in the day.
Recorded by White House televi
sion crews between Aug. 3, 1995
and Aug. 23, 19%, the tapes had
been turned over to Justice
Department and congressional
investigators late Friday.
The revelation of the tapes
touched off a political firestorm
among Republicans who demanded
to know why they were not turned
over when the White House was
first asked for all records.

Government insists air
craft is safe
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) — And after years of the
most severe testing possible, the
Energy Department says the
shielded plutonium for NASA's
soon-to-be-launched Saturn probe,
Cassini, is almost indestructible.
Cassini is safe whether the
rocket blows or not, Beverly
Cook, the Energy Department's
program director for plutonium
power systems, and other govern
ment officials say. Any release of
plutonium would be minute, they
insist.
