JERUSALEM (AP) â€” In an implied admission of
Israel's role in a botched assassination attempt in Jor
dan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended
Israel's right to fight terrorism "without compromise"
yesterday
The bungled Sept. 25 attack on Khalid Mashaal in
Jordan has damaged peacemaking and thrown rela
tions with Israel's friendliest Arab ally, Jordan, into cri
sis. In Israel yesterday, there were calls for an official
inquiry, and an opposition lawmaker demanded
Netanyahu's resignation.
In the attack, two men carrying Canadian passports
injected poison into the Mamas leader's ear as he
entered his office in Amman. Mashaal was hospitalized
with breathing problems but recovered.
In its first public comment on the attempt,
Netanyahu's government stopped short of confirming
that Israeli agents were responsible.
But in a Cabinet statement, Netanyahu called

Mashaal "the No. 1 figure in Hamas, responsible for the
murder of innocent Israeli citizens," and said, "'Hie
government's obligation is to protect the lives of its cit
izens and to fight terror without compromise."
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan indicated that
negotiations were under way with Jordan over the
return of the two attackers, now in Jordanian custody.
"We'd rather not refer to the specific case as long as
the negotiations are going on," he told reporters.
"We're not discussing the case as long as there are
Israelis in custody in Jordan."
Bar-Illan said Mashaal was responsible for activat
ing the I lamas cells that carried out two deadly suicide
bombings in Jerusalem this summer.
In protest of the use of Canadian passports in the
attack, Canada recalled its ambassador from Israel. Jor
dan's King Hussein called the attack "a reckless act car
ried out by a party that has no faith in peace" in an
interview with the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper.
