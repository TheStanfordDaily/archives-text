## Editorial Current system most beneficial Keep house staff terms 
### 
Despite the recent criti
cism regarding housing issues
this fall and last spring, it's fair
to say that Stanford's housing options
clearly lend themselves to a variety of
living arrangements.
Although the University maintains
guidance in all of these housing situa
tions (for example, by providing and
training a resident assistant for all hous
es and dorms on campus), the degree of
this involvement varies tremendously
among different living situations.
In many houses on campus, student
managers assume much of the responsi
bility. il not all of the responsibility, for
the daily functioning of the house. We
think this is a great aspect of Stanford
residential life — it gives students the
opportunity to manage a housing budget
of more than $3(),(K)() or to determine
cooking and hashing schedules, among
many other responsibilities.
The recent proposal made by the
Office of Residential Education to shift
the timing of staff selection and hiring for
co-ops and self-ops was a mistake for sev
eral reasons. In the past, house managers,
food managers and financial officers have
been selected during winter quarter to
serve a term that lasts from spring quar
ter to winter the following year.
I he proposal suggests that these posi
tions switch to a fall to spring schedule in
order to synchronize with University
positions, such as resident assistants and
focus assistants who are chosen in the
spring. RAs and FAs are hired for a fall
to spring term. The advantages of the
proposed switch to a fall-spring term are
unclear, and there is potential for disad
vantages to arise.
According to Laurette Beeson, the
assistant director for student managers
on the Row, this shift in hiring schedules
was proposed so that staff members in
charge of hiring chefs and cleaning crews
will have more experience during con
tract negotiations in the spring.
There are at least two problems with
this reasoning. First, students and staff in
the houses claim that the spring term is a
necessity. Not only does it provide on
the-job training for new staff, but it also
provides some type of continuity in the
staff and in the residence through the
following year.
Spring quarter training allows the new
stall members to become adjusted to
their jobs while the old staff is still avail
able for consultation and while the cur
rent residents are familiar with the
house's routine.
The current svstem also eases the

transition in the fall. The experience and
on-the-job training that the kitchen and
financial managers received in the spring
ensures that at least those parts of the
house will run efficiently in the first few
weeks of the quarter, a time when every
thing else seems to be going wrong.
A second problem is that the policy
also affects houses that have cooks as
well as houses that don't. This is quite a
puzzler. The only valid argument, and a
questionable one indeed, for changing
the current system is the idea behind
cook hiring, however, other houses are
also being required to make the shift.
For houses like the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Chi Theta Chi and Columbae,
what possible justification could Res Ed
have for mandating a change?
We also question why the responsibili
ty of hiring a house cook would fall onto
the shoulders of a new kitchen manager
anyway. It seems like a more reasonable
option would be to have the old staff as
well as the new staff collectively negotiate
the cook's contract for the following year.
Although Res Ed brought managers
from the Row houses together last year
to discuss the situation, the changes have
not been discussed this year, which is
another problem.
Houses could decide if they wanted to
make the transition for this fall or for
next fall and already, staff in some of the
houses that made the shift this year are
challenging the merits of the change.
Beeson claims that the new staff
members who serve fall to spring terms
will receive the same amount of training,
so newer staff members would not be
any less qualified than in years past.
The equal training argument is a weak
one considering that it's a little unclear
how a new staffer will learn his or her
duties from an old staffer who is no
longer around, which would be the case
if the new member's term begins in the
fall. We wonder who will provide this
training, and we question whether this
new training will be equally as effective.
The wisdom of this entire proposal is
ambiguous at best. Unlike many aspects
of Res Ed, which are often well
researched and beneficial, this proposal
is predominantly disadvantageous. We
encourage Res Ed to do as it says it will
— to form the committee of house man
agers and residents soon, including mem
bers from non-Row houses.
In the meantime, we sympathize with
the communities that have already made
this change and encourage those who
don't want to make the shift to speak up
now.
