## Reflections of a former model 
### 
"TL "TO THING
tastes as good
-L as thin feels."
I found this quote, in
small glossy print, as if cut
out of one of those
resources of enlightened
philosophy known as a
"women's magazine,"

taped to the side of my grandmother's fridge
three years ago.
We were cleaning out her house after her
70 years of life ended from complications of
an abdominoplasty (a.k.a. tummy tuck).
I don't think thin felt nearly as good as
she hoped.
I am still saddened by the thought that
after a long, productive and accomplished
life, my grandmother should be tormented
by the same obsession that claims the bodies
of many adolescent girls: the irrational
desire to be thin.
Though maybe its not so irrational. I dis
covered in my late teens this twisted formu
la for making money: under 21, at least 5'9"
and no more than 120 pounds.
Those are the strange job prerequisites
held by the cultural conglomerate known as
the Ford Modeling Agency.
Even stranger to me now is remembering
that I once sUx)d within the walls of that
company ready for hire.
Yep, that's the skeleton in my closet (lit
erally). Although I don't often admit it
because it conflicts with my feminist image,
at one point in my life I fit the mold, by
chance, and so I took advantage of my own
body and spent a year selling it to the almost

inevitably fat, white, male corporate clients
of the modeling world. I never made it big,
but I managed to make some money.
For the present, I want to stick with this
perverse notion that the business of female
beauty is something that can be measured,
packaged and sold in a bottle.
It's something finally hit me full force this
past summer when I walked back into Ford.
Because sadly enough, after three years of
higher education, my body is still my most
lucrative commodity. The previous summer
I managed to finance a three-month, unpaid
internship by three days in front of a camera,
and I was hoping this summer to do the
same.
But my plan for easy cash was thwarted
when I failed to pass the skinniness test: at a
whopping 26 inches my waist no longer
qualified as the mandated emaciatedness.
Because my waistline was actually now
pushing a good 26 inches, there was no use
fudging it. Excuses about late-night trips to
Toyon's terrace for those miracle peanut
butter chocolate chip cookies that could
inspire me to keep reading Kant for another
two hours would be useless. 1 wasn't about
to diet. So I guess that my short career
exploiting cultural beauty standards was
over because I no longer fit those standards.
At first, part of me wanted to hide my
face in shame. I once again felt like the
pudgy 8-year-old who was often chided for
her ample padding. It was not until junior
high school that a series of growth spurts
came along that twisted my spine and flat
tened my tummy. Womanhood seems to
have blessed me with a small Buddha-belly

that in my better moments I am proud of,
despite the fact that it's too adult for a indus
try that considers pre-pubescent and strung
out figures to be the epitome of beauty.
So my second reaction was anger. Who
was Ford, anyhow, to tell me I'm too fat?
They are the ones forcing their sick ideals on
the females of America, making us psycho
logically for some unrealistic notion of thin.
I can't say I've ever had a close girlfriend
who was entirely contented with her body
size, and the evil modeling agencies of the
world ought to be to blame.
But in my more reflective moments, I
confess: I am equally the perpetrator as the
victim. It's a free economy, and I've been
known to buy fashion magazines with Kate
Moss on the cover and watch supermodels
prance around on TV.
So to change the world we must begin
with ourselves. Because I no longer have the
excuse that I should be concerned about
how my body size could be inversely pro
portionate to my salary, I now have to take
responsibility for my own body image.
And I'm determined not to follow in the
footsteps of grandma. If the body can in
some way represent truths of the spirit (as
the renaissance painters believed), then I
will strive for the virtues of strength, integri
ty and wisdom. The things which ripen with
age and truly bring joy to the soul.
And who cares what virtue looks like in a
swimsuit.
