Bad lighting and little park
ing create unsafe campus
As a former resident of Storey and a cur
rent resident of Governor's Corner, 1 read
with great interest the Daily's article
addressing the dismal student parking situa
tion on campus. For the past three years I
have witnessed the disturbing University
trend of not only adding additional resi
dences, but also of transforming student lots
into "A" permit or shared areas.
Because of this shortage of spaces locat
ed near residences, students all over campus
are being forced to walk long distances to
and from their vehicles. Walks through
poorly lit areas and abandoned construction
sites are virtually unavoidable under the
current situation.
I was shocked by the comments of Julia
Fremon, the program manager of Trans
portation Programs, in Thursday's Daily.

Fremon claimed that "there has been no
evidence of any safety concerns" and insin
uated that because campus parking is shared
this situation is not problematic.
I wonder what Fremon and other admin
istrators consider legitimate reasons for con
cern? In the past three years there have
been two highly-publicized serial rapists in
the area. Just this year there have been sev
eral attempted abductions at the Stanford
Shopping Center. And let us not forget the
attack by a non-Stanford student in Casa
Zapata just last month. Students are afraid.
Will it take a mugging, kidnapping, rape or
even murder on the Stanford campus to
prompt the 'powers that be" to take action? Or
perhaps it will take a hefty lawsuit and negative
national publicity following a violent incident
for Stanford officials to address this problem.
The parking brochure says that permits
are hunting licenses, not guarantees. If Stan
ford is not willing to address students' con

cerns for safety by providing more foot
police, shuttle services, improved lighting
and closer parking, permits will no longer be
hunting licenses, but licenses to be hunted.

Band insulting to Irish
We are very appalled in this politically
correct age at your half time show at the
Stanford vs. Notre Dame football game.
Your show insulted all people of Irish
descent. Your mockery of the Irish plight was
tasteless and shocking coming from an insti
tution that prides itself on higher education.
Isn t is ironic that in a few weeks you will
be having diversity day at your game? Who
else are you going to slam? Wake up and
smell the Irish coffee!
