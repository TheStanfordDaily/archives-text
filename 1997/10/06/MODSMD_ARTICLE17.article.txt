# Garry Grundy: Anything for the kids
## A
						new Big Game tradition 
### 
I COULD FRANKLY care less if we
have a Big Game bonfire in Lake Lagu
nita or not. It's not ecologically feasible.
Closed book. Suck it up.
However, that doesn't altogether rule out
us having a bonfire.
Word on the street has it that Dean of
Students Marc Wais' office, the Axe Com
mittee and those repulsive resume-packers
that comprise the ASSU have proposed that
we start a new Big Game tradition.
For the first time, 1 am in accord.
I suggest that we indoctrinate a tradition
that will allow all those that follow this illus
trious class of 1998 to bristle with pride; a
tradition that will demonstrate creativity,
passion and a unified sense of school spirit.
Some say that a fire-works display is a
viable alternative... I think not.
A fireworks display would be Umj tame;
we need a tradition with teeth — one that
cries out for blood, mayhem and chaos; we

need a tradition that will bring the cameras
back to 'ITie Farm — not for one student,
but for all of Stanford's students, thus mak
ing news of the pandemonium that will
ensue from this new tradition.
I propose a bonfire at the Bookstore.
Just imagine it! That horrible institution
responsible for gobbling up all of your
money... sent crumbling to its knees; ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.
Requiem in Pacem.
Now at first glance, 1 know that this idea
seems a bit radical but it's exactly what this
campus needs to get the student momentum
rolling and to show the folks in the front
offices that we mean business: we want our
goddamn bonfire!
Permit me to explain why the bookstore
is more agreeable location than L ake Lag.
First and foremost, no one likes the
bookstore. It's invincible, it's a juggernaut,
and it's probably insured! You find a student

for me that defends the bookstore, and I'll
show you a BRIDGH case in waiting. No
one wants to hurt those defenseless, little
salamanders; we just want our bonfire.
Secondly, we, like the salamander, are also
defenseless... against that sucking sound we
are forced to endure every quarter Stanford
is in session. The bookstore has been allowed
to roam unchecked for t<x> long.
Hell, if it weren't for the honorable
Danny Bramzon and his SM( K kiddies, we
may not have had any defense against this
bestial Bookstore of ours.
Rumor has it that the bookstore is non
profit.
1 may be just a naive medievalist who's
only taken twoecon classes in his entiie life,
but I do know people don't woik foi notli
in'! We're not talking about Mother I hete
sa here or the Salvation Army. We're talk
ing about the Bookstore. (Key word: store.
That means "mone\ ") And someone's

making bank in the back office of the Stan
ford Bookstore; somebody's getting paid.
Nevertheless, SMOC is only part of the
solution. I 'he real solution begins with us...
some Physics 41 books, old CIV hooks,
some of that expensive gasoline off of Cam
pus Or. and a match. I hen let the winds of
freedom blow.
All right, 1 know that some of you may
have reservations about burning books and
all. I must confess, I do too. I hat is why,
before wo begin our brand new, annual tia
dition of the Bookstore bonfire, we shall
loot the bookstore thoroughly.
Picture it students of all taces and creeds
blacks, whites, gavs, Jews, atheists, vege
tarians all of us clinging to a chic new
Apple Powerbook, ( hem 31 books, and
Stanfoid mugs and sweatshirts. Such an
event that would send shock waves across
the country, as Stanford's diverse popula
tions rallv .is one.

After we have properly stripped the
bookstore of all its valuables, let the games
begin. On the lower level of the bookstore,
piled as high as nature will permit us, will be
all those books that they refused to buy back
this will certainly ensure that the height of
the fire is adequate.
And while the flames consume that
loathsome mammoth bookstore like noth
ing Dante could have fathomed, students
will sing and celebrate both an end and a
new beginning: the death of a monopoly and
the resurrection of a tradition.
Hut once the bookstore is gone, what will
we do next year? What will we burn for Big
(iaine 101 ?
l et's just hope that the Bursar's Office
doesn't give us any bright ideas.
