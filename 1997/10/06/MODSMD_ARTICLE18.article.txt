USC did manage to give the Cardinal (14-2, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) a heated battle for two
games. Game one was a seesaw battle that USC led
11-10. But Stanford rattled off four consecutive
points to force game point.
The Women of Troy (11-2, 4-2) fought back for
two points before senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl
made the kill to end the game 15-13.
Game two wasn't quite the contested battle that
games one and three proved to be. USC head coach
Lisa Love called it an aberration, but it was more like
a brutal beating.
The Trojans didn't manage a single point as the
Cardinal outhit USC .467 to minus-,231. USC only
scored four kills for the game, compared to 10 hitting
errors. On the other side of the net, Stanford t(X)k
advantage of eight of its 15 attacks while making
only one error.
In game three, USC returned to its tough defen
sive style and forced another tight game. USC led 8-
6, but Stanford overtook the Trojans 9-8 and never
trailed again. Folkl and senior middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika led the way for the Card with 14 and 11
kills, respectively.
Folkl's 14 kills moved her into fourth place on
Stanford's career kills list, one ahead of Teresa
