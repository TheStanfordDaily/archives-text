USC did manage to give the Cardinal (14-2, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) a heated battle for two
games. Game one was a seesaw battle that USC led
11-10. But Stanford rattled off four consecutive
points to force game point.
The Women of Troy (11-2, 4-2) fought back for
two points before senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl
made the kill to end the game 15-13.
Game two wasn't quite the contested battle that
games one and three proved to be. USC head coach
Lisa Love called it an aberration, but it was more like
a brutal beating.
The Trojans didn't manage a single point as the
Cardinal outhit USC .467 to minus-,231. USC only
scored four kills for the game, compared to 10 hitting
errors. On the other side of the net, Stanford t(X)k
advantage of eight of its 15 attacks while making
only one error.
In game three, USC returned to its tough defen
sive style and forced another tight game. USC led 8-
6, but Stanford overtook the Trojans 9-8 and never
trailed again. Folkl and senior middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika led the way for the Card with 14 and 11
kills, respectively.
Folkl's 14 kills moved her into fourth place on
Stanford's career kills list, one ahead of Teresa
Smith, who played from 1984-87.
Ifejika also had an amazing .588 hit
ting percentage.
After taking a break from action
Saturday, Stanford cruised into
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion yesterday
afternoon ready to complete the
sweep of the Los Angeles schools.
The big-blocking Bruins (6-5, 2-4)
were expected to make life difficult
for Stanford hitters, but in fact, it
was the Cardinal wall that put the
match out of reach, leading UCLA
in team blocks 12-3.

The score went back and forth in
game one, as the Bruins came out
with high intensity. UCLA even led
9-8, but Stanford turned things up a
notch and put away the game 15-10.
The Card didn't slow down in
game two and controlled the contest
with great defense. Play stalled
slightly for Stanford at 8-5, but the
Cardinal picked it up and quickly
took a two-game advantage 15-6.
In game three, Stanford made
the most of two scoring runs to close
out the match and complete the
weekend sweep. After a back and
forth start, the Cardinal ran out to a
four-point lead of 9-5.
UCLA fought back for two
unanswered points before Stanford

again jumped ahead 13-8. The Bru
ins pulled back to 13-10 before Stan
ford ended the match 15-10.
Sophomore outside hitter Kerri
Walsh led the offensive charge for
the Cardinal with 10 kills and a .348
hitting percentage. On the defensive
side, Walsh and senior middle
blocker Paula McNamee set the
pace with five and six blocks, respec
tively.
Senior setter Lisa Sharpley also
contributed 10 digs for a Stanford
defense that dominated UCLA,
holding the team to a .010 hitting
percentage and Bruins outside hit
ter Kara Milling to just 10 kills, five
below her average for a three
game match.
