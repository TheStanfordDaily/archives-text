■ SUNDAY'S RESULT:
Stanford 6, Colorado College (J

The Cardinal (4-5) is hoping that
with the overstated win — its biggest
since a b-0 win over Wyoming last
season — it has washed its hands of
a disastrous scoring drought that re
sulted in four consecutive losses.
The deluge couldn't have come

at a better time, with the team open
ing Pacific 10 Conference play next
weekend against USC and UCLA.
"We definitely needed some
thing like this right now," said senior
co-captain and midfielder Elie Fos
ter. "This will spark us up."
"I think it was a good win, coming
at the time it did," said head coach
Steve Swanson. "The timing made it
a significant win."
But Swanson stopped short of
proclaiming it the biggest victory of
the season.
"We've had other significant
wins, like at Clemson and Texas," he
said. "Anytime you win, it's big. But
this game was good because we were
more focused. We showed that we
were prepared mentally."
The Cardinal's aggressive attack
generated 20 shots and allowed five
different players to score during the
game, four within the last 15 min
utes. On the other hand, the Tigers
(7-4-2) could come up with just two
shots, both of which freshman goal
keeper Carlv Smolak handled easily
in her first start.
Stanford came out of the gate on
fire, but Colorado College's defense
kept the game close. The Cardinal's
only score in the first half came when
junior forward Tracye Lawyer head
ed the ball into the center of the box
in front of the goal, where it found
senior Emily Burt's foot. Before the
ball even hit the ground, the mid
fielder had looped it over the
goalie's head and into the upper left
corner of the goal.
The score was the Card's first in
two weeks. It was also the first time
the Cardinal had led in a game since
Sept. 12. The raucous celebration
that followed was indicative of the
monkey that had just been shaken
off the team's back.

Early in the second half, the
Tigers came as close to scoring as
they would all day when a Colorado
College defender launched a shot
from midfield that barely missed the
goal on the fly, a fluke play that near
ly tied the score.
But despite offensive impotency,
Colorado College still pestered the
Cardinal on the other end of the
field, allowing only one more goal —
a short slap by Lawyer in the 57th
minute — until the last 13 minutes
of the game.
Then, as if cosmically driven,
Stanford scored four quick goals in
succession that left the team with a
resounding victory.
Freshman forward Karen Brett
started the downpour with 12 min
utes, 43 seconds left, slapping a long
shot from 20 yards out to make the
score 3-0.
Freshman midfielder Katherine
Horney then dribbled the ball into
the goal past Tiger goalie Robyn Bil
ski for a 4-0 lead. Brett scored again
two minutes later to make the score
5-0, and it only took another four
minutes for the Card capped the vic
tory on a goal by freshman midfield

er Celina DeLeon with 1:42 on the
clock.
"The [scoring] drought was really
hard to play through," Foster said.
"This is exactly what we needed."
Despite the contrast between
yesterday's result and the recent
losses, Swanson said that his team
did nothing differently.
"When the game started out and
we went into halftime 1-0, this game
resembled 95 percent of our other
games," he said. "Sometimes you
lose yourself in the end result of
games. This time, we happened to
end up ahead. But we've played
strong soccer throughout the last
month."
Foster agreed that the team dif
fered only in intangibles.
"We had a great week of practice,
and that helped our confidence," she
said. "But the big difference was that
we came out pissed. We were there
to compete instead of just play."
The Cardinal hopes to carry the
scoring frenzy into next weekend,
when Pac-10 play begins. The Cardi
nal faces USC in Friday's opener at
New Maloney, then finishes Sunday
against UCLA.
