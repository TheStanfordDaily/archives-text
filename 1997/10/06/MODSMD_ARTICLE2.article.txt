# Psychiatry prof sues Stanford over grant
## Pfefferbaum alleges plagiarism, theft of idea 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum has
taken the offensive in his battle with the Uni
versity once again by filing a lawsuit accusing
Stanford of fraud and theft of intellectual
property.
This is the third lawsuit Pfefferbaum has
filed since March 1996 when he first com
plained about conditions at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Hospital, where he was em
ployed in conjunction with his Stanford pro
fessorship. The case has achieved national
prominence, including an article in this
week's Science magazine.
Pfefferbaum resigned from his position at
the VA hospital but maintains that he never
intended to resign from his Stanford profes
sorship. In August 1996, the University told
Pfefferbaum it no longer considered him a
professor.

In addition to the current lawsuit, filed
Aug. 29 in the Santa Clara County Superior
Court, Pfefferbaum and Psychiatry Prof.
Brant Wenegrat filed a lawsuit in July 19%
accusing the University of a breach of con
tract in denying professors their rights in fil
ing grievances. Earlier this year, Pfeffer
baum filed a writ of mandamus action, which
resulted in Santa Clara County Judge Peter
Stone ordering that he be reinstated to his
position as a full professor with all benefits of
that position until the University Advisory
Board hears his case.
That hearing should come later this quar
ter, said Advisory Board Chair Brad Efron, a
statistics professor. An independent hear
ings officer, UC-San Francisco Law Prof.
Richard Marcus, has been hired to examine
facts disputed by the two sides. When Mar
cus completes his report, the Advisory
Hoard will hold a public hearing.
Efron said.
Pfefferbaum's latest lawsuit
lists eight complaints against the
University. In addition to Stanford
itself. University President Ger
hard ( asper. Provost Condoleezza
Rice, Medical School Dean Eu
gene Bauer, Psychiatry Depart
ment ( hair Alan Schatzberg, Psy
chiatry Prof. Jerome Yesavage,
Medical School Senior Assoc.
Dean for Academic Affairs
Richard Popp and 20 unnamed in
dividuals are listed as defendants.
Medical School spokeswoman
Laurel Joyce said she couldn't
comment on pending litigation.
University Communications Di
rector Terry Shepard directed all
inquiries to Joyce.
The complaints range from
theft of intellectual property to un
fair competition to negligent mis
representation and center on the
University's attempt to submit a
grant application to the National
Institutes of Health for continued
funding of the Mental Health Clin

ical Research Center, which Pfef
ferbaum has directed for 10 years
and which does nationally recog
nized work on schizophrenia.
Recipients of grants must sub
mit a progress report each year,
but as the University no longer
considered Pfefferbaum to be its
employee, it needed a new princi
pal investigator. Stanford chose
Psychiatry Prof. Jerome Yesavage,
who subsequently was rejected by
the National Institute of Mental
Health, which administers the
nearly $1 ,(MM),()()()-per-year grant.
The reason given for rejection was
that Yesavage did not have a back
ground in schizophrenia research.
Pfefferbaum, who is now con
ducting research at SRI Interna
tional in Menlo Park, had agreed
to be listed as a collaborator on Ihe
project instead of principal investi
gator.
Psychiatry Prof. F.dith Sullivan,
who works closely with Pfeffer
baum, said that after having cho
sen Yesavage, who also runs the
Aging Clinical Research Center
that does work on Alzheimer's dis
ease, "I don't think they thought
he was going to be rejected."
The University's next step was

to change the proposed budget —
directing more than half of the
money to Yesavage'scenter — and
submit the application under
Yesavage's name with no refer
ence to Pfefferbaum at all, Sullivan
said.
[hat, she said, "was an enor
mous change that [Pfefferbaum]
had not agreed to."
Pfefferbaum claims in his law
suit that Stanford's actions in ef
fect represented theft of his idea
for a clinical research center. " The
intellectual design and content of
the center's advanced research
program and the grant applica
tions submitted to the National In
stitute of Mental Health for fund
ing of the center were and are the
intellectual work products" of Pf
efferbaum, the complaint reads.
As a result, the complaint con
tinues, Pfefferbaum's "academic
work products have been plagia
rized and stolen by defendants; it is
highly likely the center will cease
operations entirely and pass out of
existence when this year's. . .
funding expires."
The closing of the center could
affect close to 50 faculty members
and researchers, Sullivan said.
