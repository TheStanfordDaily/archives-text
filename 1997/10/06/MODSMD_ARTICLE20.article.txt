### Dave Hemming Contributing writer 
Notre Dame may have the greater football tradition
and boast more All-Amerieans and national champi
onships in its storied football past, and the Fighting Irish
may have a superior national reputation.
But in 1997, Stanford has a better team.
Saturday, the 16th-ranked Cardinal used a crushing
running attack and an inspired second-half defensive
performance to blow Notre Dame out of Stanford Sta
dium 33-15 in front of 75,651, the largest crowd at Stan
ford since 1993.

It was the ninth win in 10 games dating back to last
year for Stanford (4-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Conference), while
the Fighting Irish (1-4) lost their fourth straight, their
longest single-season losing streak since 1963.
Senior running backs Anthony Bookman and Mike
Mitchell each ran for more than 100 yards for the third
consecutive game, a Stanford record.
In all, Stanford totaled 322 yards on the ground, its
biggest rushing day since 1984. In 52 attempts, the Car
dinal never had a negative run.
The win is a big one for Stanford for many reasons,
none bigger than the gain in national attention which
comes from beating such a high-profile team.
The win "moves us closer to our goal, which is to play
a 12th game," said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham.
The Cardinal put the game out of reach after an Irish
touchdown by receiver Bobby Brown made the score
24-15 with 10 minutes, 57 seconds left.
Stanford got the ball back at its own 26-yard line and
marched 74 yards down the field in 16 plays, consuming
7:42. The drive, which consisted entirely of running
plays, was finished by a four-yard touchdown run by
Bookman that made it 31-15 and ended Notre Dame's
chances.
It was the second straight possession the Cardinal fin
ished in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Stan
ford regained possession on its 27 with 1413 left after a
missed Irish field goal, and Bookman took over.
The senior, who finished the day with 142 yards on 14
carries, needed just two rushes to take Stanford 73 yards

down the field. The second was a 58-yard touchdown
sprint in which Bookman burst through the line and left
the Notre Dame secondary in his tracks, giving the Car
dinal a 24- 1 ) lead. Bookman has had touchdown runs ot
60,66 and 58 yards in the last three games.
"We wore down and eventually caved in," said Notre
Dame head coach Bob Davie.

The phenomenal rushing success allowed Stanford to
control the ball for 36:32 and rack up 34 first downs, the
most ever allowed by an Irish team.
Sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson had an
other fine performance, completing 2b of 38 passes foi
192 yards and making sound deci
sions all game. The line also gave
him time to throw, allowing only
one sack.
"We were just able to do so
many things," Hutchinson said.
Notre Dame struck first in the
game on a 45-yard field goal that
capped an impressive 15-play
drive.
But the Cardinal answered on
its next possession. Mitchell, who
had 135 yards on a career-high 29
carries, led a 61-yard drive with
five carries for 43 yards, including
a 15-yard scoring scamper.
Stanford did not score again
until Kevin Miller's 37-yard field
goal gave the Cardinal a 10-9 lead
with just 18 seconds to go in the
first half.
Miller barely missed a 43-yard
attempt with no time left in the
half after Irish quarterback Ron
Powlus fumbled on the Notre
Dame 26 and redshirt freshman
tackle Willie Howard recovered
with six seconds to go.
Powlus became Notre Dame's
career leader in completions and
yards passing on Saturday, passing
former Irish quarterback Steve
Beuerlein. But it didn't matter in a

second half dominated by Stan
ford.
After two possessions by each
team failed to produce any points,
the Cardinal broke the game open
with an 87-yard, 17-play drive that
ended in Mitchell's second touch
down of the game, a 3-yard run off
tackle that pushed the lead to 17-9.
Stanford's defense was shaky in
the first half, allowing 201 yards
and 13 Irish first downs. But in the
second half, it limited Notre Dame
to just 97 yards and five first
downs.
This game "built our confi
dence again and showed that we
can be a defense that's tough," said
senior defensive end Kailee
Wong. Wong put constant pres
sure on Powlus and registered a
late-game safety for the second
week in a row.
Notre Dame had only three
yards rushing in the second half
against the much stingier Cardinal
run defense. Tailback Autry Den
son, who burned Stanford for 116
rushing yards in the first half, got
only 10 on six carries in the second.
For its effort, the Cardinal beat
Notre Dame for the first time at
home since 1963 and for only the
fourth time in 12 meetings.
"Just playing Notre Dame and
beating them by any margin is
quite a feat," Hutchinson said.


The Stanford Band celebrates with a packed student section after a Cardinal touchdown. Though most of the 75,651 fans at Stanford Sta
dium remained relatively quiet throughout the game, students constantly filled the air with chants of "overrated," "warm up the bus" and
"where is Rudy?"

sprint in which Bookman burst through the line and left
the Notre Dame secondary in his tracks, giving the Car
dinal a 24- 1 ) lead. Bookman has had touchdown runs ot
60,66 and 58 yards in the last three games.
"We wore down and eventually caved in," said Notre
Dame head coach Bob Davie.

The phenomenal rushing success allowed Stanford to
control the ball for 36:32 and rack up 34 first downs, the
most ever allowed by an Irish team.
Sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson had an
other fine performance, completing 2b of 38 passes foi
192 yards and making sound deci
sions all game. The line also gave
him time to throw, allowing only
one sack.
"We were just able to do so
many things," Hutchinson said.
Notre Dame struck first in the
game on a 45-yard field goal that
capped an impressive 15-play
drive.
But the Cardinal answered on
its next possession. Mitchell, who
had 135 yards on a career-high 29
carries, led a 61-yard drive with
five carries for 43 yards, including
a 15-yard scoring scamper.
Stanford did not score again
until Kevin Miller's 37-yard field
goal gave the Cardinal a 10-9 lead
with just 18 seconds to go in the
first half.
Miller barely missed a 43-yard
attempt with no time left in the
half after Irish quarterback Ron
Powlus fumbled on the Notre
Dame 26 and redshirt freshman
tackle Willie Howard recovered
with six seconds to go.
Powlus became Notre Dame's
career leader in completions and
yards passing on Saturday, passing
former Irish quarterback Steve
Beuerlein. But it didn't matter in a

second half dominated by Stan
ford.
After two possessions by each
team failed to produce any points,
the Cardinal broke the game open
with an 87-yard, 17-play drive that
ended in Mitchell's second touch
down of the game, a 3-yard run off
tackle that pushed the lead to 17-9.
Stanford's defense was shaky in
the first half, allowing 201 yards
and 13 Irish first downs. But in the
second half, it limited Notre Dame
to just 97 yards and five first
downs.
This game "built our confi
dence again and showed that we
can be a defense that's tough," said
senior defensive end Kailee
Wong. Wong put constant pres
sure on Powlus and registered a
late-game safety for the second
week in a row.
Notre Dame had only three
yards rushing in the second half
against the much stingier Cardinal
run defense. Tailback Autry Den
son, who burned Stanford for 116
rushing yards in the first half, got
only 10 on six carries in the second.
For its effort, the Cardinal beat
Notre Dame for the first time at
home since 1963 and for only the
fourth time in 12 meetings.
"Just playing Notre Dame and
beating them by any margin is
quite a feat," Hutchinson said.


The Stanford Band celebrates with a packed student section after a Cardinal touchdown. Though most of the 75,651 fans at Stanford Sta
dium remained relatively quiet throughout the game, students constantly filled the air with chants of "overrated," "warm up the bus" and
"where is Rudy?"
