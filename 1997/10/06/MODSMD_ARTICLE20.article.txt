### Dave Hemming Contributing writer 
Notre Dame may have the greater football tradition
and boast more All-Amerieans and national champi
onships in its storied football past, and the Fighting Irish
may have a superior national reputation.
But in 1997, Stanford has a better team.
Saturday, the 16th-ranked Cardinal used a crushing
running attack and an inspired second-half defensive
performance to blow Notre Dame out of Stanford Sta
dium 33-15 in front of 75,651, the largest crowd at Stan
ford since 1993.

â–  SATURDAY S RESULT: Stanford 33
Notre Dame 15

It was the ninth win in 10 games dating back to last
year for Stanford (4-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Conference), while
the Fighting Irish (1-4) lost their fourth straight, their
longest single-season losing streak since 1963.
Senior running backs Anthony Bookman and Mike
Mitchell each ran for more than 100 yards for the third
consecutive game, a Stanford record.
In all, Stanford totaled 322 yards on the ground, its
biggest rushing day since 1984. In 52 attempts, the Car
dinal never had a negative run.
The win is a big one for Stanford for many reasons,
none bigger than the gain in national attention which
comes from beating such a high-profile team.
The win "moves us closer to our goal, which is to play
a 12th game," said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham.
The Cardinal put the game out of reach after an Irish
touchdown by receiver Bobby Brown made the score
24-15 with 10 minutes, 57 seconds left.
Stanford got the ball back at its own 26-yard line and
marched 74 yards down the field in 16 plays, consuming
7:42. The drive, which consisted entirely of running
plays, was finished by a four-yard touchdown run by
Bookman that made it 31-15 and ended Notre Dame's
chances.
It was the second straight possession the Cardinal fin
ished in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Stan
ford regained possession on its 27 with 1413 left after a
missed Irish field goal, and Bookman took over.
The senior, who finished the day with 142 yards on 14
carries, needed just two rushes to take Stanford 73 yards

down the field. The second was a 58-yard touchdown
sprint in which Bookman burst through the line and left
the Notre Dame secondary in his tracks, giving the Car
dinal a 24- 1 ) lead. Bookman has had touchdown runs ot
60,66 and 58 yards in the last three games.
"We wore down and eventually caved in," said Notre
Dame head coach Bob Davie.

The phenomenal rushing success allowed Stanford to
control the ball for 36:32 and rack up 34 first downs, the
most ever allowed by an Irish team.
Sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson had an
other fine performance, completing 2b of 38 passes foi
