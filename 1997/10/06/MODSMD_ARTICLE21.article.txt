# Offensive line finds redemption

What has six parts, is tough
as nails and weighs more than
1,5(H) pounds?
Answer: The Stanford loot
ball team's offensive line.
Stanford's 33-15 pasting of
Notre Dame will probably be
remembered by the perfor
manees of Anthony Bookman
and Mike Mitehell, who both
ran for more than 1 (X) yards for
the third eonseeutive game.
What might get lost in the shuf
fle is the way the once-ma
ligned Cardinal offensive line
opened the door for them.
"Some things you really
don't need a coach to de
scribe," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "I
think if you looked out there
and saw our team run the foot
ball, I think that says it all.
That's your offensive line
working."

Senior tailback Anthony Bookman slices through the Notre Dame de
fense. Bookman finished with 142 yards on 14 carries.
the season, the unit as a whole constituted a
major team concern.
It didn't help when offensive tackles Jeff
Cronshagen, a junior, and Brian Donoghue,
a senior, went down with injuries. In its first
three games, the line surrendered 15 sacks.
But something clicked against Oregon.
Hutchinson had plenty of time to throw,
burning the Ducks for 340 yards, while
Bookman and Mitchell combined for 259.
That may have been the offensive line's
coming-out parly, but Saturday's victory
showcased its versatility and proved that its
improved play is very much for real.
Junior Mike McLaughlin, a starter at cen
ter for the last 16 games, moved to left guard
to replace senior Andrew Kroeker, who was
suspended for the first half.
Senior Blaine Maxfield made his debut in
the starting lineup by filling in at center,
while junior Joe Fairchild once again moved
into Cronshagen's spot at left tackle.
Despite the changes, the Cardinal offen
sive line dominated Notre Dame's defensive
front, allowing Hutchinson to complete 26 of
38 passes and giving the Cardinal backs plen
ty of room to run when it counted most.

On Stanford's first touchdown drive, the
Card faced a third-and-2 from the Notre
Dame 25. The offensive line surged ahead,
and Mitchell muscled his way for 5 yards and
a crucial first down.
"The holes were so huge, it was easy to
run," Mitchell said. "Early in the season (the
offensive linemen were) getting ridiculed
and looked down upon. But they looked
deep down inside and worked really hard in
practice to put everything together, and it has
been showing in the last couple of weeks.
"I don't think that many teams have run
as well against Notre Dame as we did, and I
think that was something that the offensive
line definitely keyed."
On the Cardinal's second touchdown
drive early in the third quarter, Stanford
once again faced a third-and-2 from the
Notre Dame 25. This time, the line sprung
Mitchell for a 10-yard gain.
Bookman was also the beneficiary of ex
cellent play from the offensive line. At 5-
foot-8, Bookman is most effective when he
has room to utilize his exceptional speed.
The line gave him plenty of space, and Book
man burned the Irish on a 58-yard touch
down run that highlighted a 124-yard second
half rushing performance.
"The offensive line did a great job,"
Bookman said. "It was because of them that
we were able to make those runs."
