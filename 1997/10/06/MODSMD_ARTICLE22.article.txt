hands of a better team.

day in a tense game that went into
double overtime.

MEN'S SOCCER

■ FRIDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 3,
Harvard 0
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT:
Stanford 0, Dartmouth 0

"II there was one game I could ac
cept a tie in," said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark, "it was this one."
Stanford had topped I larvard 3-0
Friday afternoon in its first match of
the tournament.

Dartmouth beat California, the
fourth team playing at the Invitation
al, 2-1 on Friday. Yesterday morning,
California routed I larvard 5-0.
No. 22 Dartmouth (4-1-2) gave
the No. 11 Cardinal (0-0-1) its tough
est lest yet this season. The Big
Cireen put the pressure on early,
dominating much of the tiisi half.
After half an hour, Stanford brought
in freshman forward Corey Wool
folk and junior forward A.I Saner
and lought back.

From that point on, the game be
came a match of physical fitness and
fierceness, and the Cardinal began
to take charge. In overtime, Stan
fordclcarly dominated, although the
Cardinal failed to connect on a goal.
C'lark, playing against his l< >i mer
team, was happy with how Stanfoid
stood up for the entire 120 minutes.
"We never lost out discipline," he
said. "You can't ask for more than
that."
