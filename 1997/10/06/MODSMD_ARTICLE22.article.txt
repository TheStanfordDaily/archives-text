"II there was one game I could ac
cept a tie in," said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark, "it was this one."
Stanford had topped I larvard 3-0
Friday afternoon in its first match of
the tournament.

Dartmouth beat California, the
fourth team playing at the Invitation
al, 2-1 on Friday. Yesterday morning,
California routed I larvard 5-0.
No. 22 Dartmouth (4-1-2) gave
the No. 11 Cardinal (0-0-1) its tough
est lest yet this season. The Big
Cireen put the pressure on early,
dominating much of the tiisi half.
After half an hour, Stanford brought
in freshman forward Corey Wool
folk and junior forward A.I Saner
and lought back.

From that point on, the game be
came a match of physical fitness and
fierceness, and the Cardinal began
to take charge. In overtime, Stan
fordclcarly dominated, although the
Cardinal failed to connect on a goal.
C'lark, playing against his l< >i mer
team, was happy with how Stanfoid
stood up for the entire 120 minutes.
"We never lost out discipline," he
said. "You can't ask for more than
that."

Senior forward Emily Burt fends off a Colorado College defender in
the Cardinal's 6-0 win Sunday.
The Cardinal, Clark said, was
"the team that obviously was trying
to win," and it almost did. The ball
hit the back of the net once during
overtime, but the goal was discount
ed because of a foul.
Despite an angry response from
the crowd, Clark wouldn't dispute
the referee's ruling.
"That's life," he said. "There's
nothing we can do about it."
Although Stanford is ranked a
solid 11 notches above Dartmouth,
the teams play a very similar game,
making it harder for the Cardinal to
make its mark with a distinctive style.
Clark was Dartmouth's head
coach from 1985-94 and remains
good friends with current Big Green
coach Eran O'Leary. O'Leary has
watched the Cardinal train and
"knows us inside out," Clark said.
In preparing for yesterday's
game, he said, the players talked
about "how we would play against
ourselves."
The tactic worked well but not
quite well enough. The Cardinal's
14-game winning streak has become
a 15-game unbeaten streak spanning
two seasons. This year's record, now
9-0-1, remains free of a loss.
Game 14 in the streak came easi
ly enough in Friday's match against
unranked Harvard (2-4-2).
The Cardinal didn't play its
cleanest game of the season but still
had no trouble proving itself domi
nant. Harvard notched 11 shots on
goal to Stanford's nine, but that
made no difference in the end.
Stanford earned all three goals in
the first half of the match against the
Crimson, then relaxed during the
second half. Senior midfielder Erik
Morrison started the barrage with
an unassisted shot at 13 minutes, 46

seconds.
The next two goals came in quick
succession, as junior midfielder
Aaron Jones assisted on a goal by
Sauer, the Cardinal's leading scorer.
Three minutes later, Woolfolk ac
cepted the ball from junior midfield
er Simon Elliott and knocked it in to
make the score 3-0.
NOTES: Dartmouth couldn't top
Stanford yesterday, but the Big

Green alumni camc away with a 2-1
victory over the Cardinal alumni
earlier in the morning.
Scoring the winning goal for
Dartmouth was 1993 graduate Ge
offrey Wheeler — now Stanford's
assistant coach
Stanford returns to Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation play next
weekend with games at Washington
and Oregon State.
