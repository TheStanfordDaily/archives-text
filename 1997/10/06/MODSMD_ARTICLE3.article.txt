Although recent figures suggest the Coffee
House has been losing revenue at lunchtime,
Bon Appetit, its parent company, is optimistic
about the future of the longtime campus hang
out.
Bon Appetit district manager Mary Clark
said that sales are down 40 percent during a
two-hour period around lunch, but sales at
other times have remained constant.
Despite the lower midday numbers, Clark,
remains upbeat. "There was an article a while

back that said that 'the Coffee House reigns.'
I think it always will."
Clark's faith rests on the character and his
tory of the Coffee House. Though Hon Ap
pctit's relationship with the Coffee House
only goes back to 1989 when the catering and
dining service came to campus, the Coffee
1 louse itself has been in existence for 25 years.
According to Clark, the Coffee House
began as a much smaller-scale establishment
that was chiefly a place at which student poets
could come and have a forum to
voice their words.
Clark insists that keeping the
grassroots, student-based atmos
phere of the Coffee House remains
a goal.
"Our Coffee House has always
been student run," she said.
In addition to remodeling sched
uled to take place next summer,
Clark and the Coffee House's new
managerial team, graduate student
Charles Turner and Rebecca
Gould, H >7, have planned to meet
regularly with students to get a bet
ter feel for the types of improve

ments the student body would like
to see. Last week 30 students par
ticipated in such a meeting.
Other marketing strategies
aimed at keeping the Coffee I louse
competitive include extended
hours, a new menu that will include
pizza, and events such as this past
weekend's promotion-filled 25th
anniversary celebration.
Hon Appetit also submitted a
proposal for a kiosk between
Green and Meyer libraries, but
feet's Coffee received the nod in
stead.
Though Clark admits the ar
rival of Peel's will have an impact
on Coffee House sales, she said
that "there's always room for good
coffee."

She cited a two-and-a-half year
old student taste test in which Java
City, the brand served in the Coffee
House, came out on top over Peet's.
Whether or not the Coffee
House will be able to compete as it
has in the past in a market that con
tinues to grow and diversify itself
remains to be seen. Closing the
Coffee House's doors is not an op
tion, according to Clark.
"We're not going to let that hap
pen," she said. "We're going to suc
ceed. Our passion is the students
and providing the best deli sand
wiches and providing a place for
students to meet... .Some things
will be temporary; they'll come and
go. Hut I think that [the Coffee
I louse] is here to stay."
