# Loans on line
## Recipients laud revamped aid procedure 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Life has been a bit easier for students receiving fi
nancial aid this year thanks to a little help from mod
ern technology.
Two weeks ago the Financial Aids Office began
operation of a new phone voice response system that
gives students the status of their financial aid appli
cation. If the application is incomplete, it tells the stu
dent what information is missing. If the application is
complete and its processing is done, it says how much
money the student will receive.
The system was introduced to the office by Com
munication Services. According to Director of Stu
dent Awards Cynthia Rife, the office is serving as a
"guinea pig" for the technology.
More improvements lie in the future for the Fi
nancial Aids Office. By winter quarter, the office
hopes it will be able to disperse Stafford loans elec
tronically and automatically credit them to students'
accounts.
These improvements come after a year when the
office struggled to adapt to a new computer system.
Last year was a difficult year for students, Rife
said. Students had to wait in long lines, aid often
would not arrive on time and information about the
status of loans was not easily accessible, she ex
plained.
"I always dreaded standing in the loan lines,"
sophomore Brian Schmidt said. With the new tech
nology, he expects there will be less hassle.
"All steps of making the process easier is a good
thing," sophomore Lindsay Amstutz said.
The new phone system, though, has not been free
of its own complaints. "You can be on an hour before
you talk to a human being," Schmidt said. "Serious
questions are not something a computer can answer."
Senior Giathang Dao echoed
(hose sentiments. "There are
times when you do need someone
to speak to," he said.
According to Rife, even
though the new system has had
some problems, the year has been
and will continue to be much bet
ter for students receiving finan
cial aid.
