Become a Truman Scholar
l T
Harry S. Truman Scholarships, which honor the thirty-third President of the
United States, are awarded on the basis of merit to students who are juniors in 1997-98
and who have compiled excellent academic records and demonstrated outstanding
potential for leadership in public service. The Foundation defines "public service" as
employment in government, public interest organizations, research and/or educational
organizations, and public service non-profit organizations such as those whose primary
aim is to help needy or disadvantaged persons or to protect the environment. Each of
the approximately 75 Truman Scholarships to be awarded in 1998 covers expenses
during the senior undergraduate year and two or three years of graduate study up to a
total of $30,000.
