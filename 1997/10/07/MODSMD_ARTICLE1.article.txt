# Groups make plans for new special fees
## KZSU, SCBN, MEChA boost programming with new cash 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
Several groups that did not enjoy special fee funding
last year won student body funds this year and have a
variety of plans for their expanded budgets.
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio station, re
ceived a large increase. This year the station garnered
$40,000, whereas last year it received none. According
to station manager Darell Tibbies, a senior, most of this
money will go toward special programs and program
ming that typical radio stations usually do not offer.
KZSU will offer radio broadcast training, expanded
sports coverage and community-oriented programs.
"We are responsible for the sole radio training pro
gram on campus," said Tibbies. "KZSU will continue
to keep alive old programs with the new funding and
bring the best in news and sports to the public."
SCBN, Stanford's student television network, which
also received no money last year, was allocated $36,000
this year. They plan to replace deteriorating equipment
and expand their operations to include new programs.
Some of the new equipment to be purchased are
new cameras. SCBN in the past had only one, and could
only film one event at a time, according to station man
ager Tudor Havriliuc, a senior.
"More cameras will enable us to meet the needs of
students," said Havriliuc. "We can now film popular
events such as Taiko or whatever is requested."
SCBN will also use funds for a relatively new pro
gram titled "The Call-In Show," aired every Saturday
night. They will build a "more professional-looking
set" according to Havriliuc and improve the quality of
guests.
Cultural groups also received significantly more
funding from last year. MEChA, a Latino/ Chicano
student group, which did not receive anything the pre
vious year, received about $25,000 this year.
Genevieve Aguilar, a MEChA liaison, said, "we
could have received funding last year, but we were on
the ballot for graduate students. This year we were on
for just undergraduates and succeeded."
Starting two years ago, student groups have been
able to apply for funding from the student population
that they serve — undergraduate, graduate or both. In
the first year of the reform, many groups applying to
both populations failed when not enough graduate stu
dents approved their fees.
This year's MEChA funds will go to a forum on po
litical issues, which will bring in prominent outside
speakers. One of the issues that the club intends to de
bate is a proposition coming out in June that will at
tempt to eliminate bilingual education.
