# American wins Nobel prize

(AF) — An American won the Nobel Prize in
medicine yesterday for discovering a startling new type
of germ: a Jekyll-and-Hyde protein that causes mad
cow disease and other deadly brain-destroying illnesses.
The prize, worth $l million this year, went to Dr.
Stanley B. Prusiner, 55, a biochemistry professor at the
UC-San Francisco. The announcement was made by
the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which awards
the prize.
Prusiner was cited for his 1982 discovery of prions.
These insidious proteins are considered an entirely new
type of disease-causing agent, distinct from bacteria,
viruses, fungi or parasites.
The finding was controversial — and still is
because prions, unlike other germs, contain no genetic

material; they are simply proteins.
The human diseases caused by prions are rare. Hut
scientists said Prusiner's work might help researchers
understand more common brain disorders like
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Prions have been in the news lately because they are
blamed for a variant of the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease that has killed at least 20 people, mostly
in Britain. I*he victims are thought to have gotten the
prions by eating products made from cattle with mad
cow disease.
Prusiner began his work in 1972, when as a medical
resident he had a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis
ease, or C'JD. At the time, the cause of C'JD was a mys
tery.
