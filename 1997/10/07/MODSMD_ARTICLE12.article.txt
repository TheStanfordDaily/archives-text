# Decades-old spy ring stopped
## Trio sold classified documents to East Germany 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — Claiming to have cracked
a spy ring that went undetected for two decades, the
FBI leveled espionage charges yesterday against a Pen
tagon analyst, her husband and another man. Investi
gators said the analyst bragged to an undercover agent
how easy it was to steal secrets.
Recruited by East Germany during their student
days at the University of Wisconsin in the early and
mid-19705, the three trained for years in the ways of
Soviet spy craft, sought positions in and around gov
ernment and used the access they gained to steal classi
fied documents, the government alleged.
When the Cold War ended, the husband-wife team
and the third person, an expert in Slavic languages,
sought new opportunities spying for South Africa,
according to the allegations.
Theresa Squillacote is quoted in the allegations as
exclaiming in joy after making contact last year with a
man she thought was a South African official.
In a brief appearance in federal court in Alexandria,
Va., yesterday, Squillacote, 39, the former Defense
Department analyst; her husband, Kurt Alan Stand, 42,
a labor union representative, and James Clark, a pri
vate detective, were charged with attempted espionage
and conspiracy to commit espionage. The latter crime

carries a maximum life in prison and $25(),(HK) fine.
Stand and Squillacote were arrested after they were
lured to a hotel in Arlington, Va„ Saturday for what
they thought was a meeting with one of their South
African contacts. Clark was arrested Saturday at his
Falls Church, Va., home, the FBI said.
The investigation was aided by a wealth of intelli
gence collected by electronic interceptions, interviews
with former East German agents and highly sensitive
East German intelligence records — including "true
name cards" that identify agents working in the United
States.
"When the Berlin Wall came down in October IWO,
Kurt Stand, Terry Squillacote and Jim Clark did not
surrender or lay down their U>ols of their espionage
trade," said Thomas J. Pickard, assistant director of the
FBl's Washington field office.
Stopping short of charging the trio with actual espi
onage is standard FBI practice, because of the difficul
ty of proving in court actual spying. Nevertheless, a 200
page affidavit filed by Special Agent Katharine (i. Alle
man makes clear that the government believes the
three gave secrets to East Germany. From there, the
stolen information almost certainly would have gone to
the Soviet K( iB.
