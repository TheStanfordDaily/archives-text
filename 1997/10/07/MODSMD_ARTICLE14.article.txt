## Editorial Caveat emptor The 						Bookstore committee 
### 
AH, THE DECADE of peacemak
ing! Ancient enemies from the
Middle East have shaken hands
over a pcace accord. The Iron Curtain has
fallen.
Now, as if to complete this surge in new
found harmony between legendary foes,
the Stanford Bookstore and the ASSU are
working together to form an advisory
board to improve the Bookstore's services.
While any attempt at resolving the
eternal tensions between the Bookstore
and its customers is admirable, it is wise to
moderate enthusiasm about this latest
development.
This shift in strategy for campus
activists is a notable change that represents
a movement from trust-busting to over
sight, and it has potential drawbacks.
Analyzing basic reasons for students'
frequent discontent with the Bookstore is
not an exceedingly complex task. There is
a very commonly held belief, supported by
materials in Econ l, that monopolies
charge higher prices.
The Bookstore, which also owns
Tresidder Express and the Track House, is
perceived as a campus monopoly. Coinci
dentally (or perhaps not at all so), the
prices it charges are often viewed as outra
geous. It's not too difficult to see how these
observations fit together.
In short, very few people on campus
find it shocking that students love to hate
the Bookstore. Apparently, the Book
store's administrators are among this
select minority.
They insist that the Bookstore is not
involved in a greedy quest for profits (that
are distributed back to students in the form
of rebates) and that it does its best to offer
a valuable service to the campus.
Although there is not much in the way
of concrete evidence to contradict these
claims, the need to secure the Bookstore's
long-term accountability to students
remains.
Student satisfaction should not be
dependent on the good will of its manage
ment. The Bookstore battles must result in
a permanent institutional mechanism to
ensure lower prices and quality services.
It is unlikely that these tasks will be
accomplished well by the new advisory
board. Committees are infamous for their
inefficiency, and important issues tend to
get bogged down in unnecessarily lengthy
debates.

Besides, the advisory hoard's function
is likely to be, well, giving advice. The
Bookstore would he hard-pressed to treat
its suggestions as binding in any substan
tive way.
Official as it sounds, the advisory board
also falls far short of a stable institution for
keeping the Bookstore in check. Like so
many other committees, it can be disband
ed as easily as it was formed.
Indeed, competition is the only way to
ensure that in the long run the bookstore
will price books and materials at a more
student friendly rate.
For most students, books and other
materials are expensive enough to lead
them to seek out lower prices. If the cam
pus becomes host to a competitor, the
Bookstore will have no choice but to con
centrate on its service and price efficiency.
The new advisory board offers no such
guarantee.
Even the Bookstore itself should view
competition as a way to avoid its "robber
baron' 1 image. (Indeed, several former
Bookstore administrators are currently on
trial for spending company funds on
extravagant perks).
If the Bookstore's pricing policies are
indeed fair, then competition cannot make
books and materials much cheaper. If this
is the result of competition, students may
learn to accept some of the realities of run
ning the Bookstore and stop treating it as a
campus arch villain.
Granted, starting up an alternative to
the Bookstore is extremely difficult and
attempts to do so have failed in the past.
Still, the fact remains that the same type of
competition thrives on other campuses,
and there is no obvious reason why it
would be impossible to stimulate it at Stan
ford.
This would no doubt take a great deal
of hard work, much of it focusing on cam
pus institutions. Reformers must insist that
the Bookstore would not enjoy any special
privileges that would be denied to com
petitors. Moreover the ASSU might be
asked to provide some financial backing
for such an enterprise, a step that would
require much more consideration than
compulsive committee-forming.
Are the benefits of competition worth
all the work it requires? Perhaps not. But
these benefits are real nonetheless, and
they should not be ignored in the hoopla
about the new advisorv board.
