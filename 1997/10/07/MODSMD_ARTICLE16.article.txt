# Jon Servaites
## Kierkegaard and Velveeta cheese 
### 
OKAY, I'm very
tired right now.
So I won't try to
fake a peppy Stanford atti
tude (yes, I have been
guilty of it too). But, no,
this is not going to be a
cynical column either.
After all, how could I be

cynical given that seven hours ago, I finally
turned in that seemingly eternal senior thesis?
And no, this isn't the sort of situation
where I am elated to rid from my life some
thing that I despised for a long time. Yes, the
thesis was... well, let's say, a titanic and
often grueling struggle.
But yes too, (and get out that Velveeta) it
was damn worth it. You see, I wrote on
Kierkegaard, the 19th century Danish
philosopher who often is labeled the "father
of existentialism."
And for anyone who has seriously read
Kierkegaard, you know it ain't simple (and if
you don't think so, your serious reading was
all for not, because you don't get it).
That is, there's no easy way to categorize
his thinking. So I will use an uneasy and
vague one: spirituality (and 1 will be vague
about my use of it, given its necessarily
vague character).
Get ready to raise your hands everyone!
When someone asks you if you are "reli
gious," how many of you say: "Well, I
wouldn't really say religious, but instead,

spiritual"? Okay, 1 see some hands.
And I know some of you are lying right
now by saying no. Anyway, the conversation
usually ends there, but a good follow-up ques
tion is: What do you mean by "spiritual"?
Does your spirituality consist of a quarter
pounder with cheese, Melrose Place, or a lot
of sex? If so, you can put your hands down
and hang out with that poodle that is loving
your leg right now. There's nothing to say
about the foolishness of your spirituality.
Now, what about when we think of our
spirituality in terms of doing things that we
love, despite their challenges. Like rock
climbing, writing, using the Force with your
light saber, etc. (No, poodle boy, finding a
place to watch Melrose doesn't count.) Is
this our spirituality?
Of course, Kierkegaard would say no.
But his melancholy and loneliness probably
affected his thoughts, so maybe he was
wrong.
Now, he wouldn't say that skillful but
challenging activities constitute non-spiritu
ality. But is he on to something when he sees
such activities as missing something? Are we
afraid to believe that there might be some
thing more to it than our super Stanford tal
ents? Can't a paralyzed or severely retarded
person be "spiritual" too, despite not pos
sessing skills of spirituality?
I know that I must question my own atti
tude. Especially after spending time at Stan
ford where spirits of self-importance are

high, I wonder about my own solipsism.
Okay, but what about our relationships?
With friends and with someone whom we
might spend the rest of our lives. There cer
tainly seems to be something very funda
mental in ourselves that evokes happiness in
spending time with someone whom we love.
Is this our spirituality?
This is tough. Kierkegaard chose to have
"faith in God" instead of in his fiancee. But
was he just a lonely dork? And if he was,
does this still mean that love for another is
the answer to our spirituality? Maybe.
After all, if you've experienced this love
(and even Kierky did), you know that it's
something pretty amazing. Some will say
that relationships aren't worth it, because
one can lay out their heart only to have it
pummeled. But, if the relationship goes the
right way, is this where it's at, even for the
loners who don't know it?
Nonetheless, despite the power of this
love, we may want to consider one's spiritu
ality further — on our own and with anoth
er —just to see if there is more to it. We may
want to think about why we are hesitant to
call ourselves religious (yes, I know what the
hesitation feels like). Or are we too afraid?
