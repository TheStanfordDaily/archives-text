Ingenuity would make bonfire
in Lake Lag a possibility
The controversy over having the tradi
tional Big Game bonfire at Lake Lagunita
and protecting the tiger salamanders is
unnecessary, as the two goals are not mutu
ally exclusive.
A reusable, insulated fire base that ele
vates the bonfire above the lake bed will pre
vent heat from reaching the salamanders.
This elevated fire base (picture a large,
round, shallow, portable BBQ without a
cover) will protect the mud encased amphib
ians, simplify cleanup and provide a more
stunning display than the old method of
building a bonfire on the lake bottom.
This fire base can be brought to the lake
bed in pieces or in pre-assembled. Position it
well, stack the wood, and it's bonfire time.
The bonfire can regain its historical loca
tion if the only objection to using Lake Lag
is overheating the salamanders that live
there. If and when the go ahead is granted
the bonfire committee can request volun
teers to help design and build an insulated
fire base.

Band's show insensitive
Saturday's football game between Stan
ford and Notre Dame turned out exactly as 1
expected. It was good to see "the Irish"
defeated on the gridiron.
What I found painful about the day had
little to do with football. The Stanford
Band's steady stream of anti-Catholic and
racist remarks targeting the Catholic com

munity and the Irish were wholly inappro
priate and hardly examples of the openness
we market as typical for Stanford.
I wonder which groups will be attacked
during the upcoming tributes to diversity?
I ordinarily find the Band a delight and
appreciate their mild irreverence. I looked
forward to more of the same on Saturday but
found myself the target of attempts at humor
based on prejudice and poor information.
I also felt that had it been any other
group, any other religious tradition or ethnic
group, the presumed outrage would have
been enough reason to scrap the routine
ahead of time.
What the Band has illustrated is that
being anti-Catholic is the last politically cor
rect prejudice.
We should expect the Band to maintain
some boundaries that are not explicitly
designed to denigrate a very large portion of
the Stanford population.
Am I outraged over this? No. But I do
feel betrayed by a member of the family.

Res Ed deserves respect
I'm offering this letter in response to
Sommer Gentry's submission on Oct. Ist.
I am a returning resident assistant, and I
suppose that makes me one of those "uni
formly bossy and pushy" people [Gentry]
was talking about; I enjoyed bullying my res
idents around so much that I decided to do it
again! Yes, after serving my term in Kimball,
I thought it might be nice to go to the Row,
so here I am, yelling, screaming, being pushy
and in general just being a royal pain in the

you-know-what to my all-sophomore resi
dents in Storey — because that clearly is
what my job is all about.
Praytell, how did [Gentry] arrive at [her]
thoroughly insightful conclusions about Res
Ed? I am assuming — and correct me if I am
wrong — that [she has] never actually
worked for the organization, n'est pas? Most
of the time, the job entails things that resi
dents never see. Staff meetings take up a
good chunk of time each week. Then there
are the strings of crises that residents have —
roommate conflicts, relationship issues,
friendships-gone-awry, psychological prob
lems, etc. — they all become issues in your
life as an RA.
Incidentally, by slamming the whole of
Res Ed, [Gentry] might want to know that
[she] may have offended a good number of
people. In addition to the RAs and RFs,
there are the RCCs, ETAs, ATAs, FAs, and
PHEs; also, there are the RDs, residence
deans, who are important folks to get to
know as an RA when a situation in a resi
dence requires some additional support and
expertise.
One final note: As a former RA there at
Kimball, I can speak for the commitment
that they have and will continue to display to
their residents, and to each other as well.
They are dedicated, hard-working people,
and they are exceptionally qualified for the
posts that they hold. I am not saying that [she
has] to love [her] RAs, but [she does] need to
accord them the respect that they deserve.
