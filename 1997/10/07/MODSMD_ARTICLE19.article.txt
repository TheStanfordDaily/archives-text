## Kelly Young Crowds and concerts: a slice of the West in Moscow? 
### 
I was only a week into my quarter in
Moscow, and already I yearned for a bit
of the West. 1 had a craving that e-mail
just couldn't satisfy.
Let's face it, I am weak.
Luckily, I am not the only one.
Some of my fellow Stanford-Muscovites
had read The Moscow Times and various
expatriate tabloids and discovered a snow
boarding competition followed by a free
Prodigy concert in Manezh Square.
What could be more Western than a
good ol\ down-home techno concert, I
thought.
I obviously have a lot to learn about this
country.
When we arrived at the square Saturday
evening, the only things purely Western
were the four Brits standing next to us.
We struck up a conversation with them
and found they'd been in Russia about as
long as we had. They were teaching English
in a village north of Moscow.
In the meantime, the Russian teenagers
surrounding us kept trying to chant, "Prod-i
-gy! Prod-i-gy!" To our Western ears, it
sounded more like. "Prrro-duh-zhe! Prrro
duh-zhe!" We told the Brits to start intiud

ing "prodigy" in their vocabulary lists.
Our new friends were also convinced that
the Russians needed dance instructors. I'm
glad 1 wasn't the only one who thought as
much. As my host daughter once told me
earnestly, "The Russians try to dance like
Americans, but they cannot. They jump
instead."
So here I was facing the Moscow State
Historical Museum and the Kremlin watch
ing Russians spasmodically dance, jump and
chant to the pre-concert tunes. Try to keep
in mind that we're packed into this square
like sardines. When one person took a
breath, everyone felt it.
When the concert finally began, the Rus
sians started to "sing" along with the band,
"Smock my beetch up!" Again, this was not
the Western version to which 1 was accus
tomed. However, 1 thought, I can deal with
this. It's a Western experience with a twist of
Russia. Well, the innocent twist soon mutat
ed into an out-of-control hurricane.
As soon as the second song began, the
crowd swelled forward toward the stage. I
turned to my Stanford friends and said,
"Whoa. It's like it's breathing."
And sure enough, the crowd swelled

back toward us like a lung filling to capacity.
The situation took a turn for the worse
when the people in front of us started to fall.
They were falling like dominoes, and I was
inevitably the next to fall. I turned to my
friends with a panicked look on my face, but
nothing could be done. We were going
down.
I knew I wasn't at the very bottom of the
heap because I couldn't feel the broken beer
bottles slicing into my back. Instead, I think
1 had some teeny-bopper's knee grinding
into my spine. By the way she was scream
ing, I surmised that she was the one with
beer bottles slicing her back.
I don't know how long I was under. Too
long.
As I was lying there with only my head
visible, I thought that this scene resembled
what Stalin's funeral must have looked like
47 years ago.
Ironically enough, we were just a few
meters from Red Square. How poetic, I
thought.
For a split second, 1 thought I was going
to join the likes of Stalin. However, I real
ized before that could happen, my arm
would break. It was bent back, and the

weight of the numerous people on top of me
was bending it even further.
For once, I was thankful for all of my lay
ers of clothing. They provided a bit of
padding.
I managed to wiggle the other arm out
and attempted to grab the hand of someone
standing up. I'd forgotten the word for
"help" in Russian, so I resorted to English,
which went unheard amid the collective
screams and cries coming from the heap.
Just as bystanders were beginning to peel
people off of the pile, the screaming girl
from the bottom layer laced her fingers
through my hair and pulled. I was convinced
she was planning to take my scalp home
with her as a concert souvenir.
So first, my hair would rip out, my arm
would break, my chest would collapse, I
would slowly be deprived of oxygen and
then I would die.
Before I could begin my long journey to
the big Kremlin in the Sky, bystanders man
aged to pull enough people off the heap so 1
could stand up. That didn't last long. The
crowd surged again, and I fell again, litis
time, my glasses were thrown off my face.
Luckily, 1 heard where they landed and was

able to feel about the ground to retrieve
them.
1 found my friends who had also been a
part of the heap, and we made a beeline for
the back. Our new British friends were
nowhere to be found.
Before we made it out of the mob, we
got caught in human traffic again. My feet
kept getting tangled up with other people's.
1 was convinced we were going down again,
but somehow, we managed to stay upright
and maneuver through the rest of the
crowd.
We had only lasted through two songs,
but we didn't care. We were alive. To cele
brate our survival, we traveled down the
street to kill ourselves with cholesterol at the
local Patio Pizza. Pepsi and cheesecake
never tasted so good.
In my hunt for something Western, 1 got
something very Russian â€” a lesson in crowd
control. Even when I tried to make a brief
escape from Russian life, it smacked me
back in the face.

Kelly Young, a junior majoring in history,
would like to add that studying in Moscow
does not make someone a Communist.
