"Everyone was in the right place
at the right time," said head coach
Sheryl Johnson. "Parents and fans
were very impressed because our
passes were just beautiful."
The wonderful-to-watch win
could be credited to a complete
team effort, according to captain
Justina Williams. "We had great
communication. The forwards pres
sured the ball, and the defense
stayed with their marks," she said.
The Cardinal was led by sopho
more forward Mallory Chambers,
who scored with 29 minutes remain
ing in the first period on an assist by
Williams. Freshman defender
Michelle Scott added the second
goal with 19:02 remaining in the
game.
Senior goalkeeper Kelly Naylor
also came through with some essen

tial — and exciting — saves. Dis
playing tremendous strength and
skill, she wowed Cardinal fans by
slide-tackling on a Golden Bear
breakaway attempt and tipping the
ball wide with her stick on a corner
shot.
Standouts for the Bears included
senior goalkeeper Karen Hagen,
who had 14 saves on the match.
Stanford, however, still managed to
outshoot the Bears 18-4.
As the Cardinal has gained more
and more game experience, well-ex
ecuted plays and the ability to set
game tempos have become team
trademarks.
(We can) "outrun and out-en
dure any team," said Johnson.
So far this season, players have
managed to stick to their game no
matter what the opponent or the cir
cumstances. (Everyone is) "passion
ate about winning, motivated and
hardworking," said junior forward
Monique Leroux.
Stanford can only hope that kind
of positive attitude and the powerful
athleticism it displayed on Saturday
are here to stay. This week on the
practice field, the Cardinal will focus
on staying in shape and sharpening
its skills for Saturday's home game
against Pacific.

Pacific on Sept. 27. That matchup

resulted in a 6-0 Cardinal victory, so
UOP may not pose much of a Car
dinal threat. But as junior defender
Stephanie Finkelstein pointed out,
"(We) don't prepare differently for
any team."
After this weekend, the Cardinal
will miss a week of school when it
embarks on a road trip to Boston
College. There, Stanford will face

Dartmouth, Yale, Brown and the
host Eagles. Dartmouth and Brown
— both ranked in the top 20 — will
provide a stern test.
"We're really excited for
Boston," said sophomore defender
Julie Gwozdz. This is an opportuni
ty, she said, to "show the East Coast
we can play with them, too."
Stanford certainly has the poten
tial to win all its remaining games.
And in order to be considered for an
NCAA playoff berth, the Cardinal
must do just that.
