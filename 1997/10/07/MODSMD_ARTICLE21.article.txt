# The 						time is now
## Men's Ultimate Frisbee aims to shed the bridesmaid tag 
### 
It's 3:30 p.m. on an early October afternoon, and El
Nino is playing havoc with the Stanford men's Ulti
mate Frisbee team.
The wind at Chuck Taylor Field is a steady force. Oc
casionally, it gusts or dies down slightly, but those short
bursts only make tossing the small multi-colored disks
even more difficult. Throw after throw goes astray, one
catching an upward rush and sailing away, the next
blown sideways off-target.
The players are laughing, smiling as they retrieve their
weather-affected disks. They get back into their drills
and try again, perhaps playfully cursing the wind, but al
ways tuning their throws in an effort to conquer Mother
Nature.
Tournament play begins in late November. Intense
competition starts in January.
They are already serious about Ultimate.
This is, after all, their year.
"This is the most competitive fall Ultimate has ever
had," said senior co-captain Alex Young. "The drive is

higher in people."
Last season, the Stanford men's team lost to UC-
Santa Barbara in the title game of the collegiate champi
onship tournament. Stanford does not want a repeat this
year. That would mean the end of a dream for many of
the team's core players.

"It is the last year for a number of our top players,"
said team co-captain Dan Eisenberg, a graduate student
in economics. "We feel this is our year."

Stanford has won only one men's Ultimate title, in the
inaugural collegiate national championship in 19K4.
Since then, the team has established itself as one of the
top programs in the country.
But 13 years is a long time between titles for any top
program. The "eternal bridesmaid" status, clichd as it
may be, has been a painful reality for Stanford in the '90s.
Mike Payne knows the hurt of always being close,
never winning. Payne, a graduate student in health sci
ences research, is in his final season with the Stanford
team. In four previous years, he has finished fifth, third,
and second (twice) at nationals.
"I certainly feel an urgency (this year)," Payne said,
"mainly because I've invested a lot of time in this."
Payne is the veteran's veteran, a focused player who
loves the Ultimate experience both on and off the field.
Eisenberg calls him the consensus team leader. More
than anyone, Payne's fire symbolizes the quest of the
team.
"You can already see it with Mike," Eisenberg said.

"For him, this year is the culmination of his college I Jlti
mate career."
If Payne or any of the 13 returning players with na
tional tournament experience needs an incentive to
work hard, they am find it in the 21 14 title game loss last
May.
"I hope that everyone goes through every practice
thinking about sitting on the field and watching Santa
Barbara celebrate," he said.
The UCSB team came into the title game as defend
ing champions. They played like old hands under pres
sure, "like they'd been there before," Eisenbergsaid.
"That game made us realize we weren't as good as we
thought," he said. "They beat us pretty badly."
This year, Stanford has the experience of a title game
under its belt. It also has one of the most talented teams
in school history. A total of 10K players turned out for the
team's first practice —an all-time high and that makes


Jim
Tankersley
for a squad that is both deep and ath
letic.
"Our strength is athleticism,"
Eisenberg said. "A lot of speed,
height and jumping ability. We're
going to really go with our strength."
That means a lot of deep throws,
acrobatic grabs and stifling defense. It
will take practice. The season official

ly begins at UC-Santa Cruz in late No
vember, but play gets intense in Janu
ary when Stanford faces a title-game
rematch at the UCSB tournament.
"Santa Barbara will have the
mental edge over us until we beat
them," Eisenberg said, "but we ex
pect to beat them this year."
Is beating the Gauchos one of the
main goals this season?
Payne thinks about the question.
The wind whips through his dark
hair, tugging on the sleeves of his

faded navy blue shirt. Behind him,
disks continue to fly every which
way. El Nino is still winning.
"Our goal," he says, choosing his
words carefully, "should be to play
the best Ultimate each of us can
play. No team can stick with us in
that case."
