# Campus will have own parish
## Stanford Catholics granted new autonomous status 
### Bill Bowen 
On July 1, Bishop Pierre Dumaine gave the Stan
ford Catholic Community a new membership and
mission. The community gained independence
from the St. Thomas Aquinas Parish of Palo Alto,
passing control of administration and finance to
campus Church leaders.
The Catholic Church's affiliation with the Uni
versity began in 1966 when then-Dean of the Chapel
Dave Napier convinced the trustees of the chapel to
allow denominational worship in Memorial Church.
As the Catholic community at Stanford grew, it
became even more closely associated with campus
life. Tresidder Union, Old Union Clubhouse and
other campus locations became ordinary gathering
places for the services and events.
This summer, Church leaders decided the com
munity had reached a level of stability and maturity
where it could operate on its own. The Stanford
Catholic Community now reports directly to the
Diocese of San Jose rather than the St. Thomas
Aquinas Parish.
Mass schedules and locations,
however, will remain unchanged.
The creation of the new parish is
not merely an administrative
change, however. The sale of the
Newman Center in Palo Alto, along
with the contributions of Stanford
Parish members, will give the com
munity full financial autonomy.
With financial independence, Stan
ford Catholics will have more abili
ty to subsidize retreats and pro
grams. The Rev. Patrick Laßelle,
pastor of the new parish, plans to
"advertise and focus the ministry to
make it more attractive to come."
With the change in function
comes a change of image for the
Catholic community. Senior Chris
Angel commented, "The change

of parish reflects how we've come
of age in the Church's eyes. Mov
ing onto campus is a sign of
growth, independence, and a
strong community."
The goal of the switch is to give
Catholic students a greater role in
their church. According to the Rev.
Barry Frayne, pastor of the St.
Thomas Aquinas Parish, students
will "have a much better sense of
belonging rather than feeling like
they belong downtown."
Laßelle added, "Students will
have higher ownership of the
parish; others will be their guests."
This increased control opens
new opportunities for Stanford
Catholics to offer community ser
vice in the name of the Church. New
undergraduate groups have already
been formed and new Church pro
grams are being planned.
