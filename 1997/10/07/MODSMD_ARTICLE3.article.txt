# Campus will have own parish
## Stanford Catholics granted new autonomous status 
### Bill Bowen 
On July 1, Bishop Pierre Dumaine gave the Stan
ford Catholic Community a new membership and
mission. The community gained independence
from the St. Thomas Aquinas Parish of Palo Alto,
passing control of administration and finance to
campus Church leaders.
The Catholic Church's affiliation with the Uni
versity began in 1966 when then-Dean of the Chapel
Dave Napier convinced the trustees of the chapel to
allow denominational worship in Memorial Church.
As the Catholic community at Stanford grew, it
became even more closely associated with campus
life. Tresidder Union, Old Union Clubhouse and
other campus locations became ordinary gathering
places for the services and events.
This summer, Church leaders decided the com
munity had reached a level of stability and maturity
where it could operate on its own. The Stanford
Catholic Community now reports directly to the
Diocese of San Jose rather than the St. Thomas
Aquinas Parish.
