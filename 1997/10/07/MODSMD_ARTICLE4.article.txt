# Construction forces physics courses into ill-suited, smaller classrooms
##

Construction delays have forced Physics
Department officials to move some of their
largest lecture courses into facilities unsuit
ed for teaching introductory physics.
This summer, the Physics Tank was torn
down to make way for the Science and En
gineering Ouad. Classes previously held in
the Tank, such as the Physics 20 and 40 se
ries, were scheduled to be held in the new
Regional Teaching Facility.
However, construction delays have
pushed back the finishing date for the new
building, forcing the Physics 20 series to
move to Annenberg Auditorium and the
Physics 40 series to move to Building 320,
Rm. 105.
According to Rosenna Yau, Physics De
pirtment administrative services manager,
tne department, expecting access to the
new, larger facility scheduled only one lec
ture per day each for Physics 21 and 41.
In the past, the department had held two
lectures for each at different times to reduce
class sizes. The construction delay forced
the department to add an additional class
for each series, causing some confusion for
students during the first week of the quarter.
The University has tried to upgrade the

temporary classrooms to accommodate
physics classes. Yau said the department
was given funds to improve the facilities be
fore the start of fall quarter. Despite those
changes a number of problems remain un
solved.
The main concern for faculty is the in
ability to perform live demonstrations dur
ing lectures. Neither Annenberg nor Build
ing 320 is built for performing experiments,
an integral part of teaching physics, accord
ing to Physics Prof. Andrei Linde.
Linde, who teaches Physics 21: "Me
chanics and Heat," usually shows a lot of ex
periments during class. "It makes the class
more alive, the students can understand the
experiments visually even though they
might not understand the theory complete
ly," he said.
Many past demonstrations involving
major apparatus, combustion and projectile
motion, could not be shown this quarter.
The department has tried to compensate by
showing some of the experiments on video,
which some believe minimizes their impact.
"It's like there is a miracle, but instead of
seeing the miracle, someone shows a movie
of it," Linde said.
Additionally, before the Physics lank
was torn down, more than 280 boxes of
equipment for the experiments had to be

moved. Most of that is now in temporary
storage around campus.
When Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff tried
to set up an experiment for Physics 47:
"Light and Heat," he couldn't find some
parts of the apparatus.
Another problem for Physics 47 is I hat
Building 320 doesn't have air conditioning,
which means that the windows and blinds
have to be open during the day. This makes
demonstrating light experiments almost im
possible.
The temporary lecture halls also lack suf
ficient blackboard space. Faculty have been
forced to use overhead transparencies,
making it difficult for professors to show
every step of the math involved. To com
pensate, Linde has had to pass out lecture
notes with the math worked out.
Junior Abe Shaikh, a Physics 21 student,
agrees that Annenbera isn't a gtx>d class
room for physics.
"It's really dark, and it's hard to see the
transparencies," he said. Shaikh also said it
is hard to concentrate in class because Linde
cannot work out any problems and cannot
show experiments. "The class is very sleep
inducing."
Linde is worried t hat the students are los
ing an integral part of physics because of the
lack of proper facilities.
