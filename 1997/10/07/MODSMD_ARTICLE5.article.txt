Stanford University successfully
maintained the level of its fund-rais
ing and gift income in the 19%-97 fis
cal year by raising more than $312.3
million.
The past year's total falls
$600,(XX) short of the 1995-96 cam
paign, which included $39 million
more in bequests.
Bequests are gilts left to the Uni
versity by donors in their wills.
"Bequest maturities is one area
of the program we readily admit we
can't influence," quipped John Ford,
vice-president for development.
Although the total amount raised
fell slightly short of the 1995-96 cam
paign's results, the past year's statis
tics reflect several promising trends.
The total number of donors to

Stanford University has increased
6.5 percent to 52.K44 and donations
to The Stanford Fund, which helps
finance undergraduate education
and student life, rose from $5.2 mil
lion in fiscal 1996 to $6.1 million the
past fiscal year.
Senior (iift participation has also
increased four percentage points to
62 percent.
Although the five-year Universi
ty Centennial fundraising campaign
ended in 1992, Ford commended
class reunion organizers for setting
individual fundraising goals for their
classes.
Ford mentioned that the ( lass of
1982 set a $1 million fundraising
goal, of which more than $ I XX),(XX)
has already been raised.
"Classes are getting organized
and people are making terrific gifts
in context of reunions," said Ford. "That kind of
spirit is what 1 think is driving the numbers."
Despite these successes, the rate of undergrad
uate alumni participation in giving remained stag
nant at 34 percent.
"Growth in alumni participation stalled last
year because we didn't have the resources to con
tinue our phoning program in the summer," ex
plained Ford.
Although the resource shortage has since been
alleviated, Ford still emphasized the need to strive
for wider participation in undergraduate alumni
giving.
"We know we have to work harder on increas
ing the level of understanding among undergrad

uate degree holders on the importance of The
Stanford Fund," he said.
Ford attributes some of the success of the 1996-
97 campaign to the booming economy and a bull
ish stock market.
"Simply stated, what is fueling the good gift re
sults is the stock market and a generally healthy
economy," Ford said.
A large number of donations to the University
this year came in the way of appreciated securities,
he explained.
One of the important effects of the fundraising
campaign has been growth of the University's en
dowment.
"During the five years of [University President
Gerhard] Casper's presidency we added $400 mil
lion to the endowment of the University," said
Ford.

The growth of the endowment affords the Uni
versity greater freedom in its operations.
"We really do want to decrease our depen
dence on other sources of income and increase the
percentage of the operating budget covered by the
dependable endowment," added Ford.
The 1997-1998 fundraising effort will continue
seeking support for the Hoover Institution and
the Stanford Graduate Fellowship program,
which aims to attract some of the nation's top doc
toral students by offering 100 three-year fellow
ships each academic year beginning this year.
Ford expects the 1998-99 effort, on the other
hand, to look more toward funding undergradu
ate programs such as Sophomore College, Intro
duction to Humanities and the Science Core.
"We need to get permanent endowment be
hind these programs," Ford said.
