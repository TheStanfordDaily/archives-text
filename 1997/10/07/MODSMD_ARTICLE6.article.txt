## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
In only its second quarter as an in
terdisciplinary major, the Program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity has already attracted 30stu
dents to its program.
"The numbers are larger than we
expected," said CSRE Director of
Asian American Studies and Assoc.
History Prof. Gordon Chang.
By the end of the quarter, CSRE
expects 40 to 50 majors, in addition to
a handful of minors. "The numbers
are increasing rapidly," said CSRE
Program Chair, History Prof. Al Ca
marillo.
The program offers majors in
Asian-American Studies, Chicano
Studies and Native American Studies
as well as the CSRE major itself. ITie
previously existing programs in Jew
ish Studies and African and Afro
American Studies are also affiliated
with CSRE.
Camarillo described CSRE as
"the first program of its kind in the
[United States) to be comparative."
Many institutions have contacted the

program's developers to learn about
CSRE, hoping to use it as a model in
formulating their own ethnic studies
programs.
After taking two core courses,
chosen from among seven offerings,
students design their own thematic
concentration with at least nine
courses relating to it. There are about
140 courses students can choose from
to fulfill this requirement.
The core courses have been de
signed specifically for ( SRE, and the
program hopes eventually to have as
many as 10 from which to choose.
Camarillo described the thematic
concentrations as "more like individ
ually designed majors," because stu
dents have freedom in choosing the
theme as well as the courses. Exam
ples of themes students have chosen
include comparisons of indigenous
societies in South America and
Africa and the study of race, educa
tion and public policy in the United
States.
Students have praised CSRE for
its flexibility, its off-campus op|*>rtu
nitiesand the personal attention they
receive.

"Because the program's s<) sma 11,1
feel like I have a connection to the
professors and other students," said
junior Vanessa Delgado, a Chicano
studies and political science major.
"The Political Science Department is
not nearly so personal."
" The faculty is really interested in
what you're doing as a student," said
Celia Garcia, a junior majoring in
('hicano studies and political science.
"They ask for our input in developing
new classes, t(hÂ». There's great com
munication between faculty and stu
dents about what the students want in
the curriculum."
Lunches with students and faculty
arc common in the CSRE program,
and quarterly retreats with all majors
are also being planned.
Courses relevant to CSRE will be
offered at both Stanford in Washing
ton, starting this spring, and Stan
ford's new overseas program in
Puebla, Mexico, which starts this win
ter.
l"he program also offers stipends
to two students involved in CSRE
oriented internships every year.
"There is an intellectual advan
tage to interacting with colleagues
who are also interested in studying
race and ethnicity," said Chang. "It's
good for both the faculty and stu
dents involved in the program."
"I see a really good future for this
program because the students are all
motivated and the faculty is really re
sponsive," said Garcia.

An informational session for in
terested students about CSRE is
being held next Monday at 4 p.m. in
Bldg. 200 Rm. 205.
A summit entitled "Race in
America: Defining the Issues" has
been scheduled for Nov. 6, and a day
long series of panels will be held win
ter quarter. Both of these events, ac
cording to Camarillo, are follow-ups
to the call President Clinton made at
UC-San Diego last spring for a na
tional dialogue on race.
