What we're about...
We realize there's some question about what
exactly Allied Signal "does."
We are a manufacturer of aerospace and
automotive components, chemicals, fibers, plastics
and advanced materials. Everything from spark
plugs to aircraft engines, from commercial aircraft
guidance systems to circuit board laminates, from
sonar systems to high performance fibers.
Where we stand...
Many companies talk about change. We make it
happen. A company-wide change initiative set in
place just five years ago is delivering results.
Sales, which currently stand at $14+ billion, have
grown by $2.5 billion and earnings have risen at a
compound average annual rate of 25%. Our stock
price has quadrupled since 1991.
You should be there...
Have we gotten your attention yet? Allied Signal
has impressive growth momentum. If you are
interested in finding out more about one of the top
performers in the Fortune 100, be sure to take
advantage of our campus visit.
