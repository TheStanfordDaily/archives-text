# Oracle CEO expounds vision
## Ellison sees a future of cheaper, simpler computers 
### Sangman Lee 
The next age of computing will be dom
inated by simple, low-cost network com
puters rather than personal computers, Or
acle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison told an audi
ence of 350 in Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Ellison said he envisions a future when
computers will be "simple, low-cost appli
ances that the customer can use ... like the
telephone and television."
Ellison told the audience that the prob
lem with today's computer industry is that

it is still characterized by jargon and pro
hibitive cost, which prevent most con
sumers from owning a computer.
Ellison said the industry still is in its
"hobbyist age."
"The computer industry is the only in
dustry that requires its end users to manage
its appliances," he said. "We don't expect
anyone to go home and back up their tele
vision."
This, according to Ellison, is the reason
the television industry has made its way
into more than 90 percent of homes in the
United States, while only 30 percent of

American homes and 10 percent of Japan
ese homes have computers.
Traditional personal computers, Ellison
said, are too expensive for the average con
sumer and are designed to perform func
tions that most people do not need.
Ellison predicted that in the future the
majority of consumers will use their com
puters for communication.
"The PC is a fabulous tool for engineers
and programmers, but as a communication
device it is way too expensive," Ellison said.
Furthermore, the current person
al computer industry is dominated
by Microsoft Corp., which insists on
the use of its proprietary technology
and resists complying with industry
wide adoption of standards, Ellison
said.
Because developers building
products for personal computers
have to pay licensing fees to use Mi
crosoft's proprietary technology, El
lison said, it drives up cost.

In contrast, the network comput
ers proposed by Oracle will be
cheaper and centered on World
Wide Web-based technology and in
dustry standards.
Moving to the issue of regulating
the contents of the Internet, Ellison
acknowledged the need to filter junk
from the Web but said, "the answer
is not regulating but branding."
The introduction of well-known
brand-name sources such as The
New York Times and CNN on the
Web, Ellison proposed, will provide
quality content that consumers
trust.
