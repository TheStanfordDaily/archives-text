No raises for Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) — Most Americans believe they should get
cost-of-living pay increases every year, but they sure don't feel that way
about members of Congress. In fact, some feel so strongly that they say
they'll vote against any lawmaker who supports a raise.
That expression of sentiment comes in an Associated Press poll taken
just after Congress hesitantly approved legislation making possible a
$3,072 pay increase for itself, the first in five years.
The bill squeaked through House and Senate last week and awaits
President Clinton's signature. Clinton hasn't said what he will do, but a
spokesman said the president thinks the question is one for Congress to
decide.
The poll suggests possible trouble for legislators who supported the
increase for themselves. Fully 26 percent of those questioned said they
would be less likely to vote to re-elect a member of Congress who had
voted for the pay raise. About 58 percent said it didn't make any differ
ence.

On the other hand, the general proposition that people's pay should
go up to keep pace with the cost of living was approved by better than 80
percent.
But better than 63 percent said a cost-of-living increase for lawmakers
is unnecessary because members of Congress get generous pay, pensions
and other benefits.
Red Cross apologizes
JERUSALEM (AP) — The Red Cross handed over 60,000 pages of
World War 11-era documents to Israel yesterday and a top official
acknowledged the organization's "moral failure" in keeping silent while
the Nazis murdered six million Jews.
"Very clearly, the ICRC's activities with regard to the Holocaust are
sensed as a moral failure," said George Willemin, director of archives for
the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross.
"The ICRC admits that it has kept silent with regard to the Ilolocaust,
and I would say that this is the heart of the moral failure," he added.
