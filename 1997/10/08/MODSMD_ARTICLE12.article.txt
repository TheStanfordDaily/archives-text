## President accused of last-minute responses 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Out
raged Senate Republicans accused
the Clinton administration yester
day of trying to run out the clock on
their campaign fund-raising investi
gation, and urged President Clinton
to "step up to the plate" to force his
supporters to testify.
Facing a Dec. 31 deadline, the
Republicans teed off against Clin
ton and Attorney General Janet
Reno for more than two hours
while the White House point man
for the 19% campaign, Harold
Ickes, waited to testify.
As Ickes sat in a back room out
side the large Senate hearing facility,
his written statement was provided

to reporters, and it demonstrated his
oft-demonstrated combativeness.
He said the Senate Governmen
tal Affairs Committee's "virtually
exclusive focus on Democratic...
fund raising in general, and fund
raising by the winning campaign of
President Clinton and Vice Presi
dent Gore in particular, serves a
partisan — not a public — agenda."
Although Ickes was eased out of
his staff position earlier this year, he
defended all the Clinton-Gore fund
raising as legal and maintained the
hearings were designed "to tarnish
the Democratic Party in general,
and President Clinton, and more
pointedly, Vice President Gore."
