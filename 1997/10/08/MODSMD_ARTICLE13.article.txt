## Editorial A 						good move Viennese Ball relocation 
### 
THE DECISION TO MOVE the
acclaimed Viennese Ball off
campus may be a break with tra
dition, but sometimes preserving tradi
tion means breaking it a little.
Every year for the past two decades,
long lines of students have slept out in
the cold or rain to get tickets, and every
year at least a few disappointed stu
dents missed the ball because tickets
were sold out.
But this year, for the first time in its
history, the ball will be held at the
Hyatt Rickeys in Palo Alto. The site is
ideal for a number of reasons, proximi
ty to campus, accommodations for
unlimited ticket sales, guest accommo
dations for alumni, elegant food and
drink provided by the hotel, set-up and
clean-up by hotel staff and convenient
parking. Plus, a free shuttle to and from
the dance. And to top it off, now every
one can wear shoes.
Students from the Stanford-in-Aus
tria program first brought the Viennese
Ball to Stanford in 1977. The ball was
held in Toyon Hall, attended by a small
group of just 350 students.
That first attempt to bring Austrian
dance home to Stanford was the begin
ning of an affair that would soon
become a cherished tradition on The
Farm. The next year it moved to Roble
gym to accommodate a larger number
of students, and since then it has grown
into the beloved annual affair it is
today.
Roble gym has been the traditional
location for the event for the past 20
years, but its time seems to have been
coming to a close. For one, having the
ball in a gym created numerous compli
cations, like not being able to wear
shoes for fear the floor would be
scratched and not having enough room
for all the people who wanted to
attend. In addition, Roble can no

longer withstand the wear and tear of
decorations year after year, such as
holes drilled into walls. Gyms were sim
ply not meant to be ballrooms.
Hotels, on the other hand, were
made to host such things. They special
ize in the business of providing accom
modations for huge banquet halls,
receptions and other large scale events.
Not only do they have the appropriate
facilities, they also have staff on-hand
who are trained to run such events
smoothly and professionally.
With the hotel staff taking over
administrative details of the event, the
Viennese Ball committee will be able to
focus more on other details of the ball.
The only drawback of all this is that the
price of tickets will be up a little. But if
people are willing to sleep out in the
cold for admission to the event, a few
dollars more to pay for a guaranteed
ticket — without camping out —
doesn't seem to be much of a problem.
It's admirable to see an attempt on
the part of the Viennese Ball commit
tee to preserve and improve a cher
ished Stanford tradition, especially con
sidering that the fact that student sea
son football tickets are all sold out and
that no Big Game Bonfire will be held
this year.
It's nice to know that at least one
other cherished tradition is still around
and available to anyone who wants to
participate. If all goes well for the
upcoming Viennese Ball, perhaps the
Hyatt Rickeys will replace Roble gym
as the new home of the event.
And despite all the changes of the
new location, much of the tradition is
staying to provide an evening of music,
dance and enchantment — the dance
lessons, the logo contest, the opening
waltz, the swing room and the waltz
room. We hope that these traditions
will never change.
