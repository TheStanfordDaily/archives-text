## My own personal space What you can expect from me 
### 
IT'S THE DUTY of
all writers to be faith
ful to their thoughts.
Audiences come and go,
media change and lan
guages degrade into
strange perversions of
their original selves —
but if you come close to

nailing your thoughts on the page, you've
got a shot at transcending all that.
That's probably about as close to pro
found as I'll get in this column. I'm not the
sort to spout Zen koans at innocent
bystanders, unless I'm heavily intoxicated.
And even then, the probability's much
higher that I'll just mumble something and
fumble for a match.
I took that momentary detour into
heavy thinking to give my rationale for
what I'm about to do. What I'm about to
do is to tell you exactly what I'm not about
to do for the rest of my stint as a colum
nist. This is your official warning. I'm only
going to say this once, because I have lots
of other trees to climb.
That said, here is the incomplete mas
ter list of what you won't see in my col
umn.
— Heartwarming stories about personal
discoveries I made at Stanford. I'm not
writing to lull you into a comfortable
snooze. The last thing I want to read (or
write) is cute, happy stuff about what's
happening in someone's life. I'm not into

inflicting unnecessary pain.
— Self-glorifying tales of success, over
coming adversity or living well in general,
for similar reasons to the above.
— Zany stories, contrived stories that are
supposedly funny "'cause they're true" or
the like. I'm not the sort of person who
makes people laugh by telling jokes. I'm
the sort of person who makes people
laugh by acting like a dumb-ass. (Of
course, there are those who would imme
diately question the use of the word "act
ing" in the previous sentence. See my
point?)
— Shameless plugs for student organiza
tions, academic departments or commer
cial products. I'm a graduate student. I
don't have time for student organizations.
I'm too nearsighted to see much of any
thing outside my department. I'm too poor
to buy many commercial products and too
proud to advertise any of them.
— Anything that could be confused for writ
ing by Andy Rooney. That man scares me.
— The sort of day-to-day flotsam and jet
sam you're likely to get in massive supply.
I don't have time to list everything that
this covers, but I can give you the idea. For
example, I won't make half-hearted
attempts to tell lurid sexual stories or
jokes, give you unwanted advice or toss
inside jokes at you.
So what do I intend to do?
— Prod apathetic annoyance into seething,
directed anger. There is a huge amount of

stuff that is or will be wrong about this
place that few care to consider. Stanford
has been doing a remarkably good job of
encouraging complacent behavior in its
young'uns. If we don't put a stop to this,
we'll soon be enduring large doses of
Mandatory Fun That Doesn't Involve Any
thing Dangerous Or Interesting. Or worse
still, we won't be enduring it — we'll LIKE
it. Do you crave days and days of
Monopoly and square dancing with a
stupid, half-crazed grin on your face?
— Share the joy of living. I don't mean the
superficial stuff like puppies and good
grades, either. I mean the pith of the mat
ter, that which boggles the mind and
explodes the soul. I mean the sort of thing
that differentiates between living life and
just letting life be led. It will take a lot of
work to explain what this is, but I'm will
ing to try.
— Think hard and write.
I'm involved in a classic love-hate rela
tionship with this place. This column is the
child of that relationship, and you're
about to watch that child grow from a
wailing infant to a furious, throbbingly
hormonal adolescent.
So off we go. Where we stop, nobody
knows. Don't bet on the double-zero just
yet, Mr. or Ms. Happy Camper. This
wheel has been around.
