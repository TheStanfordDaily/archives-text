Frosh should keep cars at
home
I agree with the current trend of letters
on University parking problems and policy
— living in Toyon and parking behind
Okada isn't too fun or too convenient.
My solution, one that is used at many
schools now, is to ask next year's incoming
frosh class to their leave cars at home. This
will free up a lot of spaces! This type of pol
icy is feasible and practical to implement
because the people who would like to com
plain (next year's frosh) can't, and it will
save money for the students and parents of
those people who don't have to buy cars
and gas. I know that this type of policy
could be criticized as one that forces frosh
to stay on campus, but then again, there's
not much in Palo Alto that students can
afford anyhow!
The parking problem is pretty simple,
either reduce the number of cars or get
more parking, and I don't think that adding
that many more spaces is practical right
now.

The Oct. 6 Daily carried an AP story on
the recent assassination attempt by an
Israeli hit squad on Khalid Meshal, a
Hamas official, in Jordan. The article quot
ed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as saying that Meshal was"the
No. 1 figure in Hamas, responsible for the
murder of innocent citizens. The govern
ment's obligation is t0... fight terror with
out compromise."
The New York Times of the same day,
however, reported that "Despite the Gov
ernment's assertion that Mr. Meshal was a
major source of terrorist attacks, most
experts on the Hamas described him as a
relatively moderate political leader of the
far-flung movement and noted that the
Government itself had pointed to a militant
Hamas leader in Damascus as the one who
had given the order for suicide bombings in
Jerusalem in July and September."
Th j AP's acceptance at face value of
Netanyahu's defense of the attempted
assassination is a mark of the one-sidedness

that prevails in the United States toward
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a result
we learn in detail — and quite properly —
of the terrible havoc caused by Palestinian
suicide bombers, but civilian deaths in
Lebanon caused by Israeli warplanes and
artillery get little coverage.
The media repeatedly remind us of
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's fail
ure to prevent terrorism — a failure that
prompted Congress to stop all U.S. aid to
the Palestinians — but seldom describe in
detail the suffering caused by Israel's impo
sition of collective punishment on the
entire Palestinian population. Curfews, con
tinued border closings, and travel restric
tions over the past several years have crip
pled the Palestinian economy by making it
impossible for Palestinians to get their jobs
or conduct ordinary business. Education
has been interrupted for thousands of
young people. We hear little about the
Israeli government's continued confiscation
of Palestinian land for the expansion of set
tlements while it demolishes hundreds of
Palestinian homes for lack of building per
mits that are virtually impossible to obtain.
Nothing can justify bombing or other

acts of terrorism against civilians, but it is
possible to explain why such violence takes
place. As an Israeli woman, Nurit Peled-
Elhanan offered such an explanation after
her 14-year old daughter Smadar was killed
in the recent bombing in Jerusalem's' Ben
Yehuda Street. "The government breeds
the terrorists," Mrs. Elhanan said. "When
you put people under border closure, when
you humiliate, starve and suppress them,
when you raze their villages and demolish
their houses, when they grow up in... hold
ing pens, that's what happens."
The vast majority of Israelis and Pales
tinians supported the Oslo agreement and
its promise of peace between the two peo
ples. That promise began to fade almost as
soon as Prime Minister Netanyahu took
office and made clear his contempt for
Palestinian leaders and his unwillingness to
abide by the principle of land for peace.
His unilateral actions since then in viola
tion of Oslo have heightened suspicion and
mistrust between the two sides. Meanwhile
his government is preempting future nego
tiations on the return of West Bank territo
ry to the Palestinians and the future of
Jerusalem by increasing the Jewish popula

tion of these areas.
The United States has given Israel
unstinting support, including upwards of $4
billion a year in aid, but it's time we
replaced that commitment with a more
even-handed approach to the Middle East
conflict. After her recent trip to the Middle
East, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called on Israelis and Palestinians to take
"mutual responsibility for the peace pro
cess," as if there could be symmetry in a sit
uation where one side is able to exert near
total control over the other. Israel with its
thriving economy and a powerful armed
forces holds all the cards when it comes to
bargaining with the Palestinians.
Therefore, if the United States intends
to act as honest peace broker it must not
only demand that Yasser Arafat fight ter
rorism but also use whatever influence it
has, including the power of the purse, to
insist that Netanyahu abide by the terms of
the Oslo agreement and take the necessary
steps to allow Palestinians to live in dignity
and independence. Only then can there by
security and lasting peace for both peoples.
