# Foreign Bureau: Berlin
## Oktoberfest, for non-beer lovers 
### 
Marni Leff

lAM NOT entirely sure what it was that
made me decide that I absolutely had to
go to Oktoberfest. Last spring, shortly
after it was official that I would indeed
spend fall quarter in Berlin, I promised
myself that I'd be at Oktoberfest. And, for
whatever it's worth, I was there.
But now, safely back in Berlin and thinking
about the weekend, 1 am stuck wondering
exactly lured me to Oktoberfest. One thing is
for sure; I was not alone. Seven million people
flock to Munich for Oktoberfest each year.
That's not to say that I didn't have a good time
at Oktoberfest; in fact it was a pretty unbe
lievable few days.
Yet logically, looking back on the week
end, I realize that it was totally illogical. 1
woke up Friday morning at 530 a.m. to take a
bus then two subways to the train station. I
met up with six of my friends from the Stan
ford-in-Berlin Program.
We then spent seven hours on a train wind
ing our way though the German countryside,
southward toward Munich.
We spent another hour trying to figure out
the Munich subway system.
And then we spent yet another 45 minutes
trying to find our youth hostel. That got us to
Oktoberfest at around 7 p.m.

Oktoberfest itself was pretty cool. It was
a lot like a huge American carnival — com
plete with ferris wheel and cotton candy. It
differed in that its main attraction was the
temporary beer halls set up by various
breweries and in that those beer halls were
more than happy to serve beer to seven 20-
year-olds from the United States.
The beer halls, like Oktoberfest, were
also pretty cool. Traditional German bands
played what one might call "typical" Ger
man drinking music. But, in order get a seat
inside of a beer hall, one would have had to
make a reservation in February. So we
joined the masses, milling around beer gar
dens set up outside the tents, hoping to find
a table.
Unfortunately, finding a table proved
nearly impossible. We gave up on finding a
table at any of the popular breweries and
instead chose a smaller one. We had a pleas
ant evening, albeit a somewhat short.
It was nearly 9 p.m. when we finally sat
down, and Oktoberfest shuts down at 10 p.m.
By midnight we were back in our youth
hostel. As I got ready to go to sleep, a lit
tle voice started nagging me, and for the
first time I really began to wonder about
the logic of the excursion. I quieted my ris

ing doubts by promising myself that the
next day would be perfect. We planned to
see some of Munich and then head over to
Oktoberfest early enough to find a table at
one of the more lively breweries.
Munich lives up to its reputation of being
an extremely beautiful city. But with the mad
influx of tourists all biding their time until the
beer halls opened at 4 p.m., it was virtually
impossible to move, let alone see the city. I
did get a chance to buy some postcards
though. 1 decided to save for them for the
train ride home, so 1 could tell all my friends
about the fantastic time I was going to have
that night.
We started toward the festival area
around 3 p.m. By 5:30 p.m., we secured a
prime table at a prime brewery. By 6 p.m., we
had scared away the other people at the table
and all seven of us were comfortably sitting.
The waitress came around with several
one-liter mugs of beer for our little group.
I tried to psych the self up. After all this
was it. Here 1 was at Oktoberfest. I'd been
looking forward to this weekend for months,
and it was finally here. And now we were at
the Loewenbraeu tent, or rather just outside
it. Finally, I'd have material for those post
cards and this column. This would justify the

hours and hours spent on the train. This
would convince me that having gotten up the
previous morning before the sun was a wise
move.
I took a sip of my beer and then it hit me:
Palo Alto, Chicago, Munich, it doesn't matter
where I am. I really don't like beer.
1 have to confess, I felt a keen sense of dis
appointment. My friends all seemed to being
enjoying their beer. I took another sip, hoped
that my facial expressions would not give me
a way and joined in the conversation.
We sat for a while, and then I left with one
of my friends to do some scoping. We walked
for a while and rode the ferris wheel, a defi
nite highlight. When we returned to the
table, our friends were deeply engrossed in
conversation with four British guys and a
German man named Marcos and his girl
friend, Claudia.
With Marcos and Claudia, we practiced
our German. With the English guys, we sang
Beatles songs and Ux)k turns singing our
respective national anthems. The German
couple left. The English guys paid for a round
of beer.
We people watched. Ilie highlight: an
extremely drunk, older, German man walking
around in a leather bomber jacket and motor

cycle helmet. Instead of buying beer, the man
was cruising around from table to table, pour
ing the remnants of abandoned beer steins
into his own and striking up conversation with
anyone in his path.
I was watehing that man in his ridiculous
get-up do his thing when it hit me. Oktober
fest was not just about the beer. 1 knew when
1 made the plans with my friends to go to
Munich last spring, that it was highly unlikely
that over the summer I would suddenly devel
op a passion for beer.
Had Oktoberfest simply been about beer
for me, 1 could easily have spent the weekend
in Berlin. I would have saved obscene quanti
ties of travel time.
1 could have gone to a local brewery. I
would have been able to find a table much
more easily, and the beer undoubtedly would
have been a whole lot cheaper.
But Oktoberfest's about more than 14-plus
hours on a train and somewhere around 1(K)
Deutsche Marks (2(X) including the hostel).
It's about the experience — an experience
that will only be once-in-a-lifetime, but one
that I'm glad that I had nonetheless.

go to Oktoberfest. Last spring, shortly
after it was official that I would indeed
spend fall quarter in Berlin, I promised
myself that I'd be at Oktoberfest. And, for
whatever it's worth, I was there.
But now, safely back in Berlin and thinking
about the weekend, 1 am stuck wondering
exactly lured me to Oktoberfest. One thing is
for sure; I was not alone. Seven million people
flock to Munich for Oktoberfest each year.
That's not to say that I didn't have a good time
at Oktoberfest; in fact it was a pretty unbe
lievable few days.
Yet logically, looking back on the week
end, I realize that it was totally illogical. 1
woke up Friday morning at 530 a.m. to take a
bus then two subways to the train station. I
met up with six of my friends from the Stan
ford-in-Berlin Program.
We then spent seven hours on a train wind
ing our way though the German countryside,
southward toward Munich.
We spent another hour trying to figure out
the Munich subway system.
And then we spent yet another 45 minutes
trying to find our youth hostel. That got us to
Oktoberfest at around 7 p.m.

Oktoberfest itself was pretty cool. It was
a lot like a huge American carnival — com
plete with ferris wheel and cotton candy. It
differed in that its main attraction was the
temporary beer halls set up by various
breweries and in that those beer halls were
more than happy to serve beer to seven 20-
year-olds from the United States.
The beer halls, like Oktoberfest, were
also pretty cool. Traditional German bands
played what one might call "typical" Ger
man drinking music. But, in order get a seat
inside of a beer hall, one would have had to
make a reservation in February. So we
joined the masses, milling around beer gar
dens set up outside the tents, hoping to find
a table.
Unfortunately, finding a table proved
nearly impossible. We gave up on finding a
table at any of the popular breweries and
instead chose a smaller one. We had a pleas
ant evening, albeit a somewhat short.
It was nearly 9 p.m. when we finally sat
down, and Oktoberfest shuts down at 10 p.m.
By midnight we were back in our youth
hostel. As I got ready to go to sleep, a lit
tle voice started nagging me, and for the
first time I really began to wonder about
the logic of the excursion. I quieted my ris

ing doubts by promising myself that the
next day would be perfect. We planned to
see some of Munich and then head over to
Oktoberfest early enough to find a table at
one of the more lively breweries.
Munich lives up to its reputation of being
an extremely beautiful city. But with the mad
influx of tourists all biding their time until the
beer halls opened at 4 p.m., it was virtually
impossible to move, let alone see the city. I
did get a chance to buy some postcards
though. 1 decided to save for them for the
train ride home, so 1 could tell all my friends
about the fantastic time I was going to have
that night.
We started toward the festival area
around 3 p.m. By 5:30 p.m., we secured a
prime table at a prime brewery. By 6 p.m., we
had scared away the other people at the table
and all seven of us were comfortably sitting.
The waitress came around with several
one-liter mugs of beer for our little group.
I tried to psych the self up. After all this
was it. Here 1 was at Oktoberfest. I'd been
looking forward to this weekend for months,
and it was finally here. And now we were at
the Loewenbraeu tent, or rather just outside
it. Finally, I'd have material for those post
cards and this column. This would justify the

hours and hours spent on the train. This
would convince me that having gotten up the
previous morning before the sun was a wise
move.
I took a sip of my beer and then it hit me:
Palo Alto, Chicago, Munich, it doesn't matter
where I am. I really don't like beer.
1 have to confess, I felt a keen sense of dis
appointment. My friends all seemed to being
enjoying their beer. I took another sip, hoped
that my facial expressions would not give me
a way and joined in the conversation.
We sat for a while, and then I left with one
of my friends to do some scoping. We walked
for a while and rode the ferris wheel, a defi
nite highlight. When we returned to the
table, our friends were deeply engrossed in
conversation with four British guys and a
German man named Marcos and his girl
friend, Claudia.
With Marcos and Claudia, we practiced
our German. With the English guys, we sang
Beatles songs and Ux)k turns singing our
respective national anthems. The German
couple left. The English guys paid for a round
of beer.
We people watched. Ilie highlight: an
extremely drunk, older, German man walking
around in a leather bomber jacket and motor

cycle helmet. Instead of buying beer, the man
was cruising around from table to table, pour
ing the remnants of abandoned beer steins
into his own and striking up conversation with
anyone in his path.
I was watehing that man in his ridiculous
get-up do his thing when it hit me. Oktober
fest was not just about the beer. 1 knew when
1 made the plans with my friends to go to
Munich last spring, that it was highly unlikely
that over the summer I would suddenly devel
op a passion for beer.
Had Oktoberfest simply been about beer
for me, 1 could easily have spent the weekend
in Berlin. I would have saved obscene quanti
ties of travel time.
1 could have gone to a local brewery. I
would have been able to find a table much
more easily, and the beer undoubtedly would
have been a whole lot cheaper.
But Oktoberfest's about more than 14-plus
hours on a train and somewhere around 1(K)
Deutsche Marks (2(X) including the hostel).
It's about the experience — an experience
that will only be once-in-a-lifetime, but one
that I'm glad that I had nonetheless.

Marni Leff likes recycled beer even less
than fresh beer.
