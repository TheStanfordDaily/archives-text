Everyone at Stanford knows
how to study hard, but rarely does
one find students who approach
their studies in a healthy way.
Students often become so
wrapped up in studying that they
forget the importance of staying
healthy and its implications on the
quality of studying time.
One area in which many stu
dents are not practicing healthy
study habits is sleep. According to
Douglas Daher, a staff psychologist
for Student Health Services at
Cowell Student Health Center, stu
dents tend to be sleep deprived.
Although the amount of sleep a
person needs varies from individual
to individual, Daher said that a lack
of sleep will affect a student's "abil
ity to focus and to study."
He also added that sleep depri
vation is cumulative in that, "if you
do shortchange yourself, you have
to make it up."
An important point about
recovering from sleep deprivation
is that a person does not need to
exactly make up the same amount
of time they missed the previous
night. For example, if a person
needs eight hours and only gets
three one night, the next day the
person should sleep a few more
hours to make up for the loss,
though a full five hours extra is not

necessary.
Many people fight the urge to
sleep with coffee, but according to
Daher, "there is always a problem
with using a stimulant. Forming
habits of going beyond natural lim
its can be unhealthy."
Another problem students often
face when studying is the inability
to focus. Often, a student will find
himself staring at a page, reading
the same thing over and over with
out understanding it. When this
problem occurs, Daher suggests
that the students should take a
break for a few minutes.
"Do a journal, check in with
yourself for a few minutes and clear
away distraction. Don't ignore
competing drives," said Daher.
Another important component
to healthy studying is physical activ
ity. Incorporating physical activity
into a daily schedule makes a per
son more alert and can improve
studying efficiency.
Daher said that exercise is very
important and that students should
create an individual routine. He
added that it is important to sepa
rate exercise from athletics. Unlike
individual exercise, athletics often
involve other people, and it's diffi
cult to schedule athletic and group
activities into a particular schedule.
Daher suggested building individu
al activities into a routine such as


Vijay Myneni â€” Daily
walking or running every other day.
"Doing both athletics and exer
cise is great, but you have to make
sure you get enough," said Daher.
Students can also help to make
study time more effective by sepa
rating work from play. "People
should decide to work or to play.
Trying to work and wishing that you
were doing something else takes
away from working.
"Blowing off work and playing,
I hen feeling guilty about not work
ing detracts from play. If students
make a clear distinction between

when they are playing and working,
both become more effective,"
Daher said.
Another important way to be
come a healthier student is to eat
properly. Breakfast is an extremely
important meal, but it is often
skipped to get a few more minutes of
sleep. However, eating a nutritious
breakfast can help to keep a person
awake and alert during morning
classes.
Whether it's breakfast, exercise,
sleep or play that takes the back
burner in your study life, following
these simple tips can help to increase
the quality of your work without
sacrificing too much quantity in
terms of time spent studying.
