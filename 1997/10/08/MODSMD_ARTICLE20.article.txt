# Habits key to healthy computing
## 
### Daniel Wan Contributing writer 
As the new quarter kicks into
high gear, it is not uncommon for
students to spend more and more
time in front of a computer.
Whether it is programming soli
taire, surfing the World Wide Web
for the latest sports news, writing
that 10-page paper, or simply
checking e-mail, extended comput
er usage is a widespread health
concern. If vou feel either pain or
fatigue in your hands, wrists, arms,
upper back or neck, it could be
related to using a computer.
The most common problem
associated with computer overuse
is tendonitis. It typically results in
tendon inflammation and a local
ized pain in the elbow, forearm,
hand or wrist that ranges from
being merely annoying to causing
a decreased range of motion in
your arms.
Another problem caused by
computer overuse is carpal tunnel
syndrome. This causes swelling to
occur around a nerve passing
through the palm side of the wrist,
resulting in pain and a tingling sen
sation in the thumb and first three
fingers. Although carpal tunnel
syndrome occurs much less fre
quently than tendonitis, it is more
serious. If untreated, it may lead to
desensitization and decreased mus
cle bulk in the thumb area.
The feeling of discomfort expe
rienced during and after using a
computer usually results from poor
posture and keeping up repetitive
motions too long. There are things
that can be done to increase the
comfort level when using a com
puter and to prevent some of these
problems from ever developing.
First, break up the task. Instead
of spending hours doing one kind
of task and then switching to
another, spend less time on each by
alternating between them. Type a
little, read for a while and then
organize your notes. Also get up
and walk around for a few minutes
at least once every hour. During
this time, refrain from flexing the
hands and wrists.
It is also a gtxxJ idea to do some

stretching and relaxing during
these breaks. Roll your shoulders.
Hunch them as high as possible
before letting them relax. Rotate
your head slowly from one side to
the other, Uxiking over each shoul
der. Bend your neck slowly as if to
touch an ear to one shoulder, then
do the other side. Slowly press the
fingers of one hand back toward
the wrist with your other hand.
Hold this stretch briefly.
To make sure your posture is
correct, first sit with your hips at a

l X)-degree angle. Then arch your
back as much as possible until it
feels like you're sitting on the front
of your buttocks. Gradually ease
off from this arch until you're sit
ting on the middle of your buttocks
and the position feels comfortable.
ITiis is the "neutral" spine position.
It is also important not to slump.
The shoulders should not be
slouched forward or hunched up,
and the head should not be tilted
forward. The proper silting posi
tion should feel comfortable, not

rigid or tense. When bending to
reach something, hinge at the hips
instead of rounding your hack or
dropping your head forward. To
reduce eyestrain while using a
computer, have lighting that ade
quately illuminates the keyboard
and workstation.
Practicing these lips will help
prevent computer overuse injuries
from crippling your ability to do
work and make your computing
experiences a little healthier and
less uncomfortable.

Having good posture and typing habits can make computing less hazardous and much more effective.
