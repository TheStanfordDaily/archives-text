# Eating well on campus: ways to avoid nutrition problems
## Eating disorders spark concern 
### Charmain Tan 
"If I could only lose a couple of
pounds..Although this phrase is
commonplace in our image-con
scious society, for individuals with
eating disorders, it is a mantra with
potentially devastating conse
quences.
Eating disorders include the
severe food restriction and debili
tating weight loss condition seen in
anorexia nervosa, the binge-purge
condition of bulimia nervosa, com
pulsive eating and compulsive exer
cising.
The National Association of
Anorexia and Associated Disor
ders estimates that there are eight
million people who meet the crite
ria for an eating disorder in the
United States; of these, about 9()
percent are women.
These numbers only tell part of
the story as there are many more
women who suffer from "subclini
cal" eating disorders. These women
may not be diagnosed with an eat
ing disorder but are nevertheless
obsessively preoccupied with food.
Some experts project that at least
25 percent of college women
engage in some aspect of disor
dered eating while enrolled as col
lege students. The Stanford campus
is not immune to this dangerous
behavioral trend.
In fact, an informal survey of res
ident staff members at Stanford
dormitories indicated that there is a
developing problem with eating dis

orders among students at this cam
pus, said Angela Amarillas, student
project coordinator with Health
Promotion Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
The reasons for disordered eat
ing patterns vary among sufferers,
and no definitive answer can be
given for why an individual would
engage in this type of behavior. It is
clear that socio-cultural influences,
such as a strong cultural bias toward
thinness, play a role in its develop
ment.
In addition, many sufferers also
have low self-esteem and poor self
image. For these individuals,
restricting food intake is a "control
ling, affirming" experience, said
Amarillas. They feel "on top of the
world" because they are able to
exert control over their behavior.

One of the resources available to
Stanford students concerned about
their eating habits is BIFSE (Body
Image, Food and Self-Esteem),
which was founded in an effort to
combat the problem of eating disor
ders on campus. Its main focus is to
prevent and educate about eating
disorders and to discuss issues relat
ed to food and body image.
The complexity of the eating dis
order issue is probably most
poignantly reflected in a recent
study published in the journal
Health Psychology. The study sug
gested that programs such as
BIFSE may actually backfire.
Based on research conducted on
788 freshman women at Stanford,
the study found that women who
were exposed to eating disorder


Miler Lee — Daily
education programs were more like
ly to present symptoms consistent
with eating disorders than women
who did not attend such education
sessions.
BIFSE may have "inadvertently
reduced the stigma of eating disor
ders to such an extent that they were
normalized," according to the study.
Additionally, some members of the
audience would use panel discus
sions on eating disorders as a source
of "tips to becoming a successful
anorexic or bulimic."
However, the results of this study

do not mean that education pro
grams are not important, the authors
said. Instead, the results suggested
that separation of prevention and
treatment programs would be more
beneficial to susceptible individuals.
Another lesson learned from this
research was the "need to bring
awareness and skill-building to com
bat this problem," said Amarillas,
who is also an active BIFSE mem
ber. To this end, peer nutrition edu
cators are currently being trained to
give dorm presentations on such top
ics as "healthy eating" and "respon
sible weight management."
BIFSE also has plans for work
shops in the future on stress manage
ment and relaxation techniques.
