# Good food means good health for students

As we progress further and further into the school
year and begin to get buried under piles of problem
sets, programs and CIV reading, memories of home
grow fainter and fainter. It only gets worse as we file
into Stanford dining halls yet again, feeling that the
familiar smells of home cooking are far too distant.
People often joke about the quality of cafeteria food,
but looking around Housing and Dining Services, we
realize it isn't that bad at all. There is often a wide vari
ety of foods ranging from chicken stir-fry to tiramisu.
During lunch there is always the option of a burger fresh
off the grill; Sunday brunches sometimes means fresh
omelets and quesadillas. While many students fear gain
ing the "Freshman 15," it is really a matter of making
informed choices about what and how much to eat.
For instance, consider the breakfast cereals. Among
the favorites are Lucky Charms and Captain Crunch.
Unfortunately, both are high in sugar. Don't be fooled
by the healthy sounding name of Raisin Bran. It's also
high in sugar. The best bet is to stick to a bowl of corn
flakes or Crispix with skim milk. It's really a matter of
looking at your choices and choosing nutritionally. Next
time, instead of two helpings of the hot entree, try one
helping with a large portion of salad. Or, try the Rotis
serie chicken from the grill, which docs not contain as
much grease and fat.
For college students, the most important items to
think about are excessive fat, sugar and sodium intake.
There are several ways these levels can be lowered. By
steering away from fried meats, focusing on skinless
poultry and fish and toning down on butter and mar

garine, more nutritional value can be obtained from
food. Consuming less sugar by replacing soft drinks
wilh water and fruit juices is a good idea. Culling down
on sodium can he as simple as choosing fresh rather
than canned foods and tasting your food before salting
it.
With heavy schedules and mid-terms coming up, stu
dents may begin to notice that they consume more and
more snacks while working later hours. ITiis is caused
by stress-induced hormones that travel to the brain, cre
ating cravings. Don't try to fight your impulses just
be sure to stock up on more healthy snacks like rice
cakes, raisins or whole-grain bagels
It's important that students don't try to follow all
these suggestions at once. Changing eating habits can
be difficult. Try to see what fits and simply use common
sense. Hon appetit!

Eating on campus can be nutritious and healthy if
you know where to look and what to pick.
