## DOUBLE TROUBLE 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
They have been described as ying vs.
yang, power vs. speed and big vs. small.
Senior running backs Anthony Book
man and Mike Mitchell may have different
styles of play, but they do share at least one
thing in common — three consecutive 1(X)-
yard rushing games.
Mitchell, a fifth-year senior who is now
third on Stanford's all-time rushing list after
Saturday's win against Notre Dame, is a big
back known for his ability to break tackles
and grind out yardage.
Bookman, who is the fourth leading
rusher in Cardinal history, is smaller and re
lies on speed, often simply outrunning op
posing defenses for big gains.
Despite their differing talents, both have
had their share of success and difficulty in
their Stanford careers.
Mitchell arrived on the Farm in the fall
of 1993 from Phoenix, Ariz., and promptly
made his mark. In his first season in a Car
dinal uniform, Mitchell led the team in all

purpose running and kickoff return
yardage.
ITie following year, he seemed destined
for greatness. In the first two games of the
1994 campaign, he gained 311 yards on the
ground and recorded four touchdowns.
Then, early in the Cardinal's third game, an
ankle injury prematurely ended his year.
"1 was playing well and looking forward
to a great season, and everything came to a
halt," Mitchell said. "It makes you ap
proach it one game at a time. You have to
play every game like it is your last."
Ironically, what was such a disappointing
end for Mitchell's season turned into a gold
en opportunity for Bookman. After starting
the season third on the depth chart, injuries
to Mitchell and fullback Greg Cornelia gave
the freshman a chance to play, and he never
looked back.
Bookman started six games during the
1994 season and totaled 577 yards rushing
and seven touchdowns, the most for a Stan
ford running back since Darrin Nelson in
1977.
"As a freshman I was just happy to play,"

Most college football teams would
be happy to have one running
back rushing for 100 yards in three
straight games. In seniors Mike
Mitchell and Anthony Bookman,
Stanford has two.

Bookman said. "I had high expectations for
myself."

After leading the team in rushing again
in 1995, Bookman was given a reduced of
fensive load in 19% and gained only 274
yards : Mitchell, after suffering injuries
again in 1995, bounced back and enjoyed
his best season at Stanford, rushing for K()9
yards.
"I went home this past summer to get my
thoughts together," Bookman said. "I spent
some time with my family, worked out in the
Texas heat and really found a new focus. I

just had to try and come back and have a
good year."
Coming into this season, both backs had
something to prove. Bookman needed to
become a more patient running back, while
Mitchell wanted to show that last season
was no fluke.
"I was really excited about this year,"
Mitchell said. "I have had a lot of disap
pointments in my career. I put a lot of work
into the preseason just to be ready, and it
has been paying off."
The hard work that both men invested
has begun to yield handsome dividends.
Even though both backs have several 1 (Hi
yard rushing games under their belts,
they'd never rushed for KM) yards in the
same game before this season. But in the
last three contests, both have passed the
century mark, with Bookman compiling
412 yards and Mitchell racking up 346
yards over that stretch.
Although sharing a backfield could
cause tension between two star runners, it
has actually turned into a blessing for both
of them. Each player makes the other one

better, and they are not shy about who tie
serves the credit.
"We compliment each other so well,"
Bookman said. "Mitch is the one who wears
the defense down, and I am able to come in
and sometimes pop a big run because I am
fresh."
I hat was the formula that worked
against Notre I )ame, but like all equations,
this one can be flipped around as well.
"In some games, it was Hook who was
making the long runs, and I was the benefi
ciary of them being tired," Mitchell said.
"We compliment each other really well,
and that is why we have been successful so
far."
The IW7 campaign has seen both backs
reach top form, and not too soon for Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"Tt is* quite obvious that they both do a
great job," Willingham saicl. "We are very
pleased willi our running backs. At the be
ginning of the year we thought that it was
one of the strengths of our football team,
and it is now starting to live up to our ex
pectations."
