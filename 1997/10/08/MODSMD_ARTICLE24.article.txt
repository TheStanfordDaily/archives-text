# 1957: Stanford 14, Cal 12
## The 						Axe comes home Al's PAT's give Taylor his last victory, 14-12 
### Dick Barnes 
Editor's note: When Stanford
meets California Nov. 22 at Stan
ford Stadium, it will mark the 100 th
Big Game. To celebrate the history
of the cross-Hay rivalry, The Daily
will reprint stories of classic Big
Games, each with its original body
and headline. This week: the 60th
Big Game, played in 1957. A 14-12
Stanford win, it was the last game
for legendary Cardinal coach
Chuck Taylor.
The Axe is home!
Surrou- a by the melodrama
of a coach » last game and the
heroism of an injured senior who
provided the winning points when
he wasn't even supposed to play,
the Axe came back to Stanford as
the Indians won the Big Game
from California before 91 ,(KK) fans
here Saturday.
The score? Record books will
show it as 14-12. But so confused
was the final play of the 60th Big
Game that no one will ever know
whether the score was really 20-
12, or might have been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the
victorious Tribe — the 23 men
who played and the man who saw
his final game as a coach — Chuck
Taylor. And beyond these two
dozen was another corps of Stan
ford people who played a part in
the game — all the way from the
assistant coaches down to the Wa
terboys and back up again through
the rooting section, yell leaders,
pompon girls and band.
But the man to whom the victo

ry must have meant the most had
to be Chuck Taylor. Two days ear
lier, the announcement had been
made that Taylor was moving up
in athletic department administra
tion and would not be back to
coach in 1958

On the field, the most obvious
heroes were Al Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appeared
in the movies, it would he rejected
as ridiculous. And maybe it does
sound fantastic that the man who
was the victim of a conversion de
feat only three weeks ago should
return with his broken jaw wired
together and kick the two points
that gave his team the victory over
its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea — a rags
to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the
fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers
when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that
not a single official Stanford pic
ture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the
throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; un
doubtedly the best fullback in the
conference; and the proud holder
of 155 yards he gained in Satur

day's Big Game.
And there are plenty more on
the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60
minutes, scored a touchdown, and
directed his team's destiny all af
ternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked
Cal's first PAT try to provide half
the victory margin. Eric Frotiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball carrier
for the Cards
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one-touchdown favorite, but you
couldn't have proved it by the way
the game started....
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a few
seconds and just a couple of yards
behind the line of scrimmage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31....
But then the fumble favor was
returned as McMillin lost the ball
slanting over the right side of the
Cal line.

A penalty against Joe Kapp for
passing while he was beyond the line
of scrimmage nullified a 30-yard
gain for the Bears seven plays later,
and the eventual losers were forced
to punt.
On Stanford's first play after the
kick,Darrell Roberts.. .picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian 47
before he was stopped. Last year, he
had done virtually the same thing on
the last play of the first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a good
one, and was hauled in by McMillin
on the Stanford eight.
He went from his right to his left
and fooled the Bear defenders with a
fake reverse to Shea. McMillin then
whipped up the left sideline behind a

wall of blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMillin
was hit 51 yards later at Berkeley's4l.
Seven Plays Later
Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes to
his left. Proverb Jacobs is shaken off;
Terry Jones misses the tackle; Kapp
hits Shea head on, but Shea plows
through him; Hank Olguin tries for
the tackle, and he's pulled into the
end zone by Shea as the Cards get
their six points
Cal next got the ball on their 20
following a Shea punt (he did the
kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plays later, the
score was 7-6. The keys were a 16-
yarder by Jack Yerman, 12 on a delay
by Roberts, and a 23-yard Gabe Ar
rillaga-to-Ron Currie pass that put
the ball on the Stanford 3. Roberts
got the score over right tackle.

Maybe a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make a
rout of the thing. In 4:06, the Cards
moved 73 yards to another seven
points. The long-gainer was a 16-yard
keeper by Douglas that bailed the In
dians out of a 15-to-go situation.
Douglas also had the honor of scoring
the final Stanford touchdown of the
year, sneaking the three inches
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found itself
on Stanford's 44 following an 11-
yard-run by Hart and a 19-yard pass
from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three,
Kapp dropped way back to pass.
Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola all
alone at the 15. Glagola eluded Shea
at the three, and suddenly the game
was plenty c105e....

Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run out
the remaining 3:22, the Indians still
moved relentlessly toward the goal.
They got all the way to the one as
Douglas flipped to Stein on third
and-10.
By now, there were only 10 sec
onds left to play, and a good part of
the 91,000 were surrounding the
playing field. Time out even had to
be called to keep the fans from shak
ing down the goal posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
the line on a sneak. As he went for
ward. the fans swarmed all over the
field. Finally, after a three-minute
wait, the officials announced that
Douglas was six inches short of the
score. But how could they know with
the mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the
result was the same: The Axe is
where it belongs.
