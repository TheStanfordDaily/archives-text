# Osborn calms the waters
## "Grandpa" leads men's polo team

Iliey call him "Natron." I"hey
call him "Grandpa." He's the big
guy who gets in the face of the two
meter man on the opposing team
and a leader who calms the Cardinal
when things get too hectic.
Senior Nathan Osborn is to the
men's water polo team what an old
friend is to anyone: stable and there
when you need him.
Osborn, a defender, hails from
nearby Palo Alto, but he didn't go
directly from Palo Alto High to
Stanford. For such a short distance,
he has traveled a long road .
Osborn played for UC-San
Diego his freshman year and then
went on a two-year religious mission
to Vermont, Maine and New 1 lamp
shire. During that time, Osborn was
not able to train or even go for a
swim.
"Your job as a missionary is to
help people," Osborn said.
Last year was Osborn's first at
Stanford. He transferred after sit
ting out a season at UCSD. With

some mixed emotions, he left be
hind his teammates and headed
north.
The transition was a smooth one.
According to head coach Dante
Dettamanti, it was a good fit.
"We really needed a two-meter
defender. Nathan has great size and
good swimming ability," he said.
"An added plus is that he can also
shoot the ball from outside."

With OsborrTs outside shooting
comes his specialty, the surprise
shot, which is often unexpected not
ony by the other team's goalie, but
also by his own teammates.
I'.ven though Osborn is in a de
fensive position — the farthest from
the opponents' goal — he is still a
top scorer for the Cardinal, tied for

third on the team with eight goals in
nine games.
Once a bit of wild shooter, Os
born has really settled in.
"He has learned to control when
he takes a shot and he usually makes
it," Dettamanti said.
Aside from being one of the
team's top scorers, Osborn also
adds an element of leadership. This
would be his sixth year of college
had he gone straight through. He
plays down his role as a leader and
voice of reason, but will admit to
not having an inflammatory per
sonality and said that he tries to dif
fuse situations that could harm the
team.
" This team performs very well at
a high level of emotion, but when it
turns to frustration, selfishness sets

in, teamwork breaks up and you just
can't play as an individual (in water
polo) and get very far," Osborn said.
Water polo is very much a team
sport in Osborn's eyes, but it is also a
family sport. His sister Margaret is a
freshman on the women's team and
his brother Peter played his first two
years at Stanford and is now on a
mission of his own.
"It was awesome. Peter is one of
my best friends in the world," Os
born said of his chance to play on the
same team as his brother.
This is Osborn's final year and
final quarter. For him, everything re
ally has come together. He believes
this year his game is in top form and
that his understanding of his role has
increased. His coach shares the same
sentiments.
"Nathan doesn't do anything dra
matic," Dettamanti said, "but that's
OK. We have other guys who can do
that."
