Senior Nathan Osborn is to the
men's water polo team what an old
friend is to anyone: stable and there
when you need him.
Osborn, a defender, hails from
nearby Palo Alto, but he didn't go
directly from Palo Alto High to
Stanford. For such a short distance,
he has traveled a long road .
Osborn played for UC-San
Diego his freshman year and then
went on a two-year religious mission
to Vermont, Maine and New 1 lamp
shire. During that time, Osborn was
not able to train or even go for a
swim.
"Your job as a missionary is to
help people," Osborn said.
Last year was Osborn's first at
Stanford. He transferred after sit
ting out a season at UCSD. With

some mixed emotions, he left be
hind his teammates and headed
north.
The transition was a smooth one.
According to head coach Dante
Dettamanti, it was a good fit.
"We really needed a two-meter
defender. Nathan has great size and
good swimming ability," he said.
"An added plus is that he can also
shoot the ball from outside."

With OsborrTs outside shooting
comes his specialty, the surprise
shot, which is often unexpected not
ony by the other team's goalie, but
also by his own teammates.

fensive position — the farthest from
the opponents' goal — he is still a
top scorer for the Cardinal, tied for
