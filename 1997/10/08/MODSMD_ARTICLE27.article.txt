# Speech encourages doctors to retain compassion

Physicians should focus on nurturing and em
pathizing with their patients instead of staying
emotionally uninvolved, argued Dr. Sherwin Nu
land, surgery professor at Yale University, at Stan
ford's Medical Center last night.
Nuland's lecture topic was "Death and the
1 )octor: Hie Final Step in the Art of Healing." The
professor is most known for his best-selling book,
"How We Die," which received the 1994 National
Hook Award.
"We have become excellent physicians but in
adequate healers," Nuland said. "Better is the
healer, but he is forgotten in the biomedical tem
ples of science.
" I Tie agenda of our very best doctors... near
the end of life is very often... quite different from

the agenda of patients and families," Nuland ex
plained. "The art of dying is indeed the art of liv
ing, and a noble life equals a noble death."
The professor advised future physicians to
maintain their values — including compassion and
sympathy — from before their entrance into the
medical profession. He also counseled them to not
expect themselves to solve all problems, but to
simply embrace patients and not shy away from
emotional involvement.
Nuland related, through his own experiences,
how a physician soon treats patients less with em
pathy and "moral imagination" and more "as an
thropologically interesting specimens." Such a
lack of respect, he said, must be terminated in the
medical profession at large.
He said he believes this problem was caused
by the introduction and subsequent popularity

of penicillin, leading to the hierarchy of "our
government, pharmacies and universities for
which the medical industrial complex was estab
lished."
Nuland's address was the seventh annual
Jonathan J. King Lecture in honor of a man who,
before dying from cancer in 1991, specified the pa
rameters for the care of dying patients. A video
preceding Nuland's lecture described the life of
King through his own words, and visible tears were
shed by many audience members.
Nuland also wrote "Doctors: The Biography of
Medicine, The Wisdom of the Body," as well as nu
merous articles for several national magazines.
Nuland will speak again tonight at 5 p.m. at the
Lucie Stern Community Center in Palo Alto at a
community panel discussion entitled, "Advance
Directives: Honoring the Patient's Wishes."
