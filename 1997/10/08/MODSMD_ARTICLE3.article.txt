## ASSU's first meeting stresses cooperation 
### Allison Hays Saurabh Prakash Contributing writers 
In this academic year's inaugural meeting,
the ASSU Senate stressed cooperation, dedi
cation and an end to internal feuding for the
upcoming year.
Senate Chair Joseph Freund, a junior,
began by calling for "less quibbling over per
sonal disagreements."
This year's senate should strive to produce
tangible results, said Senate Deputy Chair
Matt Spence, a sophomore.
"We want the senate working with the ad
ministration and professors," he said.
The only major legislation passed was to
create the ASSU internship program, which is
designed to allow more students, particularly

freshmen, to participate in the ASSU. Interns
will perform office tasks for senators, including
conducting legislative research.
"Many freshman have wanted to be in
volved in the ASSU — they have slipped
through the cracks." Freund said. "There's no
reason why someone with effort and ability
should not participate in the ASSU."
Applications for the internship program are
due this Friday and interviews for the posts will
be conducted this Sunday. Already, 140 stu
dents have expressed interest, according to
Spence.
Much of the session focusi I on the Task
Force for Undergraduate Fducation, a com
mittee Spence co-chairs with ASSU Vice Pres
ident Ben Decker, a senior. The three main
goals of this new committee are to
create a course guide for undergrad
uates, increase the number of teach
ing awards and decrease class size for
freshmen.
I he course guide will describe the
quality and difficulty of a course and
its professors. The task force wishes
to obtain the information from
course evaluations that students fill
out at the end of each quarter. Cur

rently, all quantitative data is with
held from students. Hie Faculty Sen
ate has yet to approve the release of
this confidential data, and Decker is
hoping for their cooperation.
"If the Faculty Senate is not will
ing to help, we're willing to go to
classes with forms of our own," Fre
und said.
Another objective of the task
force is to expand teaching awards
and increase publicity for award
nominations. The plan is to include
awards for teaching assistants as well
as professors.
"Good TAs are not recognized

even though they work hard and
have more contact with the stu
dents," Decker said.
Lastly, the task force will attempt
to address the problem of large class
sizes, particularly for introductory
freshman courses. According to
Spence, the committee hopes to
place a size limit — projected at 200
— on such classes and increase pro
fessor-student interaction.
The meeting last night was held in
Toyon lounge in an effort to attract
the dorm's residents to the meeting.
"We want to have a more person
al ASSU; we want to get out to

dorms and we want more students to
come to meetings," said ASSU Pres
ident Emily Andrus, a senior.
However, some students said
they felt more annoyed than includ
ed.
"I find it inconvenient and terri
bly distressing that a supposedly de
mocratic body would tyrannically
take over our student lounge," said
Junior Nathan Folkert, a Toyon res
ident.
Most students, though, said they
were indifferent to the ASSU's use
of their lounge, and none appeared
to have stayed to watch the meeting.
