At its first meeting of this academic year,
Stanford's Board of Trustees discussed the
University's finances, after which the
board's chair, Robert Bass, concluded the
school is "an incredibly strong position."
With last year's annual gift report reach
ing $312 million, the University is financial
ly sound, said Bass. Despite reports of rela
tively low endowments, Bass said he is con
fident in the University's ability to continue
to bring in money from other sources.
In other business, the board ratified an
earlier ad hoc committee vote approving
the merger of the Stanford Medical Center
and the UC-San Francisco Medical Center.
" This was a two-year process," said Bass.

" The most exciting part of this is that the
medical sides of two universities are coming
together. With the change in the health care
industry, it is necessary that health care en
tities combine to compete better."
The board also elected two new trustees,
venture capitalist Burton J. McMurty and
the co-founder of the Stanford in Washing
ton Program, Vicki Post Sant.
McMurtry â€” who earned his master's
and doctoral degrees in electrical engineer
ing from Stanford in 1959 and 1962 respec
tively, is currently a director of several Sili
con Valley companies, including Intuit.
Sant earned her bachelor's degree in his
tory from Stanford in 1961. She lives in
Washington, D.C., where she is President
of the Summit Charitable Foundation, Inc.
Two board members were also
re-elected. Trustees Doris F. Fish
er and Gregor G. Peterson will

continue to serve on the Board of
Trustees for five more years.
Fisher, who graduated from
Stanford in 1953 with a bache
lor's in economics, is co-founder
and merchandising consultant of
The Gap, Inc. in San Francisco.

Peterson, who earned his
MBA in 1959 from Stanford, is a
private investor and has co
founded and served as Vice
Chairman, President and CEO
and Directory of Hogan Systems,
Inc.
