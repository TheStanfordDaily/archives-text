# Plans scrapped for mall movie theater
## 
### Jennie Berry 
In what will surely be a disappointment to Stanford movie buffs,
plans for a new movie theater in the Stanford Shopping Center
have been canceled due to a cut in mall expansion space.
In a July meeting, members of the Palo AJto City Council voted
to decrease the space allotted for the Sand Hill Road expansion
from 160,000 square feet to 80,000 square feet, necessitating the
cancellation of theater plans. Stanford agreed to this cut in order to
receive the council support for its plan.

'Once it became clear we were not getting...
160,000 square feet, we stopped the discussion.'

"Once it became clear we were not getting anything close to
160,000 square feet, we stopped the discussion [about the theater],"
said Curtis Feeny, executive vice president for real estate at the
Stanford Management Co.
According to Feeny, the shopping center could not afford to
subsidize a theater without the extra space.
Larry Horton, Stanford's director of government and commu
nity relations, agreed that keeping the movie theater in the 80,000
square feet would not be "a good business decision." He explained
the shopping center wants to maximize income, and a movie the
ater is not the best money-maker.
Feeny emphasized the proposed plans for a theater were never
definite. Not having the theater is "maintaining the status quo," he
said.
There are only three movie theaters in Palo Alto: the two
screen Aquarius Cinemas, the Stanford Theater on University
Ave., and the Palo Alto Square Theatre, which may be closing in
the near future.
The proposed movie theater is just one of many controversies
surrounding the Sand Hill project. Residents will decide between
two Sand Hill expansion plans in the Nov. 4 public referendum.
Stanford and the Palo Alto City Council support Measure O.
Passage of this measure would expand the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter and build staff and senior citizen housing. Measure O also calls
for the expansion of Sand Hill Road and Quarry Roads to four
lanes and for intersections for both with El Camino Real.
