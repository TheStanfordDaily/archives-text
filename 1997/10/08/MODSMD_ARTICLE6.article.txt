# A
						friend in need
## Students volunteer health services in Latin America 
### Julia Beeson 
For the past few summers, a hand
ful of Stanford students have been
learning what it means to be a friend,
in every sense of the word. These stu
dents are members of Amigos de las
Americas, an international organiza
tion that recruits, trains and places
volunteers in summer public health
projects in Latin America.
While providing services such as
community sanitation, dental hygiene,
housing construction, immunization
and latrine construction, the program
offers its volunteers first-hand experi
ences in career paths such as public
health, medicine, environmental edu
cation and international relations.
For the last three summers, sopho
more Jacquie Pratt has traveled to
Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico

with the program.
"One of the great things about
Amigos is that every experience is to
tally different, and every year I learn
new things about myself," said Pratt,
who is the current campus training di
rector.
Volunteers work closely with the
natives, eating the local diet and par
ticipating in village life. "In Ecuador,
my [field] partner and I helped the
women bake bread every few days,
and while we waited for the rolls to
rise, the women told us stories about
the town and their Quichua roots,"
Pratt recalled.
Sophomore Sarah Jones first
learned of the program when veteran
volunteers came to her high school to
recruit new volunteers. In the sum
