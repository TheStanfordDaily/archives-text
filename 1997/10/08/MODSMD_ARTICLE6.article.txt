# A 						friend in need
## Students volunteer health services in Latin America 
### Julia Beeson 
For the past few summers, a hand
ful of Stanford students have been
learning what it means to be a friend,
in every sense of the word. These stu
dents are members of Amigos de las
Americas, an international organiza
tion that recruits, trains and places
volunteers in summer public health
projects in Latin America.
While providing services such as
community sanitation, dental hygiene,
housing construction, immunization
and latrine construction, the program
offers its volunteers first-hand experi
ences in career paths such as public
health, medicine, environmental edu
cation and international relations.
For the last three summers, sopho
more Jacquie Pratt has traveled to
Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico

with the program.
"One of the great things about
Amigos is that every experience is to
tally different, and every year I learn
new things about myself," said Pratt,
who is the current campus training di
rector.
Volunteers work closely with the
natives, eating the local diet and par
ticipating in village life. "In Ecuador,
my [field] partner and I helped the
women bake bread every few days,
and while we waited for the rolls to
rise, the women told us stories about
the town and their Quichua roots,"
Pratt recalled.

volunteers came to her high school to
recruit new volunteers. In the sum

mer of 1995, Jones went to Hon
duras to work on a community san
itation project.
Jones lived in a village of 16 fam
ilies and worked with the inhabi
tants to build latrines and start a
community health campaign on san
itation, family health, dental health
and environmental education.
This past summer, Jones re
turned to Honduras as a field super
visor, overseeing the volunteers
and projects in four villages.
"The most valuable aspect of my
involvement with Amigos has been
all of the people I have met through
the organization. 1 have made many
friends in the countries I have
worked in and with other Amigos
volunteers," Jones said.
On returning to Honduras for a
recent visit, Jones discovered that

her host family had named two
newborn twins after her and her
field partner.
Like Jones, junior Ben Cain said
he most values the friends he has
made through the program as well
as the way in which his experiences
have directed his life.
"I'm most likely a pre-med Latin
American studies major, which es
sentially means that I'm trying to do
Amigos for the rest of my life," Cain
said.
In his first summer with the pro
gram, Cain spent eight weeks in
Costa Rica, where he lived in the
northern jungle in a town of about
1(X) people. There, he helped con
struct housing for teachers.
Two summers ago, Cain served
as field manager in Michoacan,
Mexico, where he worked on a
community sanitation project. Cain
helped build latrines, plant trees,
distribute toothbrushes and give
presentations on HIV and AIDS.

"There are tons of experiences
that impress themselves upon you.
Amigos has a tendency towards in
tense, very packed summers," Cain
said.
All volunteers receive instruc
tion in the areas of rural communi
ty health, cross-cultural sensitivity
and leadership development during
the school year.
From November to June the vol
unteers learn everything from
Spanish and cultural sensitivity to
technical information about latrine
construction, immunizations and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
Jones said.
As village health workers, vol
unteers learn the technical skills
needed to implement a community
based health project and to work
with village leaders.
For those interested, an Amigos
representative will be recruiting
new volunteers Friday in White
Plaza.
