# No student section tickets remain for 100th Big Game
## Athletics Dept. expects to sell-out all sections, experiences best ticket sales of this decade 
### Megan Fuller-Deets 
Students who don't yet have tickets for the Big
Game may find themselves sitting far from their fel
low students when Nov. 22 rolls around.
The 4,000 seats in the student seating section of the
stadium are sold out, either through season tickets or
individual Big Game tickets. While some of the
25,000 tickets allotted for Stanford fans remain, the

Department of Athletics is expecting a complete sell
out.
"We're thrilled with ticket sales [this year]" said
Gary Migdol, assistant athletic director.
This year's overall ticket sales are perhaps the
highest of the decade and student ticket sales may be
the highest ever, Migdol said. I"he phenomenal sales
are in marked contrast to past years.
The last Big Game held at Stanford, in IW*>, had

13,(XX) seats left unsold three weeks before the game.
With six weeks left until the l(X)th Hig Game, only
hundreds remain of the 25,(XX) allotted to Stanford,
according to Fennie Lunberg, director of ticket sales.
Lunberg said she hopes the high number of sales is
attributable to a resurgence in interest in Stanford
football. I"he team's winning record, high number of
returning players and many home
games have contributed to a much
larger fan base this year, she said.
In response to dwindling tickets
sales in the past, the ticket office has
also increased marketing and hired
more staff members, she said.
And, of course, it is the 100 th an

niversary of the Big Game. An inde
pendent marketing firm, Dolich and
Sign, has been hired to plan the
events for the day and, although not
all the events are fully planned yet,
Migdol said he hopes the day will be
a football "extravaganza."
Students who still need tickets
can buy season tickets for $35 which
gain admission to the remaining
three home games, Lunberg said.
However, students buying season

tickets now will be assigned seats in
the general-admission section of the
stadium.
Because of the high number of
tickets already sold, most of the re
maining seats are located predomi
nantly within the first five rows, the
end zone or corners of the stadium,
she said. Although general-admission
seating is usually open, the seats are
assigned for the Big Game. The game
kicks off at 12:30 p.m. Nov. 22.
