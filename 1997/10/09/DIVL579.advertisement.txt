The innovative spark
flashes daily at GE.
Jack Welch, Chairman it CKO
Thomas Edison's innovative spark led to the creation of General Klectric more than
100 years ago. The same spark is alive and thriving today. Our people and our team
environment are the primary reasons. We have an open forum - a learning culture -
without boundaries or barriers. A place where ideas are born, heard, and allowed to
flourish. A place where people are continually exposed to new experiences and
world-class training programs.
The results are astounding. GE holds more patents than any other US company and is
a global leader in each of its twelve businesses. Operating in more than 100 countries,
we're the first corporation in the world to exceed $200 billion in market value.
If you are a bachelor's or master's degree candidate and have a thirst for new ideas,
solid academic performance and demonstrated leadership potential, come create
your own sparks at GE! An Equal Opportunity Employer.
We bring good things to life.
