## Stanford reps solicit faculty response on Sand Hill initiative 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Stanford representatives have asked all 1,600 faculty
and staff living in Palo Alto to tell them whether they
favor, oppose or are undecided on the University's ballot
initiative to expand Sand Hill Road.
Those who did not respond to the initial letter, sent
two weeks ago through interdepartmental mail, received
an e-mail soliciting their position on Measure O.
Coordinated through the Office of Government and
Community Relations, the letters were signed by two
professors and two staff members representing a 28-
member volunteer committee.
The University is attempting to determine how best to
spend its resources educating Palo Alto residents for the
Nov. 4 election, but some faculty and staff consider the
solicitation an invasion of privacy.
"It's a simple political matter: for those who have
made up their minds in opposition you don't want to
spend time trying to change their minds," said Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni, one of the chairs of the committee.
"For those undecided, you'd like to provide them with
more information to help them make up their minds."
Stanford's Measure O would widen Sand Hill and
Quarry Roads, build housing alongside Sand Hill and ex
pand the Stanford Shopping Center by 80,000 square
feet. The alternative Measure M puts limits on Universi
ty expansion, mandating that Sand Hill Road not exceed
three lanes. The University has said it will not pursue
Sand Hill Road expansion should Measure O fail.
In addition to garnering a majority of votes, Measure
O must receive more votes than M to be enacted.
Because of the complexity of the two measures, the
University has spent countless hours attempting to edu
cate Palo Alto residents through events in local neigh
borhoods, lawn signs and the volunteer committee's let-
ter, sent with an informational
brochure.
The request for individual views
is more controversial. The Universi
ty last December revised a directive
on political activities to allow for per
missible political activities and lob
bying by the University. The Com
puter Security and Network Use
Policy, however, prohibits solicita
tions using e-mail.
"Solicitations" refers to "funds,"
said Stephen Hansen, the Universi
ty's computer security officer."I
looked at it carefully because I didn't
want [the committee] to go out and
do something in violation of the Uni
versity's policies. I don't see [a viola
tion]."
Some faculty and staff, however,
considered the solicitation to be an
intrusion into their personal beliefs

on non-academic matters.
"I have a personal policy of not
discussing political issues with ran
dom people who call up on the tele
phone or on e-mail," said Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Howard Zebker. "It has nothing to
do with my position. The last time I
checked we had a secret ballot in this
country.
"But I don't hold it against the
University for doing this," he added.
Simoni acknowledged that em
ployees might feel intimidated but
said it is "unthinkable" that the Uni
versity would exploit the informa
tion.
"It's inconceivable that [employ
ees will] be made to suffer in some
way," he said.
"We would like to be the least in
trusive. But political campaigns are,
by nature, boisterous and obtru
sive," said Larry Horton, director of
government and community rela
tions.

This is the first time in its history
that the University has been so
prominently involved in an election.
University officials say the road ex
pansions will reduce traffic in the
area, improve access to Stanford
Medical Center and create badly
needed housing for Stanford em
ployess. Revenues to cover the more
than $300 million plan will come
chiefly from rent on both the housing
and the additional space in Stanford
Shopping Center.
Initially, the University had
hoped that the expansion plan would
be approved by the Palo Alto City
Council without going to ballot. But
because the City Council chose to
put the measure to a referendum,
Stanford will do all it can to ensure
the passage of Measure O, Horton
said.
"I wish we weren't in the cam
paign," he said. "We will do what we
can do with as much sensitivity [to
our employees] as we can."
