Stanford representatives have asked all 1,600 faculty
and staff living in Palo Alto to tell them whether they

more information to help them make up their minds."

Because of the complexity of the two measures, the
University has spent countless hours attempting to edu

borhoods, lawn signs and the volunteer committee's let-
