## Fundraisers will testify 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two
Democratic fund-raisers are pre
pared to testify that irregularities
involving foreign money and straw
donors began during the 1992
election that brought President
Ginton to power, a House investi
gator said yesterday as he began a
new round of public hearings.
Opening the House's version
of Congress' hearings on fund
raising abuses, Rep. Dan Burton,
R-lnd., announced the coopera
tion offer from fund-raisers Gene
and Nora Lum, who themselves
pleaded guilty to fund-raising
wrongdoing earlier this year.
"It appears ... the seeds of

today's scandals may have been
planted as early as 1991," Burton
declared.
Democratic Rep. Paul Kan
jorski of Pennsylvania retorted
that the Republicans were reach
ing conclusions "before the evi
dence is in."
Burton said the Lums were
prepared to testify — in exchange
for immunity from prosecution —
that the Clinton campaign wrote a
letter endorsing the candidacy of
the leader of an Asian country in
1992 in exchange for a $50,(KX)
contribution — possibly foreign
money — to a Democrat-affiliat
ed group the Lums had formed.

I"he country was not named.
The I.urns will also disclose
financial help offered by the
Riady family of Indonesia and
fund-raising irregularities com
mitted with the knowledge of the
Democratic National Committee,
Burton said.
The announcement capped a
whirlwind day in the investiga
tions during which former White
House deputy chief of staff
Harold Ickes gave a feisty defense
of the Democratic fund raising he
orchestrated from the White
House and senate hearings turned
even more rancorous than they
had been.
