# Wall Street shivers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said yesterday the econ
omy has been on an "unsustainable
track," sending shivers through
Wall Street. Stock prices slumped
after his comments, though they
regained some ground later.
In closely watched testimony
before Congress, Greenspan said it
would be "unrealistic" to expect
stock market gains anywhere near
those of the past two years.
And hinting of possibly higher
interest rates, Greenspan said grow
ing demand for scarce labor could
drive up wages, and eventually con
sumer prices, and that risks short
circuiting the economy's 6 1/2-year
old expansion.
"A re-emergence of inflation is,
without question, the greatest
threat to sustaining what has been a
balanced economic expansion virtu
ally without parallel in recent
decades," he told the I louse Budget
Committee.

The stock market's most
watched barometer slumped in
response, even though, as usual, the
central bank chairman left vague
the timing of any interest-rate
increase aimed at cooling specula
tion on Wall Street and inflation
pressures on Main Street.
The Dow Jones average shed
115 points immediately after
Greenspan spoke. It closed down
83.25 points at 8,095.06. Bond
prices plunged, too. I'he yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond, consid
ered a benchmark for mortgage
rates, jumped from a 20-month
low of 6.23 percent on Tuesday to
6.37 percent yesterday. The yield
moves in the opposite direction
from prices.
Greenspan's latest comment
raises the specter of significantly
smaller increases rather than a
steep plunge in prices.
"It clearly would be unrealistic
to look for a continuation of stock
market gains of anything like the

magnitude of those recorded in the
past couple of years," he said.
The Dow average had soared 26
percent in l l >% and, before yester
day's pullbaek, it had risen 27 per
cent this year, just 1 percent short of
the record high established Aug. 6.
"I'm sure he believes the market
is overvalued, that there are specu
lative excesses developing," said
economist Mark Zandi of Regional
Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa. "He said that point
blank almost a year ago and got so
much grief that now he's being a lit
tle more circumspect."
In his remarks, Greenspan ana
lyzed what he sees as the most like
ly source of inflationary pressures:
the labor market.
"To be sure, job growth slowed
significantly in August and Septem
ber, but it did not slow enough," he
said. "The performance of labor
markets this year suggests the econ
omy has been on an unsustainable
track."
