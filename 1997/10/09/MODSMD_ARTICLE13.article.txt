# Sergeant major heads to trial

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Sgt.
Maj. of the Army Gene McKinney,
the service's top enlisted soldier,
was ordered yesterday to face a
general court-martial on sexual
misconduct charges involving accu
sations by six women.
No trial date was set. The Army
asked that McKinney he arraigned
as soon as possible on 20 counts of
misconduct.
McKinney has maintained he is
innocent. He remains suspended
from his duties as sergeant major of
the Army and is assigned to nearby
Fort Myer, Va., where he has been

working on his
legal defense.
Hie case, which
started with sexual
misconduct accu
sations by a for
mer aide, retired
Sgt. Maj. Brenda
I loster, has been a
source of enor-

mous embarrassment for the Army,
which has contended this year with
a string of sexual harassment and
abuse cases.
Charles (iittins, McKinney's
civilian defense attorney, said in a

telephone interview broadcast by
MSNBC that he and McKinney
were disappointed in the court-mar
tial decision, but that it was no sur
prise.
"I think it would be very diffi
cult for a convening authority not
to send a case to trial after hav
ing spent more than $ 100,000
investigating it, and having six
women make allegations against
the sergeant major of the Army,
regardless of whether or not the
convening authority believed the
allegations," Charles Gittins
said.
