IRISH EYES haven't been smiling this
week, and it is not solely because of
Stanford's decisive defeat of Notre
Dame on the gridiron Saturday.
Many Notre Dame fans and some
members of the Stanford community were
offended by the Stanford Band's half-time
show, which unfortunately centered
around old stereotypes rather than old
fashioned college rivalry.
During the half-time show the Band
cracked jokes not only about Notre
Dame's mascot, the Fighting Irish, but
also about Irish culture and history.
Referring to Notre Dame's team as "the
blightin' Irish," they suggested that the
Irish have "a sparse cultural heritage"
consisting "only of fighting, then starv
ing."
Additionally, some Catholics were
offended by the pre-game show that
poked fun at the Catholic Church's rejec
tion of scientific theories and by the fact
that the Tree wore a nun's habit and that
a band member was dressed as the Stan
ford "Cardinal."
While we recognize that carefree and
at times irreverent behavior is intrinsic to
and often one of the most enjoyable
aspects of the Band, we believe that last
weekend's show went too far and dis
played poor judgment.
Although we believe that the Band did
not maliciously intend to ridicule Irish
culture, the numerous ambiguities in the
script that slipped through the editing
process resulted in such an outcome.
The show also reflected poorly on the
Athletic Department's Public Affairs

Office, which is responsible for reviewing
the Band's script each week.
Clearly the review mechanism,
designed for the purpose of preventing
situations like this from occurring, failed
and thus merits reconsideration.
The performance also reflected poorly
on the University. For many of the oppos
ing team's fans, their sole exposure to
Stanford is through the team and the
Band. And it is a shame that as a result of
this weekend's occurrence, many Notre
Dame fans walked away with the impres
sion that Stanford is not the tolerant and
open community we try to present.
While the Band claims that in its 34-
year history it has "lampooned" the
Amish, Buddhists, Trojans, Republicans,
Democrats, etc., such "equal opportuni
ty" satire does not provide an acceptable
rationale or excuse for such a program.
Moreover, the Band's past history of
issues with Notre Dame, most notably an
incident at an away game that resulted in
the Band being temporarily banned from
Notre Dame Stadium, should have cued it
that this weekend's crowd was more than
likely to misinterpret jokes that the Band
may have perceived as being within the
pervue of an acceptable program.
While we believe that the Band is ulti
mately responsible for its own actions, on
behalf of the entire Stanford community,
it might behoove them to act with greater
discretion and sensitivity in the future.
We believe that is possible for the
Band to achieve its objective of entertain
ing its audience without distinctly insult
ing a particular culture.
