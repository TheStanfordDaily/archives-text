## The 						fall line-up: I want my Grad TV 
### 
THE NEW prime
time fall season is
upon us, and once
again I am frustrated and
outraged by the network
executives' egregious and
outrageous omission.
Sure, I, like many of you,
look forward to being

"Welcomed Home" to enjoy my "Back-to-
Back" "Must-See-TV" (1 mean, I do have
billions of brain cells, right?).
And there's plenty of great stuff to tune
in for this year: the drama of "NYPD Blue,"
the comedy of "Friends," the creepiness of
"The X-Files," the humor 0f... of some
thing-or-other on The WB, I'm not exactly
sure.
However, with nearly 300 hours of week
ly, primetime, network programming to fill,
they couldn't schedule one program about
graduate students? By the way, I checked:
much to my surprise, "Unhappily Ever
After," "Clueless" and "Just Shoot Me" are
in fact not about graduate school.
There are somewhere in the neighbor
hood of two million graduate students in
American higher education, and yet not a
single television program about them.
That's two million more folks than there
have been homeboys in outer space, and yet
they had their own show. I say, if the teenage
witches, the vampire slayers, the Texas
rangers, and the Tom Arnolds of the world
are getting shows, why aren't graduate stu
dents?
Shows about higher education are not
strangers to the airwaves. When there have
been television shows set on a college or uni
versity campus, however, they typically
focus on undergraduate life: "Class of '96,"
"Freshman Dorm," "Saved by the Bell: The
College Years" and "Delta House" (all of

which lacked central graduate student char
acters, all of which were quickly canceled...
coincidence?).
Disregarding graduate students is not
only wrong, but patently unrealistic. Surely,
none of us can think of a university where
graduate student issues and concerns are
overshadowed by those of the undergradu
ates. That would be silly.
When graduate students are depicted on
television, more often than not they are
rather pathetic creatures.
On "Party of Five, " graduate student
"Kirsten" inadvertently plagiarizes part of
her dissertation and her committee revokes
her Ph.D.; on "Cheers" perennial graduate
student / waitress "Diane" annoys all the bar
regulars with her obtuse theories and pseu
do-intellectual remarks; on "Beverly Hills,
90210" graduate student TAs seduce the
students in their sections.
Based on such representations, you'd
think we were all neurotic, sexually-aggres
sive, reference-citing drones (Newman,
K.M., 19%, "Poor, Hungry and Desperate?
Or Privileged, Histrionic, and Demanding?"
Social Text 49, Vol 14, No. 4, Winter 1996.
Duke University Press).
A g(K>d television program about gradu
ate school might not only correct these
prevalent misconceptions, but might also
actually attract people to pursue post-bac
calaureate studies by presenting the exciting
and glamorous life of graduate students.
There has been a long history of televi
sion programming influencing the career
choices of the country's populace. Yes, a TV
show could do for graduate school what
"CHiPs" did for highway patrol officers,
what "LA Law" did for lawyers and what
"Baywatch" did for plastic surgeons.
Perhaps we could start small. An existing
television show could be relocated onto a

university campus.
Why not "Caroline in the Quad" (Caro
line enrolls in a graduate art program at
Stanford in hopes of developing the next
"Wilbur Hall" or "Rhymes with Orange").
How about "Ms. Quinn, Medicine
Woman, ABD" (Jane Seymour's character
"Mike" thought a diphtheria epidemic was
her most formidable challenge, that is until
she faced a faculty committee unwilling to
sign off on her dissertation)?
And why not replace "E.R." with a pro
gram called "T.A." ("John Carter" serves as
a teaching assistant for "Dr. Benton", and
learns to balance his office hours and teach
ing responsibilities with his own dissertation
research, while still raising his kids in gradu
ate student housing ["Get me five cc's of Jolt
Cola, STAT!"]).
Eventually, if such shows were broadcast
we might get representations of graduate
students as a diverse group, who manage to
eke out an existence on campus among
coursework, assistantships and the basic
challenges of everyday life.
Perhaps we might even see graduate stu
dents as people who work with professors to
teach undergraduates to write and think and
do research.
Maybe they would even portray graduate
students as academics-in-training, doing
research and attempting to find an intellec
tual home within the ivory tower.
But until then, tune in next week when
my wacky neighbor and I inherit an ancient
amulet and must spend a night sleeping in
the haunted residence hall to break the
curse.
