Education at its finest
Scene 1: "Stanlordland." It's every col
lege kid's dream. We live in the sunshine,
work some, play some more and interact
with amazing people.
But underneath it all, we know why
we're paying a hundred-grand to be here:
each of us, in some form or another, wants
to get an exceptional education.
If we didn't care enough to want one, we
a) probably wouldn't have gotten in, and b)
would be somewhere that was a lot less
expensive... Or so I thought.
Scene 2: Econ 1. Packed to the hilt.
Every financially-focused freshmen pouring
into the doors of Kresge Auditorium, ready
to soak up the last ounce of renowned Prof.
John Taylor's lecture on marginal costs and
deadweight losses.
As 1 do every year when 1 return to
Stanford, I feel a rash of gratitude and pride
that I am part of an institution dedicated to
discovery, teaching and the spread of
knowledge.
And this is why even now I am appalled
and disgusted as I think back to the joke of
a class-section 1 attended last week ...
Scene 3: The Quad. I am sitting in a
classroom comprised mostly freshmen, a
couple of upper-class students and our TA.
I feel, however, like I've been time-warped
back to junior high.
Instead of an educated grad student
standing in front of us, we've inherited a

blubbering, scatter-brained, soft-spoken
substitute teacher. And the students are on
the prowl.
Everyone talks at once, either trying to
figure out the
ill-explained concepts on his or her own or
mumbling snide and unflattering comments
about the teacher under his or her breath.
There is one particularly obnoxious male
student who has captured the attention of
all the giggling girls by looking directly at
the teacher and commenting with a straight
face on his poor teaching skills — just audi
bly enough to be heard by an attentive lis
tener above the dull roar of the class.
Everyone else is either shaking his or her
head at the teacher or contemplating how
to get out of this unfortunate situation...
I can't believe what 1 am witnessing. I
am sure all these people had high SAT
scores; I am sure all of them were at the top
of their classes. I also bet they spent a
decent amount of time grinding out those
college essays.
In other words, no one forced these peo
ple to be here. 1 was under the impression
that people came to tough universities like
Stanford to immerse themselves in learning.
And no. 1 don't spend all my time studying.
I enjoy skiing, surfing and going to the city
just as much as anyone else.
Hut 1 thought the days of tormenting the
teacher and staring at the second-hand on
the clock were long gone. We pay yeans-

worth of SOMEONE'S income to attend
Stanford.
And the price tag on this University is
not advertising a crappy education. If Stan
ford has forgotten about its undergraduates
so much as to send some incompetent fool
to teach our section, it is our responsibility
to demand more.
And if the students in that class really
didn't care whether or not they were learn
ing anything, maybe it is true when they say
college is just a status-symbol; maybe it is
just a ticket to be punched in order to find a
high-paying job.
I have had a wonderful three years at
Stanford, and I know I will walk away in
June feeling proud that 1 was a student
here. I wonder if that will remain the case
for undergraduates in the years to come.

Praise for public service
experience
As a senior looking back on my time
here at Stanford. I have had some of my
best experiences at the Haas Center for
public service.
When 1 transferred to Stanford my
sophomore year, I knew almost nobody
and was eager to make friends. The best
thing 1 did during my first quarter was to
become a tutor with East Palo Alto Ten

nis and Tutoring.
Working with EPATI has introduced
me to some great Stanford students who
share my values and want to give back to
the community. The experience of tutoring
a young child has also helped to put my
Stanford education in perspective — what I
learn in the classroom is important, but
what 1 learn about myself and the world
when I tutor is priceless.
1 encourage upperclassmen, especially
new transfers, to stop by the Haas Center's
open house today from 4 to 6 p.m. You
could be taking the first step on the most
incredible journey of your life.

Band's show a slap to diver

Shortly before half-time during last Sat
urday's football no-contest, your fix>tball
announcer invited us to the upcoming
Diversity Day on the Stanford campus.
After having issued the invitation to
Diversity Day, the Stanford Band took
the field and went into a racist tirade
against the drinkin.' fightin' and blightin'
Irish, which someone obviously consid
ered funny. It wasn't.
Stanford is apparently willing to recog
nize the concept of diversity only for a
brief period of time on its designated day.

It's too had that it can't be practiced
throughout the year.

Ode to the crossword puzzle
We think your crossword puzzles are too
hard.
How can we be expected to absorb
The gems of wisdom which our profs let fall
Each Friday class, where we are too
engrossed
In struggling over 32 across—
The clue for which is some obscure tycoon
From Bangladesh, or something of the sort?
(The Monday clues are closer to our speed.)
The point is this: your crossword puzzles
tend
To undermine our fragile self-esteem.
And also to distract us from the work
At hand. (We don't pay $30.(XX)
A year for you to make us feel like we
Are dumb; and how's a C.S. major from a
place
Like Venezuela s'posed to know who won
The Stanley Cup in 1963?)
What we propose is this: From now on,
please.
Each Friday issue (maybe Thursdays too)

Scene 1: "Stanlordland." It's every col
lege kid's dream. We live in the sunshine,
work some, play some more and interact
with amazing people.
But underneath it all, we know why
we're paying a hundred-grand to be here:
each of us, in some form or another, wants
to get an exceptional education.
If we didn't care enough to want one, we
a) probably wouldn't have gotten in, and b)
would be somewhere that was a lot less
expensive... Or so I thought.
Scene 2: Econ 1. Packed to the hilt.
Every financially-focused freshmen pouring
into the doors of Kresge Auditorium, ready
to soak up the last ounce of renowned Prof.
John Taylor's lecture on marginal costs and
deadweight losses.
As 1 do every year when 1 return to
Stanford, I feel a rash of gratitude and pride
that I am part of an institution dedicated to
discovery, teaching and the spread of
knowledge.
And this is why even now I am appalled
and disgusted as I think back to the joke of
a class-section 1 attended last week ...
Scene 3: The Quad. I am sitting in a
classroom comprised mostly freshmen, a
couple of upper-class students and our TA.
I feel, however, like I've been time-warped
back to junior high.
Instead of an educated grad student
standing in front of us, we've inherited a

blubbering, scatter-brained, soft-spoken
substitute teacher. And the students are on
the prowl.
Everyone talks at once, either trying to
figure out the
ill-explained concepts on his or her own or
mumbling snide and unflattering comments
about the teacher under his or her breath.
There is one particularly obnoxious male
student who has captured the attention of
all the giggling girls by looking directly at
the teacher and commenting with a straight
face on his poor teaching skills — just audi
bly enough to be heard by an attentive lis
tener above the dull roar of the class.
Everyone else is either shaking his or her
head at the teacher or contemplating how
to get out of this unfortunate situation...
I can't believe what 1 am witnessing. I
am sure all these people had high SAT
scores; I am sure all of them were at the top
of their classes. I also bet they spent a
decent amount of time grinding out those
college essays.
In other words, no one forced these peo
ple to be here. 1 was under the impression
that people came to tough universities like
Stanford to immerse themselves in learning.
And no. 1 don't spend all my time studying.
I enjoy skiing, surfing and going to the city
just as much as anyone else.
Hut 1 thought the days of tormenting the
teacher and staring at the second-hand on
the clock were long gone. We pay yeans-

worth of SOMEONE'S income to attend
Stanford.
And the price tag on this University is
not advertising a crappy education. If Stan
ford has forgotten about its undergraduates
so much as to send some incompetent fool
to teach our section, it is our responsibility
to demand more.
And if the students in that class really
didn't care whether or not they were learn
ing anything, maybe it is true when they say
college is just a status-symbol; maybe it is
just a ticket to be punched in order to find a
high-paying job.
I have had a wonderful three years at
Stanford, and I know I will walk away in
June feeling proud that 1 was a student
here. I wonder if that will remain the case
for undergraduates in the years to come.

Praise for public service
experience
As a senior looking back on my time
here at Stanford. I have had some of my
best experiences at the Haas Center for
public service.
When 1 transferred to Stanford my
sophomore year, I knew almost nobody
and was eager to make friends. The best
thing 1 did during my first quarter was to
become a tutor with East Palo Alto Ten

nis and Tutoring.
Working with EPATI has introduced
me to some great Stanford students who
share my values and want to give back to
the community. The experience of tutoring
a young child has also helped to put my
Stanford education in perspective — what I
learn in the classroom is important, but
what 1 learn about myself and the world
when I tutor is priceless.
1 encourage upperclassmen, especially
new transfers, to stop by the Haas Center's
open house today from 4 to 6 p.m. You
could be taking the first step on the most
incredible journey of your life.

Band's show a slap to diver
sity
Shortly before half-time during last Sat
urday's football no-contest, your fix>tball
announcer invited us to the upcoming
Diversity Day on the Stanford campus.
After having issued the invitation to
Diversity Day, the Stanford Band took
the field and went into a racist tirade
against the drinkin.' fightin' and blightin'
Irish, which someone obviously consid
ered funny. It wasn't.
Stanford is apparently willing to recog
nize the concept of diversity only for a
brief period of time on its designated day.

It's too had that it can't be practiced
throughout the year.

Ode to the crossword puzzle
We think your crossword puzzles are too
hard.
How can we be expected to absorb
The gems of wisdom which our profs let fall
Each Friday class, where we are too
engrossed
In struggling over 32 across—
The clue for which is some obscure tycoon
From Bangladesh, or something of the sort?
(The Monday clues are closer to our speed.)
The point is this: your crossword puzzles
tend
To undermine our fragile self-esteem.
And also to distract us from the work
At hand. (We don't pay $30.(XX)
A year for you to make us feel like we
Are dumb; and how's a C.S. major from a
place
Like Venezuela s'posed to know who won
The Stanley Cup in 1963?)
What we propose is this: From now on,
please.
Each Friday issue (maybe Thursdays too)
Include a crossword puzzle we can do!
