## The
						more things change...reflections on life in Hong Kong

I CHECK MY E-MAIL again. Why
hasn't anyone e-mailed me in the last
five minutes? Maybe because it's four in
the morning at Stanford.
I've been told before that I have unrealis
tic expectations of my friends. But come on.
I chose them carefully for a reason. None of
my friends are supposed to keep normal
hours; they're supposed to wage a continual
war against their circadian rhythms — and
win — and then e-mail me.
I check my e-mail again.
Why, do you ask, did I bother flying 18
hours to Hong Kong if I'm just going to
spend all my free time checking e-mail? She
must be having a hard time adjusting, you
say to yourself.
But moving to Hong Kong hasn't been
bad. I have yet to experience the little phe
nomenon called "culture shock." The only
real phenomenon I am experiencing is El
Nino. Thanks to the it, monsoon season is
not as wet as it usually is.
And if the smoke from the fires in
drought-ridden Indonesia doesn't drift to
Hong Kong, I'm golden.
Hong Kong isn't ideal for a cheap student
with a strong attraction to cool electronic
gadgets, but I've been refraining rather well.
Haven't purchased a video CD player yet.
Have yet to drool over walkmans that fit in

my palm. And I have yet to fondle head
phones that have all the controls (volume,
fast forward, rewind, tuning radio stations)
in a little fingernail-size square that sits by
your chest.
Hong Kong is something else. Many refer
to it as "China lite." It's true, to a certain
extent.
Take just a half hour out and you can
have USA Today sitting in your grubby lit
tle hands. Newsweek, Entertainment Week
ly and most importantly, the New York
Times are also available.
English-speaking television channels are
paltry, but there are only about four chan
nels to begin with. Where else can you see
outdated episodes of shows you never both
ered to watch in the States? Not that I watch
television much, of course. (My Synergy
friends would be appalled.)
I check my e-mail again.
But "China lite" is a rather unfortunate
misnomer.
Hong Kong is distinctly Chinese in its
own right. Despite a century-and-a-half of
British rule, Cantonese is still the vernacu
lar. At 10 p.m., food vendors roll their
portable kitchens into the street by my
apartment building and sell sui mai, small
sago pearls floating in coconut milk and
other Chinese treats.

Fashion-conscious women wearing lime
green pants trounce down the crowded
streets in their chunky shoes, ears pressed to
mobile phones.
Guys with spiky hair and tight shirts lis
ten to their waikmans in air-conditioned
subway cars. Men study the horse racing
page of the paper, gravely contemplating
their next bets. And finely dressed twenty
somethings saunter to booming night clubs
at Lan Kwai Fong.
1 heard things were like this before the
handover. Indeed, many a seasoned traveler
would tell you that Hong Kong is the
same as it was before July 1.
Those eager to find instances of overt
political repression have been disappointed.
Activists' demonstrations against the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund
during their annual conference occurred
without the sighting of a single tank. Martin
Lee and his Democratic Party have been
allowed to stage protests.
And the most critical daily newspapers
continue to go to press without interruption.
News of increasing media self-censorship is
almost old news. After all, the Chinese lead
ership said it would leave Hong Kong
unchanged.

But change is inevitable; especially when
the recipient of the sovereignty changeover
boasts the sturdiest economy in Southeast
Asia. The tourism industry has declined sig
nificantly and has yet to recover from the
handover period. As Hong Kong and China
enter a tentative honeymoon period that
many hope will last, the former British
colony is faced with many challenges.
The "mainland factor," as the Hong
Kong media refers to it, "will figure more
prominently in the formulation of social and
economic policies," wrote Chris Yeung,
political editor of the South China Morning
Post.
The border between the new Special
Administrative Region and the mainland
has effectively disappeared. This brings
about potential changes in social security, as
some recipients toy more freely with the
idea of living on the mainland.
The demand for Mandarin, or
putonghua, teachers has skyrocketed while
countless English teachers have either head
ed back to England or have found other
jobs. Recent editorials in local newspapers
have addressed new policies regarding the
language in which primary and middle
school classes should be taught. Three lan
guages vie for the classroom prize: Can
tonese, English and putonghua. The Chi-

nese government prefers the latter.
There are also growing curiosities, to put
it mildly, surrounding the identity and form
of the mainland government entity who is
charged with I long Kong matters.
Subtle changes abound. An Italian
restaurant that used to employ mostly young
UK backpackers now sports a staff of most
ly young Filipinos. UK job seekers now need
a visa to work in 1 long Kong. This only hints
at the complexity of implementing a new set
of immigration laws.
On Oct. 1, Hong Kong for the first time
celebrated National Day, marking the day in
1949 when Mao I'se lung proclaimed the
establishment of the People's Republic of
China. For the sixth time in 1997, Hong
Kong had a massive fireworks display.
Sadly enough, I wasn't able to check e
inail that Wednesday. Everything was
closed. All hail National Day.
