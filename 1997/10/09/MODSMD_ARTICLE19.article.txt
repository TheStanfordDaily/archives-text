## Women's soccer opens conference play at home Trojans and Bruins come to New Maloney 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
David Copperfield must have been involved.
How else could anyone explain the sudden metamor
phosis of the Stanford women's soccer team, which
opened its closet and scared all of the skeletons out last
week by creaming Colorado College?

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ TOMORROW: Stanford (4-5) vs. No. 20 USC (9-1-1)
at New Maloney Field, 4 p.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford vs. UCLA (7-2) at New Maloney
Field, 1 p.m.

With one wave of the wand, the Cardinal (4-5) said
goodbye to a month-long scoring drought and put six
goals in the back of the net, four in the last 12 frenzied
minutes.
This weekend's Pacific 10 Conference openers
against USC and UCLA should test the staying power of
the magician's magic.
On the other hand, coach Steve Swanson upholds
that the team hasn't changed at all, that last week's out
burst was fate finally giving the Card what it deserved.
The team, he said, has been creating more chances and
shooting more shots than almost all of its opponents all
season long.
What has changed most, he said, is the team's confi
dence.
"Any time you win as big as we did last week," he
said, "you gain confidence. We finally finished our
chances on Sunday [against Colorado College], but
we've really been playing that well all along."

"We're more focused now, after scoring all those
goals," said senior midfielder Rita I lermiz. "We have set
goals, written them down and last week, were able to
reach them."
When the Cardinal opens the Pac-1() season tomor
row at 4 p.m. at New Maloney Field, one of those goals
will be stopping the potent I ISC offense and sophomore
midfielder Kim Clark.
Just live years old, the No. 20 USC women's soccer
team (9-1-1) has earned its first-ever national ranking
and boasts its best record ever. I he team is coming off a
physical 1-0 victory over t JC'-Irvine last week and hasn't
lost a match since Aug. 31 at Nebraska, its second game
of the season.
Clark ranks second in the Pac-10 with 29 points. As a
team, the Women ofT roy are first in the conference with
93 points.
Alter getting past I ISC, it doesn't get any easier for
Stanford against I JC'l A (7-2) on Sunday at I p.m.
The Bruins lost 3-1 to undefeated BYU two weeks
ago, but came back to beat UC-San Francisco last
week.
" The game against IK IA is always incredibly emo
tional," llermi/ said. "It's extra-competitive and really
physical. It's good we're at home, though. We have great
fans, and it always helps."
Said Swanson: "Being at home is a huge advantage.
At home, we can sleep in our own beds and keep with
our routine, and we know what to expect."
Neither Swanson nor llermi/ thinks that playing
both important games in the same weekend harms the
Cardinal.
"In fact, I like it better," I lermi/ said. "It's easier to
be in a /one. If we do something wrong in Friday's game,
we can come rii»ht back on Sunday and fix it."
