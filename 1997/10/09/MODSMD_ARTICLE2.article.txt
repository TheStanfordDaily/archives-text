# Young scientists get a boost
## 12 junior faculty members named Terman Fellows 
### Juno Nakamura 
Twelve young science and engineering faculty mem
bers were named 1997-98 Frederick E. Terman Fellows
this week. The award provides fellows with unrestricted
funding of up to $ 10(3,000 annually for three years.
According to Rebecca Smith, associate director of the
Office of Development, the fellowship is aimed at
promising junior faculty in the sciences.
Awards are made each year to faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Engineering,
and on a rotating basis to faculty in the Schools of Earth
Sciences and Medicine.
Assoc. Provost Ann Fletcher said that the faculty
were nominated by department chairs and selected by
the deans of the respective schools. This year the number

of faculty nominated doubled from last year's figure.
The fellowship started in the spring of 1994 with a $25
million gift from William Hewlett and David Packard in
an effort to promote the sciences.
Juan Alonso, a fellowship recipient and assistant pro
fessor of aeronautics and astronautics, joined Stanford
just this fall. "It will help me make a good start here at
Stanford," Alonso said.
He said he thinks his award could be attributed to his
work in developing a computer program that will make
aerospace design more time efficient and less costly.
Alonso's grant will be used to support graduate stu
dents assisting his research, to conduct classes and re
search during the summer quarter and to purchase
equipment.
He is currently interested in de
veloping new courses to expose stu
dents to computational methods
used in aircraft design and will con
duct research in aerodynamic/
structural aircraft optimization.
Asst. Statistics Prof. Guenther
Walther, another awardee, splits his
time between the medical school
and the Department of Applied
Physics and is looking forward to
conducting research in the statistics
of shape and the estimation of in
trinsic dimensionality.

He said that the fellowship is
helpful in that it will secure future
projects.
Walther's award will be allocated
to the development of new comput
er classrooms and to the financing of
graduate students. Part of the grant
may be used to fund equipment, he
said.
Martha Cyert, assistant professor
of biology, is working on developing
genetic approaches to identifying
physiologic processes such as re
sponses to mating pheromones, ion
transport and the regulation of cell
wall biosynthesis and function.
Asst. Civil and Environmental
Engineering Professor Mark Jacob
son and his students are working on

an atmospheric computer modeling
project that involves the studies of
air pollution and meteorology in the
San Francisco Bay Area. "This
award will strengthen the program
in environmental fluid mechanics
and hydrology," said Jacobsen.
The other faculty named this
year are all assistant professors and
include Kyeongjae Cho and
Christopher Edwards of mechani
cal engineering, Blake Johnson of
engineering-economic systems and
operations research, Christopher
Klug of chemical engineering, Ke
feng Liu of mathematics, Tim
Stearns of biology, Scott Thomas of
physics and Tom Wandless of
chemistry.
