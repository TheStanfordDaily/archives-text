### Juno Nakamura 
Twelve young science and engineering faculty mem
bers were named 1997-98 Frederick E. Terman Fellows
this week. The award provides fellows with unrestricted
funding of up to $ 10(3,000 annually for three years.
According to Rebecca Smith, associate director of the
Office of Development, the fellowship is aimed at
promising junior faculty in the sciences.
Awards are made each year to faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Engineering,
and on a rotating basis to faculty in the Schools of Earth
Sciences and Medicine.
Assoc. Provost Ann Fletcher said that the faculty
were nominated by department chairs and selected by
the deans of the respective schools. This year the number

of faculty nominated doubled from last year's figure.
The fellowship started in the spring of 1994 with a $25
million gift from William Hewlett and David Packard in
an effort to promote the sciences.
Juan Alonso, a fellowship recipient and assistant pro
fessor of aeronautics and astronautics, joined Stanford
just this fall. "It will help me make a good start here at
Stanford," Alonso said.
He said he thinks his award could be attributed to his
work in developing a computer program that will make
aerospace design more time efficient and less costly.
Alonso's grant will be used to support graduate stu
dents assisting his research, to conduct classes and re
search during the summer quarter and to purchase
