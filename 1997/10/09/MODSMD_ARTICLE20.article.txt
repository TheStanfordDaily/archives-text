# That's Dr. Bunce to you
## Bunce looks at rosy past 
### 
For all the entertaining moments and
memorable personalities that the
Stanford football program has had,
there has been one glaring omission in the
last quarter-century for Cardinal fans: a
Rose Bowl berth.
Yes, as hard as it might be for the 25-
and-under age group to believe, there once
was a time when the Cardinal (then known
as the Indians) would occasionally make its
presence felt in Pasadena on New Year's
Day. The last time this happened was Jan.
1,1972, when an 8-3 Stanford team toppled
undefeated Michigan 13-12.
But while all that's left now are the
memories and faded newspaper clips, life
after football is still rather productive and
satisfying for some members of that great
1971 squad.
Take Don Bunce, the quarterback who
had the difficult task of following I leisman
Trophy winner Jim Plunkett. The unflap
pable and elusive Bunce is now Dr. Bunce,
orthopedic surgeon and head of the Sports
Medicine Department at the Palo Alto

Medical Center.
Clearly, the residue of his football ca
reer has not taken ahold of his life. A nd one
quick look around the walls of the Sports
Medicine Department bears no obvious re
minder that Bunce was the 1972 Rose Bowl
MVP or that he directed a dramatic seven
play drive against the Wolverines to set up
the game-winning field goal.
Not that he minds talking about it.
One minute, 4H seconds remaining in the
Rose Bowl, trailing 12-10 with the hall on its
own 22-yard line, Stanford's Bunce finds re
ceiver William Scott over the middle for /.?
yards.
Ever since his days at Woodside High
School, Bunce always had aspirations of at
tending medical school. But when it came
to choosing a college, he had other criteria
â€” namely, the Rose Bowl.
"I really wanted to play in a Rose Bowl,"
Bunce said. "When I'd looked at who'd
been in a Rose Bowl for the last 20 years, I
think USC had been to about 15 of them,
UCLA had been to about four of them. All
of a sudden, SC became very attractive to
me, and I was being heavily recruited by
John McKay, who was the coach at that
time.

"The only problem was that if you were
a quarterback, you weren't going to throw
the ball, you were going to hand off to some
Ail-American running back 50 times a
game. I wasn't sure I wanted to do that."
So Stanford, a school that had not been
to Pasadena since the 1951 season, became
appealing. But it wasn't the lean tradition
that drew him in; it was the unflinching op
timism of head coach John Ralston.
"John either convinced me that he was
on the right track or that he was crazy,"
Bunce said. "And I wasn't sure which one.
But here was a guy that came in taking over
a program at Stanford that was not very
successful ... [and he] was talking about
Rose Bowls.
"I remember being recruited and seeing
a number of other recruits on recruiting
trips. We sort of got together and decided
that if we all went to Stanford, we could
turn the program around, and I think (Ral
ston's faith) had a significant impact."
Now from the 35, Bunce drops back and
connedv with John Winesberry for a 10-
yard pass play.
Ralston's roll-out offense was perfectly
suited for Bunce's talents. Furthermore, he
felt like he was going to be part of some
thing special on the Farm. One problem
Jim Plunkett.
"It was extremely frustrating sitting on
the bench and wondering when I was going
to play," Bunce said. "John wanted to keep
both of us interested and ready but because
of Jim's success, he got to start.
"I think it would have been easier to ac
cept if I had played and not done well. But
every time I had a chance to play, things
happened, and I felt like there were a few
things that I could bring to the table that
Jim couldn't."
Indeed, Stanford first got a glimpse of
his immense talents in 1968, when the
blond backup came in for an injured Plun
kett in the second quarter of the Washing
ton game. Bunce did not miss a step, com
pleting five of seven passes for 137 yards
and three touchdowns while also running
for a score in the Indians' 35-20 win.
It would be two more seasons before he
would entertain a Stanford crowd again.
A five-yard penalty sets Stanford back to
its own 46. Nevertheless, Bunce proceeds to
complete an 11-yard pass to Miles Moore
down to Michigan's 43-yard line.
So while Plunkett was having his magi
cal 1970 season, directing the Indians back
to the Rose Bowl and winning the Heis
man, Bunce was on the sidelines as a red
shirt senior. Not that he didn't have his fun.
For example, during practice sessions for
the Rose Bowl game against undefeated
Ohio State, Bunce ran the scout team and
did his best impersonation of Buckeye
