Thrusting and parrying with her
foil is what junior Felicia Zimmer
mann does best. Shrouded behind a
face mask of black mesh, this fencing
national champion quickly gains the
upper hand in a mock duel with her
opponent.
Since her recent arrival at Stan
ford, Zimmermann practices nearly
every day with her teammates in
Roble Gym. As her skills demon
strate, she is a formidable opponent.
"Fencing is like a chess game. You
have to figure people out in order to
beat them," she said. "And I love
winning."
A transfer student from the Uni
versity of Rochester, Zimmermann,
22, has a list of honors that rival any
accomplished athlete: IW6 Olympic
fencing team member; two-time
fencing national champion (1993 and

of person," Zimmermann said. "I
have to plan everything out and use
my time."

fencing coach Zoran Tulum, Zim

No. I in the country. Her cheerful dis
position and easy-going attitude are
also appreciated by her coach and
teammates.
"When Felicia comes into the
room, it's like sun entering the room.
She is complete positive energy all
day," Tulum said.
Founded in 1898, the Stanford
fencing team celebrates its centenni
al anniversary this school year and
hopes to mark the occasion with a
first-place finish at the NCAA
Championships next spring. Last
year, Stanford came in third place at
the championships, and this year the
team is even stronger.
