# Adding a notch to her belt
## Zimmermann looks to lead top-ranked fencing team to title

Thrusting and parrying with her
foil is what junior Felicia Zimmer
mann does best. Shrouded behind a
face mask of black mesh, this fencing
national champion quickly gains the
upper hand in a mock duel with her
opponent.
Since her recent arrival at Stan
ford, Zimmermann practices nearly
every day with her teammates in
Roble Gym. As her skills demon
strate, she is a formidable opponent.
"Fencing is like a chess game. You
have to figure people out in order to
beat them," she said. "And I love
winning."
A transfer student from the Uni
versity of Rochester, Zimmermann,
22, has a list of honors that rival any
accomplished athlete: IW6 Olympic
fencing team member; two-time
fencing national champion (1993 and
I 9%); first American ever to win the
Junior World Cup fencing title
(1995); first alternate for the 1992
Olympic fencing team; and bronze
medalist in the under-17 fencing
World Championships (1992).
Take the mask off, however, and
Zimmermann is an unassuming stu
dent, dedicated to both her team and
her studies. As an industrial engi
neering major, she faces the chal
lenge of balancing a grueling training
schedule with a heavy academic
workload.
"During the school year, 1 can't af
ford to be a spur-of-the-moment kind
of person," Zimmermann said. "I
have to plan everything out and use
my time."
One of the prize picks in a nation
al recruiting effort led by Stanford
fencing coach Zoran Tulum, Zim
mermann will contribute her exper
tise to a team that is currently ranked
No. I in the country. Her cheerful dis
position and easy-going attitude are
also appreciated by her coach and
teammates.
"When Felicia comes into the
room, it's like sun entering the room.
She is complete positive energy all
day," Tulum said.
Founded in 1898, the Stanford
fencing team celebrates its centenni
al anniversary this school year and
hopes to mark the occasion with a
first-place finish at the NCAA
Championships next spring. Last
year, Stanford came in third place at
the championships, and this year the
team is even stronger.
"We have the best team in the

country. Hopefully this time around
we will win the championships,"
Tulum said. "I want that dream
badly."
Growing up in Rochester, N.Y.,
Zimmermann began taking fencing
lessons when she was 8 years old on
the urgings of her father.
"When he first suggested the
idea, I wasn't really into it and pout
ed all the way to the fencing center,"
Zimmermann said. "But on the first
day of classes I had a great time. It
was really fun, but at first I didn't let
on to my dad that I liked it."
Taking lessons at the prestigious
Rochester Fencing Center, Zimmer
mann rose to become one of the top
female fencers in the country.
After competing in the 19%
Olympics, she returned to the Uni
versity of Rochester, where she at
tended school. She decided she
needed a change and looked into
transferring to another university.
"I had visited Stanford five years
ago during a competition and
thought the campus was so gorgeous
and sunny," Zimmermann said.
"I've also known the coach since I

was about 10 and had lessons from
him when I was younger. It was a
natural choice."
Zimmermann says she likes being
at Stanford and appreciates the sup
port she has gotten from her coach
and new teammates.
"Getting used to being here has
been easy," she said. "The team has
really accepted me quickly. That's
made the transition a lot better."
Stanford's fencing team consists
of 30 members and spends two hours
practicing together twice a week in
Roble Gym. Team members also
have individual lessons with coach
I ulum three to four times per week.
According to Tulum, Stanford's
fencing recruitment program is
unique.
"We recruit people not solely be
cause of their skills but also because
of their personality," Tulum said.
"We have to be able to work togeth
er, and the team we have this year is
great. I haven't seen this kind of
unity in years."
Currently the team is in its pre
season training period. The first club
tournament will be held against Cal
ifornia Nov. 22. Regular competi
tions begin in January and finish
with the NCAA Championships
March 18-21.
