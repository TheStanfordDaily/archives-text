## Panel discusses electric power deregulation in California 
### Ritu Bhatnagar 
California's future in energy efficiency was discussed
by a panel of seven specialists last night in Terman Audi
torium at a presentation titled "Electric Power Deregu
lation in California: How Will It Affect You?"
The focus of yesterday evening's discussion was Cali
fornia's coming Jan. 1 transformation to energy deregu
lation.
Panel members addressed issues such as the impact of
deregulation, the effects on customers, and the restruc
turing of the power industry.
"The state of California is facing a self-imposed dead
line," stated Anton Rowe, Class of '97, who introduced
the panel.
"The test date is Jan. 1, and everyone is cramming
right now to prepare for it."
Panelists described how the movement for electric
power deregulation in California is the product of a dra
matic rise in rates in the early 19905. By 1994, Californi
ans faced about 50 percent higher rates than the rest of
the nation, due to a variety of complications, such as the
money spent by utilities in an effort to get customers to
use less power.
According to panelist Aldyn Hoekstra, associate di
rector of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, rates
were continuing to rise, and "there was no relief in sight."

Concerned with reducing rates, a restructuring effort
was begun in the hopes of introducing competition into
the industry. In the summer of 19%, this coming January
was set as the date when California electric power would
deregulate. "Customers will have a choice beyond their
local utility," explained Hoekstra. "The industry is being
thrown open to competition and more choices."
The major change that customers can expect as a re
sult of the deregulation is a 10 percent rate reduction
from the Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
Over the next four years, panelists said, other changes
will ensue as the industry becomes more affected by a
self-sustaining private sector.
About 120 companies are already registered and
ready to provide customers with power when Jan. 1 rolls
around. "This is something fundamentally new in the de
livery of energy in California," stated panelist Don
Schultz, energy specialist for the California Public Utili
ties Commission.
Perhaps most relevant to the Stanford community is
the question of what Stanford will choose as its power
supply, as brought up by panelist Ryan Wiser, senior re
search associate of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. Although this information is confidential
as of yet, it will likely come into the public eye, once
University officials make a decision in the upcoming
months.
