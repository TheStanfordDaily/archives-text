## Richard Pryor's Profane Honesty â€“ "Pryor Convictions and Other Life Sentences" 
### Alex Tung Contributing writer 
The name Richard Pryor may mean little to
most in this world of high profile celebrities and
sit-com stars, but he is hailed as a comic genius by
critics and other comedians. Unlike most comics
though, Pryor finds humor in dark places, and the
darkest of them all is his own life.
Pryor's autobiography, "Pryor Convictions
and Other Life Sentences," explores with incredi
ble honesty the tragedy and horrific circum
stances of his life through the only medium that
qualifies: comedy. His brand of profanely pro
found cynicism carries straight off the stage and
screen and into print, a flowing lyricism that sati
rizes everything from drugs, women and fame to
his numerous brushes with death.
From his days growing up in Peoria, Illinois in
the 1940s and '50s and his hard-knock days as a
stand-up comedian, to the movie career that pro
pelled him into the public spotlight, Pryor's ac
counts of his cocaine-filled womanizing paint a
disturbing picture of a man's self-induced trou
bles. At the same time, his courage and persever

ance become more and more evident with each
crashing turn that life deals him.
The book begins with the most devastating of
these moments, the day Pryor is diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis. "You know how sometimes
you're too stupid to be frightened when that's re
ally the way you should be acting?" he asks the
reader. "Well, I was both stupid and frightened. I
didn't know what the fuck the doctor meant when
he informed me that I had multiple sclerosis. Nor
did I want to know."
Using that moment as a sullen backdrop for
the rest of his story, Pryor then launches into his
childhood in Peoria, the beginnings of his
comedic quest. There he learns to grow up quick
ly while living and working with his family in the
whorehouses, bars and strip clubs of the black sec
tion of town. He runs into racial prejudice when
the father of a white girl he had befriended won't
let her keep the present Pryor gives her, and he re
ceives his first opportunity to perform when a
teacher allows him to tell jokes to the class as a re
ward for doing his work.
Even in his early years growing up, Pryor
found comedy in everything around him, most
notably his family

and community.
"As a comedian, I
couldn't have
asked for better
material," he
writes. "My eyes
and ears absorbed
everything. People
came in to ex
change news, blow
steam or have their
say. Everybody had
an opinion about
something."
Kicked out
of school in eighth
grade, Pryor takes
us through his jobs
cleaning up strip
clubs or shining
shoes and through
his short stint serv
ing in the Army in
Germany. Return
ing to Peoria, he
takes his first job as
a performer. "I re
member seeing
Redd Foxx and
Dick Gregory on
television and
thinking that I
could do some
thing similar. I had
no trouble making
people laugh....
Shit, I might as well
get paid for it."
All the
while Pryor

maintains his rich
flow of words, in
terjecting occa
sional jokes about
the subject at hand
and displaying an
uncanny humility
amid the turmoil
of each situation.
He describes life as
a struggling comic
in New York,
shamelessly copy
ing Bill Cosby's
style to get "the
monies," and even
tually searching for
his own unique fla
vor. In addition to
Cosby's inspira
tion, Pryor attrib
utes influences to
other comedians,
including the likes
of Redd Foxx and
Lily Tomlin.
He discusses
how the destruc
tiveness of cocaine
crashed down on
him in the mid
'6os, as he tries to
understand the
chaos of the age.
"The good ones
were being
bumped off. John,
Malcolm, Martin
and Bobby. What
to make of it? I
wanted to under
stand why that shit
had happened. But
there was no way."
Pryor states his
points clearly and
conciscly, with the
comic flair that
made him famous.

At times the jokes are so wrought with inner
meaning that it is difficult to know whether to
laugh or bite your lip in horror.
Pauline Kael calls Pryor "a master of lyrical
obscenity" and"the only great poet satirist
among our comics," and at times he hits so hard
and close to the heart that you can't help but
cringe. He writes about everything that happened
in his life, from being raped by a childhood bully
to setting himself on fire in bitterness toward
God. He is open with his treatment of women, in
cluding the stressful times with each of his six
wives.
There is little that most people would directly
correlate between his life and theirs, but the feel
ings of intense loneliness and uncertainty he con
veys are universal in scope. Through all the drugs,

the women and the strains of fame, he has sur
vived, and he has learned from some mistakes,
been beaten down by others. Following the advice
of one of his friends, he has managed to "keep
some sunshine on his face."
Pryor's life mirrors the pain and turbulence of
a time when nothing was ever certain. Perhaps we,
as children of the '80s and '90s, cannot relate to all
that went on during the bulk of his life, but we can
certainly learn from his story. This is by no means
a funny, light-hearted book. It is a dark comedy, a
tragedy and an honest story about a man who
hurled himself down a path of self-destruction but
has managed to retain his integrity.
For old fans or just curious comedy buffs,
"Pryor Convictions" gives excellent insight into a
time rampant with fleeting whims and fiery rage,
and into the life of a man who survived it all.

comedic quest. There he learns to grow up quick
ly while living and working with his family in the
whorehouses, bars and strip clubs of the black sec
tion of town. He runs into racial prejudice when
the father of a white girl he had befriended won't
let her keep the present Pryor gives her, and he re
ceives his first opportunity to perform when a
teacher allows him to tell jokes to the class as a re
ward for doing his work.
Even in his early years growing up, Pryor
found comedy in everything around him, most
notably his family

and community.
"As a comedian, I
couldn't have
asked for better
material," he
writes. "My eyes
and ears absorbed
everything. People
came in to ex
change news, blow
steam or have their
say. Everybody had
an opinion about
something."
Kicked out
of school in eighth
grade, Pryor takes
us through his jobs
cleaning up strip
clubs or shining
shoes and through
his short stint serv
ing in the Army in
Germany. Return
ing to Peoria, he
takes his first job as
a performer. "I re
member seeing
Redd Foxx and
Dick Gregory on
television and
thinking that I
could do some
thing similar. I had
no trouble making
people laugh....
Shit, I might as well
get paid for it."
All the
while Pryor

maintains his rich
flow of words, in
terjecting occa
sional jokes about
the subject at hand
and displaying an
uncanny humility
amid the turmoil
of each situation.
He describes life as
a struggling comic
in New York,
shamelessly copy
ing Bill Cosby's
style to get "the
monies," and even
tually searching for
his own unique fla
vor. In addition to
Cosby's inspira
tion, Pryor attrib
utes influences to
other comedians,
including the likes
of Redd Foxx and
Lily Tomlin.
He discusses
how the destruc
tiveness of cocaine
crashed down on
him in the mid
'6os, as he tries to
understand the
chaos of the age.
"The good ones
were being
bumped off. John,
Malcolm, Martin
and Bobby. What
to make of it? I
wanted to under
stand why that shit
had happened. But
there was no way."
Pryor states his
points clearly and
conciscly, with the
comic flair that
made him famous.

At times the jokes are so wrought with inner
meaning that it is difficult to know whether to
laugh or bite your lip in horror.
Pauline Kael calls Pryor "a master of lyrical
obscenity" and"the only great poet satirist
among our comics," and at times he hits so hard
and close to the heart that you can't help but
cringe. He writes about everything that happened
in his life, from being raped by a childhood bully
to setting himself on fire in bitterness toward
God. He is open with his treatment of women, in
cluding the stressful times with each of his six
wives.
There is little that most people would directly
correlate between his life and theirs, but the feel
ings of intense loneliness and uncertainty he con
veys are universal in scope. Through all the drugs,

the women and the strains of fame, he has sur
vived, and he has learned from some mistakes,
been beaten down by others. Following the advice
of one of his friends, he has managed to "keep
some sunshine on his face."
Pryor's life mirrors the pain and turbulence of
a time when nothing was ever certain. Perhaps we,
as children of the '80s and '90s, cannot relate to all
that went on during the bulk of his life, but we can
certainly learn from his story. This is by no means
a funny, light-hearted book. It is a dark comedy, a
tragedy and an honest story about a man who
hurled himself down a path of self-destruction but
has managed to retain his integrity.
For old fans or just curious comedy buffs,
"Pryor Convictions" gives excellent insight into a
time rampant with fleeting whims and fiery rage,
and into the life of a man who survived it all.
