## HAIL PRIEST, FIRST RATE THIRD WORLD 
### Andrew Oyefesobi 
The congregation waited outside, cursing
the first cold, windy night of the season. From
the looks of the crowd, the caller of this service
had a universal appeal, for they were a cross
section of the community: natty dread heads
cuddled next to trendy college kids, shivering
next to the clean-cut followers. They had gath
ered at The Edge, 260 California Ave., on Oct. 6
for what was billed as l A Night of Reggae with
Maxi Priest and Third World.'
Clad in an ethereal, flowing white shirt,
sporting waist-length dreadlocks and shades,
the exalted London-raised artist met his eager
public. The devout mass flocked to the stage,
summoned to glean wisdom from sweat drip
ping from the pulpit. The surface differences
faded, and the crowd moved to a common
beat.
Beneath smoke and psychedelic lights, Maxi
Priest — known for breezy, commercial reggae
— delivered a sermon that was perhaps more
suggestive than saindy. He opened with the
steamy "Jezebel" and moved into the lively
"Man with the Fun," from the same name
album, his seventh consecutive on the Virgin
label.
In the first hour, the exuberant Priest
crooned odes to love and loss. He started with
a guitar-driven ditty about love's simple plea
sures called "Just A Little Bit More," and then
moved into "Wild, Wild World," an upbeat
warning about breaking up and letting go that
featured a funky keyboard section. The set
ended with the catchy "Tide is High" from the
Speed 2 soundtrack. The mood was brewing,
but the intimate gathering became a frenzy
when Jamaican rapper Red Fox (A Matter of
Fox), unexpectedly burst in with bombastic
rhymes over heavy drumming.
The Priest, coaxed by a demand for more
reggae romance, returned to the stage. The sec

ond hour, a medley of his well -known hits, was
marked with a decidedly stronger crowd reac
tion —as usual, there's greater appreciation for
what one knows and loves.
Maxi reopened with "Smile," a powerfully
touching ballad describing wasted efforts to
fight feelings never before felt, such as underes
timating a smile. "Housecall," a collaboration
with original rudeboy Shabby Ranks about a
love doctor's diagnosis, introduced with sirens
and funked on with the trademark testament:
"Your body can't lie to me / 'cause 1 know just
what you're feelin'. " To the crowd's delight,
Red Fox returned to rhyme and gyrate. Mean
while, back-up singers, armed with tam
bourines and maracas, gave all they had to give
the people what they wanted.
"That Girl," a duet recorded with Shaggy,
was coupled with a bass guitar solo and served
as a hand-clappin', bluesy tell-all about the
power of feminine seduction. Again, Red Fox,
Shaggy's vocal twin, rocked the number. At one
point, the lyricist slowed his verses for a hyp
notic twist that garnered massive approval
from the pews.
Maxi closed his set with "Close to You,"
using beefy percussion and aggressive key
board to jazz up the traditional slow jam. The
song's sensual fatal attraction was tempered
with promises "do whateva you want me to"
and "show you the way I feel." Bathed in a lone
blue light, the Priest consummated with a
deeply soulful breakdown teased with playful
keyboard strokes. As he held pitch, the Priest
was showered with glory in return for the emo
tional aural jaunt. The most striking moments
definitely came whenever the band gave the
floor to Maxi to just blow — just the voice
stretching and coating the room.
Following a break that seemed to extend the
starvation of the riddim hungry crowd, Third
World, a six-man piece from the reggae capital
of the world, Kingston, Jamaica, took to the

stage and fed The Edge with grassroots flavor.
Jungle whispers and intense drumming
drowned the dark room, until the lights came
up on the band known as the "Reggae Ambas
sadors."
Third World opened with "Ride On," an in
spirational shout-out urging the young to
tread on in a world of confusion, and sang of
love as a healing force in "Jah U>ve," a tune
recorded with Stevie Wonder. Then, lead singer
William "Bunny Rugs" Clark flipped the script
and belted out "Cold Sweat," a heavy, haunting
hymn on soul-searching and self-actualiza
tion.
In the grand tradition of Marley and the
Wailers, Third World brought the pain —
grassroots reggae with a more traditional
sound and traditional themes, such as de
nouncing oppressive forces. Rut when Steven
"Cat" Coore retrieved a cello, "You've Clot the
Power" (introduced as "Third World Un
plugged") became a Rasta anthem with classi
cal poise.
Third World laid down a first rate perfor
mance in the area of experimentation and tak
ing chances. "Feel a Little Better" was average
feel-good, until Tony "Ruption" Williams
erupted into a monstrous drummer's solo —
the drumming reached a surreal point where
the show turned into an experience. Similarly,
the message of "Keep on dancin', keep on
movin' " in "One Cold Vibe" was a boppy
track, until a gritty, rock guitar solo changed its
wind.
Even Clark couldn't resist the urge to send
out a dedication to the ladies in "I'm Commit
ted," a melodious but punchy love song. He
then returned the band to Marley-esque gospel
with an appeal to the basics in "What's the An
swer?," responding with the verse "Give a little
something" — namely love, in the search for
life's answers. Again, in a flutter of sticks, the
swaying throng was treated to an ear-shatter

ing highlight of Williams' skill.
The cover of the O'Jays' classic "Now That
We've Found Love" was dipped in a harmony
inspired Caribbean sauce. Giving props to its
own sound, Third World took the time to ex
plain the duty of Rasta followers and rudeboys
in its thumping theme song, "Reggae Ambas
sador."
The dramatic highlight came when Clark
stood on a platform and became director of the
orchestra. Third World proceeded to play an
ass-shaking dance hall symphony; the eerie, op
eratic concerto gave way to a tribal undercui
rent that was charging, electric and earthy all at
once. (Think: Beethoven meets Buju Banton.)
Maxi Priest continues to spread his word in
the fusion of reggae dance pop and Jamaican
R&B on the remainder of a two week tour,
which carries him to Los Angeles next. As a
performer, the Priest seemed to direct much of
his service at the female members of the con
gregation. Luckily, Red Fox reminded the
crowd of the answer to the show-opening ques
tion: "Are you ready to party?," bringing just
enough of the ruff dance hall to balance the
Priest's love and heartache gospel. A little
Caribbean cotton candy, a little island hip
hop... the consensus of among the contin
gency on Maxi, the artist, remained "Hail,
Priest!"
Yet, the semi-religious experience came in
Third World's clear reggae consciousness.
Their creative artistry, toying with and enhanc
ing tradition, carries listeners through all three
worlds and back again. From the powerful pot
pourri in "96 Degrees" to "You've Got the
Power," Third World proves they can "tro' de
wickedest slam," as well as the wisdom.
It was a good night for reggae. They came
for Maxi, but they stayed for Third World.
Marley, the "Rasta Prophet," has indeed left a
legacy: a Priest who lends the juice and pro
t£g£s who lead the journey.
