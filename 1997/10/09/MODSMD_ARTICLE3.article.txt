## Stanford volunteers lead Bible study at juvenile hall 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
it's not your typical church, but
then, these aren't your typical Sun
day school children. Yet the inmates
of San Jose's Juvenile Hall learn
about God also, through the efforts
of a program affiliated with Stan
ford's Catholic community.
Every month, a group composed
of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students, alumni as well as
other members of the congregation
head for the hall as part of the Juve
nile Hall Bible Study. The goal of
the Bible study, according to many
of the volunteers, is to show the kids
that there is a better way to live.
"At Bible study, they have a dif
ferent way of interacting with each
other outside of the gang way," said
Chiara Sabatti, a fourth-year doc
toral student in statistics. "They can
talk about issues that they wouldn't
usually get to talk about but which
are very relevant to them. We want
to show them that there are people

living different lives, be role mod
els."
Following a strict daily schedule,
the inmates are given a few hours to
themselves after dinner. Those who
are interested in participating in the
Bible study sign up to spend an hour
of their free time with the Stanford
volunteers.
"It's not really a social event,"
said the Rev. Tom Finsterbach, a Je
suit who also currently works as a re
searcher at the Beckman Center in
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
"A lot of them come here genuinely
interested. They realize they have to
reassess the situation."
At the hall, a voice announces
over the intercom that the Bible
study is about to begin. The kids (al
ways referred to as minors] are
brought in single file with their
hands behind their backs, accompa
nied by a juvenile hall counselor.
Males and females, prohibited from
interacting, stand in separate lines.
The minors, all in uniform, wear
green sweatshirts, blue pants for the

females and brown ones for the
males. They represent many differ
ent ethnic groups, although the most
predominant are Hispanic and Viet
namese.
"These are not just people who
stole a car stereo either," Finster
bach said. "You're sitting in a room
with at least one rapist and at least
one who is an accessory to rape. And
there's one who pretty severely beat
up an older couple."
According to Sabatti, the in
mates range in age from thirteen to
eighteen years.
"Ages are a special concept
there; it's strange to deal with age.
One of the difficulties we have as
volunteers is in figuring out how to
relate to these kids because they are
part child and part adult," Sabatti
said. "They have a lot of experiences
that we did not have as teenagers.
We're dealing with young kids but
they're adults as to what they've
seen and experienced."
