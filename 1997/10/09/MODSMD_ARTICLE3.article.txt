## Stanford volunteers lead Bible study at juvenile hall 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
it's not your typical church, but
then, these aren't your typical Sun
day school children. Yet the inmates
of San Jose's Juvenile Hall learn
about God also, through the efforts
of a program affiliated with Stan
ford's Catholic community.
Every month, a group composed
of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students, alumni as well as
other members of the congregation
head for the hall as part of the Juve
nile Hall Bible Study. The goal of
the Bible study, according to many
of the volunteers, is to show the kids
that there is a better way to live.
"At Bible study, they have a dif
ferent way of interacting with each
other outside of the gang way," said
Chiara Sabatti, a fourth-year doc
toral student in statistics. "They can
talk about issues that they wouldn't
usually get to talk about but which
are very relevant to them. We want
to show them that there are people

living different lives, be role mod
els."
Following a strict daily schedule,
the inmates are given a few hours to
themselves after dinner. Those who
are interested in participating in the
Bible study sign up to spend an hour
of their free time with the Stanford
volunteers.
"It's not really a social event,"
said the Rev. Tom Finsterbach, a Je
suit who also currently works as a re
searcher at the Beckman Center in
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
"A lot of them come here genuinely
interested. They realize they have to
reassess the situation."
At the hall, a voice announces
over the intercom that the Bible
study is about to begin. The kids (al
ways referred to as minors] are
brought in single file with their
hands behind their backs, accompa
nied by a juvenile hall counselor.
Males and females, prohibited from
interacting, stand in separate lines.
The minors, all in uniform, wear
green sweatshirts, blue pants for the

females and brown ones for the
males. They represent many differ
ent ethnic groups, although the most
predominant are Hispanic and Viet
namese.
"These are not just people who
stole a car stereo either," Finster
bach said. "You're sitting in a room
with at least one rapist and at least
one who is an accessory to rape. And
there's one who pretty severely beat
up an older couple."
According to Sabatti, the in
mates range in age from thirteen to
eighteen years.
"Ages are a special concept
there; it's strange to deal with age.
One of the difficulties we have as
volunteers is in figuring out how to
relate to these kids because they are
part child and part adult," Sabatti
said. "They have a lot of experiences
that we did not have as teenagers.
We're dealing with young kids but
they're adults as to what they've
seen and experienced."
Many of the minors at the hall
have children themselves. "One of
the things that strikes me about it,
that compels me to go, is that it
seems to me like it's a cycle," Lucas
said. "These teens in gangs have chil
dren and then those children grow
up with their parents in jail, and then
later those children join gangs and
then they go to the juvenile hall, and
it's just this ongoing cycle."
Sabatti agreed, calling having
children "a responsibility you think
they shouldn't take. The future of
those kids doesn't seem very promis
ing."
However, according to Lucas,
"At the same time they seem very
devoted to their kids, and to their

moms. There's a very serious bond.
Before the Bible study we usually
ask them if there's anyone they
would like to pray for and they usu
ally name their kids and then their
moms."
The strong feelings for their
mothers has been observed by more
than one volunteer. Stanford alum
nus Paul Mitiguy recounted one of
his most memorable experiences
working at the juvenile hall.
"[Finsterbach] went down on
Mother's Day. He started talking
about their moms, and how much
they've done for them. And then he
tells them that today, Mother's Day,
which is supposed to be her special
day, she's walking past their empty
bed, seeing their empty place at the
dinner table. He tells them, 'She
loves you and you're not there.' And
these guys start breaking down. It's

touching how much they love their
moms.
"I mean, you see these big guys,
tattoos everywhere, strutting around
for each other and acting tough, and
these are rough guys, but they're so
sensitive when it comes to their
mothers. They know their moms
love them."
During the Bible study Tuesday
night, a group of younger inmates
started to cry.
"One of the guys said he was
mean to his mom," Lucas said, "and
all the other ones got on him. They
asked him, 'Who comes to see you
when you're here? Who takes your
collect calls?'"
However, their fathers evoke no
similar feeling. "The most common
denominator with the kids is that
none of them have dads," Mitiguy
said. "A lot of the guys there have

children themselves. You hear these
sixteen or seventeen-year-olds talk
ing about their kids, but they have no
concept of sticking around and being
a family, with a mother and a father
and all that.
"And the girls are interested in
getting pregnant. That's what really
shocked me because I thought it was
accidental, like they didn't know
about birth control or something,"
Mitiguy continued. "But no, they're
looking for love and they think that
when they have kids, their kids will
love them."
According to Finsterbach, "being
locked up is a family tradition. Like
when you went to college, it was
probably kind of assumed that you
would go to college. For these kids,
it's being locked up and that's just
the way it is. If you ask these kids if
someone related to them is doing

hard time, about three out of five of
them would say yes."
Most of the minors are in juvenile
hall because of their involvement in
gangs.
"They are concerned about what
they have done, but not about the fu
ture because they think, 'Well,
maybe I don't have any future,'
Sabatti said. "They don't envision
their lives any other way than gangs,
getting shot in the streets."
The Bible study originated with
Finsterbach and Mitiguy about 10
years ago, when Finsterbach was the
Catholic chaplain at Stanford and at
the San Jose Juvenile Hall. "When 1
[first] went down, I was really
touched," Mitiguy said. "I was over
whelmed knowing that these kids
had such an interest in God that they
would give up their own free time to
learn about Him."

loves you and you're not there.' And
these guys start breaking down. It's

touching how much they love their
moms.
"I mean, you see these big guys,
tattoos everywhere, strutting around
for each other and acting tough, and
these are rough guys, but they're so
sensitive when it comes to their
mothers. They know their moms
love them."
During the Bible study Tuesday
night, a group of younger inmates
started to cry.
"One of the guys said he was
mean to his mom," Lucas said, "and
all the other ones got on him. They
asked him, 'Who comes to see you
when you're here? Who takes your
collect calls?'"
However, their fathers evoke no
similar feeling. "The most common
denominator with the kids is that
none of them have dads," Mitiguy
said. "A lot of the guys there have

children themselves. You hear these
sixteen or seventeen-year-olds talk
ing about their kids, but they have no
concept of sticking around and being
a family, with a mother and a father
and all that.
"And the girls are interested in
getting pregnant. That's what really
shocked me because I thought it was
accidental, like they didn't know
about birth control or something,"
Mitiguy continued. "But no, they're
looking for love and they think that
when they have kids, their kids will
love them."
According to Finsterbach, "being
locked up is a family tradition. Like
when you went to college, it was
probably kind of assumed that you
would go to college. For these kids,
it's being locked up and that's just
the way it is. If you ask these kids if
someone related to them is doing

hard time, about three out of five of
them would say yes."
Most of the minors are in juvenile
hall because of their involvement in
gangs.
"They are concerned about what
they have done, but not about the fu
ture because they think, 'Well,
maybe I don't have any future,'
Sabatti said. "They don't envision
their lives any other way than gangs,
getting shot in the streets."
The Bible study originated with
Finsterbach and Mitiguy about 10
years ago, when Finsterbach was the
Catholic chaplain at Stanford and at
the San Jose Juvenile Hall. "When 1
[first] went down, I was really
touched," Mitiguy said. "I was over
whelmed knowing that these kids
had such an interest in God that they
would give up their own free time to
learn about Him."
it's not your typical church, but
then, these aren't your typical Sun
day school children. Yet the inmates
of San Jose's Juvenile Hall learn
about God also, through the efforts
of a program affiliated with Stan
ford's Catholic community.
Every month, a group composed
of Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students, alumni as well as
other members of the congregation
head for the hall as part of the Juve
nile Hall Bible Study. The goal of
the Bible study, according to many
of the volunteers, is to show the kids
that there is a better way to live.
"At Bible study, they have a dif
ferent way of interacting with each
other outside of the gang way," said
Chiara Sabatti, a fourth-year doc
toral student in statistics. "They can
talk about issues that they wouldn't
usually get to talk about but which
are very relevant to them. We want
to show them that there are people

living different lives, be role mod
els."
Following a strict daily schedule,
the inmates are given a few hours to
themselves after dinner. Those who
are interested in participating in the
Bible study sign up to spend an hour
of their free time with the Stanford
volunteers.
"It's not really a social event,"
said the Rev. Tom Finsterbach, a Je
suit who also currently works as a re
searcher at the Beckman Center in
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
"A lot of them come here genuinely
interested. They realize they have to
reassess the situation."
At the hall, a voice announces
over the intercom that the Bible
study is about to begin. The kids (al
ways referred to as minors] are
brought in single file with their
hands behind their backs, accompa
nied by a juvenile hall counselor.
Males and females, prohibited from
interacting, stand in separate lines.
The minors, all in uniform, wear
green sweatshirts, blue pants for the

females and brown ones for the
males. They represent many differ
ent ethnic groups, although the most
predominant are Hispanic and Viet
namese.
"These are not just people who
stole a car stereo either," Finster
bach said. "You're sitting in a room
with at least one rapist and at least
one who is an accessory to rape. And
there's one who pretty severely beat
up an older couple."
According to Sabatti, the in
mates range in age from thirteen to
eighteen years.
"Ages are a special concept
there; it's strange to deal with age.
One of the difficulties we have as
volunteers is in figuring out how to
relate to these kids because they are
part child and part adult," Sabatti
said. "They have a lot of experiences
that we did not have as teenagers.
We're dealing with young kids but
they're adults as to what they've
seen and experienced."
Many of the minors at the hall
have children themselves. "One of
the things that strikes me about it,
that compels me to go, is that it
seems to me like it's a cycle," Lucas
said. "These teens in gangs have chil
dren and then those children grow
up with their parents in jail, and then
later those children join gangs and
then they go to the juvenile hall, and
it's just this ongoing cycle."
Sabatti agreed, calling having
children "a responsibility you think
they shouldn't take. The future of
those kids doesn't seem very promis
ing."
However, according to Lucas,
"At the same time they seem very
devoted to their kids, and to their

moms. There's a very serious bond.
Before the Bible study we usually
ask them if there's anyone they
would like to pray for and they usu
ally name their kids and then their
moms."
The strong feelings for their
mothers has been observed by more
than one volunteer. Stanford alum
nus Paul Mitiguy recounted one of
his most memorable experiences
working at the juvenile hall.
"[Finsterbach] went down on
Mother's Day. He started talking
about their moms, and how much
they've done for them. And then he
tells them that today, Mother's Day,
which is supposed to be her special
day, she's walking past their empty
bed, seeing their empty place at the
dinner table. He tells them, 'She
loves you and you're not there.' And
these guys start breaking down. It's

touching how much they love their
moms.
"I mean, you see these big guys,
tattoos everywhere, strutting around
for each other and acting tough, and
these are rough guys, but they're so
sensitive when it comes to their
mothers. They know their moms
love them."
