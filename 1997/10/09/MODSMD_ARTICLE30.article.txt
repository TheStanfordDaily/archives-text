## MOMIX strikes out with "Baseball" 
### Sylee Gore Staff writer 
Last weekend, dance company MOMIX
came to Memorial Auditorium to perform
"Baseball," a cluttered and incoherent explo
ration of America's favorite pastime.
Led by choreographer Moses Pendleton, the
Connecticut-based company has performed
throughout parts of the United States, Europe,
Asia and South America. Pendleton himself is
the co-founder of Pilobolus 1 )ance Theatre and
a former Guggenheim Fellow. Pendleton's other
projects have included the 1991 film "FXII,"
music videos for White Lion and Prince, and
choreography for Deutsche Opera, Ballet de
Nancy and numerous other companies.
The roots of "Baseball" lie in a piece that
MOMIX performed at the opening of the San
Francisco Giants' spring training park in
Scottsdale, Arizona. Unfortunately, the prove
nance of the performance shows through in
the Final product. "Baseball" is a jokey series of
vignettes that would succeed for 15 minutes
on a green field, but topples under its own
pretensions when stretched out to an hour
and-a-halfshow.
Throughout most of the show," Baseball" re
mained at the level of representation. The spirit
of the game was captured through costumes
that aped an umpire's bold black-and-white

stripes, or through oversized gloves and bats.
This iconic construction of the sport failed
to capture the antic, balletic qualities of base
ball games. One could see Pendleton's music

video background in the dancers' aerobic,
painfully synchronized movements per
formed to a techno-esque beat.
A particularly tedious element of the stage

design was the scrim at the front of the stage,
onto which were projected floating baseballs
and snapshot-quality photographs of ball
parks. The constant barrage of mediocre im
ages served only to obscure the dancers' work
while adding nothing aesthetically.
Only during one segment did the perfor
mance rise above visual tricks to present pure,
delightful motion. "Atom Ball" consisted of a
single dancer clad in an evening gown, hold
ing a baseball in one hand and twirling in
loops and whirls. This was the only time in the
performance that MOMIX translated the vi
brancy of baseball into a dance piece that
didn't rely on props for its impact.
Mostly, however, "Baseball" remained a se
ries of riffs on various aspects of baseball: bats,
gloves, umpires and most ignominiously,
beer. This last was represented in a series of in
toxicated, oversized beer cans cavorting to the
tune of James Brown's "I Got You (I Feel
Good)" in a scene suggestive of a second-rate
beer commercial.
At the end of the show, the dancers briefly
lifted the scrim to take a final bow. The action
made me wish the entire show had taken place
unobscured by the conceit of the "Baseball"
theme. Ultimately, "Baseball" privileged over
sized Rawlings balls above kinesthetic beauty
and failed to either capture the joys of baseball
or of dance.
