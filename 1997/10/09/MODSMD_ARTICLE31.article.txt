# "Cats" Lands on its Feet
## The 						National Tour of Cats gets a Life in San Francisco 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
Here's a bizarre idea for a play:
take a group of grown men and
women and dress them in leotards.
Paint their faces so they vaguely re
semble cats. Then have the actors
prance and paw and cavort in front
of an audience and make sure they
never speak in sentences. Repeat for
two and a half hours.
Andrew Lloyd Webber did this in
the musical "Cats," which «s playing
now through Sunday at the Golden
Gate Theater in San Francisco. It
would seem that the play has every
reason to bore audiences to the
point of discomfort. However,
"Cats" is one of the most successful
musicals in history, running longer
than any other show in its national
tour.
It's a challenge to offer a synopsis
for those unfamiliar with the show.
It was originally a book of poems by
T.S. Eliot, before Andrew Lioyd
Webber set the words to music and
created a series of lyrical vignettes.
The play doesn't have a conflict
or a storyline, and it isn't about any
thing other than a group of fancy fe
lines. But "Cats" is clearly fueled by
musical and sexual energy; on a
stage loaded with creatures long as
sociated with sexual metaphors, the
actors dance through a ritual
courtship that ended with one "cat"
almost mounted on another.
What the show is actually
"about" is never clear, though, a
quality that generally implies artistic
failure.
"Cats," however, proves that the
atrical success is possible without a
storyline. The powerful music and
costuming aside, the play is success
ful for the same reasons as good po
etry. Just as poetry can "stir the
frozen seas inside of us" according
to Kafka, good theater can make you
wonder about your own human
emotions, without wondering how

they relate to the sequence of events
of a story.
In "Cats" one of the most famous
solos is that of the aging cat Grizabel
la, who comes to terms with her loss
of beauty in "Memory." Is she repre
sentative of the woman who has been
misplaced by a younger society? Or is
she just a cat who feels old and un
welcome by the younger group?
Consider another number in
which the chorus of cats sings to the
nebulous "Heavyside Layer." Again,
it is not clear to what they are refer
ring or the location of the Heavyside
Layer — a Heaven for cats, or a wait
ing ground where felines receive the
next of their nine cat lives?
This lack of contextual informa
tion affects many of the songs; al
though there is constant repetition
of, and reference to, the cryptic "Jel
licle Ball," we never learn anything
about the lucky "Jellicle Cats" who
(we are told) get invited to attend it.
Are these vignettes our chance to
glimpse the cat world through
human eyes, or are they metaphors
for our own existence? In "Cats," we
never know because we are never
told. Instead, we are given freedom
of interpretation.
And even if none of the musical
numbers is appealing as a commen
tary on life, the play nevertheless
abounds with beautiful music, vivid
makeup and costuming. As the cats
dance, contort, saunter, sway,
prance and preen, it is entirely possi
ble to sit back and enjoy the show as
a purely sensory experience.
Last Thursday was actually my
second time seeing "Cats." I saw the
play in Los Angeles when I was seven
years old, after months of listening
to nothing but the original Broad
way cast recording.
I loved the show then for its en
ergy and costuming. On Thursday,
I appreciated the show for these
reasons, but also for the possibility
that "Cats" was as much human as
it was feline.
