# Jack Palance Returns to The Farm a Renaissance Man
## 
### Catherine Quinones Editorial staff 
You know him as the quintessential tough
guy and award-winning actor.
Now know him as a writer, artist, grandfa
ther and Stanford alumnus.
Hearing the awe-inspiring, legendary voice
of writer, artist and actor Jack Palance on the
other end of the phone line made my knees
shake. My imagination was getting the better of
me and the memory of Palance saying "I crap
bigger than you" when playing Curly in "City
Slickers," was not helping one bit.
My composure was threatening to crumble
into pieces. And it did.
I lost any ability I had to be articulate and
stumbled on my words. Then I actually admit
ted to him that I was nervous.
Better still, I had caught him at a bad time;
he was spending the evening with his grand
children.
Grandchildren? How... appropriate. He is
78 years old.
We agreed on a time for me to call back the
next day, and I had butterflies in my stomach
for the next 12 hours.
"Hello." It was the voice again. This time I
kept myself together long enough to conduct
an interview about his new book, "The Forest
of Trees" (Summerhouse Press, $22) and the
time he spent at Stanford as an undergraduate.
And I realized that I had nothing to fear. Jack
Palance is a perfectly nice man who may not
find it easy to talk about himself, but is one
those rare people who can quote poetry off the
top of his head at appropriate moments.
Jack Palance: Stanford alumnus
Jack Palance will swagger onto The Farm
Oct. 10 to read from his book, "The Forest of
Love." This will not be the first time he's come

to Stanford; he was here before as a member of
the class of '47. A problem prevented Palancc
from receiving his bachelor's degree in Journal
ism until three years ago, but despite that inci
dent, the actor, writer and artist has fond mem
ories of Stanford.
After serving in the Air Force during World
War 11, Palance came to Stanford on the GI bill.
Stanford was one of four schools he could
choose from to study journalism. He had al
ready demonstrated a penchant for the news
media: during high school he was the editor of
his school's newspaper.
Once a professional boxer, Palance also
demonstrated his athletic prowess as a football
player during the '45-'46 school year, a time
when the Cardinal was known as the Indians.
He was invited to play again during the '46-'47
school year, but he decided against it. By then
he realized that "sports were not going to be it
for me."
Palance has fond memories of one of his
English teachers, Margery Bailey, who was
known for her Shakespeare classes. The Farm
can claim to have played some small part in
Palance's award-winning acting career â€” he
acted in dramatic productions here more than
50 years ago.
Overall, Palance came away from Stanford
with good memories. "It's beautiful. It's rela
tively quiet. I loved being there. That's my most
vivid memory. I loved being there almost
everyday that I was there," Palance said.
Jack Palance: writer and artist
In recent memory, we might think of Jack
Palance as the near 80-year-old man who can
make grown-ups want to wet their pants in
"City Slickers," pick up an Academy Award for
Best Supporting Actor for that unforgettable
role and then do one-armed push-ups before
his adulating audience. Or we might think of
him as creepy crime-boss Carl Grissom with

the "incredible singing voice" in "Batman."
Then there is the younger Jack Palance who
took advantage of his tough guy persona to
starring in dozens of westerns including
"Shane," for which he garnered a Best Support
ing Actor Oscar nomination in 1954.
But Jack Palance is not a one-dimensional
tough guy. Check out Rod Serling's "Requiem
for a Heavyweight," in which he portrays a
washed-up boxer named "Mountain" McClin
tock to heart-breaking perfection. You might
have been impressed by the live season pre
miere of "ER." Well, that was child's play com
pared to this puppy. It was essentially a 90-
minute movie filmed live. It won several
Emmys, including one for Palance's portrayal
of a man who has only known life as a boxer
and has difficulty coming to grips with his
physical deterioration and corresponding loss
of success.
Finally, the curtain has been lifted on anoth
er side of Jack Palance, but not on the screen,
big or small. This time, through his own words,
drawings and strokes of his paintbrush, Palance
reveals a loving and romantically passionate
side to his personality and talent for the public
eye. Imagination and thrilling fervor are re
vealed convincingly through his lesser known
means of expression, as demonstrated in his
first book, "The Forest of Love."

See the twinkling, blazing eyes of a universe
smoldering with an eruptive love passion
that threatens to derange a world of insatiable
madnesses.
In"The Forest of Love," Palance tells a love
story. The narrator details his experiences and
feelings involving a woman he cares for in
tensely and has a love affair with. For some rea
son, the two cannot remain together. In the
end, the narrator finds solace in his forest
where he can understand the souls of the trees.
The trees make him forget his human troubles
by letting him become their leader and live in
the forest as one of them.
Due to the personal nature of the narrative,
the reader cannot help but think that the narra
tor is in fact Falance himself. "I think that with
or without my permission [the reader] will as
sume that it is me," Palance said.
Whether or not it is him, Palance reveals an
intimate understanding of desire, jealousy and
love through the lucid language of his blank
verse.
Each page seems to contain a beginning, a
middle and an end, often with the first line of
the page repeating what the last line of the pre
vious page said, giving the book a cyclical
rhythm. It is not a poem. I made the mistake of

calling it such and was corrected.
"It's a story in blank verse," Palance said
firmly. He explained that he wrote in blank
verse "because I can do a chapter in a page. It's
a form of writing."
Two long weeks of separation. Why?
Reaching out through the long, dark nights and
days,
reaching for you. Evasive, elusive, at home,
waiting, waiting for the revelation.
Anxious, fearful, doubtful, suspicious.
Of what, of whom? You, or loneliness?
With clarity and the sense that each line ex
presses the narrator's innermost feelings, this
passage sums up the feelings that accompany
separation from a loved one. Through the
sparse language, a clear voice can be heard. It is
not the gruff voice moviegoers recognize. It is a
voice quavering in insecurities, crying out in
heartache.
The words also disclose a glimpse into
Palance's wisdom gained through his varied life
experiences. One line describing an episode in
the love affair reads, "A chance meeting on a
crowded street. Destiny's children."
Palance says he believes in destiny. "Sure, I
think everything has a destiny. You can break it
if you want and go in a different direction...
But sure, I believe in destiny."
The personal closeness of the language gives
the reader the feeling that he or she is reading

someone's private journal, yet the beautiful
clarity of expression suggests a carefully consid
ered creation.
Fie said that he writes "wherever the heck
I'm living... In a quiet room with quiet around
you. I travel too much so I better be able to
adapt."
Palance said that he worked on "The Forest
of Love" for a couple of months, and that he ac
tually cut out a sizable portion before publica
tion a year ago.
"One day I just started writing," Palance
said, explaining that he does not have specific
inspirations that set him off. He makes clear
that it's "like when you start scratching away on
an empty canvas and out of that something
may happen."
Palance's canvas has yielded more than a lit
tle scratch or two. "The Forest of Love" is illus
trated throughout with his delicate pen and ink
drawings of trees. A couple pages of his paint
ings can be found in the center, and then there
is the cover painting.
The cover painting is a piece of purple and
blue and green. It depicts a forest with a water
fall and an azure sky. In the foreground stands
an especially tall tree. If you look hard enough,
you can see a man standing at the base of the
tree. The man is barely there; he blends in very
well with his setting.
This publication of paintings and drawings
is not a one-time display of artistic expression.
More of Palance's artwork will be displayed for

the public next month at shows in Florida and
New York City.
When asked who his favorite painter is,
Palance responded with, "There are too many
marvelous painters to be able to choose one."
Now everyone can see that he is one from which
to choose.
lack Palance: writer, artist and actor
In the age of "War and Peace"-length, self
indulgent celebrity autobiographies containing
"16 pages of never-before-seen photos!" and
written with the help of so-and-so, it is refresh
ing to discover a genuine literary work from an
accomplished actor.
But as Palance explained it, this is not a sud
den career change for him, nor has he chosen
one career path over another.
"I'm not going to make that choice," Palance
said decisively. And why should he, if he doesn't
have to? He has not stopped acting; he will por
tray Long John Silver in a film due out in
March.
Nor was there ever a time when he didn't
write to express himself. "This is not something
that started just recently," Palance said.
"The Forest of Love" happens to be Palance's
first published book, but it is not going to be the

only book on the shelf with his name as the by
line. He has more in store. After his art shows he
says, "I'm going to sit back and relax a little and
finish several books that I'm working on." One
of those books is a novel, which he plans on re
leasing in a couple of months.
As an award-winning actor, an accom
plished writer and artist, and a man devoted to
his family, it seems that Jack Palance is fulfilling
the destiny that he strongly believes in and then
some. Perhaps he is actually fulfilling more
than one destiny.
The only way we'll come close to under
standing him is if we look at the whole picture.
It's like the painting on the cover of "The Forest
of Love": If we look carefully enough, we will fi
nally see the man.

indulgent celebrity autobiographies containing
"16 pages of never-before-seen photos!" and
written with the help of so-and-so, it is refresh
ing to discover a genuine literary work from an
accomplished actor.
But as Palance explained it, this is not a sud
den career change for him, nor has he chosen
one career path over another.
"I'm not going to make that choice," Palance
said decisively. And why should he, if he doesn't
have to? He has not stopped acting; he will por
tray Long John Silver in a film due out in
March.
Nor was there ever a time when he didn't
write to express himself. "This is not something
that started just recently," Palance said.
"The Forest of Love" happens to be Palance's
first published book, but it is not going to be the

only book on the shelf with his name as the by
line. He has more in store. After his art shows he
says, "I'm going to sit back and relax a little and
finish several books that I'm working on." One
of those books is a novel, which he plans on re
leasing in a couple of months.
As an award-winning actor, an accom
plished writer and artist, and a man devoted to
his family, it seems that Jack Palance is fulfilling
the destiny that he strongly believes in and then
some. Perhaps he is actually fulfilling more
than one destiny.
The only way we'll come close to under
standing him is if we look at the whole picture.
It's like the painting on the cover of "The Forest
of Love": If we look carefully enough, we will fi
nally see the man.

Palance, top row - center, has always been a stud.
You know him as the quintessential tough
guy and award-winning actor.
Now know him as a writer, artist, grandfa
ther and Stanford alumnus.
Hearing the awe-inspiring, legendary voice
of writer, artist and actor Jack Palance on the
other end of the phone line made my knees
shake. My imagination was getting the better of
me and the memory of Palance saying "I crap
bigger than you" when playing Curly in "City
Slickers," was not helping one bit.
My composure was threatening to crumble
into pieces. And it did.
I lost any ability I had to be articulate and
stumbled on my words. Then I actually admit
ted to him that I was nervous.
Better still, I had caught him at a bad time;
he was spending the evening with his grand
children.
Grandchildren? How... appropriate. He is
78 years old.
We agreed on a time for me to call back the
next day, and I had butterflies in my stomach
for the next 12 hours.
"Hello." It was the voice again. This time I
kept myself together long enough to conduct
an interview about his new book, "The Forest
of Trees" (Summerhouse Press, $22) and the
time he spent at Stanford as an undergraduate.
And I realized that I had nothing to fear. Jack
Palance is a perfectly nice man who may not
find it easy to talk about himself, but is one
those rare people who can quote poetry off the
top of his head at appropriate moments.
Jack Palance: Stanford alumnus
Jack Palance will swagger onto The Farm
Oct. 10 to read from his book, "The Forest of
Love." This will not be the first time he's come

to Stanford; he was here before as a member of
the class of '47. A problem prevented Palancc
from receiving his bachelor's degree in Journal
ism until three years ago, but despite that inci
dent, the actor, writer and artist has fond mem
ories of Stanford.
After serving in the Air Force during World
War 11, Palance came to Stanford on the GI bill.
Stanford was one of four schools he could
choose from to study journalism. He had al
ready demonstrated a penchant for the news
media: during high school he was the editor of
his school's newspaper.
Once a professional boxer, Palance also
demonstrated his athletic prowess as a football
player during the '45-'46 school year, a time
when the Cardinal was known as the Indians.
He was invited to play again during the '46-'47
school year, but he decided against it. By then
he realized that "sports were not going to be it
for me."
Palance has fond memories of one of his
English teachers, Margery Bailey, who was
known for her Shakespeare classes. The Farm
can claim to have played some small part in
Palance's award-winning acting career â€” he
acted in dramatic productions here more than
50 years ago.
Overall, Palance came away from Stanford
with good memories. "It's beautiful. It's rela
tively quiet. I loved being there. That's my most
vivid memory. I loved being there almost
everyday that I was there," Palance said.
Jack Palance: writer and artist
In recent memory, we might think of Jack
Palance as the near 80-year-old man who can
make grown-ups want to wet their pants in
"City Slickers," pick up an Academy Award for
Best Supporting Actor for that unforgettable
role and then do one-armed push-ups before
his adulating audience. Or we might think of
him as creepy crime-boss Carl Grissom with

the "incredible singing voice" in "Batman."
Then there is the younger Jack Palance who
took advantage of his tough guy persona to
starring in dozens of westerns including
"Shane," for which he garnered a Best Support
ing Actor Oscar nomination in 1954.
But Jack Palance is not a one-dimensional
tough guy. Check out Rod Serling's "Requiem
for a Heavyweight," in which he portrays a
washed-up boxer named "Mountain" McClin
tock to heart-breaking perfection. You might
have been impressed by the live season pre
miere of "ER." Well, that was child's play com
pared to this puppy. It was essentially a 90-
minute movie filmed live. It won several
Emmys, including one for Palance's portrayal
of a man who has only known life as a boxer
and has difficulty coming to grips with his
physical deterioration and corresponding loss
of success.
Finally, the curtain has been lifted on anoth
er side of Jack Palance, but not on the screen,
big or small. This time, through his own words,
drawings and strokes of his paintbrush, Palance
reveals a loving and romantically passionate
side to his personality and talent for the public
eye. Imagination and thrilling fervor are re
vealed convincingly through his lesser known
means of expression, as demonstrated in his
first book, "The Forest of Love."

See the twinkling, blazing eyes of a universe
smoldering with an eruptive love passion
that threatens to derange a world of insatiable
madnesses.
In"The Forest of Love," Palance tells a love
story. The narrator details his experiences and
feelings involving a woman he cares for in
tensely and has a love affair with. For some rea
son, the two cannot remain together. In the
end, the narrator finds solace in his forest
where he can understand the souls of the trees.
The trees make him forget his human troubles
by letting him become their leader and live in
the forest as one of them.
Due to the personal nature of the narrative,
the reader cannot help but think that the narra
tor is in fact Falance himself. "I think that with
or without my permission [the reader] will as
sume that it is me," Palance said.
Whether or not it is him, Palance reveals an
intimate understanding of desire, jealousy and
love through the lucid language of his blank
verse.
Each page seems to contain a beginning, a
middle and an end, often with the first line of
the page repeating what the last line of the pre
vious page said, giving the book a cyclical
rhythm. It is not a poem. I made the mistake of

calling it such and was corrected.
"It's a story in blank verse," Palance said
firmly. He explained that he wrote in blank
verse "because I can do a chapter in a page. It's
a form of writing."
Two long weeks of separation. Why?
Reaching out through the long, dark nights and
days,
reaching for you. Evasive, elusive, at home,
waiting, waiting for the revelation.
Anxious, fearful, doubtful, suspicious.
Of what, of whom? You, or loneliness?
With clarity and the sense that each line ex
presses the narrator's innermost feelings, this
passage sums up the feelings that accompany
separation from a loved one. Through the
sparse language, a clear voice can be heard. It is
not the gruff voice moviegoers recognize. It is a
voice quavering in insecurities, crying out in
heartache.
The words also disclose a glimpse into
Palance's wisdom gained through his varied life
experiences. One line describing an episode in
the love affair reads, "A chance meeting on a
crowded street. Destiny's children."
Palance says he believes in destiny. "Sure, I
think everything has a destiny. You can break it
if you want and go in a different direction...
But sure, I believe in destiny."
The personal closeness of the language gives
the reader the feeling that he or she is reading

someone's private journal, yet the beautiful
clarity of expression suggests a carefully consid
ered creation.
Fie said that he writes "wherever the heck
I'm living... In a quiet room with quiet around
you. I travel too much so I better be able to
adapt."
Palance said that he worked on "The Forest
of Love" for a couple of months, and that he ac
tually cut out a sizable portion before publica
tion a year ago.
"One day I just started writing," Palance
said, explaining that he does not have specific
inspirations that set him off. He makes clear
that it's "like when you start scratching away on
an empty canvas and out of that something
may happen."
Palance's canvas has yielded more than a lit
tle scratch or two. "The Forest of Love" is illus
trated throughout with his delicate pen and ink
drawings of trees. A couple pages of his paint
ings can be found in the center, and then there
is the cover painting.
The cover painting is a piece of purple and
blue and green. It depicts a forest with a water
fall and an azure sky. In the foreground stands
an especially tall tree. If you look hard enough,
you can see a man standing at the base of the
tree. The man is barely there; he blends in very
well with his setting.
This publication of paintings and drawings
is not a one-time display of artistic expression.
More of Palance's artwork will be displayed for

the public next month at shows in Florida and
New York City.
When asked who his favorite painter is,
Palance responded with, "There are too many
marvelous painters to be able to choose one."
Now everyone can see that he is one from which
to choose.

the love affair reads, "A chance meeting on a
crowded street. Destiny's children."
Palance says he believes in destiny. "Sure, I
think everything has a destiny. You can break it
if you want and go in a different direction...
But sure, I believe in destiny."
The personal closeness of the language gives
the reader the feeling that he or she is reading

someone's private journal, yet the beautiful
clarity of expression suggests a carefully consid
ered creation.
Fie said that he writes "wherever the heck
I'm living... In a quiet room with quiet around
you. I travel too much so I better be able to
adapt."
Palance said that he worked on "The Forest
of Love" for a couple of months, and that he ac
tually cut out a sizable portion before publica
tion a year ago.
"One day I just started writing," Palance
said, explaining that he does not have specific
inspirations that set him off. He makes clear
that it's "like when you start scratching away on
an empty canvas and out of that something
may happen."
Palance's canvas has yielded more than a lit
tle scratch or two. "The Forest of Love" is illus
trated throughout with his delicate pen and ink
drawings of trees. A couple pages of his paint
ings can be found in the center, and then there
is the cover painting.
The cover painting is a piece of purple and
blue and green. It depicts a forest with a water
fall and an azure sky. In the foreground stands
an especially tall tree. If you look hard enough,
you can see a man standing at the base of the
tree. The man is barely there; he blends in very
well with his setting.
This publication of paintings and drawings
is not a one-time display of artistic expression.
More of Palance's artwork will be displayed for

the public next month at shows in Florida and
New York City.
When asked who his favorite painter is,
Palance responded with, "There are too many
marvelous painters to be able to choose one."
Now everyone can see that he is one from which
to choose.
lack Palance: writer, artist and actor
In the age of "War and Peace"-length, self
indulgent celebrity autobiographies containing
"16 pages of never-before-seen photos!" and
written with the help of so-and-so, it is refresh
ing to discover a genuine literary work from an
accomplished actor.
But as Palance explained it, this is not a sud
den career change for him, nor has he chosen
one career path over another.
"I'm not going to make that choice," Palance
said decisively. And why should he, if he doesn't
have to? He has not stopped acting; he will por
tray Long John Silver in a film due out in
March.
Nor was there ever a time when he didn't
write to express himself. "This is not something
that started just recently," Palance said.
"The Forest of Love" happens to be Palance's
first published book, but it is not going to be the

only book on the shelf with his name as the by
line. He has more in store. After his art shows he
says, "I'm going to sit back and relax a little and
finish several books that I'm working on." One
of those books is a novel, which he plans on re
leasing in a couple of months.
As an award-winning actor, an accom
plished writer and artist, and a man devoted to
his family, it seems that Jack Palance is fulfilling
the destiny that he strongly believes in and then
some. Perhaps he is actually fulfilling more
than one destiny.
The only way we'll come close to under
standing him is if we look at the whole picture.
It's like the painting on the cover of "The Forest
of Love": If we look carefully enough, we will fi
nally see the man.
