Excerpt from "The Forest of Love":
The Forest of Love is everywhere.
And if love is a forest, love is a tree,
And a tree is Love.
There is nothing more beautiful than a tree, nothing
- Except perhaps the human mind.
This is where the tree is born, blossoms, is destroyed.
End of Love.
But with care and devotion
another tree will grow, another love will bloom.
Love has no numbers, no age.
It is infinite in its variety, in its breadth and depth,
in the coloration of its Indian summer gone mad.
The human mind! -
over which so few can exercise control
is the heart of Love.
Here lie scheming armies of exotic temptations,
Here lie brooding bands of angels and devils
poised and ready to soothe or ruffle,
embrace or repulse, love - or nothing!
And as always at the close, the forest whispers, I love you.
