## Catherine Wheel Adam and Eve 
### 
Twenty years ago, before the Sex
Pistols tore England to pieces with spit
and vitriol, it was considered an act of
cultural blasphemy to wear a t-shirt
that said "Pink Floyd Sucks."
Almost the opposite is true in this
era of grunge kids and 10-fi college
snobs who try to sound like garage
bands in million dollar studios.

Thus, it's somewhat refreshing to
hear the British band Catherine
Wheel follow the robotic thrash of
their last album "Happy Days," with
"Adam and Fve," a swollen concept
album that begs to be played while
watching "The Wizard of Oz." It
would have been even more refresh
ing if they had been able to prove the

Sex Pistols wrong.
To achieve the proper ef
fect, the band recruited
Pink Floyd producer Bob
Erzin and keyboardist Tim
Friese-Greene of the
British ambient / ethereal
group Talk Talk, who add
gloss and depth to the orig
inal quartet.
Unfortunately,
with all of the ingredients
in place, Catherine Wheel
simply cannot pull off the
spaced-out glory that
marked Pink Floyd's best
work. The bulk of the
blame has to fall on singer /
guitarist Rob Dickinson,
whose soft voice sounds
like a whisper even when
he's screaming. Also prob
lematic are the lyrics,
which never move beyond
the standard alterna-murk

even when they're stealing
openly from Pink Floyd (each verse of
"Broken Nose" begins with the phrase
"Hey you").
However, for all of its misfires,
"Adam and Eve" has a few great songs.
"Phantom of the American Mother"
plays with the tradition of bloated, or
chestral message rock by confounding
the listener's expectations. The layers

of guitars and keyboards slowly build
tension as Dickinson sings the chorus
"How you gonna feel? / if Superman
and Sonic Youth are fairy tales?," and
then abrupdy drop out right when
they were supposed to move to the tri
umphant resolving chord.
"Delicious," on the other hand, de
livers everything a pop fan could pos
sibly want: an infectious guitar hook,
breathless vocals and an almost liter
ally orgasmic chorus. Friese-Greene
deserves a lot of the credit for this
song's success because his keyboard
playing transforms the naive sensual
ity of the lyrics into raw erotic poetry.
However, the most affecting tracks
are the untitled pair that bookend the
album. These spare songs, each fea
turing only Dickinson and a guitar,
tell simple stories of love and loss, the
building blocks of real rock and roll.
They provide a stark contrast to the
multi-tracked, echoing excesses of
"Goodbye" and"For Dreaming,"
which drift dreamily into a psychedel
ic catatonia.
These endless, self-indulgent me
anderings show that while Catherine
Wheel may aspire to be Pink Floyd,
they'll never have to worry about fu
ture punks caring enough about them
to wear a t-shirt that says "Catherine
Wheel sucks!"
