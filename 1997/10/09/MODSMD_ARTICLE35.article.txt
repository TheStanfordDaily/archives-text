# John Waite
## When You Were Mine 
### 
Admit it. You still like that song
"Missing You" from the '80s. You
sing it to yourself in the shower, with
your friends when the DJ plays it at
frat parties, you like Tina Turner's
cover of it, and (though you like to
keep this quiet) you feel like you are
connected to both the song and its
writer on a "deeper" level.
Hot damn! You're in luck! John
Waite is back with his newest album
"When You Were Mine." His strain
ing, high tenor boyish vigor-filled
voice (a la the screaming Beatles in
the ending of "Hey Jude") is just as
moving, just as ready to explode as it
was in "Missing You" all those years
ago.
In a press release, Waite calls his
album "Hank Williams meets the
Small Faces." I'd call it a conglomer
ation of bluesy vocals, the chord
progressions of the '70s, the emo
tional outpouring of the '80s and
the lyrical sensibility of many folk
singers.
The simple bass lines drive many
of the songs, pushing along both
lyrics and singer in a way that many

contemporary bands are afraid of
doing. By this I mean that the bass is
somewhat reminiscent of the repeti
tive bass in Vivaldi: boring by itself,
but moving within the greater con
text of each song. The pieces are ef
fusive, and genuinely so in a way that
you just don't hear anymore without
a cello.
Each song begins softly, often
with only Waite's voice and a solo
guitar, gradually building into a
thick screaming tangle of 'Chord'
(thick enough to be spelled "cord"
in some instances) where words
don't even matter. This album is all
about sound.
Don't get me wrong. The lyrics are
quite good. They're honest and a lit
tle bit (dare I say it?) cheesy, but that's
all right because the emotional con
tent is real. The lyrics are simply not
Gen-X, and Waite isn't concerned
with coolness or toppling down our
conceptions of what is good music.
This music feels good to listen to
— melody, harmony, bass, lyrics,
being in tune, etc. There are no pre
tentious airs of nonchalance here,
folks. This is not the KIDS sound
track.
There is one horrible song on the

album, "1-95." It sounds like hillbil
ly music, and it's annoying. Other
than that, however, the album rocks.
In a mellow way. And no, "When
You Were Mine" is not a cover of the
Prince / Cyndi Lauper hit.
"I'm hoping," said Waite of his
new album," that people will go for
the conviction in the songs and the
honesty of the performance." And
so am I, monsieur. So am I.
