## Indoor Living 
### 
On Superchunk's new album,
"Indoor Living," the songs are
copyrighted by All The Songs
Sound the Same Music. Indeed,
this title serves as an accurate, if su
perficial, description of the work.
The group's sound is standard
fare for indie-rock: blurred guitars,
steady rhythm section, slightly off
key vocals and obtuse lyrics. Dis
tancing themselves from their
angst-ridden genre, however, Su
perchunk consistently sounds up
beat, as if it is happy it has been able
to survive this long as an under
ground band.
The vocals do add melodic ap
peal to the album. On tracks like
"Marquee" and "Burn Last Sun
day," Mac McCaughan sings with
such modest conviction that the
unusual melodies actually work.
Possessing few illusions about his
vocal ability, McCaughan exudes a
genuine everyman charisma.
Furthermore, the band pro
vides respectable accompaniment.
Like most indie-rock, Superchunk
rarely flashes signs of instrumental
virtuosity. Instead, the quartet
hides its ability in fairly typical
rockers like "Unbelievable Things"
and "Burn Last Sunday." The gui
tar-heavy sound is an exercise in
practiced chaos, and at best, the
group sounds like The Who with
out Keith Moon.
Still, as many of the songs do
sound the same, the album's best
track, "Watery Hands," succeeds
because the band alters its instru
mental sound. And by spicing the
melody with a synthesizer line, Su
perchunk widens its musical range.
Nonetheless, even if all the
songs do sound the same, "Indoor
Living" resonates with good song
writing and energetic playing. The
miracle of rock and roll is that al
though the music varies little, gen
erations of bands have found
something new to say.
