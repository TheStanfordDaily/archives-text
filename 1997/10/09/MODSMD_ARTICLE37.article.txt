# Kinnie Star
## Tidy 
### 
Newly popular genres can experience de
bilitating slumps after an initial explosion of
talent has been around long enough to gen
erate a pool of commercially weak imita
tions. Truly original and exciting musicians
of the second wave get buried under a moun
tain of bland one-hit sensations with good
industry connections.
Female neo-folk rock is one such genre:
Suzanne Vega blazed the trail for Ani
DiFranco, whose powerful rock made it easy
for Sarah McLachlin, whose melodic war
nings made it simple for the brainless drivel
of Alanis Morissette and Paula Cole.
The second wave has arrived, and her
name is Kinnie Star.
Her debut album "Tidy," is a gripping
demonstration of how to weld elements into
a whole. With an underlying structure of

tough grooves, Kinnie ranges from angry lo
fi thrashing ("Stiff Sour Lemon Rind") to
psychedelic tribal reverb ("Rime Gone
Wrong") to the eclectic combination of
crickets and chimes ("Urn... ah...").
Star has the lyrical genius of Bob Dylan,
the vocal quality of Janis Joplin and the syn
copation of Queen Latifa, in both English
and Spanish. She handles heavy, lugubrious
blues ("Grandma's Bicycle") with the same
complete aplomb as post-punk ("Ophelia,"
which samples a Primus bassline), delving
into the guts of every song and relishing the
innards of her music.
Star also advocates a social awareness and
responsibility that has lain dormant in music
since Arrested Development's debut album
("3 years, 5 months and 2 days in the life
of. .."), but Star detaches the religious angle
from her work. Without preaching, Star is
able to communicate her sense of what
makes the world beautiful, and she will not

tolerate anything less:
"Out there is a wealth
of fine minds / strict ad
dicts of being kind / and
so i must resign / myself
to leaving you behind,"
she sings on "Stiff Sour
Lemon Rind."
Star also took the
time to make her liner
notes a visual delight,
including on them al
most all of her lyrics,
doodles, reproductions
of paintings, pictures of
all the musicians and
quotes of artistic or so
cial commentary from
other artists. In short,
she has done everything
right.
