# Refreshments
## The
						Bottle and Fresh Horses 
### 
When you think of refreshments, you prob
ably think of something that gives you a break
from the hum drum of the norm, usually a cool
thirst-quenching drink and maybe some cook
ies. Unfortunately, this band is not quite as re
freshing as its name might imply.
The Refreshment's newest album, "The Bot
tle and Fresh Horses," adds another page to the
annals of story rock, but it does so with only a
few strokes of flourish. A political message tries
to push its way through the guitar-heavy and
cymbal-laden accompaniments on some songs,
but it's hard to tell exactly what that message
might be.
The real gems lie not in the music itself, but
in the lyrics. The group tries to cross cultural
boundaries by including Spanish lyrics in some
of the songs and a message about the Hopi tra

ditionalists in the liner notes.
Still, some of the melodies and guitar parts
shine through with personality, and a few songs
carry the standard rock ballad themes of wan
ton love and broken hearts. "Wanted" is sweetly
spritzed with cheerful guitar chords among the
rest of the accompaniment. It's a happy song,
and the chorus line is catchy in its own right:
"I've never been wanted like I want to be want
ed by you."
The group has a more optimistic attitude
than many of the angst-ridden bands out there,
so in that sense itsmusic is very refreshing. There
are no blatantly dark songs on the album, and
most of the lyrics are gleaming with a hopeful
spirit. On "Sin Nombre," the group sings, "The
best that we can hope for is to be
laughing / when we finally hit the ground."
On "Good Year," the group pulls out heavy
guitar and strained vocals verging on yelling,

hut again the novelty is in the lyrics. The song it
self would blend easily into the backdrop of any
top-40 station's repertoire.
The group uses some eerie effects on the in
tros to "Preacher's Daughter" and "Heaven or
the Highway Out of Town." Unfortunately, the
songs retain the same story-rock feel of the rest
of the album, sporting simple guitar chords and
cymbal-and-snare percussion.
Overall, "The Bottle and Fresh I lorses" is a
pretty tun album but nothing to jump up and
shout about. The Refreshments have managed
to break somewhat from the mainstream guitar
rock, but they do not have a wholly distinctive
sound yet. They will have to come up with
something more substantia! to really survive in
an industry of increasingly diverse and genre
crossing bands.
